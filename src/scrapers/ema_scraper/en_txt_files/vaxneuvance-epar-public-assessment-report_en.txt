1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V. submitted on 19 November 2020 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Vaxneuvance, through the 
centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 17 
October 2019.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“Tradename is indicated for active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia 
caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults 18 years of age and older”. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decisions 
P/0244/2019, P/0347/2018 and P/0339/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan 
(PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0244/2019 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP: EMEA-C1-002215-PIP01-17. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
1.4.2.  Derogation(s) from market exclusivity 
Not applicable  
Assessment report  
EMA/620380/2021

1.4.3.  New active Substance status 
The conjugates of serotypes 22F and 33F are biological active substances that are not previously 
approved as part of a medicinal product for human use in the European Union. The applicant’s revised 
claim is agreed upon, as there is no product on the EU market which includes conjugated 
polysaccharides of serotype 22F and 33F. 
1.5.  Scientific advice 
The applicant did seek Scientific advice from the CHMP on several occasions between 2010 and 2019. 
These are detailed below: 
EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/2010/PED/III. The applicant sought advice on the development of the 
assays to measure serotype-specific IgG and OPA and bridging these assays to the WHO reference 
ELISA. Compliance with existing guidelines and completion of validation programme was stressed. 
Important aspects for the current application are the acceptance of PCV13 as a comparator by CHMP, 
and the recommendation to use Prevenar 7 to bridge back to the data on efficacy for the seven 
serotypes in the Prevenar 7 vaccine. 
This SA also included a question regarding the use of bioburden reduced instead of sterile bulks of 
individually conjugated polysaccharides. 
EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/FU/1/2017/III. The previous scientific advice was followed, and approaches 
comply with the guideline on bioanalytical method validation. It is commented that the validation 
reports should contain information on calibration standards, QC samples, assay stability data, assay 
robustness and assay interference. Finally, sera used during validation and bridging should represent 
the sera from the intended phase 3 programme. In addition, scientific advice was sought on the 
proposed clinical development programme. It was agreed that efficacy studies are not feasible and that 
an approval may be based on comparative immunogenicity. It was agreed that the Phase 3 study 
designs, subject populations, sample sizes, safety endpoints and immunogenicity endpoints 
appropriately supported the registration of V114 for the mentioned indication.  
This SA also included a follow-up question on sterility testing of monovalent bulks. 
EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/FU/2/2019/I. With this advice, the applicant sought feedback on various 
quality aspects spanning upstream intermediates, drug substance and drug product. The scientific 
advice focussed on in-process sterility testing of monovalent bulk conjugate, release and stability 
specifications for drug product and level of detail required for upstream intermediates in the MAA. 
EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/FU/3/2019/I. The applicant sought feedback on a subset of quality topics. 
The scientific advice focussed on the equivalence of CRM197 drug substance intermediate sourced from 
two different suppliers, initial shelf life and strategy to ensure storage period extension. 
Overall, the clinical development programme has been in agreement with general guidance on the 
clinical development of vaccines.  
At present, there is no correlate of protection. The approach to licensure for V114, depending on 
immunobridging to a licensed PCV is agreed. The FDA agreed to a non-inferiority margin of 0.50, 
however, the clinical importance of meeting or not meeting this margin is unknown.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
V114 is a protein conjugated polysaccharide vaccine intended for active immunisation for the 
prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes (1, 3, 
4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F and 33F) in adults 18 years of age and older. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Streptococcus pneumoniae causes pneumococcal disease (PD). Clinical manifestations of pneumococcal 
disease include invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and non-invasive disease. Invasive pneumococcal 
disease is defined as the isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile body site and can lead to 
meningitis, bacteraemia, sepsis, bacteraemic pneumonia, and septic arthritis. The non-invasive disease 
can present as, e.g. acute otitis media, sinusitis and non-bacteraemic pneumonia. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of vaccine-preventable disease worldwide, resulting in 
considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly in older adults (≥65 years of age), adults ≥18 years 
of age with certain comorbid conditions (e.g., chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, chronic heart 
disease, diabetes mellitus, asthma), and immunocompromised adults (e.g., HIV, HSCT patients). 
According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016 Lower Respiratory Infections 
Collaborators, The Lancet), S. pneumoniae was “the leading cause of lower respiratory infection 
morbidity and mortality globally, contributing to more deaths than all other aetiologies combined in 
2016 (1,189,937 deaths, 95% UI 690,445–1,770,660)”. 
In total 247,663 confirmed cases of IPD were reported by 29 countries in the EU in 2018 (ECDC, 
annual epidemiological report 2018). IPD was predominantly reported in the elderly and infant 
population, with age-specific notification rates being highest in those aged ≥65 years (18.7 confirmed 
cases per 100,000 population). In the United States (US), in 2018, there were an estimated 31,400 
cases of IPD, with the majority occurring in adults. The estimated incidence in adults ≥65 years was 24 
per 100,000. The case-fatality rate of IPD in the US is approximately 11%, accounting for 
approximately 3,480 deaths annually, with the majority of deaths occurring in adults. In Europe, 
among the 10,486 cases with known outcome in 2018, 15% (1,609) died. Mortality rates increased 
with age (ECDC, annual epidemiological report 2018). The case-fatality rate of IPD has not decreased 
over the past 2 decades. 
Next to IPD, pneumococcal pneumonia is also responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. The 
incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia increases with age, with the highest rates reported in adults 
80 years or older. Recent studies have shown that case fatality rates of pneumococcal pneumonia 
range from 2-7%, with higher rates noted among older adults. A recent prospective study found that, 
among adults hospitalised for non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia, 12.8% had a poor outcome, 
defined as a need for mechanical ventilation and/or shock/and or in-hospital death. The risk factors for 
pneumococcal pneumonia are similar to those for IPD, and include older age, immunocompromising 
conditions (e.g., HIV infection, primary immunodeficiency) and certain chronic illnesses (e.g., chronic 
respiratory disease, chronic renal disease, liver disease, heart disease, diabetes, and alcoholism). 
Studies conducted in the US and Europe show that pneumococcal pneumonia remains a considerable 
Assessment report

Page 9/109 
 
 
 
public health problem in adults, despite the impact of infant vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccines (PCVs) on disease caused by vaccine types. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive encapsulated diplococcus, commonly asymptomatically 
colonizes the human nasopharynx. Carriage rates decline with age (approx. 1/3rd to 2/3rds of children 
and ≤10% of adults are colonised). Transmission occurs mainly via nasal shedding (mucus droplets). 
Usually, pneumococci are cleared, however sometimes they can cause mucosal disease by local spread 
to the middle ear, sinuses or lungs. Additionally, they can be the causative agents of systemic 
infections, causing IPD. The progression to disease depends on complex host-pathogen interactions, 
involving a multitude of bacterial virulence factors and inflammatory host cascades. 
The capsular polysaccharide on the cell surface of the pneumococci is the most important virulence 
factor. The polysaccharide capsule exists in approx. 100 different chemical compositions called 
serotypes. The polysaccharide capsule interferes with phagocytosis by preventing complement C3b 
opsonisation of bacterial cells. The mechanism of action of all licensed pneumococcal vaccines is the 
induction of protective, serotype-specific, anti-capsular antibodies that enhance opsonisation, 
phagocytosis, and killing of pneumococci. These functional antibodies against the capsular 
polysaccharides have been shown to be protective. Conferred protection is serotype-specific, no 
serotype-independent pneumococcal vaccines are available. 
The overall incidence of PD due to serotypes covered by current vaccines, excluding serotype 3, has 
significantly decreased in all age groups in regions where PCVs have been introduced into infant 
immunisation schedules. PCV use has led to an increase in the burden of disease due to non-vaccine 
serotypes. This phenomenon of serotype replacement has been observed especially in adult 
populations.  
A recent review of available literature and surveillance data in Western Europe reported that 22F and 
33F were among the key non-vaccine serotypes leading to disease (Htar et al. 2019 Expert review of 
vaccines). Data from 2018, which were reported in the 2020 annual epidemiological report on IPD by 
the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), showed an increase in the proportion 
of IPD caused by non-Prevenar 13TM serotypes, including serotype 22F, among adults 65 years and 
older (ECDC, annual epidemiological report 2018). Data from the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) Active Bacterial Core surveillance network (ABCs) IPD surveillance network showed 
that the proportion of IPD due to serotypes 22F and 33F has increased following the introduction of 
PCVs. This increasing trend has also been noted in other countries. In 1998-1999 (prior to the 
introduction of PCVs), serotypes 22F and 33F caused 5.4% of cases among adults ≥65 years of age in 
the US. By 2018, serotypes 22F and 33F accounted for 15.4% of IPD cases in this age group (≥65 
years) (Unpublished CDC ABCs 2018 data). These data indicate that serotypes 22F and 33F are 
increasingly causing IPD in several regions and countries. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
IPD can lead to meningitis, bacteraemia, sepsis, bacteraemic pneumonia, and septic arthritis. In 
adults, approximately 80-90% of cases of IPD present as bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia. 
Complications from bacteriaemic pneumococcal pneumonia can be severe and include adult respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, septic shock and death.  
Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disease resulting in considerable morbidity and 
mortality in older adults, and S. pneumoniae has been identified as one of the most common causes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/620380/2021  
Page 10/109 
 
 
 
Studies conducted in the US and Europe show that pneumococcal pneumonia remains a considerable 
public health problem in adults, despite the impact of infant PCV vaccination on disease caused by 
vaccine types. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Treatment options: 
Treatment of disease caused by S. pneumoniae is based on clinical presentation and antimicrobial 
susceptibility data.  
Most cases with clinical symptoms consistent with IPD (meningitis, pneumonia, sepsis) require 
initiation of empiric treatment before bacterial culture results are known. As a result, initial treatment 
generally includes broad-spectrum antibiotics that have efficacy against S. pneumoniae as well as 
other likely pathogens. The increasing rates of pneumococcal resistance to penicillin and other 
commonly used antimicrobial agents complicate treatment decisions and may lead to treatment 
failures with subsequent increased morbidity and healthcare costs. 
Treatment of CAP caused by S. pneumoniae requires rapid initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy 
and may require additional supportive care such as supplemental oxygen and sufficient fluid intake. 
• 
• 
For the outpatient treatment of healthy patients without comorbidities, recommended antibiotic 
therapy includes amoxicillin, doxycycline, or a macrolide. For outpatients with comorbidities (eg, 
diabetes,  alcoholism,  liver  disease),  combination  therapy  or  a  monotherapy  consisting  of  a 
fluroquinolone is recommended. 
For inpatients, a fluoroquinolone or a combination of a β-lactam plus a macrolide are the 
preferred options. 
Prevention options: 
Prevention of PD in adults currently includes vaccination with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
(PPV) and/or PCV, as well as prophylactic use of antibiotics in certain clinical settings. The mechanism 
of action of all licensed pneumococcal vaccines is the induction of protective, serotype-specific, anti-
capsular antibodies. Pneumococcal vaccines have demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness against 
invasive disease caused by the serotypes contained in the vaccines in both children and adults. 
Recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination in adults are typically based on age or risk for 
pneumococcal disease.  
Pneumovax23 (pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent; PPV23) was licensed in the US in 1983 and 
nationally in the EU in the 80s. It is indicated for use in persons 2 years of age and older for whom 
there is an increased risk of morbidity and mortality from pneumococcal disease due to ageing and/or 
underlying medical conditions. It covers serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 
15B, 17F, 18C, 19F, 19A, 20, 22F, 23F and 33F. 
Three PCVs have been licensed since 2000 across major markets, directly and indirectly resulting in a 
substantial reduction of pneumococcal disease caused by serotypes contained in the vaccines in 
countries where infant PCV immunisation programs exist. Prevenar was introduced in 2000 and has 
been widely adopted in national childhood vaccination schedules worldwide. Synflorix and Prevenar 
13™ (PCV13) were licensed in 2009 and 2010, respectively, and replaced Prevenar for paediatric 
immunisation worldwide. PCV13 is the only PCV licensed for use in adults and covers serotypes 1, 3, 4, 
5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F.

2.2.  About the product 
V114 is a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) that contains 15 distinct pneumococcal capsular 
polysaccharides, each individually conjugated to the CRM197 carrier protein originating from 
Corynebacterium diphtheriae C7: serotype 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F and 
33F. 
V114 contains the 13 serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) included in 
the licensed vaccine PCV13, plus 2 additional serotypes (22F and 33F) that are not included in any 
currently licensed PCV. 
Conjugation of polysaccharides changes the nature of the immune response to polysaccharide antigens 
from T-cell independent to T-cell dependent, as it stimulates a T-helper response. Due to the 
conjugation, V114 elicits a T-cell dependent immune response that induces antibodies which enhance 
opsonisation, phagocytosis, and killing of pneumococci to protect against pneumococcal disease. 
Carrier protein-specific helper T-cells support specificity, functionality, and maturation of serotype-
specific B cells. V114 may not prevent disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes that are 
not contained in the vaccine. 
2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The finished product (referred to as Vaxneuvance) is presented as suspension for injection in prefilled 
syringes containing 15 distinct pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides (serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 
7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F), each conjugated to the carrier protein cross-reactive 
material 197 (CRM197) originating from Corynebacterium diphtheriae C7. The content expressed as 
polysaccharide per serotype is 2 μg / 0.5 ml dose for all serotypes except 6B which is present in an 
amount of 4 μg / 0.5 ml dose. 
Other ingredients are aluminium phosphate adjuvant, polysorbate, L-histidine, sodium chloride and 
water for injection.  
The product is available in pack sizes of 1 or 10, with or without needles. A CE certificate has been 
provided for the needles. 
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance is manufactured by conjugation of CRM197 to the pneumococcal capsular 
polysaccharides. Both of these are defined as intermediates in the process and included as separate 
sections in the report below. 
2.3.2.1.  Pneumococcal polysaccharide (PnP) intermediate 
General Information 
The Vaxneuvance polysaccharides are the purified pneumococcal polysaccharides (PnPs) from 15 
serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The serotype designations using the Danish naming system 
are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F and 33F. Each of the PnP types has a 
unique monomeric repeat unit structure. Capsular polysaccharide is polydisperse within a given batch, 
Assessment report  
EMA/620380/2021  
Page 12/109 
 
 
 
consisting of a distribution of polysaccharide molecules of differing chain lengths (i.e., varying number 
of repeat units). Native polysaccharide average molecular masses range from across the 15 serotypes. 
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines specifically elicit a T-cell independent antibody response, which 
is not very effective in children under the age of two. Covalent conjugation of the pneumococcal 
polysaccharides to a carrier protein (such as CRM197 in Vaxneuvance) converts the immune response to 
a T-cell dependent response with improved immunological memory in pneumococcal vaccine-naïve 
children, thus priming the immune system for a future natural exposure to S. pneumoniae or a 
subsequent dose of vaccine. Compared to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines, pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccines are more effective in infants and generally elicit a stronger functional antibody 
response in older adults.  
The applicant requested new active substance status for the product as a whole, but there is already 
one product on the market in the EU (Prevenar 13) containing pneumococcal polysaccharides of 
serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7V, 9F, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F conjugated to CRM197. Upon request 
the applicant has revised the claim for New Active Substance to include only conjugates of serotypes 
22F and 33F which is accepted. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The intermediates, PnPs powders of the 15 serotypes are manufactured at a site where satisfactory 
GMP compliance has been demonstrated.  Each serotype is manufactured independently utilising a 
common manufacturing platform with slight variations to accommodate differences in strains, PnPs, 
and process stream properties. Of the 15 Vaxneuvance PnPs serotypes, 14 are shared with the 
sponsor’s currently licensed 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and are referred to as 
legacy serotypes and are manufactured in the same way. One serotype, 6A, is not included in the 
sponsor’s currently licensed 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and is a novel serotype for 
Vaxneuvance. 
The manufacture of PnPs AS intermediates is achieved in two main parts: (1) Upstream fermentation 
and inactivation modules, which produce the inactivated pneumococcal bacteria and, (2) Downstream 
purification process which consists of clarification, ultrafiltration, polishing and recovery modules to 
produce purified PnPs. There are no in-process or intermediate hold steps in the PnPs manufacturing 
process. Regarding batch and scale definitions for the Pneumococcal polysaccharides (PnP’s), the 
applicant has indicated the target batch size in grams for each serotype of final purified powder.  
One or more working cell bank vials are thawed and expanded in a fermentor until reaching a target 
cell density. The entire volume of the fermentor is transferred to the production fermentor and further 
cultivated. Optical density, dextrose, and lactate concentrations are recorded periodically. Additionally, 
in-process samples are drawn for culture purity and identity. The fermentation process is terminated 
when liquefied phenol is added to inactivate the culture in the fermentor. After phenol is added, the 
batch is incubated with constant agitation for a defined time period. After it is confirmed that the 
phenol concentration has reached the target, the batch is transferred to the inactivation tank where it 
is held for inactivation. 
The inactivated broth is then purified by clarification (including flocculation and centrifugation), 
ultrafiltration (including endonuclease treatment of serotypes 1 & 3), polishing (including phenol 
precipitation, low cut alcohol fractionation and centrifugation) and product recovery (including high cut 
alcohol precipitation, centrifugation, ethanol trituration and drying and rehydration to minimise 
hygroscopicity.) The purified powder is stored at controlled temperature. The containers are the same

Page 13/109 
 
 
 
as already in use for the approved 23 valent Pneumococcal vaccine, and the information submitted is 
acceptable. The manufacture of the polysaccharides is adequately described in satisfactory detail.     
The CRM197 manufacturing process includes an optional refiltration step that can be performed once in 
the event of a filter integrity test failure. Commercial and small-scale data demonstrates that the 
optional refiltration step is consistently capable of producing a product meeting its predetermined 
specifications and quality attributes.  
Considering that serotype 6A utilised the historical platform manufacturing process and considering the 
successful manufacturing history of the process for the other 23 serotypes in the legacy vaccine, the 
process control strategy for serotype 6A maintained consistency with the approach used for the other 
serotypes. The testing has been described in sufficient detail. Depending on the chemical differences 
between the serotypes certain parameters differ between serotypes. The proposed limits have been 
accurately supported by development data. 
The carrier protein CRM197 was first manufactured for early clinical use. The process was then 
transferred to a further manufacturing site and successfully validated. GMP batches were then 
successfully manufactured before the manufacturing site closed and material from this location has 
been used to support clinical trials. The process was then transferred, where engineering batches, PPQ 
and commercial manufacture batches were initiated to support the Phase 3 pivotal and lot consistency 
clinical trials, as well as routine commercial supply. During clinical development, the following changes 
were noted. 
•  Major changes between the two clinical sites were besides scale and site adjustments, inclusion of 
additional chromatography step (MMC), optimised control set points and composition of 
media/buffers for the production fermentation and purification steps and change of resin type. 
•  Major changes between the clinical and commercial sites were, besides scale and site adjustments, 
purifications steps HA and MMC divided into two cycles each, new WCB (originating from same 
MCB).  
Regarding development of the pneumococcal polysaccharide intermediate, manufacture is based on 
technology already available to the applicant. Conjugation of the CRM197 to the pneumococcal 
polysaccharide has been optimised during development and described in the dossier. Appropriate 
comparability studies have been performed at the various stages of development.  
Control of materials 
Original wild-type isolates for all Vaxneuvance serotypes were received and utilised in production. 
Information on the source of the original wild-type isolates for the S. pneumoniae serotypes is 
provided. No animal-derived products were used in the production of the current master cell banks 
(MCBs) and working cell banks (WCBs) for all serotypes. The raw materials are the same as already 
approved for the 23 valent non-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine.  
PnPs process performance qualification (PPQ) batches spanning all 15 serotypes contained in 
Vaxneuvance were manufactured to successfully validate the PnPs platform process. The redeveloped 
process for the original 23 PnPs serotypes was approved first in 2004 (USA) and subsequently globally. 
There have been no major process changes to the 14 PnPs serotypes used in Vaxneuvance since they 
were successfully validated for the Sponsor’s currently licensed 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide 
vaccine.  
The 15th Vaxneuvance PnPs serotype 6A has been developed specifically for Vaxneuvance and was 
introduced as the 24th PnPs manufactured at the commercial site. The serotype 6A control strategy 
leveraged a risk assessment evaluation of all process parameters, using ranges of the commercially 
manufactured serotype 6B as initial ranges for evaluation. Process parameter range-finding

experiments were then conducted. The established platform manufacturing process was deemed 
suitable for serotype 6A, and the same universal set of critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) was applied with only minor variations in specification ranges. The PPQ data 
show that the production is consistent, controlled and robust.  
Characterisation  
The chemical structures of the repeating units of the pneumococcal polysaccharides included in this 
vaccine are well established. The repeating unit structures contain between two (serotype 3) and 
seven (serotype 7F) monosaccharides and exhibit considerable structural diversity in terms of 
monosaccharide composition, glycosidic linkages, and the presence or absence of short branched 
features. Repeating units for six of the serotypes contain either backbone (serotypes 6A, 6B, 19A, and 
19F) or sidechain (serotypes 18C and 23F) phosphate groups. Serotypes 1, 7F, 9V, 18C, 22F, and 33F 
repeating units contain potentially labile O-acetate functional groups. Finally, the serotype 4 repeating 
unit contains a unique pyruvate moiety, and the serotype 5 repeating unit contains a unique ketone 
moiety. 
One-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) is used for routine PnPs release testing. 
The identity region of the 1H NMR spectrum contains signals from the anomeric protons in the PnPs 
repeat unit. These PnPs spectral profiles are unique for each serotype, making it possible to distinguish 
one polysaccharide type from another. The serotype identity of the characterisation batches was 
established by a numerical point-by-point correlation with their associated reference batches, 
confirming the polysaccharides have the proper serotype repeating unit structures and demonstrates 
the consistency of manufacture for the chemical structure.  
O-acetate is a component of the PnPs repeating unit structure for six of the Vaxneuvance serotypes (1, 
7F, 9V, 18C, 22F, and 33F). While O-acetate content is not considered a critical immunological feature 
of these polysaccharides, it is a potentially labile moiety, making it an excellent marker for 
manufacturing consistency.  
The polysaccharide content, or purity, of each PnPs bulk powder batch listed, was measured directly by 
quantitative 1H NMR assay. This assay yields capsular polysaccharide content that is reported as a 
polysaccharide to powder weight ratio (PnPs/Pw).  
The molecular size or weight-average molecular mass of each PnPs bulk is measured by high-
performance size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering and refractive index 
detection (HPSEC/MALS/RI). This method is a routine release test. For all these tests, the 
characterisation batch data are representative of pneumococcal polysaccharide bulks produced in the 
commercial facility. The data indicate that the attribute levels are consistent from batch to batch within 
a serotype. As stated by the Ph. Eur. monograph on Conjugated Pneumococcal Vaccines, depending on 
the chemical composition of the specific serotype of the polysaccharides, the following attributes 
should also be included: Total nitrogen, phosphorus content, uronic acid content, Hexosamines 
content, and methylpentose content. The applicant was asked to submit such data or justify its 
absence. It was raised by the company that the NMR assay applied in routine testing would replace the 
tests mentioned. The answer did not discuss the quantitative aspects of the assay but in the 
description of the method it is stated that similarity between each pairwise comparison is assessed by 
a calculated correlation coefficient. A comparison of two profiles positively identifies the sample with a 
homologous profile in the database, thereby matching the sample identity with that of a known 
serotype. Even if not expressing the content of the different functional groups in quantitative terms 
this will verify that the sample is comparable to the reference and thus fulfil the requirements.

Specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis, and container closure 
The release and stability specifications for pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes are provided. 
Overall, the tests (appearance and description, identification, impurities and microbiological quality) 
conducted are considered adequate. 
The methods have been accurately described and appropriately validated. 
The analytical methods to test the PnP’s were properly described or reference was made to 
pharmacopoeial monographs.  
Batch data have been shown in total from 79 batches of the different serotypes, varying from 4 to 
8 batches per serotype. All batches fulfil the acceptance criteria. The acceptance criteria for molecular 
size and residual protein show differences from available batch analysis data. Results close to the outer 
ranges of the attribute would therefore, even if within specifications, indicate that the attribute is out 
of trend. The applicant was asked to explain action taken in such out of trend cases. The applicant 
explains that the results for molecular size and residual protein are not questioned in case they fall 
within the specifications and actions taken to clarify the reason for the out of trend result, if any, are 
not described. Further clarifications were requested in the D180 LOI: The applicant has committed to 
include serotype specific alert limits based on historical performance for relevant tests and has also 
described the action taken in case a result is with the specification but beyond the alert limit. These 
actions are considered acceptable.   
Container closure 
The PnPs Active substance Intermediates are stored in plastic bottles. The bottles are compliant with 
ISO 10993. The company has provided data to ensure that this material also meets the requirement of 
Ph. Eur. 3.1 and 3.2. 
A risk assessment leveraging the results of an extractables study, the low-temperature storage and 
solid phase, concludes that the risk of carry-over of potential leachables into the final finished product 
is negligible. 
Stability 
A defined storage period is claimed for all serotypes.  
For each serotype except 6A three batches have been stored ; for serotype 6A four batches are 
included in the study where initially only one of the batches has been stored , the remaining three 
batches have been stored r. Updated stability data for the batches of serotype 6A has now been 
submitted supporting a defined storage period. Attributes tested are described. The data submitted 
shows that the relevant parameter is stable over time, even if some variability is shown over time due 
to the method. In the stability studies neither the acceptance criteria in force at the time of the study 
nor the current requirements are given. In this case the results all fulfil the proposed acceptance 
criteria and no further information is needed in relation to this but for future applications information of 
acceptance criteria for the attributes should be considered as it simplifies the assessment. This applies 
to the PnP and CRM197 intermediates and the AS and FP. 
The applicant was asked to further justify the number of freeze-thawing cycles allowed for PnPs in the 
production of the conjugates. In their response, data to support defined freeze thaw cycles were 
submitted and the results indicated that this number can be accepted.  
Based on the assessment of the data provided the claimed shelf life and storage conditions claimed for 
all serotypes are accepted.

2.3.2.2.  Cross-Reactive Material 197 (CRM197) intermediate 
General Information 
Cross-Reactive Material 197 (CRM197) protein is an intermediate used in the manufacture of the 
Pneumococcal 15-Valent Conjugate Vaccine (Vaxneuvance) active substance. CRM197 is a nontoxic 
(enzymatically inactive) form of diphtheria toxin (DT), wherein the native glycine at position 52 in DT 
is replaced with a glutamic acid. Covalent conjugation of the pneumococcal polysaccharides to a carrier 
protein (such as CRM197 in Vaxneuvance) converts the immune response to a T-cell dependent 
response with improved immunological memory in pneumococcal vaccine-naïve children, thus priming 
the immune system for a future natural exposure to S. pneumoniae or a subsequent dose of vaccine. 
The general information provided on CRM197 is found acceptable. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Manufacturing and process controls 
The intermediate CRM197 is manufactured at a site where satisfactory GMP compliance has been 
demonstrated. 
The CRM197 protein manufacturing process is based upon a specified process utilising Pseudomonas 
fluorescens as a host. 
The CRM197 protein manufacturing process is initiated by the fermentation of the Pseudomonas 
fluorescens cells, followed by harvest, osmotic shock to release the CRM197 protein from the 
P. fluorescens periplasm and flocculation of cell debris. Further purification steps include clarification of 
the cell debris, three sequential chromatographic steps, ultrafiltration, membrane chromatography and 
a bioburden reduction filtration prior to CRM197 final bulk intermediate (FBI) filling. The CRM197 batch 
size is based on a post-inoculation working volume in production reactor. The FBI is stored. 
The manufacturing process of CRM197 is described in flow diagrams, stating process intermediates and 
in-process controls (IPCs), as well as CPPs and CQAs for each step. Only two IPC and two CPPs are 
proposed for the entire CRM197 process. However, details about key operating parameters (KOP), CQA 
and key process attributes (KPA) are provided in the dossier. The KOPs proposed for each step are 
adequate, with corresponding acceptable criteria. Reprocessing is proposed for the bioburden reduction 
filtration step, in the event of a filter integrity test failure. 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
The manufacturing process for CRM197 was validated at a specified site and data have been presented. 
Validation results from KOPs, KPAs, CQAs and CPPs are provided for all steps. All validation criteria 
were met. The process validation was found acceptable. 
Hold times were validated for specified process intermediates and the proposed hold times are found 
acceptable. 
The CRM197 manufacturing process includes an optional refiltration step that can be performed once in 
the event of a filter integrity test failure. Commercial and small-scale data demonstrates that the 
optional refiltration step is consistently capable of producing a product meeting its predetermined 
specifications and quality attributes.  
Commercial-scale studies for chromatography resin re-use are ongoing. The data at commercial scale 
supports the proposed lifetimes.

Manufacturing process development 
Three sites have historically been used for the clinical and commercial production of the intermediate 
CRM197.  
The differences between processes at the three sites are sufficiently described and justified. 
An extended comparability exercise has been executed using material from clinical and commercial 
sites and. It should be noted that both sites have been used in clinical phase 3 trials. The comparability 
exercise included a comparison of release data from 20 vs 14 batches. All batches met the release 
specification acceptance criteria. Additional characterisation analyses were also included in the 
comparability package. Even though some differences are noted between the two sites/processes the 
differences have been acceptably justified, and comparability for materials produced at the two sites is 
agreed upon. Stability studies performed using materials from both sites, support the claim of 
comparability. 
The control strategy for each step of the CRM197 process was based on the clinical control strategy, risk 
assessment, and lab-scale studies. Risk evaluation/parameter classification justifications are provided 
for each parameter (information on severity and risk priority number score). Acceptable information on 
laboratory process characterisation studies has been provided.   
All KOPs, CPPs, KPAs and CQAs are listed for each step with corresponding acceptance criteria. The 
KOP/KPA acceptance criteria have been changed since the PPQ runs, based on data generated at a 
laboratory scale. The changes to the CRM197 control strategy (changes in the classification of 
parameters and changes to acceptance criteria) after the PPQ runs have now been summarised, 
justified, and supported by data.  
Characterisation 
CRM197 is a nontoxic (enzymatically inactive) form of diphtheria toxin (DT), wherein the native glycine 
at position 52 in DT is replaced with a glutamic acid. This single amino acid substitution occurs in the 
active site of the catalytic domain and is the basis for the nontoxicity of CRM197. CRM197 retains the 
other structural features of DT.  
Diphtheria toxin is a 535 amino acid protein. DT is composed of two subunits that can be 
proteolytically cleaved into the A fragment containing the catalytic domain and the B fragment 
containing the transmembrane domain and receptor-binding domain. From the published crystal 
structure, DT is a Y-shaped molecule. The base of the Y contains the transmembrane domain, while the 
two arms of the Y contain the catalytic and receptor-binding domains. 
The primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of carrier protein CRM197 were evaluated 
using a series of biochemical and biophysical characterisation techniques. The three CRM197 PPQ 
batches manufactured at commercial-scale were used for the characterisation analyses. 
In general, the methods chosen, and the results provided demonstrate that CRM197 has been well 
characterised. 
The presence of A and B fragments were elucidated since CRM197 has the same features as diphtheria 
toxins (proteolytical-susceptible clipping sites). The results demonstrated that the commercial-scale 
purification process limits the production of these fragments and/or effectively removes them.  
The lack of diphtheria toxin activity was also investigated by ADP-ribosylation activity analysis. The 
three PPQ batches were found to exhibit acceptably lowADP ribosylation activity relative to that of DT. 
This supports the consistent lack of toxicity in commercial-scale CRM197 batches.

Process related impurities elucidated were determined and specified. The levels of each process-related 
impurity demonstrated clearance, with concentrations at an acceptable level. No analysis of process-
related impurities is proposed in the release specification. This was initially endorsed except for two 
specified impurities. To further support the initial claim the applicant provided more data showing 
consistently very low levels of these impurities and it can be endorsed that these attributes are also 
not included in routine testing. 
The raw materials used during the manufacture of CRM197 are included in the dossier. Further, CRM197 
fermentation process media are described (list of components included with corresponding 
concentrations). Purification buffers and solutions and chromatography resins and materials used in 
CRM197 purification are presented and are satisfactory. 
Specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis, and container closure 
The specification for CRM197 complies with Ph. Eur. 5.2.11 (carrier proteins for the production of 
conjugated polysaccharide vaccines for human use) and includes analysis of identity, pH, protein 
content and bacterial endotoxins.  
The following compendial methods are used for release of CRM197; bioburden (Ph. Eur. 2.6.12), 
Endotoxin (Ph. Eur. 2.6.14), pH (Ph. Eur. 2.2.3), Appearance (Ph. Eur. 2.2.1 and 2.2.2). Results from 
method verification are presented for each compendial analysis. 
Detailed descriptions of the non-compendial analytical procedures included in the CRM197 specification 
are provided. Information on equipment, reagents, controls, method acceptance criteria (system 
suitability tests and sample acceptance) and reportable results are given. Validation of non-compendial 
methods was performed in accordance with ICH Q2 requirements.  
The description and validation of analytical methods for CRM197 are found acceptable. 
The specification for CRM197 has been established based mainly on Ph. Eur. requirements and batch 
data (release and stability). The acceptance criteria proposed are in general considered acceptably 
justified based on historical data and are in line with Ph. Eur. 5.2.11 Carrier proteins for the production 
of conjugated polysaccharide vaccines for human use. 
The limit for the monomer showed differences to the results seen in the data submitted. The limit 
proposed) is set based on the minimal requirement in Ph. Eur. 5.2.11. Thus, results close to the 
proposed release limits would be considered outliers. The applicant was asked to describe the actions 
taken when out of trend results are noted and these actions are considered adequate.  
Batch analysis 
Three manufacturing sites have historically produced CRM197 intermediate. Batches from two sites have 
been used in clinical phase 3 trials. Results from seven batches from the currently used commercial 
site, have been presented. Furthermore, results from two batches and 18 batches from these sites are 
shown. All results are within the proposed acceptance criteria for each CQA. 
Container closure system 
The CRM197 FBI is filled into plastic bottles. A dimensional drawing is provided in the dossier. Further, a 
specification of the is shown. The irradiated bottles meet the requirements of ISO 10993-5.2009. The 
information on the container closure system is found acceptable.

Stability 
The applicant proposed a shelf life of for CRM197 intermediate when stored at the recommended 
temperature.  
To support this claim, the applicant provided data from three representative PPQ batches from clinical 
site stored under long term conditions. Additionally, data from three commercial site batches stored for 
defined period were also provided. The results demonstrated that the CRM197 intermediate can be 
stored for a specified period and conditions. 
The stability testing protocol for the PPQ batches is planned for a specified period. Thus, a post-
approval commitment to continue these stability studies has been included in the dossier. 
Accelerated studies demonstrated that a time out of storage (TOS) could be allowed for a specified 
period. The intact monomer is a stability indicating parameter and decreased at accelerated conditions.  
Stressed studies demonstrated that a TOS could be allowed for a specified period and conditions. 
Since the manufacturing process description for MBC includes refreezing of the CRM197 containers after 
thawing, the applicant was requested to discuss the aggregation of CRM197 and further justify the 
number of freeze-thawing cycles allowed of CRM197. Such data have been submitted and a specified 
number of freeze thaw cycles can be accepted. 
In conclusion, the claimed shelf life and storage conditions for CRM197 intermediate is considered to be 
accepted. 
2.3.2.3.  Active Substance Monovalent bulk conjugate 
General Information 
The Vaxneuvance active substances are composed of pneumococcal polysaccharide (PnPs) serotypes 1, 
3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A,19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F individually conjugated to CRM197 carrier 
protein. Each purified conjugate bulk is a distinct active substance referred to as the serotype-specific 
monovalent bulk conjugate (MBC). 
Conjugation of PnPs and the CRM197 carrier protein is achieved via reductive amination. However, 
native PnPs do not contain the necessary reactive aldehyde groups. Rather, aldehydes are first 
introduced in the polysaccharides via oxidation in a step referred to as activation. For many serotypes, 
a percentage of polysaccharide repeating units is activated, although the manufacturing target is 
intentionally varied with serotype. Reductive amination chemistry is then used to link the recently 
introduced aldehydes on activated polysaccharide molecules with primary amines on CRM197, 
predominantly in the side chains of lysine residues.  
Given the numerous activation sites introduced to each polysaccharide molecule and the 39 lysine 
residues in each protein molecule, conjugates form complex networks of covalently cross-linked 
polysaccharide and protein molecules. Within each conjugate molecule, polysaccharide chains may 
contain varying numbers of repeating units. Additionally, each conjugate molecule may contain 
different numbers of polysaccharide and protein molecules. There may also be different numbers of 
cross-links between polysaccharide and CRM197 molecules. As such, a single monovalent bulk 
conjugate batch of a single serotype is a polydisperse distribution of heterogeneous conjugate 
molecules.

Crosslinking achieved between polysaccharide, and CRM197 molecules is generally in the specified 
ranges. The weight-average molecular mass of the MBC is monitored by HPSEC/UV/MALS/RI. Weight-
average molecular masses measured by this assay ranges were specified across the 15 serotypes. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of manufacturing process and controls 
The MBC is produced by the stated manufacturer. EMA initially determined that the current MIA and 
GMP certificate for this site did not cover the manufacture of vaccines intermediates. This was 
therefore raised as a major objection. Updated documentation including the manufacturing operations 
related to immunological conditions was submitted and the major objection resolved. 
The pneumococcal 15-valent conjugate vaccine contains 15 distinct PnPs serotypes. In this process, 
the PnPs powder is dissolved, size reduced to a target molecular mass, chemically activated, and 
buffer-exchanged by ultrafiltration. The CRM197 protein carrier is then conjugated to the activated PnPs. 
The resulting conjugate is purified before a final bioburden reduction filtration step. Due to the nature 
and structure of the different PnPs serotypes, there are serotype-specific process steps and operating 
parameters throughout the manufacturing process to ensure the resulting MBC meets all required 
specifications. The bulk conjugate manufacturing process has been adequately described, including 
conjugation, purification and filling. No reprocessing is described. 
MBC process parameters were identified through process risk assessment and subsequent small-scale 
process characterisation (PC) studies. PC experiments were generally designed to evaluate ranges 
wider than the expected normal operating range (which was designed around the target) based on 
ease of control and development knowledge. Statistical models were used to evaluate the PC data, 
considering both statistical and practical significance to identify critical process parameters (CPP). 
During the PC studies, several unit operations were determined to be sensitive to process variability 
and enhanced in-process control strategies were established, as needed by serotype, to ensure process 
consistency. The control of critical steps and intermediates has been acceptably described as are the 
methods used in the control and their validation. 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
PPQ data demonstrate that all batches met the pre-defined validation criteria. The process validation 
data supports the design of the processes resulting in a reproducible output. All PPQ lots fulfilled the 
pre-set criteria. The MBCs are produced via a low bioburden process which have been discussed in 
earlier scientific advices with EMA as the monovalent conjugates will be sterile filtered in preparation of 
the finished product. The shipping validation supports that the packaging configurations will give 
sufficient thermal and physical protection. 
Manufacturing process development 
The applicant has submitted a very comprehensive and detailed description of the manufacturing 
process development. The basis for classification of criticality of attributes and parameters allows a 
proper assessment of the claimed criticality and the proposed control strategy to avoid certain risk 
factors. 
Characterisation 
The structural features of the activated PnPs intermediate and of the MBCs for each serotype were 
evaluated using a series of biochemical characterisation techniques. Additionally, levels of MBC matrix 
components were assessed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/620380/2021  
Page 21/109 
 
 
 
Data are in most cases reproducible within serotypes and also when comparing earlier process 
versions. Where some differences are seen, these have been acceptably explained. 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, 
and container closure 
Analytical test methods and acceptance criteria (release and stability) used to assure the quality of 
Vaxneuvance MBC are provided. These include appropriate tests for physicochemical attributes, 
appearance, identity, assay (polysaccharide and protein content), purity conjugated and free 
polysaccharide), and microbiological aspects. The specification reflects the company proposal after 
requests for further justifications of certain attribute acceptance criteria. 
The test attributes in the specifications follow what is stated in Ph. Eur. for the monovalent conjugate 
bulk. The description of the analytical methods and their validation is acceptable. Historical and 
currently used CRM197 reference standards have been sufficiently described (manufacturing, 
qualification, re-testing and stability testing).  
The PPQ batches all show results well within the applied acceptance criteria and very good 
reproducibility between batches. A similar picture is seen for the other supporting data submitted, 
indicating that the process is under good control. Release data from attributes with numerical limits 
were statistically analysed to set commercial product specifications. GMP batches manufactured at 
commercial scale were the primary dataset used in the formal statistical analysis of process risk and 
were the focus of any proposed updates to numerical specification limits.  
The applicant did initially not consider clinical aspects in proposing the acceptance criteria except for 
residual cyanide and endotoxins, and the acceptance criteria were in many cases different from the 
levels seen in PPQ and earlier batches, including clinical ones. Many of these tests can have a clinical 
impact but are not tested at the finished product stage. These include conjugate molecular size, 
polysaccharide to protein ratio, free protein and free polysaccharide. The applicant was asked to justify 
that the proposed limits will lead to a safe and efficacious product representative of what has been 
used in clinical trials. In their response the applicant proposed tightening of the limits for certain 
attributes. The proposed acceptance criteria for free protein and PnP:Pr ratio were considered 
acceptable, but the ones for conjugate size and free-polysaccharide were requested to be further 
revised unless justified. The applicant subsequently presented revised acceptance criteria and 
supported these with results from batches used in clinical trials.  
Container closure 
The MBC active substance is filled into plastic bottles. Sterilisation of the material has been described.  
Extractables studies performed with various solvents under extreme condition found no substance 
greater than the threshold for safety concern. 
Stability 
The stability data submitted is a blend of PPQ batches, commercial batches, scaled down pilot/clinical 
batches manufactured at specified site using the same process as now proposed and batches for 5 
serotypes produced at specified site using the same manufacturing process as now proposed. Updated 
stability data have been submitted.  
Stability studies for PPQ batches were conducted at: long-term condition, accelerated condition, and 
stress condition. The accelerated and stress storage conditions are performed to support distribution

and Time Out of Storage (TOS) events. Additional studies were included and a photostability study to 
determine photosensitivity in alignment with ICH Q1B.  
PPQ batches per serotype batches and 2-3 representative clinical batches per serotype were placed on 
stability to support shelf-life. Stability indicating methods have been used for the stability studies. 
In summary, the monovalent bulk conjugates of serotype 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 18C, 19A, 19F and 
23F have a specified shelf life of at long-term condition. The shelf life of serotypes 3, 14 and 33F is 
also specified at long-term condition.

The FP is filled into a 1.5 mL glass syringe and stored at 2–8ºC.  
In some markets, sterile Luer lock needles may be co-packaged with the prefilled syringe. Three sizes 
of CE marked needles are available and 1 to 2 needles are co-packaged based on market preferences. 
The gauge and length of the needles are as follows: 25G X 5/8 inch (0.5 X 16mm), 25G X 1 inch (0.5 X 
25mm) or 23G X 1 inch (0.6 X 25mm) 
Pharmaceutical development  
Aluminium phosphate adjuvant (APA) is used to enhance the immunogenicity of Vaxneuvance.  
Manufacturing process development 
The formulation and filling processes have been maintained, with minor optimisations, throughout the 
development of Vaxneuvance.  
The applicant was asked to discuss if the adsorption and the manufacturing process impacts the level 
of free polysaccharides as determined on the monovalent conjugated bulk. In the response it was 
justified that no significant impact on the level of free polysaccharide is foreseen, which was accepted. 
Vaxneuvance FP contains no overages. 
The recoverable volume was shown to by far fulfil the minimum capability value. No leaks were 
detected by High Voltage Leak Detection Test. 
A toxicological assessment of the extractables was performed. Based on the amounts observed, there 
were no extractables found that would present an increased risk to patient safety during acute or 
chronic dosing.  
The applicant initially submitted some information in relation to nitrosamines as leachables/ 
extractables but not performed a risk assessment on the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the 
product in accordance with the published Art. 5(3) Referral on Nitrosamines 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/nitrosamines-emea-h-a53-1490-assessment-
report_en.pdf) including both active substance and finished product. This was raised as a Major 
objection. The applicant has now submitted an extensive and detailed nitrosamine risk assessment. 
This document describes an analysis of the risks at the level of the raw materials, water and the 
chemical conjugation process. Also, potential sources from excipients and primary packaging were 
extensively discussed. No sources of potential nitrosamine risk were identified. As such it is deemed 
acceptable that no confirmatory testing is required.Metal impurities were studied in the conjugated 
polysaccharide bulks substances while the formulation with additional excipient and package 
components are of pharmacopoeial grade and have not contributed further to impurity content of the 
finished product.    
Presentations with or without needles are described in the SmPC. An EC certificate issued by TüV 
Rheinland, Nûrnberg, for K-Pack II hypodermic needles produced by Terumo has been provided.  
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Description of the manufacturing process and controls 
The finished product and APA (adjuvant) are manufactured at the specified site. The formulation batch 
size range for Vaxneuvance is qualified. Satisfactory GMP compliance has been provided for this 
manufacturer. 
Assessment report  
EMA/620380/2021  
Page 24/109 
 
 
 
 
The Vaxneuvance FP manufacturing process consists of four main steps: 1) Buffer and Intermediate 
preparations 2) Thawing and transfer of monovalent bulk conjugates (MBCs) 3) Formulation and 4) 
Filling, visual inspection and storage. 
The duration of the adsorption to APA and the agitation applied during this process to produce the FFB 
was requested in the initial assessment. The applicant has described the duration and agitation and 
studies on which these parameters are set but there were still some concerns in relation to this 
following the D121 response. In response and based on the validation data provided, the minimal 
period of agitation has been indirectly justified. The data submitted indicates that the agitation applied 
will result in a homogenous suspension.  The data on serotype specific adsorption kinetics indicate that 
there is a slight increase in adsorption through mixing but not significantly higher compared to 
unmixed sample. Data have also been shown indicating that longer agitation does not increase the 
degree of adsorption. This taken together with the introduction of the test for degree of adsorption in 
the specifications with the updated acceptance criteria will allow for a degree of adsorption which is 
under control.    
Aseptic filling and stoppering of the Vaxneuvance FP in syringes occur under defined conditions for 
microbiological control. An automatic filling machine, equipped with sterile components, aseptically fills 
the FFB into syringes such that each syringe contains a minimum recoverable volume. The syringes are 
stoppered automatically. During filling, in-process weight checks are performed. 
The combination product assembly process is an automated process. The assembly of the plunger rod 
into the PFS is completed by torquing the un-labelled syringe into the plunger rod. The unlabelled 
syringe assembly is labeled by the syringe labeller.    
A thermoformed tray is molded inline, and the finished assembled syringe is placed into the tray. The 
lidding stock is sealed onto the tray and trimmed. The sealed trays are placed into a carton with a 
package insert.  
Process validation and/or evaluation 
All CPPs that were evaluated as part of the PPQ met specifications, all in-process controls evaluated as 
part of the PPQ were met, and all CQAs that were evaluated as part of the PPQ met specifications.  
The results of the PPQ study provide documented evidence that establishes, with a high level of 
assurance, that the manufacturing process for Vaxneuvance FP, consistently produces product meeting 
predetermined quality attributes. The ranges seen in the statistical analysis is often considerably 
tighter than the proposed acceptance criteria. 
Shipping qualification studies of Vaxneuvance FP bulk and finished product in PFS were conducted to 
demonstrate that the selected commercial packaging components (e.g., cartons, shippers, thermal 
containers) will maintain structural and product-image integrity from both typical and dynamic 
transportation hazards. Different active and passive thermal containers have been qualified that 
support the shipments of Vaxneuvance filled finished product and packaged finished product. These 
containers are currently in use with other commercial products. 
The final assembly and packaging PPQ study demonstrates that the process of assembling the 
Vaxneuvance FP PFS with the plunger rod produces a combination product meeting all predefined 
performance acceptance criteria. The assembly and packaging PPQ were performed on validated 
equipment designed for the final assembly operation of the Vaxneuvance combination product.

2.3.3.3.  Product specification 
The description of the analytical methods and their validations are acceptable.  
The applicant has acceptably described the establishment of the primary reference standard and the 
secondary reference standards, and these are considered relevant for their intended use.  
Batch analysis 
Batch results have been presented. Overall, the results indicate excellent reproducibility. Some tests, 
are no longer included in the specification, but results are included in the batch data showing good 
reproducibility. 
Justifications of specifications 
The specifications for the FP were established based on regulatory guidelines, analytical capability, 
process capability, clinical manufacturing experience, and stability performance. The applicant 
subsequently tightened the shelf life limits to 70-130% throughout the shelf life. The saccharide 
content is stable during storage and there is no need for tighter release limits to compensate for 
potential loss during the shelf life. 
The applicant was also asked to justify that the acceptance criteria applied in the aluminium content 
assay which can be considered clinically qualified. The applicant proposed to tighten the release 
acceptance criteria for aluminum content and was considered acceptable.  
Justification of Methods Not Included in the Commercial Specifications 
The proposed specifications are considered acceptable. 
2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability information for Vaxneuvance finished product stored under recommended 5°C / Ambient 
Humidity (2-8°C) and supportive conditions are provided. Stability studies were performed under ICH 
conditions, using stability indicating assays. 
All data remained within the stability specifications at the time of testing. The submitted data indicate 
there have been no significant changes in terms of potency, quality or purity for the Vaxneuvance FP, 
when stored at the long-term storage condition of 5°C (2 to 8°C). The data to date indicate there have 
been no significant changes in quality for the Vaxneuvance FP in the PFS image when stored at 1°Cand 
25°C for 30 days and 8 weeks respectively, to support short duration excursions to these 
temperatures.  
The results of the photostability study demonstrated that the confidence interval for the unlabeled 
syringe unprotected by the secondary pack was not met for 3 serotypes indicating photosensitivity; 
however, the secondary pack provided appropriate protection from the effects of light exposure 
specified in ICH Q1B. The study supports the recommended storage condition for the Vaxneuvance FP 
syringes outside the secondary pack to be “protected from light.” 
During the procedure the applicant has submitted further stability dataBased on the data submitted the 
proposed shelf life of 24 months when stored at 2-8°C can be accepted. The product can support time 
out of storage up to 25°C and 48 hours for the clinician/end user and the latter is reflected in the 
SmPC. 
In conclusion: the finished product shelf life is 24 months when stored at (2-8°C).  The product should 
not be frozen and the pre-filled syringe stored in the outer carton in order to protect from light. 
Assessment report

Vaxneuvance should be administered as soon as possible after being removed from the refrigerator. In 
the event of temporary temperature excursions, stability data indicate that Vaxneuvance is stable at 
temperatures up to 25°C for 48 hours. 
2.3.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Raw materials of animal origin have been addressed in this part of the dossier. BSE/TSE risk 
assessment for each raw material is provided, and the risk was considered negligible, this is endorsed.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The applicant has provided a very comprehensive documentation of the 4 different parts in the quality 
section- Pneumococcal polysaccharides of 15 serotypes, the CRM197 carrier, the 15 MBC and the 
finished product. It describes in detail the different components of the vaccine, the development of 
their manufacturing processes and the control strategy to verify that the processes are under control 
leading to a product of good and consistent quality. Quality by design principles have been applied in 
the development of the product and is also used in production. The quality of the resulting product is 
highly consistent with a very low batch to batch variability in most attributes. There is also a good 
historical comparability within the serotypes when looking at earlier versions of the processes. 
Two major objections were identified in the initial assessment. One related to the manufacturer of the 
MBC, where the manufacturing and importation authorisation needed to be updated to include 
manufacturing operations related to immunological products, the other related to an insufficiently 
detailed risk assessment in relation to the possible presence of nitrosamines in the product emanating 
from the Active substance and Finished product processes. Both of these have now been resolved. 
In addition, 53 other concerns were initially identified. These are now resolved, and the product can be 
recommended for approval from a quality point of view.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.3.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
No quality recommendations have been raised. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The pivotal nonclinical toxicology studies of V114 were performed according to GLP and were 
conducted in an OECD member country. 
Assessment report  
EMA/620380/2021  
Page 27/109 
 
 
 
2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
For the pharmacodynamics (PD) of this product, no protection studies have been conducted. Only data 
on immunogenicity are present, while the immunogenicity has been tested on the functionality of the 
antibody response. So, protection measures are rather indirect. However, a direct protection animal 
model is not possible.  
The applicant has shown that the response at the 13-15 serotypes with this product as Formulation B 
is similar to the immune titers of Prevenar, in both New Zealand Rabbits and in infant monkeys 
(2-6 months of age). The data in the animals suggest that the new vaccine V114 is as active as 
Prevenar. 
The immunogenicity data in rabbits and infant rhesus monkeys have shown that V114 in Formulation B 
induces functional antibody activity, which is expected to protect against pneumococcal infection. From 
a regulatory point of view, this is the most important conclusion from these studies. Ten (10) other 
rabbit studies have been devoted to earlier formulations during the development of this product.  
There is no further discussion on the choice of an adjuvant or whether an adjuvant is needed. The 
increase of the immunogenicity by aluminium phosphate has been shown in early developmental 
studies, not shown in this assessment report. It is noted that this adjuvant is also used in Prevenar. 
Data on the immune system parameters such as B- and T-cell response, or the response of various 
interleukins are not present, simply as this type of studies has not been conducted. Since this product 
is very similar to Prevenar, such data are not considered necessary. 
2.4.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamics studies were not performed for V114 since the vaccine did not show any 
systemic effects apart from the expected immune response.  This is conformed to the relevant 
Guidance. 
2.4.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Standalone safety pharmacology studies were not performed for V114. According to WHO “Guidelines 
on Nonclinical Evaluation of Vaccines” (2005) [Ref. 4.3: 03R07T] and “Guidelines on the Nonclinical 
Evaluation of Vaccine Adjuvants and Adjuvanted Vaccines” (2013) [Ref. 4.3: 04NHDV], safety 
pharmacology tests for vaccines should be performed only if data from nonclinical and/or clinical 
studies suggest that the vaccine may affect physiological functions (central nervous system, 
respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal functions) other than the immune system. V114 was tested in 
nonclinical toxicity studies in rats and physical signs, clinical pathology endpoints, or pathology 
endpoints did not indicate any adverse effects on the central nervous, cardiovascular, renal or 
respiratory systems. In addition, V114 has been tested in human clinical studies and apart from the 
expected immune response, there has not been any evidence of systemic effects (such as effects on 
the circulatory and respiratory system) caused by V114. 
Taken together, these data indicate that V114 had no effect on physiological functions in nonclinical or 
clinical studies. Therefore, standalone nonclinical safety pharmacology studies were determined not to 
be necessary for V114. 
Assessment report  
EMA/620380/2021  
Page 28/109 
 
 
 
2.4.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Studies evaluating pharmacodynamic drug interactions with V114 have not been conducted. The 
potential interaction with other drugs or vaccines can only be addressed in clinical studies. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No pharmacokinetics studies have been conducted for V114. This is consistent with WHO Guidelines on 
non-clinical evaluation of vaccines (2005), indicating that pharmacokinetics are not required for 
vaccines. 
2.4.4.  Toxicology 
2.4.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were performed. This is agreed upon. 
2.4.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Three repeated dose toxicity studies were performed in rats with V114. In the first, 2 different adjuvants 
were compared (APA [32 ug PnPs with 125 ug APA/dose and 64 ug PnPs with 187.5 ug APA/dose] vs 
MAA). This study was conducted with an early-stage formulation. The second and third were conducted 
with 32 µg /dose in 250 µg/mL APA (formulation B, the current proposed marketed formulation). In the 
third, V114 was administered via the subcutaneous route. In all studies, the vaccine was administered 
once every 3 weeks for a total of 5 doses. APA only groups were included in the first and third studies. 
Assessment of immunogenicity is discussed below. 
In both studies using intramuscular administration (the intended clinical route), no effects other than 
slight to moderate effects in the lymphoid tissues and treated injection sites were observed. Such effects 
are expected following a vaccine-induced immune response and are of limited toxicological significance. 
These effects included haematological findings (very slight to slight increases in leukocyte, neutrophil, 
and monocyte counts; slightly decreased reticulocyte counts in males and slightly increased counts in 
females),  very  slight  changes  in  coagulation  parameters  (increased  fibrinogen  and  decreased 
prothrombin  and  partial  thromboplastin  time),  biochemical  changes  (slight  decreases  in  albumin  and 
slight increases in globulin, and associated slight decreases in the total albumin/globulin ratio; very slight 
decreases  in  total  protein  in  females).  All  these  changes  were  partially  or  fully  resolved  during  the 
treatment-free period. 
Furthermore, slight to marked inflammation at the injection sites was observed, correlating with grossly 
noted focal red or tan discolouration of quadriceps muscles. Although the inflammation persisted in the 
4-week  treatment-free  period,  severity  was  reduced  and  was  consistent  with  partial  and  ongoing 
resolution of the inflammatory response. In fact, all these findings can be interpreted as an inflammatory 
and immunological response to the vaccine, which is transient and to be expected from a vaccine. 
The study using subcutaneous administration showed similar results. 
According  to  the  applicant,  the  NOAEL  for  formulation  B  was  32  µg  Ps/dose,  providing  a  200-fold 
exposure multiple on a µg/kg basis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/620380/2021

2.4.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Studies on genotoxicity or carcinogenicity were not performed because these are not generally required 
for vaccines according to the WHO Guidelines on the non-clinical evaluation of vaccines, 2005.  
2.4.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Studies  on  carcinogenicity  were  not  performed  because  these  are  not  generally  required  for  vaccines 
according to the WHO Guidelines on the non-clinical evaluation of vaccines, 2005.  
2.4.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
To  evaluate  the  potential  effects  of  V114  on  reproduction  and  development,  an  embryo-fetal 
developmental (EFD) and preweaning toxicity study and a postnatal developmental (PND) toxicity study 
were performed in rats. Assessment of immunogenicity is discussed below. A second EFD study, which 
was initiated to evaluate further the potential effects of V114 on kidney and urinary tract development 
observed in the first EFD study, was terminated early because the observation of RPD was not reproduced 
in the postnatal development study. All studies were performed with Formulation B. 
The absence of stand-alone fertility studies is agreed since they are not routinely required for vaccines. 
The histopathology data from the repeat-dose GLP toxicity studies in rats do not raise any concerns that 
the V114 vaccine adversely affects male or female reproductive organs. 
In an EFD and preweaning toxicity study in rats with intramuscular administration of 32 µg/dose in 250 
µg/mL APA 28 and 7 days prior to mating and on GD6 and LD7, no V114-related maternal toxicity was 
observed. In addition, there were no effects on fetal outcomes, except for an increased incidence of RPD 
in F1 pups examined on PND 21 (in 14% of the pups, versus 0% in control pups). Due to the lack of 
historical controls, lack of microscopic evaluation of the affected kidneys, and the absence of fetal kidney 
findings  in  the  pups  analysed  at  caesarean  section,  the  relationship  to  treatment  with  V114  was 
questioned.  
In a PND study in rats with a similar dosing schedule as in the performed EFD study, no effects were 
observed  on  maternal  toxicity,  natural  delivery  or  litter  parameters  or  on-pup  external  morphology, 
viability, or body weights. Importantly, the finding of an increased incidence of RPD in the EFD study 
was not reproduced. No V114-related macroscopic findings in the kidney, ureters, or urinary bladder in 
any of the F0 females (on LD21) or F1 pups (on PND21) were noted. 
No  special  juvenile  toxicity  studies  were  performed  because  no  target  organs  of  toxicity  have  been 
identified. Juvenile Rhesus monkeys have been used in the PD part. 
2.4.4.6.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed as part of the repeat-dose studies. This is agreed with. No other effects 
than expected as vaccination response were observed. 
2.4.4.7.  Other toxicity studies 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity was assessed in the repeated dose toxicity studies and reproductive toxicology studies. 
Pooled  serum  (harvested  on  day  42)  from  5  male  and  5  female  rats  that  received  an  intramuscular 
injection with 32 µg/dose V114 on day 1 and day 21 was used as a positive control in the immunogenicity

assay. In the pivotal repeated dose toxicity study (TT#16-1044) the proportion of V114-treated animals 
that generated V114-specific antibodies was between 10 and 100% across all serotypes on day 15 and 
between 90% and 100% across all serotypes 2 weeks after the last dose. In the EFD and PND studies, 
at least ten serotypes were detected in 90-95% of the F0 female samples after V114 treatment. F1 pups 
showed similar trends. 
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with CHMP guidance EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447100 entitled, "Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use" published 01 June 2006, due to 
their nature, vaccines, and lipids are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Immunogenicity data in rabbits and infant rhesus monkeys have shown that V114 in Formulation B 
induces functional antibody activity, which is expected to protect against pneumococcal infection. 
The applicant’s approach to focus on three rabbit studies (out of 13) and two infant monkey studies 
(out of 9) is regarded acceptable, as these studies used vaccine formulations that were very similar or 
identical, respectively, to the final drug formulation selected for clinical studies and the intended 
marketed presentation, respectively. All other studies are regarded as supportive data and were 
summarised briefly in the dossier.  
When V114 Formulation B, lot 2 was compared versus Prevnar 13 for the 13 serotypes contained in 
both vaccines, the responses appeared to be better comparable to Prevnar 13 responses than in study 
NZWR-16, especially for the MOPA responses. 
In repeated dose toxicity studies, no effects other than those expected following a vaccine-induced 
immune response were observed, including slight to moderate effects in the lymphoid tissues and 
treated injection sites. Such effects are of limited toxicological significance. No adverse effects on 
fertility, embryonic/foetal development or development of the offspring were observed in an EFD and 
preweaning toxicity study and a PND study. 
In regards to the observed renal pelvic dilations in F1 pups, the applicant speculated in study TT #19-
7090 that the relationship of this finding to V114 administration was uncertain due to a lack of 
historical control data, the lack of microscopic evaluation of kidneys from the affected pups, and the 
absence of fetal kidney findings at caesarean section or any other urogenital findings in V114-treated 
pups. Indeed, non-reproducibility of the findings in study TT #19-7090 was demonstrated in the 
subsequent postnatal developmental toxicity study TT #19-7170 in rats, suggesting that the observed 
renal pelvic dilations in study TT #19-7090 were an isolated finding and thus probably not clinically 
relevant. This conclusion is additionally supported by the fact that renal pelvic dilations are occasionally 
observed in test article groups in postnatal rat development studies. Considering all these aspects, no 
concern was raised on this issue. 
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that V114 induces 
functional antibody activity, which is expected to protect against pneumococcal infection. In addition, 
the toxicology programme revealed no effects other than those expected for a vaccine. 
From a non-clinical point of view, there are no objections against the market approval of V114.

2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with the V114 vaccine regimen. This is acceptable, as 
pharmacokinetic studies are not routinely conducted as part of the evaluation of vaccines, as described 
in the CHMP “Guidance on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines” (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005). 
2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Induction of protective immunity by V114 is thought to occur mainly through a T-cell dependent 
immune response which induces antibodies that enhance opsonisation, phagocytosis, and killing of 
pneumococci to protect against pneumococcal disease. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The pharmacodynamic profile of V114 is defined by the immunogenicity profile, as detailed in the 
CHMP guideline “Guideline on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines” (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005). 
Immunogenicity results are described in the Clinical Efficacy sections. 
Assays 
In the V114 adult clinical programme, vaccine-induced, serotype-specific immune responses in the 
form of functional antibodies as measured by opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) and all serotype-specific 
IgG antibodies for all 15 serotypes included in V114 were measured using validated multiplex 
opsonophagocytic assay (MOPA) and pneumococcal electrochemiluminiescence (Pn ECL) assays, 
respectively. Evaluation of serotype-specific OPA responses was the primary objective of the V114 
Phase 3 studies supporting licensure; evaluation of serotype-specific total IgG responses was generally 
a secondary objective (except for Study V114-018, where IgG and OPA responses are co-primary 
endpoints). 
The assays were validated and considered fit for purpose.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The evaluation of the protective effect of V114 is based on bridging clinical immunogenicity results to 
PCV13, which has been shown to be effective.  
There are no dedicated PK studies. This can be accepted, as PK studies are generally not required for 
vaccines.  
The applicant utilised two assays to characterise the vaccine-induced immune response: MOPA and 
Pn ECL. MOPA measures functional antibodies as the assay is designed to mimic the 
opsonophagocytosis process. The Pn ECL measures all antibodies against specific serotypes. The MOPA 
was chosen as the main immune parameter to bridge towards PCV13 and to predict clinical benefit. 
Both assays were validated and shown to be fit for purpose. 
The strategy to translate V114 immunogenicity data into the likelihood of protection based on 
immunobridging to PCV13 has been accepted by CHMP in scientific advice procedure 
EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/FU/1/2017/III and is further described in the Efficacy section of this report. 
Assessment report  
EMA/620380/2021  
Page 36/109 
 
 
 
 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The evaluation of the beneficial effect of V114 is based on bridging clinical immunogenicity results to 
PCV13, which has been shown to be effective. This strategy has been agreed upon by CHMP in 
scientific advice procedure EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/FU/1/2017/III. The assays used to determine 
immunogenicity results have been validated and are considered fit for purpose. 
2.5.5.  Clinical efficacy 
An overview of the clinical studies included in the present submission is provided in the table above. A 
total of 6 phase 3 studies (V114-007, -016, -017, -018, -019, -020 and -021) and 1 phase 2 study 
(V114-007) were conducted with V114, enrolling over 7,400 adults across more than 260 clinical study 
sites in 18 countries.  
The overall objective of the clinical development programme was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
and immunogenicity of V114 administered as a single dose in adults ≥18 years of age. Immunogenicity 
was investigated as efficacy studies with V114 were not considered feasible, which was endorsed by 
the CHMP. The purpose of the clinical development programme was consequently to support 
immunobridging of V114 to the licensed PCV13. There is no correlate of protection known for IPD or 
pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults. However, the opsonophagocytic assay 
reflects in vivo protection by the vaccine-induced functional antibodies, which are therefore considered 
surrogate markers for vaccine efficacy. OPA GMT results have been found to correlate with protection 
against disease (Song et al. J. Infect Chemother. 2013).  
PCV13 was included as a comparator in 6 of the 7 studies, during which subjects either received V114 
or PCV13 alone (V114-007, V114-019, V114-020) or as part of a sequential regimen with PPV23 
(V114-016, V114-017, V114-018). In 1 study, V114-021, participants received a single dose of V114 
concomitantly or non-concomitantly with a single dose of inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine 
(QIV). 
2.5.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Studies from the early development phase with different formulations are not submitted in this dossier.  
No dose response studies have been submitted for evaluation with the current formulation of the V114 
vaccine. As the dose of each of the shared polysaccharide serotypes and the administration regimen of 
V114 is comparable to PCV13, this absence is not critical for the evaluation. For the 2 unique 
serotypes, 22F and 33F, the amount per dose chosen was 2 µg. 
2.5.5.2.  Main studies 
Immunogenicity data obtained from study V114-017 and V114-019 were considered to provide pivotal 
evidence. Combined, the two studies represent the entire population that might be exposed to this 
vaccine, as study V114-019 enrolled subjects ≥ 50 years of age while study V114-017 included 
subjects 18-49-year-old with and without risk factors for pneumococcal disease. The methods of these 
2 studies are described below, and where possible the presentation of results has been compiled side-
by-side.

for pneumococcal disease. 
Methods 
•  Study Participants  
Both studies enrolled adult men and women from whom written informed consent was obtained. Any 
underlying chronic condition was documented to be stable, according to the investigator’s clinical 
judgement. Women of childbearing potential were eligible if not pregnant and had to use adequate 
birth control methods as described in the study protocols.  
Study V114-019 enrolled healthy (in the investigator’s clinical judgment) adults ≥50 years of age.  
Study V114-017 enrolled adults 18 to 49 years of age (inclusive). The subjects enrolled should 
either be in good health (according to the investigator) and /or have ≥1 of the following risk conditions 
for pneumococcal disease: diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD), asthma, chronic heart disease or current smoker.  
The main exclusion criteria for both studies were:  
•  History of IPD or known history of other culture-positive pneumococcal disease within 3 years 
of Visit 1 (Day 1) 
•  Known or suspected impairment of immunological function. 
•  Received any pneumococcal vaccine or was expected to receive any pneumococcal vaccine 
during the study outside of the protocol 
•  Received systemic corticosteroids.  
•  Received immunosuppressive therapy. 
•  Treatments 
During both studies V114-019 and V114-017, subjects either received a single dose of V114 or 
PCV13 via intramuscular injection (IM), which is identical to the proposed posology. 
During study V114-017, subjects also received a single dose of PPV23 IM at 6 months after primary 
vaccination.

•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Treatment allocation/randomization occurred centrally using interactive response technology (IRT) 
system. Participants were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to receive either V114 or PCV13 during 
study V114-019 or 3:1 ratio to receive either V114 or PCV13 for study V114-017, respectively. 
For Study V114-019, randomization was stratified based on: 
•  Age at time of randomization: 50 to 64 years of age, 65 to 74 years of age and ≥75 years of age. 
At least 800 participants were 
65 years of age. 
For Study V114-017, randomization was stratified based on: 
≥
• 
the type/number of risk factors for pneumococcal disease as defined in the protocol a participant has 
at the time of randomization.

•  Enrolment at Centre for American Indian Health (CAIH) or not 
Both studies used a double-blinding technique. V114 and PCV13 were prepared and/or dispensed by an 
unblinded pharmacist or unblinded qualified study site personnel. The participant and the investigator 
involved in the clinical evaluation of the participants remained blinded to the group assignments. 
Because V114 and PCV13 have a different physical appearance, a member of the study site staff was 
unblinded for the purposes of receiving, maintaining, preparing and/or dispensing, and administering 
these study vaccines. Procedures for handling, preparing, and administering the unblinded vaccines 
were located in the Investigator Trial File Binder. To avoid bias, the unblinded study personnel had no 
further contact with study participants for any study-related procedures/assessments after 
administration of study vaccines, which includes all safety follow-up procedures. Additionally, blinded 
site personnel were not present in the examination room when study vaccines were administered. 
Contact between participants and unblinded study personnel after vaccination administration was 
strictly prohibited. Blinded site personnel were responsible for all safety and immunogenicity follow-up 
procedures after vaccine administration. 
An unblinded Clinical Research Associate monitored vaccine accountability at the study site. All other 
Sponsor personnel or delegate(s) and Merck Research Laboratories employees directly involved with 
the conduct of this study remained blinded to the participant-level intervention assignment. 
•  Statistical methods 
V114-019 
The study was considered to have met its primary immunogenicity objectives if non-inferiority of V114 
compared to PCV13 was demonstrated with respect to OPA GMTs for the 13 shared serotypes (lower 
bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the estimated OPA GMT ratio [V114/PCV13] ≥0.5) and superiority of 
V114 compared to PCV13 was demonstrated with respect to both OPA GMTs (lower bound of the 2-
sided 95% CI of the estimated OPA GMT ratio [V114/PCV13] ≥2.0)  and the proportions of participants 
with ≥4-fold rises in OPA responses (lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference in 
percentages [V114-PCV13] >0.1) for the 2 unique serotypes. In addition, the superiority of response 
to serotype 3 of V114 compared to PCV13 was investigated concerning OPA GMTs (lower bound of the 
2-sided 95% CI of the estimated OPA GMT ratio [V114/PCV13] ≥1.2) and proportions of participants 
with ≥4-fold rises in OPA responses (lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference in 
percentages [V114-PCV13] ≥0.0). Since comparisons were made individually for each of the 
15 serotypes, this approach controls the 1-sided type-I error rate at 0.025, and no multiplicity 
adjustment is required. 
In general, missing data were not imputed. However, for analyses of OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs at Day 
30, the Kenward-Roger adjustment was used with restricted (or residual) maximum likelihood to make 
proper statistical inference. This model allows the inclusion of participants who are missing either the 
baseline or post-baseline measurements, thereby increasing efficiency. 
V114-017 
Study V114-017 is a descriptive study. In order to address the primary immunogenicity objective, 
evaluation of the OPA GMTs at 30 days postvaccination with V114 or Prevnar 13™ (Day 30) included 
descriptive summaries, and within-group 95% CIs calculated for each vaccination group. Point 
estimates for the OPA GMTs calculated by exponentiating the estimates of the mean of the natural log

•  Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 79 sites, of which 77 randomised participants, in 7 countries; 7 sites in 
Australia, 9 in Canada, 5 in Chile, 8 in New Zealand, 8 in Poland, 3 in the Russian Federation and 37 in 
the USA. 
First subject first visit: 16 July 2018, Last subject last visit: 20 January 2020. 
•  Conduct of the study 
V114-019 
Amendments 
There was 1 amendment to the original study protocol (13-FEB-2020; 6 weeks before the end of the 
study), which encompassed the addition of 2 secondary immunogenicity objectives relating to the 
demonstration of superiority for serotype 3 and the stringency of the superiority testing for the new 
serotypes 22F and 33F was updated from >0 to >0.1. The amendment was implemented prior to the 
last visit and database lock and therefore would not affect the type I error during superiority testing of 
serotypes 22F and 33F. The addition of 2 secondary endpoints investigating the superiority of serotype 
3 once non-inferiority has been demonstrated is acceptable. The amendment does not impact subject 
wellbeing or study conduct. 
Additional changes: 
•  Removal of IK status as a precondition for OPA testing: 
The  presence  of  bactericidal  substances  in  serum  could  potentially  inflate  OPA  titers  as  measured  by 
MOPA  assay.  An  intrinsic  killing  (IK)  test  was  initially  included  to  detect  the  presence  of  bactericidal 
agents, mainly antibiotics, in serum samples in the V114 studies. The percentage of IK-positive samples 
in earlier V114 studies were in a range generally consistent with reported systemic antibiotic use. 
Blinded  performance  monitoring  of  the  IK  test  revealed  a  higher  than  expected  number  of  serum 
samples testing IK-positive following a change to a critical reagent which affected this study. As a result 
and given the low proportion of participants reporting systemic antibiotic use around the time of blood 
draws  for  immunogenicity  testing,  IK  status  as  a  precondition  for  OPA  testing  and  analysis  was 
removed,  and  the  evaluation  of  OPA-related  endpoints  in  this  study  was  based  on  results  from  all 
available OPA data. Subsequently, the IK test was modified, and a separate report was prepared to 
summarize primary and key secondary OPA endpoints, excluding samples that tested positive in the 
modified IK test. Overall, the results of the analyses included in that report were consistent with those 
presented in the individual study CSRs, which included all available OPA data. 
•  Changes Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic: 
Source  data  review  and/or  verification  prior  to  database  lock  was/were  waived  for  some  participants 
(<2%) in this study (13-MAR-2020). Based on the very small quantity of data points without source data 
verification (SDV) (<2%), the finding that missing data verification was not related to a specific site and 
the fact that the study data were cleaned for at least 1 prior eDMC review, it was considered that waiving 
of SDV of these data points would not have impacted study interpretability or conclusions. 
Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations were reported for 29 (2.4%) participants in the study, of which 
4 participants (0.3%) had protocol deviations that were considered clinically important. Clinically 
important deviations were safety events that were not reported within the protocol-defined reporting

Amendments 
There were 3 amendments to the original study protocol all of which did not impact subject well-
being, study conduct or outcome of the study. More information on the amendments is presented in

Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations were reported for 417 (27.5%) participants in the study, of which the 
protocol deviations in 20 participants (1.3%) were considered clinically important: 15 (1.3%) in the 
V114 group and 5 (1.3%) in the PCV13 group. The clinically important protocol deviations included: 
safety events not reported within the protocol-defined reporting period, improperly stored study 
intervention that was deemed unacceptable for use, dispensed study intervention other than what was 
assigned in the allocation schedule, i.e. incorrect medication or potential cross-treatment, and no 
pregnancy test conducted prior to receipt of study vaccine. 
•  Baseline data 
The treatment groups were balanced for baseline demographics in both studies, as seen in Table 4.

V114-019  
The participant flow, including participants randomised, vaccinated, discontinued and completed, is 
presented above. 
Primary immunogenicity analyses were conducted using the per protocol (PP) population, which was 
defined as all randomised participants without protocol deviations that could have substantially 
impacted the results of the immunogenicity analysis. Supportive immunogenicity analyses were 
conducted for the primary immunogenicity endpoint using the full analysis set (FAS) population, 
defined as all randomised participants who received either V114 or PCV13 and had at least 1 serology 
result. Safety analyses were based on all participants as treated population (APaT) population (see 
Table 5).

•  Outcomes and estimation 
V114-019  
Primary Immunogenicity endpoints 
V114 met non-inferiority criteria for the 13 shared serotypes (lower bound of 95% CI GMT ratio ≥0.5) 
and superiority criteria (lower bound of 95% CI GMT ratio ≥2.0) for the 2 unique serotypes as 
assessed by the serotype-specific OPA GMTs at 30 days postvaccination, see Figure 1.

Data Source: Mod5.3.5.1/p019v114/Fig 11-1 
V114 met superiority criteria for the 2 unique serotypes in V114 as assessed by the proportions of 
participants with a ≥4-fold rise in serotype-specific OPA responses from prevaccination to 30 days 
postvaccination, see Table 7. The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the differences (V114 – 
PCV13) between the proportions of participants with a ≥4-fold rise was >0.1 for both unique 
serotypes.

30 for serotypes 22F and 33F - PP population V114-019 
Data Source: Mod5.3.5.1/p019v114/Tab 11-2 
Results for serotype-specific OPA GMTs and proportions of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in OPA 
responses from prevaccination to 30 days postvaccination in the FAS population were consistent with 
those observed in the PP population. 
Secondary Immunogenicity endpoints 
V114 met superiority criteria for serotype 3 as assessed by the OPA GMTs at 30 days postvaccination 
(see Figure 1, lower bound of 95% CI GMT ratio >1.2) and the proportions of participants with a ≥4-
fold rise in OPA responses from prevaccination to 30 days postvaccination (see Table 8 lower bound of 
95% CI V114 – PCV13 >0). Results for the FAS population were consistent with those for the PP 
population.

for Serotype 3 – PP population 
Trends observed for serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days postvaccination were consistent with the 
primary analysis of OPA GMTs, with results being generally comparable for 12 of the shared serotypes 
between V114 and PCV13 and higher in the V114 group for the 2 unique serotypes and serotype 3. 
Similar trends were observed for serotype-specific GMFRs and proportions of participants with a ≥4-

Primary Immunogenicity endpoints 
Both V114 and PCV 13 elicited an immune response in immunocompetent adults with or without risk 
factors for pneumococcal disease as assessed by OPA GMTs 30 days postvaccination for all serotypes 
contained in each vaccine, see Table 10.  
Serotype-specific OPA GMTs at 30 days postvaccination in the FAS population were consistent with 
those observed in the PP population in each intervention group.

Table 10 Summary of OPA GMTs at Day 30 – PP population V114-017 
Secondary Immunogenicity endpoints 
Serotype-specific OPA GMTs were lower at Month 6, prior to vaccination with PPV23, than Day 30 but 
remained above baseline levels for all the serotypes contained in the either V114 or PCV13 groups, see 
Table 11 for 3 by the assessor chosen examples.  
PPV23 vaccination at Month 6 following vaccination with either V114 or PCV13 was immunogenic for all 
15 serotypes, including 22F and 33F, as assessed by serotype-specific OPA GMTs at 30 days 
postvaccination with PPV23 (Month 7), see Table 11 for 3 by the assessor chosen for examples. The 
magnitude of serotype-specific OPA GMFRs and proportions of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in OPA 
titres varied by serotype from Month 6 to Month 7; however, the GMFRs and proportions of 
participants with a ≥4-fold rise in OPA titres were higher between Day 1 and Day 30 (following 
vaccination with V114 or PCV13) than levels observed between Month 6 and Month 7 (following PPV23 
vaccination).

Trends observed for serotype-specific IgG GMCs were consistent with the primary analysis of OPA 
GMTs, with V114 and PCV13 being immunogenic and inducing an antibody response that remained for 
at least 6 months postvaccination.  
Exploratory Immunogenicity endpoints 
Serotype-specific OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs at 30 days postvaccination were generally comparable 
across intervention groups for the 13 shared serotypes between V114 and PCV13 and higher in the 
V114 group for the 2 unique serotypes, see Figure 2.

15 serotypes. 
•  Ancillary analyses 
Age 
V114-019 
V114 was immunogenic within each age subgroup (50 to 64 years of age, 65 to 74 years of age and 
≥75 years of age) as assessed by OPA GMTs for all 15 serotypes 30 days postvaccination. A trend 
towards lower immunogenicity was seen in the older age groups (65 to 74 years of age and ≥75 years 
of age) compared with the younger age group (50 to 64 years of age), see Table 12.

V114-017 
V114 was immunogenic within each age subgroup (18 to 29, 30 to 39 and 40 to 49 years of age) as 
assessed by OPA GMTs, see Table 13. As expected, a trend towards lower immunogenicity was seen in 
the older age group (40 to 49 years of age) compared with the younger age group (18 to 29 years of 
age).

Sex, Race and Ethnicity 
V114-019 
V114 was immunogenic in both male and female participants as assessed by OPA GMTs for all 
15 serotypes contained in the vaccine 30 days postvaccination. The ratio of OPA GMTs between male 
and female participants for all serotypes ranged from 0.56 to 0.86. A similar range was observed for 
PCV13.  
Similar results were observed when comparing race subgroups and both ethnic subgroups, with V114 
being immunogenic and resulting in OPA GMT ratios between V114 and PCV13 at 30 days 
postvaccination that are generally consistent with the OPA GMT ratios between V114 and PCV13 
observed for the overall population.  
V114-017 
V114 was immunogenic in both male and female participants, as assessed by OPA GMTs between male 
and female participants for all 15 serotypes contained in the vaccine 30 days postvaccination. 
Immunogenicity was comparable, as the ratio of OPA GMTs between male and female participants for 
all serotypes ranged from 0.87 to 1.18, except for serotype 1, which was 1.51.  
Slight differences in immune response could be observed between the subgroups in race and ethnicity, 
however no clear trends were observed as assessed by OPA GMTs for all 15 serotypes contained in the 
vaccine 30 days postvaccination.  
Risk factors 
V114-017 
V114 was immunogenic in participants with no, a single and 2 or more risk factors as assessed by OPA 
GMTs for all 15 serotypes in the vaccine 30 days postvaccination, see Table 14. Similar results were 
seen for IgG GMCs. PPV23 vaccination following either V114 or PCV13, was immunogenic in 
participants with no, a single and 2 or more risk factors as assessed by OPA GMTs for all 15 serotypes 
tested 30 days postvaccination (data not shown).

Serotype-specific OPA Responses at 30 Days Postvaccination 
V114 met non-inferiority criteria for the 13 shared serotypes as assessed by 
serotype-specific  OPA  GMTs  at  30  days  postvaccination.  The  lower  bound  of 
the  95%  CI  of  the  estimated  OPA  GMT  ratio  (V114/PCV13)  was  >0.5  for  all 
shared serotypes. 
V114 met superiority criteria for the 2 serotypes unique to V114 as assessed 
by serotype-specific OPA GMTs at 30 days postvaccination. The lower bound of 
the 95% CI of the estimated OPA GMT ratio (V114/ PCV13) was >2.0 for both 
unique serotypes. 
Notes 
V114 met superiority criteria for the 2 serotypes unique to V114 as assessed 
by the proportions of participants with a ≥4-fold rise from prevaccination to 30 
days postvaccination for serotype-specific OPA responses. The lower bound of 
the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference in percentages [V114- PCV13] was >10 
percentage points for both unique serotypes. 
The  clinical  impact  of  meeting  the  non-inferiority  or  superiority  margin  is 
unknown. 
Results for OPA responses are presented in Figure 1 
OPA  GMTs  at  Day  30  postvaccination  were  lower  for  7  of  the  13  shared 
serotypes in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group, with serotype 1, 
4, 5, 7F, 9V, 14 and 19F having a upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI that did 
not contain 1.00. 
Serotypes  3  and  6B  had  OPA  GMTs  that  were  higher  in  the  V114  group 
compared to the PCV13 group, with a lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI that 
was higher than 1.00.

Serotype 3 OPA Responses at 30 Days Postvaccination 
V114 met the superiority criterion for serotype 3 as assessed by the OPA GMTs 
at 30 days postvaccination. The lower bound of the 95% CI of the OPA GMT 
ratio (V114/ PCV13) was >1.2. 
V114  met  the  superiority  criterion  for  serotype  3  as  assessed  by  the 
proportions of participants with a ≥4-fold rise from prevaccination to 30 days 
postvaccination for OPA responses. The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of 
the difference in percentages [V114- PCV13] was >0 percentage points. 
Serotype-specific IgG responses at 30 Days Postvaccination 
Between-group  comparisons  of  IgG  GMCs  at  30  days  postvaccination  were 
consistent with the primary analysis of OPA GMTs. 
The clinical impact of meeting the superiority margin is unknown. 
Results  for  proportion  of  participants  achieving  ≥4-fold  rise  in  OPA  GMT  are

2.5.5.3.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
V114-016, V114-019 and V114-020 enrolled pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults ≥50 years of age, and 
the results from these studies were directly compared. Demographic characteristics were generally 
comparable across the intervention groups: median age ranging from 64.5 to 67.0 years old, and the 
majority of participants were female, white, and not of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Randomization was 
stratified by age group (50 to 64 years of age, 65 to 74 years of age and ≥75 years of age) to ensure 
balance across intervention groups with respect to age. 
A consistent immune response was observed across studies in pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults 
≥50 years of age, as assessed by OPA GMTs (see Figure 3), IgG GMCs, OPA and IgG GMFRs, and 
proportions of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in OPA and IgG responses from pre-vaccination to 30 
days post-vaccination with PCV.  
A trend toward lower serotype-specific OPA GMTs in the older age groups (65 to 74 years of age and 
≥75 years of age) compared with the younger age group (50 to 64 years of age) was seen (data 
presented in clinical AR).

Immunogenicity responses in adults 18-49 years of age compared to adults ≥50 years of age 
(V114-017, V114-019) 
For all 15 serotypes in V114, OPA GMTs at 30 days post-vaccination in V114-017 (adults 18 to 49 
years of age) following vaccination with V114 were generally comparable to or higher than OPA GMTs 
in study V114-019 (adults ≥50 years of age) in both intervention groups. In addition, trends observed 
for OPA GMTs in study V114-017 were generally consistent with the results of study V114-019, which 
demonstrated non-inferiority of V114 to PCV13 for the shared serotypes in V114 and superiority of 
V114 to PCV13 for serotypes 3, 22F, and 33F at 30 days post-vaccination with PCV. Similar trends 
were observed for OPA GMFRs and proportions of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in OPA responses 
from pre-vaccination to 30 days post-vaccination with PCV.

2.5.5.4.  Clinical studies in special populations 
HIV-1 infected subjects 
Study V114-018 was a randomised, double-blind, active comparator-controlled study. Participants 
were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of V114 or PCV13 on Day 1, followed by a 
single dose of PPV23 at Week 8.  
In total, 302 subjects were enrolled, of which 152 participants were vaccinated with V114, and 
150 participants were vaccinated with PCV13. In total, 10 participants discontinued the study, 7 
(4.6%) in the V114 group and 3 (2.0%) in the PCV13 group. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable between the intervention groups. The 
median age was 41.0 years, ranging from 21 to 74 years. The majority of participants were male 
(78.8%) and not Hispanic or Latino (68.2%). In total, 4 (1.3%) participants had a CD4+ T-cell count 
of ≥50 to <200 cells/µL, 152 (50.3%) participants had a CD4+ T-cell count of ≥200 to <500 cells/µL, 
and 146 (48.3%) participants had a CD4+ T-cell count of ≥500 cells/µL. All participants received 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) prior to study entry.

Both V114 and PCV13 were immunogenic in pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults infected with HIV-1 as 
assessed by OPA GMTs, see Table 18, and IgG GMCs at 30 days postvaccination for all serotypes 
contained in the vaccines. Similar results were observed in both CD4+ T-cell count subgroups (≥200 to 
<500 cells/µL and ≥500 cells/µL) (data are not shown). In both intervention groups, there was a trend 
toward higher serotype-specific OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs at 30 days postvaccination in participants 
with CD4+ T-cell count ≥500 cells/µL compared with participants with CD4+ T-cell count ≥200 to 
<500 cells/µL. 
Table 18 Summary of OPA GMTs at Day 30 – PP population v114-018 
Serotype-specific OPA GMTs at Day 30 postvaccination with PPV23 (Week 12) were generally 
comparable with those observed at 30 days postvaccination with either V114 or PCV13 (data presented 
in clinical AR). Similar results were observed for IgG GMCs at 30 days postvaccination with PPV23.

2.5.5.5.  Supportive studies 
The supportive studies, V114-007, V114-016, V114-020 and V114-021, showed results that are in line 
with the results achieved with the pivotal studies. V114-016 and V114-020 were included in the 
analysis across studies.  
Study V114-007 was designed to compare the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of V114 and 
PCV13 in healthy adults aged ≥65 years who were vaccinated previously with PPV23 at least 1 year 
prior to study entry. The results showed that serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days postvaccination 
were generally comparable in the V114 and PCV13 groups for the shared serotypes and higher in V114 
recipients for the unique serotypes. Trends observed for OPA GMTs at 30 days postvaccination were 
generally consistent with the primary analysis results for the IgG GMCs. For both interventions, the 
response is lower compared to the response seen in pneumococcal vaccine naïve subjects, as shown by 
the proportion of patients with a ≥ 4-fold rise in GMT at Day 30. For pneumococcal vaccines, it is 
known that GMTs after the second dose are generally lower than after the first dose (Greenberg et al. 
Vaccine 2014), however, an immune response is still elicited. 
Study V114-016 was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of V114 
followed by PPV23 1 year later in healthy adults aged ≥50 years. The results showed that OPA GMTs at 
30 days postvaccination with V114 or PCV13 were generally comparable for the 13 shared serotypes, 
with the exception of serotype 3, which was higher in the V114 group compared with the PCV13 group 
(see Figure 3). OPA GMTs at 30 days postvaccination for the 2 unique serotypes were higher in the 
V114 group compared with those observed in the PCV13 group. 
Both V114 and PCV13 elicit immune responses that persist for at least 12 months postvaccination. 
Serotype-specific OPA GMTs at Month 12 postvaccination were lower than at Day 30, but higher than 
the OPA GMTs at baseline (Day 1), as represented by serotype 6A, 6B, 7F and 9V in Figure 4. At 30 
days postvaccination with PPV23, serotype-specific OPA GMTs were comparable between participants 
administered a sequential regimen of V114 followed by PPV23 or PCV13 followed by PPV23 for all 
15 serotypes in V114, represented by serotype 6A, 6B, 7F and 9V in Figure 4. Similar results were 
seen for serotype-specific IgG GMCs.

Study V114-020 was a lot-to-lot consistency study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and 
immunogenicity of V114 in healthy adults 50 years of age or older. V114 elicited an immune response 
to all 15 serotypes that was consistent across 3 lots of V114 as measured by OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs 
at 30 days postvaccination. 
Study V114-021 was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of V114 when 
administered concomitantly with the influenza vaccine in healthy adults 50 years of age or older. V114 
administered concomitantly with QIV was non-inferior to V114 administered non-concomitantly with 
QIV as assessed by serotype-specific OPA GMTs at 30 days postvaccination with V114, see Figure 5. 
QIV administered concomitantly with V114 was non-inferior to QIV administered non-concomitantly 
with V114 as assessed by strain-specific HAI GMTs at 30 days postvaccination with QIV (data 
presented in Clinical Assessment report). OPA GMTs and HAI GMTs at 30 days postvaccination in the 
FAS population were generally consistent with those observed in the PP population.

Serotype-specific OPA GMT ratios and strain-specific HAI GMT ratios for the concomitant versus non-
concomitant group at 30 days post-vaccination were generally consistent with the ratios observed in 
the overall population in subgroups based on age, sex, race, ethnicity and history of PNEUMOVAX23. 
Nevertheless, there was a trend toward lower serotype-specific OPA GMTs and H1N1 HAI GMTs in the 
older age groups (65 to 74 and ≥75 years of age) compared with the younger age group (50 to 64 
years of age). In addition, subjects with a history of PPV23 administration showed lower OPA GMTs 
compared to PPV23 naïve subjects. This was also observed with H1N1 HAI GMTs but less pronounced. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The sought indication for V114 is active immunisation for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal 
disease (IPD) and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults 18 years of age and 
older. V114 is a 15-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV) containing the 13 serotypes (1, 3, 
4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) included in the licensed vaccine Prevenar 13TM 
(PCV13), plus 2 additional serotypes (22F and 33F) that are not included in any currently licensed PCV. 
This application is based on immunogenicity data from 6 phase 3 studies (V114-016, -017, -018, -019, 
-020 and -021) and 1 phase 2 study (V114-007). Immunogenicity data obtained from study V114-017 
and V114-019 were considered by the Assessor to provide the main evidence. The objective of both 
studies was to determine the immunogenicity and safety of V114. The applicant put forward V114-019 
as pivotal, as the main use of V114 will be in elderly subjects, and this study included healthy adults 
≥50 years of age. However, the indication states the use in adults 18 years of age and older. Study 
V114-017 included adults ≥18 years of age with and without risk factors for pneumococcal disease. 
Risk factors included underlying comorbidities (i.e., diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, chronic 
lung disease including asthma, chronic heart disease) and behavioural factors (current smoker, 
increased alcohol use). Combined, these two studies represent the entire target population for this 
vaccine. The objective of the other studies was to determine the immunogenicity of sequential 
vaccinations (Pneumovax 23 [PPV] followed by PCV in V114-007 or PCV followed by PPV in V114-016), 
lot-to-lot consistency (V114-020), immunogenicity and safety of V114 in HIV-positive participants 
(V114-018) and the effect of concomitant vaccination with an influenza vaccine (V114-021). 
No efficacy or effectiveness data is available, which is accepted since efficacy trials were not feasible. 
There is no correlate of protection known for IPD or pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae 
in adults. The opsonophagocytic assay reflects in vivo protection by the vaccine-induced antibodies and 
has been found to correlate with protection against disease (Song et al. J. Infect Chemother. 2013). 
Therefore, opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) geometric mean titres (GMTs) are considered surrogate 
markers for vaccine efficacy. The objective of the clinical development programme was to support 
immunobridging of V114 to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes. Since PCV13 is the only licensed 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine licensed for adults in the EU and based on its similar composition, its 
use as a comparator is supported. This has also been previously agreed in a scientific advice. 
The development programme has been formally discussed with CHMP at various moments throughout 
development, and an agreement was reached regarding the key elements of the clinical development 
plan.

EMA/620380/2021 
Page 68/109 
 
 
 
Dose selection 
No dose-selection studies were submitted. For each of the 13 shared serotypes, a similar dosage as in 
the licensed PCV13 was maintained, i.e. 2 µg/serotype/dose and 4 µg/dose for serotype 6B. For the 
2 unique serotypes, 22F and 33F, not present in PCV13 a dose of 2 µg/serotype/dose was selected. 
The V114 clinical programme was designed to demonstrate that the 0.5 mL IM dose is both safe and 
immunologically similar to the licensed PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes and superior for the 2 
unique serotypes, which is agreed with. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
All 7 clinical studies included in the application were randomised, double-blind, placebo/ active 
comparator PCV13-controlled, multicentre studies. This study design is considered adequate. In all 
studies, vaccination with V114 consisted of a single IM dose of 0.5 mL, which is the posology 
recommended in the applicant’s SmPC. The posology of PCV13, the comparator, was in line with the 
approved regimen for PCV13. Immunogenicity was evaluated immediately before and 30 days after 
vaccination. In three studies, immunogenicity of sequential vaccination of V114/PCV13 followed by 
PPV23 was evaluated, also covering different time intervals between vaccinations (8 weeks, 6 months 
and 12 months), which is in line with several national vaccination recommendations. Due to the 
evaluation of the sequential vaccination also long-term data on immune persistence of V114 is 
available for 6 months (946 subjects) and 12 months (321 subjects). The studies were conducted 
globally, with countries in Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Oceania.  
In the main studies, the primary immunogenicity objective was to assess serotype-specific OPA GMTs 
at 30 days postvaccination (Day 30) with V114 and PCV13. This objective is considered to provide 
pivotal immunogenicity information for the MA application as OPAs are used as surrogate markers for 
protection against disease. There is no correlate of protection for pneumococcal disease in adults. 
Secondary immunogenicity objectives included the evaluation of the serotype-specific IgG geometric 
mean concentrations (GMCs), the serotype-specific geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) and proportions 
of participants with a ≥4-fold rise from prevaccination (Day 1) to 30 days postvaccination (Day 30) for 
both OPA and IgG responses for participants administered V114 and PCV13. These objectives are 
considered acceptable for this clinical development programme, as IgG GMCs, GMFRs and the 
proportion of patients with a ≥4-fold rise after vaccination will provide information on the consistency 
and robustness of the immune response and insight into the proportion of responders. Immunogenicity 
endpoints seem appropriately chosen and in line with the vaccine guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/VWP/164653/05 Rev.1). The presented serological assays are overall considered 
appropriate and fit for purpose.  
Study V114-019 was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority (for 13 shared serotypes) and superiority 
(for 2 serotypes unique to V114) of V114 compared to PCV13. Of note, the observed OPA GMTs at 
each timepoint were calculated based on participants with an available OPA titer measurement at that 
specific timepoint. OPA GMFR from Day 1 to Day 30 was calculated among participants who have OPA 
titer measurements at both Day 1 and Day 30. This resulted in a slightly different population included, 
however, the difference between the ratio of Day 30 GMT to Day 1 GMT is nearly identical to the value 
of the GMFR, and thus this slight difference does not impact the overall conclusion. 
Study V114-017 was a descriptive study and not designed to test a statistical hypothesis. The main 
driver was to substantially contribute to the overall safety database, which is acceptable. 
The randomisation and blinding procedures seem overall acceptable for both studies.  
Few protocol amendments and changes have been made, which are mainly acceptable.

Analyses were performed on the PP population, defined as all randomised participants without protocol 
deviations that could have substantially impacted the results of the immunogenicity analysis. The main 
reason for excluding the immunogenicity analysis in both studies was missing serology results for all 
15 serotypes and blood draw out of window. For study V114-017, not being vaccinated with PPV23 was 
also a main reason for exclusion. Safety analyses were based on the all participants as treated 
population (APaT) population. The analysis sets and the statistical analysis of the primary and 
secondary endpoints are generally considered adequate. Multiplicity was controlled by testing each of 
the co-primary hypotheses at a 1-sided 0.025 level of significance and predicating study success on all 
co-primary immunogenicity hypotheses having been met. The addition of two superiority hypotheses 
during the conduct of the study is considered acceptable, considering the corresponding decision was 
taken independent of (preliminary) immunogenicity data. 
Immunogenicity data and additional analyses 
During the main studies, the participant flow was comparable between the treatment groups. Low 
numbers of participants discontinued the studies. In study V114-019, one protocol deviation led to 
discontinuation of the study. Baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment groups in both 
studies. Study V114-019 included healthy adults with a median age of 66 years (range: 50 to 92), of 
which 830 participants (69%) were ≥65 years of age. Of the participants, 57.3% were male, 67.7% 
were white, and 78.0% were not Hispanic or Latino. Study V114-017 included adults 18 to 49 years of 
age, with a median age of 36.0 years (range: 18 to 49). Of the participants, 48.3% were male, 51.0% 
were white, and 87.2% were not Hispanic or Latino. Randomization was stratified based on the 
presence and number of risk factors for pneumococcal disease. Differences between planned versus 
actual strata occurred at a low frequency. These were mainly due to mis-stratifications and are not 
considered to have impacted the overall study results.  
V114 was immunogenic in all studies and subgroups tested, as OPA GMTs at 30 days postvaccination 
were always higher compared to the OPA GMTs pre-vaccination. The non-inferiority margin of the 
lower bound of the 95% CI for the serotype-specific OPA GMT ratio [V114/PCV13] >0.5 was met for all 
13 shared serotypes as assessed by the serotype-specific OPA GMTs at 30 days postvaccination. In 
addition, in all studies, the superiority margin of the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the OPA 
GMT ratio [V114/ PCV13] to be greater than 2.0 was met for the 2 unique serotypes. The clinical 
relevance of meeting or not meeting both the non-inferiority margin or the superiority margin is 
unknown. Due to the lack of an established threshold value associated with clinical benefit, 
interpretation of the outcome is difficult. Nevertheless, a comparison to the main study for the 
authorization of PCV13 provides further reassurance. Titres induced by PCV13 showed a nearly 2-fold 
difference compared to PPV23, indicating that meeting the 0.5 NI margin employed for the comparison 
V114/PCV13 places V114 between two vaccines with known efficacy. Although uncertainties concerning 
the magnitude of the protective effect remain, the explanation is considered reassuring and additional 
data concerning (lack of) vaccine efficacy including break through disease will be collected post-
marketing.  
Healthy adults aged ≥50 years and older 
Three studies included healthy adults aged ≥50 years and older: the pivotal study V114-019 and the 
supportive studies V114-016 and V114-020. In these three studies, similar trends were observed for 
OPA GMT ratios of V114/PCV13 at 30 days postvaccination, indicating that the effect of V114 is robust, 
leading to consistent immune responses to the different serotypes across studies in similar 
populations. This was also reflected by the fact that trends seen for OPA GMTs are also seen for IgG 
GMCs.

It is noteworthy that for the pivotal study V114-019, although non-inferiority was met for all shared 
serotypes, the GMT ratios [V114/PCV13] appear to be shifted to the left, indicating a somewhat 
reduced immune response to V114 compared to PCV13 in this study. For study V114-019, the upper 
bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the GMT ratio did not contain 1.00 for 7 of the shared serotypes, while 
this was the case for only 1 serotype in both studies V114-016 and V114-020. The applicant discussed 
the apparent reduced immune response in the pivotal study V114-019 compared to the responses seen 
in the supportive studies V114-016 and V114-020. The applicant did not identify any particular factor 
to explain these differences. Differences may be due to study-to-study variability as a result of slightly 
different enrolled populations, variability of the clinical assays, and/or observed variability in antibody 
titres between individuals. However, considering all the immunogenicity information obtained during 
study V114-019, the immune response elicited by V114 was still substantial with the majority of 
participants having a ≥4-fold rise in OPA GMT, with proportions being 52.2% to 81.2% in the V114 
group compared to 58.7% to 84.8% in the PCV13 group for 13 shared serotypes. In addition, the 
change from baseline in immunogenicity response is largely comparable between the studies. Finally, 
reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDC) also show similar distributions. 
A reduction in response to serotype 4 in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group and an 
increased response to serotype 3 and 6B was seen during the pivotal study V114-019 in healthy adults 
aged ≥50 years and older. Similar observations were made during studies V114-016 and V114-020. 
The reduction in serotype 4 response is considered not clinically relevant, as the percentage of 
participants with a ≥4-fold rise in OPA GMTs was still substantial (≥79%), and the difference in the 
percentage of responders (≥4-fold rise) in the V114 and PCV13 group was relatively small, <10%, in 
all three studies. In addition, RCDC for serotype 4 showed that the distribution is similar between V114 
and PCV13.  
Both V114 and PCV13 were immunogenic in the different age groups of 50 to 64 years of age, 65 to 
74 years of age and ≥75 years of age. In general, as expected, trends toward lower serotype-specific 
OPA GMTs at Day 30 postvaccination can be seen with increasing age. During study V114-019, the 
≥75-year-old subgroup in the PCV13 treatment arm seems to have a stronger immune response 
compared to the 65 to 74-year-old group, which is most probably due to the low number of subjects in 
the ≥75-year-old group (n=67) compared to the 65 to 74-year-old group (n=344). 
For the 2 unique serotypes not present in PCV13, the OPA GMTs at Day 30, GMFR and proportions of 
participants with a ≥4-fold rise in serotype-specific OPA responses from Day 1 to Day 30 were higher 
in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group. This also holds true for the different age groups. 
These results indicate that 2 µg/dose is sufficient to elicit an immune response for the 2 unique 
serotypes in healthy adults ≥50 years of age.  
Adults aged 18 to 49 years with or without risk factors for pneumococcal disease 
In adults aged 18 to 49 years with or without risk factors for pneumococcal disease, the immune 
response elicited by V114 is robust as indicated by serotype-specific OPA GMT results being consistent 
with serotype-specific IgG GMC results and the analysis performed using the FAS population providing 
similar results to the analysis performed on the PP population. 
Both V114 and PCV13 elicited an immune response in immunocompetent adults with or without risk 
factors for pneumococcal disease. However, for 4 of the shared serotypes, serotype 4, 5, 7F and 9V, 
the response seems lower in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group. For both serotype 4 and 5 
≥79.0% of subjects achieved a 4-fold rise in OPA GMT in the V114 group, indicating that the response 
to V114 is still robust, with the majority of participants achieving a 4-fold rise in GMT. For serotype 7F 
and 9V in both treatment groups, the proportion of subjects achieving a 4-fold rise in OPA GMT was 
lower, ≥51.5% in the V114 group vs ≥ 55.4% in the PCV13 group. OPA GMTs at Day 30 were high in 
the V114 group for these serotypes, with 5756.4 for serotype 7F and 3355.1 for serotype 9V. This is 
Assessment report  
EMA/620380/2021 
Page 71/109 
 
 
 
lower than the response against these serotypes in the PCV13 group (GMT 7588.9 and 3983.7 for 
serotype 7F and 9V, respectively). In conclusion, considering all the immunogenicity information, even 
though the OPA GMT ratio was slightly lower for 4 of the 13 shared serotypes, the immune response 
elicited by V114 was still substantial, with the majority of participants having a ≥4-fold rise in OPA 
GMT and RCDC curves that show similar distributions. 
For 3 serotypes, serotype 3, 6B and 18C, the response in the V114 group was higher compared to 
PCV13 group. This is especially noteworthy for serotype 3, as the response to serotype 3 is low in the 
PCV13 group, with OPA GMTs at 30 days postvaccination of 155.9 compared to 199.2 in the V114 
group, and serotype 3 still being one of the most common serotypes causing disease in adults. The 
OPA GMTs generated using PCV13 in these studies are comparable to the OPA GMTs generated during 
the studies included in the MA application for PCV13 [EPAR]. In addition, for the 2 unique serotypes, 
the OPA GMT ratios were, as expected, higher in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group. 
Overall, V114 is shown to be immunogenic in participants without risk factors for pneumococcal 
disease, in participants with a single risk factor and participants with 2 or more risk factors.  
Persistence of Immune Response 
Serotype-specific OPA GMTs declined over time from Day 30 to Month 6/12 (depending on the study) 
but remained above baseline levels for all the serotypes contained in either V114 or PCV13. IgG GMCs 
show a similar trend. As OPA GMTs are generally comparable between V114 and PCV13 at Month 6 or 
Month 12, these results indicate that the persistence of the response after vaccination with either V114 
or PCV13 is comparable. Long-term persistence of the immune response has, however, not been 
investigated; thus, there is no information on long-term protection by V114. In addition, no data is 
available concerning a potential booster vaccination of V114. The lack of information on long-term 
protection/immunogenicity and the need for a booster dose are reflected in the SmPC.  
Subsequent Vaccination 
The PPV23 vaccination at Month 6, following either vaccination with V114 or PCV13 at Day 1, was able 
to elicit an immune response for all 15 serotypes as assessed by serotype-specific OPA GMTs at 30 
days postvaccination with PPV23 (Month 7). Vaccination with PPV23 at 6 months after vaccination with 
either V114 or PCV13 induced serotype-specific OPA GMTs at Month 7 comparable in both treatment 
groups. Similar results were obtained when vaccinating with PPV23 at 12 months after vaccination with 
either V114 or PCV13: PPV23 elicited an immune response for all 15 serotypes comparable in both 
treatment groups.  
GMFRs and proportions of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in OPA titres were higher between Day 1 and 
Day 30 than the levels observed after the second vaccination, which is partly due to the fact that the 
levels of OPA GMTs are higher at Month 6 or Month 12 compared to Day 1. For pneumococcal vaccines 
it is known that GMTs after the second dose are generally lower than after the first dose (Greenberg et 
al. Vaccine 2014). This phenomenon was also observed in adults previously vaccinated with PPV23 
(included in study V114-007 and V114-021). Overall, the results in participants previously vaccinated 
with PPV23 were comparable between V114 and PCV13 for the shared serotypes included in study 
V114-007 and V114-021, however, they are lower compared to the results obtained in vaccine naïve 
subjects studied in study V114-019. 
HIV-infected subjects 
In total, 302 HIV-infected subjects received a single dose of either V114 or PCV13 on Day 1, followed 
by a single dose of PPV23 at Week 8. The median age was 41.0 years (range: 21-74). The participants 
included in the study all received antiretroviral therapy, and the majority did not have a detectable 
viral load and had a CD4 count >200 cells/µL. As already stated in the scientific advice, patients with 
Assessment report

Page 72/109 
 
 
 
HIV and a CD4+ T-cell count >200 cannot be considered as severely immunocompromised. This should 
be accurately reflected in the SmPC. 
Both interventions, V114 and PCV13, were immunogenic, and the induced immune responses were 
generally comparable between the intervention groups. A stronger response for serotype 3 and 18C 
was seen in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group, while the immune response for serotype 4 
was lower. As expected, responses for the 2 unique serotypes were higher in the V114 group. Similar 
results were observed when looking at the IgG GMCs. No notable differences were observed between 
CD4+ T-cell count subgroups (≥200 to <500 cells/µL, ≥500 cells/µL) in either OPA GMTs or IgG GMCs 
30 days postvaccination. The results are generally lower compared to study V114-017, including adults 
aged 18 to 49 years old. 
Following vaccination with PPV23, an immune response was elicited as measured by OPA GMTs and 
IgG GMCs at Week 12.  
Previously vaccinated subjects 
Overall, during Study V114-007 performed in adults previously vaccinated with PPV23, immune 
response was comparable between both treatment arms for the 13 shared serotypes and higher for 
both unique serotypes in the V114 arm. Although the results were comparable between V114 and 
PCV13, they are lower compared to vaccine naïve subjects studied in study V114-019. This was also 
observed in subgroup analyses in the supportive study V114-021. Since this is also observed for PCV13 
in both studies and it is a known phenomenon for pneumococcal vaccinations, no concerns are raised.  
Subgroup analyses 
Slight differences in immune response could be observed between the subgroups in sex, race and 
ethnicity; however, no clear trends were observed.  
All in all, the differences observed between subgroups are small and considered not to impact the use 
of V114 in these subpopulations. 
Concomitant administration of influenza vaccine 
Regarding co-administration of an inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV), the data suggest 
that concomitant administration of V114 does not affect the immunogenicity of the influenza vaccine, 
as strain-specific HAI GMTs at 30 days postvaccination with QIV were comparable in groups where QIV 
was administered concomitantly and non-concomitantly with V114. However, the immune response 
induced by V114 was generally reduced when both vaccines were administered concomitantly. 
Interaction between influenza vaccines and pneumococcal vaccines are a known phenomenon 
(Schwartz et al. 2011). Consistently lower immune responses were observed in several studies after 
concomitant administration of PCV13 with inactivated influenza vaccine compared to PCV13 
administered alone. However, the proportion of OPA responders after PCV13 and TIV co-administration 
was similar to that observed after PCV13 alone for all serotypes evaluated (Schwarz et al., Vaccine 
2013). This is in line with the results of study V114-021. Serotype specific GMFRs and proportions of 
participants with a ≥4-fold rise from prevaccination to 30 days postvaccination for OPA responses were 
generally comparable between the 2 groups. In addition, effectiveness studies of the concomitant use 
of PPV23 and the influenza vaccine support the coadministration of both vaccines to prevent 
pneumonia, death, and hospitalizations during the influenza season. Together these results indicate 
that although no firm conclusion can be drawn on the impact of the observed reduction in V114-
induced immune response after concomitant QIV administration on the efficacy of V114, it seems 
unlikely that efficacy will be reduced. No data is available for the concomitant vaccination of V114 with 
adjuvanted and high dose quadrivalent influenza vaccines.   
Assessment report  
EMA/620380/2021 
Page 73/109 
 
 
 
Overall, as the immunological response to V114 is comparable to the immunological response to 
PCV13, it is considered reasonable to conclude that V114 could protect against pneumococcal disease. 
Some differences, such as the lower response to serotype 4, between the V114 and PCV13 induced 
immune responses have been observed. However, it is unknown to what extent these differences may 
impact on the protection against invasive pneumococcal disease, as clinical efficacy has not been 
demonstrated for V114. For the two unique serotypes contained in the V114 vaccine, no efficacy has 
been shown and immunogenicity cannot be bridged to PCV13, even though V114 was shown to induce 
a robust immune response towards these additional serotypes. In a Phase 2 study (Ermlich et al., 
Vaccine 2018), using an earlier formulation, V114 induced OPA and IgG responses against 22F and 33F 
that were generally higher or comparable to those induced by PPVS23 with proven efficacy. 
Epidemiological surveillance will be necessary to ensure early detection of breakthrough disease 
caused by potential vaccine failure or reduced vaccine effectiveness. In addition, next to breakthrough 
disease, serotype replacement should be included in surveillance studies. The applicant commits to 
discuss these topics in the yearly PSURs within the context of routine pharmacovigilance. The 
information provided will include: post-marketing spontaneous reports on breakthrough 
disease/vaccine failure, efficacy/effectiveness studies and publications on V114 use in adults and new 
data for serotype distribution from IPD surveillance from countries (US and EU) where V114 is used in 
adults as these data become available.  
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the results indicate that V114 is immunogenic in all subgroups tested, with the immune 
response being consistent across studies. Of note, and similar to other pneumococcal vaccines, no 
correlate of protection has been identified for pneumococcal disease, and immunogenicity observed 
cannot be directly translated to efficacy.  
As expected, a trend towards a lower immune response is seen with increasing age. In general, the 
immune response to V114 is similar compared to the immune response generated by PCV13.  
2.5.8.  Clinical safety 
The discussion of clinical safety is based on available safety data from 7 clinical studies: 1 Phase 2 
study (V114-007) and 6 Phase 3 studies (V114-016, -017, -018, -019, -020 and -021).  
Safety data were integrated across 3 Phase 3 studies in pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults ≥50 years 
of age (V114-016, V114-019, and V114-020), with the aim to increase precision for characterizing the 
safety profile of V114 among healthy pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults 50 years of age or older. In 
addition, safety data collected in immunocompetent adults 18 to 49 years of age with or without risk 
factors for pneumococcal disease (V114-017) is presented.  
The section on special populations describes the following special populations: immunocompromised 
adults ≥18 years of age infected with HIV-1 (V114-018), adults ≥65 years of age who previously 
received PPV23 (V114-007), and adults ≥50 years of age administered PCV concomitantly with an 
inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (V114-021). 
Approximately 3,000 participants for the V114 group and approximately 1,100 participants for the 
PCV13 group are included in the integrated summary of safety (ISS).  
Summaries of pooled data include point estimates based on the “naïve pooling” (the total number of 
participants with a certain event across the 3 studies as the numerator and the total number of 
participants in the population across the 3 studies as the denominator) and between group 
comparisons (risk differences and associated 95% confidence intervals for pre-specified endpoints)

calculated via weighted risk differences i.e. stratified Miettinen and Nurminen (M&N) method using 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) weights. The justification for the weighted approach for risk 
differences is to maintain the balance afforded by the randomization within each study for the purpose 
of between group comparisons. The naïve pooling approach for between group comparisons would be 
subject to Simpson’s Paradox, a bias that causes over- or under-estimates of the vaccination effect (or 
even a complete reversal of the direction of the effect). Simpson’s Paradox can be particularly 
impactful when the randomization ratios across integrated studies is vastly different. Given that the 
randomization ratio for V114-020 (9:1) differs from that of the other studies (1:1), a weighted 
approach is preferable in this setting to the naïve pooling approach. The naïve pooling analyses were 
however submitted in parallel to the weighted analyses within the ‘Integrated Summary of Safety’ for 
completeness. 
2.5.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The 7 studies contributing to the evaluation of safety, enrolled a diverse population of over 7,400 
adults across more than 260 clinical study sites in 18 countries. V114 is given as a single IM dose. 
In total, 5,630 adults received V114 in these studies, and 1,808 received an active comparator 
(PCV13). The extent of exposure in the different studies is presented in Table 19. Out of 2,666 
participants 65 to 74 years of age, 1999 received V114. Out of 646 participants 75 years of age and 
older, 479 participants received V114, see Table 20.

2.5.8.2.  Adverse events 
Clinical safety profile evaluation 
Solicited injection site AEs were injection site erythema, injection site pain and injection site swelling. 
Solicited systemic AEs were arthralgia, fatigue, headache and myalgia.  
The methods used for safety evaluation were consistent across all studies in the V114 clinical 
programme. The evaluation of safety included both (1) AEs assessed by the investigator and (2) 
complaints reported directly by the participant. The primary mechanism for reporting adverse events 
was an electronic Vaccination Report Card (eVRC). Complaints were reported by participants on the 
eVRC and later reviewed by the investigator via telephone contact 14 days later. The study investigator 
reviewed the data with the participant and reported events meeting the protocol-specified AE definition 
in the clinical database. Investigators also assessed the causal relationship to the study vaccine, 
intensity, toxicity, and seriousness of each identified AE. Differences between complaints reported on 
the eVRC/VRC and AEs reported in the clinical database could occur for a variety of reasons (complaint 
that is a symptom of a documented pre-existing condition that did not worsen following vaccination, 
complaint was a sign or symptom of a separate event or diagnosis, the complaint could be more 
accurately characterised as a different AE upon investigator review (e.g., a solicited complaint of 
‘muscle pain’ may be assessed by the investigator as ‘injection site pain’ and not ‘myalgia’ due to 
proximity to the injection site). These reasons were not pre-specified, however. 
All safety analyses were performed in the APaT population, defined as all randomised participants who 
received study intervention (vaccination with V114 or PCV13). The analyses were based on the study 
intervention that participants actually received.  
Pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults ≥50 years of age (V114-016, V114-019 and V114-020) 
In both intervention groups, the majority of participants experienced 1 or more AEs, and 1 or more 
vaccine-related AE, see Table 21.

Between-group comparisons were generally consistent between participant-recorded solicited 
complaints and investigator-assessed AEs, some systemic events (e.g., myalgia) were reported more 
frequently by the participant than assessed as AEs by the investigator. 
Pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults 18-49 years of age with and without risk factors (V114-017)

Pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults ≥50 years of age (V114-016, V114-019 and V114-020) 
In both intervention groups, the majority of participants experienced 1 or more solicited AEs, see Table 
24. Injection site pain was the most frequently reported solicited AE, followed by fatigue and myalgia.  
A higher proportion of participants with solicited AEs was observed in the V114 group compared with 
the PCV13 group, which was mainly due to a higher proportion of participants with solicited AEs of 
injection site pain (difference >10%). 
Of the participants with solicited AEs, the majority had events mild in intensity, with toxicity of Grade 1 
and a size ≤2.4 cm. Of participants with solicited events, the majority had events of short duration 
(≤3 days). The proportions of participants with solicited AEs by maximum intensity, toxicity, size and 
duration were low and generally comparable across intervention groups.

Pooled analysis across all 7 studies 
Results from pooled analyses across the 7 studies included in the Summary of Clinical Safety (V114-

conclusions of the separate analyses. 
Solicited injection site and systemic AEs (independent of investigator-determined causality) are 
presented graphically in Figure 6 and Figure 7, respectively for each of the individual studies. V114-
021 is not included in these plots as this study did not include a PCV13 intervention group. In general, 
V114 is slightly more reactogenic compared to PCV13. In addition, higher incidence of injection site 
pain and myalgia related to the study vaccine was consistently observed with V114 throughout the 
studies.

Related adverse events 
Pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults ≥50 years of age (V114-016, V114-019 and V114-020) 
The incidence of vaccine-related AEs was 68.0% in the V114 group and 57.7% in the PCV13 group 
(Table 21).  
All injection site AEs were considered vaccine-related and occurred in 2,050 participants (63.7%) in 
the V114 group and 582 (51.4%) in the PCV13 group. The most frequently reported (≥1%) injection 
site AEs following V114 vaccination were injection site pain, injection site swelling, injection site 
erythema, and injection site pruritus. 
Vaccine-related systemic AEs were experienced by 1196 (34.6%) of participants in the V114 group and 
321 (29.2%) of participants in the PCV13 group. The most frequently reported (≥1%) vaccine-related 
systemic AEs were the 4 solicited systemic AEs, myalgia, fatigue, headache, arthralgia, in both 
intervention groups. 
Pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults 18-49 years of age with and without risk factors (V114-017) 
The incidence of vaccine-related AEs was 81.6% in the V114 group and 77.5% in the PCV13 group 
(Table 22).  
All injection site AEs were considered vaccine-related and occurred in 893 participants (78.7%) in the 
V114 group and 272 (72.0%) in the PCV13 group. The most frequently reported (≥1%) injection site 
AEs following V114 vaccination were injection site pain, injection site swelling, injection site erythema, 
injection site pruritus and injection site warmth. 
Vaccine-related systemic AEs were experienced by 555 (48.9%) of participants in the V114 group and 
176 (46.6%) of participants in the PCV13 group. The most frequently reported (≥1%) vaccine-related 
systemic AEs following V114 vaccination were fatigue, myalgia, headache, arthralgia, nausea and 
pyrexia. This was similar in the PCV13 group, except for nausea which occurred in 0.8% of 
participants. 
2.5.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In each of the 7 studies in the V114 clinical programme to support licensure, the proportion of 
participants with SAEs following PCV vaccination was low and comparable across intervention groups, 
see Table 28. None of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to V114 and the 
SAEs experienced were in line with expectation considering the elderly population enrolled. The SAEs 
occurred in similar SOCs in both intervention groups, with the most commonly reported SAEs being 
experienced in the SOCs of infections and infestations (33 subjects (0.6%) in the V114 group and 9 
(0.5%) in the PCV13 group), cardiac disorders (20 subjects (0.4%) in the V114 group and 6 (0.4%) in 
the PCV13 group) and neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (18 subjects (0.3%) in the V114 
group and 10 (0.6%) in the PCV13 group). More information is presented in the clinical assessment 
report.

2 intervention groups: V114 concomitant with QIV or non-concomitant 
In total, 11 participants died during the safety follow-up period across the 7 studies. An additional 
2 participants died outside of the protocol-specified reporting period (studies -017 and -021), both 
following vaccination with V114. All deaths occurred more than 40 days following vaccination with PCV. 
None of the deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to the study vaccine. More 
information is presented in the clinical assessment report. 
2.5.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Laboratory safety tests were not collected, except in the study 018 conducted in the HIV patients, 
where CD4+ T-cell count was measured.  
Mean change in CD4+ T-cell count 
The mean change from baseline (at screening) in CD4+ T-cell count at Day 30 and Week 12 was small 
(<15 cells/μL) in both intervention groups.  
Table 29 Mean change in CD4+ T-cell count from baseline over time (all participant as 
Treated Population) 
The proportion of participants with undetectable plasma HIV RNA (i.e., <20 copies/mL [LLOD] using a 
real time PCR) was similar (approximately 80%) at screening, Day 30, and Week 12 within each 
intervention group.

Table 30 Proportion of participants with undetectable HIV RNA viral load over time (all 
participant as Treated Population) 
No clinically meaningful change in CD4+ T-cell count or plasma HIV RNA was observed from baseline 
to postvaccination and no AEs associated with these parameters were reported. No concern arises 
based on the review of the laboratory data collected in study -018. 
Vital Signs, Physical Examinations and Other Observations Related to Safety 
With the exception of solicited body temperature measurements, no vital signs or physical 
assessments were documented in the clinical database during the studies.  
Solicited Body Temperature Measurements 
Among participants ≥50 years of age (V114-016, V114-019, V114-020) nearly all reported a maximum 
body temperature of <100.4°F (38.0°C) in both intervention groups. The proportions of participants 
with maximum body temperature measurements based on the Brighton Collaboration cut points were 
generally comparable across the intervention groups. Temperatures ≥105.8°F (41.0°C) after PCV 
vaccination were reported by 4 participants (3 of whom in the V114 group and 1 in the PCV13 group). 
These measurements were suspected by the investigator to be erroneous based on review of additional 
clinical information and that no AEs of body temperature increased or pyrexia were reported for these 
participants. In each case, the elevated temperature was reported once via an eVRC, with all 
remaining postvaccination temperatures considered to be within the normal range (except for 1 
participant who did not report any other postvaccination temperatures). 
During study V114-017, only a low number of subjects reported increased body temperatures with no 
notable differences between vaccine groups. Following V114 vaccination 2 subjects showed a body 
temperature between 39.5 and 40.0°C. Following PPV23 vaccination, 2 participants in the V114 group 
and 1 participant in the PCV13 group showed a body temperature between 39.0 and 40.5°C. 
2.5.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Age 
The safety profile observed for each age subgroup (50 to 64, 65 to 74, and ≥75 years of age) for all 
(see Table 31) and solicited AEs were generally consistent with those observed in the overall 
population, see Table 21. In both intervention groups, the majority of participants experienced 1 or 
more AEs. In all age groups, injection site pain was the most frequently reported solicited AE, followed 
by fatigue and myalgia. 
Reactogenicity decreased with age regardless of the intervention group.

Table 31 Summary of AEs in adults ≥50 years by age group – APaT population 
Data source: Mod 2.7.4/Tab 16 
A separate analysis was performed to subdivide types of AE per age category, see Table 32. In 
general, older adults reported fewer AEs than younger adults regardless of the intervention group. It 
was not possible to draw meaningful conclusions for the ≥85 years of age category due to the small 
number of participants.  
In Study V114-016, 3 participants discontinued study intervention (i.e., did not receive PPV23 at 
Month 12) due to AEs. Two of the participants (64 year old, 75 year old) were in the V114 group and 
both discontinued study vaccine due to nonserious, vaccine-related AEs, and 1 participant (57 year 
old) was in the PCV13 group and discontinued study vaccine due to a serious, nonvaccine-related AE. 
No new safety concerns were identified.

Table 32 AEs per age category – ApaT (V114-016, V114-019 and V114-020) 
HIV-1 infected subjects 
The safety of V114 was evaluated in study V114-018 in which 302 HIV-1 infected subjects received 
either V114 or PCV13 followed by PPV23 8 weeks later. The participants included in the study all 
received antiretroviral therapy, and the vast majority did not have a detectable viral load and had a 
CD4 count ≥200 cells/µL. This indicates that the participants still had a functioning immune system. 
In both intervention groups, the majority of participants experienced 1 or more AEs, see Table 33. The 
majority of participants in both groups experienced solicited injection site AEs, of which injection site 
pain was most frequently experienced. Fatigue was the most commonly reported systemic AE in both 
groups. The majority of solicited AEs were of short duration (≤3 days). The most commonly 
experienced related AEs were solicited AEs in both intervention groups. The majority of AEs were mild 
with a toxicity of Grade 1 or 2. Of the injection site AEs of erythema and swelling, the majority had 
events with a size ≤2.4 cm in both intervention groups. Overall, the safety profile in HIV infected 
individuals is similar to the safety profile in immunocompetent adults, and no new safety signals are 
observed.

Table 33 Summary of AEs in HIV-infected participants – APaT population 
V114 was well tolerated in participants with CD4+ T-cell count ≥500 cells/µL and participants with 
CD4+ T-cell count ≥200 to <500 cells/µL, with safety results that were generally consistent with those 
observed in the overall population of Study V114-018. Few (n=4) participants had CD4+ T-cell count 
≥50 to <200 cells/µL. 
No laboratory associated AEs were reported. There were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline 
in CD4+ T-cell count and plasma HIV RNA 30 days postvaccination with V114.  
Prior pneumococcal vaccination 
Study V114-007 was performed to compare the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of V114 and 
PCV13 in healthy adults aged ≥65 years who were vaccinated previously with PPV23 at least 1 year 
prior to study entry. 
The safety results (see Table 34) were generally consistent with those observed in pneumococcal 
vaccine-naïve adults ≥50 years of age (see Table 21), with the majority of participants in both 
intervention groups experiencing 1 or more AEs.

Table  34  Analysis  of  AE  summary  in  participants  with  prior  exposure  to  PPV23  –  APaT 
population 
As in the pneumococcal naïve elderly population, the proportion of participants with injection site AEs 
was higher following vaccination of V114 compared with PCV13, which was mainly due to higher 
proportions of participants with solicited injection site pain in the V114 group. These differences were 
not considered clinically meaningful, as the majority of the AEs were transient and mild in intensity.  
The proportions of participants with solicited systemic AEs were generally comparable across 
intervention groups. 
Overall, the safety profile in the different subgroups of age, sex, race, ethnicity and time since PPV23 
receipt was comparable to the safety profile in the entire population and no new safety signals are 
observed. 
Overall, the safety profile in participants with prior exposure to PPV23 was similar to the safety profile 
in the pneumococcal vaccine naïve population and no new safety signals are observed. 
Pregnancy 
Pregnant participants were excluded from studies in the clinical development programme. However, a 
total of 14 participants (10 in the V114 group and 4 in the PCV13 group) reported 15 pregnancies (10 
in the V114 group and 5 in the PCV13 group), all in Study V114-017. All participants were vaccinated 
prior to conception. In the V114 group, 4 of the 10 participants were vaccinated within 6 weeks prior 
to conception, while for the other 6 conceptions occurred after 6 weeks postvaccination. Pregnancy 
outcomes included 8 live births, 1 spontaneous abortion, and 1 elective abortion in the V114 group. Of 
the known infant outcomes, no congenital or other abnormalities were reported.

The effect of V114 on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion was not evaluated; no data 
regarding exposure during breastfeeding are available. 
Sex, Race and Ethnicity 
Safety results observed in the integrated population in the different subgroups were generally 
consistent with those observed in the overall population. Male participants generally reported fewer 
AEs than female participants regardless of the intervention group. A trend towards higher 
reactogenicity in White subjects was observed for both intervention groups. For HIV-infected 
participants, a trend towards higher reactogenicity was observed among participants who were 
multiple-race compared with participants who were Asian, Black or African American, or White for both 
intervention groups. In addition, higher proportions of participants with solicited AEs were observed 
among participants who were Hispanic or Latino compared with participants who were Not Hispanic or 
Latino in both intervention groups. These differences were not considered clinically meaningful, as 
majority of the AEs were transient and mild in intensity. 
2.5.8.6.  Immunological events 
The goal of vaccination is to induce antibodies; which represents the pharmacodynamics effect of the 
vaccine. Results are presented in the efficacy section. 
2.5.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Concomitant influenza vaccine 
V114 was well tolerated when concomitantly administered with QIV in adults ≥50 years of age, with 
safety results consistent with those of V114 in pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults ≥50 years of age, 
see Table 35.  
The proportions of participants with AEs, injection site AEs, systemic AEs, and vaccine-related systemic 
AEs were generally comparable across concomitant and non-concomitant intervention groups. The 
proportion of participants who experienced SAEs was low, with 6 participants in the concomitant group 
(1.0%) and 12 participants in the non- concomitant group (2.1%) experiencing SAEs following V114 
injection with or without QIV. None of the SAEs were considered to be vaccine-related by the 
investigator. Over the duration of the study, 1 participant died, and 3 participants discontinued study 
intervention due to AEs.  
A trend toward lower proportions of participants with AEs was observed in older age groups (65 to 74 
and ≥75 years of age) compared with the younger age group (50 to 64 years of age) across both 
intervention groups (concomitant vs. non-concomitant), in particular with regard to injection site 
reactions. Higher incidences of AEs were observed for female participants in both the concomitant and 
non-concomitant group. Lower proportions of participants with solicited AEs were observed among 
participants who were Hispanic or Latino compared with participants who were Not Hispanic or Latino 
across both intervention groups. The safety profile was generally comparable across intervention 
groups within each race subgroup and prior PPV23 administration. 
Overall, the safety profile in participants who were vaccinated concomitantly with QIV was similar to 
the safety profile in the non-concomitantly vaccinated participants, and no new safety signals are 
observed.

Sequential PPV vaccine 
Study V114-016 evaluated the safety and tolerability of sequential administration of PPV23 
administered 12 months following V114 or PCV13. This sequential regimen was well tolerated in adults 
≥50 years of age, and the proportions of participants with AEs, injection site AEs, systemic AEs, and 
vaccine-related systemic AEs were generally comparable across intervention groups, see Table 36. The 
proportions of participants who experienced SAEs were low and comparable across intervention 
groups, and none of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to the study vaccine. 
No participant died during the study.

Table 36: Analysis of AE summary following PPV23 in Study V114-016 – APaT population 
Similar results were obtained in the study V114-017, in which healthy adults 18-49 year with and 
without risk factors for pneumococcal disease were exposed to PPV23 6 months after primary 
vaccination with either V114 or PCV13 and in study V114-018, in which HIV-positive participants were 
exposed to PPV23, 2 months after primary vaccination with either V114 or PCV13. 
2.5.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In total, 9 participants had AEs leading to study vaccine discontinuation during the protocol specified 
reporting period across V114-016, V114-017, V114-018, and V114-021, 8 of 2799 (0.3%) participants 
who received V114 across and 1 of 852 (0.1%) participants who received PCV13.  
Five of the 9 AEs leading to study discontinuation were serious and non-vaccine related: 1 each for 
squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx, colon cancer, nephrotic syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and cerebrovascular accident.  
Four of the 9 AEs leading to study discontinuation were non-serious, but vaccine related. These were 
vertigo, injection site pain, sinusitis, and a combination of abdominal pain upper, fatigue, nausea, 
arthralgia, rhinorrhoea, and myalgia. 
2.5.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing experience is available. V114 is not marketed anywhere in the world.

2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety of V114 was evaluated in 7 clinical trials in which in total, 5,630 adults received 
V114 and 1,808 adults received PCV13. The active comparator PCV13 was included in 6 of the 7 
studies (V114-007, V114-016, V114-017, V114-018, V114-019 and V114-020), while 1 study 
compared V114 when given concomitantly or non-concomitantly with the influenza vaccine QIV (V114-
021). 
The chosen comparator, PCV13, is acceptable from a safety perspective. PCV13 is the only PCV 
licensed for use in adults. V114 contains the same 13 serotypes included in PCV13 (plus two additional 
serotypes 22F and 33F) and the same carrier protein diphtheria toxoid CRM197 is used. 
One study in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients was ongoing and remained blinded at 
the time of MA submission (study V114-022). The eDMC continues to monitor the unblinded safety 
data and have not recommended any changes to study conduct based on their reviews. One vaccine-
related SAE occurred so far (immune thrombocytopenia) following the second vaccination. 
An integrated safety analysis was performed for 3 studies, including healthy adults ≥50 years of age: 
V114-016, V114-019 and V114-020. Safety results obtained from the other studies were analysed 
separately. A weighted approach to the analysis was used due to heterogeneity of event rates and 
different randomisation ratios across studies, which is acceptable. A higher incidence of AEs was seen 
in study V114-020, which may be attributable to an increased AE reporting prompted by anticipation of 
receiving an investigational vaccine as no other factors that would explain heterogeneity in event rates 
were identified. Of note, the naïve pooling results were also presented by the applicant and assessed in 
parallel. 
Next to the integrated safety analysis presented by the applicant, a pooled safety analysis including all 
7 clinical studies, including participants from studies V114-007, -017, -018 as well as those 
participants from study -021 without concomitant QIV vaccination (following PCV vaccination), was 
provided. The results of the new analysis confirmed the previous findings, and no new safety signals 
were identified. 
Safety data collection strategy 
All participants were observed for at least 30 minutes after administration of study intervention for any 
immediate reactions. The need for appropriate medical treatment and supervision to be readily 
available following administration of the vaccine is included in the SmPC. 
Reactogenicity was followed for 5 days when concerning local injection site reactions and for 14 days 
for systemic reactions, which is considered appropriate (see Guideline on clinical evaluation of 
vaccines). Non-serious, unsolicited AEs were followed for 14 days while SAEs were collected up to 6 
months (except for study V114-007 where follow-up was limited to 30 days). This strategy was agreed 
by CHMP and led to a sufficient period of time to collect information on the outcome of the adverse 
events. 
The primary mechanism for reporting adverse events was an electronic Vaccination Report Card 
(eVRC). Complaints were reported by participants on the eVRC and later reviewed by the investigator 
via telephone contact 14 days later. Overall, the safety data collection strategy is considered adequate. 
As safety reporting could be influenced by unblinding, as V114 and Prevenar 13 differ in appearance, 
the applicant was asked to fully describe blinding. The unblinded pharmacist or designee was 
instructed to ask the participant to turn their head away from the vaccination until the empty syringe 
and needle were discarded as biohazardous waste in a manner that did not allow them to be seen by 
any blinded individual.

Exposure  
In the overall safety database, 5,630 participants received V114, of which 4,389 were ≥50 years. In 
total 1,241 participants receiving V114 were 18 to 49-year-old, 377 had previous exposure to a 
pneumococcal vaccine, 152 were HIV-positive (107 were 18-49 years of age and 45 were ≥50 years), 
and 1,185 either received V114 concomitantly with QIV or non-concomitantly. The size and 
composition of the safety database is considered sufficient for the assessment of the safety profile of 
V114. However, the size of the safety database limits the detection of more rare adverse events. 
Information on rare but serious AEs should be systematically collected post-licensure. However, the 
exact number of participants exposed to V114 is unclear.  
The demographic characteristics of participants in the 7 clinical studies were generally comparable 
across intervention groups with respect to age and gender. Overall, the population enrolled across all 
studies is considered sufficiently representative of the target population (adults 18 years of age and 
older). 
Solicited Adverse Events 
In healthy adults ≥50 years of age, 68.9% of participants in the V114 group experienced 1 or more 
solicited AEs compared to 58.2% in the PCV13 group. Injection site solicited AEs were reported in a 
higher proportion of participants in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group, 62.6% vs 49.8%. 
This difference was mainly driven by a difference in injection site pain, which was reported by 58.2% in 
the V114 group and 45.1% in the PCV13 group. Most AEs were mild in intensity and of short duration. 
As AEs that were of maximum intensity or duration were comparable between the treatment arms, the 
above described differences are not considered clinically relevant. The proportion of participants 
experiencing solicited systemic events was generally comparable between the intervention groups, 
with 38.8% in the V114 group and 33.5% in the PCV13 group, with fatigue being most commonly 
reported in both intervention groups.  
In subjects 18 to 49 years old, 82.4% of participants in the V114 groups experienced 1 or more 
solicited AEs compared to 78.8% in the PCV13 group. In the V114 group, the proportion of subjects 
experiencing a solicited injection site AE was slightly higher than in the PCV13 group, 78.4% vs 72.0%, 
respectively. As with adults ≥50 years, the most frequently reported solicited injection site AE was 
injection site pain. The proportion of participants experiencing solicited systemic events were 
comparable between the intervention groups, with 55.3% in the V114 group and 55.0% in the PCV13 
group experiencing a systemic AE. As with adults ≥50 years, the most frequently reported solicited 
systemic AEs was fatigue, with 34.3% in the V114 group and 36.8% in the PCV13 group. 
Overall, only a low number of subjects reported increased body temperatures with no notable 
differences between vaccine groups. Among participants ≥50 years of age, temperatures ≥41.0°C 
were reported by 4 participants (3 of whom were in the V114 group and 1 in the PCV13 group). These 
measurements were suspected by the investigator to be erroneous based on review of additional 
clinical information and that no AEs of body temperature increased or pyrexia were reported for these 
participants. In each case, the elevated temperature was reported once via an eVRC, with all 
remaining postvaccination temperatures considered to be within the normal range (except for 1 
participant who did not report any other postvaccination temperatures).  
Across studies, observations about AEs were consistent, with the majority of participants experiencing 
1 or more solicited AEs, and injection site pain being the most frequently reported solicited AE, 
followed by fatigue and myalgia. In addition, across all studies, most AEs were mild to moderate in 
intensity, with toxicity of Grade 1, a size of ≤5.0 cm and of short duration (≤3 days). The safety profile 
of V114 was generally comparable to PCV13, with slightly more V114-vaccinated subjects reporting 
solicited AEs (mainly driven by injection site reactions).

EMA/620380/2021 
Page 95/109 
 
 
 
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
Unsolicited AEs occurring ≥1.0% in both the adults ≥50 years of age and the 18 to 49-year-old 
population for V114 were injection site pruritus and nasopharyngitis, both occurring in ≤1.5% of 
participants in both age groups. In the 18 to 49-year-old population, some additional unsolicited AEs 
were reported by ≥1.0% in the V114 group: diarrhoea, nausea, chills, injection site warmth, pyrexia, 
upper respiratory tract infection, pain in extremity and oropharyngeal pain, which were all reported in 
<2.5% of participants. The occurrence of unsolicited AEs mostly appeared balanced between V114 and 
PCV13.  
Related Adverse Events 
The applicant considered all injection site AEs related, which is agreed with.  
The proportion of participants experiencing vaccine-related AEs was higher in the 18 to 49-year-old 
group; with 77.5% to 81.6% of participants experiencing vaccine-related AEs in the 18 to 49-year-old 
population versus 57.7% to 68.0% of participants in the ≥50-year-old population.  
There is a substantial (>10% point) difference in the proportion of participants experiencing a vaccine-
related AE in the ≥50-year-old population in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group, with 
68.0% of participants experiencing a vaccine-related AE in the V114 group compared to 57.7% of 
participants in the PCV13 group. As noted above, this difference is mainly due to the proportion of 
participants experiencing vaccine-related injection site related AEs, which is 63.7% in the V114 group 
versus 51.4% in the PCV13 group. 
In accordance with CHMP’s request, the applicant has added ‘rash’, ‘chills’, ‘vomiting’ and ‘nausea’ as 
adverse reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC, as these are known effects of protein conjugated 
polysaccharide vaccines and have been observed in the studies included in the application. In addition, 
the applicant has added ‘dizziness’, ‘injection site bruising/injection site haematoma’ (combined in 1 
term) and ‘injection site warmth’ to Section 4.8 of the SmPC in line with the CHMP’s request. Three 
potential Type I hypersensitivity AEs were identified that were vaccine-related according to the 
investigator. The applicant has included hypersensitivity reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC, as 
hypersensitivity is a known risk for vaccines and 3 hypersensitivity reactions were observed across the 
7 studies included in the safety analysis. None of the potential autoimmune events were related to the 
vaccine. The applicant is encouraged to continue to monitor autoimmune disorders via routine 
pharmacovigilance. 
Serious Adverse Events and Death 
The proportion of participants with SAEs in the 7 studies was below 6.0% in all studies and comparable 
between study interventions. The SAEs occurred in similar SOCs in both intervention groups, with the 
most commonly reported SAEs being experienced in the SOCs of infections and infestations (33 
subjects (0.6%) in the V114 group and 9 (0.5%) in the PCV13 group), cardiac disorders (20 subjects 
(0.4%) in the V114 group and 6 (0.4%) in the PCV13 group) and neoplasms benign, malignant and 
unspecified (18 subjects (0.3%) in the V114 group and 10 (0.6%) in the PCV13 group). None of the 
SAEs were related to the study interventions. 
Over the course of the 7 studies, 11 participants died. All deaths occurred over 40 days after 
vaccination with either V114 or PCV13, and none were related to the study interventions.  
Safety in special populations 
Age 
In total 3,032 participants of ≥50 years were included in the V114 group in the studies in the 
integrated safety analysis (V114-016, V114-019 and V114-020). The V114 group consisted of 1,282 
Assessment report  
EMA/620380/2021 
Page 96/109 
 
 
 
(42.3%) participants in the age of 50 to 64 year, 1435 (47.3%) participants in the age of 65 to 74 
year and 315 (10.4%) participants were ≥75 years. As expected, increasing age led to a decrease in 
reactogenicity. For the solicited AEs this decrease was especially seen for injection site pain. Even 
though reactogenicity decreased, the profile of AEs in the V114 group remained similar, with the most 
commonly reported injection site AE being injection site pain (69.4% in the 50 to 64-year-old 
population, 53.5% in the 65 to 74-year-old population and 39.5% in the ≥75-year-old population) and 
the most commonly reported systemic AEs being fatigue (25.9% in the 50 to 64-year-old population, 
15.9% in the 65 to 74-year-old population and 18.8% in the ≥75-year-old population) and myalgia 
(24.0% in the 50 to 64-year-old population, 17.1% in the 65 to 74-year-old population and 14.6% in 
the ≥75-year-old population). 
HIV-infected individuals 
The safety of V114 was evaluated in HIV-1 infected individuals in study V114-018, in which 302 HIV-1 
patients received either V114 or PCV13 followed by PPV23 8 weeks later. The participants included in 
the study all received antiretroviral therapy, and the majority did not have a detectable viral load and 
had a CD4 count >200 cells/µL. This indicates that the participants still had a functioning immune 
system. In both intervention groups, the majority of participants experienced 1 or more AEs, with 
73.0% of participants in the V114 group and 62.7% in the PCV13 group. The majority of participants in 
both groups experienced solicited injection site AEs (61.8% in the V114 group and 53.3% in the PCV13 
group), of which injection site pain was most frequently experienced, with 57.8% of participants in the 
V114 group and 51.3% in the PCV13 group. Fatigue was the most commonly reported systemic AE in 
both groups (20.4% in the V114 group vs 13.3% in the PCV13 group). The majority of solicited AEs 
were of short duration (≤3 days). The most commonly experienced related AEs were solicited AEs in 
both intervention groups. The majority of AEs were mild with a toxicity of Grade 1 or 2 and a size 
≤2.4 cm in both intervention groups. The proportions of participants with solicited AEs by maximum 
intensity, toxicity, size and duration were low and generally comparable across intervention groups. 
Overall, the safety profile in HIV-1 infected individuals is similar to the safety profile in 
immunocompetent adults, and no new safety signals are observed. The slightly more unfavourable 
safety profile with V114 as was observed in the pivotal studies is consistent with results obtained in 
this study population. 
However, as the vast majority participants still had a functioning immune system no conclusions are 
possible with regard to V114 administration in severely immunocompromised subjects. Further, this 
study does not provide any information on subjects infected with HIV that are vaccinated with V114 
with prior history of PPV23 vaccination. 
Prior pneumococcal vaccination 
Overall, the safety profile in participants with prior exposure to PPV23 was similar to the safety profile 
in the pneumococcal vaccine naïve population and no new safety signals are observed. The most 
commonly reported AEs in both intervention groups were solicited injection site AEs (59.8% in the 
V114 group and 46.8% in the PCV13 group) and systemic AEs (33.9% in the V114 group and 31.7% in 
the PCV13 group), as was seen in the pneumococcal naïve population. In general, the AEs were 
reported in similar proportions in both intervention groups. 
Pregnancy 
In total 14 participants in Study V114-017, 10 in the V114 group and 4 in the PCV13 group, got 
pregnant after vaccination during the follow-up period. Of the known infant outcomes, no congenital or 
other abnormalities were reported. These data do not indicate an unusual risk or safety concern; 
however, exposure to the vaccines in all cases was before the pregnancy. Currently, there is no clinical 
data of the use of these vaccines in women who are pregnant. The applicant commits to provide a

summary of pregnancy outcomes in future PSURs per the 2005 CHMP Guideline on The Exposure to 
Medicinal Products During Pregnancy: Need for Post-Authorisation Data. 
Sex, Race and Ethnicity 
Female subjects reported more AEs than male subjects across the several studies. Higher rates of 
reactogenicity in females have been reported for different vaccines and does not impact the use of the 
vaccine. Interestingly, the difference in reactogenicity appears to be greater in the PCV13 group 
compared to the V114 group. A trend towards higher reactogenicity in white subjects was observed for 
both intervention groups. No clear trends were observed with respect to reactogenicity between ethnic 
subgroups. Subgroup analyses by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and time since PPV23 receipt were 
provided and did not raise concerns.  
Overall, the safety profile in the different subgroups of sex, race and ethnicity was similar to the safety 
profile in the entire population and no new safety signals are observed. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions 
Concomitant injection with QIV does not affect the safety profile of V114 to a clinically relevant extent. 
The majority of the AEs experienced were solicited AEs, mostly mild in intensity and short duration.  
Sequential vaccination regimen of V114 followed by PPV23 is well tolerated. The safety profile in both 
intervention groups were generally comparable, in healthy adults ≥50 years (V114-016), in healthy 
adults 18 to 49 years old (V114-017) and in HIV-infected subjects ≥18 years (V114-018). 
Discontinuation due to AE 
As vaccination with V114 only requires a single dose, participants could only discontinue the 
intervention in studies in which PCV vaccination was followed by PPV23 or the study investigation 
concomitant vs non-concomitant QIV administration. The number of discontinuations due to AEs is low 
(9 in total) and comparable between intervention groups: 0.3% in the V114 groups and 0.1% in the 
PCV13 group. AEs leading to discontinuation were reported across multiple SOCs with no AEs being 
reported more than once. However, the conclusion that most AEs were non-serious and not considered 
vaccine-related cannot be agreed, as AEs leading to discontinuation were either serious or 
vaccine-related. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.5.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of V114 appears to be similar to the safety profile of PCV13, although slightly more 
reactogenic. It is a moderately reactogenic vaccine, with the majority of participants reporting 1 or 
more AEs; however, these were mostly mild or moderate in intensity and of short duration (≤3 days). 
The most frequently reported AEs by PT were solicited AEs: injection site pain, injection site swelling, 
fatigue, headache and myalgia.  
As expected, reactogenicity decreased with age. No SAEs or deaths occurred that were considered 
possibly related to V114.  
In conclusion, V114 is well tolerated in adults ≥18 years. However, compared to PCV13, V114 is 
slightly more reactogenic. This increase in reactogenicity is mainly due to increased injection site pain 
and has no further clinical implications.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication for V114 is for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease and 
pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults 18 years of age and older. 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes pneumococcal disease (PD), remains a leading cause of 
morbidity and mortality, particularly in older adults (≥65 years of age), adults ≥18 years of age with 
certain comorbid conditions (e.g., chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, chronic heart disease, 
diabetes mellitus, asthma), and immunocompromised adults (e.g., HIV, HSCT patients). Pneumococcal 
disease is classified as either invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) or non-invasive disease. IPD can 
lead to meningitis, bacteremia, sepsis, bacteraemic pneumonia, and septic arthritis. Non-invasive 
disease can present as, e.g. otitis media, sinusitis and non-bacteraemic pneumonia. IPD incidence is 
highest in young children (<5 years of age) and in older adults (≥65 years of age). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment options: 
Treatment of disease caused by S. pneumoniae is based on clinical presentation and antimicrobial 
susceptibility data. Initial treatment of IPD generally includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, as treatment 
starts before bacterial culture results are known. Treatment of CAP caused by S. pneumoniae requires 
rapid initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy and may require additional supportive care such as 
supplemental oxygen and sufficient fluid intake.  
The increasing rate of pneumococcal resistance to penicillin and other commonly used antimicrobial 
agents complicates treatment decisions and may lead to treatment failures with subsequent increased 
morbidity and healthcare costs. 
Prevention options: 
Recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination in adults are typically based on age or risk for 
pneumococcal disease. However national recommendations differ world-wide and also within the EU. 
Prevention of PD in adults currently includes vaccination with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
(PPV) and/or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and prophylactic use of antibiotics in certain 
clinical settings. Currently, the PPV vaccine Pneumovax™23 (PPV23) and the PCV vaccine Prevenar 
13TM (PCV13) are licensed for use in adults. The mechanism of action of all licensed pneumococcal 
vaccines is the induction of protective, serotype-specific, anti-capsular antibodies measured by 
opsonophagocytic assay called OPA antibodies. Pneumococcal vaccines have demonstrated efficacy and 
effectiveness against invasive diseases caused by the serotypes in vaccines in children and adults. 
Serotypes currently covered by vaccines are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F 
(PCV13) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19F, 19A, 20, 22F, 
23F and 33F. (PPV23). 
Unmet medical need 
Since the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines, there has been an overall reduction in the incidence 
of IPD, however pneumococcal disease remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/620380/2021 
Page 101/109 
 
 
 
case-fatality rate of IPD has not decreased over the past 2 decades. A decrease in the incidence of 
pneumococcal disease caused by serotypes included in the currently licensed vaccines, except serotype 
3, was observed across all age groups. However, strain replacement is a concern as in multiple 
regions, a significant increase in disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes in both children and adults 
has been observed.  
In Europe, the 10 most common serotypes causing pneumococcal disease in 2018 were 8, 3, 19A, 22F, 
12F, 9N, 15A, 10A, 23B and 6C (in order of decreasing frequency), which accounts for 70% of typed 
isolates. Of note, serotype 3 and 19A are included in the currently licensed PCV and PPV vaccines. 
There was a significant decrease in the disease caused by 19A, as this was the leading cause of 
pneumococcal disease prior to inclusion in the PCV and PPV vaccines. Serotype 3 still remains a 
common serotype that causes disease in adults and children.  
Next to 22F, 33F also increased in frequency in several regions and countries. In the United States, 
22F and 33F were among the top 10 serotypes causing IPD in adults ≥65 year and children ≤5 year in 
2017. Serotype 22F and 33F are known to be among the serotypes with the highest invasive capacity 
(Yildirim I et al. Vaccine 2011) and are associated with serious clinical outcomes. IPD due to serotypes 
22F and 33F have been associated with an increased 30-day mortality in patients ≥5 year, antibiotic 
resistance and prolonged hospitalization in adults.  
Due to the disease severity of IPD and the healthcare burden of residual disease due to non-vaccine 
serotypes, prevention of pneumococcal disease remains an unmet medical need. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical studies for evaluating the immunogenicity of V114 are the 2 Phase 3 studies 
V114-019 and V114-017. Both studies are randomised, multicentre, double-blind, active comparator 
controlled (PCV13) studies evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of V114. 
Study V114-019 enrolled healthy adults ≥50 years of age who were randomised (1:1) to receive either 
V114 or PCV13. In total, 602 participants received a single dose of V114 IM, and 600 received a single 
dose of PCV13 IM.  
Study V114-017 enrolled adults 18 to 49 year (inclusive) with or without risk factors for pneumococcal 
disease (diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, COPD, asthma, chronic heart disease, current 
smoker), who were randomised (3:1) to receive either V114 (n=1,133) or PCV13 (n=379) followed by 
PPV23 6 months later.  
The study populations included the main populations expected to benefit from the vaccine: either 
healthy elderly subjects (study V114-019) or adults 18 to 49 years old with risk factors for 
pneumococcal disease (study V114-017). In both studies the subjects received one dose of V114 or 
PCV13 IM, in line with the proposed regimen for V114 and the approved regimen for PCV13.  
In line with EMA guidance, in a scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/FU/1/2017/III) it was agreed to 
base the clinical development programme on immunogenicity studies and that no efficacy studies are 
required. The use of serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity geometric mean titres (OPA GMTs) 
and IgG geometric mean concentrations (IgG GMCs) for immunogenicity analyses was adequately 
justified and accepted in the same scientific advice. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
OPA antibodies. OPA antibodies are considered surrogate markers for vaccine efficacy. OPA GMTs 
increased from Day 1 to Day 30 for the 13 serotypes shared between V114 and PCV13 and the 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/620380/2021 
Page 102/109 
 
 
 
unique serotypes 22F and 33F. For the 15 serotypes included in V114 the percentage of participants 
who had a ≥4-fold rise in OPA GMT ranged from 52.2% to 81.2% in the V114 group in Study V114-
019 and 51.5% to 87.5% in the V114 group in study V114-017.  
Comparability to PCV13. V114 was shown to be non-inferior to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes in 
study V114-019, based on the predefined non-inferiority margin of the lower bound of the 2-sided 
95% CI of the OPA GMT ratio (V114/PCV13) being greater than 0.5. The RCDCs of the 13 shared 
serotypes showed a similar pattern for the V114 group and the PCV13 group. Visually, the curves show 
a similar distribution, indicating that both vaccines induced a comparable immune response. 
Elderly. V114 was immunogenic in all age categories investigated. Although the immune response 
declined with age, a notable immune response was still present in participants ≥75 years old. 
Durability of response. During study V114-016, it was seen that OPA GMTs were still above baseline 
12 months after vaccination, indicating that the immune response persisted for at least 12 months. 
Concomitant vaccination with influenza vaccine. The results from study V114-021 indicated that 
concomitant vaccination of V114 with QIV did not impact immunogenicity of QIV but did result in a 
somewhat lower response to V114. The prespecified non-inferiority margin (of the lower bound of the 
2-sided 95% CI of the OPA GMT ratio [concomitant/non-concomitant] being greater than 0.5) was 
however met for all serotypes. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Efficacy/effectiveness data. No efficacy or effectiveness data is available for V114. The evaluation 
of the protective effect of the V114 vaccine regimen is based on bridging clinical immunogenicity 
results to immunogenicity data of a licensed pneumococcal vaccine, PCV13, that has been shown to be 
effective. For the 2 new serotypes, a Phase 2 study (Ermlich et al., Vaccine 2018), using an earlier 
formulation, showed that V114 induced OPA and IgG responses against 22F and 33F that were 
generally higher or comparable to those induced by PPV23 with proven efficacy.  
Correlate of protection. There is no correlate of protection known for pneumococcal disease. The 
primary immunogenicity endpoint in the studies was the level of OPA GMT, as measured by the MOPA, 
but there is no cut-off value known that can be associated with clinical benefit in adults. This hampers 
the interpretation of the observed vaccine-induced immunogenicity and the clinical relevance of 
meeting the non-inferiority and superiority margin compared to PCV13. 
Reduced response to certain serotypes. Although the prespecified non-inferiority criteria were met, 
the immunogenicity results obtained during the pivotal study V114-019 seem to indicate a somewhat 
reduced immune response to V114 compared to PCV13. For study V114-019, the upper bound of the 
2-sided 95% CI of the GMT ratio did not contain 1.00 in 7 of the shared serotypes, while this was the 
case for only 1 serotype (serotype 4) in 2 supportive studies in a similar population, V114-016 and 
V114-020. In addition, across all studies, the serotype 4 OPA GMTs elicited by V114 were lower 
compared to the OPA GMTs elicited by PCV13. 
Immunocompromised populations. Data in high-risk immunocompromised populations is currently 
lacking. Study V114-018 included HIV-infected subjects; however, the participants included in the 
study all received antiretroviral therapy; the majority did not have a detectable viral load and had a 
CD4 count >200 cells/µL. This indicates that the participants still had a functioning immune system. 
The population studied is considered sufficiently representative for the population of HIV infected 
patients in Europe most likely to get vaccinated. Study V114-022 in allo-HSCT recipients is ongoing, 
and no information is available. Therefore, information on immunogenicity in adult HSCT recipients is 
Assessment report

Page 103/109 
 
 
 
missing, and therefore an important part of the information in immunocompromised individuals is 
missing. 
Durability of response. Data on antibody persistence is currently limited to one year; therefore, 
there is no information on long-term protection by V114. In addition, no data is available concerning a 
potential booster vaccination. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Adverse events. The safety profile of V114 was comparable to the safety profile of PCV13. For both 
interventions, the majority of participants experienced 1 or more AEs in all studies. The most 
commonly reported AEs were solicited AEs, i.e., injection site reactions (driven by injection site pain) 
and myalgia, fatigue, arthralgia and headache.  
Overall, slightly more participants receiving V114 reported AEs compared to participants receiving 
PCV13. 
In participants ≥50 years of age, 72.3% of participants experienced 1 or more AE, and 68.0% 
experienced a vaccine-related AE. The most commonly reported AEs were solicited AEs: injection site 
pain (58.5%), fatigue (20.2%), myalgia (19.5%), headache (14.5%), injection site swelling (14.5%), 
injection site erythema (11.1%) and arthralgia (6.3%). 
In participants 18-49 years of age (inclusive), 84.7% of participants experienced 1 or more AE and 
81.6% experienced a vaccine-related AE. The most commonly reported AEs were solicited AEs: 
injection site pain (75.8%), fatigue (34.3%), myalgia (28.8%), headache (26.5%), injection site 
swelling (21.7%), injection site erythema (15.1%) and arthralgia (12.7%). 
Overall, a slightly more unfavourable safety profile is consistently observed throughout the clinical 
study programme for V114 compared to PCV13, as shown by the safety results of the 7-study pool. In 
the pooled analysis, 76.0% of participants in the V114 group experienced 1 or more AE and 72.0% a 
vaccine-related AE compared to 66.8% and 62.2% of participants in the PCV13 group respectively. 
This difference was mainly driven by increased incidences of:  
- 
injection site reactions (mostly pain [64.6% in the V114 group and 51.5% in the PCV13 group], 
but  also  swelling  [16.1%  in  the  V114  group  and  14.2%  in  the  PCV13  group]  and  erythema 
[11.3% in the V114 group and 11.0% in the PCV13 group])  
-  myalgia (20.7% in the V114 group and 16.8% in the PCV13 group)  
- 
- 
fatigue (23.4% in the V114 group and 22.2% in the PCV13 group)  
headache (17.3% in the V114 group and 16.7% in the PCV13 group).  
V114-vaccinated subjects tended to show more moderate or Grade 2 events compared to PCV13-
vaccinated subjects.  
As safety data across the 7 studies, including 5030 participants in the V114 group and 1,808 
participants in the Prevenar 13 group, is more robust as compared to the individual studies, ADRs 
presented in the SmPC should reflect frequencies in the 7-study pool. 
Concomitant vaccination with QIV was overall well tolerated, although a trend for slightly more 
subjects reporting systemic vaccine related AEs is observed in comparison to non-concomitant group 
33.0% (V114 and QIV), 26.7% (V114 alone), 22.1% (placebo and QIV), and 11.1% (placebo alone). 
Assessment report

Discontinuations due to AE. In total 9 participants had AEs leading to study vaccine discontinuation, 
8 of 2799 (0.3%) participants who received V114 and 1 of 852 (0.1%) participants who received 
PCV13.  
In both intervention groups, the majority of participants had events which were mild in intensity, with 
a toxicity of Grade 1, a size ≤5.0 cm and short duration (≤3 days).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Missing information. Safety has not been assessed in pregnant women. The applicant commits to 
provide a summary of pregnancy outcomes in future PSURs per the 2005 CHMP Guideline on The 
Exposure to Medicinal Products During Pregnancy: Need for Post-Authorisation Data. In addition, the 
information on safety in immunocompromised patients is very limited. As stated in the scientific advice 
by the CHMP, HIV-infected patients and HSCT recipients are deemed sufficiently representative of the 
wide range of medical conditions associated with cellular and/or humoral immune dysfunction. The 
vast majority of HIV-1-infected patients included in Study V114-018 had a functioning immune 
system. However, the population studied is considered sufficiently representative for the population of 
HIV-infected patients in Europe most likely to get vaccinated. A study, including allo-HSCT recipients 
(V114-022) is ongoing; however, no information on safety in this population is currently available.  
Hypersensitivity reactions. Information on hypersensitivity reactions after vaccination with V114 is 
limited in the dossier. Hypersensitivity reactions are a known risk for vaccines. The applicant will 
continue to monitor Type 1 hypersensitivity events via routine pharmacovigilance. 
Safety database. In total, 5,630 participants received V114, of which 4,389 were ≥50 years. The size 
of the safety database limits the detection of more rare adverse events. Information on rare but 
serious AEs should be systematically collected post-licensure. 
3.6.  Effects Table 
There is no clinical efficacy data available in the dossier. OPA GMT results are taken as surrogate

1)V114-019 has met its primary immunogenicity objectives regarding non-inferiority of V114 compared to PCV13 with 
respect to OPA GMTs for the 13 shared serotypes; lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI ≥0.5).  
2)Furthermore, V114-019 has met its primary immunogenicity objectives regarding superiority of V114 compared to 
PCV13 with respect to both OPA GMTs and the proportions of participants with ≥4-fold rises in OPA responses for the 
2 unique serotypes; lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI ≥2.0) In addition, the superiority of response to serotype 3 
of V114 compared to PCV13 was investigated concerning OPA GMTs (lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI ≥1.2) and 
proportions of participants with ≥4-fold rises in OPA responses (lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI ≥0.0). Since 
comparisons were made individually for each of the 15 serotypes, this approach controls the 1-sided type-I error rate 
at 0.025, and no multiplicity adjustment was required. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The mechanism of action of all pneumococcal vaccines, including V114, is the induction of protective, 
serotype-specific, anti-capsular antibodies, measured using an opsonophagocytic assay. The OPA 
antibodies are considered surrogate markers for efficacy and have been found to correlate with 
protection against disease (Song et al. J. Infect Chemother. 2013).  
V114 elicits the generation of functional OPA antibodies against the 15 serotypes contained in the 
vaccine in all 7 clinical studies. Overall, the immunogenicity data showed that the immune response to 
V114 was generally comparable to the response to PCV13. V114 was shown to be non-inferior to 
PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes and superior to PCV13 for the 2 unique serotypes. Next to the OPA 
antibodies, IgG GMCs, GMFR, the proportion of participants with ≥4-fold rise in OPA or IgG titre and 
RCDC, all indicated that the immune response elicited by V114 was substantial and largely comparable 
to the immune response generated by PCV13. In the 7 studies submitted in the dossier, the 
immunogenicity of V114 has been demonstrated in different populations using both OPA GMTs and IgG

GMCs. The trials were conducted in different geographical areas and included adults ≥18 years with a 
significant portion of elderly participants (44.5% of all vaccinated participants were ≥65 years old). 
The fact that there is no correlate of protection, somewhat hampers the interpretation of the clinical 
relevance of the results. PCV13 has been shown to be protective against invasive pneumococcal 
disease. To infer a clinical benefit, the applicant has bridged the immunologic response of V114 to the 
13 shared serotypes of V114 to PCV13, which is considered acceptable. As the immunological response 
to V114 is comparable to the immunological response to PCV13, it is considered reasonable to 
conclude that V114 could provide protection against pneumococcal disease. It is however unknown to 
what extent differences between the V114 and PCV13 induced immune responses may have an impact 
on protection against invasive pneumococcal disease, as clinical efficacy has not been demonstrated 
for V114. Epidemiological surveillance will be necessary to ensure early detection of breakthrough 
disease caused by potential vaccine failure or reduced vaccine effectiveness. In addition, next to 
breakthrough disease, serotype replacement should be included in surveillance studies. The applicant 
has committed to discuss these topics in the yearly PSURs within the context of routine 
pharmacovigilance.  
In the pivotal studies, a consistently weaker immune response to serotype 4 was seen after 
vaccination with V114 compared to PCV13. This is most likely not clinically relevant, as the percentage 
of participants with an ≥4-fold rise in OPA GMTs was still substantial (≥79%), and the difference in the 
percentage of responders (≥4-fold rise) in the V114 and PCV13 group was relatively small, <10%. In 
addition, RCDC for serotype 4 showed that the distribution is similar between V114 and PCV13 and 
that there is a substantial immune response in both intervention groups, as shown by the substantial 
difference between the baseline curves and the postvaccination curves.   
In the pivotal studies, it was observed that the responses to serotype 3 and the 2 unique serotypes 
were stronger after vaccination with V114 compared to PCV13. This is relevant as serotype 3 still leads 
to disease even though it is included in PCV13. In addition, 22F and 33F are also among the key non-
vaccine serotypes leading to PD. Inclusion of serotypes 22F and 33F and increasing the immune 
response to serotype 3 might increase protection against disease for these serotypes. 
While efficacy could be extrapolated from PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes, this could not be done 
for the serotypes unique to V114. However, for both new serotypes a robust immune response is seen, 
with GMTs of 2,375 and 7,995 being achieved after V114 vaccination during the pivotal study for 
serotype 22F and 33F respectively. In the V114 arm of study V114-019 71.4% and 56.7% achieved a 
4-fold rise in GMT response for serotype 22F and 33F respectively, compared to 14.3% and 6.3% in 
the PCV13 arm. In addition, in a Phase 2 study (Ermlich et al., Vaccine 2018), using an earlier 
formulation, V114 induced OPA and IgG responses against 22F and 33F that were generally higher or 
comparable to those induced by PPV23 with proven efficacy.  These results indicate that efficacy could 
be reasonably assumed, however, as stated previously, post-marketing epidemiological surveillance 
will be necessary to ensure vaccine effectiveness for these new serotypes.  
Currently, antibody persistence has been shown to last for at least 12 months. The immunogenicity 
data at 12 months is comparable between V114 and PCV13. Due to the lack of any threshold value 
associated with clinical benefit, it is not possible to establish duration of protection or to advise on 
when a booster dose should be recommended. The lack of information on long-term 
protection/immunogenicity and requirement for a booster vaccination is included in the SmPC.  
The documented safety exposure is considered sufficient for adequate assessment of the safety profile 
of V114. However, the size of the safety database limits the detection of more rare but serious adverse 
events. Information on rare but serious AEs should be systematically collected post-licensure, including 
hypersensitivity reactions.  
Assessment report

The safety profile of V114 was comparable to the safety profile of PCV13. In the 7 studies submitted in 
the dossier, no new safety signals were observed for V114 compared to PCV13. V114 was slightly more 
reactogenic, leading to a higher percentage of participants experiencing 1 or more AEs, mainly due to 
increased incidence of injection site reactions (driven by injection site pain, around 15%-point 
difference) and solicited systemic AEs (most notably myalgia, around 5% point difference). For both 
interventions, the majority of participants experienced 1 or more AEs in all studies and the most 
commonly reported AEs were solicited AEs. V114 is well-tolerated since most of the AEs are mild in 
intensity, of short duration (≤ 3 days) and the discontinuations due to adverse events are low. 
Information on safety and efficacy of V114 in high-risk immunocompromised populations is currently 
lacking as study V114-022 is currently ongoing. Immunocompromised individuals are at risk of 
developing pneumococcal disease and are therefore likely to be vaccinated. Information on safety and 
efficacy/immunogenicity in this population is thus clinically relevant. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
V114 elicits an immune response to all 15 serotypes contained within the vaccine, as measured by the 
increase in functional antibodies using the MOPA assay. Based upon bridging of immunological 
response of V114 to the response to PCV13, for which efficacy has been established, it is considered 
reasonable to conclude that V114 could provide protection against pneumococcal disease.  
The safety profile of V114 is characterised by injection site pain, fatigue and headache and is 
comparable to the safety profile of PCV13. As the reported AEs are mainly mild in intensity and of short 
duration, the beneficial effect associated with V114 outweighs the risks.  
Considering all favourable and unfavourable effects, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive 
from a clinical perspective. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Vaxneuvance is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Vaxneuvance is favourable in the following indication(s): 
“Vaxneuvance is indicated for active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and 
pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in individuals 18 years of age and older. 
See sections 4.4. and 5.1 for information on protection against specific pneumococcal serotypes. 
The use of Vaxneuvance should be in accordance with official recommendations.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

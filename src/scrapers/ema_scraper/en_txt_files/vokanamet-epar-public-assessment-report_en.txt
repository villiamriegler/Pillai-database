2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The prevalence of diabetes worldwide is rising rapidly and is estimated to reach 4.4% of the 
world’s population or approximately 366 million people by 2030. The long-term manifestations of 
diabetes contribute to its status as a leading cause of premature illness and mortality worldwide. 
There are currently agents from a number of different classes that are available for the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Most patients with T2DM are initially managed 
with single-agent therapy, usually metformin. Despite initial monotherapy, many patients have 
progressive loss of glycemic control, requiring combinations of agents, and often eventually 
insulin therapy. Underlying this progressive deterioration in glycemic control is a gradual loss of 
beta-cell function. 
Many of the current T2DM treatments are associated with safety or tolerability issues, including 
hypoglycemia, edema, or gastrointestinal adverse experiences which can limit dose and hence 
therapeutic benefit. Further, some of the current anti-hyperglycaemic agents (AHAs) are 
associated with weight gain, which is particularly problematic as over 85% of patients with T2DM 
are overweight and obese. Additional weight gain can increase insulin resistance, an underlying 
pathophysiologic mechanism of T2DM. Only few AHAs (eg, metformin and glucagon-like peptide-
1 [GLP-1] analogues) lead to weight loss. 
There is a need for novel treatment options for T2DM, due to the increasing global prevalence of 
the disease, its progressive nature which eventually requires combination therapy in most 
patients as well as the undesirable effects of currently available therapies.

2.2.2.  Active Substances 
Canagliflozin 
The chemical name of canagliflozin hemihydrate is (1S)-1,5-anhydro-1-[3-[[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-
2-thienyl]-methyl]-4-methylphenyl]-D-glucitol hemihydrate and has the following structure: 
. ½ H2O 
Canagliflozin hemihydrate is a white to off-white powder, practically insoluble in water and freely 
soluble in ethanol and non-hygroscopic. The particle size distribution is controlled to ensure a 
consistent finished product manufacturing process; studies showed that the particle size has no 
impact on the performance in vivo.  
Canagliflozin (INN) exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of five chiral centres. The 
diastereomeric purity of the drug substance is controlled by an achiral assay/purity HPLC 
method. 
Polymorphism has been observed for canagliflozin: the manufactured form I, which is a 
hemihydrate, and an unstable amorphous Form II. Form I is consistently produced by the 
proposed commercial synthesis process.  
Manufacture 
Canagliflozin is manufactured by one source and is synthesized in five main synthetic steps plus 
two purification steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
Process validation on three consecutive batches has been completed successfully. The validation 
batches were tested with the validated analytical methods used for batch release. The analytical 
results demonstrate that all validation batches meet the proposed specification limits. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well 
discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The manufacturing process yields one diastereoisomer of the active substance. It is not 
necessary to perform a test for chiral purity on canagliflozin as the impurity is controlled by the 
general analytical method for impurities.

EMA/179391/2014

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (IR), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC, LCMS, LC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), 
residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), and particle size distribution. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described. Non-compendial methods have 
been appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Stability 
Stability data were provided on six commercial scale batches of active substance from the 
proposed manufacturer stored for 24 months under long term conditions at 25°C/60% RH ‘for 9 
months at 30°C /75% RH and up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40°C/75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines in the intended container closure system representative of that 
intended for the market. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed. Results on stress 
conditions (including high temperature, acid, alkaline, oxidising) were also provided. The active 
substance is stable at high temperature and humidity and degrades moderately under basic and 
peroxide conditions. Canagliflozin is unstable under photolytic and radical oxidation conditions.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, chromatographic purity, water 
content and particle size. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were 
stability indicating. No trends were observed. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed 
container. 
Metformin hydrochloride  
The chemical name of metformin hydrochloride  is 1,1-Dimetylbiguanidine hydrochloride and has 
the following structure: 
Metformin hydrochloride is a white, solid, crystalline powder. It is  slighly hygroscopic, soluble in 
water and practically insoluble in acetone. Also metformin hydrochloride is very poorly permeable 
to biological membranes, this being a rate limiting step in its absorption being considered a BCS 
Class 3 high-solubility low-permeability drug. 
Particle size does not considerably influence dissolution or bioavailability.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The goal of the pharmaceutical development was to design a combination tablet of two oral 
antidiabetics with the minimum possible size and to be bioequivalent to commercial products 
containing the commercial active substances. 
The canagliflozin / metformin hydrochloride film-coated tablets are capsule-shaped immediate 
release tablets containing a fixed dose combination of canagliflozin and metformin  hydrochloride 
in four different strengths each containing 50 or 150 mg canagliflozin, and 850 or 1000 mg 
metformin hydrochloride, respectively.  
Based on low solubility and low permeability, canagliflozin is classified as a BCS 4 compound and 
metformin hydrochloride is considered as a BCS Class 3 high-solubility low-permeability drug. 
The membrane permeability of metformin hydrochloride rather than dissolution is the rate-

limiting step in its absorption. Therefore, the influence of the active substances particle size 
distribution and granulation process conditions on the characteristics of the canagliflozin granules 
were extensively investigated during the pharmaceutical development and were founded to have 
no effect on the dissolution profile of the final pharmaceutical form. 
During the pharmaceutical development different aspects of the manufacturing process were 
investigated. Fluid bed granulation was chosen over high shear granulation to meet the preferred 
wet granulation manufacturing platform due to the high drug load. Also during characterization, 
batches were produced at wet, dry, and target conditions to evaluate the influence of the 
granulation process parameters on the granules and on the final drug product. The blending 
process development was conducted to optimize the blending time for initial and final blending 
toward blend uniformity and proper tablet lubrication. 
The granulation process development of canagliflozin granules and metformin hydrochloride 
granules was conducted to optimize the spray rate, air temperature, air flow ranges and drying 
end point toward appropriate granule characteristics were optimized during the pharmaceutical 
development in order to deliver a tablet with suitable characteristics. These process parameters 
were selected since they can potentially impact the critical quality attributes of the drug product. 
The manufacturing principles and processing steps are the same for all the strengths of the 
finished product. The manufacturing steps at development and commercial scale are essentially 
the same. Two minor modifications were made to the commercial process, the type of equipment 
used for screening metformin  hydrochloride (rotating impeller mill instead of vibratory sifter) 
and the temperature of the water used during preparation of the binder(on development scale, 
hypromellose is dispersed in hot water (>60 °C)) .These differences have no critical impact on 
the process. 
A compatibility study was carried out between the proposed excipients with the drug substances 
in the core tablets. 
Extragranular microcrystalline cellulose was included to improve the compressibility and tablet 
properties of the formulation like hardness and friability without affecting disintegration time.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. 
Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as an immediate release dosage form with 
the minimum possible size that meets compendial specifications on an oral tablet. 
The critical quality attributes identified were potency, appearance, assay, chromatographic 
purity, uniformity of dosage units, tablet hardness, dissolution, disintegration and friability. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same that the used for marketing 
Bioequivalence study was performed showing bioequivalence between the clinical formulation 
and the proposed commercial formulation  
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated.

The primary packaging is HDPE bottle with child-resistant closure, induction seal and desiccant. 
The  material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The finished product is manufactured using conventional wet granulation, blending, compression, 
and film-coating processes. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has 
been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for the 
manufacture of an immediate release tablet. 
Proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have been defined for the following steps of the medicinal 
product:  granulation of each of the drug substances, blending, compression and film-coating. 
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from 
commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs.  
The dissolution methods have been proven to be discriminating.  
Product specification 
The finished product (release) specifications contain appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form including appearance (visual examination),dimension (calibrated caliper), identification 
(IR),assay (UPLC), chromatographic purity (UPLC), dissolution (HPLC) uniformity of dosage units 
(Ph. Eur.), water content (KF) and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
Batch analysis results are provided for a number of clinical, development and production batches 
of all different strengths confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability 
to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data on  three production scale batches of each tablet strength stored under long term 
conditions for up to  12 months at real time conditions 25 ºC / 60% RH and intermediate 
conditions at 30 ºC / 75% RH were presented. Six months of data under accelerated conditions 
at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Vokanamet are 
identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed 
for marketing.  
Samples were tested for content for active substances, appearance, water content impurities, 
dissolution and microbiological purity. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.

In addition, the same batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
photostability testing of new drug substances and products and also were put under stress 
conditions at 50 ºC. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to 
the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical 
use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and their 
manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process 
of the active substance, nor for the finished product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological

up to date data of canagliflozin. All responses provided during the assessment of the canagliflozin 
single agent were made part of the CANA/MET dossier. The assessment of metformin is based on 
a mix of literature and relevant studies. Metformin is regarded a well-known substance. No new 
studies for the combination have been provided by the Applicant.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Canagliflozin 
Canagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. SGLT2 is expressed in the proximal renal tubule 
predominantly in the kidney cortex, specifically in the S1 segment of the proximal tubule where it 
reabsorbs the majority of glucose filtered by the glomerulus. It transports sodium (Na) and 
glucose in a 1:1 ratio, functioning as a low–affinity high-capacity transporter. Inhibition of SGLT2 
results in increased urinary glucose excretion (UGE) due to reduced glucose reabsorption. As a 
consequence plasma glucose levels are lowered resulting in loss of calories and anti-
hyperglycaemic effects beneficial for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
Primary and secondary pharmacodynamics (PD) of canagliflozin were studied in cell-based in 
vitro assays and in several in vivo models of mice, rats and dogs.  
Canagliflozin inhibited rat and human SGLT2 overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells 
(CHOK1) cells as measured by inhibition of alpha-methylglycopyranoside (AMG) uptake with an 
IC50 of 3.7 nM for rSGLT2 and 4.2 nM hSGLT2, respectively. The inhibition of SGLT1 in the same 
cell system was more than 150-times lower, with an IC50 of 550 nM for rSGLT1 and 663 nM for 
hSGLT1, respectively. Functional activity of canagliflozin on SGLT2 and SGLT1 of other species 
was not determined.  
Off target effects on other human glucose transporters such as SGLT3, SGLT4, SGLT6, facilative 
glucose transporters (GLUTs) or sodium/myo-inositol co-transporter-1 (hSMIT1) were also 
studied in various cell models. No relevant inhibition of these transporters by canagliflozin was 
detected.  
Binding parameters (association and dissociation rates of canagliflozin, equilibrium constant - Kd) 
were determined on membranes from Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCKII) cells overexpressing 
hSGLT2 in equilibrium saturation binding assays in the absence or presence of physiological 
levels of glucose. Canagliflozin showed relatively fast association kinetics and relatively slow 
dissociation kinetics with a Kd of 16.82 nM in the presence of glucose and 15.29 nM in the 
absence of glucose. Binding parameters on hSGLT1 and SGLT2 of other species were not 
determined. Washout studies demonstrated a high affinity of canagliflozin on hSGLT2 with 
reversibility over time.  
In vivo primary PD after a single dose of canagliflozin was determined in non-diabetic and 
diabetic mice (db/db mice), non-diabetic and diabetic fatty rats (ZDF, fa/fa rats) and obese dogs. 
Primary PD parameters measured were urine glucose excretion (UGE), blood glucose during oral 
glucose tolerance test (OGTT), fed blood glucose and glucose renal reabsorption. The following 
table summarizes performed in vivo PD studies with canagliflozin. 
Taken together, canagliflozin showed an increase in UGE, lowering in blood glucose levels after 
an OGTT or under fed conditions and inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption in all animal models 
tested. The effective dose was between 0.3 and 10 mg/kg. 
Secondary PD studies in db/db and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and SD and fa/fa rats (mildly 
hyperglycaemic) demonstrated a reduction in body weight (or a decrease in weight gain) 
following repeated administration of canagliflozin (2-4 weeks). In one study with older 
hyperglycaemic, diabetic rats weight gain was increased. In general, food intake was not altered

during canagliflozin treatment. These findings were coupled with improved glucose handling 
during an OGTT and increases in plasma insulin levels and lowering in HbA1c values 
(hyperglycaemic fa/fa rats). 
In in vitro safety pharmacology studies canagliflozin showed no effect on the cardiovascular 
system (inhibition of hERG currents, isolated Langendorff perfused rabbit heart) in concentrations 
up to 1 µM. Calculated Cmax exposure safety margins for the in vivo cardiovascular and 
pulmonary assays in conscious dogs were 61-times using the 100 mg once daily human dose, 
and 14-times for the 300 mg once daily human dose. Canagliflozin did not cause any 
neurobehavioral changes in rats at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg, and AUC exposure safety 
margins at the high dose were 214-times and 57-times for the 100 and 300 mg once daily 
clinical doses, respectively (human data taken from studies DIA1007 and DIA1023). 
Metformin 
The efficacy of metformin is believed to be mediated primarily via inhibition of hepatic glucose 
production. 
Metformin is a well-established treatment for Type 2 diabetes and therefore, no preclinical 
pharmacology and safety pharmacology studies have been performed with metformin by the 
Applicant. 
Canagliflozin/metformin 
No preclinical pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic drug interaction 
studies have been performed with the canagliflozin/metformin combination. This approach is 
endorsed by the CHMP. Canagliflozin and metformin act through different mechanisms of action. 
Adverse pharmacodynamic interactions between canagliflozin and metformin are not expected. 
Furthermore, there is sufficient experience from clinical trials with treatment of patients with the 
combination of canagliflozin/metformin. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with metformin and the canagliflozin/metformin combination 
have been performed by the Applicant. Data on canagliflozin are based on assessment reports of 
canagliflozin, data on metformin are based on literature reviews. 
Canagliflozin 
Absorption 
Oral administration of canagliflozin resulted in good absorption in mice, dogs, and monkeys. 
However, absorption was markedly reduced in rat. C max was reached rapidly in all species 
following oral administration, with Tmax values ranging between 1 hour (mouse) and 3.5 hours 
(monkeys). Due to the prolonged oral absorption in rats, Tmax values ranged from 4 to 7 hours 
following single and repeated dosing. The absolute bioavailability was highest in mouse 
(>100%), probably caused by enterohepatic circulation, followed by dog (up to 68%), monkey 
(49%), and rat (35%). For humans absolute bioavailability was 65%. Elimination half-life of 
canagliflozin was most rapid in mice (4 to 5 hours) and slow in rats, dogs, and monkeys (6 to 8 
hours). The volume of distribution (Vd) of canagliflozin was approximately similar (1.6 to 2.4 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 22/130 
 
  
  
l/kg) in the mouse, rat, and monkey, and smaller (0.6 to 0.8 l/kg) in the dog (higher than total 
body water).  
Distribution 
Canagliflozin showed a high protein binding (> 98%) at concentrations below (0.45 µM) and 
above (45 µM) human exposure at the anticipated 100 mg (Cmax of 0.98 µg/ml, 2.2 µM) and 300 
mg (Cmax of 4.1 µg/ml, 9.3 µM) daily doses throughout species. HSA is likely responsible for the 
majority of canagliflozin protein binding. 
Blood to plasma ratios were highest for rat (0.78 to 1.0), intermediate for human (0.66 to 0.71), 
and lowest for dog (0.51 to 0.61) indicating no distribution of canagliflozin into blood cells. 
In distribution studies with 14C-canagliflozin, canagliflozin was found in blood, plasma, and most 
tissues (including eye and skin). Highest concentrations were observed in kidney, liver and 
glandular tissues especially in the renal cortex and the harderian gland. Canagliflozin and its 
metabolites were hardly distributed into brain, bone and white fat. Maximum total radioactivity 
concentrations for blood, plasma, eye, and pigmented skin were 1.30, 1.53, 1.25, and 1.56 µg/g 
or ml at the low dose or 17.8, 22.6, 12.6, and 24.7 µg/g or ml at the high dose, respectively. No 
accumulation in tissues were observed in relevant plasma concentrations, radioactivity levels in 
skin and eye were comparable to those in plasma. This is in particular of interest as a 
photosensitizing potential was claimed for canagliflozin in in vitro and in vivo assays (refer to 
section “Phototoxicity”). 
Metabolism and Excretion 
Twenty metabolites (M1-20) of canagliflozin were detected in in vitro and in vivo metabolism 
studies. All human metabolites were also present in at least one animal species (for an overview 
of important canagliflozin metabolites in different species, refer to the table below). In vitro 
studies showed that unchanged drug was the major component in human liver microsomes, and 
in mouse, rat, dog, rabbit, and human hepatocytes. M7 O-glucuronide was the major metabolite 
in mice (27-46%) and humans (28%) and was also present in the other species. M6 carboxy 
metabolite was formed in hepatocytes of all species and was the main metabolite in male rats 
(42%) and dogs (13%). It was also present in human hepatocytes (2%) but was not formed in 
human liver microsomes. In in vivo studies, unchanged drug was the major component in plasma 
of all species after 24 hours. In human plasma the remaining drug-related products were O-
glucoronides M5 and M7 and hydroxylated drug metabolite M9 up to 12 hours but not after 24 
hours. In dog and rat no metabolites were detected in plasma, in mice M7 and M9 were present 
at lower amounts as compared to humans. However, in the toxicity studies with high doses in 
mice, rats and dogs M5 and M7 were detected in plasma, liver and kidney. At low doses 
metabolites M5 and M7 were not found in rat plasma faeces and urine but are found as major 
metabolites in humans in plasma and urine (>10% of parent). M7 was the major metabolite 
found in rat bile, M5 was also present but to a lesser extent. Furthermore M7 was formed in rat 
hepatocytes. M5 and M7 undergo hydrolisation in faeces and are therefore not detectable.

recovered in human urine, and in animals about 2% to 7% was recovered in urine. Biliary 
excretion was furthermore tested in mice and rats. The table below summarizes the routes of

Taken together, in humans the primary metabolic clearance pathway of canagliflozin is through 
its direct glucuronidation in liver whereas in animal species oxidation is the major metabolic 
pathway, yielding various metabolites not present in humans in vivo (e.g. M1, M2, M4, M6, M8). 
Human plasma levels of O-glucuronides M5 and M7 approached a peak of ~30% of the sample 
radioactivity, see figure below.

Proposed in vivo metabolic pathways for canagliflozin in mice, rats, dogs, and humans 
(taken from Non-clinical overview, 2.4). 
Canagliflozin or its metabolites M5 and M7 did not induce nor inhibit CYPs at clinically relevant 
concentrations (IC50 canagliflozin for the inhibition of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 = 16 and 75 µM, 
respectively; IC50 M5 = 55 and 64 µM, respectively; IC50 canagliflozin for the inhibition of 
CYP2C9 = 80 µM and CYP3A4/testosterone = 27 µM). Canagliflozin was not found to be a 
substrate or inhibitor of SLCs or URAT1 but was found to be a substrate for transporters MDR1 
and MRP2. 
Canagliflozin crossed the placental barrier. Foetal systemic exposure was approximately the 
same as maternal blood exposure. 
Canagliflozin and its metabolites passed into milk with milk to plasma ratios of 1.05 to 1.55. 
Metformin 
Oral and intravenous PKI in rats was dose-proportional. Oral bioavailability in rats was 29 – 34%. 
In vitro studies indicate that transepithelial transfer of metformin in the intestine is at least partly 
by passive permeation.  
After oral administration of [14C]metformin to normal and diabetic mice, the highest 
concentrations of radioactivity were found in the small intestine, stomach, colon, salivary gland, 
kidney and liver. The mean binding value of metformin to rat plasma protein was 15%. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 25/130 
 
  
  
 
equilibrium plasma-to-blood cells partition ratios of metformin in rat plasma were 1.37, 1.25, and 
1.33 at initial blood concentrations of 1, 5, and 20 mg/mL, respectively. 
Metformin was the major radioactive component in plasma and urine from mice, rats, dogs and 
humans dosed with [14C]metformin. A metabolite, 1-methyl biguanide, was identified in rabbit 
plasma and urine. Studies with various inducers and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes 
indicated that metformin was metabolized via CYP2C11, 2D1, and 3A1/2 in rats. 
Metformin was excreted primarily in urine in rats and dogs. The estimated renal clearance value 
of metformin was considerably faster than the reported glomerular filtration rate in rats, 
indicating that unlike canagliflozin, metformin is subject to active renal secretion in rat renal 
tubules. Additionally, unlike canagliflozin metformin has been shown to be a substrate of the 
cationic organic transporters hOCT1 and hOCT2 and for the multidrug and toxin extrusion 
(MATE)-type transporter 1 (MATE1, involved in renal elimination of metformin), but not hOAT1, 
hOAT3 or hOCT2-A.  
Canagliflozin/Metformin 
No PK studies with the combination of canagliflozin/metformin have been conducted, this is 
agreed since toxicokinetic studies with the combination have been performed (see toxicity 
section for details) and sufficient clinical data are available. Interactions between canagliflozin 
and metformin based on cytochrome P450 metabolism are not likely since neither substance is 
metabolised by CYPs to a great extent nor induce or inhibit them. Furthermore, canagliflozin is 
secreted mainly via the faecal route while metformin is secreted via active renal secretion. 
Therefore, no interaction is expected following their co-administration. However, toxicokinetic 
results from repeat-dose and reproductive toxicity studies in rats have demonstrated increased 
AUC levels of metformin (up to 1.8-fold) when combined with canagliflozin at doses as low as 10 
mg/kg/day (~1.5-fold the human exposure after 300 mg canagliflozin). While canagliflozin, M5 
and M7 were not considered as substrates for OCT1 and OCT2, no information is provided 
regarding MATE1.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The combination canagliflozin and metformin has been studied in repeat-dose and developmental 
toxicity studies in rats. Data on canagliflozin are based on assessment reports of canagliflozin 
including studies on a hydroperoxide degradation product of canagliflozin, which was found 
during the development of the canagliflozin/metformin HCl film-coated tablet. Data on metformin 
are based on a review provided by the Applicant.

Canagliflozin 
Canagliflozin was well tolerated after a single dose in mice (oral gavage and i.p.) and rats (oral 
gavage). The maximum non-lethal oral dose of canagliflozin was 2000 mg/kg (high dose) in mice 
(both sexes) and male rats, and 1000 mg/kg in female rats. The maximum non-lethal i.p. dose

Mice 
In the 3-month, GLP, oral mouse toxicity study canagliflozin (0, 30, 100, 300 mg/kg/day) was 
well tolerated up to 100 mg/kg/day. At 300 mg/kg/day increases in kidney weights and 
mortalities were observed, therefore the NOAEL was set at 100 mg/kg/day what is in line with 
the NOEL observed in the carcinogenicity study in mice (see below). Safety margins at the 
NOAEL of 100 mg/kg/day of 40x and 10.9x for males and 49x and 13.2x for females, were 
calculated towards AUC exposure levels at the clinical dose of 100 mg and 300 mg (see table 
below). 
Rats 
In the 3- and 6-month, GLP, oral rat toxicity studies (0, 4, 20, 100 mg/kg/day canagliflozin) 
results were consistent between studies and can mainly be attributed to an exaggerated 
pharmacological effect of canagliflozin (increased urinary glucose and electrolyte excretion and 
urine volume reduced serum glucose, reduced body weight and body weight gain). Increased 
kidney weights, tubular dilatation, and mineralization were observed already at lower doses. 
Transitional hyperplasia of the renal pelvis was observed at 100 mg/kg/day (6-month study). 
The transitional hyperplasia had no atypia and was considered not to be preneoplastic. In the rat 
the limiting toxicity was hyperostosis which was accompanied by decreases in serum 
concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, PTH, and calcitonin. 
Furthermore, decreases in markers of bone resorption (serum C-telopeptide and urinary 
deoxypyridinoline) and bone formation (serum osteocalcin) were observed suggesting a decrease 
in bone turnover. To further investigate these findings various mechanistic studies were 
performed (see below). Based on these findings the NOAEL for the pivotal 6-month rat study was 
set at 4 mg/kg/day. This corresponds to safety margins of 2.0x and 0.5x for males and 3.1x and 
0.8x for females, with respect to human AUC exposure levels achieved with the therapeutic 100 
mg and 300 mg doses, respectively (see table below). 
The combination of canagliflozin and metformin was also tested in rats. No additional toxicities 
were observed in the combination groups up to the high dose of 100/300 mg/kg/day as 
compared to single administration of both compounds at the same doses. The Applicant 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014

hypothesised that rat-specific carbohydrate malabsorption caused by intestinal SGLT1 inhibitory 
activity of canagliflozin and subsequent increases in calcium absorption in the gut are causes for 
the observed hyperostosis. Since increases intestinal calcium absorption was also regarded as 
the reason for the neoplastic findings in rat, various mechanistic studies have been provided by 
the Applicant to verify these hypotheses:  
In a study to compare oral and s.c. dosing of canagliflozin to determine the site of action 
(gastrointestinal tract or systemic) for canagliflozin-mediated effects on hyperostosis and 
increased urinary calcium excretion, both routes of administration caused decreases in mean 
body weights and body weight gains. Urinalysis showed that, both routes of administration 
resulted in similarly elevated urinary calcium and phosphorus levels as well as similar increases 
in urine volume and excreted glucose. The Applicant explains that the effect of s.c. dosing on 
urinary calcium excretion and hyperostosis might be due to biliary excretion of glucuronidated 
canagliflozin and cleavage by glucuronidases in the gut leading to significant canagliflozin 
exposure to the gut lumen and subsequent increases of calcium absorption from the intestine, 
this is agreed.  
To further show that calcium absorption is increased after canagliflozin treatment (as a result of 
carbohydrate malabsorption, see section “Carcinogenicity” below) a mechanistic study was 
conducted. Treatment with canagliflozin increased calcium absorption by ~40% (based upon 
AUC0-24h for 45calcium) on the first day of treatment, and this increase was maintained 
throughout the 14-day treatment period. As a consequence, urinary calcium excretion was 
increased during canagliflozin treatment.  
Furthermore, effects of a low calcium diet (0.02% calcium) on bone changes in rats were 
investigated in four short term studies (2-weeks). Canagliflozin treatment-related hyperostosis 
was inhibited under short-term low calcium diet conditions with or without calcium 
supplementation; however, interpretation of the results was not warranted by adverse effects on 
bone due to the low calcium diet. 
Finally, the formation of hyperostosis in young and older rats was compared. Hyperostosis was 
only seen in younger but not in older rats and these findings correlated with histomorphometric 
bone findings seen only in younger rats. 
Rabbits 
In a 5-day dose range finding study (0, 10, 50, 500 mg/kg/day canagliflozin) in support of a pilot 
developmental toxicity study, no mortalities were observed and organ weights were not affected 
at any dose. At 10 and 50 mg/kg/day, there were no effects on clinical signs, body weight 
performance, food consumption, haematology, or clinical chemistry. The high dose caused 
reduced/absent faeces, body weight loss, and changes in clinical pathology parameters 
(increases in serum creatinine, slight decreases in Na, K, Ca, Cl). Urinary glucose excretion as an 
expected PD effect of canagliflozin was not investigated in this study. 
Dogs 
In a 1-year, GLP, oral dog toxicity study (0, 4, 30, 100 mg/kg/day canagliflozin) no compound-
related death and effects on food consumption, ophthalmoscopy, electrocardiography, physical 
examination, gross pathology, or histopathology findings were observed at any dose. Increases 
in urinary excretion of calcium and electrolytes were generally consistent with those observed in 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 32/130 
 
  
  
the 3-month, GLP, dog toxicity study. Minimal increases in excretion of GGT and NAG were not 
associated with renal pathology. No hyperostosis was observed at any dose, and there were no 
meaningful changes in bone turnover biomarkers or hormones regulating calcium metabolism. 
The NOAEL in this study was set at 100 mg/kg/day. Safety margins at the NOAEL of 100 
mg/kg/day of 76x and 20x for males and 72x and 19x for females, were calculated towards AUC 
exposure levels at the clinical dose of 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively (see table below). 
Several TK studies were affected by bioanalytical data manipulation by an individual. As a 
consequence the outcomes of these studies were not included in the non-clinical assessment by 
Janssen Research & Development. The conservative approach of the Applicant to invalidate the 
affected studies is supported, especially as sufficient data are available from the other toxicity 
studies or additionally performed bridging studies, which allow complete assessment of TK in all 
species. In general, systemic exposure to canagliflozin (AUC and Cmax) increased in a dose-
related manner in all species and no accumulation was observed. In dogs systemic exposure to 
canagliflozin increased less than dose proportional in both genders probably due to absorption 
saturation or observed emesis at the higher doses. There generally appeared to be slight gender 
differences in TK, with higher exposure to canagliflozin being observed in female mice and rats 
compared to males.

Genotoxicity 
A standard battery of genotoxicity tests was performed with canagliflozin. In conclusion, 
canagliflozin was tested in vitro in AMES and mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo in rat bone 
marrow micronucleus and liver Comet assays with no biologically relevant adverse observations.   
Carcinogenicity 
Two GLP-conform carcinogenicity studies were performed in CD-1 mice and SD rats. 
In the mouse study, no treatment related neoplasms nor palpable masses were observed. 
Furthermore, no canagliflozin-mediated effects on mortality, body weight, or body weight gain 
were observed. There was an increase in urinary tract obstruction which was considered to be a 
mouse urologic syndrome which is a relatively common genito-urinary disease of male mice of 
various strains, and is reported to be of multifactorial pathogenesis that frequently causes death 
in male mice on long-term toxicology studies. Therefore, the NOAEL for this study was set at 100 
mg/kg/day. Safety margins at the NOEL of 100 mg/kg/day of 28x and 7.4x for males and 51x 
and 14x for females were calculated towards AUC exposure levels at the clinical dose of 100 mg 
and 300 mg, respectively (see table above). 
In the rat study, in males and females a significantly increased incidence of benign 
pheochromocytomas in both sexes at 100 mg/kg/day was observed. In males there was also a 
treatment related effect for the incidence of malignant pheochromocytomas at the high dose. 
Survival-adjusted analysis of pheochromocytoma (benign and malignant) tumour rates were 
10%, 8%, 13%, and 57% in males at 0, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, showing the 
absence of a treatment-related effect at 30 mg/kg/day. Furthermore, survival was significantly 
increased in the 30 mg/kg/day dose groups. Therefore, the NOEL for pheochromocytomas was 
set at 30 mg/kg/day. 
Furthermore, in high dose animals of both sexes an increased incidence of renal tubular tumours 
(RTT) was observed. One of these tumours was of the amphophilic-vacuolar phenotype, all 
others were basophilic. In the mid dose two tumours of the amphophilic-vacuolar phenotype 
were found in male rats. These three amphiphilic–vacuolar tumours are considered to be 
spontaneous and not treatment-related. Furthermore, there was no dose-dependency. This was 
also confirmed by a pathology working group which conducted a blinded review of the renal 
histological findings. The NOEL for renal tubular tumours was set at 30 mg/kg/day. Safety 
margins for pheochromocytomas and RTT of 17x and 4.5x for males and 27x and 7.2x for 
females were calculated towards AUC exposure levels at the clinical dose of 100 mg and 300 mg, 
respectively (see table above). 
Benign Leydig cell tumours (LCTs) were detected at an increased incidence relative to controls 
across all dose groups in male rats. A NOEL could not be set based upon the observed incidence 
of tumours. Occurrence of LCTs might be due to decreases in testosterone levels and subsequent 
increases in LH levels upon canagliflozin treatment. The outcome of the conducted toxicity

Statistically significant tumour findings are shown in bold (Fisher’s Exact Test).  
To further understand the occurrence of pheochromocytomas and RTT in the high dose, an 
extensive programme of mechanistic studies was conducted (complemented by mechanistic 
studies on hyperostosis, see above). It was assumed that rat-specific carbohydrate 
malabsorption (due to SGLT1 inhibition in the gut) and its consequences such as decreased 
luminal pH, increased intestinal calcium absorption and consecutively increased urinary calcium 
excretion caused these tumour findings:  
In a first set of experiments it was shown that carbohydrate malabsorption was present in male 
rats at canagliflozin treatment. Canagliflozin caused a profound reduction (>90%) in 
3-O-methyl glucose (3-OMG) plasma levels indicating inhibition of glucose/galactose absorption 
relative to vehicle control. In a further study a significant increase in caecal glucose content was 
observed with 100 mg/kg/day canagliflozin treatment relative to vehicle control. Additionally, 
canagliflozin lead to a decrease in the jejunal/ileal pH a sign for increased carbohydrate 
fermentation. 
Feeding the rats with a glucose- and galactose-free diet (both sugars are a substrate of SGLT1) 
for 6 month prevented decrease in luminal pH, increased calcium excretion and hyperostosis. 
Hence, the interconnection between intestinal SGLT1 inhibition and increased calcium 
excretion/hyperostosis could be established (note that the organism has two possibilities to 
handle calcium that is absorbed in surplus, excreting it via kidney or storing it in bones; both 
options obviously were used). In this mechanistic study renal changes (hyperplasia, calcification 
and inflammation) were also markedly reduced. Adrenal changes (in particular hyperplasia) were 
also strongly reduced in the rats on glucose- and galactose-free diet. Hence, it can be expected 
that the pheochromocytomas observed in this species were also dependent on SGLT1 inhibition, 
although the pathophysiological link is less clear in this case. 
Neoplasms were not observed in carcinogenicity studies with the recently approved dapagliflozin. 
At very high dapagliflozin doses in a mechanistic study, however, similar increase in urine 
calcium and hyperostosis occurred, findings that may reflect SGLT1-related carbohydrate 
malabsorption.

Reproduction Toxicity 
The  complete  program  on  reproductive  toxicology  as  requested  by  ICH  S5  was  performed  with 
oral  application  of  canagliflozin  alone.  An  additional  study  on  embryo-foetal  development  was 
conducted  using  the  combination  of  canagliflozin  and  metformin.  Data  investigating  possible 
effects  of  metformin  on  reproduction  were  presented  from  the  public  domain.  Canagliflozin 
showed  no  effects  on  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  at  exposure  margins  of  73x  or 
19x to human therapeutic exposure at a dose of 100 mg or 300 mg. Fertility of male and female 
rats  was  unaffected  by  metformin  at  doses  up  to  600  mg/kg/day  representing  an  exposure  of 
about  3x  the  human  daily  dose  of  2000  mg  based  on  body  surface  area.  These  findings  are 
included in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
In the embryo-foetal development studies in rats, skeletal anomalies associated with the state of 
ossification  were  observed  in  foetuses  treated  with  100  mg/kg/day  canagliflozin  alone  and  in 
foetuses of all dose groups treated with the combination of canagliflozin and metformin starting 
at a dose of 10/300 mg/kg/day canagliflozin/metformin. The Applicant contributed these findings 
towards maternal toxicity. However, maternal toxicity did not result in a decrease of foetal body 
weights, which would have been expected as a prerequisite for developmental delays in foetuses. 
Therefore, other effects of canagliflozin like changes in calcium homeostasis might be responsible 
for  skeletal  ossification  delays  in  foetuses.  Additionally,  since  effects  of  metformin  plus 
canagliflozin were more prominent than for canagliflozin alone, the combination seems to have a 
negative synergistic effect on skeletal development. These findings are included in section 5.3 of 
the SmPC. 
No  effects  of  canagliflozin  were  observed  on  embryo-foetal  development  in  the  rabbit  with  a 
safety margin of 70x or 19x to human therapeutic exposure at a dose of 100 mg or 300 mg. No 
effects on fetal parameters including gross external, soft tissue, or skeletal alterations were seen 
in  the  rabbit treated  with doses of  up  to  140  mg/kg/day  metformin  alone.  However,  metformin 
doses applied in the rabbit study were below human therapeutic exposures. 
In  the  study  on  pre-/postnatal  development,  the  NOAEL  was  established  at  100  mg/kg/day 
canagliflozin (safety margin of 73x or 19x to human therapeutic exposure at a dose of 100 mg or 
300  mg).  Effects  on  offspring  functional  development  and  litter  parameters  in  F1-dams  were 
noticed at this dose, however, a correlation could be shown towards low absolute body weights in 
offspring and F1-dams.  
Effects observed in the juvenile toxicity study with canagliflozin in rats were in general consistent 
with  effects  observed  in  adult  rats.  However,  pelvic  dilatation  in  male  rats  was  only  partially 
reversible;  therefore,  the  NOAEL  was  established  at  4  mg/kg/day  corresponding  to  AUC  values 
up to 2.4x and 0.6x the AUC for the 100 and 300 mg doses in humans, respectively. Persistent 
renal  findings  in  juvenile  rats  can  most  likely  be  attributed  to  reduced  ability  of  the  developing 
rat  kidney  to  handle  canagliflozin-increased  urine  volumes,  as  functional  maturation  of  the  rat 
kidney  continues  through  6  weeks  of  age.  By  comparison,  human  anatomic  renal  maturation 
occurs in utero during the second and third trimesters, while functional maturation continues for 
the first 2 years of life.

Local Tolerance  
The Applicant has provided two studies assessing the eye irritation and skin sensitization 
potential of canagliflozin to support the development of safe handling procedures during the 
manufacturing process.  
In an eye irritation bovine corneal opacity-permeability assay, canagliflozin was classified as a 
borderline non to mild eye irritant. Results from a skin sensitization murine local lymph node 
assay indicated that canagliflozin was not a contact sensitizer. 
Phototoxicity 
In vitro and in vivo phototoxicity studies were performed because canagliflozin shows UV 
absorption with an absorption peak at 291 nm. In a photo-Ames test canagliflozin was not 
considered to be photomutagenic. 
In an in vitro neutral red uptake assay canagliflozin was considered to be photosensitizing in 
vitro. The photosensitizing potential of canagliflozin was further tested in pigmented rats 
following oral administration. Canagliflozin did not cause ocular photosensitization at any dose 
level in the same study. The NOAEL for photosensitization in pigmented rats was set at 
5 mg/kg/day. Canagliflozin induced skin photosensitization (mild to moderate erythema and 
oedema) at ≥ 50 mg/kg/day after UV-A and UV-B light exposure. At 500 mg/kg/day skin 
reactions were consistent with phototoxicity (1/5 M and 3/5 F).  
Metformin 
The Applicant provided a review on the toxicology of metformin. Metformin is a well-known 
substance and there is an extensive amount of clinical experience with metformin. From a 
preclinical point of view, this is considered adequate. 
The LD 50 values for metformin in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs were 2400, 1770, 552, and 375 
mg/kg, respectively. 
Chronic toxicity studies were carried out in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. A 52-week oral study 
in mice reported no adverse effects at doses up to and including 450 mg/kg/day. This is 
approximately 8.8x the maximum human dose (2550 mg) on a mg/kg basis for a 50 kg 
individual. The highest dose of 1500 mg/kg had decreased body weight gain compared to 
controls, and tubular dilation was observed in the kidney in both sexes and increased tubular 
vacuolization was observed in males. 
Studies up to 78 weeks in rats showed the non-toxic dose to be 120 mg/kg which on a mg/kg 
basis for a 50 kg individual is approximately 2.4x the maximum human dose (2550 mg). Higher 
doses in the rat resulted in decreases in weight gain and food consumption, metabolic acidosis 
(as reported in humans), and salivary gland toxicity.  
In 6-month and 78-week oral studies in the dog, the minimal toxic dose was 50 mg/kg or about 
equal to the maximum top human dose (2550 mg) on a mg/kg basis. Higher doses produced 
mortality with symptoms of GI distress and vascular lesions and degenerative changes in the 
brain, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle. In a subsequent study supporting the development of 
a metformin/sitagliptin combination product, mortality was observed in dogs at a dose of 50 
mg/kg metformin after 5 weeks of oral dosing. Although a definitive cause of death could not be

determined, a metformin-induced lactic acidosis was postulated to underlie the 
morbidity/mortality observed. In a follow-up study in dogs, metformin was well tolerated at a 
dose of 20 mg/kg for 16 weeks. Exposure in dogs at 20 mg/kg is similar to that in humans at a 
2000 mg human dose. 
Rhesus monkeys tolerated 180 mg/kg or approximately 3.6x (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum 
human dose (2550 mg), without any noted toxic effects in a 2-year oral study. The 360 mg/kg 
high dose (7.2x human dose) caused 75% mortality, severe gastrointestinal distress, decreased 
weight gain, and cytoplasmic changes in hepatocytes and the adrenal gland. 
Metformin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, 
chromosomal aberration assay, cytogenetic assay, or in vivo micronucleus assay. No increased 
tumour incidence was observed in a 2-year study in mice. No tumorigenic potential was observed 
in rats except for an increase in benign stromal uterine polyps in females. Extensive clinical 
experience does not indicate an increased tumorigenic potential. 
Canagliflozin/metformin 
Repeat-dose toxicity/Toxicokinetics 
The combination of canagliflozin and metformin was tested in repeat-dose and developmental 
toxicity studies in rats. No additional toxicities were observed in the combination groups up to 
the high dose of 100/300 mg/kg/day as compared to single administration of both compounds at 
the same doses. It can be concluded that that the combination of canagliflozin and metformin is 
well tolerated and no toxicities can be expected due to drug-drug interactions. Co-administration 
of both compounds did not alter exposure levels of canagliflozin as compared to single 
administration. Slightly increased AUC levels of metformin (1.4 to 1.8-fold) were detected when 
combined with canagliflozin in the mid dose (20/300 mg/kg/day, which is ~3.4-fold the human 
exposure after 300 mg canagliflozin) and the high dose (100/300 mg/kg/day, which is ~16.2-
fold the human exposure after 300 mg canagliflozin), respectively.   
Reproductive and developmental toxicology 
Please refer to the respective section of canagliflozin above. 
Impurities 
JNJ-54526888-AAA, a hydroperoxide degradation product of canagliflozin was found during the 
development of the canagliflozin/metformin HCl film-coated tablet. It was found to be positive in 
an in vitro Ames in two Salmonella strains. 
JNJ-54526888-AAA was within specifications but higher than the 1.5 µg/day (corresponding to 5 
ppm for a 300 mg daily dose) ICH default limit for life-time clinical exposure of genotoxic 
impurities/degradants, the threshold of toxicological concern. 
Based on the analyses of batches so far the Applicant proposed a specification limit of 220 ppm 
equivalent to a maximum daily intake (DI) of 66 µg/d based on the proposed maximum 
therapeutic daily dose. The DI was considered justified by the Applicant based on occupational 
data (endogenous peroxide production and permissible daily exposure (PDE) calculation derived 
from repeated dose toxicology studies with hydrogen peroxide).  
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 38/130 
 
  
  
Considering that the limit for hydrogen peroxide in drinking water is 100 µg/l and hydrogen 
peroxide is also naturally occurring in fruits and vegetables up to mg-amounts/kg the additional 
peroxide exposure from canagliflozin hydroperoxide is minimal and considered acceptable. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant provided an Environmental Risk Assessment for both active ingredients according 
to the current EMA Guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, June 2006) including full study 
reports. The environmental risk assessment for metformin hydrochloride and canagliflozin is 
completed. 
Considering the submitted data, the active ingredients canagliflozin and metformin are not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. Canagliflozin and metformin are not PBT substances.  
But Metformin is persistent in sediment of water-sediment systems (OECD 308) according to 
calculations of the assessment team. Furthermore, 4 relevant (>10%) transformation products 
were identified in the water-sediment system for canagliflozin. 
This has been adequately reflected in the product information.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Sufficient pharmacodynamic activity of canagliflozin on SGLT2 could be demonstrated in rat and 
human in vitro models and in several in vivo models of mice, rats, and dogs. 
No functional or binding assays were performed showing an inhibitory effect of canagliflozin on 
SGLT2 and SGLT1 of other species (mouse, rabbit, and dog) which were also used in the 
toxicology programme. However, primary and/or pharmacodynamic activity of canagliflozin has 
been sufficiently shown in all species included. Therefore, it is not deemed necessary to 
investigate canagliflozin’s action on SGLT2 from these species in vitro. 
In in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies canagliflozin showed no effects on the 
cardiovascular and respiratory system and did not induce neurobehavioral changes. Safety 
margins are sufficient. 
Pharmacokinetics 
In humans the primary metabolic clearance pathway of canagliflozin is through its direct 
glucuronidation in liver whereas in animal species oxidation is the major metabolic pathway, 
yielding various metabolites not present in humans in vivo (e.g. M1, M2, M4, M6, M8). Human 
plasma levels of O-glucuronides M5 and M7 approached a peak of ~30% of the sample 
radioactivity. These two metabolites, M5 and M7, were not found in rat plasma at low doses. 
However, M7 was the major metabolite found in rat bile, M5 was also present but to a lesser 
extent, independent of the dose. Furthermore M7 was formed in rat hepatocytes. In conclusion, 
rats are forming M5 and M7 and are expected to be exposed to these metabolites to a low extent 
although they cannot be detected in plasma by the methods used. As these metabolites are O-
glucuronides and showed no pharmacological activity and showed no activity against CYPs and 
other transporters, they are not considered as a toxicological concern.

Toxicokinetic results from combination studies in rats have demonstrated increased AUC levels of 
metformin (up to 1.8-fold) when combined with canagliflozin at doses as low as 10 mg/kg/day 
(~1.5-fold the human exposure after 300 mg canagliflozin), with NOEL below human exposure. 
Although no apparent interaction was observed in clinical study NAP1004 at 
canagliflozin/metformin doses of 100/1000 mg/kg, a slight increase in metformin exposure 
(20%) was observed in the clinical interaction study DIA1028 at 300/2000 mg/kg. Canagliflozin, 
M5 and M7 are not considered as substrates for OCT1 and OCT2. No data have been provided for 
the renal metformin transporter MATE1. Since no clinically relevant PK interaction between 
canagliflozin and metformin, a main substrate of MATE1, have been observed, it is highly unlikely 
that any potential inhibition of MATE1 by canagliflozin would lead to clinically relevant drug-drug 
interactions. 
No  data  were  discussed  concerning  placental  or  milk  transfer  of  metformin.  However,  human 
data about the use of metformin while breast-feeding can be found in the public domain.  
Toxicology 
In general, canagliflozin was well tolerated after repeated dosing in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs. 
Mostly, toxicity findings could be attributed to an exaggerated pharmacological effect of 
canagliflozin (increased urinary glucose and electrolyte excretion and urine volume reduced 
serum glucose, reduced body weight and body weight gain). Increases in kidney weights and 
tubular dilatation were primarily observed in rats already at low doses and in the high doses in 
mice and dogs in the 3-month study (200 mg/kg/day, which was later reduced to 100 
mg/kg/day). No increase in kidney weights was observed in the one year dog study (high dose 
100 mg/kg/day). In the rat the limiting toxicity was hyperostosis.  
The Applicant hypothesised that rat-specific carbohydrate malabsorption caused by intestinal 
SGLT1 inhibitory activity of canagliflozin and subsequent increases in calcium absorption in the 
gut are causes for the observed hyperostosis. In the rat canagliflozin is absorbed slowly (Cmax at 
4-7 hours) with a low bioavailabilty (35%), which might lead to high canagliflozin concentrations 
in the gut lumen and a consecutive inhibition of SGLT1. As a consequence, glucose and galactose 
are malabsorbed which can result in increased intestinal calcium absorption due to pH lowering in 
the intestine caused by carbohydrate fermentation. Since increased intestinal calcium absorption 
was also regarded as the reason for the neoplastic findings in rat, various mechanistic studies 
have been performed by the Applicant to verify these hypotheses (see also discussion on 
carcinogenicity below). These mechanistic studies provide sufficient evidence and sound 
explanations of the causes of hyperostosis and increased urinary calcium excretion. As 
hyperostosis was not observed in other animal species and changes in boner markers and 
calcium excretion were not observed in clinical trials, hyperostosis is not expected to occur in 
humans. The CHMP considered that this hypothesis is plausible. 
In the rabbit, the primary PD effect of canagliflozin, increased urinary glucose excretion was not 
demonstrated. Simultaneously, in vitro studies on the rabbit SGLT2 are lacking. Thus, the 
suitability of this species (in respect to responsiveness to the study drug) for studying toxicology 
was not directly shown. On the other hand, there were clear signs of toxicity observed in the 
study which are in line with SGLT2 inhibition, in particular weight loss, increases in serum 
creatinine and decrease in serum sodium. Thus, it is likely that canagliflozin is effective in 
rabbits.

The observed incidences of renal tubular tumours (RTT) and pheochromocytomas were 
addressed by the Applicant in various mechanistic studies e.g. monitoring carbohydrate 
malabsorption or feeding glucose- and-galactose free diets. These studies demonstrated that 
renal changes (hyperplasia, calcification and inflammation) were most likely (as already expected 
from physiological considerations) a consequence of the need for the kidney to excrete unusual 
high amounts of calcium. This strongly supports the assumption that renal tumours that 
developed on the basis of the mentioned renal alterations were rat-specific and dependent on 
carbohydrate malabsorption that was not observed in humans. Furthermore, related side effects 
of glucose malabsorption such as flatulence or diarrhoea were not present in phase 3 studies, 
further demonstrating that this is a rat specific phenomenon.  
Concerning pheochromocytomas it can be assumed that carbohydrate malabsorption, which 
among others may lead to shortage of glucose in the organism, along with the probably energy-
dependent need of excreting high amounts of calcium induces a high adrenergic tone in the 
animal. This could lead to the observed adrenal hyperplasia. But even if this speculative 
mechanism is not true, it is reassuring that the link between adrenal hyperplasia and rat-specific 
carbohydrate malabsorption could be confirmed.  
Nevertheless, the provided hypothesis relies on the fact that canagliflozin is poorly absorbed in 
the rat, with a bioavailability of 35%, leading to increased local concentrations in the gut capable 
of inhibiting SGLT1. The Applicant has provided a theoretical estimate of the local concentrations 
of canagliflozin in the gut, comparing rats and humans. The calculations arrive at a 12-fold 
higher concentration in rats at 100 mg/kg (dose which resulted in pheochromocytoma and renal 
tubule tumours), as compared to humans treated with 300 mg (the highest clinical dose). As 
pointed out by the Applicant, the actual ratio is likely to be higher, considering the differences in 
pharmacokinetics between rats and humans. The estimated gut concentrations of canagliflozin in 
both rats and humans are orders of magnitude above the in vitro IC50 for inhibition of SGLT1. 
Given that canagliflozin is a competitive SGLT inhibitor and that local glucose as well as drug 
concentrations are likely to vary depending on meal intakes, it is agreed that it is difficult to 
determine the exact concentration needed to significantly inhibit intestinal SGLT1. The Applicant 
refers to data from one clinical and one rat study, arguing that the most relevant manner to 
compare rats and humans is to examine results from studies in which SGLT1-dependent glucose 
absorption was assessed. The results of these two studies clearly demonstrate the difference 
between rats and humans, showing glucose malabsorption in rats at 100 mg/kg but not in 
humans at 300 mg. It was possible to demonstrate inhibition of a SGLT1 substrate in rats, 
further strengthening the hypothesis of low oral bioavailability in the rat, leading to a longer 
intestinal dwelling time with consequently higher local concentration of canagliflozin. 
Occurrence of LCTs might be due to decreases in testosterone levels and subsequent increases in 
LH levels upon canagliflozin treatment. The outcome of the conducted toxicity studies were LH 
and testosterone levels were measured are controversial and do not give a final mechanistic 
explanation of incidences of LCTs in the rat. Nevertheless, the rat has been shown to be 
susceptible to develop LCTs in other carcinogenicity studies by various non-genotoxic agents. 
Furthermore, LCTs found in rats after canagliflozin treatment were mostly benign. It can be 
concluded, that occurrence of LCTs is most likely species specific. 
In  the  study  on  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  in  SD  rats,  canagliflozin  showed  no 
effects on male and female fertility and reproductive performance.

In the studies on embryo-foetal development in rats, skeletal anomalies associated with the state 
of  ossification  were  observed  in  foetuses  of  the  high  dose  canagliflozin  alone  group  and  in  all 
canagliflozin/metformin-treatment  groups.  Skeletal  findings  might  be  attributed  to  disturbances 
in  calcium  homeostasis,  in  particular  an  increase  in  calcium  excretion  in  dams  treated  with 
canagliflozin.  Additionally,  since  effects  of  metformin  plus  canagliflozin  were  more  prominent 
than for canagliflozin alone, the combination might have a negative synergistic effect on skeletal 
development.  This  is  adequately  addressed  in  the  SmPC.  It  is  acknowledged  that  the  bone 
structures affected by canagliflozin/metformin are similar to the structures affected by metformin 
alone.  Due  to  a  pharmacokinetic  interaction  between  canagliflozin  and  metformin,  the  negative 
synergistic effect is most likely due to increased metformin exposure. 
The  NOAEL  for  offspring  functional  development  and  reproductive  performance  was  at  the  high 
dose of 100 mg/kg/day canagliflozin, as effects observed on development in high dose pups (air 
righting  response,  sexual  maturation)  and  on  pregnancy  parameters  of  high  dose  F1-dams 
correlated with low absolute body weights of offspring and dams. 
Effects observed in the juvenile toxicity study with canagliflozin in rats were in general consistent 
with  effects  observed  in  adult  rats.  However,  pelvic  dilatation  in  male  rats  was  only  partially 
reversible.  Persistent  renal  findings  in  juvenile  rats  can  most  likely  be  attributed  to  reduced 
ability of the developing rat kidney to handle canagliflozin-increased urine volumes, as functional 
maturation of the rat kidney continues through 6 weeks of age. By comparison, human anatomic 
renal  maturation  occurs  in  utero  during  the  second  and  third  trimesters,  while  functional 
maturation continues for the first 2 years of life. 
Canagliflozin was considered to be photosensitizing in vitro and showed skin photosensitization in 
pigmented rats. However, clinical data (see Clinical AR for detailed discussion) indicated that 
phototoxicity would play only a role at light intensities beyond bright daylight. 
From combination studies in rats it can be concluded that that the combination of canagliflozin 
and metformin is well tolerated and no toxicities can be expected due to drug-drug interactions.  
Based on the analyses of batches so far the Applicant proposed a specification limit of 220 ppm 
for the impurity canagliflozin hydroperoxide equivalent to a maximum daily intake (DI) of 66 
µg/d based on the proposed maximum therapeutic daily dose. The DI was considered justified by 
the Applicant based on occupational data (endogenous peroxide production and permissible daily 
exposure (PDE) calculation derived from repeated dose toxicology studies with hydrogen 
peroxide). Considering that the limit for hydrogen peroxide in drinking water is 100 µg/l and 
hydrogen peroxide is also naturally occurring in fruits and vegetables up to mg-amounts/kg the 
additional peroxide exposure from canagliflozin hydroperoxide is minimal and considered 
acceptable. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The PD activity of canagliflozin has sufficiently been demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo models. 
Metformin is a well-established substance. Small PK interactions between canagliflozin and 
metformin could not be excluded based on the non-clinical data, but clinical studies revealed no 
clinically relevant effects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 44/130 
 
  
  
In non-clinical animal species canagliflozin has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and 
toxicity findings are generally related to an exaggerated pharmacological effect of canagliflozin. 
Hyperostosis, renal and tumour findings are considered to be a rat specific phenomenon. Rat 
skeletal findings might be attributed to disturbances in calcium homeostasis. 
Environmental Risk Assessment: Considering the submitted data, the active ingredients 
canagliflozin and metformin are not expected to pose a risk to the environment. Canagliflozin 
and metformin are not PBT substances, but Metformin is persistent in the environment. This has 
been adequately reflected in the product information.

In addition, in order to support the application for CANA/MET IR FDC 6 biopharmaceutical studies 
were submitted. Study DIA 1037 investigated the food effect of 150/1,000-mg CANA/MET IR FDC 
in 24 healthy subjects. Study DIA1036 was a pilot study that evaluated the relative 
bioavailability of the CANA/MET IR FDC tablets (6 different dose strengths, 2 of them only 
developed for the US market) to single dose coadministration of Canagliflozin and Glucophage. 
Studies DIA1039, DIA1052, DIA1051, and DIA1038, were bioequivalence studies for the to-be-
marketed CANA/MET IR FDC tablet strengths of 50/850 mg, 150/850 mg, 50/1,000 mg, and 
150/1,000 mg respectively. No additional specific clinical pharmacology studies were conducted 
with the CANA/MET IR FDC. In addition, one study was submitted that investigated the food 
effect (DIA 1037). 
Two PK interaction studies between canagliflozin and metformin are of relevance for this 
application. They were already submitted in the dossier supporting the application for the 
canagliflozin monotherapy (studies NAP1004 and DIA1028). No additional human pharmacology 
studies were provided for the coadministration of canagliflozin and metformin.  
Information for metformin was provided by the Applicant based on the SmPC of Glucophage. No 
new PK or PD data for metformin were submitted and the well known data for metformin are not 
discussed in detail in this overview. 
Pharmaceutical development 
Canagliflozin 
Absolute oral bioavailability was investigated in study DIA 1021. In vivo metabolism of 14C-
canagliflozin was studied in faeces, urine, and plasma collected from healthy male subjects after 
a single oral dose of 192 mg 14C-canagliflozin in a mass-balance study (study NAP1006).

Single dose PK was investigated in healthy subjects in study NAP1001, DIA 1001 and DIA 1015, 
multiple dose PK in Study NAP1008, DIA1030, and DIA 1032. In subjects with T2DM single and 
multiple dose PK was investigated in study NAP1002, DIA 1007, and DIA 1023, and in addition 
(supportive) in study TA-7284-02. In addition to the phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies, PK 
and/or PD assessments of canagliflozin from 2 phase 2 studies and 3 phase 3 studies were 
included in population PK analyses.  
Analytical methods were validated and appropriately described for the determination of 
canagliflozin sponsored by Janssen Pharmaceutical Research and Development by LC-MS/MS, for 
the metabolites M5 and M7 (LC-MS/MS methods), the α-anamer and the drugs determined in the 
interactions studies. PK data and statistical analyses were appropriate. 
Major findings related to GCP were reported by the Applicant for some studies and the PK data 
for canagliflozin from these studies (NAP1001, NAP1002, NAP1004, NAP1005, NAP1006, and 
NAP1008) were not considered reliable and therefore were not presented. Only PK data from 
metabolites and PD data were reported from these studies.   
The bridging strategy included preclinical considerations, cross study PK comparisons, PD 
comparisons, gastro plus simulations, the investigation of physicochemical characteristics and 
two relative bioequivalence studies (DIA1017 and (supportive) TA-7284-03). All data obtained 
with the different formulations used during the clinical program (oral suspension, tablets with 
high-shear granulation (HSG), fluid-bed granulation (FBG), non-particle-engineered and particle-
engineered (NPE, PE), without and with film-coating) were transferable to the to be marketed 
formulation. 
Cana/MET IR FDC 
Bioequivalence between the FDC and canagliflozin and Glucophage, when coadministered, was 
demonstrated in 5 bioequivalence studies (1 pilot study with 6 different strengths and 4 pivotal 
bioequivalence studies). For the 50/1000, 150/850 and 150/1000 mg the bioavailability of 
metformin was slightly lower in the FDC tablet as compared to the combined administration of 
both drugs. However, the BE criteria were met in all studies for all strengths ((50/850 mg, 
50/1000mg, 150/850 mg, and 150/1000 mg CANA/MET) and bioeqivalence between the FDC and 
the Coadministration of Canagliflozin and Glucophage can be assumed. In addition, in the pilot 
study investigating 6 dose strengths there were no statistically significant differences in RTG and 
UGE and there were no relevant differences in plasma glucose levels between the FDC treatment 
and the coadministered treatment in each cohort.

Absorption 
Canagliflozin was rapidly absorbed, tmax was approximately 1 to 2 hours and was independent 
of the dose. In-vitro investigations in colon carcinoma-derived (Caco)-2 cells suggested an 
intermediate permeability and the involvement of the efflux pump P-gp in the human intestine. 
The oral bioavailability was about 65%.  
There was no effect of food on PK as demonstrated in a single dose study (DIA 1043) with 300 
mg tablets. Similarly there was no food effect on PD parameters (Study NAP1001, part 2)). 
Canagliflozin may therefore be taken with or without food. However Vokanamet should be taken 
orally twice daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal undesirable effects associated with 
metformin. This was reflected in the SmPC. 
For CANA/MET IR FDC intake of food increased AUC values for canagliflozin (upper 90% CI 
values below 125%, clinically not relevant) and decreased Cmax values (lower value of the 
90%CI was below 80%). The effect on canagliflozin is not considered clinically relevant. A lower 
Cmax of metformin after food intake is in accordance with the information provided in the SPC of 
Glucophage. Since metformin is administered with or after food due to tolerability, and PK of 
canagliflozin is not influenced by food intake, overall administration of the FDC with food or after 
food intake is supported by the data.

Distribution 
The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) of canagliflozin following a single 
i.v. infusion in healthy subjects was 119 L. This suggests an extensive tissue distribution. There 
was no relevant redistribution to blood cells. In vitro plasma protein binding of canagliflozin was 
98.3% to 98.5%, predominantly to human serum albumin (97.3%). 
Since binding of metformin to plasma proteins is negligible no interaction between Canagliflozin 
and metformin at the level of protein binding is expected. 
Elimination 
In plasma, mainly unchanged canagliflozin was measured (about 57% of the plasma exposure). 
Among the metabolites the inactive o-glucuronides M5 and M7 were most important, accounting 
for 1.9 – 30% and 16 – 29% of the plasma exposure, depending on the time point. In vitro other 
metabolic pathways in human hepatocytes were carboxylation (M6, 2%) and monooxygenation 
(M9, 1%). Metabolite M9 was also found in human liver microsomes. It accounts for 2.4% to 
3.7% of the total drug-related components in human plasma. Metabolites M7 (17% of a 
radioactively labeled dose) and M5 (13%) were found in urine, M9 (7.0%) and M7 (3.2%), but 
not M5 were detected in feces. Anomerisation of the β-anomer to the α-anomer did not occur to 
a clinically relevant amount. 
The clearance of canagliflozin was about 12.2 L/h indicating a low clearance drug. Mean t1/2 was 
dose independent and was between 10.6 and 13.1 hours over the clinical studies for doses 
between 100 and 300 mg qd. Oral doses were excreted by approximately 60% via feces and by 
about 33% by the kidneys. Across studies, renal excretion of unchanged canaglifozin was below 
1%, and of M5 and M7 13.3 and 17.2%, respectively. To the contrary, in the feces unchanged 
canagliflozin accounted for 40% and the metabolites M9 and M7 were detected only in low 
concentrations (7.0 and 3.2%, respectively). De-glucuronidation in the feces may be a possible 
explanation for the absence of M5 in feces. No enterohepatic pathway of clinical relevance was 
observed.  
Whereas the role of genetic polymorphisms for UGT2B4 remains to be determined, there was a 
robust finding of increased exposure in the range of about 26 - 54% of canagliflozin carrying 
UGT1A9*3 alleles. Since the individual values were within the overall observed dose range 
adaption in patients with known UGT1A9 and UGT2B4 alleles is not considered necessary.  
Since metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine no interaction at the level of the a.m. 
metabolite pathways is expected. 
Dose and time dependency 
Cmax and AUC values of canagliflozin increased dose proportionally (50 – 300 mg qd) after 
single dose and multiple dose administration. There was no time dependent accumulation when 
canagliflozin was administered at multiple doses. The exposure was about 36% higher at steady 
state. Steady state was reached after about 4 days of qd dosing with 50 to 300 mg canagliflozin. 
The exposure (AUC) was not different between qd administration proposed for canagliflozin 
monotherapy and and the bid administration proposed for CANA/MET IR FDC. 
For metformin an inverse relationship was described between the dose ingested and the relative 
absorption with therapeutic doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 g, suggesting the involvement of an 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 51/130 
 
  
  
active, saturable absorption process. Irrespectively, a bid or tid administration of metformin is 
established.  
Variability 
For canagliflozin the intra-subject coefficient of variation ranged from 15.2% to 22.1% for Cmax 
and from 4.8% to 9.4% for AUC. The inter-subject coefficient of variation for Cmax and AUC in 
healthy subjects ranged from19.1% to 27.5% in a pooled analysis following single and multiple-
dose administration of 100 and 300 mg qd canagliflozin (see Table 47 and Table 48 above). For 
t1/2 following single-dose administration, the inter-subject coefficient of variation was between 
20.1% and 25.0%. Known variability in PK of metformin does not necessarily translate to 
variability in PD effects. 
Special populations 
For canagliflozin there were no relevant differences in the PK of canagliflozin between healthy 
subjects and patients with T2DM. In patients with decreased renal function (CLCR<50 ml/min) 
exposure to canagliflozin was increased, although only <1% of canagliflozin is excreted renally. 
For metformin in the presence of normal renal function, there are no differences between single- 
or multiple-dose PK of metformin between patients with T2DM and healthy subjects, nor is there 
any accumulation of metformin in either group at usual clinical doses. 
Patients with severe hepatic failure with a Child-Pugh-Score >9 were not investigated. These 
patients should be excluded from the therapy. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic failure 
there were only mild changes, i.e. Cmax and AUC values increased by less than 11%. Oral 
clearance was unchanged and the differences in volume of distribution and t1/2 are not 
considered of clinical relevance. In conclusion, dose adaption is not considered necessary in 
patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment for PK reasons. Since the use of metformin is 
not recommended in patients with hepatic failure due to safety reasons, these PK considerations 
are of minor importance for the CANA/Met IR FDC. 
In subjects with renal failure there was an increase in exposure that could not be explained by 
changes in renal clearance per se since renal clearance of unchanged canagliflozin is <1%. AUC 
was higher in subjects with a CLCR 50 to <80 mL/min by about 17%, with CLCR 30 to <50 
mL/min by about 63%, and with a CLCR <30 mL/min by about 50%. No change was observed in 
patients with end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis.  
Since metformin is contraindicated in patients of at least moderate renal failure, the restrictions 
for CANA/MET in these patients are irrespective of changes in PK of canagliflozin. 
In females numerically higher AUC values were observed for canagliflozin. This is not considered 
of clinical relevance in the absence of other factors increasing exposure. No gender specific dose 
adaption of Metformin is necessary based on PK. 
There was no relevant difference in PK, dose proportionality and exposure between Western, 
Japanese and Indian subjects. A moderately higher exposure in subjects weighing <78.2 kg as 
compared to subjects weighing >95.2 kg by 33% is not considered of clinical relevance.  
However, in the elderly an increase in AUC values by about 29% could be relevant. Since in 
elderly subjects BP lowering effects may be more relevant for safety reasons a dose titration 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 52/130 
 
  
  
 
starting at 50 mg bid is appropriate. Since excretion of Metformin depends on renal function, 
renal function in the elderly should be regularly monitored. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies Canagliflozin (10 μM [4,440 ng/mL]) did not induce 
CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 activity in human hepatocytes. In human liver microsomes 
canagliflozin and M7 were weak inhibitors of CYP2B6 and 2C8. Probe specifically CYP2C9 and 
CYP3A4 was also weakly inhibited by canagliflozin, with testosterone as a substrate, but not with 
midazolam. In-vitro investigations indicated potential interactions at the level of P-gp, MDR1 and 
MRP2 transporters, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 that were partially addressed in clinical DDIs. 
Canagliflozin is primarily metabolized by glucuronidation. The isoenzyme CYP3A4 is involved in 
the formation of metabolite M9. Interactions studies are not considered necessary for CYP 3A4. 
Clinically relevant interactions were observed only for Rifampin and Digoxin. 
A clinically relevant interaction occurred at the level of UGTs involved in the formation of M5 and 
M7. Rifampin mediated enzyme induction decreased plasma Cmax of canagliflozin by 30% and 
AUC by 52%, respectively. The nonspecific inhibitor of UGTs probenecid, on the other hand, 
increased plasma Cmax,ss and AUCτ,ss values for canagliflozin by about 13% and 21%, 
respectively. In addition, cyclosporine, a potent inhibitor of P-gp increased AUC values by 23%.  
HCTZ increased canagliflozin AUC by about 8 – 12%. More importantly, there was a numerical 
increase in orthostatic hypotension, when both drugs were coadministered. Such patients should 
be treated with 50 mg bid of the canagliflozin component and a potential increase in the dose 
should mainly depend on tolerability  
Canagliflozin increased Cmax of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel by 22%, but did not change 
the overall exposure. Cmax and AUCinf of simvastatin and of simvastatin acid were slightly 
increased by canagliflozin by 9 – 12% (simvastatin) and 18 – 26% (simvastatin acid), 
respectively. No relevant PK interactions were observed at the level of CYP2C9 for Gliburide and 
Warfarin INF values were also not affected. Canagliflozin did not change the PK of Metformin by a 
clinically relevant amount. Co-administration of canagliflozin increased the Cmax of digoxin by 
about 36% and AUC levels by about 20%. Since Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic range, this 
interaction is mentioned in the SmPC. The assumed mechanism, an inhibition at the level of P-
gp, is also relevant for other digitalis glycosides.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Overall, the mechanism of action and PD effects of canagliflozin were well characterized in the 
clinical pharmacology program. Canagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 and, with lower affinity, SGLT1. 
In healthy subjects, canagliflozin increased mean 24-hour urinary glucose excretion (UGE24h) 
by up to 60 – 70 g. The maximal effect was achieved at doses ≥200 mg qd. The 24-hour mean 
renal threshold of glucose excretion (RTG) decreased dose-dependently with single- and 
multiple-dose administration of canagliflozin. A maximal decrease to about 50 – 60 mg/dL could 
be achieved. No relevant differences were observed after single dose or multiple dose 
administration and between qd and bid dosing of 100 mg and of 300 mg at steady state. These 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014

findings are crucial for the bridging strategy from the studies using canagliflozin qd to the bid 
administration of CANA/MET IR FDC.  
In patients with T2DM, the effect of canagliflozin on UGE was more pronounced (≥ 100 g/day at 
doses > 100 g/day). This can be explained by the fact that UGE is influenced by both glucose 
plasma concentrations and GFR. The maximal effect on UGE24h was seen at doses ≥ 200 mg 
qd or even at lower doses. As expected, (pretreatment) RTG baseline values were generally 
higher in the patients with T2DM than the commonly reported values of 180 to 200 mg/dL for 
healthy subjects. RTG was related to 24h mean plasma glucose (MPG). Canagliflozin decreased 
24-hour mean RTG in a dose-dependent manner. A maximal decrease to about 70 to 90 mg/dL 
was achieved with doses ≥ 200 mg qd.  
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations, post prandial glucose (PG) concentrations and 24-
hour mean plasma glucose (MPG24h) decreased in a dose-dependent manner in subjects with 
T2DM. A mean decrease of FPG by ≥40 mg/dL and of MPG24h by ≥30 mg/dL was achieved with 
doses of 100 mg qd and higher. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Over the whole period of 4 weeks in the clinical pharmacology program the effect on UGE, RTG 
and reductions in FPG and MPG24h was sustained. 
Based on the PD results, a maximum daily dose of 300 mg of canagliflozin appears justified. 
A delay in post prandial glucose absorption with decreased post prandial glucose excursions was 
observed with 300 mg canagliflozin in healthy subjects and patients with T2DM that was 
independent from the effect on UGE. This effect was not explained by delayed gastric emptying 
and may possibly be due to inhibition of intestinal SGLT1 by high intestinal concentrations of 
canagliflozin after oral intake. Since this effect on intestinal glucose absorption is not seen with 
150 mg bid there may be a difference on post prandial peak glucose plasma levels between the 
300mg qd and 150 mg bid regimen. However, the inhibitory effect on SGLT1 is expected to be 
transient (only observable after the breakfast meal) and small and may be further reduced in 
the presence of metformin. Based on the estimated SGLT1-associated reduction in post-
breakfast glucose obtained with canagliflozin 300 mg in Study DIA1045 (mean reduction in PG 
over 0-4h = 0.53 mmol/L (9.6 mg/dL), with no additional reduction expected over the 4-24h 
interval), the associated incremental reduction in 24-h mean PG is estimated to be 0.09 mmol/L 
(1.6 mg/dL). Based on relationships between mean PG (MPG) and HbA1c from Rohlfing 
(ΔHbA1c(%) = ΔMPG(mmol/L)/1.98) and Nathan (ΔHbA1c(%) = ΔMPG(mmol/L)/1.59), the 300 
mg qd regimen is expected to provide approximately 0.05% greater reductions in HbA1c than 
the 150 mg bid regimen. This difference is not expected to be clinically meaningful. 
A placebo-adjusted decrease in body weight by approximately 1.3 – 2.2 kg in healthy 
volunteers and by 1 to 1.5 kg in subjects with T2DM, respectively were observed during 2 to 4 
weeks of canagliflozin administration. This was not due to changes in appetite and satiety, as 
assessed by VAS in different studies. Both nutrient loss due to renal glucose excretion and 
osmotic diuresis may contribute to this effect.

The data for insulin sensitivity in the therapeutic dose range were not conclusive. At 
supratherapeutic doses (400 mg qd and 300 mg bid) improvements in insulin sensitivity were 
observed after 2 weeks. For lower doses no significant effects were seen over 2 weeks in the 
pharmacology program.  
As an indicator of beta cell function, insulin secretion rate increased by more than 50 % with 
canagliflozin 100 mg qd.  
Secondary pharmacology 
The Applicant conducted a thorough QT/QTc study in 60 healthy subjects as a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacine 400 mg), double-dummy, 4-way 
crossover, single-center trial of oral CANA at therapeutic (300 mg) and supratherapeutic (1,200 
mg) doses, administered as single doses.QT intervals were extracted from continuous 12-lead 
ECG Holter recordings and corrected according to Fridericia (QTcF), Bazett (QTcB) and study-
specific power (QTcP) correction methods. 
Moxifloxacin, the positive control, yielded the expected results (QTc prolongation by 5 to 10 
ms). Neither visual inspection of the results nor formal statistical analysis gave any hint that 
CANA could prolong the QT interval in a relevant way. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Coadministration of canagliflozin 300 mg qd with metformin 2000 mg qd in healthy volunteers 
was associated with a slight decreased in UGE24h, a slight increase in RTG and no effect on 
plasma glucose levels as compared to canagliflozin alone. The lack of an additional efficacy on 
plasma glucose cannot be regarded as representative for patients with T2DM. No PD 
interactions were observed between canagliflozin and simvastatin, or warfarin. Coadministration 
with HCTZ was associated with a small increase in RTG and mean plasma glucose leves and 
slightly lower UGE. Coadministration with gliburide was not associated with synergistic or 
additive effects. Cmax of plasma glucose were similar, when canagliflozin was administered 
alone or in combination with gliburide, AUC 0-4 and AUC0-10 was slightly lower in the 
combination group AUC0-24 was even slightly above the value for canagliflozin alone. 
Genetic differences in PD response 
No studies investigating genetic differences in PD response have been performed. 
No data were provided for PK or PD of metformin, and the Applicant refers to the information in 
the SmPC of Glucophage. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The development of a FDC of canagliflozin and metformin is reasonable since they have different 
modes of action. Whereas canagliflozin increases glucose excretion and (at single doses of 300 
mg) prolongs glucose absorption, metformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and 
thereby decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the 
plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. In addition, metformin 
decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, improves insulin sensitivity, increases peripheral 
glucose uptake by phosphorylating GLUT4 enhancer factor and increases glucose utilization. 
Since renal glucose excretion by canagliflozin is related to plasma glucose levels it is not

Page 55/130 
 
  
  
expected that there is a more than additive effect when both drugs are coadministered in a FDC 
and it is not expected that hypoglycaemic effects of metformin are highly potentiated by 
canagliflozin.  
The Applicant has demonstrated bioequivalence between CANA/MET and Canagliflozin + 
Glucophage coadministration for the following strengths: 50/850 mg, 50/1000mg, 150/850 mg, 
and 150/1000 mg CANA/MET. There was no relevant food effect on canagliflozin in the FDC and 
the reduction in metformin Cmax is consistent with the known food effect on Glucophage. 
Administration with or after food intake as proposed for metformin is appropriate for the 
CANA/MET IR FDC.  
With canagliflozin RTG and UGE in healthy volunteers were independent of whether the same 
daily dose was administered qd or bid supporting that data from studies with qd administration 
can be transferred to the bid administration with the FDC. There is an effect of 300 mg qd 
canagliflozin on the velocity of glucose absorption which is not seen with 150 mg bid. However, 
this concerns only postprandial glucose absorption in the morning but not later during the day. 
The possible effect on Hba1c is small and is not considered clinically relevant. 
Overall, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of canagliflozin have been 
adequately characterised. Dose and time dependency were investigated in healthy subjects and 
in patients with T2DM. In subjects with T2DM PK was comparable to healthy subjects and there 
were no relevant differences attributable to race. 
Mild to moderate differences in exposure relating to gender, body weight and mild to moderate 
hepatic failure are not considered of clinical relevance per se but may possibly be pronounced in 
case there is more than one factor. Patients with severe hepatic failure were excluded from the 
pharmacological program and these patients should be excluded from the therapy. Since 
metformin is not to be administered in patients with hepatic failure PK considerations for 
canagliflozin are not relevant for the FDC. 
The increase in canagliflozin exposure in elderly subjects by 29% could be of relevance with 
respect to AEs associated with a decrease in BP. Therefore, a dose titration starting with 50 mg 
bid of canagliflozin and uptitration mainly based on tolerability considerations may be 
appropriate.  
In patients with renal failure there was an increase in canagliflozin exposure related to the 
degree of renal failure by up to 63% in patients not on haemodialysis. In patients with end-stage 
renal failure on haemodialysis exposure was unchanged. Canagliflozin is not eliminated by 
haemodialysis. Since metformin is contraindicated in patients with at least moderate renal 
insufficiency PK considerations for canagliflozin are not relevant for the FDC. 
The interaction profile of canagliflozin has been well characterized addressing the metabolic 
pathways and clinically relevant co-administered drugs. The data indicate that canagliflozin has 
the potential for drug-drug interactions at the level of P-gp, MDR1 and MRP2. There were two 
interactions of clinical relevance, a decrease in canagliflozin AUC by 52% induced by rifampin and 
an increase of Cmax of digoxin by about 36% and AUC levels by about 20%. The latter finding is 
possibly related to an interaction at the level of P-gp and therefore is relevant for all of the 
cardiac glycosides, since all of them have a narrow therapeutic range. 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 56/130 
 
  
  
Taken together, the pharmacological characteristics of canagliflozin are well characterized for 
healthy subjects and subjects with T2DM. The differences in exposure in the a.m. subgroups and 
the relevant interactions can be sufficiently addressed by labelling in the SPC and the dose 
selection for canagliflozin based on tolerability.  
The PD effect on UGE was more pronounced in patients with T2DM than in healthy subjects. 
There was a ceiling effect on RTG with daily doses ≥ 200 mg indicating a low potential of 
hypoglycaemia induced by canagliflozin even in case of overdosage. The exposure response 
relationship indicated that the EC50 values based on free (unbound) canagliflozin concentrations 
were 0.21 to 0.32 ng/mL (0.5 to 0.7 nM). Considering the excretion of canagliflozin (<1%) , the 
concentrations of canagliflozin in the lumen of the proximal tubule was estimated to be similar to 
the unbound concentrations in plasma, which is about 6 to 8 time lower as compared to the 
estimated in vitro IC50 value of 4.2 nM. The Applicant has pointed out that possibly the low 
dissociation rate of canagliflozin from SGLT2 may provide an explanation for the difference 
between in vitro IC 50 values and estimated concentrations. 
In subjects with renal failure the effect on UGE was inversely related to renal function. In 
addition to the higher exposure in these patients the results in non-diabetic subjects suggested, 
that below a CLCR of 40 – 50 ml/min a relevant clinical efficacy may not be expected. This is not 
relevant for the FDC since metformin is not to be administered in patients with renal failure. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The development of a FDC containing canagliflozin and metformin is reasonable since the 
mechanism of action is different and there is a potential for additive effects on plasma glucose 
levels. Bioequivalence of the FDC to the coadministration of canagliflozin and Glucophage has 
been demonstrated for all proposed strengths and the proposed bid dosing with or after food 
intake is justified based on PK and PD considerations. 
Overall PK and PD of canagliflozin are well characterized. 
2.5.   Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The phase 2b program includes 1 dose-ranging study (451 patients) in metformin treated 
patients investigating CANA doses of 50 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg (DIA2001). This study has 
already been submitted with the CANA MAA. The CANA doses for the phase 2b study were 
selected based on findings from the phase 1 program (i.e. studies DIA 1015, DIA 1030, DIA 
1032, NAP 1001, NAP 1008). An 18-week phase 2 study (DIA2003) investigated comparable 
efficacy and safety/tolerability between once daily and twice daily dosing of CANA in combination 
with MET. This study has been newly submitted to support the present fixed dose combination 
application. 
Study DIA2001 was a parallel group, dose-ranging study with 7 treatment arms including an 
active reference arm (sitagliptin 100 mg qd). The study assessed the safety and efficacy of CANA 
at doses of 50 mg once daily (qd), 100 mg qd, 200 mg qd, 300 mg qd, and 300 mg twice daily 
Assessment report

(bid) versus placebo in subjects with T2DM who had not achieved glycemic control (HbA1c levels 
≥7.0% and ≤10.5%) while receiving near maximal doses of metformin (equal or greater than 
1500 mg/ day). The study included a 3-4 week screening phase, a 12-week double-blind 
treatment phase, and a 2-week post-treatment phase. A total of 451 subjects were randomised 
equally to one of the following 7 treatments: CANA 50 mg (n=64), 100 mg(n=64), 200 
mg(n=65), 300 mg qd (n=64), 300 mg bid (n= 64), placebo (n=65), sitagliptin 100 mg qd (n= 
65). 
Baseline demographic, anthropometric and disease characteristics were generally balanced 
across treatment groups, except for slightly more subjects with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and a higher 
proportion of subjects with a HbA1c >8.0% in the 50 mg group. Since the treatment effect is 
expected to increase with increasing HbA1c values this imbalance could only have led to an 
increased treatment effect in this subgroup and therefore the lower boundary for an effective 
dose could not have been missed. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Changes in HbA1c (%) from baseline at week 12 compared to placebo were -0.45%, -0.51%, -
0.54%, -0.71%, and -0.73% for CANA 50 mg qd, 100 mg qd, 200 mg qd, 300 mg qd, and 300 
mg bid, respectively, and -0.56% for sitagliptin. All doses of CANA and sitagliptin were 
statistically significantly different (adjusted p<0.001 for all comparisons) from placebo. 
Main Secondary endpoints 
The differences in change of FPG (mmol/L) from baseline at week 12 LOCF compared to placebo 
were -0.9, -1.4, -1.8, -1.8, and -1.7 for CANA 50 mg qd, 100 mg qd, 200 mg qd, 300 mg qd, 
and 300 mg bid, respectively, and -1.0 for sitagliptin. Responder analyses generally supported 
the results on HbA1c and FPG. Body weight was also reduced in a dose-dependent fashion: % 
changes from baseline at week 12 compared to placebo were -1.3%, -1.5%, -1.6%, -2.3%, and 
-2.3% for CANA 50 mg qd, 100 mg qd, 200 mg qd, 300 mg qd, and 300 mg bid, respectively, 
and 0.4% for sitagliptin.

In conclusion, selection of the 100 mg and 300 mg CANA dose for the phase 3 studies seems 
reasonable based on the study results. 
In study DIA2003 CANA was administered as 50 mg or 150 mg bid to provide the same total 
daily dose of 100 mg or 300 mg evaluated in the phase 3 CANA programme with once daily 
dosing. Bid dosing is in line with the dosing recommendations for MET. 
DIA2003 was an 18-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, 
multicenter phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin bid dosing in 
subjects with T2DM with inadequate glycemic control (ie, HbA1c of >7.0% to <10.5%) on 
maximal (or near maximally) effective doses of metformin monotherapy. The study design 
features are consistent with those of the phase 3 studies. Rescue therapy was not an option in 
DIA2003. 
The primary objective and key secondary objectives of this study were to demonstrate the 
superiority of canagliflozin 50 mg and 150 mg bid, respectively, to placebo, as measured by the 
change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 18. The key secondary endpoints included the change 
from baseline in FPG, percent change from baseline in body weight, and the proportion of 
subjects with HbA1c <7.0% at Week 18 last observation carried forward (LOCF); these endpoints 
were common to the Phase 3 studies. Additional endpoints included the proportion of subjects 
with HbA1c <6.5%, percent change from baseline at Week 18 in HDL-C, TGs, low-density 
lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, LDL-C to HDL-C ratio, SBP and diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP).

Main Secondary endpoints 
With respect to all major secondary endpoints (ie, FPG, body weight and proportion achieving 
<7% HbA1c) Canagliflozin was superior to placebo based on the pre-specified hierarchical testing 
sequence.   The differences in change in FPG (mmol/L) from baseline at Week 18 LOCF compared 
to placebo were -1.31 and -1.33 for CANA 50 mg bid and CANA 150 mg bid, respectively.  
Responder analyses supported the results of both HbA1c and FPG, with greater proportions of 
subjects achieving HbA1c <7% compared to placebo (16.3% for CANA 50 mg bid and 25.6% 
CANA 150 mg bid). Significant reductions in percent change in body weight of 2.2% and 2.6% 
were also observed for CANA 50 mg bid and CANA 150 mg bid, respectively. 
In conclusion, although the antihyperglycaemic response was smaller compared to the effects in 
the phase 3 studies, this could be (at least partly) attributed to differences in baseline HbA1c as 
demonstrated by an acceptable bootstrap analysis.

Add-on to metformin monotherapy studies 
Study DIA3006: this study aimed at investigating the add-on use of CANA in subjects with 
inadequate glycemic control on (sub)maximal doses of metformin. It included 1,284 subjects 
treated over the 26-week core double-blind period. A sitagliptin 100 mg treatment arm was also 
included, although no formal statistical testing was planned or performed for the 26-week 
double-blind period. 
A total of 87% of treated subjects completed 26 weeks of treatment, with the proportion of 
subjects discontinued prior to the Week 26 visit modestly higher in the placebo group (15%)

compared to the canagliflozin 100mg (13%), canagliflozin 300mg (12%), and sitagliptin (13%) 
groups. 
The change from baseline in HbA1c at week 26 for CANA 300mg relative to placebo was –0.77% 
(p<0.001) and –0.62% (p<0.001) for CANA 100 mg. The placebo-subtracted HbA1c lowering 
response at week 26 for sitagliptin 100mg was -0.66%. Both doses of CANA also achieved 
statistical significance with respect to the secondary endpoints of FPG, proportion achieving 
HbA1c target, and 2-hour PPG (during a MMTT procedure). Body weight decreased modestly with 
the CANA groups compared to placebo (placebo-adjusted changes from baseline -2.5% and -
2.9%). The effect of sitagliptin on body weight was neutral. Blood pressure was clinically 
relevantly influenced by both dose strengths of CANA (SBP: -3.84mmHg and -5.06mmHg with 
CANA 100 mg and 300 mg, 1.52mmHg with placebo, -1.83mmHg with sitagliptin; DBP: -2.19 
mmHg and 3.09mmHg with CANA 100 mg and 300 mg, 0.28mmHg with placebo, -1.11mmHg 
with sitagliptin). 
The improvement in fasting insulin secretion (numerically superior over sitagliptin) measured by 
HOMA2-%B is notable given the lack of any direct effect of CANA to stimulate beta-cell insulin 
secretion. The improvement in HOMA2-%B may be explained by the reversal of glucotoxicity 
leading to improved beta-cell function. 
Generally,  this  study  supports the  efficacy  of  both  doses  of  CANA  when  added  to  a  background 
therapy of metformin. Key results of this study are summarized in the following table:

active-controlled double-blind treatment phase, followed by a 52-week extension active-
controlled, double-blind treatment period. 
A total of 1,452 subjects were randomised to CANA 100 mg, CANA 300 mg, placebo or 
glimepiride. The mean maximum dose achieved with glimepiride was 6 mg, and as such, the 
active comparator was sufficiently up-titrated. A non-inferiority margin of 0.3% was selected. 
At baseline, 95% of subjects had a metformin total daily dose at least 2,000 mg/day, and almost 
all (99%) subjects remained on stable doses of metformin during the double-blind period, as 
specified by the protocol.  
In the CANA 100mg and 300mg groups the mean changes from baseline in HbA1c at week 52 
showed a reduction of -0.78% and -0.89%, respectively, compared to a change of- 0.79% in the 
glimepiride group. The upper limits of both 95% CIs for the difference in HbA1c for each CANA 
dose comparison to glimepiride were less than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 0.3%. 
A step-down to an assessment of superiority was pre-specified; the upper limit of the 95% CI 
between CANA 300 mg and glimepiride was <0%, demonstrating superiority for CANA to 
glimepiride. The HbA1c lowering response to CANA 100 mg was not superior to that of 
glimepiride in this study. The absolute HbA1c reductions in the three treatment arms were about 
-0.7% and are considered to be clinically relevant, although the true effect cannot be assessed in 
the absence of a placebo arm. 
The results on the secondary glycaemic endpoints (FPG lowering, proportion of responders) 
generally supported those on HbA1c. Body weight decreased in the CANA groups compared to a 
small gain in the glimepiride group. A substudy investigating body composition showed that fat 
loss contributed significantly to body weight reduction. Glimepiride-substracted change in systolic 
blood pressure was -3.48mmHg and -4.76mmHg for the 100mg and 300 mg dose, respectively. 
Trends in favour of CANA as compared to glimepiride were also shown for measures of beta cell 
function (HOMA-2%B). Notably, the improvement in HOMA-2%B was numerically superior to

glimepiride which acts directly at the beta cell. Reversal of glucotoxicity leading to improved 
beta-cell function may play a role. 
With glimepiride the durability of HbA1c lowering was worse compared to both CANA doses which 
showed little change through week 52. The waning of effect is known for insulin secretagogues. 
Durability of the effect of CANA can be further assessed based on data of the long term extension 
study. 
Overall, this study showed non-inferior efficacy and suggests better durability of the effect of 
both CANA doses compared to SU treatment when added to metformin. 
Glimepiride-substracted change in systolic blood pressure was -3.48mmHg and -4.76mmHg for 
the 100mg and 300 mg dose, respectively.

Add-on to metformin based dual combination AHA therapy 
Study DIA3002: the aim of this study was to examine the add-on use of CANA compared to 
placebo in subjects with inadequate glycemic control on (sub)maximal doses of metformin and 
SU. A total of 469 patients were randomised and 381 patients completed the 26 week double 
blind treatment. The percentage of patients who were discontinued prior to week 26 was 
modestly higher in the placebo group compared to the pooled canagliflozin group (21% vs. 
18%). At baseline, 90% of subjects were on a metformin total daily dose of at least 2,000 
mg/day, and 97% subjects received the minimum daily dose for a SU as required by the 
protocol. Through week 26, 99% and 96% of subjects remained on stable doses of metformin 
and of SU, respectively, as specified by the protocol. 
The mean change in HbA1c was statistically significantly higher in both CANA groups compared 
to placebo. The reductions at both doses (-0.92% and -0.71% for CANA 300 mg and 100mg, 
respectively, placebo-adjusted change from baseline at week 26) were clinically relevant. The 
results of the secondary glycaemic endpoints (FPG lowering, proportion of responders) generally 
supported those on HbA1c. Only a relatively small decrease in body weight with the CANA groups 
compared to placebo was observed in this study, likely due to the concomitant treatment with 
SUs (-2% and -2.6% in the CANA 100mg and 300mg groups, respectively, compared to a 
change of -0.6% in the placebo group). Trends in favour or CANA were shown for SBP, while the 
reduction of DBP was borderline clinically relevant (SBP: -4.89mmHg and -4.27mmHg with CANA 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014

100mg and 300mg and -2.65mmHg with placebo; DBP: -2.85mmHg and -2.25mmHg with CANA 
100mg and 300 mg and -1.72mmHg with placebo). 
Notably, the effect on HbA1c and FPG was achieved by week 12 for both doses of CANA. A small 
but inconsistent increase from week 12 to week 26 in HbA1c was observed with CANA 100 mg. 
The profile of FPG change from baseline to week 26 showed a nadir at week 6 in both CANA 
groups with a modest rise, more evident in the 100 mg group. Data of the ongoing double-blind 
extension period of this study may provide further understanding of the course of HbA1c over 
time. However, comparisons of the durability of HbA1c lowering of CANA with active comparators 
(studies DIA3009 and 3015) showed superior durability of both CANA doses.  
Generally, this study supports the efficacy of both doses of CANA as add-on to a background 
therapy of metformin and SU.

Study 3012: the aim of this study was to examine the add-on use of CANA in subjects with 
inadequate glycemic control on (sub)maximal doses of metformin and pioglitazone. 
Of the 342 randomized and dosed subjects, 87% completed 26 weeks of double-blind treatment, 
with  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  were  discontinued  prior  to  Week  26  higher  in  the  placebo 
group versus the pooled canagliflozin group (21% vs 10%). At baseline, 91% of subjects had a 
metformin  total  daily  dose  at  least  2,000mg/day;  68%  of  subjects  were  on  pioglitazone  30  mg 
and 32% were on pioglitazone 45 mg. Through week 26, almost all subjects remained on stable 
doses of metformin and PIO, as specified by the protocol. 
Mean change in HbA1c was statistically significantly higher in both CANA groups compared to 
placebo. The reductions at both doses (-0.76% and -0.62% for CANA 300 mg and 100mg, 
respectively, placebo-subtracted change from baseline at week 26) were clinically relevant. The 
results on the secondary glycaemic endpoints (FPG lowering, proportion of responders) generally 
supported those on HbA1c. Body weight decreased in both CANA groups compared to placebo. 
Clinical relevant improvements were shown for SBP and DBP: reductions from baseline to week 
26 were achieved in the 100mg and 300mg CANA groups compared to placebo (SBP: placebo -
1.67 mmHg, CANA 100mg -5.13 mmHg, CANA300 mg -4.62mmHg; DBP: placebo -1.18 mmHg, 
CANA 100mg -2.83 mmHg, CANA 300 mg -3.52 mmHg).  
Generally, this study supports the efficacy of both doses of CANA as add-on to a background 
therapy of metformin and pioglitazone.

Study DIA 3015: the aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of CANA 300 
mg compared to the DDP-inhibitor sitagliptin, both as add-on therapy to (sub)maximal doses of 
metformin and SU. It included 755 randomized and dosed subjects treated over the 52-week 
double-blind period. The proportion of subjects who completed 52 weeks of treatment was higher 
for the canagliflozin 300 mg group (67%) than for the sitagliptin group (56%), which was 
primarily due to a higher proportion of subjects in the sitagliptin group who were discontinued 
from the study due to meeting glycemic withdrawal criteria (23% vs 11% for canagliflozin). 
(Note: in DIA3015, subjects meeting prespecified glycemic targets were to be withdrawn from 
the study instead of being treated with rescue therapy, which contributed substantially to the 
lower completion rate in DIA3015 compared to the other phase 3 studies.) The remaining 
percentage of subjects who discontinued from this study from each treatment group (21% for 
sitagliptin and 22% for canagliflozin 300 mg) is consistent with the percentage seen in the other 
52-week canagliflozin phase 3 study (DIA3009).  
During the double-blind period, 98% and 90% of subjects remained on stable doses of 
metformin and of SU, respectively, as specified by the protocol. The lower percentage of subjects 
remaining on a stable dose of SU than metformin mainly reflects downtitration of the SU to avoid 
hypoglycemia; there was no difference between the canagliflozin and sitagliptin groups in the 
percentage of subjects having a decrease in SU dose (8% and 9%, respectively). 
The mean change in HbA1c showed clinically relevant improvements in both treatment arms with 
changes from baseline of -1.03% and -0.66%, respectively. Since the upper limit of the 95% CI 
for the difference in HbA1c between CANA and Sitagliptin was less than 0 (-0.25%) even 
superiority of CANA could be demonstrated. Over the 52 week treatment period the response 
was attenuated to a greater extent with sitagliptin suggesting better durability of effect with 
CANA.

The results on the number of responders as well on FPG showed consistent results. Body weight 
was decreased by 2.5% with CANA 300 mg while Sitagliptin showed a neutral effect.  
In addition, clinically relevant reductions of SBP and DBP were observed in the CANA group with 
little change of these parameters in the Sitagliptin treated patients: Treatment with CANA led to 
a decrease in systolic blood pressure of -5.7 mmHg, compared to an increase of 0.7mmHg in the 
Sitagliptin 100 mg dose. Diastolic blood pressure decreased with CANA 300 mg by -3.28 mmHg 
and by -0.32 mmHg with sitagliptin 100 mg. 
CANA 300 mg seems to improve beta-cell function (improvement of HOMA2%-B and by FS-MMTT 
derived measures of beta-cell function) compared to Sitagliptin. 
This non-inferiority study did not investigate the CANA 100 mg dose applied for. However, there 
are data from other studies (DIA2001, DIA3006) investigating Sitagliptin and CANA 100 mg, 
which show clinically relevant antihyperglycaemic efficacy in the same order of magnitude for 
both active treatments. Although no formal non-inferiority comparison was performed in these 
studies these data are considered to support an add-on claim of CANA 100 mg in patients pre-
treated with metformin and SU. 
Overall, this study demonstrates non-inferior and even superior efficacy of CANA compared to 
sitagliptin.

Study DIA3008: CANVAS is a placebo-controlled, 3 parallel-group study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and CV risk with CANA plus standard of care relative to placebo plus standard of care 
in subjects with T2DM, on a wide range of current antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs), who had 
either a history or high risk of CV disease. 
Subjects were randomized to treatment with CANA (100 mg or 300 mg) or placebo in a 1:1:1 
randomization ratio. CANVAS is an event-driven study, with the study duration based on the 
occurrence of sufficient events to evaluate the study hypothesis and objectives. It is planned to 
enrol approximately 4500 subjects in the study. The sample size was determined based upon a 
sufficient number of MACE plus hospitalised unstable angina events (assuming a per annum 
event rate of 2.25%) to support a planned meta-analysis of CV data from this study (and other 
CANA phase 3 studies).  
With the CANVAS study the Applicant addressed the requirement as set out in CPMP/ 
EWP/1080/00 Rev.1 that the development programme of drugs for the treatment of T2DM 
“provides sufficient information supporting the lack of a drug induced excess cardiovascular risk”. 
Cardiovascular high risk patients will be followed for a minimum of 4 years in this event driven 
study and blinded data will be monitored for MACE. Results of the interim safety analysis (data

DIA3008 (Insulin substudy): the aim of this substudy was to investigate the add-on use of 
CANA to insulin in CV high risk subjects with inadequate glycemic control, either as 
monotherapy or in combination with metformin or any other AHA(s). 
Most of the 1,718 randomized and dosed subjects (population 2 = subjects on insulin ≥30IE/day) 
completed the 18 week substudy (93%), and the proportion of subjects who were discontinued 
prior to week 18 was modestly higher in the placebo group (9%) than in the pooled canagliflozin 
group (7%). The overall mean insulin dose at baseline was 83 IU/day, and 70% of subjects were 
on a background of basal (ie, long-acting) plus bolus (short-acting) insulin prior to baseline, 
while 20% of subjects were on a background of basal insulin alone and 9% were on a 
background of bolus insulin alone (not specified for 1%). Approximately 90% of subjects 
remained on stable doses of insulin during the 18-week substudy, as specified by the protocol, 
unless down-titration was considered necessary to avoid hypoglycaemia, or if rescue criteria 
were met. 
Clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c at week 18 compared to placebo were observed with both 
doses of CANA (placebo-adjusted changes from baseline: -0.72% and -0.63% for CANA 300 mg 
and 100 mg, respectively, population 2). The other glycemic endpoints tested (FPG lowering, 
proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c <7%) were statistically significantly superior to placebo 
for both CANA doses. Of note, albeit smaller compared to effects in other phase 3 studies, some

reductions of body weight were seen with both CANA doses in the presence of ongoing insulin 
therapy.  
Significant, dose-dependent reductions from baseline to week 26 were achieved in SBP with the 
100 mg and 300 mg CANA doses compared to placebo (SBP: -4.57mmHg and -6.94 mmHg with 
the 100 mg and 300 mg dose, respectively, placebo -2.47mmHg). Reductions in DBP were less 
pronounced: -1.86 mmHg and -2.95 mmHg with CANA 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively 
(placebo:-1.23mmHg). 
In the CANA groups background insulin dose could be decreased in a greater proportion of 
patients as compared to placebo (12% and 10% in the CANA 300 mg and 100 mg group, 
respectively, compared to 4% in the placebo group). Reduction of insulin requirements and 
alleviation of insulin induced weight gain are considered desirable effects of CANA in the 
frequently obese population of patients with T2M. Sustainability of the decrease in insulin 
requirements was, however, comparable between the CANA and the placebo groups. Glycemic 
control (HbA1c) in the subgroup of patients who decreased their insulin dosage was comparable 
to the results of the primary analysis. Reduction of insulin requirements and alleviation ofinsulin 
induced weight gain are considered desirable effects of CANA in the frequently obese population 
of patients with T2M 
Overall, this study supports the efficacy of both doses of CANA in combination with insulin with or 
without other AHAs, predominantly metformin.

Study 3008 (SU substudy) the aim of this substudy was to investigate the add-on use of CANA 
in CV high risk subjects with inadequate glycemic control in the subgroup of subjects receiving 
SU monotherapy at a protocol pre-specified dose (for details please refer to “treatments” in 
clinical AR). However, due to misstratification (for details please refer to “study conduct”, Clinical 
AR) population 1 was the pre-specified population of interest which is acceptable. For this study a 
total of 127 patients in population 1 were randomised to CANA 100mg, 300 mg or placebo. About 
7% of patient discontinued with the majority in the placebo group (patients in need for rescue 
therapy). 
Clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c at week 18 compared to placebo were observed with both 
doses of CANA (% changes from baseline compared to placebo -0.83% and -0.74% for CANA 
300 mg and 100 mg, respectively, population 1). The other glycaemic endpoints tested (FPG 
lowering, proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c <7%) generally supported the findings on 
HbA1c. Numerically superior effects on body weight were shown. As regards systolic blood 
pressure statistically non-significant, dose-dependent reductions from baseline to week 18 were 
achieved with the 100 mg and 300 mg CANA groups compared to placebo (SBP: -4.04mmHg and 
-4.22 mmHg with the 100 mg and 300 mg dose, respectively, placebo -3.70 mmHg). Reductions 
in DBP were as follows: -3.48 mmHg (baseline 82 mmHg) and -1.88 mmHg (baseline 76 mmHg) 
with CANA 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively (placebo:-0.9 mmHg). 
During the 18-week substudy, 100% and 98% of subjects in Population 1 and 2, respectively, 
remained on stable doses of the SU agent that they were on at randomization, as specified by 
the protocol. In population 2 there were 3 decreases in the combined CANA group and no 
decrease in the placebo group. 
Results on HbA1c in the subgroup of moderately renally impaired patients in population 1 were 
not presented in the study report and should be submitted by the Applicant. 
Overall, this study supports the efficacy of both doses of CANA as add-on to SU.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
To assess how subgroup factors impact glycaemic responses to CANA subgroup analyses were 
performed. 
The overall pooled population of placebo-controlled studies for subgroup analyses of efficacy 
endpoints comprised 4158 subjects from the ITT analysis sets of DIA3005 main study, DIA3006, 
DIA 3008 SU substudy, DIA3002, DIA3012, and DIA3008 insulin substudy. It includes a high 
proportion (about 70%) of subjects for whom CANA was added to ongoing metformin therapy 
and is therefore also relevant for the FDC. 
Baseline characteristics were generally similar across the pooled CANA 100 mg, CANA 300 mg 
group, and placebo treatment group. In each pooled treatment group, there was a slightly higher 
proportion of males compared with females. The median age was 60 years, a total of 1031 
(25%) patients was 65-<75 years of age, and a total of 183 subjects (4%) were 75 years or 
older, with one subject being ≥85 years of age. Approximately three-quarters of pooled 
population subjects were white, 4% black or African American, and 13% Asian; 18% of subjects 
were Hispanic-Latino.

A total of 63% of subjects were obese, as indicated by a baseline BMI of ≥30 kg/m2. The mean 
HbA1c at baseline was 8.1% and the duration of diabetes was 10 years in each pooled treatment 
group. At baseline 12% of subjects had moderate renal impairment, the mean eGFR value in the 
pooled population was 82.1 mL/ min/ 1.73m2. No baseline imbalances occurred with respect to 
anthropometric and disease characteristics. 
Subgroup analyses of change in HbA1c 
The change from baseline in HbA1c by within each of the predefined subgroups for the pooled 
population of placebo-controlled studies is presented in the following forest plot: 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 77/130 
 
  
  
 
Overall, the mean change from baseline in HbA1c at the primary assessment time point, relative 
to placebo, was -0.83 (95%CI: [-0.892;-0.771] for the 300 mg dose and -0.69% (95%CI:[-
0.749;-0.627] for the 100 mg dose.  
In the pooled dataset the mean percent change from baseline in body weight at the primary 
assessment time point, relative to placebo, was -2.7% (95% CI: [-2.9;-2.4]) for the 300 mg 
dose and -2.0% (95% CI: [-2.3;-1.8]) for the 100 mg dose. Corresponding placebo-subtracted 
LS mean absolute reductions in body weight for the 300 mg and 100 mg groups for the pooled 
population of placebo-controlled studies were -2.43 kg (95% CI: [-2.652;-2.199]) and -1.84 kg 
(95% CI: [-2.064;-1.611]), respectively.  
The treatment-by-subgroup interactions were not significant (p >0.10) for subgroups defined by 
sex, age, baseline BMI, ethnicity and region. Subgroup analyses of particular interest which 
demonstrated an impact on the magnitude of HbA1c lowering response to CANA were the 
following: 
Subgroup analysis by baseline HbA1c: the most prominent effect occurred in patients with high 
baseline values. The effect (placebo subtracted LS mean change) was -0.63% and -0.47% for 
CANA 300 mg and 100 mg, respectively, in the HbA1c <8% subgroup, -1.15% and -1.01%, 
respectively, in the HbA1c 8-9% subgroup, and -1.6% and -1.08% in the HbA1c ≥9% subgroup. 
Subgroup analysis by baseline GFR: Reductions in HbA1c were reduced in a stepwise manner 
with lower baseline GFR: -0.56% and -0.48% for the <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subgroup, -0.80% 
and -0.63%, for 60-<90 mL/min/1.73 m2 subgroup, and -1.01% and -0.87% for ≥90 
mL/min/1.73m2 subgroup, for CANA 300 mg and 100mg, respectively. The mean baseline GFR 
values at baseline were 50.6, 75.4, and 104.5 in the <60, 60 to <90, and ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2 
groups, respectively, of the overall pooled population of placebo controlled studies. 
Supportive studies 
Additional CANA supportive study with substantial proportion of subjects on MET 
Study DIA3010: this study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in 
older subjects not adequately controlled on current glucose lowering therapy (HbA1c of ≥7.0 to 
≤10.0%), and to assess body composition and bone safety using DXA in a subset of subjects. The 
mITT analysis set was comprised of 714 subjects (median age of 63 years, range 55 to 80 years, 
while a total of 211 subjects participated in the body composition substudy. A high proportion of 
subjects (89%) completed 26 weeks of double-blind treatment, and the proportion of subjects 
who were discontinued prior to week 26 was higher in the placebo group versus the pooled 
canagliflozin group (17% vs. 9%). The design of the study differs from most of the other phase 3 
studies in that it examines the add-on use of CANA to existing diabetes treatment rather than 
add-on to a predefined AHA regimen. Almost all subjects (98%) were taking at least 1 AHA agent 
(49% on a SU and 33% on insulin), and 76% of subjects were on 2 or more classes of AHA 
agents. 
Overall, CANA showed statistically significant and clinically relevant as well as dose-dependent 
improvement in glycaemic control in patients with T2DM on various antidiabetic background 
therapies. The primary efficacy endpoint mean change in HbA1c was statistically significantly 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 78/130 
 
  
  
 
higher in both CANA groups compared to placebo (change from baseline in HbA1c at week 26 for 
CANA 300 mg relative to placebo -0.7% for 300 mg and -0.57% for 100 mg). Other 
antihyperglycaemic efficacy parameters (FPG, responder analysis) supported these results. 
Results of the subgroup analysis investigating the effect on HbA1c according to age group (<65 
years versus ≥65 years) showed a marked decrease in effect in the older patient group 
(reduction in HbA1c with 300 mg CANA -0.50% and with CANA 100 mg -0.45% compared to -
0.82% and -0.65% in the younger age group). This difference might be partly explained by a 
slightly lower baseline HbA1c in the older age group (7.8% vs 7.6%) and – to a greater extent – 
by a lower baseline GFR in this group. Age per se was not found to be a factor influencing 
efficacy of another SGLT2-inhibitor and also did not affect the efficacy of CANA (see section 3.6).  
The age distribution in this study does not differ markedly from the one in the other phase 3 
studies and – despite the study’s goal to investigate the efficacy and safety of CANA in older 
patients with T2DM - less than 3% of patients were between 65 and 75 years of age, below 1% 
between 75 and 85 years and no patient was above 85 years. 
However, in the whole phase 3 population a sufficient number of older patients was included, and 
results on HbA1c reduction showed clinically relevant effects even in the patients above 75 years 
of age (age group ≤75 years: CANA 100 mg -0.77%, CANA 300 mg -0.68%, placebo -0.13%; 
age group<75 years CANA 100 mg -0.69%, CANA 300 mg -0.85%, placebo -0.15%, see section 
3.6). 
Results of subgroup analyses on study DIA3010 investigating the effect on HbA1c according to 
baseline GFR values showed that the antihyperglycaemic efficacy in moderately renally impaired 
patients was of borderline clinical significance. 
As regards systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions from baseline to week 26 were 
achieved with the 100 mg and 300 mg CANA groups compared to placebo. The reduction in SBP 
and DBP were more pronounced in the 300 mg relative to the 100 mg group (SBP change from 
baseline to week 26 [mmHg]: CANA 100 mg -3.96, CANA 300 mg -7.47, placebo 0.30; DBP 
change from baseline to week 26[mmHg] : CANA 100 mg -1.97, CANA 300 mg -3.48, placebo -
0.49). 
Body weight was significantly reduced with CANA in a dose dependent fashion. Body composition 
measurements performed in a subgroup of patients showed that fat mass loss accounted for 
approximately two-thirds of overall body mass reduction. This finding showed that, albeit a 
portion of the weight loss with CANA could be attributed to fluid loss (osmotic diuresis 
accompanying the increase in UGE), the majority of the total absolute weight loss was through 
loss of fat mass. The results are in line with those of study DIA 3009 and those observed for 
another SGLT2-inhibitor, and the relative reduction in fat and lean mass are similar to those 
achieved with dieting. 
Overall, this study supports the efficacy of CANA in combination with various background 
therapies but does not specifically contribute to the evaluation of efficacy and safety of CANA in 
older patients. However, the whole phase 3 program included enough older patients with results 
showing clinically relevant antihyperglycaemic efficacy of both doses of CANA.

Study DIA3005: this study evaluated the efficacy of canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg, 
administered as monotherapy in adults with T2DM who had inadequate glycemic control on 
diet and exercise. The study included a main study in 584 subjects who had mild to moderate 
baseline hyperglycemia (HbA1c ≥7.0% to ≤10.0%) randomized to placebo or CANA (100mg or 
300mg), and a high glycemic substudy that included 91 subjects with a baseline HbA1c of

>10.0% to ≤12.0% randomized to active therapy with either CANA dose (100mg or 300 mg). In 
both study components, subjects were treated over a core double-blind period of 26 weeks. 
A high proportion of subjects (87%) in the DIA3005 main study completed 26 weeks of double 
blind treatment, with the rate of discontinuation higher in the placebo group (17%) than in either 
the canagliflozin 100 mg (12%) or 300 mg (11%) groups. 
Results for the main study showed clinically relevant, dose-dependent reductions in HbA1c at 
week 26 of -1.16% for canagliflozin 300 mg relative to placebo (p<0.001) and –0.91% for 
canagliflozin 100 mg relative to placebo (p<0.001). Results of the primary analysis were 
supported by results on secondary glycaemic parameters with dose-dependent reductions in FPG, 
proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c goals and body weight. The number of patients in need 
for rescue medication was below 3% in each CANA group (compared to 22.9% in the placebo 
group). Blood pressure was reduced in a dose-dependent and clinical relevant fashion: reductions 
in SBP from baseline to week 26 were -3.34mmHg and -5.04mmHg with CANA 100 mg and 300 
mg, compared to 0.38 mmHg with placebo. Modest reductions were seen for diastolic blood 
pressure in both CANA groups compared to placebo (-1.67mmHg and -2.14mmHg with CANA 
100 mg and 300 mg, compared to -0.10 with placebo).

High glycaemic substudy: The 91 subjects comprising the mITT analysis set for the DIA3005 
high glycemic substudy had a mean baseline HbA1c of 10.6%. No hypothesis testing was planned 
for this substudy. Mean changes from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c (LOCF)  were -2.13% and -
2.56% for canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively. Twelve% to 17% of subjects achieved 
target  control  (HbA1c  <7.0%).  The  lower  number  of  responders  as  compared  to  other  phase  3 
studies  can  be  explained  by  a  high  baseline  HbA1c  above  10%  in  this  study.  Results  on 
secondary  endpoints  supported  the  findings  on  HbA1c:  descriptive  summaries  of  primary  and 
secondary endpoints are displayed in the following table: 
Generally, this study supports the efficacy of CANA as monotherapy. 
Results of extension studies 
In addition to the 52-week results for the DIA3009 and DIA3015 studies (see above), 26-week 
extension periods were conducted for the extension studies of the add-on to metformin studies 
(DIA3002 and DIA3006 to further substantiate the durability of effect on both the primary 
endpoint of HbA1c. Results are presented in the following table:

In conclusion, durability of action over 52 weeks has been demonstrated for both doses of CANA. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The phase 3 clinical studies that provided primary support for the CANA tablets also provide 
support for the CANA/ MET IR FDC. A total of 5,151 subjects in the CANA phase 3 programme 
were treated with CANA and MET. 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 83/130 
 
  
  
 
 
Additional clinical data serve to bridge the results from the phase 3 studies of once-daily 
administration of CANA as an add-on treatment to metformin (alone or with other AHAs) to the 
twice daily administration proposed for CANA/ MET IR FDC. These data stem from the following 
studies: four phase 1 studies that evaluated the pharmacokinetic bioequivalence of the to-be 
marketed formulation of the CANA/MET IR FDC tablets to the individual tablet components; one 
phase 1 study evaluated the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the to-be marketed 
formulation of the CANA/MET IR FDC; study DIA2003 was performed to support the CANA/ MET 
IR FDC, which will be dosed twice daily, consistent with the dosing of metformin IR. 
The dose selection for the FDC (50/850 mg CANA/ MET, 50/1000 mg CANA/ MET, 150/850 mg 
CANA/MET, 150/1000 mg CANA/MET) is supported by the results of the phase 3 studies of add-
on use of CANA in subjects already on metformin (alone or with another AHA). In addition, 
results of study DIA1032 showed that in healthy subjects the PD effects (24 hour mean renal 
glucose threshold) of the administration of 150 mg administered bid was not discernibly different 
from 300 mg administered once-daily; and, similarly, 50 mg administered bid was not 
meaningfully different from 100 mg administered once-daily. Doses for metformin within the FDC 
were in line with the dosing recommendations of the metformin originator product. 
The phase 3 programme supporting the combination of CANA and MET included 6 studies 
(including placebo- and active-controlled studies) of add-on combination use of CANA with MET 
(alone or in combination with other AHAs), and a substudy (of the CV safety study [DIA3008]) 
assessing the add-on combination of CANA with MET plus insulin, and 2 additional studies with 
CANA added to ongoing current diabetes treatment in which a substantial proportion of subjects 
were receiving treatment with MET. Nearly 80% (8,068 of 10,285) of subjects in the phase 3 
programme were on a background treatment of metformin and 5,151 subjects were treated with 
CANA and metformin. 
HbA1c was chosen as the primary endpoint in all phase 2/3 studies, which is in line with the 
“Note for Guidance on the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the treatment of 
diabetes mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00)”. Further to the evaluation of CANA on glycaemic 
endpoints, the effects of CANA on body weight, blood pressure and lipid parameters were 
investigated. Pharmacodynamic endpoints assessed in selected phase 3 studies to characterise 
the mechanism of action included RTG and beta-cell function/ insulin secretion endpoints. 
The placebo controlled phase 3 studies DIA3006, DIA3002 and DIA3012 had a core double blind 
period for the primary endpoint of 26 weeks. For the DIA3008 Insulin and SU sub-studies the 
primary efficacy evaluation was at 18 weeks. In the two active comparator non-inferiority studies 
(DIA3009 glimepiride, DIA3015 sitagliptin) the primary efficacy endpoint was at 52 weeks. 
Studies DIA3006 and DIA3002 had 26 week extension periods. Results of HbA1c at week 52 are 
submitted for these add-on to metformin studies. 
The patients included in the studies were representative for the target population. Patients with 
long-standing disease and diabetic complications such as (mild to moderate) renal impairment or 
CV disease were generally not excluded. Inadequate glycaemic control was defined in most of the 
studies as an HbA1c level of ≥7.0 and ≤10.5%, which is appropriate. 
Overall, 90% of subjects from the mITT analysis set for the pooled total CANA group completed 
the double-blind treatment period through the primary efficacy assessment, and this percentage 
Assessment report

was higher than that of the pooled placebo group (87%). The low number of discontinuations is 
re-assuring. 
Study DIA2003, which was newly submitted in support of the FDC, was designed to provide 
clinical data with twice daily dosing of CANA did not differ in design from the phase 3 studies. 
The core double blind period lasted for 18 weeks. 
No patients below the age of 18 were included in the development programme. A product specific 
waiver has been granted by the PDCO on 20 April 2011. 
Of the 5151 subjects exposed to CANA and MET across the phase 3 studies, 1408  were at least 
65 years of age, including 1218 who were 65 to<75 years of age, 189  who were 75 to <85 
years, and 1 subject who was ≥85 years. Hence, more than 100 geriatric patients were included 
in the phase 3 program and, as such, the requirement as outlined in EMA/ CHMP/ 
ICH/604661/2009 (ICH topic E7 Studies in Support of special populations: Geriatrics Q and A) is 
met. 
Scientific advice has been obtained from CHMP and was considered in the development plan. The 
clinical trials generally were considered to be well designed and conducted. During the review 
process, no concerns regarding GCP compliance arose. 
The statistical methods used are well described and considered appropriate. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results from phase 3 programme 
In  support  of  the  CANA/  MET  IR  FDC,  analyses  of  results  from  the  phase  3  CANA  programme 
relevant  to  this  FDC  were  evaluated.  All  studies  have  already  been  submitted  for  and  assessed 
during the marketing authorisation procedure of CANA mono. 
Across the phase 3 placebo-controlled add-on to metformin studies, the efficacy of canagliflozin 
in  lowering  HbA1c,  relative  to  placebo  (LS  mean  placebo  subtracted  difference),  was  generally 
consistent and ranged from -0.76% to -0.92% with the 300 mg dose and from 0.62% to 0.71% 
with  the  100  mg  dose.  Hence,  CANA  given  once  daily  add-on  to  metformin  led  to  a  dose 
dependent,  clinically  relevant  glycaemic  improvement.  Durability  of  glycaemic  control  was 
demonstrated by the week 52 data in studies DIA3006 and DIA 3002. 
In a 52-week active comparator-controlled study, non-inferiority of CANA 300 mg and 100 mg to 
glimepiride  (maximum  dose,  6  to  8  mg/day)  was  demonstrated.  Clinically  relevant  glycaemic 
improvements  were  observed  with  both  CANA  and  glimepiride  at  week  52:  the  adjusted  mean 
changes from baseline in HbA1c to Week 52 were -0.93% and -0.82% for the CANA 300 mg and 
100  mg  groups,  respectively,  and  -0.81%  for  the  glimepiride  group.  A  step  down  to  an 
assessment  of  superiority  was  pre-specified;  the  upper  limit  of  95%  CI  between  CANA  300  mg 
and glimepiride was <0%, demonstrating superiority for CANA 300mg to glimepiride. The HbA1c-
lowering response to CANA 100 mg was not superior to that of glimepiride in this study. 
CANA  300  mg  was  also  shown  to  have  non-inferior  efficacy  compared  to  sitagliptin  100  mg. 
Clinically  relevant  glycaemic  improvements  were  observed  with  both  agents:  the  change  from 
baseline  in  HbA1c  to  week  52  was  -1.03%  for  the  CANA  300  mg  group  and  -0.66%  for  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 85/130 
 
  
  
sitagliptin group. A step-down to an assessment of superiority was pre-specified; the upper limit 
of  95%  CI  between  CANA  300  mg  and  sitagliptin  was  <0%,  demonstrating  superiority  of  CANA 
300 mg to sitagliptin 100 mg. The 100 mg dose was not tested in this study. 
The favourable results on HbA1c were generally supported by the results on secondary glycaemic 
endpoints  (FPG,  postprandial  glucose  excursion  for  the  two  phase  3  studies  that  included  a 
MMTT) and discontinuation rates due to rescue therapy.  
Treatment  with  CANA  resulted  in  a  dose-dependent  reduction  in  total  body  weight  relative  to 
placebo.  The  effect  was  generally  consistent  across  placebo-controlled  phase  3  studies.  In  the 
pooled  dataset  of  placebo  controlled  studies  the  mean  percent  change  from  baseline  in  body 
weight  at  the  primary  assessment  timepoint,  relative  to  placebo,  was  -2.7%  (95%  CI:  [-2.9;-
2.4]) for the 300 mg dose and -2.0% (95% CI: [-2.3;-1.8]) for the 100 mg dose. Corresponding 
placebo-subtracted  LS  mean  absolute  reductions  in  body  weight  for  the  300  mg  and  100  mg 
groups for the pooled population of placebo-controlled studies were -2.43 kg (95% CI: [-2.652;-
2.199]) and -1.84 kg (95% CI: [-2.064;-1.611]), respectively. Statistically significant reductions 
from  baseline  in  percent  change  in  body  weight,  relative  to  glimepiride  (DIA3009,  mean 
differences 5.2 to 5.7 kg), for both doses of CANA, and sitagliptin (DIA3015), for the CANA 300 
mg dose, were observed (p<0.001 for all comparisons). Results of specialized body composition 
investigations  using  dual  energy  x-ray  absorptiometry  (DXA)  in    2  of  the  phase  3  studies 
(DIA3009,  DIA3010)  indicated  that  the  body  weight  reduction  with  CANA  was  attributable  to  a 
greater  decrease  in  body  fat  mass  relative  to  lean  body  mass  (with  approximately  2/3  as  fat 
mass loss). Hence, it was demonstrated that weight loss is predominantly due to loss of calories 
(urinary  nutrient  loss)  and  not  a  consequence  of  dehydration.  The  effect  on  body  weight  and 
composition  may  favourably  influence  CV  risk  in  the  frequently  obese  patients  with  T2DM. 
However, the effect size is insufficient for an anti-obesity claim (no such claim was made within 
this submission). 
Efficacy in subgroups 
Results of subgroup analyses performed in the pooled population of the placebo controlled phase 
3 studies found no important differences when comparing the effect of CANA in lowering HbA1c 
based on age, sex, race, and ethnicity, baseline BMI, or geographic region. As expected, greater 
reductions (significant interaction at an α=0.10 level) in HbA1c relative to placebo were observed 
with  CANA  among  subjects  with  higher  baseline  HbA1c  and  higher  GFR  values  compared  to 
subjects with lower baseline values. A baseline HbA1c-dependent glucose-lowering effect is also 
known from other anti-hyperglycaemic agents. 
As outlined above elderly patients were adequately represented in the phase 3 program. Of note, 
in study DIA3010, aiming at investigating the efficacy and safety of CANA in the elderly, the age 
distribution  did  not  differ  markedly  from  that  in  the  other  phase  3  studies  with  the  majority  of 
patients being below 65 years of age (55-65 years), less than 3% of patients between 65 and 75 
years of age, below 1% between 75 and 85 years, and no patient above 85 years. In this study, 
HbA1c  response  was  more  pronounced in  subjects  below 65  years  of  age  compared to  subjects 
above  65  years  (which  could  be  explained  by  a  higher  baseline  GFR  in  the  younger  group). 
However, the antihyperglycaemic effect was still clinically relevant in the elderly group. This was 
confirmed  by  the  results  of  the  pooled  placebo-controlled  population  for  subgroup  analyses: 
across  the  subgroups,  defined  by  a  cut-off  of  either  65  and  75  years,  clinically  relevant 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 86/130 
 
  
  
reductions  in  HbA1c  could  be  observed  for  both  doses  of  CANA  (in  the  oldest  subgroup, 
comprising  175  subjects,  adjusted  mean  changes  of  -0.65%  for  CANA  100  mg  and  -0.55%  for 
CANA  300  mg).  Hence,  efficacy  seems  to  be  maintained  in  the  elderly.  It  is  also  known  from 
another SGLT2-inhibitor that age per se does not influence efficacy. 
Unsurprisingly,  given  CANA’s  mechanism  of  action with  the  extent  of  UGE  being  proportional to 
renal  function,  the  efficacy  of  CANA  was  found  to  be  dependent  upon  baseline  GFR.  Subgroup 
analyses  performed  across  phase  3  studies  showed  a  gradual  decline  in  efficacy  of  CANA  with 
progressive renal impairment. This is however without implications for the present MAA since the 
proposed  labelling  contraindicates  the  FDC  in  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment  in  line 
with the existing contraindication for metformin in this patient group. 
Across  all  phase  3  studies,  clinically  relevant  lowering  of  SBP  and  DBP  was  observed,  which  is 
generally a desirable additional effect of CANA in the frequently hypertensive patients with T2DM. 
Since  a  BP-lowering  effect  is  not  usually  expected  for  a  glucose-lowering  drug,  appropriate 
labelling is warranted to create awareness among physicians and patients and to minimize risks 
in vulnerable patients (see safety section). 
Overall,  by  improving  glycaemic  control,  reducing  weight/fat  mass  and  BP,  CANA  treatment  in 
combination  with  metformin  is  expected  to  reduce  microvascular  risk  and  may  also  favourably 
influence CV risk in patients with T2DM. 
Results from bridging studies (Summary phase 1 and in extension DIA2003) 
Study DIA2003 (CANA bid + MET vs. Placebo + MET) was performed to support the CANA/ MET 
IR  FDC,  which  will  be  dosed  twice  daily,  consistent  with  the  dosing  of  metformin  IR.  The  study 
showed reductions in HbA1c, FPG, and percent body weight, and an increase in the proportion of 
subjects achieving the HbA1c target <7.0%. Compared with study DIA 3006 (CANA qd + MET vs. 
Placebo  +  MET),  the  magnitude  of  reduction  in  HbA1c  as  well  as  effects  on  secondary 
antihyperglycaemic  endpoints  observed  in  DIA2003  were  smaller  and  for  the  50  mg  bid  dose 
were of borderline clinical significance. 
This  may  at  least  partly  be  explained  by  baseline  differences:  in  study  DIA2003  mean  baseline 
HbA1c  was  7.6%  (5.6-10.1%)  and  in  study  DIA3006  mean  baseline  HbA1c  was  8.0%  (6.3-
10.7%). Among other things, the lower baseline values were due to the fact that 22.2% of the 
patients  included  had  week  2  HbA1c  values  below  7%.  Results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis 
excluding  these  patients  showed  that  subjects  in  this  study  with  baseline  HbA1c  <7.0% 
attenuated the results from the primary efficacy analysis modestly in the 150 bid group, but not 
in the 50 mg bid group. 
To further investigate the impact of baseline HbA1c between studies DIA2003 and DIA3006 the 
Applicant  conducted  a  simulation  (“bootstrap  simulation”)  to  assess  the  potential  impact  of 
baseline glycaemic control in studies DIA2003 and DIA3006 on the primary efficacy results. From 
the  study  DIA3006  population,  10000  simulation  datasets  matching  the  distribution  of  HbA1c 
baseline  values  of  study  DIA2003  in  6  categories  were  analysed  by  ANCOVA  (similar  to  the 
primary analysis in study DIA3006). HbA1c point estimates were calculated as overall mean from 
the  bootstrapped  datasets  using  placebo-subtracted  ANCOVA  LS  mean  changes  and  95% 
confidence  intervals  were  estimated  by  the  lower  2.5%  and  upper  97.5%  of  the  bootstrap 
population  results.  The  bootstrap  method  used  is  considered  appropriate  and  acceptable  to 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 87/130 
 
  
  
match  baseline  characteristics  of  the  two  studies  compared.  It  was  found  that,  after 
compensation  for  differences  in  baseline  HbA1c  distribution  between  studies,  the  placebo-
subtracted changes in HbA1c for both CANA doses in DIA2003 are numerically consistent with a 
similar subgroup of patients from DIA3006 at the same total daily dose. 
Although  baseline  differences  in  HbA1c  (7.6%  versus  8.0%)  are  considered  modest,  these 
differences  may  partly  explain  the  differences  in  efficacy  (effect  on  HbA1c).  For  comparison,  a 
subgroup  analysis  by  baseline  HbA1c  has  been  conducted  within  the  MAA  for  CANA  as  a 
monotherapy and the effect (placebo subtracted LS mean change) were -0.63% and -0.47% for 
CANA  300  mg  and  100  mg,  respectively,  in  the  HbA1c  <8%  subgroup,  -1.15%  and  -1.01%, 
respectively, in the HbA1c 8-9% subgroup, and -1.6% and -1.08% in the HbA1c ≥ 9% subgroup. 
Overall,  as  demonstrated  by  the  bootstrap  simulation,  the  differences  in  efficacy  are  at  least 
partly  due  to  differences  in  baseline  HbA1c.  Interstudy  variability  may  also  have  contributed  to 
the divergent results. 
Unfortunately,  the  design  of  study  DIA2003  does  not  allow  a  direct  comparison  between  once 
daily and twice daily dosing. However, similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses 
(24  hour  mean  renal  glucose  threshold)  were  demonstrated  in  a  phase  1  study  (DIA1032) 
regardless of once or twice daily administration (for details please refer to pharmacology section 
of this AR). 
Overall,  efficacy  of  CANA  combined  with  MET  seems  to  be  maintained  when  given  bid  at  the 
same total daily doses. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of the CANA/ MET FDC has been demonstrated. The fixed combination is considered 
justified. Since type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease requiring long term treatment, a fixed 
combination provides advantages for the patient and is expected to improve compliance in this 
usually already heavily medicated patient group. Adequate bridging data have been provided to 
extrapolate efficacy from the phase 3 CANA monotherapy programme to the FDC. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
For all of the phase 3 studies, safety evaluations included the collection of adverse events, safety 
laboratory tests (including haematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), 12-lead electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate), body weight, physical examinations, self-
monitored blood glucose (SMBG), and collection of potential hypoglycaemic episodes (e.g., from 
the subject diary provided to subjects). In study DIA3010, bone mineral density was assessed as 
well as bone formation and bone resorption markers.  
Several safety monitoring committees were commissioned for the phase 3 program: 
•  An independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EAC) reviewed blinded data for selected 
adverse events, including major adverse cardiovascular events plus events of unstable angina 
(MACE-plus), hospitalized congestive heart failure, venous thromboembolism/pulmonary 
embolism, and all deaths. 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 88/130 
 
  
  
•  Independent assessment committees reviewed blinded data for assessment of fracture 
(Fracture Adjudication Committee [FAC]), hepatic (Hepatic Events Assessment Committee 
[HEAC]), and renal events (Clinical Events Committee [CEC]). 
•  An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) reviewed unblinded serious adverse 
events and CV events. 
The IDMC, which included diabetologists, cardiologists, statisticians, and a consultant oncologist, 
monitored unblinded analyses of serious adverse events and specific CV events at specific regular 
intervals across the entire clinical development program for CANA. 
The phase 3 clinical studies that provided the primary support for the canagliflozin (JNJ-
28431754; CANA) Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) also provide the primary support 
for the canagliflozin/metformin immediate release (CANA/MET IR) fixed-dose combination (FDC) 
MAA. The safety results are mainly from two pools of phase 3 studies created from patients with 
metformin background therapy: 
•  A pooled dataset (DS1-M) including 3 placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (DIA3002, 
DIA3006, and DIA3012) in which canagliflozin was added to subjects on 
antihyperglycemic agent (AHA) regimens including metformin (alone or in combination 
with other oral AHAs). 
•  A pooled dataset (DS3M-LT2) including those subjects whose background diabetes 
therapy at baseline included metformin from 6 Phase 3 studies (DIA3002, DIA3006, 
DIA3008, DIA3009, DIA3010, and DIA3012), with a data cutoff date of 01 July 2012. 
Data sets based only on patients receiving CANA in combination with metformin are marked by 
an “M” in their name. Simultaneously, the Applicant provided a further update (later data cutoff) 
of the broad dataset (DS3) submitted for the CANA mono MAA. This update is called DS3-LT2. 
DS1 is a dataset which was also already submitted with the CANA mono MAA and comprises 
placebo-controlled trials of shorter duration.  
Most study patients, namely 73%, had metformin included in their therapy regimen (4471 out of 
6177 patients received CANA). Therefore, the differences in size between the data sets of 
patients receiving metformin vs. all patients are not very large.

There were no remarkable imbalances in the baseline characteristics of the different treatment 
groups (placebo, CANA 100 mg and CANA 300 mg). Overall, there were more males than 
females in the study program but the female population with T2DM is nevertheless adequately 
reflected in the clinical trial program. A large proportion of patients were white so that the study 
results are relevant for the European population. Diabetes duration, baseline HbA1c and BMI 
indicate that the population is representative for diabetic patients in daily practice. The 
percentage of patients with at least one vascular complication was rather low (around 20%) so 
that the studied diabetic population appears rather healthy. The number of elderly patients (≥75 
years) was below 100 in each dose group of the CANA-metformin pool, which is lower than in the 
CANA mono program and can be explained by the exclusion of patients for whom metformin is 
contraindicated. However, relevant conclusions on this age group can also be drawn from data on 
CANA in general (irrespective of combination with metformin).

Note: A subject is counted in the 6-month, 12-month, 18-month and 24-month exposure if 
his/her duration of treatment is greater or equal to 24 weeks, 50 weeks, 76 weeks, and 102 
weeks. 
Note: The summary is based on modified intent-to-treat set which included all randomized 
subjects that took at least one dose of study treatment. 
Thus, up to 24 months the number of exposed patients is considered high enough to allow 
meaningful conclusions. 
Adverse events 
The following table (Table 17) summarises the incidence of adverse events (AEs) in the broadest

a Related to study drug includes following relationships as determined by investigator: possibly 
related, probably related and very likely related. 
The overall rate of AEs and serious AEs is fairly balanced between the treatment groups in both 
data sets, DS3M-LT2 and DS3-LT2. In both data sets there is also a slight increase in the 
incidence of AEs related to study drug and AEs leading to discontinuation in the CANA groups 
compared to the non-CANA group. In DS3M-LT2, the incidence of SAEs was slightly lower in all 
treatment groups (including Non-CANA) than in DS3-LT2. This is probably due to the fact that 
patients with more severe background disease are often not eligible for metformin treatment due 
to contraindications. 
The AEs considered related and leading to discontinuation were often genital or urinary tract 
infections, a known side effect of SGLT2 inhibitors (see also section on discontinuation due to AEs 
below). 
The most frequent AEs, sorted by organ system, in patients receiving the CANA-metformin 
combination are tabulated below. Salient differences between CANA and comparator are marked 
in bold.

number of events, prior to use of rescue medication 
Most of the imbalances displayed in the table above reflect the known physiological actions of 
CANA or known side effects resulting from them. These comprise e.g. thirst, pollakiuria and all 
signs of urogenital infection. Vice versa, the incidence of hypertension was reduced with CANA. 
All other imbalances listed in the table above are not considered meaningful, either because of 
being too small or because the absolute number of patients affected is very low. 
There were no meaningful differences between DS3M-LT2 and DS3-LT2. 
AEs of special interest: 
It is known that certain antidiabetics may aggravate hypoglycaemia when combined with 
hypoglycaemic agents although they do not cause hypoglycaemia when administered alone. 
Therefore the Applicant provided an evaluation of hypoglycaemic events separated for studies 
with vs. without background therapy with hypoglycaemic agents (suphonylureas, insulin). 
In the phase 3 studies the Applicant defined documented hypoglycaemias as follows: 
•  Biochemically documented hypoglycaemic episode: a hypoglycaemic episode with a 
concurrent reported fingerstick glucose of ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) (regardless of the 
presence of symptoms). 
•  Severe hypoglycaemic episode: when the answer “Yes” was recorded to any of the 
following 3 questions on the hypoglycaemia eCRF: “Did the subject require the assistance 
of others to treat?”, “Did the subject lose consciousness during the episode?”, or “Did the 
subject have a seizure during the episode?” 
The following tables reveal that CANA itself does not induce hypoglycaemia to a relevant extent. 
Also, when CANA is administered along with a non-hypoglycaemic agent including metformin the

The combination CANA + metformin does not appear to induce clinically relevant hypoglycaemia 
when given alone. However, addition of CANA to agents with high hypoglycaemic propensity (SU 
or insulin here) leads to a higher rate of hypoglycaemias than SU or insulin alone. This is also 
known for other glucose-lowering agents that are not associated with hypoglycaemia themselves. 
In two of these studies metformin was part of the background therapy but the combination CANA 
+ metformin was not measured against placebo. Hence the exact role of metformin cannot be 
delineated, but most likely metformin does not influence hypoglycaemia rate to a large extent. 
Increased hypoglycaemia in combination with SU or insulin is adequately labelled in the SmPC 
and listed as identified risk in the RMP. 
SGLT2 inhibitors lead to the steady presence of glucose in urine which may favour proliferation of 
microorganisms in the urogenital tract. The following two tables provide the frequency of 
urinary tract infections (UTI) in patients treated with CANA +metformin.

The incidence of UTI overall was only slightly higher with CANA than with placebo. Few events 
led to discontinuation and few events were serious. There was a numerically higher incidence of 
serious AEs including urosepsis in patients treated with 100 mg but not in patients treated with 
300 mg CANA. Due to the small event numbers the relevance of this finding is not clear. The 
prescriber should be aware of UTI as a possible side effect of CANA. This is adequately reflected 
in the SmPC and listed as identified risk in the RMP. 
Genital infections are also known side effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. In females the following 
event rates were reported in the broad data set (DS3-LT2):

There was a clearly and highly increased incidence of genital infections, mostly mycotic 
vulvovaginitis, in both CANA/metformin dose groups. Most of these events were considered 
related to study drug by the investigator, most likely because this is an expected side effect of 
SGLT2 inhibition. Part of these events also led to discontinuation of study drug. Reassuringly, no 
serious AEs related to genital infection were observed. Genital infections are appropriately 
labelled in the SmPC and listed as identified risk in the RMP. 
The following table gives a short overview of genital infections in males.

The table above reveals that also in males the rate of genital infections is strongly increased with 
CANA/metformin. However, the absolute numbers are much lower than in females, reflecting the 
fact that males are much less predisposed to genital infection than females. Again, no serious 
events of genital infection were observed. 
Regarding markers of renal function, there was a consistent decrease in eGFR associated with 
CANA use , caused by an increase in serum creatinine. This may either reflect decreased renal 
function and renal damage or may simply be a consequence of the haemoconcentration that is 
known to occur with SGT2 inhibitors. To exclude renal damage the Applicant collected post-
treatment data of eGFR from 371 patients who discontinued treatment, shown in the figure 
below.

Mean Percent Change (+/-SE) in eGFR For Subjects Who Discontinued and Have a Post 
Treatment Value (>5 to <60 Days After the Last Study Medication) – Regardless of Use 
of Rescue Medication (ISS Phase 3 Broad Dataset: Safety Analysis Set) 
Data from more than 100 patients per group of the broad dataset (including high CV risk 
patients) clearly show that eGFR returns to baseline values after cessation of CANA therapy. This 
observation largely excludes renal damage by CANA and strongly argues for dehydration as the 
cause for the observed decrease in eGFR during CANA therapy, at least in this data set (DS3).  
The osmotic diuresis induced by SGLT2 inhibition can result in changes associated with volume 
depletion Thus, signs of volume depletion and AEs linked to volume depletion can be expected 
with CANA therapy. The following tables list the incidence of AEs related to dehydration in 
general as well as the most frequent individual events. Results from DS3M-LT2 are shown.

CANA clearly increased the incidence in volume depletion related events in a dose-dependent 
manner, most pronounced for hypotension; (pre)syncopal events were uncommon and did not 
clearly differ between treatment groups. The effect was smaller in DS3M-LT2 as compared to 
DS3-LT2. This is probably due to the fact that patients with higher degrees of renal impairment 
or other more severe background disease have a higher risk for CANA-dependent volume 
depletion but are less likely to be eligible for metformin treatment and hence less frequently 
represented in DS3M-LT2. 
Reassuringly, serious AEs were not increased in the 300 mg CANA group; the slight increase in 
the 100 mg CANA group in DS3M-LT2 is probably a chance finding. Hypotension could be a 
problem in patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy 
with a history of hypotension, elderly patients or patients with (intercurrent) conditions that may 
lead to volume depletion. Care should be taken when using CANA/metformin in these patients. 
This is reflected in the SmPC and dehydration-related events are included as identified risk in the 
RMP. The influence of concomitant therapy with diuretics and antihypertensive drugs is presented 
in the section on interactions below. 
A serious complication of dehydration and haemoconcentration is venous thrombosis. 
Therefore the Applicant summarised all relevant AEs that are related to venous thrombosis. The 
percentage of VTE was very low (0.2 to 0.3%) so that even the large dataset does not allow firm 
conclusions. It cannot be fully excluded that 300 mg CANA increase the risk of total VTE and 
serious VTE but the very low absolute number of events indicates that VTE is no major problem 
of CANA therapy. 
A meta-analysis for cardiovascular (CV) events of phase 2 and 3 canagliflozin studies in 
subjects with T2DM was performed in accordance with FDA Guidance Diabetes Mellitus - 
Evaluating Cardiovascular Risk in New Antidiabetic Therapies to Treat Type 2 Diabetes. 
Prospectively adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, including CV death, 
nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], and nonfatal stroke) and events of hospitalized unstable 
angina (collectively referred to as MACE-Plus) are included in the meta-analysis. An independent 
Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EAC), composed of external specialists classified the outcome 
events while blinded to treatment assignment. The meta-analysis was based upon a pooled 
population of subjects with T2DM receiving at least one dose of CANA (mITT set) 100 or 300 mg 
in the well-controlled, randomized studies of at least 12 weeks in duration. Study DIA3015 is not 
included because of the later database lock and it did not include both 100 and 300mg dosage 
strengths of canagliflozin. 
In the meta-analysis performed, the CV events are fairly balanced between the treatment groups 
in both evaluations. It is reassuring that the event rate for MACE was nearly identical between

There was a slight trend for a higher risk for strokes, HR was 1.47 (95% CI: 0.83, 2.59). The 
majority were non-fatal ischemic strokes and occurred in both CANA groups (100 mg and 300 
mg). It is not yet clear whether this finding is due to chance. Thus, strokes need to be further 
followed post-marketing in the CV outcome study CANVAS and in the PSURs; the evaluation of 
the MACE-Plus endpoint gave similar results. 
The following tables summarise the main results for MACE and MACE-Plus events, stratified for

According to the results tabulated above, patients with high CV risk have a higher HR for CANA-
related CV events than patients with low CV risk. However, even in the high risk (CANVAS and 
CANVAS-like) patients the HR is close to 1, and the upper limit of the 95% CI is acceptable 
(around 1.4 for MACE and MACE-plus). Further results will become available from the ongoing 
CANVAS study. 
The Applicant also summarised the incidence of AEs related to congestive heart failure. In the 
Non-CANA group of the broad dataset, 0.31% of patients presented with this diagnosis. There 
was a lower incidence in the two CANA groups, 0.13% and 0.16% for 100 and 300 mg CANA, 
respectively. 
Metformin is known not to increase the incidence of CV events so that focussing on CANA + 
metformin patients only is not expected to change the picture; in fact most of the study patients 
received a co-treatment with metformin.

A slight imbalance between CANA and comparator is obvious. This was driven by a more 
pronounced imbalance in the CV outcome study CANVAS. The Applicant provided an analysis of 
fracture events in the CANVAS study (data cut-off 31 May 2013), see table below.

a  Incidence is based on the number of subjects with at least one fracture and not number of 
events. Incidence rates are per 1,000 subject-years, where a subject’s follow-up time 
(subject-year) is calculated from the first dose date to the first fracture event date. 
b  HR is from the Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by study ID. 
In contrast to the fracture imbalance in the CANVAS study, an examination of adjudicated 
fractures in the pooled non-CANVAS studies of the Phase 3 program (N=5,867) through Week 52 
revealed a slightly higher incidence rate in the Non-CANA group. The incidences were 10.8, 
12.0, and 14.1 events per 1,000 patient-years for CANA 100 mg, CANA 300 mg and Non-CANA, 
respectively. 
The Kaplan-Meier plot indicates that the difference between CANA and comparator became 
obvious very early in treatment (after around 6 weeks). Usually bone changes (e.g. noticeable 
decrease in bone density) need more time to develop. On the other hand, the increase in 
fractures may be due to increased falls related to CANA-induced dizziness or hypotension. Most 
fractures that occurred briefly after onset of CANA therapy were located in the upper extremity 
and were related to falls. At least in one case a temporal relationship between low blood pressure 
and fall could be established. The CANVAS study included patients with high CV risk, i.e. a

population which may be particularly sensitive to CANA-induced haemodynamic changes. In fact, 
an increased rate of falls were observed in the CANA 300 mg group of the CANVAS trial with the 
majority of the excess cases occurring within the first 16-24 weeks of treatment initiation; the 
100 mg dose behaved similar to comparator, see Kaplan-Meier plot below.

These data reveal only small (<1% in most cases) changes in both directions in BMD in the bone 
regions tested.  
Nonclinical studies and phase 1/2 trials demonstrated that CANA has phototoxic potential, 
although only at high light intensity which is considered clinically irrelevant. In phase 3 studies 
the incidence of all AEs potentially related to photosensitivity was numerically increased in the 
CANA groups than in the non-CANA group, see table below, but reassuringly the number of 
events was low.

Overall, phototoxicity is rare, even in the presence of CANA. This is in agreement with the 
findings of the phase 1 and phase 2 studies. There was a marked increase in the incidence of 
skin ulcer in the broad dataset. However, these ulcers were located on leg and foot, and the 
imbalance in their incidence was most likely due to the observed imbalance in the baseline rate 
of microvascular disorders.  
The Applicant provided an updated analysis of bladder cancer cases (cut-off date 31 Dec 2013). 
Bladder tumour adverse events occurred at a low and similar incidence across treatment groups, 
see table below. The 95% confidence intervals around the difference between each canagliflozin 
treatment group (including All Cana) and the pooled control group (“All Non-cana”), included 
zero. All bladder tumour adverse events occurring in the non-canagliflozin group were in subjects 
on placebo.

years for the canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg and non-canagliflozin groups, 
respectively. From this, it can be calculated that there were 0.86, 1.16 and 0.84 cases per 1000 
subject years in the CANA 100, CANA 300 and Non-CANA group, respectively.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
There was no increase in overall death rate in the CANA groups as compared to control, see 
section on Adverse Events above. Serious AEs (SAEs) were overall balanced between the CANA 
and non-CANA groups. Furthermore, no individual SAE or organ system was markedly 
imbalanced between the groups.  
In the non-clinical 2-year rat carcinogenesis study (see Non-Clinical AR for details) three types of 
neoplasms became obvious which were apparently related to CANA administration. These were 
phaeochromocytomas, Leydig cell tumours of the testis and renal tumours. Far the most of the 
phaeochromocytomas and all Leydig cell tumours were benign. The kidney tumours were benign 
or malignant but were highly differentiated and displayed a histopathological picture that 
markedly differed from known spontaneous kidney tumours in rats (and also humans). In the 
mouse carcinogenicity study no CANA-related neoplasms became obvious. 
The Applicant conducted mechanistic studies in the rat strain which had revealed the tumours 
and concluded that SGLT1 inhibition by CANA at high doses in the small intestine with 
consecutive glucose malabsorption plays a crucial role. According to this hypothesis the reduced 
pH in the gut lumen leads to the absorption of higher than usual amounts of calcium from food. 
To keep the calcium serum level within the normal range the kidney has to excrete this 
excessively resorbed calcium. The need to excrete high amounts of calcium (nearly 10-fold the 
normal amount) could be responsible for the observed kidney changes (hyperplasia, 
inflammation, tumours). The inflammation may be caused by the observed mineralisation 
(probably calcium phosphate crystals) in the renal cortex. This mechanism appears plausible. It 
also appears irrelevant for humans since there are no hints for major carbohydrate 
malabsorption in humans as determined in the clinical trials DIA1007 and DIA1022. It should be 
noted that the oral bioavailability of CANA is markedly lower in rats than in humans (around 35% 
in rats compared to 65% in humans). Therefore, with a given CANA dose a markedly higher 
fraction remains in the gut in rats and is able to block SGLT1 transporters locally. Kidney 
changes were markedly reduced when the rats received a glucose-free diet which sharply 
reduced renal calcium excretion. Simultaneously, cell division and hypertrophy in the adrenal 
cortex were no longer observed with glucose-free diet, leading to the conclusion that the 
phaeochromocytomas were also caused by malabsorption (although the mechanism is not fully 
clear). 
Leydig cell tumours were explained by the Applicant by increased LH (luteinising hormone) levels 
caused by CANA in rats. The reason why CANA influenced LH (and testosterone) levels in rats is 
not clear, but no such changes were observed in humans as determined in the dedicated phase 1 
trial DIA2001. 
In the DS3 data set (shorter observation time than DS3-LT2), there was a slight imbalance in the 
overall neoplasm incidence, i.e., 2.17% (67/3085) neoplasms in the CANA 300 mg group vs. 
1.68% (55/3262) in the non-CANA group (ratio 1.29). However, in the DS3-LT1 data set (longer 
observation time of the same patients), this imbalance was diminished, i.e., 2.92% (90/3085) 
neoplasms in the CANA 300 mg vs. 2.51% (82/3262) neoplasms in the CANA 300 vs. non-CANA 
group (ratio of 1.16). In the latest evaluation (cut-off date 31 Dec 2012) the ratio further 
dropped to 1.04 (2.56% in the All CANA and 2.45% in the comparator group). The imbalance in 
bladder tumours found with another SGLT-2 inhibitor was not observed for CANA. Thus, there is 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 105/130 
 
  
  
no hint from clinical data that the rat findings could be relevant for humans or that CANA is 
generally associated with an increased tumour risk. For further reassurance the Applicant also 
provided a Forrest Plot showing the hazard ratios (HRs) for individual tumour types: 
Hazard Ratio for AEs in the Primary SOC of Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and 
Unspecified (Pooled Dataset DS3, through a cut-off date of 31 December 2012) 
It can be derived from this figure that the HRs for the individual tumour types scatter around 
unity, with some types having HRs above (e.g. blood and skin tumours) and others revealing HRs 
below one (e.g. gastrointestinal and renal/urinary). There are no outliers and no tumour type has 
a HR which is different from 1 in a statistically significant way. Thus, this pattern fits the 
assumption of a random distribution with the mean (overall) HR of 1. 
Laboratory findings 
Decrease in blood pressure and slight and dose-dependent increases in haemoglobin (hb), 
haematocrit (hct)and serum electrolytes were observed with CANA and are apparently linked 
to its pharmacodynamic action (water and salt loss). The regularly observed hb and hct increase 
(Hb: mean increase -0.8, 6.9 and 7.6 g/L for placebo, CANA 100 and CANA 300 mg, 
respectively) did not lead to an increased incidence of hb or hct being above the upper limit of 
normal. Serum creatinine also increased with CANA treatment, probably due to 
haemoconcentration. 
The following table displays the incidence of marked in blood pressure changes from baseline 
to week 26. Blood pressure increase was less frequent and decrease was more frequent with

CANA/met. The BP lowering effect of CANA is most likely related to its diuretic action. The mean 
arterial blood pressure decreased with CANA vs. placebo by around 5 mm Hg (systolic) and 
around 3 mm Hg (diastolic) in the broad data set.

No relevant changes in liver parameters were observed, and there was no hint that CANA 
induces liver injury. 
Apart from the PD-related laboratory findings outlined above CANA also induced small but 
consistent changes in serum lipids; most pronounced were increases in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) 
and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio remained essentially unchanged. A post-
hoc performed NMR-spectroscopy to assess LDL-C particle number showed that the increase in 
the total LDL-C particle number was driven primarily by a large increase in particle number of the 
large LDL-C subfraction with little or no change in the small LDL-C particle number, hence 
leading to an increase in the less atherogenic subfraction. The increase in serum lipoproteins 
could also be due to haemoconcentration. This would be in line with the finding that LDL-C and 
HDL-C increased to around the same amount.  
CANA also caused slight and dose-dependent mean changes in serum bicarbonate (decrease), 
serum magnesium (increase) and serum sodium (increase) which became obvious shortly 
after onset of treatment (within 6 weeks). The observed changes were small and the serum 
levels of these electrolytes usually remained within the normal range.  
Safety in special populations 
In the older population (over 75 years) the incidence of AEs was rather high in all groups 
(CANA and Non-CANA), probably because of background disease. AEs considered related to 
study drug were clearly increased in all CANA groups vs. the Non-CANA group. It is, however, 
reassuring that serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were not increased with CANA as 
compared to control. Nevertheless, due to the low number of subjects the numbers shown above 
have to be interpreted with caution. 
It can be assumed that most diabetic patients over 75 years of age will have some degree of 
renal impairment. The Applicant worked out that the increase in AE incidence (any AE) is much 
more pronounced in patients ≥75 if moderate renal insufficiency is present. In patients of this 
age group with better renal function (no or mild renal impairment) the AE incidence (any AE) is 
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014

hardly different from placebo. Hence, the decreased tolerability of CANA may to a large extent 
depend on accompanying disease and not on age per se. Thus, there are no hints for special 
risks of CANA/MET in patients ≥75 years with eGFR ≥60. For patients with lower eGFR 
CANA/MET is not intended anyway because of the MET component.  
Immunological events 
The adverse event of hypersensitivity was reported in 9 (0.3%) subjects in the canagliflozin 100 
mg (1 subject had 2 events), 6 (0.2%) subjects in the canagliflozin 300 mg and 1 (<0.1%) 
subject in the non-CANA groups. In 6 subjects in the combined canagliflozin group, reported 
terms suggested environmental allergies and in 9 subjects reported terms were non-specific 
hypersensitivity. The majority of the events were considered by the investigator as mild or 
moderate in severity and not related to the study drug. Two of 15 subjects in the combined 
canagliflozin group had events of hypersensitivity that led to discontinuation of study drug. In 
both subjects who discontinued, the events were considered by the investigator as related to 
study drug, and in 1 of the 2 subjects who discontinued the event was serious (Type I allergic 
reaction on Day 1, 1 hour after CANA intake). No other subjects had serious events of 
hypersensitivity or events that were considered related to study drug. The incidence and nature 
of hypersensitivity reactions meets the expectations for a drug substance. There a no hints for a 
particularly high allergenic potential of CANA. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The most relevant interactions of CANA are expected with diuretics and blood pressure lowering 
agents. As shown in the table below, adverse events related to volume depletion were markedly 
increased with CANA 300 mg in patients with a background therapy of loop diuretics or 
antihypertensive drugs of the ACE/ARB class. The effect was less pronounced with other 
diuretics. Thus, use of CANA/MET should not be recommended in patients taking loop diuretics.

Discontinuation due to AEs 
There was some imbalance in the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation between CANA and 
control, most pronounced in the high-dose CANA group (5.0%, 5.6% and 7.3% for Non-CANA, 
CANA 100 mg and CANA 300 mg in combination with metformin, respectively). This imbalance 
was largely due to sequelae of increased diuresis or to urinary tract and genital infections. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety information of the drug combination CANA + MET is based on the phase 2 and phase 
3 studies that were conducted with CANA. From these studies patients who concomitantly 
received metformin were selected and combined to safety data sets comparing CANA + 
metformin treated patients with patients receiving metformin + placebo or active comparator. In 
addition to metformin, other antidiabetic background therapy was used in some studies. Due to 
the design of the studies, adverse events due to metformin itself will not be detected. This is 
acceptable since the safety profile of metformin is well established. For comparison, data sets 
were also built from all patients treated with CANA (vs. comparator), irrespective of co-
treatment. Around 70% of the study patients in the whole phase 2/3 development program 
received CANA in combination with metformin. 
The safety profile of CANA largely met the expectations for an SGLT2 inhibitor. It was not 
relevantly changed by co-treatment with metformin. Overall, the tolerability of CANA/metformin 
appeared to be slightly better than with CANA alone, but this is most likely due to the fact that 
patients on CANA + MET had less severe background disease (e.g. renal insufficiency) since 
metformin is not given to these patients. Thus, the discussion below, mainly focussing on the 
safety of CANA, is also valid for the combination CANA/MET. 
CANA-dependent increased glucose excretion via urine leads to osmotic diuresis and thereby 
water loss. Simultaneously, since SGLT2 is also a sodium carrier (sodium-glucose co-
transporter), there is also sodium loss. In consequence, haemoconcentration may occur, which 
manifests itself not primarily as hypernatraemia (although serum sodium becomes slightly 
increased within the normal range) but usually as increased haematocrit and haemoglobin. In 
fact, haemoglobin regularly increases during CANA therapy to some extent (mean increase from 
140 g/L to 148 g/L after 52 weeks). Water and sodium loss may lead to dehydration with all its 
sequelae including hypotension and syncope in vulnerable patients. The frequency of 
dehydration-related adverse events was dose-dependently increased with CANA therapy. 
Accordingly, the mean arterial blood pressure decreased with CANA by around 5 mm Hg 
(systolic) and around 3 mm Hg (diastolic) in the broad data set. Principally, the blood pressure 
lowering effect is a desirable effect in the frequently hypertensive, overweight patient with type 2 
diabetes but needs to be appropriately labelled because such an effect is not usually expected for 
a glucose-lowering agent. Caution should be exercised in patients for whom a dapagliflozin 
induced drop in blood pressure could pose a risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular 
disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension, elderly patients or 
patients with (intercurrent) conditions that may lead to volume depletion. The starting dose for 
CANA is 50 mg bid. This is expected to minimise the risk of relevant AEs shortly after treatment 
initiation.

Glucose in urine favours urogenital infections. As with other SGLT2 inhibitors, the most 
pronounced increase was observed in genital infections, mainly of mycotic origin. Severe, 
ascending urinary tract infections were rare and not apparently increased with the use of CANA. 
Urogenital infections are considered manageable if the patient and prescriber are aware of the 
risk. This is addressed in the SmPC. Therefore, these events are not regarded as a major safety 
concern. 
CANA was phototoxic in non-clinical tests. Dedicated phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials revealed 
that acute or delayed photosensitivity reactions are unlikely at the light intensities of normal 
sunlight. The incidence of adverse events of skin and subcutaneous tissue was increased in 
CANA-treated patients, but this increase was due to probably diabetes-related skin ulcers located 
at the leg or foot and could be explained by a baseline imbalance in pre-existing microvascular 
disease. Metformin is not phototoxic and is not expected to enhance CANA effects in this respect. 
Bone fractures, in particular low-trauma fractures were slightly increased with CANA. However, 
this difference manifested itself already a few weeks after onset of treatment so that CANA-
dependent changes in bone structure or density are an unlikely reason. In fact, DXA 
measurements up to 104 weeks of therapy did not reveal a relevant effect of CANA on BMD. In 
addition, serum markers of bone turnover and PTH levels did not change relevantly (the latter 
actually slightly decreased with CANA use compared to comparator in patients with renal 
impairment). These results do not indicate a CANA-induced urinary calcium loss or otherwise 
negative effect on bone. On the other hand, it turned out that the fracture imbalance resulted 
from the CV outcome study CANVAS. In this study there was a clearly increased incidence of falls 
after initiation of treatment with 300 mg/d CANA; for the 100mg/d dose the fall incidence 
remained similar to comparator. CANVAS included patients with high CV risk that may be more 
vulnerable to sequelae of CANA-induced water loss, in particular in the 300 mg/d group (see 
above). The risk of falls and thereby bone fractures will be minimised by the reduced starting 
dose of 50 mg bid. Appropriate warnings for cautionary measures in patients with known CV 
disease are included in the SmPC. 
Antidiabetic agents may lead to hypoglycaemia, depending on their mechanism of action. With 
CANA, the amount of excreted glucose is lower with lower blood glucose levels so that the 
hypoglycaemic action of CANA should be limited. Nevertheless, CANA slightly increased the 
incidence of documented low blood glucose levels (≤ 70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) in the absence of a 
hypoglycaemic background therapy, but clinically more relevant hypoglycaemia (blood glucose 
below 56 mg/dL [3.1 mmol/L]) was rare and balanced under these circumstances. As observed 
with other antidiabetic agents with a low propensity to cause hypoglycaemia when given alone, 
CANA markedly increased the incidence of hypoglycaemia vs. placebo if the background therapy 
included insulin or sulphonylureas. Thus, care should be taken when CANA/MET is added to 
insulin or sulphonylureas and dose reduction of the latter medications may be considered. 
Reassuringly, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemias was not increased with CANA.  
The kidney is the primary target organ for CANA. Therefore, CANA may behave differently in 
patients with relevant (at least moderate) renal impairment not only from an efficacy (see 
efficacy section) but also from a safety perspective. However, due to the metformin component, 
the combination CANA/MET is not intended for use in these patients so that a discussion of safety 
of CANA in this population is not required.

In a CV meta-analysis across trials there was no increased risk of CANA vs. comparator (active or 
placebo) for the combined CV endpoint MACE or MACE-plus (the latter including MACE and 
hospitalisation for unstable angina). The hazard ratio (HR) for MACE was close to unity with an 
acceptable upper limit of the 95% CI (HR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.70, 1.37), reasonably excluding a 
relevant increase in CV risk of CANA. Remarkably, there was a rather pronounced numerical 
difference in HR of MACE and MACE-plus between patients with high CV risk (CANVAS criteria) 
and patients not meeting the CANVAS inclusion criteria (lower CV risk). Nevertheless, even in the 
patients with high CV risk, the HR with CANA did not exceed 1 with an acceptable upper limit of 
the 95% CI of around 1.4 for MACE and MACE-plus. Therefore, no increased CV risk due to CANA 
is expected. Taken together, the data suggest that patients with lower CV risk may potentially 
derive a CV benefit from treatment with CANA, whereas this may not to be the case for patients 
with established CV disease or a clearly increased risk thereof (CANVAS population). The data 
also suggest that patients on CANA are at lower risk to develop congestive heart failure 
compared to patients on comparator, which may be explained by the diuretic effect of CANA.  
There was a slight trend for a higher incidence of strokes, HR was 1.47 (95% CI: 0.83, 2.59). 
The majority were non-fatal ischemic strokes and occurred in both CANA groups (100 mg and 
300 mg). It is not yet clear whether this finding is due to chance. Thus, strokes will be further 
followed post-marketing in the CV outcome study CANVAS and in the PSURs. 
Carcinogenicity studies in animals with CANA revealed neoplastic findings in rats but not in mice. 
Benign and malignant tumours of the renal cortex and the adrenal medulla 
(phaechromocytomas) were observed as well as benign Leydig cell tumours of the testes. For the 
renal tumours the Applicant provided a reasonable explanation. CANA is not well absorbed in the 
gut of rats and therefore causes a rather high local inhibition of SGLT1 in the intestine. In 
consequence, less glucose but more calcium (because of reduced luminal pH) becomes absorbed. 
These high amounts of calcium have to be excreted by the kidney which in turn leads to 
hyperplasia, inflammation and tumours. A glucose-free diet could prevent these changes. 
Although the mechanism for the induction of phaeochromocytomas is unknown, this diet also 
prevented hypertrophy of the adrenal medulla. Since no relevant carbohydrate malabsorption 
with CANA was observed in humans, the rat findings are considered not relevant for humans. 
The combination CANA/MET was not tested in carcinogenicity studies. This is acceptable since 
there is no hint that metformin induces neoplasms or promotes tumour development. 
For further assurance the Applicant provided an analysis of the broadest data set (irrespective of 
combination with metformin) with a late data cut-off (31 Dec 2012) and calculated hazard ratios 
(HRs) for overall tumours and also for each type of tumour (according to the location in an organ 
system). This analysis revealed a HR of 1.00 for all neoplasms and showed that the HRs of the 
individual tumour types are randomly distributed around one, without outlier. Thus, the expected 
pattern of a random distribution resulted, strongly indicating that CANA is not associated with 
tumours. 
For another SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, a numerical increase in bladder cancer cases was 
initially observed. Therefore, the Applicant followed these events for CANA and provided an 
updated analysis (cut-off date 31 Dec 2013). The incidence of bladder cancer in the CANA trials 
was low and within the expected range; there was no meaningful difference in incidence or cases 
per subject years between the CANA and comparator groups. The Applicant plans to follow 
bladder cancer further in ongoing and future studies. This is considered appropriate.

There was an increase in serum LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). The LDL-
C/HDL-C ratio, however, remained essentially unchanged. Reassuringly, the LDL-C increase was 
mainly driven by the less atherogenic subfraction of large particles. So far, there is no evidence 
for an increased CV risk associated with CANA. The CV outcome study is still ongoing and will 
provide further long-term data particularly on patients with high CV risk.  
Metformin is a well-established substance with a well-known safety profile. The most common 
side effects are headache and gastrointestinal symptoms. Approximately 10-25% of patients 
starting metformin report nausea, indigestion, abdominal cramps, bloating, diarrhea, or some 
combination of these. Metformin has direct effects on gastrointestinal function including glucose 
and bile salt absorption. Metformin has been associated with serious lactic acidosis. The 
estimated incidence of lactic acidosis attributable to metformin use is 3-6 per 100,000 patient-
years of treatment. 
The mechanism of action of metformin is highly different from that of CANA so that no relevant 
interactions in regard to safety are expected. The data presented by the Applicant in patients 
simultaneously treated with CANA and metformin gives no hint for worse tolerability of CANA or 
metformin when administered in combination. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of the CANA/MET IR FDC is acceptable for the following reasons. Metformin did 
not decrease the safety and tolerability of CANA. The safety profile of metformin and the 
resulting precautionary measures are well known.  
CANA revealed the expected safety profile of an SGLT2 inhibitor. Due to enhanced renal glucose 
and sodium excretion, CANA may lead to dehydration and its sequelae, to low blood sugar levels 
(mainly in combination with insulin or insulin secretatogues) and urogenital infections 
(particularly genital mycoses). In general, these safety issues appear manageable.  
Based on its mechanism of action, CANA decreases blood pressure which could be favourable in 
many Type 2 diabetics. However, the prescriber and patient should be aware of these effects 
because they are unexpected for a diabetes drug and care should be taken in potentially 
vulnerable patients. This is reflected in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the product information. 
Based on currently available data, CV safety of CANA is reasonably well demonstrated. The 
imbalance in strokes not favouring CANA is of concern but based on a limited number of cases 
and needs ongoing monitoring. Further data from the CV outcome study are awaited post-
marketing. 
The slight imbalance in low-trauma bone fractures (not favouring CANA) cannot be explained by 
renal calcium loss or otherwise adverse effects of CANA on bone. Fractures were mainly due to 
falls which could have been a consequence of CANA-induced drop in blood pressure. The latter 
was mainly observed upon initiation of treatment. This effect will be blunted by the lower starting 
dose of 50 mg bid. 
Non-clinical data indicate phototoxicity of CANA but clinical data indicate that this would play only 
a role at artificially high light intensities. Phase 3 trials indicate that serious photosensitivity 
reactions are highly unlikely and are therefore not regarded as a relevant concern.  
Assessment report  
EMA/179391/2014 
Page 112/130 
 
  
  
In non-clinical studies malignant neoplasms (in the kidney and adrenal gland of rats) were 
observed which were most likely species-specific. In patients, there was no notable imbalance in 
the incidence of neoplasms in the CANA vs. comparator group in the latest safety evaluation. 
Taken together, the combination CANA/metformin is considered approvable from a safety point 
of view with appropriate labelling and post-marketing measures. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils 
the legislative requirements.    
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 4, the PRAC considered by 
consensus that the risk management system for Canagliflozin/Metformin hydrochloride (fixed-
dose combination) (Vokanamet) indicated in adults aged 18 years and older with T2DM could 
be acceptable provided an updated risk management plan and satisfactory responses to the 
List of Outstanding issues are submitted (i.e. to include bladder cancer as important potential 
risk in the RMP).    
The CHMP endorsed this advice with changes. 
These changes concerned the following elements of the Risk Management Plan: 
The CHMP did not agree to the PRAC request that “Bladder cancer should be included as an 
important potential risk”. The CHMP requested that long term safety data on bladder cancer 
should be considered as missing information. 
The CHMP justified these changes as follows: 
The CHMP, having viewed the non-clinical and clinical data submitted in this application 
concluded that there was no signal for bladder cancer and thus bladder cancer could not be 
considered as an important potential risk of CANA. However, taking into account the numerical 
imbalances in bladder cancer found in the dapagliflozin studies, the CHMP was of the view that 
bladder cancer should be further investigated post-marketing also for CANA and therefore the 
Committee recommended that the lack of long-term safety data on bladder cancer be included 
in the RMP as missing information. 
The CHMP agreed to version 5 of the Risk Management Plan, which included the following:

product. 
The CHMP also considered that the studies in the post-authorisation development plan are 
sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures.

Contraindications (Section 4.3) to metformin due to 
increased risk of lactic acidosis include: moderate 
and severe renal impairment; acute conditions with 
potential to alter renal function; acute or chronic 
disease which may cause tissue hypoxia; hepatic 
impairment, acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism. 
Special warnings and precautions for use (Section 
4.4) describes risk factors and at risk subpopulations, 
diagnosis and management of lactic acidosis. 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other 
forms of interaction (Section 4.5) describes increased 
risk of lactic acidosis in acute alcohol intoxication 
and with cationic drugs that are eliminated by renal 
tubular secretion eg, cimetidine. It also states 
intravascular administration of iodinated contrast 
agents in radiological studies may lead to renal 
failure, resulting in metformin accumulation and risk 
of lactic acidosis. Therefore, canagliflozin/metformin 
HCl FDC must be discontinued prior to or at the time 
of the test, not reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards 
and only after renal function has been re-evaluated 
and found to be normal. 
Undesirable effects (Section 4.8) lists lactic acidosis 
as adverse drug reaction.  
Overdose (Section 4.9) states high overdose of

dose of metformin already being taken or the nearest 
therapeutically appropriate dose. For patients who 
are tolerating a canagliflozin/metformin HCl FDC 
dose containing canagliflozin 50 mg who need 
tighter glycaemic control, the dose can be increased 
to canagliflozin/metformin HCl FDC containing 150 
mg canagliflozin twice daily. Care should be taken 
when increasing the dose in patients for whom the 
initial canagliflozin induced diuresis poses a risk, eg, 
patients ≥75 years of age, patients with known

cardiovascular disease. If there is evidence of 
volume depletion, this should be corrected prior to 
initiating canagliflozin/metformin HCl FDC.  For 
patients switching from separate tablets of 
canagliflozin and metformin, dose titration with 
canagliflozin (added to the optimal dose of 
metformin) should be considered before the patient 
is switched to canagliflozin/metformin HCl FDC. 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
(Section 4.4) states adverse reactions related to 
volume depletion were seen more commonly with 
the 300 mg dose and occurred most frequently within 
the first 3 months of treatment. Caution should be 
exercised in patients for whom a 
canagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure could 
pose a risk, such as patients with known 
cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-hypertensive 
therapy with a history of hypotension, patients on 
diuretics, or elderly patients (≥65 years of age). 
Patients should be counselled to report symptoms of 
volume depletion and, in case of intercurrent 
conditions that may lead to volume depletion, careful 
monitoring of volume status is recommended. 
Temporary interruption of treatment may be 
considered for patients who develop volume 
depletion, until the condition is corrected. 
Canagliflozin is not recommended for use in patients 
on loop diuretics or who are volume depleted, 
eg, due to acute illness (such as gastrointestinal 
illness). Undesirable effects (Section 4.8) lists 
postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, 
hypotension, dehydration, and syncope as adverse 
drug reactions related to volume depletion.

Special warnings and precautions for use (Section 
4.4) states that in patients ≥75 years of age, greater 
decreases in eGFR were reported with canagliflozin 
therapy. As metformin is excreted by the kidney, 
eGFR or CrCl should be determined before 
initiating treatment and regularly thereafter: 
At least annually in patients with normal renal 
function. 
At least 2 to 4 times a year in patients with 
eGFR at the lower limit of normal and in 
elderly patients.  
Decreased renal function in elderly patients is 
frequent and asymptomatic. Special caution should 
be exercised in situations where renal function may 
become impaired; for example, when initiating 
antihypertensive or diuretic therapy and when 
starting treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-

Undesirable effects (Section 4.8) lists Blood 
creatinine increased and Blood urea increased as 
adverse drug reactions.  
Special warnings and precautions for use (Section

shown excretion of canagliflozin/metabolites in milk, 
as well as pharmacologically mediated effects in 
breast-feeding offspring and juvenile rats exposed to

canagliflozin 50 mg who need tighter glycaemic

canagliflozin/metformin HCl FDC containing 150 
mg canagliflozin twice daily. Care should be taken 
when increasing the dose of canagliflozin/metformin 
HCl FDC in patients ≥75 years of age. For patients 
switching from separate tablets of canagliflozin and 
metformin, dose titration with canagliflozin (added 
to the optimal dose of metformin) should be 
considered before the patient is switched to 
canagliflozin/metformin HCl FDC. Because 
metformin is eliminated in part by the kidney and 
elderly patients are more likely to have decreased 
renal function, canagliflozin/metformin HCl FDC 
should be used with caution as age increases. 
Regular assessment of renal function is necessary to 
aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic 
acidosis. The risk of volume depletion associated 
with canagliflozin should be taken into account.   
Special warnings and precautions for use 
(Section 4.4) describes a higher incidence of adverse 
reactions associated with volume depletion (eg, 
postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension,

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed 
indication.  
2.9.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as 
set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal 
products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Adequate bridging data have been submitted which allow for extrapolating the results of the 
CANA phase 3 programme, which used a qd dosing regimen of CANA, to the bid dosed FDC 
applied for.  
In the phase 3 programme, about 70% of patients were on a metformin-based background 
regimen relevant to the current application. The monotherapy study (DIA3005) and the add-on 
to SU-substudy (DIA 3008) provide additional support for the efficacy of CANA. 
CANA 100 mg and 300 mg per day, compared to placebo, provided consistent, statistically 
significant and clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control when given as monotherapy 
in patients intolerant to metformin or as add-on to other AHAs including insulin. 
CANA was shown to have non-inferior antihyperglycaemic efficacy compared to glimepiride and 
sitagliptin after 52 weeks of treatment with both active comparators titrated to a sufficiently high 
dose to achieve full glucose lowering potential. For CANA 300mg even superiority over both 
active comparators was demonstrated. 
CANA  was  associated  with  a  consistent  decrease  in  body  weight  from  baseline.  This  effect  was 
especially  evident  in  comparison  to  SU  (difference  in  weight  5.2  kg  and 5.7  kg  for  100 mg  and 
300  mg  CANA,  respectively).  Body  composition  investigations  indicated  that  the  body  weight 
reduction  with  CANA  was  attributable  to  a  greater  decrease  in  body  fat  mass  relative  to  lean 
body  mass  (with  approximately  2/3  as  fat  mass loss).  The  weight  loss  can  be  explained by  the 
CANA-induced nutrient loss via urinary glucose excretion. Fluid loss appears to play only a minor 
role. 
Across  all  phase  3  studies  clinically  relevant  lowering  of  SBP  and  DBP  was  observed,  which  is 
considered  a  beneficial  additional  effect  of  CANA  in  the  frequently  hypertensive  patients  with 
T2DM. However, caution should be exercised in vulnerable patients who may experience adverse

reactions due to a CANA-induced drop in blood pressure or volume depletion. This is addressed 
by appropriate labelling. 
CANA  itself  has  low  propensity  to  cause  hypoglycaemia.  This  was  especially  evident  in 
comparison to glimepiride (hypoglycaemia incidence 3.1 vs. 1.9 vs. 12.7% in the CANA 100 mg, 
CANA 300 mg and glimepiride groups, respectively). 
CANA has also been shown to be efficacious in elderly patients, who were adequately 
represented in the study program. 
Durability of antihyperglycaemic efficacy was maintained in several 52 week extension studies. 
Efficacy of the metformin component is considered well established. 
Since type II diabetes is a chronic disease requiring long term treatment a fixed combination is 
expected to provide advantages for the patients as regards convenience and compliance. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
A transient post dose delay of intestinal glucose absorption has been observed with 300 mg qd 
administration but not with lower doses, e.g. 150 mg qd. A dose related inhibition of intestinal 
SGLT1 has been discussed as a possible explanation. However, the magnitude of the effect is 
small and considered to be without clinical relevance in patients switching from a qd regimen 
(e.g. coadministration of CANA and metformin) to a bid regimen with the FDC CANA/MET. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
According to its mechanism of action, CANA leads to dose- and blood glucose-dependent osmotic 
diuresis with increased urine volume and glucosuria. Resulting potential adverse events are 
genital infection, haemoconcentration/dehydration, electrolyte disturbances and arterial 
hypotension. These are established AEs for SGLT2 inhibitors. In line with the observed 
haemoconcentration, increases in serum creatinine and, consequently, decreases in calculated 
eGFR are observed upon treatment initiation, which are in general attenuated with continued 
treatment and reversible after cessation of treatment and do not indicate renal damage. 
Older patients and patients with relevant impairment of their renal function appear more 
vulnerable to the effects of CANA on water and electrolyte balance, resulting in more frequent 
dehydration-related AEs, especially at the 300 mg dose. However, due to its metformin 
component, the FDC CANA/MET is not intended for use in patients with moderate renal 
impairment.  
The risk of dehydration is markedly increased in patients concomitantly taking loop diuretics. 
Therefore, this combination is not recommended. A potential canagliflozin-induced drop in blood 
pressure could pose a risk in patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on 
antihypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension, elderly patients or patients with 
(intercurrent) conditions that may lead to volume depletion. The starting dose of 50 mg bid 
appears appropriate for these patients. In case of concomitantly taken antihypertensive agents, 
dose adjustments may be necessary.

Genital infections, mainly fungal infections, are clearly increased with CANA use, especially in 
females. There was only a slight increase in UTIs and no imbalance in serious/severe urogenital 
infections.  
Similar to other glucose-lowering agents that have low hypoglycaemic potential themselves, 
CANA increases the frequency of hypoglycaemic events when given in combination with insulin or 
an insulin secretagogue. Even then, however, severe hypoglycaemic events are rare and of 
similar frequency as observed with placebo. 
The unfavourable effects of metformin are well established; most frequent are headache, 
nausea/vomiting, flatulence and diarrhoea. Lactic acidosis is rare. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
CV safety of CANA has been reasonably well established (MACE events in the meta-analysis 
including all patients from the phase 2/3 trials: HR 0.98, upper limit of the 95%CI 1.37). 
However, there was a concern that haemodynamic changes as induced by CANA, especially upon 
treatment initiation, could be less well tolerated in patients with pre-existing CV disease. An 
additional meta-analysis including all patients with increased CV risk (i.e. meeting the CANVAS 
inclusion criteria) was provided showing that the HR (CANA vs. non-CANA group) did not exceed 
1 with an acceptable upper limit of the 95% CI of around 1.4 for both MACE and MACE-plus, 
which is reassuring. 
There was a small, questionable increase in bone fractures, starting rather soon after 
commencement of CANA treatment. Measurements of BMD (52-week data), bone markers, 
urinary calcium and PTH do not indicate urinary calcium loss or an otherwise detrimental effect of 
CANA on bone. Based on the information obtained, the small excess rate of fractures could be 
due to a higher frequency of falls related to CANA-induced decrease in blood pressure. Any such 
effect is expected to be blunted by the recommended starting dose of 100 mg/day.  
For another SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, a numerical increase in bladder cancer cases was 
observed in the pre-licensing studies. Therefore, and despite the absence of a non-clinical signal, 
bladder cancer has been included as potential risk in the RMP of dapagliflozin. Although the 
clinical safety data for CANA do not indicate a notable imbalance in incidence or cases per subject 
years between the CANA and comparator groups, the lack of long-term safety data on bladder 
cancer should be included as missing information in the RMP of CANA/MET. The Applicant plans 
to follow bladder cancer further in ongoing and future studies, which was considered appropriate 
by the CHMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Favourable effects 
The most important effect of an antihyperglycaemic agent is its ability to improve glycaemic 
control. The antihyperglycaemic efficacy of metformin is well-established. CANA added to 
metformin has been shown to confer an additional clinically relevant improvement in glycaemic 
control, thus justifying the combination of these substances. The effect of CANA appears to be 
maintained in the long-term based on the available data (up to week 52).

The reduction in body weight is an additional benefit in the usually obese patients with T2DM. 
The majority of the weight loss appears to be due to loss of fat mass including visceral fat and is 
sustained. CANA was superior in reducing body weight as compared to glimepiride and 
sitagliptin. 
CANA appears to reduce insulin requirements by reducing glucose load. This is considered 
favourable since insulin induced weight gain is alleviated. In addition, the reduced burden on 
beta cells may have long-term benefits with regard to beta-cell function/diabetes progression, 
which would, however, need to be further investigated and confirmed. 
The observed reduction in blood pressure is beneficial in hypertensive patients as it may 
contribute to a reduction in CV risk.  
The low propensity of CANA to cause hypoglycaemia is considered a beneficial effect which may 
be particularly relevant in patients at increased risk of hypoglycaemia. 
The fixed combination product may enhance patient convenience and compliance in an often 
already heavily medicated patient population. 
Unfavourable effects 
The most important risk of CANA is drop in blood pressure and dehydration and its sequelae in 
vulnerable patients. Since such effects are usually not expected for a glucose-lowering agent, 
these have been appropriately labelled to increase awareness among physicians and patients. 
The small excess rate in bone fractures are unlikely to reflect direct effects of CANA on bone but 
a causal relationship with CANA-induced drop in blood pressure and related falls cannot be 
excluded.  
Genital infections were usually not serious and are considered manageable. Thus, genital 
infections, although frequent and unpleasant, are no important risk. The frequencies of urinary 
tract infections were nearly balanced between CANA and comparator and thus are not considered 
a major concern. 
The safety profile of metformin is well known; frequent adverse events include headache and 
gastrointestinal symptoms which usually do not pose a relevant risk. A rare but severe side effect 
of metformin is lactic acidosis, but its occurrence can be largely avoided by adhering to the 
known contraindications. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk ratio of CANA/MET is considered favourable.  
The antihyperglycaemic efficacy of metformin is well-established and CANA, as add-on to 
metformin, confers additional clinically relevant improvement in glycaemic control, thus justifying 
the combination of these substances. The safety profile of the combination CANA and MET is 
acceptable and the risks are considered manageable in clinical practice and are appropriately 
labelled.

Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The fixed dose combination of CANA and MET could clearly be a valuable asset to the already 
existing treatment options for T2DM. Both active substances contribute to the overall treatment 
effect of this FDC. The effect is clearly clinically relevant and can be achieved with the fixed 
combination alone or in combination with other antihyperglycaemic agents of different product 
classes including insulin. Adverse events are in most cases a consequence of the pharmacologic 
action of CANA and appear in general manageable in the overall patient population and hence do 
not preclude the granting of the Marketing Authorisation. Metformin has a positive benefit-risk 
balance which is not changed by the addition of CANA. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Vokanamet in the treatment of  
adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise 
to improve glycaemic control: 
● 
in patients not adequately controlled on their maximally tolerated doses of metformin 
alone 
● 
in patients on their maximally tolerated doses of metformin along with other 
glucose-lowering medicinal products including insulin, when these do not provide adequate 
glycaemic control (see sections 4.4, 4.5, and 5.1 for available data on different add-on 
therapies) 
● 
in patients already being treated with the combination of canagliflozin and metformin as 
separate tablets. 
is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation subject 
to the following conditions:

1.   Executive Summary 
Nimenrix is a quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine composed of the capsular 
polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y, each conjugated to tetanus 
toxoid.  
Nimenrix was authorised via the centralised procedure on 20th April 2012 for active immunisation of 
individuals from the age of 12 months and above against invasive meningococcal disease caused by 
Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. 
The company has submitted the report for paediatric study [MenACWY-TT-020 EXT015 Year 5] in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. This report presents the persistence 
results at 5 years after vaccination. 
The company has stated that, in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the 
data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for Nimenrix. SmPC and PL changes arising 
from the currently submitted data are not proposed (the company has submitted a type II variation 
(EMEA/H/C/2226/II/009, currently under review) to update the SmPC with persistence data up to 4 
years after primary vaccination). 
2.  Recommendation 
Regulatory action is not required. 
3.  Introduction 
Nimenrix is a quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine composed of the capsular 
polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y, each conjugated to tetanus 
toxoid. 
Nimenrix was authorised via the centralised procedure on 20th April 2012 for active immunisation of 
individuals from the age of 12 months and above against invasive meningococcal disease caused by 
Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. A single dose is recommended in all age groups. 
The need for booster doses remains to be established. 
The company now submits the report for paediatric study MenACWY-TT-020 EXT015 Year 5 in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. This report presents the persistence 
results at 5 years after vaccination. 
The overall study has consisted of two phases: the vaccination phase study [MenACWY-TT-015] and 
the long-term persistence phase (1 to 5 years) after vaccination studies [MenACWY-TT-016 EXT: 015 
Y1]; [MenACWY-TT-017 EXT: 015 Y2]; [MenACWY-TT-018 EXT: 015 Y3]; [MenACWY-TT-019 EXT: 015 
Y4] and [MenACWY-TT-020 EXT: 015 Y5]. 
The primary phase study MenACWY-TT-015 and the follow-up studies after 1 and 2 years (MenACWY-
TT-016 and 017 respectively) were submitted as part of the initial MAA for Nimenrix. Years 3 and 4 
follow-up data in studies MenACWY-TT-018 and MenACWY-TT-019 have been previously submitted and 
assessed under Article 46. The company has submitted a type II variation (EMEA/H/C/2226/II/009, 
currently under review) to update the SmPC with persistence data up to 4 years after primary 
vaccination

Further follow-up of the subjects is planned up to 10 years after primary vaccination in MenACWY-TT-
015. 
4.  Scientific Discussion 
Study: [MenACWY-TT-020 EXT: 015 Y5] 
EudraCT number: 2012-002722-75 
Study title: A phase IIb, open, randomised, controlled primary vaccination study to evaluate the non-
inferiority and the persistence of the immune response of GSK Biologicals' meningococcal serogroup 
ACWY conjugate vaccine (Nimenrix) given intramuscularly versus Mencevax ACWY given 
subcutaneously to healthy subjects aged 11 to 55 years of age. 
Assessor comment: the study has been described in previous assessment reports: a brief outline is 
given here.  
The study design is shown in the following figures:

Study [MenACWY-TT-020 EXT: 015 Y5] was conducted in the Saudi Arabia and the Philippines. This 
study evaluated the persistence of the immune response and the occurrence of serious adverse events 
related to vaccination and events related to lack of vaccine efficacy up to 5 years after vaccination with 
Nimenrix or the Mencevax ACWY control vaccine in study [MenACWY-TT-015].  
The primary end-point was related to the vaccination phase and has been previously assessed 
(Secondary) endpoints: 
• 
Immunogenicity: One, two, three, four and five years after vaccination (for evaluation of the 
persistence), in all evaluable subjects: rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-
MenY titres ≥1:8 and titres. 
•  Reactogenicity and safety: occurrence of serious adverse events (including meningococcal 
diseases) related to vaccination and any event related to lack of vaccine efficacy from the last 
visit of the vaccination phase up to the last visit of the long-term persistence phase (5 years 
after vaccination). 
Study initiation date: 03 January 2012 
Study completion date: 16 February 2013 
Data lock point (Date of database freeze): 22 May 2013 
Due to a delay in the annual approval from the Institutional Review Board for the Year 5 persistence 
time point of the current study, all 333 subjects enrolled at the Philippine study sites attended the Year 
5 visit outside the adapted intervals between vaccination at Visit 1 in the primary study [MenACWY-TT-
015] and the Year 5 blood sampling time point in the current study. As a result, all 333 Philippine 
subjects were eliminated from the ‘according to protocol’ analysis at Year 5 because of non-compliance 
with the blood sampling schedule. 
Assessor comment: 70 subjects remained ‘according to protocol’ whilst 333 subjects were excluded 
as a result of delay in approval. As a result of this mishap, the results of this 5-year follow-up study 
are much compromised and so only a brief description of results is presented in this assessment.  
The company has sought to retrieve the situation by describing two cohorts, ‘according to protocol’ 
cohort and ‘Total Cohort Year 5’, as described immediately below: 
Two cohorts were defined for the purpose of analysis of antibody persistence. 
The Total Cohort Year 5 included all vaccinated subjects in the vaccination phase (study [MenACWY-
TT-015]) who came back for the Year 5 follow-up. For the analysis of persistence, this includes all 
vaccinated subjects for whom data concerning persistence endpoint measures were available. 
The ‘according-to-protocol’ cohort for persistence Year 5 included all evaluable subjects:

•  who received the vaccine during the vaccination phase; 
•  who had not received a previous dose of meningococcal serogroup A, C, W-135 or Y vaccines 
except the study vaccine before Year 5; 
•  who had available assay results for at least one tested antigen at the Year 5 time point.

Results 
Clinical efficacy 
The demographic characteristics of the ‘according to protocol’ cohort for persistence Year 5 are 
presented in the following table: 
Based on the ‘according to protocol’ cohort for persistence Year 5 analysis, the percentage of subjects 
with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY titres ≥1:8 was 84.3%, 72.5%, 86.3% 
and 92.2%, respectively, in the ACWY-TT group and 57.9%, 38.9%, 31.6% and 63.2%, respectively, 
in the MenPS group.

The demographic characteristics of the Total Cohort Year 5 are presented in the following table: 
Based on the Total Cohort Year 5 analysis, the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, 
rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY titres ≥1:8 was 90.0%, 79.3%, 71.6% and 84.3%, respectively, in 
the ACWY-TT group and 74.3%, 71.2%, 24.8% and 44.8%, respectively, in the MenPS group. 
Assessor comment: the results, as presented, would not appear to give rise to any particular 
concerns regarding the current product. The company had already decided to undergo a variation 
procedure (EMEA/H/C/2226/II/009, currently under review) based on year 4 data. The company will 
be able to provide further information at the 10-year check on subjects. The overall value of the study, 
therefore, will not be lost. 
Clinical safety 
No serious adverse events related to vaccination or events related to lack of efficacy have been 
reported since vaccination in study [MenACWY-TT-015] up to five years post-vaccination. 
Since the Year 4 persistence visit, six pregnancies were reported which all resulted in birth of a live 
infant with no apparent congenital anomalies. 
Assessor comment: no additional comment.

5.  Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion and Recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
It is not possible to provide substantive comment on the clinical efficacy results because 333 subjects 
(out of 405) had not followed the study protocol at the time of the year 5 check. The company had 
already decided to undergo a variation procedure (EMEA/H/C/2226/II/009, currently under review) 
based on year 4 data. The company will be able to provide further information at the 10-year check on 
subjects. The overall value of the study, therefore, will not be lost. 
The results on clinical safety do not give rise to any particular concerns. 
Recommendation  
The Rapporteur concludes that the benefit / risk for Nimenrix is unchanged by data submitted in the 
current report and that there is no consequential need for regulatory action.

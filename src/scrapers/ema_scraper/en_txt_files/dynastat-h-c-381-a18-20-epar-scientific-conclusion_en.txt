SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS FOR AMENDMENT OF PRODUCT INFORMATION 
In  September  2004,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  of  rofecoxib  (a  selective  Cox-2-
inhibitor) informed the EMEA that new clinical trial (APPROVe) data for rofecoxib have revealed a 
risk  of  thrombotic  cardiovascular  (CV)  events.  These  data  resulted  in  the  worldwide  withdrawal  of 
Vioxx (rofecoxib) from the market on 30 September 2004 by the MAH and raised questions regarding 
the cardiovascular safety of other Cox-2 inhibitors.  
Further  to  discussions  at  the  CHMP  October  2004  plenary  meeting,  the  European  Commission 
recommended that this public health issue on all aspects of cardiovascular safety including thrombotic 
events  and  cardio-renal  events  is  the  subject  of  Community  referrals  under  Article  31  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC,  as  amended  regarding  decentrally  authorised  products  containing  celecoxib,  etoricoxib 
and lumiracoxib and subject to a review procedure under Article 18 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 
2309/93,  as  amended  regarding  the  centrally  authorised  products  containing  celecoxib  (Onsenal), 
parecoxib (Dynastat/Rayzon) and valdecoxib (Bextra/Valdyn), which were started in November 2004. 
During  the  CHMP  meeting  of  February  2005,  discussions  on  cardiovascular  safety  took  place.  The 
CHMP  agreed  that  an  Urgent  Safety  Restriction  (USR)  on  cardiovascular  safety  was  needed  to 
introduce  new  contraindications  and  strengthen  warnings  and  information  on side effects in the SPC 
and  the  Package  Leaflet  (PL).  This  USR  was  initiated  on  16  February  2005  and  finalised  on 
17 February 2005. 
On  7  April  2005,  the  FDA  (Food  and  Drug  Administration)  and  the  EMEA  requested  that  Pfizer 
voluntarily  withdraw  Bextra  (valdecoxib)  from  the  market  and  Pfizer  agreed  to  suspend  sale  and 
marketing of Bextra worldwide pending further discussions on the unfavorable risk versus benefit due 
to data on serious skin reactions.   
On 20 April 2005, Pfizer presented data on serious skin reactions for valdecoxib during a hearing.  
Further  to  a  request  from  the  European  Commission,  the  scope  of  the  ongoing  class  review  was 
broadened to include the assessment of serious skin reactions in addition to the cardiovascular safety 
aspects. 
Between  November  2004  and  June  2005,  the  MAH  made  oral  explanations  to  the  CHMP  on 
cardiovascular and skin safety aspects for Dynastat on 18 January, 20 April and 25 May 2005. 
On 23 June 2005, the CHMP concluded that: 
(cid:131)  Further to the assessment of: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the new data provided on rofecoxib by the APPROVe clinical study, which revealed a risk 
of thrombotic CV events, 
the  data  on  celecoxib  presented  in  the  APC  study,  which  suggested  a  dose-related 
increased risk of serious CV events, 
the  data  on  valdecoxib  and  parecoxib  presented  in  the  CABG  (Coronary  Artery  Bypass 
Graft)  and  in  the  CABG  II  studies,  which  showed  a  higher  rate  of  serious  CV 
thromboembolic events in the parecoxib/valdecoxib treatment arm compared to the group 
of patients receiving placebo, 
the  data  on  etoricoxib  in  the  EDGE  study  and  pooled  analyses  of  other  clinical  trials, 
which suggested an association with a higher thrombotic risk than naproxen, 
the  data  on  lumiracoxib  in  the  Target  study,  which  suggested  a  small  increase  in 
thrombotic events (especially myocardial infarction) versus naproxen, 
all available data show an increased risk of CV adverse reactions for Cox-2 inhibitors as a class and 
agreed that there is an association between duration and dose of intake and the probability of suffering 
a CV reaction.

(cid:131)  Further  to  the  assessment  of  the  data  on  serious  skin  reactions,  parecoxib  is  associated  with 
very rare occurrence of serious skin reactions, as evidenced in post-marketing surveillance.  
The  CHMP  confirmed  changes  to  the  Product  Information  already  introduced  through  a  type  II 
variation adopted in April 2005 further to the February USR and requested further changes. 
The changes of the Product Information related to the CV can be summarised as follows: 
-  Addition of a statement that decision to prescribe a selective COX-2 inhibitor should be based 
on an assessment of the individual patient's overall risks, 
-  Addition of the contraindications Established ischaemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular 
disease and Peripheral arterial disease, 
-  Addition  of  a  warning  for  patients  with  risk  factors  for  heart  disease,  such  as  hypertension, 
hyperlipidaemia (high cholesterol levels), diabetes and smoking,  
-  Addition  of  a  warning  for  prescribers  to  consider  discontinuation  of  therapy  if  during 
treatment, patients deteriorate in any of the organ system functions described, 
-  Addition of a warning for prescribers not to discontinue antiplatelet therapies, 
The changes of the Product Information related to the SCAR can be summarised as follows: 
-  Addition of a contra-indication for patients with a history of any drug allergy, 
-  Addition of a warning to report that the onset of skin reactions occur in the majority of cases 
within the first month of treatment, 
-  Addition of a warning for prescribers to monitor any serious skin reactions, which could occur 
during the treatment, 
-  Addition of a warning for patients to immediately report any emergent skin condition to their 
physician. 
GROUNDS FOR AMENDMENT OF PRODUCT INFORMATION 
Whereas, the CHMP 
- 
- 
- 
is  of  the  Opinion  that  the  benefit/risk  balance  of  Dynastat  in  the  short-term  treatment  of 
postoperative pain remains favourable and the Marketing Authorisations should be maintained 
according  to  revised  Summaries  of  Product  Characteristics  and  Package  Leaflet  (attached  in 
Annex I and IIIB, respectively of the CHMP Opinion), 
concluded that the cardiovascular safety and  serious skin reactions should be continuously and 
carefully monitored and assessed,  
recommended follow-up measures to further investigate the safety of parecoxib.

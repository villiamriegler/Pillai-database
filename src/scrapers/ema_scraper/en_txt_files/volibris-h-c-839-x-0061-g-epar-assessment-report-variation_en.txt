2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed therapeutic indication is: 
Volibris is indicated for treatment of PAH in adolescents and children (aged 8 to less than 18  years) of 
WHO Functional  Class (FC) II to III including use in combination treatment.  Efficacy has been shown in 
IPAH, familial, corrected congenital and in PAH associated with  connective tissue disease. 
PAH is a rare, progressive, highly debilitating  disorder characterized by angioproliferative vasculopathy 
in the pulmonary arterioles, leading to  endothelial and smooth muscle proliferation and dysfunction, 
inflammation and thrombosis. These changes increase pulmonary vascular resistance and subsequent 
pulmonary arterial pressure, causing right  ventricular failure which leads to  eventual death if untreated 
[Lan et al. Diseases 2018, 6:  38]. 
Similar to  adults, paediatric PAH is defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) ≥25  mmHg 
at rest with  a normal pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤15  mmHg and an increased 
pulmonary vascular resistance >3  Wood units  x m2 (≈240 dyn s cm–5) in the absence of lung disease 
[Beghetti et al. Paediatric 
Pulmonology, 2019  Oct;54(10):1516-1526].  However, there are important known differences in 
vascular function, foetal origins of disease, growth and development, genetics, natural history, 
underlying disease, responses of the right  ventricle, responsiveness to PAH-specific therapies, and 
gaps in knowledge, particularly in the youngest age groups [Abman et al. Circulation. 2015;  132: 
2037–99]. 
The most frequent causes of PAH in children are idiopathic  (IPAH), heritable gene defects, and 
congenital heart disease (CHD); however, connective tissue disease, human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV), drugs, and portopulmonary hypertension are also rare causes in this  population [Beghetti et al., 
2019]. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Large scale epidemiology studies of PAH in children have not  been conducted and there is no or limited 
outcome data in paediatric PAH patients.  In the  United Kingdom (UK), survival in treated children with 
idiopathic PAH at 1, 3  and 5  years was 89%, 84%,  and 75% respectively; whilst  transplant free 
survival was 89%, 76%,  and 57% respectively [Moledina et al. Heart 2010; 96:  1401–06]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/476747/2021  
Page 8/107 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recent data from registries have shed light  on the prevalence and incidence of paediatric PH. In the 
Netherlands, the incidence and prevalence of IPAH is 0.7  and 4.4  per million children, respectively [van 
Loon et al. Circulation 2011;  124: 1755–64].  Similar numbers have been observed in the UK, with 
annual cases of IPAH of 0.48  per million and a prevalence of 2.1 per million [Barst et  al. Circulation. 
2012;  125: 113–122].  National  and large-scale registries either including  children [Barst et al. 
Circulation. 2012;  125: 113–122]  or exclusively dedicated to paediatrics have described the different 
aetiologies of PH, with  IPAH, HPAH and CHD-PAH as the most common [Moledina et  al. Heart 2010; 
96: 1401–06]  [Berger et al. Lancet 2012;  379:  537–46].  However, PH associated with  respiratory 
disease is also noted to  be important  and may be underreported [Berger et al. Lancet 2012;  379: 537–
46]. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
PH can present at  any age from the neonatal period to  adulthood. Paediatric PH has some unique 
features that  are not  found in adult PH, including  prenatal aetiological factors, and postnatal 
parenchymal and vascular abnormalities in lung development [Barst et al. Eur Respir J. 2011;  37: 
665–677]. 
Three signalling pathways (nitric  oxide, prostacyclin-thromboxane and endothelin-1)  involved in the 
pathogenesis of PAH have been targeted for therapeutic intervention by the following classes of PAH 
medicines [Humbert,  2004;  Frank, 2018]:  phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (sildenafil, 
tadalafil); soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators (riociguat);  ERAs (ambrisentan, bosentan, and 
macitentan); and prostanoids (epoprostenol, iloprost, beraprost, and treprostinil). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
PH is defined as an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAPm) ≥25  mmHg at rest as 
assessed by right  heart catheterization (RHC)  [Hoeper MM,  et al. J Am Coll Cardiol 2013; 
62(Suppl):D42–D50].  Available data have shown that the  normal PAPm at rest is 14 ±  3 mmHg with 
an upper limit  of normal of approximately 20 mmHg [Hoeper et al, 2013] [Kovacs et al. Eur Respir J 
2009;  34: 888–894]. 
There are 5  groups in the PH  classification [Galie et al, 2015]. The term PAH (Group 1  of the PH 
classification), describes a group of PH patients characterized haemodynamically by the presence of 
pre-capillary PH, defined by a pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ≥15  mmHg and a PVR >3 
Wood units (WU)  in the absence of other causes of pre-capillary PH such as PH due to lung diseases, 
chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) or other rare diseases [Hoeper et al, 2013]. 
Dyspnoea, fatigue and failure to thrive are common symptoms; syncope is more common in children, 
but  overt RV failure is a late event and the child may die of sudden death before the occurrence of RV 
failure. 
PAH disease aetiologies are described in  the following table [Galie et al 2015].  The more frequent 
aetiologies in children are idiopathic,  heritable, associated with connective tissue disease and 
associated with  congenital heart disease (underlined in  the following table). PPHN remains in the PAH 
group but has been moved to a subgroup (Subgroup 1’’ within  group 1), as it is considered to be a 
specific entity  with  a more transient course in most cases [Galie et  al, 2015].

Includes  all  large  intra-  and  extra-cardiac  defects  which  begin  as  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts  and 
progress with  time  to  severe elevation  of  PVR and  to  reversal (pulmonary-to-systemic) or  bidirectional 
shunting;  cyanosis, secondary erythrocytosis, and multiple  organ involvement are usually present. 
1.4.4.2.  PAH associated with  prevalent systemic-to-pulmonary shunts 
• Correctable 
•  Non-correctable: Includes moderate to  large defects;  PVR is  mildly to  moderately increased, systemic-
to-pulmonary shunting is still  prevalent, whereas cyanosis at rest is not a feature. 
1.4.4.3.  PAH with  small/coincidental defects 
Marked elevation in PVR in the presence of small cardiac defects (usually ventricular septal defects <1 cm 
and atrial septal defects <2 cm of effective diameter assessed by echo), which  themselves do not account 
for  the  development of  elevated PVR;  the  clinical  picture  is  very similar  to  idiopathic  PAH.  Closing  the 
defects is contra-indicated. 
1.4.4.4.  PAH after defect correction 
Congenital  heart  disease  is  repaired,  but  PAH  either  persists  immediately  after  correction  or 
recurs/develops months or years after correction in the absence of significant postoperative haemodynamic 
lesions.

Before the epoprostenol era, the prognosis had  been worse in children, with a median survival estimated at 10 
months, compared to 2.8 years in adults; however, with new targeted therapies the outcome has improved 
significantly [Galie et al. Eur Respir J. 2015; 46: 903–75]. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Detailed, consensus, evidence-based guidelines for the  treatment of PAH have been published [Galie et 
al. Eur Respir J. 2015;  46: 903–75].  Pharmacological approaches are divided into  those regarded as 
supportive or background treatment (aimed at alleviating vasoconstriction, breathlessness, and 
thromboembolic complications) and those (such as endothelium receptor antagonist [ERAs]) that 
target the underlying pathophysiology. 
Only bosentan (EMA  and FDA) and sildenafil (EMA)  have been approved for use in children [Farhat, 
2019].  Bosentan pharmacokinetics have been assessed in two  studies, and several uncontrolled 
studies have shown positive results similar to  adults, with  survival rates around 80–90%  at 1 year 
[Rosenzweig et al. J Am Coll Cardiol 2005;  46: 697–704].  A paediatric formulation is available in 
Europe. Bosentan is subject to clinically significant drug-drug interactions with  several important 
concomitant medications and is also associated with  potential hepatotoxicity. Sildenafil has shown 
efficacy and has been approved in Europe for children 1–17 years of age. Increased mortality using 
high doses has raised concerns; therefore high doses should not be used in children (high individual 
doses of sildenafil on a three daily dosing not  recommended: >10 mg/dose with  a bodyweight of 8–20 
kg, >20 mg/dose in children with  a bodyweight >20 kg or >1 mg/kg/dose in infants  and small 
children) [301].

Although not  approved for use in the paediatric population,  there is evidence that  prostanoid therapies 
are effective in children [Frank, 2018].  However, in common with  their use in  adults, the 
pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of these drugs and routes of administration  (e.g., intravenous [IV]), 
present substantial challenges to  their successful use in a paediatric population. Therefore, there is an 
unmet need for an approved treatment that  provides clear clinical benefit without  the complexities 
associated with  managing potential issues. 
Sequential combination therapy is the most widely utilised strategy both in RCTs and in clinical 
practice: from monotherapy with  a PDE5-i or ERA, there is an addition  of a second (ERA+PDE5i) and 
then a third drug (normally a prostanoid) in cases of inadequate clinical results or in cases of 
deterioration [Galie et al, 2015]. 
2.2.  About the product 
Ambrisentan is an orally active, propanoic acid-class, ERA selective for the endothelin A (ETA) 
receptor. Endothelin  plays a significant role in  the pathophysiology of PAH. 
•  Ambrisentan is a potent  (Ki 0.016 nM)  and highly selective ETA antagonist  (approximately 
4000-fold  more selective for ETA as compared to ETB). 
•  Ambrisentan blocks the ETA receptor subtype, localized predominantly on vascular smooth 
muscle cells and cardiac myocytes. This prevents endothelin-mediated activation of second 
messenger systems that  result in vasoconstriction and smooth muscle cell proliferation. 
The selectivity of ambrisentan for the ETA over the ETB receptor is expected to retain 
ETBreceptor mediated production of the vasodilators nitric  oxide and prostacyclin. 
• 
Ambrisentan belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group of anti-hypertensives, other anti-hypertensives 
(ATC code: C02KX02).  
Ambrisentan is currently approved for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in  adult 
patients of WHO Functional  Class (FC) II to III, including  use in combination treatment.  Efficacy has

2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application for ambrisentan (Volibris) EMEA/H/C/000839  is an extension of Marketing 
Authorisation to register 2.5 mg film coated tablets, grouped with Type II variation for a new paediatric 
(8 to <  18 years) indication and a Type IA deletion of product release site and quality control release 
testing  site. 
Ambrisentan is currently approved for the treatment  of PAH in adults.  It was first approved in the US 
on 15 June 2007.  Ambrisentan is currently approved in the US, all European Economic Area countries, 
and Japan as well as over 20 further countries. Ambrisentan is marketed in the EU  and other countries 
as VOLIBRIS by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and in the US as Letairis by Gilead Sciences Inc. 
Ambrisentan is available as 2.5 (Japan only), 5 and 10 mg film-coated tablets for once daily oral 
administration. 
GSK submitted  an initial Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) (EMEA/H/C/000839/0000)  under 
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC  as a full dossier in adults  for the treatment  of PAH. The application 
was approved in the EU on 21 April 2008.  This product was withdrawn  from the Community Register of

WHO Functional  Class (FC) II and III, including use in combination treatment to improve exercise 
capacity, decrease the symptoms of PAH and delay clinical worsening. Efficacy has been shown in 
idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and in PAH associated with  connective tissue disease. 
The proposed indication for ambrisentan for the paediatric population  is as follows: 
Volibris is indicated for treatment of PAH in adolescents and children (aged 8 to  less than 18  years) 
of WHO Functional  Class (FC)  II to III, including use in combination treatment. Efficacy has been 
shown in IPAH, familial, corrected congenital and in  PAH associated with connective tissue disease. 
For the submission of this variation application, the MAH  submitted 4 completed studies and 1 ongoing 
extension study (ID AMB114588).  Data from the completed studies were also submitted as part of an 
agreed paediatric investigation  plan (EMEA-000434-PIP01-08-M06;  EMA Decision P/0370/2019)  for 
ambrisentan (Volibris), which  contained a waiver in  paediatric subjects from birth  to less than  one year 
of age. At the  time of submission of the application, the PIP number EMEA-000434-PIP01-08-M06  was 
not yet completed as some measures were deferred.  
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Volibris 5  and 10  mg film coated tablets are already authorised medicinal products in  the EU 
(EU/1/08/451/001-004).  This is a line extension to register a new strength  (2.5 mg). 
The finished product is presented as film coated tablets containing  2.5 mg of ambrisentan as active 
substance. 
Other ingredients are:  
Tablet core: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium 
stearate 
Film  coat: polyvinyl alcohol, talc (E553b),  titanium  dioxide (E171),  macrogol, and lecithin  (soya) 
(E322) 
The product is available in white high-density polyethylene (HDPE)  bottles closed with  polypropylene 
child-resistant closures as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance used to  manufacture the new strength  2.5 mg is the same as that  used in  the 
manufacture of the currently authorised strengths 5 mg and 10 mg (EU/1/08/451/001-004).  The 
information presented by the applicant in the dossier was already assessed in the original submission 
and includes updates from any subsequent variations. The active substance is sourced from the same 
manufacturer, is manufactured by the  same process and is released in accordance with  the same 
active substance specification.

2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the  product and Pharmaceutical development 
The proposed 2.5 mg strength can be differentiated from the approved Volibris 5 and 10 mg strengths 
by colour, shape and printed  marks.  The 2.5  mg strength is presented as white, 7 mm round, convex, 
film-coated tablet with  “GS” debossed on one side and “K11”  on the other side. The finished product 
has been developed as an immediate-release tablet dosage form for oral administration.  
The 2.5 mg tablet has been developed for use in  paediatric populations. It contains the  active 
substance ambrisentan and the excipients are the same as those contained in the 5 and 10 mg tablet 
except for the kind of Opadry selected. 
The 2.5 mg strength uses the same formulation as that  contained in  the 5 and 10 mg tablet except 
Opadry® OY-S film coat is replaced by Opadry® II. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with  Ph. Eur standards. There are no additional requirements 
to assure consistent  product performance. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1  of the  SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this 
report. 
The finished product has been developed as an immediate-release tablet dosage form for oral 
administration. Tablets in 2.5  mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg strengths were manufactured by direct 
compression of dry blends. 
The excipients in the  dry blends, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, 
and microcrystalline cellulose were selected based on their common use in pharmaceutical 
manufacturing. The manufacturing process for the finished product consists of a dry blend direct 
compression process where a pre-blend of lactose and active substance are dry mixed and co-milled 
followed by an intermediate blend of remaining lactose. Croscarmellose sodium and microcrystalline 
cellulose are then added and blended followed by a final blend with magnesium stearate. The final 
blend is then compressed using a rotary tablet press to  the required specifications. Bulk tablets are 
then film coated to a specified weight  gain.    
The  primary  packaging  is  high  density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  bottles  closed  with  polypropylene child-
resistant closures. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture  of the  product and process controls 
The commercial manufacturing process uses direct compression of a dry blend followed by film coating 
of the core tablets 
The  manufacturing  process consists  of  4  main steps:  blending  of  the  active substance  and  excipients, 
compression of  the  core  tablets,  film  coating,  and  packaging. The  process is  considered to  be  a  non-
standard manufacturing  process since the  proportion of  the  active substance in  the formula is  below 2 
% (i.e. 1.70 %). 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process have been  validated  using  3  consecutive  commercial scale 
batches of  the 2.5  mg  tablets.  It  has been demonstrated that  the  manufacturing  process is  capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
In addition, a Technical Risk Assessment was conducted reviewing the identified finished product failure 
modes  against  the  current  operating  and  process  controls.  Trending  and  process  capability  data  of 
commercial batches of 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg strength tablets are provided from commercial batches

collected as part of lifecycle management to demonstrate that the current control strategy is appropriate 
and robust. 
The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: physical 
appearance  (visual),  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  identification  of  colorants  (UV-VIS  spectrum), 
ambrisentan content (assay by HPLC), related substances (HPLC), content uniformity (HPLC), dissolution 
(HPLC),  and microbial limit test  (Ph. Eur.). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the  finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with  the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
on 3 batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant 
elemental impurity  was not  detected above 30%  of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment 
and the presented batch data, it  can be concluded that  it is not necessary to include any elemental 
impurity controls.  
A  risk  evaluation  concerning  the  presence of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  finished  product  has  been 
performed  considering all suspected and actual root causes in  line with the  “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the  CHMP  Opinion for the Article 5(3)  of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004  referral on nitrosamine impurities  in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020)  and 
the  “Assessment  report-  Procedure  under  Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  EC  (No)  726/2004-  Nitrosamine 
impurities  in  human  medicinal products”  (EMA/369136/2020).  Based on  the  information  provided it  is 
accepted that no risk of presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished 
product was identified. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with  the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for testing  has 
been presented.  
Nevertheless,  it  was  indicated  that  one  reference marker is  no  longer  used  in  the  assay and  related 
substances  for  ambrisentan active  substance  method,  therefore  the  CHMP  recommended to  submit  a 
post  approval  variation  within  6  months  of  approval of  this  line  extension  application  to  update  the 
analytical procedure for ambrisentan assay and related substances across the 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg 
strengths  to  remove  reference  to  the  obsolete  marker.  Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  3 
commercial  scale  batches  of  the  2.5  mg  strength  confirming  the  consistency  of  the  manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 production scale batches of finished product stored for up  to 18 months under 
long term conditions (30 ºC / 75%  RH) and for up  to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75% RH)  according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the medicinal product are 
identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in  the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, ambrisentan content,  drug related impurities content,  dissolution 
and microbial limits.  The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  No significant changes 
were observed under long term and accelerated conditions and all results complied with  the 
specifications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/476747/2021

Data have also been presented from forced degradation and photostability  studies. Based on the 
results, the finished product does not  require additional protection from light and the chemical and 
physical stability  of the finished product has been demonstrated. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years without  any special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3)  is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that  the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that  the lactose has been prepared without  the 
use of ruminant  material other than calf rennet according to the  Note for Guidance on Minimising  the 
Risk of Transmitting  Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human  and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn  lead to the  conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP  opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product which pertains to the redundant reference marker. The applicant 
should submit a post-approval variation within  6 months of approval of this  line extension application 
to update the analytical procedure for ambrisentan assay and related substances across the strengths 
to remove reference to the  redundant reference marker. This point is put forward and agreed as a 
recommendation for future quality development. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this new strength (2.5  mg) is considered to be acceptable when used in  accordance with 
the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the  uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs  to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP  recommends the following points for investigation: 
2.5.  - to submit a post approval variation within 6 months of approval of this line 
extension application to update the analytical procedure for ambrisentan assay and 
Assessment report

related substances across the 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg strengths to remove 
reference to a redundant reference marker. Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Pharmacology 
No additional pharmacology studies have been performed specifically to support the paediatric indication. 
This is considered acceptable since a complete battery of pharmacology studies was provided for initial 
MAA. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No  new  nonclinical  pharmacokinetics  studies  have  been  submitted  in  this  application.  The  known 
pharmacokinetic profile  of  ambrisentan  in  humans  and  nonclinical  species  (metabolism  and  excretion 
principally  by  liver/bile)  does  not  raise  grounds  to  presuppose  greater  systemic  exposure  in 
children/adolescents (8 to less than18  years), compared to adults. Furthermore, data from clinical study 
AMB112529  demonstrated that systemic exposure to ambrisentan in patients 8  to less than 18  years is 
expected to be consistent with  that  seen in adults, when  adjusted for body weight. 
Currently  available  safety  margins  were  agreed  on  via  type  II  variation  procedure  in  2018 
(EMEA/H/C/000839/II/0054)  and  reflected  in  section  5.3  of  SmPC.  These  were  calculated  based  on 
published data with  paediatric exposures (9 to 15 years old children treated with 10 mg of ambrisentan, 
once daily) as described by Takatsuki [Takatsuki, 2013].   
2.5.3.  Toxicology 
All relevant nonclinical reports for ambrisentan (including nonclinical data generated to support paediatric 
development including  PIP  studies  3  and 4)  have  been reviewed as part  of  previous submissions.   No 
further  nonclinical  data  has  been generated  specifically  to  support  the  paediatric  indication  (8  to  <18 
years).   
For  PIP  (EMEA-000434-PIP01-08-M06)  two  juvenile  animal  studies  were  conducted:  2-week  juvenile 
animal  study  to  determine  tolerability  and  toxicokinetics  of  ambrisentan  and  8-week  juvenile  animal 
study to determine oral toxicology and toxicokinetic of ambrisentan including an 8 weeks recovery period. 
Additionally, investigative juvenile rat studies were conducted, one to further histologically evaluate brain 
tissues  from  the  definitive  juvenile  study  and  another  two  separate  investigative  studies  to  assess 
respiratory function and recovery in juvenile rats. 
The key target  organs of toxicity were identified  as testis  and nasal cavity, with  the rat being  the more 
sensitive species in  terms  of both  oral dose and  systemic exposure. In the  rat  toxicity  studies  (1  to  6 
months  in  duration),  the  rats  were 5-6  weeks of  age at  start  of  dosing.  In  a toxicity  study  in  juvenile 
rats  (dosed from  7  days old),  ambrisentan was  associated with  a decrement in  brain  weight  gain and 
noisy respiration. However, when  5-week old rats (corresponding to an age of 8 years in humans) were 
treated, brain-weight decrease was observed only at very high doses.  
A discussion of these target organs of toxicity and their  relevance to the intended paediatric population 
has been provided. The presence of sustained hypoxemia in juvenile rats is considered by the MAH  as a 
likely mechanism  for the  decrease in  brain  weight  gain.  However, the  mechanism  for the  decrease in 
brain weight   has  already been reviewed in  (Type II variation  EMEA/H/C/000839/II/0054)  and  altered 
postnatal  development of the  rat soft palate, pharynx or larynx as a cause of hypoxia was inconclusive  
in  the  mechanistic  study.  It  is  still  unclear  whether  the  decrease  in  brain  weight  observed  after 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/476747/2021  
Page 16/107 
 
 
 
administration  of  ambrisentan in  the  juvenile  rat  toxicity  studies  is  caused by  hypoxemia due  to  ETA 
receptor antagonist-induced altered postnatal development of the upper respiratory tract. 
No new data were provided by the applicant to further elaborate on the mechanism behind the decrease 
in brain weight observed in juvenile animals. Consequently, clinical relevance of brain weight decreases 
remains unclear, especially for children younger than 8 years old. 
Section 5.3 of SmPC has been updated to include the age range in children that is covered by the juvenile 
rat study, which supports that  the finding  would likely not be meaningful for children age 8 and above.  
2.5.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83,  the applicant has submitted  an environmental risk 
assessment for for Volibris™ Film Coated Tablets 2.5, 5 and10 mg (referred to as ambrisentan tablets 5 
and 10 mg), containing  2.5, 5 or 10 mg ambrisentan.  
This assessment has been conducted in accordance to guideline on the  Environmental Risk Assessment 
of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00).   
Following the low PEC values estimated for Volibris™ film-coated tablets 5 and 10 mg on the basis of the 
refined Fpen values, it can be concluded that the market authorization of the medicinal product is unlikely 
to adversely impact the environment. The results of the environmental risk assessment are summarized 
in the table below.

2.5.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No further nonclinical data has been generated specifically to support the paediatric indication (8 to <18 
years) in this variation.  However, the applicant was requested to discuss the need to update the safety 
margins safety margins  in  section 5.3  of  the  SmPC in  line  with  newly  provided paediatric  studies.  The 
applicant  provided calculation for animal-to-human exposure ratios in comparison to the paediatric data 
obtained  in  study  AMB112529;  geometric  mean  AUC  =  9.15  μg.h/mL  in  children  ages  8  and  above 
administered up to 10 mg) and in comparison, to the values calculated from literature (Takatsuki, 2013; 
12.0  mcg.h/mL). 
CHMP  agreed to  maintain the  animal-to-human exposure ratios in the  SmPC in  line with  literature data 
as these  values provide lower  safety margins, thus  leaving extra safety margins  in  comparison to  the 
conducted  study.  The  worst-case  scenario  approach  with  a  more  conservative  safety  margins  is 
acceptable. Furthermore, available non-clinical  data do  not  allow an  understanding  of the  risk of  brain 
weight  decrement to the  paediatric population,  especially for children  younger than 8  years old, this  is 
taken into account in the SmPC.  
An updated Environmental Risk Assessment has been provided. Following the  low PEC values estimated 
for Volibris film-coated tablets 5 and 10 mg on the basis of the refined Fpen values, it can be concluded 
that  the market authorization of the medicinal product is unlikely to  adversely impact the environment. 
2.5.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There  are no  new  safety concerns  for  paediatric  indication  (8  to  <18  years) based  on  available non-
clinical data. Section 5.3  of SmPC has been updated to include the age range in  children that  is covered 
by the  juvenile rat study,  which  supports  the finding  would  likely not  be meaningful  for children age 8 
and above.  
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the  effect that  clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out  in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
This  application  is  based  on  the  phase  IIb  clinical  trial  AMB112529  and  its  open-label  extension 
AMB112588.  The summary of both  studies is shown in table below.

2.6.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
Sample analysis and assay validation for ambrisentan (GSK1325760) supporting  study AMB112529 
was submitted. Updated  experimental with additional stability  data was also submitted.  The results 
indicate that  GSK1325760 is stable in human plasma stored at -20 ºC for 1106 days. 
The performance of the bioanalytical method was demonstrated in the validation. 
The in-study accuracy and precision results of calibration standards and the QCs were acceptable. The 
reasons for the  re-analysis of samples are considered acceptable.  
The samples were analyzed within  the appropriate stability period (i.e., at  least 1106  days at -20  ºC. 
The incurred sample re-analysis was performed. It was observed that more than  67% of the 
ambrisentan repeat results and original results were within  20%  of the mean of the two  values. 
A POP-PK analysis of PK data from Study AMB112529  was used to characterize the PK of ambrisentan 
in paediatrics aged 8 to less than 18 years with  PAH given Low  and High  doses of ambrisentan 
adjusted for body weight. The ambrisentan PK from this paediatric population was compared to the 
known PK of ambrisentan in an adult population of healthy subjects and subjects with  PAH.  The effects 
of covariates on PK parameters was also assessed. 
Table 7 Ambrisentan Weight-Group Based  Doses for AMB112529 
Bioequivalence 
As a consequence of the extension of the PAH indication  to include children aged 8 to less than 18 
years the registration of an additional  strength (2.5 mg) of the ambrisentan immediate-release film 
coated tablet is also submitted. 
The manufacturing process is direct compression. Commercially available ambrisentan 5 and 10 mg 
tablets were used in the  paediatric Study AMB112529  and its ongoing long-term extension Study 
AMB114588.  The ambrisentan 2.5 mg tablets  had the  same qualitative composition and tablet weight 
as the 5 and 10 mg tablets. 
Phase appropriate in vitro dissolution  methodology was developed and used to test ambrisentan tablets 
throughout  the clinical program. The introduction of the final quality-controlled method was selected

based on its  discriminatory capacity in response to bioequivalence study AMB-103  in adults. The 2.5, 5 
and 10 mg ambrisentan tablets exhibit similar dissolution  profiles. 
Study AMB-103 
This Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-period (for 2.5  mg and 5  mg tablets)  or 3-period (for 10 mg 
tablets) crossover, single-center study evaluated the  bioequivalence of ambrisentan tablets 
manufactured by Abbott  and used in clinical studies with  ambrisentan tablets  manufactured by Patheon 
that  are representative of the  proposed commercial dosage forms. 
The primary objectives of this  study were: 
• To compare the clinical trial and commercial formulations of ambrisentan 2.5 mg tablets for 
bioequivalence. 
• To compare the clinical trial and commercial formulations of ambrisentan 5 mg tablets for 
bioequivalence. 
• To compare the clinical trial and commercial formulations of ambrisentan 10 mg tablets for 
bioequivalence. 
Pharmacokinetics Results: 
The PK parameters of ambrisentan were comparable between Treatments A1 (commercial 2.5 mg 
formulation) and R1 (clinical 2.5 mg formulation). The geometric mean ratios of Cmax, AUC0-last  and 
AUC0–∞ were 94.1%, 104.5%,  and 105.9%,  respectively, and the  90% CI were all within  the range of 
80-125%,  indicating  Treatments A1 and R1 were bioequivalent.

Final Population PK model in paediatric subjects 
The PK of ambrisentan concentration-time data from Study AMB112529  was well-described by a two-
compartment model with  first-order absorption, first-order elimination and a lag time. The only 
covariate found to be statistically significant was body weight and was fixed to allometric coefficients. 
Key parameters for this  POP-PK final model are shown in Table 10.  For comparative purposes, 
estimates from the previously developed adult model are also presented in in the table. Comparison 
shows that  the ambrisentan parameter estimates for CL/F,  Vc/F, Ka and ALAG using the data from 
Study AMB112529  are comparable to those reported in the adult  population PK report for adult

ambrisentan final model confirming similar PK behaviour for ambrisentan between children and adults 
when differences in body size was accounted for.

population   
The goodness-of-fit (GoF)  plots for the final model for all data from Study AMB112529 indicated that 
the final model adequately described the observed data with no obvious systematic bias in the model 
predictions. 
Results of the pc-VPC of the final POP-PK model indicated an overall good agreement for the 5th, 
median, and 95th percentiles of ambrisentan concentrations between observation and predictions 
(Figure 4).

The ambrisentan individual AUCs plotted against change from baseline in 6MWD at both  Weeks 12 and 
24 stratified by patient (adults  versus paediatric population)  and dose group presented in Figure 9 
suggest no clear correlation between ambrisentan systemic exposure and the  change from baseline in 
6MWD in  8 up to 18-year-old subjects. Therefore, any formal exposure response (ER) assessment with 
the extent of PK-PD information available from this  study is limited. Based on that,  no further PK-PD 
modelling was considered. 
These observations are consistent  with those in  adults in whom there were also no strong relationships 
between ambrisentan exposure and efficacy measures. The lack of a strong exposure-response 
relationship in both adults  and paediatric subjects is expected given the relatively narrow range of 
evaluated active doses and large between-subject variability in response. A wider dose range including 
placebo data would allow to better discriminate between doses, however this  type of study would not 
be practical given the context of a rare disease and the safety profile. Nevertheless, given that  similar 
exposure, efficacy, and safety profiles have been demonstrated between the paediatric and adult 
populations, extrapolation of data is considered valid.

The ambrisentan individual exposures (AUCss and Cmax,ss) plotted  against incidence of any AE related 
to ambrisentan are presented in Figure  10. These plots suggest a lack of correlation between the 
ambrisentan exposure and the incidence of drug-related AEs. 
The observations in the paediatric subjects are in concordance with  those in the adult  population where 
the reported incidence of AEs did not  appear to be related to estimates of increased ambrisentan 
exposure. In adults, the analysis of the relationship between the predicted measures of ambrisentan 
exposure and the  frequency and severity of AEs was consistent  with the  efficacy analysis that did not 
show a strong relationship.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioequivalence 
The registration of additional strength  of 2.5 mg is based on qualitative similarity with  commercially 
available 5 mg and 10 mg strengths and bioequivalence study AMB-103 which demonstrated 
bioequivalence between the to be marketed strength and 2.5 mg strength  used during clinical 
development. The new strength has the same qualitative  composition and same manufacturing process 
as commercially available 5 mg and 10 mg strengths and similar dissolution profile.  
The data to support additional strength of 2.5  mg are considered adequate.

EMA/CHMP/476747/2021  
Page 34/107 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of ambrisentan in 39 paediatric patients from 8 to less than  18 years of age 
have been characterized based on 211 observations from Study AMB112529.  Paediatric patients 
received two dose levels (5  or 10 mg) and both  sub-groups of patients shared similar demographic 
characteristics. The number of data below the quantification  limit  is negligible (<3%). 
A previously developed population PK model in  the adult population was used to predict the exposure 
in paediatric patients from 8  to less than  18 years of age. The results suggested a model-
misspecification at  early (4-8 hours) and later (16-20  hours) time points.  Therefore, the population  PK 
model was refined to adequately characterize the ambrisentan exposure. The final population PK model 
in paediatric patients incorporated equal structural PK model as the adult population (two-
compartment model with  linear absorption and disposition),  but allometric exponents to account for 
the different effects of weight  on the disposition parameters clearly differed to the adult population  PK 
model. Standard allometric exponents were considered in  the paediatric population,  which is endorsed. 
The model evaluation demonstrated the ability  of the  population PK model to characterize the observed 
behaviour.  
Higher Vc/F and Vp/F were estimated for paediatrics compared to adults.  No statistical  differences 
were observed on ka and Vc/F and statistical  but not clinically relevant differences were predicted on 
Vp/F. The previously developed population PK model in adults demonstrated an adequate agreement 
to describe the observed behaviour in paediatric patients, adequacy of the current population PK model 
in paediatrics. Therefore, model-predicted exposure metrics should be considered with  caution, since 
several concerns have been raised regarding differences in the population PK model between paediatric 
patients from 8 to less than 18 years of age and adults. 
A simulation-based analysis was performed using the population  PK model developed in the  paediatric 
population (8-18  years of age) to evaluate different dose levels in  paediatric patients. Model  predicted 
exposures in each sub-group of paediatric patients were compared across body weight  ranges and 
ultimately, compared to the  predicted exposure in adults. The previously developed adult population 
PK without  allometric scaling effects has demonstrated a good ability to reproduce the paediatric data. 
This confirms that  differences in PK model structures and parameter estimates were conducted to 
better reproduce the experimental evidence in paediatric patients. 
Exposure-response analyses 
No exposure-response (efficacy or safety) relationships were found in paediatric patients  receiving 5 to 
10 mg of ambrisentan. Similar results were observed when adult patients were considered in previous 
analysis. The lack of any exposure-efficacy or exposure-safety relationship could be influenced by the 
limited dose levels evaluated in clinical trials.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Bioequivalence between the to  be marketed strength  and 2.5 mg strength used during clinical 
development was demonstrated in  study AMB-103. The new strength also has similar qualitative 
characteristics with  commercially available strengths.  
The clinical pharmacology characteristics have been adequately addressed and no other concerns 
remain.  
The evaluation of the exposure-efficacy or exposure-safety relationship in paediatric patients receiving 
5 or 10 mg of ambrisentan demonstrated the lack of any significant  relationship between the  exposure 
metrics (AUC and Cmax) and response endpoints. Therefore, no exposure-response relationship could

be established so far in  paediatric patients (8-18  years) due to the limited number of dose levels 
evaluated and the reduced number of patients recruited. The Applicant is encouraged to assess, when 
possible, any plausible exposure-response relationship in this  and other sub-groups of paediatric 
patients during its  clinical development.

2.6.5.2.  Main  study(ies) 
STUDY AMB112529 
Study AMB112529,  a randomized, open label study comparing safety and efficacy parameters for a 
high and a low dose of ambrisentan (adjusted for body weight)  for the treatment of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension in  paediatric patients aged 8 years up to 18 years  
This was a 6-month  (24-week), randomised, open-label evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of 2 doses of ambrisentan (Low and High,  adjusted for body weight) in  paediatric subjects 
aged 8  years up to  18 years with PAH. The study included a Screening/Baseline Period (up to  a 
maximum of 2 weeks), a Treatment Period, and a Follow-up  assessment within  4 to 6 weeks of last 
investigational drug. The Treatment Period was 24  weeks or until  the subject’s clinical condition 
deteriorated to the  point that  alternative/additional treatment was necessary. Subjects who completed 
the study were eligible to  enrol into a long-term follow-up study (AMB114588)  and those subjects were 
not required to attend the Follow-up  assessment in this  study. 
Methods 
•  Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria: 
Male or female subjects aged 8 up to 18 years of age at the  time of randomisation were eligible. Key 
inclusion criteria required a current diagnosis of PAH (WHO  Group 1)  with WHO  Class II or III 
symptoms in  one of the following categories: idiopathic;  heritable; secondary to connective tissue 
disease; or persistent PAH despite surgical repair. Subjects with  right  heart catheterisation also had to 
meet the following: mean pulmonary arterial pressure of ≥25 mmHg;  pulmonary vascular resistance of 
≥240  dyne sec/cm5; and left  ventricular end diastolic pressure or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 
of ≤15 mmHg.  All subjects must have either been: treatment naïve; discontinued treatment with 
another endothelium receptor antagonist (ERA) at least 1 month  previously because of elevated liver 
function tests  (LFTs);  or on a stable dose of drug therapy for PAH for at least 1 month prior to the 
Screening Visit. The baseline drug therapy for PAH, if any, was not  permitted to change from the time 
of the Screening Visit until  the end of all Treatment Period assessments, and subjects who 
discontinued ERA treatment due to elevated LFTs,  must have had LFTs of <3 x Upper Limit  of Normal 
(ULN).   
Exclusion criteria:  
Key reasons subjects were not eligible for the study included if they were taking an ERA, cyclosporine 
A, had body weight  <20 kg, or had not tolerated PAH therapy due to  adverse effects that may have 
been related to their mechanism of action (except liver abnormalities for those subjects who were 
receiving another ERA). A diagnosis of active hepatitis (hepatitis  B surface antigen and hepatitis C

antibody), or clinically significant  hepatic enzyme elevation at Screening was also excluded, as well as 
subjects with severe renal impairment, clinically significant fluid retention  or anaemia. 
•  Treatments 
Subjects were dosed orally (tablet  swallowed whole) once daily for 24 weeks after randomisation to 
either a High dose or a Low dose group. For subjects randomised to the High  dose group, in each body 
weight  subgroup there was an initial lower dose that  was increased at Week 2 to the final higher dose, 
if deemed appropriate by the investigator.

•  Objectives 
The primary purpose of this paediatric study was to  provide clinically relevant information on the  safety 
and PK profile of ambrisentan in children with  the most common causes of PAH in this  age group. The 
design of the  study was also intended to provide information to  guide dose selection and supportive 
efficacy data. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy was a secondary objective in study AMB112529 (main objective was related to safety) 
Summary of Efficacy endpoints in study AMB112529 
•  Primary:  
•  Change from Baseline in the 6-minute  walking distance (6MWD) test  evaluated after 24  weeks of 
therapy. 
•  Secondary:  
•  Mean changes from Baseline in the 6MWD  test at Weeks 4, 8,  12, 16, and 20. 
•  Time to clinical worsening of PAH. 
•  Change from Baseline in Subject Global Assessment to Week 24 using the Short Form 10 (SF-10) 
health survey for children. 
•  Change from Baseline in World Health Organisation (WHO)  functional class to  Week 24. 
•  Change from Baseline in N-terminal  pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) concentration at 
Week 24. 
•  Exploratory objectives: 
•  Change from Baseline in major prognostic factors based on echocardiograms: pericardial effusion, 
right atrial (RA) pressure, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), eccentricity index 
(systolic and diastolic), and right ventricular (RV) pressure by tricuspid  regurgitant jet (TRJ) 
velocity to Week 24. 
•  Change from Baseline in cardiopulmonary haemodynamics at Week 24 (a sub-study in subjects 
enrolled at centres where the  collection of haemodynamic data was considered part of the 
standard of care). 
An Independent Data Monitoring  Committee (IDMC) was utilised  to conduct external objective medical 
and/or statistical review of safety, exposure (ambrisentan plasma concentration), and/or efficacy 
issues.

Study AMB114588  utilized the same endpoints  as Study AMB112529  but also included time to all-
cause mortality, time to  addition of another targeted therapeutic agent for PAH and time  to a change in 
ambrisentan dose for the  treatment of PAH. 
An overview of the efficacy endpoints utilized  in both studies is provided in Table below. 
Table 13 Efficacy Endpoints Utilized in Studies AMB112529  and AMB114588 
6-Minute  Walk Distance: The 6MWD test  was primarily used to  demonstrate the efficacy of 
ambrisentan in the paediatric population  in both Study AMB112529  and its long-term safety and 
efficacy Study AMB114588. In addition,  a separate Bayesian analysis of data from the 6MWD  from 
Study AMB112529  was performed. A population PK modelling and simulation  analysis was performed 
to explore the potential  relationship between ambrisentan PK and change from baseline in  6MWD at 12 
and 24 weeks in the  paediatric population in Study AMB112529  and if required, develop an exposure-
response (ER) model relating ambrisentan PK to  change from baseline in 6MWD. 
The 6MWD endpoint has been shown in the adult PAH population to  correlate with long-term clinical 
outcome [Enright,  2003], and there is evidence that it  can be used in children as young as 6  years 
[Geiger, 2007]  and is generally used to follow exercise tolerance in paediatric PAH patients  of 
appropriate age. In IPAH, exercise capacity correlates with RA pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, 
and cardiac index.

Interventional clinical trials in  adults with  PAH have commonly used the 6MWD test  to demonstrate 
efficacy for drug approval [Ollivier, 2019]. 
At a pre submission meeting the Rapporteur requested an additional assessment of subject response 
to therapy using a minimal clinically important  difference (MCID) criteria for the 6MWD  to further 
demonstrate the clinical relevance of the treatment effect in paediatric subjects. 
For the 6MWD,  the proportion of subjects with  a change from baseline in 6MWD of ≥ 20  metres was 
calculated by randomized group and overall at Weeks 12 and 24 in Study AMB112529  and at 12 
months and last observation in Study AMB114588.  A subgroup analysis by PAH aetiology (idiopathic 
versus non-idiopathic PAH) was also performed. 
Time to Clinical Worsening: Time to clinical worsening of PAH was defined as the  time from 
randomisation to the first occurrence of: 
•  Death (all cause) or placement on active list  for lung  transplant; 
•  Hospitalisation  due to  PAH deterioration; 
•  Addition or increased dose of other targeted PAH therapeutic agents (prostanoids, PDE-5 
• 
• 
inhibitors) and/or atrial septostomy; 
PAH related deterioration identified by: increase in WHO functional class; deterioration in 
exercise testing (i.e., 20% decrease in 6MWD on 2 consecutive tests, 1 week apart); 
clinical signs or symptoms of right sided heart failure (i.e., new peripheral oedema, increase in 
liver size, ascites, increase in jugular venous pressure, pericardial effusion, increased 
dyspnoea). 
Change in WHO Functional  Class: The WHO classification of functional capacity, an adaptation  of the 
New York Heart  Association (NYHA)  classification, is routinely used to qualitatively assess activity 
tolerance. The WHO FC  assesses the severity of an individual’s symptoms and how they impact on 
day-to-day activities, with  a higher classification indicating  greater severity/impact. This classification 
system, presented in Table below, is useful to monitor disease progression and response to treatment 
[McGoon, 2004].

Hypertension 
N-terminal Pro-B-type Natriuretic Peptide: Blood samples for determination of N-Terminal pro-B-type 
Natriuretic Peptide plasma concentrations were collected in both  Study AMB112529 and Study 
AMB114588. 
An adhoc analysis was performed of the proportion of subjects who achieved an NT-proBNP level of 
less than  1200 ng/L  by randomized group and overall at Week 12  and Week 24 in Study AMB112529

and at 12 months  and last observation in  Study AMB114588.  A subgroup analysis by PAH aetiology 
(idiopathic versus non-idiopathic  PAH) was also performed. 
Prognostic Factors Based on Echocardiograms: Prognostic factors evaluated in both  Study AMB112529 
and Study AMB114588 included pericardial effusion, RA pressure, tricuspid  annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE), eccentricity index (systolic and diastolic), and RV pressure by tricuspid regurgitant 
jet (TRJ) velocity. 
Cardiopulmonary Haemodynamics 
Cardiopulmonary haemodynamics were not scheduled assessments as part of Study AMB112529  or 
Study AMB114588  but were collected in those subjects in whom collecting haemodynamic data was 
considered part of the standard of care. 
Haemodynamic assessments included: 
heart rate 
• 
•  mean blood pressure (systolic, diastolic) 
•  mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PA; systolic, diastolic) 
•  mean RA pressure 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) or 
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) 
cardiac output 
cardiac index (calculated value) 
arterial and mixed venous oxygen saturation (method used to calculate cardiac output 
measurement was recorded, if Fick’s principle was used it was to be stated if oxygen 
consumption was measured or assumed). 
Health  Outcomes 
The SF-10 Health  Survey for children is a 10-item,  4-week recall, parent-completed health assessment 
that  measures physical and psychosocial functioning for children aged 5 years and over. In addition  to 
the SF-10,  specific questions were asked regarding number of scheduled school days missed and how 
many were missed due to symptoms of PAH. These health outcome measures were collected in both 
Study AMB112529  and Study AMB114588. 
Time to Addition of Another Targeted PAH Therapeutics Agent 
The time to addition of another targeted therapeutic agent for PAH was collected as required in long-
term safety Study AMB114588  only. Time to addition  of other targeted PAH therapeutic agents was 
defined as the time from randomisation to the first occurrence of: 
•  Deterioration of clinical condition; 
• 
Lack of beneficial effect with  previous therapy (not  reaching set treatment goals). 
Time to a Change in Ambrisentan Dose 
The time to a change in ambrisentan dose for the treatment of PAH was collected as required in long-
term safety Study AMB114588  only. Time to change in dose of ambrisentan or other targeted PAH 
therapeutic agents (prostanoids, PDE-5 inhibitors) 
was defined as the time from randomisation to  the first occurrence of a dose change due to 
deterioration of clinical condition. 
•  Sample size 
Sixty-six subjects (33 per dose group) were planned and 41 subjects were recruited prior to a 
nonclinical toxicology finding  in juvenile rats that  led to regulatory notification, discussions with 
investigators/competent authorities, and the study being placed on clinical hold for new enrolment. 
Following  further nonclinical investigations and discussions with  the EMA Paediatric Committee (PDCO), 
it was determined in February 2019  not to enrol further subjects and the study was terminated and 
reported with  41 subjects. 
•  Randomisation  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/476747/2021  
Page 40/107 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All subjects who  met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomised to one of 2 dose groups 
(Low dose or High  dose, based on body weight)  of ambrisentan according to a computer-generated 
randomisation schedule. To ensure balance with  respect to  the number of subjects assigned to each 
dose group, the allocation schedule was generated in blocks. Each subject was assigned to a pack 
number according to the predefined randomisation list.  A central Interactive Voice Response System 
was used for treatment assignment. 
Once a randomisation number had been assigned, the subject was considered as definitely included 
and the number was not  re-assigned. Randomisation was stratified by the age groups 8 years up to 11 
years and 12 years up to 18 years, and by aetiology of PAH as follows: 
• 
Idiopathic. 
•  Heritable [familial]. 
•  Secondary to connective tissue disease. 
• 
Persistent despite surgical repair of atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, atrio-
ventricular septal defects, and persistent patent ductus. 
Subjects were assigned to study treatment  in accordance with the randomisation schedule. 
•  Blinding (masking) 
Both the AMB112529  and AMB114588  studies were open-label. However, in Study AMB112529, 
subjects were randomized to either a Low Dose group or a High  Dose group (see "Treatments" section 
above). The 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg ambrisentan tablets differed in size and colour. Over-
encapsulating the tablets to  disguise the dose strengths was impractical and may have been difficult 
for the younger subjects to swallow. Using all 2.5 mg tablets  (with matching  placebo) to disguise the 
dose would  have required every subject to take 4 tablets at each dose and could have resulted in an 
unacceptable risk of subjects receiving the wrong dose (i.e., the wrong mix of active and placebo 
tablets). Therefore, the study was conducted with  an open-label design because the risks and 
inconveniences to the subjects associated with  blinding the dose outweighed any benefit of conducting 
the study in a blinded fashion. 
However, to  minimise bias, blinding  measures were taken at the  investigative site; a person not 
involved in subject assessments was designated to  dispense the investigational product and to perform 
the subsequent compliance checks (pill  counts). Subjects and their parents (or legal guardian) were 
asked not to comment on the number of tablets taken with the  individual performing the assessments. 
Therefore, the individual making the  subject assessments would be unbiased. 
After each subject had completed the study, the  randomised treatment was unblinded to the 
investigators to allow for informed dose adjustments and follow-up treatment as necessary. 
•  Statistical methods 
All subjects from the ITT population were included in the  analysis of efficacy data. The ITT population 
consisted of all randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Given the small 
sample size, all efficacy data were summarised descriptively and graphically. Data were summarised 
by dose group (Low and High)  and overall. For key efficacy endpoints, data were also summarised by 
age strata (8  to 11 years and 12 to <18  years). 
Time to clinical worsening was presented graphically by Kaplan-Meier curves. The 10  items of the  SF-
10 Health  Survey were aggregated into 2 summary scores (Physical Health and Psychosocial) each 
containing 5 mutually  exclusive elements from the  10-item survey. A higher value on each summary 
score indicated better functioning.  The aggregate score was then  standardised and transformed to a 
norm-based scoring metric in  accordance with the developer’s guidelines. 
A summary analysis of the differences between Low  and High  dose groups was planned to  be 
performed for efficacy endpoints. However, due to  low subject numbers, this  was removed from the 
final analysis plan. Data presentation of school days missed due to PAH was added to the final

Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP). In addition, presentation of ambrisentan plasma concentration-time 
data was not specified and was 
provided as additional output  after finalisation of the RAP. 
Efficacy endpoints in the  extension study were analysed in a similar manner to  the initial study. The 
ITT population for the  extension study considered subjects as belonging to their treatment  group at the 
start of study AMB114588  and not as belonging to  their treatment group at the time of the visit/event 
in the protocol as updated in the RAP prior to the data cut off and reporting of data for this interim 
report. 
Baseline values in the extension study were those collected prior to the  first dose (from Study 
AMB112529).  Therefore, if a subject had no pre-dose data for a parameter on Day 1 (defined as the 
day of first dose in Study AMB112529),  then the data from their  last pre-treatment assessment from 
Study AMB112529  was used. 
Subgroup Analysis: Selected demographic, safety and efficacy outputs  were produced by age strata (8 
to 11 years, and 12 up to  18 years) in Study AMB112529. 
Interim Analyses: Study AMB112529  was placed on enrolment hold in 2013  following juvenile rat 
toxicology data findings of decreased brain weights,  believed to be due to hypoxia related to apnoeic 
episodes. At this  time, 41 paediatric subjects had been recruited into the  study and in the interim 
between enrolment hold and the  submission of additional nonclinical data to the CHMP,  the enrolled 
subjects had either completed the study (37 subjects) or had withdrawn (4  subjects). An interim 
efficacy analysis was conducted in 2018 but  since the  study was subsequently terminated, this  interim 
analysis became the final analysis for Study AMB112529. 
There were no planned interim analyses for the extension study. However, an interim analysis was 
added post  finalisation of the  study protocol, in  order to provide analyses in support of regulatory 
interactions. All data collected by a pre-determined clinical cut-off date of 23 August 2019  were 
analysed in accordance with the  planned final analyses specified in the  RAP utilised for this interim 
analysis report. 
Adhoc Analyses of 6MWD  and NT-proBNP from Study AMB112529  and Study AMB114588:  At the 
VOLIBRIS Paediatric Pre-submission meeting in December 2019 the Spanish Rapporteur requested an 
assessment of subject response to therapy using a MCID criteria of ≥20 metres for the 6MWD  and for 
NT-proBNP (criteria not specified) (m1.0  Rapporteur meeting minutes, 2020). 
For the 6MWD,  the proportion of subjects with  a change from baseline in 6MWD of ≥20  metres was 
calculated by randomized group and overall at Weeks 12 and 24 in Study AMB112529  and at 12 
months and last observation in Study AMB114588.  A subgroup analysis by PAH aetiology (idiopathic 
versus non-idiopathic PAH) was also performed. 
The literature cites a target level of NT-proBNP of less than  1200 ng/L  as desirable since patients 
achieving this  level have better outcomes when compared to those who have higher levels [Ploegstra, 
2015].  Consequently, an adhoc analysis was performed of the proportion of subjects who achieved an 
NT-proBNP level of less than  1200 ng/L  by randomized group and overall at Week 12 and Week 24  in 
Study AMB112529  and at  12 months and last observation in Study AMB114588.  A subgroup analysis 
by PAH aetiology (idiopathic versus non-idiopathic  PAH) was also performed. In addition,  the 
proportion of subjects with  NT-proBNP levels above 1200 ng/L  at baseline or any time during  the 
study, proportion with  levels between 500 to <1200  ng/L, and those with  levels <500  ng/L were also 
calculated. For those subjects with  baseline NT-proBNP values greater than 1200  ng/L, the proportion 
who remained high or had at least 1 value or the last value<1200 ng/L  was calculated. Of those 
subjects with values between 500  to 1200  ng/L, how many remained between these levels or 
transitioned to higher (greater than  1200 ng/L)  or lower values (<500  ng/L)  was also calculated.

Similarly, of those subjects with baseline values <500 ng/L,  the proportion who remained at this  level 
or transitioned to higher values (between 500 to 1200  ng/L  or greater than  1200 ng/L)  was also 
calculated. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
A total of 41 patients were randomized to the ambrisentan low dose group (n=21)  or high  dose group 
(n=20)   
The majority of subjects in  both dose groups completed the  study (Table 15).  The primary reasons for 
withdrawal were similar across the 2  dose groups. Both subjects withdrawn  from the study due to an 
AE died as a result of the reported event. 
In total, 38  subjects (93%)  entered the  long-term extension study AMB114588;  19 subjects from the 
Low dose group and 19 subjects from the High dose group. 
Table 15 Summary of Subject  Disposition (ITT Population) 
Recruitment 
Subjects were randomised from 9  countries; 8  subjects from the Russian Federation, 7  from the United 
States, 6 from Argentina, 5 each from Hungary and Japan, 3 each from France and Germany, and 2 
each from Italy and Spain. 
In March 2013, a Dear Investigator Letter  was sent  by GSK to  inform all investigators and responsible 
national competent authorities of a nonclinical finding of brain weight decrease in juvenile rats with low 
clinical margins for human paediatric dose exposures. 
At that  time, 41 subjects had been recruited to the study. Further  to notification of the juvenile rat 
toxicology findings,  questions were received from the EMA and the competent authorities in  Germany, 
France, and Italy. Following  consultation with  the national  agencies governing the trial in each country, 
existing subjects were permitted to remain on ambrisentan if the investigator, guardians, and subjects 
wished. A global clinical enrolment hold was imposed soon afterwards, subject to availability of further 
nonclinical data. 
Further nonclinical investigations were conducted, and the findings submitted  to CHMP in November 
2017.  These studies demonstrated that ambrisentan can cause apnoea and hypoxemia in juvenile rats. 
Investigations also concluded that decreases in brain weight  were not  associated with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/476747/2021  
Page 43/107 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
neurobehavioural effects, brain microscopic or gene expression alterations. Although  not fully 
understood, it is postulated that  the juvenile rat brain weight  decrease could be mediated by sustained 
hypoxemia during a period of rapid brain growth that  was associated with  mechanically-induced 
apnoea. Thus, improper interaction  of rat laryngeal tissues, which  are in close apposition during early 
postnatal stage, may constitute  a sensitive period. This may be considered a potential  risk for young 
children (0 to 3 years) since the human oropharynx orientation has similarities with  the juvenile rat in 
early infancy and repositions with  age.  
All 41 enrolled subjects in this  study had either withdrawn  or completed the study during the  period 
between clinical hold initiation  and submission of nonclinical data to the CHMP.  To further support 
clinical use in children aged 8 to 18 years, an unplanned interim analysis including  all data collected up 
to January 2018  was conducted in which all safety, tolerability, population-PK, and efficacy data were 
reviewed, analysed and summarised. Taking into  consideration the duration of time elapsed since the 
initiation  of the clinical hold, shifts in clinical management for PAH during that  period, challenges 
relating to re-initiation  of recruitment, and the  potential for confounding when pooling and interpreting 
data from 2 potentially  distinct  populations, the unplanned interim analysis based on the  41 subjects 
was deemed a reasonable sample size for submission for review by the  PDCO, to inform a data-driven 
decision regarding the clinical and scientific merit of continuing  the study. 
Notification  of the opinion of a proposed PIP modification submitted  by GSK was received from the EMA 
PDCO in February 2019 (EMEA-000434-PIP01-08-M05).  The study was agreed to be closed and a 
reduction in number of subjects from the planned 66 subjects (for 60 evaluable) to  40 was accepted. 
Therefore, recruitment was not  re-initiated, the study was declared as terminated on 11  Feb 2019, and 
the unplanned interim analysis became the  final analysis for this  study (based on 41 subjects 
enrolled). 
Conduct of the study 
At the time of signature of the CSR, no major GCP noncompliance issues were identified by monitoring 
or audit. 
Approximately one fifth  of all subjects reported at least one important protocol deviation throughout 
the study (Table 16). Reasons for deviations were similar across dose groups.

Baseline data 
The study recruited 41 subjects. All of them were included in the  Safety Population and the ITT 
Population.  
The mean age (range) of subjects included in the study was 12.0 years (8 to 16  years), and a similar 
mean weight  was observed across the 2  dose groups (38.76  kg and 40.12 kg for the Low dose and 
High  dose group, respectively). There was a higher proportion of female subjects than  males (27 
females [66%]  across all subjects). Most  subjects were White/Caucasian/European heritage (30 
subjects [73.2%]).   
The majority of subjects (66%)  had idiopathic aetiology at  Baseline, with 80%  of all subjects receiving 
ongoing PAH therapy at the  start of the Treatment Period. The mean Baseline 6MWD test  was similar 
across the 2 dose groups (442.23  and 407.32  metres for the Low and High  dose groups, respectively).  
All subjects met  the protocol-defined diagnostic criteria of PAH (WHO  Group 1) and WHO  Class II or III 
symptoms, with over three-quarters of all subjects reported as Class II (indicating slight  limitation  of 
physical activity due to PAH as opposed to marked limitation  for Class III symptoms). The female 
predominance observed across the 2 dose groups (66%) aligns with  the known higher female 
prevalence in the wider paediatric/adult population,  and implications in the literature of a link with 
endogenous sex hormones (particularly 17β oestradiol and its metabolites) in the development of the 
disease.

A total of 39 subjects aged 8-16  years from study AMB112529  were included in the population  PK 
dataset. There was an almost equal number of subjects in  the Low (20) and High  (19) dose groups. 
The median (range) age across the 39  subjects was 13 (8-16)  years, with  approximately two-thirds of 
the population being females (67%)  and one third  being males (33%).  The median (range) body 
weight  at baseline was 36.1 (20.1-77.0)  kg. The majority of the population  was White  (72%), with 
15% being East Asian (East Asian heritage + Japanese heritage) and 13% Other (all remaining race 
groups). Of the East Asians, there were 5 Japanese subjects in the  Low dose group.  
Numbers analysed 
All 41 subjects were included in the Safety Population and the  ITT Population. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Six-minute walk distance (6MWD):  Overall, the mean (SD) 6MWD  was similar across the 2 dose groups 
at Baseline. Change from Baseline at Week 24  showed a mean improvement of approximately 55 
metres and 26 metres in the Low  dose and High dose groups, respectively.

Mean improvements in change from Baseline in 6MWD  were also observed from Week 4 and at all 
visits to Week 20  in both dose groups.

Subgroup analysis of 6MWD  by age 
Subjects in both age categories showed a similar pattern  of mean improvement from Baseline in  6MWD 
at Week 24  to that observed in the overall population (Table 20). The change from baseline in  6MWD 
at Week 24  was similar between the dose groups in paediatric subjects in the  12-18 age category but 
was higher in the Low dose group compared with  the high dose group in the 8-11 age category.

in Study AMB112529  (ITT Population) 
Subgroup analysis of responders to 6MWD  by PAH aetiology in  Study AMB112529   
An ad hoc analysis showed that  24 subjects (59%) had an increase from baseline in 6MWD of ≥20 
metres at  Week 12 and Week 24 in Study AMB112529  and these were fairly evenly distributed  across 
the idiopathic subgroup (15  of 27;  56%) and non-idiopathic subgroup (9 of 14; 64%). 
Clinical worsening of PAH: Three subjects in each dose group experienced clinical worsening of PAH 
during the study. The reasons and mean time to  clinical worsening of PAH were similar across the 2 
dose groups, the most frequent being clinical signs or symptoms of right sided heart failure and 
hospitalisation due to worsening of PAH. One patient  died in the low dose group due to worsening of 
PAH. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed similar event-free survival probability across both dose 
groups.

Population) 
World Health Organisation Functional  Class 
At all post-Baseline visits, the WHO  functional class for all subjects ranged from class I to III for 
subjects in the Low dose group and from class I to IV in  the High dose group. 
Other than 1 subject in the  Low dose group, all subjects had no change or an improvement in  WHO 
functional class at Week 24 and no subject shifted from Baseline by more than  1 class category (Table 
22). This pattern  of change was similar across the 2 age strata at Week 24. 
There was no clinically relevant mean change from Baseline in the  WHO functional class for either dose 
group based on summary statistics.

ProBNP: The geometric mean change from Baseline showed a similar percentage decrease from 
Baseline in NT-ProBNP concentrations across both dose groups at Week 12 and Week 24.  A mean (SD) 
percentage decrease of 29.63  (1.008)  was observed at Week 24  for both dose groups combined. 
Prognostic Factors Based on Echocardiograms 
Exploratory echocardiogram readings showed that  80% of all subjects had no pericardial effusion at 
Baseline with  a similar incidence observed for both dose groups. Mean (SD) values were also similar 
across dose groups for right  atrial pressure (mmHg), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (cm), 
eccentricity index systolic, eccentricity index diastolic, and tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (m/s);  9.7 
(5.34),  1.79 (0.426),  1.640  (1.1377),  1.283  (0.3589)  and 3.636 (1.5239),  respectively. 
The mean (SD) value for right ventricular pressure (mmHg)  at Baseline was lower in the  Low dose 
group compared with the  High dose group. 
At Week 24,  there was no change from Baseline in status  of pericardial effusion for most subjects 
(88% and 82%  with no change from Baseline in  the Low dose and High  dose respectively), and mean 
changes from Baseline were small and similar in both  dose groups for most other parameters. A mean 
(SD) decrease from Baseline in right ventricular pressure was observed in both dose groups. 
Cardiopulmonary Haemodynamics 
Additional cardiopulmonary haemodynamic data were collected for a small subgroup of subjects who 
underwent right  heart catheterisation (5 subjects in the  Low dose group and 2 subjects in  the High 
dose group). Small numerical improvements in haemodynamic parameters were observed at Week 24 
in the Low  dose group including cardiac index, mPAP and PVR. No subjects had Week 24 assessments 
in the High  dose group. 
Quality of life: Mean values in the Physical Health  and Psychosocial Summary scores remained stable 
across the Treatment Period for subjects in the  Low dose group, as measured using the SF-10 health 
survey. A small numerical increase in mean score was observed from Week 12 to  Week 24 in the 
Physical Health  Summary for subjects in the High  dose group. 
Missing school days: At Week 24, change from Baseline in number of missed school days within  the 
past month due to PAH ranged from a 19-day improvement to a 10-day worsening in the  Low dose 
group, and a 6-day improvement to no worsening in the High  dose group (median of 0  days for both 
dose groups). Correspondingly, change in  proportion of days missed within  the past month due to PAH 
ranged from a 95.45% improvement to  a 41.18%  deterioration in the Low dose group and a 23.49% 
improvement to no deterioration in the High  dose group. Other than 1 subject in the  Low dose group, 
all subjects had no change or an improvement in  WHO functional class at Week 24.  
Extension Study AMB114588 
Title: An open-label, long term extension study for treatment  of pulmonary arterial hypertension in 
paediatric patients  aged 8 years up to 18  years who have participated in AMB112529 and in whom 
continued treatment  with ambrisentan is desired. 
Investigator(s): Multi-centre study. 
Study centre(s): There were 22 centres in 9 countries who enrolled subjects; 3 in Argentina, 3 in 
France, 2 in Germany, 1 in Hungary, 2 in Italy, 3 in Japan, 3 in the  Russian Federation, 1 in Spain, and 
4 in the US. All of these investigational sites were the same as those which had participated in Study 
AMB112529. 
Publication(s): None at the  time of the interim study report (dated on 3rd April 2020)  submitted within 
this variation application. 
Study Period: 21 Jun  2011 (date of first subject roll-over from Study AMB112529)  – 12 Nov 2013  (last 
subject rolled over to this  long-term extension study). 
Data  cut-off date for this  interim report: 23  Aug 2019.

Phase of Development: IIb 
Objectives: 
Primary: The primary objective was the  long-term safety and tolerability of ambrisentan in the 
paediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) population. 
Secondary; Efficacy: 
•  All-cause mortality; 
•  The change from Study AMB112529 Baseline in the  6-minute walking distance (6MWD)  test 
evaluated every 6 months; 
•  The time to clinical worsening of PAH; 
•  The time to addition of another targeted PAH therapeutic agent(s) (prostanoids, PDE-5 inhibitors) 
due to the following reasons: 
•  Deterioration of clinical condition 
•  Lack of beneficial effect with  previous therapy (not  reaching set treatment goals); 
•  The time to change in dose of ambrisentan or other targeted PAH therapeutic agents (prostanoids, 
PDE-5 inhibitors) due to deterioration of clinical condition; 
•  The change from Study AMB112529 baseline in Subject Global Assessment every 3 months  using 
the Short Form – 10 item  (SF-10) health survey for children; 
•  The change from Study AMB112529 baseline in World Health Organisation functional class (WHO 
FC) every 6 months; 
•  Change from Study AMB112529  baseline in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) 
concentration every 6 months. 
Methodology: 
This was an open-label, long-term extension to  Study AMB112529. All subjects could remain in the 
extension study for a minimum of 6 months. Beyond the 6-month  period, subjects could continue in 
the extension study until  one of the following conditions was met: 
•  The subject turned 18 years of age (when the subject could receive marketed product); 
•  The product was approved and available for use in the subject’s age group; 
•  Development for use in the paediatric population was discontinued; 
•  The subject decided he/she no longer wanted to participate in the study; 
•  The investigator considered it  in the best interest of the subject to discontinue ambrisentan (e.g., 
for safety reasons). 
Subjects entered Study AMB114588  at an individually tailored dose based on the  investigator’s best 
judgement and consideration of body weight,  change in  clinical condition, tolerability issues, and any 
other relevant clinical consideration. The dose could be maintained at the same level, adjusted 
downward in 2.5 mg increments to not less than 2.5  mg per day, or adjusted upward in 2.5 mg 
increments to not more than  the lesser of 10 mg per day or 0.25  mg/kg per day. On completion of one 
of the specified study continuation  conditions, the subjects were treated according to best standard of 
care available to the investigator. Subjects had monthly, 3-monthly, and/or 6-monthly assessments as 
required for each parameter of interest, and were followed for 30  days post their last dose of study 
medication. In addition, subjects were asked to return for a pubertal development assessment at 20 
years of age. 
Number of subjects: 
In total, 38  of the  41 subjects who entered the initial  24-week study (Study AMB112529) continued 
into this  long-term extension study. 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: 
Subjects were eligible for enrolment in the study if they had participated and complied with  the 
protocol for Study AMB112529  and had completed the Week 24  Visit of Study AMB112529,  OR if the 
Week 24 Visit  had not  been completed, at least one of the following was applicable: the subject 
required additional targeted treatment for PAH due to inadequate response or worsening of their 
clinical condition prior to Week 24 in Study AMB112529;  the subject required reduction in dose of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/476747/2021

Baseline targeted treatment for PAH after ambrisentan was added to the treatment  regimen; continued 
treatment with  ambrisentan was warranted in the opinion of the investigator. 
Subjects were not eligible for this  long-term extension study if they were withdrawn from ambrisentan 
in Study AMB112529,  were unable to comply with Study AMB112529  protocol requirements, had 
severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min  as assessed within  the previous 
45 days of transition  from Study AMB112529  into this  study), or had clinically significant fluid  retention 
or anaemia. 
Treatment administration: 
The sponsor provided commercially available ambrisentan 5 mg (batch numbers: CBVNT, CFNC, DHHX, 
HHGW,  TZNN), and 10  mg tablets  (batch numbers: CBHKS, CFND,  DHHV, HHHB,  VBKM), as well as 
2.5 mg tablets of equivalent quality (batch numbers CDSH, GHVY, KHWV, KWKH,  NFGB, YCMK). For 
centres in  Japan, one or more 2.5 mg tablets were used to  achieve the appropriate dose. Subjects 
were dosed orally (tablet swallowed whole) once daily. Subjects could receive 2.5, 5,  7.5, or 10 mg of 
ambrisentan per day, as long as the dose did not  exceed 0.25 mg/kg/day. 
Statistical methods: 
Sample size calculation: Sample size was based on the number of subjects who entered and completed 
Study AMB112529.  No sample size calculations were performed. 
Analysis Populations: The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) Population consisted of all subjects who received at 
least 1 dose of study drug, which was used in all efficacy summaries. For the ITT population, the 
protocol had specified that subjects would be considered as belonging to  their dose group at the time 
of the visit/event, which was re-specified in the final Reporting and Analysis Plan to be their  treatment 
group at the time of entry to this study. 
The Safety Population was defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and was 
used in all safety summaries. Subjects were considered as belonging to  the dose group according to 
the highest dose received in the  study. 
Analysis Methods: All efficacy data were summarised descriptively and graphically, with  presentations 
by dose group and overall. The number of school days missed due to PAH was also specified under 
efficacy endpoints in the protocol in addition to  SF-10 assessments. 
Time to event parameters (clinical worsening, addition of other targeted PAH therapeutic agents, and 
change in dose of ambrisentan or other targeted PAH therapeutic agents) were presented graphically 
by Kaplan-Meier curves.  
Summary: 
Disposition  and Demographics: Of the 41 subjects who entered the initial 24-week study (Study 
AMB112529),  a total of 38 subjects were enrolled into  this long-term extension study. Approximately 
half had completed the study at  the time of the data cut-off for this interim report, with  a higher 
proportion completing the study for each increment in dose group. Of the remaining 20 subjects, 16 
had been withdrawn  and 4 were continuing  on treatment. In total,  7 females and 3 males returned for 
their 20-year old pubertal assessment. 
The most frequently reported primary reason for withdrawal was investigator discretion, followed by 
AE. Of the 5 subjects withdrawn due to an AE, all were due to fatal events not regarded as related to 
ambrisentan treatment. One further subject who died had an AE that initiated  during the study, but 
then completed the study treatment period prior to the  final AE outcome of death (and therefore is not 
counted among those withdrawn).

The majority of subjects were female (66%)  and the  mean age of subjects in this study increased with 
each dose increment (9.7,  11.9,  12.6, and 15.2  years for subjects from the 2.5,  5, 7.5, and 10 mg 
dose groups, respectively). Most subjects were White/Caucasian/European heritage (27  subjects 
[71%])  or of Japanese origin (5 subjects [13%]).  Approximately one third (32%)  of subjects were of 
Hispanic/Latino  ethnicity. 
The majority of subjects entering this  study (63%) had idiopathic  aetiology at Study AMB112529 
Baseline, with  approximately 80% of all subjects receiving ongoing PAH therapy at  start of 
ambrisentan treatment. 
All subjects entered into this  study were initially  classified as WHO  functional Class (FC)  II or III at 
Study AMB112529  Baseline in accordance with the protocol requirements. At entry to this  long-term 
extension study,  approximately one-quarter (24%) of subjects were classified as WHO FC I (least 
severe status). The remainders of subjects were FC II or III at the Entry Visit with  the exception of 1 
subject with  FC IV. Overall, the  mean Baseline 6MWD test  was 434.42 metres at Study AMB112529 
Baseline and 479.70  metres at entry to this  long-term extension study. 
Exposure and compliance: 
There were 4 subjects who remained ongoing in  this long-term extension study at the time of the data 
cut-off date for the interim report; exposure data for these subjects is not yet complete and were not 
included in summaries of exposure for this  report. The remaining 34  subjects, who  had completed or 
withdrawn  from the study at  the time of the data cut-off, received at least 14  weeks of investigational 
product, with  the longest duration of exposure among these 34 subjects being greater than 6 years. 
Efficacy and/or safety assessments were reported at or beyond Month  72 (6 years) and all were 
attributable  to the 4 ongoing subjects, with  1 subject continuing to  be assessed at 96 months (8 
years). The overall percentage of visits at which  a subject was compliant with  investigational product 
was 97.8%. 
Efficacy: 
There were 5 subjects who had a clinical worsening resulting in death during this study,  and the  mean 
time to death (all-cause mortality) was over 3 years from the start of treatment in Study AMB112529.   
One additional subject who died was inadvertently not entered onto the electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF) as a clinical worsening prior to  site closure (as intended in accordance with Protocol, Section 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/476747/2021

6.3.3).  Therefore, this subject was not  included in the efficacy analysis of time to death but  was 
included in safety summaries of fatal TEAEs. 
For subjects who entered this  long-term extension study, the mean (SD) 6MWD was lowest at Study 
AMB112529  Baseline for subjects from the  2.5 and 5 mg dose groups. At the Entry Visit to  this study, 
a mean improvement from Baseline had been observed across all dose groups, with the  largest 
improvement observed for subjects in the 2.5  mg group. Change from Baseline at the  End of Study 
Visit showed a mean improvement for all dose groups. There were 4 subjects with  assessments at 6 
years (Month  72), decreasing to 2 subjects at 6.5  years and 1 subject at 8 years. However, substantial 
positive improvements from Baseline continued to  be observed for these subjects whilst they remained 
in the study, with  increased walking distance ranging from 130.0  to 235.5  metres (equating to  a 
26.75%  to 56.00%  improvement from Baseline).

(end of study AMB114588) 
Subgroup analysis of 6MWD  by PAH aetiology in extension Study AMB114588 
An ad-hoc analysis showed that  more than  half of subjects had an increase from baseline in 6MWD  of 
≥20 metres at Month  12 and at the last observation in Study AMB114588. Around half of the 24 
subjects with idiopathic  PAH had an increase from baseline in 6MWD of ≥20  metres at Month  12 and at 
the last observation, respectively. Of the 14 subjects with  PAH aetiology other than idiopathic,  more 
than half had an increase from baseline of ≥20  metres at Month  12 and at the  last observation in 
Study AMB114588. 
Clinical worsening: Overall, 11 of 38 subjects experienced clinical worsening according to at least one 
criterion with the  most frequently reported reasons being death (5 subjects [13%])  and PAH-related

deterioration (4 subjects [11%]).  The time to first clinical worsening of PAH was variable across 
subjects and dose groups, with the  highest mean time reported for subjects in the 5 mg and 7.5 mg 
groups (315.5, 896.2,  1122.0,  and 228.0  days, in the 2.5  mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, and 10 mg dose groups, 
respectively). 
The time to first clinical worsening of PAH was variable across subjects and dose groups, with  the 
highest mean time reported for subjects in the  5 mg and 7.5 mg groups. The Kaplan-Meier analysis 
showed most events occurred within  3 years of Study AMB112529 Baseline (Figure below).

Worsening of PAH in Study AMB114588  (ITT Population) 
Rescue with  addition of other targeted PAH therapies: in total,  approximately 45% of subjects had 
another targeted PAH therapeutic agent added to their treatment regimen during the study, of which 6 
subjects were due to deterioration of their clinical condition,  and 3 subjects were due to lack of 
beneficial effect with  previous PAH therapy. The time to change in dose in ambrisentan or another 
targeted PAH therapeutic agent due to  deterioration of clinical condition ranged from approximately 12 
weeks to over 5 years. 
Change in  WHO FC: At  the Entry Visit to this  study, the majority of subjects had reported either the 
same WHO  FC category or a shift  that indicated improvement from Study AMB112529  Baseline, with 2 
subjects reporting a worsening (one from a WHO FC category of II to III, the other from II to IV). At 
the End of Study Visit, all subjects reported no change or an improvement from Study AMB112529 
Baseline in WHO  FC with  1 subject shifted from Baseline by more than 1 category. 
For the subjects who entered this  long-term extension study, the  geometric mean NT-proBNP 
concentration at Study AMB112529  Baseline was variable across subjects and dose groups which was 
also evident at the  Entry Visit to this study. The geometric change from Baseline showed a mean 
Assessment report

percentage decrease from Baseline across the lower dose groups (2.5 mg and 5 mg) at the End of 
Study Visit (65.66%  and 35.5% decrease, respectively with corresponding percentage increases of 
59.06%  and 101.96%  for the 7.5  mg and 10  mg groups, respectively). 
Psychosocial summary scores: For subjects entering this  long-term extension study, mean 
psychosocial summary scores at Study AMB112529 Baseline were similar across all dose groups with  a 
numerically higher mean Study AMB112529  Baseline Physical Health  score for subjects in the 2.5  mg 
dose group compared with  all higher dose groups. Mean scores in the  2 domains remained stable at 
the Entry Visit and across this  long-term extension study. 
School days missed: summary statistics  showed stability  or improvement across all dose groups with 
regards to change from Study AMB112529  Baseline in school days missed which ranged from a 21-day 
improvement to no change (median value of 6 days reduction) at the End of Study Visit. 
Correspondingly, change in  proportion of days missed due to  PAH at  End of Study ranged from a 100% 
improvement to no change.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses  and meta-analysis) 
The MAH has followed a request by the PDCO concerning a post-hoc extrapolation study in order to 
evaluate the efficacy in paediatric patients (8-18  years old) based on the variable change from baseline 
in 6MWD.   
The MAH proposed the  following analyses:  
1)  A frequentist analysis has been conducted to assess the appropriateness to treat all dosed patients 
from AMB112529  as a single combined dose group. The results are compared between the  adult 
AMB112565  study and the paediatric AMB112529  study to ensure that the efficacy data is 
consistent between both trials.  First, an ANCOVA analysis is performed on the primary endpoint 
where the  missing data is imputed  as 6MWD=0.  Also, a MMRM  was fitted  to the paediatric study 
with  an unstructured covariance structure. In addition,  due to  the imbalance in WHO  FC score 
across the two  doses in the paediatric data, two frequentist analyses were presented, one 
assuming balances classes in the population and the other assuming classes in the population 
proportional to the observed data. 
2)  A pooled analysis combines the results of 4 adult  studies (AMB112565,  AMB-220, AMB-320  and 
AMD-321) for the change from baseline in  6MWD with  the assumption that  the effect of 
ambrisentan on adults  with PAH follows the same distribution between studies 
3)  For the primary bayesian analysis of the change in the 6MWD  variable are considered two prior 
distribution;  an informative prior with a full borrowing (weight  = 1) from the  adult study 
AMB112565  and a non-informative prior (weight  = 0). Also, the MAH  proposes a bayesian 
“dynamic borrowing” approach (Schmidli, 2014)  and a tipping point  analysis are shown in order to 
justify post-hoc how much weight  should be chosen for the prior distribution  according to the data 
observed from the paediatric and adult studies. 
4)  Lastly, as sensitivity analysis, a similar analysis for 3) performed using this time the  4 adult 
studies. 
The results are strongly limited,  and a statistical  conclusion cannot be drawn from these analysis. 
Overall, the methods are endorsed as sensitivity analysis and no statistical conclusions should be made 
to justify the results since they are very limited, mainly for the small sample size, multiple dosing 
groups or lack of control arm.  
For the analysis proposed in  1) and 2) the MAH  suggests that  there is no significant difference between 
the two  dose groups due to  the overlapping of both sets, but from a regulatory point of view, that 
suggestion cannot be shared considering the  weak data analysed. The overlapping of the CI could be

product of the high variability of the  data (among other reasons) due to the limitations  explained 
above and no conclusions should be drawn. 
With  respect to 3) and 4)  the MAH states that  the results from the Bayesian analyses provide evidence 
of a significant  increase in 6MWD in paediatric subjects after the PDCO requested an extrapolation 
study. The selection of the amount  of data used for the  prior distribution  is essential and simulations of 
the operating characteristics showing adequate power with  overall adequate type I error control must 
be provide beforehand to justify the weight  selected. In this case, multiple  weights have been tested a 
posteriori once the data is available to assess the minimal amount of data necessary to have a positive 
outcome (weight of 25%).  Due to the numerous limitations,  no statistical conclusions should be made 
on the consistency between the paediatric and adult data. This analysis can only be seen as 
exploratory and could be useful for future studies.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This paediatric indication  is based on the pivotal phase IIb Study AMB112529, which  was a 6-month 
(24-week), randomised, open-label evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 2 doses of 
ambrisentan (Low and High, adjusted for body weight)  in paediatric subjects aged 8 years up to  18 
years with  PAH. The dossier also includes the open-label extension study AMB114588,  including 38 of 
the 41 children completing study AMB112529. 
All children received a fixed dose of 5 mg during the  first week of treatment in study AMB112529.  At 
week 2 onwards, the ambrisentan low dose was defined as 5 mg for children of  ≥35 kg, and 2.5 mg 
for children between ≥20  kg and <35 Kg. The ambrisentan high dose was defined as 10 mg in children 
≥50 kg, 7.5 mg in  children between  ≥35  kg and <50 Kg, and 5 mg in children between ≥20 kg and 
<35 Kg. The sponsor provided commercially available ambrisentan 5 mg tablets,  and 10  mg tablets as 
well as manufactured 2.5 mg tablets  of equivalent quality. 
The primary comparison stated in the AMB112529  protocol was to  evaluate the safety and tolerability 
of the 2 ambrisentan dose groups (Low versus High)  in the paediatric PAH population.  The secondary 
comparison was change from Baseline in the efficacy parameters between the 2 dose groups. Because 
subject recruitment was limited by the  low prevalence of the disease in children, powered clinical 
hypothesis tests were not  planned. Sixty-six subjects constituted  the selected sample size based on 
the predicted recruitment rate from historic data so that  the study could be completed in  a reasonable 
time frame (2 years) for it to  be useful and informative to the  medical community. A 10% drop out 
rate was anticipated  to leave 60 evaluable subjects.  
The study was stopped in March 2013  after 41 children (out of 60 planned) were recruited due to a 
nonclinical finding of brain weight decrease in juvenile rats with  low clinical margins for human 
paediatric dose exposures. Further nonclinical investigations were conducted, and the findings 
submitted  to CHMP in November 2017.  Notification  of the opinion of a proposed PIP modification 
submitted  by the applicant was received from the EMA  PDCO in February 2019  (EMEA-000434-PIP01-
08-M05).  The study was agreed to be closed and a reduction in  number of subjects from the planned 
66 subjects (for 60 evaluable) to 40 was accepted. Therefore, recruitment was not re-initiated, the 
Assessment report

study was declared as terminated on 11 Feb  2019, and the unplanned interim analysis became the 
final analysis for this study (based on 41  subjects enrolled). 
The study AMB114588 and its  open-label extension (study  AMB114588)  lacked a control group and 
therefore the results are difficult  to put  into clinical context. A placebo comparison is unfeasible in 
children with  PAH, and an active comparator is also challenging because of the need for a high sample 
size to allow for demonstration of superiority or non-inferiority in  a clinical context in which 
combination therapy is currently the standard practice. 
The 6MWD test was primarily used to demonstrate the efficacy of ambrisentan in the paediatric 
population in both  Study AMB112529 and its  long-term safety and efficacy Study AMB114588.  The 
analysis used imputed data for the  primary endpoint, where the worst-case scenario was imputed as 
6MWD=0  for missing data following death or hospitalization, and the traditional  LOCF imputation  was 
used in all other scenarios. 
In addition, a separate Bayesian analysis of data from the 6MWD from Study AMB112529 was 
performed. A meta-analysis to check consistency between the effects on 6MWD in adults and children 
was conducted. A population  PK modelling and simulation analysis was performed to explore the 
potential relationship between ambrisentan PK and change from baseline in 6MWD  at 12 and 24 weeks 
in the paediatric population in Study AMB112529  and if required, develop an exposure-response (ER) 
model relating ambrisentan PK to change from baseline in 6MWD. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In pivotal phase IIb study AMB112529,  in  41 children aged 8 to 17  years, Over the 24-week Treatment 
Period there was evidence of an improvement in exercise capacity (6MWD),  but there was no dose 
trend in the effect of ambrisentan on this  endpoint. The mean change from baseline at  Week 24 in 
6MWD for patients in the  low and high dose groups was +55.14 metres and +26.25  metres, 
respectively. In subgroup analyses, the change from baseline in  6MWD at Week 24  was similar 
between the dose groups in paediatric subjects in the  12-18 age category but was higher in the Low 
dose group compared with  the high dose group in the  8-11 age category. An ad hoc analysis showed 
that  24 subjects (59%) had an increase from baseline in  6MWD of ≥20 metres at Week 12 and Week 
24 in Study AMB112529  and these were fairly evenly distributed  across the idiopathic subgroup (15 of 
27; 56%)  and non-idiopathic subgroup (9 of 14; 64%).   
Regarding secondary endpoints, there were also positive shifts in  WHO functional class. At Week 24, 
95% and 100%  of patients  in the low and high dose groups, respectively, remained stable (no change 
or improved functional class). The number of paediatric subjects with  clinical worsening of PAH was 
small in both dose groups (3 in  each dose group). One patient died in the low  dose group due to 
worsening of PAH. The Kaplan-Meier event-free survivor estimate for worsening of PAH (death [all 
cause], lung  transplantation, or hospitalisation for PAH worsening or PAH-related deterioration) at 24 
weeks was 86% and 85% in  the low- and high dose groups, respectively. Haemodynamics were 
measured in 5 patients (low  dose group). There were also positive effects in haemodynamics: mean 
increase from baseline in cardiac index was +0.94  L/min/m2, the mean decrease in mean pulmonary 
arterial pressure was -2.2 mmHg,  and the mean decrease in PVR was -3.46  mmHg/L/min.  In addition, 
these efficacy findings were also supported by a small mean decrease in NT-proBNP over the 24-week 
Treatment Period. Geometric mean decrease from baseline in NT-pro-BNP was 31% in the low dose 
group (2.5 and 5 mg) and 28% in  the high dose group (5, 7.5,  and 10 mg). Change from Baseline in 
Physical and Psychosocial summary scores, as measured by the SF-10 health  survey, remained 
generally stable across the 24-week Treatment Period in  this study.  
Volibris is currently approved for treatment idiopathic  PAH (IPAH) and PAH associated with  connective 
tissue disease in adults only. The indication proposed by the Applicant in this  application contains 
above that  indications of familial PAH and corrected congenital PAH in paediatric population.  A 
discussion regarding the addition of these two latter PAH aetiologies in the indications was provided by 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/476747/2021  
Page 59/107 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the applicant. The Applicant also provided a discussion regarding extrapolation of ambrisentan efficacy 
from approved adults indications  IPAH and PAH associated in connective tissue disease. A similar 
exposure was demonstrated between children > 8yrs and adults and a similar PK/PD. In addition,  a 
similar shallow PK-PD relationship was confirmed between adults  and paediatric subjects >8yrs with 
PAH, which is consistent with  the expected similarity in PAH disease progression between these two 
populations. Therefore, the extrapolation from the adult indication  for IPAH and PAH associated with 
connective tissue disease is accepted. 
The applicant provided further effectiveness and safety data in  children with  familial PAH and corrected 
congenital PAH from literature and a Japanese post-marketing study (study  114782)  in 119 children 
with  PAH. These data were deemed sufficient to  conclude that  ambrisentan may be used in the range 
of PAH aetiologies included in the proposed paediatric indication.  
The applicant also provided a  subgroup analyses study AMB112529  for the primary endpoint in order 
to explore the consistency of the treatment  effect in important  patients subsets mentioned in the 
indication: single treatment  vs. combination treatment;  idiopathic PAH vs. other aetiologies; functional 
class II versus class III-IV; age <  12 vs. ≥  12 years. The results were consistent in most subgroups 
analysed.  
The applicant did not plan a statistical comparison of the change in 6MWD at  week 24 versus baseline 
values. As a result,  it was difficult to  interpret whether the 55.14 m improvement in the low dose 
group or the  40.69 metres improvement in the overall population after 24 weeks is statistically 
significant compared to baseline values. The applicant provided the results on 6MWD (improvement 
versus baseline) by dose group and as well for the total  study population, in terms of mean and 
median metres of change in 6MWD  with  95%CI. These data have been included in  section 5.1  of the 
SmPC.  
A comparison versus putative placebo was requested from the applicant. From the limited studies that 
do have placebo information for change from Baseline in 6MWD (SERAPHIN study in adults),  there is 
consistent evidence of a mean/median reduction in 6MWD across a 6-month period (with  approximate 
magnitude of 8 to 15 metres) compared with  an increased 6MWD  for active treatments. Data from the 
most closely matching study in  the literature (SERAPHIN study)  has allowed the applicant to provide an 
overall estimated treatment effect of 50.09  m (95% CI: 15.43,  84.75)  for study AMB112529,  which 
suggests superiority in favour of ambrisentan treatment. 
In addition, the applicant conducted a bibliographic search to discuss published studies with 
ambrisentan in children, and compared these results to those obtained in the study AMB112529  and its 
extension, in terms of studied populations (i.e.:  age ranges, PAH aetiology, FC, concomitant PAH 
therapies) and results (i.e.: change in 6MWD, clinical worsening, change in FC). These bibliographic 
references are supportive of the effectiveness of ambrisentan in various PAH aetiologies. A Japanese 
PMS study did include 7 subjects identified as having a familial aetiology. In the said PMS study, the 
majority had an aetiology of CHD (68.6%).  Although 6MWD  were not available in this  subset, there 
was a notable improvement in WHO Functional  Class in this  subset, as well as evidence of 
improvement in biomarkers (NTproBNP) and in haemodynamics (mPAP, PAWP and CO). 
There appears not to  be a dose-response relationship in 6MWD  and other secondary efficacy endpoints. 
In fact, most clinical outcomes, with  few exceptions, show a better effect for the low-dosing regime 
compared with  the high-dose regime. The applicant was invited to discuss about  the lack of dose-
response. The Company answered that  adult systemic exposure was found to be predictive of 
exposures in paediatric subjects from 8 to  less than 18  years of age in Study AMB112529 thereby 
supporting bridging of dose/exposure-dependent pharmacology between the two populations. Based on 
the extrapolation of exposure and response from adults to  paediatric subjects with  PAH, the proposed 
dose recommendation for paediatric subjects is primarily based on providing systemic exposure in the 
same range to adults with  PAH, and consistent with  the current dose recommendation for titration  in 
adult subjects with  PAH adjusted for body weight.  The explanation was considered acceptable and 
therefore, the recommendation included in section 4.2  regarding uptitration  according to  clinical 
response and tolerability can be maintained.

Looking at baseline NT-ProBNP concentrations it seems that  randomisation was not  successful, with 
more children in the high  dose groups having characteristics of a more severe disease and/or a better 
background treatment indicating  less room for improvement compared with  the low dose group. For 
example, more children in the high  dose group were on FCIII compared to the  low dose group (6 vs. 3) 
and patients in the  high dose group had higher mean NT-ProBNP levels than those randomised to the 
low ambrisentan dose, indicating  a worse cardiac function in patients  randomised to the high 
ambrisentan dose. In addition, there was also a significant imbalance in  the number of non-white,  non-
European subjects, with  more of these subjects been enrolled in the  low-dose group compared to the 
high-dose group (10 vs. 1),  and therefore the better outcome in the low dose group could be related to 
a suboptimal background therapy in  non-European subjects (10 of 11 non-white  non-European children 
fall in the low dose group). These baseline imbalances could explain to  some extent the lack of dose-
response in efficacy. Whether these imbalances may have led to the lack of demonstration of a dose-
response (i.e.: no better results on 6MWD with  the high dose compared to the low dose) cannot be 
confirmed or ruled out. In addition, few patients received rescue medications or change in concomitant 
cardiovascular medications. This information was provided by the applicant.  The introduction  of rescue 
medications or change in concomitant cardiovascular medications does not  appear to have influenced 
the assessment of the main outcome of 6MWD. 
Finally, study AMB112529  was stopped in 2013 due to nonclinical findings.  The applicant was 
requested to  discuss whether the study results are representative of current management of PAH in 
2020.  The applicant submitted  the results of a consultation  with  PAH experts and a literature review to 
support the external validity of study AMB112529,  as this  pivotal study for the application was stopped 
in 2013  and PAH treatment  approach has changed overtime. The consensus comments provided by the 
experts consulted were the  following: a) Regarding demographics, the ambrisentan paediatric study 
AMB112529  can be considered representative. The demographics of paediatric PAH have not changed 
in a way that  would affect generalizability of the ambrisentan paediatric data over the past decade; b) 
The majority of subjects in  AMB112529 were of IPAH aetiology, and familial PAH is usually analysed 
with  the IPAH group. The CHD population is representative as a percentage compared to what  is 
reported in paediatric and adult studies. It is notable that  having 4  CTD patients is quite  a high 
percentage in this  study compared to the rarity of this  condition as reported in ongoing paediatric 
registries; c) Combination therapy is commonly used in current practice for paediatric PAH patients, 
and the fact that  2/3rds of the  population in the ambrisentan trials were on combination therapy only 
increases the generalizability of the data. Newer agents like selexipag and orenitram are rarely used 
outside of ongoing studies (although being used more frequently off-label) and therefore do not impact 
the external validity of the ambrisentan data.  
In addition, a literature review conducted by the  applicant, including 10 references of contemporary 
PAH studies, also supports the  representative nature of the AMB112529  data to the current 
management of paediatric subjects with  PAH. As noted in the comments made by the IDMC and Expert 
Consultants,  the use of targeted PAH medications in  the majority of subjects in the trial is an important 
factor in defining the relevance of the study results to current practice. 
A total of 38 of 41 patients recruited in study AMB112529  entered the  long-term extension study 
AMB114588.  There was no further improvement in exercise capacity from start of study AMB112529  to 
end of study. In the  overall patients the improvement was of only 3  metres (from 41.49 metres at the 
entry visit to 44.82  metres at end of study). These data can be interpreted as that the  improvement 
observed during the 24-week study  was maintained during the  extension study. However, about half of 
the study population (45%)  needed the addition  of other PAH therapies due to  deterioration or 
insufficient response. Anyway, extension data are difficult  to interpret due to important methodological 
limitations  like small sample size, multiple dosing subgroups (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5  mg and 10  mg for a 
total of only 38 children), lack of control group and heterogeneous follow up  (between 3  months to 
over 5 years). No data of end of study visit were provided (mean follow-up  for these 6MWD values 
were not  provided). In addition, from entry visit in  the extension study to end of study visit there was 
a deterioration of 6MWD in  some dosing groups (2.5  mg: from 92.06  at entry visit to 71.47  metres at 
end of study; i.e.: 21 m deterioration; 7.5 mg: from 53.48  m at entry visit to 3.05  m at  end of study; 
i.e.: 50 m deterioration). The interpretation of these results is hampered by the low number of 
subjects by dosing group (i.e.: 9 children in the 2.5  mg subgroup and 5 children in the 7.5  mg 
Assessment report

subgroup). Overall, 11 of 38 subjects (29%) experienced clinical worsening during the  extension study 
AMB114588  according to at least one criterion with  the most  frequently reported reasons being death 
(5 subjects [13%])  and PAH-related deterioration (4  subjects [11%]).  The Kaplan-Meier analysis 
showed most events occurred within  3 years of Study AMB112529 Baseline. All deaths reported in 
Study AMB114588  were due to events associated with the  natural progression profile and known 
characteristics of children with  PAH disease, with  a mean time  to death of over 3  years from treatment 
initiation.  None of the deaths were considered related to ambrisentan. The time to  first clinical 
worsening of PAH was variable across subjects and dose groups and ranged from approximately 100 
days to over 5  years. NT-proBNP values were variable across the duration of the long-term extension 
Study AMB114588  there was evidence of a small mean decrease from Study AMB112529  Baseline at 
the End of Study Visit. Change from Baseline in Physical and Psychosocial summary scores, as 
measured by the  SF-10 health survey, remained generally stable across the duration of long-term 
Study AMB114588.  In summary, the extension study AMB114588  showed that 71%  of children 
remained clinically stable on treatment  without  deterioration, while about 29% of children had 
deterioration despite the  addition of other target PAH therapeutic agents. In the absence of a control 
group no firm conclusions can be made, but anyway the  results are consistent with  the natural 
progression of the PAH disease. 
A Bayesian extrapolation analysis conducted by the  applicant suggest that the  increases in 6MWD  by 
26.25  m to 55.14 metres from baseline to week 24 in the  high and low dose groups in children is 
consistent to those reported with ambrisentan in placebo-controlled trials in adults.  However, the 
extrapolation has a number of major limitations.  First  of all, all the  results are strongly limited,  and a 
statistical  conclusion cannot be drawn from these analysis. Overall, the  methods are endorsed as 
sensitivity analysis and no statistical conclusions should be made to justify the results since they are 
very limited, mainly for the  small sample size, multiple  dosing groups or lack of control arm.  The MAH 
suggests that  there is no significant difference between the two  ambrisentan dose groups due to the 
overlapping of both sets, but  from a regulatory point of view, that suggestion cannot be shared 
considering the  weak data analysed. The overlapping of the  CI could be product of the  high variability 
of the data (among other reasons) due to the  limitations explained above and no conclusions should be 
drawn. The MAH also states that the  results from the Bayesian analyses provide evidence of a 
significant increase in 6MWD  in paediatric subjects after the PDCO requested an extrapolation study. 
The selection of the amount of data used for the prior distribution  is essential and simulations of the 
operating characteristics showing adequate power with  overall adequate type I error control were to be 
provided beforehand to justify the weight  selected. In this  case, multiple weights  have been tested a 
posteriori once the data is available to assess the minimal amount of data necessary to have a positive 
outcome (weight of 25%).  Due to the numerous limitations,  it only should be seen as exploratory and 
it could be useful for future studies.  The CHMP  requested additional clarification of aspects of the meta-
analysis and Bayesian analysis. In this respect, the Applicant was asked to thoroughly justify why 
meta-analysis was not performed also for dose 5 mg. The most important adult  study AMB112565 
from the  Applicant’s point of view includes only dose 10 mg for ambrisentan. Thus, comparison to 
paediatric study AMB112529  can be performed only with  respect to dose 10 mg. Moreover, both 
studies have the same treatment period of 24 weeks. Thus,  information from study AMB112565  for 
comparison with  study AMB112529  with respect to endpoint 6-minute  walk distance is the most 
relevant. This was considered acceptable. 
Considering only pooled data,  (data both from dose 5 mg and dose 10 mg) for Bayesian sensitivity 
analysis can be problematic. In this case, information about  individual doses is lost. The Applicant was 
asked to discuss bias of results in comparison to Bayesian sensitivity analysis which would  be 
performed separately for dose 5 mg and separately for dose 10 mg. The Applicant clarified that  they 
performed meta-analysis based on studies including data for dose 5 mg and data for dose 10 mg, 
respectively. Studies using  dose 5 mg (AMB-220,  AMB-320 and AMB-321) gave summary effect for 
mean change from baseline in 6-minute  walk distance (6MWD)  37.2 metres with  standard error (SE) 
6.13  metres. This result can be related to change from baseline to week 12 as all studies investigate 
12-week treatment period. Studies using dose 10 mg (AMB112565,  AMB-220 and AMB-320)  gave 
summary effect for mean change from baseline in 6MWD 30.2  metres with  SE 4.43 metres. This result 
cannot be clearly related to change from baseline in 6MWD to any fixed time point  as study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/476747/2021  
Page 62/107 
 
 
 
 
AMB112565  investigates 24-week treatment period and studies AMB-220, AMB-320 investigate 12-
week treatment period. If both doses are combined, then mean change from baseline in 6MWD  is 32.6 
metres with  SE 3.59 metres. This is comparable with results for dose 10 mg alone due to  statistical 
insignificance with combined dose. Thus,  combined dose was used for Bayesian sensitivity analysis. 
The Applicant further justified combination of doses by comparison of mean change from baseline in 
6MWD in  3 adult studies with  dose 5 mg with  mean change from baseline in 6MWD in 3  adult studies 
with  dose 10 mg. Resulting  95% confidence interval for difference in mean change from baseline in 
6MWD between dose 5 mg and dose 10 mg is (-7.82,  21.82) metres. This is a biased comparison as 
length of treatment periods differ for dose 10 mg and comparison with  dose 5 mg is disputable. 
Overall, the primary Bayesian analysis led to an acceptable result. In this case, both  adult study 
AMB112565  and paediatric study AMB112529  had 24-week treatment  period. Further,  not so much 
prior weight  was given to  data from adult study (weight  0.25)  in mixture of prior distribution for adult 
data with  prior distribution  for paediatric data to conclude statistically significant increase in 6MWD  in 
paediatric patients  treated with ambrisentan. The issue was considered as resolved.

2.6.1.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy data supporting this  paediatric indication  for ambrisentan is mainly composed by study 
AMB112529,  which was a 6-month (24-week), randomised, phase IIb, open-label evaluation of the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 2 doses of ambrisentan (Low  and High, adjusted for body weight)  in 
paediatric subjects aged 8 years up to  18 years with PAH.  
The study planned to include 60 subjects but was stopped in March 2013, after 41 children were 
recruited, due to  a nonclinical finding  of brain weight  decrease in juvenile rats with  low clinical margins 
for human paediatric dose exposures. Further nonclinical investigations were conducted, and the 
findings submitted  to CHMP in  November 2017.  
All children received a fixed dose of 5 mg during the  first week of treatment. At week 2 onwards, the 
ambrisentan low dose was defined as 5 mg for children of  ≥ 35 kg, and 2.5 mg for children between ≥ 
20 kg and <35 Kg. The ambrisentan high  dose was defined as 10 mg in children ≥50 kg, 7.5 mg in 
children between  ≥35 kg and <50  Kg, and 5 mg in children between ≥20  kg and <35  Kg. The sponsor 
provided commercially available ambrisentan 5 mg tablets, and 10 mg tablets  as well as manufactured 
2.5 mg tablets of equivalent quality. 
The study showed an improvement in  exercise capacity in children treated with  ambrisentan at 24 
weeks compared with  baseline values and some positive shifts in FC  and haemodynamic secondary 
endpoints. The sponsor did not  plan a statistical  comparison of the change in  6MWD at week 24  versus 
baseline values, which is unfortunate. As a result, it  was difficult to interpret  whether the 55.14 m 
improvement observed in the low dose group or the 40.69  metres improvement reported in  the overall 
population after 24 weeks is statistically significant  compared to baseline values. The applicant 
provided the results on 6MWD (improvement versus baseline) by dose group and well as for the total 
study population, in  terms of mean and median metres of change in  6MWD with  95%CI. These data 
have been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The number of paediatric subjects with  clinical worsening of PAH was small in both dose groups (3 in 
each dose group). In the  absence of a control group no firm conclusions can be made, but anyway the 
results are consistent with  the natural progression of the PAH disease. 
A total of 38 of 41 patients recruited in study AMB112529  entered the  long-term extension study 
AMB114588.  There was no further improvement in exercise capacity from start of study AMB112529  to 
end of study. In the  overall patients the improvement was of only 3  metres (from 41.49 metres at the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/476747/2021

entry visit to 44.82  metres at end of study). These data can be interpreted as that the  improvement 
observed during the 24-week study  was maintained during the  extension study. However, about half of 
the study population needed the addition of other PAH therapies due to deterioration or insufficient 
response.  
A Bayesian extrapolation analysis conducted by the  applicant suggest that the  increases in 6MWD  by 
26.25  m to 55.14 metres from baseline to week 24 in the  high and low dose groups in children is 
consistent to those reported with ambrisentan in placebo-controlled trials in adults.   
Despite limitations  of studies presented, ambrisentan is expected to provide benefit in treating children 
also with  PAH associated with  CHD and familial PAH. It is acknowledged that due to rare nature of the 
disease, the data regarding the  familial and corrected congenital PAH are limited.  From data presented 
the main support of the broader indication comes from the subgroup analysis of study AMB112529, 
which are supported by additional data provided from literature reference and a post-marketing 
authorization study in Japan in children with  PAH of various PAH aetiologies (n=119).  A description of 
the types of “corrected congenital” heart defects reported in the  11 children with CHD in  the 
AMB112529  study are included in the SmPC, in order to better describe target population with 
corrected congenital PAH. 
2.6.2.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In the present application all clinical studies contributing  to support the  safety information from 
children and adolescents aged 8 to  less than 18  years were study AMB112529  and its  extension study 
AMB114588. 
Overall Extent of Exposure 
The ITT efficacy population was the same than  the Safety population.  Please see Efficacy section. 
Study AMB112529 
Exposure to ambrisentan ranged from 53 to 184  days, with  a median duration of 169 days (24.1 
weeks) in the  low dose group (n=21).  Exposure to ambrisentan ranged from 17  to 190 days, with  a 
median duration of 171  days (24.4  weeks) in the high  dose group (n=20).   
At least 94% of subjects in each dose group were treatment-compliant (defined as receiving ≥80% 
and ≤120%  of planned study treatment) at  all visits. The overall percentage of visits at which a 
subject was compliant was 98.5%. 
All 41 subjects received at least 2 weeks of ambrisentan and 37  subjects (90%)  completed the planned 
treatment period of 24  weeks. 
Extension study AMB114588 
Overall, exposure to ambrisentan ranged from 100  to 2,346  days (14.3 to  335.1 weeks), with a 
median duration of 1,263  days (176.6  weeks) (Table 26). The median duration of exposure to 
ambrisentan was comparable across dose groups. More than half of the subjects received ambrisentan 
treatment for at least 3 years and the  longest cumulative* duration of treatment  was greater than 6.6 
years. 
(*Note:  this represents combined exposure to ambrisentan for Study AMB112529  and the extension 
study.)

At the time of data cut-off date (23 August  2019) for the interim analysis, 4  ongoing subjects in the 
extension study were excluded from analysis of the  exposure data since the data were not yet 
complete. Therefore, the exposure data presented in this  section are for 34  subjects. With  the 
exception of exposure data, all 4 ongoing subjects were included in the safety analysis. 
Table 26 Summary of Exposure to Ambrisentan, Study AMB114588  (Safety  Population) 
1. Subjects were considered  as belonging to the treatment group according  to the highest  dose received. 
At least 75% of subjects in each dose group were treatment-compliant (defined as receiving ≥80% 
and ≤120%  of planned study treatment) at  each visit. The overall percentage of visits at which a 
subject was compliant was 97.8%  with  a similar mean percentage compliance for all dose groups 
(93.1%  to 100.0%). 
Demographic Characteristics  
For further details, please see efficacy section. 
PAH History 
Patients who entered at study AMB114588  were diagnosed with  IPAH (24/38 subjects [63%]), 
persistent PAH despite surgical repair (8/38  subjects [21%]), connective PAH (4/38 subjects [11%])  or 
familial PAH (2/38 subjects [5%]). 
Ongoing Background PAH Therapy  
Overall, 68% of subjects (26/) from study AMB114588  had at  least one ongoing background PAH 
medication at entry to the extension study:  use of a PDE-5 inhibitor  as monotherapy (mainly sildenafil) 
was recorded in 17 subjects (45%); the PDE-5 inhibitor  in combination with  a prostanoid were used in 
8 subjects (21%) and all were in  the lower dose groups (2.5  mg and 5 mg). 
Adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs) from study AMB112529  and its ongoing long-term extension study  AMB114588 
were categorized by treatment period based on time of occurrence. 
Treatment-emergent AEs were defined in the study AMB112529  as events that  started on or after first 
dose date of study treatment, whereas in  the study AMB114588  they were defined as either events 
starting in  the extension study or events starting  in study AMB112529  and continuing into  the 
extension study.  As the number of subjects in  each dose group of study AMB114588  was determined 
by the subjects rolled-over from study AMB112529 and some dose groups had small numbers, 
interpretation using overall subjects has been predominantly employed in this document. 
Baseline values (collected prior to the  first dose of ambrisentan) recorded in study AMB112529  were 
also the  baseline values for the extension study. 
Treatment-Emergent  Common AEs 
Study AMB112529 
The majority of subjects reported at least 1 treatment-emergent AE and the majority were mild (22%) 
or moderate (49%) in intensity.  The incidence observed was similar in both  dose groups (81% in the 
low dose group and 80% in  the high dose group) (Table 27). 
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AE in both  dose groups was headache (6 subjects 
[30%]  in the high dose group and 4 subjects [19%]  in the low dose group). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/476747/2021  
Page 65/107 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall incidence of AEs during  the first 2 weeks of treatment was 57% in the  low dose group and 
35% in  the high dose group. The most common AEs during the first 2  weeks of treatment  were 
headache for both dose groups (4, 19% of subjects in the low dose group and 5, 25%  in the high dose 
group). The first occurrence of treatment-emergent AEs for all subjects were within  8 weeks of starting 
ambrisentan treatment in the low dose group and within  16 weeks in the high dose group. 
SOCs with  the highest  incidence of treatment-emergent AEs were those relating gastrointestinal  (GI) 
disorders and infections and infestations for both  dose groups.  
Table 27 Treatment-Emergent  AEs Occurring in >1 Subject  in any  Dose Group, Study 
AMB112529  (Safety  Population) 
Low dose: 2.5 mg (body weight ≥20 kg and <35 kg); 5 mg (≥35 kg). 
High dose: 5 mg (body weight ≥20 kg and <35 kg); 7.5 mg (≥35 kg and <50 kg); 10 mg (≥50 kg). 
Extension study AMB114588 
Overall, 89% of subjects reported at least 1 treatment-emergent AE and the  majority were mild (21%) 
or moderate (37%) in intensity.  The lowest incidence (81%)  was observed in the  5 mg group (Table 
28). 
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AE for overall subjects was upper respiratory tract 
infection (10  subjects, 26%)  followed by nasopharyngitis (9  subjects, 24%). 
The overall incidences of first occurrence AEs were reported in 23 subjects (61%) for the first year of 
the study, 76%  of subjects (29)  for year 2, 82%  of subjects (31) for year 3, and 87%-89%  of subjects 
(33-34)  from year 4 through  year 8. The most common AE during the first year of the study was 
headache (5 subjects, 13%). 
SOCs with  the highest  incidence of treatment-emergent AEs were those relating Infections and 
Infestations (61%) for all dose groups.

Treatment-Emergent  AEs by Relationship to Ambrisentan 
A drug-related AE was an event recorded by the  investigator as having a reasonable possibility of 
being caused by the treatment with  ambrisentan. 
Study AMB112529 
The overall incidence of drug-related AEs was 38% in the low  dose group and 35%  in the high dose 
group (Table 29).  Headache was the most frequently reported drug-related AE for both dose groups (3 
each). The drug-related AEs reported in more than 1  subject were nasal congestion and oedema 
peripheral in the low dose group and nausea in the high dose group.

Other  Significant Adverse Events 
The events of anaemia, hepatoxicity, hypersensitivity, hypotension, male infertility,  and oedema/fluid 
retention were specified as Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) for both studies. 
Study AMB112529 
Treatment-emergent AESIs were reported in 6 subjects (with  8 events) in  the low dose group and in 3 
subjects (with  3 events) in the  high dese group (Table 31).  With  the exceptions of anaemia and 
hypotension (1 each in the  low dose group), all events were oedema-related events. Regardless of 
dose groups, AESIs reported in more than 1 subject were oedema peripheral and face oedema (3 
each), which occurred within  the first 16 weeks and first 8  weeks, respectively. 
Assessment report

Six AESIs were considered by the  investigator to  be related to ambrisentan treatment:  4 events 
(oedema peripheral, face oedema, angioedema, hypotension) in the low  dose group; 2 events 
(oedema peripheral and face oedema) in the high  dose group. 
No AESIs led to permanent discontinuation of ambrisentan treatment or withdrawal from the  study.

High dose: 5 mg (body weight ≥20 kg and <35 kg); 7.5 mg (≥35 kg and <50 kg); 10 mg (≥50 kg). 
Extension study AMB114588 
Overall, treatment-emergent AESIs were reported in  20 subjects (53%) with  a comparable percentage 
of subjects who  had at  least 1 event in each dose group (Table 32). 
Anaemia was the most frequently reported AESI, with  11 events in 6 subjects (all in the 5 mg and 10 
mg dose groups). An SAE of anaemia was reported in 2 subjects. Three events of anaemia in 2 
subjects were considered by the investigator to be related to ambrisentan treatment. 
Oedema-related events (including  terms of oedema peripheral, angioedema, ascites, eyelid oedema, 
eye swelling, localised oedema, and swelling face) were reported in  6 subjects with  8 events. One 
subject had events of localised oedema, ascites, and angioedema. Events of angioedema and swelling 
face were considered by the investigator to be related to  ambrisentan treatment. 
Liver function  laboratory abnormalities (including  terms of ALT increased, AST increased, AST 
abnormal, blood bilirubin increased, and transaminases increased) were reported as AEs/SAEs in  3 
subjects. One subject had an SAE of ALT increased Two mild AEs of AST abnormal and AST increased 
were also reported for this subject. The second subject had the events of AST increased and blood 
bilirubin increased and both events were considered by the investigator to be related to ambrisentan 
treatment. The third subject reported 2 moderate AEs of transaminases increased separately and none 
were considered by the investigator to be related to ambrisentan treatment 
A severe AE of hepatomegaly was reported, with no associated liver function laboratory abnormality 
during the study. 
Events of hypotension (including  terms of syncope, presyncope, and hypotension) were reported in 2 
subjects. One subject had events of syncope and presyncope; both events were considered by the 
investigator to be related to ambrisentan treatment. 
An event of hypotension in 1 subject was reported as an SAE*. 
No AESIs led to permanent discontinuation of ambrisentan treatment or withdrawal from the  study. 
The majority of AESIs were resolved. There was no correlation between the time on treatment and the 
first occurrence of an AESI.

Treatment-Emergent Common AEs 
In the 8-11  years age stratum, the majority of subjects reported at least 1 treatment-emergent AE: 
71% of subjects (5) in the low  dose group and 57%  of subjects (4)  in the high dose group. AEs that 
occurred in more than  1 subject were abdominal pain, pharyngitis, and vomiting  (2 subjects each) in 
the low dose group and none were reported in the high dose group. 
In the 12 to <18  years age stratum,  treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 86% of subjects in  the 
low dose group and 92% of subjects in the high dose group. 
Abdominal pain upper, headache, and nausea were the most frequently reported AEs in the  low dose 
group (3 subjects each). Headache was the  most frequently reported AE in the high  dose group (6 
subjects). 
• 
Treatment-Emergent AEs by Relationship to Ambrisentan 
In the 8-11  years age stratum, 3 treatment-emergent AEs (eosinophilia, vomiting,  and headache) in  2 
subjects in the low dose group and an AE of lymphopenia in 1 subject in the high dose group were 
considered by the investigator to  be related to ambrisentan treatment. 
In the 12-18  years age stratum, treatment-emergent AEs that were considered by the investigator to 
be related to ambrisentan treatment were reported in 6 subjects in each dose group. Drug-related AEs 
of oedema peripheral, headache, and nasal congestion were reported in 2 subjects each in the low 
dose group. Headache was the most frequently reported drug-related AE in the high dose group (3 
subjects). 
•  SAEs 
In the 8-11  years age stratum, treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 3 low dose subjects (device 
breakage, pharyngitis, and syncope) and in 2 high  dose subjects with  3 events (acute cardiac failure, 
right ventricular failure, and device related infection).  
In the 12 to <18  years stratum, 3 subjects in the low dose group reported treatment-emergent SAEs 
of general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and pulmonary hypertension. No  SAE was 
reported in the  high dose group. 
•  AEs/SAEs Leading to Premature Discontinuation  of Investigational Product and/or Study 
One subject (12  to <18 years year-old) in the  low dose group had an SAE of pneumonia that  led to 
withdrawal from the study. The subject died due to  pneumonia. 
Treatment-Emergent  AEs by Age in Study AMB114588 
A total of 14 subjects aged 8-11  years and 24  subjects aged 12 to <18  years were enrolled in the 
extension study.  Numbers of subjects in each dose group in  the 8-11 years age stratum  in the Safety 
Population were 4,  7, and 3 in the 2.5 mg, 5  mg, and 10  mg groups*, respectively. Numbers of 
subjects in each dose group in the  12 to <18  years age stratum in the Safety Population were 9, 6, 
and 9 in the 5 mg, 7.5  mg, and 10 mg groups**, respectively. Treatment-emergent AEs that  occurred 
in those subjects were analysed by age. 
(*Note:  No subject was in  the 7.5 mg group in the 8-11  years age stratum. 
**Note:  No subject was in the 2.5 mg group in the 12-18  years age stratum.) 
• 
Treatment-Emergent Common AEs 
In the 8-11  years age stratum, all subjects but 1 reported at least 1  treatment-emergent AEs. AEs that 
occurred in more than  2 subjects were nasopharyngitis (4),  pharyngitis (4), upper respiratory tract 
infection (4),  gastroenteritis (3),  influenza (3). 
In the 12 to <18  years age stratum,  the majority of subjects reported at least 1 treatment-emergent 
AE. The most frequently reported AEs were headache and upper respiratory tract infection (6 subjects 
each).

In the 8-11  years age stratum, treatment-emergent AEs that were considered by the investigator to be 
related to  ambrisentan treatment were reported in 4 subjects with  7 events (2  subjects with  4 events 
in the 10  mg group and 1 each in the 2.5 mg and 5 mg groups). An AE of gastroenteritis was reported 
in 2 subjects (1 each in the 2.5 mg and 10 mg groups). The rest of the events included deafness (2.5 
mg group) oedema peripheral (5 mg group), nasopharyngitis, skin laceration, and swelling face (all in 
the 10 mg group). 
In the 12 to <18  years age stratum,  treatment-emergent AEs that  were considered by the investigator 
to be related to  ambrisentan treatment were reported in 11 subjects (46%).  Drug-related AEs 
occurring in  more than 1 subject were headache (3) and anaemia (2). 
In the 8-11  years age stratum, treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 9 subjects (64%). An SAE 
that  occurred in more than 1  subject was cardiac failure acute (2,  all in the 5 mg group). 
In the 12 to <18  years age stratum,  treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 12  subjects (50%). 
SAEs that  occurred in more than  1 subject were anaemia pneumonia, and pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (2  each). 
•  AEs/SAEs Leading to Premature Discontinuation  of Investigational Product and/or Study 
In the 8-11  years age stratum, 4 subjects were withdrawn  from the  study or were withdrawn from 
ambrisentan treatment due to an AE or SAE: cardiac failure acute (2) and acute right ventricular failure 
(1) in the  5 mg dose group and pulmonary arterial hypertension (1) in the 10  mg dose group. 
In the 12 to <18  years age stratum,  1 subject in  the 7.5 mg dose group was withdrawn  from the study 
and was withdrawn from ambrisentan treatment  due to  an SAE of failure to thrive. 
Serious adverse  events  and deaths 
Study AMB112529 
A total of 9 treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were reported in 8 subjects: 6 SAEs in 
6 subjects in the low dose group and 3 SAEs in 2 subjects in the high dose group (Table 33). None of 
these SAEs occurred in more than  1 subject. With  the exception of the fatal event of pneumonia, all 
events were resolved and all subjects continued their ambrisentan treatment. With  the exception of 
general physical health deterioration, none of these SAEs were considered by the investigator to be 
related to  ambrisentan treatment.   
Table 33 Treatment-Emergent  SAEs, Study AMB112529  (Safety  Population) 
1. The event was assessed by the investigator to be related to ambrisentan treatment. 
Low dose: 2.5 mg (body weight ≥20 kg and <35 kg); 5 mg (≥35 kg). 
High dose: 5 mg (body weight ≥20 kg and <35 kg); 7.5 mg (≥35 kg and <50 kg); 10 mg (≥50 kg). 
Extension study AMB114588 
A total of 38 treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 21 subjects (55%)  (Table 34).  SAEs which 
occurred in more than  2 subjects each were: PAH (3 in  the 10 mg dose group), anaemia (2;  1 each in 
the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups), cardiac failure acute (2 in the 5 mg dose group), and pneumonia 
(2; 1 each in the 5 mg and 7.5 mg dose groups). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/476747/2021

Two SAEs (cardiac failure acute and failure to thrive) led to discontinuation  of ambrisentan. Three SAEs 
(ALT increased, atrioventricular block complete, and hypotension) in 1 subject led to ambrisentan 
treatment being temporarily interrupted. 
SAEs with  a fatal outcome were reported in 6 subjects. 
None of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to  ambrisentan treatment.

One 12 to <18  years -old subject  in the low  dose group died due to an SAE of pneumonia. The event 
of pneumonia was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to ambrisentan treatment. 
Extension study AMB114588 
As the data cut-off date for the interim  analysis, 6 subjects had died due to an SAE and are tabulated 
in Table 35. For these 6 deaths, 3 were in the  5 mg dose group, 1 in the 7.5  mg dose group, and 2 in 
the 10 mg dose group. The causes of deaths were due to acute cardiac failure in 3 subjects (including 
acute right ventricular failure in 1 subject), worsening of PAH in 2 subjects, and failure to thrive in 1 
subject. Treatment with ambrisentan was recorded as discontinued in 2  subjects and “not  applicable” 
in 4 subjects; all 4 subjects were recorded having the  last dose of ambrisentan 1  or 2 days before they 
died. None of the deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to ambrisentan treatment. 
All deaths, with  a mean time to death of more than 3  years from treatment initiation,  were recorded as 
resulting in withdrawal  from the study (as was intended by the protocol), with  the exception of 1 
subject with  an event of PAH (deterioration of) with  onset during participation in the  study, who 
subsequently reached the age of 18 and hence completed the treatment period and the study prior to 
the final event outcome of death.

Laboratory and clinical findings 
Haematology   
Haematology included platelet  count, red blood cell (RBC) count,  reticulocyte count,  haematocrit, 
haemoglobin, RBC indices (mean corpuscular volume [MCV],  mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH], 
and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC]),  white blood cell (WBC) count, and 
automated WBC differential (neutrophils total,  lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils). 
Haematology were assessed at baseline and at every 4-week clinical visits over 24 weeks treatment in 
study AMB112529,  whereas they were assessed every 3-month throughout  the study and at the end of 
study visit in study AMB114588.

•  Haematology Values Over Time 
Study AMB112529 
There were no clinically relevant changes in blood haematology parameters over time other than  a 
small mean reduction from baseline in haemoglobin, haematocrit, and platelet count  for both  dose 
groups, which was consistently evident by Week 4 and remained stable thereafter. The mean change 
from baseline at Week 24 across both  dose groups was -12.1  g/L, -0.0378,  and -26.0  GI/L for 
haemoglobin, haematocrit, and platelet count,  respectively. 
Extension study AMB114588 
Mean values of haematology parameters were generally within  the normal reference range throughout 
the study. 
There were small mean reductions from baseline in haemoglobin, haematocrit, and platelet count for 
overall subjects. The mean reductions continued to be observed by Month  36. Fewer than half of 
subjects remained at Month  36 visit and onward in the study, and there were too few subjects in each 
dose group to provide a meaningful interpretation.  
There were also small mean reductions in red blood cell indices, as well as lymphocytes.  
•  Haematology Abnormalities of Potential  Clinical Concern 
Study AMB112529 
Few subjects (≤2 in  a specific lab parameter) in  each dose group had haematology (haemoglobin, 
haematocrit, and platelet count) values of potential clinical concern (PCC) and there was no increase in 
incidence over time in the study. 
Laboratory abnormalities were reported as AEs in 3 subjects with  4 events (neutropenia, anaemia, 
eosinophilia [drug-related], and leukopenia) in the  low dose group and in 1 subject with  3 events 
(neutropenia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia [drug-related]) in the high dose 
group.  
Extension study AMB114588 
Overall, few subjects (≤4  in a specific lab parameter) had haematology (haemoglobin, haematocrit, 
and platelet count) values of clinical concern at  any post-baseline. None of these values of potential 
clinical concern were observed at the entry visit to the  extension study. 
Laboratory abnormalities were reported as AEs in 10  subjects including  anaemia (6), iron deficiency 
anaemia (3), and neutropenia (1). AEs of anaemia in 2 subjects were considered by the investigator to 
be related to ambrisentan treatment. 
Clinical Chemistry and  Liver Function Tests 
Clinical chemistry included sodium, magnesium, potassium, calcium, glucose, chloride, bicarbonate, 
phosphorus-inorganic, total  protein, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP), blood urea nitrogen  (BUN), uric acid, creatinine, and estimated glomerular 
filtration  rate (eGFR; Schwartz formula). Clinical chemistry was assessed at baseline and at  every 4-
week clinical visits over 24 weeks treatment  in study AMB112529,  whereas they were assessed every 
3-month  throughout the  study and at the end of study visit in  study AMB114588. 
Liver function  tests (LFTs)  included ALT, AST, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and total bilirubin. 
Study AMB112529 
There were no clinically relevant changes in clinical chemistry parameters during the study.

There were no subjects with  values of potential clinical concern for ALT, AST, GGT, creatinine and all 
other protocol-specified clinical chemistry parameters. 
No subject had liver function  test values that  met protocol defined liver chemistry monitoring and 
stopping criteria. There was no liver event reported during the study. 
One subject (9-11  year group) in the low dose group had elevated total  bilirubin values at baseline and 
intermittent  elevations at  most post-baseline visits (ranged 30-46 µmol/L;  normal reference range 
[NR] =0-22  µmol/L). 
Extension study AMB114588 
Clinical Chemistry Values Over Time and Changes from Study AMB112529 Baseline 
The mean values, including  ALT, AST, GGT, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, BUN, creatinine, and eGFR 
observed for overall subjects were all within  the testing  laboratory's reference range throughout the 
extension study. 
In general, there was little change in mean clinical chemistry parameters over the course of the study, 
with  the exceptions of ALP and creatinine.  
Clinical Chemistry Abnormalities of Potential  Clinical Concern 
Clinical chemistry values of clinical concern at any post-baseline visit  included the following 
parameters: ALT ≥3X upper limit  of normal (ULN)  in 1 subject in the  5 mg dose group, AST ≥3X ULN 
in 1 subject in the 5  mg dose group, total bilirubin >34.2  µmol/L  in 3 subjects (1 each in the  2.5 mg, 5 
mg, and 10 mg groups). No subjects had a value of potential  clinical concern for these parameters at 
study AMB112529  baseline or at the entry to the extension study. 
There were no subjects with  values of potential clinical concern for creatinine and all other protocol-
specified clinical chemistry parameters. 
Liver Function  Laboratory Abnormalities Reported as AEs and AEs of Hepatobiliary Disorders 
Hepatic laboratory test  abnormalities (including  terms of ALT increased, AST increased, AST abnormal, 
blood bilirubin increased, and transaminases increased) were reported as AEs/SAEs in 3 subjects. 
A fourth subject had a severe AE of hepatomegaly with  a concurrent fatal SAE of cardiac failure acute. 
Both events were considered by the  investigator to  be unrelated to ambrisentan treatment. The event 
of cardiac failure acute was reported in the  study AMB112529 and continued in  the extension study. 
The subject subsequently died from the  ongoing SAE in the extension study.  
Liver Function  Laboratory Values of Potential  Clinical Concern 
Liver function  laboratory values of potential clinical concern at any post-baseline visits with  no 
associated AE reported were observed in 4 subjects: 3 had bilirubin values of PCC (2 had an abnormal 
bilirubin value at study AMB112529  baseline) and 1 had a GGT value of PCC  (also had GGT values 
outside reference range at AMB112529  baseline, at the entry visit to the extension study, and at most 
of post-baseline visits).  
Vital  signs, physical findings, and other observations related  to safety 
• 
Physical Examination Study AMB112529 
Overall, 89% of subjects (34/38)  had normal liver size on physical examination and 82%  of subjects 
(32/38)  had normal jugular venous pressure at the entry visit to the  extension study. One subject had 
peripheral oedema and 2 had ascites. The mean saturated oxygen value was 97%.

•  Vital Signs 
Study AMB112529 
Overall, there was a small mean/median decrease in heart rate observed at most visits beyond Week 2 
for both dose groups. At Week 24, the  mean/median decrease was 4.0/6.0  beats/min and was similar 
across dose groups. 
There were no other clinically relevant changes from baseline in vital signs and the proportion of 
subjects with vital sign values of potential  clinical concern was low and similar across the 2 dose 
groups. 
Extension study AMB114588 
Overall, an increase in systolic blood pressure from baseline in study AMB112529  was observed at all 
visits from Month  3,  with an end of study visit mean/median increase of 7.0/5.5 mmHg.  A progressive 
increase in mean/median height  and weight  from the  entry visit was also observed, which may reflect 
the paediatric population under study. There were no other clinically relevant or consistent  mean 
changes from baseline in vital signs. 
Few subjects had systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or heart rate value of clinical 
concern at any post-baseline visit (≤6  subjects for each measure). 
• 
Pubertal Development 
Pubertal development in male and female subjects was assessed using Tanner criteria [Marshall, 1969; 
Marshall, 1970;  Cameron, 2004]. In addition,  blood samples were obtained to measure follicle 
stimulating  hormone (FSH),  luteinizing  hormone (LH),  testosterone, sex hormone binding  globulin 
(SHBG) and inhibin B levels. 
Study AMB112529 
All enrolled subjects (27 female and 14 male) had pubertal assessments. 
Female Subjects: There was no clear pattern of change from baseline in endocrinology parameters at 
the post-baseline visits (Table 36).

Table 36 Endocrinology Data (Females  Only),  Study AMB112529  (Safety  Population) 
At baseline, 7  female subjects (58%)  in the low dose group were pre-adolescent with  regards to breast 
development compared with  4 subjects (27%) in the  high dose group. One subject (8%)  in the low 
dose group had pubic hair development of adult type compared with 4 subjects (40%)  in the high dose 
group. Pubertal development assessments remained similar at Week 24  other than 2 subjects (18%) in 
the low dose group had shifted status  from pre-adolescent to next stage breast development. 
Male Subjects: For 10 and 12 male subjects with  right and left testicular volume measurements, 
respectively, median volume was 6.5  ml (ranged 1 to 25  ml) at study AMB112529  baseline for both 
measures. Corresponding values at the entry visit to the extension study were 11.5  ml and 8.0 ml 
(ranged 1  to 25 ml for both) across 12 and 13 subjects, respectively. Overall, 38% of subjects (5/13) 
remained pre-adolescent at baseline and at entry visit with  regards to genital and pubic hair 
development. At the  end of study visit, median change in  right and left testicular volumes were 5.0 ml 
(ranged 0  to 20 ml) and 12.0 ml (ranged 0 to 20  ml), respectively, and 4 of the 5 subjects with  genital 
and pubic hair development assessments had progressed to the last  2 development stages. Overall, of 
the 3 male subjects with  pubertal change assessment at 20 years of age, all showed increased volume 
in both  right and left testicular volumes (range: 8 to 10 ml and 8 to 17  ml, respectively) and all had 
progressed to final maturity in genital/pubic hair development.

Overall: No clinically relevant change from baseline was observed at the end of study visit in 
female/male plasma endocrine parameters. 
Extension study AMB114588 
A total of 25 female subjects and 13 male subjects in the extension study had pubertal assessments at 
study AMB112529  baseline and at the entry visit to the extension study. A total of 10 subjects (7 
females and 3 males) had their 20-year old pubertal assessment. 
Female Subjects: There was no clear pattern of change from baseline in endocrinology parameters at 
the post-baseline visits (Table 37).

1. Subjects were considered as belonging to the treatment group according to highest dose received. 
2. Baseline was the last value recorded prior to start of study treatment from AMB112529. 
3. Entry Visit was at entry to the extension study. 
At the entry visit to the extension study, pubertal development assessments remained similar with 
some shift  within  lower dose groups to more mature development status. By the  end of study visit, all 
subjects had shifted status from pre-adolescent status to later development stages with the  exception 
of 2 subjects (1 each in the 2.5  mg and 5 mg dose groups) who remained as pre-adolescent status  for 
breast and pubic hair development. Of the 7 females who  returned for a pubertal assessment at 20 
years of age, all were assessed to meet the final 2 stages of breast and pubic hair development.

Male Subjects: Right and left testicular volume values at the entry visit to the extension study were 
11.5  ml and 8.0  ml (ranged 1 to 25  ml for both)  across 12 and 13 subjects, respectively. Overall, 38% 
of subjects (5/13)  remained pre-adolescent at baseline and at  entry visit with regards to genital and 
pubic hair development. At the end of study visit, median change in right  and left testicular volumes 
were 5.0  ml (ranged 0 to 20  ml) and 12.0 ml (ranged 0 to 20 ml), respectively, and 4 of the 5 subjects 
with  genital and pubic hair development assessments had progressed to the last  2 development 
stages. Overall, of the  3 male subjects with  pubertal change assessment at 20 years of age, all showed 
increased volume in both  right and left testicular volumes (range: 8 to 10 ml and 8 to  17 ml, 
respectively) and all had progressed to final maturity in genital/pubic  hair development. 
Overall: No clinically relevant change from baseline was observed at the end of study visit in 
female/male plasma endocrine parameters. 
•  12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) 
The results of a 12-lead ECG were categorized as normal, abnormal not  clinically significant,  or 
abnormal clinically significant in the  medical and scientific judgement of the  investigator for both 
studies. No details on ECG findings are available. 
Study AMB112529 
ECGs were performed at baseline and at Weeks 12 and 24 (or early withdrawal),  and at  the follow-up 
visit. 
The majority of subjects in  both dose groups had abnormal but  not clinically significant  ECG findings  at 
baseline and at post-baseline visits.  
Mild  AEs of bundle branch block right and tachycardia (1  subject each) were reported during  the study. 
Both events were resolved within 2  days and none were considered by the investigator to be related to 
ambrisentan treatment. No QT prolongation-related AE was reported during the study. 
Extension study AMB114588 
The majority of subjects had abnormal but not clinically significant ECG findings at study AMB112529 
baseline, at  entry visit to the  extension study, and at post-baseline visits (71%, 76%,  and 79% of 
subjects, respectively).  A total  of 6 subjects had a clinically significant  abnormal ECG at any post-
baseline visit. Of these, 1 subject had clinically significant  ECGs at Week 12 visit and at early 
withdrawal visit in  study AMB112529,  and at  entry visit to the  extension study.  
Three subjects had SAEs of atrioventricular block complete, atrioventricular block first degree, and 
supraventricular tachycardia during the study. All events were resolved. The event of atrioventricular 
block complete led to ambrisentan treatment  temporarily interrupted. None of SAEs were considered 
by the investigator to be related to ambrisentan treatment. No QT prolongation-related AE was 
reported during the  study. 
• 
Echocardiogram 
In both studies, data from ECHO examinations were collected to ensure full safety assessment of a 
subject in the case when PAH had deteriorated. It  was also regarded as an exploratory efficacy 
endpoint to evaluate if potential prognostic factors could be identified as associated with clinical 
worsening of PAH. 
Study AMB112529 
In brief, the  majority of subjects in  both dose groups had no pericardial effusion at baseline (81%  in 
the low dose group and 79%  in the high dose group) and remained in the  same status at Week 24. 
Mean baseline values of right  atrial pressure, tricuspid  annular plane systolic excursion, eccentricity 
index systolic, eccentricity index diastolic, and tricuspid regurgitant  jet velocity were comparable 
between dose groups.  
With  the exception of mean right  ventricular pressure, no or small mean changes from baseline to 
Week 24 in  all ECHO  parameters. A mean decrease in right  ventricular pressure was observed at Week

12 in the  high dose group (-0.3  mmHg) and at Week 24 in  both dose groups (-1.9 mmHg  in the low 
dose group and -4.5 mmHg  in the high dose group. 
Extension study AMB114588 
Overall, 84% of subjects (31/37)  who were entered into the extension study had no pericardial 
infusion at baseline in study AMB112529  and the  incidence was similar across the  ambrisentan dose 
groups. 
At the Entry Visit to  the extension study, 31/36  subjects (86%) had no change in pericardial effusion 
with  3 subjects showing an improvement (1 subject each in the  2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg groups) and 
2 subjects showing a worsening (1  subject each in the 2.5  mg and 7.5  mg groups). 
At the End of Study Visit, 21/24  subjects (88%) had no change in  pericardial effusion with  3 subjects 
(2 in the  2.5 mg group and 1  in the 5 mg group) showing an improvement. 
Among the 13 subjects who had 1 or more ECHO report of pericardial effusion either in  Study 
AMB112529,  the extension study, or both,  the majority of readings were of effusions that were trace or 
small, and the majority of fluctuations  were between absent and trace or small. Three subjects had 
reports of a moderate effusion (including 1 reported at  AMB112529 baseline with fluctuation  noted 
throughout  their participation in the studies).  No subject had a reading of a large pericardial effusion; 
there were no AE reports of cardiac tamponade and only 1 AE of worsening pericardial effusion. All 3 
subjects with reports of a moderate pericardial effusion died. One subject who died in study 
AMB112529  of pneumonia after 138 days had a trace effusion at baseline reported as moderate at 
Week 12. The other 2 subjects (including the  1 whose moderate effusion was present at  baseline) died 
in the extension study from events consistent with  PAH worsening. Therefore, a moderate effusion 
might  be considered a negative prognostic indicator in this  population. 
At the end of study, with  the exception of right ventricular pressure, mean changes from baseline in  all 
parameters were variable without  apparent dose relationship. With  the exception of the 5 mg dose 
group, a mean reduction in right ventricular pressure was observed across all dose groups. 
Safety  in special populations 
Elderly  
There were no reports of adults (including elderly) during the ambrisentan paediatric studies 
AMB112529  and AMB114588.  
Pregnancy  and Lactation  
Ambrisentan is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Treatment must not  be initiated 
when planning to  become pregnant.  
No pregnancies were reported during these studies AMB112529 and AMB114588.   
Immunological events 
Not  applicable. 
Safety  related  to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug interaction  studies have been conducted with  ambrisentan in paediatric PAH subjects.  
Discontinuation due to AES 
Study AMB112529 
The reason for withdrawal  this study was due to an AE in 2 of a total  of 4  patients.

One subject was withdrawn  from the  study due to  a fatal event of pneumonia. 
In addition, 1 subject had an early withdrawal visit due to an SAE of cardiac failure acute after had 
been enrolled in the extension study. The subject subsequently died from the ongoing SAE in the 
extension study. 
No treatment-emergent AEs led to  drug interruption  or dose reduction. 
Extension study AMB114588 
The reason for withdrawal  this interim analysis was mainly due to investigator discretion (including  5 
deaths). These 5 subjects were recorded as withdrawn due to an SAE (cardiac failure acute [2 
subjects]) and acute right ventricular failure (1), failure to thrive (1), and pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (1).  All 5 events led to a fatal outcome and none were considered by the investigator to 
be related to ambrisentan.  
AEs/SAEs led to an interruption in  ambrisentan treatment in  1 subject with  4 events in the 2.5 mg 
dose group. A drug-related AE of deafness (moderate in intensity)  also led to a temporary interruption 
in ambrisentan treatment. 
A dose of ambrisentan was reduced in 2 subjects due to their AEs: an AE of fatigue and a drug-related 
AE of erythema in 1 subject in the 7.5 mg dose group and a drug-related AE of swelling face in 1 
subject in the 10 mg dose group. 
Post marketing experience 
Ambrisentan was first approved in the US on 15 June 2007  under the trade name Letairis and is 
currently approved in all European Economic Area countries, and Japan as well as over 20 further 
countries under the  trade name Volibris. GSK submitted  an initial MAA EMEA/H/C/000839  under Article 
8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC  as a full  dossier in adults for the treatment of indication treatment of PAH. 
The application was approved in the  EU on 21 April 2008. 
Volibris is indicated for treatment of PAH in adult patients  of WHO  Functional  Class II to  III, including 
use in combination treatment. 
Routine Pharmacovigilance 
Reports of the use of ambrisentan outside of this indication or in  non-approved populations (including 
paediatric use) are maintained in  the global safety database by Gilead and are reported in Periodic 
Benefit Risk Evaluation Reports (PBRERs) periodically as agreed with  central and local regulatory 
agencies. The last PBRER submitted  to EMA was in 2017;  following assessment the EMA recommended 
that  ambrisentan should be moved to a 3 yearly cycle and therefore the next EU PBRER will  be 
submitted  in 2020. There have been 2 yearly PBRERs created in 2018  and 2019 for local regulatory 
submission. The off-label use in children and adolescents detailed in the  most recent two  non-EU 
PBRERs is summarized below: 
•  Non-EU  PBRER Reporting Period from 15  June 2017 to 14  June 2018 
From the global safety database (5,640  cases), a total  of 159  spontaneous or solicited (non-
clinical) cases have reported the  use of ambrisentan in patients younger than  18 years were 
analysed. The majority of the 159 cases were reported in patients  at or over the age of 2 years. 
Specifically, there were 100 reports (63%) for children aged 2 to under 12 years, and 51 reports 
(32%)  in adolescents (12 to  18 years). For the 94 cases for which an indication for use was 
provided, all were pulmonary hypertension or other cardiac disorder. 
During the reporting period a total of 191 serious events and 71 non-serious events were 
received. The most common SAE was pneumonia (n=11),  followed by cardiac failure (n=8).  The 
most common non-serious events were off label use (27) and drug administered to patient  of 
inappropriate age (24). Fourteen cases reported a fatal outcome involving 8 females and 6 
males, ages 32 months to 17  years. The indication  for treatment was unknown (n=6),  PAH

(n=3),  essential hypertension (n=1), pulmonary hypertension (PH)  with sickle cell disease 
(n=1),  PAH with connective tissue disorder and congenital heart disease (n=1),  PAH with 
congenital heart disease (n=1) and PAH with  respiratory failure (n=1).  The causes of death were 
reported in 4  cases as follows: 1) congestive cardiac failure in a 8-11  year old patient  with a 
history of neuroblastoma, approximately 28 days after initiation  of ambrisentan; 2) cardiac 
failure secondary to pulmonary artery dissection in  an 12  to <18 years -old year old patient with 
PH 2 days after initiation  of ambrisentan; 3) right heart failure in  a 12  to <18 years year old 
patient with  worsening of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and history of sickle cell disease 
and 4) respiratory/cardiac failure in a 12  to <18 years year-old patient who  received 
ambrisentan treatment for PAH. Cause of death was not provided in  10 cases. 
•  Non-EU  PBRER Reporting Period from 15  June 2018 to 14  June 2019 
From the global safety database (5,640  cases), a total  of 192  spontaneous or solicited (non-
clinical study) cases reporting use of ambrisentan in patients younger than  18 years were 
received. The majority of the  192 cases were reported in patients at or over the age of 2 years. 
Specifically, there were 126 reports (66%) for children aged 2 to under 12 years, and 59 reports 
(31%)  in adolescents (12 to  18 years). For the 110 cases for which an indication for use was 
provided, all were pulmonary hypertension or other cardiac disorder. 
A total of 244 serious events and 71 non-serious events were received. The most  common SAEs 
reported were death (n=12) and pneumonia (n=11).  The most common non-serious events were 
off label use (n=31)  and product use issue (n=21). 
Eighteen cases overall reported a fatal outcome including 7 females and 11 males, ages 34 
months to 16  years. The indication  for treatment was unknown (n=9),  PAH (n=4),  PH group 1, 3 
(n=1),  pulmonary hypertension (n=3),  cor pulmonale chronic (n=1).  The cause of death was 
reported in 6  cases as follows: Cardiac arrest in  2 male patients (young child and adolescent) 
receiving ambrisentan for PAH; suspected worsening of pulmonary hypertensive disease in an 8-
11 year old male receiving ambrisentan for pulmonary hypertension; complications of respiratory 
syncytial virus in a 5-7  year old male who received ambrisentan for an unknown indication; and 
end-stage cardiopulmonary disease in a 8-11  year old female who  received ambrisentan for PH 
group 1, 3. Cause of death was not provided in 12  cases. 
The conclusion from review of these off-label use reports, was that  no new safety issues associated 
with  ambrisentan in  paediatric population had been identified. 
To further investigate off label use in paediatric patients, cumulative data from the International birth 
date (IBD) to 14  June 2019 was obtained from Gilead. Gilead’s ARGUS, the Pharmacovigilance and 
Epidemiology (PVE) safety database was searched for all cases reported up to 14 June 2019  where 
ambrisentan had been administered to  a child aged 8 to less than 18 years. Since ambrisentan is not 
indicated for use in children and adolescents, all of the cases were considered off label use.  
A total of 1,934  cases, where patients aged 8 to less than 18 years old have received ambrisentan, 
have been reported to Gilead since launch until  14 June 2019.  These cases have reported a total  of 
5,279  events, with  some cases reporting more than  one event. 
Figure 12 shows the total  number of adverse events by SOC since launch in the 8 to less than 18  years 
population, with  the injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOC receiving the majority of AEs. 
This is expected as the  adverse event of “off label use” is included in this SOC (1,348 cases) and 
although ambrisentan is not licensed for paediatric population, it is recognised that  this product is 
given off label.

Page 84/107 
 
 
 
 
With  the exception of off label use, the general distribution  of events by SOC is similar to the safety 
profile seen in adult patients  with the  most frequently reported AEs being in the context of either listed 
adverse reactions noted in the SmPC for the adult  population or by the underlying disease for which 
the patient  was receiving ambrisentan. There were also a number of events reported that  were not 
related to  use of ambrisentan, for example injection/infusion/application  site or device related 
conditions, as ambrisentan is given orally. 
The most commonly reported adverse events, after off label use, were headache (194),  dyspnoea 
(111),  vomiting (86) and diarrhoea (85) all of which are listed in the EU SmPC with a frequency of very 
common or common. Other frequently reported adverse events included nasal congestion, 
nasopharyngitis, sinusitis and fatigue, all of which are also listed events for ambrisentan and have a 
frequency of very common or common. Table 38  summarises the 10 most frequently reported adverse 
events in  the 8 to less than 18 years old population. 
Table 38 The Most Frequently  Reported AEs in Paediatric  Patients  (Aged 8 to <18 Years) 
It is noted that  a number of events of pneumonia (76) have been reported in the 8  to less than  18 
years population. As this population has a higher incidence of infections and this, based on a 
background of their underlying condition which makes the patient  more susceptible to pneumonia, is 
thought  to be the reason for this reporting. Cases of pneumonia have been documented in previous 
Assessment report

safety update reports for ambrisentan, in the adult  registration studies and in  the clinical studies in 
paediatric patients. 
Review of the paediatric data in  patients aged 8  to less than  18 years shows a similar safety profile to 
that  of the  adult population with  the adverse reactions reported being consistent with  those seen in 
adults, with  headache occurring most frequently. No new patterns or trends were seen, and no new 
safety information has been highlighted  from this review. 
Sub-Set of Congenital Heart Disease 
A sub-set of cases from the 8 to less than 18  years old population was retrieved, in which  the patients 
had either received ambrisentan for a congenital heart related anomaly, or where the  patient reported 
a current or past medical history of congenital heart anomaly. The safety profile of this  sub-set was 
then compared to the  cumulative paediatric data in patients aged 8 to less than  18 years old. 
A total of 261 cases were retrieved that reported 893  events. The spread of these events by SOC is 
shown in Figure 13. 
Figure 13 Cumulative  Number of AEs by SOC  in Paediatric Patients  (Aged 8 to <18 Years) 
Treated  with Ambrisentan for Congenital Heart  Anomaly (up to 14 June 2019) 
The distribution  of cases by SOC for this sub-set of cases is comparable to that  of the  paediatric 
population as a whole. It is noted that the proportion of events in  the cardiac SOC is higher than in the 
overall population, but  this is expected from a sub-set which  is specifically highlighting  cases with  a 
focus on congenital heart anomalies. 
The most commonly reported adverse events after off label use (179 cases), were headache (32) and 
dyspnoea (16), again, both  of which  are listed events in  the Product Information for ambrisentan. The 
most frequently reported AEs were in the context of either listed adverse reactions noted in the SmPC 
for the adult population or by the underlying disease for which the patient  was receiving ambrisentan.  
Table 39  tabulates the cumulative number of serious and non-serious events by SOC up to 14  June 
2019  in patients aged 8 to less than  18 years treated with  ambrisentan for or with  history of congenital 
heart anomaly. The majority of events were considered non-serious in nature.

Table 39  Cumulative Number of AEs by SOC in Paediatric Patients (Aged 8 to <18 Years) in the Sub-
Set of Cases (up to 14 June 2019) 
The numbers and types of events reported in this  subset were generally proportional to  that of the 8 to 
less than  18 years age group and therefore, similar to  the known adult safety profile. 
Review of Off Label Data  and Increasing Use Over Time 
Off label use in this  population has increased year on year since June 2007, as demonstrated in  Table 
40.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database supporting this  application is composed by only 41 children included in study 
AMB112529  and 38 children included in its extension study AMB11458. Despite the safety profile 
seems similar to that  reported in adults in qualitative terms (i.e.: headache, gastrointestinal  adverse 
events, oedema, etc.), the small safety database and the absence of a comparator group does not 
allow for a precise estimate of adverse events in children. In addition,  the number of children and 
adolescents in other conditions apart from IPAH was very scarce to draw any meaningful conclusion: 8 
patients with  persistent PAH despite surgical repair, 4 patients in connective PAH and 2 patients  with 
familial PAH. In line with  the objection raised for efficacy, the applicant was requested to conduct  a 
systematic bibliographic search and to discuss published studies with  ambrisentan in paediatric 
population, as well as to compare these results to those obtained in the  study AMB112529 and its 
extension, in terms of adverse events.  
The applicant commented on the difficulties  encountered with  the clinical studies enrolment that leads 
the submission of a limited  safety database (41  children included in study  AMB112529 and 38 children 
included in its extension study AMB11458)  to support this application. The Applicant has also provided 
a more detailed adverse events evidence by including a nominally off-label dataset of children and 
adolescents in the  age range of 8 to <18  years receiving ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH. This 
Assessment report

dataset was composed by data obtained from the paediatric subgroup (119 patients)  of an unpublished 
Japan Post Marketing Surveillance study (Study 114782)  as well as reports of off-label use of 
ambrisentan in this population from the Global Safety Database between 15  June 2018 and 14 June 
2019  period. Paediatric patients  included in submitted dataset were comparable to those included in 
the study AMB112529  and its extension AMB114588. Moreover, it  seems acceptable to inform on the 
qualitative similarity of the adult and paediatric safety profile. It is considered that  broadening the 
safety database submitted in the application has improved the safety paediatric profile of this  product, 
despite it does not allow for a precise estimate of adverse events in paediatric population.   The 
company also presented safety paediatric data including different PAH aetiologies retrieved from 
divergent sources after a systematic bibliographic search, which  appeared to be comparable to those 
seen in  performed clinical trials. Based on them no observation of new safety risks associated with 
ambrisentan administration was made. Similarly, no divergency in the safety profile compared to the 
adult population  was seen. Despite of the observed limitations it  can be concluded that the 
summarized outcomes obtained from several sources do not  show any differences across aetiology 
subgroups.  
In study AMB112429  all patients  received a fixed dose of 5  mg during  the first week of treatment in 
study AMB112529.  At week 2 onwards, the ambrisentan low dose (n=21)  was defined as 5 mg for 
patients of ≥35  kg, and 2.5 mg for children between ≥20  kg and <35  Kg. The ambrisentan high dose 
(n=20)  was defined as 10 mg in patients ≥50  kg, 7.5 mg in patients between ≥35  kg and <50  Kg, and 
5 mg in patients  between ≥20  kg and <35  Kg. In extension study AMB11458,  patients received 
ambrisentan at the dose of 2.5 mg (n=4),  5 mg (n=16),  7.5 mg (n=6)  or 10  mg (n=12).  
Cumulative exposure to ambrisentan in study AMB112529  and the extension study ranged from 14.3 
to 335.1  weeks, with  a median duration of 176.6  weeks. More than half of the subjects received 
ambrisentan treatment for at  least 3 years and the longest cumulative duration of treatment was 
greater than  6.6 years.  
The majority of subjects used a background PAH medication(s) in both studies, mainly a PDE-5 
inhibitor  as monotherapy or in combination with  a prostanoid. Adverse events by concomitant 
medications should be provided. The applicant provided adverse events data (Treatment-Emergent 
Adverse Events, Serious Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Non-Serious Treatment-Emergent 
Adverse Events and Common[>=5%] Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events) by concomitant PAH 
therapy (None,  Any, PDE-5 inhibitor Only, Prostanoid Only and Both PDE5i and prostanoid) during 
study AMB112529.  As concluded by the applicant, there appears to be a trend where subjects taking 1 
or more PAH concomitant medication experience more non-serious events compared with  those taking 
no other medication to treat PAH, but this  trend is not seen when reviewing the serious adverse event 
data.  
The majority of subjects in  both studies reported at least 1 treatment-emergent AE and the majority 
were mild or moderate in intensity.  The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AE was 
headache in study AMB112529  and upper respiratory tract infection in  the extension study. The most 
common drug-related AE was headache for both studies. Other ambrisentan-related TEAEs included 
anaemia and gastroenteritis. Details about  two cases of unlisted gastroenteritis (drug-related) cases 
were provided. In both  cases the confounding factor as concomitant medication may have contributed 
to the events. Therefore, no new safety concern was identified. 
A total of 7 deaths were reported, 1 was in  study AMB112529 due to an SAE of pneumonia and 6 were 
in the extension study. These 6 deaths were considered related to the subjects’ underlying PAH 
condition, with  a mean time  to death of more than 3 years from treatment  initiation.  SAEs were 
reported in 8  subjects (20%)  with  9 events in study AMB112529  and none of SAEs occurred in more 
than 1 subject. With  the exception of the  fatal event of pneumonia, all events were resolved, and all 
subjects continued ambrisentan treatment.  With  the exception of general physical health  deterioration, 
none of these SAEs were considered by the  investigator to  be related to ambrisentan treatment  and 
occurred only in one patient.  In the extension study,  38 SAEs were reported in 21 subjects (55%). 
SAEs which  occurred in more than 2 subjects each were: PAH (3), anaemia, cardiac failure acute, and 
pneumonia (2 each). Two SAEs (cardiac failure acute and failure to  thrive) which led to discontinuation

of ambrisentan treatment.  Three SAEs (ALT increased, atrioventricular block complete, and 
hypotension) in 1 subject led to ambrisentan treatment  being temporarily interrupted. None of SAEs 
were considered by the investigator to be related to ambrisentan treatment. 
AESIs were reported in 9 subjects (with  11 events) in study AMB112529.  With  the exceptions of 
anaemia and hypotension (1 each), all events were related to oedema. Six AESIs were considered by 
the investigator to be related to ambrisentan treatment: oedema peripheral (2),  face oedema (2), 
angioedema (1), and hypotension (1). No AESIs led to permanent discontinuation  of ambrisentan 
treatment or withdrawal from the study. In the extension study, AESIs were reported in  20 subjects 
(53%).  Anaemia was the  most frequently reported AESI, 11 events in  6 subjects. Oedema-related 
events were reported in 6 subjects with  8 events. Five events of liver laboratory abnormalities were 
reported as AEs in  2 subjects. SAEs were reported as follows: anaemia (2), ALT increased, and 
hypotension (1 each). The events were considered by the investigator to be related to ambrisentan 
treatment as follows: anaemia (3), angioedema, swelling face, AST increased, blood bilirubin 
increased, syncope, and presyncope (1 each). No AESIs led to permanent discontinuation  of 
ambrisentan treatment or withdrawal  from the  study. The Applicant proposes to add a new paragraph 
to section 4.8 dealing with  paediatric safety profile. Although  reported AEs are mostly in  line with the 
known ambrisentan safety profile, the Rapporteurs are on the opinion of adjusting the currently 
suggested wording in order to specifically reflect the results (drug-related events) reported in two 
submitted  clinical studies.  Moreover, although the currently approved SmPC includes a warning on the 
fluid retention events in section 4.4 and corresponding PTs are listed in the Section 4.8, information on 
higher occurrence of fluid retention  events also in  paediatric population should be supplemented to the 
SmPC as regards of several other individual cases reported in both  submitted studies. The Applicant 
has updated the paragraph related to  the available safety data collected from clinical studies enrolling 
paediatric population.  Regarding to the events related to  the fluid retention, the Applicant specifically 
elaborated on all events reported in  paediatric and adult patients.  The consistency in the overall 
incidence and severity of the cases comparing both populations is claimed, which  is agreed. The 
updated paragraph in Section 4.8 does not contain any information on this  matter as only two events 
of peripheral oedema attributed to  the study treatment were seen within  paediatric development. The 
previously listed information in Section 4.4 corresponds with the  provided paediatric data and thus can 
be considered sufficient.  
Details about unlisted non-serious eosinophilia and lymphopenia (drug-related) cases were provided. 
In both cases the confounding factors including underlying conditions and concomitant medications 
may have contributed to the events. Therefore, no new safety concern was identified. No other 
laboratory abnormalities coded as ambrisentan-related AEs were reported by the Investigator and no 
PCC has been identified in the study AMB114588. 
Adverse events were analysed by age stratum.  In Study AMB112529,  a total of 14 subjects aged 8-11 
years (7 in each dose group) and 27 subjects aged 12 to <18  years (14 in the low dose group and 13 
in the high  dose group) were enrolled. In the  extension study AMB114588  a total of 14 subjects aged 
8-11  years and 24 subjects aged 12  to <18 years were enrolled. Numbers of subjects in each dose 
group in the 8-11  years age stratum in the Safety Population were 4, 7, and 3 in the  2.5 mg, 5 mg, 
and 10 mg groups, respectively. Adverse event profile was consistent  by age stratum.  
There was a lack of dose-response regarding adverse events, with more adverse events reported with 
the ambrisentan low dose. The applicant attempted to  analyse different causes that  could lead to  the 
observed lack of dose-response regarding adverse events in study AMB112529,  with  more adverse 
events reported with the  ambrisentan low dose. As stated by the Applicant, it  is considered that there 
is no pattern or trend in adverse event reporting between dose groups, being the differences seen 
between the two dose groups probably to due to variability in such a small size population. 
In line with  expected pubertal development in this population,  no clinically relevant change in male 
testicular volume from baseline was observed in both studies. No clinically relevant change in 
female/male endocrinology or plasma endocrine parameters were seen for both studies. 
There were no liver events reported during  the study AMB112529.  One liver event, both  ALT and AST 
≥3X ULN,  was reported in the extension study. No QT prolongation-related AE, as well as AEs of 
ventricular arrhythmias, were reported during both  studies although there was 1 report of QT

prolongation in association with  an event of atrioventricular block first degree that  resolved with 
continued treatment  and was not considered related to ambrisentan treatment. A small mean 
reduction from baseline in haemoglobin, haematocrit, and platelet count was observed in both study 
AMB112529  and the extension study. Small mean increases in creatinine were observed at entry to the 
extension study,  which continued to be observed to a larger magnitude at subsequent visits. 
Corresponding small mean decreases in eGFR were observed at the end of study visit with  no 
remarkable changes in other kidney function parameters. No clinical relevance is attributed  to this 
finding. 
The company has also provided data of off-label use in paediatric patients  using the Gilead’s ARGUS 
[the Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology (PVE) safety database of Gilead]. A total of 1,934  cases, 
where patients  aged 8 to  less than 18  years old have received ambrisentan, have been reported to 
Gilead since launch until  14 June 2019.  These cases have reported a total  of 5,279  events, with  some 
cases reporting more than one event. The most commonly reported adverse events, after off label use, 
were headache (194),  dyspnoea (111),  vomiting (86) and diarrhoea (85) all of which are listed in the 
EU SmPC with a frequency of very common or common. It is noted that  a number of events of 
pneumonia (76 cases) have been reported in the 8  to less than  18 years population. As this  population 
has a higher incidence of infections and this,  based on a background of their underlying condition 
which makes the patient  more susceptible to pneumonia, is thought  to be the reason for this  reporting. 
Cases of pneumonia have been documented in previous safety update reports for ambrisentan, in the 
adult registration studies and in the clinical studies in  paediatric patients. The applicant was requested 
to discuss whether children and adolescents may be at a particular higher risk of pneumonia than 
adults and to propose strategies to minimise that  risk if appropriate. The Applicant provided a review 
of pneumonia in  paediatric patients aged 8 to less than 18 years receiving ambrisentan for the 
treatment of PAH. Safety data were obtained from clinical trials (AMB112529  and AMB114588,  and 
Japan Post-marketing surveillance study [Study 114782])  as well as reports of off-label use in 
paediatric patients  from the  Global Safety Database. Evidence reviewed does not  support a causal 
relationship between pneumonia in children aged 8 to less than  18 years and ambrisentan, exhibiting  a 
relationship predominantly associated with  the patients’  underlying conditions. A comparison of the risk 
of pneumonia in  adults and children, considering both a safety review of pneumonia in adult clinical 
trials and post-marketing data in  the overall population (paediatric and adult),  was also provided by 
the Applicant. On review of the data, there is no evidence to support a causal association between 
pneumonia and the  use of ambrisentan in either paediatric or adult patients and cases of pneumonia 
do not appear to be more prevalent in  children compared to adults.  Therefore, there is no need for 
inclusion of a warning in the product information or other risk minimisation measures. Other frequently 
reported adverse events included nasal congestion, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis  and fatigue, all of which 
are also listed events for ambrisentan and have a frequency of very common or common. The different 
data source used and time of assessment for events rates of headache and nasal congestion was 
specified in section 4.8  of the  SmPC. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety database supporting this  application is composed by 41  children included in  study 
AMB112529  and 38 children included in its extension study AMB11458. Cumulative exposure to 
ambrisentan in Study AMB112529 and the extension study ranged from 14.3 to 335.1  weeks, with  a 
median duration of 176.6  weeks. More than half of the subjects received ambrisentan treatment for at 
least 3 years and the  longest cumulative duration  of treatment  was greater than  6.6 years. 
The safety profile of ambrisentan in the 41 children aged 8 to less than  18 years included in study 
AMB112529  and 38 children included in its extension study AMB11458 is consistent with  adults from 
the Phase III PAH studies submitted  with  the initial  MAA. However, the small safety database and the 
absence of a comparator group does not  allow for a precise estimate of adverse events in children. No 
new clinically relevant safety concerns were identified including from physical examination and pubertal 
development assessments in paediatric subjects from 8 to less than 18 years of age following 
administration of ambrisentan oral doses adjusted for body weight.

The majority of subjects used a background PAH medication(s) in both studies, mainly a PDE-5 
inhibitor  as monotherapy or in combination with  a prostanoid. Adverse events did not  show a different 
pattern depending on the use of concomitant  medications.  
The number of children in other conditions apart from IPAH in the pivotal trial was very scarce to draw 
any meaningful conclusion: 8 children with  persistent PAH despite surgical repair, 4 children in 
connective PAH and 2 children with  familial PAH. The applicant was requested to conduct  a systematic 
bibliographic search and to discuss published studies with  ambrisentan in children, as well as to 
compare these results to  those obtained in  the study AMB112529  and its  extension, in  terms of 
adverse events. The additional paediatric safety data including  different PAH aetiologies retrieved from 
divergent sources appeared to be comparable to those seen in performed clinical trials. Based on them 
no observation of new safety risks associated with  ambrisentan administration was made. Similarly, no 
divergency in the safety profile compared to the adult population  was seen. Despite of the observed 
limitations  it can be concluded that  the summarized outcomes obtained from several sources do not 
show any differences across aetiology subgroups.  
There was a lack of dose-response regarding adverse events, with more adverse events reported with 
the ambrisentan low dose. The applicant attempted to  analyse different causes that  could lead to  the 
observed lack of dose-response regarding adverse events in study AMB112529,  with  more adverse 
events reported with the  ambrisentan low dose. As stated by the Applicant, it  is considered that there 
is no pattern or trend in adverse event reporting between dose groups, being the differences seen 
between the two dose groups probably to due to variability in such a small size population. 
The number of cases of off-label use reported in children from Gilead's ARGUS database (n=1,934 
cases) is much higher than the number of children included in  the pivotal study AMB112529 (n=41). 
The applicant states that the  review of the off-label paediatric data in children aged 8 to less than 18 
years shows a similar safety profile to that  of the adult  population with  the adverse reactions reported 
being consistent with  those seen in adults,  with headache, dyspnoea, vomiting and diarrhoea occurring 
most frequently. While, qualitatively, the adverse events reported in off-label use in children are within 
expected for adults, no conclusions can be made with  respect to compare incidence rates versus 
adults. The 76 pneumonia cases reported in off-label use were further discussed by the applicant and 
no particular concerns are raised in children.  
In the context of the rare nature of pulmonary arterial hypertension, review of the clinical trial data in 
children along with  the  off label use data in  this population, the additional  data provided from the 
paediatric subgroup of the Japanese PMS study and the extensive post-marketing safety database in 
adults, it  is reasonable to conclude that  the safety profile in children is similar and consistent with  that 
seen in  the adult population.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive, highly debilitating  disease characterised 
by vascular obstruction and the variable presence of vasoconstriction, leading to  increased pulmonary 
vascular resistance (PVR) and right-sided heart failure [Moledina, 2010;  Newman, 2004].  If left 
untreated, PAH ultimately leads to right ventricular failure and death [Krum, 2000].  
Paediatric PAH is a rare and complex condition associated with  diverse cardiac, pulmonary, and 
systemic diseases, with  significant morbidity and mortality. It shares some similarities with  adult PAH, 
but  there are important  known differences in vascular function, foetal origins of disease, growth  and 
development, genetics, natural history, underlying disease, responses of the right  ventricle, 
responsiveness to PAH-specific therapies, and gaps in knowledge, particularly in the youngest age 
groups [Abman et al. Circulation. 2015;  132: 2037–99]. 
Because of the  limitations in conducting  paediatric studies, therapeutic strategies used for adult  PAH 
have not  been studied sufficiently in children to allow the definition  of potential  toxicities or optimal 
dosing. Hence, the lack of randomized clinical trials in paediatrics makes it difficult to  deliver strong 
guidelines [Ollivier et al. J Am Heart Assoc. 2019;  8: e01130].  
Common hurdles for testing PAH therapies in children include:  a) the  rarity of the paediatric PAH; b) 
the many associated conditions that  fragment the  classification of paediatric PAH (e.g., idiopathic PAH 
[IPAH], familial PAH, corrected congenital PAH, PAH associated with  connective tissue disease, 
pulmonary hypertension of the  newborn [PPHN])  which leaves only a relatively small number of 
patients with  PAH at each center; c) competing number of medicinal products for such a small 
population; d) The lack of suitable clinical end points in children: the 6-Minute  Walking Distance 
(6MWD)  Test cannot  be used in all paediatric age subsets (ie.: not reliable in children <7 years), while 
there is a lack of consensus about the use of right  sided heart catheterization to obtain  hemodynamic 
end points in paediatric clinical trials [Ollivier et al, 2019]. 
This situation  has resulted in a lack of equipoise after marketing authorization  for new investigational 
drugs in adults, making it even more difficult to enroll children, and contributes to off-label use, which 
can increase the risk of inadequate dosing and results in lack of paediatric safety data. The main points 
of tension are related to finding the adequate balance between early access and sufficient  exposure of 
children during paediatric trials for safety and adequate dosing. Methodological tools,  such as 
extrapolation, could optimize obtaining  information about children involved in clinical studies by 
predicting how a medicine may work in children and adolescents on the basis of studies conducted in 
adults [Ollivier et al, 2019], but  dedicated studies in  children are needed.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Detailed, consensus, evidence-based guidelines for the  treatment of PAH have been published [Galiè, 
2015].  Because the underlying pathophysiology of PAH in children and adolescents is generally similar 
to that  in adults, treatment  guidelines for PAH in the paediatric population are similar to those in 
adults, although  the majority of treatments are currently not approved for use in children and 
adolescents, and the level of evidence supporting the available treatments in  the paediatric population 
is limited.   
Treatment approaches are divided into  those regarded as supportive or background treatment (aimed 
at alleviating vasoconstriction, breathlessness, and thromboembolic complications) and those (such as 
endothelial receptor antagonists [ERAs]) that  target the underlying pathophysiology.  
Supportive/background treatments 
It is recommended that patients  who show vasoreactivity (pulmonary vascular response to acute 
vasodilator challenge) are given a calcium channel blocker (CCB), however the majority of patients  do 
not demonstrate significant vasoreactivity and in those that do the impact of this  therapy is modest 
[Sitbon, 2005].  A small proportion of children who are ‘responders’ to acute vasodilator testing can be 
managed satisfactorily with oral CCB therapy although like adults, the great majority of children are 
non-responders. Oxygen relieves breathlessness in those who are hypoxic but does not affect the 
underlying pathophysiological processes. For patients with  more severe disease, digoxin and other 
positive inotropes are sometimes used for the amelioration of symptoms. Oedema resulting from 
progressive right ventricular dysfunction is treated with  diuretics. Anticoagulants are an important 
adjunctive therapy in some patients  (especially those with IPAH), but  do not affect the  vasoconstrictive 
and remodelling aspects of the  disease. 
Targeted therapies 
Three signalling pathways (nitric  oxide, prostacyclin-thromboxane and endothelin-1)  involved in the 
pathogenesis of PAH have been targeted for therapeutic intervention by the following classes of PAH 
medicines [Humbert,  2004;  Frank, 2018]: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
prostanoids: FLOLAN  (epoprostenol), Ventavis (iloprost), beraprost, and Remodulin 
(treprostinil);   
phosphodiesterase type 5  (PDE-5) inhibitors: Revatio [Europe (EU)]/Viagra (sildenafil), Adcirca 
(tadalafil);  
soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators: Adempas (riociguat); and  
ERAs: VOLIBRIS [EU]/Letaris [United States of America (US)] (ambrisentan), Tracleer 
(bosentan), and Opsumit (macitentan).    
Only bosentan (Food  and Drug Administration [FDA] and European Medicine Agency [EMA])  and 
sildenafil (EMA) have been approved for use in paediatric subjects [Farhat,  2019]. However, there are 
challenges to their  successful use in  a paediatric population. Bosentan is subject to  clinically significant 
drug-drug interactions with  several important concomitant medications and is also associated with 
potential hepatotoxicity [Hansmann,  2016]. Sildenafil is associated with  a significantly increased risk of 
mortality at higher doses in children and adolescents [Hansmann, 2016].  Although not  approved for 
use in the paediatric population,  there is evidence that  prostanoid therapies are effective in children 
and adolescents [Frank, 2018].  However, in common with  their use in adults,  the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
properties of these drugs and routes of administration (e.g., intravenous [IV]), present substantial 
challenges to their  successful use in  a paediatric population. There is an unmet need for an approved 
treatment that  provides clear clinical benefit without  the complexities associated with managing 
potential issues.

Ambrisentan, an ERA, is approved for the treatment  of adults  with PAH. Treatment with  ambrisentan 
has been shown to improve exercise capacity, decrease the symptoms of PAH, and delay clinical 
worsening. The clinical profile of ambrisentan in adults is that  it  has an efficacy profile broadly 
comparable with  other targeted oral treatments, but that  it has potentially important  advantages. 
Ambrisentan has been associated with  a favourable liver safety profile and a low  risk of drug-drug 
interactions, which may provide a better therapeutic option in a paediatric population that  commonly 
require many concomitant medications. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This paediatric indication  is based on the pivotal phase IIb Study AMB112529, which  was a 6-month 
(24-week), randomised, open-label evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 2 doses of 
ambrisentan (Low and High, adjusted for body weight)  in paediatric subjects aged 8 years up to  18 
years with  PAH. The dossier also includes the open-label extension study AMB114588,  including 38 of 
the 41 children completing study AMB112529. 
All children received a fixed dose of 5 mg during the  first week of treatment in study AMB112529.  At 
week 2 onwards, the ambrisentan low dose was defined as 5 mg for children of  ≥35 kg, and 2.5 mg 
for children between ≥20  kg and <35 Kg. The ambrisentan high dose was defined as 10 mg in children 
≥50 kg, 7.5 mg in  children between  ≥35  kg and <50 Kg, and 5 mg in children between ≥20 kg and 
<35 Kg. The sponsor provided commercially available ambrisentan 5 mg tablets,  and 10  mg tablets as 
well as manufactured 2.5 mg tablets  of equivalent quality. 
The primary comparison stated in the AMB112529  protocol was to  evaluate the safety and tolerability 
of the 2 ambrisentan dose groups (Low versus High)  in the paediatric PAH population.  The secondary 
comparison was change from Baseline in the efficacy parameters between the 2 dose groups. Because 
subject recruitment was limited by the  low prevalence of the disease in children, powered clinical 
hypothesis tests were not  planned. Sixty-six subjects constituted  the selected sample size based on 
the predicted recruitment rate from historic data so that  the study could be completed in  a reasonable 
time frame (2 years) for it to  be useful and informative to the  medical community. A 10% drop out 
rate was anticipated  to leave 60 evaluable subjects.  
The study was stopped in March 2013  after 41 children (out of 60 planned) were recruited due to a 
nonclinical finding of brain weight decrease in juvenile rats with  low clinical margins for human 
paediatric dose exposures. Further nonclinical investigations were conducted, and the findings 
submitted  to CHMP in November 2017.  Notification  of the opinion of a proposed PIP modification 
submitted  by GSK was received from the EMA  PDCO in February 2019  (EMEA-000434-PIP01-08-M05). 
The study was agreed to be closed and a reduction in number of subjects from the planned 66 subjects 
(for 60 evaluable) to 40 was accepted. Therefore, recruitment was not re-initiated,  the study was 
declared as terminated on 11  Feb 2019, and the unplanned interim  analysis became the final analysis 
for this study (based on 41  subjects enrolled). 
The 6MWD test was primarily used to demonstrate the efficacy of ambrisentan in the paediatric 
population in both  Study AMB112529 and its  long-term safety and efficacy Study AMB114588.  The 
analysis used imputed data for the  primary endpoint, where the worst-case scenario was imputed as 
6MWD=0  for missing data following death or hospitalization, and the traditional  LOCF imputation  was 
used in all other scenarios. 
In addition, a separate Bayesian analysis of data from the 6MWD from Study AMB112529 was 
performed. A meta-analysis to check consistency between the effects on 6MWD in adults and children 
was conducted. A population  PK modelling and simulation analysis was performed to explore the 
potential relationship between ambrisentan PK and change from baseline in 6MWD  at 12 and 24 weeks 
in the paediatric population in Study AMB112529  and if required, develop an exposure-response (ER) 
model relating ambrisentan PK to change from baseline in 6MWD.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
In pivotal phase IIb study AMB112529,  in  41 children aged 8 to 17  years, over the 24-week Treatment 
Period there was evidence of an improvement in exercise capacity (6MWD),  but there was no dose 
trend in the effect of ambrisentan on this  endpoint. The mean change from baseline at  Week 24 in 
6MWD for patients in the  low and high dose groups was +55.14 metres and +26.25  metres, 
respectively. In subgroup analyses, the change from baseline in  6MWD at Week 24  was similar 
between the dose groups in paediatric subjects in the  12-18 age category but was higher in the Low 
dose group compared with  the high dose group in the  8-11 age category. An adhoc analysis showed 
that  24 subjects (59%) had an increase from baseline in  6MWD of ≥20 metres at Week 12 and Week 
24 in Study AMB112529  and these were fairly evenly distributed  across the idiopathic subgroup (15 of 
27; 56%)  and non-idiopathic subgroup (9 of 14; 64%).   
A Bayesian extrapolation analysis conducted by the  applicant suggest that the  increases in 6MWD  by 
26.25  m to 55.14 metres from baseline to week 24 in the  high and low dose groups in children is 
consistent to those reported with ambrisentan in placebo-controlled trials in adults.  The extrapolation 
has a number of major limitations  and has to be viewed as an exploratory exercise.  
Regarding secondary endpoints, there were also positive shifts in  WHO functional class. At Week 24, 
95% and 100%  of patients  in the low and high dose groups, respectively, remained stable (no change 
or improved functional class). The number of paediatric subjects with  clinical worsening of PAH was 
small in both dose groups (3 in  each dose group). One patient died in the low  dose group due to 
worsening of PAH. The Kaplan-Meier event-free survivor estimate for worsening of PAH (death [all 
cause], lung  transplantation, or hospitalisation for PAH worsening or PAH-related deterioration) at 24 
weeks was 86% and 85% in  the low- and high dose groups, respectively. Haemodynamics were 
measured in 5 patients (low  dose group). There were also positive effects in haemodynamics: mean 
increase from baseline in cardiac index was +0.94  L/min/m2,  the mean decrease in mean pulmonary 
arterial pressure was -2.2 mmHg,  and the mean decrease in PVR was -3.46  mmHg/L/min.  In addition, 
these efficacy findings were also supported by a small mean decrease in NT-proBNP over the 24-week 
Treatment Period. Geometric mean decrease from baseline in NT-pro-BNP was 31% in the low dose 
group (2.5 and 5 mg) and 28% in  the high dose group (5, 7.5,  and 10 mg). Change from Baseline in 
Physical and Psychosocial summary scores, as measured by the SF-10 health  survey, remained 
generally stable across the 24-week Treatment Period in  this study.  
A total of 38 of 41 patients recruited in study AMB112529  entered the  long-term extension study 
AMB114588.  There was no further improvement in exercise capacity from start of study AMB112529  to 
end of study. In the  overall patients the improvement was of only 3  metres (from 41.49 metres at the 
entry visit to 44.82  metres at end of study). These data can be interpreted such that  the improvement 
observed during the 24-week study  was maintained during the  extension study. However, about half of 
the study population (45%)  needed the addition  of other PAH therapies due to  deterioration or 
insufficient response.  The extension data are difficult to interpret due to important  methodological 
limitations  like small sample size, multiple dosing subgroups (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5  mg and 10  mg for a 
total of only 38 children), lack of control group and heterogeneous follow up  (between 3  months to 
over 5 years). No data of end of study visit were provided (mean follow-up  for these 6MWD values 
were not  provided). In addition, from entry visit in  the extension study to end of study visit there was 
a deterioration of 6MWD in  some dosing groups (2.5  mg: from 92.06  at entry visit to 71.47  metres at 
end of study; i.e.: 21 m deterioration; 7.5 mg: from 53.48  m at entry visit to 3.05  m at  end of study; 
i.e.: 50 m deterioration). The interpretation of these results is hampered by the low number of 
subjects by dosing group (i.e.: 9 children in the 2.5  mg subgroup and 5 children in the 7.5  mg 
subgroup). Overall, 11 of 38 subjects (29%) experienced clinical worsening during the  extension study 
AMB114588  according to at least one criterion with  the most  frequently reported reasons being death 
(5 subjects [13%])  and PAH-related deterioration (4  subjects [11%]).  The Kaplan-Meier analysis 
showed most events occurred within  3 years of Study AMB112529 Baseline. All deaths reported in 
Study AMB114588  were due to events associated with the  natural progression profile and known 
characteristics of children with  PAH disease, with  a mean time  to death of over 3  years from treatment 
initiation.  None of the deaths were considered related to ambrisentan. The time to  first clinical 
worsening of PAH was variable across subjects and dose groups and ranged from approximately 100

Page 98/107 
 
 
 
days to over 5  years. NT-proBNP values were variable across the duration of the long-term extension 
Study AMB114588  there was evidence of a small mean decrease from Study AMB112529  Baseline at 
the End of Study Visit. Change from Baseline in Physical and Psychosocial summary scores, as 
measured by the  SF-10 health survey, remained generally stable across the duration of long-term 
Study AMB114588.  In summary, the extension study AMB114588  showed that 71%  of children 
remained clinically stable on treatment  without  deterioration, while about 29% of children had 
deterioration despite the  addition of other target PAH therapeutic agents. In the absence of a control 
group no firm conclusions can be made, but anyway the  results are consistent with  the natural 
progression of the PAH disease. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and  limitations about favourable effects 
Volibris is currently approved for treatment idiopathic  PAH (IPAH) and PAH associated with  connective 
tissue disease in adults only. The indication proposed by the Applicant in this  application also contains 
indications of familial PAH and corrected congenital PAH in paediatric population. Further  discussion 
was therefore provided by the  Applicant regarding extrapolation of ambrisentan efficacy from approved 
adults indications IPAH and PAH associated in connective tissue disease to  newly proposed indications 
familial PAH and corrected congenital PAH in paediatric population taking into  account different 
aetiology and concomitant PAH therapies. The extrapolation from adults,  coupled with  the provision of 
additional effectiveness data from published studies and a Japanese PMS, was deemed acceptable. 
The study AMB112529 has several limitations, mainly related to the small sample size and lack of 
dose-response in efficacy. The number of children is insufficient to  allow for conclusion in several 
patient subsets mentioned in the  proposed indication. As such subgroup analyses were carried out  in 
order to explore the consistency of the  treatment effect in  important patient subsets mentioned in the 
indication. The effect was consistent  in most subgroups analysed. A bibliographic search identified 
several published studies  with ambrisentan in children, with  the populations and results being 
consistent with  the data provided by the study AMB112529  and its extension. 
There appears not to  be a dose-response relationship in 6MWD  and other secondary efficacy endpoints. 
In fact, most clinical outcomes, with  few exceptions, show a better effect for the low-dosing regime 
compared with  the high-dose regime. Further discussion of the lack of dose-response was provided by 
the applicant.  Adult  systemic exposure was found to  be predictive of exposures in paediatric subjects 
from 8  to less than  18 years of age in Study AMB112529  thereby supporting bridging of 
dose/exposure-dependent pharmacology between the two populations. Based on the extrapolation of 
exposure and response from adults to paediatric subjects with  PAH, the proposed dose 
recommendation for paediatric subjects is primarily based on providing systemic exposure in the same 
range to  adults with  PAH, and consistent  with the  current dose recommendation for titration  in  adult 
subjects with PAH adjusted for body weight.  The explanation was considered acceptable and therefore, 
the recommendation included in section 4.2  regarding uptitration  according to clinical response and 
tolerability can be maintained. 
The applicant did not plan a statistical comparison of the change in 6MWD at  week 24 versus baseline 
values, which  is unfortunate.  As a result, it  was difficult  to interpret whether the 55.14  m improvement 
in the low dose group or the 40.69  metres improvement in the overall population after 24 weeks is 
statistically significant  compared to baseline values. The applicant provided the results on 6MWD 
(improvement versus baseline) by dose group and well as for the  total study population, in  terms of 
mean and median metres of change in 6MWD with  95%CI. These data have been included in section 
5.1 of the SmPC. A comparison versus putative placebo was requested from the applicant.  From the 
limited studies that  do have placebo information for change from Baseline in 6MWD (SERAPHIN study 
in adults),  there is consistent evidence of a mean/median reduction in 6MWD across a 6-month  period 
(with  approximate magnitude of 8 to 15 metres) compared with an increased 6MWD  for active 
treatments. Data from the most  closely matching study in the literature (SERAPHIN study) has allowed 
the Company to  provide an overall estimated treatment effect of 50.09 m (95%  CI: 15.43,  84.75)  for 
study AMB112529,  which suggests superiority in  favour of ambrisentan treatment.

Looking at baseline NT-ProBNP concentrations it seems that  randomisation was not  successful, with 
more children in the high  dose groups having characteristics of a more severe disease and/or a better 
background treatment indicating  less room for improvement compared with  the low dose group. For 
example, more children in the high  dose group were on FCIII compared to the  low dose group (6 vs. 3) 
and patients in the  high dose group had higher mean NT-ProBNP levels than those randomised to the 
low ambrisentan dose, indicating  a worse cardiac function in patients  randomised to the high 
ambrisentan dose. In addition, there was also a significant imbalance in  the number of non-white,  non-
European subjects, with  more of these subjects been enrolled in the  low-dose group compared to the 
high-dose group (10 vs. 1),  and therefore the better outcome in the low dose group could be related to 
a suboptimal background therapy in  non-European subjects (10 of 11 non-white  non-European children 
fall in the low dose group). These baseline imbalances could explain to  some extent the lack of dose-
response in efficacy. The applicant was invited to  elaborate and discuss on this  issue. These baseline 
imbalances could explain to  some extent the lack of dose-response in efficacy. Whether these 
imbalances may have led to  the lack of demonstration of a dose-response (i.e.: no better results on 
6MWD with  the high  dose compared to the low dose) cannot be confirmed or ruled out.  
It is unclear whether the  24-week improvement in  6MWD reflects ambrisentan treatment effect or to 
the use of rescue PAH medications or increase in dose of concomitant medications in the low dose 
group. The applicant was requested to analyse separately patients that  continued with  unchanged PAH 
medications doses for the  24 weeks and patients that  had some dose-increase or received additional 
PAH medications introduced during  that period. Few patients received rescue medications or change in 
concomitant cardiovascular medications. This information was provided by the  applicant. The 
introduction  of rescue medications or change in concomitant  cardiovascular medications does not 
appear to have influenced the assessment of the main outcome of 6MWD. 
Finally, study AMB112529  was stopped in 2013 due to nonclinical findings.  The applicant was invited to 
discuss whether the study results are representative of current management of PAH in 2020.  The 
applicant submitted  the results of a consultation  with 8 PAH experts [members of the Independent 
Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) and other expert consultants]  and a literature review to support 
the external validity of study AMB112529.  These data support the representative nature of the 
AMB112529  data to the current management of paediatric subjects with  PAH. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety database supporting this  application is composed by 41  children included in  study 
AMB112529  and 38 children included in its extension study AMB11458. Cumulative exposure to 
ambrisentan in Study AMB112529 and the extension study ranged from 14.3 to 335.1  weeks, with  a 
median duration of 176.6  weeks. More than half of the subjects received ambrisentan treatment for at 
least 3 years and the  longest cumulative duration  of treatment  was greater than  6.6 years. 
The majority of subjects in  both studies reported at least 1 treatment-emergent AE and the majority 
were mild or moderate in intensity.  The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AE was 
headache in Study AMB112529  and upper respiratory tract infection in the  extension study. The most 
common drug-related AE was headache for both studies. A total  of 7 deaths were reported, 1 was in 
Study AMB112529  due to  an SAE of pneumonia and 6 were in the extension study.  These 6 deaths 
were considered related to the subjects’ underlying PAH condition,  with  a mean time to death of more 
than 3 years from treatment initiation.  SAEs were reported in 8 subjects (20%)  with 9 events in Study 
AMB112529  and none of SAEs occurred in more than 1 subject. 
AESIs were reported in 9 subjects (with  11 events) in Study AMB112529.  With  the exceptions of 
anaemia and hypotension (1 each), all events were related to oedema. Six AESIs were considered by 
the investigator to be related to ambrisentan treatment: oedema peripheral (2),  face oedema (2), 
angioedema (1), and hypotension (1). No AESIs led to permanent discontinuation  of ambrisentan 
treatment or withdrawal from the study. In the extension study, AESIs were reported in  20 subjects

EMA/CHMP/476747/2021  
Page 100/107 
 
 
 
(53%).  Anaemia was the  most frequently reported AESI, 11 events in  6 subjects. Oedema-related 
events were reported in 6 subjects with  8 events. Five events of liver laboratory abnormalities were 
reported as AEs in  2 subjects. 
Adverse events were analysed by age stratum.  In Study AMB112529,  a total of 14 subjects aged 8-11 
years (7 in each dose group) and 27 subjects aged 12 to <18  years (14 in the low dose group and 13 
in the high  dose group) were enrolled. In the  extension study AMB114588  a total of 14 subjects aged 
8-11  years and 24 subjects aged 12  to <18 years were enrolled. Adverse event profile was consistent 
by age stratum. 
In line with  expected pubertal development in this population,  no clinically relevant change in male 
testicular volume from baseline was observed in both studies. No clinically relevant change in 
female/male endocrinology or plasma endocrine parameters were seen for both studies. 
There were no liver events reported during  the Study AMB112529. One liver event, both ALT and AST 
≥3X ULN,  was reported in the extension study. No QT prolongation-related AE, as well as AEs of 
ventricular arrhythmias, were reported during both  studies although there was 1 report of QT 
prolongation in association with  an event of atrioventricular block first degree that  resolved with 
continued treatment  and was not considered related to ambrisentan treatment. A small mean 
reduction from baseline in haemoglobin, haematocrit, and platelet count was observed in both Study 
AMB112529  and the extension study. 
The company has also provided data of off-label use in children using the Gilead’s ARGUS [the 
Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology (PVE) safety database of Gilead]. A total of 1,934 cases, where 
children aged 8 to less than 18  years old have received ambrisentan, have been reported to  Gilead 
since launch until 14  June 2019. These cases have reported a total of 5,279  events, with  some cases 
reporting more than one event. The most commonly reported adverse events, after off label use, were 
headache (194),  dyspnoea (111), vomiting (86)  and diarrhoea (85) all of which are listed in  the EU 
SmPC with  a frequency of very common or common. It is noted that  a number of events of pneumonia 
(76 cases) have been reported in  the 8 to less than 18 years population. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database supporting this  application is very limited composed by 41 children included in 
study AMB112529  and 38 children included in its extension study AMB11458. Despite the safety profile 
seems similar to that  reported in adults in qualitative terms (i.e.: headache, gastrointestinal  adverse 
events, oedema, etc.), the small safety database and the absence of a comparator group does not 
allow for a precise estimate of adverse events in children. The applicant properly commented on the 
difficulties encountered with the  clinical studies enrolment that  leads the submission of a limited safety 
database (41  children included in study AMB112529  and 38 children included in its  extension study 
AMB11458)  to support this application. The Applicant has also provided a more detailed adverse events 
evidence by including  a nominally off-label dataset of children and adolescents in the age range of 8 to 
<18 years receiving ambrisentan for the treatment  of PAH. This dataset was composed by data 
obtained from the  paediatric subgroup (119 patients)  of an unpublished  Japan Post Marketing 
Surveillance study (Study 114782)  as well as reports of off-label use of ambrisentan in this  population 
from the  Global Safety Database between 15 June 2018  and 14 June 2019  period. Paediatric patients 
included in submitted  dataset were comparable to those included in the study AMB112529  and its 
extension AMB114588.  Moreover, it  seems acceptable to inform on the qualitative similarity of the 
adult and paediatric safety profile. It  is considered that broadening the safety database submitted  in 
the application has improved the safety paediatric profile of this product,  despite it  does not  allow for a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/476747/2021  
Page 101/107 
 
 
 
 
precise estimate of adverse events in paediatric population. The company also presented safety 
paediatric data including  different PAH aetiologies retrieved from divergent sources after a systematic 
bibliographic search, which appeared to be comparable to those seen in performed clinical trials. Based 
on them no observation of new safety risks associated with  ambrisentan administration was made. 
Similarly, no divergence in the safety profile compared to the adult  population was seen. Despite of the 
observed limitations it  can be concluded that the summarized outcomes obtained from several sources 
do not show any differences across aetiology subgroups.  
Some reported adverse reactions in children were unlisted.  Details about  unlisted non-serious 
eosinophilia and lymphopenia (drug-related) cases were provided. In both cases the confounding 
factors including  underlying conditions and concomitant medications may have contributed to  the 
events. Therefore, no new safety concern was identified.  No other laboratory abnormalities coded as 
ambrisentan-related AEs were reported by the Investigator and no PCC has been identified in the study 
AMB114588. 
The majority of subjects used a background PAH medication(s) in both studies, mainly a PDE-5 
inhibitor  as monotherapy or in combination with  a prostanoid. Adverse events by concomitant 
medications were provided and a similar pattern was observed regardless of concomitant medications 
used.  
The number of children in other conditions apart from IPAH was very scarce to draw any meaningful 
conclusion about safety in these conditions: 8 children with  persistent PAH despite surgical repair, 4 
children in connective PAH and 2 children with  familial PAH. The applicant was requested to conduct  a 
systematic bibliographic search and to discuss published studies with  ambrisentan in children, as well 
as to compare these results to those obtained in the  study AMB112529 and its  extension, in terms of 
adverse events. The additional paediatric safety data including  different PAH aetiologies retrieved from 
divergent sources appeared to be comparable to those seen in performed clinical trials. Based on them 
no observation of new safety risks associated with  ambrisentan administration was made. Similarly, no 
divergence in the safety profile compared to the adult population  was seen. Despite of the observed 
limitations  it can be concluded that  the summarized outcomes obtained from several sources do not 
show any differences across aetiology subgroups.  
There was a lack of dose-response regarding adverse events, with more adverse events reported with 
the ambrisentan low dose. The applicant attempted to  analyse different causes that  could lead to  the 
observed lack of dose-response regarding adverse events in study AMB112529,  with  more adverse 
events reported with the  ambrisentan low dose. As stated by the Applicant, it  is considered that there 
is no pattern or trend in adverse event reporting between dose groups, being the differences seen 
between the two dose groups probably to due to variability in such a small size population. 
The number of cases of off-label use reported in children from Gilead's ARGUS database (n=1,934 
cases) is much higher than the number of children included in  the pivotal study AMB112529 (n=41). 
The applicant states that the  review of the off-label paediatric data in children aged 8 to less than 18 
years shows a similar safety profile to that  of the adult  population with  the adverse reactions reported 
being consistent with  those seen in adults,  with headache, dyspnoea, vomiting and diarrhoea occurring 
most frequently. While, qualitatively, the adverse events reported in off-label use in children are within 
expected for adults, no conclusions can be made with  respect to compare incidence rates versus 
adults. In addition,  the 76 pneumonia cases reported in off-label use were further discussed in the 
applicant and no particular concerns are raised in children.  
The Applicant proposed to add new paragraph to the section 4.8 dealing with  paediatric safety profile. 
Although the  reported TEAEs are mostly in  line with the  known ambrisentan safety profile, the 
currently suggested wording does not specifically reflect the  results (drug-related events) reported in 
two submitted  clinical studies and that should be adjusted. In addition, the warning on the fluid 
Assessment report

retention events is stated in the Section 4.4 and corresponding PTs are listed in the Section 4.8. The 
Applicant has also updated the paragraph related to the available safety data collected from clinical 
studies enrolling paediatric population.  Regarding to the events related to the  fluid retention, the 
Applicant specifically elaborated on all events reported in  paediatric and adult patients.  The consistency 
in the overall incidence and severity of the cases comparing both populations is claimed, which is 
agreed. The updated paragraph in Section 4.8 does not  contain any information on this matter  as only 
two events of peripheral oedema attributed to the  study treatment were seen within  paediatric 
development. The previously listed information in Section 4.4 corresponds with the  provided paediatric 
data and thus can be considered sufficient.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the pivotal trial there was suggestion of an improvement in exercise capacity (6MWD).  The 6MWD 
endpoint has been shown  in the adult PAH population to  correlate with long term clinical outcome and 
is generally used to  follow exercise tolerance in paediatric PAH patients of appropriate age, being a 
reliable test  in children ≥  7 years. Interventional clinical trials in adults with  PAH have commonly used 
the 6MWD  test to demonstrate efficacy for drug approval [Ollivier, et al. J Am Heart Assoc. 
2019;8:e011306].  In absolute terms, the increase in 6MWD  was surprisingly more pronounced with 
the low ambrisentan dose compared to the high  dose (55 m vs 26 m), and in the overall population 
was of 40.69 metres. The MCID for 6MWD reported in the  literature is about 33  m [Mathai, et  al. Am J 
Respir Crit Care Med.  2012; 186:  428-33].  Therefore, the favourable trend observed in exercise 
capacity can be considered of clinical relevance. The main analysis was supported by an ad-hoc 
analysis of responders, in which 59% of children improved by at least 20 metres at week 24 compared 
with  baseline values. The 40.69  metres observed in children (55  m for the  low ambrisentan dose) are 
consistent with  the 44.6  metres (placebo-adjusted mean improvement) reported in  a combined 
analysis of the Phase 3 studies (ARIES-C) conducted in  adults for the  5 mg dose, and the 52.5  m 
improvement observed in adults with  10 mg dose. These comparisons are however fraught with  risk 
because in adults, the  improvement correspond to placebo-corrected improvement and in children 
correspond to improvement versus baseline. In IPAH, exercise capacity correlates with right  atrial (RA) 
pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), and cardiac index (CI). These were secondary endpoints 
in the paediatric trial and some improvements were found at  24 weeks compared to baseline, being 
consistent with  the positive effects seen on exercise capacity. 
The risks observed in the paediatric population  were similar to  those found in adults, with  headache 
and oedema occurring very commonly. These events are usually mild to moderate and manageable in 
standard practice. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefits observed in exercise capacity in children were consistent with  those found in adults.  The 
risks observed in the paediatric population were also similar to those found in  adults, with  headache 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/476747/2021

and oedema occurring very commonly. The applicant has demonstrated similar PK/PD relationship in 
children and adults, and therefore extrapolation from adults is accepted. In addition, the  Company 
submitted  further supportive information from literature and post-marketing studies in children. These 
data support the effectiveness and safety of ambrisentan in children with  various PAH aetiologies. 
Therefore, the balance between benefits and risks observed in children could be regarded as similarly 
positive as in adults. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Volibris in  the treatment of PAH in adolescents and children (aged 8 
to less than 18 years) is positive. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that  Volibris is not similar to Opsumit  (macitentan) or Adempas (riociguat) 
within  the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC)  No. 847/2000.  See appendix on 
similarity. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP  review of data on quality safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that  the benefit-risk balance of, Volibris 2.5 mg <new pharmaceutical form in the following 
indication(s): 
Volibris  is  indicated  for treatment  of  PAH  in  adolescents and  children  (aged  8  to  less than  18 
years) of 
WHO  Functional  Class (FC)  II to  III including  use  in  combination  treatment.  Efficacy has  been 
shown 
in IPAH, familial, corrected congenital and in  PAH associated with connective tissue disease. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the  marketing authorisation for Volibris subject 
to the following  conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the  marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety  Update  Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the  list of Union reference dates (EURD list)  provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC  and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

•  Risk Management  Plan  (RMP) 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH)  shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module  1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important  (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation)  milestone being 
reached.  
•  Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to use of Volibris in each Member State the  Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must  agree the 
content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, distribution 
modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with  the National  Competent Authority. The MAH 
shall ensure that  in each Member State where Volibris is marketed, all patients who are expected to 
use Volibris are provided with  the following educational material: 
• Patient reminder card 
Patient reminder card should include the following key elements: 
− That Volibris is teratogenic in  animals; 
− That pregnant women must not  take Volibris; 
− That women of reproductive potential must  use effective contraception; 
− The need for monthly pregnancy tests; 
− The need for regular monitoring of liver function  because Volibris may cause liver injury. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the  available paediatric data of studies  subject to  the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan EMEA-000434-PIP01-08-M06  and the results of these studies  are reflected 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
In addition, CHMP  recommends the variation(s) to the  terms of the marketing authorisation concerning 
the following change(s):

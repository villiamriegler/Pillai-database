1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The Applicant MedImmune LLC submitted on 5 March 2015 an application for Marketing Authorisation 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 MedImmune, through 
the centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 20 
February 2014. 
The Applicant applied for the following indication: “Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared 
pandemic situation in children and adolescents from 12 months to less than 18 years of age. The use 
of MedImmune pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 should be based on official recommendations.” 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The Applicant indicated 
that pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (live attenuated, nasal) was considered to be a new active 
substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on Applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0313/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0313/2014 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the Applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request for consideration 
Conditional Marketing Authorisation 
The Applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 as it is claimed that this is a medicinal 
product to be used in emergency situations, in response to public health threats duly recognised 
either by the World Health Organisation or by the EU (Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
507/2006) –. 
The Applicant claimed that: 
The risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product is positive; 
• 
•  he will be in a position to provide comprehensive data when a pandemic occurs; 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 6/92 
  
  
 
• 
• 
there is a an unmet medical need fulfilled by providing a live attenuated pandemic influenza 
preparedness vaccine in children and adolescents; 
the benefit to public health of authorising this pandemic preparedness vaccine outweighs the 
risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required on the actual pandemic strain. 
New active Substance status 
The Applicant requested the active substance contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance in itself, as the Applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
product previously authorised within the Union. The active substance is: 
Reassortant influenza virus* (live attenuated) of the following strain**: 
A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) strain 
(A/Vietnam/1203/2004, MEDI 0141000136) 
* 
propagated in fertilised hens’ eggs from healthy chicken flocks. 
**  produced in VERO cells by reverse genetic technology. This product contains a genetically 
modified organism (GMO). 
Scientific Advice 
The Applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 2 August 2013, 11 September 2013 and 15 
January 2014. The Scientific Advice pertained to quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
An influenza pandemic occurs when a novel influenza virus appears to which no baseline immunity 
prevails in the human population, thus causing substantial numbers of deaths and severe disease 
worldwide. A pandemic may target age groups that are not traditionally affected by seasonal 
epidemics, e.g. young adults. Since the 20th century, several influenza pandemics occurred, including 
the “Spanish Flu” caused by H1N1 virus in 1918, the “Asian Flu” caused by H2N2 in 1957, the “Hong 
Kong Flu” caused by H3N2 in 1968, and the “Russian Flu” in 1977 and the “Swine Flu” in 2009 both 
caused by H1N1 viruses. The worst pandemic ever was the one in 1918, which killed an estimate of 50 
million people worldwide, whereas the others brought about a lesser death toll. 
It is hardly predictable which novel influenza virus strain will trigger the next pandemic and when a 
new pandemic will occur. At present, H5N1 strain poses a great concern, despite the limited human-to-
human transmission so far, mainly due to its history of causing severe disease with a high case fatality 
rate. The consecutive isolations of several distinguishable clades of the H5N1 subtype in the world 
suggest that the virus underwent continuous minor antigenic changes.  
During a pandemic, mass vaccination of the community represents an important measure to protect 
people individually from contracting disease and also from the spread of the infection within the 
population. The establishment of the “core dossier” procedure with the purpose of evaluating and 
authorising such vaccines during inter-pandemic periods could favour the timely supply of such 
vaccines to large parts of the population upon pandemic declaration. The dossier of this type of 
vaccine, the pandemic preparedness vaccine, will be developed on the basis of a potential pandemic 
strain. Such strain should be characterised mainly by the potential to cause a pandemic in humans, low 
immunogenicity and absence of specific baseline immunity in the population. Clinical testing of a 
pandemic preparedness vaccine will be undertaken during the interpandemic period, using clinical trial 
material that is produced by the same manufacture process and that is tested against the same 
specifications as will be the actual pandemic vaccine. The antigen content and dose formulation, as 
well as the route of vaccine administration in clinical trials have to be identical to that of the future 
pandemic vaccine. Once a pandemic is duly recognised in the EU, inclusion of the actual pandemic 
strain into the pandemic preparedness vaccine and subsequent authorisation of the pandemic vaccine 
will be processed via a variation procedure after submission of a dossier specific to the pandemic 
strain. Evaluation of this dossier will therefore be faster, in light of the previous knowledge on the 
vaccine construct acquired through the core dossier before the pandemic, and will focus mainly on 
quality data that are new and relevant to the actual pandemic virus strain to be included into the 
vaccine.  
For this Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA), H5N1 was selected as the pandemic preparedness 
subtype due to the particular virulence of this subtype, the threat that it poses to human health and 
the fact that shows low immunogenicity and low baseline immunity. Since 2003, a total of 668 cases of 
human H5N1 infection have been reported including 393 deaths. While the virulence of the virus may 
decrease as it becomes adapted for sustained human-to-human transmission, the case fatality rate of 
approximately 60% is extremely alarming and a pandemic caused by H5N1 could equal or exceed that 
seen in 1918 in terms of overall severity.

Considerations on clinical evaluation of pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccine 
(P/LAIV) 
The conduct of protective efficacy trials for a pandemic preparedness vaccine is neither practical nor 
ethical (if human challenge study is intended). Thus, a core dossier necessitates that immunogenicity 
and safety studies are instead conducted during interpandemic period. It is expected that the 
pandemic vaccine effectiveness will be evaluated in the post-authorisation phase during the next 
pandemic. 
Due to the potential for shedding and transmission of a P/LAIV candidate virus strain and the resulting 
potential concern for reassortment between the vaccine virus and the wild type circulating viruses, 
conduct of clinical safety and immunogenicity trials generally requires isolation units and the 
recruitment of healthy adults in early phase of clinical development. Studies recruiting children, 
especially less than 2 years of age, would not be approvable by regulatory authorities without 
adequate clinical data from an adult population, especially when taking into account specific safety 
issue encountered for seasonal T/LAIV (Fluenz). For the latter vaccine a statistically significant increase 
in wheezing in children aged < 24 months and an increased rate of all-cause hospitalisation in children 
below the age of 12 months was observed. 
Evaluation of P/LAIV immunogenicity is considered very challenging. For the most part difficulties are 
due to lack of knowledge regarding immunological correlates of protection for influenza vaccines in 
general but in particular for LAIV. Specific antibody responses, which are commonly examined for 
determining immunogenicity of inactivated influenza vaccines, are hardly detectable by existing 
immunoassays after vaccination with LAIV. Currently, no clear recommendation exists on how the 
immunogenicity of a P/LAIV vaccine should be measured. Nevertheless, relevant principles are 
described in the draft EMA Guideline on Influenza Vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). 
About the product  
MedImmune pandemic preparedness vaccine H5N1 (P/LAIV) for intranasal administration is a 
monovalent live attenuated vaccine that contains a single attenuated (att), cold-adapted (ca), and 
temperature-sensitive (ts) reassortant influenza virus of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus 
strain A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1). The surface glycoproteins HA and NA of the H5N1 strain have been 
integrated by reverse genetics into the backbone of the long established A/AnnArbor/6/60 (H2N2) 
Master donor virus (MDV) that contributes the ts, ca, and att phenotype, creating a 6+2 chimeric virus. 
Hence, the vaccine contains a genetically modified organism (GMO). Each 0.2 mL dose will contain 
107.0 ± 0.5 fluorescent focus units (FFU) of the genetically modified A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 strain.  
P/LAIV is formulated in a refrigerated liquid formulation. For the list of excipients please see section 
6.1 of the SmPC.  
The vaccine is supplied in a carton of 10 single-use nasal sprayers (0.2 ml each, in trays). It will be 
administered using the Becton Dickinson Accuspray™ device, which delivers a 0.1 mL volume 
intranasal vaccine dose into each nostril.  
The vaccination schedule proposed for children and adolescents consists of 2 doses of the vaccine 
separated by an interval of at least 4 weeks.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as nasal spray suspension containing 107.0 ± 0.5 fluorescent focus units 
(FFUs) of H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 in each 0.2 mL dose as active substance.  Other ingredients are 
sucrose, dibasic potassium phosphate, monobasic potassium phosphate, gelatin (porcine, Type A), 
arginine hydrochloride, monosodium glutamate monohydrate and water for injection. 
The product is supplied as a 0.2 ml suspension in a single use nasal sprayer (Type 1 glass), with nozzle 
(polypropylene with polyethylene transfer valve), nozzle tip protector cap (synthetic rubber), plunger 
rod, plunger stopper (butyl rubber), and a dose divider clip in a pack size of 10. 
P/LAIV contains the same type of components as currently included in the approved vaccine, Fluenz 
Tetra, and differs only in the fact that it is a monovalent formulation containing a single Type A strain. 
The two vaccines are produced by the same manufacturing process using the same attenuated master 
donor virus and excipients and are blended with the same potency specification: 107.0 ± 0.5 fluorescent 
focus units (FFUs) per strain. Both vaccines are administered intranasally using the Becton Dickinson 
(BD) Accuspray™ device.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The pandemic influenza A/Vietnam/1203 (H5N1) vaccine is a monovalent version of the already 
approved seasonal live attenuated vaccine “Fluenz Tetra” (tetravalent formulation).  
Influenza virus Type A belongs to the family of Orthomyxoviruses. Influenza viruses are enveloped and 
do not have a rigid capsule structure (see Figure 1). The internal core of influenza virus particles 
consists of a segmented RNA genome, which is associated with the nucleoprotein <NP> and 
polymerase proteins. The viral envelope surrounds the viral nucleocapsid. The internal layer of the viral 
envelope contains viral matrix protein <M>, and the external layer of the envelope consists of a lipid 
bilayer that is derived from the host cell membrane during release of newly formed virus particles from 
infected cells. The external surface of the lipid bilayer of influenza viruses is decorated with two major 
viral transmembrane protein spikes of which approximately 80% are rod-shaped haemagglutinin (HA) 
protein trimers, and 20% are mushroom-shaped neuraminidase (NA) tetramers.   
The epidemiology of influenza viruses dictates incorporation of contemporary protective antigens (the 
haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens) into the vaccine on an annual basis. The HA 
protein is responsible for several of the biological properties of influenza viruses and the NA protein 
contributes to the antigenic characteristics and functional properties of influenza virus. Both the HA 
and NA protein epitopes contribute to the induction of a protective response in humans. Alterations in 
the primary structure of HA and NA proteins are directly related to antigenic variation of influenza 
viruses, which serves as the basis for antigenic and immunogenic characterization of influenza viruses 
using strain-specific antiserum.

Figure 1.  Structure of the influenza A virus particle (Lamb, 1996) 
The cold-adapted reassortant vaccine strains for P/LAIV are produced by genetic reassortment 
between wild-type influenza virus and a master donor virus (MDV). Such reassortant viruses contain 
gene segments encoding HA and NA antigens contributed by the wild-type circulating virus, and gene 
segments encoding the remaining proteins derived from the cold-adapted MDV (polymerase basic 
protein 1 <PB1>, polymerase basic protein 2 <PB2>, polymerase acidic protein <PA>, nucleoprotein 
<NP>, matrix protein <M>, and non-structural protein <NS>). These vaccine strains are thus called 
6:2 reassortants. Hence, cold-adapted reassortant vaccine strains derive their antigenic phenotypes 
from the circulating strains HA and NA antigens and their cold-adapted (ca: efficient growth at 33°C 
and 25°C), temperature-sensitive (ts: highly restricted growth at 39°C), and attenuated (att) 
phenotypes from the MDV. The MDV used to generate the P/LAIV vaccine reassortant is A/Ann 
Arbor/6/60 that was developed by H.F. Massaab in 1982.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
The monovalent bulk active substance is produced at MedImmune UK Limited, Speke, Liverpool, 
United Kingdom. 
Manufacture of the Master Virus Seed (MVS) 
The 6:2 reassortant Master Virus Seed (MVS) containing six viral gene segments from the attenuated 
Master Donor Virus (MDV) and two gene segments from wild-type (wt) influenza vaccine virus 
encoding haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens. MVS are prepared by a plasmid 
rescue process / reverse genetics in Vero cells. The process is depicted in Figure 2.

Page 12/92 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  MVS Manufacturing Process 
CEK: chicken embryo kidney cells 
The plasmid rescue process is initiated by extracting viral RNA from the MDV and from the wt strain, 
and converting six viral gene segments (<PB1>, <PB2>, <PA>, <NP>, <M>, <NS>) from the MDV, 
and the HA and NA gene segments from the wt strain, into cDNA by Reverse Transcription Polymerase 
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). These amplified cDNAs are inserted into plasmids and transformed into E. 
coli cells. The transformed E.coli cells are grown and plasmid DNA is purified for testing and further 
processing.  
The cDNA containing plasmids corresponding to the MDV gene segment, as well as the cDNA 
containing plasmids corresponding to the wt HA and NA gene segments are combined by 
electroporation into serum-free Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells that are derived from an 
extensively tested and characterized cell bank. The electroporated Vero cells are then co-cultured with 
CEK cells. The 6:2 reassortants are then passaged in SPF embryonated chicken eggs to produce 
material, referred to as accession seed. The accession seed is biologically purified and amplified in SPF 
eggs to produce the MVS batch. 
Each MVS is tested for sterility (bacterial/fungal contamination), mycoplasma and viral adventitious 
agents before release for further manufacturing. 
Manufacture of the monovalent bulk  
Manufacturing of the monovalent bulk active substance is performed at the MedImmune UK facility in 
Speke, Liverpool. Monovalent bulks are prepared by inoculation and growth of the master virus seed 
(MVS) in embryonated Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) eggs. The batch scale for LAIV manufacture is 
defined by the number of SPF chicken eggs used. Downstream of the allantoic fluid harvesting stage, 
the process is defined by the volume of clarified harvest fluid loaded on the ultracentrifuge rather than 
the number of eggs.  
Upon shipment SPF eggs are compliance checked, washed, dried and transferred into the Primary 
Incubation suite where they are held. 
Following the primary incubation period, eggs are candled for any cracks etc. The trays of acceptable 
eggs are held under controlled temperature conditions until inoculation. The eggs are inoculated with 
inoculum (based on the infectivity titre (log10 FFU/ml) of diluted Master Virus Seed (MVS)) and 
incubated. After incubation, allantoic fluid is removed. Clear allantoic fluid is dispensed into a sterile 
polycarbonate bottle and transferred to the Harvest Cold Room until released for further processing.

Harvest bottles are screened for lack of bioburden and pooled. The pooled material is filtered to obtain 
Clarified Harvest Fluid (CHF). The CHF is mixed and samples are removed for further bioburden in-
process testing. Pooled virus harvest is concentrated using continuous flow ultracentrifugation in a 
sucrose gradient to increase the density of virus particles and to reduce egg-derived proteins, nucleic 
acids and other components. Concentrated virus harvest is pooled, diluted and sterile filtered to obtain 
the monovalent bulk. 
The viral eluate is then filled into polycarbonate bottles that are stored for a maximum period of 24 
months. 
The container closure system for the final active substance is a polycarbonate (PC) bottle, sealed with 
polypropylene screw-on cap containing a silicon rubber liner.  
Following freeze-down and placement of the active substance containers in the MedImmune-UK 
storage freezers bottles are subsequently shipped to the MedImmune Pennsylvania Facility for further 
processing (blending). Monovalent bulk active substance shipping containers have been validated to 
maintain frozen temperatures during transit activities and utilize dry ice as the refrigerant.  
Critical Process Parameters (CPP) and Key Operating Parameters (KOP) were defined for the 
manufacturing of the monovalent bulk AS, based on their ability to impact on Critical Quality Attributes 
(CQAs) and process performance, respectively. 
In-process control (IPC) limits have been established for key process parameters that are used to 
monitor ongoing production of the monovalent bulk AS.  
Process validation 
Validation of the LAIV monovalent bulk AS manufacturing process at MedImmune UK was originally 
performed in 2004. The process has been subject to further validation studies to support subsequent 
process improvements and equipment changes. These changes were designed to improve the 
manufacturing process and microbiological control and have been well documented. A review of the 
monovalent bulk validation approaches, acceptance criteria and validation results has been provided. 
Taken together these data and attached reports confirm the validity and applicability of process 
steps/improvements implemented after the initial validation. The formulation of the monovalent bulk 
AS has not changed and is the same as that used in the pivotal clinical trials. The study results 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of consistently yielding monovalent bulk AS 
that is compliant with the specifications. 
Manufacturing process development 
As previously stated, MedImmune is applying the same manufacturing process to P/LAIV that has been 
used for more than 90 full-scale lots of a monovalent A/California/2009 (H1N1) vaccine produced 
during the “swineflu” pandemic in 2009/2010. Consequently, for the seasonal (Fluenz tetra) and the 
H1N1-pandemic counterparts of the H5N1-pandemic vaccine substantial experience exists regarding 
the manufacturing process and the control regimen applied (i.e. millions of doses).   
The clinical H5N1 batches were manufactured in 2005-2006 at pilot scale. The present application 
dossier does not contain full scale A/Vietnam/1203-specific information for active substance 
manufacturing and testing. Instead available and supportive data is provided for seasonal and H1N1-
pandemic vaccines. This is due to the situation that no large scale production of A/Vietnam/1203-
specific active substance batches has been initiated so far and only small scale lots of clinical trial 
material have been produced in 2005/2006. The CHMP considered that given the extensive experience 
with MedImmunes manufacturing process for LAIVs, it would not be necessary to generate additional 
H5N1 commercial scale material, which may never be used as it can be expected that the strain will

Page 14/92 
  
  
need to be varied prior to commercial use of the vaccine. Thus data provided from the seasonal 
influenza vaccine and the pandemic A/H1N1 strain is considered supportive and sufficient.  
Specification 
The active substance is intended to be tested according to the programme that is implemented and 
approved for the seasonal LAIVs. This is considered acceptable. The monovalent bulk active substance 
is tested for appearance, sterility, endotoxin, identity HAI, genotype, phenotype, attenuation, and 
potency. A panel of additional tests, mostly to confirm the absence of microbial contaminations, is 
conducted on the pooled harvest.  
Analytical methods 
The proposed analytical procedures are the same as applied for the testing of the approved seasonal 
versions of the vaccine and are adequately validated. During the procedure the Applicant provided the 
requested relevant information on specific steps and characteristics related to the A/Vietnam/1203 
descendent reassortant seed strain generated and used for vaccine manufacture.  
During process development the potency assay and the specifications have been changed from the 
tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) to the fluorescent focus assay (FFA). The FFA utilizes 
immunofluorescent staining of virus-infected Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells with anti-
influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies specific for each individual vaccine strain.  
According to the release certificate provided, the A/Vietnam/1203 monovalent bulk (used for 
production of clinical trial vaccine lots in 2005/2006) was tested for potency by the TCID50 method.  
Comparative data on vaccine potency determined by either the TCID50 or the FFA method was 
requested during the procedure and has been provided by the Applicant. These data were generated 
for monovalent bulks as well as for trivalent seasonal finished product and demonstate the 
compatibility of potency determination by both methods.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data for monovalent bulks from three consecutive process validation lots used to 
manufacture pandemic H1N1 consistency batches in 2009 (at pilot scale) have been provided instead 
of commercial scale data for a contemporary pandemic strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004). Further batch 
analysis data for three lots of LAIV Monovalent Bulk (B/Massachusetts/2/2012) manufactured during 
January to February 2014 for influenza strain B/Massachusetts/2/2012 have been provided as 
supportive. 
Taken together the available data and extensive manufacturing experience (i.e. seasonal (Fluenz tetra) 
and the H1N1-pandemic counterparts of the H5N1-pandemic vaccine) have been considered acceptable 
to confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process. The specifications for the monovalent bulk 
active substance have been established based on manufacturing history, clinical data and commercial 
experience, i.e. for seasonal LAIVs with respect to bioburden, endotoxin, appearance and potency. 
Reference standard 
There is no reference standard according to ICH Q6B used in the release tests performed on 
monovalent bulk AS for the LAIV. This is acceptable given the specificity of the active substance. 
During the procedure the Applicant was requested to present a strategy for the production of anti-sera 
and reference reagents in the pandemic situation in light of time constraints in order to ensure the 
correct virus titre per dose. The proposed strategy to produce anti-sera and reference reagents in a 
pandemic situation was considered acceptable in order to determine the virus titre per dose using the 
FFA is a direct measure of the infectivity.

Stability 
A stability period of 24 months at ≤ 60°C is proposed for the monovalent bulk active substance.  
The proposed container closure system, the polycarbonate (PC) bottle was selected for the primary 
packaging of the monovalent bulk active substance due to its resistance to storage at extreme 
conditions. Stability data provided demonstrate that the container is suitable for long-term storage of 
the monovalent bulk active substance, and that there are no components of the container closure 
system that affect the quality or the consistency of the product during such storage for up to 24 
months. 
No stability data are available for the clinical A/Vietnam/1203 monovalent bulk produced in 2005-
2006.  However, MedImmune has provided stability data from three monovalent LAIV bulks produced 
at the Speke UK facility generated in 2009 (pilot scale to obtain pivotal clinical trial material) in support 
of the H1N1 A/California/07/2009 pandemic stored in the intended container for 28 months and over.  
In addition, active substance stability data have been included from the 2012/2013 and 2014/2015 
influenza season which supports the current manufacturing process using the same container closure 
system. 
In conclusion the available experience and data on stability indicate that the active substance is 
sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf life in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The Finished product (FP) contains 7.0 ±0.5 log10FFU/0.2 mL dose of strain A/H5N1 
(A/Vietnam/1203/2004).  
Excipients in the finished product are sucrose, dibasic potassium phosphate, monobasic potassium 
phosphate, gelatin hydrolysate (gelatin <porcine, Type A>), arginine hydrochloride, and monosodium 
glutamate monohydrate. The volume of a single dose is 0.2 ml. The vaccine contains no preservative. 
The P/LAIV finished product is formulated from the pandemic monovalent bulk active substance. 
Because the P/LAIV formulation was developed based on the seasonal vaccine formulation, 
compatibility and the excipient concentration has been satisfactorily justified and further confirmed by 
clinical and process validation studies with Fluenz tetra. 
The excipients used are well controlled using Ph.Eur. and MedImmune methods and sufficient detail on 
the specifications has been provided. 
The container/closure system for the monovalent, attenuated influenza vaccine (P/LAIV) finished 
product is the Becton Dickinson (BD) Accuspray™ Nasal Spray System. The nasal spray system 
consists of a nasal sprayer barrel, nasal sprayer nozzle, plunger stopper and plunger rod. The same 
device is in use for the seasonal version of the vaccine (i.e. Fluenz tetra). 
Formulation development 
The pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccine (P/LAIV) vaccine formulation was established based on 
the quadrivalent (Fluenz tetra) formulation and was considered suitable for intranasal administration. 
Extensive experience has been gained with the quadrivalent (Fluenz tetra) formulation with respect to 
compatibility of the influenza vaccine monovalent bulk active substance and the excipients used in the 
finished product. The excipients and their concentrations are identical between P/LAIV and Fluenz 
tetra.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 16/92 
  
  
Further studies to optimize the grade of gelatin and pH studies for trivalent LAIV resulted in the current 
formulation for all LAIV formulations including the pandemic vaccine formulation. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is produced by MedImmune LLC, Philadelphia, PA, USA, and is released in the EU 
by MedImmune UK Limited, Speke, Liverpool, UK. 
The manufacturing process consists of thawing of the monovalent bulk, followed by a blending of the 
AS with concentrated Gelatin-Arginine-Glutamate (cGAG) buffer and dilution to final volume with 
Sucrose Phosphate (1X SP) buffer.   
The blended monovalent formulated bulk is aseptically filled as a 0.2 ml deliverable dose into 0.5 ml 
Accuspray nasal sprayer barrels, without any additional sterilisation step. The product is frozen at ≤  -
20°C prior to or after final packaging (with secondary labelling). The product is then transported to a 
warehouse prior to shipment. In the EU, the product is batch released by MedImmune UK Ltd, Speke, 
UK. 
Commercial batch size may vary and are based on forecasted demand.  
Critical steps in the manufacture of the finished product are controlled at several stages of the 
manufacturing process at both the blending and filling operations to ensure that the process performs 
as intended. Manufacturing controls are performed throughout the process. The process parameters 
are established based upon that of the Fluenz tetra process parameters. No in-process tests are 
performed during the manufacture of the finished product, which is accepted because the 
manufacturing controls and batch release tests/ specifications for the limited operations for finished 
product manufacture adequately assure product of consistent quality. 
Product specification 
Batch release tests are performed on samples collected at the bulk blend and filled blend stage for the 
pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccine (P/LAIV) to confirm conformance with the finished product 
specifications. Sterility is performed on the bulk P/LAIV blend. Lot-specific tests performed on 
filled/packaged P/LAIV blend are pH, potency (by Fluorescent Focus Assay), identity (Fluorescent Focus 
Assay), endotoxin, ovalbumin, total protein, colour, opalescence and appearance, sterility, and thermal 
stability. 
The analytical methods have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Potency is determined with the fluorescent focus assay 
(see under active substance). 
The potential impurities in the P/LAIV finished product are endotoxin, ovalbumin and other egg-derived 
proteins, and residual process and excipient components (Gentamicin Sulfate), which are also present 
for the seasonal influenza vaccine Fluenz tetra. 
The Endotoxin limits of ≤ 30 EU/mL (equivalent to 6 EU/human dose) and the ovalbumin limit of ≤ 1.2 
μg/mL (equivalent to 0.24 µg/human dose) are well below the Ph. Eur. requirements for inactivated 
influenza vaccines (NMT of <100 EU/human endotoxin per dose and NMT of 1 µg/human ovalbumin 
per dose). Gentamicin Sulfate is a component of the media used in the MVS manufacturing process. 
The theoretical concentration of Gentamicin Sulfate in the final product, based on dilutions used in the 
manufacture of the final product, is approximately 1x10-10 μg/ml. Such low levels of gentamicin 
sulfate are not detectable in the process using current assay methods and thus a corresponding 
specification has not been included. The control of potential impurities has been extensively discussed 
during MAA of Fluenz tetra and is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016

Batch analysis data (three validation batches from H1N1 pandemic finished product at commercial 
scale and three manufacturing batches of Fluenz tetra at commercial scale produced during 
2014/2015) were provided and are within the pre-set acceptance criteria with no apparent trends. 
However, as already discussed above, no commercial scale batch data are presented for H5N1 P/LAIV, 
which has been considered justified on the basis of the experience generated with the seasonal and the 
H1N1 Pandemic vaccine.  
There are no reference standards used in the release tests for P/LAIV, as defined by ICH Q6B (please 
also see active substance section).  
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life of the P/LAIV finished product is defined as up to 20 weeks at -25°C ± 5°C 
prior to distribution and subsequent storage at 2°C to 8°C not to exceed 18 weeks.  
According to the special precautions for storage the vaccine should be stored in a refrigerator and not 
be frozen. Before use, the vaccine may be taken out of the refrigerator once for a maximum period of 
12 hours at a temperature not above 25°C. If the vaccine has not been used after this 12 hour period, 
it should be discarded. These instruction are in line with the SmPC for Fluenz tetra. 
The claimed shelf life is not supported by H5N1 P/LAIV finished product data. Instead, data from the 
US-licensed H1N1 pandemic vaccine are presented, which were generated using the same container 
closure system as for the proposed commercial vaccine.  
It was considered that data provided from the monovalent H1N1 pandemic (2009) formulation did not 
support the claimed shelf life as all three lots were below specification prior to the end of the proposed 
shelf life. However, the Applicant has in the meantime developed and implemented a thermostability 
assay that allows detection of “thermolabile” HA molecules. This assay will be applied to all future new 
virus strains with the goal of preventing stability failures during the shelf life period. On the basis of 
this assay, the proposed shelf life for the H5N1 pandemic preparedness vaccine of 20 weeks at -25°C 
± 5°C (prior to distribution) and subsequent storage at 2°C - 8°C for not more than 18 weeks is 
considered acceptable in accordance with the seasonal vaccine counterparts. As requested by the 
CHMP, the Applicant will generate strain-specific stability data for the actual pandemic vaccine strain in 
order to define the shelf life on an evidence-based, strain-specific basis. This obligation will be 
reflected in the Annex II of the marketing authorisation. 
Adventitious agents 
Viral safety 
The master virus seed (MVS) is prepared by a plasmid rescue process and contains a specific 
constellation of viral gene segments from an attenuated Master Donor Virus (MDV) and a wild-type 
(wt) influenza virus.  
The MVS are used to inoculate Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) embryonated eggs to produce individual 
monovalent bulks. 
The viral safety is satisfactorily assured by i) quality/virological controls of raw materials of animal 
origin used during the process and ii) virological controls performed on cell substrates (Vero and CEK 
cells), SPF eggs and during the production process at MVS level and pooled harvest fluid level. 
TSE 
Raw materials of animal origin used in the production of P/LAIV are fetal bovine serum, new born calf 
serum and porcine trypsin, which were used for establishment of Vero cell banks and for culture of 
CEK. Gelatin of porcine origin is added as an excipient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016

In accordance with the Note for guidance on minimizing the risk of transmitting animal spongiform 
encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products (EMEA/410/01), Certificates of 
suitability for TSE safety have been provided for all raw materials derived from TSE relevant animal 
species used in the manufacturing process. 
Overall, sufficient data is provided to exclude a risk of TSE transmission through P/LAIV. The risk of 
transmitting TSE is thus considered very remote. 
GMO 
Like Fluenz Tetra, P/LAIV is a live attenuated influenza vaccine containing virus strains generated 
through reverse genetic technology. For this reason, the vaccine is classified a genetically modified 
organism (GMO) as defined in Directive 2001/18/EC.  
Please see section 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment for the assessment and 
conclusions on the environmental risk assessment. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The manufacturing process to be used for P/LAIV production of monovalent bulk active substance has 
been described in detail. It is the same as applied for the seasonal LAIV versions and no H5N1-specific 
process optimisation is proposed. The same holds true for the control testing scheme.  
The development of the manufacturing process and formulation of the finished product has been 
described in detail and the different process changes were highlighted. The batch formula has been 
adequately described and information on the required potency is provided. Furthermore, information 
on the volume range and the resulting doses is provided. Validation of the finished product 
manufacturing process was appropriately performed. Descriptions of the analytical methods as well as 
the validation studies were provided. The proposed specifications for the P/LAIV finished product are 
cosidered to be acceptable. However, no batch data have been provided for the H5N1 strain 
(A/Vietnam/1203) and the assessment is based on data generated from the seasonal tetravalent 
formulation and the monovalent H1N1 pandemic (2009) formulation, which has been discussed and 
considered to be acceptable. 
The proposed container closure system for the final product is acceptable and sufficient data 
supporting the suitability of the Accuspray™ Nasal Spray System were provided. 
The claimed finished product shelf life (up to 20 weeks at -25°C ± 5°C prior to distribution and storage 
at 2°C to 8°C for not more than 18 weeks) has not been supported with H5N1 P/LAIV finished product 
data. It was considered that data provided from the monovalent H1N1 pandemic (2009) formulation 
did not support the claimed shelf life as all three lots were below specification prior to the end of the 
proposed shelf life. This was not considered acceptable at day 120 of the procedure. However, the 
Applicant has in the meantime developed and implemented a thermostability assay that allows to 
detect “thermolabile” HA molecules and has confirmed that he will generate strain-specific stability 
data for the actual pandemic vaccine strain. On the basis of this commitment from the Applicant that 
will be reflected as an obligation in Annex II of the MA the CHMP agreed to the proposed finished 
product shelf life. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The CHMP has identified the following measure necessary to address the identified quality 
developments issues that may have a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product:

- to generate strain-specific stability data for any new pandemic vaccine strain. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP did not recommend any point for investigation at the time of opinion.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The P/LAIV H5N1 vaccine is intended to be delivered intranasally (IN) twice, separately by at least 4 
weeks, using a AccusprayTM device that delivers 0.2 mL/dose divided into each nostril (0.1 
mL/nostril). The vaccine is intended for prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic 
situation in children and adolescents from 12 months to less than 18 years of age. 
Non-clinical evaluation of ca A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) P/LAIV includes the immunogenicity and 
protective efficacy evaluation of this candidate vaccine in mice, ferrets and African green monkeys 
(AGMs), a repeat-dose toxicity study in ferrets, attenuated phenotype in chickens and ferrets and the 
neurotropism in mice. 
In addition, extensive supportive data from other P/LAIV candidates and from seasonal LAIVs are 
included in this application, to support general toxicity, reproductive toxicity aspect, as well as eye 
irritation and environmental safety of the candidate vaccine. 
A repeat-dose toxicity study with ca A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) P/LAIV was conducted in ferrets in 
compliance with GLP. In addition, a great majority of supportive toxicity studies were also GLP-
compliant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Non-clinical pharmacologic testing for ca A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) P/LAIV was the following: 
•  Testing for attenuated phenotypes in ferrets and mice by measuring replication of the vaccine 
viruses in the upper (nasal turbinates) and lower (lung) respiratory tracts. 
•  Testing for pathogenicity in chickens, and replication in brains of mice and ferrets using P/LAIV 
strains derived from H5N1 (safety pharmacology). 
•  Evaluation of immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the candidate vaccine against 
homologous and heterologous wt virus challenges in seronegative animals, including ferrets, 
mice, and African Green Monkeys (AGMs). 
•  Similar nonclinical studies performed on other P/LAIV candidates as supporting data 
[A/California/7/2009 (H1N1pdm09), A/chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97 (H9N2), A/Ann Arbor/6/60

Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Protective efficacy of the P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 candidate has been demonstrated in mouse, ferret, and 
non-human primate models.  
In pre-pubertal ferrets, the proposed 2-dose regime was able to completely protect challenged animals 
from wild-type virus replication in the lungs, either homologous (wt A/Vietnam/1203/2004) or 
heterologous (A/Indonesia/05/2005) H5N1 strains. Challenge virus titres in nasal turbinates were also 
significantly lower in the P/LAIV H5N1 VN04-vaccinated animals than those of mock-immunised ferrets 
following challenge with homologous or heterologous viruses. Similar was true for virus titres in brains. 
In the ferret model, low HAI and neutralisation titres were induced by ca H5N1 vaccines against 
respective homologous wt virus. Even lower functional antibody titres against heterologous wt H5N1 
virus were observed. Despite that, there was complete protection against viral replication in the lungs 
following homologous or heterologous wt H5N1 virus challenge. In this experiment, the control group 
vaccinated with ca H1N1 virus did not show detectable serum antibody titres against H5N1 viruses, 
and did not confer protection in wt H5N1 virus-challenged animals. The control was included to 
determine protection contributed by internal protein genes of the ca A/Ann Arbor/6/60 virus (which 
shared 6 internal protein genes with the ca H5N1 viruses). It is agreed that other immune responses 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 22/92 
  
  
 
 
such as cellular immune responses and mucosal IgA may also contribute to the protective efficacy of 
P/LAIV in this model. 
In adult African Green Monkeys, 2-dose regime at 1/5 the proposed dosage of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04, 
administered intranasally and intratracheally (each 1x106 TCID50) provided complete protection 
against homologous wild-type virus replication both in the respiratory tissues (lung, trachea, nasal 
turbinate) and in the secretion samples (tracheal lavage fluid, nasal pharyngeal swab). In this model a 
single dose of vaccine was ineffective. Serum hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) antibody, neutralising 
(MN) antibody and nasal wash IgA antibody were detected in the vaccinated animals. Notably, a 
correlation between serum antibody levels, especially MN, and the level of protection against virology 
endpoints was observed. Such correlation was not seen for nasal wash IgA response. The underlying 
mechanism(s) involved in protection has not been dissected. 
In compliance with previous scientific discussions with the Applicant, an array of ferret and monkey 
challenge studies conducted with P/LAIVs containing other subtypes, including H9, H2, H6, H7, as well 
as H1N1pdm09, were included in the H5N1 dossier as supportive evidence. Each vaccine candidate 
demonstrated a consistent pattern of efficacy in preventing homologous and heterologous wild-type 
virus challenge, although levels of serum antibodies varied by vaccine. In the ferret studies, a low level 
of serological responses does not necessarily indicate lack of protective efficacy, a finding consistent 
with the clinical observation made for Fluenz in clinical studies. 
In the Day 120 responses, the Applicant has provided references to published studies, which show that 
seasonal LAIV and P/LAIV H7N7 induce cellular immune responses in animals. Based on the similarities 
between these vaccines and P/LAIV H5N1, the Applicant expects that P/LAIV H5N1 is able to induce 
both humoral and cellular immune responses in animals. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies are generally not performed with vaccines and were not 
performed with P/LAIV. As the vaccine did not show any effects apart from the expected immune 
response, this was considered acceptable.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies were performed with the LAIV construct to investigate its neurotropism in 
mice and ferrets, viral replication in chickens and mice, and lethality in mice. Different influenza strains 
were used, such as the wt and ca H5N1 and H7N7, and seasonal strains (Fluenz). Overall these studies 
showed that the cold attenuated vaccine virus is not able to replicate in the respiratory tract and brain, 
and was not pathogenic. 
Specifically the vaccine virus was non-pathogenic for chickens after intravenous administration. In 
mice, the vaccine virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract was significantly lower than 
that of the wild-type H5N1 virus, with no vaccine virus being detected in the brain of mice. In ferrets, 
the vaccine virus can replicate in the upper respiratory tract, but was not detected in the lower 
respiratory tract or brain of this animal species. 
No other safety pharmacology studies have been conducted. However, some relevant endpoints (heart 
and respiration rate) have been included in the toxicological studies with repeat dosing. No vaccine-
related adverse changes to these parameters have been reported. Even though the measured 
endpoints are limited, the safety pharmacology evaluation is considered sufficient, given the extensive 
clinical data available with the seasonal live attenuated influenza vaccines (Fluenz and Fluenz Tetra), 
which have a similar construct to P/LAIV. 
Assessment report

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been conducted with P/LAIV, in accordance with 
“Note for Guidance on Preclinical Pharmacological and Toxicological Testing of Vaccines” 
(CPMP/SWP/465/95) and with “Guideline on Adjuvants in Vaccines for human use” 
(CHMP/VEG/134716/2004). Clinical studies are available to confirm the safety, tolerability and 
immunogenicity of Fluenz administered concurrently with measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), varicella 
and oral polio vaccines in young children. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Typical pharmacokinetic studies including absorption, metabolism, and excretion do not pertain to live 
vaccines and are therefore not provided. Local deposition and distribution studies have been performed 
in humans with Fluenz. The characteristics of the intranasal spray were also evaluated in a series of 
studies which evaluated properties such as density, viscosity, surface tension, droplet size and spray 
pattern. Together, these studies define the pharmacokinetic profile of Fluenz and the results are 
considered of value also for P/LAIV. Moreover the live attenuated vaccine construct does not contain 
an adjuvant or new excipients which would require other pharmacokinetics studies. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
One GLP-compliant repeat dose toxicology study was conducted in ferrets to support safety of ca 
A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) vaccine. This study also evaluated local tolerance and toxicity after a 
single vaccination. 
In addition, 8 GLP-compliant and 2 non-GLP toxicology studies conducted with other P/LAIV strains, or 
with trivalent LAIV (T/LAIV) and quadrivalent LAIV (Q/LAIV), are provided in this application: 
• 
Five repeat-dose toxicity studies in ferrets; three reproductive and developmental toxicity 
studies (two in rats and one in ferrets), and two eye irritation studies in rabbits; 
•  All P/LAIV, the Q/LAIV, and the FluMist/Fluenz were administered IN and at the intended 
human dose (exceptions: in eye irritation studies FluMist/Fluenz was instilled into the 
conjunctival sac).

Single dose toxicity and Repeat dose toxicity 
Formal single-dose toxicity studies with H5N1 or other strains of pandemic potential were evaluated as 
part of repeat-dose toxicity studies in ferrets (Studies SVT08-10, 077-09-001, SVT06-11, 077-08-001, 
SVT08-18, SVT01-18).  
One pivotal GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted to assess local and systemic 
toxicity of the proposed 2-dose regime of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 in ferrets over a 35 day period. A higher 
dosage (109 TCID50) was also tested. In this study, the vaccine was administered in 0.5 ml, i.e. 0.25 
ml/nare. Overall, the candidate vaccine was safe and well tolerated. There were no vaccine-related 
toxicities in any of the parameters measured, with the exception of a dose-dependent 
bronchointerstitial inflammation in the lungs of vaccinated animals at Day 3. The severity of 
inflammation decreased by Day 35, which is suggestive of an ongoing resolving process. The cause for 
this observation might be an inappropriate vaccine dose volume (0.5 mL) for the ferret species, which 
led to vaccine virus deposition into the lungs, since subsequent investigation revealed that 
administration of the same vaccine titre in a smaller volume (0.025 mL/nare) elicited only a minimal 
inflammatory response in a fewer number of ferrets.

EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 25/92 
  
  
 
An additional vaccine-related histopathology finding was an acute inflammation in nasal turbinates at 
Day 3, resolving by Day 35, as well as a prominent lymphocytic hyperplasia in cervical lymph nodes 
noted at Day 35 but not Day 3. These changes should be considered as a reflection of immune 
stimulation following administration of a live virus, and were not considered unexpected.  
A number of non-clinical safety studies conducted with other P/LAIV candidates and seasonal LAIVs, 
including Q/LAIV and Fluenz, were submitted as supportive evidence. A similar safe and well-tolerated 
profile was consistently seen in these supportive studies. Histopathology findings in some studies 
(related to H7N7, H2N2 and H6N1) included inflammation of the basal turbinate which initially was 
considered as vaccine-related. However, a retrospective detailed microscopical evaluation in control 
animals suggested that nasal turbinate enlargement is a normal developmental feature of the growing 
ferrets, irrespective of inflammation in nasal tissues or inflammatory exudate in the nasal cavity. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Studies evaluating mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of P/LAIV were not conducted as they are not 
normally required for viral vaccines in line with the available guidelines (EMA guideline 
CPMP/SWP/465/95 and EMA draft Non-clinical and Clinical Module of the Influenza Guideline; WHO 
Guidelines on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 927, 2005). That is 
because vaccine antigens, in general, are not considered to have genotoxicity potential or carcinogenic 
effect based on their chemical structure, mechanism of action and lack of repeated chronic 
administration. Specifically for LAIVs, wild-type or att influenza viruses are not considered to be 
mutagenic or carcinogenic based on observation from naturally occurring cases of influenza and on 
previous experience with LAIVs. No mutagenic or carcinogenic effects of LAIVs have been observed in 
any of the nonclinical or clinical studies conducted to date with LAIVs.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Dedicated developmental toxicity studies with P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 or other pandemic vaccine 
candidates were not performed. This is consistent with previous discussions with the Applicant and is 
considered acceptable in light of the existing evidence. Existing data from reproductive and 
developmental toxicology studies generated with Fluenz tetra and Fluenz in rats and ferrets was 
submitted as supportive evidence and did not reveal maternal toxicities or teratogenic effects. The two 
influenza vaccines did not affect reproduction and development in rats and ferrets. Further, the F0 
generation females and the F1 generation offspring were unaffected by Fluenz Tetra and Fluenz. These 
studies were assessed and are considered relevant for P/LAIV. 
As noted in the Note for Guidance on Preclinical Pharmacological and Toxicological testing of Vaccines 
(CPMP/SWP/465/95) testing in juvenile animals is not required for vaccines. Repeated dose toxicity 
studies were performed in prepubertal animals. Appropriate clinical data are available.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Not applicable 
Local Tolerance  
No dedicated local tolerance studies have been conducted with P/LAIV. However the site of vaccination 
with ca Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) was evaluated in ferrets in repeat-dose toxicity study (Study 
SVT06-11). Additionally, evaluation of the site of vaccination was performed in studies with other 
P/LAIVs and Q/LAIV as part of repeat-dose toxicity studies. There were no adverse vaccine-related 
findings. 
In addition, evaluation of local tolerance at the administration site was included in the Fluenz repeated 
dose toxicity study with the evaluation of the nasal mucosa with similar results. Furthermore the 
Assessment report

potential for ocular toxicity resulting from the inadvertent instillation into the eye was evaluated in two 
Fluenz ocular toxicity studies performed in rabbits. A standard Draize test was performed in two 
separate studies using the frozen and refrigerated formulations of Fluenz. Neither study elicited results 
consistent with ocular toxicity. 
Other toxicity studies 
No other toxicity studies were performed.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) submitted for P/LAIV is built on the ERA that was submitted 
in the MAA for Fluenz Tetra (Q/LAIV), which was in itself based on the ERA submitted in the MAA for 
Fluenz (T/LAIV). The majority of the studies included in the ERA were performed with Fluenz. All these 
vaccine formulations are prepared by reverse genetics techniques and are therefore considered GMOs. 
A series of environmental safety studies with Fluenz designed to evaluate the tropism of the vaccine 
for nonhuman species were conducted in 21 animal species.   
Replication of vaccine viruses was measured in respiratory tissues. The vaccine viruses did not 
replicate in any bird species, which is consistent with the ts phenotype of vaccine viruses and the 
relatively high body temperature of birds. In mammals, replication of the vaccine viruses was only 
noted in hamsters, guinea pigs, and ferrets. These species have been shown previously to be 
experimentally infected with human influenza virus. Collectively, the results of these studies 
demonstrated that the vaccine viruses do not have novel tropism for nonhuman species. Evaluation of 
a number of experimentally created reassortants (genetic reassortment between wt and vaccine 
strains) in a ferret model indicated that such reassortment is not likely to create viruses with new 
properties compared with either progenitor and is more likely that the reassortant would also be 
attenuated. The overall risk posed by Fluenz or Fluenz tetra to human health and the environment was 
considered low or negligible. These vaccines do not replicate freely in the environment and moreover 
they are specific to humans and a few mammalian species (see above); they do not carry a toxic 
transgene, do not integrate in the genome and therefore it is very unlikely that they could transfer 
genes to any other species. 
Based on the similarities between the authorised seasonal LAIV (Fluenz and Fluenz Tetra) and P/LAIV, 
and the fact that all three products are manufactured, transported, and administered under the same 
controlled conditions, and the genetic stability is comparable (see the quality section), no increased 
environmental risk is anticipated for P/LAIV compared to Fluenz and Fluenz Tetra.  
Human-adapted seasonal or pandemic influenza virus strains are characterised by a marked restriction 
to the human host, i.e. effective transmission to other species is unlikely or limited due to lack of 
receptor specificity for the HA ligand in hosts other than humans. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 27/92 
  
  
 
The same host restriction applies to LAIVs derived from either seasonal or pandemic human wild-type 
influenza strains. Thus, health threats for humans exposed to these vaccines within the approved 
indication (age and epidemiological context) are predictable and minimal. 
Risks for non-human species through the massive use of LAIVs are also negligible, provided that these 
vaccines are correctly used within a seasonal or pandemic context as per respective indication. 
LAIVs that contain HA/NA combinations not occurring in circulating human influenza viruses must not 
be used outside of a well-controlled setting. 
LAIVs that contain pandemic HA/NA surface antigens which will be used during a duly recognised 
pandemic have the same low risk factors as seasonal LAIVs. 
Based on all the above elements and considerations, the pandemic LAIV construct evaluated in this 
dossier is acceptable from an environmental safety point of view. 
At the time of the assessment of the MAA for Fluenz Tetra, the initial environmental risk assessment 
(ERA) was considered to remain relevant for future seasonal strains of Fluenz tetra, since the simple 
change in strain to be included in the vaccine is not expected to alter the ERA profile of the vaccine. 
This rational and conclusion is considered relevant also for P/LAIV, hence submission of an ERA at each 
strain update procedure following pandemic declaration is not required for the same reason expressed 
above for Fluenz Tetra, with all reserves of new scientific information publication on the ERA for this 
kind of vaccine.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The proof-of-protection for P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 candidate vaccine has been adequately demonstrated in 
different animal models, including ferrets and African Green Monkeys. The consistent demonstration of 
protection in several P/LAIV studies and supportive studies with other strains provides reasonable 
reassurance about the overall performance of this LAIV-based pandemic vaccine. 
The immunogenicity of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 was explored more broadly in AGMs than in ferrets, with a 
correlation observed in AGMs between serum antibody levels (especially neutralising antibodies) and 
level of protection. In the ferret model it was noted that in the absence of detectable HAI titre induced 
by H1N1 vaccine, the vaccine provided no protection, and lower HAI titres induced by the P/LAIV H5N1 
vaccine provided full protection. 
The general toxicity of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 and other candidates was studied in ferrets. These studies 
consistently showed that the safety profile of P/LAIV candidates was similar and did not differ from that 
of the seasonal LAIVs (Fluenz and Fluenz Tetra). 
The neurovirulence potential of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 candidate appears unlikely, based on the existing 
non-clinical data available and the completed phase I clinical trials. 
The formulation of a pandemic monovalent vaccine does not change the risk to the environment with 
respect to the seasonal Fluenz or Fluenz Tetra formulations, which were already evaluated. The 
manufacturing procedures are identical for the 3 vaccine constructs and the genetic stability is 
comparable.  
In summary, it is considered that the non-clinical pharmacological and toxicological testing is extensive 
and complete. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 28/92 
  
  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacological program for ca Vietnam/1203/2004 P/LAIV H5N1 is considered adequate in terms 
of study conduct and quality of results, and the studies have provided proof-of-concept for protective 
efficacy of this candidate vaccine. The non-clinical toxicology data did not reveal any specific safety 
issues. The non-clinical investigation is overall satisfactory and therefore the application is approvable 
from a non-clinical perspective.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The purpose of this Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) is to seek approval of a Pandemic Live 
Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (P/LAIV manufactured by MedImmune) for the prophylaxis of influenza in 
children and adolescents from 12 months to less than 18 years of age. P/LAIV is an intranasally 
administered vaccine that contains a live reassortant A/H5N1 strain of influenza virus. This vaccine 
represents a pandemic preparedness vaccine, i.e. it is authorised in advance of a pandemic based on a 
core dossier that includes a minimum set of data to define the benefit risk balance, with appropriate 
specific obligations that the Applicant is requested to fulfil at the time of the next pandemic. Thus the 
vaccine can only be administered after a pandemic is duly recognised. When a pandemic is recognised 
by WHO or the EU, a variation application will be submitted to include the declared pandemic strain in 
the vaccine. This strategy ensures a faster availability of pandemic vaccines during a pandemic. 
P/LAIV contains the same type of components as currently included in the EU approved vaccine for 
seasonal influenza, Fluenz Tetra, and differs only in the fact that it is a monovalent formulation 
containing a single type A influenza virus strain with pandemic potential. Otherwise the two vaccines 
are produced by the same manufacturing process, use the same attenuated master donor virus and 
excipients, are blended with the same potency specification: 107.0 ± 0.5 fluorescent focus units (FFU) 
per strain, and are administered intranasally using the same Becton Dickinson (BD) Accuspray™ 
device.  
Immunogenicity or safety paediatric studies of pandemic candidate vaccines may not be conducted in 
an interpandemic period due to feasibility and ethical reasons. Paediatric studies foreseen in the 
paediatric investigational plan for P/LAIV have been deferred until the time of the next pandemic. 
Therefore, efficacy and safety of the P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 preparedness vaccine is to be predicted based 
on immunogenicity and safety data generated in naïve adults, with the support of additional non-
clinical and clinical data generated with other P/LAIV candidates, and efficacy, safety and effectiveness 
data of already authorised seasonal and H1N1 pandemic LAIV vaccines. The seasonal LAIVs are Fluenz, 
the trivalent seasonal formulation (T/LAIV) which was withdrawn in 2013, and the new quadrivalent 
formulation Fluenz Tetra (Q/LAIV), currently authorised. The H1N1 pandemic LAIV was authorised in 
the US and used in the 2009 pandemic. 
Indeed, also given the limited understanding of how immunity works for LAIVs, the data bridging for 
this dossier is indeed supported by the large body of safety and efficacy data generated with the 
seasonal influenza vaccines and on the clinical experience (effectiveness data) generated with the 
seasonal formulations and with the H1N1-based P/LAIV (see also section 2.5).

narratives without published literatures were available, as agreed upfront with the Applicant. The CIR 
293 study is still on-going, and interim immunogenicity data were submitted during the procedure. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
P/LAIV is a monovalent live attenuated virus vaccine composed of a H5N1 reassortant influenza virus 
strain that is expected to replicate locally in the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and to induce 
both localized and systemic immune responses. Since classical pharmacokinetic studies do not pertain 
to this type of product, clinical pharmacology studies have included assessment of vaccine-induced 
immune responses and characterization of the in vivo deposition and distribution of intranasally 
administered vaccine vehicle.  
Study PPL-1014  
The Applicant provided data from one biodistribution study (Study PPL-1014) of two formulations and 
volumes of FluMist-like vaccine applied by Becton Dickinson Accuspray to demonstrate tissue 
deposition and clearance. 
The two formulations were: 
• 
FluMist placebo: 2* 0.25 mL of frozen vehicle formulation with sucrose-phosphate-glutamate 
(SPG) buffer  
•  CAIV placebo: 2* 0.1 mL of refrigerated vehicle formulation with SPG buffer, arginine and 
partially hydrolyzed porcine gelatin 
Vehicle formulations were mixed with the radiolabelled marker 99mTechnetium 
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA). 
The regions of interest regarding deposition and clearance were: 
•  Nasal cavity and adjacent tissue 
•  Brain 
• 
Lower respiratory tract 
In vivo distribution was determined using standard 2-dimensional gamma scintigraphy nuclear imaging 
as commonly used for ventilation scans. 
The study was a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover study in 21 adults. 
The primary objective was assessment and comparison of the deposition patterns in the nasal cavity; 
the secondary objective was the quantification of the clearance over a 4 hour period after application. 
A minimal wash-out time of 44h was allowed before the cross-over. MRI scans were done before the 
application to provide clear anatomical information before the scintigraphy. 
For distribution evaluations, scintigraphic data were presented as percentage of the delivered dose. 
The delivered dose was defined as the formulation that had left the device (and any attachments) and 
been deposited in the subjects (i.e. it does not include any residual material remaining in the sprayer 
after administration).  
Results 
In summary, the majority of the dose of a radiolabelled vaccine vehicle delivered by the same device 
used to deliver P/LAIV or FluMist was deposited in the nasal cavity with little or no measurable 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 31/92 
  
  
deposition in the lower airways and lungs, which is consistent with the relatively large droplet size of 
the spray material. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics of a vaccine relate to its interaction with the immune system. 
Mechanism of action 
The influenza virus strain in Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 MedImmune is (a) cold adapted (ca); 
(b) temperature sensitive (ts); and (c) attenuated (att). The live attenuated virus included in the 
vaccine must infect and replicate in cells lining the nasopharynx of the vaccine recipient in order to 
induce protective immunity. 
Natural immunity to wild-type influenza results primarily from both serum (primarily IgG) and mucosal 
(primarily secretory IgA) antibodies, produced in response to virus exposure. Serum antibodies are 
primarily responsible for lower respiratory tract protection and are the most commonly measured 
correlate of protection from illness. Local mucosal antibodies are critical for protection of the upper 
respiratory tract and may be more important to overall protection against infection. In addition to 
humoral immunity, cytotoxic T-cell responses play a significant role in recovery from illness and viral 
clearance, and innate immune responses, such as the production of interferon, also contribute to 
protection from influenza. 
P/LAIV is designed to induce an immune response that resembles the response generated by wild-type 
influenza infection, without causing influenza disease. In contrast, inactivated influenza virus vaccines 
(IV) primarily stimulate a serum antibody response to specific viral surface antigens contained in the 
vaccine. The greatest response is seen in already primed individuals who have had previous 
immunologic exposure to wild-type influenza virus. 
Immunological correlates of protection have not been established for LAIVs. The most extensive 
immunogenicity data relate to serum haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses. These 
responses seem to vary significantly depending on age and prior experience with influenza, with more 
robust responses typically observed in very young, seronaïve, unprimed children. Although the 
presence of a serum antibody response has been shown to be predictive for protection, the absence of 
an antibody response following LAIV like FluMist/Fluenz vaccination does not reflect the absence of 
protection, as clinical efficacy studies have shown protection in the absence of significant antibody 
responses (Belshe, March 2000). It is likely that immune mechanisms other than influenza-specific 
serum antibodies contribute to protection conferred by LAIVs (e.g. mucosal antibodies, cell-mediated 
immunity). Additionally, the protective immune responses may be different in young, unprimed, 
seronegative children compared to older children and adults. 
P/LAIV is produced in the same way as Fluenz Tetra and Fluenz/Flumist, but with a single virus strain. 
Because of the similarity with these other LAIVs, the current MAA is to a large degree based on efficacy 
data from Fluenz/Flumist in addition to data obtained from studies using H1N1v LAIV, as well as data 
from candidate vaccines with a range of different Influenza A subtypes with pandemic potential. A 
general problem with using immunogenicity (HAI, NAI, neutralisation assays) for bridging of data for 
LAIVs is the lack of correlation with protection against disease.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Classical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies do not pertain to P/LAIV, because the 
mechanism of action involves local and systemic immune responses induced by vaccine virus 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 32/92 
  
  
replication in the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract. The immunogenicity studies that form the 
basis for this application are included in the Clinical Efficacy section together with the data on clinical 
efficacy from the other LAIVs. Therefore also the methodology used to evaluate immunogenicity of 
P/LAIV is discussed in the Clinical efficacy section. 
A biodistribution study (Study PPL-1014) of intranasally administered radiolabelled vaccine buffer was 
submitted. In brief, the initial deposition and clearance of frozen and refrigerated vehicle (i.e., 
excipient only) formulations of FluMist that were mixed with a radiolabelled 99mtechnetium 
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) marker were evaluated by gamma scintigraphy 
nuclear imaging in a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover study in 21 adults. In summary, the 
majority of the dose of a radiolabelled vaccine vehicle delivered by the same device used to deliver 
P/LAIV or FluMist was deposited in the nasal cavity with little or no measurable deposition in the lower 
airways and lungs, which is consistent with the relatively large droplet size of the spray material. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
A tissue deposition and clearance study has been performed with FluMist/Fluenz, but the results are 
equally relevant for the deposition and clearance of P/LAIV in the nasal cavity. The majority of the 
refrigerated dose of a radiolabelled vaccine vehicle was deposited in the nasal cavity, with little or no 
measurable deposition in the lower airways and lungs, consistent with the relatively large droplet size 
of the spray material. This pattern of deposition is acceptable because is in line with the intended 
mechanism of action of the vaccine, i.e. replication restricted to the upper respiratory tract, and the 
lungs are not reached by the vaccine virus.  
No other pharmacology studies have been conducted with P/LAIV; the immunogenicity studies are 
considered in the following section. This is acceptable for vaccines and more specifically is in line with 
what has been done for other similar vaccines (Flumist/Fluenz and Fluenz Tetra). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Data demonstrating formal clinical efficacy of P/LAIV could not be generated since efficacy of a 
pandemic vaccine cannot be tested in the absence of a circulating pandemic virus. Instead, the 
expected efficacy of P/LAIV in the claimed indication against pandemic influenza is inferred based on 
the following data:   
1.  Immunogenicity data gathered from adult clinical studies performed with candidate P/LAIVs; 
2.  Immunogenicity data gathered from adult clinical studies in which an inactivated pandemic 
vaccine was administered to unmask the long-lasting immunity induced by prior receipt of 
P/LAIV; 
3.  Effectiveness data in children gathered with the H1N1pdm P/LAIV during the 2009 Pandemic;  
4.  Clinical efficacy data obtained with Fluenz in immunologically naïve young children. 
Concerning immunogenicity studies in adults, in the context of pandemic preparedness activities, the 
Applicant has participated in a Collaborative Research and Development agreement (CRADA) with the 
US National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2005. Under this agreement the candidate vaccines were 
manufactured by the Applicant and assessed in immunogenicity clinical trials for influenza subtypes by 
NIH. Subtypes with a potential to cause pandemic, including H5, H2, H6, H7, and H9, were 
investigated and subsequently submitted as pivotal evidence for the current application. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 33/92 
  
  
Therefore the pandemic clinical development program of P/LAIV is based on 3 pivotal adult studies 
with H5N1 strains (CIR217, CIR239 and CIR 277) and 10 supportive adult studies conducted with other 
potential pandemic strains (H2N2, H2N3, H6N1, H7N3 (2 studies), H7N7 (2 studies), H7N9 (2 studies), 
H9N2).  
Given i) the known lack for LAIVs of a clear correlation between immunogenicity and protection, and ii) 
the restriction in replication and immune responses of the pandemic vaccine viruses, which may be 
attributable to the fact that these viruses are derived from pandemic strains not optimally adapted for 
human transmission, it was considered that a subsequent administration of an inactivated antigen 
could reveal whether the primary series of LAIV had induced robust and long-lasting B-cell memory 
response. Such memory B-cell response would allow for a rapid increase in high quality antibody titres 
upon re-challenge with an inactivated pandemic antigen even for those vaccines for which immune 
responses were difficult to detect at all in the original studies (i.e. H5N1, H7N7 and H7N9). These 
strains were therefore tested in prime-boost studies, as further clarified below. 
Concerning the pivotal studies, the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) isolate was used in study CIR 217, 
and the A/Hong Kong/213/2003 (H5N1) isolate in study CIR 239. To prove the ability of the H5N1 
P/LAIV to prime naïve subjects, subjects that received P/LAIV in clinical trials CIR 217 and CIR 239 
were subsequently enrolled in Study CIR 277, where they were vaccinated with an inactivated non-
adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine. The immune responses to the inactivated vaccine provide useful information 
on the ability of P/LAIV to prime various age groups against a poorly immunogenic strain to which 
most, if not all, are naive. This study design was agreed in preliminary discussions with the Applicant 
as it is considered useful as an indirect proof of the potential for protection of a pandemic LAIV in the 
absence of efficacy data in the interpandemic period. It should not be considered as indicative for the 
definition of the LAIV posology in pandemic settings. 
Concerning the supportive 10 additional adult studies, three of these followed the prime-boost concept 
mentioned above (URMC11-001, URMC13-001 and CIR293), i.e. to evaluate the immunogenicity 
response following the administration of an inactivated pandemic vaccine in subjects previously 
vaccinated with a P/LAIV candidate vaccine (only H7N7 and H7N9 strains). The study CIR293 is still 
ongoing.  
In addition, the P/LAIV body of evidence benefits from the effectiveness data gathered from two safety 
and immunogenicity placebo-controlled trials with the 2009 pandemic LAIV (H1N1 
A/California/7/2009), which were conducted in 2009 with adults and children and were submitted with 
this application as supportive. In addition effectiveness data gathered during the last pandemic with 
the 2009 pandemic LAIV was considered supportive of this application.  
Finally, the many efficacy and safety studies conducted in children with the seasonal T/LAIV are also 
considered supportive of the P/LAIV application because all these vaccines (including the P/LAIV 2009) 
are manufactured using the same process, administered through the same route, and studied primarily 
in naïve individuals.  
Pre-authorisation immunogenicity paediatric studies of pandemic candidate vaccines are not required 
to be conducted in an interpandemic period due to feasibility and ethical reasons. 
Summary of analytical methods used in the immunogenicity studies 
A variety of assays were used in the CRADA studies in adults to assess the immunogenicity of the 
candidate vaccines. All studies evaluated serum haemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) antibodies and 
microneutralisation (MN) antibody responses. In most studies antibody responses were also measured 
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to the homologous HA, to measure serum IgG and 
IgA, and nasal wash IgA and by detection of antibody secreting cells (ASCs) to vaccine virus. Some 
studies also looked at markers of B-cell activation (cluster of differentiation [CD]27+CD38+). Antibody

responses were measured prior to vaccination and after the first and second doses of vaccine (for 
studies evaluating a 2-dose regimen). Serum was obtained for HAI, MN, IgG and IgA approximately 1 
month after each dose while ASCs were evaluated approximately 7 days after dosing. 
All the immunoassays were performed by the laboratories of study sites or contracted research 
organisations. No centralised laboratory was employed for the P/LAIV study programme. Analysis of 
samples from clinical studies conducted under the CRADA with the NIH were performed at two 
academic clinical study sites that have extensive experience in conducting influenza studies: 1) The 
Centre for Immunization Research (CIR) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School for Public Health, in 
Baltimore, and 2) the University of Rochester Medical Centre (URMC), Rochester, NY.  
Assessment of Viral Shedding 
For studies performed at the CIR at the Johns Hopkins University, nasal washes were obtained prior to 
vaccination and then daily from the day of vaccination until the day of discharge. Daily throat swabs 
were also obtained in studies of the low dose (106.7 TCID50) of the ca A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) 
vaccine. Specimens were tested for the presence of vaccine virus by quantitative viral culture on MDCK 
cells and using a rRT-PCR assay that amplified a portion of the influenza type A M2 gene, as previously 
described (Karron et al, 2009). The sensitivity of the rRT-PCR assay for vaccine virus was 
approximately 100.5 TCID50/mL of nasal wash. For studies performed at URMC, nasal swab specimens 
were tested for vaccine viruses by quantitative viral culture in MDCK cells at 33°C and by quantitative 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) amplification (Shchrebik et al, 2014). The 
limit of viral detection was 100.6 TCID50/mL for virus culture and 100.4 TCID50/mL for qRT-PCR. 
Serum Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay (HAI) 
Sera were tested for HAI antibodies to H5N1 virus using horse red blood cells (RBC) for the ca 
A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) (Study CIR 217) and turkey RBC for the ca A/Hong Kong/213/2003 
(H5N1) (Study CIR 239), as previously described (Stephenson et al, 2004; Clements et al, 1983). For 
Study CIR 277, in which subjects received H5N1 P/LAIV followed by inactivated H5N1 vaccine, the HAI 
assay was performed at the Southern Research Institute (Birmingham, AL), using wt influenza ca 
A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) in an enhanced biosafety level 3 containment laboratory. HAI assays 
were performed according to standard procedures (Stephenson et al, 2004), using horse erythrocytes. 
Use of the wild-type homologous and/or heterologous pandemic influenza viruses was only noted in 
two prime-boost studies (CIR277, URMC11-001). 
A serum HAI or MN response (seroconversion) was defined as ≥4-fold increase in titres from the 
baseline for all of the P/LAIV studies. The same criterion was also used for a serum IgG or IgA or a 
nasal IgA response for all studies, but URMC 10-002 and URMC 10-003 which used ≥2-fold rise for 
serum IgG and/or nasal IgA. 
Microneutralisation Assay 
For the ca A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) and the ca A/Hong Kong/213/2003 (H5N1) studies (CIR 217 
and CIR 239, respectively), sera were tested for neutralizing antibodies using a modified version of a 
previously described microneutralisation (MN) assay, in which titres of neutralizing antibody to vaccine 
virus were assessed (Karron et al, 2009). For Study CIR 277, in which subjects received H5N1 P/LAIV 
followed by inactivated vaccine, the MN assay was performed at Southern Research Institute 
(Birmingham, AL), using wt A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) in an enhanced biosafety level 3 
containment laboratory. MN assays were performed according to previously described methods (Rowe 
et al, 1999; Walls et al, 1986). Neutralizing antibody activity against different clades of influenza 
A/H5N1 was analysed by MN based on the methods of the pandemic influenza reference laboratory of 
the CDC (Rowe et al, 1999). Reverse genetics (RG)-derived influenza A/H5N1 representing different 
clades of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 A/ goose/Guangdong/1/96 lineage, engineered to

delete the virulence motif, were obtained from St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital (SJCRH; 
Memphis, TN), the CDC, and the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (Potters Bar, 
United Kingdom): A/ Vietnam/1203/2004 (SJCRH, clade 1), A/Indonesia/5/2005 (PR8-IBCDC-RG2; 
clade 2.1.3.2), A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 (NIBRG-23; clade 2.2.1), A/Anhui/1/05 (IBCDC-RG5, clade 
2.3.4), and A/Egypt/3072/2010 (IBCDC-RG29; clade 2.2.1). The assays were conducted with 3 
replicates of each serum sample and were performed at least twice. 
Assays validation 
Serum haemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) and microneutralisation (MN) assays were the basic 
measure of vaccine immunogenicity for all the P/LAIV studies. No validated assays were used in clinical 
development programme. Extensively qualified HAI and MN assays were used for CIR277, but not for 
CIR217 and CIR239. It was noted that the same qualified assays are used for the prime-boost H7N9 
CIR293 study to evaluate booster response to wild-type antigens.  
While qualified assays were not run for pivotal Studies CIR 217 and CIR 239, HAI and MN 
seroconversion rates in both of these studies were low ranging, from 0% to 10%; as a result, despite 
the known variability of these assays across testing sites, it is unlikely that spuriously elevated results 
were obtained or that use of a qualified assay would have yielded different results. 
For the supportive URMC 11-001 study (H7N7 prime-boost study) no qualification report was 
submitted, however the Applicant was able to confirm that the US CDC, who performed the MN 
serology, used an MN assay that was fully qualified with rigorous quality control measures and 
performance monitoring. 
The CHMP deemed that the overall evidence of assay performance was acceptable for the current 
application (see the discussion on clinical efficacy for further details), and further recommended for 
completeness and confirmation that the Applicant submits validation reports of the HAI and MN assays 
for study CIR 277 as a post-marketing commitment, which was agreed. 
Neuraminidase Inhibition Assay 
Neuraminidase-specific antibodies were measured by a previously described miniaturized 
neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) assay (Sandbulte et al, 2009). Measurement of NAI titres requires the 
use of a virus with an irrelevant HA so that anti-HA antibodies do not interfere with the detection of 
anti-NA antibodies. Therefore, two H6N2 reassortant viruses were generated, containing the HA from 
an A/Teal/W312/HK/97 (H6N1) virus and the N2 NA of the A/Uruguay/716/007 (H3N2) virus that was 
representative of viruses circulating at the time of the clinical trial or the N2 NA of the ca A/Ann 
Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) virus. The A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2) strain was the A/Brisbane/10/2007-like 
H3N2 component of the seasonal LAIV in 2008–2009. Briefly, the NA activity of each virus was 
standardized by colorimetric analysis of sialic acid released from the substrate fetuin. NAI activity in 
the sera was determined by comparing the NA activity of the virus alone with the activity measured 
following incubation of the virus with serially diluted sera. The dilution of serum that resulted in a 50% 
reduction in NA activity of the virus without serum was recorded as the NAI titre. 
Serum IgG and Nasal IgA Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays 
For the ca A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) and the ca A/Hong Kong/213/2003 (H5N1) studies (CIR 217 
and CIR 239, respectively), sera were tested for IgG and IgA antibody to the ca A/Vietnam/1203/2004 
(H5N1) HA by ELISA. Immulon 2 plates were coated with 30 ng/well of recombinant baculovirus-
expressed H5 VN2004 HA (Protein Sciences, Meriden, CT), and the ELISA was performed using 
endpoint titration (Clements et al, 1983). A subset of sera was also tested for IgA antibody to 
recombinant baculovirus-expressed H1 A/New Caledonia/20/99 and H7 A/Netherlands/219/03 HA 
(Protein Sciences, Meriden, CT). Nasal wash specimens were concentrated and were tested using the

same antigen to measure vaccine-specific IgA, expressed as a percent of total IgA (Clements et al, 
1983). 
Antibody-secreting Cells 
In some studies, blood circulating IgGs and/or IgA antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) specific for vaccine 
virus were measured 7 days after dosing. 
For the ca A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) and the ca A/Hong Kong/213/2003 (H5N1) studies (CIR 217 
and CIR 239, respectively), total and influenza vaccine-specific IgG and IgA ASCs were measured 
using an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay (Sasaki et al, 2007). Briefly, the assay differed 
from the published assay in that the wells were coated with one of the following: 1) rH5 
A/Vietnam/1203/2004 HA protein diluted to 10 μg/mL in Dulbecco’s PBS (D-PBS; Invitrogen); 2) beta-
propiolactone treated H5N1/AA ca vaccine virus; 3) beta-propiolactone-treated ca A/AnnArbor/6/60 
(H2N2) virus diluted to 5x103 haemagglutinating units (HAU)/mL; or 4) purified goat antihuman IgA + 
IgG + IgM (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) at a concentration of 5 μg/mL in D-
PBS. PBS alone and human CCRF-CEM cells (human T-cell lymphoblast-like cell line; American Type 
Culture collection [ATCC], Manassas, VA) were used as negative controls; human IM9 cells (human 
IgG+ lymphoblasts; ATCC) were used as a positive control. Plate images were recorded and counted 
using ImmunoSpot 4 software (Cellular Technologies Ltd., Shaker Heights, OH). Human IgA ASCs were 
visualized as red spots and IgG ASCs were visualized as blue spots. The numbers of specific ASCs were 
expressed as total IgG or IgA ASCs per 106 PBMSc. 
Assay antigens in cross-reactivity and antibody affinity evaluations 
The viruses used for the cross-reactive antibody assays were reverse genetics-derived reassortant 
viruses on the PR8 backbone representing different clades of the A(H5N1)/goose/Guangdong/1/96 
lineage. The viruses were engineered to remove the multibasic cleavage motif from the H5 
hemagglutinin (HA) (Talaat et al, 2014). 
The viruses used were as follows: 
• A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital; clade 1) 
• A/Indonesia/5/2005 (PR8-IBCDC-RG2; US CDC; clade 2.1.3.2) 
• A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control-23; Potters Bar, United 
Kingdom; clade 2.2.1) 
• A/Anhui/1/05 (IBCDC-RG5; US CDC; clade 2.3.4) 
• A/Egypt/3072/2010 (IBCDC-RG29; US CDC; clade 2.2.1) 
The assays to measure antibody affinity were performed with recombinant HA1 (rHA1, amino acids 1-
300) and recombinant HA2 (rHA2, amino acids 331-480) domains from A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1). 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No dedicated dose-response studies were conducted for P/LAIV. 
Each 0.2 mL dose of P/LAIV contains 107.0 ± 0.5 FFU of a ca, ts, att, 6:2 reassortant influenza strain. The 
proposed potency specification for P/LAIV is based on potency specifications established for the 
trivalent vaccine FluMist/Fluenz (see below for Fluenz dose-response studies). Whereas study CIR 217 
is not formally a dose-response study, CIR217 study subjects received one or two doses of the 106.7 
TCID50 potency or the 107.5 TCID50 potency. The results from this study and possible recommendations 
for dosing are discussed in the efficacy section. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 37/92 
  
  
FluMist/Fluenz dose-response studies (immunogenicity studies) 
Two studies (D153-P513 and AV002/AV002-2) provide data regarding the dose-dependent 
immunogenicity of FluMist/Fluenz in paediatric and adult subjects. 
Study D153-P513 was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicentre study 
to compare the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of FluMist 107, 106, and 105 in subjects 6 to < 36 
months of age. An IFN-γ ELISPOT assay was used to discriminate between levels of immune response 
elicited at each dosage level in subjects 6 to < 36 months of age. This assay measured the number of 
PBMCs secreting IFN-γ pre-vaccination and post-vaccination in response to stimulation with 
monovalent inactivated antigens identical to those in the vaccine. In summary, a dosage level 
response was observed in cellular immune responses in the periphery following vaccination as 
measured by IFN-γ responses in vitro to A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 test stimuli. Study D153-P513 also 
showed that a 2-dose regimen of FluMist at a dosage level of 107 FFU per strain was statistically 
significantly more protective against culture-confirmed influenza illness in subjects 6 to < 36 months of 
age than a 2-dose regimen at a dosage level of 106 FFU or 105 FFU per strain.  
Study AV002/AV002-2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, dose escalation study to 
evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of frozen FluMist administered by drops or spray in subjects 
18 through 71 months of age. The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety of FluMist in 
subjects 18 through 71 months of age. In addition, this study was designed to identify a dose of 
FluMist that is both safe and immunogenic. AV002 subjects received a single dose of FluMist or placebo 
either as an intranasal spray or as nose drops; AV002-2 subjects received FluMist or placebo as spray 
only. In summary, in subjects 18 to 71 months of age given only a single dose of FluMist, dosage 
levels of 106 or 107 TCID50 were highly immunogenic for the A/H3N2 and B strains based on rises in 
serum HAI titre levels. Serological immune responses to A/H1N1 following a single dose of FluMist 
were limited and increasing the dose of FluMist did not result in substantially increased immunogenicity 
in this age group. 
FluMist/Fluenz - One Dose vs Two Doses (efficacy studies) 
Two studies (AV006 Year 1 and D153-P504) provide data regarding the efficacy of 1 dose vs 2 doses of 
FluMist in paediatric subjects. In subjects 15 to 71 and 6 to 35 months of age, a single dose of FluMist 
was found to be efficacious against culture-confirmed influenza illness; estimates of efficacy were 
88.8% and 57.7% respectively. However, the efficacy associated with a 2-dose primary series was 
numerically higher, and in most of the comparisons made within the studies, statistically higher than 
the efficacy of a single dose. 
Overall, previous results with Fluenz/FluMist demonstrate the benefit of 2 doses compared to a single 
dose in younger children, confirming the selection of dosage also for P/LAIV. They also confirm the 
variability in immunological responses according to age groups and influenza strain. However, a clear 
limitation regarding dosing is the lack of data on doses above 107.0 FFU. While for some influenza 
strains 107.0 FFU or even 106.0 FFU may provide optimal protection, it is not clear that this will be the 
case for other influenza strains. The fact that H1N1 P/LAIV showed effectiveness in children despite low 
increase in HAI GMT clearly demonstrates the lack of correlation between protection and HAI titres. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Title of Studies 
Study CIR 217  
Study CIR 217 was an open-label, inpatient Phase I study conducted in 2006-2007 in healthy adults 
18 to 49 years of age at a single site in the USA. The objectives of the study were to assess  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 38/92 
  
  
safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a live attenuated, vaccine virus based upon the 
A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) influenza isolate (conducted between April and December of 2006). 
Study CIR 239  
Study CIR 239 was an open-label, inpatient Phase I study conducted in 2007 in healthy adults 18 to 
49 years of age at a single site in the USA. The objectives of the study were to assess the  safety, 
infectivity, and immunogenicity of a live attenuated, vaccine virus based upon the  A/Hong 
Kong/213/2003 (H5N1) influenza isolate (conducted between April and December of 2006). Subjects 
were H5N1-seronegative (H5 HAI ≤ 1:8) at baseline). 
Study CIR 277 
A prime-boost Immunogenicity and Safety Study of a 45 Microgram Dose of inactivated, non-
adjuvanted  H5N1 Vaccine in H5N1 and H7N3 LAIV Recipients and LAIV Naive Individuals. Study CIR 
277 was an open-label, outpatient study conducted in 2011-2012 in healthy adults  22 to 54 years of 
age at a single site in the USA. The objective of the study was to assess  whether prior receipt of 
pandemic live attenuated influenza H5N1 vaccines primed or established long-lasting immunity that 
could be detected by the administration of an  inactivated H5N1 vaccine (conducted in 2011-2012). 
One of the goals of the prime-boost studies has been to evaluate the time course over which 
immunological priming occurs. The first of such studies, the CIR 277 H5N1 study, brought subjects 
enrolled in the original H5N1 P/LAIV studies back to the clinical site approximately 4 to 5 years later 
for receipt of the inactivated vaccine. This interval was shortened in subsequent studies; subjects 
enrolled in the H7N7 study (URMC 11-001) returned to the site 18 to 24 months after their initial 
P/LAIV vaccinations while subjects in the H7N9 study (URMC 13-001) returned after an interval of 3 
months (see section on supportive studies). 
Methods 
Study Participants  
In general, the P/LAIV studies enrolled healthy male and non-pregnant female adults approximately 18 
to 49 years of age. This age range was selected as it reflects the indicated age range of the seasonal 
live attenuated vaccine approved in the USA. The age range for Study CIR 277 was slightly older (22 
to 54 years) as subjects previously enrolled in Studies CIR 217 and CIR 239 were brought back to 
clinical site 4-5 years after completion of the initial studies. 
For the pivotal H5N1 studies the main inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below. 
Inclusion criteria: 
•  General good health, without medical significant illness, physical examination findings illness, 
or significant laboratory abnormalities; 
• 
Female subjects must agree to use effective birth control methods for the duration of the 
study. 
Exclusion criteria: 
•  Pregnancy as determined by a positive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin test. 
•  Currently breast-feeding. 
•  Evidence of clinically significant neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, rheumatologic, 
autoimmune, or renal disease by history, physical examination, and/or laboratory studies 
including urine testing. 
Assessment report

•  History of anaphylaxis or history of life threatening reaction to prior influenza vaccine. 
•  Current diagnosis of asthma or reactive airway disease (within the past 2 years). 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were chosen adequately for a nasal live attenuated pandemic influenza 
vaccine. 
Treatments 
In clinical trial CIR 217 the H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 ca vaccine was evaluated at doses of 106.7 
TCID50 (low dose) and 107.5 TCID50 (high dose) administered 4 to 8 weeks apart. The table below 
summarises the number of subjects who received the H5N1 vaccines. 
Table 3.  Summary of subjects and dosages in study CIR 217 
Three subjects in Group 1 and two subjects in Group 2 were not re-admitted for a second dose due to 
persistent elevated ALT value, pre-existing wheeze, missed visit, possible contraction of an infectious 
agent, and sample clotting of platelet. One subject discontinued the study in the follow-up period due 
to a gunshot wound in the head. 
In clinical trial CIR 239 16 to 22 subjects were planned to receive twice 107.5 TCID50 the H5N1 A/Hong 
Kong/213/2003 vaccine. The table below provides the enrolled subjects of Study CIR 239. 
Table 4.  Summary of subjects in study CIR 239 
One subject withdrew the participation to the trial, because subject was offered immediate, full-time 
employment. 
Nasal washes for viral detection were obtained daily from the day of admission through the day of 
discharge. 
The study CIR 277 enrolled 69 subjects in 5 groups: Group 1 enrolled 11 subjects who had previously 
received 2 doses of the A/H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004 P/LAIV in 2006-2007; Group 2 enrolled 10 
subjects who had previously received 2 doses of the A/H5N1/Hong Kong/213/2003 P/LAIV in 2007; 
Group 3 enrolled 8 subjects who had previously received 2 doses of the A/British Columbia/CN-6/2004

P/LAIV in 2010 (as a P/LAIV control group); Groups 4 and 5 each enrolled 20 subjects who had not 
been previously vaccinated with LAIV and were influenza H5-naive. Subjects in Groups 1 to 4 received 
a single 45 μg dose of an inactivated A/H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine (P/IIV) while subjects in 
Group 5 received 2 doses, approximately 28 days apart. The purpose of Study 277 was to evaluate 
whether the dose of inactivated vaccine could unmask memory B-cell responses that had been induced 
by P/LAIV in Studies CIR 217 and CIR 239. The following table gives an overview on planned subjects 
in the different vaccination groups.

very low for Phase I trials, which requested an inpatient phase of almost 14 days. Also in study CIR 
277 the drop-out rate of less than 5% is considered very low.  
Objectives 
Study CIR 217  
To investigate the safety, infectivity and immunogenicity of H5N1 VN 2004/AA ca recombinant vaccine 
by:  
•  determining the frequency of vaccine-related reactogenicity events and other AEs for each 
dose 
•  quantifying the amount of vaccine virus shed by each recipient 
•  determining the amount of serum and nasal wash antibody induced by the vaccine 
Study CIR 239 
To determine the safety, infectivity and immunogenicity of the H5N1 HK2003/AA ca recombinant 
vaccine by: 
•  determining the frequency of vaccine-related reactogenicity events and other AEs for each 
dose 
•  quantifying the amount of vaccine virus shed by each recipient 
•  determining the amount of serum and nasal wash antibody induced by the vaccine 
Study CIR 277 
To evaluate the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the inactivated H5N1 vaccine in subject who 
previously received a live attenuated H5N1 vaccine, as measured by HAI and MN assays. The study 
also assessed whether prior receipt of pandemic live attenuated influenza H5N1 vaccines in Studies 
CIR 217 or CIR 239 primed or established long-lasting immunity that could be detected by the 
administration of an inactivated H5N1 vaccine. 
Overall the objectives of all three pivotal studies were chosen adequately for Phase I trials. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
In P/LAIV studies CIR 217 (ca A/Vietnam/1203/2004 [H5N1] vaccine) and CIR 239 (ca A/Hong 
Kong/213/2003 [H5N1] vaccine), antibody responses were measured by assays for serum 
haemagglutination inhibition (HAI), microneutralisation (MN), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and 
immunoglobulin A (IgA) and nasal IgA assays. In addition, for several studies including Study CIR 217, 
antibody secreting cells (ASCs) were also evaluated. For Study CIR 277, in which subjects who were 
previously enrolled in Studies CIR 217 and CIR 239 and thereby vaccinated with H5N1 P/LAIV received 
an inactivated H5N1 vaccine, antibody responses were measured by HAI and MN assays. HAI 
antibodies were assayed using horse or Turkey red blood cells, whereas antibody neutralising activity 
was titrated on MDCK cells, mostly using a modified method. 
Other immunoassays included ELISAs for serum IgG and IgA and nasal wash IgA against recombinant 
homologous HA, and in few cases, also the vaccine virus, in most of the CRADA/NIH studies. In some 
studies, blood circulating IgG and/or IgA antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) vaccine virus specific were 
measured 7 days after dosing. The numbers of specific ASCs were measured using ELISPOT assay and 
expressed as total IgG or IgA ASCs per 106 PBMSc.

A serum HAI or MN response (seroconversion) was defined as ≥4-fold increase in titres from the 
baseline for all of the P/LAIV studies. The same criterion was also used for a serum IgG or IgA or a 
nasal IgA response for all studies, but URMC 10-002 and URMC 10-003 which used ≥2-fold rise for 
serum IgG and/or nasal IgA. 
All these immunoassays were performed by the laboratories of study sites or contracted research 
organisations. No centralised laboratory was employed for the P/LAIV study programme. 
Sample size 
The sample size of the pivotal studies CIR217, CIR239, CIR277 was not based on statistical 
considerations and was overall limited. 
Randomisation 
Studies CIR217 and CIR239 were not randomized. In study CIR277 block randomisation was applied to 
randomize H5 and LAIV naïve subjects to receive either 1 or 2 doses of the H5N1 vaccine.  
Blinding (masking) 
The pivotal studies were open label studies. 
Statistical methods 
For the pivotal studies statistical characteristics (continuous data: mean, SD, median, minimum, 
maximum; categorical data: absolute and relative frequencies) stratified by group and time (where 
appropriate) were used to describe the observed parameter. The geometric mean values including 
their 95%-CIs were used to describe immunogenicity parameter. Where appropriate, dichotomic 
outcomes (i.e. AE’s) were compared between groups by Fisher’s exact test; continuous variables (e.g. 
immunogenicity parameter) were compared by means of non-parametric tests. No type I error control 
was employed. 
Results 
Participant flow (study CIR277) 
The CIR 277 study enrolled 69 subjects in 5 groups: Group 1 enrolled 11 subjects who had previously 
received 2 doses of the ca A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 P/LAIV in 2006-2007 (CIR217, 107.5 TCID50 
dose); Group 2 enrolled 10 subjects who had previously received 2 doses of the ca A/Hong 
Kong/213/2003 H5N1 P/LAIV in 2007 (CIR239); Group 3 enrolled 8 subjects who had previously 
received 2 doses of the ca A/British Columbia/CN-6/2004 H7N3 P/LAIV in 2010 (as a P/LAIV control 
group); Groups 4 and 5 each enrolled 20 subjects who had not been previously vaccinated with LAIV 
and were influenza H5-naïve. Subjects in Groups 1 to 4 received a single 45-μg dose of an inactivated 
A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine (pandemic inactivated influenza vaccine [P/IIV]) while subjects in Group 
5 received 2 doses, approximately 28 days apart.

To determine antibody responses blood draws were taken at baseline, Day 7, Day 28, Day 35 (Group 5 
only), Day 84 (Group 5 only), Day 180 Groups 1-4), and Day 208 (Group 5 only).  
Enrolled subjects were carefully screened before enrolment into the study. Also study conduct within 
the isolation unit was very safe for the enrolled subjects. 
Recruitment 
Healthy men and non-pregnant women, 18-49 years of age, were enrolled in the clinical trials CIR 217 
and CIR 239 conducted in Baltimore if they met the eligibility criteria and were willing to remain on the 
isolation unit for the duration of the inpatient portion of the trials. Based upon the pattern of vaccine 
virus shedding observed with the low dose H5N1 A/Vietnam/2004 ca vaccine, the duration of the 
inpatient stay was shortened from a total of 14 days (3 before vaccination and 11 days following 
vaccination) to 12 days (3 days before vaccination and 9 days following vaccination) for group 2 of CIR 
217 and CIR 239 study, providing that vaccine virus was not detected by rRT-PCR from nasal washes 
obtained for three consecutive days prior to discharge day. Subjects enrolled in Study CIR 277 were 
slightly older, because the received prior two doses of P/LAIVs 4-5 years before. 
The CHMP noted that subjects vaccinated with a live attenuated vaccine were monitored very carefully 
in the isolation units by rRT-PCR from nasal washes daily and prior to vaccination. Daily throat swabs 
were also obtained for the low dose group 1 in study CIR 217. 
Conduct of the study 
Studies CIR 217 and CIR 239 were conducted between April and December in the years 2006 and 
2007, when wt human influenza viruses would be unlikely to be circulating in the local community. 
Additionally the wt influenza viruses in the community were monitored in order to minimise the risk or 
reassortment between a naturally occurring wt influenza virus and the vaccine virus. Participants would 
not have been enrolled if there were more than 3 influenza hospitalisations in the week preceding the 
planned vaccination. 
Potential participants were screened for tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, HIV infection, and antibodies for 
H5N1 (high dose group in CIR 217 and complete trial CIR 239) using serological assays. Haematology, 
biochemistry for blood specimens and dipstick analyses were performed. Pregnancy tests for female 
subjects were performed to exclude pregnancies.

Subjects were admitted to the isolation unit. Vaccine was administered at day 0 and the enrolled 
subjects received 0.5 mL of vaccine via nasal spray. Nasal washes were collected daily during the 
inpatient portion of the study and were tested for vaccine virus. 
In the event of a respiratory or febrile illness, nasal wash specimens were also cultured for 
adventitious respiratory viruses. Laboratory findings of patients with severe avian influenza H5N1 
include leucopenia, lymphopenia, impaired liver function with elevated liver enzymes, prolonged 
clotting times, and renal impairment. The lymphocyte count appears to be the most valuable 
parameter for identification of patients who are at risk of progression to severe illness. Therefore 
serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and complete blood counts were determined before 
vaccination and on day 7 following vaccination. Any abnormal results were followed until resolution. 
After discharge from the isolation unit, participants were asked for outpatient visits on study day 28 
(+7 days) following each dose of vaccine. At each visit, staff obtained vital signs, reviewed interim 
histories and obtained blood and nasal wash samples for antibody testing. 
Baseline data 
Study CIR 217 and CIR 239 recruited primarily African Americans. Sex and race of enrolled subjects in 
these studies were: 32% were female, 85% black and 8% white. 
Study 277 was a follow-up of CIR217 and CIR239. The baseline demographics in Groups 1-5 subjects 
were essentially comparable, with the exception of age. The subjects were mainly male (61%) and 
black (88%). Of the 69 enrolled, 66 completed the final study visit. 
Table 7.  Demographic characteristics, by study Group 
The Applicant was asked to justify whether the demographics of the pivotal studies could have 
implications for validity of data with regards to the ethnical composition of the EU population. It was 
clarified that studies CIR 217, CIR 239, and CIR 277 were conducted in Baltimore, MD, United States 
of America (USA). As a result, the subjects enrolled primarily reflect the demographics of this urban 
city. Previous studies conducted with FluMist have shown, however, that the safety and efficacy of the 
vaccine are not affected by the race and ethnicity of the vaccine recipients; the results of the P/LAIV 
studies can therefore be applied to the European Union (EU) population. Also, additional studies 
conducted at the University of Rochester and the studies of the 2009 H1N1pdm vaccine sponsored by 
MedImmune enrolled a racially and ethnically more diverse set of subjects. While a demographic 
composition more similar to the European situation would have been preferable, the practical 
limitations linked to study design (i.e. involving isolation of study subjects) is acknowledged, and the 
argumentation in support of the validity of the data generated in the pivotal studies for the EU 
population were deemed acceptable.

Numbers analysed 
194 potential participants aged 18 to 49 years were screened for the H5N1 P/LAIV vaccine trials and 
59 participants were enrolled. Tables 9 and 10 provided the actual number of subjects and dosages in 
the trials. 
CIR 217:  
•  21 in group 1, who received 106.7 TCID50 of H5N1 A/Vietnam/2004 (18 received a second dose) 
•  21 in group 2, who received 107.5 TCID50 of H5N1 A/Vietnam/2004 (19 received a second dose) 
CIR 239: 
•  17 in the cohort that received 107.5 TCID50 of H5N1 A/Hong Kong/213/2003 vaccine (16 
received a second dose) 
Participants were not equally balanced across the intended age group. Of the 59 participants 19 (32%) 
were female, 50 (85%) black, 5 (8%) white, 3 (6%) Asian, and 1 described herself as other. For study 
CIR 239 122 potential participants were screened for H5 HA antibody. 8 of these individuals had titres 
≥1:8 and were excluded from participation. 
CIR 277 
The study was a follow-up of CIR217 and CIR239. Only about half of the original subjects in CIR217 
and CIR239 were enrolled into this study. See the participant flow. The CIR 277 study only included 
subjects which had received two 107.5 TCID50 doses of H5N1 VN 04 in the previous CIR 217 study and 
excluded subjects which had received the lower 106.7 TCID50 doses. At the time that Study CIR 277 was 
planned it was unclear whether subjects enrolled in Study CIR 217 had mounted meaningful immune 
responses to the P/LAIV H5N1 Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine, as subjects in both the lower dose and 
higher dose cohorts had minimal antibody responses to the vaccine. A decision was made to re-enrol 
the subjects in the higher dose cohort in order to maximize the likelihood of revealing any priming 
responses that might have been induced approximately 5 years previously.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Results of study CIR217 
The study was initiated in 2006 at a single site in the USA. Enrolment details were reported together 
with study CIR239 in the same publication. Pre-screening test for H5 HAI antibody was undertaken 
only for the 107.5 TCID50 dosage groups of H5N1 VN04, but not for 106.7 TCID50 dosage group of H5N1 
VN04. 
For CIR217, a total of 42 subjects were eventually enrolled (21 in 106.7, 21 in 107.5 group) and 
evaluable for the safety, infectivity and immunogenicity. Subject age ranged from 21 to 49 years.  
Virologic responses 
Vaccine virus was undetected by culture in 106.7 TCID50 dosage group but detected by rRT-PCR in 2 
subjects post dose 1 and in 3 subjects post dose 2. In 107.5 group, vaccine virus was recovered by 
culture in 2 subjects following dose 2, and detected by rRT-PCR in 3 subjects post dose 1, and in 15 
subjects post dose 2. 
Antibody responses 
A serum HAI or IgA antibody response was each detected in 2 subjects (10%) after 1 or 2 doses of 
106.7 TCID50 vaccine (i.e. after any dose). Nasal wash IgA responses were detected in 5 subjects (24%) 
after any dose. No MN or serum IgG responses were detected. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 46/92 
  
  
For recipients of 1 or 2 doses of 107.5 TCID50 vaccine, 2 (10%) and 1 (5%) subjects developed a HAI 
and MN seroresponse, respectively, after any dose, and 11 (52%) subjects had a serum IgA response. 
T cell-mediated immune response 
Cell-mediated immunity was measured after 2 doses of P/LAIV H5N1 VN in 21 vaccine recipients. It 
was found that T cell responses to conserved internal proteins M and NP were boosted by vaccination. 
In addition, H5N1 pLAIV appeared to preferentially stimulate and boost pre-existing seasonal influenza 
virus HA-specific T cell responses that showed low cross-reactivity with the H5 HA. No evidence that 
pre-existing T cells prevented pLAIV replication and take was found. Furthermore, it was demonstrated 
that cross-reactive T cell responses could be boosted by pLAIV regardless of the induction of antibody. 
The publication by Peng et al 2015 has been submitted. 
Results of study CIR239 
The study was initiated in 2007 at a single site in the USA. Pre-screening test for H5 HAI antibody of 
potential participants was undertaken for the 107.5 TCID50 dosage group of H5N1 HK03. As a result, 17 
subjects were enrolled in this study, all received the first dose and 16 of them received the second 
dose of vaccine. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 49 years.  
Virologic responses 
After the first dose, vaccine virus was detected in 1 (6%) subject by culture and in 8 (47%) by rRT-
PCR. After the second dose, vaccine virus was undetected by virus culture but detected by rRT-PCR in 
9 (56%) subjects. 
Antibody responses 
No HAI or MN seroresponse was detected in any study subjects after any dose of vaccine. Serum IgG 
response was detected in 1 (6%) and serum IgA and nasal wash IgA response each in 3 (18%) 
subjects, after 1 or 2 doses of vaccine. 
Results of CIR277 
HAI and MN responses 
All subjects in Groups 1-5 had H5 HAI titres of ≤1:8 prior to immunisation, which means they were 
H5N1 seronegative. As shown in the table below, 28 days following receipt of a single 45µg dose of 
inactivated H5N1 VN04 vaccine (ISIV: inactivated subvirion influenza vaccine), 73% of subjects in 
Group 1 developed HAI and MN seroresponses to the wild-type H5N1 VN04. At day 56, seroconversion 
rates increased to 82% in HAI assay but decreased to 55% in MN assay. In contrast, the frequencies 
and magnitudes of antibody responses were minimal in Group 3 (P/LAIV H7N3-primed) and Group 4 
(unprimed subjects, 1 dose). Subjects in Group 5 (unprimed subjects, 2 doses) also developed lower 
HAI and MN antibody responses at Day 28, which gradually increased by Day 56 showing no 
statistically significant difference with Group 1 in MN response at Day 56.

Table 8.  Serum HAI and MN antibody responses following immunisation   
Subjects in Group 2, who were previously primed by P/LAIV H5N1 HK03 candidate, also responded to a 
single heterologous boosting dose, but their Day 28 responses did not differ significantly from Day 56 
responses of Group 5 subjects. 
Overall, subjects who were primed with either the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 P/LAIV or the A/Hong 
Kong/213/2003 P/LAIV had a significantly better response to a single dose of inactivated H5N1 vaccine 
than P/LAIV-naïve subjects. The antibody response in A/Vietnam/1203/2004 P/LAIV-primed subjects 
also exceeded that observed after 2 doses of inactivated vaccine in P/LAIV-naïve subjects. 
Although only the cohort with the higher dose from study CIR 217 was enrolled in study CIR 277, it is 
likely that subjects enrolled in the lower, 106.7 TCID50, cohort in Study CIR 217 would also have 
demonstrated significant booster responses. 
Kinetics of serum antibody responses 
Upon re-vaccination, subjects of Group 1 rapidly developed serum HAI response: 7/11 (64%) had a 4-
fold rise in HAI titre (Figure 4A), with a GMT of 165 and a titre range from 20 to 1280 in responding 
subjects (Figure 4B) by day 7. Longevity of the antibody response was witnessed at later time points 
(Figure 4 A and C), but GMT of HAI antibodies in all groups declined 6 months after dosing. Fewer 
subjects had detectable antibodies by 6 months after the last vaccine dose (Figure 4A).  Of the P/LAIV-
naïve subjects only 10% had a 4-fold rise in HAI titre by Day 7.

Cross-Clade reactivity 
Thirteen of 21 subjects in Groups 1 and 2 had MN titres of ≥1:40. Of these, sera from all but 1 H5N1 
P/LAIV-primed subject neutralised ≥2 clades of H5N1 viruses from the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96 
H5N1 lineage (Figure 5). In Group 5, serum from only 1 subject neutralised >1 clade, and the receipt 
of a second dose of inactivated vaccine did not increase the breadth of antibody response.

(clade 2.3.4), A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 (clade 2.2.1), and A/Egypt/3072/2101 (clade 2.2.1). 
At Day 28 the cross-neutralizing antibodies against Indonesia/5/2005, Turkey/Turkey/1/05, 
Anhui/1/05, and Egypt/3072/2010 H5N1 strains (all reverse genetics-derived reassortant viruses) were 
in 27%, 18%, 45%, and 45%, respectively, of previous recipients of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 (Cohort 1). A 
somewhat better seroconversion rate (SCR) against each heterologous strain was observed in Cohort 2 
subjects who previously received the P/LAIV H5N1 HK candidate. No such advantage was observed in 
GMTs for Cohort 2. 
The 95% confidence intervals of these data were not presented. However, the overall small sample 
size in each cohort suggests that these data should not be over interpreted.

Antibody affinity 
Antibody affinity to recombinant HA1 (1-330) and HA2 (331-480) protein was assayed via monitoring 
steady-state equilibrium binding of post-vaccination sera at 250C, for responders (titres of ≥1:40) and 
non-responders (titres < 1:40) of Groups 1-5. The antibody off-rate against rHA1 and rHA2 were 
plotted against MN titre to homologous H5N1 VN04 (vaccine strain) or heterologous H5N1 clades and 
subclades mentioned above (Figure 6). 
In Group 1, the average off-rates for antibody bound to rHA1 were significantly slower in responders 
than non-responders (P =0.0083). A similar pattern was for group 2 but did not reach statistical 
significance. Compared with Group 5, Groups 1 and 2 responders showed 2–3-fold stronger (slower 
off-rates) antibody affinity against rHA1 (P =0.0249 and 0.0013, respectively) but not against rHA2 
(Figure 6A, 6B). 
Inverse correlations were observed between antibody off-rates against rHA1 (Figure 6C and 6E–H) but 
not rHA2 (Figure 6D) and the MN titres against all H5N1 strains tested. 
In summary the affinity of antibodies against the HA1 domain of the H5 HA in the H5N1 P/LAIV-primed 
groups was significantly higher than the 2-dose inactivated vaccine group, which correlated with cross-
clade H5N1 neutralization.

P/LAIV studies 
Ten P/LAIV studies (CIR247, URMC10-004, CIR251, CIR241, URMC10-002, URMC11-001, URMC10-
003, CIR293, URMC13-001 and CIR211) evaluated the safety, infectivity and immunogenicity of 2 
doses of P/LAIV candidates developed for conducted with other potential pandemic strains, H2N2, 
H2N3, H6N1, H7N3 (2 studies), H7N7 (2 studies), H7N9 (2 studies) and H9N2, respectively. Study 
URMC10-002 assessed a single dose of P/LAIV H7N3. The time points for serum and nasal wash 
antibodies measurements were prior to vaccination and at Days 21, 28, and 42 after each dose in 
CIR211, or at baseline and Day 28 after each dose in CIR247.   
Three studies were based on a prime-boost design and these are described more in detail below. 
Study URMC11-001 
The study was conducted in 2013 at a single site in the USA, to investigate the boosting effect of the 
pIIV in 18-50 years old subjects immunised 18-24 months earlier with the P/LAIV H7N7 candidate 
(A/H7N7 A/Netherlands/219/03 vaccine, study URMC10-003). In total the study enrolled 39 subjects in 
3 groups: 14 subjects (58%) including 12 recipients of 2 P/LAIV doses and 2 recipients of 1 P/LAIV 
dose from URMC10-003 entered Group 1; Group 2 enrolled 5 subjects prior recipients of P/LAIV H7N3 
(A/H7N3 A/chicken/British Columbia/CN-6/04) as a P/LAIV control group); and Group 3 enrolled 20 
subjects who were seronegative to H7 (HAI titre ≤1:8) and who never received a P/LAIV. All subjects 
received a single 45-μg dose of the inactivated H7N7 vaccine.  
In general, there was no substantial difference in demographic aspects between the group receiving 
P/LAIV H7N7 and the subset that was boosted with H7N7 pIIV, or between primed and unprimed 
recipients of pIIV. 
Antibody responses 
All subjects in Group 1 did not develop detectable HAI and MN seroresponses in precursor study 
URMC10-003. After receipt of a single 45µg dose of inactivated H7N7 vaccine, 9/13 (69%) of Group 1 
subjects had a serum HAI titre of ≥1:40 and 10/13 (77%) had a serum MN response to the H7N7 
vaccine virus (Table 14), including the 2 subjects who had received only 1 dose of H7N7 P/LAIV. 
Serum IgG and IgA antibody responses to homologous HA were also detected by ELISA in most of the 
Group 1 subjects. In contrast, none of subjects in Groups 2 and 3 had a detectable serum HAI or MN 
response (Table 14).

P/LAIV H7N7 or P/LAIV H7N3 
Kinetics of antibody responses 
Upon re-vaccination of P/LAIV H7N7-primed subjects, antibody responses were rapid, with the GMTs of 
HAI and MN at > 32 and > 40, respectively, by Day 7. Peak titres were reached on Day 14, and then 
declined over time (Figure 7). One year after dosing, 2 of 4 subjects tested still had detectable titres 
against H7N7, although the levels were low.

against H7N3 for each subject following re-vaccination in Group 1 subjects. 
GMTs are displayed by the horizontal line. Assays were done using P/LAIV H7N7 virus or P/LAIV H7N3 as test 
antigen. Samples with a HAI titre of <4 are assigned a value of 2, and samples with a MN titre of <10 are assigned 
a value of 5. 
The reverse cumulative distribution data for subjects in Cohort 1 at day 14 revealed that 
approximately 20% or less of subjects developed higher HAI or MN titres ≥1:1000, either against 
H7N7 (homologous) or H7N3 (heterologous) strain. 
Cross-reactivity 
Sera were also tested for reactivity against other H7 variant viruses, including the ca A/chicken/British

A/mallard/Netherlands/12/2000 wild type virus (H7N3, Eurasian lineage and donor of the HA gene for 
the inactivated vaccine) and the human isolate A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9, Eurasian lineage). 
Among the responders in Group 1 who developed MN and HAI responses following re-vaccination, 
broadly cross-reactive antibodies were detected at Day 14, both against vaccine viruses and the 
antigenically distinct wild-type viruses mentioned above (Figure 8). 
Interestingly, antibody response induced by inactivated H7N7 vaccine in P/LAIV H7N7-primed subjects 
also recognised H7N3 virus, while subjects primed with P/LAIV H7N3 did not generate antibody to 
H7N3 virus following re-vaccination with inactivated H7N7 vaccine (data not shown). 
Figure 7.  Cross reactivity of Day 14 sera from Group 1 individual responders showing MN (A) and HAI 
(B) antibody responses. 
Shown are individual titres and the GMTs of antibody responses to A/Netherlands/219/2003 P/LAIV (H7N7 ca), 
A/Netherlands/219/2003 wild-type virus (H7N7 wt), A/chicken/British Columbia/CN-6/2004 P/LAIV (H7N3 ca), 
A/mallard/Netherlands/12/2000 (H7N3 wt), and A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9 wt). 
At Day 14 post-booster immunization in group 1, cross-reactive HAI antibodies against H7N3 P/LAIV 
ca, H7N3 wt, and H7N9 wt developed in 69%, 46% and 69% of subjects, respectively, and the MN 
antibodies in 62%, 38% and 69% of subjects, respectively. The lowest GMT titres in both assays were 
seen for the H7N3 wt strain. The differential responses in GMTs to the H7N3 wt virus (HAI 74.2; MN 
113.1) versus the H7N9 wt virus (HAI 172.8; MN 244.6) might suggest difference in antigenicity and 
closeness to the H7N7 P/LAIV strain (HAI 348.4; MN 296.3). 
Study URMC13-001 
Initiated in October 2013 at a single site in the USA, this inpatient study enrolled 32 healthy adults 18 
to 49 years of age, divided into 2 groups: 16 received a single dose of P/LAIV H7N9 candidate (107 
FFU), and 16 received 2 doses administered 28 to 42 days apart. Of these 32, 30 including 14 in the 1-
dose group and 16 in the 2-doses group were re-vaccinated, approximately 3 months later, with a 
single 30µg dose of inactivated H7N9 vaccine. 
Concerning demographic aspects of the study population, more male subjects (75%) and more White 
people (43.8%) were enrolled in this supportive study, compared with other prime-boost studies such 
as CIR 277. 
Virological responses 
Assessment report

2 subjects shed vaccine virus as detected by viral culture in nasal swabs, after the first dose or the 
second dose of P/LAIV H7N9 vaccine. By rRT-PCR, vaccine virus shedding was detected in 18 subjects 
after the first vaccine dose, and in 10 subjects after the second dose. 
Antibody responses 
All subjects showed H7N9-specific serum HAI titre ≤1:8 at baseline, which means that they were all 
seronegative for H7N9 prior to vaccination. Following receipt of P/LAIV H7N9 candidate, serum HAI and 
MN antibodies were detected in 2 subjects, both in the 2-doses group. 
Re-vaccination with inactivated H7N9 vaccine rapidly elicited HAI antibodies at Day 7 against P/LAIV 
H7N9 in 8/14 (57%) of prior recipients of 1 dose, and in 13/16 (81%) of prior recipients of 2 doses of 
P/LAIV H7N9 candidate. Corresponding HAI GMTs in the two cohorts were 128 and 351, respectively, 
at Day 7. MN seroresponse rates at Day 7 were 64% in prior recipients of 1 dose of P/LAIV H7N9 
candidate and 94% in prior recipients of 2 doses. 
 Antibody responses following receipt of the inactivated H7N9 antigen were evaluated up to Day 82, 
demonstrating notable HAI and MN antibody responses to the vaccine virus in H7N9 IIV recipients (see 
tables 15 and 16). Thus, the H7N9 P/LAIV candidate vaccine primed for a rapid, robust antibody 
response to H7N9 IIV.

In addition, HAI titres ranging from 69 to 104 GMTs were detected at day 7 in around 60 to 80% of 
vaccinees against antigenically distinct H7N7 and H7N3 P/LAIVs (table 10).

Study CIR 293 
This is the second study evaluating boosting effect in P/LAIV H7N9-primed healthy adults in addition to 
URMC 13-001 (also prime-boost). Study CIR293 began in 2014 and is still ongoing. The Interim results

A total of 39 subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 received 2 doses of P/LAIV and a total of 40 subjects in 
Cohorts 3 and 4 received a single dose of P/LAIV. Twenty subjects in Cohort 5 were not vaccinated 
with P/LAIV and received 2 doses of pIIV. 
A total of 92 of the 99 subjects completed the study: 
•  Cohort 1: 18 subjects received a single dose of pIIV 4 weeks post receipt of P/LAIV and all 18 
subjects completed the study 
•  Cohort 2: 17 subjects received a single dose of pIIV 8 weeks post receipt of P/LAIV and 16 
subjects completed the study 
•  Cohort 3: 20 subjects received a single dose of pIIV 8 weeks post receipt of P/LAIV and 19 
subjects completed the study 
•  Cohort 4: 19 subjects received a single dose of pIIV 4 weeks post receipt of P/LAIV and all 19 
subjects completed the study 
•  Cohort 5: All 20 subjects completed the study 
Figure 9, Figure 10, and Figure 11 provide summary information for HAI responses against the live 
attenuated virus; testing against wild-type viruses is planned to be conducted.

The data indicate that P/LAIV priming led to robust responses to H7N9 pIIV. The magnitude and 
frequency of HAI responses were greater in subjects primed with 2 doses of P/LAIV than in subjects 
primed with 1 dose P/LAIV or unprimed subjects. However, subjects primed with a single dose of 
P/LAIV had more robust responses by Day 14 than unprimed subjects who received 2 doses of 
inactivated vaccine. In addition, a dosing interval as short as 4 weeks still resulted in robust immune 
responses for subjects who previously received 2 doses of P/LAIV. Indeed > 80% of subjects 
seroconverted by HAI on Day 7 following receipt of the inactivated H7N9 antigen 4 weeks post-priming 
and there was no significant difference between the 4- and 8-week dosing intervals between P/LAIV 
prime and pIIV boost doses. 
Other supportive P/LAIV studies 
Virologic and immunogenicity data generated from 8 additional P/LAIV studies are summarised in Table 
18. 
Overall, individual candidate vaccine viruses could be recovered from nasal secretion of vaccine 
recipients following inoculation, but at low level, in a small proportion of subjects and detected 
primarily by rRT-PCR tests. Overall the incidence of shedding appears slightly lower compared to 
shedding of vaccine virus in adult subjects who received T/LAIV. The serum HAI and MN antibody 
responses were minimal to modest in subjects primed with 1 or 2 doses of these P/LAIV candidates.

An additional study, URMC 14-004, is currently recruiting subjects. In this study, subjects 50 to 70 
years of age will receive 2 doses (28 days apart) of P/LAIV H7N9 followed by one dose of an H7N9 pIIV 
70 days after the second P/LAIV dose. While this study will provide some additional information on 
immune response following a boosting interval of 70 days, the primary goal of the study is to evaluate 
how successful P/LAIV is in generating immune responses in older subjects who have traditionally 
responded poorly to inactivated pandemic vaccines. 
Pandemic H1N1pdm09 LAIV studies 
Methodological aspects of studies MI-CP215 and MI-CP217 
The sample size of the supportive H1N1 studies was based on safety considerations: with 300 
evaluable subjects (240 vaccine, 60 placebo) and a true fever rate in placebo recipients between 0.5% 
and 2%, study MI-CP215 had at least 99.9% power to rule out a rate increase of 10 percentage points 
assuming the true difference between the treatment groups was zero and the true fever rate was 
≤3%. With 300 evaluable subjects (240 vaccine, 60 placebo), a true fever rate in vaccine recipients 
between 3% and 8% and a 0% to 3% lower fever rate in placebo recipients, study MI-CP217 had 
between 66% and 99.9% power to rule out a rate increase of 10 percentage points. 
An IVRS (Interactive Voice Response System) was used to randomize subjects in a 4:1 ratio to receive 
either 2 doses of active 2009 H1N1 vaccine or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by site. The 
studies were double blinded; to blind study participants, the active vaccine and placebo were 
identically labelled and indistinguishable in appearance. 
The difference in proportions between treatment groups including their two-sided exact 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were constructed using the exact method proposed by Chan and Zhang. 
Geometric mean titres and geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) were summarized for baseline 
seronegative subjects and all subjects by treatment group and by visit. The 95% CIs for GMFRs were 
constructed using a percentile-based bootstrap method.  
MI-CP215 
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted from 03 August 2009 through 22 
March 2010 in healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age at 5 sites in USA. The primary safety endpoint was 
the occurrence of fever ≥101°F during Days 1 to 8 after the first dose; the primary immunogenicity 
endpoint was the proportion of subjects experiencing a post-dose seroresponse (≥4-fold increase in 
HAI titres from baseline). 
Of the 300 subjects enrolled, 240 received a first dose of H1N1pdm09 P/LAIV on day 1, and 228 
received the second dose on day 29. 
Regardless of baseline serostatus, seroresponse rates after receipt of H1N1 P/LAIV were 2.5% and 
6.1% for Days 15 and 29, respectively, and 14.9% on Day 57. For placebo recipients, regardless of 
baseline serostatus, seroresponse rates were 0% on Days 15 and 29 and 5.6% on Day 57. 
Seroresponse rates were slightly higher among subjects who were seronegative at baseline.  
MI-CP217 
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted from 03 August 2009 through 
23March 2010 in children 2 to 17 years of age at 16 sites in the USA. The primary safety endpoint and 
the primary immunogenicity endpoint were the same as MI-CP215 study above. 
326 subjects were randomized and 259 received the monovalent vaccine on day 1 and 256 of them 
received the second dose on day 29. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 59/92 
  
  
Regardless of baseline serostatus, seroresponse rates after receipt of monovalent vaccine were 7.8% 
and 11.1% for Days 15 and 29, respectively, and 32.0% on Day 57. For placebo recipients, regardless 
of baseline serostatus, seroresponse rate was 6.3% on Days 15 and 29 and 14.5% on Day 57. 
Seroresponse rates were slightly higher among subjects who were seronegative at baseline. 
Effectiveness of pandemic H1N1pdm09 LAIV vaccine 
The US CDC estimated the effectiveness of monovalent H1N1pdm09 LAIV vaccine using a test-
negative study design. 7-days after a single dose of vaccine, vaccine effectiveness against influenza 
cases reported during this period was 60.6% (95% CI: 12, 82) among those aged 2-49 years, and 
81.9% (95% CI: 14, 96) among those aged 2 to 9 years (Griffin, et al, 2011). Vaccine effectiveness 
for those 10 to 49 years of age was 26.4% (95% CI: -91.3, 71.7), however, due to the small number 
of cases the study was not adequately powered to assess effectiveness in this age group.  
In school-aged children (approximately 5 to 14 years of age), vaccine effectiveness was estimated to 
be 81% (95% CI: -37, 97) against rRT-PCR–confirmed H1N1 infection vs. 58% for inactivated H1N1 
vaccine (Uzicanin et al, 2012), and in children 2-9 years of age was 100% (95% CI: < 0, 100) against 
hospitalisation vs. 66% for inactivated vaccine (aged 3-9years) (Hadler et al, 2012).   
Seasonal LAIV studies 
Since very young children are generally seronaïve to circulating wild-type seasonal influenza strains, 
efficacy data gathered from the paediatric population with seasonal LAIV studies, including children 
less than 24 months of age, are of relevance for predicting the efficacy of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 in this 
population. 
In children, placebo-controlled studies with T/LAIV enrolling more than 12,000 subjects were 
conducted over 5 influenza seasons from 1996 through 2003 in Europe, Latin America, Africa, 
Asia/Oceania, and USA. In these studies, Fluenz consistently demonstrated protective efficacy against 
laboratory-confirmed influenza illness, following 2 primary doses of administration or a single dose re-
vaccination in the second season (Table 19).

children in AV006 1996-1997 season and 57.7% (95% CI: 44.7, 67.9) in D153-P504 2001 season 
were protected from culture-confirmed influenza illness. Efficacy associated with a single dose was 
numerically or statistically lower than that of 2-dose regime. 
Results of D153-P501 showed that, prior recipients of 2 primary doses of Fluenz in 2000-2001 without 
re-vaccination in 2001-2002 were still protected from laboratory confirmed influenza illness. Such a 
persistent efficacy into the second season was estimated to be 56.2% (95% CI: 30.5, 72.7) against 
matched strains and 44.8% (95% CI: 18.2, 62.9) against all strains regardless of match. A very 
similar finding was seen in D153-P504, with estimated persistent efficacy of 57% (95%CI: 6, 82) 
against matched strains and 35% (95% CI: -0.3, 59) against all strains regardless of match. Both 
studies showed that re-vaccination with a single dose of Fluenz in the second season provided 
additional benefit. 
No immunological correlate of protection has been identified for Fluenz or LAIVs in general. Whereas 
the presence of a serum antibody response has been associated with protection from influenza illness, 
the absence of a significant serum antibody response following FluMist/Fluenz vaccination does not 
necessarily indicate absence of protection. 
Co-Administration with other live vaccines 
The co-administration of Fluenz with other live attenuated vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, 
varicella, and orally administered poliovirus) has been studied in 3 studies with children 6 to < 36

months of age. All 3 studies assessed whether concomitant Fluenz would interfere with the immune 
responses to the other vaccines. No clinically meaningful changes in immune responses to measles, 
mumps, varicella, orally administered poliovirus or influenza vaccines have been observed. The 
immune response to a single dose of rubella vaccine was significantly altered. However, this alteration 
might not be of clinical relevance with the two dose immunisation schedule of the rubella vaccine. This 
observation with the seasonal T/LAIV vaccine is relevant to the use of Pandemic influenza vaccine 
H5N1 MedImmune, because Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 MedImmune and T/LAIV are 
manufactured by the same process. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The studies conducted with P/LAIV were open-labelled, small sample size, uncontrolled, and enrolled 
healthy adults but not the target group of vaccination based on the indication (i.e. paediatric subjects). 
These clinical studies had been conducted using the proposed commercial vaccine formulation and a 
dose regimen for which efficacy and effectiveness have been established for seasonal and pandemic 
H1N1pdm09 LAIVs. Serving as scientific proof of concept for predicting efficacy in paediatrics, there 
are no concerns related to study design. A statement by the Applicant that all clinical studies were 
performed in compliance with GCP or equivalent ethical standards was provided. 
No validated assays were used and no blinding of laboratory personnel was undertaken for the 3 
pivotal studies. However, qualified HAI and MN assays were used for CIR277 and for CIR293, the key 
supportive study. The extensive testing of qualification parameters, especially for HAI assay, supports 
the conclusion that the booster data generated in CIR277 are of satisfactory credibility. The use of the 
ISO 9001 certified laboratory also alleviates the concern of bias due to the absence of blinding 
measure in CIR277. The Applicant was recommended and agreed to submit post-authorisation the 
validation reports of HI and MN assays used in study CIR 277.  
In pivotal studies CIR 217 and CIR 239 as well as in other P/LAIV studies, a predominantly Black 
American male population was enrolled. As such, this study population would not reflect the 
demographic situation in the EU. However, previous studies conducted with FluMist/Fluenz revealed 
that the safety and efficacy of the vaccine are not affected by the race and ethnicity of the vaccine 
recipients. Additional studies conducted at the University of Rochester and studies with the 2009 
H1N1pdm vaccine sponsored by MedImmune enrolled a racially and ethnically more diverse set of 
subjects. 
Efficacy data  
The available data from CIR217 (P/LAIV H5N1 VN04), CIR239 (P/LAIV H5N1 HK03), URMC11-001 
(P/LAIV H7N7), URMC13-001 (P/LAIV H7N9) and other 3 P/LAIV studies showed that, following 2-
doses of these P/LAIV candidates in naive adults, the primed serological responses were commonly 
undetectable by the currently available immunoassays, which is consistent with previous observations 
made for seasonal and H1N1pdm09 LAIVs. Some exception to this were the low -up to moderate- 
immune responses against H7N3 and H9N2 vaccine viruses, measured by HAI or MN assay, in studies 
CIR241 and CIR211. This finding supports the assumption about the heterogeneity of serological 
immunogenicity of different P/LAIV candidates. 
Therefore, for P/LAIV H5N1 VN04, the option that was favoured was to show its ability to effectively 
prime naïve subjects in a booster setting, that is to demonstrate notable serological responses in prior 
P/LAIV recipients upon re-vaccination with an inactivated H5N1 VN04 vaccine. Ideally the effect of this 
re-exposure should be assessed shortly after priming, e.g. in an interval of weeks or a few months. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 62/92 
  
  
The presented data from the prime-boost study CIR277 illustrated serological responses to re-
vaccination approximately 5 years following priming in prior P/LAIV H5N1 recipients. Against wild-type 
H5N1 VN04 virus the functional HAI and MN antibodies were detected in 73% (8/11 seroresponders, 
i.e. subjects with at least a 4 fold increase in antibody titre vs. baseline values, or a titre of ≥ 1:20) of 
the re-vaccinated subjects at Day 28, after re-exposure to an inactivated vaccine. Of the P/LAIV naïve 
subjects, only 10% (1 dose of IIV) or 40% (2 doses of IIV) had seroconverted by day 28. The 
proportion of HAI seroresponders was 64% by Day 7, with a GMT of 165 and a titre range from 20 to 
1280 in responding subjects. Of the P/LAIV-naive subjects, only 10% had ≥ 4-fold rises by Day 7 after 
1 dose of IIV (GMT 8). The GMTs of HAI and MN antibodies peaked at Day 28, starting to decline at 
Day 56 and gradually reached undetectable level by Month 6. These serological responses are clearly 
characteristic of memory B cell responses. Since control cohorts of subjects (not primed by P/LAIV) 
commonly failed to develop such rapid and significant responses, it can be reasonably concluded that 
these memory responses can be ascribed to the original priming with P/LAIV H5N1 VN04. Preliminary 
data from study CIR 293 indicate that a similar or greater recall response could be boosted after a 
shorter interval (see below). 
Against heterologous strains the serum antibodies of responding subjects with a MN titre of ≥1:40 
neutralised H5N1 viruses of clade 2.1.3, clade 2.3.4, clade 2.2.1, and clade 2.2.1, demonstrating 
broadly neutralising activity of these antibodies. Consistent with this finding was the observation of 
increased antibody affinity in responding subjects. 
Booster responses in prior recipients of only 1-dose P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 vaccine were not evaluated in 
study CIR277. Therefore, it remains to be fully elucidated whether a 1-dose regimen of P/LAIV has 
sufficient priming capacity. However, existing data from seasonal trivalent LAIV vaccine did show 
additional benefit of the second dose in very young children. In the monkey model, a single 2x106 
TCID50 dose was ineffective in protecting against homologous wild-type virus challenge, in contrast to 
complete protection offered by 2 doses of vaccine. Interim results from study CIR 293 (further down) 
seems to be consistent with this conclusion. It may be argued that doses higher than 107.5 TCID50 
could lead to more efficient immune responses. However the Applicant concluded to maintain for 
P/LAIV the dose previously established based on substantial safety and efficacy data generated with 
the seasonal and H1N1 LAIVs. 
The ability of H5N1 P/LAIV to induce T cell responses was demonstrated in study CIR217. After 2 doses 
of P/LAIV H5N1 VN, influenza-specific T-cell responses to internal viral proteins (M and NP) were 
detected in most vaccinees. T-cell responses comprised both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that were specific 
for influenza M and NP antigens and showed cytotoxic activities. Concerning HA, T-cell responses 
displayed lower responses vs. the H5 HA antigen, as compared to other HA proteins of seasonal 
influenza viruses. This finding indicates that P/LAIV may preferentially boost pre-existing specific T cell 
responses to the HA of the seasonal influenza virus (H1 and H3) rather than H5N1 HA. 
The data of study URMC11-001 similarly showed the nature of a recalled memory responses in prior 
recipients of 2 doses of P/LAIV H7N7 candidate, upon re-exposure to H7N7 antigen via an inactivated 
vaccine. In this setting where re-exposure occurred 18-24 months later, the boosted responses peaked 
at Day 14 post-booster immunization: the cross-reactive HAI antibodies against H7N3 P/LAIV ca, H7N3 
wt, and H7N9 wt developed in 69%, 46% and 69% of the subjects respectively, and the MN antibodies 
in 62%, 38% and 69% respectively. 
Data up to Day 82 were submitted for URMC13-001. In this study setting where prime-boost interval 
was approximately 3 months, a robust response was detected on Day 7 in prior recipients of 2 doses of 
P/LAIV H7N9 candidate, upon re-exposure to H7N9 antigen in an inactivated vaccine (H7N9IIV). Thus, 
the H7N9 P/LAIV candidate vaccine primed for a rapid, robust antibody response to H7N9 IIV.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 63/92 
  
  
The interim results of CIR293 were included in the Day 120 responses. The data indicate that P/LAIV 
priming led to robust booster responses to H7N9 pIIV. The magnitude and frequency of HAI responses 
were greater in subjects primed with 2 doses of P/LAIV than in subjects primed with 1 dose P/LAIV or 
unprimed subjects (~100% of subjects vs. ~50%, respectively, had a ≥ 4 fold increase in HAI titre 
from baseline at day 14 post IIV (when administered 8 weeks post P/LAIV)). In addition, subjects 
primed with a single dose of P/LAIV had more robust responses by Day 14 than unprimed subjects who 
received 2 doses of inactivated vaccine (~50% responders and GMT ~24 vs. ~30% responders and 
GMT <8, respectively). The boosted HAI response followed typical kinetic as expected, with rapid onset 
as early as at Day 7, peaked at Day 14, and gradually declined thereafter. A dosing interval as short as 
4 weeks appeared successful as there was no significant difference between the 4- and 8-week dosing 
intervals between P/LAIV prime and pIIV boost doses. Data from this study are of highly supportive 
value because of the relevance of prime-boost interval to re-exposure in a pandemic situation. Indeed 
these data suggest that P/LAIV H7N9 primed naïve subjects for a HAI response that could be 
significantly boosted upon antigen re-exposure shortly after priming. In addition, the advantage of a 2 
doses-regimen over 1-dose regimen of P/LAIV H7N9 in priming was evidenced. Final results of study 
CIR293 should be submitted as soon as they are available. 
It has to be reiterated that the immune response to the inactivated pandemic vaccine used for 
boosting in the prime-boost studies provides useful information on the ability of P/LAIV to prime 
various age groups against a poorly immunogenic influenza strain to which most humans, if not all, are 
naive. This study design including a boost dose by an inactivated vaccine is considered useful as an 
indirect proof of the potential for protection of a pandemic LAIV in the absence of efficacy data in the 
interpandemic period. Therefore the posology in the P/LAIV SmPC reflects the use of P/LAIV only as a 
protective vaccine following administration of 2 doses. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Effectiveness and/or efficacy of pandemic/H1N1pdm09 and seasonal LAIVs 
Supportive data gathered in the US during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic indicate that H1N1pdm09 LAIV is 
highly effective, especially in young children. A large difference in effectiveness was observed between 
the 10-49 year and the 2-9 year age strata (26.4% vs. 81.9% with a 7 day interval, from Griffin et al, 
2011). Without additional stratified analysis in the 10-49 year group, the lower efficacy in this age 
stratum cannot be considered indicative of how well the LAIV actually performs in subjects 10-17 years 
of age. In addition, due to the small number of cases the study was not adequately powered to assess 
effectiveness in this age group. Similar results were obtained from 2 other effectiveness studies in 
children. 
Supportive data from placebo-controlled paediatric studies comprising over 20,000 infants, toddlers, 
children and adolescents demonstrate vaccine efficacy for seasonal LAIVs from 62-93% for matched 
strains and 47-93% for all strains regardless of match. 
Additional efficacy data to be provided in the context of a preparedness pandemic vaccine  
Data demonstrating formal clinical efficacy of P/LAIV could not be generated since efficacy of a 
pandemic vaccine cannot be tested in the absence of a circulating pandemic virus. Instead, the 
expected efficacy of P/LAIV against pandemic influenza is inferred based on the following data:   
1.  Immunogenicity data gathered from adult clinical studies performed with candidate P/LAIVs; 
2.  Immunogenicity data gathered from adult clinical studies in which an inactivated pandemic 
vaccine was administered to unmask the long-lasting immunity induced by prior receipt of 
P/LAIV; 
3.  Effectiveness data in children gathered with the H1N1pdm P/LAIV during the 2009 Pandemic;  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 64/92 
  
  
4.  Clinical efficacy data obtained with Fluenz in immunologically naïve young children. 
This approach is usually followed for pandemic preparedness vaccines, such as P/LAIV, whereby the 
vaccine is authorised in advance of a pandemic based on a core dossier that includes a minimum set of 
data needed to define the benefit risk balance in an emergency situation. For P/LAIV the core dossier is 
summarised by points 1 to 4 above, and, in addition, appropriate specific obligations have been 
identified in the context of a conditional marketing authorisation, in order to address the gaps in 
knowledge post-approval. P/LAIV can only be used after a pandemic is duly recognised in the EU and 
after a variation application is submitted to include in the vaccine the declared pandemic strain. Such 
specific obligations for P/LAIV include studies which aim at confirming vaccine performance with the 
actual pandemic strain, i.e. safety (see relevant section) and effectiveness in the intended target 
population. The CHMP requested that as soon as the vaccine is deployed during the next pandemic the 
MAH should conduct an observational effectiveness study in community dwelling children and 
adolescents to identify breakthrough cases of influenza by laboratory confirmation. Effectiveness data 
is expected to provide confirmation on the efficacy of the actual pandemic vaccine in the intended 
target population. 
Further details of the effectiveness study have been considered by the PRAC during the MAA evaluation 
and are included in the agreed RMP. 
In addition, as per agreed PIP, a single arm clinical trial in children and adolescent will investigate the 
safety and reactogenicity of the pandemic vaccine (see safety section), but also will explore as 
secondary endpoint the immunogenicity of the actual pandemic strain. This will provide supportive 
data on immunogenicity aspects of the actual pandemic strain in naïve children. For further details see 
the safety section. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The presented data are consistent and demonstrate that the proposed 2-dose regime of P/LAIV H5N1 
is able to prime naïve adults and to elicit a memory response lasting at least 4-5 years, which is 
considered relevant for the claimed indication in children and adolescents 1-18 years of age. Pivotal 
immunogenicity data from CIR277 are considered sufficient for initial assessment of immunogenicity 
profile of P/LAIV H5N1 candidate vaccine and, in addition to the large body of evidence on efficacy in 
children with relevant seasonal and pandemic strains included in the same LAIV platform, are deemed 
sufficient to establish the benefits of P/LAIV and establish a dosing recommendation in the context of 
pandemic preparedness activities for future pandemics in the claimed paediatric indication.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a pandemic preparedness vaccine:

agreed:  
1.  Submit the validation of HAI and MN assays performed for study CIR277, pending availability of 
the sera. 
2.  For study CIR293, provide the results of the serological testing performed at Southern Research 
against wild-type viruses as soon as they are available.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Tables 21 and 22 summarise the patient exposure to the H5N1 P/LAIV and to the other P/LAIVs tested 
for this application (i.e. H2N2, H2N3, H6N1, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9, and H9N2 P/LAIV). 59 subjects 
received at least one dose of H5N1 P/LAIV based on two different strains (ca A/Vietnam/1203/2004 
and ca A/Hong Kong/213/2003) and 288 were exposed to the P/LAIVs based on the other potential 
pandemic strains. Only healthy adults from 18 to 49 years of age were enrolled in the studies. 
Safety data from 300 adults 18 to 49 years of age and 324 children 2 to 17 years of age who received 
at least one dose of H1N1pdm LAIV in two clinical trials conducted during the pandemic situation in 
2009 are considered supportive.

Adverse events 
Pivotal H5N1 P/LAIV studies 
Study reports, protocols, publications and study narratives were submitted for the 3 pivotal H5N1 
studies. For the supportive P/LAIV studies with other vaccine candidates of pandemic potential only 
study narratives with or without publications were submitted. This was agreed upon during preliminary 
discussions with the Applicant. 
In summary, based on the review of the limited safety data from the pivotal H5N1 P/LAIV studies and 
the supportive P/LAIV studies conducted with other pandemic vaccine candidates, the solicited 
symptoms reflect the mechanism of action of LAIVs and are consistent with those previously observed 
with seasonal LAIVs (Fluenz and Fluenz tetra) and with the monovalent H1N1pdm LAIV evaluated in 
the setting of the influenza pandemic in 2009. The new safety data evaluated in this dossier are 
derived from adults from 18 to 49 years of age. 
CIR 217 
The most frequently reported AE considered to be possibly related to the study vaccine in all subjects 
following any dose was headache (12 subjects), followed by AEs affecting the upper respiratory tract, 
like rhinorrhoea (3 subjects), nasal congestion and sore throat (1 subject each). Other AEs possibly 
related to the study vaccine were fever, myalgia, stomach cramps, diaphoresis and diarrhoea (one 
subject each). Other events for which relatedness could not be totally excluded (“remote”) were cough, 
conjunctival erythema, indigestion, nosebleed, pharyngitis and sinus congestion. All events were of 
mild or moderate intensity and all resolved. One participant with a history of wheezing had transient 
asymptomatic wheezing noted by auscultation on Day 2 and on Day 7 following Dose 1. The subject 
did not receive a second vaccine dose.  
CIR 239 
The most frequently reported RE/AE possibly related to the study vaccine in all subjects following any 
dose was headache experienced by 9 subjects, followed by nasal congestion in 4 subjects. Other 
REs/AEs possibly related to the study vaccine were rhinorrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, 
lymphadenopathy cervical, chills, sore throat and throat pain (reported by one subject each). The 
events were of mild to moderate intensity. All events resolved. 
CIR 277 (prime-boost study) 
Assessment report

No P/LAIV was administered in this study. The administered inactivated H5N1 influenza vaccine was 
generally well tolerated in all groups. None of the previously P/LAIV recipients reported local AEs.  
In the overall study population, the most common systemic solicited AE in the study was headache (4 
events) followed by fatigue (3 events), nausea (3 events), vomiting (2 events) and myalgia (1 event). 
All systemic solicited AEs were deemed to be mild. The most common AEs in all groups were injection 
site pain (15.9%), respiratory rate (8.7%), contusion (5.8%), diastolic hypertension (5.8%), headache 
(4.3%), fatigue (4.3%), and blood pressure increased (4.3%).  
The Applicant claims that the P/LAIV generally exhibited a safety profile similar to that of seasonal 
LAIV, with reports of a few minor illnesses. For the H5N1 P/LAIV this is based on comparison of AEs 
from 59 subjects in two studies with several tens of thousands in Fluenz/Fluenz Tetra subjects.  
The CHMP agrees with this assessment, although the H5N1 data are limited. 
Supportive P/LAIV studies 
The assessment is based on publications and study narratives. 
288 adult healthy subjects were exposed to P/LAIVs based on other vaccine strains with pandemic 
potential. In comparison to subjects in the H5N1 studies, the most frequently reported RE/AEs were 
headache and nasal congestion. Overall, the P/LAIVs were well tolerated and the safety profile was 
comparable to that of seasonal T/LAIV and Q/LAIV. 
Safety of H1N1 P/LAIV 
The US FDA approved all of the Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccines as a strain change to each 
manufacturer’s approved seasonal influenza vaccine. In support of this strain change monovalent H1N1 
P/LAIV vaccine prepared from the new A/California/7/2009 strain was evaluated in two studies (MI-
CP215 and MI-CP217). Both studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and were 
conducted at multiple sites in the United States from August 2009 through March 2010. The study 
objectives were to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 2 doses of H1N1 LAIV in either healthy 
children aged 2 to 17 years or healthy adults aged 18 to 49 years.  
The primary safety endpoint was the occurrence of fever ≥ 38.3°C (101° F) during Day 1 to Day 8 
after Dose 1. Additional safety endpoints included solicited events, AEs, and antipyretic and analgesic 
use from Day 1 through Day 8 and from Day 1 through Day 15 following each vaccination. SAEs and 
new onset chronic diseases (NOCDs) were collected through Day 180 following the final dose. Solicited 
symptoms included fever (temperature was recorded daily), runny nose (adults) or runny/stuffy nose 
(children), sore throat, cough, vomiting (adults), muscle aches, chills (adults), decreased activity, 
decreased appetite (children), and headache. 
Generally the two studies demonstrated that 2 doses of the H1N1 P/LAIV are safe in children from 2 to 
17 years of age and in adults from 18 to 49 years of age. 
Safety data were collected from 324 children following dose 1 (259 received H1N1 P/LAIV and 65 
received placebo) and 318 children following dose 2 (255 received vaccine and 63 placebo), and from 
300 adults following Dose 1 (240 received vaccine and 60 received placebo) and 283 adults following 
dose 2 (228 received vaccine and 55 received placebo).  
There was no statistical difference between treatment groups for the primary endpoint in children or 
adults. Among children, fever ≥38.3 °C occurred in 1.5% (n= 4) of vaccine recipients and in 1.5% (n= 
1) of placebo recipients following Dose 1 (95% CI: –6.4%, 3.1%), and in 1.2% (n= 3) and 0% 
following Dose 2 (rate difference, 1.2%; 95% CI: –4.1%, 3.7%) respectively. Fever was not reported 
among adult subjects following Dose 1 but was reported in 0.4% (n= 1) and in 1.8% (n= 1) of vaccine 
and placebo recipients respectively following Dose 2 (rate difference, –1.4%; 95% CI: –8.7%, 1.4%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 69/92 
  
  
The percentage of individuals reporting solicited symptoms decreased in both adults and children 
following Dose 2. Also antipyretic and/or analgesic use following Dose 1 and 2 was not significantly 
different among vaccine and placebo recipients in both studies. 
In conclusion, the adverse event profile of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine was comparable to that of the 
seasonal T/LAIV and Q/LAIV. The Applicant has described the background for using fever as the safety 
endpoint in the two pandemic H1N1 studies in children and adults. The starting point was the annual 
safety studies performed in the US in adults, which were used as models for the paediatric and adults 
H1N1 safety studies. In those studies, a vaccinated group is compared to a placebo group regarding 
the rate of fever. The equivalence criteria used in these studies is 5% for the upper limit of 95% CI of 
the difference (FluMist minus placebo). Based on a different risk-benefit consideration in the case of a 
pandemic vs. a normal influenza season (a vaccine with a slightly higher rate of fever than placebo 
would still have the potential to provide substantial overall benefit), the Applicant has argued for a 
higher limit of demonstrating equivalence, i.e. criterion of 10%, in the pandemic H1N1 studies. This is 
agreed. Concerning the use of the same equivalence criterion of 10% difference for children and 
adults, a higher rate of fever in children could be expected compared to adults in the vaccine group -
and therefore a higher difference. However for both age groups the difference in rate of fever was 
0.0%. In the case of children the upper limit of 95% CI of the difference was 3.1 and for adults it was 
1.9. As no subjects reported fever in the adult group, the higher limit for equivalence compared to 
seasonal vaccine could have been also set at 5%. However, the equivalence criteria are justified based 
on vaccine strain and target population.  
MI-CP 215 
The most common solicited symptom reported by adults through Day 8 post Dose 1 was headache. 
The rate of headache did not significantly differ between vaccine recipients and placebo recipients 
(25.4% versus 20.0% of subjects respectively). Significantly more vaccine recipients than placebo 
recipients experienced runny nose (15.4% versus 5.0%) and muscle aches (6.7% versus 0.0%).  
Adverse events considered by the investigator to be related to investigational product were reported in 
7.9% of subjects in the vaccine and 8.3% placebo group through 15 days post Dose 1. The only 
vaccine related AEs ≥1% in the vaccine group were nasal congestion (1.3%), throat irritation (1.3%) 
and rash (1.3%). 
MI-CP 217 
Like in adults the most common solicited symptom in the paediatric population through Day 8 post 
dose 1 was headache (16.6% of subjects receiving vaccine and 15.4% of subjects receiving placebo; 
rate difference, 1.2%; 95% CI: –10.2%, 10.2%). Runny nose/nasal congestion was the solicited 
symptom reported more frequently by vaccine recipients with the highest rate difference compared to 
placebo recipients (15.8% versus 12.3%, RD3.5 % [95% CI: -7.2, 11.8]).  
The most common AEs in the paediatric vaccine group, reported in a frequency ≥ 1.0% through Day 
15 post Dose 1 were vomiting (2.7%), nausea (1.9%), diarrhoea (1.5%), abdominal pain upper 
(1.5%) and ear pain (1.2%). 
Post-marketing safety assessment of H1N1 P/LAIV 
The safety of monovalent H1N1 LAIV was evaluated using data generated from the Vaccine Safety 
Datalink (VSD) Database (Lee et al, 2011). Eleven potential neurologic, allergic, and cardiac AEs were 
monitored. No significant associations were noted during sequential analyses for the monitored events. 
As of May 2010, a total of 267,715 monovalent H1N1 P/LAIV doses were administered. 
Safety of Q/LAIV 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016

CSRs from 3 clinical studies (MI-CP208, MI-CP185 and MI-CP206) evaluating the immunologic non 
inferiority of Q/LAIV compared to T/LAIV provide supportive safety data for the approval of the 
pandemic preparedness vaccine P/LAIV. The 3 studies were previously submitted to the EMA and were 
reviewed to approve Fluenz Tetra in the EU. 
The studies evaluated the safety profile of Q/LAIV directly compared to that of T/LAIV in 2 pivotal 
studies. Study MI-CP208 was conducted in paediatric subjects (2 to 17 years of age) and study MI-
CP185 in adult subjects (18 to 49 years of age). In an additional study (MI-CP 206) Q/LAIV was 
administered to adults 18 to 49 years of age by a novel blow-fill seal device (BFS) as a stream in one 
nostril as opposed to a spray into two. 
In summary, the safety profile of Fluenz Tetra was similar to that of the trivalent Fluenz. 
The proportion of subjects reporting any solicited symptom following Dose 1 in the paediatric 
population of study MI-CP208 was comparable between the Q/LAIV subjects and all T/LAIV subjects 
(overall 47.9% versus 47.4%) following Dose 1. Fever ≥ 38.5°C was more often reported by Q/LAIV 
subjects compared to T/LAIV subjects (5.7% versus 3.9% of subjects) following Dose 1. Fever was the 
only solicited AE reported with a rate difference ≥ 1.0 %. The overall rates of fever were low and fever 
was generally mild or moderate. Runny nose/nasal congestion was the most commonly reported 
solicited AE in both vaccine groups (32.3% of Q/LAIV subjects versus 32.0% of all T/LAIV subjects). 
The proportion of subjects reporting any solicited AE in the 2 dose groups decreased from Dose 1 to 
Dose 2 in both vaccine arms. AEs were balanced with 21.0% of subjects in the Q/LAIV and 20.7% in 
the T/LAIV reporting any AE. The most commonly reported AE was vomiting in both groups. 
In the adult population enrolled in study MI-CP185 the rates of solicited symptoms was comparable 
between Q/LAIV and T/LAIV recipients (59.6% in the Q/LAIV and 60.0% in the T/LAIV vaccine group). 
Runny/stuffy nose, reported by 4.1% more Q/LAIV recipients than T/LAIV recipients, was the most 
commonly reported solicited symptom (43.6% of subjects in the Q/LAIV and 39.5% in the T/LAIV 
vaccine group), followed by headache (28.2% versus 27.5%), sore throat (19.0% versus 19.8%), 
lethargy (17.6% versus 17.8%) and cough (13.6% versus 12.6%). 
The most common AEs reported in the study through Day 28 were sneezing, oropharyngeal pain, 
rhinorrhoea and upper respiratory tract infections. 
Safety of T/LAIV 
T/LAIV was approved in June 2003 under the trade name of FluMist in the US and 2011 in the EU 
under the trade name of Fluenz. Since December 2013, the QLAIV, Fluenz Tetra, has replaced the 
T/LAIV, Fluenz, in the EU. Safety data to support the approval of Fluenz in the EU derived from over 
141,000 subjects who received the frozen or refrigerated liquid formulation of Fluenz in 73 clinical and 
post marketing studies that were conducted from 1994 to 2008 in multiple regions of the world. 39 
studies included more than 39,000 children aged 7 weeks to 17 years of age. Additionally, to date over 
80 million doses of T/LAIV have been distributed commercially. 
Overall, based on the review of clinical data during the assessment of the Fluenz MAA, T/LAIV was 
considered safe and well tolerated in adults and children with a safety profile similar to that of TIV. 
To support the proposed age indication for the pandemic preparedness vaccine (i.e. 12 months of age 
through less than 18 years of age), pooled safety data for solicited events (SEs) and AEs derived from 
TIV- and placebo-controlled studies with more than 37,000 subjects 1 to 17 years of age were included 
in the application dossier. The pooled safety data were previously submitted to the EMA and reviewed 
to support approval of Fluenz in the EU. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 71/92 
  
  
Of the 37,968 subjects 1 to 17 years of age who received either refrigerated or frozen T/LAIV and 
contributed data to the pooled analysis for Year 1, 17,922 received 2 doses. Of the 15,322 subjects 
who received refrigerated T/LAIV, 10,466 of subjects received 2 doses. 
As mentioned, T/LAIV was considered safe and well tolerated in adults and children with a safety 
profile similar to that of TIV. In subjects <18 years of age, runny/stuff nose was more commonly 
observed in the T/LAIV group than the TIV groups (59.3% versus 47.0%). Other solicited AEs through 
Day 10 occurred only in a slightly higher rate in Fluenz recipients compared with the TIV group: 
decreased appetite (16.8% in T/LAIV recipients versus 15.9% in TIV recipients), irritability (16.9% 
versus 15.5%, respectively), headache (10.5 versus 9.5%) and fever ≥ 38.0° C (10.9% versus 9.9%). 
High fever (≥39.5° C) was no more common in T/LAIV subjects than in subjects who received placebo 
or TIV. The most frequently reported AE that occurred at a higher rate in T/LAIV than TIV or placebo 
subjects was pyrexia. 
The incidence of solicited AEs was lower post Dose 2 compared with the incidence post Dose 1 in 
T/LAIV studies.  
Wheezing in individuals below 24 months of age for T/LAIV 
A major identified safety signal for the T/LAIV was the increased risk of wheezing through 42 days post 
vaccination in children below 24 months of age. Study AV019, a Phase 3, placebo-controlled study 
conducted in 9,689 children 1 to 17 years of age indicated a signal for asthma/reactive airway disease 
in children 18 to 35 months of age. Based on this finding in the subgroup analysis, a pivotal study (MI-
CP 111) was conducted to evaluate the safety in children 6 to 59 months of age. MI-CP111 was a large 
randomised, double-blind, multicentre trial conducted in children 6 to 59 month of age in the US, Asia, 
Europe and Middle East. The study evaluated safety and relative efficacy of T/LAIV compared to TIV. 
4243 subjects were randomised in the LAIV group, and 4232 in the TIV group. Children who had 
previously received any influenza vaccine were to receive one dose of either T/LAIV or TIV and children 
who never had previously received any influenza vaccine received two doses of vaccine. 
An increased rate of medical significant wheezing (MSW) up to 42 days after vaccination was seen in 
infants and toddlers from 6 to 23 months of age (5.9% of subjects in the in T/LAIV versus 3.8% in the 
TIV group, p-value 0.002). The rate of wheezing was not higher in children 24 months and older 
receiving T/LAIV compared TIV. 
The increased incidence of MSW was particularly seen in children with a history of wheezing/asthma: 
11% of subjects below 24 months of age with a history of wheezing in the one dose LAIV group 
reported the wheezing through Day 28 following dose one, in the TIV group it was 2.0%, respectively. 
In subjects of the same age range without a prior history of wheezing, AEs were reported by 3.7% of 
subjects in the LAIV group through Day 28 and 1.4% in the TIV group. 
The majority of medically significant wheezing events from T/LAIV clinical Study MI-CP111 were 
treated on an outpatient basis. No deaths, intensive care unit admissions, or need for mechanical 
ventilation occurred. The majority of subjects below 24 months of age in the 2 dose group who had 
MWS reported post dose 1 met the criteria for medically significant wheezing based solely on a new 
bronchodilator prescription (40 of 55 in the LAIV group, 73%; and 25 of 34 in the TIV group,74%). 
The rates of respiratory distress in the LAIV and TIV groups were 27% and 21%, respectively, and the 
corresponding rates of hypoxemia were 5% and 12% respectively. Through Day 42 post dosing only 
0.3% of all subjects in the LAIV and 0.2% in the TIV group were hospitalised in association with MSW. 
In the age subgroup below 24 months of age a total of 9 subjects 0.22%) in the LAIV and 3 subjects in 
the TIV vaccine group (0.07%) were hospitalised. No deaths resulted from these events, and none of 
the hospitalized children required mechanical ventilation or admission to an intensive care unit. MSW 
occurred mainly during weeks 2, 3 and 4. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 72/92 
  
  
Hospitalisation in subjects below 12 months of age with T/LAIV 
A statistically significantly increased rate of hospitalizations through 180 days after the receipt of 
T/LAIV compared to the receipt of TIV was observed in subjects 6 to 11 months of age (6.1% versus 
2.6%). Most of the excess hospitalizations in this subset of younger children were due to late events, 
were not temporally clustered, and were due to diagnoses commonly expected to occur in a young 
paediatric population. Most hospitalisations were due to gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections 
and occurred more than 6 weeks post vaccination. The rate of hospitalizations was not increased in 
Fluenz recipients of ages 12 months and older. 
Vaccine virus shedding 
In general, the P/LAIV vaccines were highly restricted in replication with vaccine virus detected in only 
a small proportion of subjects. The peak incidence of shedding generally occurred on Day 1. Vaccine 
virus was more often detected by rRT-PCR than by culture. The incidence of shedding appears slightly 
lower compared to shedding of vaccine virus in adult subjects who received T/LAIV. 
The Applicant discussed the potential variation in the safety profile of potential pandemic strains 
according to the different properties to replicate in humans. Replication of the seasonal vaccine virus in 
humans as measured by shedding has been shown to be age dependent with more shedding at 
younger age. However, the incidence of reactogenicity does not seem to vary by age groups 5-8 years, 
9-17 years or 18-49 years. 
For the vaccine virus strains with a pandemic potential, the data are limited to a small number of 
subjects per strain. When shedding is compared to the rate of adverse events there is no obvious 
association. In conclusion, the data for the seasonal strains as well as the pandemic strains do not 
support an association between replication of the vaccine strains and the rate of adverse events. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
P/LAIV studies (pivotal and supportive) 
SAEs and deaths during the 2 pivotal H5N1 P/LAIV studies were collected through Day 56 for subjects 
receiving a single dose of vaccine and through Day 28 following the second dose of vaccine for 
subjects receiving 2 doses. The two vaccine doses were administered at 4-8 week intervals. Deaths 
and SAEs in the supportive P/LAIV studies were collected until study end. 
There were 4 SAEs in H5N1 study CIR 217, while there was none in H5N1 study CIR 239.   
In subjects receiving H5N1 P/LAIV only one SAE considered to be possibly related to the vaccine by the 
Principal Investigator occurred in study CIR 217. The event was considered to be unrelated to the 
vaccine by the NIH Medical monitor. A 20 year old Black/African American received 2 doses of ca 
A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) vaccine (106.7 TCID50). At Day 7 following Dose 2 laboratory tests 
revealed a Grade 4 absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 443 cells/ ml. The subject was asymptomatic. 
Subject`s baseline account was within a normal range (1526 cells/ml). The result was confirmed at 
Day 8 on the original blood sample. ANC performed at Day 9 was within a normal range (2036 
cells/mm3). 
Other SAEs occurring during the H5N1 P/LAIV studies were swelling/pain of right leg occurring 122 
days post vaccination, traumatic brain damage occurring 129 days post-vaccination and pain at neck 
and shoulder, road traffic accident occurring 144 days post-vaccination. SAEs in the supportive 
pandemic P/LAIV studies were asthma exacerbation occurring at Day 102 following Dose 2 of H7N7 
P/LAIV and gastroenteritis occurring at Day 12 following Dose 1 of H9N2 P/LAIV. All SAEs except the 
traumatic brain damage resolved. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 73/92 
  
  
There were no deaths reported from the H5N1 P/LAIV studies. One death was reported from one 
supportive P/LAIV study (study CIR 293). A 49-year old male died 16 days following the second dose 
of H7N9 P/LAIV (A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9)). As the final autopsy indicated the cause of death was an 
overdose of heroin and fentanyl; the death was assessed as not related to the study vaccine. 
H1N1 P/LAIV studies 
SAEs were formerly assessed by the US FDA for the approval of the H1N1pdm LAIV. 
A total of 5 SAEs were reported by 5 adult subjects, 3 in the vaccination group (depression, cellulitis 
and premature delivery) and 2 in the placebo group (gall bladder disease and possible cervical cancer). 
None of the reported SAEs was considered to be vaccine related. 
Two new onsets of chronic diseases (NOCDs) were reported during the study. One subject in the 
monovalent vaccine group was diagnosed with hypothyroidism on Day 15 post dose 1. One subject in 
the placebo group reported a diagnosis of possible cervical cancer approximately 4 months post dose 1 
(this event was also considered an SAE). Both NOCDs were considered by the Investigator to be 
unrelated to investigational product. 
There were no deaths reported during the adults H1N1 P/LAIV study. 
Three subjects from the paediatric study, two in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group 
reported an SAE during the study (depression 27 days post dose1, osteomyelitis 132 days post dose 2 
and staphylococcal cellulitis of the abdomen and face). None of the SAEs was considered to be vaccine 
related by the investigator. 
One paediatric subject in the placebo group reported a NOCD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) 
on Day 53 of the study. This event was considered by the Investigator to be not related to 
investigational product. 
Seasonal LAIV studies 
SAEs were formerly assessed for the approval of Q/LAIV and T/LAIV. 
Q/LAIV studies  
Serious adverse events related to vaccination were only experienced by 2 subjects: 1 hypersensitivity 
event in a T/LAIV recipient and 1 spontaneous abortion in a Q/LAIV-BSF recipient. For the SAE 
spontaneous abortion, the temporal association led to the assessment of a possible relationship to 
Q/LAIV, but according to the Applicant there is no overall pattern to suggest a causal relationship 
between Q/LAIV and spontaneous abortion. It can be argued that the study population is too small for 
such a pattern to emerge. No definite conclusions on a putative causal relation between Q/LAIV and 
spontaneous abortion can therefore be drawn (see also EPAR Fluenz Tetra, 2013). 
T/LAIV studies 
Analysis of SAEs and deaths case-reports in any ages did not reveal any significant safety concern with 
the use of the product. No death (119 cases for >141,000 Fluenz recipients) was considered to be 
related to Fluenz (see also EPAR Fluenz, 2011). 
Laboratory findings 
In study CIR 217 8 events of ALT increase, 3 events of ANC decrease, one event of microcytic anaemia 
and one event of AST increase were recorded in the Cumulative List. All abnormal findings were of mild 
to moderate intensity and all resolved. Two of the cases of ALT increases (in the high dose group) were 
considered as possibly related to vaccine. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 74/92 
  
  
Three more cases of ALT elevation were assessed as unrelated to P/LAIV and were not listed. In study 
239 one ALT elevation and one thrombocytopenia both on Day 7 following the first vaccination were 
recorded. Both abnormal findings were of mild intensity and resolved. The laboratory anomalies were 
considered to be possibly related to the study vaccine. The platelet count returned to within normal 
limits on Day 9 and the ALT had fully normalized by Day 15. 
The biological plausibility of the ALT elevations in Study CIR 217 and the live attenuated vaccine is 
considered low because of the following aspects: 
1) there does not appear to be a dose-dependent relationship (ALT were elevated in subjects with 
lower doses of vaccines); 
2) ALT elevations at the time of hospital admission are not a prominent feature of the wild-type H5N1 
influenza illness; 
3) ALT elevations, transaminitis and AEs associated with abnormal liver function have been very rarely 
reported with the seasonal LAIV, which contains the same Master Donor Viruses as the pandemic 
vaccine; 
4) potential alternative explanations exist for the mild to moderate asymptomatic increases in ALT 
levels that were seen. 
The assessment of the safety of the seasonal LAIV at the time of marketing authorisation did not 
indicate that hepatobiliary disorders occur at higher levels in LAIV recipients. Liver abnormalities are 
not a known or potential risk for the seasonal LAIV. These findings are therefore considered relevant 
for the P/LAIV dossier, since P/LAIV contains the identical ts, ca and att genetic elements. 
Safety in special populations 
No special populations have been studied with P/LAIV. 
Paediatric population 
No paediatric studies have been performed with P/LAIV. A paediatric study included in the paediatric 
investigational plan is deferred until the next pandemic is declared and a pandemic virus identified. The 
data with the seasonal LAIVs and the H1N1 pandemic vaccine have been submitted and are considered 
supportive for this application. A large amount of confirmatory safety data in paediatrics is expected to 
be generated during the course of the next pandemic (see section on clinical safety discussion). 
The most important group that is different in the indication for use for the P/LAIV compared to 
Fluenz/Fluenz Tetra is the age group 12-24 months. FluMist Quadrivalent in the US, Fluenz and Fluenz 
Tetra in Europe is indicated for children and adolescents from 24 months to less than 18 years of age. 
The reason for the lower limit of the age range of the seasonal LAIVs indication is the increased rate of 
medically significant wheezing and any wheezing observed with Fluenz compared to inactivated 
influenza vaccine (TIV) in the age group 6-23 months and 12-23 months. Below 12 months of age, 
Fluenz also was associated with higher rate of hospitalization for any cause than TIV. 
Increased rates of medical significant wheezing and all cause hospitalisation were observed in the 
pivotal study MI-CP 111 for T/LAIV that was previously submitted to the EMA. No new data pertaining 
to the safety signal of wheezing or all cause hospitalisation were submitted in the dossier for H5N1 
P/LAIV. 
The increased rate of wheezing in infant between 1 and 2 years of age seen with T/LAIV is not 
considered a deterrent for the use of P/LAIV in a H5N1-like pandemic scenario. This is based on 
different benefit/risk considerations in a pandemic vs. a seasonal scenario (see also the sections on 
clinical safety discussion and on benefit/risk assessment). 
Assessment report

Individuals with asthma, wheezing or respiratory disease 
A few T/LAIV studies included subjects with a history of respiratory illness, asthma or wheezing. In 
summary, the safety profile of T/LAIV in subjects of 24 months of age and older was comparable to 
that of the comparator in studies prospectively designed to assess the safety of T/LAIV in subjects with 
asthma and wheezing. 
Subjects with severe asthma and subjects < 5 years of age with recurrent wheezing were excluded 
from all Q/LAIV and P/LAIV studies and from the majority of T/LAIV studies. 
Safety of T/LAIV in children with severe asthma has only been evaluated in one small placebo-
controlled study (Study AV10) were children 9 to 17 years of age with moderate or severe asthma 
where included. The mean change in percent of predicted FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) 
between baseline and visit 3 was similar in both study groups. Other spirometry measures, use of 
albuterol, and various measures of asthma symptoms were also similar in both study groups. 
The Fluenz and Fluenz Tetra SmPC states that “Fluenz/Fluenz Tetra should not be administered to 
children and adolescents with severe asthma or active wheezing because these individuals have not 
been adequately studied in clinical studies”. The use of P/LAIV in these individuals should be 
considered according to the individual benefit/risk considerations during the pandemic. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
Overall, data from a small number of subjects indicated that the use of T/LAIV was safe in subjects 
with mildly to moderately non-HIV related compromised immune function, asymptomatic or mildly 
symptomatic HIV infection or cancer (solid tumours and haematological malignancies). The safety 
profile of LAIV in the clinical trials was comparable to that in healthy individuals. The currently 
available data regarding the use of T/LAIV in the special risk group of mildly to moderately 
immunosuppressed individuals do not indicate any untoward effect, hence the use in these individuals 
may be considered after weighing the anticipated benefits against the potential risks for the individual. 
No data are available for individuals with severe or symptomatic immunosuppression (i.e. clinically 
significant). The use in this latter group might only be considered following the HCP individual 
benefit/risk assessment at the time of a pandemic.  
In 24 HIV-infected children and 25 HIV-negative children 1 through 7 years of age, and in 243 HIV-
infected children and adolescents 5 through 17 years of age receiving stable anti-retroviral therapy, 
the frequency and duration of vaccine T/LAIV virus shedding were comparable to that seen in healthy 
individuals. No adverse effects on HIV viral load or CD4 counts were identified following seasonal 
T/LAIV administration. 
Use during pregnancy 
There are no clinical data available on the use of H5N1/PLAIV in pregnant or lactating women. Limited 
data are available from the use of the seasonal influenza vaccines (T/LAIV and Q/LAIV) in pregnant 
women. Data is available from pregnant females inadvertently dosed with LAIVs in clinical or post-
marketing studies, from spontaneous reports and medical literature. 
Study MI-MA 225 was a Phase 4, retrospective, descriptive, uncontrolled database study to evaluate 
maternal AEs in women exposed to T/LAIV during pregnancy. The study was conducted by analysis of 
an US electronic health insurance claims database of claims from over 50 million individuals. 138 
pregnant women were identified. Overall, no safety signal was detected in maternal outcomes; 
however, the sample size was only sufficient (i.e. with 95% probability) to detect at least 1 event for 
outcomes occurring at a frequency of at least 2.2%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 76/92 
  
  
Data from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database from 1990 to 2009 were 
published by US CDC. 27 reports of LAIV administration to pregnant women were reported and no 
unusual patterns of pregnancy complications or foetal outcomes identified (Moro, 2011). A similar US 
CDC study utilizing data from VAERS reported 113 pregnant women who had received H1N1 2009 
LAIV. No unusual patterns of pregnancy complications or foetal outcomes were observed. 
From the spontaneous reports received, no congenital anomalies were identified. This is consistent as 
influenza infection is not considered to be teratogenic. Therefore it is unlikely that an influenza vaccine 
containing an attenuated influenza virus strain is teratogenic. This is further supported by the 
knowledge that additionally animal developmental toxicity studies conducted with T/LAIV and Q/LAIV 
do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity.  
The human data are limited to assure the safety of P/LAIV during pregnancy so that clear 
recommendations cannot be made, however the available data do not suggest any adverse effect of 
T/LAIV or Q/LAIV on pregnancy or maternal health, which can be reasonably extrapolated to P/LAIV if 
a vaccination is considered necessary based on the benefit/risk considerations by the HCP at the time 
of a pandemic. 
Elderly 
Elderly were excluded from the P/LAIV studies as they are not included in the age indication for the 
seasonal LAIVs in the US were the P/LAIV studies were conducted. The indication for P/LAIV does not 
include the elderly population. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No studies of potential drug-drug or drug-food interactions were conducted with P/LAIV. 
The concurrent use of P/LAIV with antiviral agents that are active against influenza A and/or B viruses 
has not been evaluated; however, based upon the potential for antiviral agents with activity against 
influenza virus to reduce the effectiveness of any LAIV, P/LAIV should not be administered until 48 
hours after the cessation of such antiviral therapy, and these antiviral agents should not be 
administered until 2 weeks after administration of P/LAIV unless medically indicated. If antiviral agents 
and P/LAIV are administered concomitantly, revaccination should be considered when appropriate 
based on clinical judgement. 
Although there are no data linking P/LAIV or Fluenz with Reye’s syndrome, because of the association 
of Reye’s syndrome with aspirin and wild-type influenza infection, P/LAIV co-administration should in 
principle be avoided. P/LAIV should be administered to children and adolescents (2 to 17 years of age) 
who are receiving aspirin, salicylates, or aspirin containing therapy only based on the HCP assessment 
of the risks of administering the vaccine vs. the benefits of receiving the vaccine in a pandemic 
situation. 
The safety and immunogenicity of P/LAIV when administered concurrently with inactivated vaccines 
have not been determined. In the USA, where FluMist has been commercially available since 2003, the 
recommended practice as advised by the United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices 
(US ACIP) has been to consider that FluMist and inactivated vaccines “can be administered 
simultaneously or at any interval between doses” (CDC, 2006). This recommendation remains current 
in the US ACIP’s 2011 recommendation: “Any inactivated vaccine can be administered either 
simultaneously or at any time before or after a… live vaccine” (CDC, 2011). 
P/LAIV can be administered concurrently with the following live, attenuated vaccines: measles, 
mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), varicella vaccine, and orally-administered polio vaccine (OPV) 
based on data from Studies D153-P522, AV018, and D153-P511, conducted with T/LAIV. These studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323530/2016 
Page 77/92 
  
  
were previously submitted to the EMA. Concomitant administration of these vaccines did not change 
their safety profile. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the pivotal H5N1 studies no subject discontinued due to AEs. In study CIR 217 one subject did not 
receive a second vaccine dose due to persistent elevated ALT levels and another subject because of 
asymptomatic wheezing noted by auscultation at Day 2 and Day 7. 
Post marketing experience 
T/LAIV was licensed in the US under the trade name of FluMist and was approved for use in the EU in 
2011 under the trade name of Fluenz. QLAIV was approved in the USA in February 2012 under the 
trade name of FluMist Quadrivalent and in the EU in December 2013 as Fluenz Tetra. Post marketing 
and safety information has been continually monitored and updated for T/LAIV and Q/LAIV. The 
reviewed post-marketing safety data of Fluenz and Fluenz Tetra generally support the safety of LAIVs. 
The benefit/risk for Fluenz and Fluenz Tetra is considered positive since marketing authorisation was 
granted. 
Since LAIV was approved in 2003, a total of 7,864 AEs have been reported in 4,512 unique case 
reports received from all post marketing sources: regulatory authority reports, spontaneous reports, 
and post marketing studies. Of these AEs, 76.2% (5,993/7,864 [5,624 non serious; 369 serious]) were 
from 3,729 unique spontaneous case reports; 14.8% of the AEs (1,163/7,864 [657 non serious; 506 
serious]) were from 361 unique case reports received through the regulatory authorities; and 8.8% of 
the AEs (693/7,864 [225 non serious; 468 serious]) were from 415 unique case reports involving 
subjects enrolled in post marketing studies. Seven unique case reports (15 AEs; 9 non serious; 6 
serious) were obtained from literature sources. 
The most commonly reported AEs (combined non serious AEs and SAEs as reported by MedDRA 
preferred term) from all post marketing sources through the period ending 16 December 2013 were 
expired drug administered (n =1,212), pyrexia (n = 399), drug administered to patient of 
inappropriate age (247), exposure during pregnancy (n = 204), headache (n = 202), drug 
administration error (n = 193), cough (n = 183) rhinorrhoea (n = 178), influenza (n = 169), nasal 
congestion (n = 169) and oropharyngeal pain (n = 161). 
The most commonly reported SAEs from all post marketing sources (as coded by MedDRA preferred 
term) were pyrexia (n = 45), vomiting (n = 36), pneumonia (n = 30), convulsion (n = 22), dyspnoea 
(n = 22), influenza (n = 22), cough (n = 21) and injury (n = 21). 
The SOCs from post marketing studies with the most commonly reported AEs were Injury, Poisoning 
and Procedural Complications (n = 139), Infections and Infestations (n = 112), Gastrointestinal 
Disorders (n = 58), and Pregnancy, Puerperium and Perinatal Conditions (n = 58). The SAEs by 
MedDRA preferred term that were most commonly reported from post marketing studies were injury (n 
= 21), mental disorder (n = 18), pneumonia (n = 15), appendicitis (n = 14), abortion spontaneous (n 
= 12), abdominal pain (n = 10), and dehydration (n=10). 
Important identified risks for LAIVs include Wheezing in children under the age of 2 years and 
Hypersensitivity disorders including anaphylaxis. 
Important potential risks for LAIVs include: Guillain-Barré Syndrome, Bell’s palsy Secondary 
transmission to severely immunocompromised patients, Inadvertent administration to 
immunocompromised patients, Seizures and convulsions, Encephalitis, Neuritis, Vasculitis, Vaccination 
failure (lack of efficacy), Narcolepsy with or without Cataplexy.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The proposed indication for MedImmune’s pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 in the EU is the 
prophylaxis of influenza in children and adolescents from 12 months to less than 18 years of age in an 
officially declared pandemic situation. 
In the 3 pivotal studies investigating H5N1 P/LAIV candidate vaccine and the 10 supportive studies 
evaluating other influenza strains with pandemic potential (i.e. H2N2, H2N3, H6N1, H7N3, H7N7, 
H7N9, and H9N2) only adult subjects were enrolled. Safety and immunogenicity of a monovalent 
P/LAIV carrying the actual pandemic strain in children from 1 year to less than 18 years of age should 
be evaluated when a pandemic is declared. The latter will be reflected as an obligation to the terms of 
the marketing authorisation. 
The extensive safety database that derives from the seasonal LAIVs Fluenz and Fluenz Tetra and from 
the monovalent 2009 H1N1 P/LAIV supports the claim of a comparable safety profile of the P/LAIV. 
The P/LAIV candidate vaccines administered in the clinical trials were generally well tolerated with a 
safety profile comparable to that of seasonal trivalent or quadrivalent LAIVs. No safety signal was 
observed with the P/LAIV. The most commonly reported AEs were headache (25.4%) and symptoms 
affecting the upper respiratory tract (nasal congestion, sore throat – 10.2%). The majority of events 
was of mild intensity and resolved within a few days. Occasionally, changes in safety laboratory 
parameters were noted, including mild to moderate ALT increase, and decrease in platelet count and 
absolute neutrophil count. The assessment of the safety of the seasonal LAIV at the time of marketing 
authorisation did not indicate that hepatobiliary disorders occur at higher levels in LAIV recipients. 
Liver abnormalities are not a known or potential risk for the seasonal LAIV. These findings are 
considered relevant for the PLAIV, since P/LAIV contains identical ts, ca and attenuation att genetic 
elements as the seasonal LAIVs. 
The safety of P/LAIV has not been assessed in special populations such as subjects with asthma, 
wheezing, respiratory disease, or immunosuppression. However, supportive data are available from the 
seasonal LAIVs. Restrictions made for the seasonal LAIVs are deemed applicable for the P/LAIV as 
detailed in previous section and in the SmPC. 
From clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance with T/LAIV and Fluenz Tetra in over 110,000 
children and adolescents 2 to 17 years of age, the following adverse reactions are reported: Decreased 
appetite, Headache, Nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea, Malaise as very common, and Myalgia and Pyrexia 
as common. 
FluMist Quadrivalent in the US, Fluenz and Fluenz Tetra in the European Union all have an age 
restriction in the indication from 2 years of age onwards, children below 2 years of age are excluded 
from the indication. The age restriction in the indication for seasonal LAIVs and the H1N1 P/LAIV is 
based on adverse drug reactions that were seen during the clinical development of seasonal T/LAIV. 
The pivotal study MI-CP 111 was conducted with more than 8000 infants 6 to 59 months of age to 
estimate the safety of T/LAIV compared to TIV. Medically significant wheezing was a predefined 
endpoint. In this study higher rates of medical significant wheezing in children below 2 years of age 
(5.9% versus 3.8%, p-value 0.002) and all cause hospitalisation in toddlers from 6 to 11 month of age 
(6.1% versus 2.6%, p-value 0.002) were observed in the LAIV vs. the TIV vaccine group. The 
difference was statistically significant. For age groups older than 24 months, no differences were seen. 
Study MI-CP111 was previously submitted to the EMA. Notably no deaths resulted from these events, 
and none of the hospitalized children required mechanical ventilation or admission to an intensive care 
unit. In the scenario of a pandemic, particularly with a highly pathogenic influenza virus subtype such 
as H5N1, it is likely that the risks from the use of P/LAIV in children from 12 to 24 months of age may 
be acceptable due to the highest risk of death or severe influenza in this young population. In the PIP, 
Assessment report

a waiver to investigate the paediatric population less than 1 year of age was granted on the grounds 
that the specific medicinal product is likely to be unsafe, and a deferral was granted for conducting a 
clinical trial to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a monovalent P/LAIV in children from 1 year to 
less than 18 years of age until a pandemic is declared (P/0313/2014).  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The safety data gathered in the paediatric population with the seasonal LAIVs and the pandemic H1N1 
LAIV have been submitted as supportive for this application and have been assessed in the sections 
above to conclude that they support the claim of a comparable safety profile to P/LAIV. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional safety data to be provided in the context of a pandemic preparedness vaccine MA  
Due to the limited knowledge gathered in children with a pandemic LAIV, the CHMP requests the 
Applicant to conduct an observational prospective cohort safety study in a large sample of children and 
adolescents from 12 months to less than 18 years of age during the next pandemic. The aim of this 
study is to further investigate the tolerability of P/LAIV and to estimate the incidence of adverse 
reactions of special interest in children and adolescents with the strain causing the next pandemic.  
The CHMP noted that a clinical trial will be conducted in children with the actual pandemic strain as per 
the agreed PIP. This will be an open-label single arm interventional study to evaluate the safety (and 
immunogenicity as secondary endpoint) of P/LAIV in children and adolescents from 12 months to less 
than 18 years of age during the pandemic. 
Both the studies above constitute specific obligations in the context of a MA for a pandemic 
preparedness vaccine.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The exposure of subjects to H5N1 P/LAIV and P/LAIV based on other strains with pandemic potential is 
limited with 59 subjects exposed to H5N1 and 288 subjects exposed to the other candidate vaccines 
and the study population does not reflect the target population as it is restricted to adults 18 to 49 
years of age. In the 3 pivotal H5N1 clinical studies and in the supportive P/LAIV studies the safety 
profile of the P/LAIVs was comparable to that of the seasonal vaccines T/LAIV and Q/LAIV. The 
majority of reactogenicity events included headache and upper respiratory tract infection. 
The monovalent pandemic H1N1 LAIV was demonstrated to be safe in children and adults during the 
2009 pandemic. Extrapolation from data of the extensive safety database of seasonal LAIVs and the 
monovalent H1N1 P/LAIV to the monovalent H5N1 P/LAIV is justified. 
From current knowledge it can be expected that the safety profile of P/LAIV is likely to be comparable 
to that of seasonal LAIVs, i.e. overall safe and well tolerated. However, no data with H5N1 P/LAIV for 
the target population are available; therefore plans have been put in place to confirm the current 
knowledge with data generated at the time of the next pandemic (see below), which will be reflected 
as obligation to the terms of the marketing authorisation. 
FluMist Quadrivalent in the US, Fluenz and Fluenz Tetra in the European Union all have an age 
restriction in the indication from 2 years of age. The lower age limit of 2 years in the seasonal 
indication is based on data from clinical study MI-CP 111 with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine as 
Assessment report

comparator, where a higher rate of hospitalisation was observed for LAIV in the age group 6-11 
months. Also, in the age groups 6-23 months and 12-23 months a higher rate of medical significant 
wheezing was observed for LAIV. For the age group from 24 months and higher, no differences were 
seen. 
As per the agreed PIP, the Applicant will be conducting a clinical trial in children from 1 year to less 
than 18 years of age to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a monovalent P/LAIV when a pandemic 
will be declared, i.e. the vaccine will contain the circulating pandemic strain. The clinical trial conducted 
in the paediatric population during the pandemic will provide further safety data for the benefit/risk 
assessment in respect to the use of the P/LAIV in this population in the pandemic situation. In addition 
the CHMP requests the Applicant to conduct during the pandemic a large observational prospective 
cohort safety study in the paediatric population in order to further investigate the tolerability of P/LAIV 
and to estimate the incidence of adverse reactions of special interest in children and adolescents. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a pandemic preparedness vaccine MA:  
Description 
Background 
1.  In order to further investigate the 
Limited data are available in children with a live 
tolerability of P/LAIV and estimate the 
attenuated vaccine strain with pandemic potential  
incidence of adverse reactions of special 
interest in children and adolescents, the 
MAH should conduct an observational 
prospective cohort safety study in a large 
sample of children and adolescents from 
12 months to less than 18 years of age 
during the next declared pandemic. The 
MAH should submit the results of this 
study. 
2.  In order to further investigate the safety 
Limited knowledge is available regarding the safety of 
and reactogenicity of the P/LAIV, the 
P/LAIV in children before vaccine deployment 
MAH should conduct an open-label single 
arm interventional study to evaluate the 
safety and immunogenicity of P/LAIV in 
children and adolescents from 12 months 
to less than 18 years of age during the 
next declared pandemic. The MAH should 
submit the results of this study.

Risk minimisation measures 
Safety concern 
Routine risk minimisation measures 
Medically significant 
wheezing in children 
12 to <24 months of 
age 
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 MedImmune is not to be used in infants and 
toddlers below 12 months of age because of safety concerns regarding 
increased rates of hospitalisation and wheezing in this population.  
The risk to children 12 through 23 months is considered under missing 
information.  
Hypersensitivity 
(including anaphylaxis) 
Guillain-Barré 
syndrome 
Bell’s palsy 
Secondary 
transmission to 
severely 
immunocompromised 
patients 
Information on this risk is included in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC: 
“Posology and method of administration”, “Special warnings and precautions 
for use” and “Undesirable effects”.  
A clinical study will be conducted at the time that a pandemic is declared or is 
considered imminent that includes children 12 through 23 months of age to 
gather further information on the safety of P/LAIV in this age group. 
The vaccine is contraindicated in people with history of an anaphylactic (i.e. 
life-threatening) reaction to any of the active substances, or to any of the 
inactive substances listed in section 6.1 (e.g. gelatin), or to gentamicin (a 
possible trace residue), to eggs or to egg proteins (e.g. ovalbumin). 
Information on this risk is included in the SmPC, section 4.3 
“Contraindications.”  
However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine, 
provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of 
need.  
Caution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known 
hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance(s), 
to any of the excipients, and to eggs or to egg proteins (e.g. ovalbumin). 
Information on this risk is included in the SmPC, section 4.4, “Special warnings 
and precautions.”  
As with most vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should 
always be readily available to manage an anaphylactic event or serious 
hypersensitivity event after giving Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 
MedImmune.  
Very rare reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome have been observed in the post-
marketing setting with seasonal LAIV. This event is listed in the SmPC, section 
4.8, “Undesirable Effects”.  
Bell’s palsy is included in this RMP as a potential risk, not yet identified in 
people using LAIV products. Therefore, no risk minimisation activities are 
deemed necessary until such time it may be confirmed as an identified risk.  
Those receiving the vaccine are to be warned against contact with people 
whose immune system is compromised.  
The SmPC states in section 4.4, “Special warnings and precautions for use”:   
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 MedImmune is an attenuated live virus 
vaccine and has the potential for transmission to immunocompromised 
contacts. Immune response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic 
immunosuppression may be insufficient.  
Vaccine recipients should be informed that Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 
MedImmune is an attenuated live virus vaccine and has the potential for 
transmission to immunocompromised contacts. Vaccine recipients should 
attempt to avoid, whenever possible, close association with severely 
immunocompromised individuals (e.g. bone marrow transplant recipients 
requiring isolation) for 1-2 weeks following vaccination. Shedding of the H5N1 
vaccine virus in adults was extremely limited. Peak incidence of vaccine virus 
recovery occurred 1-2 days post-vaccination in clinical studies with Pandemic 
influenza vaccine H5N1 MedImmune. In circumstances where contact with 
severely immunocompromised individuals is unavoidable, the potential risk of 
transmission of the influenza vaccine virus should be weighed against the risk 
of acquiring and transmitting wild-type influenza virus.

The SmPC states in section 5.1, “Pharmacodynamic properties”, that the 
effectiveness of Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 MedImmune and of the 
seasonal vaccines T/LAIV and Q/LAIV (Fluenz Tetra) LAIV products in 
preventing influenza illness in immunocompromised individuals has not been 
evaluated. 
Seizures and convulsions are included in this RMP as a potential risk, therefore, 
no risk minimisation activities are deemed necessary until such time it may be 
confirmed as an identified risk.  
Encephalitis is included in this RMP as a potential risk, therefore, no risk 
minimisation activities are deemed necessary until such time it may be 
confirmed as an identified risk.  
Neuritis is included in this RMP as a potential risk, therefore, no risk 
minimisation activities are deemed necessary until such time it may be 
confirmed as an identified risk.  
Vasculitis is included in this RMP as a potential risk, therefore, no risk 
minimisation activities are deemed necessary until such time it may be 
confirmed as an identified risk.  
Vaccination failure 
(lack of efficacy) 
There is no data on the demonstrated efficacy of Pandemic influenza vaccine 
H5N1 MedImmune from controlled clinical studies. The assumption of efficacy 
is based on the seasonal LAIV products.   
Efficacy of seasonal LAIV was shown to be below 100%, therefore it should be 
understood that the pandemic vaccine may not be effective in all recipients. 
Children under the age 
of 12 months 
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 MedImmune is not to be used in children 
younger than 12 months. 
The SmPC states in section 4.2, “Posology and method of administration”:  
MedImmune pandemic influenza vaccine should not be used in infants below 12 
months of age because of safety concerns regarding increased rates of 
hospitalisation and wheezing in this population (see section 4.8). 
Pregnant and breast-
feeding women 
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 MedImmune needs to be given special 
consideration in pregnancy. It is not to be used in women who are breast-
feeding. The SmPC states in section 4.6, “Fertility, pregnancy and lactation”:  
There are no data on the use of Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 MedImmune 
in pregnant women. Healthcare providers need to assess the benefit and 
potential risks of administering Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 MedImmune 
to pregnant women. 
It is not known whether Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 MedImmune is 
excreted in human milk. Therefore, as some viruses are excreted in human 
milk, the vaccine should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Severe asthmatics 
The SmPC states in section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use”: 
The safety of seasonal LAIV in children with severe asthma and active 
wheezing has not been adequately studied. Healthcare providers need to 
assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Pandemic influenza 
vaccine H5N1 MedImmune to these individuals. 
Immunocompromised 
vaccine recipients 
The following text is included in the SmPC, section 4.4 “Special warnings and 
precautions for use”:  
“Immune response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic 
immunosuppression may be insufficient.  
No data are available for individuals with significant clinical immunodeficiency. 
In a pandemic situation, healthcare providers need to assess the potential 
benefits, alternatives, and risks of administering the vaccine to children and 
adolescents with significant clinical immunodeficiency due to conditions or 
immunosuppressive therapy such as: acute and chronic leukaemias; 
lymphoma; symptomatic HIV infection; cellular immune deficiencies; and 
high-dose corticosteroids.  
There is currently no evidence to suggest that vaccine recipients with serious 
chronic diseases are at increased risk compared to the general population. 
Therefore, no action is deemed necessary. 
The exception is those who are clinically immunodeficient: see “Immuno-
compromised vaccine recipients”, above.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the Applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3)(ia) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Significance/Non-Conformity of paediatric studies 
Not applicable.  
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
Applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.  
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet was performed. Instead, a 
bridging report making reference to Fluenz was submitted. As the Fluenz PL covers all format aspects 
of the Pandemic Influenza Vaccine H5N1 MedImmune PL and their overall formats are sufficiently 
similar, the bridging report submitted by the Applicant was considered acceptable. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Article 63(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the Applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
The Applicant requested an exemption to display the common name “Pandemic influenza vaccine” on 
the sprayer label based on the limited available space. The proposed approach would ensure improved 
readability by accommodating the minimum font size of 7pt. The outer carton and intermediate 
packaging would display the common name in the national languages. 
No objections were raised by the QRD Group to omit the common name from the sprayer label. 
The particulars to be omitted described above will however be included in the Annexes published with 
the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will appear in grey-shaded to show that 
they will not be included on the printed materials.  
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EC) No 726/2004, Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 
MedImmune (pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 (live attenuated, nasal)) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in 
any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet shall include a statement 
”This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring” and this will allow for quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

2.10.4.  Conditional Marketing Authorisation 
The CHMP has reviewed the claims from the Applicant and considers that this application is eligible to 
a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in accordance with Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 as it is a medicinal product to be used in emergency situations, in response to public health 
threats duly recognised either by the World Health Organisation or by the EU (Article 2(2) of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006). 
The CHMP concludes that: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product is positive (see section 3); 
it is likely that the Applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data when a pandemic 
occurs; 
there is a an unmet medical need fulfilled by providing a live attenuated pandemic influenza 
preparedness vaccine in children and adolescents; 
the benefit to public health of authorising this pandemic preparedness vaccine in the 
recommended indication outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still 
required on the actual pandemic strain. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 is able to effectively prime naïve adults when administered with a 2-dose regime, 
resulting in an immune memory response that could last for at least 4-5 years. This is based on the 
fact that in response to re-vaccination with an inactivated vaccine given 5 years after priming, an 
immune memory response could still be detected in 73% of the re-vaccinated subjects by two 
functional antibody assays, HAI and MN, measured against the wild-type virus. The antibodies detected 
in this response were broadly cross-neutralising up to 4 heterologous strains, including clade 2.1.3, 
clade 2.3.4, clade 2.2.1, and clade 2.2.1, and persisted for about 6 months before becoming 
undetectable. The measured functional immune response is considered as an acceptable surrogate 
endpoint for clinical protection in the context of the current application, but is not a validated correlate 
of protection for LAIVs at this point in time. In addition the posology of the P/LAIV will consist of 2 
doses of pandemic LAIV only as per current SmPC. 
Produced by the same platform technology as used for P/LAIV H5N1 VN04, P/LAIV H7N7 and P/LAIV 
H7N9 candidates demonstrated a similar priming capability in naïve adults. The available data 
generated in prime-boost setting with both candidates support the conclusion that detection of greater 
antibody responses to a boost with an inactivated vaccine is possible even when re-vaccination with 
the inactivated pandemic vaccine is performed at earlier intervals, i.e. as early as 4 weeks from P/LAIV 
vaccination (~90% responders in P/LAIV vaccinees vs. 30% responders in P/LAIV naïve at 14 days 
post IIV vaccination - with H7N9 antigens). 
In ferrets challenged with the homologous and the heterologous wild-type H5N1 viruses, the 2-doses 
of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 demonstrated to be highly efficacious in preventing challenge virus replication 
both in lungs and in nasal turbinates. In African Green Monkeys, one fifth clinical dose of the vaccine 
given intranasally and intratracheally, at Day 0 and 28, provided effective protection against 
homologous wild-type virus challenge. In the latter animal model, induction of serological functional 
antibodies by vaccination was evidenced, suggestive of correlation with protection.

Together human adult immunogenicity data and animal challenge data provide cumulative proof of 
concept for inferring priming capacity of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 in naïve paediatric subjects 1 to 17 years 
of age. 
The potential efficacy of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 in this population may further be predicted based on other 
existing data, including the large body of clinical efficacy data generated with the seasonal T/LAIV in 
subjects aged 6 months and above, and effectiveness data of pandemic monovalent H1N1pdm09 LAIV 
reported for children aged 2 years and above. The latter data showed an estimated effectiveness of up 
to 82% in the 2-9 year age strata, which is quite favourable for a pandemic vaccine. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No validated HAI and MN assays were used for the clinical testing programme, including the CIR277 
study, although fully qualified HAI and MN assays were used for the key studies CIR277 and CIR293. 
Lack of formal assay validation was accepted, given the reassurance on assay performance provided 
by the extensive qualification. 
Studies conducted in prime-boost setting did not enrol a large number of subjects, however the 
limitations in conducting studies with a live virus with pandemic potential in the interpandemic period 
are acknowledged. Also small size is not considered as a major issue, in view of the fact that adult data 
serve as proof of concept and are not intended for supporting an adult indication. Similarly, lack of 
P/LAIV paediatric data is acceptable in the context of this application for a pandemic preparedness 
vaccine in the interpandemic period, i.e. lack of immediate threat from avian influenza and lack of 
circulating virus with sustained human-to-human transmission may raise serious feasibility and ethical 
concerns for investigating a paediatric population. Indeed, based on adult data and extensive 
experience gained in paediatrics with seasonal and pandemic H1N1pdm09 LAIV vaccines, it can be 
reasonably assumed that P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 is able to prime the naïve paediatric population too. 
To further support the conclusions of this application, a safety and descriptive immunogenicity study in 
subjects 1 to 17 years of age will be conducted upon pandemic declaration. It is also required that 
surveillance studies for effectiveness and safety of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 vaccine will be conducted upon 
massive use during the pandemic. These studies are required as obligations to the terms of the 
marketing authorisation for this pandemic preparedness vaccine and are reflected in Annex II. 
Whether a single dose of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 vaccine suffices to prime naïve subjects remains to be 
fully elucidated. The potential advantage of 1-dose regime in a pandemic situation, with respect to 
schedule compliance and vaccination coverage, is acknowledged. However, seasonal LAIV efficacy data 
obtained from very young children showed that the second dose had additional clinical benefit. In the 
monkey challenge model, a single 2x106 TCID50 dose was ineffective, in contrast to complete 
protection offered by 2 doses of vaccine. In addition existing evidence in the prime-boost studies CIR 
277 (H5N1) and CIR 293 (H7N9) indicate the need for 2 doses to achieve better immune responses to 
booster. Collectively the gap of knowledge and the existing data hampers the possibility at present to 
recommend a 1-dose regime for P/LAIV H5N1 VN04. There is also lack of knowledge regarding the 
minimum time needed from immunisation until protective immune responses are elicited, although 
based on the evidence from study CIR 293 booster responses were detected as early as 4 weeks post 
priming. 
The supportive data from study CIR293 are still incomplete at the current time; the final results will be 
submitted as soon as available and are expected to provide significant information. 
The Applicant did not include stability data for the finished product using the H5N1 strain in this 
application. The claimed finished product shelf life of 20 weeks at -25°C ± 5°C (prior to distribution) 
and subsequent storage at 2°C - 8°C for not more than 18 weeks is based on the H1N1 pandemic 
formulation (2009). These data were also not generated with the requested and newly implemented

thermostability assay that allows detection of “thermolabile” HA molecules. The CHMP has thus 
requested the Applicant to generate and provide strain-specific stability data for the actual pandemic 
vaccine strain in order to define the shelf life on an evidence-based, strain-specific basis. This request 
is reflected in Annex II as obligation to the terms of the marketing authorisation. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In the adults P/LAIV studies headache was most frequently reported, followed by events of the upper 
respiratory tract including nasal congestion and rhinorrhoea. These adverse reactions were of mild to 
moderate intensity. 
Overall, based on the very limited number of adult subjects tested, the safety profile of P/LAIV H5N1 
VN04 and other P/LAIV candidates can be described as comparable to that of seasonal LAIVs. 
Seasonal LAIVs are proved to be safe and well tolerated across the paediatric population. From clinical 
studies and post-marketing surveillance with Fluenz and Fluenz Tetra in over 110,000 children and 
adolescents 2 to 17 years of age, the following adverse reactions are reported: Decreased appetite, 
Headache, Nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea and Malaise as very common, and Myalgia and Pyrexia as 
common. 
One of the main concerns for the seasonal LAIVs was the increased incidence or wheezing in younger 
children below the age of 2 years, and the increased risk of hospitalisation in children below the age of 
1 year (see the following sections for further details on this topic). These risks are not found in children 
from 2 years of age onward. 
The monovalent pandemic H1N1 LAIV was demonstrated to be safe in children and adults during the 
2009 pandemic. Extrapolation from data of the extensive safety database of seasonal LAIVs and the 
monovalent H1N1 P/LAIV to the monovalent H5N1 P/LAIV is justified.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety dataset from the P/LAIV programme in adults is very limited. 
The tolerability and safety of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 has not been assessed in paediatric subjects aged 1 
to 17 years. This will be subject to post-marketing evaluation once a pandemic is declared. Collecting 
safety data from this population, especially from 1-2 years of age, in the inter-pandemic period raise 
significant concerns and appears unfeasible and not ethically acceptable, due to the lack of risk of 
contracting the disease in the absence of pandemic virus circulation from human to human. 
The available data gained with seasonal T/LAIV showed increased risks of wheezing through Day 42 in 
subjects below 24 months of age, compared to inactivated trivalent vaccines. Whether or not such 
potential risks can be detected for the monovalent P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 too, it could only be 
appropriately addressed during use in a pandemic situation. 
It is required that surveillance studies for safety of the vaccine be conducted upon use during the next 
pandemic. This will be reflected as specific obligations to the terms of the marketing authorisation.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
A pandemic caused by H5N1 can result in high morbidity and mortality in the entire age range of the 
general population. Vaccination is a viable effective measure to prevent disease and disease spread. 
The most important benefit of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 is to provide protection against H5N1 in naïve 
paediatric subjects. Such protection is inferred by proving that the vaccine can prime, i.e. by looking at 
the immune memory response following a booster with an inactivated vaccine containing the same 
strain. In fact, when administered with 2 doses separated by 4-8 weeks, P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 can prime 
naïve young adults and elicit long-lasting memory immune responses that could be recalled by re-
exposure to H5N1 antigen. This has been evidenced by means of two different functional antibody 
assays, HAI and MN, against the wild-type H5N1 VN04 virus. 
Another notable aspect of antibody responses to re-vaccination is the broadly cross-neutralising 
activity against up to 4 different H5N1 clades.  
P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 priming capacity has been supported by data generated for other P/LAIV 
candidates, with a recall/boost antigen given between 24 and 3 months after priming. Preliminary 
results from a prime-boost study with H7N9 additionally showed that robust booster responses can be 
achieved as early as 4 weeks post priming. Data of from this study are of highly supportive value 
because of the relevance of prime-boost interval to re-exposure in a pandemic situation.  
These naïve adult data provide important proof-of concept for inferring the capacity of P/LAIV H5N1 
VN04 to prime subjects 1 to 17 years of age. 
The protective efficacy of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 in ferret and monkey challenge studies, the efficacy of 
the licensed seasonal LAIVs in very young children, and the effectiveness of H1N1pdm09 monovalent

LAIV vaccine, provide additional supportive evidence for the efficacy of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 in subjects 
aged 1-17 years. 
No paediatric safety data have been generated for P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 and other P/LAIV candidates. 
Based on a small number of naïve adults tested thus far, these candidate vaccines can be described as 
low reactogenic, with similar safety profiles to the seasonal LAIVs.  
Seasonal T/LAIV show increased risks of wheezing through Day 42 in subjects below 24 months of age. 
With a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus such as the H5N1 subtype, which might be associated 
with high rate of mortality in a naive population, a safety signal such as wheezing is considered 
acceptable compared to the potential benefit of an effective life-saving vaccine in young children.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Several lines of proof-of-concept have been provided in support of the predicted priming capacity and 
protective efficacy of the 2-dose regime of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 in subjects aged 1-17 years. These 
include non-clinical and clinical data generated with several other P/LAIV candidate containing 
pandemic virus strains such as H7N7 and H7N9.  
The limited adult data available from the entire P/LAIV programme show a well-tolerated and safe 
profile comparable to that of seasonal LAIVs. Although no major safety concern is raised at present, 
the potential risk of increased wheezing upon vaccination with P/LAIV H5N1 VN04, in the infants and 
toddlers aged 1-2 years, has been suggested by previous experience with seasonal T/LAIV. However, 
the predicted efficacy of P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 in 1-2 year of age children, together with the potential 
severity of a H5N1 pandemic that might be associated with high rate of mortality in a naive population, 
outweighs the potential risk of increased wheezing in this age group, therefore supporting the age 
indication with a lower age cut-off of 1 year. It will be imperative to monitor the safety of the vaccine 
after declaration of a pandemic as per defined specific obligations. 
Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance for P/LAIV H5N1 VN04 is positive for the prophylaxis of influenza in an 
officially declared pandemic situation in children and adolescents from 12 months to less than 18 
years.

1.  Introduction 
On 6 April 2020, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Vidaza, in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that AZA-AML-004 is a standalone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Azacitidine was supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder containing 100 mg of azacitidine and 100 mg of 
mannitol per vial. This is the same pharmaceutical formulation that is approved for adults in the EU for 
subcutaneous (SC) administration. 
An alternate administration route, IV administration, has been used in this study. Reconstitution for 
clinical IV administration is conducted at the hospital and is supported by a simplified Investigational 
Medicinal Product Dossier (IMPD, Version 2.0, dated May 2015) that includes relevant compatibility and 
in-use stability data. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study AZA-AML-004: a randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 2 study, with a safety 
run-in part to evaluate safety, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of azacitidine compared to no 
anticancer treatment in children and young adults with acute myeloid leukaemia in molecular relapse 
after first complete remission. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study AZA-AML-004 
First subject first visit: 12 Aug 2015 
Last subject last visit: 08 Oct 2019 
Date of report: 05 Mar 2020 
Methods 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the Safety Run-in Part was to establish a safe and tolerable dose of 
azacitidine to be used in the Randomized Part of the study. The secondary objective of the Safety Run-
in Part was to establish azacitidine plasma PK parameters in AML subjects at molecular relapse after 
CR1 and to assess efficacy.

The primary objective of the Randomized Part was to evaluate the effect of azacitidine treatment in 
AML paediatric subjects at molecular relapse after CR1 when compared to no treatment with regard to 
the progression-free rate at Day 84 (± 4 days) post randomization. The secondary objective of the 
Randomized Part was to evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of azacitidine treatment 
in AML subjects at molecular relapse after CR1. 
Study design 
Figure 1 Overall Study Design of Study AZA-AML-004 
Study population /Sample size 
During the Safety Run-in Part, 6 subjects were to be enrolled in the first cohort of 100 mg/m2 
azacitidine administered intravenously (IV) on Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle. If the 100 mg/m2 dose 
was considered unsafe or intolerable, 6 additional subjects were to be enrolled into a 75 mg/m2 cohort 
of azacitidine administered IV on Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle. Six further subjects were to be treated 
in the Safety Run-in Part at the highest tolerated dose to gain preliminary efficacy data before the 
Randomized Part opened to enrollment. 
The Randomized Part was to begin once the Safety Run-in Part was completed and preliminary efficacy 
established. Subjects who achieved a confirmed molecular CR1 at the start of last consolidation 
treatment, or within 1 month after completion of consolidation treatment, were to be enrolled into the 
Randomized Part of the study. The Randomized Part of the study was not conducted. The study was 
transitioned to a single-arm (N = 20) Phase 2 non-Celgene sponsored study. Therefore, this section 
only summarizes results for the Safety Run-in Part.  
Treatments 
Enrolled subjects were to be treated for up to 3 cycles with 100 mg/m2 azacitidine administered IV on 
Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle. During any cycle of treatment, subjects who discontinued treatment due

to intolerance of the 100 mg/m2 dose were to have the 28-day Safety Follow-up Visit and then were to 
enter the Long-term Follow-up Period. These subjects were to be followed by monitoring every 28 days 
from last dose for MRD level until Day 84 (± 4 days) post Cycle 1 Day 1.  
The rate of the following treatment-related DLTs as per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.03, occurring during Cycle 1 only were to be 
considered in determining the tolerability of the 100 mg/m2 dose of azacitidine: 
 Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity (excluding transient transaminase elevation) 
 Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity lasting more than 7 days despite optimal treatment with standard 
supportive measures 
 Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity requiring treatment delay > 21 days (disease-related Grade 3 or 4 
hematologic toxicity was not counted as a DLT) 
In general, if a maximum of 1 out of 6 evaluable subjects experienced a treatment-related DLT, as 
defined above, during Cycle 1, the 100 mg/m2 dose of azacitidine would have been considered safe for 
the Randomized Part of the study. If more than 1 out of the 6 evaluable subjects experienced a DLT 
during Cycle 1, 6 additional subjects were to be enrolled to test the 75 mg/m2 cohort. If a maximum of 
1 out of 6 evaluable subjects experienced a DLT as defined above at the 75 mg/m2 dose, during Cycle 
1, the 75 mg/m2 dose of azacitidine would have been considered safe for the Randomized Part of the 
study. If more than 1 of 6 evaluable subjects in the 75 mg/m2 cohort experienced a DLT during Cycle 
1, the Randomized Part of the study would not have been initiated 
Outcomes/endpoints

Statistical Methods 
Primary efficacy evaluation was not applicable for the Safety Run-in Part. All secondary efficacy 
evaluations were conducted using the ITT Population. Evaluations of the study endpoints were based 
on point estimates and the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) within treatment doses were to be 
provided. No formal statistical comparison was to be performed.

There was no formal sample size calculation in the Safety Run-in Part. A total of between 12 and 18 
subjects evaluable for determination of the dose for the Randomized Part were required in the Safety 
Run-in Part. An initial cohort of 6 subjects was to be enrolled and treated at 100 mg/m2 and if that 
dose was considered non-tolerable, a further 6 subjects were to be enrolled and treated at 75 mg/m2. 
Six further subjects were to be treated in the Safety Run-in Part at the highest tolerated dose to gain 
preliminary efficacy data before the Randomized Part opened for enrollment. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The Randomized Part of the study was not conducted. The study was transitioned to a single-arm (N = 
20) Phase 2 non-Celgene-sponsored study. Therefore, this CSR presents results for only the Safety 
Run-in Part. 
Per the protocol design, only the 100 mg/m2 dose was used in this study. No subjects were dosed at 
75 mg/m2. 
A total of 7 subjects were screened and no subjects failed screening. Thus, 7 subjects (100.0%) at 
molecular relapse after CR1 were enrolled in this study and all subjects received the IP. 
Table 1 Subject Disposition (Intention-to-Treat Population) 
A total of 6 subjects (85.7%) had at least one protocol deviation during the study. The most common 
protocol deviation categories were out of window visit or assessment (6 subjects [85.7%]) and 
procedures or assessments not done (6 subjects [85.7%]). The protocol deviations varied in nature 
and were not considered to have any clinically relevant impact on data integrity or subject safety.  
Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 2 for the ITT Population. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/583097/2020  
Page 8/26 
 
 
 
 
Table 2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics (Intention-to-treat Population) 
All 7 subjects (100.0%) received at least one prior medication. The most frequently used prior 
medications (in ≥ 2 subjects) were fentanyl (5 subjects [71.4%]), paracetamol and propofol (in 4 
subjects [57.1%] each), and remifentanil (2 subjects [28.6%]). No subjects underwent HSCT 
procedures prior to study enrollment. All subjects received prior systemic anticancer therapies 
(antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents). 
Efficacy results 
There were no primary efficacy endpoints defined for the Safety Run-in Part. The secondary efficacy 
endpoints were analysed based on the ITT Population. At the end of the Safety Run-in Period, the 
median follow-up time was 14.5 months (14.0 months to 36.0 months), with 5 subjects alive at the 
time of analysis. 
Molecular improvement was seen in 1 subject at Day 84. Three subjects experienced molecular 
stability on Day 84, and 1 subject had clinical relapse at Day 83. 
Four of 7 subjects with minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment at Day 84, had either molecular 
stabilization (n = 3) or better MRD levels (1 molecular improvement) and 1 subject with MRD 
assessment on Day 83 had clinical relapse. Overall, the MRD level peaked at Cycle 2 Day 1 in both 
bone marrow aspirate (BMA) as well as peripheral blood (PB) and then decreased to either baseline 
level or better. 
Six of 7 subjects (90% [95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4, 1.0]) treated with azacitidine underwent 
HSCT. One subject died after 2 cycles of treatment and did not undergo HSCT. At the end of the Safety 
Run-in Period, the median follow-up time was 14.5 months (14.0 months to 36.0 months), with 5 
subjects alive at the time of analysis.

The median leukaemia-free survival (LFS) (Intention-to-treat [ITT] Population) was not calculable, as 
more than 50% of subjects (n = 4) were leukaemia-free at the time of analysis and only 3 subjects 
either progressed (n = 2) or died (n = 1). The LFS rate was 60% (95% CI = 0.2 to 0.8) at 12 months. 
The median OS time was not calculable because more than 50% of subjects were censored at the time 
of analysis. Five subjects (71.4%) were censored, and 2 subjects (28.6%) died. The OS rate at 12 
months and 24 months was 70% (95% CI = 0.3, 0.9).

Subjects in Study AZA-AML-004 (Intention-to-treat Population) 
Pharmacokinetic Results 
Pharmacokinetic samples were collected from the first 6 subjects as per protocol on day 7 of the first 
treatment cycle. All had at least one measurable post-dose PK concentration and were therefore 
included in the PK Population. Mean azacitidine plasma concentration-time profiles were well 
characterized over the 6-hour post-dose sampling interval, with all concentrations below the limit of 
quantification by 6 hours post-dose. 
Table 4 and Figure 2 depicts the geometric mean plasma PK parameters following multiple doses of 
azacitidine 100 mg/m2 IV.

Figure 2. Mean (+/- SD) Azacitidine Blood Concentrations over Scheduled Time 
Study AZA-AML-004  
According to the Applicant, pharmacokinetic exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time 
curve from time zero to the last quantifiable time point [AUC0-t]) observed in children and young 
adults with AML at molecular relapse after CR1 that received 100 mg/m2 azacitidine are comparable to 
paediatric subjects included in Study AZA-JMML-001 (10 MDS and 18 JMML subjects) and PK data from 
6 adult subjects with MDS administered 75 mg/m2 azacitidine IV (Study AZA-2002-BA-002) (mean 
AUC0-t of 1116 ng*hr/ml, 882 ng*hr/ml and 1025 ng*hr/ml, respectively). In addition, azacitidine 
concentration-time profiles were consistent with previously observed adult and pediatric subjects 
(JMML and MDS) demonstrating rapid time to peak concentrations, rapid elimination, and high inter-
subject variability. 
Safety results 
For subjects in the study, median treatment duration was 12.00 weeks, with minimum and maximum 
durations of 8.0 and 13.9 weeks, respectively (Table 5). The median dose intensity of azacitidine was 
159.8 mg/m2/week (range: 142 to 166 mg/m2/week), with a median relative dose intensity of 91.3% 
(range: 81% to 95%). The majority of subjects (4 subjects [57.1%]) had a relative dose intensity that 
was ≥ 90% and < 100%.

Table 9 Treatment-related Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by System Organ 
Class and Preferred Term in Two or More Subjects (Safety Population) 
At least 1 Grade 3 or higher treatment-related TEAE was reported in 5 subjects (71.4%); these TEAEs 
included neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, pneumonia, alanine aminotransferase increased, 
and aspartate aminotransferase increased. Neutropenia (4 subjects [57.1%]) was the only Grade 3 or 
higher treatment-related TEAE reported in ≥ 2 subjects. Grade 3 or higher treatment-related febrile 
neutropenia, leukopenia, pneumonia, increased ALT, and increased AST were reported in 1 subject 
(14.3%) each.  
Deaths 
Two subjects (28.6%) died more than 28 days after the end of treatment. One subject died due to 
cardiac failure 30 days after the last dose of IP. This subject was an 8-year-old, with a medical history 
of congenital heart disease pulmonalis atresia (corrected with a fenestrated extracardial Fontan 
circulation) and surgery to insert cardiac pacemaker (pacemaker placement in June 2016) and received 
azacitidine treatment. Following administration of Cycle 2, the subject developed febrile neutropenia 
and pneumonia (treated with antibiotics) followed by Grade 4 hypotension, and heart failure due to 
deterioration of Fontan circulation. The subject died of heart failure on Study Day 64 (last dose of IP 
was on Study Day 35). One subject died due to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 267 days after 
the last dose of IP. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Three subjects (42.9%) experienced at least one serious TEAE. Febrile neutropenia was the only 
serious TEAE reported in 2 subjects.

Treatment-emergent Adverse Events of Special Interest 
All 7 subjects (100.0%) experienced at least one AESI. Serious AESIs and Grade 3 or higher AESIs 
were reported in 3 subjects (42.9%) and 6 subjects (85.7%), respectively. Treatment-related AESIs 
were reported in 5 subjects (71.4%); 4 subjects (57.1%) experienced at least 1 treatment-related 
Grade 3 or higher AESI and 1 subject (14.3%) experienced at least 1 treatment-related serious TEAE 
of special interest. No subjects experienced an AESI leading to IP discontinuation and no subjects 
experienced a post-HSCT AESI. 
The most common AESI categories were myelosuppression and myelosuppression-neutropenia, 
reported in 7 subjects (100.0%) each (Table 11). There were no reports of AESIs of cardiovascular 
events or second primary malignancies reported while subjects were receiving IP.

Laboratory Parameters 
The majority of subjects did experience shifts from baseline during treatment for haematology 
laboratory parameters. These shifts were seen for haemoglobin (anaemia), white blood cell count 
(WBC decreased), platelet count (platelet count decreased), absolute neutrophils (neutrophil count

Conclusion MAH 
No conclusions can be drawn with respect to the clinical activity of azacitidine in the paediatric AML 
population in Study AZA-AML-004 due to the small number of subjects. The study is continuing as a 
non-Celgene-sponsored study to explore the efficacy in molecular relapse AML. In Study AZA-AML-004, 
azacitidine administered at the regimen of 100 mg/m2, IV, QD on Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle was 
deemed to be the safe and tolerable dose in paediatric subjects with AML. The observed AEs were 
expected and consistent with the known safety profile for azacitidine. No new safety signals were 
observed. No subjects required dose modifications and no subjects experienced a treatment-emergent 
adverse event (TEAE) leading to azacitidine discontinuation or dose reduction. 
No conclusions can be drawn with respect to the clinical activity of azacitidine in the paediatric AML 
population in Study AZA-AML-004 due to the small number of subjects. Due to the limited data 
available, the MAH does not propose any update to the SmPC with results from this study.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH presents the results from 7 paediatric subjects with a documented molecular relapse treated 
in the Safety Run-In part of study AZA-AML-004. The Randomized Part of the study was not 
conducted. The study was transitioned to a single-arm (N = 20) Phase 2 non-Celgene-sponsored 
study. Therefore, this CSR presents results for only the Safety Run-in Part. 
A starting dose of 100 mg/m2 IV was tested, whereas the recommended dose in the SmPC for adults is 
75 mg/m2 SC, the applicant justified the different dose based on scientific publications and the PK and 
renal clearance which are higher in children than in adults. The alternate administration route, IV 
administration (also used in AZA-JMML-001), can be agreed.  
A total of 7 subjects, at molecular relapse after CR were enrolled. The majority of these subjects had 
favourable risk stratification with an AML diagnosis classification of inv(16), CBFb/MYH11 (4 subjects). 
The majority of subjects were male (5 subjects) and the median age was 6.7 years (range: 2 to 12 
years). All subjects received prior systemic anticancer therapies and no subjects underwent HSCT 
procedures prior to study enrolment. The primary objective for the Safety Run-in Part was establishing 
a safe and tolerable dose for the Randomized Part of the study, assessment of treatment-related dose-
limiting toxicities (DLTs) and determining the frequency and severity of treatment-related AEs. Thus no 
primary efficacy endpoints were defined. The secondary efficacy endpoints included molecular response 
at Day 84 or end of Cycle 3 (by MRD), MRD analysis, HSCT rate, LFS, OS and azacitidine plasma PK 
parameters. Therefore, and due to the lack of the randomized part of the study, the results presented 
here will only provide limited data on activity of azacitidine in children with AML.  
From the 7 enrolled subjects, 2 subjects discontinued treatment (1 due to death (cardiac failure 30 
days after the last dose) and the other due to clinical relapse).  At day 84, molecular improvement was 
seen in 1 subject, 3 subjects experienced molecular stability, and 1 subject had clinical relapse at Day 
83. The median leukaemia-free survival (LFS) was not calculable, 4 subjects were leukaemia-free at 
the time of analysis and 3 subjects either progressed (n = 2) or died (n = 1). At the end of the Safety 
Run-in Period, the median follow-up time was 14.5 months (14.0 months to 36.0 months), with 5 
subjects alive at the time of analysis. Six of 7 subjects (90% [95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4, 
1.0]) treated with azacitidine underwent HSCT. 
Pharmacokinetic samples were collected from the first 6 subjects as per protocol at day 7 of the first 
treatment cycle. According to the Applicant, pharmacokinetic exposure (area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable time point [AUC0-t]) observed in 
children and young adults with AML at molecular relapse after CR1 that received 100 mg/m2

azacitidine are comparable to paediatric subjects included in Study AZA-JMML-001 (10 MDS and 18 
JMML subjects) and PK data from 6 adult subjects with MDS administered 75 mg/m2 azacitidine IV 
(Study AZA2002-BA-002) (mean AUC0-t of 1116 ng*hr/ml, 882 ng*hr/ml and 1025 ng*hr/ml, 
respectively). A descriptive analysis showed that mean exposure to azacitidine (Cmax and AUC0-tlast) 
was similar between both paediatric studies and the adult subjects after IV administration. Similarly, 
dose-normalized exposure parameters (Cmax/Dose and AUC0-tlast/Dose) pooled across both 
paediatric studies were comparable to adult dose-normalized parameters.. Further, azacitidine PK data 
in paediatric patients have been described in SmPC section 5.2, but the final text is not agreed upon 
yet. 
With respect to the safety, all 7 subjects (100.0%) experienced at least one TEAE and at least one 
treatment-related TEAE during the study. Serious TEAEs and Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were reported in 
3 subjects (42.9%) and 7 subjects (100.0%). The most frequently reported TEAEs (in > 30% of 
subjects) were neutropenia (7 subjects [100.0%]), nausea (5 subjects [71.4%]), and leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, diarrhoea, and increased ALT (3 subjects [42.9%] each). Neutropenia (4 subjects 
[57.1%]) was the only Grade 3 or higher treatment-related TEAE reported in ≥ 2 subjects. Grade 3 or 
higher treatment-related febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, pneumonia, increased ALT, and increased 
AST were reported in 1 subject (14.3%) each. Haematology and serum chemistry parameters were 
consistent with the known pharmacology of azacitidine and generally worsened from baseline but did 
not lead to study discontinuation. One subject (14.3%) had IP interrupted due to febrile neutropenia 
and one subject (14.3%) had IP interrupted due to neutropenia.  
Thus, the safety profile in paediatric AML subjects seems consistent with the known safety profile of 
azacitidine, the most frequently reported TEAEs were primarily hematologic and gastrointestinal 
disorders. The sample size is too limited to determine whether the frequency of AEs is different from 
the known safety profile, but there does not seem to be major differences. No new safety signals were 
observed. 
The applicant proposes no changes in the SmPC based on the presented results due to the small 
number of subjects. Acknowledging the limited studied population, it is considered that the observed 
activity and safety of azacitidine, as well as azacitidine PK data in (paediatric) patients with AML is of 
interest to the physicians. This information is provided in the SmPC.   
3.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
A starting dose of 100 mg/m2 was tested, whereas the recommended dose in the SmPC for 
1. 
adults is 75 mg/m2.  In paediatric study AZA-JMML-001 (MDS and JMML) a dose of 75 mg/m2 was 
chosen. The reason to decide for a higher starting dose in the AML indication is not understood. The 
applicant should justify the differences in dosing strategy in AML, MDS and JMML. 
2. 
PK data from the IV route from all paediatric studies should be pooled together with PK data 
(IV and SC) from adults for an analysis, assessing if the drug exposures from IV administration in 
paediatrics are comparable with that from SC/IV administration in adults. Such analysis may be 
conducted using popPK methodology. 
3. 
The MAH is requested to provide a text proposal for the relevant sections of the SmPC (4.2 (no 
posology recommendation is needed) ,, 4.8., 5.1 and 5.2) describing the results of this study in a 
concise and informative manner as suggested in the FAQ on SmPC paediatrics information 
(EMA/551202/2010 Rev 1).

4. As the randomized part of study AZA-AML-004 has been transferred to a non-Celgene study, the 
applicant is requested to commit to make every effort to submit any available data from this study 
(safety part and randomized part) , even when no formal indication in children is sought by the

MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
CHMP QUESTION 1 
A starting dose of 100 mg/m2 was tested, whereas the recommended dose in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) for adults is 75 mg/m2. In paediatric study AZA-JMML-001 (myelodysplastic 
syndromes [MDS] and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia [JMML]) a dose of 75 mg/m2 was chosen. 
The reason to decide for a higher starting dose in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) indication is not 
understood. The applicant should justify the differences in dosing strategy in AML, MDS and JMML. 
MAH Response 
Azacitidine (Vidaza®) has been authorized for treatment in adult patients since 2008 at 75 mg/m2, 
with some use at 100 mg/m2 in adult AML patients (Khan 2012) and has been widely used in pediatric 
trials as summarized below. The use of azacitidine at a hypomethylating dose in JMML was reported in 
a few case studies. A 1.5-year old JMML patient with monosomy 7 was treated with azacitidine 100 
mg/m2 in 1-hour intravenous (IV) transfusions for 5 consecutive days of each 28-day cycle for 8 cycles 
(Furlan, 2009). This dose and regimen of azacitidine resulted in a complete cytogenetic response at the 
initiation of Cycle 6 and a reduction in methylation of the CALCA gene promoter. In pediatric trials, a 
number of studies specifically designed to evaluate the use of azacitidine to treat AML or acute 
lymphatic leukemia (ALL) have been published. Azacitidine doses ranging from 50 to 300 mg/m2/day 
have been used according to pediatric reports (Avramis, 1987; Avramis 1989; Baehner, 1979; 
Baehner, 1981; Baehner, 1984; Buckley, 1989; Chang, 2000;Dahl, 1990; Gaynon, 1983; Grier, 1992; 
Hakami, 1985; Hakami, 1987; Hrodek, 1971;Hurwitz,1992; Kalwinsky, 1986; Kalwinsky, 1988; Karon, 
1973; Look, 1981; Look, 1982;Ravindranath, 1987; Ravindranath, 1992; Ravindranath, 1993; 
Ravindranath, 1996;Ribeiro, 1996; Steele, 1988; Steuber, 1989; Steuber, 1991; Steuber, 1994; 
Steuber, 1996;Sun, 2018; Weinstein, 1983; Woods, 1990; Woods, 1996; Woods, 1996a). 
Safety data from these studies accounting for more than 2,200 pediatric patients has adequately 
characterized the safety of azacitidine alone and in combination with other agents in the pediatric 
population (Appendix 1, RSI doc MAH). In all these studies, azacitidine was administered as IV, most 
often in combination with other agents and there were no safety concerns reported at these doses. 
Because the doses of azacitidine used in the previous pediatric studies likely exceeded the 
hypomethylating exposure and because azacitidine was given concurrently with combination agents, 
single-agent azacitidine at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 was considered in the safety run-in part of the 
AZA-AML-004 study. 
In both pediatric studies (AZA-AML-004 and AZA-JMML-001) the aim was to use the hypomethylating 
dose (75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2) based on the published data. For MDS and JMML subjects (AZA-
JMML-001), Celgene used 75 mg/m2 taking into consideration known hematological toxicities of 
azacitidine, which usually occur during the early course of treatment, while aiming for patients to 
complete at least 3 cycles before bridging to transplant. For AML patients with molecular relapse after 
first complete remission (CR1) (AZA-AML-004), as the aim was to lower tumor burden as much as 
possible before transplant, 100 mg/m2 was selected as the dose to be tested first in the safety run-in 
part. If this higher dose was deemed not tolerable, then the study would have assessed the lower dose

of 75 mg/m2. Based on the above mentioned available literature from the 2,200 pediatric patients, the 
starting dose of 100 mg/m2 for study AZA-AML-004 was discussed with the Paediatric Committee 
(PDCO) and agreed as part of the Vidaza paediatric investigational plan (PIP) (EMEA-001272- PIP02-
13-M01, approved 21 Feb 2014). 
Assessors comment 
Issue has been clarified. No recommendation for posology is made due to the small sample size. 
Conclusion 
resolved 
CHMP QUESTION 2 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the IV route from all paediatric studies should be pooled together with 
PK data (IV and subcutaneous [SC]) from adults for an analysis, assessing if the drug exposures from 
IV administration in paediatrics are comparable with that from SC/IV administration in adults. Such 
analysis may be conducted using popPK methodology.  
MAH Response to CHMP Question 2 
Study AZA-2002-BA-002 was a randomized, open-label, two-period, crossover study to assess the 
bioavailability of SC and IV azacitidine administered at 75 mg/m2 in adult subjects with MDS. An 89% 
bioavailability of SC versus IV route was observed, therefore area under the plasma concentration time 
curve (AUC) is similar between IV and SC administration in adult subjects (refer to Table 1). 
Tabel 1 Summary of Arithmetic Mean (±Standard Deviation) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following SC 
and IV Dose Administration (N = 6) in Adults 
PK data from pediatric subjects included in Study AZA-AML-004 (6 subjects) treated via IV 
administration of azacitidine 100 mg/m2, Study AZA-JMML-001 (10 MDS and 18 JMML subjects) 
treated via IV administration of azacitidine 75 mg/m2 and the 6 adult subjects with MDS administered 
75 mg/m2 azacitidine IV in Study AZA-2002-BA-002 are presented in Table 2. In addition, to assess if 
azacitidine drug exposures from IV administration across pediatric studies are comparable to IV 
administration in adults, dose-normalized pediatric exposure parameters were pooled and compared to 
dose-normalized adult exposure parameters. Exposure of azacitidine (maximum observed plasma 
concentration [Cmax] and AUC from time zero to last time with detectable levels [AUC0-t]) was similar 
between both pediatric studies and the adult subjects after IV administration. Similarly, dose-
normalized exposure parameters (Cmax/Dose and AUC0-t/Dose) pooled across pediatric studies were 
comparable to adult dose-normalized parameters.

Table 2 Mean (Standard Deviation) of Azacitidine Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Pediatric and 
Adult Subjects after IV administration 
Assessors comment 
The Applicant did not pool the PK data from the IV route from all paediatric studies together with the 
PK data (IV and subcutaneous [SC]) from adults, either via additional grouping and descriptive 
statistics nor via popPK analysis. Only data from two paediatric studies were pooled. Instead, the 
Applicant displayed additional tables with descriptive statistics of the various paediatric and adult 
groups studied, to assess if the drug exposures from IV administration in paediatrics are comparable 
with that from SC/IV administration in adults.  
The tables above show that mean exposure to azacitidine (Cmax and AUC0-tlast) was similar between 
both pediatric studies and the adult subjects after IV administration. Similarly, dose-normalized 
exposure parameters (Cmax/Dose and AUC0-tlast/Dose) pooled across both paediatric studies were 
comparable to adult dose-normalized parameters. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved. 
CHMP QUESTION 3 
The MAH is requested to provide a text proposal for the relevant sections of the SmPC (4.2 [(no

Assessors comment 
Text proposals for section 4.2., 4.8 and 5.1 are agreed.  
The text proposal for Section 5.2 is for the most agreed, except that exposure to azacitidine after 
multiple dosing should be described by AUC0-tau instead of AUCo-∞.  
Furthermore the last sentence referring to two other studies is not clear, as those studies are not 
mentioned in the SmPC (i.e. in Section 5.1). 
The proposal should be adapted. 
For the last sentence the following wording is proposed: Pharmacokinetic (azacitidine) exposure in 
children with AML at molecular relapse after CR1 was comparable to exposure from pooled data of 10 
children with MDS and 18 children with JMML and also comparable to azacitidine exposure in adults 
with MDS. 
Furthermore, please write MDS and JMML full-out or explain abbreviations. 
Conclusion 
Issue partly agreed. The proposal for SmPC should be adapted according to the above 
advice, please refer to the SmPC with Rapporteur’s comments included.

MAH Response  
Celgene acknowledges the CHMP’s comment and would like to emphasize that data collection and 
analysis of the two study parts are performed by two different entities/sponsors. The results of the 
safety run-in part of AZA-AML-004 were presented as part of this submission. The MAH commits to 
make every effort to submit the clinical study report of the non-Celgene study (VZ-CL-AML-GPOH-
13094, EudraCT: 2017-003422-32), despite Celgene not being the sponsor of that clinical trial and 
having limited influence and rights over the resulting data. Hence, the submission of data from the 
non-Celgene study can only occur within one year after study completion, which is currently estimated 
for 2022. 
Assessors comment 
All efforts of the MAH to provide data from study AZA-AML-004 are welcomed.  
Conclusion 
Issue not further pursued 
4.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The benefit-risk balance for the studied populations cannot be determined due to the limited efficacy 
data presented. No new safety signals have been identified and the disease targeted is an approved 
indication of azacitidine. Therefore it is considered that the results of this study do not impact the 
benefit-risk of azacitidine in the already approved (adult) indications. 
Nevertheless, the safety data obtained in the current study are considered of interest to the physicians 
treating children with AML. Therefore the SmPC should be updated accordingly. A variation including 
the agreed changes (see Attachment 1) should be submitted within 60 days of the outcome of this P46 
procedure. 
The benefit-risk for the approved indications remains favourable.

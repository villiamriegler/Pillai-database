Part VI:  Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Ruconest (conestat alfa) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Ruconest. The RMP details important risks of 
Ruconest, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained about Ruconest's 
risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Ruconest's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information to 
healthcare professionals and patients on how Ruconest should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Ruconest should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European Public 
Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Ruconest's RMP. 
I.  
The medicine and what it is used for 
Ruconest is authorized for treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents with hereditary 
angioedema (HAE) (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains conestat alfa as the active substance and it 
is given by intravenous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Ruconest’s benefits can be found in Ruconest’s EPAR, including 
a plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage (see 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/ruconest). 
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or 
further characterize the risks  
Important risks of Ruconest, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed studies for 
learning more about Ruconest's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package leaflet and 
SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals. 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging. 
•  The authorized pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that the medicine is 
used correctly. 
•  The medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription). 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of Ruconest, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and regularly 
analyzed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Ruconest is not yet available, it is listed under 
 
  
 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Ruconest are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or 
minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be regarded 
as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the 
use of Ruconest. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further 
evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine). 
Following completion of Study C1 1209 in children, the text on pediatric patients, classified as missing 
information in the list of safety has been adapted.

II.B 
Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk – Allergic reactions in patients with rabbit allergy  
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
This important identified risk is based on data from the clinical 
development program of conestat alfa, literature on rabbit allergy, as well 
as post-marketing data.  
The only major risk identified during the clinical development of 
conestat alfa has been hypersensitivity to the product, and this is based on 
a single serious adverse event (SAE). A healthy volunteer treated in a 
Phase I study developed an IgE-mediated anaphylactic event within 
minutes of her first dose of conestat alfa 100 U/kg. Although this subject 
had denied allergy to rabbits at study entry, she later reported a history of 
allergic symptoms upon exposure to rabbits. During and following the 
event, blood samples for diagnostic immunology/allergy purposes were 
collected, and IgE measurements were strongly positive (3+ or 4+) for 
 
  
 
Important identified risk – Allergic reactions in patients with rabbit allergy  
rabbit antigens. Skin testing to the study drug was positive. 
Of note, no anaphylactic AEs were reported in any patient with HAE 
who participated in the completed clinical studies of the clinical 
development program (acute attack and prophylactic treatment studies). 
A retrospective immunogenicity analysis found that single and repeat 
exposure to conestat alfa did not induce detectable IgE antibody 
responses against rabbit or other animal allergens. In a prospective 
analysis in Study C1 1310, no patients developed IgE antibodies to rabbit 
dander following treatment with conestat alfa. 
Rabbit allergy is contraindicated for the use of Ruconest, as indicated in 
the SmPC and PL. Up to the DLP of 28 October 2018, an estimated 
1534 patients were exposed to Ruconest in all countries where Ruconest 
was approved, excluding the US. There have been no severe or serious 
allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylactic reaction/shock) in patients with 
rabbit allergy in these countries. In the US, up to the DLP of 28 October 
2018, 864 patients were exposed to Ruconest. There have been no severe 
or serious allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylactic reaction/shock) in patients 
with rabbit allergy in the US, despite the lack of any pre-exposure testing 
requirement in the US. 
Rabbit allergies are more prevalent in populations with occupational 
exposure (e.g. laboratory animal caretakers) or in households with pet 
rabbits.

Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Important identified risk – Off-label use 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
This important identified risk is based on post-marketing data and 
literature.  
Review of the available post-marketing reports showed that reported off-
label use included prophylactic use or use of Ruconest in a higher 
frequency than pro re nata (PRN; as needed) ranging from twice daily to 
every 2 weeks, off-label indications such as treatment of AAE, HAE type 
III, deficiencies of circulating enzymes/defects in the complement 
system, intramuscular administration, and use of frozen product etc. A 
frequency cannot be determined because it is difficult to calculate the 
patient exposure accurately. The reported (S)AEs associated with off-
label use did not constitute any new safety signal or concern.  
 
  
 
 
Important identified risk – Off-label use 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The patient group which is most likely to experience limited efficacy 
upon use of Ruconest would be patients with AAE. These patients have 
neutralizing antibodies against C1-INH that are likely to also neutralize 
the therapeutic effect of the recombinant human C1-INH in Ruconest. 
In addition, prophylactic use of Ruconest could result in breakthrough 
attacks. Breakthrough attacks can be treated using the approved products 
for treatment of HAE attacks.

Important identified risk – Lack of efficacy 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
This risk is based on data from clinical trials and post-marketing data on 
lack of efficacy.  
In the clinical trials, lack of efficacy was concluded if the 'time to 
beginning of relief' was longer than 4 hours.  
In the randomized controlled trials (Studies C1 1205 and C1 1304) 39/41 
(95%) of patients treated with Ruconest reached time to beginning of 
relief within 4 hours. In an open-label study (Study C1 1205 OLE) 
114/119 (95%) attacks treated with a single dose of 50 U/kg reached time 
to beginning of relief within 4 hours. In a subsequent randomized 
controlled trial (Study C1 1310 RCT), there were 35/44 (80%) of patients 
who achieved relief within 4 hours.  
In the open-label study (Study C1 1205 OLE), an additional dose of 
50 U/kg was administered for 13/133 (10%) attacks. In a subsequent 
open-label study (Study C1 1310 OLE), a second dose was administered 
for 9 of 224 (4%) attacks. 
Based on the small patient numbers in the presented studies, lack of 
efficacy was observed in 5-20% of treatments in these studies and need 
for a second dose is estimated at 4-10% of attacks. Review of the 
available post-marketing data showed that the occurrence of lack of 
efficacy was well within the range observed in the clinical studies. 
Although it is hard to distinguish between lack of drug effect and 
worsening of the disease, due to the known mortality in HAE and 
specifically the possibility of severe clinical consequences of an acute 
angioedema attack in the laryngeal region, lack of efficacy is classified as 
an important identified risk. 
 
  
 
 
Important identified risk – Lack of efficacy 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The risk of lack of efficacy is increased in certain off-label indications 
such as AAE.  
When the product is not administered by an HCP there is an increased 
risk of incorrect dose used or incorrect administration of Ruconest which 
might result in reduced efficacy of Ruconest.

Important potential risk – Allergic reaction due to the formation of IgE antibodies against rabbit 
allergens 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
This risk is based on literature on rabbit allergy, data from post-
marketing exposure and an IgE testing report. 
A post-hoc analysis of 137 subjects participating in the clinical trials 
revealed 2 subjects who had above threshold IgE antibodies against 
rabbit allergens post treatment. One of these subjects received saline 
in the randomized controlled phase of the study. Levels did not 
increase upon exposure to Ruconest in the open-label phase. The 
second subject had IgE antibodies against rabbit meat. Only for this 
patient the induction of IgE antibodies against this rabbit allergen 
cannot be excluded. However, the subject did not develop an allergic 
type response upon first or repeat exposure to Ruconest. It was 
concluded in the IgE testing report that single and repeat exposure to 
up to 100 U/ kg body weight conestat alfa did not induce detectable 
IgE antibody responses against rabbit or other animal allergens.

Important potential risk – Allergic reaction due to formation of other anti-Host Related Impurities 
(HRI) antibodies 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
This risk is based on the immunogenicity testing report. 
Antibodies against HRI were assessed in samples collected from 
205 HAE patients treated for 704 angioedema attacks participating in 
clinical Studies C1 1202 and C1 1203, and the randomized controlled 
(RCT) and open-label extension (OLE) parts of Studies C1 1304 and C1 
1310. Anti-HRI antibody results were confirmed by displacement assay 
for 27 of 205 patients treated with conestat alfa. Anti-HRI antibodies 
were not associated with clinical symptoms. There was no plausible 
temporal association between treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) or new acute HAE attacks and timing of any confirmed anti-
HRI antibody results. 
In Study C1 1106, 8 out of the 11 healthy volunteers receiving 5 repeat 
injections of 100 U/kg had positive samples in the screenings assay for 
anti-HRI. 
In the absence of clinical symptoms, a frequency cannot be determined. 
The background incidence or prevalence is unknown.

Important potential risk – Induction of acquired angioedema due to the formation of anti-C1-INH 
antibodies 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
This risk is based on the immunogenicity testing report. 
There is a theoretical risk that patients develop antibodies against 
conestat alfa affecting the efficacy of Ruconest, so called neutralizing 
antibodies. Pharming has evaluated the formation of antibodies against 
conestat alfa and plasma-derived C1-INH after single and repeat 
administrations, analyzed pharmacokinetics (PK) of C1-INH activity 
after repeat administrations of Ruconest, and analyzed clinical responses 
after repeat administration of Ruconest. 
In this evaluation, no neutralizing antibodies against conestat alfa and 
plasma-derived C1-INH have been found. Furthermore, no effect on 
pharmacokinetics has been observed nor is there any indication of 
reduced efficacy following repeat administrations of Ruconest. Thus, 
 
  
 
 
 
Important potential risk – Induction of acquired angioedema due to the formation of anti-C1-INH 
antibodies 
there is no indication that neutralizing antibodies are being formed 
following treatment with Ruconest. 
A frequency cannot be determined because no neutralizing antibodies 
have yet been discovered.

authorization development plan. 
Important potential risk – Thromboembolic complications 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
This risk is based on thrombogenicity position paper and data from post-
marketing exposure.  During off-label administration of very high doses 
of the plasma-derived C1-INH product Berinert (25 times higher than the 
recommended dose for an angioedema attack) in neonates who 
underwent cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation for major 
cardiovascular malformations, a concern about a possible risk for 
thromboembolic complications has arisen. Besides the surgical 
intervention, having a significant risk factor for thromboembolic 
complications, there is a theoretical concern of whether the 
thromboembolic complications observed in these cases are caused by 
C1-INH as C1-INH influences the fibrinolytic system. The position paper 
concluded that based on the observations on coagulation and fibrinolytic 
parameters in HAE patients treated with conestat alfa indicated no effect 
of conestat alfa on activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis in HAE 
patients at the doses administered. 
There has been one event of myocardial infarction in a 58-year-old 
patient participating in Study C1 1304. The event occurred more than 2 
months following a single administration of 100 U/kg conestat alfa and 
was unlikely related to administration of conestat alfa according to the 
Investigator. 
The thromboembolic events reported from post-marketing setting 
included Pulmonary thrombosis, Pulmonary embolism, Device occlusion, 
Thrombosis, Subclavian vein thrombosis, Jugular vein thrombosis, 
Transient ischaemic attack, and Cerebrovascular accident which were all 
assessed as serious. Outcome was not reported in majority of the cases. A 
causal relationship cannot be established based on available data. 
To further support the Sponsor’s position that the thromboembolic risk of 
Ruconest is negligible, a study was undertaken to assess the effects of 
 
  
 
 
Important potential risk – Thromboembolic complications 
Ruconest on activation of coagulation and of fibrinolysis in patients with 
HAE who participated in the randomized controlled phase of Study 
C1 1205 RCT and who received conestat alfa (50 or 100 U/kg of body 
weight) or saline for treatment of an acute attack. In the investigation 
Ruconest had no effect on coagulation and fibrinolysis parameters. 
A frequency cannot be determined. In one study with a plasma-derived 
C1-INH (Cinryze), with prophylactic use the incidence of such events 
was approximately 5%. 
Risk factors observed in patients who developed thrombotic and 
thromboembolic events following plasma-derived C1-INH treatment 
include the presence of an indwelling venous catheter/access device, 
prior history of thrombosis, underlying atherosclerosis, use of oral 
contraceptives or certain androgens, morbid obesity, and immobility.

Important potential risk – Medication error 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
This risk is based on post-marketing safety data. 
A frequency cannot be determined.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Evaluation of the post-marketing safety data on medication errors 
including with or without associated AEs did not identify patterns of 
medication errors and/or potential medication errors suggestive of any 
new safety concerns. 
Lack of experience of the patient or caregiver could increase the risk of 
medication errors. Patients with decreased venous access will be at 
increased risk of injection errors.

Important potential risk – Adverse event with self or home administration 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Most adverse event reports originate from the US. According to the US 
prescribing information, self-administration is allowed. Thus far, there 
are no data originating from the US suggesting an increased risk of 
adverse events with self-administration. Use of the self-administration 
within Europe is limited. 
The most serious adverse event with self-administration may be the 
potential of an air embolism when a large amount of bubbles or air is 
injected into the vein. Air bubbles may develop during reconstitution if 
the vial is agitated or shaken too vigorously. This is a theoretical risk 
since a small volume of bubbles or air is unlikely to constitute a safety 
risk (air embolism) upon intravenous administration. 
Review of the available post-marketing safety data showed that it was not 
always possible to identify whether Ruconest was given in a hospital or 
at home based on the available information. Besides, the reported serious 
events mainly concerned infusion site reaction such as application site 
acne/erythema, catheter site infection, and infusion site infection/pain. In 
most cases no outcome was reported. Overall, no air embolism has been 
reported.  
Lack of experience of the patient or caregiver could increase the risk of a 
medication error. Patients with decreased venous access will be at 
increased risk of injection site complication.

Purpose of the study: To observe adverse events and insufficient efficacy, and to assess the immunological 
profile following single and repeat treatment with Ruconest in patients diagnosed with HAE. 
Effectiveness evaluation of educational materials for Ruconest 
Purpose of the study: All healthcare professionals who are expected to prescribe Ruconest will be provided 
with an educational materials pack. Following 2 major revisions of the educational materials, Pharming 
Group N.V. was requested to study the effectiveness of these educational materials. The MAH will conduct a 
survey of prescribing physicians’ knowledge and understanding of specific risks associated with Ruconest, 
as described in the Product Information (PI), and communicated to the healthcare professionals via these 
educational materials. 
The main objectives of this study are: 
•  To evaluate the HCPs awareness of the need to take a careful history of rabbit allergy, the need for 
monitoring for hypersensitivity reactions and knowing what action to take as a measure of the 
effectiveness of the educational materials. 
•  To evaluate whether the patient and prescriber checklists, and patient diary have been useful in training 
patients to enable safe and effective use of Ruconest and whether key safety messages are understood by 
the prescriber and communicated to their patients as a measure of the effectiveness of the educational 
materials. 
A secondary study objective of this study is to evaluate whether the reporting rate of adverse events related 
to hypersensitivity reactions after administration of Ruconest has changed (based on data from routine 
pharmacovigilance reporting and the EU registry).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Large B-cell lymphomas (LBCLs) are a heterogeneous group of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas 
(NHLs) (Pinkerton et al, 2012; Swerdlow et al, 2016) characterised by the accumulation of malignant 
large B-cells in nodal and extranodal tissues. Different subtypes are characterised based on 
morphology, immunophenotypic features, and clinical presentation. 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
Breyanzi  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  (DLBCL), 
high grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and follicular 
lymphoma grade 3B (FL3B), who are refractory or have relapsed: 
•  within  12  months  of  initial  therapy  and  are  candidates  for  autologous  haematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplant (HSCT), or 
• after two or more lines of systemic therapy. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) can be classified based on cell of origin (B, T, or NK) and 
differentiation status (Swerdlow et al, 2016). In the EU, 80% to 90% of NHL cases are B-cell 
lymphomas (Pinkerton et al, 2012), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the single most 
common form of NHL, accounting for 30% to 40% of all NHL cases (NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines 
in Oncology for B-Cell Lymphomas V.3.2022).  
The incidence of DLBCL in Europe is approximately 4.92 cases per 100.000 persons per year (Sant M 
et al, 2010). A slight male predominance is observed, with approximately 55% of cases occurring in 
men. Incidence is known to increase with age, with a median age at presentation of approximately 65 
years (Morton LM et al, 2006). Although the vast majority of cases are sporadic, familial aggregation 
has been reported, with close relatives of probands being at higher risk (~3.5-fold) of developing 
DLBCL or other B-cell NHLs compared to the general population (Goldin LR et al, 2005). 
High-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) is a very aggressive form of large B-cell lymphoma that has 
been recently introduced in the 2016 revision of the WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms. Most 
HGBCL cases harbour the dual rearrangement of MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 genes, accounting for 5% 
to 7% of all DLBCLs (Riedell PA et al, 2018). 
Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is a rare form of large B-cell lymphoma (2.4% of 
all NHLs) characterised by female predominance, younger age at diagnosis (onset in the third to fourth 
decade), and primary mediastinal involvement (Nguyen LN et al, 2000). 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 12/186 
 
 
 
Follicular lymphoma grade 3B (FL3B) is a rarer subtype of follicular lymphoma (FL) that shares biologic 
similarities to DLBCL and, compared to low-grade FL, is characterised by an aggressive clinical 
behaviour. 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Environmental and genetic factors are known to contribute to the development of NHLs (Araujo LH et 
al, 2008) with higher incidence rates observed in subjects with chronic inflammatory diseases (e.g. 
Sjögren syndrome, celiac disease or rheumatoid arthritis) and congenital immunodeficiency disorders. 
In DLBCL, factors such as ultraviolet radiation, pesticides, and hair dye have also been potentially 
associated with higher risk. In addition, immunosuppression and infectious agents have also been 
related to the pathogenesis of DLBCL, especially HIV and EBV (Rodrigues Gouveia G et al, 2012). 
The pathogenesis of DLBCL is complex and consists of a multistep process resulting in the 
transformation and expansion of rapidly proliferating clonal B-cells of germinal or post-germinal origin. 
Most DLBCLs not of germinal centre origin are categorised as “activated B cell (ABC) type”, due to 
gene expression similarities to normal activated B cells. Although some steps in the pathway to 
malignant transformation have been characterised, most aspects remain unknown. Acquired genetic 
lesions (e.g., rearrangements of BCL6, BCL2, MYC and inactivation of p53) are commonly observed in 
DLBCL and may reflect the biological background of evolution from lower grade lymphomas or pre-
malignant clonal expansions (see e.g. Rao PH et al, Blood 1998, Pasqualucci L et al, Nat Genet 2011). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Patients with DLBCL usually present with rapidly enlarging masses, in most cases arising from lymph 
nodes in the neck, abdomen or mediastinum (the latter especially in PMBCL). Extranodal involvement 
is not uncommon, with the bone marrow involved in up to 30% of cases. Other sites that might be 
involved by extranodal disease include (but are not limited to) the gastrointestinal tract, the testis, 
bone, salivary glands, tonsil, skin, liver, breast, nasal cavity, ocular adnexa, paranasal sinuses, and 
central nervous system (CNS). Approximately 60 percent of patients present with advanced stage 
DLBCL. 
Local symptoms at presentation depend on the pattern of organ involvement, while systemic "B" 
symptoms (i.e., fever, weight loss, drenching night sweats) have been reported in approximately 30% 
percent of patients. 
Clinical guidelines (Tilly H et al, Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL): ESMO Clinical Practice 
Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, 2015 and NCCN Clinical practice guidelines for B-
Cell Lymphomas, v. 5.2022) recommend that the diagnosis of LBCLs should be based on surgical 
excision biopsy to allow for the assessment of nodal architecture and for phenotypic/molecular studies.  
The assessment of the presence of MYC rearrangements in combination with BCL2/BCL6 
rearrangements, and possibly other genetic abnormalities, is needed to exclude “double-hit” or “triple-
hit” HGL: rearrangements of MYC/BCL2/BCL6 should be investigated by interphase FISH techniques in 
all newly diagnosed and relapsed patients treated with curative intent. 
In the last years, genome/histology studies have supported the establishment of several pathologic 
entities under the umbrella term “DLBCL” that are sufficiently distinct to be considered as separate 
diagnostic (sub)types (Swerdlow et al, 2016), including: 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 13/186 
 
 
 
- 
T-cell/histiocyte rich large B cell lymphoma (1-3% of all DLBCLs), defined by the presence of 
fewer than 10% malignant large B-cells in the setting of polyclonal T cells with or without 
- 
- 
- 
histiocytes.  
Primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma 
Intravascular large B cell lymphoma 
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis, an EBV-related form of large B-cell lymphoma usually involving 
extranodal sites (e.g. the lung) and characterised by a scarce infiltrate of EBV-positive B-cells 
in the midst of reactive T-cells and macrophages that make up the majority of the tumour 
mass 
- 
EBV-positive DLBCL 
-  DLBCL associated with IRF4 rearrangements, a subtype that is predominantly seen in children 
and young adults and frequently involves the structures of the Waldeyer's ring and the 
gastrointestinal tract 
-  DLBCL associated with chronic inflammation 
The recommended workup for LBCLs at diagnosis and at the time of relapse includes complete blood 
cell count (CBC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and uric acid levels, a comprehensive metabolic panel, 
PET/CT scan +/- bone marrow biopsy for staging, echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) 
scan if anthracycline or anthracenedione-based regimens are planned, and lumbar puncture in subjects 
at higher risk of CNS involvement.  
Disease extension is usually assessed using the Ann-Arbor staging system as recently revised (Cheson 
BD et al, The Lugano classification. 2014), with stage I indicating that the disease is limited to one 
single node, group of adjacent nodes or extranodal site, and stage IV identifying extensive nodal and 
extranodal involvement.  
Outcome in LBCL is heterogeneous and several prognostic scoring systems have been developed. The 
most commonly used in clinical practice is the International Prognostic Index (IPI), which includes age, 
performance status, serum LDH, disease stage, and number of extranodal sites as prognostic 
variables. The IPI distinguishes two prognostic groups among patients treated with standard 
immunotherapy (although it defined four groups in the pre-rituximab era). An age-adjusted IPI was 
developed for patients aged ≤60 years. The revised IPI (R-IPI) uses the same risk factors and scoring 
system as the IPI, but patients are assigned to three risk groups. The NCCN-IPI also uses the same 
clinical variables, but age and LDH are considered as continuous variables, rather than dichotomous, 
and the location of extranodal disease is used rather than the number of extranodal sites. 
The cell of origin phenotype by gene expression profiling is also a major prognostic factor in DLBCL, 
with lymphomas arising from germinal centre faring significantly better than those with an activated B-
cell phenotype. Cell of origin can also be determined by IHC but published data on the prognostic 
effect of immunohistochemical techniques are contradictory, also because of reproducibility issues. 
Management 
The frontline treatment of advanced stage DLBCL is based on the combination of anthracycline-
including polychemotherapy regimens and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. R-CHOP (rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) for six to eight cycles is the recommended 
regimen for the initial treatment of DLBCL. In a higher risk population, R-CHP plus polatuzumab has 
been recently shown to yield higher PFS and EFS rates compared to R-CHOP, although no survival 
Assessment report

Page 14/186 
 
 
 
benefit could be demonstrated (Tilly H et al, 2022). The optimal frontline treatment of other forms of 
LBCL is currently unknown, and in most cases R-CHOP (or the dose-adjusted R-EPOCH variant) 
remains the regimen of choice. Involved field radiotherapy is sometimes used as consolidation in the 
case of residual masses. Approximately 60-80% of patients with DLBCL, PMBCL and FL3B (depending 
on age and other baseline risk factors) are expected to achieve long-term remission-cure with frontline 
immunochemotherapy. The outcome of HGBCL with standard immunochemotherapy is less favourable.  
Approximately 10-40% of DLBCL patients are refractory (i.e. not able to achieve at least a PR) to 
frontline immunochemotherapy or experience disease relapse after CR was documented by PET/CT. 
Most relapses occur in the first two years after completing treatment, but up to one-fifth occur more 
than five years after treatment (Wang Y et al, 2019).  
Salvage treatment with non-cross resistant chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem 
cell transplant (ASCT) has long been considered the standard of care in this setting and has been 
associated with long-term survival/cure in approximately half of patients with first relapsed DLBCL. 
Subjects with DLBCL were prevalent in all studies investigating the efficacy of 2nd line salvage 
immunochemotherapy strategies: the extent of the efficacy of salvage regimens in LGBL histologies 
other than DLBCL is, therefore, uncertain, yet in the absence of dedicated options, patients with other 
LBCL histologies are usually treated  according to the DLBCL salvage paradigm.  
The role of salvage chemotherapy, usually administered for 2-3 cycles, is to reduce the burden of 
disease and determine residual chemosensitivity. Only subjects who achieve CR/Deauville 4 PR 
according to PET/CT are eligible for ASCT, since patients with inadequate response to intensive salvage 
therapy (i.e. with secondary refractory disease) have been shown not to benefit from transplant 
consolidation. 
Several salvage immunochemotherapy regimens are currently available (e.g. R-DHAP [rituximab, 
dexamethasone, high dose cytarabine, cisplatin], R-ESHAP [rituximab, etoposide, methylprednisolone, 
cytarabine, cisplatin] R-GEMOX [rituximab, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin], R-ICE [rituximab, ifosfamide, 
carboplatin, etoposide], R-GDP [rituximab, gemcitabine, dexamethasone, cisplatin]) and none was 
demonstrated to be clearly superior to the others.  
Tafasitamab (an anti-CD19 antibody used in combination with lenalidomide) and polatuzumab vedotin 
(an anti-CD79b monoclonal antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E used in combination with 
bendamustine and rituximab) have received conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) in the EU for 
the treatment of patients with R/R DLBCL who are not eligible to ASCT, representing possible 
alternatives in the salvage setting.   
Duration of initial remission has been described as a significant prognostic factor in the salvage 
setting: in the PARMA and CORAL studies (Guglielmi et al, 1998 and Van Den Neste et al, 2016) 
subjects with refractory DLBCL or early relapse after frontline chemotherapy (e.g. <12 months) 
showed lower ORR (14-55%) and shorter OS (mOS 4.4 months) with salvage chemotherapy +/- ASCT. 
Overall, a medical need for new effective alternatives to the currently available salvage treatments can 
be recognized, with the aim to improve remission rates and long-term disease control/cure, especially 
for subjects with primary refractory or early relapsed disease.

and transduced with a replication incompetent lentiviral vector encoding an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen 
receptor (CAR).  
The CAR comprises an FMC63 monoclonal antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv), 
immunoglobulin G (IgG)4 hinge region, CD28 transmembrane domain, 4-1BB (CD137) costimulatory 
domain, and CD3 zeta activation domain. In addition, JCAR017 includes a non-functional truncated 
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFRt) that is co-expressed on the cell surface with the CD19-
specific CAR.  
A single dose of JCAR017 contains a target of 100 x 106 (range 44-120 × 106) CAR-positive viable T 
cells consisting of a defined composition of CD8+ and CD4+ cell components: 
• CD8+ cell component: Each vial contains 5.1-322 × 106 CAR-positive viable T cells in 4.6 mL (1.1-70 
× 106 CAR-positive viable T cells/mL). 
• CD4+ cell component: Each vial contains 5.1-322 × 106 CAR-positive viable T cells in 4.6 mL (1.1-70 
× 106 CAR-positive viable T cells/mL). 
More than one vial of each of the CD8+ cell component and CD4+ cell component may be needed to 
achieve the dose of JCAR017. 
Breyanzi is currently indicated in the EU for “the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and 
follicular lymphoma grade 3B (FL3B), after two or more lines of systemic therapy”. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CAT/CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH received Scientific advice from the CAT/CHMP on the design of the registrational Phase 3 
Study BCM-003 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/807614/2017). The CAT/CHMP considered the study design of 
BCM-003 overall acceptable, recommending that additional subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses 
for survival were conducted. Additional changes were subsequently introduced in the study protocol to 
address the requests received from a competent authority.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
This submission of a Type II Variation for extension of indication includes data from Study JCAR017 
BCM-003 (hereafter referred to as Study BCM-003). The MAH stated that all studies in the Breyanzi 
development program have been conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) as defined by the International Council on Harmonisation and were conducted to meet the 
ethical requirement of European Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
All clinical trial materials supporting the label expansion studies were manufactured per the approved 
manufacturing process (v4). No changes are being proposed to either the approved manufacturing 
process or to the finished product specification. Data provided in support of this application are 
outlined below.

While Study 017001 pertained to patients with relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) after 
two or more lines of systemic therapy, Study BCM-003 pertains to LBCL patients who have failed the 
first line of therapy the following studies are included in this section in support of Study BCM-003: 
-  Phenotypic  and  functional  Characterisation  of  CD8+  or  CD4+  finished  product  components 
manufactured in support of Study BCM-003, 
-  Exploratory  correlative  analysis  of  quality  attributes  associations  with  clinical  efficacy,  safety,  and 
pharmacokinetics in Study BCM-003. 
•  CD8+ and CD4+ cell component (2L LBCL) 
The CD8+ finished product component enriches for less differentiated T cells and reduces the presence 
of  terminally  differentiated  and  T  cell  populations.  On  the  other  hand,  the  CD4+  finished  product 
component memory composition is influenced by the selected material composition. 
Variance  Component  Analysis  Results  for  Finished  product  Components’  Attributes  demonstrates  that 
the phenotypic and functional variations in T cell states observed in finished product components are 
primarily driven by patient/donor heterogeneity. 
Exploratory correlative analyses were performed to identify the finished product quality attributes that 
demonstrate potential effects on or informative relationships to clinical safety, clinical efficacy, and/or 
pharmacokinetic outcomes. The correlative analyses examine quality attributes associated with product 
release specifications and Characterisation testing used to define the phenotypic and functional features 
associated with T cells in the finished product components. 
The analysis cohort used in the correlative analysis comprises the liso-cel Treated Analysis Set (Arm B) 
manufactured using the approved process (v4), which includes subjects with histology of diffuse large B 
cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (de novo or transformed from indolent lymphoma, high-grade B-
cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, T cell/histocyte-rich B cell lymphoma, and 
follicular lymphoma grade 3B failing one prior line of therapy. All included finished product lots conformed 
to product release specifications at the time of manufacture.  
Only Infused (Y), Conforming (Y) lots from the “Arm B Day 29” Cohort of Study BCM-003 were included 
in the Clinical-Endpoint × CMC Product Quality-Attribute correlative analyses reported herein (both CD8+ 
and  CD4+  finished  product  components  would  have  to  be  conforming).  For  phenotypic/functional 
Characterisations  and  inter-attribute  correlation  studies,  all  Conforming  (Y)  finished  product  lots,  and 
their  associated  selected  T  cell  materials  (where  applicable  depending  on  material  availability  for 
extended Characterisation testing) from all manufactured cohorts in Study BCM-003 were analysed.  
Statistical  assessments  of  correlative  relationships  between  finished  product  component  quality 
attributes  release  and  characterisation)  and  clinical  endpoints  utilised  Wilcoxon  rank-sum,  linear 
regression, and Cox-regression analyses to evaluate relationships with binary, continuous, and time-to-
event clinical endpoint measurements has been presented. The presence of correlative relationships or 
potential correlative relationships were determined based on nominal p-values and standardised effect 
sizes,  correlation  coefficients,  or  hazard  ratios,  depending  on  the  analyses  used.  Nominal  p-values 
describe  the  statistical  significance  of  correlative  relationships,  whereas  the  standardised  effect  sizes, 
correlation  coefficients,  and  hazard  ratios  describe  the  magnitude  and  directionality  of  correlative 
relationships. 
Wilcoxon  rank-sum  statistical  analyses  (non-parametric)  were  used  to  evaluate  the  significance  of 
correlations  between  continuous  quality  attributes  and  categorical  clinical  endpoints.  The  nominal  p-
values from the Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to sort the statistical significance of the association 
between  continuous  quality  attributes  and  categorical  clinical  endpoints.  The  standardised  effect  size 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 17/186 
 
 
 
(parametric) between two groups, calculated as the absolute value of the difference in sample means 
divided by the pooled standard deviation, was used to determine if the magnitude of an attribute shift is 
practically meaningful. 
Parametric  and  non-parametric  correlations  were  used  to  evaluate  the  strength  and  directionality  of 
relationships between continuous quality attributes and continuous clinical endpoints. Spearman rank-
order  correlation  coefficients  (ρ  [rho])  were  provided  to  inform  magnitude  and  directionality  of 
correlations  between  quality  attributes  and  clinical  endpoints.  The  nominal  p-values  from  regression 
analyses were used to evaluate whether the correlation coefficients were significantly different than zero. 
Natural  log-transformation  of  select  clinical  endpoints  was required  to  achieve  normal  distributions  of 
the  response  variables  and  improve  capacity  for  estimating  effect  sizes  for  potential  relationships 
between quality attributes and clinical endpoints. 
Cox-regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationships between continuous quality attribute 
variations and time-to-event clinical endpoints. Specifically, the Cox-regression coefficients (or hazard 
ratios,  HR)  informed  the  effect  of  quality  attribute  variations  (e.g.,  measured  in  units  of  standard 
deviation) on the hazard of an event (e.g., progression; death; failure to achieve a complete response 
(CR) or partial response (PR) by 9 weeks post randomization; or start of a new anti-neoplastic therapy 
due to efficacy concerns). 
HR = 1, increases in the quality attribute are not associated with hazard of an event occurrence. 
HR > 1, increases in the quality attribute are associated with increased hazard of an event occurrence. 
HR < 1, increases in the quality attribute are associated with decreased hazard of an event occurrence. 
Nominal  p-values  from  the  Cox-regression  analyses  were  used  to  evaluate  whether  the  HRs  are 
significantly different than 1 and to rank quality attributes correlations with time-to-event outcomes in 
order of statistical significance. 
Corrections for multiple comparisons were not included in univariate statistical analyses. Although the 
absence  of  adjustments  for  multiple  comparisons  increases  the  potential  for  type  I  error  in  the 
assessment (rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., no correlative relationship exists) for associations that 
are  null),  given  that  many  of  the  attribute  measurements  included  in  the  correlative  analysis  are 
biologically  and/or  technically  interrelated,  correcting  for  multiple  comparisons  would  increase  the 
potential  for  type  II  error  (accepting  the  null  hypothesis  for  associations  that  are  not  null)  during 
interpretation of the correlative outputs. 
P-values  were  used  as  tools  to  help  rank  attribute  correlations  with  clinical  efficacy,  safety,  and 
pharmacokinetics. Standardised effect size, correlation coefficients, or hazard ratios were then used to 
determine  the  presence  of  correlative  or  potential  correlative  relationships.  Finally,  interdisciplinary 
subject matter experts evaluated the practical significance of correlations and potential correlations using 
biological  first  principles  and  considering  the  range  of  quality  attribute  values  observed  as  well  as 
technical method capabilities. 
For  the  CD8+  finished  product  component,  a  summary  of  the Correlative  Analyses  of  Product  Quality 
Attributes  and  Clinical  Endpoints  has  been  provided.  It  is  shown  that  no  statistically  significant 
correlations between CD8+ finished product component quality attributes and clinical safety outcomes 
are  observed,  while  the  exploratory  finished  product  correlative  analysis  identifies  correlative 
relationships  between  some  CD8+  finished  product  component  quality  attributes  and  clinical  efficacy 
and/or PK outcomes in Study BCM-003.  
For both product components, a summary of the Correlative Analyses of Product Quality Attributes and 
Clinical Endpoints has been provided. It is shown that  several T cell attributes in the drug product exhibit 
Assessment report

statistically  significant  correlative  relationships  with  clinical  efficacy  or  pharmacokinetic  outcomes, 
respectively. 
Definitive conclusions could not be made regarding the biological impact of the observed variability in 
these  attributes.  Therefore,  no  definitive  correlations  are  inferred  from  these  analyses  for  the  ranges 
experienced  in  Study-BCM-003.  These  exploratory  analyses  are  post  hoc  and  hypothesis-generating, 
and signal detection methods may be confounded by multiplicity. 
One  such  T  cell  attribute  was  considered  for  further  correlation  analyses.  Taken  together,  the  MAH’s 
results suggest variance in this T cell attribute is likely due to patient-intrinsic factors.  
Exploratory multivariable analysis was performed to rule out potentially confounding factors like patient 
baseline characteristics. The following baseline factors were considered in multivariable analyses (in this 
context, “baseline” means randomization timepoint). 
Explored Potentially, Confounding Variable: 
•  Age (continuous variable) 
•  Sex (F vs M) 
•  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Score (0 vs 1) 
•  Disease status (Relapsed vs Refractory) 
•  Secondary Age-Adjusted International Prognostic Index (sAAIPI score; 0/1 vs. 2/3) 
• 
• 
Tumor Burden (Sum of Perpendicular Diameters, SPD, continuous variable) 
Lactate Dehydrogenase Serum Levels (LDH, continuous variable) 
Stepwise regression procedure was used for variable selection in the final model.  
Exploratory multivariate analyses adjusting for patient baseline characteristics (age, sex, ECOG, relapsed 
or refractory disease status, sAAIPI score, LDH, and SPD) confirm the univariate results and reveal a 
statistically significant relationship with PFS as well. 
Consistent  with  correlative  analysis  results,  equal-splitting,  quartile-based  analysis  demonstrates 
potential correlations between  the discussed T cell attribute and EFS and PFS. No significant differences 
in quartile correlations with duration of response (DOR) were observed. 
Notably, all analyses demonstrate that even the highest  levels of this T cell attribute improved benefit 
in  median  EFS  is  observed  in  the  liso-cel  arm  over  the  standard-of-care  arm  in  Study  BCM-003  (2.3 
months median EFS). 
The  significance  of  the  correlative  analysis  finding  and  how  it  informs  the  finished  product  integrated 
control strategy for second-line, transplant-eligible was discussed. 
3.2.P.2.3 Manufacturing Process Development (Process)  
•  CD8+ cell component/CD4+ cell component (2L LBCL)  
All information and data presented in for 3L LBCL, is applicable to 2L, except the following: 
• 
The  Healthy  Donor  Leukapheresis  Product  was  reassessed  for  2L  TI  to  confirm  that  process 
Characterisation results are still relevant to this patient population. 
2L Healthy Donor Leukapheresis Product Assessment 
An  assessment  was  performed  comparing  quality  attributes  of  the  finished  product  components 
manufactured  from  healthy  donor  leukapheresis  product  and  2L  patient  leukapheresis  product.  Each 
quality attribute was compared using a three-tiered analysis approach. 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 19/186 
 
 
 
Results indicate that the  finished product v4 manufacturing process produces similar finished product 
when using leukapheresis from patients or healthy donors as all attributes passed at least one of the 
three analyses. 
In  terms  of  visual  assessments  (tier  III),  the  side-by-side  plots  of  the  data  points  show  no  strong 
evidence that a biologically relevant difference exists, and the range of outcomes observed for patient 
leukapheresis  product  is  clearly  represented  by  the  range  of  outcomes  observed  with  healthy  donor 
leukapheresis product. 
Quantitative Threshold for Surrogate Attribute 
A  quantitative  threshold  was  established  to  objectively  identify  meaningful  effects  of  process 
characterisation parameters on the chosen surrogate attribute. Effect sizes across the evaluated range 
greater than the threshold were considered to have a large impact on this attribute. 
Process Characterisation Impact to Surrogate Attribute Results 
Process  characterisation  results  were  used  to  develop  statistical  process  models  of  the  surrogate 
attribute. Models were used to identify parameters with statistically significantly (p < 0.05) effects on 
the attribute of interest when varied across the evaluated ranges. 
Two parameters had a statistically significant impact on the surrogate attribute. 
However, both parameters were previously identified as CPPs. No new CPPs were identified based on the 
described analysis as other evaluated parameters did not have large, statistically significant effects on 
any of the studied T cell attributes. 
Process Validation Assessment for 2L  
The  process  validation  strategy  for  the  finished  product  is  based  on  a  lifecycle  approach.  There  is  no 
impact  to  the  validated  state  of  the  process  for  2L  as  there  are  no  changes  to  finished  product 
specification or process controls from the Original Application.  
 A Leukapheresis Product Variability Assessment was performed using PPQ data to quantify variability 
inherent in the finished product quality attributes relevant to the indication. This assessment supports 
the conclusions that the finished product manufacturing process and PPQ campaigns are well controlled 
for the studied T cell attributes. 
 Quality Attribute Criticality Assessment was performed to identify and categorise quality attributes of 
the finished product for the 2L TI patient population.  
A  T  cell  attribute  was  classified  as  a  CQA  in  the  2L  setting  due  to  correlations  with  clinical  efficacy 
outcomes. 
Manufacturing Process Development (Integrated Control Strategy)  
•  CD8+ cell component/CD4+ cell component (2L LBCL) 
As far as the Integrated Control Strategy (ICS) was concerned, the methodology described in the original 
Application was unchanged and was applied to Study BCM-003.  
A T cell attribute has been identified as a CQA of the finished product for 2L patients, in part based on 
the  strong  correlations  observed  this  attribute  in  one  of  the  two  cell  components  and  clinical  efficacy 
outcomes in 2L patients.  
The predominant contribution to variance in this attribute derives from inter-patient heterogeneity. The 
results  strongly  demonstrate  that  this  T  cell  attribute  is  an  intrinsic  feature  of  the  patients’  starting 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 20/186 
 
 
 
materials. The T-cell attribute is in a state of control and the process parameters adequately ensure that 
this attribute remains controlled throughout manufacturing. 
In accordance with the Integrated Control Strategy (ICS), to minimise residual risk characterisation data 
for this T cell attribute will be monitored to demonstrate this attribute remains controlled commercially, 
thus maintaining the major source of variance in this attribute as due to inter-patient heterogeneity as 
was observed clinically.  
Despite  the  observation  that  this  attribute  correlates  with  clinical  efficacy  in  2L  patients,  favourable 
outcomes in which improved benefit or at least statistically equivalent outcomes are still observed over 
the standard-of-care (SOC), even in patients with the highest levels of this T cell attribute as observed 
in Study BCM-003.   
Overall,  these  results  further  justify  the  control  strategy  that  would  not  exclude  patients  based  on 
attributes that reflect  patient-intrinsic factors and that are not targeted outcomes of any particular unit 
operation. 
Batch analyses  
CD8+ cell component/CD4+ cell component (2L LBCL) 
Information  on  lots  of  finished  product  (CD8+  components  and  CD4+  components)  that  were 
manufactured to support clinical trial BCM-003 has been provided. 
Lots were manufactured by the approved process v4. Lot information (lot number, date of manufacture 
and vector information) and results from release testing has been provided.  
The batch analysis data has been presented in a tabular format. 
Justification of specification  
CD8+ cell component/CD4+ cell component (2L LBCL) 
The approved commercial finished product manufacturing process and container closure are the same 
for all liso-cel finished product lots. 
The  acceptance  criteria  established  in  the  commercial  specification  of  the finished  product  considered 
data that were acquired from finished product component lots manufactured under GMP conditions using 
patient leukapheresis in the manufacturing process v4. 
The  acceptance  criteria  established  in  the  commercial  specification  is  based  on  statistical  analyses  of 
data  acquired  with  the  commercial  analytical  procedures  which  considered  the  full  range  of  quality 
attribute experience gained. The data were statistically analysed by two approaches. 
- 
the full range of quality attribute experience were determined with a consideration for the capability 
of the analytical procedure (i.e., measurement uncertainty). This is justified by the consistent safety 
and  efficacy  of  finished  product  across  the  range  of  quality  attribute  experience  gained  with  the 
commercial process at the commercial target dose and the contribution of interpatient heterogeneity.  
- 
tolerance intervals were calculated based on process capability after statistical outliers were removed 
from the dataset. 
Methodology 
The statistical analyses involved first determining the range of experience that has been observed for 
each  attribute  (i.e.,  min/max).  Next,  the  measurement  uncertainty  for  this  range  of  experience  was 
determined based on the validated performance of the analytical procedure (i.e., intermediate precision). 
Next, statistical outliers were removed and the most appropriate distribution fit for the observed data 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 21/186 
 
 
 
 
were  determined,  and  finally  parametric  tolerance  intervals  were  calculated  based  on  the  chosen 
statistical distribution model of the observed data. All calculations were performed using JMP 14 and 15 
from SAS Institute (JMP). 
In terms of results, the authorised release specification test panel remains completely unchanged, and 
therefore  no  further  consideration  from  the  Applicant’s  position  is  reported  in  this  section  in  terms  of 
justification of acceptance criteria. 
In  response  to  a  request  for  supplementary  information,  the  MAH  clarified  that  the  proposed  control 
strategy indeed include a limit for monitoring characterisation data of the new CQA. The proposed limit 
is based on manufacturing experience observed during clinical studies of large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) 
patients  including  Study  BCM-003  (second-line  transplant-intended,  2L)  and  Study  017001/BCM-001 
(third-line  or  more,  3L+).  An  additional  assessment  is  provided  from  3L+  LBCL  clinical  lots  and 
commercial  Breyanzi  lots  manufactured  over  the  span  of  12  months.  These  data  clearly  demonstrate 
that the new CQA is well-controlled in the commercial setting.  
In response to a second Request for Supplementary Information,  the MAH agreed to set a revised 
limit for monitoring the new CQA. The MAH committed to continuously monitor this limit until more and 
relevant experience is gained, after which an appropriate variation procedure may be initiated to 
request revision of this limit. 
2.2.1.  Discussion on quality aspects 
The MAH has conducted study BCM-003 to extend Breyanzi’s indication to the 2L setting. In support of 
this  study,  a  reduced  quality  data  package  was  submitted  to  account  for  potential  differences  in  the 
phenotypic or functional characteristics of the starting material/finished product and the clinical response 
to the finished product itself, in 2L patients as compared to 3L ones. The quality data submitted does 
not highlight any remarkable differences or give raise to any further considerations, as compared to the 
initial MA assessment performed for Breyanzi. Also, the approved manufacturing process (v4) remains 
unchanged (with a very low rate of OOS), no new CPPs were identified and even the approved release 
specification acceptance criteria are unaffected when re-evaluated across 3 clinical studies (i.e., study 
017001, BCM-001 and BCM-003) conducted in two Continents (US and EU) in two different indications 
(3L+ and 2L). 
One relevant exception observed only for one of the two cell components in the 2L setting (and not in 
the authorised 3L+ setting), is represented by a T cell attribute that emerged as a specific feature of the 
patients.  According  to  the  correlation  analyses  conducted,  this  T  cell  attribute  shows  negligible  inter-
quality attributes correlations. On the other hand, a correlation between this attribute and efficacy profile 
was highlighted with relevant efficacy clinical outcomes. Yet, across the entire clinical range of this T cell 
attribute including the worst-case scenario of highest quartile, there is no clear signal pointing towards 
significantly reduced efficacy of Breyanzi vs the comparator and Breyanzi is still favoured over the SOC 
treatment in the 2L setting as informed by the data submitted. Therefore, the MAH proposal to classify 
this T cell attribute as a new CQA due to its impact on the product’s efficacy profile, has been regarded 
as  appropriate  particularly  to  avoid  unnecessary  restrictions  to  the  treatment  with  Breyanzi  due  to 
intrinsic features of 2L patients.  
With the aim to gain further knowledge on this specific aspect of the 2L treatment with Breyanzi and the 
potential impact thereof, in the context of a post-approval recommendation (REC), the MAH agrees to 
monitor the T cell attribute for the 2L finished product batches.  
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 22/186 
 
 
 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the quality aspects 
In conclusion, the quality dossier submitted in support of Breyanzi’s 2L extension of indication does not 
give  raise  to  concern  and  may  be  deemed  as  approvable.  However,  the  MAH  is  recommended  to 
continuously monitor the aforementioned T cell attribute according to the agreed limit and to initiate an 
investigation and a risk assessment in case this limit is exceeded with the aim to document and assess 
the potential impact thereof. (REC). 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
With respect to the previous JCAR017 product assessment (see published EPAR), four additional 
reports in the Pharmacodynamic Drug Interations section have been presented, that relate to the 
evaluation of the enhanced activity of JCAR017 by the combination with agents currently under clinical 
development for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas.  
The relevance of these NC studies on the requested extension of indication for Breyanzi is limited. 
Therefore, no specific data are going to be discussed in this report. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The original ERA for Breyanzi (included in the MAA dossier) concluded that the risk to people and the 
environment from placing liso-cel on the market is negligible and the applicant indicate that this Type 
II extension of indication variation in 2L LBCL, to include 2L patients, does not change of the 
environmental risk of liso-cel. 
2.3.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, the additional NC reports submitted in support of Breyanzi’s 2L extension of indication 
does not give raise to concern but they are not considered relevant for this application.  
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new/extended indication does not lead to

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology profile of liso-cel in subjects with 2L LBCL has been characterized based on 
the  results  obtained    from  clinical  study  BCM-003,  a  global  randomized  multicenter  Phase  3  trial  to 
compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  JCAR017  to  standard  of  care  in  adult  subjects  with  high-risk, 
transplant-eligible relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (TRANSFORM). 
A  clinical  pharmacology  report  BMS-98638  for  study  BCM-003  was  submitted  in  the  context  of  this 
variation. The clinical pharmacology programme included:  
•  Characterisation  of  the  PK  profile  of  liso-cel  as  assessed  by  droplet  digital  polymerase  chain 
reaction (ddPCR) and by flow cytometry (liso-cel arm and SOC arm post-cross over). 
•  Evaluation  of  the  pharmacodynamic  markers  of  liso-cel,  including  B-cell  aplasia  and  soluble 
biomarkers such as chemokines and cytokines (liso-cel arm and SOC arm post-cross over).  
•  Evaluation of the immune responses directed against liso-cel (liso-cel arm and SOC arm post-
cross over). 
•  Evaluation of the relationship between PK endpoints as assessed by ddPCR and by flow cytometry 
with select efficacy and safety endpoints in subjects receiving liso-cel. 
•  Evaluation of the relationship between PK endpoints as assessed by ddPCR with select baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics in subjects receiving liso-cel. 
•  Evaluation of the relationship between pharmacodynamic biomarker endpoints with select safety 
endpoints in subjects receiving liso-cel. 
•  Evaluation of the relationship between immunogenicity endpoints and select efficacy, safety, and 
PK endpoints as assessed by ddPCR in subjects receiving liso-cel.

Methods 
The PK of liso-cel were determined using 2 validated methods: 
-  ddPCR  to  detect  the  liso-cel  transgene  in  blood  through  quantitation  of  the  target  viral  genomic 
sequence of gag, that codifies for lentivirus structural proteins and is found in all the lentiviral vectors.  
-  Flow  cytometry  to  enumerate  CAR+  T  cell  subsets  via  detection  of  the  EGFRt  (ie,  CD3+  EGFRt+, 
CD8+ EGFRt+, and CD4+ EGFRt+) in blood. Truncated EGFR (EGFRt) was co-expressed with the CAR 
and considered a surrogate marker of CAR expression.  
In Arm B, PK sampling for ddPCR was performed at Day 29 (pre-infusion), Day 32, 36, 39, 43, 50, 64, 
71, 85, 126, Month 6, 9, 12, 24, 36; for flow cytometry sampling was performed at Day 29 (pre-infusion), 
Day 32, 36, 43, 50, 64, 85. A similar sampling was performed in Arm A, including patients crossed-over 
to liso-cel. In Arm B, PK data was available for  87 out of 92 patients (ddPCR data) and 84 out of 92 
patients (flow cytometry data); In Arm A, PK data was available for 45 out of 50 patients (ddPCR data) 
and 44 out of 50 patients (flow cytometry data). 
For  pharmacodynamic  assessment,  CD19+  B  cells  in  peripheral  blood  were  enumerated  by  validated 
flow cytometry.  
Soluble  biomarkers  were  analyzed  using  multiplex  MSD  electrochemiluminiscence  (ECL)  validated 
immunoassays; serum Ig, CRP, and ferritin were measured at the central laboratory.  
Immunogenicity  was  assessed  by  measuring  ATA  in  serum  with  an  electrochemiluminescence 
immunoassay.

Pharmacokinetics assessment 
Assessments of liso-cel PK were determined by ddPCR to detect vector sequences and by flow cytometry 
(CD3+ EGFRt+, CD8+ EGFRt+, and CD4+ EGFRt+ T-cells) to enumerate and immunophenotype liso-cel 
cells. The flow cytometry was considered supportive.  Pharmacokinetics by flow cytometry was not done 
at Japanese sites. 
Noncompartmental PK parameters such as Cmax, Tmax and AUC(0-28) were calculated for subjects who 
had  PK  measurement  28  days  after  infusion  or  later.  Persistence  of  liso-cel  transgene  in  blood  was 
assessed by ddPCR and defined as a transgene count greater than or equal to the LOD of 40 copies/μg. 
For flow cytometry, persistence is defined as CD3+ EGFRt+ T cell count greater than or equal to the LOD 
of 0.1 cells/μL, with at least 25 events captured in the EGFRt flow cytometry detection gate. Persistence 
of CD4+ EGFRt+ and CD8+ EGFRt+ T cells at each available time point is similarly defined. For both 
assays, data obtained after the start of a new anti-cancer therapy are not included in the determination 
of persistence. All PK data, including persistence were summarized descriptively.  
The PK analysis set included all subjects who took conforming liso-cel study treatment who have both 
pre-infusion and at least one post-infusion PK measurement. One subject in the liso-cel arm and one 
subject from the SOC arm who crossed-over to receive liso-cel, received nonconforming product. 
The samples were collected (for PK, PD and immunogenicity) at the following time-points for arm B 
(note that Day 29 correspond to the infusion day):

Results 
The  PK  analyses  were  based  on  ddPCR.  PK  assessments  by  flow  cytometry  (CD3+  EGFRt+,  CD8+ 
EGFRt+, and CD4+ EGFRt+ T-cells) were considered supportive data that allow for the evaluation of PK 
parameters per drug product component. 
Following infusion, the liso-cel concentration in the peripheral blood detected by ddPCR (validation limit 
range of 8 copies/400ng to 720000 copies/400ng) in the liso-cel arm exhibited a rapid expansion followed 
by a monophasic decline up to 35 days after infusion (Figure 2). Nominal visits based on day of liso-cel 
infusion  were  used  for  the  summary  of  the  liso-cel  concentration  (eg,  Visit  JCAR017  Infusion  Day  1 
corresponds to Study Day 29).

There was no flow cytometry-based PK data on Visit Post JCAR017 Infusion Day 11 (corresponding to 
Study Day 39) in the liso-cel arm, when the peak was observed for ddPCR based PK and comparison of 
flow cytometry-based and ddPCR-based PK shodul be exercised with caution. 
Flow  cytometry-based  PK  assessment  showed  the  ability  of  both  CD4+  and  CD8+  drug  product 
components  to  expand  following  the  liso-cel  infusion.  Higher  expansion  of  CD8+  EGFRt+  T  cells  was 
observed compared with CD4+ EGFRt+ T cells in both treated subjects in the liso-cel arm and subjects 
from the SOC arm who crossed-over to receive liso-cel.

The PK parameters estimated by ddPCR were similar between subjects in Arm B and subjects from SOC 
arm  who  crossed  over  to  receive  liso-cel.  The  median  Tmax  occurred  10  days  after  infusion  in  both 
treated subjects. 
Table 9. Summary of Liso-cel Pharmacokinetic Parameters by ddPCR – ddPCR PK Analysis Set 
(Conforming Product) 
Median Cmax and AUC(0-28) of CD3+ EGFRt+ and CD8+ EGFRt+ T cells estimated by flow cytometry 
from treated subjects in the liso-cel arm were numerically lower than that for subjects from the SOC 
arm who crossed-over to receive liso-cel (Table 10). Median Tmax of CD3+ EGFRt+, CD4+ EGFRt+ and 
CD8+ EGFRt+ T cells from treated subjects in the liso-cel arm and that for subjects from the SOC arm 
who crossed-over to receive liso-cel were 14 days and 10 days, respectively. 
There was no flow cytometry-based PK data on Visit Post JCAR017 Infusion Day 11 (corresponding to 
Study Day 39) in the liso-cel arm, when the peak was observed for ddPCR-based PK. Comparison flow 
cytometry based and ddPCR based Parameters should be conducted with caution.

A high correlation between ddPCR (transgene) and flow cytometry (CD3+ EGFRt+ T cell) PK parameters 
was observed in the liso-cel arm for Cmax and AUC(0-28), with a correlation coefficient of 0.7583 (p 
<0.0001)  and 0.8300 (p <0.0001), respectively (Figures below).

Pharmacokinetic Parameters by Subgroup Analysis 
No apparent differences in ddPCR PK parameters by subgroups of age (< 65 versus ≥ 65 to < 75 years 
old), sex, region (Unites States, Europe versus Japan), and baseline SPD (≥ 50 versus < 50 cm2) were

observed in the liso-cel arm, except for Cmax and sex. A potential association was observed between 
higher  Cmax  and  female  sex  (17656.18  copies/μg  [IQR,  10783.0  to  74166.7]  in  male  subjects  and 
45492.20 copies/μg [IQR, 18490.4 to 104090.7] in female subjects, p = 0.0411), however, the IQRs 
overlapped. 
Persistence 
Persistence  of  liso-cel  transgene  in  blood  was  assessed  by  ddPCR  and  defined  as  a  transgene  count 
greater than or equal to the LOD of 40 copies/μg. Persistence of liso-cel transgene was observed up to 
Visit Post JCAR017 Infusion Month 11 in the liso-cel arm (Table 11). Liso-cel transgene was not detected 
in any subjects at Visit Post JCAR017 Infusion Month 17 in the liso-cel arm. However, the number of 
evaluable subjects was small (n = 6).

Similarly,  in  subjects  from  the  SOC  arm  who  crossed-over  to  receive  liso-cel,  persistence  of  liso-cel 
transgene was observed up to Month 12 (the end of the follow-up period in subjects from the SOC arm 
who crossed-over to receive liso-cel) (Table 12).

Results from analyses of persistence by flow cytometry has been provided for day 36 and Month 2 and 
are concordant with data showed for ddPCR.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic variables including B-cell aplasia, serum Ig, soluble biomarkers, CRP, and ferritin 
were summarized descriptively. 
B-cell aplasia 
B-cell aplasia (defined as CD19+ B-cells <3% of peripheral blood lymphocytes), is an on-target effect of 
anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  therapies,  that  may  be  seen  as  CAR  T  cells  persist  long  term,  functioning  as  a 
surrogate marker of CAR T-cell persistence and activity. 
The  incidence  of  B-cell  aplasia  was  assessed  for  both  the  liso-cel  arm  and  SOC  post-cross  over  arms 
(table below) and sampling was performed as reported in the table below. An increase in the proportion 
of subjects with B-cell aplasia was observed from 80.7% of subjects at screening to 95.9% of subjects 
at Day 29, which remained elevated through Day 85 (2 months post-infusion), in the liso-cel arm.  
Table 13. Incidence of B-cell Aplasia in Liso-cel Arm 
In Arm A (cross-over arm), B-cell aplasia was assessed pre-lymphodepletion [39 out of 47 (97.5%)] 
and post-infusion at Day 1 [37 out of 39 (94.9%)], Day 4 [30 out of 34 (88.2%)], Day 8 [41 out of 42 
(97.6%)], Day 11 [37 out of 39 (94.9%)], Day 15 [37 out of 38 (97.4%)], Day 22 [38 out 38 
(100%)], Day 29 [37 out of 38 (97.4%)], Month 2 [30 out of 30 (100%)].  
No difference in B-cell aplasia was observed between the liso-cel arm and SOC post-cross over arm. 
More mature data have been provided during the procedure on the percent of subjects with CD19+ B-
cell presence <3%, B-cell aplasia (BCA), based on the latest data (data cut-off date: 13-May-2022) for 
Study BCM-003. 
Updated data from this assay from the 13-May-2022 data cut-off date confirm the proportion of 
subjects with B-cell aplasia from 80.7% at screening to 95.9% at Day 29, and included an additional 
patient at Day 85 (2 months post-infusion).

To enable additional B-cell monitoring between Day 85 (when the PK collections end) through Month 
36, a TBNK (T cell, B cell, NK cell) flow cytometry panel was added after study start. Due to the 
initiation of this panel after study start and the need for additional subject consenting, a reduced 
number of subject samples were able to be assessed with this exploratory output. Subject CD19+ B-
cell <3% percentages from the TBNK assay are provided in Table below. BCA levels at screening are 
consistent across assays as is the increase in BCA through Day 85, where both assays demonstrated 
the on-target pharmacodynamic effect of liso-cel.

Day 29 is the infusion day of liso-cel. BCA is defined as <3% of CD19+ B-cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Data 
obtained after the start of a new anti-cancer therapy are not included in the determination of BCA 
Serum immunoglobulins 
Serum IgA, IgG, and IgM were measured by the central lab (Labcorp, Indianapolis). The level of IgG and 
incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia (defined as IgG < 500 mg/dL) for the liso-cel arm was summarized 
by scheduled visits in Table below. The percentage of subjects with hypogammaglobulinemia was 31.5% 
(28  of  89  subjects)  at  baseline  and  increased  numerically  at  Month  9  to  58.6%  (20  of  46  subjects), 
followed by a decrease to 50% (5 of 10 subjects) by Month 18. However, subject numbers decreased 
from Month 6 through Month 18. The analysis of serum IgG levels did not take into account potential 
confounding by the administration of IVIG for the treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia.

Soluble biomarkers 
A total of 37 soluble biomarkers were analyzed to examine changes in cytokine and chemokine levels 
following liso-cel infusion. The concentration of the biomarkers has been performed in compliance with 
GCLP using an electrochemiluminescence-based immunoassay (ECL) in human EDTA plasma in order to 
monitor the cytokine immune responses to JCAR17. 
C-reactive protein and ferritin 
Soluble analytes CRP and ferritin were measured by the central lab. In the liso-cel arm, median post-
infusion serum CRP was higher than median pre-infusion value (Day 29) up to Day 39 (10 days post 
infusion). However, median CRP decreased at Day 43 (14 days post infusion) and remained lower than 
the pre-infusion median from Day 43 through Day 126.

Median serum ferritin from Day 31 onward was lower than the pre-infusion serum ferritin. However, a 
wide range of ferritin levels were observed at each timepoint. 
Immunogenicity 
In the liso-cel arm, the prevalence and incidence of ATA was 1.1% (1 of 89 subjects) (Table below).

The  subject  who  had  a  pre-existing  ATA  in  the  liso-cel  arm  achieved  a  BOR  of  a  CR  and  did  not 
experience  any  CRS  or  iiNT.  Cmax  and  AUC(0-28)  estimated  by  ddPCR  of  this  subject  were  6983.2 
copies/μg and 45503.97 day*copies/μg, respectively, which were lower than the median values of overall 
population. 
The subject who had a treatment-induced ATA in the liso-cel arm achieved a BOR of a CR and did not 
experience any CRS or iiNT. Cmax and AUC(0-28) by ddPCR of this subject were 13872.86 copies/μg 
and  51639.09  day*copies/μg,  respectively,  which  were  lower  than  the  median  values  of  overall 
population. 
One subject in the liso-cel arm and one subject from the SOC arm who crossed-over to receive liso-cel 
received nonconforming product because the CD4+ component purity was OOS (out of specification). 
Expansion of liso-cel was observed in both subjects who received nonconforming product. No ATAs were 
detected in the subject who received nonconforming product in the liso-cel arm. The subject from the 
SOC arm who crossed-over to receive liso-cel and received nonconforming product had pre-existing ATA 
but no treatment-boosted ATA. 
Relationship between PK and efficacy/safety endpoints 
This relationship was evaluated for liso-cel arm only. The efficacy endpoints considered for the analysis 
are EFS, BOR, PFS, DoR. The safety endpoints are TEAE of CRS categorized as Grade 0 versus Grade 
≥1, CRS categorized as Grade ≤2 versus Grade ≥3, iiNT categorized as Grade 0 versus Grade ≥1 and 
iiNT categorized as Grade ≤2 versus Grade ≥3. The TEAE were assessed by the investigators. 
The relationship between PK parameters (Cmax, Tmax, and AUC(0-28)) and dichotomous parameters 
such as BOR, CRS, and iiNT were assessed by Wilcoxon tests.  The relationship between PK parameters 
and multi-categorical parameters were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis tests. The relationship between PK 
parameters and time-to-event parameters such as EFS, DoR and PFS were assessed by univariable Cox 
proportional  hazards  models.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  all  p-values  are  reported  as  2-sided  without 
multiplicity adjustment.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology profile of liso-cel in subjects with 2L LBCL has been characterized based on 
the results from clinical study BCM-003 and included a characterization of the PK profile of liso-cel by 
ddPCR and by flow cytometry, evaluation of the PD markers of liso-cel and immune responses directed 
against liso-cel. It is also evaluated the relationship between PK endpoints as assessed by ddPCR and 
by flow cytometry with selected efficacy and safety endpoints in subjects receiving liso-cel, relationship 
between PK endpoints with selected baseline demographic and disease characteristics in subjects 
receiving liso-cel, relationship between PD biomarker endpoints with select safety endpoints in subjects 
receiving liso-cel and relationship between immunogenicity endpoints and select efficacy and safety. 
The PK of liso-cel were determined using 2 validated methods:  
• 
• 
the ddPCR to detect the liso-cel transgene in blood and  
flow cytometry to enumerate CAR+ T cell subsets via detection of the EGFRt (ie, CD3+ EGFRt+, 
CD8+ EGFRt+, and CD4+ EGFRt+) in blood (. The flow cytometry was considered supportive.  
Moreover,  soluble  biomarkers  were  analyzed  using  multiplex  MSD  electrochemiluminescence  (ECL) 
immunoassays; serum Ig, CRP, and ferritin were measured at the central laboratory.  
Finally,  immunogenicity  was  assessed  by  measuring  ATA  in  serum  with  an  electrochemiluminescence 
immunoassay (a partial validation was submitted in the current variation). 
The MAH submitted the analytical report of ddPCR for samples relative to the study JCAR017-BCM-003 
and values fall within the validated ranges. It is observed that the maximum expression of the virus is 
within the first 2 weeks and few samples showed persistence of the virus until Month 11.  
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 43/186 
 
 
 
 
Data from ddPCR showed that a higher expansion of cells occurred at Day 39 corresponding to 10 days 
post-infusion, that is in line with data previously observed in the initial MA. The median liso-cel transgene 
level versus time profiles for the SOC Arm post-cross over were similar to those observed for the liso-
cel arm B, however, as already observed in the IMA, there is a high variability in the absolute count of 
cells, due to the nature of product. For flow cytometry (intended as supportive analysis) no sampling 
was  performed  at  Day  11  post-infusion,  precluding  the  availability  of  data  on  CD3+  EGFRt+,  CD4+ 
EGFRt+ and  CD8+ EGFRt+ T cells at  Tmax and the possibility  to compare  data from ddPCR and flow 
cytometry at that time point. Based on data provided, in Arm A (crossed-over pts) a higher expansion 
of  cells  seems  to  be  observed  respect  to  Arm  B,  however  also  the  variability  is  higher  precluding  a 
punctual comparison of such data. 
Persistence  of  liso-cel  transgene  in  blood  was  assessed  by  ddPCR  and  defined  as  a  transgene  count 
greater than or equal to the LOD of 40 copies/μg. Data on persistence are available until Month 11 in 
Arm B; however, it is of note that on Month 11 data for only 17 patients are available and the transgene 
persistence was observed in 6 out of 17 (35.3%). Moreover, in SOC Arm, persistence was observed only 
in 2 out of 4 patients (50%) at Month 12. Updated data on persistence until Month 23 in Arm B and until 
Month 12 in the SOC Arm have been provided during the procedure. The updated data on persistence 
showed  that  at  Month  11,  19  out  of  44  patients  had  transgene  persistence  (43.2%),  on  Month  17 
transgene persistence was observed in 11 out of 34 (32.4%) and on Month 23 was observed in 5 out of 
15 (33.3%). The percentage of transgene persistence ranged from 91% at day 36 to 33.3% at Month 
23. The updated data on persistence for Arm A, showed that the percentage of transgene persistence 
ranged from 91.3% at Day 29 to 55.6% at Month 12 (18 patients are now available at this timepoint).  
The updated data showed that the transgene persistence is maintained over time in both Arm. 
A qualitative electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method was employed to evaluate the presence of anti-
JCAR017 antibodies (anti-treatment antibodies; ATA) in human serum samples. Since it was observed 
that the assay signal had decreased over time a partial method validation was performed to re-establish 
the assay system suitability ranges, sensitivity, precision and the LPC (5 ng/ml instead of previously 15 
ng/ml). After the partial validation the value of LPC was 2.686 ng/mL for the Screening Assay (previously 
was  3.480  ng/ml)  and  to  2.715  ng/mL  for  the  confirmatory  Assay  (previously  was  3.247  ng/ml).  
Precision  was  between  0%  to  12%  CV  in  the  Screening  and  Confirmatory  assays  for  the  HPC  (7500 
ng/mL), LPC2 (50 ng/mL), and LPC (15 ng/mL). After the partial validation, precision was CV% = 19% 
(HPC 7500 ng/mL) and CV% = 13% (LPC 5 ng/mL). 
The number of samples for immunogenicity assessment, as per cut-off date 08 Mar 2021, was 714 that 
were  stored  frozen  at  -80°C  for  a  maximum  of  663  days  which  was  within  the  established  long-term 
stability of 3 years, 1 month, 7 days. The LTS previously established was 608 days at -80°C, however, 
literature data supports a storage period until 3.5 years at -80°C for the immunotherapeutic antibodies 
in human serum (Michaut, 2014). Therefore, the little exceeding time of sample storage is not considered 
an issue. 
Updated  data  in  responses  to  first  RSI  were  provided  on  ATA  prevalence  and  incidence  and  the  MAH 
clarifies the number of ATA previously and actually reported in terms of prevalence and incidence. In the 
liso-cel arm (Arm B) of Study BCM-003, 2 of 89 subjects who received conforming product had detectable 
ATAs. Of which one had pre-existing ATA and one had treatment induced ATA. In the SOC arm (Arm A), 
6 of 90 subjects (6.7%) had pre-existing ATA. In subjects from the SOC arm who crossed over to receive 
liso
cel or nonconforming product (47 subjects), 2 of these (4.3%) had pre-existing ATA and none had 
detectable  treatment-boosted  ATA.  One  subject  with  positive  ATA  (4011005)  was  excluded  from  the 
‑
summaries due to screen failure. Data provided confirmed a low incidence of ATAs. 
Pharmacodynamic variables including B-cell aplasia, serum Ig, soluble biomarkers, CRP, and ferritin were 
summarized descriptively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023

B-cell aplasia (defined as CD19+ B-cells <3% of peripheral blood lymphocytes), is an on-target effect of 
anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  therapies,  that  may  be  seen  as  CAR  T  cells  persist  long  term,  functioning  as  a 
surrogate marker of CAR T-cell persistence and activity. At the updated data cut-off 13-May-2022, just 
one additional patient was included at the timepoint Day 85. The percentage of B-cell aplasia remains 
the same (96.7%). The BCA was measured as part of the PK flow cytometry assay, which was assessed 
through study Day 85. Moreover, to enable additional B-cell monitoring between Day 85 (when the PK 
collections end) through Month 36, a TBNK (T cell, B cell, NK cell) flow cytometry panel was added after 
study start and the results at the additional timepoints (Day 126, Month 6, 12, 18 and 24) were provided. 
The percentage of B-cell aplasia are consistent between the two assays at screening and at Day 85; this 
percentage remains elevated at the subsequent timepoints, with a decrease at Month 12, 18, 24 (55.9%, 
44.4% and 37.5, respectively). Data on B-cell aplasia are in line with the observed persistence in which 
the transgene expression is observed until Month 23 in liso cell Arm. 
Serum IgA, IgG, and IgM were measured by the central lab (Labcorp, Indianapolis). The percentage of 
subjects  with  hypogammaglobulinemia  was  31.5%  (28  of  89  subjects)  at  baseline  and  increased 
numerically at Month 9 to 58.6% (20 of 46 subjects), followed by a decrease to 50% (5 of 10 subjects) 
by Month 18. However, subject numbers decreased from Month 6 through Month 18. 
Concentration of 39 soluble biomarkers has been analyzed and data showed that many analytes did not 
meet the acceptance criteria, their use in the present study is considered appropriated based on the “fit-
for-purpose” concept as stated by FDA and EMA Guidelines (Bioanalytical Method Validation 05/24/18, 
FDA; EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**). According to these recommendations “the level 
of validation should be appropriate for the intended purpose of the study” and “method for determining 
quantitative concentrations of biomarkers used in assessing pharmacodynamic endpoints are out of the 
scope of this guidance”. As requested, the MAH provides the method and absolute values for IL-6 and 
IFN-γ  measured  in  patients.  The  two  analytes  were  measured  in  the  context  of  the  analysis  of  38 
biomarkers with the MESO scale discovery panels. All accepted values are within the chosen criteria and 
are considered valid.  
A total of 37 soluble biomarkers were analyzed to examine changes in cytokine and chemokine levels 
following liso-cel infusion. Data on soluble biomarkers collected at Day 32, 36, 43 and 64 shows a rapid 
and transient increase in some of them). The eventual increase of biomarkers occurs essentially within 
Day 36 after the infusion (Day 29). 
Soluble analytes CRP and ferritin were measured by the central lab. As expected also the behavior of IL-
6, CRP and ferritin is aligned with the shape observed for liso-cel expansion. 
The  relationship  between  PK  and  efficacy/safety  endpoints  was  evaluated  for  liso-cel  arm  only.  No 
apparent  relationships  were  observed  between  transgene  PK  parameters  and  any  efficacy  endpoints 
(BOR, EFS, PFS and DoR). 
A potential association was observed between higher transgene Cmax or AUC(0-28) and higher incidence 
of any grade CRS. Although potential association was not observed for these PK parameters of CD4+ 
EGFRt+ and CD8+ EGFRt+ T cells, the median Cmax and AUC(0-28) were numerically higher in subjects 
with  any  grade  CRS.  The  relationship  between  PK  parameters  and  grade  ≥  3  CRS  was  not  assessed 
because the number of subjects with grade ≥ 3 CRS (n = 1) was less than 5. 
A potential association was observed between higher transgene AUC(0-28) and higher incidence of any 
grade  iiNT.  For  CD4+  EGFRt+  T  cells,  a  potential  association  was  observed  between  higher  Cmax  or 
AUC(0-28) and higher incidence of any grade iiNT. A potential association was not observed for CD8+ 
EGFRt+ T cells. The relationship between PK parameters and grade ≥ 3 iiNT was not assessed because 
the number of subjects with grade ≥ 3 iiNT (n = 4) was less than 5.

The  relationships  of  baseline  and  peak  values  (i.e  Cmax)  of  soluble  biomarkers  and  CRP/ferritin  with 
selective safety endpoints was studied. The safety endpoints include CRS, categorized as no CRS versus 
any grade CRS and iiNT, categorized as no iiNT versus any grade iiNT. 
The number of subjects with Grade ≥ 3 CRS (N=1) and Grade ≥ 3 iiNT (N=4) analyzed in the liso-cel arm 
was insufficient to assess a relationship. 
Among the evaluated soluble biomarkers, only Cmax of IFNγ and IL-6 were associated with any grade 
CRS versus no CRS. Additionally, peak IFNγ was also associated with any grade iiNT versus no iiNT. 
There was no statistically significant association of peak CRP or ferritin levels with CRS or NT status. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology of liso-cel in 2L LBCL has been well characterized.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The dose range seen in study BCM-003 falls within the existing approved range of 44-120 × 106 CAR+ 
T cells. Overall, the median total liso-cel dose was 99.92 × 106 CAR+ cells (range: 97.1 to 102.5); the 
median CD8 and CD4 component doses were 49.97 × 106 CAR+ cells (range: 48.0 to 51.8) and 49.89 
× 106 cells (range: 48.1 to 51.5), respectively. The CD4:CD8 ratio was tightly controlled around the 
target 1:1. This dose of liso-cel demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in EFS based on 
Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment compared to the SOC arm in study BCM-003: 
HR=0.349 (95% CI: 0.229, 0.530); p value based on a stratified Cox-PH model <0.0001. 
The overall safety profile of a liso-cel target dose of 100 × 106 CAR+ T cells was consistent with that 
previously observed in the marketed indication of 3L+ LBCL. 
Results from the PK/PD analyses in Study BCM-003 demonstrated that the benefit-risk profile is not 
expected to be impacted by liso-cel exposure at the proposed target dose, and the PK outcomes for 
subjects in 2L LBCL were similar to those for subjects with 3L+ LBCL.

Title of Study 
Study Jcar017-Bcm-003 - A Global Randomized Multicenter Phase 3 Trial to Compare the Efficacy and 
Safety of JCAR017 to Standard of Care in Adult Subjects With High-Risk, Transplant-Eligible Relapsed 
or Refractory Aggressive B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (TRANSFORM) 
Methods 
Study BCM-003 was a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multi-centre, Phase 3 study to 
demonstrate the efficacy and safety of liso-cel versus standard of care (SOC, i.e. salvage 
immunochemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy [HDCT] and autologous hematopoietic 
stem cell transplant [ASCT or HSCT]) in subjects with large B-cell lymphomas (LBCLs) who were 
refractory to or have relapsed within 12 months from 1L therapy and are eligible for HDCT and ASCT.

Treatments 
Arm A 
Subjects randomized to “Arm A” were administered one of the following three SOC regimens, as per 
the investigator’s decision: 
1. R-DHAP: Rituximab 375 mg/m² on Day 1, dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1 to 4, cytarabine 2 x 
2000 mg/m² on Day 2, and cisplatin 100 mg/m² on Day 1; 
2. R-ICE: Rituximab 375 mg/m² on Day 1, ifosfamide 5000 mg/m² on Day 2, etoposide 100 mg/m² on 
Days 1 to 3, carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 5 (maximum dose 800 mg) on Day 2; or 
3. R-GDP: Rituximab 375 mg/m² on Day 1, dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1 to 4, gemcitabine 1000 
mg/m² on Days 1 and 8, cisplatin 75 mg/m² on Day 1. 
Treatment compliance was adequate: R-ICE was the most used combination in the SOC arm (63.7%), 
followed by R-GDP (26.4%) and R-DHAP (16.5%). Only 12 patients had to switch salvage regimen 
because of efficacy (42%) or toxicity (33%) concerns. 
All subjects randomized to Arm A received 3 cycles of SOC salvage therapy, during which peripheral 
blood hematopoietic stem cells for HSCT were harvested. After 3 cycles, response was evaluated by 
PET-CT. Subjects responding to SOC (CR and PR) were to proceed to HDCT and HSCT. In case of 
toxicity or not satisfactory response as per investigator judgment to the selected SOC regimen, a 
switch within the 3 defined SOC regimen was allowed. 
The standard HDCT used in this study prior to the HSCT was BEAM, defined as carmustine (BCNU) 300 
mg/m² on Day 1, etoposide 200 mg/m² on Days 2 to 5, cytarabine 200 mg/m² on Days 2 to 5, 
melphalan 140 mg/m² on Day 6. 
Dose adjustment for toxicities and premedication were done as per site standard, local label, and 
investigator’s decision. In Japan, due to unavailability of intravenous BCNU, ranimustine (MCNU) was 
used at the same dosage and schedule as BCNU. 
Arm B 
Bridging chemotherapy administered prior to liso-cel 
Bridging chemotherapy with one of the protocol-defined SOC regimens (i.e., rituximab, 
dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin [R-DHAP], rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide 
[R-ICE], or rituximab, gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin [R-GDP]) (or local radiation on a 
single site)  was allowed for disease control while liso-cel was being manufactured (i.e., after 
leukapheresis and prior to LDC) if deemed necessary by the Investigator. Bridging therapy must have 
been stopped at least 7 days prior to LDC. Local radiation to a single lesion or subset of lesions was 
allowed as bridging therapy if other non-irradiated PET-positive lesions were present and if completed 
at least 7 days prior to the start of LDC. Subjects who received bridging treatments were re-evaluated 
with PET/TC before liso-cel infusion to disentangle the effect of bridging chemotherapy and liso-cel in 
response induction. 
Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy (LDC) 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 49/186 
 
 
 
 
Subjects randomized to Arm B were treated with LDC consisting of fludarabine IV (30 mg/m2/day for 3 
days) and cyclophosphamide IV (300 mg/m2/day for 3 days) prior to liso-cel infusion. LDC was to start 
5 to 7 days before liso-cel infusion and was to be completed at least 2 days before liso-cel infusion.  
Liso-cel infusion 
Prior to the administration of liso-cel subjects were assessed to confirm that they met the criteria for 
liso-cel administration.  
Eligible subjects were premedicated with 500 to 650 mg paracetamol PO and 25 to 50 mg 
diphenhydramine hydrochloride or another H1 antihistamine (PO or IV) 30 to 60 minutes prior to liso-
cel infusion. Steroids at therapeutic doses (> 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) and other 
immunosuppressive therapies were not allowed. Higher doses of steroids were only allowed for the 
treatment of CRS and NT or other life-threatening situations. 
Liso-cel was infused at a dose of 100 × 106 CAR+ viable T cells (CAR+ T cells) on Day 29 (2 to 7 days 
after completion of LDC) for subjects randomized in Arm B. The CD8 and CD4 components were 
thawed and administered separately with the CD8 component administered first, followed by the CD4 
component. 
Cross-over to liso-cel 
If requested by the investigator, subjects randomized to Arm A were allowed to crossover to receive 
liso-cel upon central confirmation of one of the following criteria:  
• 
• 
failure to achieve CR or PR by 9 weeks post-randomization (after 3 cycles of SOC);  
progression at any time;   
•  need to start a new antineoplastic therapy due to efficacy concerns after 18 weeks post-
randomization.  
For subjects from Arm A who crossed over to liso-cel, bridging with non-investigational therapy was 
allowed. 
Intrathecal treatment 
Intrathecal treatment (IT) with methotrexate and/or cytarabine was allowed in both treatment arms 
for  the prophylaxis and treatment of subjects with secondary CNS involvement (a minimum of 7 days 
wash-out period prior to the start of LC chemotherapy was required in Arm B).

The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is EFS, defined as the time from randomization to death 
from any cause, progressive disease (PD), failure to achieve complete response (CR) or partial 
response (PR) by 9 weeks post-randomization, or start of new antineoplastic therapy due to efficacy 
concerns, whichever occurs first. Failure to achieve CR or PR was evaluated after 3 cycles of SOC for 
Arm A (expected 9 weeks post-randomization) and 5 weeks after the liso-cel infusion for Arm B. 
The censoring rules for the primary EFS analysis are summarised in Table below. Event and censoring 
rules were consistent between the two treatment arms. 
Table 26. Event and Censoring Rules for EFS 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 51/186 
 
 
 
In addition to the event and censoring rules described in Table above, the following conditions were 
taken into account: allo-HSCT was considered as a new antineoplastic therapy for efficacy concerns; 
ASCT was considered as a new antineoplastic therapy for efficacy concerns when initiated for lack of 
efficacy (i.e., disease response pre-transplant of SD or PD) in Arm B; ASCT initiated after JCAR017 
infusion for consolidation (i.e., disease response pre-transplant other than SD or PD) was considered 
as a new antineoplastic therapy for reasons other than efficacy concerns; for Arm A, in case of toxicity 
or not satisfactory response as per investigator judgment to the selected SOC regimen, a switch within 
the 3 defined SOC regimen was allowed and not considered as a new antineoplastic therapy; Radiation 
therapy was considered as a new antineoplastic therapy for efficacy concerns when not planned in the 
treatment strategy. 
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints are CRR, PFS and OS. Full description of these endpoints is

Efficacy assessments 
Efficacy was assessed according to the Lugano criteria (Cheson, 2014) by an IRC based on 
radiographic tumor evaluation by PET/ CT scans. Disease was assessed using diagnostic quality CT/ 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (chest, neck, abdomen, and pelvis) and PET scans. 
Assessment of bone marrow involvement by lymphoma was performed by PET scan only; bone marrow 
aspirates and biopsies were not required for assessment of disease response. 
Efficacy assessments were performed at Weeks 9 (after 3 cycles of SOC for Arm A and 5 weeks after 
liso-cel infusion for Arm B) and 18 (8 weeks after the start of HDCT for Arm A and 14 weeks after liso-
cel infusion for Arm B) and Months 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 36. 
The Investigator’s assessment of response was collected in the eCRF. The IRC confirmed the response 
to therapy and the time of PD for each subject. If a subject demonstrated early tumour progression 
(defined as occurring prior to 3 months after liso-cel infusion), the investigator was responsible for 
evaluating whether the subject was experiencing a possible pseudoprogression (ie, tumour flare, which 
is a local inflammatory reaction indicating early tumour response at sites of disease such as lymph 
nodes) (Cheson, 2016). 
Start of a new antineoplastic therapy due to efficacy concerns was based on investigator’s assessment 
and related data was collected in the eCRF. Start of a new antineoplastic therapy was captured from 
time of randomization to date of imaging (or other objective finding) that served as the basis of 
starting a new antineoplastic therapy. A pseudo-progression at Week 9 post-randomization was not 
considered as failure to achieve CR or PR for EFS. 
HR-QoL evaluations were performed at randomisation and then at day 29, at week 9 and 18, and then 
at month 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 36 (or at EOS or ET visit). 
Sample size 
It was hypothesized that subjects treated with SOC had median EFS of 3 months. Subjects receiving 
experimental treatment JCAR017 were expected to have an increase of ~ 81% in the median EFS 
(equivalent to a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.55 under the exponential distribution assumption) compared to 
subjects treated with SOC, bringing the median EFS in the experimental group to 5.455 months.  
Given these assumptions, using a log rank test with 2.5% one-sided significance level, 119 EFS events 
were expected to provide at least 90% power to reject the null hypothesis of HR greater than or equal 
to 1. The null hypothesis was to be rejected if the p-value associated to the test is ≤ 0.004 at the time 
of the interim analysis for efficacy (i.e., when 71 EFS events were expected, see the Statistical method 
session below) or ≤ 0.024 at the time of the primary efficacy analysis (i.e., when 119 EFS events were 
expected). The significance thresholds were adjusted based on the actual number of EFS events

observed at the time of each efficacy analysis in order to ensure the nominal significance level was 
maintained. 
Based on an expected randomization rate up to 12 subjects per month (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 subjects 
randomized during 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th month and 12 subjects per month after 6th month) with a 
20% dropout rate before week 9 response assessment and a yearly dropout rate of 10% (30% 
cumulative), a sample size of 182 subjects was expected to be randomized and 215 subjects to be 
screened (assuming a screen failure rate of 15%). The estimated accrual duration was 17.6 months. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized at a 1:1 ratio via an IRT system into 1 of the 2 arms (Arm A[SOC] or Arm B 
[liso-cel]). Randomization was based on a permuted-blocks randomization method, with the following 
stratification factors: best overall response (BOR) to first-line therapy (refractory vs. relapsed); sAAIPI 
(0 or 1 vs. 2 or 3). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. The Applicant was blinded to the aggregated data in each arm. The IRC, 
which was responsible to review data related to disease response assessments during the study and 
determine remission and relapse for the interim and primary analyses, was also blinded to the 
treatment arm assigned to the subjects, even in case of expedited reviews for subjects in Arm A 
crossing over to liso-cel. 
Statistical methods 
Data safety monitoring board (DSMB) and independent review committee (IRC) 
An independent DSMB was assembled under a dedicated charter specifically developed for safety 
oversight of this study. The DSMB reviewed cumulative study data over the course of the study to 
evaluate safety, protocol conduct, and scientific validity and integrity of the trial. The DSMB was to 
meet approximately every 6 months throughout the trial and as needed to address any safety issues 
that may have risen. 
An IRC was established to review data related to disease response assessments during the study and 
determine remission and relapse for the interim analyses as well as the primary analysis. Subject 
management was based upon local investigator assessments. For subjects in Arm A who were eligible 
for crossover to receive liso-cel, confirmation of crossover criteria was to be approved by the IRC 
under expedited review. 
Analysis sets 
The following analysis sets were used for the analysis and presentation of the data: 
Intention-to-treat (ITT) Analysis Set: all subjects randomized to a treatment arm.  
Per-protocol (PP) Analysis Set: all subjects of the ITT analysis set characterized by: having a minimal 
exposure to treatment (Arm A: one cycle of SOC; Arm B: per protocol dose of conforming JCAR017); 
having a baseline assessment and at least one post-baseline response assessment; without important 
protocol deviations. 
Cross over Analysis Set: all subjects of the ITT analysis set randomized in Arm A who crossed over to 
JCAR017. 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 55/186 
 
 
 
Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Analysis Set: the HR-QoL analysis set was defined as subjects in 
the ITT population who filled in a baseline and at least one post-baseline HRQoL assessment.  
Interim analyses (IAs) 
Two IAs, one for futility and one for efficacy, were planned.  
The purpose of the first IA was to stop for futility in case of no efficacy signal on CRR at 9 weeks after 
randomization when ~30 evaluable subjects had their response assessment (after 3 cycles of SOC for 
Arm A and 5 weeks after the JCAR017 infusion) or have been confirmed with PD prior to this timepoint. 
The study was to be terminated if the CRR in JCAR017 arm had been lower than the CRR in the SOC 
arm. No formal statistical test was performed, and no type I error adjustment was implemented. This 
futility IA was performed based on a data cut-off date of 26 Nov 2019: the DSMB recommended that 
the study should be continued with no modifications. 
The purpose of the second IA was to demonstrate the superiority of liso-cel vs. SOC based on EFS. 
This analysis was based on the data cutoff date of 10 Nov 2020, at 63% information fraction (i.e. 75 
EFS events). The O’Brien-Fleming boundary was used to define the efficacy boundary and the null 
hypothesis could be rejected if the p-value was ≤0.005: the recommendation from the DSMB was that 
the pre-defined criteria for superiority of the liso-cel arm versus the SOC arm were met.  
Following consultation a competent authority indicated that the IA at 63% of the information fraction 
was not mature enough for a regulatory filing. The competent authority recommended that another 
efficacy IA be performed at 80% information fraction (i.e., at approximately 96 EFS events) and the 
SAP was revised accordingly. The purpose of this additional efficacy IA was to demonstrate superiority 
of liso-cel vs. SOC on EFS. The O’Brien-Fleming boundary was used to define the efficacy boundary 
and incorporated an alpha penalty for the previous interim analysis. The alpha spending function 
ensured that the overall type I error rate for the study was 2.5%: the null hypothesis was to be 
rejected if the p-value was ≤0.012 based on the actual number of EFS events observed at the time of 
this analysis (cut-off date of 08 Mar 2021, at 82% information fraction and 98 EFS events). In order to 
prevent bias in the study conduct, an independent and external statistical group was responsible for 
conducting the efficacy IA at 80% information fraction. The DSMB reviewed the results of this 
additional IA on 03 Jun 2021, and their recommendation was that the pre-defined criteria for 
superiority of the liso-cel arm vs. the SOC arm had been met and that the results could be disclosed.  
Control of multiplicity 
A hierarchical testing strategy was used to control the family-wise type I error rate across the primary 
and key secondary endpoints. The primary efficacy endpoint EFS was analysed first: if null hypothesis 
for EFS could be rejected, then hypothesis testing on CRR and subsequently on PFS and OS was to be 
performed hierarchically. No further testing was allowed once the testing sequence broke. O’Brien-
Fleming boundary alpha spending function was used to adjust for multiplicity for the IAs for efficacy 
and the primary analysis, to ensure that the overall type I error rate for the study was 2.5%. 
Statistical Analysis 
Time-to-event endpoints were analysed using a stratified Cox-PH model with treatment as the only 
covariate for analysis, if the proportional hazards assumption held. The proportional hazards 
assumption was evaluated via inspection of Schoenfeld residuals (Grambsch, 1994). The Kaplan-Meier 
(KM) product limit were used to provide summary information on EFS. The 25th percentile, median, 
and 75th percentile along with CI were extracted from KM curves (using log-log transformation). In 
addition, the EFS rate at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months were computed, along with the standard errors and 
associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals (Greenwood’s formula). 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 56/186 
 
 
 
For response analyses, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with stratification factors as strata was 
used for analysis and calculation of p-values. 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint included: unstratified Cox-PH model; restricted mean 
survival approach or piecewise stratified Cox-PH model in case the proportional hazard assumption was 
violated; PP and safety analysis sets; Investigator response assessment; censoring at the last 
adequate efficacy assessment before missing 2 or more consecutive scheduled assessments before or 
on study month 12 or before missing 1 or more consecutive scheduled assessments after study month 
12; censoring at the time of starting a (planned or unplanned) radiation therapy; using the “FDA 
imaging interpretation (i.e. also categorizing the below 3 scenarios as PD regardless of PET-based 
metabolic response at that time point: metabolic CR/PR/SD on PET and disease progression on CT 
scan, new lesion on CT scan indicating PD which was not FDG avid on PET and clinical (non-
radiographic) PD per Investigator). 
For OS, as subjects from Arm A had the possibility to cross over to JCAR017, a 2-stage Weibull 
approach was used. For PFS, subjects who crossed over to JCAR017 without progression or death were 
censored. In addition, rank preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) method (Ishak, 2014) and 
inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) method (Ishak, 2014) were to be investigated for OS 
as supportive analyses and for PFS as sensitivity analyses, if applicable depending on the rate of 
subjects crossing over to JCAR017 without previous disease progression.  
Quality of Life Analysis 
Completion and compliance rates for HRQoL were calculated for each instrument based on the ITT 
analysis set. All HRQoL analyses were conducted on the HRQoL analysis set and are to be interpreted 
as descriptive. Missing values were addressed according to questionnaire guidelines. Reasons for 
missing questionnaires were captured so that the appropriate imputation method could be applied 
according to questionnaire guidelines. The primary domains of interest for the HRQoL analysis were 
Global Health/Quality of Life (GH/QoL), Physical Functioning, Cognitive Functioning, Fatigue, Pain, and 
FACT LymS. For the individual-level analysis (ie. proportion of subjects’ with HRQoL 
improved/stable/deteriorated compared to their baseline), the thresholds contained in Table below and 
pre-specified in the SAP were used to determine a clinically important difference. 
Table 30. Clinically Meaningful Thresholds for Individual-Level Analysis 
There is no consensus in the literature regarding the methods (anchor-based versus distribution-based 
approach)  and  populations  used  to  derive  these  cut  off  values  and  the  results  from  the  analyses  of 
clinically  meaningful  change  may  be  altered  if  different  RDs  are  used.  Therefore,  the  cumulative 
distribution  frequency  (CDF)  curves  were  generated  to  plot  the  proportion  of  subjects  experiencing 
different degrees of change at Day 29, Day 64, Day 126 and Months 6 and 12 for each treatment group 
for the key domains of interest to support the findings from pre-specified RDs.

Analysis of subjects undergoing cross-over in Arm A 
Exploratory efficacy analyses for subjects randomized to Arm A who cross over to JCAR017 were based 
on the JCAR017-treated analysis set (Arm A Post-cross Over) and included: CRR, ORR, EFS (defined as 
the time from JCAR017 infusion to death due to any cause, PD, or start of a new antineoplastic therapy, 
whichever occurs first), PFS (defined as the time from JCAR017 infusion to death from any cause or PD, 
whichever occurs first), OS, DoR (defined as the time from first post-infusion response to PD, start of 
new  antineoplastic  therapy  or  death  due  to  any  cause).  Response  assessments  after  cross  over  were 
based on investigator’s assessment.

During study enrollment, a liso-cel contamination issue was identified in several subject lots. Due to this 
sterility issue, some subjects in the liso-cel arm had delayed liso-cel product availability and screened 
subjects were unable to be enrolled due to the lack of available leukapheresis slots until an investigation 
could  be  conducted.  Ten  subjects  were  not  randomized  because  of  this  contamination  issue  since  no 
apheresis slot was available.  
Seven (14.6%) subjects were not randomized due to a hold in recruitment activities as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. In the liso-cel arm, 3 (3.3%) subjects died due to COVID-19 (1 while on treatment 
and 2 during post-treatment follow-up) and 1 (1.1%) subject died due to SARS-CoV-2 infection during 
survival follow-up. In the SOC arm, 1 (1.1%) subject died due to SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory disease 
during post-treatment follow-up.

Subjects who Crossed Over from the SOC Arm 
Of  the  92  subjects  randomized  to  the  SOC  arm,  50  (54.3%)  were  approved  to  crossover  after  IRC 
confirmation of a qualifying event. Reasons for crossing over were progression (36 [72.0%] subjects), 
suboptimal response (8 [16.0%] subjects), and relapse (6 [12.0%] subjects. Of these 50 subjects, 3 
were approved to cross-over but did not go on to receive liso-cel or nonconforming product, 46 received 
liso-cel and 1 subject received nonconforming product. Forty (80%) subjects completed the treatment 
period  post-crossover,  3  (6.0%)  subjects  are  ongoing,  and  6  (12.0%)  subjects  discontinued  in  the 
treatment period: the reasons for discontinuation were disease relapse (4 [8.0%] subjects) and death 
(2 [4.0%] subjects) 
Recruitment 
The first subject signed an ICF for the study on 23 Oct 2018. The first and last subjects were randomized 
on 03 Dec 2018 and 08 Dec 2020, respectively. The study was conducted at 53 sites in 11 countries: 
Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, 
and the United States 
Conduct of the study 
Changes in the Conduct of the Study 
The original protocol (dated 07 Mar 2018) was amended 2 times prior to the data cut-off date of 08 Mar 
2021. In addition, there were 2 country-specific protocols for Germany and the UK. A country-specific 
addendum to Protocol Amendment 2 for Japan and a country-specific addendum to Protocol Amendment 
1 for Sweden were also approved. 
Protocol  Amendment  1  was  dated  06  Feb  2019;  the  main  changes  introduced  are  summarized  as 
follows: 
-  PMBCL and THRBCL were added given that these histologies have similar biological behaviour, 
are  treated  according  to  the  DLBCL  treatment  algorithm,  and  supporting  preliminary  data 
became available from Study 017001  
-  The definition of EFS was modified since the original protocol did not include the failure to achieve 
CR or PR by 9 weeks post-randomization as an event; the definition of PFS was modified since 
the original protocol also included SD at the first response assessment as an event 
- 
In Arm A (SOC), subjects were to receive 3 cycles of SOC: cycle time was updated from 28 days 
to 21 days to be in line with clinical practice; accordingly, start of HDCT was moved from Day 
85 to Day 71. The first efficacy assessment was moved from Day 57 to Day 64 and the second 
efficacy assessment was moved from Day 113 to Day 126 
-  Crossover criteria were updated since the original protocol permitted crossover only for subjects 
with a confirmed EFS event 
-  Recommendation for the selection of subjects with secondary CNS involvement was added and 
IT treatment was allowed 
- 
Inclusion  criterion  4  was  restricted  to  ECOG  performance  status  ≤1,  and  subjects  with  deep 
venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) and vascular tumour invasion were 
not eligible 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 60/186 
 
 
 
One  subject  was  enrolled  in  the  study  prior  to  the  change  of  EFS  primary  endpoint,  enrolment  was 
resumed only after approval of Protocol Amendment 1. The 1 subject enrolled under the original protocol 
continued in the study as planned and the change in EFS and PFS definition did not impact the subject’s 
outcome and analysis. 
Protocol  Amendment  2  was  dated  09  Dec  2019;  the  main  changes  introduced  are  summarized  as 
follows: 
-  Exclusion criteria were revised to only exclude patients with DVT or PE not managed on a stable 
regimen of anticoagulation or patients with progressive vascular tumour invasion, thrombosis, 
or embolism 
-  Pseudo-progression was specified not being an event for EFS 
-  Analyses to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were introduced 
The  SAP  JCAR017-BCM-003  Addendum  (version  1.1)  was  separately  approved  on  14  Apr  2021: 
updates primarily pertained to the addition of an additional efficacy interim analysis at approximately 
80% information fraction (see the statistical methods section above for details). 
Protocol deviations 
Screening and randomization for this trial was ongoing when WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a 
global pandemic on 11 Mar 2020. Completion of study enrolment was delayed by approximately 4 months 
due  to  the  pandemic.  Monitoring  activities  were  adapted  to  accommodate  changes  to  site,  Sponsor, 
and/or  country  policies  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic:  on-site  monitoring  visits  were  not  conducted 
while sites could not accept visitors or due to limitations on travel to sites, and the use of remote SDV 
was implemented on a site-by-site basis.  
Important  protocol  deviations  (IPDs)  were  defined  as  a  subset  of  protocol  deviations  that  might 
significantly  affect  the  completeness,  accuracy,  and/or  reliability  of  the  study  data  or  that  might 
significantly affect the subject’s rights, safety, or well-being. In the ITT analysis set, a total of 9 (9.8%) 
subjects  in  the  liso-cel  arm  and  9  (9.8%)  subjects  in  the  SOC  arm  had  at  least  1  important  protocol 
deviation. The most frequently reported important protocol deviations were related to failure to report 
SAEs/suspected  unexpected  serious  adverse  reaction  (SUSARs)  per  regulations  (9  [9.8%]  subjects  in 
the SOC arm and 8 [8.7%] subjects in the liso-cel arm). None of the important protocol deviations were 
related to eligibility criteria and none were attributed to COVID-19. 
A total of 19 (20.7%) subjects in the liso-cel arm and 10 (10.9%) subjects in the SOC arm had at least 
1 COVID-19-related protocol deviation. Overall, the most frequently reported COVID-19-related protocol 
deviation was procedures not performed per protocol (12 [6.5%] subjects) followed by visits performed 
outside protocol windows (9 [4.9%] subjects). None of the imaging or procedure deviations were missed 
efficacy assessments impacting the primary endpoint. 
The impact of the pandemic’s disruption on study conduct, as measured by its effect on the primary and 
key  secondary  objectives,  was  considered  to  be  minimal  based  on  the  following  criteria:  none  of  the 
important  protocol  deviations  were  attributed  to  COVID-19;  lack  of  subjects  with  missed  efficacy 
assessments impacting the primary endpoint; no subject discontinued in the treatment period and no 
treatments were delayed due to COVID-19; a relatively low number (1 [0.5%] subjects) of out of window 
assessments occurred due to COVID-19; low frequency of COVID-19-related AEs and deaths.

Outcomes and estimation 
Treatment exposure and compliance 
Ninety-one subjects in the SOC arm received salvage immunochemotherapy. The most frequently used 
regimen of salvage immunochemotherapy was R-ICE (n=63, 63.7%), followed by R-GDP (n=24, 26.4%) 
and  R-DHAP  (n=15,  16.5%).  Twelve  (13.2%)  subjects  switched  salvage  immunochemotherapy  and 
received  more  than  one  regimen.  The  most  frequently  reported  reason  to  switch  salvage 
immunochemotherapy was suboptimal response (5 subjects [5.5%]) followed by AE (4 subjects [4.4%]). 
Of  the  91  subjects  who  received  salvage  immunochemotherapy,  48  (52.7%)  discontinued  from 
treatment before starting HDCT. All 43 subjects who started HDCT went on to receive all HDCT agents 
and  42  (46.2%)  subjects  in  the  SOC  arm  received  HSCT  after  completing  HDCT.  The  1  subject  who 
received all HDCT agents but who was not recorded as having HSCT received their last dose on the date 
of the cut-off date used for this study analysis. 
Ninety-two subjects were randomized to the liso-cel arm. Two subjects discontinued before starting LDC. 
All 90 subjects who received LDC received all LDC agents for the expected 3 days (i.e., no agent was 
omitted); 89 (96.7%) went on to receive liso-cel and 1 (1.1%) received nonconforming product. A total 
of 58 (63.0%) subjects received bridging therapy to stabilize their disease during liso-cel manufacturing: 
28 (30.4%) received it due to high tumour burden and 23 (25.0%) due to rapid progression. The most 
frequently used bridging therapy was R-ICE. Nine subjects in the liso-cel arm were PET-negative at their 
pre-LDC assessment after receiving bridging therapy. The median time from randomization to liso-cel

infusion was 34 days (range: 24 to 104). Four subjects in the liso-cel arm had delayed liso-cel product 
availability due to a contamination issue at the manufacturing site. The median total liso-cel dose was 
99.92 × 106 cells (range: 97.1 to 102.5); the median CD8 and CD4 doses were 49.97 × 106 cells (range: 
48.0 to 51.8) and 49.89 × 106 cells (range: 48.1 to 51.5), respectively. 
Primary endpoint (EFS by IRC) 
At a pre-specified interim analysis at 80% of the information fraction with a median on-study follow up 
time  of  6.2  months  (range  0.9  to  20  months)  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful 
improvement in EFS was observed in the liso-cel arm compared to the SOC arm: HR = 0.349 (95% CI: 
0.229, 0.530); p-value < 0.0001 (see Table and Figure below).

Key secondary endpoints 
Complete Response Rate (CRR), Overall Response Rate (ORR) and measures of response duration 
A  statistically  significant  improvement  in  CRR  based  on  IRC  assessment  was  seen  in  the  liso-cel  arm 
(66.3% [95% CI: 55.7, 75.8]) compared to the SOC arm (39.1% [95% CI: 29.1, 49.9]); stratified one 
sided  p-value  <  0.0001.  A  higher  ORR,  based  on  IRC  assessment,  was  also  seen  in  the  liso-cel  arm 
compared to the SOC arm (see Table below).

Table 34. Summary of Best Overall Response Based on IRC Assessment in Study BCM-003 
(ITT Analysis Set) 
Based on Investigator’s assessment, a numerically higher CRR was observed in the liso-cel arm (57.6% 
[95% CI: 46.9, 67.9]) compared to the SOC arm (41.3% [95% CI: 31.1, 52.1]). The concordance rate 
of  IRC  and  investigator’s  assessments  of  disease  response  for  responders  and  non-responders  was 
95.1%.  All  the  remaining  sensitivity  analyses  for  CRR  showed  consistent  results  with  the  primary 
analysis. 
The median duration of complete response (DoCR) was 14.5 months (95% CI: 4.7, not evaluable) and 
NE (95% CI: 6.8, not evaluable) in the SOC and liso-cel arms, respectively (see Table and Figure below).

Progression-free survival (PFS) 
A  statistically  significant  improvement  in  PFS  was  observed  in  the  liso-cel  arm  compared  to  the  SOC 
arm: HR = 0.406 (95% CI: 0.250, 0.659); p-value = 0.0001 (see Table and Figure below).

An  improvement  in  PFS  based  on  IRC  assessment  (HRs  in  the  range  0.414  –  0.457)  continued  to  be 
observed in the liso-cel arm compared to the SOC arm in all the pre-specified sensitivity analyses for 
PFS. 
Overall survival (OS) 
At this interim analysis with a median follow up of 6 months, a numerical trend in favour of the liso-cel 
arm was observed: HR = 0.509 (95% CI: 0.258, 1.004); p-value = 0.0257 (see Table and Figure below).

At this interim analysis, the liso-cel arm did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in 
OS  compared  to  the  SOC  arm.  When  adjusted  for  the  confounding  effect  of  subjects  in  the  SOC  arm 
crossing over to receive liso-cel using the 2-stage Accelerated Failure Time Model, the results for OS are 
consistent with the ITT principle and generate a HR = 0.321 (95% CI: 0.160, 0.644). When adjusted for 
the  confounding  effect  of  subjects  in  the  SOC  arm  crossing  over  to  receive  liso-cel  using  the  rank-
preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) model, the results for OS are consistent with the ITT principle 
and generate a HR = 0.268 (95% CI: 0.117, 0.615).

Progression-free Survival on Next Line of Treatment 
A summary of PFS-2 based on the Investigator’s assessment is shown in Table below:

Based on investigator’s Assessment (ITT Analysis Set) 
High Dose Chemotherapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant 
Forty-three  (46.7%)  subjects  in  the  SOC  arm  completed  HDCT;  42  (45.7%)  of  subjects  went  on  to 
complete HSCT. Three months post-HSCT, the CR rate in subjects who completed HSCT was 76.2%. No 
subject in the liso-cel arm went on to receive HSCT for consolidation post-liso-cel infusion. 
HR-QoL 
The HRQoL analysis set consisted of 90 subjects for the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, and 85 for the 
FACT-LymS questionnaires (48.9% and 46.2% of the ITT analysis set, respectively). The analysis focuses 
on time points with number of available PRO assessments ≥10, i.e., up to Month 6.  
Compliance  rates  were  moderate  (≥40%)  across  all  visits  and  comparable  between  groups  for  all 
measures.  The  suboptimal  compliance  rate  was  due  to  technical  challenges  associated  with  the 
administration of the questionnaires during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Baseline values are reported in Table below:

Table 39. baseline Mean Scores on the EORTC QLQ-C30 Primary Domain of Interest and 
FACT-LymS 
Group-level Analysis: Mean Changes from Baseline 
Subjects treated with liso-cel showed a trend to improvement in lymphoma specific symptoms (FACT 
LymS scores), global health (GH/QoL), pain, cognitive functioning and fatigue during the first 6 months 
post infusion. The improvement crossed the MID line in several domains during multiple time points and 
was  particularly  prominent  in  GH/QoL,  cognitive  functioning,  and  fatigue.  Subjects  treated  with  SOC 
demonstrated a tendency to deterioration (sometimes beyond the MID line) in all these domains. Physical 
Functioning scores mostly remained stable and within MID and comparable in both arms. Results should 
be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. 
Individual-level Analysis: Proportion of Subjects Improved/No Change/Deteriorated 
Overall, more subjects improved and fewer worsened over time in most domains in the liso-cel arm and 
in some domains in the SOC arm. Overall, for most time points, more subjects experienced improvement 
(and fewer subjects experienced deterioration) in the liso-cel arm than in the SOC arm in the following 
domains: fatigue, pain, cognitive functioning, GH/QOL, FACT-LymS. 
The results, however, should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size and as no statistical 
testing has been performed to detect potential differences between the arms. Not collecting PRO data in 
subjects in the SOC arm after crossover could also have contributed to the limited number of subjects 
in the SOC arm with PRO assessments after 3 cycles of SOC treatment.

The liso-cel arm did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in OS compared to the SOC 
arm, although a numerical trend in favor of the liso-cel arm was demonstrated. The nature of the study 
did not allow to adequately power the test for OS due to various factors including the limited number of 
events (i.e., deaths) available for analysis and the confounding effect of subjects crossing over from the 
SOC arm to receive liso-cel.  
When adjusted for the confounding effect of subjects in the SOC arm crossing over to receive liso cel 
using the 2-stage Accelerated Failure Time Model, the results for OS are consistent with the ITT analysis 
and generate a HR = 0.415 (95% CI: 0.251, 0.686) favoring liso-cel over SOC. 
When adjusted for the confounding effect of subjects in the SOC arm crossing over to receive liso cel 
using the RPSFT model, the results for OS are consistent with the ITT principle and generate a HR = 
0.279 (95% CI: 0.145, 0.537) favoring liso-cel over SOC.

Correlations between one of the Two Drug Drug Product Component Quality Attribute and EFS 
For  the  attribute  ranges  observed  in  Study-BCM-003,  univariate  statistical  analyses  revealed  a 
correlative relationship between a T cell attribute in one of the two drug product component and EFS. 
This attribute exhibited a relationship with EFS (p= 2.985 × 10-4) such that variation in this attribute 
secretion was associated with a different risk of hazard of progression, death, failure to achieve CR/PR 
by  9  weeks  post  randomization  or  start  of  a  new  anti-neoplastic  therapy.  A  multivariate  analysis 
correcting for other patient characteristics (i.e., age, sex, ECOG, relapsed or refractory disease status, 
sAAIPI score, LDH, and SPD) was also performed, confirming the univariate findings.  
Quartile-based analyses confirmed a statistically significant relationship with EFS: equally split quartiles 
revealed a statistically significant relationship with EFS (p = 0.0016) in which the highest quartile of this 
attribute  demonstrates  a  median  EFS  of  6.14  months  compared  to  the  other  quartile  groups  (14.78 
months or median not reached yet). Optimally split analyses reveal a statistically significant relationship 
with EFS (p < 0.0001) in which the higher attribute group (x > 1789 pg/mL) demonstrates a median 
EFS of 4.07 months compared to the lower attribute group (14.78 months, see Figure below).

Notably, in both instances, even the expressors of this attribute demonstrate improved benefit in median 
EFS in liso-cel arm over the standard-of-care arm in Study BCM-003 (i.e. 2.3 months median EFS). 
As  these  associations  were  post-hoc  and  hypothesis  generating,  the  precise  biological  and  medical 
implications of these findings remain undetermined (see the Quality section above for additional details). 
To investigate whether this attribute offers offers some prognostic value in the clinical setting of 2L TI 
patients in general, patients whose apheresis was processed to manufacture liso-cel drug product, but 
were ultimately randomized into the SOC arm (Arm A) and not treated with liso-cel , were analyzed for 
potential  correlations  between  their  clinical  efficacy  outcomes,  with  chemoimmunotherapy  and 
transplant, and this T cell attribute  
The presented analyses indicate no statistically significant relationships between this T cell attribute liso-
cel drug product (manufactured for patients prior to randomization into the SOC Arm) and patient clinical 
efficacy outcomes upon their treatment with SOC. 
Efficacy in subjects who underwent crossover 
Fifty subjects were approved to crossover after IRC confirmation of a qualifying event. Of the 50 subjects 
approved to crossover, 46 received liso-cel; 1 received non-conforming product and 3 did not receive 
liso-cel.  Of  the  50  subjects  approved  to  crossover,  10  had  prior  HSCT.  For  this  interim  analysis,  the 
median follow-up (time from liso-cel infusion to the last date known alive) for subjects in the SOC arm 
who crossed-over to liso-cel was 4.14 months and the minimum follow-up was 0.4 months. 
Results from the cross-over subset are summarised in Table below.

Post-crossover)

Subjects who received liso-cel as 3L treatment in the crossover subgroup had lower response rates than 
those in 2L (liso-cel arm). However, the SOC arm post-crossover differed from the liso-cel arm in several 
ways: first, subjects in the SOC arm who received liso-cel post-crossover were subjects unable to achieve 
an  adequate  response  to  SOC  2L  therapy,  and  these  subjects  received  liso-cel  as  a  third-line  (3L) 
treatment. The patient populations also differ in that the SOC arm post-crossover contains subjects with 
rapidly  progressive  disease  who  may  not  have  been  able  to  wait  to  undergo  leukapheresis,  liso-cel 
manufacture, and subsequent administration. However, because they were enrolled in Study BCM-003, 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 82/186 
 
 
 
 
liso-cel had already been manufactured after their enrolment in the study and was available immediately 
at time of approval to crossover. 
Response  assessments  post-crossover  in  the  SOC  Arm  were  based  on  Investigator  assessment  only, 
while the response assessments from time of randomization in the liso-cel and SOC Arm were based on 
IRC assessments. In addition, the response assessment schedule was different: the assessments in the 
SOC  arm  post-crossover  began  when  liso-cel  was  administered.  After  administration  of  liso-cel  as 
crossover treatment, the only timepoints at which efficacy assessments were required were 3 months 
and  6  months  post  liso-cel  infusion.  Unless  progressive  disease  was  reported,  evaluation  of  efficacy 
endpoints based on disease assessment for these subjects were consequentially impacted by censoring 
before completion of the 12-month follow up period post liso-cel infusion. As a result, a larger number 
of subjects were censored post-crossover as compared to the liso-cel arm or SOC arm before crossover.

Methods 
Study  017006  was  an  open-label,  single-arm,  multicentre,  Phase  2  study  to  determine  the  antitumor 
activity, PK, and safety of liso-cel in subjects who were ineligible for autologous hematopoietic stem cell

transplantation  (ASCT)  (i.e.,  transplant  non-eligible  [TNE]),  and  relapsed  from,  or  are  refractory  to, 
front-line immunochemotherapy for large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL).  
The primary and secondary objectives/endpoints are summarised in table below: 
Table 44. Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints 
The study was divided into screening (1-2 weeks prior to leukapheresis), treatment, and post-treatment 
follow-up periods. The treatment period was defined as the period of time from the date on which LDC 
was first administered to Day 29 after liso-cel infusion. The post-treatment follow-up period was defined 
as  Day  30  after  liso-cel  infusion  to  end  of  study  (EOS).  Post-treatment  follow-up  included  safety  and 
disease follow-up visits at approximately 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after receiving liso-cel; 24 
months was the EOS visit. 
The study population included men and women (≥ 18 years old) with relapsed/refractory (R/R) LBCL of 
the following histologies at relapse: diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma (DLBCL) NOS (de novo or transformed 
from  follicular  lymphoma  [tFL]),  high-grade  B-cell  lymphoma  with  MYC  and  BCL2  and/or  BCL6 
rearrangements with DLBCL histology (double/triple hit lymphoma [DHL/THL]), or Follicular lymphoma 
grade 3B (FL3B) per World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 classification. Study eligibility was based 
on local pathologic diagnosis. If sufficient tissue was available, central confirmation of disease histology 
at baseline was performed retrospectively by an independent pathology laboratory. 
Eligible subjects were deemed ineligible for both high-dose chemotherapy and HSCT while also having 
adequate organ function for CAR T-cell treatment. Subjects must have met at least one of the following 
TNE  criteria:  age  ≥  70  years,  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG)  performance  status  =  2,

impaired pulmonary function defined by diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide [DLCO] ≤ 
60% adjusted for gender-specific hemoglobin concentration, impaired cardiac function: left ventricular 
ejection  fraction  (LVEF)  <  50%  by  echocardiogram  or  MUGA  scan  performed  within  4  weeks  of 
determination  of  eligibility,  calculated  creatinine  clearance(CrCl)  (Cockcroft  and  Gault)  <  60  mL/min 
and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 2 × upper limit of normal 
(ULN). 
Subjects with central nervous system (CNS)-only involvement by malignancy, history of another primary 
malignancy  that  had  not  been  in  remission  for  at  least  2  years,  or  previous  treatment  with  CD-19-
targeted therapy were excluded. 
Following  screening  and  enrolment,  leukapheresis  was  performed  on  each  subject.  Low-intensity  LDC 
regimen  consisting  of  cyclophosphamide  (300  mg/m2/day  ×  3  days)  combined  with  fludarabine  (30 
mg/m2/day  ×  3  days),  was  administered  prior  to  treatment  with  liso-cel.  Upon  notification  from  the 
sponsor that liso-cel was available, LDC was timed so as to be completed 2 to 7 days prior to liso-cel 
administration. All subjects were assigned to a single liso-cel dose of 100 × 106 CAR+ T cells (50 × 106 
CD8+  CAR+  T  cells  and  50  ×  106  CD4+  CAR+  T  cells),  administered  intravenously  (IV)  on  Day  1 
(between 2 and 7 days following the completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy [LDC]). 
The primary analysis was initially planned to be performed on a pooled analysis set containing combined 
data from Study 017006 and BCM-001 Cohort 2. With Protocol Amendment 6 (16-Aug-2021, 62 subjects 
already  treated),  it  was  specified  that  the  primary  analyses  and  formal  hypothesis  testing  was  to  be 
performed only on the Study 017006 dataset. The primary analysis was modified in order to be conducted 
after  approximately  62  subjects  were  treated  with  liso-cel  in  study  017006,  and  these  subjects  were 
followed for at least 6 months after first response (either CR or PR), or until death, progressive disease 
(PD), or withdrawal from study. The sample size in the Liso-cel-treated Efficacy Analysis Set for Study 
017006 was determined to provide at least 85% power to reject the null hypothesis of response rate 
less  than  50%  assuming  the  target  response  rate  of  70%  using  an  exact  binomial  test  with  1-sided 
significance level 0.025. The null hypothesis of 50% ORR used to size the study is supported by a meta-
analysis of second-line (2L) DLBCL studies with similar but not identical patient populations compared 
to  the  patient  population  to  be  enrolled  in  the  current  study.  Assuming  a  15%  drop-out  rate  from 
leukapheresis  prior  to  liso-cel  infusion,  it  was  anticipated  that  approximately  73  subjects  would  be 
leukapheresed in the study. 
Results 
Ninety-three  subjects  were  screened,  80/93  were  deemed  eligible,  74/80  were  leukapheresed,  12  of 
which  did  not  receive  liso-cel  or  nonconforming  product  for  the  following  reasons:  death  of  5  (6.8%) 
subjects, no longer met eligibility criteria in 5 (6.8%) subjects, and disease-related complications and 
reason of “other” in 1 (1.4%) subject each. Sixty-three subjects received LDC, and 61 received liso-cel 
(1  received  nonconforming  product).  Screening  and  enrolment  for  this  study  were  ongoing  when  the 
WHO  declared  the  COVID-19  outbreak  to  be  global  pandemic  on  12-Mar-2020.  As  a  result  of  the 
pandemic, the Sponsor temporarily suspended screening, enrolment, and apheresis in all cellular therapy 
trials,  including  Study  017006.  There  were  36  subjects  treated  with  liso-cel  as  of  Mar-2020  and  an 
additional 26 subjects were treated between Apr- to Dec-2020. As such, the impact on the study conduct 
and results was minimal. As of the data cutoff date for this CSR (24-Sep-2021), both the study and the 
COVID-19 pandemic were still ongoing. As a result of the pandemic, completion of study enrolment was 
delayed by approximately 5 months. A small proportion (2/62 [3%] subjects) died due to COVID-19-
related AEs. 
Demographic  characteristics  were  similar  between  the  Leukapheresed  Analysis  Set  and  the  Liso-cel-
treated Analysis Set (see Table below).

In the Liso-cel-treated Analysis Set, of the 61 subjects in the liso-cel treated analysis set, 41 met 1 TNE 
criterion,  17  met  2  TNE  criteria,  and  3  met  3  TNE  criteria.  Of  the  48  subjects  in  the  Liso-cel-treated 
Analysis Set who met the age ≥  70 criterion, 17 met at least one additional TNE criterion. Of the 31 
subjects in the Liso-cel-treated Analysis Set who met only the age ≥ 70 criterion, the median age was 
74 years (range: 70 to 84). Of these, 11/31 subjects had an aaIPI of 2 and 6/31 subjects had an aaIPI 
of 3 (see Figure below).

Based on IRC assessment in the Leukapheresed Analysis Set, the ORR was 67.6% (95% CI: 55.7, 78.0), 
the CRR 45.9% (95% CI: 34.3, 57.9), the median DoR 12.09 months (95% CI: 5.82, NR), the median 
PFS 10.48 months (95% CI: 5.13, 13.90) and the median EFS 8.15 months (95% CI: 4.37, 13.34). The 
KM estimate for the median OS in the Leukapheresed Analysis Set was NR (95% CI: 14.65, NR) and the 
median duration of follow-up for OS was 17.68 months (95% CI: 13.27, 19.15). Overall, 26 (35.1%) 
subjects in the Leukapheresed Analysis Set died. The survival rate at 3 months was 91.7% (95% CI: 
82.4, 96.2) and it gradually declined until 24 months, where it was 56.7 (95% CI: 42.2, 68.8).

Study  JCAR017-BCM-001  is  a  single-arm,  multi-cohort,  multi-center,  Phase  2  study  to  determine  the 
efficacy and safety of lisocabtagene maraleucel (JCAR017; BMS-986387; liso-cel) as treatment in adult 
subjects  with  large  B-cell  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  (LBCL).  The  current  submission  provides  the 
preliminary efficacy results observed in Cohort 2 (transplant not eligible [TNE] adult subjects with LBCL, 
DCO date Nov 2021).

The primary endpoint of Cohort 2 in the study is the IRC-reviewed ORR, defined as the proportion of 
subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of either CR or PR. The BOR was defined as the best disease 
response recorded from the time of the liso-cel infusion until disease progression, end of study, or the 
start  of  another  anticancer  therapy.  Secondary  endpoints  are:  CRR,  DoR  (evaluated  for  subjects  who 
achieved  a  response),  PFS  (when  PFS  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  leukapheresed  subjects  the 
reference was the date of leukapheresis that was closest to the liso-cel infusion), EFS (when the EFS 
analysis was conducted on the leukapheresed subjects, the reference was the date of leukapheresis that 
was closest to the liso-cel infusion),  and OS. 
DoR, PFS and EFS were analysed following the censoring rules per FDA guideline. Supportive analysis 
was performed using censoring rules per EMA guideline. 
The study population for Cohort 2 included TNE subjects aged ≥ 18 years with DLBCL NOS (de novo or 
transformed  from  follicular  lymphoma  [tFL]),  high-grade  B-cell  lymphoma  (HGBCL)  and  follicular 
lymphoma  grade  3B  (FL3B)  per  WHO  2016  classification,  who  failed  first  line  therapy,  including  an 
anthracycline and rituximab (or other CD20-targeted agent). For subjects with transformed disease, the 
subject was required to have had 1 line of systemic therapy for his/her transformed disease (ie, DLBCL) 
to be eligible. Lines of therapy did not include those given for a previously indolent condition. 
Transplant not eligible subjects included those who were not intended for high-dose chemotherapy and 
hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  (HSCT)  due  to  age,  performance  status  or  comorbidity,  while 
also having adequate organ function for CAR T-cell treatment. At the very least, subjects had to meet 
one of the following TNE criteria: age ≥ 70 years, ECOG performance status ≥ 2, diffusion capacity of 
carbon monoxide [DLCO] ≤ 60%, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] < 50%, creatinine clearance 
[CrCl] < 60 mL/min, aspartate aminotransferase [AST] / alanine aminotransferase [ALT] > 2 x upper 
limit of normal [ULN], bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dL or cirrhosis Child-Pugh B or C. 
Liso-cel was infused at a single liso-cel dose of 100 × 106 CAR+ T cells (50 × 106 CD8+ CAR+ T cells 
and  50  ×  106  CD4+  CAR+  T  cells),  administered  IV  on  Day  1  (between  2  and  7  days  following  the 
completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy [LDC]). The CD8+ and CD4+ components were thawed 
and administered consecutively by IV infusion. LDC was to be initiated to finish at least 2 days prior to 
liso-cel  infusion.  LDC  could  start  5  to  10  days  prior  to  liso-cel  infusion.  LDC  consisted  of  fludarabine 
intravenously (IV) (30 mg/m2/day for 3 days) and cyclophosphamide IV (300 mg/m2/day for 3 days). 
For  Cohort  2,  following  protocol  amendment  5  (12-Aug-2021,  subjects  enrolled  in  Cohort  2  n=32)  a 
sample  size  of  approximately  28  subjects  treated  with  liso-cel  conforming  product  was  selected  to 
provide at least 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of response rate <40% assuming the target 
response rate of 70% using an exact binomial test with 2-sided significance level 0.05. The reference 
rate  for  null  hypothesis  testing  for  Cohort  2  was  estimated  from  a  Real-World  Study  (formal  testing 
introduced with protocol amendment 5). For the purpose of this efficacy analyses, performed for health

authority submission, results were summarized descriptively: Cohort 2 was underpowered to test  the 
revised ORR reference rate of 50.2% based on RWE 2L TNE LBCL data; with a final sample size of 27, 
the power was 55% to correctly reject the null hypothesis (50.2%) when the alternative hypothesis of 
70% was true. At the time the decision was made to update the null hypothesis ORR to be based on 
RWE, enrolment in Cohort 2 had been completed and neither the actual RWE rate nor its effect on the 
power was known. 
Results 
Overall, 32 subjects underwent leukapheresis in Cohort 2, and 27 subjects were treated with liso-cel. 
Five subjects were leukapheresed, but did not proceed with LDC and liso-cel. Of these, 3 died, 1 did not 
proceed because Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score did not meet 
the inclusion criteria, and 1 was not yet infused at the time of data cut. During the Post-treatment Period, 
among the 25 (92.6%) liso-cel-treated subjects who continued the follow-up; 16 (59.3%) subjects were 
still ongoing, while 9 (33.3%) subjects had discontinued, most commonly due to death (25.9%). 
Completion of study enrollment was delayed by approximately 4 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The impact of the pandemic’s disruption on study conduct was considered to be minimal since there were 
no  important  protocol  deviations  due  to  COVID-19,  no  subjects  discontinued  the  Post-treatment  or 
Survival Follow-up Periods due to COVID-19, no subject was reported with any AEs related to COVID-19 
and there was 1 death related to COVID-19 during the pre-treatment period that occurred prior to the 
initiation of LDC. 
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics among the liso-cel-treated and leukapheresed subjects 
were similar (see Table below):

Of these 27 subjects, 16 met 1 TNE criterion, 10 met 2 TNE criteria, and met 3 TNE criteria. The most 
common  criterion  met  was  age  ≥  70  (24  [88.8%])  subjects)  followed  by  ECOG  PS  =  2  (9  [33.3%] 
subjects) and creatine clearance < 60 mL/min (3 [11.1%] subjects).

Based on IRC assessment in liso-cel-treated subjects, the median DOR among the 13 subjects achieving 
CR was 12.12 months (95% CI: 1.64, NE), whereas in the 4 subjects achieving PR, the median DOR was 
2.69 months (95% CI: 2.10, 2.69). 
Results in additional sensitivity analyses are as follows: 
Based on investigator’s assessment in liso-cel-treated subjects, the ORR was 74.1% (20/27 subjects; 
95%  CI:  53.7,  88.9),  the  CRR  37.0%  (10/27  subjects;  95%  CI:  19.4,  57.6).  Based  on  Investigator

assessment in liso-cel-treated subjects using EMA censoring criteria, the median DOR was 2.69 months 
(95% CI: 1.87, NE), the median PFS 3.12 months (95% CI: 1.97, 5.78) and the median EFS 3.12 months 
(95% CI: 1.97, 5.78). 
Based on IRC assessment in Leukapheresed subjects, the ORR was 53.1% (17/32 subjects; 95% CI: 
34.7,  70.9),  the  CRR  37.5%  (12/32  subjects;  95%  CI:  21.1,  56.3).  Based  on  IRC  assessment  in 
leukapheresed subjects using EMA censoring criteria, the median DOR was 4.50 months (95% CI: 2.10, 
NE),  the  median  PFS  4.67  months  (95%  CI:  3.65,  7.75)  and  the  median  EFS  4.67  months  (95%  CI: 
3.65, 7.23). 
In  the  sensitivity  analysis,  the  KM  estimate  for  the  median  OS  in  leukapheresed  subjects  was  11.37 
months (95% CI: 5.68, NE). The median follow-up time was 8.84 months (95% CI: 7.29, 12.91).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Based on the results from pivotal Phase III study JCAR017-BCM-003, the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
(MAH) requested an extension of the indication to include subjects who were refractory or had relapsed 
Assessment report

within  12  months  of  initial  therapy  and  were  candidates  for  autologous  haematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplant (HSCT). The finally agreed extended indication is: 
Breyanzi  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  (DLBCL), 
high grade B cell lymphoma (HGBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and follicular 
lymphoma grade 3B (FL3B), who relapsed within 12 months from completion of, or are refractory to, 
first-line chemoimmunotherapy. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study design of the pivotal study BCM-003 is overall compliant to the 2017 CHMP scientific advice 
(SA),  although  additional  changes  have  been  introduced  to  address  further  requests  from.  a  health 
agency 
Study participants 
The  study  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  were  adequate  to  define  a  study  population  that  included  adult 
subjects with large B-cell lymphomas who have failed standard frontline immunochemotherapy (i.e., R-
CHOP  or  other  combinations  based  on  anthracycline  and  anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibody)  and  are  at 
higher risk of salvage treatment failure due to primary refractory disease or short-lasting response to 
frontline treatment. 
The unmet medical need in the target population is recognised: despite salvage immunochemotherapy 
followed  by  high-dose  chemotherapy  (HDCT)  and  autologous  stem  cell  transplant  (ASCT)  has  been 
demonstrated  to  result  in  long-term  disease  remission/cure  in  approximately  40%  of  2nd  line  DLBCL 
patients (Philip T et al, 1995), the CORAL (Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma) study 
showed  how  subjects  treated  with  rituximab-based  first-line  chemo-immunotherapies  and  either  not 
achieving  CR  or  experiencing  early  relapse  (i.e.  relapsed  within  1  year  of  initial  diagnosis)  still  had  a 
higher risk of salvage failure (3-year PFS ~20%,. Gisselbrecht C et al, 2010; Hamadani M et al,. 2014, 
Van Den Neste E et al, 2016).  
In line with the CHMP SA, subjects with several different LBCL histologies (as per the revised 2016 WHO 
classification  of  lymphoid  neoplasms;  Swerdlow  SH  et  al,  2016)  were  deemed  eligible;  following  FDA 
request,  study  eligibility  was  further  broadened  to  specifically  include  subjects  with  PMBCL  and  T 
cell/histiocyte rich B-cell lymphoma (THRBCL). The inclusion of PMBCL is not controversial, being already 
considered in the approved 3rd line indication. THRBCL is a rare (1-3%) variant of DLBCL characterised 
by  atypical  histology  (i.e.,  fewer  than  10%  malignant  B  cell  in  the  setting  of  polyclonal  T  cells  +/- 
histiocytes), frequent extranodal involvement and aggressive clinical course. Preliminary data suggested 
that primary resistance to CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy in THRBCL might not be uncommon (Trujillo 
JA et al, 2021).  
The  limited  information  with  Breyanzi  in  subjects  with  CD19-negative  disease  has  been  reflected  in 
section  4.4  of  the  SmPC.  Considering  this  aspect,  further  characterisation  of  the  correlation  between 
liso-cel efficacy and CD19 expression (as assessed by either flow cytometry or IHC at the time of relapse) 
is  considered  needed  and  data  will  be  collected  post  approval  of  the  new  indication.  Subjects  with 
secondary  CNS  involvement  could  be  enrolled  in  study  BCM-003  if  the  individual  patient  B/R  was 
considered positive by the Investigator. Eventually, only 4 subjects with CNS involvement were treated 
in the pivotal study, and specific B/R evaluations were, therefore, hampered by the reduced sample size. 
A warning on the limited clinical experience of use of Breyanzi for secondary CNS lymphoma is already 
included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Autologous transplant was mandatory in the control arm of study BCM-003, hence participation in the 
pivotal trial was restricted to higher risk 2nd line patients with large B cell lymphomas (LBCLs) who were

deemed  fit  for  ASCT.  The  claimed  indication  was  also  initially  worded  to  reflect  ASCT-fitness  as  a 
requirement.  The  CAT  noted,  however,  that  such  wording  was  ambiguous,  since  patients  eligible  to 
Breyanzi were not actually intended to undergo ASCT in real-world clinical practice. Moreover, the very 
use  of  ASCT  eligibility  criteria  to  identify  patients  fit  for  CAR  T-cell  treatment  was  questioned:  ASCT 
eligibility assessment is known to be a complex, not standardised evaluation that incorporates multiple 
variables  (e.g.,  functional  status,  organ  function,  comorbid  conditions,  psychosocial  issues,  disease 
status, local access to transplant procedures, patient preferences etc.), so that ASCT fitness criteria can 
vary  significantly  between  institutions.  Most  importantly,  the  safety  profiles  of  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell 
ATMPs and ASCT are different (see the Safety section below) and since eligibility to Breyanzi is expected 
to be based on a specific clinical reasoning, it cannot be excluded that some non-transplant eligible (NTE) 
subjects could still benefit from treatment with Breyanzi. With the support of data from studies 017006 
and  BCM-001  Cohort  2  (see  below),  the  indication  wording  has  been  reworded  to  avoid  reference  to 
ASCT eligibility. 
Treatment 
Subjects in study BCM-003 were randomised either to SOC (Arm A) or liso-cel (Arm B).  
Liso-cel was administered in accordance with the current recommendations in the SmPC.  
The SOC arm is considered representative of the current standard of care in the target population (Tilly 
H et al, 2015] and NCCN v. 5.2022 guidelines): transplant-eligible LBCL patients who have failed frontline 
immunochemotherapy  are  usually  managed  with  non-cross  resistant  “salvage”  immunotherapy 
combinations (e.g., regimens including gemcitabine, cytarabine and/or platinum), with the main aim to 
reduce disease bulk and (re-)induce remission. Response to salvage immunochemotherapy is a sign of 
residual  chemosensitivity  and  represents  an  independent  prognostic  factor  for  long-term  benefit  with 
HDCT and ASCT. Subjects in study BCM-003 could receive 3 cycles of R-DHAP, R-ICE or R-GDP, as per 
physician  preference:  this  is  acceptable,  since  the  three  SOC  regimens  are  frequently  used  in  clinical 
practice and randomized studies have not shown any clear evidence supporting the superiority of one 
regimen over another. The choice to allow for multiple SOC combinations in the control arm of study 
BCM-003 is endorsed to enhance results generalisability, since in real world practice salvage regimens 
are often selected taking into consideration differences in the safety profile. In case of toxicity or lack of 
satisfactory  response  to  the  selected  SOC  regimen,  a  switch  within  the  3  defined  SOC  regimen  was 
allowed: this is also acceptable to further enhance adherence to clinical practice.  
Subjects who were able to achieve disease remission/response (i.e., CR or PR evaluated by PET/CT) with 
salvage immunochemotherapy could proceed to HDCT and ASCT. The BEAM combination was selected 
as conditioning regimen, as per current guidelines recommendations (Tilly H et al, 2015).  
Cross-over from SOC to liso-cel was allowed. In principle, the introduction of a one-way cross-over to 
liso-cel might result in OS evaluations being confounded. On the other hand, it is recognised that anti-
CD19 CAR T-cell products are the current 3rd line efficacy standard and introducing the possibility for “in 
study” cross-over allowed for a better control of subsequent treatments in the control arm. This could, 
theoretically, also provide some insight in terms of better treatment sequence (i.e., liso-cel in 2nd line 
vs. SOC followed by liso-cel in non-responders).  
Objectives and endpoints 
The primary objective of study BCM-003 was to compare the efficacy of liso-cel vs. SOC in the target 
population in terms of event-free survival (EFS). Response to treatment was assessed according to the 
Lugano  criteria  (Cheson  et  al,  2014)  by  the  IRC:  this  is  in  line  with  current  clinical  standards  and 
acceptable.

EFS is a composite time-to-event endpoint that has been frequently used in curative settings of blood 
diseases in order to speed approvals. EFS is usually defined in such a way to capture clinical benefit in 
terms of optimal conditions to achieve long-term disease control in a specific setting. The choice of EFS 
as primary endpoint in study BCM-003 was considered acceptable by the CHMP in the 2017 SA. 
EFS was defined in the pivotal trial as the time from randomisation to death from any cause, PD, failure 
to achieve CR/PR by 9 weeks post-randomisation and start of any anti-neoplastic therapy due to efficacy 
concerns,  whichever  occurred  first.  It  should  be  noted  that  this  definition  was  introduced  with 
Amendment  1  and  differed  from  the  one  endorsed  by  the  CHMP  in  the  SA  (i.e.,  the  time  from 
randomisation to death, PD or start of any anti-neoplastic therapy, whichever occurred first). Failure to 
achieve  CR/PR  at  the  end  of  3  cycles  of  salvage  chemotherapy  or  5  weeks  after  liso-cel  infusion  was 
introduced  as  an  event  to  enhance  adherence  to  clinical  practice:  reaching  disease  remission  before 
ASCT  is,  in  fact,  considered  a  sign  of  residual  chemosensitivity,  an  independent  prognostic  factor  for 
long-term  disease  control  and  a  pre-requisite  to  proceed  to  ASCT  consolidation.  In  clinical  practice, 
subjects failing to achieve response to 2nd line salvage regimens are candidate for 3rd line approaches, 
including anti-CD19 CAR T cell products. Therefore, the changes introduced in the EFS definition since 
the  2017  CHMP  SA  can  be  considered  in  line  with  current  guidelines  recommendations  and  overall 
acceptable.  The  timing  for  pre-transplant  response  assessment  (i.e.,  9  weeks  post-randomisation) 
allowed  for  the  completion  of  salvage  chemotherapy  and  was  adequate  to  evaluate  response  in  the 
experimental arm, since the median time to first CR/PR in the Breyanzi registrational study was 0.95 
months. It should be taken into consideration, however, that when EFS has been selected as primary 
endpoint  in  other  acute  hematologic  conditions,  it  was  shown  that  median  EFS  estimates  differed 
considerably  based  on  the  timing  of  the  response  assessment  in  defining  induction  failure,  with  the 
magnitude  of  difference  being  large  enough  in  some  cases  to  impact  conclusions  (Yin  J  et  al,  2019). 
Consistent results in the key secondary endpoint PFS (not including failure to achieve CR/PR as an event) 
and OS are, therefore, also considered key in supporting the clinical benefit conclusions. 
The proposed sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoints are considered of relevance and acceptable. 
Although the study was not formally designed under an “estimand” framework, intercurrent events in 
the  primary  endpoint  analysis  were  dealt  with  a  mixed  strategy:  response  to  bridging  therapy  in  the 
experimental arm and manufacturing issues preventing the infusion of liso-cel were addressed under a 
strict “treatment policy strategy”, since they were considered to reflect clinical practice in the real-world 
setting. This is in line with the ITT principle and agreed. 
PD events in unscheduled visits were addressed under a “composite” strategy: this is in principle agreed, 
since in the current treatment paradigm for R/R LBCL, residual sensitivity to chemoimmunotherapy (as 
indicated by achieving CR with salvage regimens) is a necessary pre-requisite to proceed to ASCT. In 
study BCM-003, the first efficacy assessment to confirm CR in the SOC arm was planned to be performed 
at Day 64 (i.e., approximately after 3 cycles of SOC, corresponding to 5 weeks after liso-cel infusion). 
However, in RW clinical practice salvage therapy failure is usually assessed as early as possible in order 
to  switch  to  alternative  options  and  save  the  patient  unneeded  toxicity.  Early  unscheduled  PD 
assessments were, therefore, expected to be systematically more frequent in the SOC arm compared to 
liso-cel. The data provided by the MAH confirmed that early unscheduled PD assessments (i.e., before 
Day  64)  were  significantly  more  common  in  the SOC  arm  (n=21)  compared  to  the  experimental  arm 
(n=3).  Although  this  imbalance  might  have  theoretically  favoured  the  experimental  arm,  it  is  agreed 
that early assessment of PD does not have the same value in the context of conventional therapy and 
CAR T-cell therapy. While progression during immunochemotherapy is the sign of chemoresistance and 
precludes access to transplantation, determining the failure of the salvage treatment strategy, evidence 
of  PD  occurring  in  the  time  between  leukapheresis  and  CAR  T-cells  administration  has  no  significant 
impact on the final outcomes with CAR T-cell products, except for those patients whose worsening clinical 
conditions would not allow for CAR T-cells infusion. This is confirmed by the fact that although 83.9% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023

subjects who received bridging chemotherapy in the liso-cel arm of study BCM-003 were PET/CT-positive 
before LDC, PD was reported only in 5/89 at the first disease status assessment post liso-cel infusion 
(Day  64).  The  observed  imbalance  in  the  frequency  of  unscheduled  early  PD  assessment  across 
treatment arms can be considered, therefore, in line with current clinical practice and unavoidable. 
The  (key)  secondary  and  exploratory  efficacy  endpoints  in  study  BCM-003  are  considered,  overall, 
adequate to further characterise the clinical benefit with liso-cel in the target population.  
Statistical methods and conduct of the study 
Sample size calculations were driven by the number of required EFS events and based on the assumption 
of a median EFS (mEFS) of 3 months in the control arm vs. ~5.5 months in the experimental arms (HR 
0.55). Overall, 119 EFS events were required to provide at least 90% power with a one-sided significance 
level of 0.025, resulting in a minimum of 182 subjects to be randomised. The clinical assumptions are 
considered justified when the limited evidence at the time of study initiation is taken into account. The 
observed mEFS in the control arm was actually shorter (2.3 months) than expected, yet the 95%CI (2.2, 
4.3) still included the assumed value (i.e. 3 months). Conversely, the mEFS observed in the experimental 
arm was significantly longer than assumed (mEFS 10.1 months, 95%CI 6.1, NE), increasing the already 
elevated study power. When the magnitude of the observed effect and its clinical value are taken into 
account, however (see the Efficacy data section below), the possible consequences of such overpowering 
are considered of limited relevance. The Applicant pre-planned an adaptive strategy for increasing the 
number  of  patients  based  on  the  Bayesian  predictive  probabilities  approach:  although  sample  size 
reassessment  in  ongoing,  open-label  studies  is  in  principle  discouraged,  no  sample-size  increase  was 
eventually required in the pivotal study since the pre-defined criteria for superiority of liso-cel were met 
at the time of the second IA. 
All subjects were randomised at a 1:1 ratio to SOC or liso-cel using a permuted-blocks methodology: 
this is acceptable, as well as the selected stratification factors (refractory vs. relapsed and sAAIPI 0/1 
vs. 2/3). Due the significant differences in treatment strategies across study arms, the unfeasibility of 
blinding can be acknowledged, and additional measures to maintain study integrity (e.g. the Applicant 
and  the  IRC  were  blinded  to  the  treatment  arm,  and  an  independent  DSMB  was  in  charge  of  safety 
oversight) were anyway put in place. This is acceptable.   
Overall,  the  statistical  methods  used  for  time-to-event  and  binary  endpoints  are  standard  and 
acceptable, including the approach based on Schoenfeld residuals to evaluate the proportional hazards 
assumption. 
The  hierarchical  testing  strategy  to  control  multiplicity  across  endpoints  and  the  O’Brien-Fleming 
approach  to  allocate  Type  I  error  rate  across  IAs  were  considered  methodologically  appropriate.  The 
futility analysis was conducted on November 2019: no formal statistical testing occurred and the DSMB 
recommended  to  continue  the  study  without  modifications.  The  pre-specified  superiority  IA  was 
conducted on November 2020 at 63% information fraction and the DSMB confirmed that the pre-defined 
criteria to claim superiority were met.  Health agency recommendations, however, were to continue the 
study  without  modification  and  to  conduct  another  IA  at  80%  information  fraction  for  regulatory 
purposes. In principle, the introduction of new IAs in ongoing, open-label studies could raise concerns 
on study integrity. From a regulatory perspective, however, when the limited number of events at the 
time of the 60% information fraction IA (n=75) are taken into consideration, the health agency concerns 
about the overall data maturity and results representativeness can be shared. Further, the requested 
additional IA was also in line with the 2017 CHMP SA, in which the need for sufficient data maturity was 
stressed.  Overall,  the  impact  of  this”  Interim  analysis  on  study  integrity  is  considered  limited:  study 
BCM-003 had already met his primary objective at the 60% information fraction IA, and the only purpose 
of the new IA was to increase data maturity. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of bias, an independent

external  statistical  group  was  responsible  for  the  additional  IA,  and  the  O’Brien-Fleming  spending 
function was updated to maintain the overall type I error control across the IAs and primary analysis. 
This is considered overall acceptable.  
At  the  data  cut-off  date  for  the  80%  IA,  the  crossover  rate  from  SOC  arm  to  liso-cel  arm  was  about 
54.3%, leading to a possible underestimation of the true survival benefit with liso-cel in the conventional 
ITT analysis.  
The statistical analyses proposed for Quality of Life (QoL) are also considered in principle acceptable. 
The  open-label  nature  of  the  study  and  the  lack  of  control  of  multiplicity  hampered,  however,  the 
possibility for HR-QoL-based claims. 
Overall,  only  2  major  amendments  were  issued  during  study  conduct.  Theoretically  the  impact  of 
amendment 1 ongoing changes on study integrity cannot be considered negligible. On the other hand, 
as highlighted by the MAH, when Amendment 1 was issued, only 1 patient had been enrolled, thus the 
overall impact of the introduced changes on study integrity is considered minor. Changes in Amendment 
2 were of less clinical/methodological relevance, with one exception: pseudo-progression was specified 
not being an event for EFS. Overall, only 7 cases of pseudoprogression were reported in study BCM-003, 
3 (3.3%) in the SOC arm and 4 (4.3%) in the liso-cel arm. When the different nature of liso-cel and 
immunochemotherapy  is  considered,  the  observed  similar  incidence  of  pseudoprogression  in  the  SOC 
and liso-cel arms was unexpected. Additional information on the “pseudoprogression” events reported 
in the control arm showed that all the events in subjects who received salvage therapy in study BCM-
003  occurred,  in  the  absence  of  severe  leukopenia,  at  the  time  of  the  interim  PET/CT  scan  (i.e. 
approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of salvage immunochemotherapy), or shortly after ASCT (i.e. 
approximately 3 months post ASCT). Adams HJA et al. (2016) have described how false-positive PET/CT 
scans during or shortly after completion of anti-lymphoma treatment are far from uncommon, ranging 
between  7.7%  and  90.5%  of  all  biopsied  FDG-avid  lesions,  and  mainly  result  from  treatment-related 
inflammatory changes in existing tumour masses. The transient PET/CT positivity events observed in the 
SOC  arms  are,  therefore,  likely  to  reflect  post-chemotherapy  reactive  inflammation  rather  than 
immunotherapy-related “pseudoprogression”; the very use of the term “pseudoprogression” to describe 
such events, although in line with the study IRC charter, cannot be considered fully appropriate. Due to 
very limited numbers, the impact of such events on efficacy results is, anyway, negligible 
Overall,  an  equal  number  of  subjects  reported  at  least  one  important  protocol  deviation  (IPD)  in  the 
experimental (n=9; 9.8%) and control arms (n=9; 9.8%) of study BCM-003. Most IPD were related to 
failure to report SUSARs and their impact on study efficacy is considered limited. Due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, study enrolment was delayed by ~4 months, yet no IPD involved COVID-19, no subject had 
missed response assessments, discontinued, or delayed treatment because of COVID-19. Out of window 
visits due to COVID-19 were limited (0.5%), as well as the number of subjects with COVID-19 related 
AEs or deaths (see the Safety section below). Overall, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on study 
conduct is considered limited. 
Supportive studies 017006 and BCM-001 Cohort 2 
In the initial submission limited data were available on the efficacy of Breyanzi in 2nd line non-transplant 
eligible  (NTE)  high-risk  patients.  To  further  characterise  the  clinical  benefit  with  liso-cel  in  this  frailer 
subset, the MAH submitted efficacy data from studies 017006 and BCM-001 Cohort 2 that investigated 
the efficacy and safety of Breyanzi in NTE subjects with R/R LBCLs. 
Results from supportive study 017006 and study BCM-001 Cohort 2 are only seen as descriptive in the 
context of this extension indication application.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  proportion  of  subjects  who  discontinued  during  the  treatment  phase  of  study  BCM-003  was 
significantly higher in the SOC (~60%) compared to the liso-cel arm (~12%). This is not unexpected 
when the significant differences in ORR and CRR across treatment arms are taken into account, especially 
considering that only subjects achieving a PR/CR with salvage chemotherapy could proceed to ASCT in 
the SOC arm.  
Only one patient in the liso-cel arm did not receive the planned treatment due to manufacturing failure, 
and  two  subjects  (1  in  the  liso-cel  arm  and  1  in  the  cross-over  subset)  received  a  non-conforming 
product: these data support the overall robustness of the manufacturing process.  
Baseline and disease characteristics in study BCM-003 were overall balanced across treatment arms and 
representative of the target population. As expected, since ASCT was part of the treatment strategy in 
the SOC arm, the vast majority of patients were medically fit (ECOG PS score ≤1 in ~98% of patients 
and  median  HCT-CI  score  1.0).  A  slight  increase  in  the  prevalence  of  male  subjects  was  observed 
(57.1%),  in  line  with  the  known  epidemiology  of  most  LGBCLs;  however,  male  subjects  were  more 
frequent in the SOC (66.3%) compared to the liso-cel arm (47.8%): male gender has been associated 
with  a  poor  prognosis  in  DLBCL  patients  treated  with  rituximab-containing  regimens  (Yldirim  M  et  al, 
2015), thus a possible impact on study results, although hardly quantifiable, cannot be excluded.  
Rarer  LGBL  subtypes  were  poorly  represented  (e.g.,  FL3B  0.5%,  THRBCL  2.7%),  hampering  the 
possibility for dedicated B/R evaluations. The MAH has committed to update the PASS (Study JCAR017-
BCM-005) protocol to collect further data on 2nd line LBCL patients with rare histologies. Such changes 
will  be  applied  and  reflected  in  the  protocol  of  the  PASS  study  upon  approval  of  this  extension  of 
indication  procedure.  As  already  discussed  in  the  original  submission  for  Breyanzi,  extrapolation  of 
clinical  activity  to  FL3B  can  be  accepted,  based  on  clinical  and  biological  similarities  with  DLBCL  and 
transformed FL (see the Breyanzi EPAR). With respect to THRBCL, the MAH specified that only 5 subjects 
with THRBCL were treated in study BCM-003, and only 2/5 received liso-cel (1 subject in the liso-cel arm 
and  1  subject  in  the  control  arm  after  cross-over  to  liso-cel.  Although  1  subject  with  THRBCL  who 
received liso-cel experienced sustained CR, reliable conclusions on the efficacy and tolerability of liso-cel 
in the THRBCL population were hampered by limited numbers. No claim for the treatment of THRBCL 
has been included in the proposed indication.  
The results submitted to support the claimed extension of indication for Breyanzi are based on an IA at 
80% information fraction (data cut-off date 08 Mar 2021).In line with historical data, approximately half 
(~46%)  of  the  subjects  who  received  salvage  immunochemotherapy  in  the  SOC  arm  were  able  to 
proceed to HDCT and ASCT; the HDCT-ASCT rates reported in literature with the SOC regimens (but also 
including lower-risk patients) were in the range 51-55%, supporting the external validity of study results 
(Gisselbrecht C et al, 2010; Kuruvilla J et al, 2015). 
With a median survival follow-up of 6 months and 53% of subjects with an event at the data cut-off date 
for the inferential 80% IA, study BCM-003 met its primary objective: the median EFS by IRC was 2.3 
months (95%CI 2.2, 4.3) with SOC and 10.1 months (95%CI 6.1, NE) with liso-cel, resulting in a EFS 
HR of 0.349 (95%CI 0.229, 0.530; p<0.0001). The 6-month EFS rates were 33.4% and 63.3%, in the 
SOC and liso-cel arms, respectively, with the KM curves diverging early to remain clearly separated. The 
KM curve tails were, however, poorly informative due to the reduced number of subjects at risk. 
The  results  from  all  the  pre-specified  sensitivity  analyses  for  EFS  were  consistent  with  the  primary 
analysis, including EFS not adjusting for stratification factors (HR 0.376, 95%CI 0.248, 0.569), EFS by 
Investigator’s  assessment  (HR  0.343,  95%CI  0.225,  0.522),  EFS  using  the  stricter  “FDA  imaging 
interpretation  rules”  (HR  0.383,  95%CI  0.254,  0.576),  and  EFS  censoring  for  RT  (HR  0.344,  95%CI 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 114/186 
 
 
 
0.266,  0.523)  or  not  including  subjects  who  were  PET/TC  negative  after  bridging  chemotherapy  (HR 
0.353, 95%CI 0.209, 0.595).  
The submitted updated efficacy data from the primary analysis of study BCM-003 (data cut-off date 13 
May  2022)  covered  a  longer  follow-up  (mFU  17.53  and  17.49  months,  in  the  liso-cel  and  SOC  arm, 
respectively) and a higher number of events (38% and 68.5% in the liso-cel and SOC arm, respectively) 
showing that the updated EFS analysis by IRC was consistent with the results observed in the interim 
analysis (IA) at 80% information fraction: the updated HR for EFS based on IRC assessment was 0.356 
(95%CI 0.243, 0.522), the mEFS was not reached in the experimental arm (NE, 95%CI 9.5, NE) vs. 2.4 
months (95%CI 2.2, 4.9) in the control arm. The updated KM curves for EFS started diverging from time 
0 to remain clearly separated until the end, and a plateau phase could be identified from approximately 
month 12 onwards in both treatment arms, suggesting a possible improvement in terms of cure/long-
term disease control rate with liso-cel compared to SOC. 
Failure to achieve PR/CR with salvage treatments is known to negatively impact on long-term outcomes, 
yet a subset of patients who fail to achieve disease remission in 2nd line might still benefit from HDCT 
and  ASCT.  In  this  regard,  PFS  analysis  (which  does  not  consider  the  failure  to  achieve  CR/PR  as  an 
event) is considered of value to further characterise clinical benefit with liso-cel. With 39% of subjects 
in study BCM-003 who had an event, the key secondary endpoint PFS was met: mPFS by IRC was 5.7 
months  (95%CI  3.9,  9.4)  in  the  SOC  arm  and  14.8  months  (95%CI  6.6,  NE)  in  the  liso-cel  arm, 
respectively. The PFS HR was 0.406 (95%CI 0.250, 0.659, p=0.0001), with the KM curves showing a 
trend similar to those observed in the primary EFS analysis. PFS2 data were also provided, and results 
were consistent with the PFS analysis (HR 0.494, 95%CI 0.321, 0.760); data immaturity (only 4 subjects 
had a second progression event reported), however, did not allow for definitive conclusions. 
The updated PFS by IRC data from the primary efficacy analysis of study BCM-003 were consistent 
with the EFS analysis and with data previously submitted at the time of the 80% IA: the updated HR 
was 0.400 (95%CI 0.261, 0.615) and the updated KM curves for PFS showed a consistent trend towards 
clinical benefit with liso-cel.  
Subgroup analyses for EFS and PFS must be interpreted with caution, due to the limited sample size in 
several  subgroups.  The  observed  treatment  effect  was,  overall,  consistent  across  the  most  relevant 
subsets,  including  subgroups  defined  by  sAAIPI,  refractoriness  to  frontline  treatment  and  prior 
chemotherapy response status, age (with the caveat that no subject aged ≥75 years received liso-cel in 
study BCM-003), sex and region. No significant differences in EFS could be observed in subgroups defined 
by histology subtypes. Although numbers were limited, the observed homogeneity of response and the 
consistent pattern of expression of CD19 across all subgroups are considered sufficient to extrapolate 
that a similar clinical benefit with Breyanzi vs. SOC can be expected across all these conditions. The very 
limited  number  of  subjects  (n=1)  in  the  FL3B  subgroup  cannot  be  considered  sufficient,  however,  to 
support  specific  B/R  evaluations.  FL3B  is  a  rare  form  of  aggressive  B-cell  lymphoma  whose  clinical 
behaviour  and  treatment  paradigm  do  not  differ  significantly  from  DLBCL  (Barraclough  A  et  al,  2021, 
Swerdlow  SH  et  al,  2008  WHO  classification  of  Tumours  of  Haematopoietic  and  Lymphoid  Tissues, 
Katzenberger OG et al, 2002; Koch K et al, 2016; Kikkeri NN et al, 2007). In the original MAA of Breyanzi, 
6  subjects  with  FL3B  were  treated  with  Breyanzi  across  all  the  registrational  studies:  long-lasting 
remissions  were  observed,  despite  failure  of  multiple  prior  lines  of  chemotherapy,  in  all  patients, 
suggesting  that  the  efficacy  of  Breyanzi  in  FL3B  was  at  least  similar  to  that  observed  in  DLBCL. 
Considering the biological and clinical similarities between DLBCL and FL3B and the rarity of FL3B, the 
available 3rd+ line data were considered sufficient to support the extrapolation of a positive B/R also to 
FL3B. In this respect, all the arguments supporting the extrapolation of the efficacy of Breyanzi in DLBCL 
to FL3B in 3rd+ line are equally acceptable in 2nd line, since no deviating outcomes are expected (e.g., 
the only subject with FL3B who received Breyanzi in study BCM-003 achieved a response that was still 
Assessment report

Page 115/186 
 
 
 
ongoing at the time of the data cut-off date). The inclusion of FL3B in the proposed 2nd line indication is, 
considered therefore, acceptable. 
In  contrast  to  what  observed  in  3rd+  line  LBCL  in  registrational  studies  017001  and  BCM-001,  high 
baseline LDH serum levels and SPD did not appear to have a negative impact on liso-cel EFS in 2nd line. 
A reduced treatment effect in PFS could be observed, however, in subjects with high baseline LDH serum 
levels (HR 0.949) and HGBL (HR 0.717): the actual relevance of these results is of difficult evaluation 
due to sample size constraints. It was shown by univariate and multivariate analyses (see the Quality 
section above) that a relationship could be observed a T cell attribute in one of the two cell components 
of liso-cel and clinical efficacy. The MAH specified that >93% of the variance in this T cell attribute in 2L 
LBCL patients was due to patient-intrinsic factors which is not unexpected due to the autologous nature 
of the product. Point estimates for mEFS still hinted to a persistent benefit with liso-cel, even when the 
highest quartile of this product attribute or optimal splitting values were considered. The effect of  this 
attribute  in  both  cell  components  on  patient  outcomes  was  investigated  also  in  the  control  arm.  The 
results  did  not  show  any  significant  correlation,  suggesting  that  this  T  cell  attribute  had  no  general 
prognostic  value  in  this  high-risk  2nd  line  setting.  It  was,  therefore,  confirmed  that  the  effect  of  this 
attribute could only be observed in the liso-cel arm, supporting a possible predictive value for liso-cel in 
this specific indication. However, the biological/clinical rationale of this correlation is unclear, and further 
validation  would  be  needed  to  conclude  on  its  possible  predictive  value.  However,  it  is  noted  that  a 
consistent trend towards clinical benefit with liso-cel vs. SOC could still be observed across the full range 
of values for this T cell attribute. This attribute is considered to deserve further characterisation in the 
setting of the 2L treatment with Breyanzi (see the Quality section). 
OS data  are  considered  of  value  to  understand  the  real  benefit  of  early  administration  of  liso-cel  vs. 
SOC in the targeted 2nd line high risk setting, especially considering the availability of anti-CD19 CAR T 
cell products in 3rd line. The provided OS data at the time of the 80% IA were, however, not sufficiently 
mature.  With  a  median  survival  follow-up  of  6  months,  only  37/184  (20%)  subjects  had  an  event  in 
study  BCM-001.  The  KM  curves  for  OS  started  diverging  after  approximately  3  months  to  remain 
separated; their informativeness after month 6 was, however, severely limited by elevated censoring. 
Updated  OS  data  were  submitted  from  the  primary  analysis  of  study  BCM-003  and  no  statistically 
significant effect could still be observed (the updated HR was 0.725 [95%CI 0.443, 1.183]). Study BCM-
003  was  not,  however,  sufficiently  powered  to  test  for  OS  superiority;  moreover,  the  impact  of  the 
limited number of events observed at the time of the data cut-off date (26% and 14% in the SOC and 
liso-cel arm, respectively) and of the high rate of cross-over from the control arm to liso-cel on survival 
analyses  was  not  negligible.  With  the  limits  of  the  “post-hoc”  nature  of  such  exercises,  the  MAH  also 
submitted additional sensitivity analyses adjusted for the confounding effect of subjects crossing over 
from SOC to liso-cel using the Accelerated Failure Time Model and the RPSFT model. Both models showed 
a significant and potentially clinically relevant effect of liso-cel on OS (HR 0.415 and 0.279, respectively). 
The actual value of these analyses is, however, limited, and their interpretation not straightforward when 
the availability in the EU clinical practice of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell products from the 3rd line onwards is 
taken into consideration. Based on these considerations, the available OS data must be interpreted with 
caution, yet it can be noted that no clear detrimental effect was observed with liso-cel. Conversely, a 
trend towards a possible OS benefit is described: this might be of relevance when the high rates of cross-
over to liso-cel are taken into consideration, and would support the importance of an earlier (i.e., 2nd 
line) introduction of anti-CD19 CAR T cell products in the treatment of high-risk R/R LBCLs. More mature 
data are needed, however, to draw definitive conclusions and the company has agreed to provide the 
final study report and the longer OS follow up for study JCAR017-BCM-003 in the post opinion setting. 
The analysis in the key secondary endpoint CRR by IRC highlighted how liso-cel was significantly more 
effective in inducing remission compared to SOC. A similar but somehow less remarkable effect was also 
observed in the CRR analysis by Investigator. ORR data were consistent with the CRR analysis, with an 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 116/186 
 
 
 
ORR by IRC of 47.8% and 85.9% in the SOC and liso-cel arms, respectively. Duration of CR data did 
not  show  significant  differences  across  study  arms,  confirming  the  importance  of  achieving  disease 
remission  to  aim  for  long-term  clinical  benefit.  Similar  results  could  be  observed  in  the  DoR  by  IRC 
analysis (HR 0.782, 95%CI 0.406, 1.505). 
Compared to the 80% IA, the updated CRR from the primary analysis of study BMC-003 was improved 
both in the SOC (CRR 43.5%) and liso-cel arms (73.9%): this is not unexpected since time might be 
needed  in  same  cases  to  reach  the  best  metabolic  response.  The  updated  median  DoCR  was  9.3 
months (95%CI 5.1, NE) in the control arm vs. NE (95%CI NE, NE) in the liso-cel arm. 
Results from the planned HR-QoL analyses were also submitted. The available data were restricted to 
the first 6 months of treatment since time points with less than 10 available PRO assessments were not 
evaluable. Median scores on the EORTC QLQ-C30 primary domains of interest and on the FACT-LymS at 
baseline  were  generally  similar  across  treatment  arms  and  in  line  with  those  reported  in  the  general 
population  (whenever  available).  Mean  changes  from  baseline  in  the  group-level  analysis  pointed 
towards  a  favourable  trend  with  liso-cel,  in  particular  in  terms  of  GH/QoL,  cognitive  functioning  and 
fatigue. A similar case could also be observed in the individual-level analysis, showing a trend towards 
a  greater  improvement  with  liso-cel  vs.  SOC  in  the  fatigue,  pain,  cognitive  functioning  and  GH/QoL 
domains of the EORTC QLQ-C30 tool and in the FACT-LymS. The reliability of these data is, however, 
reduced  by  the  limited  overall  compliance  rates  (~40%),  the  lack  of  blinding  and  the  absence  of 
multiplicity control. 
In line with the CAT/CHMP recommendations at the time of the initial MA for Breyanzi (i.e. to further 
characterise the efficacy and safety of Breyanzi in 3rd line), the MAH has also submitted efficacy data 
from subjects who crossed over to liso-cel after failing conventional salvage treatment in the SOC arm. 
Overall, response rates were lower and response duration shorter in the “cross-over” subgroup of study 
BCM-003 when compared to 3rd+ line data with liso-cel in registrational study 017001 (ORR 72.7%, CRR 
53.2%, mDoR 20.2 months, as reported in section 5.1 of the Breyanzi SmPC). This could be a reflection, 
however, of differences in study populations (e.g., enrolment in study BCM-003 was limited to high-risk 
patients, and rapidly progressing disease did not result in patient exclusion since liso-cel was already 
manufactured and available at the time of cross-over) and response assessment schedule.  
Efficacy  results  in  non-transplant  eligible  (NTE)  2nd  line  patients  from  supportive  studies  017006  and 
BCM-001 Cohort 2 
Eighty patients were deemed eligible to liso-cel in study 017006, 74/80 underwent leukapheresis and 61 
received liso-cel.. Baseline characteristics were still similar between the leukapheresed (n=74) and the 
treated (n=61) analysis sets, suggesting that the risk of selection bias was reduced.  
The median age in the overall population was 73.5 years (74 years in the treated set), with approximately 
43% of patients aged ≥75 years, as expected in the NTE setting. Although 27% of patients had a baseline 
ECOG score 2, ~24% had a reduced renal function (CrCl <60 ml/min) and approximately 47% of subjects 
had a HCT-CI score ≥3, which is predictive of a higher risk of non-relapse mortality in the allogeneic 
transplant setting, it is noted that 41/61 (67%) of subjects enrolled in study 017006 met 1 single protocol 
NTE criterion, and approximately 50% of subjects were included based on the sole age criterion. Further, 
only 28% and 5% of subjects in study 017006 met 2 or 3 NTE criteria, respectively, suggesting that the 
overall comorbidity burden still played a significant role in determining eligibility to CAR T-cell treatment 
in  the  NTE  setting.  To  what  extent  the  population  enrolled  in  study  017006  could  be  considered 
representative  of  the  overall  NTE  R/R  LBCL  population  was  uncertain,  since  the  clinical  and  logistic 
requirements of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy likely resulted in the selection of “fitter” NTE subjects, at 
the same time confirming, however, that the eligibility to CAR T-cell products is specific and distinct from 
ASCT eligibility.

With  respect  to  disease  characteristics,  DLBCL  NOS  and  HGBCL  were  the  most  prevalent  histologies 
(~55% and 30%, respectively). Although the study was not designed to explore liso-cel activity in the 
specific higher risk 2nd line setting targeted by this extension of indication, it is noted that refractory and 
early relapsed (i.e. <12 months) patients comprised ~75% of the whole population. 
Efficacy data were overall encouraging: treatment with liso-cel in study 017006 resulted in a clinically 
relevant anti-tumour activity. Subgroup analyses showed that the ORRs in the subsets of patients with 
refractory or early relapsed (≤12 months) disease that are targeted by this extension of the indication 
were overall consistent with the primary analysis, although these data should be interpreted with caution 
due to the limited sample size. Deep and durable responses could be observed in study 017006. Overall, 
these  data  suggested  the  possibility  of  long-term  disease  control  in  a  subset  of  responders.  In  the 
absence  of  a  randomised  control,  PFS,  EFS  and  OS  data  from  study  017006  were  of  difficult 
interpretation. 
Although  in  absolute  terms  the  point  estimations  for  ORR  and  CRR  were  lower  compared  to  those 
observed in pivotal study BCM-003 (85.9% and 66.3%, respectively), they were in line or ameliorative 
compared to those reported with liso-cel in the approved ≥3rd line indication (i.e., the ORR and CRR in 
the leukapheresed analysis set of pivotal study 017001 were 60.1% and 43%, respectively, as reported 
in  the  currently  approved  Breyanzi  SmPC).  Differences  in  study  populations  and  median  follow-up 
hampered indirect comparisons with other products/combinations approved in NTE R/R LBCLs, yet the 
magnitude,  depth  and  duration  of  response  observed  in  study  017006  (especially  in  subjects  who 
achieved  a  CR)  could  still  be  considered  of  relevance  when  contextualized  in  the  current  treatment 
framework. 
Overall, 32 subjects underwent leukapheresis and 27 (~84%) received liso-cel in study BCM-001 Cohort 
2; Baseline characteristics were similar between the leukapheresed (n=32) and liso-cel treated (n=27) 
analysis sets, indicating a limited risk of selection bias.  
Consistently with study 017006, the median age in Cohort 2 was 74 years (min. 49, max 81 years), and 
a slight prevalence of male patients could be observed. Although approximately 33% of patients had an 
ECOG  PS  score  of  2,  most  patients  (59%)  met  1  single  NTE  protocol  criterion  (most  commonly  age: 
48%).  As  per  study  017006,  it  is  uncertain  whether  or  to  what  extent  patients  in  Cohort  2  could  be 
considered  representative  of  the  overall  NTE  R/R  LBCL  population.  With  respect  to  disease 
characteristics,  DLBCL  NOS  and  HGBCL  were  the  most  prevalent  histologies  (~66%  and  30%  of  the 
study  population,  respectively),  most  patients  (60%)  had  high  aaIPI  score  at  screening,  and 
approximately 75% of subjects were primary refractory or experienced early (≤12 months) relapse after 
frontline  immunochemotherapy.  Overall,  it  can  be  agreed  that  the  patients  treated  in  study  BCM-001 
Cohort 2 were representative of a higher risk 2nd line setting. 
Efficacy results in Cohort 2 were generally less favourable, yet still in line with those observed in study 
017006, as indicated by the largely overlapping confidence intervals. Subgroup analyses were hampered 
by  limited  numbers.  Due  to  the  short  follow-up  (11.1  months),  duration  of  response  data  had  to  be 
interpreted  with  caution,  and  an  initial  plateau  in  the  KM  plots  suggested  the  possibility  of  long-term 
disease  control  in  a  subgroup.  The  interpretation  of  survival  data  from  study  BCM-001  Cohort  2  was 
hampered by the limited follow-up and by the absence of a randomised control. 
Overall, results from supportive studies 017006 and BCM-001 Cohort 2 provided supplementary evidence 
of the activity of Breyanzi in NTE patients. Short follow-up did not allow, however, for the characterisation 
of  long-term  efficacy  in  this  setting.  The  MAH  agreed  to  submit  updated  data  from  the  final  CSR  of 
studies 017006 and BCM-001 Cohort 2 post approval.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The current salvage strategy in 2nd line LBCLs is aimed at achieving high remission rates to maximize 
clinical  benefit  from  HDCT  and  ASCT,  especially  in  terms  of  long-term  disease  control.  The  available 
efficacy  data  from  pivotal  study  BCM-003  showed  how,  in  the  targeted  high-risk  (yet  still  curative) 
setting, liso-cel was able to induce a higher CRR compared to SOC, which resulted in a clinically relevant 
and statistically significant prolongation of EFS and PFS.  
No  significant  differences  in  terms  of  treatment  effects  were  observed  across  the  LBCL  histologies 
included in the claimed indication. Although low numbers did not allow specific efficacy evaluations in 
rarer  subgroups  (e.g.  PMBCL,  FL3B),  homogeneity  in  treatment  response  and  consistent  CD19 
expression across all the considered histologies support the extrapolation of a similar clinical benefit with 
Breyanzi in the broad claimed indication. Further data in rare LBCL variants will be collected in the post-
approval setting.  
A consistent high anti-tumour activity could also be observed across supportive studies, indicating the 
possibility to achieve deep and durable responses also in a frailer (NTE), high risk patient population that 
received Breyanzi as second line treatment, and further supporting the broad claimed indication. More 
mature data from studies 017006 and BCM-001 Cohort 2 will be provided post approval.  
The efficacy of Breyanzi in the target population is considered demonstrated. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
On 04-Apr-2022, the European Commission (EC) granted a marketing authorization for Breyanzi (liso-
cel; JCAR017) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and follicular lymphoma grade 
3B (FL3B), after two or more lines of systemic therapy. With respect to safety, Breyanzi was generally 
well tolerated in patients with 3L+ large B-cell lymphoma, with an overall toxicity profile in line with that 
of  the  approved  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  products.  The  important  identified  risks  and  the  potential  risks 
identified for Breyanzi were similar to those identified for this product class. Adverse events of CRS and 
NT  were  generally  low-grade  and  resolved.  Importantly,  low  rate  of  ≥  Grade  3  CRS  occurred  in  the 
context of overall use of tocilizumab and/or corticosteroid in less than one-quarter of all patients treated 
with  JCAR017.  Despite  evidence  was  limited  for  some  less  common  large  B-cell  lymphoma  subtypes 
including  R/R  FL3B  and  R/R  PMBCL,  as  well  as  for  other  clinically  relevant  subgroups  (ECOG  PS  ≥2; 
secondary CNS lymphoma; DLBCL post-allo HSCT), due to the small number of patients included, overall 
the JCAR017 activity was consistent across these subgroups. Data from Study BCM-001 were considered 
of  particular  relevance  for  EU  patients,  due  to  the  same  manufacturing  process  as  proposed  for 
commercial use in the EU. When additional patients were enrolled in Study BCM-001 (n= 36, Cohort 1), 
more  comparable  baseline  characteristics  were  observed  across  the  pivotal  studies.  Overall,  the 
incidence of AEs and AESIs in the treatment-emergent (Day 1 to Day 90) and post-treatment emergent 
(Day 91 to end of Study) periods was generally similar, despite higher Grade ≥ 3 liso-cel-related TEAEs 
in  Study  BCM-001  compared  with  Study  017001,  mainly  driven  by  higher  incidences  of  neutropenia, 
anemia and febrile neutropenia, and no notable difference in the incidence of individual AESIs. 
For this proposed indication, the safety evaluation is primarily based on the studies included in the table 
below:

Study BCM-003 
Study  BCM-003  is  an  ongoing  randomized,  open-label,  parallel-group,  Phase  3  multicenter  trial  to 
determine  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  liso-cel  in  adult  subjects  with  LBCL  after  failure  of  anti-CD20 
antibody and anthracycline containing first-line (1L) immunochemotherapy, compared with the salvage 
immunochemotherapy  strategy.  Approximately  184  subjects  with  high  risk  DLBCL,  HGBCL,  PMBCL,  T 
cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRBCL), and FL3B were - randomized to receive either:  
Arm  A  (SOC  arm,  n=92):  3  cycles  of  salvage  immunochemotherapy.  Responding  subjects  were 
expected to proceed to HDCT and autologous HSCT. (1/92 subjects in the SOC arm withdrew consent 
before receiving treatment and was not included in the safety analysis set) 
Arm B (liso-cel arm, n= 92): LDC followed by liso-cel infusion (where LDC was preceded by bridging 
therapy,  if  needed).  Of  the  92  randomized  subjects  in  the  liso-cel  arm,  89  subjects  received  liso-cel 
infusion (Table 52).

•  Arm A (SOC arm) 
Standard of Care Salvage Therapy  
Among  the  91  treated  subjects  in  the  SOC  arm,  the  most  frequently  used  starting  regimen  of  SOC 
salvage  therapy  regimen  was  rituximab-ifosphamide,  carboplatin  and  etoposide  regimen  (R-ICE) 
(63.7%). Twelve (13.2%) subjects switched SOC salvage therapy. The most frequently reported reason 
to switch SOC salvage therapy was suboptimal response (5 subjects [5.5%]) followed by AE (4 subjects 
[4.4%]). Of the 91 subjects who received SOC salvage therapy, 50 (54.9%) met the criteria for crossover 
and were approved to crossover to receive liso-cel. 
High Dose Chemotherapy and HSCT 
Out  of  91  subjects  who  received  SOC  salvage  therapy,  48  (52.7%)  discontinued  treatment  before 
starting HDCT. Of those, 40 discontinued before starting HDCT because they were approved to crossover 
to liso-cel before HDCT: 5 after completion of SOC Cycle 1, 13 after completion of SOC Cycle 2, and 22 
after completion of SOC Cycle 3. All 43 subjects who started HDCT went on to receive all HDCT agents 
(Table 3). A total of 42 (46.2%) subjects in the SOC arm received HSCT after HDCT. Additionally, one 
subject received the last dose of HDCT on the date of the cut-off for the study and was expected to go 
on to receive HSCT after the data cut-off.

Set) 
•  Arm B (liso-cel arm) 
Bridging Therapy  
A  total  of  58  (63.0%)  subjects  received  bridging  therapy  to  stabilize  their  disease  during  liso-cel 
manufacturing:  28  (30.4%)  received  it  due  to  high  tumor  burden  and  23  (25.0%)  due  to  rapid 
progression.  The  most  frequently  used  bridging  therapy  was  R-ICE  (Table  54).  Five  patients  received 
additional cycles of bridging therapy due to delays related to the contamination issue (4 subjects) and 
due to rapid disease progression (1 subject). Nine subjects were PET-negative after receiving bridging 
therapy at pre-LDC assessment.

Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy  
Two subjects in the Safety Analysis Set discontinued before starting LDC. All 90 subjects in the Safety 
Analysis Set who received LDC received all LDC agents (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine); 89 (96.7%) 
went on to receive liso-cel and 1 (1.1%) received a nonconforming product. The median time from the 
last dose of LDC to liso-cel infusion was 4.0 days. 
Liso-cel  
A total of 89 (96.7%) subjects in the Safety Analysis Set received liso-cel. The median total liso-cel dose 
was 99.92 x 106 cells; the median CD8 and CD4 doses were 49.97 × 106 cells and 49.89 × 106 cells, 
respectively  (Table  55).  One  (1.1%)  subject  received  a  nonconforming  product  because  the  CD4 
component purity was out of specifications (OOS).

Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 124/186 
 
 
 
 
Subjects who Crossed Over to Liso-cel  
Of the 47 subjects who were approved to crossover by the Medical Monitor after IRC confirmation of a 
qualifying  event  and  included  in  the  safety  analysis  set,  46  (97.9%)  received  liso-cel  and  1  (2.1%) 
received a nonconforming product. Among these subjects, the median total liso-cel dose was 99.88 x 
106 cells. One subject received a nonconforming product because the CD4 component purity was OOS. 
Manufacturing Time and Manufacturing Failure (Intent-to-treat Analysis Set)  
The median time from leukapheresis to liso-cel product availability was 26.0 days (range: 19 to 84 days) 
(Table 56). 
Table 56. Manufacturing Time (Intent-to-treat Analysis Set) 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 125/186 
 
 
 
 
 
While most subjects received liso-cel within this time period, 4 subjects in the liso-cel arm had delayed 
liso-cel product availability due to a contamination issue.  
There were 4 manufacturing failures in total: 2 in the liso-cel arm and 2 in the SOC arm post crossover: 
•  One subject each in the liso-cel arm and the SOC arm post-crossover received liso-cel product 
that was determined to be nonconforming because the purity of the CD4 component was OOS  
• 
• 
The  third  subject  was  randomized  to  the  liso-cel  arm  but  never  received  liso-cel.  The  subject 
discontinued treatment on Day 26 due to study drug manufacturing failure  
The fourth subject was randomized to the SOC arm and was found to have a complete response 
64 days after randomization and subsequently went on to receive HDCT. While the subject never 
requested  to  crossover  to  liso-cel,  the  contamination  issue  described  above  did  affect  the 
subject’s apheresis material but no repeated leukapheresis was done due to the subject’s death 
on Day 94. 
On study follow up time 
In the liso-cel-treated analysis set of Study BCM-003, median on-study follow up time was 5.32 months 
(range  1.0,  18.0  months).  Among  the  89  liso-cel-treated  subjects  of  Study  BCM-003,  38  (42.7%) 
subjects  had  ≥  6  months  of  follow-up,  32  (36.0%)  subjects  had  ≥  9  months  follow-up,  14  (15.7%) 
subjects had ≥ 12 months of follow up, and no subjects had ≥ 24 months of follow-up. Total on study 
follow up time was 54.2 patient years by the data cut-off. For this interim analysis, the median follow-
up (time from liso-cel infusion to the last date known alive) for subjects in the SOC arm who crossed-
over to liso-cel was 4.14 months and the minimum follow-up was 0.4 months. 
In the Pooled 2L Treated Set and Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set, median on-study follow up time was 
7.10 months (range 1.0, 26.5 months) and 11.55 months (range 0.2, 45.2 months), respectively.  
As requested, additional follow-up is now available from Study BCM-003 (data cut-off date of 13-May-
2022)  and  BCM-001  (2L  LBCL  Cohort  2  and  3L+  LBCL  Cohorts  1,  3,  and  7)  (data  cut-off  date  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023

02-Mar-2022).  The  follow-up  time  for  Study  BCM-003  increased  from  a  median  of  5.32  months  to  a 
median of 16.43 months, whereas the median follow-up for 2L total and 3L+ total was 15.64 and 11.40 
months, respectively. 
Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population in Study BCM-003 
For details on demographic and other characteristics of Study Population see the Efficacy section above. 
Pooled Safety Analyses in 2L and 3L+ Populations 
Safety data from time of liso-cel infusion to liso-cel-treated 2L LBCL subjects from Study BCM-003 liso-
cel arm as well as other 2L studies (Study 017006, and Study BCM-001 [Cohort 2]) (Pooled 2L LBCL 
Treated  Set,  n=177)  and  the  marketed  indication  of  3L+  LBCL  (Study  017001  [DLBCL  Cohort], 
Study BCM-001 [Cohorts 1, 3, and 7], Study 017007, and Study BCM-002) (Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated 
Set, n=428) were pooled to allow for a side-by-side comparison. 
Additional pooled safety analyses from time of liso-cel infusion were conducted for the subset of subjects 
who received a dose of liso-cel within the dose range of 44 to 120 × 106 CAR+ viable T cells in the Pooled 
2L and Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Sets (i.e., the Modified Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set [n= 177] and 
Modified Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set [n= 381], respectively). 
Adverse events  
Summary of adverse events 
The overall incidences of TEAEs and SAEs were similar for subjects in the liso-cel and SOC arms, however 
the AE profiles were different but in line with the respective mechanism of action for liso-cel and SOC.

Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) 
A TEAE was defined as an AE that started any time from initiation of JCAR017 administration through 
and including 90 days following the final cycle (i.e., final infusion) of JCAR017 (or occurring within 90 
days after last dose of immunochemotherapy or HDCT in SOC arm). Any AE occurring after the initiation 
of subsequent anticancer therapy or JCAR017 retreatment was not considered as a TEAE. 
The  overall  frequency  of  any  grade  TEAEs  reported  in  the  liso-cel  arm  (92  [100%]  subjects)  was 
comparable to that reported in the SOC arm (90 [98.9%] subjects).

In the liso-cel arm, 85 (92.4%) subjects experienced at least 1 Grade 3-4 TEAE with the most frequently 
occurring Grade 3-4 TEAEs reported in the Blood and lymphatic system disorders system organ class. 
Similarly, in the SOC arm, 79 (86.8%) subjects experienced at least 1 Grade 3-4 TEAE.

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
AESIs included the following categories: CRS, neurologic toxicity immune effector cell-associated events 
(ie,  iiNT),  cytopenia  and  prolonged  cytopenia,  TLS,  MAS,  Grade  ≥  3  infection,  and  second  primary 
malignancies. As expected, the frequency of AESIs was greater in the liso-cel arm than in the SOC arm. 
Table 66. Treatment-emergent Adverse Events of Special Interest/Selected Adverse Events 
by Category (Safety Analysis Set) 
Cytokine Release Syndrome 
In the liso-cel arm, 45 (48.9%) subjects experienced at least one event of cytokine release syndrome 
with a median time to onset of 5.0 days (range 1 to 63 days) (Table 67). The median time to resolution 
as of the data cut-off date of 4.0 days (range 1 to 16 days).  No subject had ongoing CRS at time of 
death. Only 1 subject in the liso-cel arm reported Grade ≥ 3 CRS, graded according to the Lee criteria 
(Lee, 2014), with a reported symptom of hypertransaminasaemia (Grade 3) with onset 9.0 days after 
the start of liso-cel infusion and resolution within 2.0 days. No CRS events of Grade 4 or 5 were reported. 
In  the  liso-cel  arm,  the  3  most  frequently  reported  symptoms  of  CRS  were  pyrexia  (44  [47.8%] 
subjects), hypotension (9 [9.8%] subjects), and chills and headache (both reported in 4 [4.3%] subjects)

Cytopenia and Prolonged Cytopenia  
Prolonged cytopenia was determined by laboratory-based assessment at 35 days after liso-cel infusion, 
for the liso-cel arm, or 35 days after the start of the last cycle of chemotherapy, including HDCT, for the 
SOC arm. In the liso-cel arm, 40 (43.5%) subjects had Grade ≥ 3 laboratory-based prolonged cytopenia 
(vs.  3,  3.3%  subjects  in  the  SOC  arm),  34  (37.0%)  subjects  had  Grade  ≥  3  decreased  neutrophils 
(neutropenia) (vs. 2, 2.2% in the SOC arm), 34 (37.0%) subjects had Grade ≥ 3 decreased platelets 
(thrombocytopenia)  (vs.  0  in  the  SOC  arm),  and  11  (12.0%)  subjects  had  Grade  ≥  3  decreased 
hemoglobin (anemia) (vs. 1, 1.1% in the SOC arm).

Tumor Lysis Syndrome was reported in 2 (2.2%) subjects in the SOC arm. No events were reported 
in the liso-cel arm. 
Macrophage  activation  syndrome  was  reported  in  1  (1.1%)  subject  in  the  liso-cel  arm  who 
experienced  a  Grade  2  event  of  hemophagocytic  lymphohistiocytosis  with  onset  on  Day  42  (data  not 
shown).  The  event  was  reported  as  resolved  on  Day  47  without  treatment,  although  the  event  was 
concurrent  with  CRS  and the  subject  received  treatment  for CRS.  No  event of  macrophage  activation 
syndrome was reported in the SOC arm.  
Grade  ≥  3  infections  were  reported  in  14  (15.2%)  subjects  in  the  liso-cel  arm  and  in  19  (20.9%) 
subjects in the SOC arm (data not shown).  
Second primary malignancy only occurred in 1 subject in the SOC arm (Kaposi’s sarcoma), which was 
reported as a post-treatment AE (data not shown).

Clinical Chemistry Values Over Time 
In the SOC arm, most serum chemistry parameters remained stable over time. Alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) fluctuated by visit, but there was no consistent trend over 
time. Lactate dehydrogenase appeared to gradually decline after the baseline visit (data not shown).  
In the liso-cel arm most serum chemistry parameters remained stable over time (data not shown). ALT, 
AST, and bilirubin remained stable, with the exception of a spike at EOS visit. Only a single subject had 
these values reported at  an EOS visit, and this subject’s EOS visit occurred  after disease progression 
(data not shown). 
Coagulation Values Over Time 
In the SOC arm, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, and international normalized 
ratio (INR) remained stable over time, while D-dimer increased initially but returned to normal range by 
Day 15 (data not shown).  
Overall, in the liso-cel arm, aPTT, INR, and D-dimer remained stable over time while fibrinogen remained 
stable until Day 36, and then declined thereafter (data not shown). 
Vital Signs 
There were no notable abnormalities in vital signs aside from those findings associated with CRS and 
iiNT. 
Safety in special populations 
In Study BCM-003, there were no notable differences in the subgroup analyses by age, sex, race, and 
NHL subtype (data not shown).

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Liso-cel is a cellular product that is generally administered as a one-time infusion. Because it is a cellular 
product,  it  is  not  cleared  by  the  usual  mechanisms  that  apply  to  small  molecules  or  antibodies.  No 
controlled clinical studies have been performed to directly address drug interactions with liso-cel. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
As of the data cutoff date for Study BCM-003, no pregnancies have been reported. 
Risk Summary 
There  is  no  information  regarding  liso-cel  treatment  of  pregnant  women.  No  animal  reproductive  and 
development toxicity studies have been conducted with liso-cel to evaluate whether it can cause fetal 
harm when administered to a pregnant female.  
It is not known whether liso-cel has the potential to be transferred to the fetus. Based on the liso-cel 
mechanism of action, the transduced cells could theoretically cross the placenta and cause fetal B-cell 
lymphocytopenia and worsen the temporary hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy. Therefore, liso-cel is 
not recommended in women who are pregnant, and pregnancy after liso-cel infusion should be discussed 
with the treating physician. 
Clinical Considerations 
Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions 
Pregnant women who have received liso-cel may have hypogammaglobulinemia. Immunoglobulin levels 
and B-cells in newborns of mothers treated with liso-cel should be assessed. 
Lactation 
Risk Summary 
There is no information regarding the presence of liso-cel in human milk, effects on the breastfed infant, 
or effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be weighed 
against the mother’s clinical need for liso-cel and potential adverse effects for the infant from liso-cel, 
breastfeeding, and the underlying maternal condition. 
Overdose 
Overdose, as defined for Study BCM-003, can apply to the salvage immunochemotherapy regimen and 
HDCT, fludarabine (intravenous [IV]), cyclophosphamide (IV) or liso-cel (IV). On a per-dose basis, an 
overdose was defined as the following amount over the protocol-specified dose of these drug(s) assigned 
to a given subject, regardless of any associated AEs or sequelae: 
• 
• 
IV: ≥ 10% over the protocol-specified dose 
Per os (PO, oral): any amount over the protocol-specified dose 
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose was defined as anything more frequent than the protocol 
required schedule or frequency. On an infusion rate basis, an overdose was defined as any rate faster 
than the protocol-specified infusion time reflected as infusion time (± 50%). 
In Study BCM-003, overdoses (defined as at least 10% over the protocol-defined dose) of HDCT occurred 
in  4  subjects  in  the  SOC  arm  and  involved  cytarabine  in  4  subjects  and  etoposide  in  2  subjects.  No 
incident of HDCT overdose resulted in any adverse events. 
Drug Abuse 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 151/186 
 
 
 
No new information. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
No cases of withdrawal symptoms related to liso-cel have been reported during human clinical trials. 
Effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability 
Breyanzi can have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Due to the potential for 
neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients receiving Breyanzi should refrain 
from driving or operating heavy or potentially dangerous machines for at least 8 weeks after Breyanzi 
infusion. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  Study  BCM-003,  in  the  liso-cel  arm,  no  subjects  had  TEAEs  that  led  to  withdrawal  of  study  drug 
(including bridging therapy and LDC; data not shown). As liso-cel was administered as a single dose for 
all subjects and follow-up continued for subjects regardless of AEs, this analysis does not permit a fair 
comparison with the SOC arm. In the SOC arm, 4 (4.4%) subjects had TEAEs that led to withdrawal of 
any study drug (see Table below). No events were reported in more than one subject. No subjects in the 
SOC arm post-crossover set had TEAEs leading to withdrawal of any study treatment.

Safety Analyses in the Pooled 2L and Pooled 3L+ Populations 
Safety data from the time of liso-cel infusion for Study BCM-003 liso-cel arm (i.e., the liso-cel-treated 
analysis  set  from  time  of  infusion,  n=  89)  were  presented  individually  and  within  the  context  of  the 
Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set (n= 177), as well as side-by-side with safety data from the Pooled 3L+ LBCL 
Treated  Set  (n=  428)  (Table  73).  In  the  liso-cel-treated  analysis  set  of  Study  BCM-003  (n=  89),  56 
(62.9%) subjects received anticancer treatment for disease control. In the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set 
(n= 177) and the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set (n= 428), subjects receiving anticancer treatment for 
disease control were 111 (62.7%) and 256 (59.8%), respectively (Summary of clinical safety, data not

shown).  Regarding  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy,  in  the  liso-cel-treated  analysis  set  of  Study  BCM-
003 87.6% subjects received the full specified dose of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with no missing 
doses,  whereas  in  the  Pooled  2L  Treated  Set  and  3L+  LBCL  Treated  Set,  most  subjects  (74.0%  and 
86.2%,  respectively)  received  the  full  specified  dose  of  fludarabine  and  cyclophosphamide  with  no 
missing doses (data not shown). In the liso-cel-treated analysis set of Study BCM-003, the median total 
liso-cel dose was 99.9 × 106 cells; the median CD8 and CD4 doses were 50.0 × 106 cells and 49.9 × 106 
cells, respectively.  
In the Pooled 2L Treated Set and Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set, the median total liso-cel dose was 99.9 
× 106 and 94.3 × 106 cells, respectively. In the Pooled 2L Treated Set, the median CD8 and CD4 doses 
were 49.9 × 106 cells and 49.9 × 106 cells, respectively, whereas in the Pooled 3L+ Treated Set, the 
median CD8 and CD4 doses were 47.5 × 106 cells and 47.7 × 106 cells, respectively.  
In  the  liso-cel-treated  analysis  set  of  Study  BCM-003,  the  median  on-study  follow  up  time  was  5.32 
months (range 1.0, 18.0 months). Among the 89 liso-cel-treated subjects of Study BCM-003, 38 (42.7%) 
subjects  had  ≥  6  months  of  follow-up,  32  (36.0%)  subjects  had  ≥  9  months  follow-up,  14  (15.7%) 
subjects had ≥ 12 months of follow up, and no subjects had ≥ 24 months of follow-up. Total on study 
follow up time was 54.2 patient years by the data cut-off. In the Pooled 2L Treated Set and Pooled 3L+ 
LBCL Treated Set, median on-study follow up time was 7.10 months (range 1.0, 26.5 months) and 11.55 
months (range 0.2, 45.2 months), respectively.

Cytokine release syndrome is graded based on the Lee grading criteria. Other AEs are graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.03. The most severe grade is used for AEs that occur more than once in an individual subject during the period. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs occurring from the date of the initial liso-cel infusion (Day 1) through and including 90 days 
following the final cycle of liso-cel infusion (i.e., last dose for Study 017001; first dose for other studies). Any AE occurring after the initiation of subsequent 
anticancer therapy or liso-cel retreatment will not be considered as TEAE. 
AEs are coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 23.0. A subject is counted only once for multiple events within preferred 
term/system organ class.

Summary of Results from Pooled Safety Analyses 
Treatment-emergent AEs 
The overall frequency of any grade TEAEs reported in the liso-cel-treated analysis set of Study BCM-003 
(87 [97.8%] subjects) was comparable to that reported in the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set (172 [97.2%] 
subjects)  and  the  Pooled  3L+  LBCL  Treated  Set  (426  [99.5%]  subjects).  The  most  common  adverse

reactions of any grade were neutropenia (76%), anemia (57%), thrombocytopenia (53%), CRS (49%), 
and headache (32%). 
Grade 3 or Higher TEAEs 
The overall frequency of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs reported in the liso-cel-treated analysis set of Study 
BCM-003  (79  [88.8%]  subjects)  was  comparable  to  that  reported  in  the  Pooled  2L  LBCL  Treated  Set 
(152 [85.9%] subjects) and the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set (340 [79.4%] subjects). The most common 
Grade 3 
or 
higher 
adverse 
reactions 
included 
neutropenia (74%), 
anemia (45%), 
thrombocytopenia (45%),  lymphopenia (20%),  leukopenia (12%),  febrile  neutropenia (7%),  infection 
with an unspecified pathogen (6%), and bacterial infections (6%). 
Treatment-emergent AEs Related to Liso-cel 
The overall frequency of liso-cel related TEAEs reported in the liso-cel-treated analysis set of Study BCM-
003 (77 [86.5%] subjects) was comparable with that reported in the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set (149 
[84.2%] subjects), but it was slightly higher than that reported in the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set (334 
[78.0%] subjects) (see Table below). 
Table 76. Liso-cel-related TEAEs by System Organ Class and Preferred Term Occurring in ≥ 
10% of Subjects in either Pooled 2L LBCL or Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set 
Death 
In the liso-cel-treated analysis set of Study BCM-003, 11 (12.4%) subjects died any time after first liso-
cel infusion. In comparison, 40 (22.6%) subjects in the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set and 200 (46.7%) 
subjects in the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set died any time after first liso-cel infusion. 
One  (1.1%)  subject  in  the  liso-cel-treated  analysis  set  of  Study  BCM-003  died  due  to  a  TEAE.  In 
comparison, 4 (2.3%) subjects in the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set and 11 (2.6%) subjects in the Pooled 
3L+ LBCL Treated Set died due to a TEAE.

Serious Adverse Events 
Overall,  34  (38.2%)  subjects  in  the  liso-cel-treated  analysis  set  of  Study  BCM-003  reported  serious 
TEAEs.  In  comparison,  serious  TEAEs  were  reported  by  61  (34.5%)  subjects  in  the  Pooled  2L  LBCL 
Treated Set and 199 (46.5%) subjects in the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set. The most frequently reported 
serious  TEAE  in  both  pooled  groups  was  CRS  (13.5%  in  BCM-003  Arm  B  vs.  12.4%  in  Pooled  2L  vs. 
18.5%  in  Pooled  3L+  LBCL).  Other  most  common  serious  adverse  reactions  in  BCM-003  were 
neutropenia  (7%),  pyrexia  (5%),  bacterial  infectious  disorders  (5%),  infection  with  an  unspecified 
pathogen  (5%),  thrombocytopenia  (3%),  febrile  neutropenia  (3%),  aphasia  (2%),  anemia  (2%), 
headache (2%), pulmonary embolism (2%), encephalopathy (1%), and tremor (1%). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Overall, similar frequencies of AESIs were reported in the liso-cel-treated analysis set of Study BCM-003, 
the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, and the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set. The majority of reported AESIs 
were mild to moderate in severity. The most frequently occurring AESIs were cytokine release syndrome 
and iiNT.

Subgroups 
Due to the limitation of the small sample size for certain subgroups in the liso-cel-treated analysis set of 
Study BCM-003, the MAH showed data focused on subgroup analyses in the Pooled 2L Treated Set, with 
comparisons with that of the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set under each subgroup category.  
Age 
In the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, safety was generally similar among subjects < 65 years (n= 62), ≥ 
65 to < 70 years (n= 23), ≥ 70 to < 75 years (n= 51), and ≥ 75 to < 85 years (n= 41). There were no 
subjects  ≥  85  years  in  the  Pooled  2L  LBCL  Treated  Set.  A  higher  frequency  of  iiNT  was  reported  in 
subjects ≥ 75 to < 85 years (31.7%) compared with subjects < 65 years (9.7%). 
Sex, Ethnicity, and Race 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 158/186 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No  clinically  relevant  differences  were  noted  between  sex,  race,  or  ethnicity  subgroups  for  subjects 
treated with liso-cel in the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, which was consistent with what was observed in 
the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set. 
Region 
In the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, TEAEs and AESIs were generally similar in subjects from the US (n= 
117) and the EU (n= 53), which was consistent with what was observed in the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated 
Set. The number of subjects from Japan included in the Pooled 2L Treated Set (n= 7) was too small to 
conclude on the differences in the occurrence of AEs.  
LDH Prior to LDC 
In the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, TEAEs and AESIs were generally similar in subjects with LDH ≥ 500 
U/L (n= 24) and those with LDH < 500 U/L (n= 153). The results in the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set 
were similar to what was observed in the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set.  
SPD Prior to LDC 
In the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, TEAEs and AESIs were generally similar in subjects with SPD < 50 
cm2 (n= 151) and those with SPD ≥ 50 cm2 (n= 20). In the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, the frequency 
of  CRS was higher  in  subjects  with  SPD  ≥  50  cm2 (75.0%)  compared  with  those  with  SPD  <  50  cm2 
(41.1%), which was consistent with what was observed in the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set. 
Histology 
In the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, safety was generally similar across subjects with disease histology 
DLBCL NOS de novo (n= 103), DLBCL tiNHL (including tFL) (n= 15), HGL (HGBCL) (n= 47), and PMBCL 
(n= 8). The number of subjects with disease histology FL3B (n= 3) and T cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell 
lymphoma (HRBCL) (n= 1) was too small to draw meaningful conclusions. In the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated 
Set,  a  lower  frequency  of  CRS  was  noted  in  subjects  with  disease  histology  DLBCL  tiNHL  (26.7%) 
compared with HGL (HGBCL) (48.9%) and PMBCL (62.5%). 
While  the  results  across  the  disease  histology  subgroups  in  the  Pooled  2L  LBCL  Treated  Set  were 
generally  consistent  with  what  was  observed  in  the  Pooled  3L+  LBCL  Treated  Set,  the  following 
differences in AESIs were observed: 
•  A lower frequency of CRS in subjects with disease histology DLBCL tiNHL in the Pooled 
2L LBCL Treated Set (26.7%) compared with the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set (42.5%). 
•  A lower frequency of iiNT in subjects with disease histology HGL (HGBCL) in the Pooled 
2L LBCL Treated Set (14.9%) compared with the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set (28.8%). 
•  A lower frequency of iiNT (12.5%) and a higher frequency of CRS (62.5%) in subjects 
with disease histology PMBCL in the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, compared with that of 
the  Pooled  3L+  LBCL  Treated  Set  (33.3%  for  iiNT  and  46.7%  for  CRS).  However, 
interpretation is limited by the relatively small number of subjects with disease histology 
PMBCL in the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set (n= 8).  
Baseline CRP 
In the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, no differences in TEAEs and AESIs were observed in subjects with 
CRP < 20 mg/L (n= 100) and those with CRP ≥ 20 mg/L (n= 39), which was consistent with what was 
observed in the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set.  
When comparing safety between the Pooled 2L and Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Sets, a higher frequency 
of CRS was reported in the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set (47.0%) compared with the Pooled 3L+ LBCL 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 159/186 
 
 
 
Treated Set (31.5%) in subjects with CRP < 20 mg/L, while a lower frequency of iiNT was reported in 
the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set (15.4%) compared with the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set (34.8%) in 
subjects with CRP ≥ 20 mg/L. 
Systemic Bridging Therapy 
In  the  Pooled  2L  LBCL  Treated  Set,  the  frequency  of  TEAEs  and  AESIs  was  similar  in  subjects  who 
received systemic bridging therapy (n= 111) and in those who did not receive bridging therapy (n= 66). 
Screening ECOG 
In  the  Pooled  2L  LBCL  Treated  Set,  the  frequency  of  TEAEs  and  AESIs  was  similar  in  subjects  with 
Screening ECOG PS of 0 (n= 74), 1 (n= 78), and 2 (n= 25). 
Creatinine Clearance 
In the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, the frequencies of TEAEs and AESIs were similar in subjects with 
CrCl < 60 mL/min (n= 24) compared to subjects with CrCl ≥ 60 mL/min (n= 149), which was consistent 
with what was observed in the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set. 
Screening LVEF 
In  the  Pooled  2L  LBCL  Treated  Set,  the  number  of  subjects  with  LVEF  <  50%  was  too  small  to  draw 
meaningful conclusions (n= 5). In subjects with LVEF ≥ 50%, rates of TEAEs and AESIs were similar in 
the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set compared to the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set. 
Refractory Status and CNS Lymphoma Involvement 
In  the  Pooled  2L  LBCL  Treated  Set,  the  frequency  of  TEAEs  and  AESIs  were  similar  in  subjects  with 
refractory status (n= 115) compared with subjects with relapsed status (n= 62) and the results were 
similar to those observed in the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set.  
In the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, the number of subjects with CNS lymphoma involvement was too 
small to draw meaningful conclusions (n= 2). 
Pre-Leukapheresis ALC 
In  the  Pooled  2L  LBCL  Treated  Set,  the  numbers  of  subjects  with  pre-leukapheresis  ALC  <  0.3 × 109 
cells/L  (n=  7)  and  with  pre-leukapheresis  ALC  unknown  (n= 1)  were  too  small  to  draw  any  clinically 
meaningful conclusion. In subjects with pre-leukapheresis ALC ≥ 0.3 × 109 cells/L, rates of TEAEs and 
AESIs were similar in the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set compared to the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set. 
Screening HCT-CI 
In the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, no clear differences in TEAEs and AESIs were identified in subjects 
with HCT-CI < 3 (n= 117) and those with HCT-CI ≥ 3 (n= 60). 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Hematology and chemistry laboratory abnormalities were similar in the liso-cel-treated analysis set of 
Study BCM-003, the Pooled 2L and Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Sets. 
Safety Analyses in the Modified Pooled 2L and Pooled 3L+ Populations 
Additional pooled safety analyses from time of liso-cel infusion were conducted for the subset of subjects 
who received a dose of liso-cel within the dose range of 44 to 120 × 106 CAR+ viable T cells in the Pooled 
2L  and  Pooled  3L+  LBCL  Treated  Sets  (i.e.,  the  Modified  Pooled  2L  LBCL  Treated  Set  [n=  177]  and 
Modified  Pooled  3L+  LBCL  Treated  Set  [n=  381],  respectively).  As  all  subjects  in  the  Pooled  2L  LBCL 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 160/186 
 
 
 
Treated Set (n= 177) received a dose of liso-cel within the above dose range, these 177 subjects also 
composed the Modified Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set.  
Safety in the Outpatient Setting 
Subjects were considered to have received outpatient treatment if their first liso-cel infusion day did not 
overlap with any hospitalization stays during the study. 
In the liso-cel arm in Study BCM-003 and in the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Studies (017001 DLBCL Cohort, BCM-
001 Cohort 7, and 017007), 19 and 85 subjects respectively, were treated with liso-cel in the outpatient 
setting. 
Summary of Results from Outpatient Set 
Out of 19 subjects treated in an outpatient setting in the liso-cel arm of Study BCM-003, all had TEAEs, 
and 18 (94.7%) subjects had Grade ≥ 3 events. There were no Grade 5 TEAEs. The most frequent Grade 
≥ 3 events were neutropenia (68.4%), anemia (57.9%), thrombocytopenia (42.1%), and lymphopenia 
(42.1%)  .  A  total  of  10  (52.6%)  subjects  experienced  at  least  one  event  of  CRS  and  1  subject 
experienced iiNT. 
Out of 85 subjects treated in an outpatient setting in the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Studies, all had TEAEs, and 
63 (74.1%) subjects had Grade ≥ 3 events. There were no Grade 5 TEAEs. The most frequent Grade ≥ 
3  events  were  neutropenia  (52.9%),  anemia  (27.1%),  leukopenia  (23.5%),  and  thrombocytopenia 
(21.2%). A total of 32 (37.6%) subjects experienced at least one event of CRS and 27 (31.8%) subjects 
experienced iiNT.

LBCL Treated Set (n= 384) showed overall consistent results, and support the integration of safety data 
across 2L and 3L+ LBCL subjects to inform the product label following liso-cel infusion in LBCL 
Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC now reflect the updated data and the modified pooled 2L LBCL treated 
set (n=177) which now includes BCM-003, 017006, and BCM-001 cohort 2. 
Consequently, the description of selected adverse reactions in the SmPC has been changed.

For patients who received one prior line of therapy: 
CRS occurred in 45% of patients, 1% of whom experienced Grade 3 CRS (no fatal events). The median 
time to onset was 4 days (range: 1 to 63 days, with the upper limit due to CRS onset, without fever, 
reported in one patient), and the median duration of CRS was 4 days (range: 1 to 16 days). The most 
common manifestations of CRS included pyrexia (44%), hypotension (12%), chills (5%), hypoxia (5%), 
tachycardia (4%), headache (3%), and fatigue (2%). In clinical studies, 42 out of 177 (24%) patients 
received  tocilizumab  and/or  a  corticosteroid  for  CRS  after  liso-cel  infusion.  Eighteen  (10%)  patients 
received tocilizumab only, 24 (14%) patients received tocilizumab and a corticosteroid, and no patients 
received corticosteroids only.

NT occurred in 18% of patients receiving liso-cel, including Grade 3 in 5% of patients (no fatal events). 
The median time to onset of the first event was 8 days (range: 1 to 63 days); 97% of all neurologic 
toxicities occurred within the first 8 weeks following liso-cel infusion. The median duration of neurologic 
toxicities  was  6  days  (range:  1  to  89  days).  The  most  common  neurologic  toxicities  included 
encephalopathy (10%), tremor (8%), aphasia (5%), dizziness (2%), and headache (1%). 
Febrile neutropenia has been observed in 7% of patients. 
Infections (all grades) occurred in 25% of patients. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 10% 
of patients. Grade 3 or higher infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 3% of patients, 
bacterial infections occurred in 5%, and viral and fungal infections occurred in 2% and none of the 
patients, respectively. 
Grade 3 or higher cytopenias present at Day 35 following liso-cel administration, occurred in 35% of 
patients, and included thrombocytopenia (28%), neutropenia (26%), and anaemia (9%). 
Hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 7% of patients. 
For patients who received two or more prior lines of therapy for LBCL (n= 384 patients infused 
with  liso-cel  from  4  pooled  studies  (TRANSCEND  [017001],  TRANSCEND  WORLD  [JCAR017-BCM-001, 
cohort 1, 3 and 7], PLATFORM [JCAR017-BCM-002] and OUTREACH [017007]): 
CRS occurred in 38% of patients, 2% of whom experienced Grade 3 or 4 (severe or life-threatening) 
CRS. There were no fatal events. Among patients who died after receiving liso-cel, 4 had ongoing CRS 
events at the time of death. The median time to onset was 4 days (range: 1 to 14 days) and the median 
duration was 5 days (range: 1 to 17 days). The most common manifestations of CRS included pyrexia 
(38%), hypotension (18%), tachycardia (13%), chills (9%), and hypoxia (8%). In clinical studies, 74 
out of 384 (19%) patients received tocilizumab and/or a corticosteroid for CRS after infusion of liso-cel. 
Thirty-seven (10%) patients received tocilizumab only, 29 (8%) received tocilizumab and a corticosteroid 
and 8 (2%) received corticosteroids only. 
NT occurred in 26% of patients receiving liso-cel, including Grade 3 or 4 in 10% of patients (no fatal 
events).  The  median  time  to  onset  of  the  first  event  was  9  days  (range:  1  to  66  days);  99%  of  all 
neurologic toxicities occurred within the first 8 weeks following liso-cel infusion. The median duration of 
neurologic toxicities was 10 days (range: 1 to 84 days). The most common neurologic toxicities included 
encephalopathy (18%), tremor (9%), aphasia (8%), delirium (7%), headache (4%), ataxia (3%) and 
dizziness (3%). Seizures (2%) and cerebral oedema (0.3%) also occurred in patients treated with liso-
cel.

Post marketing experience 
Liso-cel was first approved in the US on 05-Feb-2021 for the treatment of adult patients with R/R LBCL 
after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy. It was subsequently approved in Japan and Switzerland for 
patients with R/R LBCL who have received 2 or more therapies, and it was most recently approved in 
the EU on 04-Apr-2022 for the treatment of adult patients with R/R DLBCL, PMBCL, and FL3B, after 2 or 
more lines of systemic therapy.  
Currently,  post-marketing  data  are  available  from  the  US  as  presented  in  the  Periodic  Adverse  Drug 
Experience  Reports  (PADERs;  reporting  periods:  05-Feb-2021  through  04-May-2021,  05-May-2021 
through  04-Aug-2021,  05-Aug-2021  through  04-Nov-2021,  and  05-Nov-2021  through  04-Feb-2022). 
Review  of  these  post-marketing  data  did  not  reveal  any  new  safety  concerns  for  liso-cel.  The  post-
marketing data were consistent with the safety profile of liso-cel as previously reported and described in 
the product label. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety evaluation was primarily based on ongoing Study BCM-003, which was conducted in subjects 
with  R/R  LBCL  after  1  prior  therapy  who  were  eligible  for  high-dose  chemotherapy  (HDCT)  and 
autologous  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplant  (HSCT).  Safety data  included  183  subjects  (n=92  liso-
cel;  n=91  SOC).  Additionally,  safety  data  from  time  of  liso-cel  infusion  of  liso-cel-treated  2L  LBCL 
subjects from Study BCM 003 liso-cel arm as well as other 2L studies (Study 017006, and Study BCM-
001 [Cohort 2]) and the marketed indication of 3L+ LBCL (Study 017001 [DLBCL Cohort], Study BCM 
001 [Cohorts 1, 3, and 7], Study 017007, and Study BCM-002) were pooled to allow for a side-by-side 
comparison. Notably, the most relevant difference between patients included in the Arm B (liso-cel arm) 
of Study BCM-003 and the Pooled 2L LBCL was the “transplant-not intended” in the second treated set. 
The MAH clarified that “transplant not-intended” (TNI) patients were those deemed ineligible for high-
dose chemotherapy and HSCT due to age, performance status or comorbidity, while also having adequate 
organ  function  for  CAR  T-cell  treatment  based  on  the  Investigator  judgement.  Therefore,  taking  into 
account  a  broader  indication  for  Breyanzi,  including  the  transplant-not  intended  subjects,  the  MAH 
supported the integration of the safety data across 2L and 3L+ LBCL subjects to inform the product label 
following liso-cell infusion in LBCL. 
In  Study  BCM-003,  baseline  demographic  and  characteristics  for  the  ITT  analysis  set  were  balanced 
between the liso-cel and the SOC arm and were representative of a 2L LBCL population. However, the 
female population was less represented in the SOC arm as were the elderly patients in the age group ≥ 
75 years. The impact of these differences on the safety profile has been discussed pooling Study BCM-
003 subjects with other 2L LBCL studies (Studies 017006 and BCM-001 Cohort 2), that enrolled elderly 
patients. Safety was generally similar among subjects < 65 years (n= 62), ≥ 65 to < 70 years (n= 23), 
≥ 70 to < 75 years (n= 51), and ≥ 75 to < 85 years (n= 41) in the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, with 
the exception of higher frequency of iiNT reported in subjects ≥ 75 to < 85 years (31.7%) compared to 
subjects < 65 years (9.7%) or lower  frequency of iiNT  in subjects < 65 years and < 75 years in  the 
Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set (9.7% and 14%, respectively) compared to the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated 
Set (29.4% and 27%, respectively). Furthermore, no significant differences were noted in the subgroups 
by sex. 
The  overall  incidences  of  TEAEs  and  SAEs  were  similar  for  subjects  in  the  liso-cel  and  SOC  arms. 
However, the AE profiles were different but in line with the respective mechanism of action for liso-cel 
and SOC. A similar pattern of TEAEs to the Liso-cel was observed in subjects who crossed over to liso-
cel from the SOC arm.  
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 164/186 
 
 
 
Hematological AEs were the most frequently reported Grade 3-4 TEAE in both arms, but the incidence 
of Grade 3-4 TEAEs of neutropenia and lymphopenia appeared higher in the liso-cel arm  as compared 
with the SOC arm. There was no parallel increase in infection or febrile neutropenia that appeared to be 
higher in the SOC arm.  
Overall, the pattern of treatment-related TEAEs reported in the liso-cel arm was similar to that reported 
in the SOC arm with the exception of some system organ class categories: more subjects in the liso-cel 
arm experienced treatment-related TEAEs in the system organ classes of Immune System Disorder and 
Investigations than in the SOC arm, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) which is a characteristic 
AE of CAR T-cell therapies. Conversely, more subjects in the SOC arm experienced treatment-related 
TEAEs in the Metabolism and Nutrition Disorder system organ class.  
CRS was also the most frequently reported SAE in the liso-cel arm (12 subjects [13.0%]), together to 
febrile  neutropenia  (7  subjects  [7.6%]),  neutropenia  (7  subjects  [7.6%]),  and  pyrexia  (6  subjects 
[6.5%]), whereas in the SOC arm the most frequently reported SAEs were febrile neutropenia (9 subjects 
[9.9%]),  pyrexia  (7  subjects  [7.7%]),  acute  kidney  injury  (5  subjects  [5.5%]),  and  neutropenia  (4 
subjects [4.4%]). 
The overall number of deaths was n= 8 (8.8%) in the SOC arm, n= 13 (14.1%) in the liso-cel arm and 
n= 16 (34%) in the SOC arm post-crossover. The majority of deaths, including those in the SOC arm 
after crossover, were due to disease progression. Two subjects in the SOC arm died to a Grade 5 TEAE: 
a sepsis and an acute respiratory distress syndrome, both considered not related to any study drug. Two 
subjects in the SOC arm died due to AEs not-considered treatment-emergent: one subject for multiorgan 
failure and one for cardiac arrest, both in the context of disease progression. In the liso-cel arm, two 
subjects died due to an AE: one subject for PT of failure to thrive considered not related to study drug, 
and one subject died of COVID-19 during the treatment period. More details have been provided by the 
MAH on the deaths occurred in the liso-cel arm (n=3, 3.3%) and in the SOC arm post-crossover (n=3, 
6.4%)  in  which  the  cause  of  death  category  was  “other”.  These  deaths  were  due  either  to  sepsis  or 
COVID-19.  It  should  be  noted  that  COVID-19  was  the  cause  of  death  in  4  out  of  6  patients  in  Study 
BCM-003 and no COVID-19 vaccination was reported for these patients. It should be noted that all these 
deaths  occurred  before  the  COVID-19  vaccination  was  initiated  in  the  respective  countries,  with  the 
exception of one subject. The MAH specified that a “Dear Investigator Letter” was sent to sites on 10-
May-2021 advising that Investigators should apply their clinical judgment in weighing the benefits and 
risks of COVID-19 vaccination for cancer patients who were participating in BMS Cellular Therapy clinical 
trials. Consequently, at the time of the Primary Analysis in the Addendum CSR (data cut-off 13-May-
2022), 85 out of 184 randomized subjects were reported to have been vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 (53 
in  the  liso-cel  Arm  and  32  in  the  SOC  Arm).  Patients  receiving  CD19  CAR  T-cell  therapy  for 
relapsed/refractory 
lymphoma  experienced  prolonged  and  profound  B-cell  aplasia  and 
hypogammaglobulinemia, placing them at higher risk of severe COVID-19. Independently, it has been 
recently  reported  that,  despite  attenuated  humoral  response  to  mRNA-based  vaccines,  patients 
demonstrate normal or heightened functional T-cell responses, including antiviral T-cell activity against 
SARS-CoV-2  variants  including  Omicron  (Oh  et  al.  Blood  2022,  Atanackovic  et  al.  Blood  2022). 
Collectively,  these  data  reinforce  the  importance  of  COVID-19  vaccination  following  CD19  CAR  T-cell 
therapy  (as  strongly  recommended  by  ASTCT,  Center  for  International  Blood  and  Marrow  Transplant 
Research-CIBMTR  and  the  National  Marrow  Donor  Program-NMDP  in  alignment  with  CDC/ACIP 
recommendations),  despite  long-term  B-cell  aplasia  and  the  patients  should  be  counselled  on  the 
importance  of  prevention  measures.  The  statement  on  COVID-19  has  been  updated  accordingly  in 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC.

AESIs included the following categories: CRS, neurologic toxicity immune effector cell associated events 
(i.e.,  iiNT),  cytopenia  and  prolonged  cytopenia,  TLS,  MAS,  Grade  ≥  3  infection,  and  second  primary 
malignancies. As expected, the frequency of AESIs was greater in the liso-cel arm than in the SOC arm. 
In the liso-cel arm, 45 (48.9%) subjects experienced at least one event of CRS with a median time to 
onset  of  5.0  days  (range  1  to  63  days).  Out  of  45  subjects  who  showed  CRS  signs  or  symptoms,  21 
subjects received tocilizumab. Of these, 12 also received additional treatment with corticosteroids. The 
3  most  frequently  reported  symptoms  of  CRS  were  pyrexia  (44  [47.8%]  subjects),  hypotension  (9 
[9.8%]  subjects),  and  chills  and  headache  (both  reported  in  4  [4.3%]  subjects).  The  median  time  to 
resolution as of the data cut-off date of 4.0 days (range 1 to 16 days). Similar results were observed for 
subjects in the SOC arm post-crossover. No subject had ongoing CRS at time of death. Only 1 subject 
in  the  liso-cel  arm  reported  Grade ≥  3  CRS,  graded  according  to  the  Lee  criteria  (Lee,  2014),  with  a 
reported symptom of hypertransaminasaemia (Grade 3), with onset 9.0 days after the start of liso-cel 
infusion and resolution within 2.0 days. The event was detailed, noting that not all criteria for CRS were 
met for this subject (lack of recorded fever). However, the Investigator deemed the overall presentation 
consistent  with  CRS  due  to  lack  of  an  alternative  explanation,  and  the  Sponsor  accepted  this 
determination. 
Out of 92 subjects in the liso-cel arm, 11 (12%) subjects experienced iiNT. The median time to onset of 
iiNT was 11.0 days (range 7 to 25 days), whereas the median time to resolution was 6.0 days (range 1 
to 30 days). Of the 11 subjects who experienced iiNT, aphasia and tremor were reported in 4 (4.3%) 
subjects each and encephalopathy, dizziness, headache, and confusional state were reported in 2 (2.2%) 
subjects each. Seven received either tocilizumab (n= 1) or corticosteroids (n= 6) for treatment of their 
event. No subjects received vasopressors for iiNT and all subjects recovered with no neurologic sequela. 
Cytopenia  and  prolonged  cytopenia  were  reported  less  frequently  in  the  SOC  arm  compared  with  the 
liso-cel arm (prolonged cytopenia n=3, 3.3% in SOC arm vs n=40, 43.5% in liso-cel arm). However, 
most subjects recovered from prolonged cytopenia by the pre-selected timepoints of 35 or 62 days post-
prolonged cytopenia diagnosis. 
Between other AESIs, tumor lysis syndrome was reported only in 2 (2.2%) subjects in the SOC arm; 
macrophage activation syndrome was reported in 1 (1.1%) subject in the liso-cel arm who experienced 
a Grade 2 event of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with onset on Day 42 and resolved on Day 47 
without treatment (although the event was concurrent with CRS and the subject received treatment for 
CRS). Grade ≥ 3 infections were reported in 14 (15.2%) subjects in the liso-cel arm and in 19 (20.9%) 
subjects in the SOC arm; second primary malignancy only occurred in 1 subject in the SOC arm (Kaposi 
sarcoma), which was reported as a post-treatment AE. 
Changes  in  hematology  laboratory  results  in  the  SOC  arm  were  difficult  to  discern,  possibly  because 
subjects received differing numbers of cycles of salvage immunochemotherapy. However, some trends 
were apparent: hemoglobin declined gradually through Day 85, after which it began to rise gradually; 
neutrophils  appeared  relatively  stable  until  Day  64,  after  which  they  declined.  Leukocytes  were 
depressed from Day 64 through to the end of the study and Platelets decreased from baseline to Day 
15. They increased markedly on Day 22 and declined thereafter, only to gradually increase again starting 
from  Day  85.  In  liso-cel  arm,  neutrophils  showed  a  decline  through  Day  29,  followed  by  a  period  of 
relative stability, followed by a gradual increase from Day 64 onward. Lymphocyte counts were low at 
Day 29, followed by an increase over the remainder of the study, concurrent with liso-cel expansion. 
Platelet counts appeared decreased from baseline to Day 15. They increased markedly on Day 22 and 
declined thereafter, to then gradually increase again starting from Day 50. Hemoglobin levels remained 
generally  stable  throughout  the  study.  Regarding  laboratory  findings,  in  the  liso-cel  arm  most  serum 
chemistry parameters remained stable over time. In particular, ALT, AST, and bilirubin remained stable, 
with the exception of a spike at the EOS visit. Only a single subject had these values reported at an EOS 
Assessment report

visit, and this subject’s EOS visit occurred after disease progression. More details have been provided 
on this case. Moreover, no other transaminase aberrances to signal a safety concern were observed in 
the liso-cel arm. 
Regarding  decreased  fibrinogen,  2  subjects  randomized  to  the  liso-cel  arm  experienced  the  AE  of 
hypofibrinogenemia  requiring  standard  interventions.  Hypofibrinogenemia  appeared  to  be  associated 
with recent onset CRS. Safety narratives for these 2 subjects were also provided. However, no clinical 
events such as disseminated intravascular coagulation or haemorrhage/bleeding were related to this AE.  
Finally, there were no notable differences in the analyses within the subgroup analyses by age, sex, race 
and NHL subtype.  
Overall,  the  safety  data  reported  in  liso-cel-treated  subjects  from  the  time  of  liso-cel  infusion  in  the 
Study  BCM  003  liso-cel  arm  seems  to  be  consistent  with  that  observed  in  the  2L  and  3L+  LBCL 
populations  and  no  new  safety  concerns  have  been  identified.  However,  some  differences  could  be 
observed. 
It should be noted that there was a higher frequency of liso-cel TEAEs within Blood and lymphatic system 
disorders, in particular for neutropenia (52.8% in BCM-003 Arm B vs 45.8% in Pooled 2L vs 37.6% in 
Pooled  3L+)  and  thrombocytopenia  (40.4%  in  BCM-003  Arm  B  vs  27.7%  vs  16.4%  in  Pooled  3L+). 
However,  when  analysing  treatment-emergent  laboratory  abnormalities,  this  difference  was  not 
observed.  Moreover,  no  increased  risk  of  severe  infections  or  type  of  infections  were  reported.  No 
association between thrombocytopenia and haemorrhagic events was also observed.  
Neurological toxicities, defined as events within the ND/PD system organ class, occurred in 49 (55.1%) 
subjects in the liso-cel-treated analysis set of Study BCM-003, compared with 98 (55.4%) subjects in 
the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, and 300 (70.1%) subjects in the Pooled 3L+ Treated Set. As requested, 
the MAH evaluated neurological toxicities, defined as events within the ND/PD system organ class, using 
the  data  cut-off  date  from  the  Primary  Analysis  in  the  BCM-003  Addendum  CSR  (data  cut-off  date  of 
13-May-2022). TEAEs in the ND/PD system organ class occurred in 59 (64.1%) subjects in the liso-cel 
arm and 57 (62.6%) subjects in the SOC arm. These included treatment-related events in 32 (34.8%) 
subjects in the liso-cel arm and 28 (30.8%) subjects in the SOC arm, Grade 3/4 events in 12 (13.0%) 
subjects  in  the  liso-cel  arm  and  8  (8.8%)  subjects  in  the  SOC  arm,  and  serious  events  in  5 (5.4%) 
subjects  in  the  liso-cel  arm  and  5  (5.5%)  subjects  in  the  SOC  arm.  The  most  commonly  (≥  10%  of 
subjects) occurring neurological toxicity TEAEs included headache (43.5%), dizziness (23.9%), insomnia 
(20.7%), and tremor (12.0%) in the liso-cel arm and headache (23.1%), dizziness (14.3%), dysgeusia 
(12.1%), and insomnia and peripheral sensory neuropathy (11.0% each) in the SOC arm. The median 
time to onset from randomization was 29.0 days (range 1 to 106 days), whereas the median duration 
of the episodes was 77.0 days (range 1 to 1148 days). Only 2 subjects did not recover at the time of 
the cut-off data, 56 subjects recovered with no sequelae and 1 subject was recovering. In the liso-cel 
arm, out of the 59 subjects who reported NT, 44 subjects (47.8%) received at least one concomitant 
medication for treatment-emergent NT, and paracetamol was the most frequent medication used in both 
arms (13.2% in SOC arm and 19.6% in liso-cel arm). Among subjects who experienced a treatment-
emergent NT event, those randomized into the liso-cel arm had a higher frequency of any ND/PD system 
organ class condition in their medical history compared to those randomized into the SOC arm. However, 
a specific association between prior clinical conditions/comorbidities and the development of a particular 
NT event cannot be inferred.  
In addition, the MAH specified that a total of 16 subjects have been identified with primary or secondary 
CNS lymphoma across liso-cel studies: 5 subjects with primary CNS lymphoma (all in Study BCM-001 
Cohort 5) and 11 subjects with secondary CNS lymphoma (7 subjects in Study 017001 DLBCL Cohort, 2 
subjects in Study 017007, and 1 subject each in Study BCM-003 and BCM-001 Cohort 2). Efficacy has

been  observed  in  liso-cel  treated  subjects  with  primary  and  secondary  CNS  involvement.  The  safety 
profile was similar in both subjects with CNS lymphoma and those without CNS lymphoma. No increased 
risks  have  been  observed  for  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AESI)  including  cytokine  release 
syndrome (CRS) and neurological toxicity (NT) in those subjects with CNS involvement. However, for 
the small number of patients any definitive conclusion can be drawn. 
The MAH also clarified that the frequencies of any-grade hypogammaglobulinemia AESIs in Study BCM-
003 were comparable to the Pooled 2l LBCL treated Set and lower than the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated 
Set (6.7% vs. 6.2% vs. 12.4%, respectively), as well as for any-grade secondary malignancy AESI (0% 
vs. 0.6% and 1.6%, respectively), probably reflecting less severely pre-treated patients in Study BCM-
003. 
Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) are aggressive leukemia, associated with high-risk features 
and low survival. Recently, exposure to CAR-T, including liso-cel, has been linked to t-MN development 
in a series of NHL patients (Alkhateeb et al Blood Cancer Journal 2022). Given the strikingly short interval 
between  CAR-T  and  the  development  of  t-MN,  especially  in  those  NHL  patients  who  had  dysplasia  or 
clonal  abnormalities  before  CAR-T,  the  MAH  has  been  asked  to  comment  this  potentially  fatal 
complications,  including  the  need  for  specific  vigilance  measures.  A  cumulative  search  of  the  BMS 
corporate safety database was conducted to identify any potential therapy-related myeloid neoplasm (t-
MN)  cases.  The  overall  cumulative  patient  exposure  to  liso-cel  from  all  sources  (clinical  trials, 
commercial, and named-patient programs) is approximately 1767 patients, and a total of 27 cases were 
identified. Of these, 21 cases reported MDS, 4 cases reported  acute myeloid leukaemia  (AML), and 1 
case each reported acute erythroid leukaemia and leukaemia. The median interval from CAR T infusion 
to onset of t-MN was 359 days (11.77 months), whereas the average interval from initial chemotherapy 
to  onset  of  t-MN  was  7.6  years,  which  might  suggest  that  these  events  could  be  explained  by  prior 
chemotherapy.  The  only  known  case  with  the  diagnosis  of  myelodysplastic  syndrome  (MDS),  made  3 
months after liso-cel infusion, showed cytogenetic abnormalities in bone marrow biopsy 13 days before 
liso-cel  infusion.  Furthermore,  secondary  malignancies  (which  include  MDS  and  AML)  are  listed  as  an 
important potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Finally, due to the limitation of the small sample size for certain subgroups in the liso-cel-treated analysis 
set of Study BCM-003, the subgroup analyses focus on the Pooled 2L Treated Set, with comparisons with 
the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set under each subgroup category.  
Overall, in the Pooled 2L and Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Sets, CRS and iiNT were more frequent in subjects 
with higher disease burden (SPD ≥ 50 cm2), or with more aggressive disease (HGBCL or subjects who 
required  bridging).  A  lower  frequency  of  iiNT  was  noted  in  certain  subgroups  in  the  Pooled  2L  LBCL 
Treated Set compared with the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set. However, the number of subjects in certain 
subgroups was too small to draw any clinically meaningful conclusion. Regarding specifically Study BCM-
003, the MAH underlines that there were no notable differences in the analyses within these subgroups 
in the liso-cel-treated analysis set of Study BCM-003, and the results across the subgroups in the liso-
cel-treated  analysis  set  of  Study  BCM-003  were  generally  consistent  with  what  was  observed  in  the 
Pooled 2L and Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Sets. 
In the liso-cel arm in Study BCM-003 and in the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Studies (017001 DLBCL Cohort, BCM-
001 Cohort 7, and 017007), 19 and 85 subjects respectively, were treated with liso cel in the outpatient 
setting. No new safety concerns were identified. 
Additional pooled safety analyses from time of liso-cel infusion for the subset of subjects who received 
a dose of liso-cel within the dose range of 44 to 120 x 106 CAR+ viable T cells in the Modified Pooled 2L 
LBCL Treated Set (n=177) and Modified Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set (n= 384) showed overall consistent 
results, and support the integration of safety data across 2L and 3L+ LBCL subjects to inform the product

label  following  liso-cel  infusion  in  LBCL.  Therefore,  the  proposed  product  label  has  been  updated  to 
include the transplant-not intended subjects from Studies 017006 (19-Nov-2021 data cut-off date) and 
BCM-001 Cohort 2 (02-Mar-2022 data cut-off date). Additionally, the ADR table includes updated data 
for Study BCM-003 (13-May-2022 data cut-off date) and Study BCM-001 Cohorts 1, 3, and 7 (02-Mar-
2022 data cut-off date). 
Regarding the surface expression of EGFRt that could serve as a target for selective depletion of Breyanzi 
using anti-EGFR antibodies such as cetuximab as a strategy to mitigate severe adverse events associated 
with CAR T cells, the MAH specified that, in the liso-cel clinical development program, only two subjects 
with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (Study 017004) received an anti-EGFR antibody (cetuximab), 
with an unknown posology. In both cases cetuximab was administered for the treatment of suspected 
neurotoxicity.  To  date,  there  has  been  no  use  of  cetuximab  for  Breyanzi  depletion  in  large  B-cell 
lymphoma (LBCL) liso-cel studies. In light of the information above, the MAH updated the statement on 
clinical use of anti-EGFR antibodies in Section 4.5 of the SmPC.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No  new  safety  concerns  were  identified  in  this  2L  patient  population  studied  in  BCM-003.  The  overall 
safety  profile  for  subjects  treated  with  liso-cel  was  similar  to  that  of  subjects  treated  with  SOC,  with 
notable differences as expected with regard to AESIs that are known side effects specific to CAR T cell 
therapy. Overall, the safety events reported in this study were consistent with those previously observed 
in the marketed indication of 3L+ LBCL and were manageable. In particular, similar rates of CAR T-cell-
associated  toxicities  were  observed  in  this  2L  LBCL  population  when  compared  to  the  3L+  LBCL 
population. Overall, liso-cel demonstrates a manageable and consistent safety profile in patients with 2L 
LBCL,  which  is  consistent  with  the  3L+  population.  The  data  presented  in  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) reflect the entire clinical experience at the recommended dose range. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CAT received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
Overall, the updates introduced in the RMP version 2.4 are in line with the application for an extension 
of indication to include treatment of adult patients with Second-line (2L) Transplant Intended (TI) Large 
B-Cell  Lymphoma  (LBCL).  The  MAH  did  not  propose  any  change  of  safety  specification, 
pharmacovigilance activities or risk minimization measures. There are no changes to the conditions and 
obligations of MA. 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.4 is acceptable.  
The CAT endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CAT endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 2.4 with the following content:

2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As  a  consequence  of  this  new  indication,  sections  4.1,  4.4,  4.8,  5.1  and  5.2  of  the  SmPC  have  been 
updated.  Annex  II  condition  for  PASS  JCAR017-BCM-005  has  also  been  adapted  including  the  newly 
approved Indication in 2Line treatment. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes  were  also  made  to  the  PI  to  bring  it  in  line  with  the  current  Agency/QRD  template,  SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients  guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], 
which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
- a full user test has already been assessed in the IMA  
- the route of administration is the same of the already approved indication 
- the safety profile is similar as the previously approved indication  
-  lisocabtagene  maraleucel  is  administered  by  a  health  care  professional  and  the  instructions  for 
preparation, administration, storage and disposal are that already reflected in the approved PL  
- the general design and layout of the proposed PL have not changed compared to the tested one 
- no major changes are foreseen for the new indication. 
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant  to  Article  23(1)  of  Regulation  No  (EU)  726/2004,  Breyanzi  Lisocabtagene  maraleucel)  is 
included in the additional monitoring list as  
• 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU; 
It has a PASS imposed either at the time of authorisation or afterwards; 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH requested an extension of the approved indication of Breyanzi to include the treatment of adult 
patients  with  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  (DLBCL),  high  grade  B-cell  lymphoma  (HGBCL),  primary 
mediastinal  large  B-cell  lymphoma  (PMBCL)  and  follicular  lymphoma  grade  3B  (FL3B),  who  relapsed 
within 12 months from completion of, or are refractory to, first-line chemoimmunotherapy. 
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) with a large B cell histology (i.e., large B cell lymphomas, LBCLs) are 
a broad group of lymphoproliferative neoplasms characterised by biological heterogeneity and aggressive 
clinical behaviour. DLBCL is the single most common form of NHL, accounting for 30% to 40% of all NHL 
cases.  
HGBCL is a very aggressive form of large B-cell lymphoma that has been initially recognised as a distinct 
condition in the 2016 revision of the WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms. HGBCL cases harbour 
the dual rearrangement of MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 genes, accounting for 5% to 7% of all DLBCLs. 
PMBCL is a rare form of large B-cell lymphoma (2.4% of all NHLs) characterised by female predominance, 
younger age at diagnosis, and primary mediastinal involvement. 
FL3B  is  a  rarer  subtype  of  follicular  lymphoma  (FL)  that  shares  biological  similarities  to  DLBCL  and, 
compared to low-grade FL, is characterised by an aggressive clinical behaviour. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
All LBCLs share the same treatment paradigm, which is largely based on evidence from DLBCL trials. 
Treatment outcomes and prognosis are known to vary, however, across subtypes, and are influenced by 
several patient- and disease-related factors. Frontline treatment of advanced stage LBCL is usually based 
on  the  combination  of  anthracycline-including  polychemotherapy  regimens  and  anti-CD20 monoclonal 
antibodies,  such  as  the  standard  R-CHOP  regimen  (i.e.,  rituximab,  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin, 
vincristine  and  prednisone).  In  a  higher  risk  population,  R-CHP  plus  polatuzumab  has  been  recently 
shown to yield higher  PFS and EFS rates compared to R-CHOP, although no survival benefit could be 
demonstrated (see e.g., Tilly H et al, NEJM 2022). Approximately 60-80% of patients with DLBCL, PMBCL 
and  FL3B  (depending  on  age  and  other  baseline  risk  factors)  are  expected  to  achieve  long-term 
remission-cure  with 
frontline 
immunochemotherapy.  The  outcome  of  HGBCL  with  standard 
immunochemotherapy is less favourable.  
Approximately 10-40% of DLBCL patients are refractory to frontline immunochemotherapy or experience 
disease relapse. Most relapses occur in the first two years after completing treatment, but up to one-
fifth occur more than five years after treatment. Lower ORRs and shorter OS have been reported in the 
PARMA  and  CORAL  studies  in  subjects  with  refractory  DLBCL  or  with  early  relapse  after  frontline 
chemotherapy (e.g., <12 months) 
Salvage  treatment  with  non-cross  resistant  chemotherapy  followed  by  high  dose  chemotherapy  and 
autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT) has long been considered the standard of care in 
this setting and has been associated with long-term survival/cure in approximately half of patients with 
first relapsed DLBCL. Subjects with DLBCL were largely prevalent in all studies investigating the efficacy 
of 2nd line salvage strategies, thus the extent of the efficacy of salvage regimens in LGBL histologies

Page 178/186 
 
 
 
other than DLBCL is uncertain. The role of salvage chemotherapy, usually administered for 2-3 cycles, 
is to reduce the burden of disease and determine residual chemosensitivity. Only subjects who achieve 
CR/Deauville 4 PR according to PET/CT are eligible for ASCT, since patients with inadequate response 
have been shown not to benefit from transplant consolidation. Several salvage immunochemotherapy 
regimens  are  currently  available  (e.g.  R-DHAP,  R-ESHAP,  R-GEMOX,  R-ICE,  R-GDP)  and  none  was 
demonstrated to be clearly superior to the others, although differences in the toxicity profile might guide 
treatment choices.  
In addition to standard immunochemotherapy (e.g. R-GemOx, bendamustine + rituximab etc.), novel 
options have been recently approved for non-transplant eligible (NTE) subjects with R/R DLBCL, including 
the combination of the anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody tafasitamab (Minjuvi) with lenalidomide (Tafa-R) 
and  the  pola-BR  regimen  (including  the  anti-CD79b  conjugated  monoclonal  antibody  polatuzumab 
vedotin [Polivy] in combination with bendamustine and rituximab, see the NCCN guidelines v. 5.2022). 
Although ORR as high as 45-58% (CRR ~40%) could be observed with these new regimens (mDoR in 
the range 12.6-34.6 months), limited data are currently available for the higher risk subset of patients 
identified by the Breyanzi claimed indication (i.e. subjects who are refractory or have relapsed within 12 
months  of  initial  therapy).  Only  a  minority  of  subjects  in  the  Minjuvi  registrational  trial  had  primary 
refractory  (18.5%)  or  early  (<12  months)  relapsed  disease  (23.5%),  and  only  13  patients  (28.3%) 
received the Pola-BR combination as their 2nd line treatment in pivotal study GO29365.  
Overall,  a  medical  need  for  new  effective  alternatives  to  the  currently  available  treatments  can  be 
recognized in the targeted high risk 2nd line setting, with the aim to improve remission rates and increase 
long-term disease control/cure. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Pivotal study BCM-003 is a randomised, open-label Phase III trial designed to compare the efficacy of 
liso-cel vs. standard of care (SOC) in a subset of patients with large B-cell lymphomas at higher risk of 
salvage 
failure  because  of  primary 
refractoriness  or  early 
relapse 
following 
frontline 
immunochemotherapy. This is the first evidence from a randomised control trial for Breyanzi. 
Supportive data in NTE subjects were provided by single-arm studies 017006 and BCM-001 Cohort 2. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
From  October  2018  to  December  2020,  184  patients  with  high-risk  2nd  line  LBCLs  underwent 
leukapheresis and were randomised in study BCM-003. Results from the inferential interim analysis at 
80% information fraction demonstrated the superiority of Breyanzi vs. SOC in the target population.  
The median EFS by IRC was 2.3 months (95%CI 2.2, 4.3) with SOC and 10.1 months (95%CI 6.1, 
NE) with liso-cel, resulting in a statistically significant and clinically relevant HR of 0.349 (95%CI 0.229, 
0.530;  p<0.0001).  The  6-month  EFS  rates  were  33.4%  and  63.3%  in  the  SOC  and  liso-cel  arms, 
respectively. The results from all the pre-specified sensitivity analyses for EFS were consistent with the 
primary analysis, including EFS by Investigator’s assessment (HR 0.343, 95%CI 0.225, 0.522) and EFS 
by IRC not including subjects who were PET/TC negative after bridging chemotherapy (HR 0.353, 95%CI 
0.209, 0.595). 
The median PFS by IRC was 5.7 months (95%CI 3.9, 9.4) in the SOC arm and 14.8 months (95%CI 
6.6, NE) in the liso-cel arm, respectively. The HR for PFS was 0.406 (95%CI 0.250, 0.659, p=0.0001), 
consistent with the primary EFS analysis. Although immature, PFS2 data were consistent with PFS data 
(HR 0.494, 95%CI 0.321, 0.760). 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 179/186 
 
 
 
Although  not  sufficiently  mature,  the  survival  analysis  showed  a  positive  trend  favouring  liso-cel: 
median  OS  was  16.4  months  (95%CI  11.0,  NE)  and  NE  (15.8,  NE)  in  the  SOC  and  liso-cel  arm, 
respectively, equivalent to a HR of 0.509 (95%CI 0.258, 1.004; p=0.0257). 
CRR  by  IRC  was  also  higher  with  liso-cel  (66.3%;  95%CI  55.7,  75.8)  compared  to  SOC  (39.1%; 
95%CI 29.1, 49.9; p<0.0001). A similar effect was also observed in the CRR analysis by Investigator 
and in the ORR analysis (ORR by IRC 47.8% vs. 85.9% in the SOC and liso-cel arms, respectively).  
Updated efficacy data from the non-inferential primary analysis of study BCM-003 with a longer 
follow-up (mFU ~17.5 months) confirmed the results observed in the 80% interim analysis: the updated 
HR for EFS by IRC was 0.356 (95%CI 0.243, 0.522), the mEFS was NR in the experimental arm (NE, 
95%CI 9.5, NE) vs. 2.4 months (95%CI 2.2, 4.9) in the control arm. 
The updated PFS by IRC also showed a consistent benefit with Breyanzi: the updated HR was 0.400 
(95%CI 0.261, 0.615) and the KM plots trend was consistent with what observed for EFS.  
The updated CRR by IRC was improved in both the SOC (CRR 43.5%) and liso-cel arm (73.9%). The 
updated mDoCR was 9.3 months (95%CI 5.1, NE) in the control arm vs. NE (95%CI NE, NE) in the 
liso-cel arm.  
No  statistically  significant  effect  could  be  observed  in  the  updated OS analysis:  the  HR  was  0.724 
(95%CI 0.443, 1.183). 
A consistently high anti-tumour activity could be observed across supportive studies 017006 and BCM-
001 Cohort 2 in NTE subjects with R/R LBCL who received liso-cel as their 2nd line treatment: the ORR 
in study 017006 was 67.6% (95%CI 55.7, 78) in the leukapheresed analysis set and 80.3% (95%CI 
68.2, 89.4) in the liso-cel treated set. The ORR in study BCM-001 Cohort 2 was 53.1% (95%CI 34.7, 
70.9)  and  63%  (95%CI  42.4,  80.6)  in  the  leukapheresed  and  in  the  liso-cel  treated  analysis  set, 
respectively.  
Deep and durable responses could be observed in both studies: in study 017006, the CRR was 45.9% 
(95%CI 34.2, 57.9) in the leukapheresed analysis set and 54.1% (95%CI 40.8, 66.9) in the liso-cel 
treated analysis sets, respectively. With a median follow-up of 15.5 months, the mDoR was 12.1 months 
(95%CI 6.24, NR) and the mDoCR was 21.65 months (95%CI 12.09, NR). In study BCM-002 Cohort 
2, the CRR was 37.5% (95%CI 21.1, 56.3) and 48.1% (28.7, 68.1) in the leukapheresed and in the 
liso-cel  treated  analysis  set,  respectively.  The mDoR  (as  per  EMA  censoring  rules)  was  12.1  months 
(95%CI 2.23, NE) and the mDoCR was 12.1 months (95%CI 1.64, NE). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Study population 
-  Rarer LGBL subtypes were poorly represented (e.g., FL3B 0.5%, THRBCL 2.7%), hampering the 
possibility  for  dedicated  B/R  evaluations.  The  protocol  of  PASS  JCAR017-BCM-005  has  to  be 
adapted to include subjects treated with Breyanzi as 2nd line therapy, expanding the collection 
of efficacy and safety data in these rare subgroups in the post-marketing setting (REC). 
-  No  prospective  analysis  of  CD19  expression  was  planned  in  study  BCM-003,  and  central 
confirmation  of  disease  did  not  require  systematic  CD19  expression  testing.  Overall,  no/very 
limited information with Breyanzi in subjects with CD19-negative disease are currently available 
from  the  Breyanzi  development  programme,  as  reflected  in  Section  4.4  of  the  SmPC.  Further 
characterisation of the correlation between liso-cel efficacy and CD19 expression (as assessed 
by either flow cytometry or IHC at the time of relapse) is needed and data will be provided post 
opinion. 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 180/186 
 
 
 
-  Subjects  with  secondary  CNS  involvement  could  be  enrolled  in  study  BCM-003,  yet  only  4 
subjects  with  CNS  involvement  were  actually  treated  in  the  pivotal  study.  Specific  B/R 
evaluations  are  hampered  by  the  reduced  sample  size.  A  warning  on  the  limited  clinical 
experience of use of Breyanzi for secondary CNS lymphoma is already included in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC. 
Results generalisability 
-  Subgroup  analyses  for  EFS  and  PFS  must  be  interpreted  with  caution,  due  to  sample  size 
limitations, yet the treatment effect was, overall, consistent across the most relevant subsets, 
including  subgroups  defined  by  sAAIPI,  refractoriness  to  frontline  treatment  and  prior 
chemotherapy response status, age, sex and region. Where sufficient data  were available, no 
significant differences in EFS could be observed in subgroups defined by histologic subtypes. 
-  Male subjects were more frequent in the SOC (66.3%) compared to the liso-cel arm (47.8%): 
male gender has been associated with a poor prognosis in DLBCL patients treated with rituximab-
containing  regimens,  thus  a  possible  impact  of  such  imbalance  on  study  results  cannot  be 
excluded. 
Long-term clinical benefit 
-  Cross-over from SOC to liso-cel was allowed for subjects who failed to achieve CR/PR at week 9 
(i.e., after 3 cycles of SOC), experienced disease progression (PD) or were in need to receive a 
new  antineoplastic  therapy  due  to  efficacy  concerns  after  week  18  post-randomisation.  In 
principle,  the  introduction  of  a  one-way  cross-over  to  liso-cel  might  result  in  OS  evaluations 
being confounded. On the other hand, it is recognised that anti-CD19 CAR T-cell products are 
the  current  3rd  line  efficacy  standard  and  introducing  the  possibility  for  “in  study”  cross-over 
could provide some insight in terms of better treatment sequence (i.e., liso-cel in 2nd line vs. 
SOC followed by liso-cel in non-responders).  
Prognostic/predictive factors 
-  Univariate and multivariate analyses showed a relationship between a T cell attribute in one of 
the two cell components of liso-cel and clinical efficacy outcomes. The biological/clinical rationale 
of  this  correlation  is  unclear,  and  further  validation  is  needed  to  conclude  on  its  possible 
predictive value. A consistent trend towards clinical benefit with liso-cel vs. SOC could still be 
observed acrossthe full range observed for this attribute . 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Unfavorable  effects  of  liso-cel  are  the  generally  known  identified  risks,  i.e.,  CRS,  neurotoxicity  and 
hematotoxicity.  Comparing  both  treatment  arms  of  BCM-003  Study,  the  following  observations  were 
made: 
• 
overall, the frequency of TEAEs reported in both treatment arms was similar. Almost all subjects 
in  each  arm  experienced  at  least  1  TEAE;  hematologic  toxicities  were  the  most  frequently 
reported TEAEs in both arms. A majority of subjects in both arms reported Grade 3-4 TEAEs and 
TEAEs considered related to a study drug; 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 181/186 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
the safety profile in subjects in the SOC arm who did not crossover to liso-cel treatment, 80.5% 
of whom received HDCT, was similar to that expected for subjects who receive HDCT; 
the incidence of the Grade 3-4 TEAEs of neutropenia and lymphopenia appeared higher in the 
liso-cel arm as compared to the SOC arm. However, this did not result in increased risk of febrile 
neutropenia  and  severe  infections  as  the  incidence  of  Grade  3-4  TEAEs  of  febrile  neutropenia 
and severe infections appeared to be numerically higher in the SOC arm (20.9% each) compared 
with the liso-cel arm (12.0% and 15.2%, respectively); 
as expected, the frequency of AESIs was greater in the liso-cel arm than in the SOC arm. The 
majority of AESIs reported in both arms were mild to moderate in severity and manageable with 
protocol-specified guidelines and/or local standards of care. The most frequently reported AESI 
category reported in both arms was neurological toxicity (63.7%, liso-cel; 64.1%, SOC), which 
was defined as all TEAEs within the Nervous system disorders or Psychiatric disorders system 
organ class; 
Specifically, in the liso-cel arm of BCM-003 (n= 92; data cut-off date of 8-March-2021): 
•  45 (48.9%) subjects experienced at least one event of CRS. Only 1 subject reported Grade ≥3 
CRS, graded according to the Lee criteria, and no Grade 4 or Grade 5 CRS events were reported; 
•  11 (12.0%) subjects in the liso-cel arm experienced any grade iiNT. The majority of events were 
mild to moderate in severity. Four (4.3%) subjects experienced Grade ≥3 iiNT (none were Grade 
4 or 5); 
•  40 (43.5%) subjects in the liso-cel arm experienced prolonged cytopenia (defined as a Grade 
≥3  or  higher  central  laboratory  results  of  decreased  hemoglobin,  neutrophils,  or  platelets 
observed at the Study Day 64 visit for the liso-cel arm, 35 days after liso-cel infusion); 
•  14 (15.2%) subjects in the liso-cel arm experienced Grade ≥3 infections; 
•  Safety profile from the additional follow-up of BCM-003 (data cut-off date of 13-May-2022) was 
consistent with that previously submitted in the initial SCS. 
Safety Analyses in the Pooled 2L and Pooled 3L+ Populations 
Overall, the safety profile of liso-cel in the liso-cel-treated analysis set of Study BCM-003 was similar to 
that observed in the Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, and consistent with that observed in the Pooled 3L+ 
LBCL  Treated  Set.  No  new  safety  concerns  were  identified.  The  type  and  frequency  of AESIs  were  as 
expected since they are known side effects specific to CAR T-cell therapy. Similar rates of CAR T cell-
associated toxicities were observed in the liso-cel-treated analysis set of Study BCM-003, as in the Pooled 
2L and Pooled 3L+ LBCL treated populations. 
Safety Analyses in the Modified Pooled 2L and Pooled 3L+ Populations 
At the dose range of 44 to 120 × 106 CAR+ viable T cells, the safety profile of liso-cel was consistent 
among the liso-cel-treated analysis set of Study BCM-003, the Modified Pooled 2L LBCL Treated Set, and 
the Modified Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Set. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Generally,  the  spectrum  of  the  unfavourable  effects  of  liso-cel  as  a  CAR  T  cell  product  is  known,  and 
currently  no  major  additional  issues  seem  to  arise.  The  disadvantage  and  limitation  is  that  the  MAH 
applies  for  an  extension  of  indication  with  a  rather  limited  follow-up  time  in  the  safety  data  package 
provided (DCO of 8 March 2021: median follow-up of 5.32 months [range 1.0, 18.0 months] for subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/171120/2023  
Page 182/186 
 
 
 
treated with  liso-cel), which revealed some uncertainties, in particular on long-term safety. However, 
using  the  updated  data  cut-off  date  (13-May-2022),  the  follow-up  time  for  Study  BCM-003  increased 
from a median of 5.32 months to a median of 16.43 months and the median follow-up for 2L total and 
3L+ total was 15.64 and 11.40 months respectively. 
The  safety  profile  of  liso-cel  as  second-line  treatment  in  the  intended  target  population  appears 
acceptable, since no new safety concerns have been identified.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The current salvage strategy in 2nd line LBCLs is aimed at achieving high remission rates to maximize 
clinical benefit from HDCT and ASCT and obtain long-term disease control. For subjects not eligible to 
ASCT  (NTE),  limited  options  are  available,  and  their  impact  on  long-term  disease  control  is 
unsatisfactory. An unmet medical need for more effective alternatives can be recognised, especially in 
the high-risk subgroup of patients who are refractory to frontline immunochemotherapy or experience 
early relapse.   
Efficacy data from pivotal study BCM-003 showed how, in the targeted high-risk population, liso-cel was 
able to induce higher CRR/ORR compared to SOC, which resulted in a clinically relevant and statistically 
significant prolongation of EFS and PFS. Despite the high rate of subjects who crossed over to liso-cel in 
the SOC arm and the immaturity of the updated survival analysis, a positive trend could also be observed 
in terms of OS. Further OS follow up data will be collected post opinion.  
A consistent high anti-tumour activity could also be observed also across supportive studies, indicating 
the possibility to achieve deep and durable responses also in a frailer (NTE), high risk patient population 
that received Breyanzi as second line treatment, and further supporting the broad claimed indication. 
No significant differences in terms of treatment effect were observed across relevant subgroups defined 
by response status to first-line treatment (primary refractory/relapsed), definition of early relapse and 
LBCL histology. Although low numbers did not allow for specific B/R evaluations in the rarest subgroups 
(e.g., PMBCL, FL3B), homogeneity in treatment response and consistency in CD19 expression across all

the considered histologies support the extrapolation of a similar clinical benefit with Breyanzi in the broad 
claimed indication. Further data in rare LBCL variants will be collected in the post-approval setting. 
No new safety concerns were identified in the targeted 2nd line population: the overall safety profile for 
subjects treated with liso-cel was similar to that of subjects treated with SOC, with notable differences 
as expected with regard to AESIs that are known side effects specific to CAR T cell therapy. Overall, the 
reported safety AEs were consistent with those previously observed in the marketed indication (i.e., 3rd+ 
line  LBCL)  and  were,  in most  cases,  manageable.  In  particular,  similar  rates  of  CAR  T-cell-associated 
toxicities were observed across treatment lines. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the available evidence, the clinical benefit of liso-cel as salvage treatment for 2nd line high-risk 
patients with LBCLs is considered to outweigh the known unfavourable effects with anti-CD19 CAR T cell 
therapy.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The MAH committed to further investigate the efficacy and safety of Breyanzi in subjects with rarer LBCL 
histologies in PASS study JCAR017-BCM-005,  to provide updated long-term data in NTE subjects with 
R/R  LBCL  from  the  final  CSRs  of  studies  017006  and  BCM-001  Cohort  2,  to  further  investigate  the 
correlation between CD19 expression of neoplastic cells and Breyanzi activity and to provide final study 
results including OS follow up data post opinion for study JCAR017-BCM-003.

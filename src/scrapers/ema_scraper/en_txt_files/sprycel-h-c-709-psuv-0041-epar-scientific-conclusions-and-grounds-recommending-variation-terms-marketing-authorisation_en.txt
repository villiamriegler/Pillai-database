Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Sprycel, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
During the use of dasatinib, Stevens-Johnsons Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and 
erythema multiforme (EM) were rarely observed. Evidence has been presented including positive 
de-challenge and re-challenge of severe skin reactions (EM and SJS) with dasatinib, but so far the reports 
have been rare. Given the rarity of these symptoms, establishment of causality based on a solid number 
of clinical cases is limited. Nevertheless, toxic skin reactions are expected ADRs reported with other 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and it is therefore recommended that section 4.8 of the SmPC of 
dasatinib is updated to include Steven-Johnson syndrome as a new adverse drug reaction with the 
frequency “not known”. The Package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding severe skin reactions the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Sprycel, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance dasatinib is favourable subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

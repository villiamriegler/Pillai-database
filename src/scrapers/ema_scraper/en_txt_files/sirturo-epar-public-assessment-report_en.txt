2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease to be treated 
About a third of the global population, more than 2 billion people, is infected with M. tuberculosis, 
of which the majority is latent.  
The life time risk to fall ill in overt TB is around 10% in general, but many times higher (around 10% 
annual risk) in untreated HIV-positive individuals.  Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in the 
latter  population.  It  was  estimated  that  a  total  of  8.8  million  new  TB  cases  occurred  in  2010, 
including 1.1 million people co infected with HIV, and that about 1.45 million people died due to TB.  
During more recent years the burden of TB resistant to first line therapy has increased rapidly. Such 
multidrug resistant tuberculosis (defined later in this assessment report) has been reported in all 
regions of the world. Presently around 500.000 of new MDR cases are estimated to emerge every 
year, which is close to 5% of all new TB cases. China and India carried nearly 50% of the total 
burden of incident MDR-TB cases in 2008, followed by the Russian Federation (9%). The incidence 
of  MDR-TB  in  US  and  EU  was  reported  to  be  1.1%  and  2.4%,  respectively.  Within  the  EU,  the 
incidence is much higher in certain Eastern European countries, with the largest burden in Romania, 
Latvia and Lithuania.  
MDR TB is an orphan disease in the EU, US and in Japan. 
Current TB therapy and definitions 
Treatment of pulmonary drug susceptible TB typically takes 6 months resulting in cure rates in well 
over 90% of cases with good treatment adherence. The two most important drugs in this treatment 
are isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF). 
TB with resistance to at least both INH and RIF is called multidrug resistant (MDR) TB. The two most 
important  “classes”  of  second-line  TB  drugs  to  be  used  in  such  cases  are  injectable  drugs  (the 
aminoglycosides  amikacin  and  kanamycin,  and 
the  related  agent  capreomycin)  and 
fluoroquinolones. Apart from these agents a number of miscellaneous drugs are used in addition, as 
part  of  combination  therapy.  The  effectiveness  of  these  latter  miscellaneous  drugs  is  generally 
lower, the tolerability is problematic and established breakpoints for resistance determination are 
lacking.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 11/108 
 
  
  
 
The term pre-XDR (pre-extensively drug resistant) TB is used when resistance is present also to one 
of the two main second-line class agents (injectables or any of the fluoroquinolones), and XDR-TB 
when resistance is present to INH+RIF + injectables + fluoroquinolones. 
The WHO standard treatment for MDR-TB is commonly divided into 2 phases:  
• 
• 
a 4 to 6-month intensive treatment phase in which an injectable drug plus 3-4 other drugs, 
including a fluoroquinolone,  
a continuation phase without the injectable drug and often without pyrazinamide (PZA) for 
a total duration of 18-24 months. 
Using this approach, cure rates in MDR-TB are much lower than those seen in DS-TB (ranging from 
less than 50% to around 75%), despite the higher number of agents and longer treatment duration. 
Hence, MDR TB is associated with a high mortality and is considered an important major threat to 
public health.  
More  recent  approaches  to  evaluate  various  MDR  TB  regimens  have  yielded  somewhat  more 
optimistic outcomes, despite shorter treatment durations. In these non-randomised studies (with  
low  number  of  patients)  cure  rates  in  the  range  of  90%  were  achieved  by  including  a  fourth 
generation fluoroquinolone and by increasing the number of agents even further, to include up to 7 
agents in the intensive phase, and still 4-5 agents in a second phase.   
2.1.2.  About the product 
SIRTURO (bedaquiline, formerly known as TMC 207) is a new agent of a unique class, specific for 
mycobacteria, and seemingly without cross-resistance to available TB agents. A large number of 
pre-clinical  studies  showed  promising  results  for  bedaquiline.  For  example,  in  animal  models 
bedaquiline + pyrazinamide cured TB at a higher rate than the traditional first line combination, 
even when therapy was shortened for the former combination. 
The clinical program for bedaquiline has been aimed at treating MDR-TB, and data is now available 
from phase 2b studies of moderate size, both placebo-controlled and non-controlled studies. The 
treatments given in these studies were similar to those recommended by the WHO, although the 
number of agents  used  was slightly higher  (five agents in the preferred background regimens). 
Bedaquiline  (versus  placebo  in  the  controlled  study)  was  added  during  the  first  (intensive) 
treatment  phase,  while  the  background  regimens  were  generally  unchanged  throughout  the 
complete course of therapy (18-24 months).  
On the basis of these studies, the applicant submitted an application for a conditional approval for 
bedaquiline,  with  the  proposed  indication:  treatment  of  adult  patients  infected  with  pulmonary 
tuberculosis due to MDR M. tuberculosis, as part of combination therapy.  
In line with the approach in the phase 2 studies, Sirturo is only to be used during the first 6 months 
of therapy. 
However the planned pivotal study (as a specific obligation) will test for 40 weeks of bedaquiline 
treatment.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
SIRTURO is presented as tablets containing 100 mg of bedaquiline, in the form of fumarate salt, as 
the active substance. The tablets are uncoated, white to almost white round and biconvex, 11 mm 
in diameter, with debossing of "T" over "207" on one side and "100" on the other side. 
Excipients used in the preparation of SIRTURO tablets include lactose monohydrate, maize starch, 
hypromellose,  polysorbate  20,  microcrystalline  cellulose,  croscarmellose  sodium,  anhydrous 
colloidal silica and magnesium stearate. 
The  tablets  are  packed  in  high  density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  bottles  fitted  with  child  resistant 
polypropylene (PP) closure with aluminium seal liner. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Bedaquiline  (INN)  is  chemically  designated  as  (1R,2S)-1-(6-bromo-2-methoxy-3-quinolinyl)-4- 
(dimethylamino)-2-(1-naphthalenyl)-1-phenyl-2-butanol  with  fumaric  acid  (1:1),  and  has  the 
following structure: 
Bedaquiline fumarate is a white to almost white powder. It contains two asymmetric carbon atoms, 
C-1  (R),  C-2  (S)  and  exhibits  ability  to  rotate  the  orientation  of  linearly  polarized  light  (optical 
rotation). The substance is non-hygroscopic. It is practically insoluble in aqueous media over a wide 
pH range and very slightly soluble in 0.01 N HCl. The substance is soluble in a variety of organic 
solvents. Due to the low solubility Log KD (log P) could not be determined experimentally. 
In Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) bedaquiline is classified as a Class 2 compound 
(expressing low solubility and high permeability). 
Bedaquiline  exists  in  only  one  non-solvated  crystalline  form:  Form  A.  In  addition  2 
pseudopoly-morphs were found: Form B and Form C. The substance can also be made amorphous. 
Sufficient  evidence  was  provided  to  demonstrate  that  Form  A  is  obtained  by  the  employed 
manufacturing process of the active substance. 
Particle size was considered a critical quality attribute of the active substance as bedaquiline is not 
dissolved  in  the  dosage  form.  Therefore  an  appropriate  test  on  particle  size  determination  was 
included  in  the  active  substance  specification.  The  acceptance  criteria  are  based  upon  the 
capabilities of the milling process, batch and stability data, and the known impact of the particle size 
on manufacturability, in-vitro release, and in-vivo performance.

Manufacture 
During development, the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the active substance were established 
based on the potential to impact the performance and manufacturability of the finished product and 
these include impurities (organic, inorganic and stereoisomeric impurities, residual solvents) and 
particle size. Process development efforts have focused on the identification and control of active 
substance CQAs and the  Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) that impact them. The  CQAs of the 
active substance requiring investigation have been determined and an appropriate control strategy 
for the manufacturing process has been employed. 
The  synthesis  of  bedaquiline  involves  four  steps  which  consist  of  one  synthetic  coupling  step 
resulting in a mixture of stereoisomers followed by purification by a controlled crystallization using 
enantiomeric organophosphate and formation of the fumaric salt. Subsequently the substance is 
milled.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been  suitably  described  in  flow  charts  and  a  narrative 
description.  The  length  of  the  synthesis  was  justified  in  terms  of  control  of  purity  profile  of  the 
starting materials. Only single synthetic coupling step is involved in the synthesis and the applicant 
has  provided  extensive  evidence  supporting  the  use  of  the  proposed  starting  materials.  The 
proposed starting materials constitute major structural fragments of the final active substance and 
the  synthetic  steps  to  form  the  starting  materials  are  non-critical  and  non-complex  organic 
reactions.  The  proposed  process  is  robust  enough  to  control  the  stereochemistry  of  the  active 
substance. Furthermore the introduction of stereochemistry is part of the GMP-controlled process. 
The synthetic path has high purifying capacity and the analytical methods employed are capable of 
detecting impurities even with structures very similar to the intermediate or final active substance. 
The  purifying  capacity  has  also  been  demonstrated  by  extensive  spiking  experiments.  Steps  in 
which  genotoxic  impurities  may  be  formed  are  included  in  the  GMP-controlled  process.  The 
potential genotoxicity has been evaluated in-silico for impurities originating from up streams of the 
proposed starting materials and no structural alerts were identified.  
Potential impurities have been well discussed in relation to their origin (raw material, manufacturing 
process and degradation products) and potential carry-over into the final active substance. The fate 
of the impurities was studied by spiking the intermediates with known amounts of the impurities 
and performing the standard processes to obtain the non-milled drug substance. Impurities derived 
from starting materials as well as process impurities formed in the manufacturing process have 
been  demonstrated  to  be  sufficiently  controlled  by  the  applied  analytical  methods,  the 
specifications, and the manufacturing process. 
The possibility of genotoxic impurities was also addressed during the development. All impurities 
were assessed regarding their genotoxic potential, in addition to all intermediates, solvents and 
reagents used in the synthesis. None of the structures assessed resulted in a positive. No potential 
genotoxic impurities were found. 
In general, sufficient information regarding the manufacturing process, starting materials, critical 
steps and intermediates, process validation and manufacturing process development have been 
provided. The synthesis and process parameters have been well characterised and described.  
Confirmation  of  the  chemical  structure  of  bedaquiline  was  provided  by  elemental  analysis 
(confirmation  of  the  determined  elementary  composition),  spectroscopic  methods  as  UV, 
IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR as well as by mass spectral (MS) analysis.

An extensive polymorphism screening study has been performed in order to identify all polymorphic 
forms of the active substance. A series of crystallization experiments were conducted using various 
solvents covering a broad range of solvent properties such as polarity, hydrogen bond donor and 
acceptor propensity, dielectric constant, and other parameters. Different crystallization approaches 
were  applied.  The  main  approaches  were  crystallization  experiments,  evaporation  tests, 
precipitation with anti-solvent, and slurry experiments. It was found that the bedaquiline exists in 
only one non-solvated crystalline form: Form A. This form was obtained in most of the experiments 
of the polymorph screening. All manufactured batches produced only Form A. No evidence for the 
presence  of  the  other  crystalline  form  or  amorphous  form  was  found.  The  synthesis  process 
consistently  produces  Form  A.  The  stability  of  Form  A  has  been  demonstrated  by  monitoring  it 
during stability studies. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR), assay (HPLC), 
chromatographic  purity  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  residue  on  ignition,  heavy  metals  and 
particle size (laser diffraction). 
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  shown  to  consistently  produce  polymorphic  Form  A  (17 
batches tested) and no changes in the polymorphic form have been observed in the stability study. 
A test for the polymorphic form was therefore excluded from the active substance specification. 
A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Complete method validation data 
was provided for the non compendial (in-house) analytical methods. 
In general specification limits and analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of 
the active substance.  
Batch analysis results for bedaquiline have been presented. All batches were manufactured by the 
proposed  commercial  manufacturers  according  to  the  proposed  process.  Batches  were  used  in 
clinical studies, stability studies and process validation. In total 17 batches of bedaquiline have been 
manufactured and tested during the development phase. All batches showed comparable impurity 
profile.  In  addition,  batch  results  were  presented  for  batches  manufactured  using  different 
synthesis methods used in earlier steps of the development. It can be concluded that the batch 
analysis results indicate that the manufacturing process is reproducible and under control. 
Stability 
Stability studies according to ICH guidelines have been initiated on commercial scale batches of the 
active  substance  stored  in  the  commercial  packaging.  Long-term  (30°C/65% RH),  accelerated 
(40°C/75% RH), and stress stability studies are being conducted on the 3 primary stability batches 
and 5 process validation batches manufactured at by the final synthesis method. The stability study 
for batches already put on stability is planned for 60 months for the three process validation batches 
and 36 months for the other batches.  
Stability  testing  for  bedaquiline  included  also  forced  degradation  study.  The  forced  degradation 
study  included  testing  the  effects  of  thermal  oxidation,  thermal  acidic,  neutral  and  alkaline 
conditions, photolysis and solvolysis. The study revealed that the substance is extremely unstable 
under basic conditions and prone to significant breakdown under neutral and acidic conditions and

in  ethanol.  The  substance  is  also  prone  to  significant  degradation  under  H2O2  conditions. 
Bedaquiline is only slightly sensitive to photolysis.  
All  results  reported  are  within  proposed  specifications.  No  trends  are  seen  in  the  primary  and 
supportive studies. The post-approval stability protocol is acceptable and a sufficient number of 
batches from the supply chains will be added to the program. 
Based  on  the  available  stability  data,  bedaquiline  showed  to  be  a  stable  when  packaged  in  the 
proposed container closure system. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain a solid, oral dosage form that  would 
deliver the required dose of the active substance. 
Several  variants  of  the  active  substance  have  been  investigated  with  respect  to  solubility  and 
stability:  salt  form,  polymorphism  and  particle  size.  The  fumarate  salt  was  selected  for  further 
development, taking into account its solubility, toxicity and manufacturability. 
Several finished product formulations were investigated in the early development phase. For the 
initial clinical studies 2 aqueous oral solutions of different strength were developed. Subsequently, 
2 prototype immediate release oral solid dosage forms (capsule and tablet) were developed and 
compared to solution in a relative bioavailability study. This led to the selection of the tablet for 
further clinical investigation and for commercialisation.  
The development of the tablet formulation followed a classic development approach and adopted 
elements of QbD methodology. An in-depth understanding of the effects of formula components, 
process  intermediates  and  process  parameters  was  obtained  from  design  of  experiment  studies 
(DoEs)  and  scale-up  studies.  Based  on  these  studies,  appropriate  control  strategy  has  been 
implemented to mitigate the risks identified initially and to ensure that the characteristics specified 
in the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) will be met consistently.  
The manufacturing process development has been well documented. The applicant also followed an 
enhanced approach to development of the manufacturing process. Laboratory scale process was 
optimised for commercial production by the manufacturing of 2 characterization batches and a full 
factorial design of experiments (DoE) study at full scale. A criticality analysis (CA) was performed to 
assess the manufacturing process. This included the identification of the critical quality attributes 
(CQAs), determination of critical process parameters (CPPs) and the design of an effective control 
strategy. Process steps and parameters, including assessment of in-process controls (IPCs) that 
affect the CQAs of the finished product were identified. Furthermore experience gained from the 
manufacture of these batches was used to set appropriate process parameters. Based on the results 
obtained  proven  acceptable  ranges  (PARs)  have  been  proposed  for  several  critical  process 
parameters (CPPs), but no target values. The PARs are wider than what is normally acceptable in 
strictly  traditional  process  descriptions,  based  on  a  traditional  approach  to  pharmaceutical 
development.  However,  no  design  space  has  been  claimed.  Consequently,  the  manufacturing 
process of the finished product is expected to run within the approved ranges and with traditional 
control strategy (including in-process controls. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014

The  DoE  study  was  conducted  to  investigate  the  criticality  of  granulation,  blending,  and 
compression. From the granulation study it was evident that the granulation conditions influence 
the  granule  particle  size  distribution.  However,  conclusions  regarding  the  suitability  of  the 
granulation  parameters,  and  the  resulting  chemical  and  physical  characteristics  of  the  granules 
could only be made after blending and tablet compression. In the blending study the parameters 
selected for the study resulted in acceptable content uniformity for the final blends. Tablets from all 
final blends were compressed at different compression forces and different table speeds and the 
effect  on  tablet  weight,  hardness,  thickness,  disintegration  time,  friability,  and  dissolution  was 
investigated. The choice of the process was considered justified and the critical process parameters 
and  process  equipment  were  generally  satisfactorily  identified.  It  has  been  shown  that  the 
manufacturing process was robust. 
It can be concluded that the formulation development of the product was satisfactorily described. 
The key critical parameters were identified and successfully evaluated. 
Adventitious agents 
It  has  been  certified  by  the  supplier  that  lactose  is  produced  in  compliance  with  the  Note  for 
Guidance on Minimising the Risk of  Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents  via 
Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products”. Lactose is produced from milk obtained from healthy 
cattle under the same conditions as milk intended for human consumption. 
Magnesium  stearate  is  of  vegetal  origin  and  relevant  certificates  from  manufacturers  of  this 
excipient have been provided. 
Manufacture of the product 
Standard process is employed for the manufacture of SIRTURO tablets. The manufacturing process 
comprises a conventional wet granulation followed by compression. No intermediates are isolated 
during the process.  
Overall, description of the manufacturing process was adequate. Critical steps have been identified 
and properly evaluated at the commercial scale. The reproducibility of the process has been suitably 
demonstrated during the development. 
Formal  validation  will  be  performed  post-approval  on  the  first  three  consecutive  commercial 
batches, prior to launching the product. An acceptable validation plan has been provided. Since the 
process has been extensively evaluated and the critical process parameters for the process have 
been identified and characterised at full scale it was considered sufficient to provide a validation 
plan and perform the validation post-approval. 
Product specification 
The finished product is controlled by testing attributes relevant for this dosage form. The finished 
product  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identity  of  the  active  (IR  and  HPLC),  assay 
(HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units, dissolution and microbial purity.  
The proposed specifications were justified based on the batch and stability results and are generally 
adequate for assuring the product quality and therefore were accepted.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014

A  detailed  description  for  all  analytical  methods  was  provided.  Full  method  validation  data  was 
provided for the non compendial (in-house) analytical methods.  
Batch results are provided for 4 production scale batches and 15 pilot scale batches used in clinical 
studies,  process  development  studies  and  primary  stability  studies.  Batch  analysis  results 
demonstrated  compliance  with  the  proposed  specifications  and  confirmed  consistency  and 
uniformity  of  the  product.  The  results  were  consistent  from  batch  to batch  and  proved that  the 
product can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been initiated according to ICH guidelines on 3 pilot scale and 4 production 
scale batches of the finished product packaged in its commercial packaging. Data were provided 
from six months of accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH), six months of intermediate conditions 
(30°C/75% RH) and 12 months of long term conditions (25°C/60% RH). No significant changes or 
trends  in  any  of  the  parameters  monitored  have  been  seen  and  all  data  are  within  proposed 
specifications. 
In addition force degradation studies have been included in the stability programme. The forced 
degradation  study  included  testing  the  effects  of  thermal  oxidation,  thermal  acidic,  neutral  and 
alkaline conditions and photolysis on the finished product. 
The  results  of  the  forced  degradation  study  show  that  in  acidic  medium,  a  similar  extent  of 
degradation  is  obtained  for  both  active  substance  and  finished  product.  Under  neutral  and  in 
particular under basic conditions, however, the extent of degradation for the finished product is 
much lower than for the active substance. The same is observed under oxidative conditions (H2O2) 
where  the  product  was  found  much  less  sensitive  for  oxidation  than  the  substance.  Under  light 
conditions a photolytic degradation is observed but there is no significant difference in sensitivity 
between the finished product and the active substance. No additional forced degradation products 
were observed for the finished product in comparison with the active substance. 
The overall stability data showed that SIRTURO tablets were stable under all tested conditions. The 
results generated during the stability studies support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions 
as defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The information provided about the active substance, bedaquiline, was of acceptable quality. In 
general sufficient information regarding the manufacturing process, materials,  critical steps and 
intermediates,  process  validation  and  manufacturing  process  development  have  been  provided. 
The synthesis and process parameters have been well characterised and described.  
Specification  limits  and  analytical  methods  are  suitable  to  control  the  quality  of  the  active 
substance.  
A retest period was supported by satisfactory stability studies which show that the active substance 
is stable.  
The finished product is an immediate release uncoated tablets containing 100 mg of bedaquiline. 
The  development  pharmaceutics  has  been  satisfactorily  described.  The  excipients  are  well

established and used in acceptable quantities. Their function has been satisfactorily described. The 
formulation is considered satisfactorily justified.  
The method of manufacture is considered standard and has been satisfactorily described, including 
in-process  tests.  The  data  shows  consistent  manufacture  and  is  considered  sufficient  for  this 
manufacturing process. A satisfactory validation protocol has been provided. 
The  proposed  specifications  were  justified  based  on  the  batch  and  stability  results,  and  are  in 
general adequate for assuring the product quality and therefore were accepted.  
The  stability  program  is  considered  satisfactory.  The  batches  placed  on  stability  are  considered 
representative of the product to be marketed. The results generated during the stability studies 
support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The  active  substance  (bedaquiline)  and  the  finished  product  (tablets  100 mg)  have  been 
appropriately  characterised  and  generally  satisfactory  documentation  has  been  provided.  The 
results indicate that bedaquiline as well as the tablets can be reproducibly manufactured. Therefore 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The applicant has conducted studies of bactericidal and sterilizing activity of bedaquiline in murine 
and  guinea  pig  models  of  tuberculosis  infection.  In  these  animal  models,  bedaquiline  showed 
bactericidal and sterilizing activity in TB infected mice and guinea pigs, alone and in combination 
with several DS and MDR-TB regimens. Bedaquiline showed selectivity towards ATP synthase in 
mycobacteria  compared  to  ATP  synthase  from  a  human  cancer  cell  line.  In  isolated  human 
mitochondria,  nano-molar  concentrations  of  bedaquiline  had  no  effect  on  ATP  synthesis,  while 
concentrations of 100 μM bedaquiline lead to approximately 30 % inhibition. The in vitro potency of 
the  major  metabolites  M2  and  M3  were  about  5-  and  187-fold  less  than  that  of  bedaquiline, 
respectively.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 19/108 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
In  a  secondary  pharmacodynamics  study  bedaquiline  showed  interaction  with  histamine-2 
receptors  (87%),  sodium  channel  (71%)  and  dopamine  transporters  (54%)  whereas  low 
interaction  potential  was  observed  with  any  of  the  other  receptors  or  transporter  binding  sites 
tested  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  adenosine,  adrenergic,  angiotensin,  cholecystokinin, 
dopamine, endothelin, muscarinic, neurokinin, opioid, serotonin, vasopressin receptors or calcium, 
potassium, chloride channels or norepinephrine transporters). The potential clinical impact of the 
observed interaction with histamine2 receptors, sodium channels and dopamine transporters was 
discussed by CHMP. It was agreed that taken together studies both in vitro and in vivo indicated 
that  bedaquiline  had  a  potential  to  adversely  affect  the  cardiovascular  system  both  at  the 
electrophysiological  and  the  histological  level  and  that  any  interference  by  bedaquiline  with 
dopamine  transporters  appears  unlikely  to  have  any  clinical  relevance.  At  therapeutic  doses, 
electrophysiological  effects  of  sodium  channel  blockade  and  the  interaction  potential  with 
histamine2 receptors, are expected to be limited with no functional consequences. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The standard battery of cardiovascular safety studies showed a concentration- dependent inhibition 
of bedaquiline and M2 on the rapidly activating rectifying potassium current (IKr) from 0.03 μM to 
3 μM with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.37 μM (0.2 μg/mL) for bedaquiline and 0.45 
μM (0.24 μg/mL) for M2. Inhibition of the slowly activating rectifying potassium current (IKs) was 
observed up to 32% for bedaquiline starting from 0.003 μM (0.002 μg/mL), and up to 37% for M2 
starting from 0.3 μM (0.17 μg/mL). In these in vitro studies, analyses of the solutions revealed a 
low to very low recovery (51-0.5%) of locally applied bedaquiline concentrations. In conclusion, 
bedaquiline and M2 showed inhibitory effects on cardiac potassium currents in the hERG assay at 
low  concentrations.  The  actual  inhibitory  concentrations  could  not  be  determined  from  these 
studies. 
There were no relevant effects on the duration of the PQ and QRS interval of the ECG or on the ECG 
morphology in anesthetized guinea pigs, but the heart rate was increased and the duration of QT 
and QTc was decreased. 
Bedaquiline had no effects on cardiovascular parameters at a single oral dose of 20 mg/kg (plasma 
conc. 1757 ng/ml) in a preliminary non-GLP study in telemetered dogs. In the pivotal study, at 
single oral doses up to 160 mg/kg, bedaquiline had no effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The 
electrocardiogram was unchanged at 10 mg/kg, but at 40 and 160 mg/kg a marginal shortening of 
the P-Q interval and a slight increase in P-wave duration was observed. Plasma levels at 6h were 
0.8, 1.8 and 4.9 µg/ml, respectively.  However, the results from these single dose studies may not 
be predictive for the potential cardiovascular effects in the clinical situation since the concentrations 
of bedaquiline and its metabolites build up over time after repeated administration due to the very 
long elimination half-lives. Cardiovascular parameters were also monitored in the repeated dose 
toxicity studies as well as in the clinical studies. The possible “multi-ion channel” blocking properties 
of bedaquiline and its metabolite M2 as indicated by the studies in isolated hearts and by the in vivo 
studies performed in guinea pigs and dogs have been discussed and while a proarrhythmic potential 
cannot  be  excluded  at  therapeutic  doses,  the  agreed  Sirturo  Summary  of  the  Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) provides adequate guidance to the prescribers on the issue. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014

Cardiovascular effects in combination with moxifloxacin (with known cardiovascular effects) were 
investigated in telemetered dogs.  Following 6 days of bedaquiline administration, a slightly higher 
increase in  QT  and  QTc  intervals  was  observed  following  the  combination  administration  of 
bedaquiline  with  moxifloxacin  than  in  animals  administered  moxifloxacin  alone.  This  could 
potentially indicate a cardiovascular effect of bedaquiline in combination with moxifloxacin.  
Bedaquiline  tested  up  to  a  maximum  plasma  concentration  of  4.9  μg/mL  in  telemetered 
dogs showed no potential to affect the measured respiratory parameters and did not influence the 
locomotor activity.  
Bedaquiline had no CNS effects in a modified Irving test in rats at doses up to 200 mg/kg (Cmax 3.3 
µg/ml, AUC was 132 µg.h/mL). Dosing at 800 mg/kg led to slight behavioral effects as evidenced 
by  an  increased  locomotor  activity  and aberrant  motor-affective  and  sensori-motor  responses. 
Overall, bedaquiline has a low potential for pulmonary or nervous system effects.  
All in vitro safety pharmacology studies with bedaquiline and M2, and two of the in vivo studies were 
not conducted according to GLP standards. The applicant has adequately justified the lack of GLP 
compliance in the pivotal safety pharmacology studies. Furthermore, the actual concentrations of 
bedaquiline  and  M2  in  several  of  the  in  vitro  studies  were  significantly  lower  than  intended. 
However, in most cases in vivo data are available that corroborate the in vitro results. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
In vitro interactions of bedaquiline with other anti-TB drugs have not been studied. Instead, a series 
of  animal  experiments  were  conducted  where  bedaquiline  was  administered  with  various 
combinations of anti-TB drugs. 
In the murine model of established TB infection (treatment starts approximately 2 weeks after TB 
infection),  bedaquiline  (25  mg/kg)  as  monotherapy  was  at  least  as  bactericidal  as  the  first-line 
triple combination therapy (i.e., R + INH + PZA) and more active than R alone. 
Furthermore, when added to the first-line triple combination therapy (R + INH + PZA) for DS-TB, 
bedaquiline at 25 mg/kg resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial load in the lungs (relative to the 
standard R + INH + PZA treatment regimen) by 2 log units after 1 month of therapy and by a further 
1  log  unit  after  2  months  of  therapy  (p  <  0.0018  in  both  cases).  When  substituting  one  of  the 
first-line drugs of the R + INH + PZA combination with bedaquiline (25 mg/kg), the activity of each 
regimen was significantly better than that of R + INH + PZA, particularly after 1 month of treatment 
(p < 0.0018). 
Sterilizing activity of bedaquiline in combination with first-line anti-TB drugs 
Swiss  mice  intravenously  inoculated  with  M.  tuberculosis  strain  H37Rv  (established  infection 
model),  were  treated  with  bedaquiline-containing  regimens,  and  followed  for  3  more  months 
without treatment to determine relapse rates.  
Quantitative lung and spleen CFU counts at the end of therapy and relapse rates 3 months after the 
end of therapy were compared for various regimens.

Most  mice  became  culture  negative  after  just  2  or  3  months  of  treatment  with  bedaquiline 
containing regimens. The relapse rate was lower after 4 months of R + INH + PZA + bedaquiline 
compared to 4 months with a regimen that was so far described to be the most active in mice (R + 
MXF + PZA). 
Bactericidal activity of bedaquiline in combination with second-line anti-TB drugs 
Mice were infected drug sensitive H37Rv strain of M. tuberculosis (established infection model) and 
treated 5 times per week with bedaquiline alone or with bedaquiline combined with first-line anti-TB 
drugs  (R-INH-PZA)  or  with  various  combinations  of  second-line  anti-TB  drugs.  Bedaquiline 
accelerated the bactericidal activity of the drug regimens.

These observations in mice may suggest that bedaquiline-containing MDR-TB regimens could have 
the potential to significantly shorten treatment duration, similar to what was seen when bedaquiline 
was added to the first-line regimen R + INH + PZA. 
Mice were given 12.5 and 25 mg/kg in these studies.  
When comparing steady state exposures in mice dosed 20 mg/kg, and the exposure in patients 
dosed bedaquiline 200 mg t.i.w. (end of C208 stage 1), the mice/human ratios for bedaquiline AUC 
and Cmax were 0.3.  Same ratios for M2 were around 4. MICs for M2 are around 4-6 times higher 
than for the parent compound.  
In vivo synergy of bedaquiline with pyrazinamide 
Further studies in mice indicate a synergistic effect with PZA: 
Mice were infected and treated 2 weeks later with a daily treatment (5 days per week) for 2 months. 
R + INH + PZA did not lead to clearance of the lung. Bedaquiline monotherapy was able to convert 
22%  of  the  mouse  cultures.  When  PZA  was  combined  with  bedaquiline,  all  mice  were  culture 
negative after 2 months of treatment, table next page.  
In  each  treatment  group,  10  mice  were  sacrificed  after  1  month  of  treatment,  and  10  were 
sacrificed after 2 months of treatment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bedaquiline is a poorly soluble drug substance that has low apparent permeability across Caco-2 
cell monolayers but can be considered as a moderate to high permeability compound since it is well 
absorbed in preclinical species. 
After single IV administration, bedaquiline displayed slow kinetics. In dogs, it was slowly eliminated 
from  plasma  with  a  clearance  about  19-fold  lower  than  the  hepatic  blood  flow,  and  it  was

extensively distributed to tissues with a volume of distribution about 60-fold higher than the total 
body water.  
After a single PO administration in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, maximum concentrations were 
observed between 0.5 h and 8 h after dosing with low doses, while absorption was slower at higher 
doses. The plasma concentration-time profiles of bedaquiline showed a multi-phasic decline with a 
long terminal elimination t1/2 ranging from 2 to 3 days in mice, 3 to 5 days in male rats, 6 to 9 days 
in  female  rats  and  monkeys  and  up  to  50  days  in  dogs.  In  dogs,  there  was  evidence  that 
steady-state was reached at Week 13 in most cases. The exposure to bedaquiline and M2 (Cmax 
and AUC0-24h) increased  dose proportionally or less than dose proportionally in mice, rats and 
dogs.  
The bioavailability after a single bedaquiline dose was 36%, 40% and 79% in the dog, monkey and 
rat, respectively. After a single dose the mean AUC0-24h of the major metabolite M2 was 2 to 7-fold 
higher than AUC0-24h of bedaquiline in mice and was generally similar to 2-fold lower in rats and 
dogs. 
The total radioactivity was widely distributed to the tissues in pigmented rats and monkeys after 
single PO administration of 14C-bedaquiline. High tissue concentrations (AUC-T/B or AUC-T/P ratios 
generally between 20 and 100) were associated with the adrenal gland, lung, spleen and liver. The 
decline of the concentrations of TR in most tissues and plasma was parallel, indicating that there 
was no undue retention. Brain tissue uptake was low compared to other tissues, with AUC-T/B or 
AUC-T/P ratios generally below or close to 1. In pregnant rats, distribution to the placenta and the 
foetus was moderate to low, AUC values for the placenta and the foetus being 3-fold and 0.4-fold 
the  AUC  value  for  the  maternal  blood,  respectively.  Following  repeated  PO  administration  of 
bedaquiline to mice, rats and dogs, the bedaquiline trough concentration T/P ratios were above 30 
in lung, spleen, lymph nodes and thymus. The tissue concentrations of M2 were generally higher 
than those of bedaquiline.  
Bedaquiline  and  M2  were  extensively  bound  to  plasma  proteins  (99.9%)  in  mice,  rats,  dogs, 
monkeys, rabbits and humans. Distribution of the two compounds to blood cells appeared to be 
limited. 
No chiral conversion of bedaquiline occurred in vivo after administration of bedaquiline to mice, 
rats, dogs, monkeys and humans. In hepatocytes and subcellular fractions from preclinical species 
and humans, the in vitro metabolism of  14C-bedaquiline was via Phase I reactions and the most 
important pathway was N-demethylation to M2, which was followed by a second N-demethylation 
to M3, oxidation and epoxidation. M2 was the major circulating metabolite in all preclinical species 
as determined by radioactivity profiling and LC-MS/MS in the animals. No mass balance study with 
radiolabelled bedaquiline  has  been  conducted  in  humans.  It  can  therefore  not  be  excluded  that 
additional  undetected  metabolites  may  be  formed  in  humans  that  are  not  formed  in  the  animal 
species.  M2-AUC0-24h  plasma  levels  were  generally  comparable  to  2-fold  lower  than  those  of 
bedaquiline in rats and dogs upon repeated administration of bedaquiline, and 3.5- to 4.5-fold lower 
in human subjects with MDR-TB. In addition to M2 and M3, a hydroxylated derivative of M2 (M20) 
and a dihydrodiol derivative of M2 (M11), were detected in human plasma. These two metabolites 
were also found in rats and dogs at similar relative concentrations.  
In all preclinical species, the drug related material was slowly excreted, predominantly in faeces.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 24/108 
 
  
  
The milk concentrations of bedaquiline and M2 were 4 to 12-fold higher than the corresponding 
plasma  concentrations  in  milk  samples  collected  from  lactating  dams  in  a  pre-  and  post-natal 
development study in Sprague-Dawley rats. 
In conclusion, the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of bedaquiline in animals have 
been adequately investigated. The relevance of the animal species for safety testing is limited by 
the lack of adequate data on mass balance in humans. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The  toxicological  profile  of  bedaquiline  was  characterised  in  studies  in  mouse,  rat  and  dog.    In 
pivotal studies, rats were treated for 26 weeks and dog for 39 weeks followed by a 12-13 week 
treatment-free period to evaluate reversibility of the effects. Mice were generally a less appropriate 
species to use, due to their low tolerance to bedaquiline and to the high formation of M2. Maximum 
doses  used  were  around  25  mg/kg  in  rat  and  40/20  mg/kg  in  dog.    Studies  included  exposure 
determinations of parent compound as well as major metabolites M2 and M3.  In addition specific 
studies  were  conducted  to  address  local  tolerance,  mechanistic  aspects,  metabolite  toxicity, 
impurities and immunotoxicity. Overall the non-clinical characterisation of toxicological aspects of 
bedaquiline and metabolites is considered adequate and in line with relevant guidelines and where 
appropriate conducted in accordance with GLP principles, but some uncertainties as to the species 
used in the toxicological evaluations in terms of the level of predictivity persist in the absence of 
human mass balance data. 
Single dose toxicity 
In mouse and rat, single oral doses of 800 mg/kg produced lethality preceded by signs of general 
toxicity. Mortalities in mouse and dog after single and repeated doses were principally attributed to 
skeletal muscle/myocardial degeneration and/or pancreatitis. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Bedaquiline  and  the  M2  metabolite  are  cationic  amphiphilic  substances  (CADs)  and  induce 
phospholipidosis. The cells of the monocytic phagocytic system (MPS) are affected in all species. 
Data from in vitro studies using human monocyte cell-line indicated that the phospholipidogenic 
potential  was  highest  for  the  M2  metabolite  followed  by  M3  and  the  parent  compound.  Several 
mechanisms for phospholipidosis have been suggested and different inducing agents may interact 
with  different  putative  phospholipidosis-relevant  targets.  Although  frequently  described  as  an 
adaptive response tissue damage has been observed in association with phospholipidosis and the 
clinical significance of such findings are still largely unknown.  
Safety pharmacology studies in vitro showed that bedaquiline had the potential to inhibit Ikr and Iks 
and while no ECG abnormalities or prominent QT effects were recorded in short term dog studies QT 
prolongation was evident in a 2/6 month toxicity study in dog at 40/20mg/kg, but not in the 39 
week study at a dose of 18 mg/kg. Monitoring in clinical trials has also showed that QT effects may 
occur  with  treatment  with  bedaquiline  and  sections  of  the  SmPC  provide  information  and 
recommendations on these aspects. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014

In addition findings of myocardial degeneration/necrosis/fibrosis were reported in toxicity studies in 
dog. The possibility that this may relate to the primary pharmacological mode of action (inhibition 
of ATP synthase) would also be consistent with reports of pancreatitis in dog. Taken together the 
available  data,  including  electron  micrographs  of  various  tissues  do  not,  however,  indicate  any 
relevant potential for mitochondrial toxicity of bedaquiline. 
In  in  vivo  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  phospholipidosis  or  phospholipidosis-like  changes  (e.g. 
microvacuolation, foamy macrophages, histiocytosis, swollen macrophages, histiocytic infiltrates) 
were reported in liver (rat, dog), skeletal muscle (rat), lung (mouse, rat, dog), spleen (dog), kidney 
(mouse), pancreas (mouse) and thymus (dog). In general the doses at which phospholipidosis was 
evident corresponded to exposure ratios from <1, x2-x5 to x2-x9 (dog) the expected clinical value. 
Partial recovery was evident although changes were still present after up to a 12 week treatment 
free period. Considering phospholipidosis like changes in skeletal/striated muscle and changes in 
serum chemistry parameters such as increases in CK and ALP this could be interpreted as indicative 
of  a  possible  relation  between  induction  of phospholipidosis  and  functional  impairment.    The 
mechanism behind myopathy is, though, proposed to be related to interference with membrane 
function and not per se to phospholipidosis. 
The principal organs affected in most mouse studies were liver and skeletal muscle at exposure 
ratios to clinical levels of <1 for bedaquiline and x8 (males)-x5 (females) for the M2 metabolite. No 
relevant NOAELs in mouse studies were evident. The main target organs in rat were liver, skeletal 
muscle, lung, thyroid and kidney in longer term studies. Doses coupled to these changes provided 
exposure  ratios  relative  to  expected  human  of  approx.  <1  (males)-approx.  x2  (females)  for 
bedaquiline and  x3-6 for the M2 metabolite. In dog, organs/tissues  with findings included lung, 
heart, stomach, and pancreas at doses of 40/20 mg/kg corresponding to exposure ratios of x3-5 for 
bedaquiline and x6-10 for the M2 metabolite. At the NOAEL AUC ratios to expected clinical levels 
were <x1 for bedaquiline and approx. x2 for the M2 metabolite.  
In most repeated dose toxicity studies body weight and/or body weight gains were decreased with 
treatment with bedaquiline. 
Overall a range of organs/tissues showed various histopathological alterations after treatment with 
bedaquiline: 
• 
Liver:  mouse,  rat,  dog-phospholipidosis,  hypertrophy,  necrosis,  degeneration  bile  duct 
epithelium (dog).  Hypertrophy showed reversibility after a 3 month treatment free period. 
The lowest doses associated with liver changes corresponded to exposure multiples lower 
or approx.  1 compared with expected human values, except in dog were ratios of 5 to 6 
were calculated. Occasionally liver changes were coupled to increases in liver enzymes such 
as AST and ALP.   
• 
Pancreas: mouse, dog-phospholipidosis, necrotic cells, inflammation. In mouse, but not in 
dog, minor effects on amylase and lipase were recorded. The lowest doses associated with 
pancreatic changes corresponded to exposure multiples lower than 1 in mouse and <1 to 3 
in dog compared with expected human values. Recovery during a 13 week treatment free 
period appeared incomplete. 
•  Stomach: mouse, dog. Degenerative changes (fundic glands), necrosis.  At high doses in 
dogs, inflammatory infiltrates and signs of phospholipidosis were evident. Stomach lesions 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 26/108 
 
  
  
showed incomplete reversibility after a treatment free period.  The lowest doses associated 
with stomach lesions corresponded to exposure multiples lower than 1 in mouse and 1 to 5 
in dog compared with expected human values. 
•  Striated muscle: mouse, rat, dog. Tongue: degenerative, necrotic changes, muscle fibre 
degeneration,  histiocytosis  (mouse,  rat,  dog);  quadriceps,  psoas  muscle;  myopathy, 
muscle  cell  degeneration,  fibriohistiocytic  infiltrates  (rat,  dog).  Heart:  degeneration  of 
cardiomyocytes, fibrosis, necrosis (dog). In the 2/6 month dog study where doses were 
lowered from 40 to 20 mg/kg after 2 months QT/QTc interval, total CK, cTnI and myoglobin 
were increased in relation to sings of cardiac degeneration/necrosis. Doses corresponded to 
multiples of 5-6 the expected human exposure. Following treatment free periods there were 
signs of recovery. 
• 
Thyroid: rat-hypertrophy follicular epithelium. Full recovery of this change was observed.  
In separate studies it was shown that thyroxine uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase 
(UDP-GT) was induced by bedaquiline and the change was considered to result from liver 
enzyme induction ultimately leading to stimulation of the thyroid. The clinical relevance of 
the findings seems low taking into account that changes were only noted in rat, a species 
that is more responsive to hormonal imbalances than human. In addition reversibility was 
evident. 
•  Genital  tract:  mouse,  dog-granulocytic  infiltrates,  necrosis  of  corpora  lutea.  In  addition 
tubular atrophy was noted in testes in dog at doses starting from 10 mg/kg, corresponding 
to exposure multiples of 2 to 3 compared with human exposure.   
•  Spleen: mouse-red pulp hyperplasia (mouse) 
• 
Eye: dog-conjunctivitis, corneal opacities, intolerance to bright light at high doses. Tissue 
distribution studies in rat showed high distribution of radioactivity to the uveal tract. 
•  Kidney:  rat-basophilia/nephropathy.  Changes  in  calcium  (increases)  and  phosphate 
(decreases) levels appeared related to this finding that was only seen in rat and may have 
reflected an exacerbation of existing susceptibility to kidney effects.  
Haematology data showed decreases in haemoglobin, haematocrit and increases in reticulocytes 
primarily in mouse and rat. Clinical chemistry indicated increases in creatinine kinase and AST in 
mouse,  increases  in  cholesterol,  BUN,  glucose,  CK  and  decreases  in  lymphocytes  and  inorganic 
phosphate in rat. In dog ALT, AST, ALT, thrombocytes and fibrinogen as well as cTnI and myoglobin 
were increased.  
There were no major differences in target organ toxicity between juvenile and adult rats and no 
additional toxicity was identified in the juvenile rat. However, in the juvenile rat an observation of 
males  with  small  flaccid  testes/small  epididymides  was  recorded  but  likely  was  not  treatment 
related. 
Genotoxicity 
Bedaquiline tested negative for genotoxic potential in standard in vitro and in vivo tests including 
Salmonella typhimurium, mouse lymphoma and mouse micronucleus test. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 27/108 
 
  
  
Carcinogenicity 
Long term carcinogenicity studies in Sprague-Dawley rats are ongoing.  It was clarified that the 
report writing of the carcinogenicity study in the rat (bedaquiline-NC112) is ongoing and will be 
submitted when completed. Due to poor tolerability of bedaquiline in mouse, likely reflecting high 
formation  of  the  more  cytotoxic  M2  metabolite  and  resulting  in  low  exposure  levels  to  parent 
compound relative to expected humans, a carcinogenicity study in mouse is not being conducted. 
CHMP concurred with this approach. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The  potential  for  reproduction  toxicity  was  investigated  in  rat  and  rabbit  in  studies  covering  all 
stages of the reproductive process. Bedaquiline had no effect on fertility in females up to the highest 
dose tested, 24 mg/kg. Male fertility appeared to be decreased with a NOAEL of 5 mg/kg. Relevant 
information is included in the Sirturo SmPC section 5.3. 
In addition in a 6-week dog study phospholipidosis like changes in testes were recorded, but the 
relevance of this finding for fertility seems to be of minor significance. The testicular Sertoli cells 
which are part of the MPS are known to be susceptible to phospholipidosis.  
In  embryofoetal  toxicity  studies  conducted  in  rat  and  rabbit  bedaquiline  appeared  to  have  no 
adverse effects on the embryonal development and the incidence of variations and malformations 
in foetuses in bedaquiline groups were within normal ranges. Exposure to bedaquiline and the M2 
metabolite in rat at the high dose was considerable (up to 6-7 times higher compared with expected 
human  exposure),  while  in  rabbit  a  maximum  exposure  ratio  of  2  were  achieved.    However,  in 
rabbit  the  high  dose  of  100  mg/kg  caused  deaths,  one  abortion  and  increases  in  pre  and 
postimplantation losses. 
A pre and postnatal development study in rat was conducted with treatment from gestation day 6 
through lactation day 6. Pups of F1 generation were exposed via maternal milk and exhibited higher 
exposures to bedaquiline than dams while exposure to the M2 metabolite was slightly lower. Pups 
from treated females had lower body weights and lower body weight gains and this was ascertained 
to relate to exposure via maternal milk. Assessment of functional and behaviour capabilities, sexual 
maturity  and  reproductive  capacity  indicated  no  adverse  effects  of  pre  postnatal  exposure  to 
bedaquiline and its metabolites.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Local Tolerance  
Other toxicity studies 
Bedaquiline tested positive for phototoxicity in an in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake test. However, 
after single doses up to 100 mg/kg (AUC approx. x3 expected clinical) in pigmented rat no skin or 
ocular  reactions  were  recorded  that  could  be  coupled  to  phototoxicity.  Considering  the 
pharmacokinetics of bedaquiline it was discussed whether a negative result in a single dose study in 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 28/108 
 
  
  
 
rat  was  sufficient  to  conclude  on  a  negative  phototoxic  potential,  as  in  addition  the  actual 
concentrations  of  bedaquiline  and  M2  in  several  other  in  vitro  studies  were  much  lower  than 
intended  confounding  interpretation  of  data.  Clinical  data  do  however,  not  indicate  any 
phototoxicity to date.  
Bedaquiline did not appear to have any ocular irritant effects and was a non-sensitiser in a mouse 
study.  Several  rat  studies  specifically  addressed  aspects  of  immunotoxicity  and  while  neither 
lymphocyte  subsets  nor  T-cell  dependent  antibody  response  were  affected  by  up  to  4  weeks 
treatment with 60 mg/kg the substance seemed to mediate a higher susceptibility for infection in a 
host  resistance  assay  with  Listeria  monocytogenes.  The  potential  immunomodulatory  effect  of 
bedaquiline  has  been  discussed  and  the  data  overall  do  not  indicate  an  adverse  impact  on  the 
functionality of macrophages resulting in immune suppression at clinically relevant exposures. 
A dedicated M2 short term toxicity study in mouse was consistent with that the metabolite had a 
higher potential for toxicity than the parent compound. Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity studies in 
primary hepatocytes showed a higher cytotoxicity of bedaquiline in mouse and rat compared with 
dog and human and the M2 metabolite was more toxic in hepatocytes from all species. This pattern 
also corresponded to a higher in vitro phospholipidogenic potential of M2. 
While overall no clear effect of frequency of dosing on toxicological responses was recorded in rat 
studies a dose of 100 mg/kg per week tended to cause less severe effects than the same dose 
administered twice a week in divided doses. Considering specifically liver changes, effects appeared 
related to total dose over one week rather than frequency of dosing. In dog twice weekly doses of 
140 mg/kg seemed better tolerated than a daily dose of 40/20 mg/kg.

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  conducted  studies  provide  a  comprehensive  characterisation  of  the  potential  for  toxic 
manifestations of bedaquiline and its major metabolite M2. However, in the absence of human mass 
balance data there are uncertainties as to the species used in toxicological evaluations in terms of 
CHMP assessment report

their  level  of  predictivity.  Both  are  medium  to  strong  inducers  of  phospholipidosis  in  preclinical 
species at exposure levels not much in excess of expected clinical. The relation of phospholipidosis, 
toxicity and impairment of organ function is not clear, but data in preclinical species are consistent 
with  bedaquiline  being  involved  in  all  three  events  at  the  cellular  level.  The  apparent  very  high 
potential to accumulate in tissues/organs may also be a confounding factor when considering long 
term  effects.  Since  the  M2  metabolite  appears  more  potent,  both  in  terms  of  toxicity  and 
phospholipidosis, but is formed to a lesser extent in humans it may be that clinical concern is also 
lower,  however,  the  toxicity  of  bedaquiline  is  to  be  considered  in  the  overall  assessment  of 
benefit/risk.  Many of the potential toxic effects identified in non-clinical studies are also possible to 
monitor clinically.  
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
As there were no major differences in target organ toxicity between juvenile and adult rats and no 
additional toxicity was identified in the juvenile rat study, the CHMP considered that these results 
do not point towards specific risks in the paediatric population.  
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall  the  results  from  the  non-clinical  studies  that  deal  with  the  general  toxicity  including 
mechanistic aspects, as well as toxicity to reproduction, genotoxicity, phototoxicity, toxicity of 
impurities  are  adequate  and  sufficient  in  scope  and  extent  to  support  a  positive  benefit  risk 
profile. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  GCP 
The CHMP has asked for a routine inspection to be carried out of the conduct of the clinical study 
bedaquiline-C208 on 3 study sites (2 in Peru and 1 in South Africa), in accordance with Article 57 
of Council Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 and article 15 of Directive 2001/20/EC. Based on the 
quality identified during these three clinical sites inspections, it is likely that the deviations and 
findings  identified  during  the  inspections  did  not  in  any  major  sense  influence  or  change  the 
results as they were presented in the study report. It was therefore recommended that the study 
report can be used for evaluation and assessment of the application. 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.   Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
The solubility of bedaquiline is low at physiological pH and according to the pKa, the molecule is 
positively charged. The solubility is increased, but still low, at acidic pHs. 
The  partitioning  between 1-octanol  and  aqueous  buffered  solutions  at  different  pH  showed  high 
lipophilicity. Bedaquiline had a low permeability in Caco-2 cells. In contrast, the bioavailability was 
73%, 79%, 36% and 40% in mouse, rat, dog and monkey. The bioavailability of bedaquiline in man 
is unknown. The absorption is quite slow with a median tmax of 4 to 6 hours. At clinically relevant 
doses  the  absorption  of  bedaquiline  appears  linear  following  administration  of  an  oral  solution. 
However  the  solution  contains  solubility  enhancers.  In  several  clinical  trials,  a  second  peak  is 
observed  in  the  plasma  concentration-time  profile  of  bedaquiline  either  due  to  bile  salts  aiding 
solubility and thereby absorption, or due to enterohepatic recirculation. 
In vitro Caco-2 cell data indicate no Pgp involvement in the intestine. The concentrations were too 
high for “systemic” Pgp involvement to be excluded (risk of saturation).

The intended marketing formulation was used in the pivotal phase III studies. However, an oral 
solution has also been used in interaction studies. The exposure obtained with a 100 mg dose as 
solution and as the marketing formulation is similar during fed conditions. Administration of 100 mg 
bedaquiline  as  the  marketing  formulation  under  fed  conditions  (a  breakfast  but  not  the 
standardised high-fat breakfast) resulted in a higher mean Cmax and AUClast with LS mean ratios 
(fed/fasted) of 2.6 and 1.9, respectively. Surprisingly, metabolite M2, which has been associated to 
safety findings in preclinical species, had only a negligible increase in exposure. In another food 
interaction study with the same type of breakfast, the LS mean ratios of bedaquiline were 3.8 and 
2.4,  respectively.  The  effect  of  food  on  the  absorption  from  an  oral  solution  was  much  less 
pronounced (AUC increased 27%). This may be due to the additions of solubility enhancers in the 
solution but also to a different breakfast being served in this study. The effect of a high-fat breakfast 
has not been studied. However bedaquiline has been taken with food in the clinical phase II studies 
and although a high-fat study would have been valuable to estimate the worst-case food effect, this 
is not considered necessary. The phase II food intake is probably very variable and the impact of a 
single meal low with the quite long half-life. Bedaquiline is intended to be taken together with food. 
Distribution and protein binding 
The disposition of bedaquiline has 4 phases. Bedaquiline and an active metabolite M2 have a long 
terminal half-life, ~5.5 months in patients. The long terminal half-life corresponds to distribution 
from a deep department (tissues). 
Figure  1  Mean  plasma  concentration-time  profile  for  bedaquiline  after  last  dose  of  a 
400 mg qd regimen for 15 days 
The long  half-life can be explained by the cationic amphiphilic characteristics of the compounds 
causing accumulation in various tissues. Bedaquiline is 99.9% protein bound and M2 also showed a 
similar binding in a separate study. The blood-to-plasma ratio of M2 was on average 1.0. No ratio

has been found for bedaquiline. M2 has low permeability and may be a Pgp substrate. The efflux 
ratio in Caco-2 cells was up to 3.  
 
Peripheral blood monocytes 
The kinetics in monocytes followed that in plasma. Slightly higher accumulation was observed in 
monocytes (1.88 - 3.28, vs. plasma, 1.90 - 2.44) but despite this difference in accumulation the 
half-life was similar. 
 
Sputum 
After 7 days of bedaquiline treatment, the mean sputum-to-plasma concentration (Css,avg) ratios 
of bedaquiline varied between 0.64 and 1.22 for the different doses investigated (25 mg, 100 mg, 
400 mg).  For  M2  the  corresponding  Css,avg  ratios  varied  between  2.13  and  3.03.  The  mean 
bedaquiline-to-M2 ratio in sputum, after administration of the 400 mg dose was 0.58. In one study, 
the mean sputum concentration of M2 was approximately 2-3 fold higher than that of bedaquiline 
during  the  first  two  weeks  of  bedaquiline  treatment.  This  difference  in  concentration  between 
parent  and  metabolite  concentration  seems  to  level  out  upon  continued  administration  of 
bedaquiline. 
Taken together, it may be concluded that the metabolite-to-parent ratio in plasma differs from the 
one estimated for sputum. This could suggest that plasma is not reflecting the metabolite pattern of 
bedaquiline  in  target  tissue.  However,  based  on  plasma  exposure  M2  is  unlikely  to  contribute 
significantly to efficacy. M2 has been associated with safety issues in the preclinical species. The 
applicant needs to clarify elimination of M2 post authorisation through further in vitro studies as 
outlined further below. 
Elimination 
Based upon plasma concentration measurements taken during a 2-year washout period after the 
last dose of bedaquiline in trial C208, the mean terminal t1/2 was 5.5 months for bedaquiline and 
5.3 months for M2. In healthy volunteers, a half-life of ca 30 hours was detected after a 400 mg 
single-dose. The effective half-life of bedaquiline is much shorter based on the accumulation ratio at 
14 days of dosing and also time to steady state. Steady state of bedaquiline was reasonably reached 
already after 1 week. In contrast, M2 reaches steady state after ca. 14 days. The accumulation ratio 
of bedaquiline and M2 is 1.9 and 10.4, respectively, indicating a longer effective half-life of M2 than 
of bedaquiline.

No mass-balance study has been performed with bedaquiline. The applicant argues that due to the 
long  half-life,  performing  a  mass-balance  study  is  unethical.  Mass-balance  studies  have  been 
performed  in  preclinical  species  including  monkey.  The  elimination  in  man  has  been  poorly 
characterised. There are some data obtained with cold (unlabelled) drug but little data supporting 
main  elimination  pathways  is  provided.  The  in  vitro  metabolism  studies  were  not  investigating 
metabolite formation and thus, the data may not be coupled to the in vivo data available. Due to the 
lack of radiolabelled mass-balance data, the evaluation of whether the species have been exposed 
to “major metabolites” in plasma may not be performed. Furthermore, and importantly, the major 
elimination  pathways  of  elimination  as  well  as  M2  formation  and  elimination  are  difficult  to 
characterise. Safety is unknown at increased exposure and DDIs giving rise to increased exposure 
may not be predicted.   
Bedaquiline may be eliminated through metabolism and may also be subject to biliary excretion. 
Renal clearance appeared to be an insignificant route of elimination. 
Metabolite profiling of faeces extracts was performed in patients after 400 mg qd bedaquiline for 
one week. Faeces were collected for 24 h post-dose and could thus contain material from several 
previous doses. A longer collection of faeces post-dosing would have been valuable as well as a 
single dose design. Bedaquiline represented 75%-85% of drug related material found in faeces. A 
large part of this may be unabsorbed drug. However, major biliary excretion may not be excluded 
and was observed in preclinical animals. Metabolites, including M2, were excreted in small amounts. 
The metabolism of bedaquiline has been studied in vitro but without mass-balance data, the in vivo 
relevance of the in vitro enzyme contribution cannot be assessed. CYP3A4 seem to catalyse M2 
formation. The CYP3A4 involvement is supported by in vivo DDI data but the contribution may not 
be  quantified  in  these  studies.  There  seems  to  be  no  data  on  M2  elimination,  besides  some 
contribution  of  biliary  excretion.  Pgp,  BCRP  or  other  transporters  may  be  involved  in  such  an 
excretion. The applicant is also proposing M2 elimination through metabolism. Involved enzyme is 
unknown. 
The lack of data supporting model of elimination, in combination with the limited safety data on 
supra-therapeutic exposures is included in the risk-benefit analysis.  
No inter-conversion of bedaquiline into either the RR or the SS enantiomer was observed in vivo. 
Available data on metabolite exposure: There is no complete information on metabolite exposure as 
there is no mass-balance data. Thus, it may not be excluded based on human exposure that there 
are metabolites that should have been characterised preclinically. Plasma samples obtained after 
400 mg bedaquiline qd for 10 days were analysed for metabolites. Samples collected at 0-12 h were 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 37/108 
 
  
  
 
 
pooled  per  individual.  Four  metabolites  were  identified:  an  N-desmethyl  metabolite  (M2),  an 
N-didesmethyl  metabolite  (M3),  an  oxidated  N-desmethyl  metabolite  and  a  dihydrodiol  of  the 
N-desmethyl metabolite. The latter two metabolites were only detected in minor amounts in three 
out of six individuals. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The  exposure  of  bedaquiline  as  single  dose  conditions  after  administration  of  the  oral  solution 
(10-700 mg) is dose proportional and thus the elimination appears independent of dose. The data 
on metabolite M2 is more difficult to interpret. The Cmax of metabolite M2 seems dose proportional 
but the data does not allow any conclusions regarding AUC. The data available does not allow an 
evaluation on whether there is any time dependency in the pharmacokinetics of bedaquiline. The 
accumulation ratio of bedaquiline and M2 is 2 and 11, respectively. Steady state (or almost steady 
state concentrations) of bedaquiline is reached in ca 1 week. This would mean that the effective 
half-life is ca. 2 days in contrast to the terminal half-life which is ca. 5 months. The effective half-life 
is 24 hours based on the accumulation ratio (2).  
Variability 
The inter-individual variability was low to moderate. In DS-TB infected patients, CV of Cmin, Cmax, 
and AUC24h ranged from 30% to 49%. The inter-individual variability of M2 was approximately in 
the  same  range.  In  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  inter-individual  variability  was 
estimated to similar values. 
Target and Special populations 
 
Target population:  
A population PK (PPK) analysis was conducted by the use of nonlinear mixed effects modelling in 
NONMEM.  The  analysis  included  data  from  trials  in  healthy  subjects  (C102,  C104,  C109,  C110, 
C111, TBC1003) as well as trials in DS-TB (C202) and in MDR-TB infected subjects (C208 (Stages 
1 and 2, C209). A total of 480 (5222 observations) patients (369) or healthy subjects (111) were 
included.  
The  final  base  model  included  a  dual  zero  order  input  and  a  4-compartment  disposition  model. 
Relative bioavailability (F) was dependent on study. A higher F (2.03) was estimated in the studies 
with  healthy  volunteers  compared  with  the  studies  conducted  in  MRD-TB  patients.  Exploratory 
analyses did not demonstrate any changes in bioavailability over time. The final covariate model 
included Black race and subject status (patients vs. healthy volunteer) as covariates on CL/F and 
sex on Vc/F. Healthy subjects and DS-TB infected subjects had a 37.5% higher CL/F than MDR-TB 
patients.  Taking  into  account  the  higher  F,  the  CL/F  for  healthy  subjects  and  DS-TB  infected 
subjects  was  68%  (1.375/2.03)  of  the  CL/F  for  the  MDR-TB  infected  subjects.  Similarly,  black 
subjects  had  a  CL/F  that  was  52.0%  higher  than  non-Black  subjects,  equating  to  a  34%  lower 
exposure  in  Black  subjects.  Females  were  identified  to  have  a  Vc/F  that  was  15.7%  lower  than 
males. The small effect of gender was considered as not being clinical relevant. Also the effect of 
Black race was considered as not being clinical relevant given the demonstrated efficacy in Black 
subjects.

EMA/45161/2014

 
Renal impairment 
No  conventional  study  has  been  performed  investigating  the  effect  of  renal  impairment.  Renal 
elimination of unchanged drug is negligible. The effect of impaired renal function was explored in 
the population PK analysis using creatinine clearance as a surrogate. Within the limited range of 
CRCL  values  (39.8-227  ml/min)  in  the  included  population  no  statistical  significant  relationship 
between CRCL and CL/F was found. Only a few individuals with moderate impairment were included 
in the analysis. However, based on the assumed limited renal excretion it is not expected that mild 
or moderate renal impairment will have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to bedaquiline. 
In  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment  or  end-stage  renal  disease,  concentrations  may  be 
increased  due  to  alteration  of  drug  absorption,  distribution,  and  metabolism  secondary  to  renal 
dysfunction. There may be pharmacologically active metabolites eliminated through renal excretion. 
This is not indicated by the data but the lack of mass-balance data precludes firm conclusions to be 
drawn.  
 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on total (bound plus unbound) exposure was quite limited. AUClast 
of bedaquiline and of metabolite M2 were both reduced by 19% in moderate hepatic impairment. 
The degree of protein binding was not measured in the study and as an effect of unbound fraction 
(fu) is likely, as indicated both by the high protein binding in healthy volunteers and by the decrease 
instead of increase in exposure, the results of the study are of little value. As no information on fu 
is currently available, the labelling recommendations needs to be based on predicted effects. 
 
Gender, weight, race and age:  
The effect of gender, BMI and race on the pharmacokinetics of bedaquiline was evaluated in the 
population  pharmacokinetic  analysis.  The  population  consisted  of  149  Black,  134  Caucasian,  99 
Asian, 41 Hispanic and 57 subjects with race classified as “other”, 331 males and 149 females and 
included a BMI range of a 13.1 to 36.8 kg/m2.  Apparent Vc/F was lower in females (138 L) than 
males (164 L), a difference not considered clinically relevant. Differences in weight/BMI were also 
found to have a non-significant effect on the PK. Black subjects were found to have a decreased 
exposure (34%) due to an increased CL/F. The predicted decrease is however not considered being 
clinically relevant based on the demonstrated equally good efficacy in Black subjects. As the reason 
for the lower exposure in Black subjects compared to other ethnicities is unknown it is encouraged 
that  the  effect  of  Black  race  and  potential  clinical  consequences  of  the  lower  exposure  is 
re-evaluated in the planned phase III study. Limited data is available on the use of bedaquiline in 
elderly. Patients older than 65 years were excluded from the clinical studies 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
 
Effects on enzymes 
In vitro experiments showed that the potential for bedaquiline and M2 to inhibit CYP isoenzymes 
may  be  considered  to  be  low.  The  reported  IC50  values  were  high  in  comparison  to  the  Cmax, 
unbound values obtained in clinical trials. However, clarification from the applicant is needed to 
exclude the potential for bedaquiline to inhibit intestinal CYP3A4 (to be evaluated in a phase 3 study 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 39/108 
 
  
  
 
 
post  authorization  )..The  potential  for  bedaquiline  to  inhibit  CYP2C9  and  CYP2C8  needs  to  be 
investigated  separately  post  authorisation  with  a  sensitive  marker  reaction  as  outlined  further 
below.  
The in vitro induction studies are difficult to interpret due to different shortcomings. There are in 
vivo indications of induction from both the DDI study with ketoconazole and with lopinavir/ritonavir. 
In  order  to  estimate the  potency  of  bedaquiline  as  an  inducer,  the  applicant  should  perform  an 
interaction study with midazolam. In in vitro enzyme inhibition assays, bedaquiline did not inhibit 
any  of  the  tested  CYPs  at  in  vivo  relevant  concentrations  (50*Cmaxu).  The  metabolite  M2  had 
higher inhibition potency but the inhibition was not significant at relevant concentration. 
 
Effects on transporters:  
Bedaquiline and M2 inhibited efflux transport of paclitaxel in Caco-2 cells, while bedaquiline did not 
inhibit taxol transport in another Caco-2 cell assay. The applicant should perform in vitro studies 
investigating  the  effect  on  the  transporters  listed  in  the  revised  DDI  guideline:  BCRP,  OATP1B1 
(SLCO1B1),  OATP1B3  (SLCO1B3),  OCT2  (SLC22A2),  OAT1  (SLC22A6)  and  OAT3  (SLC22A8), 
preferably also OCT-1, MATE1 (SLC47A1) and MATE2 (SLC47A). These data may be of importance 
for DDI predictions with HIV drugs but could be submitted post-approval. 
In vivo DDI studies 
 
The effect of rifampicin 600 mg qd for 7 days on bedaquiline and M2 after a 300 mg bedaquiline 
single-dose  before  and  on  the  7th  treatment  day  was  investigated.  Rifampicin  induced  the 
metabolism of bedaquiline and reduced the AUC0-t of bedaquiline by 52% and the AUC of M2 by 
25%. The effect if probably markedly underestimated as rifampicin treatment did not cover a major 
part of the bedaquiline AUC. In the SmPC 4.5, it is concluded that co-administration of bedaquiline 
and rifamycins or other potent CYP3A4 inducers used systemically should be avoided. 
The  interaction  with  isoniazid/  pyrazinamide  was  investigated.  The  pharmacokinetics  of 
isoniazid/pyrazinamide qd for 5 days, alone or on the 11th (to 15th) day of bedaquiline 400 mg qd 
treatment was investigated. Full pharmacokinetic profiles of bedaquiline and metabolite M2 were 
determined on day 10 and day 15 of the bedaquiline treatment. Isoniazid/pyrazinamide reduced the 
AUC24h of bedaquiline 13% while the AUC of M2 was increased by 30%. The effect may have been 
underestimated. Bedaquiline increased the C0h, Cmax and AUC24h of isoniazid with 20%, 20% and 
7%, respectively. Cmin was not included in the statistical analysis of isoniazid as more than half of 
the  individual  values  on  day  5  after  treatment  of  isoniazid/pyrazinamide  alone  were  below  the 
LLOQ.  The  mean  terminal  t½  of  isoniazid  following  co-treatment  with  bedaquiline  was  3.8 h 
(±1.7 h). 
The effect of nevirapine on the pharmacokinetics of bedaquiline was investigated in HIV patients. 
Bedaquiline  was  administered  as  a  400  mg  dingle  dose  before  and  after  start  treatment  with 
nevirapine in combination with 2 NRTIs at the recommended dosing regimen (200 mg qd for two 
weeks followed by 200 mg bid). There was a 2-4 week washout between the bedaquiline dose and 
the nevirapine/NRTI combination. After 4 weeks of nevirapine at a dose of 200 mg bid, a second 
single dose of bedaquiline 400 mg was co-administered. The HIV treatment was continued after the 
bedaquiline dose. Nevirapine did not affect bedaquiline exposure. This is surprising as the drug is a 
CYP3A4 inducer in vivo. The Cmax of M2 was 25% reduced by the HIV treatment but here there was

a  substantial  carryover  and  the  effect  could  have  been  more  marked.  However,  M2  AUC  was 
unchanged. 
The effect of efavirenz was investigated in a published paper. The single-dose pharmacokinetics of 
bedaquiline  was  investigated  before  and  after  14  days  of  treatment  with  efavirenz  600  mg  qd 
(without  food).  Efavirenz  was  continuously  administered  throughout  the  bedaquiline  sampling 
period (336 h). Efavirenz reduced bedaquiline AUC336h by 18%, whereas Cmax was unaffected. M2 
Cmax was 89% increased, but M2 AUC336h was unchanged.  
The DDI between ketoconazole and bedaquiline was investigated but the design of the study was 
not optimal. Ketoconazole 400 mg qd for 3 days alone after the three last days of a bedaquiline 400 
mg  qd  2-week  regimen.  Bedaquiline  was  administered  as  the  400  mg  qd  regimen  alone  and  to 
investigate the effect of ketoconazole, Bedaquiline PK was studied on the 11th day of bedaquiline 
400  mg  qd  and  on  the  14th  day  (after  3  days  of  ketoconazole  co-treatment).  Ketoconazole 
increased  the  bedaquiline  AUC24h  by  22%.  The  Cmax  and  AUC24h  of  the  metabolite  M2  were 
unaffected by ketoconazole. Bedaquiline slightly reduced the exposure of ketoconazole possibly due 
to enzyme induction. 
The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir was also investigated. The exposure of bedaquiline was determined 
when a 400 mg dose  was administered alone as well as on the 11th day of  a  lopinavir/ritonavir 
400/100 mg bid treatment for 24 days. The bedaquiline doses were administered 4 weeks apart. 
Lopinavir/ritonavir increased the AUCt of bedaquiline by 22%, whereas Cmax of the compound was 
unaffected. A significant period effect was observed and the patients treated with bedaquiline alone 
first,  followed  by  the  PIs  had  a  40%  increase  in  AUC  while  there  was  no  effect  if  the  order  of 
treatment was the opposite. Lopinavir/ritonavir reduced AUCt of M2 by 39%. M2 AUCt decreased by 
62% if the combination was administered first sequence. 
The effect of bedaquiline 400 mg qd on the exposure to co-administered anti-tuberculosis drugs in 
the background regimen was evaluated at week 2 of study C208 comparing the pharmacokinetics of 
these drugs in the bedaquiline and placebo groups (i.e. parallel study design). The results did not 
indicate  any  significant  effect  on  ofloxacin,  cycloserine/  terizidone,  ethambutol,  kanamycin  or 
pyrazinamide. 
 
Planned phase III study 
In the phase III study planned by the applicant, protease inhibitors will be allowed. Preferably, a 
well performed PK DDI study with results possible to extrapolate to the therapeutic situation should 
be  performed  to  allow  prospective  dose  adjustment  unless  safety  is.  Regardless  which  route  is 
taken, effort should be made to extract as much information as possible from the study. This is 
recommended: 
•  Sparse  sampling  and  population  PK  analysis  with  effort  made  to  obtain  very  accurate 
information on concomitant medication, time point of last dose, dose and dose intervals, 
duration,  etc.  This  is  essential  for  the  possibility  of  documenting  the  interactions  with 
commonly used drugs. 
•  Blood sampling for genotyping intended to clarify enzyme and transporter involvement as 
well as to document exposure in subgroups: including genotyping for CYP2C19 and other 
potential  enzyme  candidates  as  well  as  of  genes  coding  for  polymorphic  transporters 
potentially involved in biliary excretion (OATP1B1, OCT-1, BCRP etc.).

 
PK/PD 
The relationship between bedaquiline exposure and short- or long-term anti-mycobacterial activity 
was  evaluated  in  study  C202,  C208  and  C209  by  the  use  of  graphical  exploratory  plots, 
Cox-proportional hazard and logistic regression models. In study C202, a trend towards greater 
decreases in log10 sputum CFU count with greater exposure at Day 7was found. In trial C208 (stage 
2),  no  clear  relationship  between  AUC24h  and  time  to  sputum  culture  conversion  was  evident. 
Neither  was  a  clear  relationship  between  AUC24h  stratified  on  quartiles  and  culture  conversion 
rates  identified.  In  C209  was  no  clear  relationship  observed  between  Cavg  values  and  times  to 
culture  conversion.  Culture  conversion  rates  analyzed  by  quartile  ranges  of  pharmacokinetic 
parameters  at  Week  24  showed  a  somewhat  higher  conversion  rates  in  higher  Cavg  quartiles 
compared to lower Cavg quartiles in Q4 (Cavg > 1447 ng/mL), 91.3% of subjects were responders, 
while in Q1 (Cavg < 796.9 ng/mL), 83.0% of subjects were responders.  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Adequate  microbiological  methods  were  used  for  documentation  of  bedaquiline  in  the  clinical 
studies and assessments of MIC were carefully and properly described. 
Mechanism of action 
Bedaquiline is the first diarylquinoline reported to exhibit anti-TB activity that is being developed for 
the treatment of patients with pulmonary MDR-TB. Findings indicate that bedaquiline inhibited the 
proton pump of M. tuberculosis ATP synthase. It was also clarified that the M2 metabolite does have 
the  same  mechanism,  since  the  same  point  mutations  in  the  atpE-gene  that  are  involved  in 
resistance to the mother compound induced cross resistance to M2. 
Although selection experiments indicate that certain point mutations in the atpE gene are involved 
in resistance to bedaquiline, these mutations were only found in a smaller proportion of isolates in 
these in vitro studies, and in none of the resistant clinical isolates obtained studies C208/C209. 
During  the  procedure  it  was  clarified  that  functional  assays  using  efflux  inhibitors  (verapamil, 
resperpine)  imply  the  involvement  of  an  efflux-based  mechanism.  This  is  certainly  an  area  for 
further studies.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In vitro activity against M. tuberculosis isolates 
The in vitro susceptibility tested for a wide variety of strains, both those susceptible to first line 
agents  (DS-TB)  and  MDR-strains.  MIC  ranged  from  ≤  0.008  to  0.12  µg/mL  without  obvious 
differences by resistance to other agents, and subtype. This wide difference in MICs may be related 
to methodological difficulties in these low ranges of MICs. When looking at clinical outcomes, no 
relation was found between baseline MICs, for bedaquiline, and effects. 
MICs were generally < 0.1 µg/mL also for other mycobacterial species, including species naturally 
resistant to many other anti-TB agents and involved in opportunistic infections, such as M. avium 
complex.   
The MIC for M2, the main metabolite, was 3-6 times higher than that of the parent compound.  
Bactericidal activity 
 In various in vitro experiments bedaquiline has been shown to be bactericidal properties, including 
for dormant bacilli as shown in the table 7 below. 
Table7  :  Comparative  Killing  Activity  of  TB  Compounds  (Rifampicin(“R”),  Isoniazid 
(“INH”)  and  BDQ)  for  Actively  Replicating  (“MBC”)  and  Dormant  (“WCC”)  M. 
tuberculosis 
The WCC/MBC ratio reflects the comparative killing efficiency. It should be noted that bedaquiline is 
slightly more potent toward dormant bacteria with a low WCC/MBC ratio compared to rifampicin and 
isoniazid. Isoniazid has no detectable activity on dormant bacteria and rifampicin is significantly less 
active on dormant as compared to actively replicating bacilli. 
In vitro, the killing effect is time- rather than concentration-dependent, which is in line with data 
obtained with short course monotherapy in TB patients. 
In vitro, presumably a post-antibiotic effect was shown in vitro (9 hrs, compared to 15 hours for 
isoniazid used as control). 
Specific activity for Mycobacteria species 
The activity of bedaquiline was tested against a panel of other bacteria, all showing very high MICs 
for  bedaquiline  (Corynebacterium,  Helicobacter,  Nocardia,  E--coli,  Haemophilus  influenza, 
Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus).During the review process it was also clarified 
that,  from  a  mechanistic  point  of  view,  non-mycobacterial  species  are  considered  intrinsically 
resistant  to  bedaquiline,  which  also  means  that  there  should  be  no  risk  for  enrichment  or 
maintenance of resistance within the gut flora.

Monotherapy in murine models 
Bedaquiline has been investigated at various doses in a considerable number of animal studies, 
mice models and a Guinea Pig model, in monotherapy, as well as in combination with other TB 
agents.  
In monotherapy (mice) one important finding was that the efficacy of intermittent dosing seemed 
comparable to that obtained with daily dosing. Bedaquiline alone was at least as bactericidal as the 
first-line triple combination therapy (i.e., R + INH + PZA) and more active than R alone. 
Guinea Pigs infected by aerosol show lung lesions with similarities to natural infections in humans, 
including  lung  cavitations  etc.  In  this  respect,  this  model  might  be  of  particular  interest.  Here 
bedaquiline, still as monotherapy, was highly effective, with almost complete eradication after 6 
weeks therapy, and showed higher efficacy than conventional therapy of R + INH + PZA. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other TB agents  
In vitro interactions of bedaquiline with other anti-TB drugs have not been studied. Instead, a series 
of  animal  experiments  were  conducted  where  bedaquiline  was  administered  with  various 
combinations of anti-TB drugs. 
Increased effect was seen when bedaquiline was added to a first-line triple combination therapy (R 
+ INH + PZA) for DS-TB in mice. When substituting one of these first-line drugs with bedaquiline, 
the activity of each regimen was significantly better than that of R + INH + PZA, particularly after 
1 month of treatment. 
When  following  mice  for  longer,  to  study  relapse  rates  after  various  regimens  with  and  without 
bedaquiline  (added  or  substituted  for)  of  3  months  or  longer,  end  of  treatment  responses  were 
similar for tested regimens, but relapse rates were considerably lower in regimens that included 
bedaquiline.  
These studies also looked at combinations of bedaquiline with some second-line agents (amikacin, 
ethionamide, moxifloxacin) with the same promising results.

The study above is, according to the company, the first study in which a regimen without INH and 
R was able to reach lung and spleen culture conversion within 2 months of therapy in mice. These 
observations in mice may suggest that bedaquiline-containing MDR-TB regimens could have the 
potential to significantly shorten treatment duration, similar to what was seen when bedaquiline 
was added to the first-line regimen R + INH + PZA. 
In two other studies (mouse model) pharmacodynamic data was also generated for the combination 
of bedaquiline, clofazimine (CFZ) and PZA. Here it was shown that when combining bedaquiline + 
PZA,  the  best  3rd  drug  was  CFZ,  as  compared  to  adding  rifampicin,  rifapentine  or  moxifloxacin 
(killing effect; decrease in Lung log CFU count over 1 month). In the second study, again the same 
combination  yielded  a  seemingly  high  sterilizing  activity  also  with  a  short  course,  table  below, 
Hence,  CFZ  may  be  an  important  agent  to  be  used  as  part  of  the  background  regimen  to 
bedaquiline.

With regards to sterilizing activity, the issue how bedaquiline could work on dormant bacilli was 
raised during the review, taking the mechanism of action into account. It was clarified that the  de 
novo  ATP  synthesis  is  essential  for  the  viability  of  hypoxic  non-replicating  mycobacteria.  As  the 
intracellular concentration of ATP is lower in during such conditions (by a factor 5 or so), this makes 
non-replicative  bacteria  exquisitely  sensitive  to  further  depletion.  Hence,  the  effect  on  dormant 
bacilli is much higher for bedaquiline than for INH and RIF as outlined in the section on bactericidal 
activity above. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 45/108 
 
  
  
 
 
The  exposures  of  bedaquiline  and  M2,  major  metabolite  with  MIC  values  being  around  5  times 
higher- achieved in the animal studies was discussed during the review procedure. When looking at 
the steady state, the combined exposure of active moieties seen in mice was slightly lower than the 
combined exposure seen in patients treated with bedaquiline 200 g thrice weekly (i.e. end of study 
C208, stage 1). Hence, the exposures in the animal studies seem relevant to human conditions.  
The mean time to positive signals in the MGIT (liquid) culture system (a secondary end point in 
study  C208)  was  longer  in  the  bedaquiline-treated  patients.  In  stage  2  of  study  C208  this  also 
seems to be the case at time points way past week 24 (when bedaquiline had been stopped). In 
addition,  it  was  clarified  that  by  the  methods  used  (including  the  lysis  of  cells  as  part  of  the 
procedure) there would be no risk for bedaquiline concentrations high enough to cause an effect on 
growths of the bacteria/resistance development in vitro.   
Bedaquiline showed a high in vitro activity against M. tuberculosis, without any relevant difference 
in strains, and regardless of resistance to first line agents. Also non-tuberculosis strains, such as 
MAC,  are  sensitive  in  vitro.  Hence,  also  for  these  infections  (rather  common  in  advanced  HIV 
disease) might be a future target for TMC 207.  
Animal models highly support that bedaquiline is active in vivo; that synergism with other agents is 
likely,  and  that  bedaquiline  have  sterilizing  effects.  This  might  mean  that  therapy  could  be 
shortened when this agent is used.  
There is no suggestion for negative pharmacodynamic interactions, thus far studied for first line 
agents, as well as for amikacin (injectable), moxifloxacin (fluoroquinolone) and ethionamide. 
The achieved plasma concentrations and the demonstrated MICs for the two major metabolites of 
bedaquiline,  M2  and  M3,  indicate  that  they  do  not  contribute  to  the  overall  anti-mycobacterial 
activity during clinical use of bedaquiline. In contrast, in the murine models M2 has a more relevant 
part of activity (levels much higher than in humans). The exposures of active moieties (bedaquiline 
+ M2) that were seen in the models were relevant for human conditions. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  main  clinical  pharmacology  issues  in  this  application  are  the  lack  of  information  regarding 
potential  routes  of  elimination  for  bedaquiline  other  than  CYP3A4,  and  how  the  active/toxic 
metabolite M2 is eliminated. These shortcomings render interaction potential as well as effects of 
pharmacogenetics difficult to predict. Given the relatively narrow range of exposures observed in 
clinical  studies,  potential  safety  issues  resulting  from  increased  exposures  are  also  difficult  to 
predict. The lack of elimination data is an important risk the needs to be addressed post approval, 
as specified in the RMP. 
 
PK/PD 
Based on the provided data no clear exposure response relationship was established. A trend 
towards higher conversion rates in patients with higher exposures was seen in study C209. The lack 
of established PK/PD relationship may be due to the limited range of doses included in the exposure 
response analysis.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 46/108 
 
  
  
 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
A  number  of  issues  have  been  identified  particularly  pertaining  to  the  lack  of  information 
regarding the elimination of bedaquiline and M2. The lack of elimination data is an important risk 
identified  in  the  RMP  and  considered  in  the  benefit-risk  assessment.  In  the  absence  of  this 
information  a  combination  of  restrictive  labelling  as  well  as  studies  to  be  performed 
post-approval are proposed.  
The CHMP considers the following additional measures necessary to address the issues related to 
pharmacology: 
• 
• 
Identification how M2 is eliminated and which transporters are involved. 
In  vitro  studies  of  bedaquiline  as  a  substrate  of  canalicular  efflux  transporters  (in 
accordance  with 
the  Guideline  on 
the 
Investigation  of  Drug 
Interactions, 
CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr). 
•  An in vitro study on CYP2C8 and CTP2C9 enzyme inhibition.  
•  An  in  vitro  study  to  assess  the  potential  of  BDQ  and  M2  to  inhibit  the  transporters: 
OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  BCRP,  OAT1,  OAT3  and  preferably  also  OCT1,  OCT2,  MATE1  and 
MATE. 
• 
Exploration of mechanisms of resistance other than that known to date. 
These measures are also reflected in the Risk Management Plan as further detailed below. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The  proposed  indication  for  bedaquiline  is  treatment  of  pulmonary  tuberculosis  due  to  MDR  M. 
tuberculosis  as  part  of  combination  therapy  in  adults  (≥18  years).  The  applicant  has  used  the 
following definition for MDR-TB: Tuberculosis due to infection with a strain of M. tuberculosis that is 
resistant to at least isoniazid (INH or H) and rifampicin (R), the 2 most important first-line drugs 
used to treat DS-TB. Furthermore, MDRH&R-TB was used to refer to M.tuberculosis resistant to INH 
and R, excluding pre-XDR (resistance to isoniazid (H) and rifampicin (R), but still susceptible to 
either, but not both second line injectables or fluoroquinolones) and XDR (resistance to isoniazid 
and rifampicin, second line injectables and fluoroquinolones).  
Clinical documentation to support this application includes four Phase II trials.

2.5.1.  Dose-response studies 
C202 - a short term exploratory study on early bactericidal activity (Single centre, South 
Africa) 
This study examined the reduction of viable count of M. Tuberculosis in daily sputum samples in 75 
treatment naïve, smear positive, patients treated (1:1:1:1:1, i.e. around 15 patients per arm) for 
7 days with  
•  Bedaquiline dosed 25 mg, 100 mg or 400 mg qd, or 
•  Rifampicin 600 mg qd, or 
• 
Isoniazid 300 mg qd 
Early  bactericidal  activity  (EBA)  was  found  to  be  higher  in  the  rifampicin  and  isoniazid  groups, 
compared to the bedaquiline groups. The lower doses (25 mg and 100 mg) did not show statistically 
relevant  changes  during  the  7  days  of  treatment,  and  the  highest  dose,  400  mg  qd,  showed  a 
modest effect of 1 log 10 reduction, with a delayed onset. Corresponding effect with INH was 2 log 10 
reduction. During the review of data the applicant was asked to expand on the fact that while the 
pharmacodynamic studies in animals (discussed previously) and the phase 2b studies indicated an 
favourable effect after 1 month and longer, the results of the EBA-study in contrast showed less 
impressive  effects.  It  was  shown  that  in  further  studies  in  mice,  this  pattern  could  be  verified; 
during the first week the killing effect of bedaquiline was much lower than during weeks 2-4. The 
same delayed effect was also shown for bedaquiline in vitro. The applicant concludes that the likely 
reason is that mycobacteria would carry a pool of ATP reserve, and stated that ATP levels need to 
drop by some 90% before killing starts (unpublished data). 
It was noted that study C202 included patients with a high level of disease and one actually died 
shortly after the investigational treatment (massive bleeding from cavernous TB). 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study C208: A phase II, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised trial to evaluate 
antibacterial activity, safety, and tolerability of bedaquiline in subjects with sputum 
smear-positive pulmonary infection with multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis. 
Methods 
Study C208 is considered the main basis for this application for a conditional approval. The study 
consists of two stages, which rather could be considered to be two separate studies. However, both 
stages share the same methods, end points and background regimens.  
The difference between stage 1 and 2 is the duration of bedaquiline (versus placebo) treatment 
which was 8 weeks in stage 1 (total 47 patients) and 24 weeks in stage 2 (total 160 patients).

The major inclusion and exclusion criteria for C208 trial are given below.  
Main inclusion criteria 
-  Male or female subjects, aged 18-65 years, and with a BMI between 15 and 28 kg/m2. 
- 
Subjects  with  newly  diagnosed  sputum  smear-positive  pulmonary  MDR-TB  infection,  with 
confirmed resistance to at least both R and INH by previous screening from a TB treatment 
facility. Resistance could be shown by proportion method and/or rapid screen tests, i.e., fast 
plaque and Genotype MTBDR plus line probe (if resistance to R or INH was based on rapid 
screen tests, these tests had to be repeated at the screening visit).  
Subjects with newly diagnosed MDR-TB were defined as a) subjects with MDR-TB who had 
never  been  treated  for  TB  before,  or  b)  subjects  with  MDR-TB  who  had  previously  been 
treated with only first-line TB drugs (INH, R, EMB, PZA, or SM). 
Positive for AFB on direct smear examination of expectorated sputum specimen [≥1+]. 
Subjects had to consent to HIV-testing. 
Subjects  had  to  discontinue  all  TB  drugs  to  allow  7  days  washout  before  baseline

opinion, could compromise the subject's safety or compliance. 
Subjects having a clinically significant active medical condition. 
Subjects having a significant cardiac arrhythmia that required medication.

antiretroviral therapy (ART) and/or oral or IV antifungal medication within the last 90 days. 
Also subjects, who might need to start ART during the 24-week treatment period of Stage 2. 
Subjects with complicated or severe extrapulmonary or neurological manifestations of TB. 
Subjects  having  any  concomitant  severe  illness  or  rapidly  deteriorating  health  condition, 
including  immune  deficiency,  or  gastrointestinal  disease  that  could  interfere  with  the 
absorption of bedaquiline. 
Subjects  having  had  DST  performed  prior  to  screening  and  their  isolates  being  not 
susceptible to at least 3 of the 5 classes of TB drugs used to treat MDR-TB. 
Subjects with the following QT/QTc characteristics at screening: (a) A marked prolongation of 
QT/QTc interval, e.g., QTcF > 450 ms, (b) A history of additional risk  factors for Torsade de 
Pointes, and (c) The use of concomitant medications that may prolong the QT/QTc interval. 
Rollover criteria 
Upon availability of the C208 Stage 1 results, a rollover arm was added to Stage 2 per protocol 
Amendment  IV  to  offer  open-label  treatment  with  bedaquiline  to  subjects  from  Stage  2  who 
received  placebo  and  were  not  adequately  responding  to  their  BR  regimen  after  24  weeks  of 
treatment  (including  subjects  who  developed  XDR-TB  during  this  period).  Subjects  with 
pre-XDR-TB  in  the  placebo  group  when  second-line  susceptibility  results  became  available  after 
randomisation had also the option to rollover to this arm.

Treatments 
Following screening tests (Week –1), eligible subjects were hospitalized as per standard of care. 
The treatment regimens administered in Stage 1 and 2 are shown in table 11 below.  
Table 11: Treatment regimens  
Screening period (Week -1) 
No treatment administration 
Treatment period (8 weeks at Stage 1, 24 weeks at Stage 2*): 
Weeks 1 and 2: 400 mg bedaquiline or placebo q.d. (1:1) administered as 4 tablets, and BR** 
Week 3 to 8(stage 1); Weeks 3-24 (stage 2): 200 mg bedaquiline or placebo t.i.w. (at least one day 
apart) administered as 2 tablets, and BR 
Follow-up period (96 weeks at both Stage 1 and 2): 
MDR-TB treatment (i.e. BR only) for 18-24 months, at least 12 months after the first documented 
negative culture 
* Rollover group subjects received the same treatment regimen as the Stage 2 subjects  
** The BR is selected according to national guidelines for the treatment of MDR-TB. 
Bedaquiline was supplied as 100 mg tablets. There were matching placebo tablets.  
Study  medication  was  administered  orally  with  water  within  10  minutes  following  breakfast. 
Background  medication  had  to  be  taken  before  breakfast.  Treatment  throughout  investigational 
treatment period and the follow-up period was administered by directly observed treatment (DOT). 
All medication intakes were supervised.  
Background regimen 
A preferred background regimen consisting of the 5 agents was given for 18-24 months (at least 12 
months  after 
the 
first  documented  negative  culture):  KAN,  OFL,  ETH,  PZA  and 
cycloserine/terizidone. An overview of BR treatment is given in table 12 below.

Table 12: Drugs used in the BR for the Treatment of MDR-TB in the C208 Trial 
The  BR  for  each  subject  was  provided  through  the  national  TB  program.  Some  predetermined 
changes were allowed, in case of supply shortage or intolerance. If changes in the BR were made for 
reasons of toxicity or safety, this had to be reported as an AE. Changes (pre-determined agents) 
could also be made for reasons of resistance (cultures obtained with time). 
Treatment administration was using DOT throughout the study, with time (i.e. when the patient was 
discharged from the hospital) a procedure supervised by family members/community members. 
Randomization was scheduled one week after screening, using a central randomization system. A 
minimization technique was used to ensure balance across the treatment groups in each stratum. 
The  treatments  included  in  the  preferred  BR,  and  the  duration,  is  in  line  with  the  WHO 
recommendations  for  MDR-TB  therapy  (at  least  at  the  time  of  these  studies).  Normally 
aminoglycosides  would  be  used  only  during  the  first  4-6  months,  and  during  the  review  it  was 
clarified that in these studies the injectable was kept for longer in many cases; in particular in those 
allocated to placebo. For example in study C208 (stage 2) at week 36 injectables were still used by 
some 30% in the bedaquiline arm, 50% in the placebo arm, and at week 48: 16% vs 22%. Hence, 
this would be one drawback accounted for by the placebo-controlled design.  
The  individual  BR  regimens  did  change  over time  (mainly  during  the  BR  treatment  period)  with 
addition of some of these other drugs (in particular PAS-C and capreomycin). Such changes were 
more common in the placebo-arm than in the bedaquiline-arm.  
Disallowed medications included those with large effects on CYP3A activity (e.g., rifampicin) and 
those associated with QT-prolongation.

Objectives 
Stage  1:  The  objective  of  Stage  1  was  to  evaluate  the  PK,  antibacterial  activity,  safety,  and 
tolerability  of  bedaquiline  compared  to  placebo  when  added  to  an  MDR-TB  BR  for  8  weeks  in 
subjects with newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive pulmonary MDR-TB infection. 
Stage  2:  The  primary  objective  of  Stage  2  was  to  demonstrate  superiority  in  the  antibacterial 
activity of bedaquiline compared to placebo when added to a BR for 24 weeks in subjects with newly 
diagnosed sputum smear-positive pulmonary MDR-TB infection. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was time to sputum culture conversion (SCC) during treatment with 
bedaquiline or placebo. This parameter was based on the qualitative assessment of culture growth 
in MGIT using spot sputum samples.  
Sputum culture conversion was defined as two negative cultures at consecutive visits within the 
8 week investigational phase in stage 1. In stage 2, the same definition applied, but the negative 
cultures needed to be at least 25 days apart.  
Sputum culture conversion was overruled when followed by a confirmed positive culture result (2 
consecutive  visits  with  positive  sputum  results),  defined  as  relapse  (during  treatment,  or  after 
stopping treatment).  
For subjects who discontinued before the end of the analysed time period, the following methods 
were applied to calculate the time to SCC: 
• 
• 
Primary missing = failure analysis: They were considered treatment failures and their time 
to SCC was censored at their last assessment with sputum culture. 
End-censored missing = failure analysis: They were considered treatment failures and were 
carried forward as not converting through the considered time period. The subjects’ time to 
SCC was censored on the last day of the analysed time period. 
•  No overruling for discontinuation analysis: The discontinuation information was not taken 
into account.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Culture Conversion Rates was calculated to determine the proportion of subjects with MGIT SCC, 
the following definitions were used: 
-  Responder  (missing  =  failure):  SCC  had  occurred,  was  not  followed  by  a  confirmed 
positive MGIT result, and the subject did not discontinue during the considered time frame. 
-  Non-responder  (missing  =  failure): the last available microbiological status was 'not 
converted', or status was  'converted' but followed by a confirmed positive result, or the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 53/108 
 
  
  
 
 
subject discontinued during the considered time frame regardless of the status at the last 
assessment. 
A second method was also performed as sensitivity analysis to calculate culture conversion rates, 
using  the  no  overruling  (i.e.  discontinuation  information  was  not  taken  into  account)  analysis. 
Subcategories  for  non-responders  were:  Failure  to  culture  convert,  relapse,  re-infection  and 
discontinued with microbiological status 'converted'. 
Genotyping of M. tuberculosis isolates was to be done when a confirmed positive sputum culture 
was observed (or a single positive culture after the subject discontinued or completed the trial) in 
subjects whose microbiological status was “converted” previously. If genotyping information was 
missing, the subject was considered as relapser. 
Other secondary end points included among others time to positive signal in MGIT, changes in CFU 
counts and changes in chest X-Ray and weight.  
The applicant considered all of the above parameters as interim  status  indicators  for MDR-TB 
subjects due to the long duration of MDR-TB therapy. The following treatment outcomes as defined 
by an international expert group (Laserson et al 2005) and slightly adapted for practical use were 
thus also included in the protocol as secondary endpoints: 
Cure:  An  MDR-TB  patient  who  completed  treatment  according  to  protocol  and  was  consistently 
culture-negative (with at least five results) for the final 12 months of treatment. If only one positive 
culture is reported during that time, a patient would still be considered cured, provided that this was 
followed by a minimum of three consecutive negative cultures over a period of at least 56 days. 
Treatment failure: Treatment would be considered “failure” if ≥2 of the 5 cultures recorded in the 
final 12 months were positive, or if any one of the final three cultures was positive. Treatment would 
also be considered “failure” if treatment was terminated early due to poor response or AEs. 
At the final analysis, the number of subjects with a relapse and the time-to-relapse was also to be 
evaluated, in addition to the above treatment outcomes. Relapse was defined as a positive sputum 
culture after a subject was defined converted. 
Sample size 
It was planned to enrol 50 subjects in Stage 1, however, less than 50 subjects could be randomised 
if the Sponsor considered the sample size sufficient to meet the primary objectives of this stage.  
The objective of Stage 2 is to demonstrate superiority of 24-week bedaquiline treatment compared 
to  placebo.  According  to  the  protocol,  a  sample  size  of  75  subjects  per  group  was  considered 
sufficient to achieve 80% power which could detect a difference of 22% in the 24- week conversion 
rates  between  the  placebo  group  (50%)  and  the  bedaquiline  group  (72%)  at  a  5%  level  of 
significance (2-sided). These proportions corresponded with a median time to conversion of 168 
days when treated with placebo and of 92 days when treated with bedaquiline.

Randomisation 
Following screening tests (Week –1), eligible subjects were hospitalised as per standard of care. 
Subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the two treatment groups. Randomisation of subjects 
was  stratified  for  both  trial  site  and  extent  of  lung  cavitation  as  determined  by  chest  X-ray  at 
screening.  However  a  detailed  description  of  the  procedure  has  not  been  presented.  Since  a 
minimization technique was used it is unclear whether a random component was included or a strict 
deterministic method was used. With a deterministic method the randomization could have been 
predictable by the investigator since one of the stratification factors was the centre. However, if this 
was the case it would most probably have favoured the placebo arm and is therefore not considered 
an issue. 
Blinding (masking) 
During  treatment  with  bedaquiline  or  placebo,  the  investigator,  the  sponsor  and  subject  had  to 
remain blinded regarding the treatment group the subject was randomised. The code could only be 
broken in case of an emergency regarding the need for further treatment.  
Statistical methods 
Study populations 
Three subject populations were defined: 
1.  Intent-to-treat population (ITT): all randomised subjects, who had at least 1 intake of 
double-blind study medication (bedaquiline/placebo). 
2.  Modified  intent-to-treat  population  (mITT):  the  subset  of  the  ITT  population 
excluding: 
-  Subjects whose MGIT results did not allow for primary efficacy evaluation (i.e. no evidence 
of  culture  positivity  prior  to  first  intake  or  no  results  during  the  first  8  weeks  after  first 
intake). 
-  Subjects infected with a DS or XDR M. tuberculosis strain or subjects for whom the MDR-TB 
status could not be confirmed based on DST results obtained prior to randomisation. 
3.  Per  protocol  population  (PP):  the  subset  of  the  mITT  population  that  has  no  major 
protocol violations. 
The  primary  analysis  population  was  the  mITT  population.  For  the  main  trial  C208  Stage  2  the 
following analyses were performed: 
Primary efficacy analysis was performed once all subjects had finished 24-weeks of treatment with 
bedaquiline or placebo (or discontinued earlier).  
Interim analysis was performed on data up to the cut-off date of 10 May 2011, at which time all 
subjects had completed the Week 72 visit or discontinued earlier.  
Final analysis was performed when all subjects had completed the trial (except for the rollover arm) 
or had discontinued earlier, including the completed 24-week investigational treatment period and 
completed 96-week follow-up period.

Drug Susceptibility Testing 
Drug susceptibility of isolates to anti-TB medications other than bedaquiline was determined by the 
proportion method on agar (7H11). Drug susceptibility of isolates to bedaquiline was assessed by 
determining MICs, using two methods: one using solid agar medium and one using liquid medium 
(REMA  method).  For  bedaquiline,  no  critical  concentration  to  define  resistance/susceptibility  is 
available.  Therefore,  subjects’  isolates  were  considered  to  have  decreased  susceptibility  to 
bedaquiline  when  they  had  a  4-fold  increase  in  MIC  compared  to  baseline.  However,  clinical 
relevance of 4-fold increase in MIC has not been established. 
Drug susceptibility testing was done on Day –1, at Weeks 8 and 24, and one year after the last dose 
of  bedaquiline  or  placebo  (i.e.,  at  Week  72),  and  also  at  the  end  of  trial.  Additional  drug 
susceptibility assessments were to be made in case of failure to respond to treatment, relapse, or 
re-infection.

Recruitment 
Stage 1 was initiated in June 2007 and enrolled 47 subjects (24 for placebo, 23 for bedaquiline) at 
6 sites in the Republic of South Africa.  The study terminated in December 2009. 
A large number of discontinuations were seen during the full study period, evenly between arms (13 
in  the  placebo  group  and  10  in  the  bedaquiline  group).  However,  the  main  interest  of  this 
exploratory stage study concerned the first 8 weeks, where only 2 and 3 patients, respectively, 
discontinued.  Although  major  protocol  violations  were  common,  mainly  related  to  deviation  of 
background regimens, this mainly occurred after the investigational period, and compliance to test 
agents were reportedly high. Demographics were similar between arms. The majority had cavities, 
BMIs were low (median 18), and the number of HIV positives were low (3 in each arm). Resistance 
to both R and INH was confirmed for all.  In the modified ITT population (mITT), relevant for the 
efficacy  evaluation,  3  patients  were  excluded  (1  randomized  to  bedaquiline,  2  to  placebo)  for 
reasons of negative culture and XDR-TB at baseline.  
Previous  therapy  (which  had  been  taken  by  the  vast  majority)  was  similar  between  arms,  and 
likewise baseline susceptibility to background agents. Importantly, the composition of background 
regimen was also quite similar during the investigational phase. 
Stage 2 started in April 2008. The main bulk of patients were recruited in South Africa, others in 
South  America,  Eastern  Europe  and  Asia.  Main  demographics  were  similar  between  arms.  With 
regards to disease characteristics it should be noted that lung cavitations were stratified for. HIV 
positive status (uncommon) was more frequent in the placebo-arm, and also low baseline albumin 
levels, factors that are related to worse outcomes. However, HIV patients all had high CD4 counts 
(and not on HIV therapy), and as seen in the efficacy evaluation not a predictor for outcome within 
the placebo arm (where in fact a numerically better outcome was noted for those HIV co-infected). 
With regards to baseline albumin levels, however, this was numerically a predictor for outcomes in 
the placebo group, and was reported as negative predictor for TB outcomes also in other studies. 
The applicant was therefore asked to confirm that the outcome data could be considered robust 
despite the imbalance in baseline albumin grade, table 13 below. This is discussed further down. 
Baseline susceptibility to main second line agents and other preferred background agents, on the 
other hand, were similar or rather in favour of the placebo-arm.

Note to previous table: For some patients, 20 subjects in the mITT population (12 in the bedaquiline group and 
8 in the placebo group), no confirmation from the central laboratory of INH and R resistance was available. They 
were defined as MDR, based on based on previous DST. Therefore, MDR  H&R plus pre-XDR does not add up to 
100%. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments  
All in all 5 amendments were implemented, plus a few country-specific. The CHMP considered that 
these amendments do not impact on the integrity of the study. Some of the issues handled concern 
the difficulties related to this study population, lack of resources in low income areas, and the strong 
impact of National guidelines on study protocols.

Time to culture conversion during the investigational phase was shorter in the bedaquiline treated 
patients. Numbers with 2 consecutive negative triplicate cultures before the end of week 8 was 
10/21 in the bedaquiline group and 2/23 in the placebo group (mITT).

Time to Culture Conversion (in Days)
When  applying  a  Cox  regression  model  adjusting  for  stratification  variables,  the  treatment 
difference  was  statistically  significant  (p  =  0.0034),  with  a  greater  probability  of  responding  to 
bedaquiline treatment compared to placebo treatment within the 8-week treatment period (hazards 
ratio [95% CI]: 11.77 [2.26; 61.23]). 
The time to culture conversion over 24 weeks (2 negative cultures, from triplicate sputa, collected 
at least 25 days apart) was considerably shorter for patients randomized to bedaquiline. For 50% of 
patients to convert, 78 days were needed in the bedaquiline arm, vs 129 days in the placebo-arm.

Figure 5: Proportion of culture positive subjects over time (24 week data, dropout = 
failure) – mITT 
Culture conversion rates at week 24 (8 weeks of investigational treatment and total 24 weeks of 
background treatment) was 81.0% in the bedaquiline group and 65.2%, not statistically significant 
(p = 0.288). 
Since  bedaquiline  was  given  for  only  8  weeks  in  stage  1,  further  results  in  stage  1  are  of  low 
interest, and not discussed in any detail in the Overview. While a higher conversion rate was seen 
at week 24, no relevant difference was seen in the final conversion rates. In summary stage one 
was successful in showing a difference in efficacy during the investigational treatment period, which 
was the aim.  
C208 stage 2 - single pivotal study  
160 patients were randomized and treated (ITT), and the mITT population (for efficacy evaluation) 
consisted  of  132  patients  (66  in  each  arm).  The  difference  between  the  mITT  and  the  ITT 
populations was due to the exclusion of patients in the former in case of failure of cultures to grow, 
or XDR TB being present.  
Discontinuations were common. Prior to week 24 (investigational period), 13 discontinued in the 
placebo arm and 17 in the placebo arm (16 and 21% respectively). At the end of study around 1/3 
had  left  the  study,  evenly  between  arms.  Stopping  rates  for  AEs,  and  personal  reasons  (might 
include AEs) were similar between arms.

Major protocol deviations were noted in 33 % of subjects in the mITT population, i.e., in 26% of 
subjects in the bedaquiline group and in 39% of subjects in the placebo group. The most frequently 
reported major protocol deviations were BR treatment interruption of > 2weeks. More patients in 
the placebo arm added TB medications not formally allowed in the protocol. 
Changes in the background regimen and compliance 
It was allowed that the BR regimen could be somewhat adjusted during the study. At baseline and 
still during the investigational stage, the BR regimens were quite similar between arms. After that 
time  point  there  were  differences  consisting  of  changing  injectable  and  adding  drugs  (mainly 
PAS-C) at higher rates in the placebo arm.  
In addition to cumulative frequencies, the precise number of background agents was presented 
during the procedure. Up to week 24 (investigational phase) the numbers and combinations used 
were very similar between arms. During the following phase (BR only), there was a clear trend for 
a higher number of agents used in the placebo-arm. With time (in practice when the injectable was 
stopped, previously mentioned), the BR consisted in 4 agents for the very main part of patients in 
the bedaquiline-arm, while in the placebo-arm a higher number of patients kept 5, or added more 
drugs (in total 6-7). 
Adherence data to test agents (bedaquiline/placebo) in the mITT population was, according to the 
report, high (>95%) throughout the 24 weeks of investigational phase, without relevant difference 
between arms. The company was asked to summarize the adherence to the background regimens 
(including  in  the  continuation  phase).  However,  although  DOT  applied,  this  was  with  time 
supervised by family members, friends or certain community members, and the company was not 
able to provide these figures.

Culture conversion was faster and more frequent in the bedaquiline group compared to the placebo 
group; median time to culture conversion 83 vs 125 days, figure next. This was significant using a 
Cox proportional hazards model (p < 0.0001) [95% CI]: 2.44 [1.57; 3.80]). 
Figure 6: 
Proportion of Culture Positive Subjects Over Time – mITT 
Major secondary end point: Culture conversion rates  
Culture conversion rates (missing=failure, mITT) were significantly higher in the TMC-arm by week 
24 (79% vs. 58%, respectively; p = 0.008). Importantly, this difference is maintained during the 
study, and was still significant 62% versus 44%) 6 months after stopping treatment (final analysis).  
The  “No  Overruling  analysis”  (discontinuations  subsequent  to  culture  conversion  disregarded), 
shows stable conversion rates (i.e. without late relapses) for both arms. In patients dropping out 
(high  rates  in  both  arms)  failure  to  convert  or  relapse  was  considerable  more  common  in  the 
placebo-arm (25/66 versus 14/66 patients in the mITT population). 
Deaths occurred at higher numbers in the bedaquiline group despite the improved anti-TB efficacy. 
This has been carefully reviewed, and very extensive time spans from last intake of drug to deaths, 
and causes of deaths are not indicative for a causal relation (discussed in detail in safety section).

C Based on a logistic regression model with treatment as covariate 
As mentioned above the applicant was asked to elaborate on the issue of an imbalance in baseline 
albumin levels: 
Firstly, it was shown that the around 20% difference in converting rates was true also when simply 
comparing the outcomes by albumin strata (Grade 1-2 and grade 3-4, respectively). Secondly, a 
logistic regression model was presented, where the estimated overall response rates correcting for 
baseline  albumin  was  found  to  be  76.7%  for  BDQ/BR  and  56.7%  for  placebo/BR,  resulting  in  a 
statistically significant treatment difference of 20.0% (p-value= 0.0198).  
It was also shown that imbalance in albumin levels rapidly disappeared during therapy (no main 
difference  at  week  4,  and  differences  not  present  from  week  6).  There  was  no  correlation  with 
baseline albumin levels and death within study or with relapse (from conversion back to positive 
cultures). In conclusion, the imbalance is thus not likely to have led to an overestimation of the 
treatment effect in favour of bedaquiline. 
Ancillary analyses 
For many subgroup parameters numbers are too low for relevant comparisons. In study C208 this 
concerns the HIV positives, for example. Outcome by degree of lung cavitations were consistent 
with the overall results.  
The  most  interesting  subgroup  analysis  would  concern  the  performance  of  bedaquiline  (versus 
placebo)  by  degree  of  predicted  background  activity.  This  is  shown  in  the  following  table  and 
comprises the 24 week data selection. That is an adequate time point, since the study size and 
number of drop out in the latter part of the study would make such an analysis less clear.

A pronounced effect of bedaquiline as compared to placebo is more obvious considering the lower 
activity of the BR. For patients treated with bedaquiline, high conversion rates were obtained when 
the  number  of  active  agents  in  the  BR  =3;  4  or  5  active  agents  did  not  seem  to  increase  the 
conversion rate.  
One issue for clarification is that in the analysis above (outcome by background activity) it is stated 
that baseline DST concerned (INH, R, EMB, SM, PZA), ETH, OFL, KAN, and CAP, while the preferred 
background regimen consisted of PZA, ETH,OFL, KAN, and cycloserine/terizidone. Hence, it seemed 
as if susceptibilities tested for did not reflect the preferred background regimen in study C208 since 
the same panel of drug sensibility testing was referred to, and the BR was highly individualized in 
that study. This was raised during the review, and for study C208, DST was performed for 4 out of 
the  5  drugs  included  in  the  BR;  not  for  cycloserine/terizidone,  due  to  the  lack  of  a  critical 
concentration  for  the  latter.  For  study  C209,  in  addition  susceptibility  to  linezolid,  CFZ, 
amoxicillin-clavulanate and thiacetazone were tested (where the susceptibility was decided based 
on the literature), and a summary of the number of active drugs in the background regimen was 
presented, shown later. 
Conversion rates in (few) patients infected with a strain susceptible to PZA were high; interesting 
having in mind the synergistic effects of bedaquiline and PZA seen in animals. 
Other secondary end point: Clinical correlates of microbiological response 
The company did, in line with guidelines and advice, present analyses of change in X-ray scores, 
change  in  weight  (in  responders  versus  non-responders).  As  expected,  they  did  not  note  any 
relevant differences by treatment in study C208.

Summary of main studies 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy 
as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

groups 
This is an ongoing stratified, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 
II trial, comparing bedaquiline vs placebo when added to a BR of MDR-TB therapy 
in subjects with newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive pulmonary MDR-TB 
infection.  
The trial is conducted in 2 consecutive stages: an exploratory stage (Stage 1; 8 
weeks of treatment with bedaquiline) and a proof-of-efficacy stage (Stage 2; 24 
weeks of treatment with bedaquiline). Subjects participating in Stage 1 were not 
allowed to enter Stage 2. The two stages are analysed separately. After the 
double-blind treatment phase, subjects continue to receive their MDR-TB 
treatment. They are followed for safety, tolerability, PK, and microbiological 
efficacy for 96 weeks after receiving their last dose of bedaquiline or placebo.  
The results presented below reflect the final results of Stage 2 consisting of the 
completed 24-week investigational treatment period and the 96-week follow-up 
period.  
Duration of main phase: 
Duration of Run-in phase: 
24 weeks 
1 week 
Duration of Extension phase: 
96 weeks 
The primary objective of Stage 2 is to demonstrate superiority in the antibacterial 
activity of bedaquiline compared to placebo when added to a background regimen 
(BR) for 24 weeks in subjects with newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive 
pulmonary MDR-TB infection. 
bedaquiline 
24 weeks double-blind treatment with 
bedaquiline in addition to a BR.  
bedaquiline is administered as 400 mg once 
daily (q.d.) for the first 2 weeks, and as 200 
mg 3 times/week (t.i.w.) for the following 22 
weeks. 
After these 24 weeks of treatment with 
bedaquiline subjects will continue a BR of 
MDR-TB therapy.

Time to SCC during the 24-week treatment 
period with bedaquiline or placebo was the 
primary outcome parameter for Stage 2 of 
trial C208 and was analysed during the 
primary (Week 24) efficacy analysis that was 
performed when all subjects had completed 
their 24-week treatment with bedaquiline or 
placebo (or had discontinued earlier). 
This parameter was based on the qualitative 
assessment of culture growth in MGIT using 
spot  sputum  samples.  Sputum  culture 
conversion  was  defined  as  having  2 
consecutive  negative  MGIT  cultures  from 
spot sputa collected at least 25 days apart.  
The proportion of subjects with MGIT sputum 
culture  conversion  was  determined  using  2 
response  definitions  (missing  =  failure,  and 
no  overruling)  at  Week  24,  Week  36,  Week 
48,  Week  60,  Week  72  and  at  the  last

- 
Subjects  infected  with  a  DS  or  XDR  M.  tuberculosis  strain  or  subjects  for 
whom the MDR-TB status could not be confirmed based on DST results taken 
prior to randomisation.  
For the final Stage 2 analysis, the mITT population was used for efficacy analyses 
at Week 24 and at the end of trial.

Supportive study 
Study C209 - single-armed phase 2b  
This study is ongoing and recruited patients in Asia including China (36%), South Africa (34%), 
Eastern Europe (22%) and. South America (8%). Hence, the population is more diverse than in 
C208, and regions differ likely with regards to resources etc. 
It was started in April 2009, and final results (including 6 months follow-up post treatment) are 
expected to be submitted soon after granting of the Marketing authorisation. 
The same dosing and duration of bedaquiline was given, as in study C208, stage 2 (i.e. 400 mg qd 
for 2 weeks, followed by 200 mg t.i.w for 22 weeks). BR was individualized according to national 
treatment guidelines (i.e. not a “preferred” BR regimen as in stud C208), for a total duration of 
72-96 weeks (minimum 12 months after culture conversion). 
In contrast to study C208, this study included patients with previous MDR-TB treatment, and also 
including  those  with  XDR-TB,  provided  that  the  BR  regimen  would  likely  to  add  up  to  3  active 
agents. Apart from this, inclusion/exclusion criteria resembled those of study C208. 
Baseline regimen 
The  difference  in  baseline  regimen  in  study  C209,  as  compared  to  C209  stage  2,  table  19. 
Capreomycin (similar to the aminoglycosides, but not formally that class) was used to a greater 
extent  in  C209;  the  type  of  fluoroquinolone  used  differed.  Among  “miscellaneous  drugs”, 
clofazimine was used in some (but still few) patients in study C209.

From a safety point of view, the variety of BR drugs could be considered a strength; this is the way 
bedaquiline would be used in clinical practice for the treatment of MDR-TB. In the next table the 
background regimens of study C208 and C209 are compared. One drug, clofazimine, is of particular 
relevance, with regards to possible similarities in resistance mechanism and QT-prolongation effect, 
and the planned phase 3 study.

As mentioned in section for study C208, the company was asked to further clarify how the number 
of active agents in the BR actually was counted. In addition to the panel of antibiotics tested in the 
C208 trial (INH, R, EMB, SM, PZA, ETH, OFL, KAN, CA) linezolid, CFZ, amoxicillin-clavulanate and 
thiacetazone  were  tested  based  on  requests  from  the  investigators.  Below  is  a  comparison  of 
frequencies (subset of patients) for drugs without critical concentrations (but data also taken from 
the literature), upper cells, and restricted to drugs with validated concentrations, lower cells. It is 
obvious  that  the  two  ways  of  doing  this  yields  similar  results  (i.e.  restricted  to  validated 
concentrations  or  not).  When  comparing  Agar  vs  REMA,  isolates  that  would  be  deemed  as 
susceptible  to  ≥3  of  tested  agents  (sum  of  3,4,5)  the  Agar  method  yielded  a  slightly  higher 
frequency of such answer, than did REMA.

At  a  time  when  all  patients  had  passed  week  24,  and  around  60%  week  36,  some  13%  of  the 
patients had stopped, see next table. This could be compared with 19% of patients in study C208 
stage 2 stopping before week 24. Hence, this trial population had better retention rates, which may 
have been associated with a higher overall compliance.

Results 
Time to culture conversion was 57 days in this study, slightly shorter than in study C208.  
Conversion rates by week 24 were around 80%, well in line with study C208. Outcome by activity 
in  background  regimen  was  discussed  in  previous  section  for  study  C208,  and  the  analysis  is 
questioned, for reasons mentioned. Hence, C209 supports the efficacy of bedaquiline, and have 
yielded  important  results,  for  example  with  regards  to  various  background,  that  should  be 
evaluated not at least when designing the phase 3 study.

Referring back to the issue around number of active drugs in BR (validated/also non-validated data) 
discussed previous page, the company also presented conversion rates by number of active drugs, 
taking into account all tested drugs (validated/non-validated), for a subset of 164 patients available 
for such analysis, below. Three active agents yielded maximum effect as outline din the table below.

Further analyses - with data from both study C208 + C209 
It  is  stated  (SmPC)  that  bedaquiline  should  be  used  in  combination  with  at  least  3  other  active 
agents. However, available agents used in MDR TB  therapy are likely  not considered as equally 
effective. The main classes are presently the injectables and fluoroquinolones (efficacy likely higher 
than other available second line agents). Since the proposed indication opens for therapy also in 
patients  with  pre-XDR  and  XDR  TB  (i.e.  where  resistance  to  these  agents  is  present),  and  only 
limited data is available for pre-XDR patients (resistance to 1 main second line agent), and hardly 
any data for XDR-TB patients (resistance to both main classes), the company was asked to further 
elaborate on whether (any) 3 active agents is a safe advice also in the case of pre-XDR and XDR-TB.  
When  responding  to  this  issue,  the  company  provided  data  on  to  what  extent  the  background 
regimens available for patients in study C209 yielded active agents (>3 or ≥3) by type of resistance

status, table below. It is evident, that for patients with pre-XDR and in particular XDR-TB 3 active 
agents in the BR was seldom the case.

However, when looking at the 24 week conversion rates (a time point when only few patients had 
left the studies for non-efficacy reasons) by type of regimen (next table), high conversion rates 
were seen also in the case a FQ or an injectable was not active/used.  
In study C209 the number of patients with advanced resistance was higher. Although numbers are 
low, it is to be noted that high conversion rates (around 75%) were seen also for patients with <3 
active agents in the background regimen, as long as either an active injectable or FQ was part of the 
regimen (=Pre-XDR patients, with only 1 active BR agent in addition to the injectable/FQ).

Hence, it can be concluded, that available data would justify that bedaquiline can in practice be used 
safely  (from  an  efficacy  perspective)  with  3  other  active  agents,  definitely  as  long  as  an  active 
injectable or FQ is part of that BR (i.e. pre-XDR TB) - and all guidelines recommends the inclusion 
of those classes. For patients lacking both an active injectable and FQ, can in practice hardly ever 
achieve an BR combination of 3 active agents, and for these patients bedaquiline may be the only 
chance to still cure the infection. 
Resistance development to bedaquiline, and evaluation of assay (agar vs REMA) 
For determination of MIC-values against bedaquiline both agar method (standard in an EU setting) 
and Resazurin Microtiter Assay (REMA) were used. While Agar is the standard method, REMA will 
likely  represent  the  method  of  choice  in  resource  poor  countries  given  its  low  cost,  technical 
simplicity  and  rapid  results,  and  was  endorsed  by  the  WHO.  To  be  noted,  manipulation  of 
REMA-plates could generate aerosols and precautions should be given to the users. 
Due the lack of critical concentration to define resistance/susceptibility for bedaquiline from start, 
the company  focused on subjects with at least a 4-fold increase in MIC from  baseline to failure 
(using  solid  media,  Agar  method).  The  number  of  patients  (or  rather  isolates)  where  such  an 
increase was detected is still low, and concerned mainly patients with XDR-TB failing therapy in 
study C209, table.  
Having in mind the numbers of non-responders, for example also in the bedaquiline arm in study 
C208, the number of patients with resistance development to bedaquiline seems low (for example 
2/14 who failed to convert/relapsed with bedaquiline in C208, stage 2), table 26 below. However, as 
mentioned  it  was  clarified  during  the  review  that  not  all  isolates  from  those  who  failed  to 
convert/relapsed  where  sent  for  DST  (but  in  relation  to  predefined  time  points).  However,  the 
company  adequately  provided  the  reasons  for  such  “missing  samples”  and  will  have  different 
logistics for this in phase 3.

Based on available data, the following provisional MIC breakpoints are proposed by the EUCAST: 
Epidemiological  Cut-Off  (ECOFF)  0.25  mg/l,  Clinical  Breakpoints  S  ≤0.25  mg/l;  R  >  0.25  mg/l. 
These breakpoints concern both AGAR and REMA methods, and are reflected in the SmPC Section 
5.1. The provisional breakpoints might be revised in the future when more data are available from 
the STREAM study. 
Resistance development to other TB Drugs (study C208, stage 2) 
Data  is  discussed  only  for  study  C208,  since  this  study  was  controlled,  and  the  same  preferred 
backbone  was  used.  To  compare  the  rate  of  de  novo  resistance  to  BR  agents  is  of  high  clinical 
interest as well as to evaluate to what extent bedaquiline can protect from resistance development 
to the other second line agents of the regimen. (Of note, not all isolates from patients who failed 
therapy were sent for DST testing, but that applied for both arms). 
In  table  27  de  novo  resistance  (end  point  vs  baseline),  without  regard  to  what  agents  the  BR 
contained, is shown. Paired results were available for 12 patients in the bedaquiline group and for 
31 in the placebo group.  
De novo resistance to at least 1 of the tested drugs had emerged in isolates from only 2/10 patients 
in the bedaquiline group, to be compared to in 16/31 patients in the placebo group.  
These results are of main interest, and are further proof for bedaquiline showing relevant activity to 
MDR-TB. IT is however acknowledged that verifying effects in a population with high dropout rates 
and low adherence is difficult.

Cross resistance 
Analyses  could  not  show  any  signs  for  cross  resistance  causing  reduced  susceptibility  to 
bedaquiline. Looking the other way around, a not confirmed trend for increased MICs to clofazimine 
was noted in isolates with higher MICs to bedaquiline. There is currently not enough clinical data to 
confirm that finding, which will be studied as one aspect within the confirmatory study.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In view of study C202, the CHMP considered that the ethics of performing exploratory studies for a 
new agent in monotherapy (first time efficacy studies in infected humans) in such patients, who 
have  other  effective  treatment  options,  is  quite  questionable.  The  design  and  conduct  of  the 
submitted studies C208 and C209 were considered satisfactory. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Clinically  relevant  antimycobacterial  efficacy  of  bedaquiline  in  patients  with  various  amounts  of 
resistance to other TB agents has been demonstrated in a phase IIb trial. Time to culture conversion 
as  well  as  conversion  rates  were  superior  with  bedaquiline  as  compared  to  placebo.  De  novo 
resistance to agents in the background regimen was more commonly seen in non-responders in the 
placebo group, than in those treated with bedaquiline. In summary, this may support the conclusion 
that  TMC-207  when  appropriately  used  would  contribute  to  a  higher  efficacy,  or  make  possible 
shorter  treatment  duration  with  maintained  efficacy,  when  used  for  the  treatment  of  TB  with 
significant resistance to presently available agents. 
Results  obtained  in  the  controlled  study  (C208  stage  2)  are  supported  by  the  data  from  the 
un-controlled study of larger size (C209). 
The vast majority of patients who entered the phase 2 studies had failed previous therapy with first 
line agents. To what extent they were initially infected with TB resistant to part of that first line 
therapy  (overall  cure  rates  well  over  90%),  or  whether  resistance  developed  due  to  first  line 
treatment failure, is unknown. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
Phase 3 study 
The company is applying for a conditional approval based on the data from phase 2b studies. Having 
the limited data base of phase 2b in mind, both with regards to efficacy and safety, a phase 3 study 
is of crucial importance to get further insights into the efficacy of bedaquiline.  The need for a phase 
3 study, following such an approval, has also been stressed as part of the CHMP scientific advice.  
The company has proposed a confirmatory phase III study, where the mentioned Bangladesh 
regimen (Van Deun 2010) will be compared to two different simplified bedaquiline based regimens. 
This will be done as part of an already ongoing, much cited, study called STREAM.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 79/108 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Only patients with MDR H&R TB will be included, not patients with pre-XDR or XDR TB. This is 
endorsed, having in mind the effectiveness already proven for bedaquiline in phase 2b.  
The STREAM study regimen is based on the regimen described by Van Deun in 2010; it consists of 
a  potent  fluoroquinolone  (FQ)  (moxifloxacin  [MOX]  or  levofloxacin  [LFX]),  clofazimine  (CFZ), 
ethambutol (EMB) and pyrazinamide (PZA) given for nine months (40 weeks), supplemented by 
kanamycin (KM), isoniazid (INH) and protionamide (PTO) in the first four months (16 weeks), i.e., 
the intensive phase. All drugs are given daily (seven days a week) except for KM, which is given 
three times per week from week 12 onwards. The intensive phase can be extended from 16 to 20 or 
24 weeks for patients whose AFB smear has not converted by 16 or 20 weeks respectively.  
In the already ongoing stage 1 of STREAM, patients are randomized to either the study regimen 
(Arm A) or the locally-used WHO-approved MDR-TB regimen (Arm B), now referred to as stage 1. 
400 subjects are intended to be randomized to the Bangladesh or WHO regimen in a 2:1 ratio (267 
versus 133 subjects).  
In stage 2 of STREAM (the confirmatory phase III study), two additional experimental arms will be 
included, i.e. an all oral Bangladesh-modified regimen (Arm C, N = 250 subjects) and a 28-week 
regimen (Arm D, N = 250 subjects).  These will be compared to patients concurrently randomized 
to the 40 week regimen (Arm A), figure below. Randomization of stage 2 will likely be started before 
stage 1 randomization is completed and will be done in a 2|2|2|1(WHO) ratio until 133 subjects in 
the WHO arm are recruited, which is the targeted sample size for performing the stage 1 analysis. 
After this, randomization will continue for the remaining 3 arms in a 2/2/2 ratio.  
The drug doses in both regimens will be the same as those given in the 40-week control regimen 
(Arm A). In Arm A, weigh based MOX is used (400-800 mg daily). In arms C and D LFX is used 
(750-1000 mg daily). The reason for having levofloxacin rather than moxifloxacin in the bedaquiline 
arms pertains to the possible added risk for QT-prolongation with moxifloxacin (as compared to 
levofloxacin).  Based  on  the  current  enrolment  in  stage  1,  LFX  is  also  the  most  commonly  used 
fluoroquinolone in the WHO-approved MDR-TB regimen (Arm B).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 80/108 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy outcome is status at the end of follow-up (i.e. the proportion of patients with 
a favourable outcome) 68 weeks after randomization. Secondary efficacy endpoints concern weeks 
92 and 132. 
The CHMP considers that the study design is adequate and informative:  
In arm C bedaquiline will replace the injectable during the intensive phase (and be part of the 
regimen throughout the 9 months treatment). Injectables are problematic with regards to safety 
and logistics; and an all oral regimen without the need for the presently available injectables would 
have great advantages provided that efficacy is not negatively affected. 
In Arm D bedaquiline replaces PTO and INH during the intensive phase, and the treatment duration 
is shortened from 40 weeks to 28 weeks. PTO and high dose INH are associated with tolerability 
problems (e.g., hepatotoxicity concerns), and the effect of at least high dose INH (in patients with 
INH resistance) can hardly be considered well established. A shortened treatment duration is of 
considerable practical importance, and may translate into a higher real life effectiveness.  
The final synopsis for the study includes for stage 2 a primary week 68 analysis, a week 92 
follow-up analysis and the final week 132 analysis. 
Due dates for reports to be submitted to EMA/CHMP as part of the Specific Obligation will be as 
follows:

In addition to evaluating the efficacy (including resistance development) and safety (including the 
follow up on mortality for at least 2 years after stopping therapy), a number of PK issues should  be 
addressed within the study. Overall the CHMP consider that the confirmatory phase III study 
adequately addresses the remaining list of outstanding issues, as part of a conditional approval, and 
that the time lines are acceptable. 
Other planned studies 
Longer term treatment in early access programmes (EAP) 
Bedaquiline 100mg tablets are available under nominative Temporary Authorisation for Use (ATU) 
(named-patient use) granted by the ANSM (Medicine and Health Products Safety Agency, France) 
since March 2011. 
An EAP is therefore currently on-going in France, which is the only early access program where 
extension of treatment >24 weeks occurred.  
Preliminary information have been provided which showed that up to 14 September 2013, out of 
the 81 patients currently in the French program, 34 patients have been treated for > 6 months (of

which  22  patients  have  been  treated  for  more  than  9  months  and  6  patients  for  more  than  12 
months). However, no formal assessment of these data has yet been conducted. 
Paediatric trial 
The planned paediatric development program has been agreed with the EMA Paediatric Committee 
(PDCO).  This  concerns  a  phase  I/II  trial  in  TB-infected  subjects  (<  18  years  old),  evaluating 
pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety and tolerability of bedaquiline in pulmonary MDR-TB infected 
children and adolescents.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In first line therapy high cure rates are achieved with a moderate number of very efficient drugs 
taken for 6 months (3 drugs for 2 months, and 2 drugs for the following 4 months). Bedaquiline 
seems to share similar qualities to the main first line drugs, for example in terms of its sterilizing 
activity in various animal models.  
Considering that the evidence of efficacy is based on a surrogate endpoint and that the overall data 
from the phase II trial are limited, further confirmation of efficacy is considered as a condition for 
the approval. This is considered to be adequately addressed in a coming phase 3 study  that the 
company commits to perform as outlined above, which will provide complementary information on 
the efficacy of bedaquiline in regimens aimed at simplifying and shortening of treatment. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA:   
To  gather  additional  efficacy  and  safety  data  of  bedaquiline  in  different  treatment  regimen 
compared to a regimen that does not include bedaquiline (“STREAM-study stage”). 
In addition, the CHMP made the following recommendations for future development: 
• 
• 
The  applicant  should  submit  the  final  study  report  for  study  C209  after  granting  of  the 
Marketing Authorisation 
Efavirenz is a key drug for HIV therapy, both in Europe and in particular in lower income 
regions  globally  -  where  MDR-TB  is  prevalent.  It  is  considered  a  better  drug  than 
nevirapine,  both  for  reasons  of  efficacy  and  safety.  A  dose  recommendation  is  would 
therefore  be  of  high  value.  Based  on  preliminary  DDI  data,  efavirenz  is  presently  to  be 
avoided with bedaquiline according to the SmPC, and will not be used in the STREAM study.  
According to published modelling data for this combination, it may indeed be possible to 
dose adjust in order to maintain adequate exposure to bedaquiline (Svensson et al, AAC 
2013), although the safety implications of changed metabolite exposures (M2, M3) would 
need  to  be  taken  into  account.  The  applicant  is  encouraged  to  perform  a  DDI  study  of 
adequate duration. A study protocol for the latter is recommended to be reviewed by the 
CHMP prior to the start of such a study.

•  At present there is only one packet size; a bottles containing 188 tablets, that is to say a full 
treatment for 24 weeks duration. The CHMP is aware that the applicant is currently working 
on  revising  the  packaging  (with  collecting  corresponding  stability  data),  this  is  indeed 
necessary and should be made in a timely manner. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Complicated background regimen with potential toxicity 
Cure rates in the treatment of MDR-TB are generally lower as compared to first line therapy for drug 
sensitive TB. Treatment is much more complex, including at least 5 second-line anti-TB drugs for an 
extended  period  of  time,  lasting  up  to  2 years.  As  understood  from  prior  sections  attempts  are 
presently taken with shorter therapies, but then with an even higher number of “second line drugs” 
included, none of which were initially developed for the treatment of TB. 
The  two  most  important  classes  of  second-line  anti-TB  drugs  are  the  injectable  drugs  (i.e., 
capreomycin  and  the  aminoglycosides  amikacin  and  kanamycin)  and  the  fluoroquinolones.  In 
addition there are a number of miscellaneous drugs, less efficacious and in many cases with poor 
tolerability/safety. 
Unlike the first-line drugs, the second-line drugs and combinations of these have not been formally 
tested in randomized controlled trials, making the safety profile of individual drugs or combinations 
very difficult to assess.  
Toxicitites of bedaquiline - data from preclinical studies 
The  following  target  organs  and  systems  for  bedaquiline  were  seen  in  pre-clinical  studies.  The 
NOAEL margin for bedaquiline as dosed in phase 2b is around 1, while that exposure margin to 
verified toxicities in animals are around 4 or higher (pending on species and organ system). The 
same margins for M2 (which seemed to be the main driver of toxicity in animals) were many times 
higher.

Effects in mice were considered species-specific as mice showed much higher concentrations of the 
main  metabolite  (M2)  relative  to  the  parent  compound  bedaquiline  and  direct  dosing  of  the 
metabolite showed that the toxicity observed in mice was probably related to M2.  
Based  on  these  findings,  clinical  trials  included  specific  safety  monitoring  for  liver,  pancreas, 
musculoskeletal  system,  heart  muscle  (including  cardiac  rhythm  disturbances),  and  the 
gastrointestinal system. 
Patient exposure 
The evaluation of the clinical safety of bedaquiline for the treatment of pulmonary MDR-TB in adults 
is predominantly based on data from 11 phase I trials and 3 phase II trials.  
The total number of subjects exposed to bedaquiline in these trials was 645 (table 28): 265 non-TB 
infected  subjects  received  bedaquiline  in  Phase  I  trials  and  380  TB-infected  subjects  received 
bedaquiline in Phase II trials.

Adverse events 
The main safety data originated from the phase 2b studies.  When comparing controlled (of highest 
interest, but low numbers) and un-controlled data the following should be noted: 
Disease severity (numbers with cavitations etc.) was similar between studies, but known XDR-TB 
was allowed only in C209 (around 20% in ITT population).  
The same preferred background regimen (BR) was recommended for all patients in study C208, and 
no relevant difference in  BR  agents were noted between the arms (bedaquiline versus placebo) 
here. In contrast, the BR was individualized in study C209. Hence, background regimens differed. 
In study C209 85% of the patients were already on second line TB therapy at time of study entry, 
while study C208 only included patients naïve to such therapy, and with a minimum of 7 days wash 
out from first line agents.  
During  the  investigational  phase  (bedaquiline  or  placebo)  serious  adverse  events  were  more 
common with bedaquiline than with placebo in study C208, but not with a permanent treatment

discontinuation as a result (see table 29 below). Similar or lower numbers of AEs were seen in study 
C209 (despite the more diverse background regimens). This is likely because the latter patients 
were in the vast majority of cases already on second line treatment when entering the study, while 
patients in study C208 were naïve to such therapy.

bedaquiline/placebo was given for 8 weeks in stage 1, 24 weeks in stage 2 and 24 weeks in study C209. 
When looking at any  AE in study  C208 stage 2, regardless of severity and including AEs with a 
frequency  of  5%  in  either  arm,  arthralgia  (33  vs  22%),  headache  (28  vs  12%),  increased 
transaminases (5 vs 0%) and perhaps anaemia (6 vs 2.5%) were more frequently reported in the 
bedaquiline-arm. For other AEs no relevant difference between arms were noted.   
When  comparing  stage  2  of  C208  and  study  C209,  AEs  show  the  same  pattern,  but  in  a  lower 
frequency in study  C209 for reasons speculated on  previous page. This may  be reassuring with 
regards to the use of bedaquiline in combination with a variety of background agents (individualized 
in study C209).

Deaths in study C208 
An updated report of all deaths was retrieved on 16 November 2012. This includes the final results 
for study C208 (both stages) plus available data for study C209. The data in table 32 and onwards 
refers to that report.

In study C208, there was an imbalance in the number of deaths between the bedaquiline group and 
the placebo group (12 vs. 4 patients) in stage 1 + 2, and for stage 2 only (pivotal study, bedaquiline 
vs. placebo for 24 weeks) these figures where 10 versus 2 (see table below). Apart from following 
patients within study C208 (and study C209), the company collected data on follow-up survival for 
all  patients  who  left  the  phase  2b  studies  for  reasons  other  than  withdrawing  consent.  They 
managed to follow the majority of such patients. Hence, the figures below concern all deaths, also 
those in patients who had left the study.

Causes of deaths in patients exposed to bedaquiline in C208, stage 2. 
Deaths in patients allocated to bedaquiline in study C208 occurred with 1 exception, (patient found 
dead  at  road  side,  with  a  blood  alcohol  content  of  3.73),  in  patients  who  had  already  stopped 
bedaquiline since very long (range 86 days to 911 days; median 329 days).  
Out  of  the  total  10  deaths,  5  were  linked  to  worsened  TB.  All  5  occurred  in  patients  with 
non-response  to  the  MDR TB  therapy  (2  who  never  had  converted,  3  relapsers).  They  occurred 
281-787 days after last intake. 
The remaining 5 deaths, seemingly non-TB related, where all different and without any obvious 
connection to the potential safety concerns of bedaquiline, (see table 33 for diagnoses). With the 
exception of the early case occurring 2 days after intake, mentioned above, all other cases were late 
(86-911 days after last intake of bedaquiline). 
None of the patients who died, had been recorded to QTc of >500 ms during ECG recordings which 
were regularly monitored.

Hence,  the  numbers  of  deaths  were  higher  in  the  bedaquiline  group  in  this  randomized  study. 
During careful evaluation of narratives neither the pattern of deaths, nor the duration from last 
intake are indicative for a causal relation per se.  
Although a causal relation was not likely in phase 2 (above), this issue must also be adequately 
followed up in the confirmatory phase III study.  
Deaths in study C209 
To  be  noted  all  patients  have  passed  week  24  (where  bedaquiline  was  stopped)  in  study  C209 
(n=233). 
 In the updated report (including data up to mid-July 2012), 12 deaths were reported in patients 
while in study, and another 4 in patients followed after study discontinuation. The pattern of deaths 
was similar to that described above for study C208. Hence, worsened TB dominated (10/16), and 
deaths typically occurred a long time after bedaquiline had been stopped (13/16 > 1 month after, 
and typically much longer). No death related to hepatic events was reported.

Laboratory findings 
To repeat, based on pre-clinical findings, clinical trials included specific safety monitoring for liver, 
pancreas, musculoskeletal system, heart muscle (including cardiac rhythm disturbances), and the 
gastrointestinal system. Hence, these organ systems and relevant lab chemistry for related events 
are of particular interest. 
A  number  of  enzymes/parameters  related  to  the  specific  safety  issues  mentioned  above  were 
followed. For common blood chemistry, and the specifically monitored tests, relevant differences 
(bedaquiline versus placebo) were seen only for liver enzymes, table 34

When plotting liver enzymes over time AST, to some extent ALT, and GGT showed modest mean 
increases, with a quite slow onset, which returned to baseline values after stopping therapy.  
To be noted levels of bilirubin were not relevantly affected, and mean ALP values decreased slightly 
over time. 
This  slow  onset,  also  seen  for  QTc  changes  (discussed  next)  might  be  associated  to  the 
phospholipidogenic potential of the drug. 
However in summary the CHMP  concluded during the procedure (mainly based on non-clinical data 
as discussed above) that firstly, significant phospholipidosis is unlikely to occur with the exposure 
seen in humans, and was not a consistent finding in animals with sign of toxicity (liver, muscle). 
Secondly, longer term animal data does not support an accumulation of bedaquiline or M2 in tissues, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 91/108 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
and plasma levels in patients (C208, stage 1) was slightly lower at week 8 (200 mg thrice weekly) 
than at the end of the second week (400 mg daily). Finally, neither in vitro studies, nor in vivo data, 
nor EM studies on mice, were indicative for a mitochondrial toxicity. 
While 3 patients (out of 102 patients) stopped bedaquiline due to a hepatic event in study C208 
(none in the placebo group), none of the 233 patients in study C209 did so.  For those who stopped 
bedaquiline, no linkage was found to any specific background agent (more or less identical during 
the investigational phase in study C208).   
Any case which fulfilled the definition of HY´s law was searched for. One questionable case was 
found, who fullfilled the defintion. The event occured at week 24 right at the end of bedaquiline 
treatment period, with rapid recovery. However,  the very same reaction occurred also at week 84, 
now with the background regimen only. The man had a heavy alcohol intake, including a history of 
alcohol hepatitis, and the case seems cofounded.  
In summary, monitoring for liver toxicity should be continued in future studies, and during therapy 
with bedaquiline. This is adequately handled in the proposed labelling. 
QT-findings during therapy with bedaquiline 
A positive hERG assay was seen in non-clinical studies, and QT prolongation was noted in a 6-month 
study in dogs using a high dose of bedaquiline. In contrast, a thorough QT study using a single dose 
of 800 mg was negative.  
In study C208 ECGs were followed at pre-specified time points. It was obvious that QTc-intervals 
increased  significantly  in  the  bedaquiline-group  (versus  placebo).  In  line  with  changes  in  liver 
enzymes there was a slow and gradual onset, maximum at around week 18, and stable until week 
24  (here  bedaquiline  was  stopped).  The  largest  mean  increase  in  QTcF  was  15.7  ms  in  the 
bedaquiline group (at Week 18), versus 6.2 ms in the placebo group (at Week 18).  
1 patient in the bedaquiline group showed a QTc > 500 ms (none in the placebo group).

Figure 8 Stage 2: Mean (SE) changes from reference in QTcF over time 
Similar increases in QTc were seen in study C209 (around + 15 ms). Here a significant finding was 
seen  with  regards  to  background  regimen;  increases  were  substantially  larger  in  patients  with 
concomitant  clofazimine  (n=13)  (Week  24,  31.94  ms  versus  12.28  ms  in  patients  without  that 
drug).  
Although bedaquiline does have an impact on QTc, changes as compared to placebo (background 
regimens  very  similar)  are  still  moderate  (mean  difference  around  10  ms  at  week  18,  when 
maximum increase was achieved). Total increase, around 15 ms, is also moderate, although above 
the common threshold of 10 ms referred to in drug development.  
To put in perspective, during methadone therapy (opioid substitution therapy) a mean increase in 
QTc of 34 ms was reported in one controlled study, where 6/56 (11%) had a QT-prolongation > 500 
ms after longer term therapy (Andrew et al, Cardiology Journal 2009).  
This issue has also been discussed in relation to the confirmatory phase III study, where clofazimine 
will be a part of the background regimen. In that study there will be a close monitoring of ECGs, and 
a DSMB will review data regularly. In the present SmPC the risk for increased QtC prolongations 
with this agent is stated. 
Safety in special populations 
Such studies have not yet been performed, with exception for single dose studies of low relevance.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In all DDI studies, safety observations in the treatment phase in which the respective concomitant 
medication  was  co-administered  with  bedaquiline  was  comparable  with  those  in  the  treatment 
phase where bedaquiline was administered alone. By SOC and preferred term, no clinically relevant 
differences in the incidence of AEs were observed between both treatment phases. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of bedaquiline /placebo in the pooled Phase IIb trials are 
presented in the table below. 
Table  35:  Pooled  Phase  IIb  Trials:  AEs  leading  to  permanent  stop  of  bedaquiline 
/placebo during the Investigational Treatment phase 
N = number of ITT subjects with data; n = number of ITT subjects with this observation 
Of note, One subject discontinued due to lipase increased (grade 3) which is an AE of special 
interest for bedaquiline in the phase I studies. However, based on these limited data no specific 
safety signals could be detected.  
In study C208, there was one discontinuation due to a fatal myocardial infarction, where highly 
pathological coronary artery vessels were confirmed (as detailed above). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 94/108 
 
  
  
 
 
Of note, during the first 24 weeks in C209, one grade 3 AE of ECG QT-prolongation was reported, 
and led to permanent discontinuation of bedaquiline, however no AEs with preferred term torsade 
de pointes were reported in this study. 
Overall, the frequency of AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug in the Phase IIb trials was low 
in  the  controlled  trials  and  it  was  slightly  higher  for  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  than  for  the 
bedaquiline  group  (4.8%  vs.  3.9%  in  the  Any  Placebo  group  and  Any  Bedaquiline  group, 
respectively). 
It is noted that for the AEs of special interest; more patients discontinued in the Any Bedaquiline 
group than in the Any Placebo group due to “transaminases increased” (3 subjects - 2.9% vs. 0%, 
respectively). These 3 events started on Day 142, 11 and 49, respectively. For 2 of these subjects 
the AE hepatitis B was concurrently reported.  
In the pooled controlled + uncontrolled trials, 1 subject in the Any Bedaquiline group discontinued 
because of ECG QT prolonged. However, for blood amylase and lipase increased there was 1.0% (in 
total 2 subjects) in the Any Placebo group that discontinued versus none in the Any Bedaquiline 
group. The number of discontinuations is low in total and no apparent trends could be observed. 
Post marketing experience 
No post marketing safety data was submitted during the review of this application. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
When discussing the safety profile of bedaquiline, the severity of the disease to be treated, and the 
safety (and suboptimal efficacy) of other second-line agents should be kept in mind. 
In the study with relevance for a present approval, C208 stage 2, a higher number of deaths were 
seen in patients randomized to bedaquiline, (n=10), than in the placebo group (n=2). During 
careful evaluation of narratives neither the pattern of deaths, nor the duration from last intake are 
indicative for a causal relation per se, but an effect of a small size study. However, it is crucial that 
survival will be followed adequately in phase III, with special reference to patients leaving the 
study; the company is requested discuss the details on this issue. It should be noted that the 
reported on-study death rates in studies/cohorts on MDR TB therapy is reported to be 10-15%. In 
an EU cohort concerning around 1200 patients who had been treated for 24 months, this figure was 
16% (reported in 2008 by the ECDC). Hence, from this perspective the death rate in the placebo 
arm in study C208 was low. 
Serious adverse events were few, and not markedly different between bedaquiline and placebo. A 
slight effect on liver enzymes was noted (transaminases, GGT), with a slow and gradual onset. This 
did not translate into any clinical events, and no case adequately fulfilling Hy´s law has been seen 
so far. A moderate QT effect, with the same slow onset and without relation to exposure parameters 
(AUC or Cmax), was seen in phase 2b. The increase in QTc seemed to stabilize after around 18 
weeks (out of total 24 weeks) of therapy.  
The metabolism of bedaquiline is not fully elucidated; CYP3A is the main pathway. Lacking adequate 
interaction studies, inducers (potentially lowering efficacy) and inhibitors (potentially increasing 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 95/108 
 
  
  
 
toxicity) were not allowed in phase 2b. Since TB patients also commonly are infected with HIV 
where inducers (NNRTIs) and inhibitors (PIs) generally would be part of the HIV therapy, this is a 
very important issue for the company to study further. A number of post approval measures 
pertaining to pharmacokinetics are therefore requested (PAMs, section 7.1), and the company is 
requested to perform DDI studies within the coming confirmatory study. 
In summary, based on the available data, the safety issues do not preclude a positive benefit-risk. 
However, based on the limited number of patients studied, and some remaining uncertainties 
around the safety of bedaquiline, the benefit risk is presently considered positive for a more 
restricted indication (i.e. patients who cannot achieve a fully active MDR TB regimen for reasons of 
resistance or tolerability).  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
In the confirmatory phase III study, QT prolongation will be monitored throughout. Follow up on 
mortality will be done for at least 2 years on all patients, as requested by the CHMP.  After stopping 
therapy it is intended to have a long-term mortality follow-up.  
In addition to the STREAM study, a multi-country MDR TB registry is planned for by the applicant 
and is reflected in the RMP. This registry will compare safety issues, some efficacy measures and 
non-regulatory end points in patients who receive or not bedaquiline as part of MDR-TB therapy.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In summary, based on the available data, the safety issues do not preclude a positive benefit-risk, 
and can be handled by appropriate labeling and further follow up in future studies. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
In the confirmatory phase III study, QT prolongation will be monitored throughout. Follow-up on 
mortality will be done for at least 2 years on all patients, as requested by the CHMP.  After stopping

PRAC Advice 
Based  on  the  PRAC  review  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  version  1.5,  the  PRAC  considers  by 
consensus  that  the  risk  management  system  for  bedaquiline  indicated  for  use  as  part  of  an 
appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in adult 
patients  when  an  effective  treatment  regimen  cannot  otherwise  be  composed  for  reasons  of 
resistance or tolerability is acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The  main  evidence  for  the  efficacy  of  bedaquiline  in  the  treatment  of  M.  tuberculosis  infection 
derives from the C208 study, in which patients with MDR or pre-XDR TB were randomized to receive 
bedaquiline  or  placebo  as  add  on  to  a  background  regimen  including  an  injectable,  a 
fluoroquinolone, and other anti-TB drugs. In this phase IIb study, the primary endpoint was time to 
culture conversion. This was statistically significantly shorter in patients randomized to bedaquiline 
(median 83 versus 125 days for placebo). Consequently, culture conversion rates at week 24 of 
treatment were significantly higher in the bedaquiline arm (mITT: 79% vs. 58%, respectively; p = 
0.008). The inference of clinically relevant activity, increasing the efficacy of the regimen to which 
it  was  added,  is  supported  by  a  significantly  higher  cure  rate  (62.1  versus  43.9%,  p=0.035). 
Subgroup analysis showing a numerically greater increment in treatment response with bedaquiline 
in  patients  with  fewer  active  drugs  in  their  regimens  is  further  supportive  of  the  reality  of  the 
demonstrated anti-TB efficacy. Also, the proportion of patients failing therapy with bedaquiline that 
demonstrated de novo resistance to components of the treatment regimen was considerably lower 
than in the placebo group, which is further indicative of activity, and may also be clinically relevant 
in case of subsequent rescue therapy. Further complementary evidence of efficacy is provided by an 
ongoing single arm study also including patients with XDR-TB (C209). These clinical data together 
with the high antimycobacterial efficacy observed in several relevant animal models, indicate that 
bedaquiline would likely provide clinically relevant activity as part of multi-drug regimens against 
TB.  
Bedaquiline is a new active agent of a unique class, and the activity is specific for Mycobacteria. No 
relevant cross resistance is seen to other available agents. This is of major importance in a situation 
of a great need for new active therapies to improve outcomes of MDR TB therapies.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The  low  number  of  patients  hitherto  studied,  and  for  whom  outcomes  are  available,  makes 
estimates of the precise magnitude of the added effect of bedaquiline uncertain.  
Also, the optimal use of bedaquiline for the treatment of drug resistant pulmonary TB (the indication 
sought), has not yet been characterized. Animal models indicate that bedaquiline is a sterilizing 
agent that might significantly reduce the number of drugs and/or treatment duration required. An 
appropriately designed phase III study is required to further define the optimal use of this agent, 
both with regards the number and types of agents that are needed in combination, and the optimal 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 103/108 
 
  
  
 
 
 
treatment duration. The upcoming confirmatory phase III study with recruitment planned to start 
within 2014, is considered to include the adequate elements for these activities. The final protocol 
of the phase III study is still to be decided, and this may occur after an approval. 
Bedaquiline has been studied only in a small number of MDR TB patients co-infected with HIV. This 
is an important TB population. The pertinent issue relating to this population is not the efficacy of 
bedaquiline per se, but rather adequate guidance on how to safely use bedaquiline in combination 
with  certain  antiretroviral  agents  that  may  display  significant  drug-drug  interactions  with 
bedaquiline.  Due  to  the  limitations  of  the  pharmacokinetic  characterization  of  bedaquiline,  it  is 
difficult to make reliable predictions about its full potential for clinically significant DDIs (see also 
below).  
Patients with extra-pulmonary TB, including TB meningitis, have not been studied. However, the 
indication presently sought by the applicant only includes the indication pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Side effects with available second line agents, such as those included in the background regimens 
in the studies of bedaquiline, are numerous and problematic. In the placebo controlled study (with 
a  specified  background  regimen)  adverse  events  were  not  markedly  different  between  arms. 
However there was a slow increase in mean transaminase levels over time in the bedaquiline group, 
with a higher frequency of patients with increase in liver enzymes was noted in patients treated with 
bedaquiline compared to placebo.  Two patients potentially fulfilled Hy’s law. However, one case 
was  heavily  confounded  by  alcoholism,  and  in  the  other  case  a  reaction  to  recently  introduced 
protionamide (with a well-established risk for liver toxicity) was deemed the likely causative agent. 
Liver enzymes are generally monitored during TB therapy, as liver toxicity is common for a number 
of other TB agents.  
Furthermore, QTc prolongation was noted during treatment with bedaquiline, also with a slow onset 
of the effect, reaching a mean maximum of approximately 15 ms at week 18. One patient showed 
a QTc > 500 ms, and no clinical events related to QTc were reported. QTc prolongation requires 
monitoring  and  judicial  consideration  of  benefit-risk  when  combining  bedaquiline  with  other 
antimycobacterial drugs that are also significant prolongators of the QTc-interval.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In  the  phase  II  C208-study  ,  pivotal  to  this  application  for  conditional  approval,  there  was  an 
imbalance in mortality, with 12/102 patients randomized to bedaquiline, versus 4/105 randomised 
to placebo, dying during the study or during the follow-up  (10 versus 2 deaths in the “pivotal study, 
C208 stage 2). In all but one case, the patients died 3 months to >2.5 years after discontinuing 
bedaquiline  (median  329  days).  Neither  the  temporal  pattern  nor  the  distribution  of  attributed 
causes  of  deaths  within  the  relatively  small  C208  study,  are  supportive  of  a  causal  relation  to 
bedaquiline therapy. This conclusion should be verified post approval in the phase III study , where 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/45161/2014 
Page 104/108 
 
  
  
 
 
survival  will  be  followed  up  to  2  years  after  stopping  therapy,  including  in  the  patients  who 
discontinue early. 
The mortality data from study C208 highlight the fact that the safety data base for bedaquiline is 
limited; indeed, the company is applying for a conditional approval on the basis of phase 2b studies, 
where  some  300  patients  were  exposed  for  bedaquiline  for  24  weeks  of  therapy  (the  presently 
proposed treatment duration with this agent). Hence, uncommon but serious side effects may so far 
be unknown. Also, the safety profile for exposure beyond 24 weeks, which is to be studied in the 
proposed phase III trial, has not hitherto been investigated, except in a very few patients being part 
of the Early Access Program in France. 
Presently,  as  stated  above,  there  is  limited  knowledge  about  how  bedaquiline  and  M2  (major 
metabolite) are eliminated. Thus, drug-interactions resulting in increased exposure may only be 
partially predicted. The same is true for potential genetic subpopulations with increased exposure. 
There  is  no  safety  data  on  higher  doses  than  the  recommended  clinical  dose.  The  exposure  of 
metabolites in plasma has not been extensively investigated (as there is no mass-balance study). 
Thus, the relevance of the preclinical species in terms of metabolite exposure cannot be assessed, 
neither  can,  with  the  exception  of  M2,  absence  of  major  metabolites  with  target  (or  off  target) 
pharmacological activity be concluded. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Present treatment of MDR or XDR-TB is complicated, including a considerable number of drugs with 
varying tolerability and in some cases serious safety issues. Treatment durations are long, which 
yields  a  high  risk  for  patients  not  completing  therapy.  The  mortality  in  patients  with  MDR-  or 
XDR-TB is considerable and there is an urgent need of new agents, to increase efficacy, to reduce 
long  term  exposure  to  potentially  toxic  substances  and  to  shorten  therapy.  Furthermore,  drug 
resistant TB is a recognized public health hazard; in this respect also a decreased time to sputum 
culture negativity may be seen as a potentially valuable drug effect.  In phase 2 bedaquiline has 
shown convincing and relevant activity for the treatment of MDR TB. Apart from higher cure rates, 
bedaquiline also provided a shield to resistance development to the other background agents, which 
may be of considerable clinical importance. 
The  benefit  provided  by  the  availability  of  bedaquiline  for  the  treatment  of  drug-resistant 
tuberculosis are weighted against safety concerns and uncertainties, including QTc prolongation, 
potential hepatotoxicity and a higher total mortality compared to placebo in patients treated in the 
phase IIb study. There is no safety data on increased exposures and due to the lack of knowledge 
on  the  elimination  of  bedaquiline  and  formation  and  elimination  of  the  active  metabolite  M2, 
situations with increased exposure due to drug interactions may not be predicted. In summary, 
there are no safety concerns that would necessarily preclude a conditional approval, provided that 
a number of post approval measures are fulfilled.

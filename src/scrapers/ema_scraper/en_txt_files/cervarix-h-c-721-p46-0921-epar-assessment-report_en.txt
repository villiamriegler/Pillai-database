1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
The Company submits the Abridged Annex clinical study report HPV-040 PRI in accordance with 
Art.46 of Regulation No11901/2006 of the European Parliament. 
The Annex report includes additional analyses with one additional year of safety follow-up and 
effectiveness data on exploratory endpoints (abnormal cytology, CIN2/3+) and registry safety data 
with one additional follow-up year (New Onset Autoimmune Diseases [NOADs] from HILMO and 
pregnancy outcomes from the Medical Birth Registry) for the study entitled : “A phase III/IV, 
community-randomised, controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of two vaccination strategies 
using GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals’ HPV-16/18 L1 VLPAS04 vaccine in reducing the prevalence of HPV-
16/18 infection when administered intramuscularly according to a 0, 1, 6-month schedule in healthy 
female and male study participants aged 12 - 15 years.” The Annex report was submitted in February 
2017. 
The final study report for HPV-040 PRI was submitted in June 2016 as a type II variation 
EMEA/H/C/000721/0081.  
Since it is pivotal to protect the majority of adolescent females prior to sexual activities beginning , the 
first target group for national implementation of HPV vaccine programs will be early adolescents. The 
HPV-040 PRI was designed as a Community RCT to enable the evaluation of the overall impact (direct 
& indirect effectiveness) of 2 vaccination strategies. This phase III/IV multi-centre study included  3 
Arms:   
-  Arm A: vaccinating female and male adolescents (aged 12-15 years)  
-  Arm B: vaccinating female adolescents only  
-  Arm C: males and females adolescents were vaccinated with a control vaccine (HepB)  
The study was coordinated by one principal investigator in Finland.  
The MAH conclusions in the final study report on the results were: 
1.  HPV vaccine coverage among the female participants was 47.4% in Arm A, 45.3% in Arm B 
and 0% in Arm C. Among the male participants, HPV vaccine coverage was 19.5% in Arm A, 
and 0% in Arms B and C. 
2.  Effectiveness: 
The first confirmatory objective to demonstrate the overall effectiveness of GSK Biologicals’ 
HPV-16/18 vaccine against HPV-16/18 genital infection (Arm A versus Arm C) was not met. As 
a hierarchical procedure was applied to assess the confirmatory objectives and as the first 
confirmatory objective was not met, none of the confirmatory objectives were met. 
Indirect effectiveness (herd protection) against genital HPV-16/18 infection was not observed. 
High total effectiveness against genital HPV-16/18 infection was observed, consistent with 
findings in efficacy studies.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/787348/2017

Evidence of high effectiveness against oropharyngeal infection with vaccine HPV types (HPV-
16/18) and with non-vaccine HPV types (HPV-31/33/45) were observed. 
In conclusion for the CHMP about the final report, Study HPV-040 could not identify the best HPV 
vaccination strategy (gender-neutral versus girls only) in adolescents between the age of 12-15 years 
in Finland to protect against genital HPV-16/18 incident infections after 3.5 to 6.5 years post-dose 1. 
The herd effect proved to be not statistically significant in the gender-neutral HPV immunization 
scenario. 
3.  Safety: 
The safety profile of Cervarix collected from active and spontaneous reporting and Finnish 
health registry surveillance was acceptable. The results of the present final analysis show that 
no significant differences in the rates of any specific outcome were observed between the 
treatment groups. The safety profile of the HPV vaccine group was generally similar to that of 
the control HepB vaccine and in line with what is presented in the current PI.  
Safety outcomes were balanced between the treatment groups (except for local reactions). The 
safety profile in both males and females as collected from active reporting and health registry 
surveillance was acceptable. Overall, the results of active and passive safety surveillance up to 
study end confirm the results of the interim analysis and are supportive of an acceptable safety 
profile of Cervarix in adolescent girls as well as in adolescent boys 12-15 years of age. 
Following the CHMP AR of the final clinical report, the Study HPV-040 did not identify new safety 
concerns.  
In the 14,837 female and male adolescents who received Cervarix, there was no evidence suggesting a 
potential association with NOADs including autoimmune thyroiditis or GBS. During the entire follow-up 
period, 1252 pregnancies were reported without indicating abnormal frequencies of adverse pregnancy 
outcomes. Safety outcomes were balanced between the treatment groups (except for local reactions). 
Safety profile of Cervarix based on the data submitted in this LTFU HPV040 final report was acceptable. 
The Annex report, subject of this current submission, has been provided as part of a response to RSI in 
the context of the variation II - EMEA/H/C/000721/0081.  
RSI : “The analysis of pregnancy outcome according to the study arm was based on the final study 
data and will be available in the annex report. The MAH is invited to clarify when the annex report will 
be submitted to allow for full assessment of the data. Issue not resolved.” 
In this variation final assessment report, the CHMP requested the MAH to present the data from this 
Annex report in a separate, stand-alone submission, in the context of a P46 PAM, to allow sufficient 
time for assessment. A preliminary assessment of the annex data was been made in march 2017.

2.  Assessment of the post-authorisation measure PAM 
The following study endpoints were analysed in the Annex report:  
•  Secondary endpoints (registry safety data with one additional follow-up year)  
Safety data from local health registries of the 1995 cohort in 2014 were not available at the time of the 
final analysis (end of study in 2014), due to the reason that there is always a one-year gap between 
event occurrence and data uploading into registries. These data were therefore retrieved in early 2016 
and included in the additional analysis:  
o  New Onset Autoimmune Diseases (NOAD) from HILMO registry  
o  Pregnancy outcomes from the Medical Birth Registry.  
•  Tertiary endpoints  
o  Effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing cytological abnormalities associated with oncogenic 
HPV types 
o  Occurrence of CIN2+ lesions (spontaneous reporting from study subjects) 
o  Occurrence of CIN3+ lesions and invasive cervical cancer associated with oncogenic HPV 
types (from Cancer Registry) 
According to the MAH, the safety and effectiveness results obtained from the annex analysis are in line 
with the previous results as presented in the final study report of HPV-040 (submitted in 2016):  
•  Overall effectiveness of GSK Biologicals’ HPV-16/18 vaccine in reducing cytological abnormalities 
associated with HPV-16/18 types was aligned with overall effectiveness against HPV-16/18 genital 
infection.  
• 
The incidence rates of NOADs and pregnancy outcomes were generally balanced between the 
treatment groups. The safety profile in both males and females was acceptable. 
Effectiveness results: 
They were based on the results of the cervical biopsies collected from the subjects after Visit 5 at the 
local hospitals.

The majority of the subjects had normal (negative) cervical cytology (85.4% in Arm A, 86.0% in Arm 
B, 84.8% in Arm C). Cytological abnormality was diagnosed in 13.5% and 18.1 %of subjects in the 
HPV and HepB groups, respectively, in Arm A; 13.7% and 14.5% of subjects in the HPV and HepB 
groups, respectively, in Arm B; and 15.1% of subjects in the HepB group in Arm C (Table 7). 
•  Overall effectiveness of GSK Biologicals’ HPV-16/18 vaccine in reducing cytological 
abnormalities associated with HPV-16/18 types (VE Arm A versus C = 25% [95% CI: -26.1, 
55.4] and VE Arm B versus C = 46.8% [95% CI: 8.4, 69.1]) was aligned with overall 
effectiveness against HPV-16/18 genital infection reported in the Clinical Study Report 106636 
(HPV-040 PRI).  
•  Overall effectiveness of GSK Biologicals’ HPV-16/18 vaccine in reducing all cytological 
abnormalities (regardless of HPV types) in Arm A versus Arm C and Arm B versus Arm C was 
not observed.  
• 
Post-hoc analysis of overall effectiveness of GSK Biologicals’ HPV-16/18 vaccine in reducing 
cytological abnormalities associated with HPV-16/18 types in Arm A versus Arm C and Arm B 
versus Arm C, using Mantel-Haenszel adjusted for clustering and stratified by the area type 
(urban, semi-urban) was also aligned with the post-hoc analysis of overall effectiveness 
against HPV-16/18 genital infection reported in the Clinical Study Report 106636 (HPV-040 
PRI) (Table 7).  
• 
• 
Fifteen CIN2+ cases were reported (diagnosed in local hospitals): 6 cases in Arm A, 1 case in 
Arm B and 8 cases in Arm C. None of the CIN2+ cases associated with HPV-16/18 (8 cases) 
received HPV vaccine in the study (Table 5 and 6). 
Two cases of cervical carcinoma (one each in the HPV and HepB groups) were reported in the 
Cancer registry search during the study period

Assessment comment 
The study activities to characterize the female study participants were described in the study design1. 
The Applicant was asked to further investigate and describe this case as it could have been a 
breakthrough case. Unfortunately, no further data were available on this specific case.

1 Evaluation of vaccine-induced HPV antibody responses 
Blood samples were to be collected at Visit 1 (Day 0), Visit 4 (Month 7) and Visit 5 (at 18.5 years of age) in a subset of study participants (immunogenicity 
subset) to evaluate antibody responses against HPV types or Hepatitis B. 
 Effectiveness evaluation at Visit 5 for female study participants only: 
All female community residents born between 1992 and 1995 joining the effectiveness evaluation phase of the trial were to undergo pelvic examination at 
Visit 5, during which cervical Liquid-Based Cytology (LBC) samples were to be collected for HPV DNA PCR testing and cytopathological examination. In 
case of a cytology reading of ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) positive for oncogenic HPV DNA or an abnormal cytology 
reading of LSIL (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion), female study participants were to be referred to the local health care system for diagnosis 
and treatment (repeated cytological examination/HPV DNA testing orcolposcopy/endocervical curettage [ECC] referral) according to local medical practice 
and standard of care).

Assessment comment 
Increased RR is clearly confirmed for the Endocrine disorders [RR:2.61 (95%CI: 0.80;11.26)] and 
concerns the female cohort in the HPV group.  
All female participants 
Six new cases (five in the HPV group and one in the HepB group) had been reported since the previous 
registry download.

Assessment comment 
When comparing the first incidence rates discussed in the first analysis (refer to the summary of 
clinical safety of HPV-040 PRI with the current data addressed in the abridged annex report final, the 
NOADs cases in HPV group were 1 case each of Crohn, Sarcoidosis, Scleroderma, Erythema nodosum 
and psoriasis. 
Meanwhile, n=132 in the HPV group is not consistent with n=128 of the previous analysis 
and the 5 NOADs cases in the HPV group detected by the MAH. The same remark is applied 
to the n=86 data in the HepB group which should count one more NOADs case compared to 
the previous data. The MAH is invited to comment on this inconsistency.

By MedDRA Preferred Term, the incidence rates of the most common NOADs in female study 
participants (>10 per 100 000 person-years in any group) were as follows: 
•  15.0 and 5.7 cases per 100 000 person-years in the HPV and HepB groups, respectively, for 
Basedow’s disease [RR:2.61 (95%CI: 0.52;25.27)]  
•  13.1 and 8.6 cases per 100 000 person-years in the HPV and HepB groups, respectively, for

juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
•  13.1 and 20.1 cases per 100 000 person-years in the HPV and HepB groups, respectively, for 
psoriasis 
All male participants 
Five new cases (one in the HPV group and four in the HepB group) had been reported since the 
previous registry download. By MedDRA Preferred Term, the incidence rates of the most common 
NOADs in male study participants (
 1 5  p e r  1 0 0  0 0 0  p e r s o n
-years in any group) were as follows: 
•  28.2 and 41.9 cases per 100 000 person-years in the HPV and HepB groups, respectively, for 
colitis ulcerative 
•  37.6 and 44.3 cases per 100 000 person-years in the HPV and HepB groups, respectively, for 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus 
•  9.4 and 27.1 cases per 100 000 person-years in the HPV and HepB groups, respectively, for

by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and High Level Group Term, during the entire study period and estimated 
relative risks (All female study participants, Total Vaccinated cohort) 
The most common serious NOADs in female study participants (>10 per 100 000 person-years in any 
group) were as follows: 
•  20.6 and 11.5 cases per 100 000 person-years in the HPV and HepB groups, respectively, for 
serious Colitis Ulcerative [RR=1.80 (0.53-7.74)]. The IR for the serious and non-serious 
CU were 28.1 and 23.0 cases per 100 000 person-years in the HPV and HepB groups, 
respectively. 
•  11.3 and 14.4 cases per 100 000 person-years in the HPV and HepB groups, respectively, for 
serious Crohn’s disease 
•  16.9 and 23.0 cases per 100 000 person-years in the HPV and HepB groups, respectively, for 
serious Type 1 diabetes mellitus 
All male participants 
One new case in the HPV group had been reported since the previous registry download. The most 
common serious NOADs in male study participants (
 1 0  p e r  1 0 0  0 0 0  p e r s o n
-years in any group) 
were as follows: 
•  9.4 and 24.6 cases per 100 000 person-years in the HPV and HepB groups, respectively, for 
serious colitis ulcerative and serious Crohn’s disease 
•  37.6 and 41.9 cases per 100 000 person-years in the HPV and HepB groups, respectively, for 
serious Type 1 diabetes mellitus 
Assessment comment 
With regards to the safety results, the NOADs observed are consistent with the recent safety signal for 
Autoimmune Thyroiditis in female subjects. Meanwhile, the observed increased RR for Basedow’s 
disease and for Endocrine disorders in the vaccinated female subjects should be further discussed in 
the next PSUR. The results for females vaccinated for serious NOADs observed showed an increased 
RR in the HPV group for the Ulcerative colitis. In the context of the new indication of anal cancer, the 
males vaccinated showed an increased RR for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and for Psoriasis and this

should also be addressed in the next PSUR. These safety issues will be further commented in the 
assessment of Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000721/II/0085.  
Pregnancy results in all female participants 
• 
The results for pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes over the total number of pregnancies 
reported during the entire study period. The incidence of subjects with pregnancies according 
to pregnancy outcome is presented by Arm in Table 37. 
•  During the entire study, a total of 1344 pregnancies were reported (777 in the HPV group and 
567 in the HepB group). Since the previous registry download, 92 new pregnancies had 
been reported. 
• 
The majority of pregnancies resulted in elective termination with no apparent congenital 
anomaly [786 (58.5%)] or birth of a live infant with no apparent congenital anomaly [437 
(32.5%)]. The other pregnancy outcomes were spontaneous abortion with no apparent 
congenital anomaly [107 (8.0%)], ectopic pregnancy [10 (0.7%)], molar pregnancy [3 (0.2%)] 
and stillbirth with no apparent congenital anomaly [1 (0.1%)].

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Assessment comment 
With regards to the safety results, the NOADs observed are consistent with the recent safety signal for 
Autoimmune Thyroiditis in female subjects. Meanwhile, the observed increased RR for Basedow’s 
disease and for Endocrine disorders in the vaccinated female subjects should be further discussed in 
the next PSUR. The results for females vaccinated for serious NOADs observed showed an increased 
RR in the HPV group for the Ulcerative colitis. In the context of the new indication of anal cancer, the 
males vaccinated showed an increased RR for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and for Psoriasis and this 
should also be addressed in the next PSUR. These safety issues will also be further commented in the 
Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000721/II/0085. Issue resolved. 
Overall effectiveness against all cytological abnormalities (regardless of HPV types) in Arm A versus 
Arm C and Arm B versus Arm C was not observed while the overall effectiveness on specifically 
HPV16/18 cytological abnormalities (VE Arm A versus C = 25% [95% CI: -26.1, 55.4] and VE Arm B 
versus C = 46.8% [95% CI: 8.4, 69.1]) did not bring evidence for a beneficial impact of a male & 
female immunization program on reducing the burden in females after 3.5 to 6.5 years post-dose 1. 
With regards to the effectiveness data, the Applicant was asked to further investigate the case of 
adenocarcinoma after 5 years post-vaccination of a girl of 13 yoa, especially for the HPV specification 
of the lesions and the clinical outcome of the patient. This could have been a potential 
breakthrough case. Unfortunately, the MAH could not find more relevant clinical information 
on this case listed in the cancer registry.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion 
As part of their Responses to the 2nd Response to Supplementary Informations, the MAH submitted an 
‘Abridged Annex Clinical Study Report for Study 106636 HPV-040 PRI’ containing additional analysis 
with one additional year of safety follow-up data and effectiveness data regarding abnormal cytology, 
CIN2+ and CIN3+. This study was a phase III/IV, community-randomised, controlled study to evaluate 
the effectiveness of two vaccination strategies using GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals’ HPV-16/18 L1 VLP 
AS04 vaccine in reducing the prevalence of HPV-16/18 infection when administered intramuscularly 
according to a 0, 1, 6-month schedule in healthy female and male study participants aged 12 - 15 
years. It started in October 2007 and completed in December 2014. 
A preliminary assessment of the annex data was been made in march 2017.These data were asked to 
be presented as a separate, stand-alone submission, in the context of this current P46 PAM, to allow 
sufficient time for assessment.  
The Pregnancy results do not show a safety signal regarding the pregnancy outcomes. 
The MAH was requested to take the following points into consideration when submitting the annex 
report as a separate P46 PAM: 
1. With regards to the safety results, the NOADs observed are consistent with the recent safety signal 
for Autoimmune Thyroiditis in female subjects. Meanwhile, the observed increased RR for Basedow’s 
disease and for Endocrine disorders in the vaccinated female subjects should be further discussed in 
the next PSUR. The results for females vaccinated for serious NOADs observed showed an increased 
RR in the HPV group for the Ulcerative colitis. In the context of the new indication of anal cancer, the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/787348/2017

males vaccinated showed an increased RR for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and for Psoriasis and this 
should also be addressed in the next PSUR. These safety issues will also be further commented 
in the Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000721/II/0085. Issue resolved. 
2. Overall effectiveness against all cytological abnormalities (regardless of HPV types) in Arm A versus 
Arm C and Arm B versus Arm C was not observed while the overall effectiveness on specifically 
HPV16/18 cytological abnormalities (VE Arm A versus C = 25% [95% CI: -26.1, 55.4] and VE Arm B 
versus C = 46.8% [95% CI: 8.4, 69.1]) did not bring evidence for a beneficial impact of a male & 
female immunization program on reducing the burden in females after 3.5 to 6.5 years post-dose 1. 
With regards to the effectiveness data, the Applicant was asked to further investigate the case of 
adenocarcinoma after 5 years post-vaccination of a girl of 13 yoa, especially for the HPV specification 
of the lesions and the clinical outcome of the patient. This could have been a possible breakthrough 
case. Unfortunately, the MAH could not find more relevant clinical information on this case listed in the 
cancer registry. The common encountered lack of background-baseline clinical data on specific 
(‘eventually breakthrough’) cases is considered as problematic as the possibility to discover those 
cases increase with post-marketing time. The lack of evidence precludes any conclusions on those 
clinically relevant occurrence. As to address this uncertainty, the MAH is invited to discuss in the next 
PSUR on how it could better characterize breakthrough cases as part of post-marketing surveillance. 
This issue is considered as resolved. No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-
risk balance. 
Meanwhile, minor questions relative to the data inconsistencies are still to be addressed by the MAH. 
Issue not resolved. 
  PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required 
  PAM not fulfilled (not all commitments fulfilled) and further action required 
4.  List of Outstanding Issues 
Six new cases (five in the HPV group and one in the HepB group) in the female participants had been 
reported since the previous registry download.  
When comparing the first incidence rates discussed in the first analysis (refer to the summary of 
clinical safety of HPV-040 PRI with the current data addressed in the abridged annex report final, the 
NOADs cases in HPV group were 1 case each of Crohn, Sarcoidosis, Scleroderma, Erythema nodosum 
and psoriasis. 
Meanwhile, n=132 in the HPV group is not consistent with n=128 of the previous analysis and the 5 
NOADs cases in the HPV group detected by the MAH (see Table 15). The same remark is applied to the 
n=86 data in the HepB group which should count one more NOADs case compared to the previous 
data. The MAH is invited to comment on this inconsistency. Issue not resolved.

5.  Assessment of company’s response to the outstanding 
issue 
Company’s response: 
The Company verified the number of subjects with NOADs (new onset of auto-immune diseases) 
reported in the Annex Study Report HPV-040 PRI (submitted in the P46 092 procedure) compared to 
the data reported in the main Study Report (previously submitted with the variation 
EMEA/H/C/000721/II/0081). 
For all female study participants in the total vaccinated cohort: 
• In the main Study Report (Table 34): 128 subjects in HPV group and 86 subjects in HepB group 
reported at least one NOAD

• In the Annex Report (Table 15): 132 subjects in HPV group and 86 subjects in HepB group reported 
at least one NOAD.  
In the HPV vaccinated group:  
• 4 subjects who did not report NOADs in the main analysis reported a NOAD in the one additional year 
of safety follow-up, captured in the annex analysis.  
• 1 subject  who reported a NOAD in the main analysis (Preferred Term (PT)=Raynaud's phenomenon) 
also reported an additional NOAD in the annex analysis (PT=Scleroderma)  
This confirms there are 5 additional NOADs reported in the annex analysis compared to the main 
analysis. However, as a second NOAD is reported in the additional year of safety follow-up for a 
subject  for which another NOAD was already reported in the main Study Report, there are only 4 
additional subjects in the HPV vaccinated group reporting at least one NOAD (128 subjects in the main

report + 4 new subjects in the abridged annex report=132 subjects in HPV group that reported at least 
one NOAD). 
In the HepB control group: 
• One Subject, who did not report any NOADs in the main analysis, reported a NOAD in the annex 
analysis 
• One other Subject reported an adverse event (PT= Encephalitis) which was classified as a NOAD in 
the main analysis. The list of terms considered as potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMD) are 
based on MedDRA PTs and as such is subject to change based on MedDRA version updates. There was 
an update to the MedDRA version (Nov 2015) between the main analysis and the annex analysis for 
study HPV-040 PRI, which led to the removal of the PT ‘encephalitis’ from the list of pIMDs. The 
targeted pIMD is now acute disseminated encephalomyelitis/demyelination (including site specific 
variants). Consequently, for any subsequent analyses following this MedDRA update, ‘encephalitis’ was 
no longer considered to be a pIMD.  
This confirms one new case of NOAD as compared to the main analysis. However, the total number of 
subjects in the control group reporting at least one NOADs remained unchanged (86 +1 subject - 1 
subject = 86 subjects). 
We can thus confirm that six new cases of NOADs (five in the HPV group and one in the HepB group) 
had been reported since the previous registry download and that the number of subjects in table 15 of 
the Annex report are correct. 
Rapporteur’s Assessment of the Company’s response: 
The minor question relative to the data inconsistencies has been correctly addressed by the MAH. 
Issue is considered resolved. 
6.  Final overall conclusion 
  PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required

Introduction 
On  22  November  2011,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Sprycel,  in  accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the follow up measure 035. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Sprycel and 
that no consequential regulatory action is required. 
Scientific discussion 
Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that CA180018 is a phase 1 study conducted to investigate dasatinib given once daily 
for  treatment  of  leukaemia  in  1-  21  year  old  subjects.  A  paediatric  formulation  is  being  developed  in 
another study (Study CA180352) for use in future phase II trials.  
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The CA180018 study conducted in pediatric subjects, used tablet formulations of dasatinib (5, 20, and 
50  mg).  If  necessary  to  permit  administration  in  subjects  who  could  not  swallow,  tablets  were 
dispersed into 30 cc of 100% fruit juice with no preservatives. A new pediatric formulation of dasatinib 
powder for oral suspension is currently being tested in CA180352 for use in future Phase 2 trials. 
Clinical aspects 
1. 
Introduction 
SPRYCEL (dasatinib) is approved in 69 countries, including the United States and European Union, for 
the  treatment  of  adult  subjects  with  chronic  myeloid  leukemia  (CML)  or  Philadelphia  chromosome 
positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. For the 
treatment of adult subjects with newly diagnosed chronic phase (CP)-CML,  SPRYCEL was approved in 
the US (28-Oct-2010) and in the EU (6-Dec-2010). Marketing authorization approval for the indication 
of adult subjects with newly diagnosed CP-CML is currently under review in several other countries. 
The  MAH  submitted  a  final  report  for  study  CA180018,  a  Phase  1  study  conducted  to  investigate 
dasatinib given once daily (QD) for the treatment of leukemia in 1 to 21-year-old subjects.

Clinical study 
Study  CA180018:  Phase  1  Study  of  SRC/ABL  Tyrosine  Kinase  Inhibitor  Dasatinib  (BMS-354825)  in 
Children and Adolescents with Relapsed or Refractory Leukemia, Protocol ITCC 005 
Description: 
The  primary  objective  of  this  Phase  1,  dose-finding  study  was  to  establish  a  recommended  Phase  2 
dose  of  dasatinib  in  children  and  adolescents  with  relapsed  or  refractory  leukemia.  In  the  absence  of 
an MTD utilizing the pre-specified dose levels, efficacy, safety and PK data were reviewed to determine 
the  recommended  Phase  2  dasatinib  dose.  The  recommended  Phase  2  dose  is  60 mg/m2  QD  for 
pediatric  subjects  with  CP-CML  (Stratum  1)  and  80 mg/m2 QD  for  pediatric  subjects  with  Ph+  ALL  or 
AP/BP-CML  (Stratum  2/3).  Due  to  the  lack  of  efficacy,  there  is  no  plan  to  move  forward  with  the 
development of dasatinib therapy for the Ph- leukemias in Phase 2 (Stratum 4).

Methods 
  Objectives 
Primary Objective:  
To establish, by stratum using a dose-finding design, a recommended Phase 2 dose of dasatinib (BMS-
354825) in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory leukemia. 
Secondary Objectives: 
1)  To  determine  the  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  identify  any  dose-limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  of 
dasatinib  in  children  and  adolescents  with  chronic  myeloid  leukemia  (CML)  in  chronic  phase  (CP) 
(Ph+;Stratum 1) or advanced leukemias (Strata 2/3 and 4 aggregated) 
2)  To  estimate,  by  stratum,  the  rates  of  morphologic  (major  hematologic  response  [MaHR]), 
cytogenetic  (major  cytogenetic  response  [MCyR];  Strata  1  and  2/3  only),  and  molecular 
(quantitative  polymerase  chain  reaction  [qPCR];  subjects  with MCyR  only, Strata  1  and  2/3  only) 
responses to dasatinib 
3)  To  describe,  by  stratum,  time  to  response,  response  duration,  progression-free  survival  (PFS), 
and survival of children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory leukemia treated with dasatinib 
4) To estimate, as a function of dasatinib dose, plasma and (if applicable) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of dasatinib  
5) To describe the spectrum of mutations in the BCR-ABL gene (Strata 1 and 2/3) and in the FLT3 
and  KIT  genes  (Stratum  4)  at  baseline  and  at  end  of  treatment  and  to  explore  the  role  of 
mutations as predictors of response. 
In  addition,  protocol  Amendment  5  (approved  08-Dec-2009)  and  United  Kingdom  country-specific 
Amendment  06  (dated  05-May-2010)  added  laboratory  and  radiographic  assessments  to  monitor 
growth and development and bone mineral metabolism to be performed annually for up to 5 years of 
follow-up after completion of study drug. 
  Study design 
CA180018 is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation (3+3 design, intra-subject dose escalation) study 
in  which  eligible  subjects  were  treated  with  dasatinib  orally  QD  until  refractory  disease  progression, 
intolerable toxicity, or patient/physician preference. Dasatinib could be continued for as long as clinical 
benefit was maintained.  
The  target  population  included  children  and  adolescents,  ≥  1  to  <  21  years  of  age,  with  Ph+  CML  in 
chronic,  accelerated,  or  blast  phase  (BP)  resistant  or  intolerant  to  imatinib,  or  in  first  or  subsequent 
relapse of Ph+ ALL after prior imatinib, or in second or subsequent relapse of Ph- ALL or AML. 
  Study population /Sample size 
In  CA180018,  58  subjects  were  treated  with  dasatinib  and  were  evaluable  for  the  primary  endpoint 
(selection of the Phase 2 dose): 
  17 in Stratum 1: all Ph+ CP-CML

The mean age of the entire study population was 10 years. Fifty-seven of the 58 treated subjects were 
1 to 18 years of age. This includes 34 subjects 1 to < 12 years and 23 subjects 12 to < 18 years. One 
subject with Ph- AML was 21 years and 1 month at baseline. Roughly two-thirds of the subjects in each 
stratum were male and 90% were white. A summary of dosing is provided in Table 4.2.

Treatment  courses  were  defined  as  3  weeks  (21  days  plus  any  required  delay);  for  subjects  who 
stayed  on  treatment  >  12  months,  courses  after  12 months  were  defined  in  quartiles  of  13  weeks. 
Subjects were to be followed until death or up to 5 years after end-of-treatment.  Dasatinib dose levels 
are provided in Table 4.1.

150  mg/m2  QD  was  planned  to  be  used  for  dose  escalation;  however,  no  subject  had  a 
dose escalation to 150 mg/m2. 
The  starting  dose  level  for  all  strata  was  60 mg/m2  QD.  Each  stratum  was  escalated  independently, 
following a standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme. Intra-subject dose escalation was allowed based on 
tolerance and on individual response. This design ensured maximal therapeutic benefit for children and

adolescents  with  Ph+  disease,  without  a  requirement  to  escalate  to  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD) 
and incur toxicity.  
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy:  Efficacy  variables  included  hematologic,  cytogenetic,  and  molecular  responses  to  dasatinib. 
Time  to  response,  response  duration,  progression-free  survival  (PFS),  and  overall  survival  with 
relapsed or refractory leukemia treated with dasatinib were also measured. Mutations in the BCR-ABL 
(for  subjects  with  Ph+  leukemias  in  Strata  1  and  2/3)  and  mutations  in  FLT3  and  KIT  genes  (for 
subjects with Ph - leukemias in Stratum 4) were studied. 
Safety: AEs, drug-related AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs of 
special  interest,  laboratory  measurements,  electrocardiograms  (ECG),  echocardiograms,  and  deaths 
were  summarized.  Investigator  reported  AE  terms  were  coded  and  grouped  by  system  organ  class 
(SOC)  using  the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Affairs  (MedDRA)  dictionary  Version  14.  AEs  and 
other symptoms were graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 3.0. Specific measures for long-term 
follow-up of growth and development were added in protocol Amendment 5 (08-Dec-2009). 
Pharmacokinetics: PK variables included: maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), time of 
maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax), area under the concentration-time curve from time 
zero  to  the  time  of  the  last  quantifiable  concentration  (AUC[0-T]),  area  under  the  plasma  
concentration-time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinite time (AUC[INF]), terminal elimination 
half-life (T-HALF), dose normalized (DN) Cmax, DN AUC(0-T), and DN AUC(INF). 
  Statistical Methods 
The  sample  size  was  not  based  on  statistical  power  to  detect  a  specific  response  rate  but  on  the 
feasibility of accrual and on the dose levels used for the escalations of the starting dose. 
In Stratum 1 and in Stratum 2/3, at least 12 subjects in each stratum were to be treated to meet the 
primary objective (6 subjects at the 60 mg/m2 starting dose; and 6 subjects at the 80 mg/m2 starting 
dose, unless there was excessive toxicity at either dose, or no clinical need to escalate to 80 mg/m2). 
Up to additional 4 subjects were to be treated at the 60 mg/m2 dose level in Stratum 1 and at the 80 
mg/m2 level in Stratum 2/3 to expand the number of subjects at the dose level selected for the Phase 
2 study. 
In Stratum 4, a maximum of 6 subjects were to be accrued per dose level; the highest starting dose 
was to be 120 mg/m2. 
Dose escalation was based on the tolerability at a given dose level and the clinical efficacy at a given 
dose.  The  recommended  Phase  2  dose  was  determined  based  on  the  aggregation  of  safety  data  for 
these strata, and an assessment of safety at a minimum of 2 dose levels was planned. 
Best on-study hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular response rates including key efficacy endpoints 
were  estimated  using  all  treated  subjects  by  stratum  and  by  dose  cohort.  Ninety-five  percent  exact 
confidence intervals (CIs) using the method of Clopper and Pearson were provided for rates computed 
on the recommended Phase 2 dose. 
Kaplan-Meier  plots  for  PFS,  overall  survival  (OS),  duration  and  time  to  response  by  stratum  were 
planned  and  provided.  A  2-sided,  95%  CI  for  the  median  was  computed  using  the  method  of 
Brookmeyer and Crowley.

  No hematologic responses were reported in subjects from Stratum 4. 
  Last MCyR was achieved by Week 26 in Stratum 1 and by Week 15 in the Stratum 2/3. 
  The MCyR and CCyR rates exclude subject (CA180018-10-10006) in the 80 mg/m2 dose cohort, who did not have 
a CCyR. This subject was counted as having a CCyR due to a data entry error that was fixed after database lock 
for this CSR.

Assessors comment 
It  can  be  agreed  that  the  data  support  60  mg/m2  QD  for  paediatric  subjects  with  CP-CML  and  80 
mg/m2  QD  for  paediatric  subjects  with  Ph+  ALL  or  AP/BP-CML  as  the  recommended  Phase  2  dose 
(table  above)  as  clinical  activity  in  paediatric  subjects  with  Ph+  leukemias  with  resistance  or 
intolerance to prior imatinib was shown. Response rates in children with CP-CML at 60 mg/m2 QD and 
in children with AP-CML and Ph+ ALL at 80 mg/m2 QD was favourable. 
The data also showed that no responses were observed in paediatric subjects with treatment-refractory 
Ph–ALL or AML (Stratum 4) despite escalations to the highest dose in this trial of 120 mg/m2.

  Safety results 
Two  subjects  (both  in  Stratum  4)  with  other  co-morbidities,  had  dose-limiting  toxicities.  One  subject 
developed  Grade  4  anaphylaxis  5 hours  after  the  first  dose  of  study  drug  (60 mg/m2)  and  the  event 
resolved the same day. This resulted in discontinuation of dasatinib therapy and discontinuation from 
study. The other subject (120 mg/m2 dose cohort), who had a platelet count of 16 x 109/L developed 
an upper GI hemorrhage (Grade 3) on Day 6 that resolved on Day 11 of the study. This event led to 
interruption of dasatinib dosing. A maximum tolerated dose was not established for any strata on this 
study.  
Rates of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and discontinuation from Therapy 
A total of 38 subjects died: 3 (18%), 12 (71%), and 23 (96%) in Strata 1, 2/3, and 4, respectively; 
however, none of the deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to study therapy. Most 
were related to disease progression and infections. 
Page 9/12
 
 
 
 
  
 
Drug-related  SAEs  were  reported  in  12%,  29%  and  33%  of  subjects  in  Strata  1,  2/3,  and 4, 
respectively.  With  the  exception  of  thrombocytopenia,  which  was  reported  in  2 subjects  (12%)  in 
Stratum 2/3, all other drug-related SAEs were reported by 1 subject each per stratum. 
There  were  no  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  dasatinib  reported  in  Strata 1  and  2/3. 
Two  (8%)  subjects  in  Stratum  4  had  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  dasatinib.  One 
subject (previously mentioned in Section 5) in the 60 mg/m2 dose cohort (with a history of allergies) 
had Grade 4 anaphylaxis 5 hours after the first dose of dasatinib (60 mg/m2). The other subject in the 
100 mg/m2 dose cohort (with no reported medical history of allergies) had an SAE of urticaria (Grade 
2).  
Drug-related non-hematologic AEs reported  by  10% of subjects in any treatment group include the 
following: headache, nausea, diarrhea, rash, pain in extremity, mouth ulceration, vomiting, arthralgia, 
back pain, fatigue, malaise, peripheral edema, pyrexia, pruritus, and urticaria in Stratum 1, diarrhea, 
nausea,  vomiting,  rash,  headache,  fatigue,  and  epistaxis  in  Stratum  2/3,  and  nausea,  vomiting, 
headache, and arthralgia in Stratum 4.  
Laboratory Assessments, Vital Signs, ECGs 
Most  subjects  had  some  degree  of  cytopenia  on  study;  however,  no  subject  had 
cytopenia/myelosuppression that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug. No other laboratory 
abnormalities led to discontinuation of dasatinib therapy. 
ECG results were similar among the strata; most subjects had a decline in QTc(F) from baseline in the 
-60  to  0  msec  range  (median  7.5  msec  for  the  overall  population).  No  subject  had  a  QTc  (F) 
> 500 msec.  Abnormal  echocardiogram  results  were  reported  for  1 subject  with  a  normal  result  at 
baseline;  this  subject  had  no  associated  cardiac  AEs  associated  with  the  abnormal  results  and 
subsequently had normal echocardiogram results. Two subjects with abnormal echocardiogram results 
at  baseline  also  had  abnormal  results  on  study.  There  were  no  discontinuations  of  dasatinib  therapy 
because of abnormal ECG or echocardiogram results. 
Adverse Events and Laboratory Measurements of Special Interest 
Adverse  events  (AEs)  of  special  interest  in  the  dasatinib  program  were  examined  either  because  of 
their  association  with  dasatinib  in  the  currently  approved  indications,  because  they  are  recognized 
events  in  other  agents  within  this  drug  class,  or  because  safety  data  from  nonclinical  and  clinical 
studies  warranted  careful  evaluation. AEs  of  special interest  include  fluid  retention,  cardiac  disorders, 
diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, rash, bleeding events, hypersensitivity, and hearing loss.  
Drug-related  severe  (Grade  3,  none  were  Grade  4)  AEs  of  special  interest,  were  uncommon, 
manageable,  and  generally  did  not  lead  to  discontinuation  of  dasatinib.  In  this  study,  7  subjects  had 
drug-related Grade 3 AEs of special interest; this includes  
  Stratum 2/3:  
o  bleeding event (n = 1), Grade 3 epistaxis on Day 57 that resolved in 2 days. The subject was 
thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 20 x 109 c/L on Day 58. 
  6 subjects in Stratum 4:  
rash (n = 2) 
o 
o  bleeding event (n = 1), Grade 3 upper GI hemorrhage on Day 6 that resolved on Day 12. A 
platelet count was not available on Day 6; the platelet count on Day 8 was 52 x 109 c/L. This 
subject also had Grade 3 drug-related nausea.  
o  pleural effusion (n = 1) 
o  vomiting (n = 1) 
o  hypocalcemia (n = 1)

Importantly,  no  pediatric  subjects  experienced  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  during  this  trial, 
including none of the 13 subjects treated for more than one year with dasatinib. 
Tests  to  monitor  growth  and  development  and  bone  metabolism  were  added  to  the  study  as 
mandatory  protocol  procedures;  however,  at  the  time  these  tests  were  added,  only  18 of  the 
58 subjects were either on treatment or in follow-up. Because of the limited amount of data available 
at  the  time  of  database  lock  for  the  CA180018  clinical  study  report  and  the  limited  follow-up,  no 
definitive  conclusions  can  made  on  the  effect  of  dasatinib  therapy  on  growth  in  pediatric  subjects, 
however,  preliminary  data  do  not  demonstrate  a  negative  impact  on  growth  and  bone  mineral 
metabolism. In CA180018, data for long-term growth assessment continues to be collected. 
Assessors comment 
The data presented showed a safety profile that was manageable in pediatric subjects with leukemia. 
No unexpected adverse events were observed.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Plasma  PK  data  were  available  for  53  subjects.  Each  subject  could  have  1,  2  or  3  plasma  PK  profiles 
sampled,  depending  on  the  number  of  times  the  dose  of  dasatinib  was  escalated.  CSF  PK  data  were 
available for 9 subjects. 
Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Dasatinib in Plasma - Effect of Age and Dasatinib Dose 
Dasatinib was rapidly absorbed in pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory leukemia. Mean Tmax 
was observed between 0.5 and 6 hours. Mean T-HALF ranged from 2 to 5 hours across all dose levels 
and age groups. High inter-subject variability was observed in the PK parameters of pediatric subjects. 
The geometric means of dose-normalized (DN) dasatinib Cmax, AUC(0-T), and AUC(INF) appeared to 
be  similar  between  children  and  adolescents.  At  both  the  100  and  120  mg/m2  dose  levels,  PK 
parameters  were  available  from  one  subject  in  the  infants  and  toddler  age  group.  It  is  difficult  to 
compare the PK of dasatinib in the infant and toddler age group with children and adolescents due to 
insufficient sample size in the infant and toddler age group. 
In  post  hoc  analyses,  the  geometric  means  of  dose-normalized  dasatinib  Cmax,  AUC(0-T)  and 
AUC(INF)  appeared  not  to  be  statistically  different  between  children  and  adolescents  at  the  different 
dose levels.  
Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Dasatinib by Formulation 
There  were  two  dosage  forms  administered  to  subjects  in  this  study:  tablets  and  dispersed  tablets. 
Subjects received their dasatinib dose as tablets (supplied as 5, 20, and 50 mg strengths) if they were 
able  to  swallow  tablets.  To  permit  administration  in  young  children  who  were  unable  to  swallow 
tablets, the dasatinib tablets were dispersed into 30 mL lemonade or orange juice or apple juice prior 
to  dose  administration.  The  overall  median  Tmax  was  0.5  hour  shorter  for  the  dispersed  tablet 
compared  with  the  tablet  formulation.  PK  parameters  were  available  from  only  one  adolescent  who 
received the dispersed tablet; hence dasatinib exposure from the two dosage forms was compared in 
children group only. In a post-hoc statistical analysis comparing the exposure of dasatinib in children 
given tablets or dispersed tablets, no evidence of a difference between formulations could be seen in 
the children group. However, the relatively wide confidence intervals of the slope for the power models 
were obtained for all PK parameters. 
Pharmacokinetic Results in Cerebral Spinal Fluid 
The mean 4 hour post-dose CSF concentration of dasatinib in children and adolescents ranged from 1.0 
to 3.8 ng/mL, whereas the mean dasatinib plasma concentrations at the same time point ranged from

38  to  88  ng/mL  in  the  same  groups  of  subjects.  Hence,  in  pediatric  subjects,  the  concentrations  of 
dasatinib  in  CSF  at  4  hours  post-dose  are  1%  -  5%  of  the  concentration  in  plasma.    Of  the  32  CSF 
samples analyzed from 9 subjects, 21 samples had measurable concentrations of dasatinib, none had 
detectable  concentrations  of  BMS-582691,  and  2  samples  had  detectable  concentrations  of  BMS-
606181.  
Assessors comment 
The pharmacokinetic data submitted showed that dasatinib was rapidly absorbed in paediatric subjects 
with  relapsed  or  refractory  leukemia  and  that  administration  of  dasatinib  resulted  in  systemic 
exposures in terms of Cmax, AUC(0-T), and AUC(INF) that were consistent with dose proportionality in 
the  dose  range  of  60  to  120  mg/m2.  Also,  the  median  Tmax  was  slightly  shorter  for  the  dispersed 
tablet compared with the tablet formulation. No statistical difference in Cmax, AUC(0-T), and AUC(INF) 
was observed between the tablet and the dispersed tablet. 
Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Data for efficacy, safety and PK testing dasatinib 60 and 80 mg/m2 QD in a paediatric population with 
Ph+  leukemias  showed  a  favorable  benefit  risk  profile.  But  additional  studies  will  be  conducted  to 
further support a once daily dosing in pediatric Ph+ CML and ALL. 
It can be agreed that based on the data submitted the recommended dasatinib dose for future Phase 2 
studies in paediatric subjects with Ph+ leukemias will be 60 mg/m2 QD for subjects with CP-CML and 
80 mg/m2 QD for subjects with Ph+ ALL or AP/BP-CML.

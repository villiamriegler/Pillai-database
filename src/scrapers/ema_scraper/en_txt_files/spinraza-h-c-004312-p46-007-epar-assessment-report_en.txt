1.  Introduction 
On  14  February  2018,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Patients  with  Infantile-
Onset  Spinal  Muscular  Atrophy,  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as 
amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  ISIS  396443-CS3A:  A  Study  to  Assess  the  Efficacy,  Safety,  Tolerability,  and 
Pharmacokinetics  of  Multiple  Doses  of  Nusinersen  (ISIS  396443)  Delivered  Intrathecally  to  Patients 
with Infantile-Onset Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The  drug  was  administered  in  two  configurations,  a  2-Vial  configuration  and  a  Ready  to  Use  (RTU)  1 
vial configuration. Bioequivalence studies were not  conducted because the administered drug product 
for both the 2-vial configuration (used in early clinical studies) and the RTU configuration (used in the 
most recent clinical studies and intended for commercial use) is nearly identical. [JL1] 
Throughout the clinical study, two types of formulation configurations were used: a 2-Vial configuration 
and  a  Ready  to  Use  (RTU)  1  vial  configuration.  Minor  differences  in  the  amounts  of  the  ingredients 
existed,  but  overall,  the  two  formulations  can  be  considered  as  similar.  This  RTU  formulation  is  the 
same as that which is currently approved in the European Union MAA. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
ISIS 396443-CS3A: A Study to Assess the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics 
of  Multiple  Doses  of  Nusinersen  (ISIS  396443)  Delivered  Intrathecally  to  Patients  with 
Infantile-Onset Spinal Muscular Atrophy 
This was a Phase 2, open-label study of ISIS 396443 conducted at 3 centres in the United States and 1 
center  in  Canada.  As  the  first  study  of  nusinersen  for  treatment  of  infantile-onset  spinal  muscular 
atrophy  (SMA),  it  was  originally  designed  as  a  pilot  study  to  evaluate  the  clinical  efficacy,  safety, 
tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple doses of nusinersen administered as intrathecal (IT) 
injections by lumbar puncture (LP) to subjects with infantile-onset SMA. The first study subject started 
treatment  in  May  2013.  As  study  subjects  continued  to  exhibit  increased  survival  duration, 
achievement of new motor milestones, and improvement in muscle function, the study was amended 
to  increase  the  number  of  subjects  and  formally  capture  efficacy  endpoints  as  well  as  extend  the 
duration  of  treatment  and  observation.  An  interim  analysis  based  on  study  data  as  of  January  2016

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

showed  that  the  majority  of  subjects  had  clinically  significant  improvements  in  motor  function  and 
electrophysiological activity and that survival exceeded what would be expected based on the natural 
history  of  the  disease.  The  clinical  study  report  (CSR)  for  this  interim  analysis  was  submitted  to  the 
European Medicines Agency within the marketing authorisation application (MAA) on 07 October 2016 
(ISIS 396443-CS3A Interim CSR). The final CSR, completed in December 2017, confirmed the interim 
results  and  showed  consistent  and  sustained  improvements  in  the  achievement  of  motor  milestones 
and  other  measures  of  motor  function  and  electrophysiological  activity,  as  well  as  prolongation  of 
survival and event free survival, all in clear contrast to the natural history of Type I SMA. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
ISIS  396443-CS3A:  A  Study  to  Assess  the  Efficacy,  Safety,  Tolerability,  and  Pharmacokinetics  of 
Multiple  Doses  of  Nusinersen  (ISIS  396443)  Delivered  Intrathecally  to  Patients  with  Infantile-Onset 
Spinal Muscular Atrophy 
Description 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of multiple 
doses of nusinersen administered IT to subjects with infantile-onset SMA. 
The primary objective was to examine the clinical efficacy of multiple doses of nusinersen administered 
IT to subjects with infantile-onset SMA. 
The secondary objectives were to examine the safety and tolerability and to analyze the cerebrospinal 
fluid  (CSF)  and  plasma  PK  of  multiple  doses  of  nusinersen  administered  IT  to  subjects  with  infantile-
onset SMA. 
Study design 
Study CS3A was a Phase 2, open-label study of nusinersen conducted at 3 centres in the United States 
and 1 centre in Canada. 
The  study  consisted  of  a  Screening  Period,  a  Treatment  Period  (including  loading  and  maintenance 
dosing),  and  a  Post-Treatment  Follow-Up  Period.  The  total  duration  of  participation  in  the  study  was 
approximately  3.7  years.  Subjects  were  enrolled  sequentially  into  the  6-mg  loading  dose  cohort 
(Cohort  1)  and  the  12-mg  loading  dose  cohort  (Cohort  2).    The  treatment  period  included  a  loading 
phase and a maintenance phase. 
Study population /Sample size 
Twenty-one  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  study,  and  20  subjects  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study 
treatment and were included in the efficacy, safety, and PK analyses. 
The  study  population  was  composed  of  subjects  with  infantile-onset  SMA  (onset  of  symptoms  at  ≥21 
days to ≤6 months of age). The clinical phenotype of infantile-onset SMA is generally equivalent to that 
of  Type  I  SMA;  therefore,  the  subjects  enrolled  in  this  study  were  expected  to  have  a  severe  and

rapidly  progressive  disease  with  permanent  ventilatory  support  or  death  from  respiratory  failure 
occurring during infancy. 
Treatments 
Subjects who met the eligibility criteria were admitted to the study center on Study Day 1, underwent 
pre-dose  evaluations,  and  then  received  an  LP  injection  of  study  treatment  (ISIS  396443).  Following 
the LP injection of study treatment on Study Day 1, subjects remained at the study center for at least 
24 hours for safety monitoring. Subjects were to return to the study center on Study Days 15, 85, 253, 
379, 505, 631, 757, 883, 1009, 1135, and 1261 for follow-up evaluations and subsequent injections. 
Following  LP  injections  on  these  dosing  days,  subjects  were  monitored  for  at  least  6  hours  post 
injection before leaving the study center. A CSF sample was taken pre-dose on each injection day for 
safety and PK analyses. 
During  the  treatment  period,  the  study  center  was  to  monitor  the  subject’s  condition  through  safety 
monitoring  visits on  Study  Days  16,  29,  86,  92,  169,  254,  337,  442,  568,  694,  820,  946,  1072,  and 
1198  and  by  telephone  contact  approximately  every  3  weeks,  except  for  the  weeks  when  dosing  or 
safety  monitoring  visits  had  occurred.  Telephone  contacts  were  also  made  the  day  after  dose 
administration. 
The drug product lot numbers of ISIS 396443 that were used in this study were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
ISIS  396443  Injection  20  mg/mL,  2.5  mL;  6  or  12  mg  IT;  multiple  injections.  One  lot  was 
used: CP396443-001. 
Artificial CSF Diluent for Injection, 20 mL Exact Fill. One lot was used: CPPLAC-014. 
ISIS 396443 Injection 2.4 mg/mL, 5.0 mL Ready-To-Use vials. One lot was used: CP396443-
005. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics: 
Non-compartmental  PK  analysis  of  ISIS  396443  were  carried  out  on  individual  subject  data,  and 
plasma  PK parameters for each subject (when applicable) were determined. Plasma PK parameters (if 
applicable) were summarized using descriptive statistics.  
ISIS 396443 CSF concentration versus time (actual) profiles from Day 1 to Day 673, for each subject, 
as  well  as  the  mean  (±SE)  CSF  concentration  versus  time  (scheduled)  profiles  for  each  treatment 
cohort, are presented graphically. 
All  subjects  enrolled  in  this  study  were  to  receive  an  IT  bolus  (over  1  to  3  minutes)  of  nusinersen 
through an LP injection for a total of 12 injections, starting on Day 1 and ending on Day 1261. During 
the loading phase (dosing on Days 1, 15, and 85), 2 dose levels (adjusted based on subject age and 
CSF volume to be equivalent to either a 6-mg or 12-mg dose for subjects aged 24 months or younger) 
were evaluated sequentially.  The initial dose level of 6 mg was studied in a cohort of 4 subjects, and 
the  12-mg  dose  level  was  studied  in  approximately  16  subjects.  Following  the  loading  phase,  all 
subjects were to receive maintenance dosing with nusinersen 12 mg on Days 253, 379, 505, 631, 757, 
883, 1009, 1135, and 1261.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved improvement in motor milestones 
as evaluated by Section 2 of the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
• 
• 
• 
Event-free  survival  determined  by  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  were  alive  and  did  not 
require  permanent  ventilatory  support  (defined  as  tracheostomy  or  the  need  for  ≥16  hours 
ventilation/day continuously for at least 2 weeks in the absence of an acute reversible illness) 
Improvement  in  motor  function  as  measured  by  the  Children’s  Hospital  of  Philadelphia  Infant 
Test for Neuromuscular Disease (CHOP INTEND) 
Improvement  in  neuromuscular  electrophysiology  measured  by  the  compound  muscle  action 
potential (CMAP) of the ulnar and peroneal nerves 
Statistical Methods 
Pharmacokinetics: 
In general, descriptive summary statistics has been used to summarize data; results are presented by 
cohort and for both cohorts combined. 
Clinical Efficacy / safety: 
The  primary  analysis  assessed  the  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  Safety  Population  who  achieved 
improvement  in  motor  milestones  as  of  their  last  available  visit.  Improvement  was  defined  as  any  of 
the following: 
1.  An increase from baseline of 2 milestones or more, or the achievement of pincer grasp in the 
voluntary grasp category 
2.  An  increase  from  baseline  of  2  milestones  or  more,  or  achievement  of  touching  toes  in  the 
ability to kick category  
3.  An increase from baseline of 1 milestone or more in any of the remaining 6 categories:  head 
control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, or walking.    
Secondary efficacy analyses assessed event-free survival, CHOP-INTEND Infant Motor Function Scale, 
and  CMAP  of  ulnar  and  peroneal  nerves.  Event-free  survival  was  estimated  using  Kaplan-Meier 
methodology.

AE = adverse event; SAE = serious adverse event; a Two subjects completed the study. Subjects were 
recruited at 4 sites in the USA and Canada, with Site 1833 recruiting 9 subjects and the 3 remaining 
sites recruiting 3 or 4 subjects each (Table 36). 
Twenty-three subjects were screened, of whom 21 subjects were enrolled. Of the 2 subjects who failed 
screening,  1  subject  was  considered  too  fragile  to  participate  due  to  respiratory  difficulties 
(Investigator  decision)  and  1  was  found  to  have  cardiac  anomalies  that  violated  inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. 
Of  the  21  subjects  enrolled,  1  was  withdrawn  from  the  study  due  to  respiratory  failure  prior  to 
receiving the first dose of study treatment. Of the 20 subjects who received study treatment, 4 were 
enrolled  in  Cohort  1  and  16  were  enrolled  in  Cohort  2.  These  20  subjects  comprise  the  Safety 
Population. Of the 20 subjects in the Safety Population, 4 subjects (100%) in Cohort 1, and 15 of 16 
subjects  (93.8%)  in  Cohort  2  received  their  3  loading  doses.  One  subject  in  Cohort  2  died  due  to  a 
metapneumovirus infection prior to receiving all loading doses. 
Of the 20 subjects in the Safety Population: 
• 
• 
1  subject  in  Cohort  1  voluntarily  withdrew  from  the  study  after  receiving  4  doses  of  study 
treatment. The subject’s mother did not give a reason for withdrawal. 
1  subject  in  Cohort  1  withdrew  from  the  study  during  the  post-treatment  observation  period 
due  to  a  fatal  SAE  that  occurred  on  Day  263  (see  Section  12.2.1  for  additional  information 
about the death).

4 subjects in Cohort 2 discontinued study treatment and withdrew from the study due to fatal 
SAEs,  and  1  subject  in  Cohort  2  voluntarily  withdrew.  The  subject’s  mother  did  not  give  a 
reason for withdrawal. 
11 subjects (all in Cohort 2; 11 of 16 [68.8%]) terminated study treatment due to early study 
closure. 
Of  the  5  subjects  who  died,  4  were  receiving  study  treatment  and  were  considered  to  have 
discontinued study treatment at the time of death and withdrawn from the study due to the SAEs that 
led  to  their  deaths,  and  1  had  completed  study  treatment  under  a  previous  version  of  the  protocol 
(Protocol Amendment 2) and was considered to have withdrawn from the study due to the SAEs that 
led to his death. There were no other discontinuations or withdrawals due to AEs. 
Baseline data 
Given  that  this  was  a  multiple-dose  study  in  which  subjects  were  enrolled  sequentially  into  2  dose 
cohorts, that no randomization was involved, and that the number of subjects in each cohort was small 
and  the  cohorts  were  of  different  size,  some  imbalance  in  the  dose  cohorts  with  respect  to 
demographic and baseline disease characteristics was to be expected. 
Overall, 12 subjects (60%) were male, and 16 subjects (80%) were White. Age at enrollment ranged 
from 36 to 210 days (median: 155 days). Weight ranged from 5.07 to 9.25 kg (median: 6.58 kg), with 
the median weight for age at the 37th percentile. 
Age  at  onset  of  SMA  symptoms  ranged  from  21  to  154  days  (median:  56  days),  with  16  subjects 
having  symptom  onset  at  ≤12  weeks  of  age.  Time  between  symptom  onset  and  enrollment  ranged 
from 15 to 151 days (median: 75 days). Age at diagnosis of SMA ranged from 0 to 154 days (median: 
81 days). The subject diagnosed at age of 0 day was diagnosed in utero. Time between diagnosis and 
enrollment  ranged  from  4  to  165  days  (median:  64  days).  Overall,  17  of  20  subjects  (85%)  were 
documented  to  have  2  copies  of  the  SMN2  gene:  all  4  subjects  in  Cohort  1  and  13  of  16  subjects 
(81%) in Cohort 2. In Cohort 2, 2 subjects (13%) had 3 copies of the SMN2 gene; for 1 subject (6%), 
the SMN2 gene evaluation was unavailable because the subject died before the test was performed. A 
total of 4 subjects (20%) had received gastrostomy tube or nasogastric tube feedings within 30 days 
prior to first dose. 
Motor Milestones at Baseline 
Motor  milestones  were  assessed  using  Section  2  of  the  HINE,  which  evaluates  neuromuscular 
development in 8 motor milestone categories. At baseline, the majority of subjects (≥80%) were at the 
lowest level, i.e., had not achieved any milestones for 6 of 8 categories: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
For  Head  Control,  16  subjects  (80%)  could  not  maintain  their  head  upright,  3  (15%) 
maintained with wobble, and 1 (5%) maintained all the time. 
For Sitting, 19 subjects (95%) could not sit and 1 (5%) could sit with support at the hips. 
For Rolling, 19 subjects (95%) had no rolling and 1 (5%) could roll from prone to supine. 
For Crawling, 18 subjects (90%) could not lift their head, 1 (5%) could get on their elbow, and 
1 (5%) could get on their outstretched hand. 
For Standing, 19 subjects (95%) could not support weight and 1 (5%) could support weight. 
For Walking, 19 subjects (95%) could not walk and 1 (5%) could bounce.

For  voluntary  grasp,  3  subjects  (15%)  had  no  grasp  but  17  (85%)  could  grasp  with  the  whole  hand. 
For  ability  to  kick,  6  (30%)  could  not  kick,  13  (65%)  could  kick  horizontally,  and  1  (5%)  could  kick 
vertically. 
The  subject  who  could  sit  with  support  at  the  hips,  roll  from  prone  to  supine,  crawl  on  outstretched 
hand,  who  could  support  his  weight  when  standing,  and  who  could  bounce  when  attempting  to  walk 
was  almost  4  months  old at  Screening  and  had  3  copies of  the  SMN2  gene. Six  of  the  subjects  were 
very young and would not be expected to achieve many motor milestones, but the remainder would be 
expected  to  have  achieved  some  level  of  rolling,  sitting,  crawling,  and  standing,  if  not  for  their  SMA 
disease. 
CHOP INTEND Scores at Baseline 
Baseline  CHOP  INTEND  total  score  ranged  from  17  to  64,  with  a  median  of  27  (64  is  the  maximum 
possible  score).  In  Cohort  1,  scores  ranged  from  22  to  34,  with  a  median  of  26.  In  Cohort  2,  scores 
ranged from 17 to 64, with a median of 28 (Table 38). Twelve of the 16 subjects (75%) in Cohort 2 
had  baseline  scores  in  the  20  to  39  range  while  the  2  subjects  with  3  copies  of  the  SMN2  gene  had 
baseline scores of 42 and 64. 
CMAP Measurements at Baseline 
Baseline  ulnar  CMAP  amplitude  ranged  from  0  to  3.2  mV,  with  a  median  of  0.24  mV.  Baseline  ulnar 
CMAP area ranged from 0 to 8.8 mVms, with a median of 0.58 mVms. 
Baseline peroneal CMAP amplitude ranged from 0 to 2.7 mV, with a median of 0.35 mV. 
Baseline peroneal CMAP area ranged from 0 to 10.7 mVms with a median of 1.19 mVms. 
Weight for Age Percentiles at Baseline 
Weight  for  age  is  a  key  measure  for  growth  assessment.  Weight  for  age  percentiles  were  based  on 
WHO Child Growth Standards, 2006 [WHO 2006]. Overall, baseline weight for age percentiles ranged 
from  the  3rd  percentile  (3.14)  to  the  84th  percentile  (83.89),  with  the  median  weight  for  age  at  the 
37th  percentile  (37.10).  At  baseline,  there  were  3  subjects  below  the  5th  percentile  and  no  subjects 
above the 95th percentile.

SMA history included hypotonia (19 subjects, 95%), limb weakness (19 subjects, 95%), delayed motor 
development  (17  subjects,  85%),  history  of  pneumonia  or  respiratory  symptoms  (9  subjects,  45%), 
and swallowing or feeding difficulties (9 subjects, 45%). One subject (5%) had a history of areflexia of 
the knees that progressed to generalized areflexia.

Pharmacokinetics: 
Concentrations of ISIS 396443 in Cerebrospinal Fluid 
Overall,  interpretation  of  the  data  for  ISIS  396443  concentrations  in  CSF  was  limited  by  the  small 
number of subjects, especially in Cohort 1 (N = 4) and the high degree of variability observed in the 
ISIS 396443 concentrations (coefficient of variation ranging from 34% to >100%). Nevertheless, the 
mean  ISIS  396443  concentrations  in  CSF  increased  over  time  on  all  predose  evaluations  up  to  Day 
1261  (45  months)  in  Cohort  1  and  Day  1135  (40.5  months)  in  Cohort  2,  and  apparent  steady-state 
CSF concentrations were achieved in both (Figure 10). The mean (SD) CSF concentrations achieved at 
Day  1135  in  Cohorts  1  and  2  were  12.2  ng/mL  (8.60)  and  11.1  ng/mL  (4.99),  respectively.  These 
profiles  were  anticipated  given  the  long  terminal  half-life  of  the  drug  (4  to  6  months)  and  the  time 
required for concentrations to reach steady state (5 half-lives, approximately 2 years). The dose level 
in Cohort 1 was lower than that in Cohort 2 for the loading dose period (6 versus 12 mg) and increased 
from 6 to 12 mg (the dose level of Cohort 2) for the maintenance dose period, which began 9 months 
after initiation of dosing. Nevertheless, after an additional 30 months of dosing in Cohort 1 (up to Day 
1261),  the  mean  concentration  range  achieved  between  Days  1135  and  1261  (12.2  ng/mL  and  10.0 
ng/mL,  respectively)  was  similar  to  the  mean  steady-state  trough  concentration  level  observed  in 
Cohort 2 on Day 1135 (11.1 ng/mL). Actual half-life for ISIS 396443 in CSF could not be calculated for

Concentrations of ISIS 396443 in Plasma and Pharmacokinetic Parameters 
As discussed during the MAA evaluation, while being distributed within the CNS, IT administered ISIS 
396443  also  appears  to  be  transferred  from  the  site  of  administration  (CSF)  into  the  systemic 
circulation, with peak plasma levels observed at the first collected timepoint after single and multiple 
doses (1 hour on Day 1 and 4 hours on Day 85). After reaching the observed peak level following the 
1st dose (Day 1) and the 3rd dose (Day 85), mean plasma concentrations of ISIS 396443 declined to 
less than 10% of peak concentration values at 24 hours after IT dosing on Day 1 and less than 1% of 
peak concentration values at 168 hours after IT dosing on Day 85. The rapid decline over the first 24

hours  was  followed  by  a  much  slower  elimination  through  168  days  postdosing,  indicating  a  biphasic 
disposition for ISIS 396443 in plasma following IT bolus administration. There was no accumulation in 
the  mean  plasma  concentrations  after  multiple  doses  (Day  85  limited  profile  and  predose  values  at 
subsequent timepoints) at the 6- or 12-mg dose level (Figure 11). The predose (trough) CSF to plasma 
ratio  was  3-  to  19-fold  during  the  loading  and  maintenance  dose  periods.  The  mean  (SD)  plasma 
concentration achieved on Day 1009 in Cohorts 1 and 2 was 0.855 (0.809) ng/mL and 0.634 (0.226) 
ng/mL, respectively.

Motor Function 
• 
Sustained and clinically significant improvements in HINE Section 2 mean motor milestone total 
scores were observed in both dose cohorts over time. ISIS 396443-treated subjects achieved a 
mean of 13.20 new motor milestones after approximately 3 years on study (Day 1072). 
o  Overall,  12  of  20  subjects  (60%)  in  the  study  met  the  primary  endpoint  of  protocol-
defined improvement in motor milestones, as assessed by Section 2 of the HINE, as of 
the last evaluable study visit. 
o  For subjects with 2 copies of the SMN2 gene and subjects with symptom onset at ≤12 
weeks of age, the majority met the primary endpoint of protocol-defined improvement 
in motor milestones. 
o  As of the last study visit, 2 subjects (10%) achieved walking (holding on or unaided), 4 
subjects  (20%)  achieved  standing  (with  support  or  unaided),  8  subjects  (40%) 
achieved  independent  sitting  (either  prop,  stable  sit,  or  pivot),  and  8  subjects  (40%) 
achieved full head control (all the time upright).

Sustained  and  clinically  significant  improvements  in  mean  CHOP  INTEND  total  scores  were 
observed  in  both  dose  cohorts  over  time,  with  a  mean  improvement  of  21.30  points  after 
approximately 3 years on study (Day 1072), in contrast to the natural history of Type I SMA, 
which is consistent with an overall decline in CHOP INTEND scores over time.

Sustained  and  clinically  significant  improvements  of  mean  CMAP  amplitude  of  the  ulnar  and 
peroneal  nerve  were  observed  in  both  dose  cohorts  over  time.  ISIS  396443-treated  subjects 
experienced  a  mean  increase  from  baseline  in  ulnar  amplitude  (0.703  mV)  and  peroneal 
amplitude  (2.62  mV)  after  approximately  3  years  on  study  (Day  1072),  in  contrast  to  CMAP 
studies  in  untreated  Type  I  SMA  where  subjects  normally  have  values  <1  mV  after  symptom 
onset and do not improve over time. 
Achievement  of  new  motor  milestones  and  increased  CHOP  INTEND  scores  and  CMAP  values 
generally  began  sooner  and  showed  greater  improvement  over  time  in  subjects  who  received 
the  12-mg  loading  dose  (Cohort  2)  compared  to  those  who  received  the  6-mg  loading  dose 
(Cohort  1),  suggesting  that  this  may  be  an  effect  of  the  higher  loading  dose  for  subjects  in 
Cohort 2. 
Growth Parameters 
• 
Overall,  increases  from  baseline  were  observed  in  all  growth  parameters  measured.  When 
considering growth results, it is important to note that the majority of subjects were receiving 
supplemental nutrition by gastrostomy tube or some other means during the study.

Of  the  20  subjects  in  the  Safety  Population,  11  (55%)  were  alive  and  free  of  permanent 
ventilation at the last visit. Of the 5 subjects who died (all of SMA-related causes), 1 died after 
approximately 2.5 years on study, 1 died after less than 1 year on study, and 3 died after less 
than 6 months on study. The subjects who died received 2 to 9 doses of study treatment. 
In  addition to the 5 deaths, 4 subjects met the criteria for permanent ventilation (including 2 
subjects who voluntarily withdrew from the study). 
Safety results 
MAH stated that ISIS 396443 was  well tolerated when administered as multiple IT injections, and no 
maximum  tolerated  dose  was  identified.  No  specific  safety  concerns  were  identified  in  the  overall 
safety profile of ISIS 396443. 
Adverse events 
Of the 802 AEs reported in these 20 subjects, 504 events (62.8%) were assessed as mild, 225 events 
(28.1%)  were  assessed  as  moderate,  and  73  events  (9.1%)  were  assessed  as  severe.  The  most 
frequently  observed  AEs  were  pyrexia  (52  events  [6.5%]  in  17  subjects  [85.0%]),  upper  respiratory 
tract  infection  (47  events  [5.9%]  in  12  subjects  [60%]),  joint  contracture  (38  events  [4.7%]  in  10 
subjects  [50%]),  respiratory  distress  (16  events  [2.0%]  in  9  subjects  [45%]),  and  constipation  (10 
events [1.2%] in 9 subjects [45%]). 
• 
Three  events  (1  AE  of  transient  neutropenia,  1  AE  of  vomiting,  and  1  AE  of  diarrhea)  were 
assessed  as  possibly  related  to  study  treatment.  Vomiting  and  diarrhea  were  also  considered 
possibly  related  to  the  LP  dosing  procedure.  All  events  were  assessed  as  mild  in  severity.  No 
other events were assessed as related or possibly related to study treatment. 
•  When  measured  by  90-day  intervals,  the  incidence of  AEs  and  SAEs  tended  to  decrease  from 
Day  1  through  720,  with notably  fewer  events  over  time in  the  gastrointestinal  disorders  and 
respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders SOCs. 
• 
• 
AEs occurring within 24 or 72 hours of dose administration appeared to be not related to study 
treatment  or  treatment  administration,  and  no  safety  concerns  were  identified  in  the  periods 
immediately following dosing. 
The LP procedure for treatment administration was well tolerated. The frequency and nature of 
the  events  occurring  after  LP  during  the  study  were  consistent  with  those  typically  observed 
following an LP procedure. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Overall, 101 SAEs were reported in 16 subjects (80%). SAEs reported with the highest frequency were 
respiratory in nature, which is consistent with the natural history of Type I SMA: 
SAEs  were  most  frequently  reported  in  the  respiratory,  thoracic,  and  mediastinal  disorders  SOC  (46 
events [45.5%] in 15 subjects [75%]) and the infections and infestations SOC (44 events [43.6%] in 
13  subjects  [65%]),  the  majority  of  which  were  respiratory  in  nature.  Less  common  were  cardiac 
disorders  (5  events  [5.0%]  in  3  subjects  [15%]),  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  and  nervous 
system  disorders  (2  events  [2.0%]  in  2  subjects  each  [10%]),  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  and 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (1 event each [1.0%] in 1 subject each [5%]). 
SAEs occurring in more than 1 subject were as follows:

For all other SAEs, there was 1 event each reported in 1 subject each. 
None of the SAEs were considered related to study treatment or related to the LP procedure. 
Deaths 
Five of the 20 subjects died as a result of SAEs that were either accidental or consistent with the rapid 
natural  progression  of  Type  I  SMA.  None  of  the  deaths  or  SAEs  was  considered  related  to  study 
treatment by the Investigator. 
Overall,  there  were  no  clinically  relevant  changes  related  to  ISIS  396443  in  serum  chemistry, 
hematology,  coagulation,  urinalysis,  vital  signs,  physical  or  neurological  examinations,  or  ECGs. 
Elevations  of  CSF  RBCs  in  3  subjects  appear  to  have  resulted  from  the  LP  procedure  and  are  not 
considered related to ISIS 396443. 
There were no clinically significant differences in the type or incidence of AEs between the loading and 
maintenance  dose  periods,  or  between  Cohort  1  (6-mg  equivalent  loading  dose)  and  2  (12-mg 
equivalent loading dose) during the loading dose period. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Pharmacokinetics 
On  Pharmacokinetic  grounds,  the  updated  data  confirmed  the  overall  conclusions  obtained  in  the 
reduced number of subjects and shorter period of time data evaluated during the MAA application. As 
such,  as  described  at  the  time,  ISIS  396443  trough  concentrations  in  the  CSF  accumulated 
approximately 3.0-fold and reached steady state after multiple 12 mg loading and maintenance doses 
at  around  30  months  in  infants  diagnosed  with  SMA.  No  further  significant  accumulation  in  CSF 
concentrations were observed with additional doses after steady state. From the plasma data, it is also 
confirmed that ISIS 396443 trough concentrations in plasma were relatively low compared to those in 
CSF. After reaching the peak level, plasma concentrations of ISIS 396443 declined rapidly followed by

a  much  slower  decline,  indicating  a  biphasic  disposition  in  plasma.  There  was  no  accumulation  in  the 
mean plasma concentrations after multiple doses 
Following the circulation of the preliminary AR, comments were received from several Member States. 
MS-1 and MS-2 are both in agreement with the Rapporteur and MS-3 has commented the following: 
The MAH should discuss  whether the PK results with longer exposure warrant  any  changes in section 
5.2 of the SmPC “Pharmacokinetic properties”. 
Rapporteur´s  position:  Currently,  the  SmPC  section  5.2  contains  the  following  information  related  to 
the data under evaluation, “Mean CSF trough concentrations of nusinersen accumulated approximately 
1.4-  to  3-fold  after  multiple  loading  and  maintenance  doses,  and  reached  a  steady  state  within 
approximately 24 months.” The presented data was not subjected to any PK modelling procedure, and 
only limited descriptive statistics were performed on the CSF concentrations. From the presented data, 
no  major  differences  were  seen  in  terms  of  accumulation  and  time  tendency  to  multiple  dose  steady 
state  from  the  ones  initially  reported.  Overall,  these  profiles  were  in  accordance  with  a  long  terminal 
half-life  (4  to 6  months)  and  the  time  required  for  concentrations  to  reach  steady  state  (5  half-lives, 
approximately 2 years). 
Clinical: 
Efficacy  results  confirmed  the  effect  of  IT  nusinersen  in  a  population  of  subjects  with  infantile-onset 
SMA.  There  seems  to  exist  a  dose  response  effect,  with  patients  receiving  higher  and  earlier  doses 
having a better response to treatment. The fact that the study was terminated early than expected did 
not allow to have data from the second cohort from day 1352, and data from the 3 earlier visits was 
also curtailed. Notwithstanding, there appears to exist a plateau phase, and only a couple of children 
(who reached day 1261) have evolved beyond a mean plateau. 
Safety  data  is  also  aligned  with  the  interim  analysis  report  and  MA.  Most  AEs  have  reduced  in 
frequency  as  time  went  by,  including  procedure  related  events.  Although  the  number  of  patients  is 
limited, it is  interesting to  see  that  none of  the  events  that  have  been  recently  related  to  nusinersen 
such as meningitis / encephalitis and intracranial hypertension have been identified. Still, some of the 
symptoms such as nausea / vomiting and headaches can be symptoms of the inflammation / increase 
in CSF pressure. 
Following circulation of the preliminary AR, comments on the E&S clinical part were received from MS-
1, MS-2 and MS-3. MS-1 and MS-2 were in agreement, and MS-3 further proposes that the information 
on  long  term  safety  and  efficacy,  including  event  free  survival  and  “the  plateau  phase”  of  motor  skill 
attainment described in the AR, is considered relevant to the prescriber. This  position is endorsed by 
the Rapp and therefore it is added as a Request for Supplementary Information. 
3.  Rapporteur’s 
recommendation 
CHMP 
overall 
conclusion 
and 
The  MAH  has  provided  the  final  results  of  study  CS3A  of  nusinersen  in  Infantile  SMA.  The  interim 
analysis of this study has been used as main data for the assessment and MA of nusinersen. The final 
results have confirmed efficacy in the immediate and medium-long term which corroborate the interim 
analysis data that was considered when giving MA. Safety results in this small sample have not shown 
recently  identified  severe  adverse  events,  namely  encephalitis  or  intracranial  hypertension,  but  the

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

adverse events observed are not different from the ones already known for the product, procedure and 
SMA. 
In  conclusion,  the  final  results  of  the  study  CS3A  are  in  line  with  the  data  provided  by  the  interim 
analysis,  and  do  not  raise  new  concerns  in  terms  of  PK,  efficacy  and  safety.  The  PAM  is  considered 
fulfilled. 
  Fulfilled: 
The MAH should submit a variation application within 60 days of finalisation of this procedure. 
It is proposed that updated information on long term safety and efficacy, including event free survival 
and “the plateau phase” of motor skill attainment described in the AR, is considered relevant to the 
prescriber. Therefore an update to the interim result of study ISIS 396443-CS3A which is already in 
the SmPC should be performed. 
The wording below is proposed for the second paragraph on study CS3A: 
“At  the  time  of  the  planned  interim  analysis  patients  in  the  study  had  a  median  time  on  study  of 
670 days. The  primary  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  patients  who  improved  in  one  or  more 
categories  in  motor  milestones  (according  to  HINE  section 2: ≥2  point  increase  [or maximal score]  in 
ability to kick or voluntary grasp OR ≥1 point increase in the motor milestones of head control, rolling, 
sitting,  crawling,  standing  or  walking).  At  this  time,  13  out  of  20 patients  (65%)  hadTwelve  of  20 
subjects  (60%)  in  the  study  met  the  primary  endpoint  with  a  plateau  improvement  in  mean  motor 
milestone  achievement  over  time.  A  sustained  improvement  in  mean  CHOP  INTEND  score  was 
observed  from  baseline  to  day 6941072 (mean  change 16.9021.30),  but  most  patients  have  not 
evolved  beyond  the  mean  plateau.  Overall,  11  out  of  20 patients  (55%)  met  the  endpoint  of  an 
increase in total CHOP INTEND score of ≥4 points as of their last study visit prior to data cut-off as of 
the last study visit. Of the 20 subjects enrolled, 11 (55%) were alive and free of permanent ventilation 
at the last visit. Four subjects met the criteria for permanent ventilation and 5 patients died during the 
study.”

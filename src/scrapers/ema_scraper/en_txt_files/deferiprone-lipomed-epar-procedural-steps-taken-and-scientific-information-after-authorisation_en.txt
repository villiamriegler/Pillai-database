SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy,

the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Deferiprone Lipomed in the approved indication remains 
favourable and therefore recommended the renewal of the 
marketing authorisation with unlimited validity. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions

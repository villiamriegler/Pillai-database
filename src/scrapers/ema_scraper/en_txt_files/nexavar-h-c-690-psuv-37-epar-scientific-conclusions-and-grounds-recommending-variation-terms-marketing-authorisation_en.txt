Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Nexavar, the scientific conclusions 
of PRAC are as follows:  
Evaluation of the signal hepatic/metabolic encephalopathy revealed three literature cases of toxic 
encephalopathy in advanced HCC patients with cirrhosis. Based on these cases a causal relationship 
between sorafenib treatment and encephalopathy was concluded and the adverse reaction 
encephalopathy is recommended to be included in the product information with a frequency of 
unknown. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding sorafenib, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted.The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the 
PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Nexavar, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance sorafenib is favourable subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
A stand-alone submission of the final study report for the DTPa-HBV-IPV-135 study, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. The DTPa-HBV-IPV-135 study is a Phase III, randomized, 
open-label, controlled, multicenter study to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of GlaxoSmithKline 
(GSK) Biologicals' Infanrix hexa vaccine when administered to healthy infants as primary vaccination at 
2, 4 and 6 months of age, co-administered with Prevnar and Rotarix with a booster dose of GSK 
Biologicals’ Infanrix and Hiberix vaccines at 15-18 months of age. The study DTPa-HBV-IPV-135 was 
conducted in the United States of America. 
The present study 117119 (DTPA-HBV-IPV-135) was intended to generate pivotal immunogenicity data 
demonstrating non-inferiority of the immune responses against pertussis antigens of Infanrix hexa 
compared to Pediarix, which is currently one of the DTaP combination vaccines widely used as a 
standard of care in the US. Additionally, this study was to also provide descriptive data with regard to 
the immunogenicity of the other vaccine antigens and the safety profile in US subjects. These pivotal 
immunogenicity non-inferiority data for pertussis and descriptive safety data were intended to support 
the registration of GSK Biologicals’ combined DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (Infanrix hexa) vaccine in the US. A 
subsequent Phase III study was planned to provide pivotal data regarding lot-to-lot consistency, safety 
and the immunogenicity of the other vaccine antigens. 
Comparison of immunogenicity data from separate clinical studies for Infanrix hexa and Pentacel, given 
on a 2-4-6 month schedule, suggests that the immune response to the Hib component of these 
vaccines is similar. This study was to provide descriptive information regarding the immune response 
to the Hib components of Infanrix hexa and Pentacel following a 3-dose primary series, prior to further 
evaluation in Phase III studies.

To assess the immune response to Infanrix hexa, Pediarix, ActHIB, Pentacel and Engerix-B, in 
terms of seroprotection status, seropositivity status and concentrations or titers of antibodies 
to D (Diphtheria), T (Tetanus), HBs (Hepatitis B surface antigen), pertussis, poliovirus types 1, 
2 and 3 and PRP (Polyribosyl-Ribitol- Phosphate) antigens, one month after the third dose of 
the primary vaccination.  
- 
To assess the safety and reactogenicity of a 3-dose primary vaccination course of Infanrix 
hexa, of Pentacel coadministered with Engerix-B, and that of Pediarix co-administered with 
ActHIB, in terms of solicited local symptoms.  
- 
To assess the safety and reactogenicity of all study vaccines in terms of solicited general 
events, unsolicited adverse events, new-onset chronic illnesses (NOCIs; referred to as new-
onset chronic diseases (NOCDs) in the protocol) and serious adverse events.  
Secondary: Epoch 002 (Booster vaccination)  
- 
To assess the immunogenicity of Infanrix hexa, Pentacel, Engerix-B, Pediarix and ActHIB, in 
terms of persistence of the antibodies to D, T, pertussis, HBs, poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 and 
PRP antigens, before the booster dose.  
- 
To assess the immune response to Infanrix, Hiberix, ActHIB and Pentacel, in terms of 
seroprotection status, seropositivity status and antibody concentrations or titers for D, T, 
pertussis and PRP antigens, and in terms of booster response for pertussis antigens following 
Infanrix and Pentacel, one month after the booster dose.  
- 
To assess the safety and reactogenicity of booster doses of Infanrix, Hiberix, ActHIB and 
Pentacel.

Vaccination schedules:  
Epoch 001  
-  Hexa Group: Subjects in this group were to receive three doses of Infanrix hexa (lot A, lot B or 
lot C as per the group allocation) co-administered with Prevnar13 at 2, 4 and 6 months of age 
and Rotarix at 2 and 4 months of age. 
 He x a _ 1  Gr o u p :  S u b je c t s  w e r e  t o  r e c e iv e  lo t  A o f Infanrix hexa ; 
 Hexa_2 Group: Subjects were to receive lot B of Infanrix hexa; 
 He x a _ 3  Gr o u p :  S u b je c t s  w e r e  t o  r e c e iv e  lo t  C o f Infanrix hexa . 
- 
Pedia Group: Subjects in this group were to receive three doses of Pediarix and ActHIB co-
administered with Prevnar13 at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and Rotarix at 2 and 4 months of 
age. 
- 
Penta Group: Subjects in this group were to receive three doses of Pentacel and Engerix-B* co-
administered with Prevnar13 at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and Rotarix at 2 and 4 months of 
age. 
*Subjects in the Penta Group who received a dose of hepatitis B vaccine from birth up to 30 days prior to study vaccination were not 
to receive Engerix-B at 4 months of age (Visit 2). 
Epoch 002 
-  Hexa Group: Subjects were to receive a booster dose of Infanrix and Hiberix vaccines at 15-18 
months of age. 
- 
- 
Pedia Group: Subjects were to receive a booster dose of Infanrix and ActHIB vaccines at 15-18 
months of age. 
Penta Group: Subjects were to receive a booster dose of Pentacel vaccine at 15-18 months of 
age. 
The fourth dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is recommended to be administered at 
approximately 12-15 months of age. Since the booster dose of the candidate vaccine/active 
controls were given in this study at 15-18 months of age, the fourth dose of Prevnar13 was not 
to be administered as part of the study protocol. Subject’s parent(s)/Legally Acceptable 
Representative(s) (LARs) were to be reminded at Visit 3 and Visit 4 to consult their primary 
health care provider regarding the fourth dose of Prevnar13 at 12-15 months for their child. 
As the analyses were to be performed regardless of the lot of Infanrix hexa received, unless 
otherwise specified, the Hexa_1, Hexa_2 and Hexa_3 groups were pooled together for the 
analysis and were called the Hexa group.

group. All SAE were considered recovered/resolved without sequelae at the end of the study except 
one non-causally related event of Choking in a 47-week-old female in the Hexa group which was 
considered recovered/resolved with sequelae.  
Three SAEs occurring in two subjects were considered causally related to primary vaccination by the 
investigator: An SAE of Lethargy in an 8-week-old female subject in the Hexa group which 
recovered/resolved after one day without sequelae; 2 SAEs in the same subject: one “Apparent life-
threatening event” and one event of Leukocytosis were observed in a 10-week-old female subject in 
the Hexa group which recovered/resolved over 1-2 days without sequelae.  
No fatal SAEs were reported during the primary vaccination Epoch of the study.  
Withdrawals due to AEs /SAEs: Two subjects had adverse events leading to premature discontinuation 
during the primary vaccination period: one Hexa group subject with an SAE of Lethargy reported after 
the first vaccination; one Penta group subject with a Non-Serious Adverse Event of Seizure reported

subject in any group.  
Adverse events of interest: NOCI were reported for 4 subjects (2.4%) in the Hexa group, 1 subject 
(0.6%) in the Pedia group and 1 subject (0.6%) in the Penta group. Only Seasonal allergy symptoms 
were reported by more than one subject in any group: 3 (1.8%) subjects.  
Large injection site reactions up to 4 days (D0-D3) after vaccination: Two subjects (1.3%) in the Hexa 
group and one subject (0.7%) in the Pedia group had Local Swelling, and Diffuse Swelling was 
recorded in one subject (0.6%) in the Hexa group.  
Serious adverse events within 31 days post booster: Non-fatal SAEs within 31 days post-booster dose 
were reported for one (0.6%) subject in the Hexa group (Petechiae), for one (0.6%) subject in the 
Penta group (Seizure like phenomena), and no subject in the Pedia group. 
None of the two non-fatal SAEs were considered to be causally-related to vaccination and both were 
recorded to have an outcome of “recovered/resolved”.  
Withdrawals due to AEs /SAEs: No subject was withdrawn due to an AE or SAE during the booster 
Epoch.  
SAEs for the full study: There were no fatal SAEs throughout the study. SAEs were reported for 8 
subjects in the Hexa group and Penta group, and for one subject in the Pedia group throughout the 
study. 
Conclusion: 
- 
The primary objective of the study was met: One month post-primary vaccination, Infanrix 
hexa was demonstrated to be non-inferior to Pediarix+ACTHib in terms of antibody GMCs for 
the three pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, and PRN).  
-  One month after the primary vaccination: The immune responses to Infanrix hexa, 
Pediarix+ACTHib and Pentacel/Engerix-B were similar between the different groups, in terms of 
seroprotection/seropositivity rates and GMCs.  
The lowest anti-PRP GMCs were observed after Infanrix hexa vaccination as compared to 
Pediarix+ACTHib and Pentacel+Engerix-B.  
EMA/765993/2018  
Page 11/12 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
-  One month after the booster vaccination: The immune responses to Infanrix+Hiberix (booster 
vaccines used after Infanrix hexa priming), Infanrix+ActHIB (booster vaccines used after 
Pediarix+ActHIB priming) and Pentacel were similar between the different groups, in terms of 
seroprotection/seropositivity rates and GMCs.  
Similar Anti-PRP long-term protection antibody levels were observed (≥1.0 μg/mL) between 
Infanrix+Hiberix, Infanrix+ActHIB and Pentacel after booster vaccination.  
-  Safety, reactogenicity: Clinically acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile in the different 
vaccination groups, aligned with the very well-known profiles of the study vaccines. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion 
The Rapporteur agrees with the conclusions of the Applicant. The safety and immunogenicity results of 
this study are in line with the approved SmPC for Infanrix hexa. No updates are considered necessary. 
  PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required

Applicant’s request for consideration
Conditional Marketing Authorisation
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14(7) of the Regulation 726/2004 based on the following claims: Nycomed 
wishes to apply for a conditional marketing authorisation for Teduglutide for the treatment of adult 
patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS). Nycomed request consists of justifications to show that 
Teduglutide falls within the scope of the conditional marketing authorisation regulation (Article 2 of EC 
Regulation N°507/2006). Indeed, given its EU orphan drug designation (EU/3/01/077), Teduglutide 
falls into the Article 2(3) of EC Regulation N°507/2006 that qualifies for a conditional marketing 
authorisation. Moreover, Nycomed claims that the requirements for conditional marketing authorisation 
are fulfilled (Article 4 of EC Regulation N°507/2006), together with Nycomed’s proposal for completion 
of complementary ongoing studies.

2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Introduction
Problem Statement
Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a serious, disabling, socially incapacitating and potentially life-
threatening condition (Nightingale and Woodward, 2006). SBS results from surgical resection, 
congenital defect, or disease-associated loss of intestinal absorption and is characterised by the 
inability to maintain protein-energy, fluid, electrolyte, or micronutrient balances when on a 
conventionally accepted, normal diet (O’Keefe et al., 2006). 
SBS is characterised by large heterogeneity, where some patients are able to compensate for their 
malabsorption of fluids, electrolytes, trace elements, vitamins or nutrients by increasing oral intake 
and adapt metabolically (Messing et al., 1991, Jeppesen et al., 2000), whereas other patients depend 
on parenteral infusions (Fleming and Remington, 1981, O'Keefe et al., 2006, Buchman et al., 2003). A 
large part of this heterogeneity is explained by differences in remnant bowel anatomy (Nightingale and 
Lennard-Jones, 1993). 
Although frequently life saving in Parenteral Nutrition (PN)-dependent SBS patients, the parenteral 
administration of fluids, electrolytes, trace elements, vitamins and nutrients may be associated with 
rare, but potentially life-threatening, complications. Poor catheter care technique and insertion site, 
tunnel and catheter related blood stream infections (CRBSI) may lead to bacteraemia and even 
septicaemia, and the presence of a central catheter may lead to central venous thrombosis and even 
embolism (Buchman et al., 2003). In addition, parenteral constituents and chronic dehydration may 
contribute to PN associated liver and renal disease and even eventually organ failure (Goulet et al., 
2009 Lauverjat et al., 2006). Mutually, the symptoms of SBS and the inconveniences and 
complications in relation to parenteral support may cause potential restrictions in the lifestyle of these 
patients and may lead to significant impairment of their quality of life (Jeppesen et al., 1999, Baxter et 
al., 2006).
Factors associated with the prognosis of SBS include length of residual small intestine, presence of 
residual underlying disease, the presence or absence of the terminal ileum, ileocecal valve and a colon 
in continuity, the nature of the primary disorder, and the degree to which intestinal adaptation takes 
place following resection and/or intestinal injury (O’Keefe et al., 2006). 
Intestinal adaptation is a process where the remaining intestine increases its absorptive capacity to 
compensate for the resected part. In adults, this occurs during the first 1-2 years after 
resection/injury, and is characterized by increase in crypt depth and villus height, mucosal hyperplasia, 
increased mucosal blood flow, improved segmental absorption and increased hepatobiliary secretions 
(O’Keefe et al., 2006).
There are no established pharmacological treatments available for the SBS condition, which receives 
only supportive symptoms related drug care. None the less, in recent years, the hormonal stimulation 
to augment remnant bowel adaptation has been suggested, with glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), a 
peptide which is secreted from the intestinal L-cells following meal ingestion, as a key factor in this 
respect.
About the product
Teduglutide is a novel recombinant analogue for GLP-2, a natural occurring peptide which is secreted 
primarily by the lower gastrointestinal tract. Teduglutide differs from GLP-2 due to an Alanine to 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 8/105
Glycine substitution in the N-Terminus of the 33 aminoacid chain constituting the molecule. The 
aminoacid changing confers to Teduglutide a longer half life of 2 hours compared to its naturally 
occurring analogue. The longer half life is due to a resistance of Teduglutide to the in vivo degradation 
carried out by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV. 
Teduglutide naturally compares to GLP-2 in its mechanism of action. In vitro activation of G-Protein 
coupled GLP-2 receptors is the proof of concept. 
Teduglutide (Revestive) is claimed for the following indication: Revestive is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with Short Bowel Syndrome. Patients should be stable following a period of intestinal 
adaptation after surgery.    
Teduglutide is provided as powder and solvent for subcutaneous injection in strength of 5 mg. This is 
reconstituted with 0.5 ml of sterilised water for injection, i.e. after reconstitution a nominal 10 mg/ml 
solution is obtained. The reconstituted product containing a nominal 10 mg/ml Teduglutide solution is 
administrated subcutaneously with a recommended daily dose of 0.05 mg/kg body weight.
Type of application and aspects on development
This application is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies).
A deferral of the paediatric studies included in the approved paediatric investigation plan has been 
granted (PIP procedure No EMEA-000482-PIP0108, PIP decision number P/238/2010).
There is no specific regulatory guideline for the clinical development of medicinal products for the 
treatment of short bowel syndrome.
Protocol assistance on clinical development was given in July 2003 (EMEA/CPMP/SAWG/3829/03, 
procedure no EMEA/H/SA/420/1/2003/PA) and Follow-up Protocol assistance in June 2007 
(EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/257466/2007, procedure No EMEA/H/SA/420/1/FU/1/2007/PA/II). Furthermore, 
Protocol assistance was given in June 2010 on the paediatric development 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/359238/2010, procedure No EMEA/H/SA/430/3/2010/PA/PED/III)
During the PA procedure 2003 the issues discussed were the selection of the patient population, the 
stabilization procedure to optimize patients’ PN and i.v. fluid requirements and the PN/fluid reduction 
algorithm, the statistical methodology and the handling of the “functional unblinding” of patients, as 
they might become aware if receiving active treatment.  Further, the appropriateness of the proposed 
2 doses 0.05mg/kg/d and 0.10mg/kg/d and the inclusion of a placebo group were discussed and 
accepted by CHMP. Also the proposed primary endpoint, the percentage of patients who reduce their 
PN/fluid requirement by a minimum of 20% of their optimized baseline value was discussed.  This was 
accepted by CHMP, however, it was also mentioned that the clinical significance of this variable should 
not be overemphasized. For instance, if patients adhere to a low frequency of infusions, a 20% 
reduction would not make an important difference. It was also stressed that total weaning from PN 
would be very significant. Furthermore, rather time of infusion than fluid volume is relevant for 
patients’ daily life and in this regard the evaluation of quality of life would be important. 
The follow-up protocol assistance was requested to get advice on the change of the primary endpoint 
(changed from the dichotomous response criterion to an ordered categorical criterion that accounts for 
both duration (weeks 16-20 as well as weeks 20-24) and intensity of response (20%-100% clinical 
improvement)). CHMP did not agree on the change of primary endpoint and advised the company to 
evaluate the primary variable as stated in the original study protocol. The changed variable could be 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 9/105
included as an additional secondary endpoint. Also reduction of PN in days should be included as 
secondary endpoint. 
The protocol assistance procedure of June 2010 related exclusively to the paediatric development.
In the initial submission the applicant requested the application considered under article 14 (7) of 
Regulation 726/2004, i.e. a Conditional Marketing Authorisation. The pivotal basis for the application 
was study CL0600-004; it was proposed to submit study results from a complementary clinical phase 3 
study (CL0600-20) and its ongoing safety follow-up study (CL0600-021) in post-authorisation phase. 
However, in order to satisfactorily address the questions raised by the CHMP, the applicant has 
provided the completed study CL0600-020 as well as an interim report (data cut-off date: June 30, 
2011) of the ongoing study CL0600-021 including the available safety data during the assessment 
procedure. Consequently, the basis for the request for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation was no 
longer valid.

2.2.  Quality aspects
2.2.1.  Introduction
Teduglutide, [gly2]-hGLP-2, is a novel recombinant analogue of the human glucagon-like peptide-2 
(GLP-2) a peptide that is secreted primarily from the lower gastrointestinal tract. Teduglutide is a 33 
amino acid peptide that differs from GLP-2 in the substitution of alanine by glycine at the second 
position at the N-terminus. The single amino acid substitution relative to naturally occurring GLP-2 
results in resistance to in vivo degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV). In 
consequence, the extended half-life (t1/2) of approximately 2 hours for teduglutide prolongs the 
biological activity compared to the native peptide which present with a t1/2 of 7 minutes.
Due to the high analogy between the two molecules and based on the activation of the G-protein 
coupled GLP-2 receptor as an in vitro proof of concept, Teduglutide is deemed to have the same effects 
described for GLP-2.  GLP-2 activation is thought to result in the release of several growth factors such 
as IGF-1, EGF and KGF. Native GLP-2 reduces gastric motility, inhibits gastric acid secretion, increases 
intestinal blood flow, and enhances the transport, absorption and utilization of nutrients. In addition, it 
is involved in regulating maintenance and adaptive growth of the small intestinal mucosa. 
Teduglutide is provided as powder and solvent for subcutaneous injection in a strength of 5 mg. This is 
reconstituted with 0.5 mL of sterilised water for injection, i.e. after reconstitution a nominal 10 mg/mL 
solution is obtained. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance
Teduglutide is a single-chain polypeptide with a mass of 3750.5 Da. It has no disulfide bonds, no 
glycosylation sites, and no post-translational modifications. Structural investigations of teduglutide 
show that the peptide contains varying amounts of α-helix and β-sheet secondary structures, 
depending on the peptide concentration and surrounding conditions. 
The biological activity of teduglutide is measured in a cell-based bioassay, where teduglutide samples 
are measured against a reference standard. Both teduglutide and native human GLP-2 have been 
demonstrated to be fully active in the bioassay. 
Manufacture
Description of manufacturing process and process controls
Teduglutide is expressed by a genetically modified strain of E.coli. The cell culture process is a 
conventional process starting from thaw of Working Cell Bank (WCB) with inoculum build-up and a 
main fermentation with induction. Tetracycline is added to the fermentation medium to maintain 
selective pressure. Teduglutide is secreted to the medium, recovered and purified downstream by four 
consecutive chromatography purification steps and one final desalting step. The pool is filtered through 
a 0.2 µm filter, aliquoted, frozen and stored in buffer. 
Control of materials
The information given on raw materials used in the teduglutide drug substance manufacturing process 
was considered sufficient. Information on origin, sourcing and history of the teduglutide expressing 
E.Coli cell line were given together with the full nucleotide sequence of the plasmid. Generation and 
testing of Master- and Working cell bank is acceptably performed. The procedure for generation of 
future WCBs was described. The genetic stability of the production strain was demonstrated.

Page 11/105
Control of critical steps and intermediates
The number of critical steps in the teduglutide drug substance manufacturing process is limited, which 
reflects the relative simplicity of the teduglutide molecule and of the manufacturing process. Bioburden 
is controlled in the downstream process. The stability of the process intermediates has been 
demonstrated.
Process Validation
The process validation followed a traditional approach. Three consecutive batches were manufactured 
according to the pre-determined operational parameters. Overall the process validation is considered 
acceptable and all data presented are consistently within the acceptance criteria established for the 
validation as well as the in-process limits and drug substance specification. In general, the established 
acceptance criteria for process parameters are considered narrow and expected to support a consistent 
manufacturing process and thereby a consistent and acceptable quality of teduglutide drug substance. 
Depletion of process-derived impurities was monitored throughout the three validation runs, and found 
to be able to reduce these impurities to acceptably low levels.
Manufacturing process development
Three manufacturing scales and sites have been used during development of teduglutide drug 
substance. A side-by-side comparison of batches from the commercial site and the site manufacturing 
the product at the previous scale, including release testing, additional physicochemical 
characterisation, comparison of host-derived impurities as well as stability data have been presented. 
All release- and physicochemical data presented confirmed comparability of teduglutide manufactured 
at the two sites. 
Side-by-side comparison in relation to product related impurities included batches from all three sites. 
Overall comparable levels of impurities have been demonstrated across the three sites and batch 
scales. 
Given the molecular structure of teduglutide and the homology of teduglutide with the naturally 
occurring GLP-2, immunogenicity has been considered with respect to aggregates, E.Coli protein (ECP) 
and purity. The immunological events described indicated that Anti ECP antibodies developed in more 
than 1 out 3 patients but no effect on safety have been demonstrated.
Specification
Characterization
The characterisation was performed on drug substance batches representative for the proposed 
commercial process. The following techniques were employed for structure elucidation: electrospray 
ionization mass spectrometry, SDS-PAGE, isoelectric focusing (IEF), amino acid sequence by N-
terminal sequencing, amino acid analysis, peptide mapping, CD spectroscopy polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis analysis, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and asymmetrical-flow-field-flow-fractionation. 
A bioassay was used to determine the biological activity.
The primary structure of teduglutide was confirmed. The level of α-helix and β-sheet was determined. 
Teduglutide does not exhibit a substantial amount of tertiary structure (i.e. the protein is unfolded).
Impurities
Process-related impurities are separated into host organism-derived impurities and process material-
derived impurities. ECP and endotoxins are routinely measured as part of drug substance batch release 
testing.

Assessment report 
Page 12/105
Characterization of teduglutide product-related impurities was performed using several RP-HPLC 
methods. Most of the remaining impurities identified represent fragments of teduglutide. The identity 
of all significant impurities in teduglutide drug substance was evaluated by HPLC, mass spectrometry, 
N-terminal sequencing, and peptide mapping. 
The biological activity of some of the identified impurities and potential degradation products of 
teduglutide was determined. 
During various studies it has been demonstrated that teduglutide may form aggregates, including 
subvisible and visible particles. Aggregates were, however, only formed under stressed conditions and 
were not formed either under the manufacture or storage conditions. 
Control of Drug Substance (DS)
The drug substance specification included the following parameters: appearance, identity by RP-HPLC, 
identity by peptide map, concentration by RP-HPLC, bioactivity, purity and impurities by RP-HPLC, 
Teduglutide Impurity (1-30) by RP-HPLC, ECP, pH, endotoxins, (Total Aerobic Microbial Count) TAMC 
and (Total Yeasts Moulds Count) TYMC. The methods were sufficiently described and validated. The 
bioassay setup was improved which led also to an improved precision. Analytical results from release 
specification testing of the presented teduglutide drug substance batches, manufactured at the 
commercial site and scale were within the specification. 
Reference standards or materials
There is no international reference standard for teduglutide. The reference standards (teduglutide and 
synthetic 1-30) have been well characterised and their replacement as well as the qualification of new 
reference standards has been acceptably described. 
Container closure system
Container closure system for storage of teduglutide drug substance was sufficiently described.
Stability
Teduglutide is a rather stable molecule which only degrades under harsh storage conditions (high 
temperature, low or high pH or oxidative stress). Degradation product generated under these stress 
conditions have not been seen under the proposed storage conditions. All data have been within the 
specifications and there was no trend indicating degradation or loss of activity. All data support the 
proposed storage of 60 months at -20°C.
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product

Identity and content by RP-HPLC, bioactivity, purity and impurity by RP-HPLC, rate of dissolution, 
water content, endotoxin, sterility. 
The results of the clinical batches comply with specifications in use at the particular time of 
manufacture. 
Container closure system
The primary packaging material was considered to be adequate to support the quality and stability of 
teduglutide drug product. 
Extractable studies were provided. Leach studies were not considered necessary based on the 
toxicological assessment.
Solvent: Water for injection in PreFilled Syringe (PFS)
The information presented on pharmaceutical development as well as on manufacturers, batch formula 
and manufacturing process of sterilized Water for Injection (sWfI) in pre-filled syringes (PFS) was 
considered sufficient. Operating parameters as well as process controls and critical controls were 
indicated. For sterilisation, a standard procedure is used.
The manufacturing process and the IPC performed are considered appropriately described. Thorough 
and adequate process validation was performed.  
The specification for sWfI was set according to the European Pharmacopoeia. The batch analysis data 
presented confirmed that the defined process will assure batch to batch reproducibility for the 0.50 ml 
fill volume.
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 14/105
The stability studies have been carried out in accordance with the current ICH/CHMP guidelines. The 
stability data submitted support the shelf-life of 48 months for the 0.5 mL sWfI pre-filled syringes 
when stored at 2-30°C.
Stability of the product
The analytical methods used for the stability studies were the same as those used for testing at 
release. 
In general, the results support the shelf life of 36 months and the storage conditions as defined in the 
SmPC.
The reconstituted drug product should be used immediately as described in the SmPC.
Adventitious agents
Based on the fact that teduglutide is expressed in E.coli and that all raw material of biological origin  
used in the production are controlled and do not pose any risk of adventitious agents contamination 
risk, the overall adventitious agents safety is considered assured for teduglutide. 
The materials used are unlikely to present any Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) risk 
and are therefore considered to comply with the TSE note for guidance.
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
No major objections were raised during the assessment of the quality part of the dossier. 
During the evaluation process, the Applicant was requested to clarify a number of other quality 
concerns on the manufacturing process and the control of the drug substance and the drug product. 
These issues included the level of aggregate formation, acceptance criteria in specifications and the 
pooling of data across drug substance and drug product to establish specifications.
All these issues were satisfactorily addressed by the Applicant.
In conclusion, information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substances and drug 
product  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate 
satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn 
lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform  performance  in  the 
clinic.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
The nonclinical safety evaluation of teduglutide was conducted in accordance with the ICH guideline S6 
and its recent addendum S6(R1), and all pivotal safety studies were conducted according to Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP).  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology
Human Glucagon-like peptide-2(GLP-2) is a peptide primarily secreted by the lower gastrointestinal 
tract and its activity is mediated through the G protein coupled receptor GLP-2R. It is implicated in 
reduction of gastric motility, inhibits gastric acid secretion, increases intestinal blood flow and 
enhances the transport, absorption and utilization of nutrients. In addition, it is involved in regulating 
maintenance and adaptive growth of the small intestinal mucosa (Estall & Drucker, 2006). 
Native GLP-2 is secreted in response to luminal nutrients by the endocrine L-cell which is primarily 
located in the intestinal tract (Xiao et al., 1999; Estall & Drucker, 2006). The biological half life of 
circulating GLP-2 is relatively short (approximately 7 minutes in humans) due to extensive renal 
clearance and rapid degradation by the proteolytic enzyme DPP-IV (Hartmann et al., 2000; Tavares et 
al., 2000). The biological actions of GLP-2 may be further limited by competition at the GLP-2 receptor 
with its own main metabolite, GLP-2(3-33), that is produced as a result of DPP-IV cleavage. (Thulesen 
et al., 2002: Estall & Drucker, 2006).
Primary pharmacodynamic studies
Teduglutide was shown to increase cAMP accumulation in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells 
expressing rat or human GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) with EC50 values (2.0 ± 0.2nM or 0.5 ± 0.1nM, 
respectively) comparable to native human GLP-2 (1.3 ± 0.2 nM or 0.7 ± 0.2 nM, respectively).
The primary effect of native GLP-2 is mucosal expansion of the small bowel due to the stimulation of 
cell proliferation in the crypt compartment and the inhibition of enterocyte apoptosis. In all species 
tested (mouse, rat, ferret, piglet, dog and monkey), teduglutide treatment resulted in increased small 
intestine weight while variable effects were seen on large intestinal weight and intestinal length. 
Morphologically, teduglutide (and GLP-2) treatment caused an increase in villus height as well as in 
crypt depth. 
Two studies addressed the dose-response relationship for the pharmacological effects of teduglutide. A 
steep sigmoidal dose-response curve for small intestinal weight was observed when evaluated 
following 14 days s.c. treatment of CD-1 mice with teduglutide. The plateau phase of the dose-
response curve was reached at 0.1 mg/kg/day. The ED50 was 0.065 mg/kg/day for a BID treatment 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 16/105
regimen and 0.05 mg/kg/day for a QD treatment regimen, respectively. Furthermore, the effects were 
generally reversible. In rats administered with a continuous s.c. infusion of 0.5, 2.0 and 10 mg/kg 
teduglutide, small intestinal weight, small intestinal length, and mucosal hyperplasia were increased to 
a similar extent in all the teduglutide treated rats. Hence, the plateau phase of the dose-response 
curve was reached already at the lowest dose level. The intestinotrophic effects in rats occurred at 
clinically relevant teduglutide exposure levels. 
In rat models of total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-induced hypoplasia, i.v. teduglutide treatment 
increased small intestinal weight, protein content and villus height relative to rats only receiving TPN. 
No consistent treatment-effect was observed on colon weight. In a rat model of surgically induced 
short bowel syndrome, increased luminal diameter, increased total intestinal and mucosal weight as 
well as increased villus height and increased sucrase activity were observed in the proximal jejunum of 
teduglutide-treated resected rats (0.1 mg/kg s.c. BID) relative to vehicle treated resected rats. No 
treatment-effect was observed on the distal ileum. However, in a study of similar design, teduglutide 
treatment had no effect on any of the evaluated parameters. The applicant ascribes the lack of 
treatment-effect to the analyzed segments being collected from sites immediately adjacent to the 
resection. At these sites, the morphological adaptation is considered to be greatest, leading to less 
obvious treatment-related effects. The position is supported, since the conducted rat studies included 
evaluations within 21 days following resection during which the adaptive response was still ongoing. 
In ferrets s.c. administration of teduglutide for 10 and 20 days resulted in dose-related increases in 
intestinal weight of this non-rodent species. Administration of teduglutide (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg/day s.c.) 
for 10 days to female beagle dogs resulted in mostly dose-dependent intestinotrophic responses. In 80 
% jejuno-ileal resected neonatal piglets, teduglutide treatment (1 mg/kg/day i.v. for up to 7 days) 
resulted in increased ileal and colonic weight, increased mucosal mass in the jejunum and ileum and 
increased small intestinal villus height.
Teduglutide (0.1 to 100 µg intra-arterially) caused dose-dependent stimulatory and inhibitory effects 
on the peristaltic reflex in the antrum, jejunum and ileum of anaesthetized dogs. Moreover, teduglutide 
and GLP-2 inhibited contractility in segments of rat colon with a similar IC50 values (5 and 13.5 nM, 
respectively). 
Overall, the studies conducted in animal models of short-bowel syndrome support that teduglutide may 
have a beneficial effect in the proposed patient population. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies
At concentrations considerably higher than the one which will be achieved clinically, teduglutide 
displayed no significant activity against a panel of G-protein coupled receptors composed of serontonin 
receptors, dopamine receptors, α1-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors and the human GLP-1 
receptor. 
The GLP-2R is expressed by rat and human pancreatic alpha cells and GLP-2 (10 nM) increases 
glucagon secretion in perfused rat pancreas as well as in humans (deHeer et al. 2007; Christensen et 
al. 2010). Furthermore, recent data demonstrate that GLP-2 modulate the intestinal glucose/ Na+ 
transporter SGLT1 (Shirazi-Beechey et al. 2011). Hence, based on the literature data, a treatment 
effect on plasma glucose cannot be excluded. However, no effect on plasma glucose levels was 
observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. No consistent effect on plasma glucose was observed in 
the clinical studies.
Furthermore, GLP-2R mRNA has been detected at various sites within the rat brain. In vitro studies 
suggest that GLP-2R protein is expressed in rodent brain since functional effects of GLP-2 treatment 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 17/105
were observed in murine hippocampal and cortical cell cultures as well as in cultured rat astrocytes. At 
present, it remains to be determined whether or not GLP-2R is expressed in human brain. Brain GLP-2 
has been associated with an effect on feeding behavior. Indeed, intracerebrovascularly administered 
GLP-2 has been shown to reduce food intake in rats (Tang-Christensen et al. 2000, 2001) whereas 
peripherally administered GLP-2 had no effect on appetite or energy intake in healthy volunteers 
(Sorensen et al. 2003). Pharmacokinetic data from rats shows that the passage of plasma teduglutide 
into the cerebrospinal fluid is negligible (2-5% of Cmax). No decrease in food intake was observed in the 
toxicity studies conducted with teduglutide. An increase in food intake and body weight was observed 
in the repeat-dose toxicity studies performed in mice while this finding was neither confirmed in rats 
nor in Cynomolgus monkeys. Moreover, no effects were observed in the rat CNS safety pharmacology 
study at doses up to 25 mg/kg (80-fold the human dose on a mg/ m2 basis). To conclude, it is 
considered unlikely that teduglutide should exert an effect on feeding behavior in patients.
Safety pharmacology programme
The conducted safety pharmacology studies (see table below) did not identify any risk for effects on 
the cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system (CNS). The s.c. CNS study and the i.v. 
cardiovascular/respiratory study applied doses 80- and 100-fold higher than what is applied clinically, 
respectively, when based on allometric scaling (mg/m2). Although not required for biotech products, 
hERG and Purkinje fiber assays were conducted. As could be expected, no treatment-related findings 
were made in these studies.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics
METHOD OF ANALYSIS
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 18/105
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was used to support the toxicity studies with 
the exception of the 90 day juvenile minipig toxicity study for which an LC-MS/MS method was applied. 
Overall, the methods of analysis are considered sufficiently validated.
ABSORPTION, DISTRIBUTION, METABOLISM and EXCRETION
The below tables summarises the Pharmacokinetic parameters after single dose administration of 
teduglutide  in mouse, rat, rabbit minipig and monkey, as demonstrated across studies.
Similar pharmacokinetic properties were observed following single and repeated teduglutide dosing. 
Teduglutide was rapidly absorbed following s.c. dosing with peak concentrations attained in less than 1 
hour in CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley/Wistar rats, in 0.5 to 1.5 hours in pregnant NZW rabbits, 
within 2 hours in Goettingen minipigs and Cynomolgus monkeys and around 4 hours in humans. The 
bioavailability following s.c. dosing was higher than 75% in mice, rats, rabbits, minipigs and monkeys. 
In mice and rats, there was an excellent relationship between dose level and plasma exposure, 
especially based on the AUC values. In rabbits, minipigs and monkeys, the exposure to teduglutide 
generally increased in a dose-proportional manner. Teduglutide plasma exposure (AUC and Cmax) was 
generally lower in female mice and rats than in males while a similar trend was not observed in 
rabbits, minipigs or monkeys. The half-life ranged from 0.4 to 0.7 hours in mice and rats and from 0.8 
to 2.0 hours in rabbits, minipigs and monkeys and was around 2 hours in humans. Teduglutide was 
predominantly confined to the blood compartment since the volume of distribution approximately 
corresponded to the blood volume in mice, monkeys and humans whereas it was higher than the blood 
volume in rats. The clearance of teduglutide was 163 to 744 ml/hr/kg in all species studied. Altogether, 
teduglutide displayed similar pharmacokinetic characteristics in the animals used for toxicity testing 
and in humans.
The studies investigating the distribution of teduglutide are limited. The calculated apparent volume of 
distribution indicated that teduglutide was mainly distributed in the plasma compartment. Conventional 
radiographic assays to investigate the accumulation of the test substance in the different tissues were 
not performed. 
In order to determine whether teduglutide penetrates the blood-brain barrier, samples of cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) and plasma were collected from rats administered teduglutide s.c. at a single dose of 3 or 
10 mg/kg. The CSF teduglutide concentration did not exceed 5% of the peak concentrations in plasma. 
The results indicated that teduglutide did not readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier.
The extent of placental transfer of teduglutide after s.c. administration to pregnant rabbits and lacteal 
excretion in lactating rats were investigated. Only 0.1% of the dams’ plasma level was detected in 
foetal rabbits and did not differ from background estimates (ELISA). Hence, the transfer of teduglutide 
across the rabbit placenta is minimal to nonexistent. In rats, the mean milk concentration was 0.9% 
and 2.9% of the corresponding mean maternal plasma concentration at 1.5 and 4 hrs, respectively. 
Therefore, the excretion of teduglutide into rat milk is expected to be very low.
Specific studies to investigate metabolism of teduglutide are not presented. It is known, that the native 
GLP-2 peptide is rapidly cleaved by the serine protease DPP-IV resulting in a peptide with a significant 
lower activity. Teduglutide is more resistant to protease degradation when compared to GLP-2. It is 
expected that the teduglutide will be cleaved into small peptides and that this small degradation 
products will undergo the physiological metabolism of peptides and amino acids. 
The excretion of teduglutide was not investigated in detail. Publications show (Tavares et al, 2000; 
Marier et al, 2008), that the peptide and its break down products will likely be eliminated by the 
kidney. Experimentally, it has been demonstrated that the kidney plays a significant role in the 
clearance of teduglutide.

To support the safety of teduglutide, a complete toxicology assessment was conducted, including 
single-dose toxicity, repeat-dose toxicity, genetic toxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and 
developmental toxicity, and other toxicity studies using mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys, minipigs, 
and rabbits. The provided non-clinical documentation on toxicity was in accordance with the 
requirements laid forward in ICH S6 guideline and the ICH S6 Addendum.  
Single dose toxicity
Teduglutide was evaluated for acute toxicity following 2 s.c. injections administered 8 hours apart on a 
single day in a mouse study (88614). The mice received a total dose of 200 mg/kg and no teduglutide-
related findings were noted. The maximum tolerated dose in mice is therefore considered to be above 
200 mg/kg. 
The maximum s.c. dose administered in non-rodents was 50 mg/kg (25 mg/kg BID) for 13 days in 
pregnant rabbits (487001) and 50 mg/kg (25 mg/kg BID) for 3 days in Cynomolgus monkeys (88616) 
and did not produce any acute toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose in non-rodents is therefore above 
50 mg/kg.
The lack of a dedicated single-dose toxicity studies is acceptable and in accordance with the current 
recommendations from EMA (CHMP/SWP/302413/08 and EMA/CHMP/SWP/81714/2010). The acute 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 21/105
toxic potential of teduglutide appears low as s.c. doses more than 50-fold higher than the 
recommended human daily dose were well-tolerated in mice, monkeys and pregnant rabbits.
Repeat dose toxicity
The repeat-dose studies were conducted in CD-1 mice (up to 26-weeks) and in Cynomolgus monkeys 
(up to 52-weeks). Mice and monkeys were chosen because both have demonstrated the expected 
intestinotrophic effect upon teduglutide administration. All dose levels applied in the repeat dose 
toxicity studies, including the lowest dose level of 0.2 mg/kg/day produced an intestinotrophic effect in 
mice, monkeys and rats. The upper dose level (25 mg/kg/day in monkeys and 50 mg/kg/day in 
rodents) was considered the highest feasible dose. 
The pattern of toxicity was consistent amongst the various species studied, with the majority of the 
findings being associated with the pharmacodynamic action of teduglutide: Hypertrophy and 
hyperplasia of the intestinal mucosa and increases of food consumption and body weight compared to 
control. Effects on intestinal mucosa were described as increased length of intestinal villi and enlarged 
crypts. The exaggerated pharmacodynamic activity of teduglutide included a stimulation of cell 
proliferation which gave rise to hyperplasia of bile- and pancreatic duct epithelium. The inflammation 
observed in bile- or pancreatic ducts was most likely secondary changes related to hyperplasia-induced 
dysfunctions of the epithelium. These findings either partially or completely resolved during the 
recovery period. The hyperplasia was observed in mice and monkeys at clinical relevant exposures. 
Other findings included an elevation of the transaminase enzymes, injection site reactions and signs of 
a response of the haematopoietic system. 
The observed elevation of the transaminase enzymes was less than 2-fold in the high dose groups and 
neither dose-related nor associated with liver cell degeneration. The elevated ASAT values could be 
associated with the injection site irritation. 
At the injection site, chronic inflammation was a common finding. The inflammation exhibited dose-
response relationship and was most pronounced in monkeys (mild to severe) and less severe in mice 
(minimal to mild) and rats (minimal to moderate). At least partial recovery of the local toxicity was 
noted following a non-treatment period of several weeks duration. 
Effects on the haematopoietic system included increased white blood cell parameters, splenic 
extramedullary haematopoiesis, and myeloid hyperplasia. Nevertheless, an assessment of the 
haemolytic potential or the plasma compatibility of teduglutide in whole blood or plasma from mouse, 
rat, cynomolgus monkey and human showed that teduglutide neither caused haemolysis nor 
precipitation at blood or plasma concentrations of 0.1, 1.0 or 10.0 mg/ml. 
The applicant evaluated the effects of exaggerated pharmacology in the non-clinical species as non-
adverse.  Hence, the NOAEL in the pivotal chronic toxicity study in mice was 50 mg/kg/day in mice, 
i.e. the highest dose tested, corresponding to a mean safety margin of exposure (AUC) of more than 
178-fold compared to the mean exposure level in patients treated with 0.05 mg/kg/day. The 
established NOAEL of 5 mg/kg/day in monkeys was based on the severity of injection site reactions at 
higher doses and correlated with a mean safety margin of exposure (AUC) of 54-fold. However, clinical 
adverse effects related to biliary and pancreatic system and clinical findings related to injection site 
reactions to teduglutide such as pain reactions and erythema have been recorded.
Genotoxicity
Teduglutide was negative in standard in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies. According to the ICH 
Guidance for industry S6, proteins are considered to be non-genotoxic.

Carcinogenicity
The carcinogenic potential of teduglutide and its associated risk in humans was evaluated according to 
the ICH Guidance for industry S6, in association with its recent addendum S6(R1). Since standard 
carcinogenicity bioassays are generally inappropriate for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals such 
as teduglutide, a product-specific assessment was performed, based on a 2-year rat carcinogenicity 
study with teduglutide and literature published on the in vitro and in vivo activity of other Gly2-GLP-2 
peptides.
An overview of the conducted long-term rat carcinogenicity study is given in the table below

Cholangioma/intestinal 
adenoma 
In a Wistar rat carcinogenicity study, treatment related benign neoplasms included tumours of the bile 
duct epithelium seen in males treated at 10 and 35 mg/kg/day (at an incidence of 1/44 and 4/48, 
respectively) and adenomas of the jejunal mucosa was seen in 1/50 males at 3 mg/kg and 5/50 males 
treated at 35 mg/kg/day. In addition a jejunal adenocarcinoma was observed in a male rat 
administered 3 mg/kg. Since a dose-response effect is present for bile duct hyperplasia and no 
cholangiomas are observed at 3 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg is the NOAEL for bile duct cholangiomas. However, at 
the terminal sacrifice, all evaluated males displayed jejunal hyperplasia, indicating that a plateau effect 
was obtained already at the lowest dose level (3 mg/kg). Hence, it cannot be excluded that the single 
cases of jejunal adenoma and jejunal adenocarcinoma observed at 3 mg/kg are related to treatment. 
This conclusion is supported by the finding that jejunal adenomas and carcinomas were not observed 
in 532 Wistar male control rats included in five carcinogenicity studies conducted within the same time 
frame and at the same contract research organization as the teduglutide rat carcinogenicity study. The 
jejunal neoplatic findings were made at plasma exposure levels ≥ 8-fold higher than is observed in 
patients administered the recommended daily dose.  
Based on tumour initiation studies in mice, teduglutide may exert a tumour-promoting effect. 
Teduglutide does not have a direct growth promoting effect on isolated tumour cells thus it most likely 
acts indirectly via induction of release of growth mediators. Considering that teduglutide and GLP-2 
induce intestinotrophic effects, it is not unexpected that intestinal neoplasms may occur following life-
long treatment of rats. Hence, it cannot be excluded that teduglutide may have a tumour-promoting 
effect in patients undergoing long-term treatment. However, in line with the ICH S6 addendum, growth 
factors pose a potential carcinogenic risk which can best be evaluated by post-marketing clinical 
surveillance rather than further nonclinical studies.  To this purpose an International Short Bowel 
Syndrome Registry, including reports of malignancies in patients treated with Teduglutide has been 
requested as post authorisation obligation.  Moreover, even though the preclinical observation have not 
been confirmed in clinical studies, based on these data it is contraindicated for patients with a history 
of gastrointestinal malignancies to be treated with Teduglutide. Special warning of polyps removal is 
suggested before teduglutide treatment starts and an enhanced gastrointestinal survelliance for 
malignancies, scheduled based on the patient characteristics, should be performed. Revestive therapy 
should be suspended in case of active or suspected malignancy.

Based  on  studies  of  placental  transfer  and  milk  excretion  of  teduglutide  only  limited  exposure  of  the 
embryos/foetuses  and  pups  are  expected.  Hence,  treatment  related  findings  were  unlikely  to  be 
recorded in the reproductive toxicology studies. Indeed, no adverse effects were recorded on fertility or 
embryo-foetal  development.  The  observed  increased  incidences  of  incomplete  ossification  of  foetal 
skull  or  ribs  in  rat  foetuses  were  not  dose  related.  These  changes  are  not  uncommon  in  the  applied 
strain  of  rats  and  the  recorded  incidences  were  within  the  range  of  historical  background  data.  The 
reproductive  development  as  well  as  viability,  growth,  behaviour  and  learning  capability  of  the  F1 
generation were unaffected by treatment.
Juvenile toxicity studies were conducted in 7-day old mini-pigs and 5-day old rabbits with SC 
teduglutide dosing for 90 and 14-days, respectively. Similar treatment-effects as well as 
pharmacokinetics were observed in the juvenile and adult animals thus teduglutide treatment did not 
cause adverse effects on the developing gastrointestinal tract.

Daily s.c. injections of formulations containing ≥20 mg teduglutide for 14 days induced local irritation 
characterized as adverse in Goettingen minipigs. Three injections of ≤30 mg teduglutide applied every 
fourth day induced a local reaction comparable to that of the vehicle. The local tolerance of teduglutide 
following intravenous, perivenous or intraarterial administration in rabbits was similar to that of the 
vehicle. Reactions were mainly limited to haemorrhages and erythema which were reversible. 
Therefore, misadministration of the medicinal product is not suspected to cause irreversible lesions.

Mice and monkeys developed antibodies against teduglutide. In mice the antibody response was weak 
and not associated with a decrease of exposure or pharmacodynamic activity. In monkeys the 
occurrence of antibodies was much more pronounced. However, the pharmacodynamic activity was not 
affected.
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
According to the "Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human 
use" (EMEA, 2006), peptides are exempted from the need to provide an environmental risk 
assessment, because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Thus, an 
environmental risk assessment for teduglutide is not required.
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
From the results of non-clinical experiments, the primary effect of Teduglutide is represented by 
mucosal expansion of the small bowel due to the stimulation of cell proliferation in the crypt 
compartment and the inhibition of enterocyte apoptosis. Morphologically, teduglutide (and GLP-2) 
treatment caused an increase in villus height as well as crypt depth.
Summary of the non-clinical pharmacokinetics indicates that teduglutide was rapidly absorbed after 
subcutaneous administration. The systemic exposure increased mostly linear over the applied dose 
range with a bioavailability above 75 % in all species investigated. No gender or strain differences 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 26/105
were noted. The calculated apparent volume of distribution indicates that teduglutide was mainly 
distributed in the plasma compartment. Distribution results indicate that teduglutide did not readily 
penetrate the blood-brain barrier. The transfer of teduglutide across the rabbit placenta was minimal to 
nonexistent and the presence of teduglutide into rat milk is expected to be very low. Specific studies to 
investigate the metabolism of teduglutide are not presented, but it is expected that teduglutide will be 
cleaved into small peptides and subsequently amino acids.  The excretion of teduglutide was not 
investigated in detail but publications show (Tavares et al, 2000; Marie et al, 2008), that the peptide 
and its break down products will likely be eliminated by the kidney. This is an expected result, since 
small peptides are hardly retained by the renal system. 
Toxicity studies evidenced no effect on reproduction, pregnancy, lactation and off spring development. 
This was to be expected since the placental transfer of teduglutide in rabbits and milk excretion of 
teduglutide in rats is very limited. Still, as a precautionary measure and as reported in the SmPC, 
teduglutide use during pregnancy or during breast feeding is to be avoided. 
Attention should be posed on immunogenicity even though phamacokinetics seemed not be affected by 
increase in anti-teduglutide antibody response reported in mice and monkey. To this end a further 
assessment of antibody and safety data are required to be collected in the on-going long term clinical 
study CL0600-021 and a separate presentation of respective case reports in a special section of the 
PSUR is considered. 
Local injection site irritation after repeated s.c. administration has been evidenced in mini-pigs at 
doses higer that those meant to be used in clinical practice
In the repeat-dose toxicity studies, exaggerated pharmacological effects of teduglutide including biliary 
and pancreatic duct hyperplasia were observed in mice and monkeys at clinical relevant exposures. 
The applicant considered the exaggerated pharmacodynamic effects observed at high dose levels as 
non adverse as they were fully/partly reversible and there was no indication of tissue dysfunction. 
Based on tumour initiation studies in mice, teduglutide may exert a tumour-promoting effect. 
Teduglutide does not have a direct growth promoting effect on isolated tumour cells thus it most likely 
acts indirectly via induction of release of growth mediators. Moreover, in the long term rat 
carcinogenicity study, jejunal neoplastic findings were made at plasma exposure levels ≥ 8-fold higher 
than is observed in patients administered the recommended daily dose. Therefore, considering that 
teduglutide and GLP-2 induce intestinotrophic effects, it is not unexpected that intestinal neoplasms 
may occur following life-long treatment of rats. Hence, it cannot be excluded that teduglutide may 
have a tumour-promoting effect in patients undergoing long-term treatment. As previously mentioned 
a series of precautions have been considered in order to address this issue. 
To this end a recommendation has been adopted by the CHMP in which, for information purpose, the 
final study report for the 2 year mouse carcinogenicity study (NPS pharmaceuticals, study protocol P09 
002) should be provided within the framework of the Risk Management Plan. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that teduglutide may have 
a beneficial effect in the proposed patient population. Altogether, teduglutide displayed similar 
pharmacokinetic characteristics in the animals used for toxicity testing and in humans. Valuable pre-
clinical information on fertility, pregnancy, lactation and off spring development have been reflected in 
the SmPC. Injection site irritation and immunogenicity evidenced in animals have then been assessed 
in humans. Carcinogenic risks as described above are reported in the SmPC (4.3 – 4.4 – 5.3) as

reflecting suggestions for patients exclusion, preventive monitoring of pre-existing neoplastic 
manifestation, for measures related to continuos monitoring and for possible withdrawn of the drug in 
case of malignancy diagnosis. Moreover, as post authorisation measure the CHMP requested a registry 
for a long term observational safety study.

2.4.  Clinical aspects
2.4.1.  Introduction
Revestive has been studied after s.c and i.v. injection in seven phase 1 study. S.c. administration has 
been used for the phase 2 and for two phase 3, double blind placebo controlled studies. Long term 
safety of Revestive has been further evaluated in two open label studies, extension of the two phase 3 
studies. One already completed at the moment of the opinion and the other still on-going and which 
results submission are required as post authorisation measures. An overview of the clinical 
development program is given in the table below. 
Revestive is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Short Bowel Syndrome. Patients should 
be stable following a period of intestinal adaptation after surgery. 
The recommended dose of Teduglutide is 0.05 mg/Kg body weight once daily. In patients with 
moderate and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 50 ml/min) and end-stage renal 
disease, the daily dose should be reduced by 50%.
There are currently no scientific guidelines available for this indication. Protocol assistance has been 
received from the European Medicines Agency on clinical and paediatric development.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics
Analytical methods
Three different assays were used to determine the concentrations of teduglutide in the clinical 
pharmacology program: an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and two assays based on 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 31/105
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS (Germany), LC-MS/MS 
(USA). 
The ELISA assay’s Lower Level of Quantification (LLOQ) (0.5 ng/ml) in plasma exceeded the usual 
systemic GLP-2 levels of 15-80 pmol/L (0.06-0.30 ng/ml) which corresponded to less than 60% of the 
LLOQ. The Cmax values of teduglutide following therapeutical doses were always above 10 ng/ml. 
Therefore the expected levels of GLP-2 and its main metabolite did not significantly contribute to the 
measured teduglutide level. 
Settings of the LC-MS/MS mass analyser allowed the selection of ions +/- 1 Dalton (Da). The peak of 
the teduglutide ion was 1.6 Da and the difference between teduglutide and GLP-2 was 3.5 Da. This 
difference assured a selective quantification of both molecules, as both signals did not overlap. The 
maximal theoretical influence of GLP-2 peak levels on the measured teduglutide concentration was less 
than 2% which was not relevant with regard to the accepted variability of the analytical method. 
The differences in teduglutide concentrations obtained with the LC-MS/MS assay method compared 
with the ELISA method were not statistically significant for blood samples collected from 30 minutes 
through 10 hours post-dose. At lower teduglutide plasma concentrations (<20 ng/ml), greater 
differences between the methods were observed. 
A non-compartmental analysis (NCA) has been performed using concentrations from ELISA and LC-
MS/MS (study CL0600-015). The results from the comparison of PK parameters between ELISA (test) 
and LC-MS/MS (reference) showed that there was no statistically significant difference in Cmax, Tmax, 
and T1/2 between the two assays used (p-values: 0.0559, 0.305, and 0.148, respectively). AUClast and 
AUC∞ showed a statistically significant difference between the two assays (p-values: 0.0008 and 
0.000002, respectively). However, the relative differences (geometric means of the ratios) are -7.86% 
for AUClast and -11.08% for AUC∞. These differences have been assumed not to be relevant as the 
variabilities (geometric CV%) are 24.8% and 27.6% (ELISA and LC-MS/MS) for AUClast and 21.8% and 
26.4% for AUC∞. 
Nonlinear mixed-effect population modelling approaches (PopPK) were used to characterize the typical 
PK profile of teduglutide and determine the mean and individual subject PK paramters. Various subject 
characteristics were tested as potential covariates affecting the PK parameters of teduglutide.
Absorption 
Bioavailability 
Teduglutide was absorbed with a peak concentration at 3-5 hours after subcutaneous administration, 
and rapidly eliminated with t1/2 of approximately 2 hours that has been confirmed for the to-be-
marketed concentration (10 mg/mL). Teduglutide, administered as a s.c. injection possessed an 
absolute bioavailability of 88%. No accumulation of Teduglutide was observed following repeated 
subcutaneous administration.
Bioequivalence
The applicant has provided data demonstrating a lower exposure after s.c. injection in the thigh and 
arm and also a low acceptance for the arm as injection site was seen. Considering the variability in 
plasma levels, the reduction of bioavailability as being proven for arm and thigh, compared to the 
abdomen might be of concern. According to the popPK sampling results according to injection site, a 
mixed application of the injections (into abdomen and thigh) has not been obviously associated with 
lower plasma levels. Therefore, although the thigh had a lower exposure than the abdomen, in case 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 32/105
the injection into the abdomen is hampered by pain, scarring or hardening of the tissue, the thigh can 
also be used.
Drug products from 4 different manufactures were used. No bioequivalence study has been performed 
on the different drug preparations used in the different clinical trials but extensive in-vitro testing has 
demonstrated comparability between teduglutide drug products manufactured at different sites. The 
applicant presented a PopPK-analysis with all available PK parameters from all early and late clinical 
studies, comparing the impact of the different manufactures (Group 1-4). The applicant made a 
thorough analysis of AUC, considered in this case as the most important PK parameter showing that 
Group 1 and 2 AUC was comparable to Group 4 AUC, and since Group 4 is the to-be-marketed product, 
it was acknowledged that these groups were comparable. The same analysis revealed that relative 
bioavailability, the apparent volume of distribution and the exposure (AUC) were significantly different 
only in Group 3 (Can/BI; 54 mg/ml). a dose investigated in study CL0600-022 exploring tolerability. As 
a quite large CV% of AUC was seen overall (AUC∞ 21.8-26.4%), the app. 20% lower values of AUC 
seen was not suspected to influence the overall picture of exposure.  Lagtime of absorption (ALAG) was 
different for all groups, but this was considered not relevant by the applicant due to the long term use 
of teduglutide.  In conclusion, Group 1, 2 and 4 can be accepted as being equivalent concerning PK 
parameters. 
Distribution
The volume of distribution has been determined for i.v. infusion, and for s.c. administration in different 
studies, and was given with markedly different values, ranging from 122 l to 28 l, depending on 
administration, type of study, and the concentration of the administered formulation. Further analyses 
showed that partly, the discrepant values are owed to different methods of administration of the study 
drug, and different method of determination of the value (steady state or single dose), and is obviously 
also dependant on the population studied. 
Elimination
The mean clearance was approximately equivalent to the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), which 
indicated that teduglutide was mainly cleared by the kidneys. Data from the PopPK analysis showed 
that Creatinine clearance (Clcr) depended on renal function. The renal clearance of teduglutide was 
confirmed by study CL0600-018 in renally impaired volunteers. Teduglutide was eliminated with a t½ of 
1.6 and 1.7 hours, respectively, in subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment, and 2.2 hours 
in subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) compared with 1.4 to 1.6 hours in healthy matched-
control subjects. 
Metabolism
The metabolism of Teduglutide in the body has not fully been investigated. Being a peptide, 
teduglutide is not likely to be metabolized by common drug metabolizing enzymes such as CYP, 
glutathione-S-transferase, uridine- diphosphate glucuronyltransferase. Instead it is likely to be 
metabolized by hydrolytic degradation like native GLP-2. It is assumed that the protein will be cleaved 
within the plasma to smaller proteins by unspecific proteinases, and by DDP-IV, which is responsible 
for the degradation of GLP-2. However, teduglutide has a markedly higher resistance to degradation 
from DDP-IV, resulting in longer half-life, as compared to its native counterpart. Therefore, considering 
the nature of the compound being a short-chain protein, almost similar to endogenous GLP-2, the 
expected consequence of teduglutide metabolism is degradation to small peptides and amino acids.

Assessment report 
Page 33/105
Dose proportionality and time dependencies
The exposure to teduglutide (Cmax and AUC) increased in a dose-dependent manner thus possessing 
dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In the tolerability study CL0600-022 the total exposure of 
teduglutide increased proportionally with increasing dose levels and peak plasma concentrations 
increased in a proportional manner over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg. The PK-parameters were very 
similar across dose ranges between 10 and 80 mg teduglutide administered daily on Day 1 compared 
to Day 8, suggesting minimal accumulation of the drug following repeated subcutaneous 
administrations.
Special populations
None of the covariates age, gender, race and dosing occasion had a significant effect on the PK 
parameters Cl/F, V/F, and Ka. This has been confirmed by an updated PopPK analysis. Similar PK 
results have been reported in healthy subjects, and patients with SBS or Crohn’s disease. Moreover, 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification, Grade B) has been demonstrated to slightly 
impact reducing the PK parameters of maximum and overall exposure of 10-15. On the other hand, 
subjects with renal impairment are expected to be exposed to higher teduglutide level due to reduction 
of elimination. Progressive renal impairment, including end stage renal disease, impacted on PK 
parameters of Teduglutide, with an increase up to a factor of 2.6 for AUCinf and 2.1 for Cmax when 
comparing patients to healthy subjects. 
Weight of the subject/patient has been detected to be a significant factor for the PK of teduglutide 
during a first analysis. The addition of the prediction of the exposures according to body weight (based 
on the new Pop-PK model, which has – contrary to the original model – taken the higher clearance in 
SBS patients into account) has still a high variability, and an overall range from the lowest body weight 
of 40 kg to the highest of 120 kg of more than 100%. As this can overall obviously not be avoided – 
even with the fixed dosing – the final proposed dosing scheme has been considered acceptable, 
because this has been tested in the clinical studies.
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies
An in vitro pilot study has demonstrated that teduglutide did not inhibit the activity of any of the 
human cytochromes at concentrations 4- and 40-fold of the peak concentrations occurring in humans 
at a clinical dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day. In addition, teduglutide being administered subcutaneously 
determines that potential PK drug interactions associated with first pass metabolism or efflux 
mechanisms in the intestine or liver are of no consequence.
After in-vitro investigations of interaction with cytochrome metabolizing enzymes have shown that the 
potential drug drug interaction is low, the applicant, due also to the nature of the compound, did not 
investigate the potential for interactions any further. Moreover, the applicant has presented a PK 
evaluation for co-medication influence on teduglutide PK parameters, and was unable to find relevant 
changes
There appears to be a potential for DDIs following the PD activity of the compound, which might result 
in enhanced absorption of other compounds. The applicant analysis did not indicate that a relevant 
potential for drug-drug interactions with any of the identified concomitant medications used in the two 
clinical studies can be identified. Nonetheless a potential for increased absorption of concomitant 
medicinal products should be taken into consideration.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics (PD)
The clinical pharmacodynamics of the compound have been characterised in altogether 6 studies, of 
which 5 relate to the primary pharmacodynamics, and one relates to the secondary PD. 
In three of the 5 studies dedicated to the primary PD, plasma citrulline was measured being regarded 
as a biomarker of enterocyte mass. These were the studies CL0600-015 in healthy volunteers (relative 
bioavailability of three different administration sites), study CL0600-008 (the study in CD patients), 
and in study CL0600-004 (the pivotal clinical study). 
In general, plasma levels of citrulline increased after teduglutide treatment. However, the increase in 
citrulline was not associated with a decrease in PN volume. Hence, a key role of plasma citrulline in 
assessing the PD effect of teduglutide is not supported, and thus has not been further assessed.
In addition, PD effects were measured within study ALX-0600-92001 (the dose finding study) by 
measuring parameters of gastrointestinal absorption and structural changes, and in study CL0600-004, 
in which biopsy samples were taken from the small and large intestine.
The sixth study (C09-001) was a study to evaluate the effect of teduglutide on cardiac repolarisation 
(tQT study) and therefore relates to the secondary pharmacology.
Mechanism of action
The effects of native GLP-2 and teduglutide are mediated by the GLP-2R, which is a high-affinity, 
ligand-specific functional receptor coupled to a stimulatory G protein, which activates adenylate cyclase 
and thereby increases cyclic AMP concentration (Munroe et al., 1999).
Based on non-clinical data in animal models of SBS and normal animals (Drozdowski and Thomson, 
2009, Estall and Drucker, 2006, Martin et al., 2004), teduglutide is expected to produce epithelial 
structural effects that would result in increases in absolute and relative absorption of fat, nitrogen, 
sodium, potassium, calories and gastrointestinal fluids and consequent decrease in faecal or stomal 
output of fat, nitrogen, sodium, potassium, calories and fluid.
Primary pharmacology
The 21 days dosing (Study ALX-0600-92001, for detailed description see 2.5.) with teduglutide 
resulted in increased jejunal villus height and crypt depth (as observed on biopsy samples) and 
enhanced gastrointestinal fluid absorption at doses of 0.10 and 0.15 mg/kg/day as well as 
improvement in the absorption of macronutrients and electrolytes, associated with decreased stomal or 
faecal volume and macronutrient content were observed. The absorption of all measured parameters 
returned to baseline level after stopping the treatment for 3 weeks.
The expansion of the absorptive epithelium by inducing significant changes in the villus height and 
crypt depth in the small and large intestine has been further confirmed after a 24-week treatment 
(study CL0600-004) with teduglutide at doses 0.05 mg/kg and 0.10 mg/kg daily. A dose response 
relationship could be seen regarding the expansion of the absorptive epithelium, but a dose response 
relationship was not seen in PN volume, probably due to the heterogeneity of the patients. The lowest 
dose of teduglutide, 0.05 mg/kg/day reduced the absolute amount of administered parenteral energy 
per week by 7916 KJ. The corresponding reduction for 0.10 mg/kg/day was 3278 KJ. The CHMP further 
acknowledges that this apparent lack of a dose-response relationship may be due to both doses 
eliciting close to the maximal effect of the drug.

Secondary pharmacology
Teduglutide appeared not to influence heart rate conduction velocity, as the results of the thorough QT 
study (Study C09-001) presented can exclude a relevant effect on QT.  No validated cases of QTcF 
increase of >30 ms and no QTc values above 450 ms was seen.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
Three different assays (one ELISA and two LC-MS/MS) were used in order to determine concentrations 
of teduglutide for characterising the pharmacokinetics of the drug. A non-compartmental analysis was 
performed showing no statistical significant difference in Cmax, T½ and Tmax between the two assays. 
AUClast and AUC∞ were different but not relevant due to large CV% for AUC. The assays have been 
demonstrated to be established and validated, demonstrating sufficient accuracy and precision. They 
have been, therefore, considered suitable for their intended use. Acceptable standard methodology has 
been applied for the evaluation of the PopPK
As a conclusion on bioequivalence of route of administration, the arm as injection site does not appear 
to be acceptable, and should be deleted from the dosing recommendations. The thigh, instead, is 
considered acceptable, however, only in case one of the four quadrants of the abdomen can no longer 
be used by the patient due to hardening, scarring, pain, etc..
In the comparison of the different drug preparation used during clinical trials the Applicant has finally 
provided documentation to support the claim for bioequivalence. PK parameters AUC, bioavailability 
and volume of distribution was comparable, except for the higher strength 54 mg/ml (can/BI), which 
was used in one tolerability study, and not in the dose finding study. Also for the different strengths 
comparable PK parameters were shown in the PopPK parameters. 
The use of the Vd from the value obtained from the PopPK, as the actual Vd for Teduglutide, has been 
considered acceptable by CHMP, considering the fact that the distribution between volunteers and 
patients does not appear to be very discrepant, and the 90% CI of the value determined for patients 
does include the PopPK determined values for healthy volunteers (which was 31.73 l). The statement 
in the SPC specify that the Vd has been determined based on the data for patients.
Based on the Pharmacokinetic data on blood clearance of Teduglutide discussed by the applicant, and 
the questionable use of radiolabelled assay, as an appropriate method, to further investigate its 
metabolism and excretion, the above reported renal excretion is accepted. Furthermore, T½ was

prolonged in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease, 
suggesting renal clearance of teduglutide. Creatinine clearance (CLcr) as a covariate in the PopPK 
analysis, predicted increasing AUC with decreasing CLcr. Therefore, it is likely that the main route of 
elimination is renal, and it has been acknowledged that a proper AME-study is not likely to lead to 
further interpretable results. Dose linearity and drug accumulation of teduglutide PK parameters are 
reassuring up to the dose of 20 mg either under single or repeated s.c. administration.
Special population studies indicate that particular attention should be posed on teduglutide treatment 
in renal impaired patients with a required dose reduction to 50% in patients with moderate and severe 
renal impairment. Mild and moderate hepatic impairment does not attract adjustment of the dose. 
Data on severly impaired hepatic patients are not available. 
The conclusions stated by the applicant about drug drug interaction are endorsed: it is unlikely that 
clinically relevant drug-drug induction resulting from enzyme induction of CYP enzymes would occur at 
therapeutic doses. Nonetheless, based upon the pharmacodynamics effect of Teduglutide, there is a 
potential for increased absorption of concomitant medicinal products, therefore patients receiving oral 
medicinal products requiring titration or with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored closely. 
From the pharmacodynamic data presented, it can be deduced that teduglutide acts on the GLP-2 
receptor, and exerts a roughly dose-related effect on the architecture of the epithelia of the large and 
small intestine with an obvious early “saturation” of the PD effects. Teduglutide increases the 
absorption of fluids and nutrients by increasing the expression of transporter proteins at the cellular 
level, and exerts a trophic effect by inducing an increase in gastrointestinal tissue mass, as proven by 
the increased villus height and crypt depth in the small and large intestine. Moreover, Teduglutide 
appears not to influence heart rate conduction velocity and, as the results of the thorough QT study 
presented, can exclude a relevant effect on QT.
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
Further to the extensive discussion on the pharmacokinetic aspect of teduglutide, it is overall 
concluded that the pharmacokinetics of the compound have been studied in satisfactory manner. 
The mechanism of action of teduglutide showed a dose response relationship regarding the expansion 
of the absorptive epithelium, even though this is not reflected in PN volume changings; the latter 
probably due to the heterogeneity of the patients. Teduglutide appears not to influence heart rate 
conduction velocity. Overall, the mechanism of action of teduglutide appears to be sufficiently clarified, 
and it is considered that no additional data/studies are necessary.

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies)
Study ALX-0600-92001: The study “Open-label-multicenter, dose-ranging, pilot study to examine 
the safety, tolerability and effect of a 21 day, ascending, multidose subcutaneous treatment with ALX-
0600 (Teduglutide) in patients with short bowel syndrome” was conducted between 2000 and 2001 in 
5 trial centers in the US and Europe. The primary objective of the study was to determine the safety 
and tolerability of a 21-day s.c. dosing regimen of teduglutide in SBS patients. The secondary objective 
was to measure the PD effect on the capacity of the remaining bowel to absorb water and 
macronutrients after 21 days treatment. The patient population included consisted of males and

females over 18 years of age with a diagnosis of SBS due to vascular ischemic disease, malrotation, or 
volvulus, or with quiescent IBD. Patients should have undergone intestinal resection at least 12 months 
before entering the study and residual small intestine had to be less than 150 cm in length. Patients 
had also to present with normal body weight, normal albumin levels, and no use of glutamine 
supplementation for at least 4 weeks. Patients without colon were eligible and had to have at least 
50% of their caloric intake by PN; patients with colon had to have at least 50% of their colon 
preserved with a fecal weight exceeding 1.0 kg/day (of a 72 hour stool collection period) and fecal 
energy loss of more than 2.0 MJ/day (or fecal fat loss of more than 50 g/day on their habitual diet). 
Patients with active IBD, history of pseudo obstruction, recent surgery, fistulae, and others had to be 
excluded. 
Patients distribution to the different dose and treatment groups are summarized in the table. 
Table: Dosing groups in Study 92001
The study consisted of four phases: screening phase (Days -14 to -1), a pre-dose phase (Days -3 to -
1), 21-day dosing phase, and 21-day follow-up phase. The study was closed before all planned 
patients had been enrolled due to slow enrolment. Altoghether, 18 patients were enrolled. One study 
participant was discontinued before receiving study medication. A total of 17 patients therefore 
received study medication, of which 2 were discontinued prematurely. Of the 15 patients that 
completed the study, 3 patients from group 3 and 2 patients from group 3 re-enrolled into the study 
(Group 4).
The clinical evaluation part of the study was conducted on the PP population, which consisted of 16 
patients (1 patient was excluded due to febrile episodes considered unrelated to study drug). The 
demographic characteristics of the study groups were approximately similar. Of the patients, 8 (47%) 
were male, 16 (94%) were Caucasian, and the mean age was 49 years, with a mean weight of 59 kg 
and mean height of 168 cm. 12 of the 17 patients had Crohn’s Disease as underlying cause of SBS.
For the purpose of the PD/clinical parameters evaluation, three 72 hour nutrient absorption tests were 
used to measure the capacity of the intestine to absorb macronutrients. Urinanalysis test were used 
both for safety and for determining fluid excretion via the kidneys. D-Xylose tests with plasma and 
urine collections were also performed as a measure of malabsorption. The results from the 72-h 
nutrient absorption test were not consistent.

Table: Summary of absolute absorption by group
In this respect, it is important to take into account that this test was not fully controlled, i.e. though 
each patient in principle was offered identical food for three days to reflect his or her normal diet, it 
was not ensured that the intake was carefully monitored or identical for each patient in between study 
periods. This resulted in variations in the quantity and composition of ingested food between study 
periods. 
In order to receive a more consistent picture of the activity of the compound, pooled groups were 
analysed and did, indeed, reveal more consistent results. For this purpose the 0.10 and 0.15 QD group 
(PG1), the 0.10, 0.15 QD plus colon 0.10 QD (PG2), the 0.10 QD plus 0.10 colon (PG 3), and all 
groups (PG4) were pooled.

2.5.2.  Main studies
Study CL0600-004: 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group study comparing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two 
doses of teduglutide (0.05 mg/kg/day and 0.10 mg/kg/day) and placebo 
in subjects with Parenteral Nutrition-Dependent Short Bowel Syndrome.
Methods
Study participants
A relevant adult study population with SBS due to the most common causes of SBS (surgical resections 
due to Crohn´s disease, cancer, vascular insufficiency and volvulus) was included in the study. SBS 
patients with possible fluctuating activity in the disease (due to radiation therapy, active crohn´s 
disease and celiac disease) were excluded. Patients had to be dependent on PN at least 3 times weekly 
for at least 12 months.; though the process of intestinal adaptation following major surgery 
(potentially influencing the effect of teduglutide) may expand beyond 12 months depending on the 
physiology of the remaining intestine, this is considered acceptable. Prior to randomisation to study 
treatment patients had to be stable in their disease for the past 4 weeks as measured by 
usage/volume of PN, urinary output, urine sodium, renal function, haematocrit, and motility altering 
medications.
Protocol criteria for inclusion included the following:

SBS as a result of major intestinal resection, e.g. due to injury, volvulus, vascular disease, 
cancer (disease free for at least five years), Crohn’s disease (if in clinical remission, as 
determined by clinical assessment)

Body weight < 90 kg
 Major intestinal resection resulting in at least 12 months of PN dependency at least 3 times 
weekly to meet their caloric or electrolyte needs due to ongoing malabsorption


Treatments
The study CL0600-004 consisted of a screening-, PN optimisation- and a treatment period. 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 41/105
 
All subjects enrolled into the study were challenged prior to randomization during an optimisation 
period (3 days to 8 weeks) to attain their optimal (minimal) PN requirement. All subjects were 
subsequently to undergo a minimum 4-week stabilisation period on that volume of PN prior to 
randomization. The study visits for dosing of PN occurred at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20, with the last 
scheduled visit at Week 24 of the dosing period. The extension study (CL0600-005) permitted all 
subjects on active treatment (if completing the 24 week treatment period) to continue on their 
assigned dose for a total of 12 months (“1-Year Active Group”), and allowed those subjects on placebo 
in study CL0600-004 to be prospectively randomized to either 0.05 or to 0.10 mg/kg/day teduglutide 
for 28 weeks in study CL0600-005 (“6-Month Active Group”)
Teduglutide (0.05 or 0.10 mg/kg/day) or matching placebo was administered by the s.c. route once 
daily into one of the four quadrants of the abdomen or either thigh, for 24 weeks. 
Relevant clinical criteria had been set up for optimisation and adjustment of the PN during the 
treatment period. The purpose of the optimisation period was to establish the minimal tolerated 
baseline level of PN that results in a urine output between 1.0 and 2.0 L/d.
Laboratory safety samples were evaluated at least once during the seven days following a PN 
reduction, accompanied by determination of 48-hour urine output. In addition, evidence of 
dehydration, such as body weight, clinical signs and symptoms, was assessed day 3 to 4 and day 6-7 
following a reduction ().
The use of placebo treatment during the main study has been considered acceptable given that no 
other marketed comparator is available for this condition. Furthermore, the PN/i.v. fluid requirements 
were optimised (for up to 16 weeks) with the need for demonstration of stability in the PN/i.v. 
requirements for at least 4 weeks prior to double blind study treatment. In addition, the criteria for 
adjustments in PN were clear.
Objectives
The objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 
teduglutide compared with placebo in subjects with parenteral nutrition(PN)-dependent Short Bowel 
Syndrome (SBS).
Outcomes/Endpoints
The initial planned primary endpoint was the dichotomous responder criterion (“Number and 
percentage of subjects who demonstrated a response (≥20% reduction from Baseline in weekly PN 
volume) at Week 20 maintained at Week 24”). In February 2007 (the last subject completed the study 
in July 2007) the initially planned primary endpoint was exchanged after an independent review of the 
protocol. The new primary endpoint was an ordered categorical (graded) criterion accounting for 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 42/105
duration (weeks 16 and 20 and weeks 20 and 24) as well as intensity of response (percentage 
reduction in PN volume; 20-100%) meaning that subjects with larger, earlier and/or more sustained 
response had higher “weight” in the outcome (score of 0-5, table 9.5 below). 
The term “PN volume” was used to describe the efficacy of teduglutide regardless of the composition of 
PN (parenteral infusion of fluid, energy (nutrients) and/or electrolytes). 
The secondary efficacy variables were the following:
- The number and percentage of subjects who demonstrated a response at week 20, and who 
maintained that response at week 24, which was defined as the achievement of at least a 20% 
reduction from baseline in the weekly PN volume.
- The number and percentage of subjects who achieved at least a 1-day reduction in weekly PN
- The absolute reduction from baseline in weekly PN kilojoules (transformed from Kcal).
- The absolute reduction of weekly volume of PN from baseline
- The change from baseline in plasma citrulline at dosing week 24
For a subset of selected study centers, an additional secondary variable was evaluated at weeks 8 and 
24 with the testing of intestinal absorption of fluid, energy, nitrogen, fat, carbohydrate, sodium, 
potassium, magnesium and calcium
Exploratory efficacy variables were defined as:
- Time to 20% reduction in PN volume, time to discontinuation of PN, time to a 1-day reduction in 
weekly PN, number and percentage of subjects with reduced i.v. catheter access at week 24, change 
from baseline in bone markers BSAP and NTx, in lumbar spine ad hip BMD, and in PTH at week 24, 
change from baseline in QoL at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 (scores to be used were: SF-36, IBDQ, 
and abbreviated EuroQol)., the mucosal crypt-villus architecture and cellular composition within the 
small and large intestine.
Within the study, a 72-hour nutrient absorption study was to be conducted in selected centers, 
citrulline as marker of PD activity was evaluated, and, as mentioned above, endoscopic and histological 
evaluation of the small and large intestine was performed in subsets of patients. A PK substudy was 
also conducted.
Sample size
The sample size calculation was based on the initially planned primary endpoint providing 90% power 
to detect an anticipated minimum response (20% decrease in PN for Weeks 20 to 24) in 5% of the 
placebo treated- and 50% of the teduglutide patients. No formal justification for the anticipated 
response rates has been provided. The actual difference in responder rates between placebo vs. “total 
teduglutide” only amounted to 30% (please refer to the efficacy section). Thus, the power of the study 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 43/105
seems significantly reduced compared to the one forming the basis for the sample size calculation 
leading to a not negligible risk of type 2 error.
Randomisation
80 subjects were planned to be randomized in a 1:2:2 ratio to one of three treatment arms: placebo, 
0.05 mg/kg/day teduglutide, or 0.10 mg/kg/day teduglutide (32 subjects in each of the teduglutide 
treatment groups and 16 subjects in the placebo group). The subjects have been randomized at the 
Baseline/Dosing Day 1 visit using an interactive response system called the Fisher Automated Clinical 
Trials Services (FACTS). The Randomization was balanced for treatment groups, participation in the 
72-hour nutrient absorption test, and PN at three levels of consumption [PN consisting of IV fluid and 
electrolytes only (3-7 times weekly), PN 3-5 times weekly, and PN 6-7 times weekly]. Subjects were 
randomized across centers rather than within a center. 
Blinding
Teduglutide and placebo vials and their content were identical in appearance. The study center 
personnel, the sponsor, and all personnel associated with monitoring or data management for the 
study were blinded to the treatment assignment. Persons responsible for assessment of PN 
requirements and adjusting doses of PN were to be different from the ones conducting physical 
examinations, and assessing safety. This was introduced in order to assure blinding due/despite to 
swelling of the stoma (as an effect of mucosal hyperplasia).
Statistical methods
The following populations were used for the statistical analyses:
The intention-to-treat (ITT) population: All randomised subjects who received at least one dose of 
study drug. The ITT population was used for analyses of efficacy (primary, secondary and exploratory 
efficacy outcomes).
The per-protocol (PP) population: All subjects in the ITT population who were compliant with study 
medication doses and had a week 20 visit and the additional post-Week 20 visit (i.e. approximately 24 
weeks of dosing). The PP population was used for analyses providing additional support for the efficacy 
argument (primary and secondary efficacy outcomes).
The primary and several of the secondary efficacy outcomes were based on a weekly average of the 
daily diary PN volumes collected from the CRF raw datasets and then placed into the analysis datasets. 
The “weekly” PN volume calculation for 14 days was [Sum (PN volume during the preceding 14 
days)/(14 days)] x 7 days. Patients were classified as responders if they had ≥ 20% reduction in 
weekly PN volume from baseline to week 20 sustained through week 24 dichotomising the expanded 
variable´s responses into a yes/No variable.
For the primary variable, the response variable was to be summarized using descriptive statistics 
(mean, STD, median, min and max for continuous variables, no. and percent of subjects in specified 
categories and corresponding 95% CIs, etc). The pairwise comparisons were to be made using a rank 
analysis of covariance (an extension of the Wilcoxon rank sum test) with strata for baseline PN levels 
with the basleine weekly PN volume as a covariate. A step-down procedure will be used to adjust for 
multiple comparisons.
The secondary variable was to be summarized by the number and percentage of responders and the 
corresponding 95% CIs for each treatment group. Pairwise differences were to be presented, including 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 44/105
their 95% CIs. Pairwise comparisons between the groups were to be made using Fisher’s Exact Test, 
also in a step-down procedure.
The additional secondary efficacy variables were to be summarized using descriptive statistics. For the 
change from baseline, pairwise differences between the treatment groups, the corresponding 95% CIS, 
and pairwise t-tests were to be made using estimates from a 2-way repeated measures ANCOVA with 
the model including effects for baseline PN consumption levels used for stratification (see above) and 
with the baseline weekly PN volume as a covariate. For rates, treatment group comparisons were to be 
made using a rank analysis of covariance with stratification for the baseline PN consumption level used 
for stratification with the baseline weekly N volume as a covariate.
The statistical analysis plan further defined these analyses. It stated that the primary evaluation had to 
be based on the ITT population, with the PP population being secondary. 
The SAP also defined more in detail the step-down procedure to be used for adjusting for multiple 
comparisons stating that if the 0.10 mg/kg/d teduglutide group is not statistically significantly different 
from the placebo group, no further comparison will be made. If it is, placebo will be compared to the 
lower dose group, and, as a final step, the two teduglutide groups will be compared.
There was a requirement to have at least 9 out of 14 daily PN volume data points for the weekly PN 
volume calculation. If less data were available for the specific period of time the patient was left out of 
the analysis for that specific time point. Thus, an imputation method for missing data for the weekly 
PN volume calculations was not implemented. The applicant subsequently provided evidence that the 
three study groups were well balanced as regards overall frequency of patients with missing values and 
frequency of patients with “many missing values” (i.e. more than ten). Thus differential “missingness” 
is unlike to have had any major effect on the results of this study. In study CL0600-020 (see below), 
sensitivity analyses utilising different ways of handling missing data, demonstrated that the results 
were not sensitive to this factor. Patients who discontinued the study prematurely was assigned the 
score “0” for the response variable (i.e. no response). This is considered the most conservative 
approach.

93.8%, 77.1% and 90.6% in the placebo-, 0.05mg/kg/d- and 0.10 mg/kg/d groups completed study 
CL0600-004. As can be deducted from these data a considerable part of patients randomised to 0.05 
mg/kg/d discontinued the study (8 patients, 22.9%). These discontinuations were due to AE (5 
patients, 14.3%) and subject decision (3 patients, 8.6%). 
Table Reasons for subjects’ withdrawal:
Recruitment
The first subject was screened on 25th May, 2004, and the last subjects evaluations were performed 
on 06th July, 2007. Considering the trial duration of half a year, the recruitment took approximately 2 
½ years to be completed. Considering the rareness of the disease, recruitment speed appears to be 
appropriate.
Conduct of the study
The study was conducted from May 2004 to July 2007 at 32 centers in the USA (15), Canada (4), and 
European countries (13 centers in the UK, France, Denmark, Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and 
Germany).  
There were 39 (46.4%) subjects who were reported as having an Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria protocol 
violation during the course of the study. The most frequently reported Inclusion Criteria violation was 
Inclusion Criterion 8 (adequate hepatic function) with 16 subjects (41.0%) followed by Inclusion 
Criterion 6 (4- week stability before randomisation with respect to PN, urinary output, renal function, 
urinary sodium, Hct etc) with 13 subjects (33.3%)
During the course of the study, 4 protocol amendments were performed. The first one, introduced in 
December 2003, among minor amendments, introduced an additional 72-hour nutrient absorption test 
at week 8, removed the treatment satisfaction assessment, and added the citrulline assessment. 
Amendment 2, introduced in March 2004 included a multitude of changes, which were mostly minor 
(e.g. administrative information etc). Amendment 3 (and amendments 3a and 3b) were introduced in 
November 2004 (and July and October 2005).  These amendments were also minor, the amendments 
3a and 3b changed the site-specific requirements for the DXA scans. 
The major protocol amendments took place with protocol amendment 4 (February 2007) which 
introduced the new primary efficacy endpoint (see above). Amendment 4b and and Amendment 4 
(administrative) were again minor amendments introduced in June and September of the year 2007.

Baseline data
The mean age in the included study population was 48.8 years (median 52 years) and the percentage 
of female patients was 55.4%. The vast majority of included patients were Caucasian (92.8%)  These 
parameters were balanced between the treatment groups. Also with respect to height, weight, BMI, 
smoking status, alcohol consumption and parenteral nutrition history the groups were balanced. 
There was, however, a noticeable imbalance in the PN consumption level at study entry. Only 9.4% in 
the 0.10 mg/kg/d group were on i.v. fluids only as compared to 22.9% in the 0.05 mg /kg/d group and 
25.0% in the placebo group. In contrast, 34.4% in the high dose group were patients with the highest 
PN requirements (6-7x weekly) compared to 25% in the placebo group and 22.9% in the 0.05 
mg/kg/d group. Also in the extension study the percentage of patients receiving i.v. fluids only was 
approximately half of the percentage in the 0.10/0.10 compared to the 0.05/0.05 mg group. 
Imbalance was also observed with respect to the cause of intestinal resection: Around 40% in the 0.10 
mg/kg/day had a resection due to Crohn’s disease and around 29% due to vascular disease whereas 
an inverse relationship was observed in the 0.05mg/kg/day group. More important than the aetiology 
of SBS in the prognosis of transition to enteral feeding are, however, the length of the remaining small 
intestine and the segment of the remnant intestine, if there is the colon and the ileocoecal valve is 
present. 
More patients in the 0.10 mg/kg/day group had a stoma (mostly jejunostomy and ileostomy) 
compared to the 0.05 mg/kg/day group (43.8% vs. 28.6%). In addition, the high dose group had the 
lowest percentage of patients with colon in continuity (59.4% vs. 74.3% in the 0.05 mg/kg/day group 
and 68.8% in the placebo group). Furthermore, in the high dose group the percentage of patients with 
the shortest remaining colon (25-50% remaining colon) was highest (42.1%, compared to 26.9% in 
the 0.05mg/kg/day group and 36.4% in the placebo group). In contrast to the 0.05 mg/kg/day group 
where 80.3% of patients had an ileocecal valve, only 37.5% of patients in the 0.10 mg/kg/day group 
(and 33.3% in the placebo group) had an ileocecal valve. 
Numbers analysed
The number of patients involved in the study and their subdivision based on treatment received is 
reported in the table. 
The percentage of patients continuing to the extension study 0600-005 was lowest in the 
0.05 mg/kg/day group (71.4% compared to 81.3% and 81.8% in the placebo and 0.10 mg/kg/d 
groups, respectively). The applicant subsequently clarified that among patients who had completed the 
study, the fraction of patients continuing into the open label extension study was similar in both dosing 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 47/105
groups. The difference in overall fraction of randomised patients who continued into the open label 
study was due to differences in discontinuation rates during the placebo controlled study. 
Outcomes and estimations
There was no statistical significant difference between teduglutide 0.10 mg/kg/day vs. placebo in the 
graded response score (p=0.161) used as primary endpoint. According to the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP) no further statistical testing was then planned. Still, a decision to proceed to analysis of the low 
dose was taken based on clinical evidence of efficacy. A low p-value was generated for teduglutide 
0.05 mg/kg/day vs. placebo (p=0.007). There were 1 (6.3%), 16 (45.7%) and 8 (25%) responders in 
the placebo-, 0.05 mg/kg/day- and 0.1mg/kg/day group, respectively. The total effect of teduglutide 
(pooled response: 35.7% were responders) was much lower than expected in the power calculation, 
thus forming the basis for a type 2 error. Most responders had a score of 1 and 2 (of note one placebo 
subject – the only responder- had a score of 2). Still, 19 patients (54%) and 24 patients (75%) in the 
low- and high dose groups were non-responders with a score of 0 (<20% reduction in weekly PN 
volume). 
Overall, these results obtained in the low dose group are promising but can only be considered for 
hypothesis generation. 
Secondary efficacy results
Whereas no statistically significant difference was observed on the binary efficacy endpoint (+/- 20% 
reduction in weekly actual PN infusion volume from baseline to Week 20 and maintained at Week 24), 
for 0.1 mg/Kg/day teduglutide vs. placebo (25.0% vs. 6.3%. p=0.172), a low p-value was also 
observed for this endpoint for 0.05 mg/kg/day teduglutide vs. placebo (45.7% vs. 6.3%, p=0.005). 
The responder rates were higher at the end of the extension study CL0600-005 (after 52 weeks 
treatment) being 68% for 0.05mg/kg/day and 51.9% for 0.1mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of loss 
of efficacy of teduglutide after 52 weeks treatment. The responder rates for patients initially treated 
with placebo switching to teduglutide in the extension study were 83.3% and 42.9% for 0.05 
mg/kg/day and 0.10 mg/kg/day, respectively. The results from the extension phase seem promising, 
but careful interpretation is deemed, due to the low number of study subjects and lack of control 
group.
The ultimate goal of treatment in SBS is weaning-off PN. It is indeed noteworthy that 4 subjects (3 in 
the 0.05mg/kg/day and 1 in the 0.1mg/kg/day) were weaned off after teduglutide treatment (3 in 
study CL0600-004 and 1 in study CL0600-005). 
Although 4 patients were in fact able to be weaned off PN in the study CL0600-004, the efficacy as 
such did unfortunately not translate into other positive efficacy parameters such as reduced days on 
PN, reduced weekly PN volume, improved quality of life or reduced frequency of complications.
Achievement of at least one day reduction in weekly PN: 4 (25%), 11 (31.4%) and 3 (9.4%) subjects 
in the placebo, low- and high dose treatment groups, respectively achieved at least one-day reduction 
in weekly PN. The difference vs. placebo was not statistically significant for any of the teduglutide 
groups. In fact, the high dose group did worse than placebo. 
The algorithm for decreasing PN support did not specify that accumulated effects of teduglutide should 
be converted into decreased number of days on PN. Furthermore, it was possible to rearrange the 
weekly PN support without decreasing the weekly volume infused. These conditions could potentially 
explain the poor response for the high dose and the seemingly large placebo response (25% achieved 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 48/105
at least one day reduction in weekly PN). However, the data provided do not allow conclusions in this 
regard. 
After 52 weeks of treatment the percentage of subjects achieving at least 1-day reduction in PN-use 
was also higher in the 0.05 mg/kg/day group (68%) vs. the 0.10 mg/kg/day group (37%). The rate in 
the initial placebo group switched to 0.05mg/kg/day seemed similar after 28 weeks (66.7%) as for 
subjects treated with 0.05 mg/kg/day for 52 weeks. In view of the high placebo response in study 
CL0600-004, the low numbers in each treatment group, the large number of centers included in the 
study each with a potential differentiated approach to PN adjustments and finally that no placebo 
group was included in the extension study CL0600-005, the results should be interpreted cautiously. 
Absolute Change from Baseline in Weekly PN Kilojoules: The reductions in weekly PN kilojoules were 
numerically higher for teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/day (-6994KJ). The weekly reductions for placebo 
(-3545KJ) were higher than for teduglutide 0.10 mg/kg/day (-1587KJ). The difference 0.05 mg/kg/d 
vs. placebo was not statistically significant (P=0.136). Data from study CL0600-005 seem to indicate a 
similar response in placebo treated subjects switched to 0.05 mg/kg/day and 0.10 mg/kg/day, 
respectively. A post-hoc analysis was performed excluding those patients requiring i.v.-fluid PN only. 
Based on this analysis teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/day (mean (SD) change from baseline -7916 (9329) KJ) 
was proven superior to placebo ((mean (SD) change from baseline -1958 (3527) KJ) (P=0.0375). 
Change from baseline in Weekly PN volume: The low- and high dose of teduglutide induced mean (SD) 
reductions in weekly PN volumes from baseline to week 24 of – 2.48L (2.34) and -2.47L (3.33), 
respectively. The corresponding reduction for placebo was -0.90L (1.41). The difference for active 
treatment vs. placebo was not statistically significant. The Applicant argues that these similar 
reductions in weekly PN volumes between the two teduglutide arms indicate similar effect of the two 
dosages. While the data may indicate that the maximal effect of teduglutide may have been reached 
upon administration of 0.05mg/kg/day and that no additional effect will be obtained by increasing the 
dose to 0.1mg/kg/day no firm conclusions can be drawn. The two teduglutide treatment groups had 
several imbalances in baseline data but the applicant subsequently provided evidence that these 
imbalances were not likely to explain the difference in efficacy. 
48-Hour Oral Fluid Intake and Urinary Output: 48 hr urine collections were to be completed 2 days 
ahead of a visit. Patients were told to try to keep the timing, quantity and quality of beverages as 
constant as possible during the 48 hours collection period. The quantity of urine collected may however 
have been influenced by +/- PN infusion during the collection period. From baseline to week 24 both 
active treatment arms had reductions in 48-hr oral fluid intake (0.05 mg/kg/day -95.0mL (range:-
3340 to 5990); 0.10 mg/kg/day -410.0mL (range: -4570 to 950); median values) and increases in 48-
hr urine output (0.05mg/kg/day 420.0mL (range:-500 to 3740); 0.10 mg/kg/day 132.5mL (range: -
3900, 1450); median values). This was in contrast to subjects in the placebo arm, who had both 
increased 48-hr fluid intake and – urine output (390.0mL (range: -4261 to 2400) and 200.0 (range -
975 to 1895), respectively; median values).  
Change from baseline in plasma citrulline at week 24: Plasma citrulline levels are believed to be a 
predictive marker of absorptive enterocyte mass and intestinal failure (< 20µmol/L) in patients with 
SBS (Crenn P et al, gastroenterology 2000, 119: 1496 and Santarpia L et al, Ann Nutr Metab 2008; 
53: 137). However, no correlation between the increased plasma citrulline levels and PN volume 
reduction was established for teduglutide treated subjects.
Changes from Baseline in Crypt-Villus Architecture and Cellular Composition within the Small and Large 
Intestine at Week 24, and Intestinal Absorption of Fluids, Energy, and Nutrients Over 72-hour Period: 
Both teduglutide doses increased villus height in the small intestine. Only the high dose caused a 
significant change vs. placebo on large intestine crypt depth and small intestine villus height and

surface area. The structural composition of the small and large intestinal mucosa expressed as mucosal 
DNA concentration did not change from baseline in any of the treatment groups. Despite attempts to 
conduct 72-hr nutrient absorption tests in 6 selected sites at baseline, dosing week 8 and at the end-
of-study, reliable data supporting a beneficial effect of teduglutide on nutrient absorption is not 
available from this phase 3 study.
Exploratory outcomes:
No statistically significant differences were noted for i.v. catheter access associated with infusion of PN 
among treatment groups at Baseline, Dosing Week 24 and Last Dose Visit.
There were no statistically significant changes in bone mineral density (BMD) of spine and whole body. 
For the whole body bone mineral content (BMC), a statistically significant increase was observed for 
the mean difference between placebo and 0.10 mg/kg/day teduglutide treatment groups (p= 0.046)
No statistically significant changes in mean change from baseline (SD) in serum PTH (pg/ml) was 
observed for teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/day and 0.10 mg/kg/day vs. placebo.
No effect on quality of life was detected by use of the SF-36 health survey, EuroQoL EQ-5D and the 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) after 24 weeks treatment with teduglutide. It is 
acknowledged that these questionnaires have not been developed for assessment of QoL in patients 
with SBS, and that disease specific questionnaires were not available, when the study was conducted. 
Considering the low numbers of patients included in each treatment group in addition to the 
heterogeneity in symptoms in between SBS patients, it is conceded that these tools may not have 
been appropriately sensitive to catch any potential difference. 
As study CL0600-004 was not a fully satisfying study, unable to provide confirmatory evidence of 
efficacy, the applicant subsequently performed a new confirmatory study, CL0600-020, testing the 
dose of teduglutide which in the exploratory analysis of study CL0600-004 was found to be effective.
Study CL0600-020: A 24-Week Study of the Efficacy and Safety of 
Teduglutide in Subjects with Parenteral Nutrition-Dependent Short Bowel 
Syndrome. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
study.
Methods
Study Participants
A relevant adult study population with SBS due to the most common causes of SBS (surgical resections 
due to Crohn´s disease, cancer, vascular insufficiency and volvulus) was included in the study. SBS 
patients with possible fluctuating activity in the disease (due to radiation therapy, active crohn´s 
disease etc.) were excluded. Patients had to be dependent on PN at least 3 times weekly for at least 12 
months. Prior to randomisation to study treatment, patients had to be stable in their disease for the 
past 4 weeks.
The inclusion criteria are largely comparable to those of study -004 with the following exceptions:
1. Stability of PN defined as:
 Actual PN/IV usage should match prescribed PN/IV 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 50/105
 Baseline (V2) 48-hour oral fluid intake and urine output (I/O) volumes should 
fall within ±25% of the respective 48-hour I/O volumes at the time subject is 
optimized and enters stabilization. (See Section 3 for detailed explanation.) 
 Urine output volume should NOT fall below 2 L and not exceed 4 L per 48 hours 
when the subject completes the optimization and stabilization periods 
2. Body mass index (BMI) ≥15 kg/m2 
3. Adequate hepatic and renal function: 
 Total bilirubin < 2xULN 
 Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) < 5xULN 
 Serum creatinine < 2xULN 
The main exclusion criteria include the following:

History  of  cancer  or  clinically  significant  lymphoproliferative  disease  with  fewer  than  5  years 
documented  disease-free  state.  (resected  cutaneous  basal  or  squamous  cell  carcinoma,  or  in 
situ non-aggressive and surgically resected cancer excluded)
 More  than  4  SBS-related  or  PN-related  hospital  admissions  (eg.,  catheter  sepsis,  bowel 
obstruction, severe water-electrolytes disturbances) within 12 months prior to screening visit 


Treatments
The study design is presented in Figure 9-1. 
Stage 1 included screening, optimization, and stabilization periods. At screening, if the subject did not 
have a stable PN/i.v. volume as indicated by a targeted urine output of 1.0-2.0 L/day, the subject was 
to enter an optimization period (8 weeks maximum) to find the subject’s minimally tolerated stable 
volume of PN/i.v. Prior to randomization, all subjects were to undergo a stabilization period on that 
volume of PN/i.v. that was to last 4 weeks minimum and 8 weeks maximum. The 48-hour oral fluid 
intake and urinary output (I/O) volumes measured before the visit when the subject was deemed

Page 52/105
stable would contribute to the determination of stability. Once the subjects had demonstrated PN/i.v. 
volume stability for 4 to 8 weeks, Stage 2 of the study began with baseline assessments of hydration 
and nutritional status. Eighty-six subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups: 
0.05 mg/kg/day teduglutide or placebo.
All subjects who completed the study had the option to continue taking teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/day for 
up to 2 years in a long-term safety study (CL0600-021). The clinical duration of the study was 26 
months. 
Teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/day or placebo was administered by the s.c. route once daily into one of the 
four quadrants of the abdomen or either thigh, for 24 weeks. Matching placebo, for s.c. injection, was 
provided as a lyophilized powder containing L-histidine, mannitol, monobasic and dibasic sodium 
phosphate (as for teduglutide) that was to be reconstituted using 0.5 mL sterile water for injection, 
and administered immediately. As no generally accepted or licensed medical treatment exist for SBS, 
the use of placebo is considered acceptable.
The dose of teduglutide selected for this study was based on the efficacy and safety results of the prior 
clinical Study CL0600-004. Teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg or placebo was administered once daily by SC 
injection into 1 of the 4 quadrants of the abdomen or into either thigh or arm, for the 24 weeks of 
Stage 2. The dose was administered at approximately the same time each day. If a subject forgot to 
administer drug, that daily dose was to be administered as soon as possible, even if this was later in 
the day or evening. However, consecutive doses were to be separated by at least 12 hours. The 
investigator was responsible for contacting the sponsor or designee prior to interrupting the subject’s 
daily study drug dosing regimen. A single discontinuation period of study drug was not to exceed 10 
consecutive days. Dosage interruptions of study drug for a maximum of 21 days total during the entire 
24 weeks were permitted.
Objectives
The objectives of this clinical study were to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of teduglutide 
compared with placebo in SBS subjects dependent on parenteral support (PN and/or i.v. fluids). 
Subject’s qualify of life (QoL) was evaluated by using a newly developed subject-reported outcome 
SBS-specific QoL questionnaire.
Outcomes/endpoints
Efficacy
The primary efficacy variable was the percentage of subjects who demonstrated a response at Week 
20 and who maintained that response through Week 24. A response was defined as the achievement of 
at least a 20% reduction from Baseline (Visit 2) in weekly PN volume.
The secondary efficacy variables were based on reductions in PN/i.v. volume or the direct effects of 
improved intestinal absorption of fluid. The variables include among others: duration of response (ie., 
total number of weeks at ≥ 20% reduction from Baseline); the proportion of subjects with a ≥ 20% 
reduction or a ≥ 2 liter (L) reduction from Baseline in weekly PN at Week 20 and maintained through 
Week 24; the number of subjects who stopped PN and time of discontinuation; and absolute change 
and percent change in PN between Baseline and last dosing visit. 
An additional secondary efficacy variable was an ordered categorical (or graded) response that 
accounts for both intensity and duration of the response at the end of the 24-week treatment period. 
The intensity of the response relied on a reduction from Baseline in weekly PN volume at a minimum of 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 53/105
20% and a maximum of 100%. Duration of the response incorporated responses at Weeks 16 through 
20 and at Weeks 20 through 24. 
Quality of Life
Subjects’ quality of life (QoL) have been evaluated by using a subject-reported outcome SBS specific 
QoL scale. It is agreed that QoL is an important secondary endpoint. Previously, generally accepted 
and validated QoL instruments specifically for this condition has not been available. Consequently, the 
sponsor has developed an instrument (SBS-QoL™) specifically designed to measure QoL in short bowel 
syndrome. The development appears to adhere to generally accepted criteria in this field and the 
instrument has been validated. The use of SBS-QoL™ is considered acceptable. 
Safety
Adverse events, 12-lead ECG, vital signs, laboratory safety data, antibodies to teduglutide and/or E. 
coli protein (ECP), and changes in urine output and body weight were evaluated.
Sample size
Samples size calculations were based on the primary efficacy endpoint. Eighty-six subjects were 
randomized at a 1:1 ratio to detect a difference in responder rates between teduglutide and placebo 
groups of 35% and 6%, respectively, α alpha=0.05, 2-sided test and power=90%. Grounded on these 
assumptions, nQuery Advisor (v. 6.0) based on a Fisher’s Exact Test was used to calculate the power. 
The sample size calculations are considered acceptable.
Randomisation
Acceptable methods for randomisation were applied. 86 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio via the 
interactive voice response system (IVRS) or interactive web response system (IWRS). The 
randomization was stratified at 2 levels of baseline PN/i.v. volume (≤6 L/week or >6 L/week). Subjects 
were randomized across centers rather than within centers. 
Blinding (masking)
Study drug was administered in a double-blind fashion during the 24 weeks that constituted the dosing 
period in Stage 2. Every effort was made to maintain the blinding of this clinical study.  Teduglutide 
and placebo were identical in appearance. The study center personnel, the sponsor, and all personnel 
associated with the monitoring or data management for the clinical study were blinded to the 
treatment assignment. However since the test drug may induce visible changes in the appearance of 
the intestinal mucosa, patients with jejunostomy/ileostomy may be aware of what kind of the 
treatment they receive. While the effect on objective endpoints may be minimal, an effect on 
subjective endpoints cannot be ruled out.
Statistical methods
The analysis populations used in this study were the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, the Safety 
population, and the per protocol (PP) population. The ITT population included all subjects who were 
randomized into the study. This was the primary study population from which efficacy claims were 
made. All efficacy analyses were conducted on this study population. Subjects were included in the 
treatment group to which they were randomized, regardless of the actual drug they received.
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 54/105
The Safety population included all subjects in the ITT population who received at least one dose of 
double-blind study drug. For reporting purposes, these subjects were included in the treatment group 
reflective of the treatment they actually received. All safety analyses were conducted on this 
population, unless otherwise specified. The PP population included all subjects in the ITT population 
who completed this study without any major protocol violations. 
The number and percentage of responders (20 to100% reduction in PN/i.v. volume) were presented by 
treatment group. The analysis compared the event rates for the two treatment groups using the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test statistics adjusted for the randomization stratification variable 
(≤6 or >6 L/week of PN at baseline). The percent and absolute change in PN/i.v. volume from baseline 
to the last dosing visit, as well as all scheduled visits starting at Week 4, are presented by treatment 
group using descriptive statistics. Treatment group differences were compared using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model with effects for treatment and baseline PN volume, with the potential for 
the interaction of the two variables also included as an effect. The least squares means and standard 
error, along with 95% CIs, are presented for each treatment. 
Duration of response
The duration of response based on the number of consecutive visits (categorized as 0, 1, 2, and ≥3) 
for which the subject had a 20 to 100% reduction in weekly PN/i.v. volume from baseline at Week 24 
plus previous scheduled visits with a 20 to 100% reduction from baseline were presented based upon 
the number and percentage of subjects for each category. The two treatment groups were compared 
using extended CMH test statistics (with standardized mid-ranks) adjusted for the randomization 
stratification variable.
Graded response: The number and percentage of subjects’ individual graded response categories were 
presented by treatment group. No statistical testing was performed for these individual items. The 
number and percentage of subjects with each level of the graded (or ordered categorical) response 
were presented by treatment group. The analysis compared the graded response categories for the 
two treatment groups using extended CMH test statistics (with standardized mid-ranks) adjusted for 
the randomization stratification variable.
Missing data
All subjects in the analysis population were included in the associated analyses, except where specified 
in select sensitivity analyses. Comprehensive and acceptable rules for handling missing data were 
defined and a number of pre-specified sensitivity analyses were performed using different ways of 
handling missing data.
In general, the statistical methods are considered acceptable.

Recruitment
The study has been conducted from November 2008 to January 2011 at 27 sites in 10 countries (USA 
6, Canada 4, Poland 4, Germany 2, Italy 3, France 2, Spain 2, United Kingdom 2, Denmark 1, 
Netherlands 1). The first subject was enrolled on 25 November 2008, and the last subject, last visit 
was on 04 January 2011.
Conduct of the study
The vast majority of protocol violations are deemed to be of minor significance and not to have had 
any significant impact on the results of the study. In total 11 patients deviated so much from the 
protocol that they were excluded from the PP analysis. Relative to the total number patients 
randomised, this is considered acceptable.
Baseline data
The groups were well balanced in terms of demographics. The majority of subjects enrolled in this 
study were Caucasian (83/86 subjects, 96.5%), between 45 and 65 years of age (mean age 50.3 
years), and 13/86 (15.1%) of subjects were ≥65 years of age. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 82 
years. The distribution of participating males and females was 40/86 (46.5%) male and 46/86 (53.5%) 
female. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in any of the 
demographic and baseline characteristics at baseline.
The SBS history for the Safety population is summarized in Table 11-2. 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 56/105
The most prevalent causes for major intestinal resection were vascular disease (29/85 subjects, 
34.1%), Crohn’s (18/85 subjects, 21.2%) or “other” reason (18/85 subjects, 21.2%). Stoma was 
present in 38/85 subjects (44.7%), with the most common types being jejunostomy/ileostomy (31/38 
subjects, 81.6%). The mean length ±SD of the remaining small intestine was 77.3±64.4 cm (range: 5 
to 343 cm). Subjects in the teduglutide group had a numerically greater length of small intestine (86.2 
cm) than the placebo group (68.7 cm).There appeared to be at least a numerical difference between 
groups as regards fraction of patients with ileostomy and jejunostomy. Thus the placebo group had a 
higher frequency of ileostomy/lower frequency of jejunostomy compared to the teduglutide group. 
However as groups were well balanced in terms of baseline PN/i.v. requirements and length of 
remaining small intestine, this imbalance is not considered to have had any significant effect on 
results.
Numbers analysed

Assessment report 
Page 57/105
A total of 136 subject numbers were assigned in this study. However, 4 subjects were screened twice, 
i.e., under two separate subject numbers, thus only 132 unique subjects were screened for 
participation in this study. 86 suitable subjects have been identified after screening and no subject was 
randomized more than once. Of the remaining 46 subjects, 34 subjects were considered screen 
failures. The 12 additional subjects were eligible for randomization. However, because randomization 
had been completed they were allowed to directly enter the long-term safety study (CL0600-021). Of 
the 86 subjects randomized, 78 completed the study and 8 discontinued from the study during the 
dosing period, including 1 subject who was randomized but not dosed.
Outcomes and estimation
Primary efficacy results
The primary efficacy variable was the responder rate as previously defined. The number and 
percentage of responders in the ITT population is presented by treatment group in Table 11-6. Results 
were similar in the PP population (p<0.001).
Efficacy was maintained across a number of different sub groups (male/female, different age groups). 
For subjects both without colon-in-continuity and in those with colon-in-continuity, the responder rate 
was higher in the teduglutide group, 13/17 subjects (76.5%) and 14/26 subjects (53.8%), 
respectively, compared with 4/20 subjects (20.0%) and 9/23 subjects (39.1%), respectively, in the 
placebo group. The teduglutide responder rate was higher for subjects without colon-in-continuity 
(13/17 subjects, 76.5%) than for subjects with colon-in-continuity (14/26 subjects, 53.8%).
For subjects both with stoma as well as in those without stoma, the responder rate was higher in the 
teduglutide group (15/21 subjects, 71.4% and 12/22 subjects, 54.5%, respectively) than in the 
placebo group (3/17 subjects, 17.6% and 10/26 subjects, 38.5%, respectively).  The teduglutide 
responder rate was higher for subjects with stoma (15/21 subjects, 71.4%) than without stoma (12/22 
subjects, 54.5%). For subjects without an ileocecal valve, the results were similar to the overall 
population, with the higher response rate seen in the teduglutide group (27/40 subjects, 67.5%), 
compared with the placebo group (8/33 subjects, 24.2%). However, the low number of subjects with 
an ileocecal valve makes interpretation of these results uncertain.
Additional analyses to support the primary analysis
A number of sensitivity analyses were performed and these demonstrated that the results were not 
influenced by different rules for exclusion of patients depending on the completeness of data. Even in 
the “worst case scenario” where all patients with any missing data where regarded as “non-
responders”, teduglutide was superior to placebo.   
Secondary efficacy results
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 58/105
Percent and absolute change in PN/i.v. volume from baseline to last dosing visit
At all visits, change from baseline in actual PN/i.v. volume was greater in the teduglutide group than in 
the placebo group. 
The absolute change from baseline in teduglutide was about twice that of placebo at all visits. At Week 
24, the mean reduction in the teduglutide group was 4.4 L/week from a baseline of 12.9 L/week and in 
the placebo group was 2.3 L/week from a baseline of 13.2 L/week. The percentage change in actual 
PN/i.v. reduction volume at Week 24 was 32% compared with 21%.
The difference in absolute change between the treatment groups was statistically significant at Week 8 
(p=0.011) and remained significant through Week 24 (p<0.001). The difference in percent change 
between the treatment groups was significant at Week 12 (p=0.028) and remained significant through 
Week 24 (p=0.030). The PP population analyses were consistent with the ITT population analyses. 
Analyses across subgroups yielded results similar to those obtained for the primary endpoint.
Duration of response (number of consecutive visits)
The time to achieve and maintain responder status was significantly shorter in the teduglutide group 
than in the placebo group. The percentage of subjects with a duration of response for ≥3 consecutive 
visits was higher in the teduglutide group (24/43 subjects, 55.8%) than in the placebo group (12/43 
subjects, 27.9%).
Response based on a 20 to 100% or 2 liter reduction in PN/i.v. volume from baseline
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 59/105
The proportion of subjects with a 20 to 100% reduction or a 2 L reduction in PN/i.v. volume at Weeks 
20 and 24 was higher in the teduglutide group (30/43 subjects, 69.8%) than in the placebo group 
(16/43 subjects, 37.2%,). This was statistically significant (p=0.002) between the treatment groups. 
Similar results were seen for the PP population (p<0.001). 
While oral intake in subjects on teduglutide was generally unchanged during the trial, subjects on 
placebo increased oral intake by approximately 1.5 L/week.
Subjects who stopped PN/i.v. and the time of stopping
No subjects had been weaned off PN/i.v. as of Week 20. There was only one subject (0209-1002) in 
the placebo group who had stopped PN/i.v. during the 14 days prior to Week 24 according to the e-
diary. This subject was not considered successful in weaning off PN/i.v. infusion since PN/i.v. was only 
temporarily interrupted due to hospitalization and catheter replacement.
Graded response
The graded response score was higher in the teduglutide group than in the placebo group (p=0.004). 
Similar differences between treatment groups were present in the PP population. The so-called graded 
response is an attempt to combine duration of response and magnitude of response. 
The results of the secondary efficacy analyses generally support the primary efficacy analysis. 
Complete avoidance of PN/I.V. fluid would indeed constitute a clinically relevant effect. None of the 
subjects in the present study could be weaned off PN/I.V. fluid.
Exploratory Variables
Logistic regression of the primary efficacy parameter
Logistic regression analysis was performed on the binary primary efficacy parameter utilizing the 
baseline PN/i.v. volume as a covariate. The results were consistent with the primary analysis 
(p=0.002).
Reduction in days of PN/i.v. volume per week
The percentage of subjects with at least a 1-day reduction in weekly actual PN/i.v. use at Week 24 was 
statistically significantly higher in the teduglutide group (21/39 subjects, 53.8%) than in the placebo 
group (9/39 subjects, 23.1%). As one or more days without having to be chained to an i.v. line 
constitutes a real benefit for the patient, this difference support the clinical relevance of the observed 
effect. 
Reduction from baseline of 20 to 100% in prescribed weekly PN/I.V.
The proportion of responders in the teduglutide group (27/43 subjects, 62.8%) was higher than in the 
placebo group (16/43 subjects, 37.2%). These results support the responder conclusions based on the 
actual PN/i.v. data.
Absolute and percent change in prescribed PN/i.v. volume
At all visits, change from baseline (both absolute and percentage [%]) in prescribed PN/i.v. volume 
was greater in the teduglutide group than in the placebo group. The absolute change from baseline in 
the teduglutide group was about twice of that in the placebo group at all visits. 
Fluid composite effect
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 60/105
At all visits, greater reduction in fluid composite effect was seen in the teduglutide group than in the 
placebo group. At Week 24, the mean reduction in the teduglutide group was 5.4 L/week, as compared 
with 1.1 L/week in the placebo group. The fluid composite effect (defined as PN/i.v. volume + volume 
of oral intake minus urine volume) is an indirect measure of the loss of fluid trough the intestine 
(assuming that other sources of fluid production/fluid loss, such as perspiration and water generated 
through metabolism remains constant) and as such a valuable parameter to judge the 
pharmacodynamic effect of teduglutide. As presented above the average weekly fluid composite effect 
was reduced. This supports the results of the primary efficacy analysis in terms of efficacy 
Change from baseline in plasma citrulline
In the teduglutide group, the mean change in plasma citrulline from baseline (18.4 μmol/L ± 9.5) was 
20.6 μmol/L (±17.5) at Week 24. The corresponding Week 24 change from baseline (17.5 μmol/L ± 
9.0) for subjects on placebo was 0.7 μmol/L (±6.3).
Quality of Life Assessment
Health-related QoL was assessed in study CL0600-020 using a subject-reported SBS-specific QoL scale 
(SBS-QoL™) which was particularly designed and developed to measure treatment induced QoL 
changes over time. The study did not show statistically significant QoL differences between the 
teduglutide and the placebo group after 24 weeks treatment in this heterogeneous population. Thus, 
there is no evidence that teduglutide, compared to placebo, has any significantly positive effect on 
overall QoL and consequently this parameter cannot support clinical relevance of the primary endpoint 
either. However, it should be noted that the change in single SBS-QoL items from baseline to 
evaluation at Week 24 was numerically larger and in many instances statistically significant in patients 
treated with teduglutide (9/17 items) as compared to placebo patients (1/17 items).

Primary Analysis
All following results are based on the ITT population. PP evaluations – if 
performed – were in accordance with these results. Due to the number of 
comparisons a step-down procedure was chosen to account for multiple 
comparisons. The high-dose group was to be compared to placebo first, 
followed by the comparison of the low-dose group, if the first comparison 
was statistically significant.

Randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
multinational, multicenter, 2-stage study. Subjects were randomized to either 
teduglutide or placebo (1:1).
Stage 1 included a screening visit; an optimization period, if needed, of a 
maximum of 8 weeks, and a stabilization period that demonstrated stable 
administration of parenteral nutrition/intravenous (PN/I.V.) volume for a 
minimum of 4 weeks up to a maximum of 8 weeks.

The primary efficacy variable was the percentage of subjects who 
demonstrate a response at Week 20 and who maintain that response through 
Week 24.  A response was defined as the achievement of at least a 20% 
reduction from baseline in weekly PN volume.  The study was designed to 
detect a higher responder rate among subjects randomized to teduglutide.

Quality

According to literature, plasma citrulline levels are 
correlated to small bowel length and to net digestive 
absorption of fat in untreated SBS patients. 
Therefore, plasma citrulline was evaluated as a 
potential pharmacodynamic marker to assess 
absorptive enterocyte mass.
The effect of the SBS-QoL™ Baseline value, 
treatment and PN volume reduction on the change 
of subjects’ QoL from Baseline to Week 24 was 
investigated within an ANCOVA model, and the 
change in QoL was considered as dependent 
variable.

The number of visits is based on consecutive visits at Week 24 and 
scheduled previous visits, where a value of 0 visits represents no response 
at Week 24 or no visit conducted at Week 24.  This parameter is the third of 
the six secondary parameters which were scheduled to be evaluated as part 
of a step-down testing procedure.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)
A recommendation to evaluate the treatment effect after 6 months and stop the treatment if no effect 
is seen has been considered, along with proper justification including proposals for measurements to 
be implemented to assess whether a patient should be allowed to continue or stop the treatment. To 
this end, combined analysis of study CL0600-020 and its prolongation study, CL0600-021, show that in 
the time period up to 6 months after initiating treatment there is a gradual increase in the number of 
patients achieving the primary endpoint. After that time point only few additional patients achieve the 
primary endpoint. Thus the proposal to evaluate efficacy after 6 months is supported. It is agreed that 
defining a general realistic goal for treatment applicable to all patients is neither realistic nor desirable. 
Thus a more general approach has been considered and reported in the SmPC in section 4.2

Supportive study(ies)
Study CL0600-005 was a double-blind 28-week extension study to the study CL0600-004, and was 
designed as a randomized, parallel-group, multinational, multicenter study. This supportive study had 
the objective to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of teduglutide. 
Only patients who completed study CL0600-004 were eligible for the study CL0600-005. In total, 65 of 
the 71 patients who had completed the study CL0600-004 were enrolled. Only 6 patients (2 from each 
arm in study CL0600-004) decided not to continue into study CL0600-005. The patients from the 
active treatment arms maintained their treatment regimen. The previous placebo patients were 
randomized to receive 0.05 or 0.10 mg/kg/day of teduglutide. The patients who completed the 28-
week dosing period of the study CL0600-005 entered a 4-week non-dosing follow-up period. 
5/25 (20%) patients in the 0.05/0.05 group and 4/27 (14.8%) of the 0.10/0.10 group discontinued. 
There were 0/6 and 1/7 discontinuations in the placebo/0.05 and the placebo/0.10group, respectively.
54 of the 71 patients completed study CL0600-005.
In the extension study the imbalance due to the cause of intestinal resection is preserved. There were 
28% of patients with stoma in the 0.05/0.05 group (hereof 57.1% with jejunostomy) and 37% of 
patients with stoma in the 0.10/0.10 group (hereof 60% with ileostomy). Four patients in the 
0.05/0.05 group (16%) had a terminal ileum (all with ileocecal valve) and 6 patients in the 0.10/0.10 
group (22.2%)  (thereof 3 with ileocecal valve). The difference between groups of patients with colon 
in continuity was less compared to study 0600-004 (76% in the 0.05/0.05 group and 66.7% in the 
0.10/0.10 group) 
The main efficacy results according to the binary endpoint are shown in the following table:

As can be seen, 25% of the responders during study 004 became non-responders at the end of study 
005. However, the applicant claims that these were not efficacy related non-response, but other 
reasons which are given in the study report as lost diary, moved to a different country, AE (one 
hyperplastic colon polyp and one due to abdominal pain and vomiting), and temporary PN increase due 
to infection.
One subject on the 0.05/0.05 group additionally was completely weaned off PN.
The number and percentage of subjects with an at least one day reduction from baseline weekly PN 
use is given in the following table:

The changes seen in the summary of the PN energy needs and the reductions in PN volume were 
substantial in the different groups. 
The study report further states a 60% and 42% reduction in the i.v. catheter access at week 28 in the 
0.05/0.05 and 0.10/0.10 groups, and a 50% and 17% reduction in the placebo/0.05 and placebo/0.10 
groups.
Quality of Life data indicated no systematic improvement in QoL scores.
Study CL0600-021 was designed as a long-term, open-label study. The study is still ongoing. An 
interim analysis of the results is presented here. The interim analysis was not planned per the 
currently approved protocol version. This interim analysis was prepared to evaluate the long-term 
safety data to support a marketing application review. The data presented represent information 
collected at completed visits from 21 September 2009 (first subject enrolled) through data cut-off on 
30 June 2011.
There were 2 subject populations in this study: 1) subjects already exposed to active treatment with 
teduglutide for 24 weeks in Study CL0600-020 (called TED/TED group, N=37);  2) subjects not treated 
or treated with placebo (called NT, PBO/TED group, N=51) in Study CL0600-020.
As this is an ongoing trial, efficacy data in this report represent information collected at completed 
visits in the first 6 months (through Visit 6 of this extension study), which the majority of subjects 
have completed. 
In the TED/TED Group, the response to teduglutide observed during 24 weeks of treatment in Study 
CL0600-020 was maintained in the TED/TED group during continued, long-term treatment in this 
interim reporting period of the extension study. After an additional 6 months of treatment with 
teduglutide, the mean reduction was 5.16 L/week from a baseline level of 12.76 L/week, with a mean 
reduction of 34.18%. In the NT, PBO/TED Group Teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/day also showed signs of 
efficacy in subjects who had not received previous treatment with teduglutide in Study CL0600-020, 
with reductions from baseline in mean absolute PN/i.v. volume observed at every visit. After 6 months 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 72/105
of treatment, the mean reduction in absolute PN/i.v. volume in the NT, PBO/TED group was 2.19 
L/week from a baseline level of 11.97 L/week, with a mean reduction of 17.60% (Table 11-6).

Although observations in the subgroup analyses were limited due to the nature of the interim reporting 
in an ongoing trial, the observations in the subgroups examined supported the findings regarding 
reductions in weekly PN/i.v. volume in the overall population. 
After  6  months  of  treatment,  31  of  34  subjects  (91.2%)  in  the  TED/TED  group  had  a  20  to  100% 
decrease  from  baseline  in  weekly  PN/i.v.  volume  and  17  of  43  subjects  (39.5%)  in  the  NT,  PBO/TED 
group had a 20 to 100% decrease from baseline in weekly PN/i.v.

Three subjects were weaned from PN/i.v. and at month 6 visit 18 of 34 (52.9%) subjects in the 
TED/TED group achieved at least a 1 day reduction in the number of days on PN/i.v. The corresponding 
numbers were 10 of 43 (23.3%) subjects in the NT, PBO/TED group.
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 75/105
Due to the nature of the study (open label extension study in patients who completed the placebo-
controlled part), selection of patients based on previous response both in terms of efficacy and safety 
has occurred. The TED/TED group has an overrepresentation of subjects who tolerate teduglutide and 
has experienced a positive effect of the drug. The NT, PBO/TED group has not experienced this 
selection during the previous placebo controlled trial and the subjects in this group are more likely to 
report safety problems and lack of effect. Thus the two groups are not comparable in terms of safety 
and efficacy. While the present study can provide knowledge about the persistence of effect and the 
safety after extended duration of exposure, results must be interpreted with great caution, especially 
as concerns the magnitude of the effect observed and the clinical relevance of the observed effect.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
Design and conduct of clinical studies
The applicant originally submitted one pivotal study in this proposed orphan indication. A dose-finding 
study was conducted before this pivotal study, supporting only a vague dose-response relationship, 
based on selected pharmacodynamic effects. Based on this information, two final doses were chosen to 
be investigated in phase III.
The initial pivotal efficacy study (study CL0600-004) was conducted in USA, Canada and Europe, as a 
multicenter double-blind study. The overall design of the study can be considered to be appropriate, 
with a careful selection of patients, including an optimisation and a run-in period, in order to exclude 
ongoing adaptation to the short-bowel state. 
The difficulties related to blinding of treatment due to the stomal swelling induced by teduglutide 
treatment have been acknowledged. The use of third party blinded to the treatment assignment, for 
collection and assessment of study results has been appreciated.  However full blinding of the study 
appears to be questionable, at least in patients with a stoma where the pharmacodynamic effect 
(mucosal hyperplasia seen as swelling) could easily be detected. The applicant subsequently provided 
evidence to support that accidental unblinding, albeit not completely ruled out, is not likely to have had 
any major effect of the assessment of efficacy and safety. However, unblinding could of course have an 
influence on the assessment of some of the secondary endpoints, namely the Quality of Life (QoL) 
parameters.
The study was conducted within a reasonable time-frame considering the rareness of the disease, and 
has obviously been conducted in experienced centres, both in Europe and North America. No GCP 
violations have become obvious.
The initially planned primary endpoint - a dichotomous responder criterion (“number and percentage of 
subjects who demonstrated a response ≥20% reduction from baseline in weekly PN volume at Week 
20 maintained at Week 24”) was exchanged with an ordered categorical (graded) criterion accounting 
for both duration (weeks 16 and 20 and weeks 20 and 24) and intensity of response (>20% to 100% 
reduction in weekly PN volume). This amendment was implemented late during the conduct of the 
study (February 2007; the last patient completed the study in July 2007) after an independent review 
of the protocol. The CHMP noted that the graded response used for scoring of patients is not validated 
and of unclear clinical relevance. Regarding endpoints, however, the studies still included a chance to 
appropriately assess a benefit for the patients with the 1-day reduction of PN need endpoint, as well as 
with the Quality of Life, and the healthcare utilisation data/measurements. 
The overall design of the phase 3 study CL0600-020 is acceptable. The use of an optimisation and 
stabilisation period is considered acceptable and necessary in order to minimise variability in this 
inherently variable condition. As there are no licensed treatment options available for this condition, 
the choice of placebo as comparator is also supported. Duration of study (6 months) is considered the 
minimally acceptable and data supporting long term (beyond 6 months) safety is needed. In that 
respect, the extension study CL0600-021 could be sufficient. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
extensive but acceptable. 
There are no generally accepted efficacy parameters in the field of SBS. In the present study primary 
and secondary endpoints are largely based on changes in the volume of fluid administered parentally 
(“PN/IV volume”). Overall this is acceptable, however in order to make the results reliable, stringent, 
objective algorithms (and adherence to these) for investigator decision on when and how to 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 77/105
reduce/increase PN/i.v. volume is critical. Based on the protocol such algorithms were in place and are 
considered acceptable. The secondary efficacy endpoints are generally acceptable. 
It is agreed that QoL is an important secondary endpoint. Previously, generally accepted and validate 
QoL instruments specifically for this condition has not been available. Consequently, the applicant has 
developed an instrument (SBS-QoL™) specifically designed to measure QoL in short bowel syndrome. 
The development appears to adhere to generally accepted criteria in this field and the instrument has 
been validated. The use of SBS-QoL™ is considered acceptable.
In general, sample size calculations, randomisation procedures and statistical methods are considered 
acceptable
Efficacy data and additional analyses
In study CL0600-004 results demonstrated that there was no statistical significant difference between 
teduglutide 0.1mg/kg/d vs. placebo in the graded response score (p=0.161), but a further analysis of 
the 0.05 mg/Kg/day dose evidenced promising results, which could have only  been  considered for 
hypothesis generation and for dose finding. Indeed, the results of the exploratory analyses of study 
CL0600-004 indicated that 0.05 mg/kg/day of teduglutide significantly reduced volume of PN/i.v. in 
SBS. Consequently the applicant performed a new phase 3 study (CL0600-020) intended to provide 
confirmatory evidence of the safety and efficacy of teduglutide administered at the dose of 0.05 
mg/kg/day.
Study CL0600-020 demonstrated that compared to placebo, teduglutide had statistically significant 
effect on the primary efficacy parameter, 20% or greater reduction in volume of PN/i.v. at weeks 20 
and 24. The results were robust and confirmed in a number of sensitivity analyses. Considering the 
strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and the inherent diversity of the target population, the relative large 
number of screened patients compared to the relative small number of patients randomised is 
understandable and acceptable. A large fraction of patients randomised did ultimately complete the 
study and the study groups were well balanced in terms of discontinuations. Indeed, the effect was 
observed across a number of subgroups such as male/females, age groups, stoma/no stoma and 
colon-in-continuity/colon-not-in-continuity. The secondary endpoints generally supported the primary 
endpoint. Compared to placebo, teduglutide had superior effect after 8 to 12 weeks. Duration of effect 
was also superior in teduglutide treated patients compared to placebo treated patients. Thus, the 
present study has demonstrated that teduglutide does reduce the need for PN/i.v. in SBS. 
Complete avoidance of PN/I.V. fluid would constitute a clinically relevant effect. However, none of the 
subjects in the CL0600-020 study could be weaned off PN/i.v. fluid. In the present setting complete 
weaning off does not seem realistic. In a less severe population, complete weaning off PN/i.v. could be 
feasible, but this would on the other hand raise the question of the appropriateness of treating such 
less severe patients. In the present setting with patients with a very short segment of remaining 
intestine and a substantial requirement for PN/i.v. other clinically relevant endpoints, short of complete 
weaning off PN/I.V. have been defined by the applicant. The primary efficacy endpoint (percentage of 
patients who achieve a 20% or greater reduction in weekly PN/IV volume at week 20 and 24) proposed 
by the applicant was considered clinically relevant by a group of experts in the field. Moreover, the 
clinical relevance of the observed effect was also backed by the positive effect on the exploratory 
endpoint “reduction in number of days with PN/i.v.”. One or more days without having to be chained to 
an i.v. line constitutes a real benefit for the patient. Another way of supporting the clinical relevance of 
the observed effect is to demonstrate that patient satisfaction/QoL is improved. In the present study 
with the instrument applied (SBS-QoL™) it was not possible to demonstrate any significant difference 
in QoL between placebo and teduglutide treated patients. The lack of effect on this secondary endpoint 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 78/105
was considered to be related to the heterogeneity of the study population as well as the lack of 
sensitivity of the QoL instrument used. Thus the lack of effect on this endpoint was not considered to 
undermine the clinical relevance of the observed effect on reduction in PN/i.v. volume.
Study CL0600-021, a Long-term, Open-label Study with Teduglutide for Subjects with Parenteral 
Nutrition Dependent Short Bowel Syndrome, has been designed to further analyse efficacy of 
Teduglutide treatment and the safety during long term use of the drug. It is acknowledged that this 
study indicates that efficacy of teduglutide is maintained beyond 6 months and for at least 12 months. 
Moreover, the interim report from  study CL0600-021  indicates a high frequency of subjects being 
able to reduce number of days on PN/i.v. by at least 1 day (a clinically relevant benefit for the patient) 
and even a few patients being able to discontinue PN/I.V. altogether (the ultimate goal of treatment). 
This seemingly provides evidence of the clinical relevance of the observed effect. 
Study CL0600-021 is an on-going study at the time of the opinion, designed to monitor the safety, 
tolerability and further prove efficacy (reduction in PN/i.v. volume) for PN/i.v. dependent SBS subjects 
taking Teduglutide. So far only an interim report of the study could be submitted and the study will be 
finalised about December 2012.  Final results of the study are required as post authorisation 
commitment in order to further assess both efficacy and safety of the treatment which could affect the 
benefit/risk balance for the substance. 
Moreover, following a request from the CHMP, the applicant submitted extrapolation of data on long 
term non responders from the on-going long term study CL0600-021, indicating  the ground for 
discontinuation of the Teduglutide treatment if no effects are visible after a defined period of time from 
the beginning of the treatment. Indeed, the number of patients showing a PN volume response 
(defined as at least 20% reduction in PN volume from baseline) is continuously increasing over time, 
reaching more then 70% of patients after 6 months in trial CL0600-020. Thereafter, only a small 
increase is seen in the open extension trial CL0600-021. It seems therefore appropriate to evaluate the 
treatment effect after 6 months, because only very few patients with potential PN volume response 
might stop treatment inappropriately after this point in time. On the other hand, due to the unknown 
long-term risks associated with teduglutide treatment, a life-long treatment without clear signs of 
efficacy is not justified. Thus the proposal to evaluate efficacy after 6 months of treatment (as 
reflected in the SmPC) is supported. It is agreed that defining a general realistic goal for treatment 
applicable to all patients is neither realistic nor desirable. Thus it is agreed that a more general 
assessment by the physician should consider individual treatment objective and patient preferences. 
Treatment should be stopped if no overall improvement of the patient condition is achieved (as 
reflected in the SmPC).
Additional expert consultation
During the procedure at the CHMP’s request an ad-hoc expert group meeting was organized  to provide 
their view on specific issues related to efficacy identified during the assessment. The responses to the 
questions asked to the experts by the CHMP are reproduced below.
Clinical relevance of the results of the clinical trials.
The experts acknowledged that in study CL0600-020 a significant number of patients had at least 1 
day reduction in PN volume per week at week 24. In the combined database of the phase III trials 11 
patients could be weaned off, mostly after 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment (8/11). 
The primary study endpoint of 20% reduction in PN/IV fluid was considered by the experts an 
adequate endpoint for the study; the results in study CL0600-020 were deemed clinically meaningful. 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 79/105
The experts emphasised that the group of SBS patients is heterogeneous (different baseline 
requirements ranging from 3.6 to 34 l/week, different length of remaining bowel, remaining Colon or 
not etc.). In the experts’ opinion the expected benefit, based on the available data, would be for 
patients having low volume requirements to be potentially weaned off, and for patients having high 
volume requirements to have the weekly PN/IV fluid intake reduced. 
Overall, all clinicians as well as the experts including the patient representative were in agreement that 
the shown results are clinically relevant.
The high unmet medical need, the rareness of the disease and the fact that 7 patients were 
weaned off PN/I.V. infusions, but no statistically significant difference between teduglutide 
and placebo as regards fraction of patients being able to reduce PN/I.V. infusions by one 
day for the primary efficacy population (ITT), the observed effect on volume of PN/I.V fluid 
did not have a positive effect on quality of life
In an update to previously presented results, data presented by the applicant during the meeting 
showed that a significant number of patients had at least one day reduction in PN volume per week at 
week 24 in Study CL0600-020.
The experts noted that patients rarely withdrew due to side effects and that the negative overall 
outcome on QoL might be triggered due to the side effect abdominal pain as a result from reducing 
diarrhea and increased bloating. From a patient’s perspective being weaned off for one day needs to be 
weighted against the side effects such as GI pain as well as the need for daily injections.
The experts stressed the methodological challenges in demonstrating QoL in this patient population. In 
this context the expert group acknowledged that due to the heterogeneity of the SBS patients and the 
rarity of the disease it seems not feasible to power a study adequately to get an overall significant 
outcome on the 17 item instrument used in the study. At the same time, the experts were in 
agreement that the instrument used by the applicant was the best possible choice given the current 
scientific knowledge in this disease, and that there is currently no better instrument available. 
Therefore, the experts considered that the positive trend seen in the sub-items needs to be considered 
for the overall evaluation.
Is it possible to identify a subgroup of patients who will benefit from therapy with 
teduglutide: a. patients who may be weaned off PN/I.V.fluid, b. patients needing a high 
volume (> 6 liter per week) of PN/I.V.fluid in whom a 20% reduction in volume would be 
considered a clinical benefit.Considering the rarity and heterogeneity of the disease it was not 
considered useful to define subgroups of patients. The experts advised that patients with higher 
volume requirements can possibly benefit from a significant reduction of PN/I.V. fluid and patients with 
lower requirements might have the chance to be weaned off completely.
Is it possible to identify a subgroup of patients who may benefit from treatment beyond 24 
weeks since some of the few patients who were weaned off PN/IV fluid only achieved that 
clinical status in the extension part of the controlled study.  In that context is it possible to 
set up rules for stopping teduglutide in patients without a clear reduction in volume.The 
expert group noted that there is a high number of late responders to teduglutide after 24 weeks of 
treatment. Taking this late response into consideration as well as safety profile, the experts 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 80/105
recommended to evaluate the treatment effect after 6 to 9 months and stop the treatment if no effect 
is seen. 
The experts stressed that treatment with teduglutide should not be initiated before the patient is 
stabilized after the surgery leading to the condition i.e. after the adaptation period.
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
The results of the provided trial CL0060-004 can only be regarded as hypothesis generating. On the 
other hand, study CL0600-020 clearly demonstrated that, compared to placebo, teduglutide 0.05 
mg/kg/day caused a statistically significant effect. There was a statistically significantly higher fraction 
of teduglutide patients that achieved a 20 % (or greater) reduction in the PN/i.v. volume (primary 
efficacy endpoint) than in the placebo group. The results are robust and the clinical relevance of the 
primary efficacy endpoint is acknowledged; this clinical relevance was also confirmed by an ad-hoc 
expert group. The results of the secondary/exploratory efficacy parameters are considered to overall 
support the clinical relevance of the observed reduction in PN/i.v. volume, even if no statistically 
significant difference between teduglutide and placebo in terms of quality of life or, complete weaning 
off PN/i.v. was observed.
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

Study CL0600-021: A Long-term, Open-label Study with Teduglutide for Subjects with 
Parenteral Nutrition Dependent Short Bowel Syndrome. The applicant should submit the final 
study report of a Long-term, Open-label Study with Teduglutide for Subjects with Parenteral 
Nutrition Dependent Short Bowel Syndrome. Due date: Q4 2013
2.6.  Clinical safety
The primary safety analysis is based on the pooled safety evaluation for all placebo controlled SBS 
studies (CL0600-004 and CL0600-020). It is considered that the specific safety profile of teduglutide is 
best described by the analysis of the placebo controlled SBS studies (CL0600-020 and CL0600-004).
In addition, safety data from phase 2/3 studies in SBS patients has been provided.
Patient exposure
A total of 59 patients were exposed to placebo during the placebo controlled SBS studies with an 
overall placebo exposure of 26.2 person years. A total of 109 patients were exposed to teduglutide 
during the placebo controlled SBS studies; 77 patients to 0.05 mg/kg/day and 32 patients to 0.10 
mg/kg/day, with an overall exposure to teduglutide of 46.5 person years. 
The mean and median exposure time of placebo treated patients (mean (±SD): 23.07 ± 4.46 weeks; 
median: 24 weeks) was similar to that of teduglutide treated patients (mean (±SD): 22.2 ± 6.62 
weeks; median: 24.14 weeks). 
Generally, there were no differences in demographic characteristics between placebo and teduglutide 
dose groups. However, the distribution of the type of stoma was slightly different between the placebo 
and teduglutide groups. More placebo treated patients than teduglutide treated patients had an 
ileostomy (placebo: 10 patients [45.5%]; teduglutide 15 patients [33.3%]), and more teduglutide 
patients than placebo patients had a colostomy (placebo: 1 patient [4.5%]; teduglutide 9 patients 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 81/105
[20.0%]). However, these numerical differences are unlikely to cause imbalances that are relevant for 
safety assessment.
With regard to the additional Phase 2/3 studies in SBS patients, these were studies ALX0600-92001, 
CL0600-004, CL0600-005, CL0600-020 and CL0600-021. A total of 190 SBS patients were exposed to 
teduglutide during the Phase 2/3 SBS studies; 134 patients to 0.05 mg/kg/day and 49 patients to 0.10 
mg/kg/day, with an overall exposure to teduglutide of 143.13 person years. Overall, 92 (48.4%) SBS 
patients were exposed to active treatment for ≥ 48 weeks during the Phase 2/3 SBS studies. The 
mean duration of exposure of all SBS patients exposed to teduglutide was 39.17 weeks.

For  the  pooled  safety  data  of  the  placebo  controlled  SBS  trials  no  exposure  adjustment  was  deemed 
necessary,  because  the  mean  and  median  duration  of  exposure  of  the  teduglutide  (mean  (±SD): 
22.2 ± 6.62  weeks;  median:  24.14  weeks)  and  the  placebo  treated  patients  (mean  (±SD): 
23.07 ± 4.46 weeks; median: 24 weeks) was very similar.
There were 6 System Organ Classes (SOCs) where the rate of TEAEs was at least 5% or greater in the 
teduglutide group compared with the placebo group.  The SOCs include:

Additional data from phase 2/3 studies in SBS patients
180/190 [94.7%] of the patients treated with teduglutide reported 1897 TEAEs. There were slightly 
less patients who reported TEAEs in the 0.05 mg/kg/day teduglutide group [93.3%] than in the 0.10 
mg/kg/day teduglutide group [98.0%]. This small difference probably cannot be interpreted as dose 
dependence. The majority of TEAEs was mild or moderate in severity in both treatment groups. 
Treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) were reported by 95/190 (50.0%) patients 
treated with teduglutide, reporting a total of 223 TESAEs. No dose dependence of TESAEs could be 
seen between the two teduglutide doses. TESAEs were similar in severity between the different 
teduglutide dose groups.
There is a tendency of ADRs to increase in a dose-dependent manner, with 74 [55.2%] patients 
reporting 180 ADRs in the 0.05 mg/kg/day teduglutide group and 30 [61.2%] patients reporting 109 
ADRs in the 0.10 mg/kg/day teduglutide dose group. However, this tendency was less prominent in the 
Phase 2/3 SBS study pool than in the placebo controlled SBS study pool. Serious ADRs were observed 
in 18 [9.5%] teduglutide treated patients reporting 25 events.
Overall, 28 (14.7%) teduglutide treated patients were reported with a TEAE which led to premature 
discontinuation from the studies. The discontinuation rates in the 0.05 mg/kg/day teduglutide group 
and in the 0.10 mg/kg/day teduglutide dose group were identical at 15.7%.
There were 8 SOCs where the incidence of TEAEs was at least  5% or greater in the teduglutide group 
compared with the placebo group.  The SOCs include:




Endocrine Disorders (teduglutide 0.035 events/year; placebo: 0 events/year)
Hepatobiliary Disorders (teduglutide 0.140 events/year; placebo: 0.076 events/year).
Neoplasms Benign, Malignant And Unspecified (Incl Cysts And Polyps) (teduglutide 0.056 
events/year; placebo: 0 events/year). 
Nervous System Disorders (teduglutide 0.992 events/year; placebo: 0.916 events/year).

Psychiatric Disorders (teduglutide 0.210 events/year; placebo: 0.115 events/year).
Renal And Urinary Disorders (teduglutide 0.321 events/year; placebo: 0.191 events/year).
Skin And Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (teduglutide 0.314 events/year; placebo: 0.267 
events/year).
Vascular Disorders (teduglutide 0.314 events/year; placebo: 0.229 events/year).
For the interpretation of the exposure adjusted data, it is an important observation that the SOC 
Gastrointestinal Disorders does not occur at a higher incidence under teduglutide treatment than under 
placebo treatment. Also General Disorders And Administration Site Conditions and Infections And 
Infestations did not show a higher incidence, as in the analysis of the placebo controlled SBS studies. 
This may be explained by the fact that adverse events in general are often reported at higher 
frequencies shortly after the start of a study. This transient occurrence of TEAEs can for example be 
clearly observed in the case of Gastrointestinal Disorders in teduglutide treated patients. Thus, with 
increasing exposure times, incidences of adverse events tend to equilibrate and it may become 
increasingly difficult to detect safety signals. On the other side, medical conditions which may prevent 
patients from participating in a study may incidentally occur under longer term treatment as adverse 
events (e.g. the SOC Neoplasms Benign, Malignant And Unspecified (Incl Cysts And Polyps)). Under 
these circumstances, a medical condition which occurs incidentally may be noted as an increased 
incidence of adverse events. 
The comparison of the exposure adjusted summary of adverse events in teduglutide treated patients of 
the five phase 2/3 SBS studies with the placebo treated patients from the two placebo controlled SBS 
studies basically confirmed what had been found in the review of the placebo controlled SBS studies 
only. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
Deaths
No deaths occurred during the placebo controlled SBS studies (CL0600-004 and CL0600-020). One 
patient died during the screening period of study CL0600-004, prior to randomization of the patient 
into the study. In the opinion of the Investigator, the patient’s death was due to a massive upper 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage. In the safety follow up study CL0600-021 which is currently ongoing two 
patients died due to cancer  (for causality assessment see relevant chapter “Neoplasia” and 
“Discussion on clinical Safety” below):
Patient […] with lung cancer had a relevant history of smoking (about 30 cigarettes per day for about 
30 years) and was treated with teduglutide only for relatively short time (85 days).
Patient […], a 48-year-old man with a history of Hodgkin’s disease (diagnosed in 1988 and treated with 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy), cecal necrosis caused by radiation, and primary liver disease, was 
diagnosed with a metastatic adenocarcinoma 11 months after the start of treatment (treatment start 
date 29 July 2010; onset date of TESAE 19 June 2011). The subject entered the study directly (ie, was 
not treated in Study CL0600-020). Six months prior to starting teduglutide therapy, the subject had 
computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, which showed liver enlargement, without focal lesions. 
The primary tumor was considered to be probably in the GI tract, but its precise location was 
unknown. A biopsy performed on 21 June 2011 revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma. The subject died 
on 29 June 2011, 10 days after the reported onset of this TESAE. An autopsy performed on 01 July 
2011 was inconclusive as to the primary site of the cancer, and the primary cause of death was

generalized malignancy of intestinal cancer. The event was considered by the investigator to be severe 
and related to treatment. The study drug was discontinued.
Other Serious Adverse Events
Pooled safety evaluation for all placebo controlled SBS studies 
There were 2 SOCs where the rate of TESAEs was at least 5% or greater in the teduglutide group 
compared with the placebo group.  The SOCs include:
Gastrointestinal Disorders (7/109 subjects [6.4%] in the teduglutide group vs. no subject [0%] in the 
placebo group).
Infections And Infestations (25/109 subjects [22.9%] in the teduglutide group vs. 10/59 subjects 
[16.9%] in the placebo group). 
Most frequently reported TESAEs on a Preferred Term level were Small Intestinal Obstruction, Pyrexia, 
Cholecystitis Acute, Catheter Sepsis, Catheter Related Infection, Urinary Tract Infection, Central Line 
Infection, Bacteraemia, Device Dislocation, Device Breakage, and Device Malfunction.
Additional data from phase 2/3 studies in SBS patients
There were four SOCs where the rate of TESAEs was at least or larger than 5%. The SOCs include:
 Gastrointestinal Disorders (16/190 subjects [8.4%] reporting 23 TESAEs; incidence: 0.161 
events per year). 
 General Disorders And Administration Site Conditions  (12/190 subjects [6.3%] reporting 14 
TESAEs; incidence: 0.098 events per year). 


Infections And Infestations (55/190 subjects [28.9%] reporting 102 TESAEs; incidence: 0.713 
events per year).
Injury, Poisoning And Procedural Complications (14/190 subjects [7.4%] reporting 17 TESAEs; 
incidence: 0.119 events per year).
Neoplasia
The applicant has presented a display of the evaluation of the cases of benign intestinal neoplasias in 
the study programme.
It could be shown that for four cases no histological diagnosis was available, two  cases in the 
teduglutide group in study CL0600-020/021 have been identified for which histological diagnosis is 
available. Both have been identified as tubular or tubulo-villous adenoma with low grade dysplasia. An 
imminent danger of malignancy was therefore obviously not present. 
One additional patient in study CL0600-020 has been identified with colonic benign neoplasia that was 
treated with placebo. This enables to present a comparison of the placebo-controlled data, showing 
that a relevant difference in the occurrence rate of colonic polyps does obviously not exist. 
Whereas it has therefore to be acknowledged that the data available do by no means indicate an 
increased risk for colonic neoplasia development – it also has to be stated that the theoretical risk of 
the induction and/or promotion of neoplasias could by no means be excluded. 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 86/105
The development and/or promotion of neoplasias would according to theoretical considerations not 
become obvious during a short course of treatment, such as 6 months as during the placebo-controlled 
part of the studies. However, SBS patients would potentially need treatment for long periods, if not 
life-long, which could of course put them under increased risk of the development/accelerated growth 
of neoplasia (including malignant transformation) compared to an untreated population (disregarding 
the increased risk that might or might not be present due to underlying disease).
It is noted that in addition to the two cancer cases, which occurred after submission of the MAA in 
study CL0600-021 (patients […] and […]), a third patient ([…]) of the currently ongoing study CL0600-
021 reported “Carcinoma planoephiteliale of the right lung”. The investigator considered the event 
planoepithelial carcinoma of the right lung not related to the study drug. It is noted by the CHMP that 
this patient took teduglutide for more than a year and had not smoked for 25 years (and before that 
only 2.5 package years of smoking). Therefore a causal relationship cannot completely be ruled out.
As mentioned above there was 1 death due to a metastatic adenocarcinoma ([…]) during this study 
that was considered to be an unanticipated problem. NPS instructed all participating investigators to 
submit the case to their respective IRBs. An Expert Panel met on 08 July 2011 to discuss the case and 
the following was decided:
•
•
•
based on the available data, there was no need to stop the trial;
the subjects in the study with a prior history of cancer should remain in the study as they were 
not at increased risk;
the DSMB used in the CL0600-020 trial will reconvene to monitor the safety of the trial and to 
review the CL0600-021 protocol to possibly enhance the safety monitoring in this study.
However, the report of a fatal malignancy (adenocarcinoma derived from the gastrointestinal tract, 
primary tumour unknown) which apparently was a “de novo” case while the patient was treated with 
teduglutide gives reason to some concern. Teduglutide promotes hyperplasia of intestinal mucosa and 
this effect could at least in theory promote growth of gastrointestinal epithelium derived tumours. 
The applicant has provided data that suggest that the overall incidence of cancer is not increased in 
teduglutide treated patients compared to what has been observed in comparable population with short 
bowel syndrome. While reassuring, the data presented does not remove completely the concern about 
the tumor promoting effect of teduglutide. The number of patients as well as the duration of exposure 
is too limited to allow firm conclusions. Appropriate warnings are included in the SmPC regarding the 
potential risk of intestinal neoplasia furthermore Post-marketing surveillance will focus in particular on 
this issue (see below Discussion on Safety).  
Other Significant Adverse Events
Overall, 10 (9.2%) teduglutide treated patients were reported with a TEAE leading to premature 
discontinuation from the placebo controlled SBS studies (placebo: 4 [6.8%] patients). Eight (10.4%) 
patients in the 0.05 mg/kg/day teduglutide dose group and 2 (6.3%) patients in the 0.10 mg/kg/day 
teduglutide dose group discontinued due to a TEAE. Gastrointestinal Disorders led most frequently to 
early discontinuations (placebo: 3 patients [5.1%]; teduglutide 7 patients [6.4%]). No SOC could be 
identified leading to remarkably more discontinuations under teduglutide than under placebo 
treatment. The only TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation which were reported by more than 
one patient in any of the treatment groups during the placebo controlled SBS studies were “Abdominal 
Distension” (two teduglutide patients (1.8%)) and “Constipation” (two teduglutide patients (1.8%)) in

the SOC Gastrointestinal Disorders. No case of “abdominal distension” or “constipation” leading to 
discontinuation was reported in the placebo group.
Laboratory findings
Clinical Chemistry
Examining liver function tests of Alkaline Phosphatase, ALT, AST, Total Bilirubin, and GGT revealed a 
decrease in all liver biochemical markers of disease and injury at Week 24 in teduglutide treated 
subjects versus placebo treated subjects. 
Albumin as a surrogate marker of overall nutrition was reported to be lower in placebo treated subjects 
(-1.7 g/L) vs. those subjects treated with teduglutide (-1.1g/L). 
Another analyte of interest measured was C-reactive protein (CRP). Modest increase of CRP of 
approximately 25 mg/l have been observed within the first seven days of Revestive treatment, which 
decreased continuously under on-going daily injections. After 24 weeks of Revestive treatment, 
patients showed small overall increase in CRP of approximately 1,5 mg/l on average. The clinical 
significance of CRP increase is unclear as its values have been found to fluctuate throughout the trials 
and considering the different baseline characteristics of the study population, this magnitude of change 
from baseline may not be clinically significant. Due to this uncertainty, monitoring of CRP has been 
added to the international Short Bowel Syndrome Registry.
Shifts from baseline in Placebo Controlled SBS Studies
Shifts from low/normal to high are seen in Liver biochemical markers of AST and ALT in both 
teduglutide and placebo treated subjects: AST; 9.6% and 8.7% in the teduglutide treated subjects 
versus placebo treated subjects respectively, ALT; 7.9% and 8.7% in the teduglutide treated subjects 
versus placebo treated subjects respectively. Other common chemistries related to hepatobiliary 
enzymes reveal that shifts from normal/high to low total bilirubin levels are seen in teduglutide treated 
subjects versus placebo treated subjects (10.9% vs. 4.0 %; respectively). In regards to GGT, shifts 
from normal/low to high were seen in the teduglutide treated subjects versus placebo treated subjects 
(13.6% vs. 3.6%; respectively). 
The most common shifts for all subjects treated with teduglutide in these studies from low/normal to 
high were changes in CRP (17.9%). 
For the remainder of the analytes, the percentages of teduglutide and placebo-treated subjects with 
shifts from low/normal to high or high/normal to low were similar or greater in placebo-treated 
subjects. 
Post-baseline markedly abnormal clinical chemistry 
The most common post-baseline markedly abnormal analyte among subjects treated with teduglutide 
was CRP (24%) vs. placebo treated subjects (8.6%). In regards to liver biochemical markers of 
Alkaline Phosphatase > 2X NL, ALT > 3X NL, AST > 3X NL, Total Bilirubin > 2X NL, and Albumin similar 
rates were observed for teduglutide treated subjects versus placebo treated subjects. 
Safety in special populations
Subgroup analyses for gender, age, race and stoma yes/no on exposure, demography, and adverse 
events have been presented. Overall it appears that there are no relevant differences for the 
investigated subgroups compared to the overall population.

Immunological events
Teduglutide is a peptide, produced by biotechnology, which may induce an antibody response towards 
teduglutide or towards endogenous GLP-2. 
Assays for measuring antibodies to teduglutide, neutralizing antibodies to teduglutide and anti-ECP 
antibodies have been developed and validated. These assays were mainly applied in the two pivotal 
studies CL060-020 and CL060-021 but also on available samples from previous studies. In the pivotal 
studies, development of antibodies to teduglutide increased as exposure increase with roughly one 
fourth of patients having antibodies to teduglutide after 1 year of treatment. However, none of the 
antibodies were neutralising and no effect on safety and efficacy of teduglutide could be demonstrated. 
Generally antibodies to teduglutide cross-reacted with native GLP-2, which due to the high degree of 
homology between teduglutide and GLP-2 is to be expected. Anti ECP antibodies developed in more 
than 1 out 3 patients but no effect on safety could be demonstrated.
The data collected so far does not indicate that immunogenicity poses a significant risk to the safety 
and efficacy of the drug. However, as only relative short term studies are available, immunogenicity 
and potential impact on safety and efficacy should remain under observation. The RMP targets this 
issue and a further assessment of antibody and safety data are required to be collected in the on-going 
long term clinical study CL0600-021 and a separate presentation of respective case reports in a special 
section of the PSUR is considered.
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
Considering that teduglutide is a peptide that is believed to undergo hydrolytic degradation rather than 
being metabolised by drug metabolising enzymes no information safety-related drug-drug-interactions 
are expected. No clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. An in-vitro study 
indicates that Teduglutide does not inhibit cytochrome P450 drug metabolising enzymes. However, 
based upon the pharmacodynamics effect of teduglutide, there is a potential for increased absorption 
of concomitant medicinal products. Therefore patients receiving oral concomitant medicinal products 
requiring titration or with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored closely due to potential 
increased absorption.
Discontinuation due to adverse events
An inverse dose relationship was suggested for teduglutide with respect to discontinuations due to AEs.  
From the pooled analyses of phase 2 and 3 studies, discontinuations due to AEs were highest in the 
0.05 mg/kg/d group. Overall, 10 (9.2%) teduglutide treated patients were reported with a TEAE 
leading to premature discontinuation from the placebo controlled SBS studies (placebo: 4 [6.8%] 
patients). Eight (10.4%) patients in the 0.05 mg/kg/day teduglutide dose group and 2 (6.3%) patients 
in the 0.10 mg/kg/day teduglutide dose group discontinued due to a TEAE. Gastrointestinal Disorders 
led most frequently to early discontinuations (placebo: 3 patients [5.1%]; teduglutide 7 patients 
[6.4%]). No SOC could be identified leading to remarkably more discontinuations under teduglutide 
than under placebo treatment. The only TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation which were 
reported by more than one patient in any of the treatment groups during the placebo controlled SBS 
studies were “Abdominal Distension” (two teduglutide patients (1.8%)) and “Constipation” (two 
teduglutide patients (1.8%)) in the SOC Gastrointestinal Disorders. No case of “abdominal distension” 
or “constipation” leading to discontinuation was reported in the placebo group.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety
In order to describe the safety of teduglutide, the applicant has provided a pooled analysis of safety 
data from the placebo controlled studies (CL0600-004 and CL0600-020) as well as an analysis of all 
safety data from phase 2/3 studies in SBS. 
The size of the pooled analysis of safety data from placebo controlled studies with teduglutide is 
considered acceptable for this orphan indication; further safety data will be generated through a 
dedicated registry (International Short Bowel Syndrome Registry prospective described in the RMP), 
which was requested by the CHMP. In addition, in the pooled analysis of placebo controlled studies 
there were no imbalances (in terms of demographics and disease characteristics) between groups that 
are likely to have had any significant effect on the safety results. Furthermore, duration of exposure 
was very similar in placebo and teduglutide treated patients. Thus, the present pooled analysis 
provides a reasonably unbiased evaluation of the safety of teduglutide compared to placebo.
The overall number of TEAE and TESAE was only slightly higher in the teduglutide treated patients 
compared to the placebo treated patients. Severity was also comparable in the two groups. However, 
serious adverse drug reactions (TESAEs considered possibly related to treatment) occurred more often 
in the teduglutide group than in the placebo group. The same was the case for TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation. 
There were 6 SOCs where the rate of TEAEs was at least 5% or greater in the teduglutide group 
compared with the placebo group: 
1. Gastrointestinal Disorders (primarily abdominal pain/distension, nausea/vomiting but difference 
regarding number of patients reporting intestinal obstruction). Although a large fraction was mild to 
moderate in severity, GI adverse events were the main AE leading to premature discontinuation. From 
the presented data, it is obvious that gastrointestinal obstruction occurs more frequently in teduglutide 
treated patients than in placebo treated patients. The mechanism behind these events appears 
reasonably well explained on the basis of the pharmacological effects of the drug and the 
predisposition of the treated patients. It is considered a real, but manageable risk. Adequate warnings 
have been included in the SmPC. In addition monitoring of intestinal obstruction has been included in 
the International Short Bowel Syndrome Registry (described in the RMP).
2. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (primarily injection site reactions). As regards 
injection site reactions, detailed review of this problem did not indicate that injection site reactions 
were more common for teduglutide (in the proposed dose, 0.05 mg/kg/day) than for placebo. Thus 
injection site reactions do not constitute a major problem for teduglutide in the proposed dose (this 
risk is addressed in the RMP and in the section 4.8 of SmPC).
3. Infections and Infestations. Of particular interest has been the apparent difference between placebo 
and teduglutide in terms of catheter sepsis. However, number of cases is small and somewhat 
divergent classification has been used. When grouping all AEs indicative of catheter related infection 
there was no apparent difference between placebo and teduglutide in the proposed dose. Catheter 
sepsis remains a serious complication in the patient population but there is no indication that 
teduglutide increases this risk (as described in the RMP).
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 90/105
4. Injury, Poisoning And Procedural Complications. It is noted that gastrointestinal stoma complications 
were more frequent in the teduglutide group compared to placebo. The mechanism behind these 
events appears reasonably well explained on the basis of the pharmacological effects of the drug and 
the predisposition of the treated patients. It is considered a real, but manageable risk. Adequate 
warnings have been included in the SmPC.
5. Psychiatric Disorders. ‘sleep disorders’ and ‘anxiety’ was clearly more common among teduglutide 
treated patients than among placebo treated patients. These adverse events have been included in the 
SmPC. Anxiety has been also addressed in the RMP.
There were 3 reports of cancer during teduglutide treatment (including open label treatment). Two of 
these subsequently died of their cancers. While it is agreed that one of the fatal cases (non-small lung 
cell cancer in a heavy smoker having received teduglutide for only 85 days) most certainly is not 
related to teduglutide treatment, the causality assessment is more uncertain for the two other cases. 
One (fatal) case was adenocarcinoma of unknown primary origin (but most likely GI tract) with 
metastasis to the liver in a patients receiving teduglutide for almost a year. The other was a (non-
fatal) case of planocellular carcinoma of the lung in a patient taking teduglutide for more than a year 
who had not smoked for 25 years (and before that only 2.5 package years of smoking). In the two 
latter cases a causal relationship cannot be ruled out. Even though the number of events is small and it 
is not possible to determine if this rate of events during teduglutide is higher than what can be 
expected in a similar population, these reports give cause for concern. From the theoretical point of 
view, due to its character of being a growth factor inducer and inducing epithelial hyperplasia, there is 
some concern of induction and/or promotion of benign and/or malignant tumours. In addition to the 
above, the concerns are corroborated by the data derived in animals, where benign biliary tumours 
have been induced by high doses. The applicant has evaluated the occurrence of tumours and its 
precursors during the clinical studies and has found some colonic adenomatous changes, one being 
dysplastic in nature. Although from a theoretical point of view, the induction of colonic neoplasia 
appears to be more remote than in the small intestine, it is on the other hand known that small 
intestine neoplasia is in general a much rarer event compared to colonic neoplasia. Therefore, with the 
current data available, neither of these concerns (and in addition also biliary neoplasia) can be 
completely ruled out. Adequate warnings and recommendations regarding screening for intestinal 
neoplasia have been included in the SmPC. Furthermore, the applicant will design and implement a 
registry of teduglutide treated patients specifically aiming at monitoring the risk of neoplasia (as 
described in Annex II).
The combined analyses of data from the placebo controlled SBS studies CL0600-004 and CL0600-020 
showed a small overall increase in average CRP during teduglutide treatment (1.43 mg/L above 
baseline at end of study) compared placebo treatment. In addition, the fraction of patients exhibiting a 
shift from low/normal to high CRP was higher in the teduglutide treated patients and the fraction of 
patients exhibiting a markedly abnormal post-baseline CRP was higher in the teduglutide group than in 
the placebo group. Increased CRP values are a known predictor for an increased cardiovascular risk. 
However, there is no robust data showing a causal link between the increase of CRP and the 
occurrence of cardiovascular disease. In addition, in the SBS population an increased rate of 
cardiovascular AEs has not been observed in clinical trials with teduglutide. This observed modest 
increase in CRP is addressed in the RMP Section as the important potential risk “Increased C reactive 
protein” and in the SmPC. 
On an individual level, the proposals put forward as risk minimisation measures are considered 
acceptable.  At a population level, the proposed registry study (as described in Annex II) is considered 
relevant for monitoring of CRP/cardiovascular events.

Summary of Product Characteristics.
Additional expert consultations
The CHMP had asked an Ad-Hoc Expert Group to provide their view on specific issues related to safety 
identified during the assessment. 
The known adverse effects (pancreatic and biliary tract disease, bowel obstruction) and 
uncertainty about any potential tumour promoting effect (as evidenced by the reports of a 
number of malignant and benign neoplasias) as well as uncertainty about the consequences 
of the observed  effect on average CRP (potential negative effect on cardiovascular risk).
The clinicians considered the adverse effects of teduglutide manageable. It was not considered useful 
to add a special monitoring procedure for patients taking this treatment except the standard 
monitoring as recommended by relevant guidelines for the underlying disease, the standard screening 
for SBS and patients being under parenteral nutrition as additional monitoring would create a new 
burden to the patient without generating additional information. With regards to the potential tumor 
promoting effect and the effect on average CRP/potential CV risk the experts acknowledged the 
uncertainty with regards to the additional effect of the compound but noted that growth might have 
been accelerated by teduglutide but an effect on initiating tumors was not shown by the data. 
Therefore the experts supported to generate the relevant long term data within the registry proposed 
by the applicant and agreed by the CHMP.
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety
Based on the available data it is concluded that teduglutide has an acceptable safety profile for 
treatment duration of up to 1 year. The CHMP noted that, effects obviously directly related to the 
pharmacodynamic action of the compound may lead to a relatively high burden of treatment 
withdrawals, and serious, and sometimes severe adverse events. Considering the serious and disabling 
nature of condition with a considerable impact on QoL and only limited symptomatic treatment options, 
this AE-profile is considered acceptable.
The events affecting tolerability are mostly related to the gastrointestinal tract, ranging from 
abdominal pain and constipation, to bowel obstruction, stoma complications, and ileus and to biliary 
problems including cholecystitis. While these events are important, the risk is well known and 
considered manageable (as described in the RMP).
Hepatobiliary and pancreatic events were only reported in teduglutide patients. In this respect, it is a 
concern that a considerable part of the reports were serious. That these events most probably 
represent the PD-action of teduglutide is further supported by the non-clinical studies which revealed 
hyperplastic and/or hypertrophic effects of teduglutide on intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, the 
gallbladder and pancreatic ducts. These risks are addressed in the RMP and the SmPC. In addition, the 
non-interventional study (NIS, described in Annex II) will provide further safety data on these events.
The observed modest increase in CRP is addressed in the RMP and in the SmPC. The proposed registry 
study (as described in Annex II) is considered relevant for monitoring of CRP/cardiovascular events.

Regarding the potential of neoplasia induction, the applicant will design and implement a registry of 
teduglutide treated patients specifically aiming at monitoring this risk (as described in the RMP).
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:

A Long-term, Open-label Study with Teduglutide for Subjects with Parenteral Nutrition 
Dependent Short Bowel Syndrome. The applicant should submit the final study report of a 
Long-term, Open-label Study with Teduglutide for Subjects with Parenteral Nutrition 
Dependent Short Bowel Syndrome. Due date: Q4 2013

International Short Bowel Syndrome Registry: The MAH shall perform a non-interventional 
study (NIS) to gather further safety data based on a CHMP approved protocol. Focus will 
primarily be on disease characteristics, treatment and progression and will include real-life use 
and safety of teduglutide in those patients receiving teduglutide. Simple treatment outcome 
measures will be collected. Due date: The study is planned to start Q1 2013 and will continue 
until Q1 2022. Interim data for the NIS should be provided every second year within the 
PSURs.
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system
The applicant has provided documents that set out a detailed description of the system of 
pharmacovigilance. The CHMP considers that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the 
applicant fulfils the requirements and provides adequate evidence that the applicant has the services of 
a qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification 
of any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

Patients should be advised to contact their physician in 
case of sudden weight gain, swollen ankles and/or

by appropriate and timely assessment of parenteral 
nutrition needs. This assessment should be conducted 
more frequently within the first months of treatment. In 
case of a significant deterioration of the cardiovascular 
disease, the need for continued Revestive treatment 
should be reassessed.

A colonoscopy with removal of polyps should be 
performed at the time of starting treatment with 
Revestive. Subsequent colonoscopies are 
recommended at a minimum of five year intervals. An 
individual assessment whether increased frequency of 
surveillance is necessary should be performed based 
on the patient characteristics (e.g. age, underlying 
disease). See also section 5.1. If a polyp is found, 
adherence to current polyp follow up guidelines is 
recommended. In case of malignancy, Revestive 
therapy should be discontinued (see section 4.3).
Revestive has not been studied in patients with severe, 
clinically unstable concomitant diseases, (e.g., 
cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, infectious, endocrine,

could neither exclude nor confirm such an increased 
risk. Several cases of benign colonic polyps occurred 
during the course of the trials, however, the frequency 
was not increased compared to placebo treated 
patients. In addition to the need  for a colonoscopy with 
removal of polyps by the time of the initiation of the 
treatment (see section 4.4.), every patient should be 
assessed for the need of an enhanced surveillance

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits
Beneficial effects
Short bowel syndrome is a state of intestinal failure following major intestinal resection. Currently 
limited treatment options are available restricted to pharmacological therapy aiming at reduction of 
secretory losses and parenteral nutrition (PN: fluid/energy). PN is associated with a significant impact 
on quality of life in addition to risk of serious complications (e.g. central catheter sepsis and 
thrombosis, complications related to bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine, significant liver 
toxicity and biliary disease). Therefore, a continual effort to advance enteral feeding must be 
considered for these patients. Based on these considerations an unmet medical need exists for this 
rare and debilitating condition of intestinal failure. Due to the capacity of the intestine to undergo 
adaptation after surgical resection, PN requirements may not be permanent. Based on the mechanism 
of action, teduglutide could have the potential to improve/accelerate this adaptive process thereby 
providing a potential valuable additional treatment option to these patients with limited possibilities.
Study CL0600-004 failed to meet its primary objective and was only considered hypothesis generating. 
Based on exploratory analyses of this study, the applicant identified a dose of teduglutide (0.05 
mg/kg/day) which seemed efficacious. Subsequently a new study was performed (study CL0600-020) 
intended to provide confirmatory evidence of the efficacy and safety of teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/day. 
This study demonstrated that compared to placebo, teduglutide statistically significantly reduces the 
volume of PN/i.v. in SBS. The results showed that compared to placebo, teduglutide had statistically 
significant effect on the primary efficacy parameter, 20% or greater reduction in volume of PN/i.v. at 
weeks 20 and 24. The effect was seen both in terms of absolute and relative reductions in the volume 
of PN/i.v. The results were robust and confirmed in a number of sensitivity analyses. The effect was 
observed across a number of subgroups such as male/female, age groups, stoma/no stoma and colon-
in-continuity/colon-not-in-continuity. The secondary endpoints generally supported the primary 
endpoint.  Compared to placebo, teduglutide had superior effect after 8 to 12 weeks. Duration of effect 
was also superior in teduglutide treated patients compared to placebo treated patients. Data from the 
long-term extension trial indicated that the beneficial effects mentioned after 6 months treatment 
could be maintained, or even improved after 12 months of treatment, and that the beneficial effects 
shown in the placebo-controlled phase with active treatment could also be achieved when the 
substance was given to previously placebo-treated patients. 
In fact the interim report from the long term follow up  study CL0600-021  indicates a high frequency 
of subjects being able to reduce number of days on PN/i.v. by at least 1 day (a clinically relevant 
benefit for the patient) and even a few patients being able to discontinue PN/I.V. altogether (the 
ultimate goal of treatment). This seemingly provides evidence of the clinical relevance of the observed 
effect. The submission of the final study report has been made a condition in Annex II.
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.
As stated above, the pivotal placebo controlled study (CL0600-020) has demonstrated that teduglutide 
can reduce the volume of PN/i.v. needed to maintain homeostasis in SBS. Whereas the long term 
study CL0600-021 is still ongoingnone of the subjects in the short term study could be weaned off 
PN/i.v. fluid completely which could constitute to a clear clinically relevant effect. As complete weaning 
of might only be realistic in a less severe population it may be more appropriate to show clinical 
relevance in the present setting with patients with a very short segment of remaining intestine and a 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 101/105
substantial requirement for PN/i.v. in the reduction in number of days on PN/i.v.  Another way of 
supporting the clinical relevance of the observed effect is to demonstrate that patient satisfaction/QoL 
is improved. Unfortunately, in the present study with the instrument applied (SBS-QoL™) it was not 
possible to demonstrate any significant difference in QoL between placebo and teduglutide treated 
patients. The lack of effect on this secondary endpoint was considered to be related to the 
heterogeneity of the study population as well as the lack of sensitivity of the QoL instrument used. 
Thus the lack of effect on this endpoint was not considered to seriously question the clinical relevance 
of the observed effect on reduction in PN/i.v. volume. However further Data on Quality of Live will be 
generated within the NIS and the long term study CL0600-021, (as described in Annex II and RMP).
The extrapolation of data on long term non responders from the on-going long term study CL0600-021 
indicates the basis for discontinuation of the Teduglutide treatment if no effects are visible after a 
defined period of time from the beginning of the treatment. The number of patients showing a PN 
volume response (defined as at least 20% reduction in PN volume from baseline) is continuously 
increasing over time, reaching more then 70% of patients after 6 months in trial CL0600-020. 
Thereafter, only a small increase is seen in the open extension trial CL0600-021. It seems therefore 
appropriate to evaluate the treatment effect after 6 months, because only very few patients with 
potential PN volume response might stop treatment inappropriately after this point in time.
 On the other hand, due to the unknown long-term risks associated with teduglutide treatment, a life-
long treatment without clear signs of efficacy is not justified. The CHMP considers that defining a 
general realistic goal for treatment applicable to all patients is neither realistic nor desirable. Thus a 
more general assessment by the physician should consider individual treatment objective and patient 
preferences. Treatment should be stopped after 6 months if no overall improvement of the patient 
condition is achieved (as reflected in the SmPC). Results of Study CL0600-021 (as described in Annex 
II) will provide further information on the long-term effects of teduglutide treatment.
Risks
Unfavourable effects
Most of the adverse events observed following administration of teduglutide were mild and moderate in 
severity; one third of the adverse events were considered to be severe. 
The most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) were reported from the GI system. This finding is 
not surprising in view of the PD profile of teduglutide and the patient characteristics. The most 
commonly reported GI AEs for teduglutide vs. placebo were abdominal pain; nausea; vomiting; 
abdominal distension and constipation. While these events are important, the risk is well known (and 
described in the RMP).
Hepatobiliary and pancreatic events were only reported in teduglutide patients. In this respect, it is a 
concern that a considerable part of the reports were serious. That these events most probably 
represent the PD-action of teduglutide is further supported by the non-clinical studies which revealed 
hyperplastic and/or hypertrophic effects of teduglutide on intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, the 
gallbladder and pancreatic ducts. These risks are addressed in the RMP and the SmPC. In addition, the 
non-interventional study (NIS; described in Annex II)) will provide further safety data on these events.
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects
There were 3 reports of cancer during teduglutide treatment (including open label treatment). Two of 
these subsequently died of their cancers. While it is agreed that one of the fatal cases (non-small lung 
cell cancer in a heavy smoker having received teduglutide for only 85 days) most certainly is not 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 102/105
related to teduglutide treatment, the causality assessment is more uncertain for the two other cases. 
Even though the number of events is small and it is not possible to determine if this rate of events 
during teduglutide is higher than what can be expected in a similar population, these reports give 
cause for concern. From the theoretical point of view, due to its character of being a growth factor 
inducer and inducing epithelial hyperplasia, there is some concern of induction and/or promotion of 
benign and/or malignant tumours. In addition to the above, the concerns are corroborated by the data 
derived in animals, where benign biliary tumours have been induced by high doses. The applicant has 
evaluated the occurrence of tumours and its precursors during the clinical studies and has found some 
colonic adenomatous changes, one being dysplastic in nature. Although from a theoretical point of 
view, the induction of colonic neoplasia appears to be more remote than in the small intestine, it is on 
the other hand known that small intestine neoplasia is in general a much rarer event compared to 
colonic neoplasia. Adequate warnings and recommendations regarding screening for intestinal 
neoplasia have been included in the SmPC. Furthermore, the applicant will design and implement a 
registry of teduglutide treated patients specifically aiming at monitoring the risk of neoplasia (as 
described in Annex II).Furthermore the recording of colonoscopy results will be performed in the 
planned NIS and respective case reports should be presented in a special section of the PSUR.
The combined analyses of data from the placebo controlled SBS studies CL0600-004 and CL0600-020 
showed a small overall increase in average CRP during teduglutide treatment (1.43 mg/L above 
baseline at end of study) compared placebo treatment. Increased CRP values are a known predictor for 
an increased cardiovascular risk. In the SBS population an increased rate of cardiovascular AEs has not 
been observed in clinical trials with teduglutide however it is considered appropriate to address this 
observed modest increase in CRP in the RMP and in the SmPC. Furthermore it is considered relevant to 
monitor CRP/cardiovascular events in the proposed registry study (as described in Annex II).
Benefit-risk balance
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The aim of teduglutide induced reductions in weekly PN or weaning off PN is to significantly improve 
the condition of intestinal failure in addition to improve quality of life and reduce frequency of severe 
potentially life-threatening complication related to PN. 
The primary efficacy endpoint (percentage of patients who achieve a 20% or greater reduction in 
weekly PN/i.v. volume at week 20 and 24) was considered clinically relevant by a group of experts in 
the field. The clinical relevance of the observed effect was, also backed by the positive effect on the 
exploratory endpoint “reduction in number of days with PN/i.v.”. One or more days without having to 
be chained to an i.v. line constitutes a real benefit for the patient. 
Teduglutide has an acceptable safety profile for treatment duration of up to 1 year. The CHMP noted 
that, effects obviously directly related to the pharmacodynamic action of the compound may lead to a 
relatively high burden of treatment withdrawals, and serious, and sometimes severe adverse events. 
Considering the serious and disabling nature of condition with a considerable impact on QoL and only 
limited symptomatic treatment options, this AE-profile is considered acceptable.
Benefit-risk balance
The results from the pivotal study showed that compared to placebo, teduglutide had statistically 
significant effect on the primary efficacy parameter, 20% or greater reduction in volume of PN/i.v. at 
weeks 20 and 24. The results were robust and confirmed in a number of sensitivity analyses. Data 
from the long-term extension trial indicated that the beneficial effects mentioned after 6 months 
Revestive
Assessment report 
Page 103/105
treatment could be maintained, or even improved after 12 months of treatment. The clinical relevance 
of the observed effects was confirmed by a number of experts in this field.
Most of the adverse events observed following administration of teduglutide were mild and moderate in 
severity; one third of the adverse events were considered to be severe. Adequate measures (as 
descibed in Annex II) have been identified to generate additional data in this rare condition to further 
elucidate particularly the safety profile. The SmPC is adequately describing the currently available 
information and provides appropriate guidance on the use of teduglutide.
Considering the serious and disabling nature of the condition with a considerable impact on QoL and 
only limited symptomatic treatment options, the demonstrated effect of clinical relevance clearly 
outweighs the safety concerns. Therefore, the benefit-risk balance for teduglutide for the treatment of 
adult patients with Short Bowel Syndrome, who should be stable following a period of intestinal 
adaptation after surgery, is demeed positive.

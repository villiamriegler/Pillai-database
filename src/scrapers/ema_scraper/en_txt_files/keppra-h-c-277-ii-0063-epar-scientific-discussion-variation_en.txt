Introduction 
Epilepsy is one of the most common and challenging neurological disorders. It has been estimated that 
there  are  over  50  million  people  affected  worldwide.  However,  there  are  few  antiepileptic  drugs 
(AEDs) licensed for initial use as monotherapy in subjects with newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy. 
The  first-line  drugs  for  the  treatment  of  partial  and  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures  are 
carbamazepine  (CBZ),  phenytoin  (PHT)  and  valproate  (VPA).  In  the  2001  International  League 
Against  Epilepsy  guidelines,  the  first  choice  of  treatment  for  partial  seizures  is  CBZ.  Established 
AEDs  may  not  always  be  an  ideal  first  choice  regarding,  in  particular,  their  propensity  to  cause 
neurotoxicity, idiosyncratic reactions and pharmacokinetic interactions.  
Keppra  (levetiracetam  –  LEV)  is  currently  authorized  as  an  adjunctive  therapy  in  the  treatment  of 
partial  onset  seizures  with  or  without  secondary  generalisation  in  patients  with  epilepsy.  It  is  also 
authorized as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 
12  years  of  age  with  Juvenile  Myoclonic  Epilepsy.  Based  on  the  results  of  a  well-conducted 
comparative  monotherapy  study  in  patients  with  newly  or  recently  diagnosed epilepsy  and suffering 
from partial or generalized tonic-clonic, the MAH applied to extend the current indication as follows: 
“Keppra  is  indicated  as  monotherapy  in  the  treatment  of  partial  onset  seizures  with  or  without 
secondary generalisation in patients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy.” 
In addition to section 4.1 of the SPC, the MAH proposed to update sections 4.2 and 4.8 to reflect the 
new data generated by the pivotal study and to introduce an improvement to the wording of section 
4.5. The Package Leaflet (PL) was revised accordingly.

Clinical aspects 
GCP 
The Clinical  trials were performed in  accordance  with GCP, as  stated by the MAH. In addition, the 
MAH confirmed that the ethical requirements of the clinical trial directive 2001/20/EC were applied 
for clinical trials conducted outside the EU. 
Clinical efficacy  
The clinical efficacy programme was based on a pivotal comparative monotherapy study (N01061).  
Extended treatment was possible in 3 follow-up studies, all of which were ongoing at the time of the 
submission of this application: 
- 
Study  N01093,  a  double-blind  long-term  follow-up  study  to  N01061in  which  subjects  who 
benefited from their randomized treatment are able to continue to receive the same study drug, 
to evaluate the long-term safety of LEV and CBZ in monotherapy.

- 
Two open-label follow-up studies, N01091 (a Named Patient program) and N01127, intended to 
allow subjects from N01061 or N01093 to continue to receive LEV (and, although no subject 
did so, before N01061 unblinding, subjects previously exposed to CBZ who converted to LEV 
were also eligible). 
One  additional  study  is  ongoing,  N01175,  a  phase  IIIb  therapeutic  confirmatory,  open-label, 
multicenter,  randomized,  community-based  trial  investigating  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  LEV 
compared to VPA and CBZ as monotherapy in subjects with newly diagnosed epilepsy.  
Main study N01061: Phase III, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, positive-
controlled, non-inferiority, monotherapy study  
METHODS 
Objectives 
• 
• 
• 
Primary objective: to prove that monotherapy treatment with LEV 1000 to 3000 mg/day is non-
inferior to monotherapy with CBZ 400 to 1200 mg/day in achieving 6-month seizure freedom as 
primary  end-point,  in  adults  (≥16  years)  with  newly  or  recently  diagnosed  epilepsy,  suffering 
from partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures.  
Secondary  objective:  To  compare  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  both  drugs  in  the  same 
population.  
Exploratory objective: To compare the direct and indirect cost parameters between both drugs. 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria  
Among the inclusion criteria were: 
• 
Subjects  with  newly  or  recently  diagnosed  epilepsy  having  experienced  unprovoked  partial 
seizures (IA, IB, IC with clear focal origin), or generalized tonic-clonic seizures (without clear 
focal  origin),  that  were  classifiable  according  to  the  International  Classification  of  Epileptic 
Seizures. The discrimination between IC and IIE was not requested for inclusion. 
Subjects with at least 2 unprovoked seizures separated by a minimum of 48 hours in the year 
preceding  randomization,  of  which,  at  least  1  unprovoked  seizure  occurred  in  the  3  months 
preceding randomization. 
Male/female  subjects  (≥  16  years).  Inclusion  was  limited  to  subjects  ≥  18  years  at  one  site  in 
Poland. 
Minimum body weight of 40 kg. 
• 
• 
• 
Exclusion criteria:  
The  exclusion  criteria  included  known  allergic  reaction,  intolerance  to  CBZ  derivatives  and/or 
excipients, known skin rash or allergic reaction with any other drug, known alcohol or drug addiction 
or  abuse  within  the  last  two  years,  clinical  or  EEG  finding  suggestive  of  idiopathic  generalized 
epilepsy  (IGE)  at  randomization,  history  or  presence  of  known  pseudo-seizures,  and  previous  AED 
treatment except for acute and subacute seizure treatment with a maximum of 2 week duration. 
Treatments 
The study drug was LEV 250 mg tablets at daily dose of 1000 to 3000 mg divided in two equal oral 
intakes. 
The comparator was CBZ controlled release (CBZ CR) tablets at daily dose of 400 to 1200 mg divided 
in two equal oral intakes.  
All  LEV,  CBZ  and  placebo  capsules  were  made  identical  in  shape,  size,  weight  and  colour  by  the 
over-encapsulation process to ensure the blinding of the study.

The study consisted of several periods, with a maximal duration of 121 weeks for an individual subject 
(see Figure 1): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Screening period: 1 week. 
Up-titration period: 2 weeks: CBZ CR 200mg/day or LEV 500mg/day (250mg bid). 
Stabilization period: 1 week: CBZ CR 400mg/day or LEV 1000mg/day (Dose level 1). 
Evaluation period: 26 weeks. 
Maintenance period: 26 weeks. 
Conversion (2 to 6 weeks) to open label LEV or down-titration (3 to 7 weeks) or switch to a 
double-blind LEV/CBZ follow-up study. 
If a seizure occurred during the evaluation period, a 2-week dose escalation period to the second target 
daily dose (CBZ CR 800mg/day or LEV 2000mg/day) was followed by a 1-week stabilization period, 
a  26-week  evaluation  period  and  a  26-week  maintenance  period.  The  same  was  true  if  a  seizure 
occurred  during  the  evaluation  period  at  the  second  dose  level  with  an  escalation  to  the  third  target 
daily dose (CBZ CR 1200mg/day or LEV 3000mg/day). 
At the end of the study the subject had three options: 
• 
To continue in an open-label LEV treatment (named patient program N01091) after a double-
blind 2 to 6-week conversion period, or 
To  continue  with  double-blind  LEV/CBZ  treatment  (study  N01093)  until  database  lock  and 
unblinding of study N01061, or 
To discontinue the study drug after a 3 to 7-week down-titration period.

Randomisation and sample size 
A  total  number  of  619  subjects  were  screened,  from  which  579  were  randomized,  291  in  the  CBZ 
group and 288 in the LEV group. The ITT population totalled then 576 subjects, 291 in the CBZ group 
and 285 in the LEV group. The randomization list was generated by the Central Randomization Centre 
4/15

and Drug Supply Management Centre. A central randomization  process was  selected because of the 
high  number  of  centres  to  be  included  and  the  expected  small  number  of  subjects  per  centre.  The 
seizure type was considered as potentially influencing the 6-month seizure-freedom rate and was thus 
included as a stratification factor in the randomization, in order to guarantee the appropriate balance 
between treatment groups.  
Endpoints 
Primary efficacy variable 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  proportion  of  the  per-protocol  (PP)  subjects  with  6-month 
seizure freedom at the last evaluated dose. 
Subjects dropping out of the evaluation period (by definition without having achieved 6-month seizure 
freedom) were counted as non-seizure free. 
For each subject, a 6-month period was defined as starting at the latest of the three following dates: 
- 
- 
- 
Visit 3 date 
Escalation visit 1 date + 21 days 
Escalation visit 2 date + 21 days 
The end date of the 6-month seizure-freedom evaluation period was equal to the start date + 181 days, 
so that the number of evaluated days was 182. 
Secondary efficacy variables
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion  of  subjects  from  the  intention-to-treat  (ITT)  population  with  6-month  seizure 
freedom at the last evaluated dose. 
Proportion of subjects from a subset of the per-protocol (SPP) population with 6-month seizure 
freedom  at  the  last  evaluated  dose.  The  subset  (SPP)  excluded  subjects  who  dropped  out  for 
reasons not linked to efficacy before achieving 6-month seizure freedom. 
Proportion of subjects from the PP population with 1-year seizure freedom at the last evaluated 
dose. 
Time to first seizure at the last evaluated dose in the PP population. 
Time to withdrawal at the last evaluated dose in the PP population. 
Exploratory variables 
• 
• 
Direct  cost  parameters  for  concomitant  medications,  medical  procedures,  additional  physician 
visits, emergency room visits and hospitalizations. 
Indirect cost parameters: number of school or working days lost. 
Statistical methods 
The subject populations for analysis were the following:  
• 
• 
• 
The ITT population was defined as all randomized subjects who took at least one dose of either 
trial medication. 
The PP population was defined as the subset of the intention-to-treat population, consisting of 
those  subjects  who  had  no  major  protocol  deviations  affecting  the  efficacy  variables.  This 
subset was defined during a pre-analysis data review meeting before the trial was unblinded.  
The SPP population was defined as the subset of the primary efficacy analysis PP. It excluded 
all subjects discontinuing the study before having reached 6 months of seizure-freedom for any 
reason not linked to efficacy.

• 
The primary efficacy variable was defined as the proportion of subjects from the PP population 
with  6-month  seizure  freedom  at  the  last  evaluated  dose.  The  analysis  was  performed  by  the 
mean of a logistic regression model, including as factors, the treatment (CBZ vs LEV) and the 
seizure  type  category  as  last  assessed  (IA/IB/IC  with  clear  focal  origin  vs  IC/IIE  generalized 
tonic–clonic  seizures  without  clear  focal  origin).  The  parameters  estimated  from  this  model 
were  used  to  derive  an  adjusted  absolute  difference  (LEV  –  CBZ)  and  its  95  %  two-sided 
confidence interval. This confidence interval was thus compared to the non-inferiority limit set 
to –15 % in order to define if LEV could be considered as non-inferior to CBZ on the primary 
efficacy variable.  
The treatment by seizure type and treatment by country interactions on the primary efficacy variable 
were  assessed.  A  sensitivity  analysis  on  the  primary  efficacy  variable  was  also  performed  including 
aetiology as an additional factor in the logistic regression model.  
• 
• 
• 
The proportion of subjects from the ITT and SPP populations with 6-month seizure freedom at 
the  last  evaluated  dose  and  the  proportion  of  subjects  from  the  PP  population  with  1-year 
seizure freedom at the last evaluated dose were all analyzed using the same logistic regression 
model as for the primary efficacy analysis.  
The time to first seizure and the time to withdrawal were both computed at the last evaluated 
dose  and  analyzed  by  the  Kaplan-Meier  survival  method  for  the  PP  population.  For  both 
variables, the median time to event and its 95 % two-sided confidence interval were presented 
for  each  treatment  arm  together  with  the  hazard  ratio  of  LEV/CBZ  and  its  95  %  two-sided 
confidence interval. No non-inferiority comparison was performed on these variables.  
Safety parameters were listed and analyzed descriptively by treatment group.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variable:  
One hundred seventy three (73.0%) of the PP subjects in the LEV arm were seizure-free for at least 6 
months at the last evaluated dose, compared to 171 (72.8%) of the PP subjects in the CBZ arm. The 
adjusted  absolute  difference  between  LEV  and  CBZ  (95%  two-sided  CI)  obtained  from  a  logistic 
regression  model (including a factor for the seizure type category as last  assessed) equalled 0.2% (-
7.8%;  8.2%).  The  lower  limit  of  the  confidence  interval  (-7.8%)  was  thus  above  the  non-inferiority 
limit set by protocol at -15%.  Results are summarized in Table IV.

A  sensitivity  analysis  on  the  primary  efficacy  variable  and  including  aetiology  was  also  performed. 
The adjusted absolute difference between LEV and CBZ (95% two-sided CI) obtained from a logistic 
regression  model  including  the  additional  aetiology  factor  as  last  assessed  equalled  0.1%  (-7.6%; 
7.8%), a comparable outcome to the one obtained without including the aetiology factor. In addition, 
when evaluating the potential interactions between treatment and  seizure type, or between treatment 
and country, no significant differences were observed. 
The discrimination between IC (partial onset seizures with secondary generalisation) and IIE (primary 
generalised  tonic-clonic  seizures)  was  not  requested  for  inclusion.  At  the  request  of  the  CHMP,  the 
MAH provided a supplementary analysis of efficacy in patients with Type IC seizures. Seventy-three 
subjects (12.7%) of the ITT population were classified at their last available assessment in the “IC/IIE

More  subjects  discontinued  the  study  because  of  adverse  events  in  CBZ  group  (19.3  %)  than  in  the 
LEV  group  (14.7  %),  while  more  subjects  discontinued  the  study  because  of  lack  of  efficacy  in  the 
LEV group (17,5 %) than in the CBZ group (10.0 %), as shown in Table VIII.

The  subject  disposition  by  visit  from  randomization  visit  to  evaluation  visit  in  the  ITT  population 
showed that more patients on CBZ could remain on dose level 1 till the end of the study whilst more 
patients in the LEV group had to escalate to dose level 2 (28.8 % for LEV vs. 18.9 % for CBZ), and 
also  to  dose  level  3  (15.8  %  for  LEV  vs.  8.2  %  for  CBZ).  At  dose  level  3,  31  patients  in  the  LEV 
group discontinued due to lack of efficacy versus 13 for CBZ.  
DISCUSSION ON CLINICAL EFFICACY 
The clinical efficacy programme was based on a pivotal non-inferiority active controlled monotherapy 
study. The design of the study and the primary endpoint are in accordance with the recommendations 
in the CHMP epilepsy guideline. The choice of CBZ as comparator and the choice of doses for LEV 
and CBZ are considered adequate. 
The proportion of patients who were seizure-free for at least 6 months at their last evaluated dose was 
similar in the two groups in the primary analysis with an adjusted absolute difference between LEV 
and CBZ of 0.2% (-7.8%; 8.2%). The choice of -15 % as non-inferiority limit might be considered too 
high, but the observed lower limit of the confidence interval was well above -15 %. In addition, the 
MAHs’  supplementary  analysis  of  efficacy  in  patients  with  partial  onset  seizures  with  secondary 
generalisation has shown that the results are consistent with those observed in the entire population.  
The  efficacy  data  show  that  control  of  seizures  was  achieved  at  dose  level  1  in  a  slightly  higher 
percentage  of  patients  in  the  CBZ  group  than  in  the  LEV  group.  However,  these  differences  were 
relatively small and the total proportion of patients with 6 months seizure freedom for all 3 dose levels 
was similar for LEV and CBZ. The CHMP considered that the posology used in the study for Keppra 
was adequate. 
Based on the above elements, it can be concluded that the pivotal study comparing LEV (1000 to 3000 
mg/day) to CBZ (400 to 1200 mg/day) has demonstrated the non-inferiority of LEV as compared to 
CBZ  in  reaching  6-month  seizure  freedom  in  monotherapy  in  newly  or  recently  diagnosed  subjects 
with epilepsy experiencing partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

Clinical safety 
PATIENT EXPOSURE 
The safety data are primarily derived from subjects who participated in the pivotal study N01061. A 
total of 576 subjects were included in the ITT population, 291 in the CBZ group and 285 in the LEV 
group. A total of 426 subjects were exposed to the study drug for at least 6 months. 
The mean duration of exposure to treatment with CBZ and LEV were 302 and 316 days, respectively. 
The  mean  actual  dose  was  similar  in  the  ITT  and  PP  populations.  The  mean  daily  doses  in  the  ITT 
population  were  434.1  mg  in  the  CBZ  group  and  1170.4  in  the  LEV  group.  These  means  are  only 
slightly higher than dose level 1 due to the fact that the majority of subjects remained at dose level 1. 
ADVERSE EVENTS  
Overall, during the randomized treatment period (dose finding, evaluation and maintenance periods), 
235  (80.8%)  subjects  in  the  CBZ  group  and  227  (79.6%)  subjects  in  the  LEV  group  experienced  at 
least  one  treatment  emergent  adverse  event  (TEAE).  The  intensity  of  most  TEAEs  was  mild  or 
moderate.  
The  most  common  TEAEs  (≥  5%)  in  the  CBZ  group  were  headache  (25.4%),  fatigue  (14.1%), 
dizziness  (13.7%),  nausea  (10.7%),  nasopharyngitis  (9.6%),  somnolence  (9.3%),  influenza  (8.6%), 
back pain (6.9%), diarrhoea (6.5%), weight increased (6.5%) and rash (5.5%). 
The  most  common  TEAEs  (≥  5%)  in  the  LEV  group  were  headache  (20.7%),  fatigue  (16.5%), 
somnolence (11.2%), dizziness (10.9%), nasopharyngitis (9.1%), influenza (8.6%), diarrhoea (7.4%), 
nausea (7.0%), depression (6.3%), insomnia (6.0%) and vertigo (5.3%). 
The  most  common  TEAEs  (≥  5%  in  one  treatment  group)  with  different  incidences  (based  on  a 
difference of ≥ 3%) between both treatment groups are presented in Table IX.

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS/DEATHS/OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENTS  
A total of 47 subjects, 29 (10.0%) subjects in the CBZ group and 18 (6.3%) subjects in the LEV group 
experienced  at  least  one  serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  during  the  randomized  treatment  period.  The 
numbers of SAEs by SOC were similar in both treatment groups; 8 SAEs were reported in the UCB 
SOC Psychiatric disorders, 4 in each treatment group; 1 SAE was reported in the UCB SOC Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders, in the CBZ group.

There were a total of 5 deaths in the studies. Two deaths were reported during study N01061, both in 
the CBZ group, 1 as outcome of a lung neoplasm and 1 as outcome of a gun shot wound. One subject 
of  the  LEV  group  died  2.5  months  after  stopping  the  study  drug.  This  patient  had  at  study  entry 
multiple  diseases  which 
included  diabetes  mellitus,  hypertension,  hypercholesterolemia, 
atherosclerosis,  obesity  and  several  strokes  /  brain  haemorrhages.  Considering  the  patient’s  medical 
history, it appears likely that the status epilepticus was related to the patients cerebrovascular disease 
and that the causal relationship with the study drug is unlikely. 
Three  pregnancies  occurred  during  the  study,  all  in  the  CBZ  group.  One  pregnancy  occurred  in  a 
subject taking oral contraceptives. Two ended by an induced abortion and 1 by a normal delivery. 
DISCONTINUATION DUE TO ADVERSE EVENTS 
A total of 97 subjects, 56 (19.2%) in the CBZ group and 41 (14.4%) in the LEV group experienced at 
least  one  adverse  event  that  led  to  permanent  study  drug  discontinuation  (PTAE)  during  the 
randomized  treatment  period.  The  incidence  of  study  drug  discontinuations  was  higher  during  the 
dose-finding period than later in the study. PTAEs occurred during the dose finding period in 26/291 
(8.9%) subjects in the CBZ group and in 27/285 (9.5%) of the subjects in the LEV group. A total of 44 
subjects, 22 in each treatment group, permanently discontinued the study drug during the first 3 weeks 
of  exposure.  More  subjects  in  the  CBZ  group  than  in  the  LEV  group  discontinued  the  study  drug 
because of AEs classified in UCB SOCs Gastrointestinal disorder (9 subjects, 3.1% versus 3 subjects, 
1.1%) and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (17 subjects, 5.8% versus 4 subjects, 1.4%). More 
subjects  in  the  LEV  group  than  in  the  CBZ  group  discontinued  the  study  drug  because  of  adverse 
events  classified  in  the  UCB  SOCs  Nervous  system  disorder  (12  subjects,  4.2%  versus  8  subjects, 
2.7%) and Psychiatric disorders (16 subjects, 5.6% versus 11 subjects, 3.8%).  
OTHER SAFETY FINDINGS 
Abnormal  laboratory  values  were  evenly  distributed  between  both  treatment  groups.  No  clinical 
meaningful changes from baseline were observed in blood pressure and pulse rate. Possibly clinically 
significant weight decreases were observed in 13 (4.7%) subjects in the CBZ group and in 23 (8.6%) 
subjects  in  the  LEV  group.  Possibly  clinically  significant  weight  increases  were  observed  in  37 
(13.4%) subjects in the CBZ group versus 21 (7.8%) subjects in the LEV group. Similar numbers of 
occurrences  of  PCST  values  for  ECG  QTc  interval  were  reported  in  both  treatment  groups.  A 
complete review of the ECG recordings was performed by an external cardiologist for subjects from 
the LEV group presenting the most important changes. There was no evidence of any issues raising 
undue concern for findings of significant repolarization abnormalities. 
DISCUSSION ON CLINICAL SAFETY 
The incidence of TEAEs was similar in the two groups with 80.8 % of the patients in the CBZ group 
and  79.6  %  in  the  LEV  group  experiencing  at  least  one  TEAE.  The  spectrum  of  side  effects  differs 
between  LEV  and  CBZ,  with  a  more  frequent  occurrence  of  psychiatric  adverse  events  (including 
depression,  nervousness  and  insomnia)  in  the  LEV  group,  and  a  more  frequent  occurrence  of  skin 
reactions  and  some  gastrointestinal  events  (including  rash,  pruritus,  nausea,  vomiting)  in  the  CBZ 
group.  Further  to  CHMP  request,  the  MAH’s  review  of  suicidal  ideation  as  an  adverse  event  in 
patients exposed to LEV in the monotherapy studies (N01061, N01093, N01091 and N01127) has not 
provided  evidence  that,  in  this  limited  population,  an  increased  incidence  of  depression,  sleep 
disturbances, or irritability is linked to increased suicide ideation in patients treated with levetiracetam.  
Overall, the safety profile appears slightly more favourable in the LEV group with a lower percentage 
of patients discontinuing study drug in this group (14.4 % vs. 19.2 % for CBZ), a lower proportion of 
subjects experiencing at least one SAE during the randomised treatment period in the LEV group (6.3 
% vs. 10.0 %) and a lower proportion of subjects reporting at least one AE classified as severe (10.9 
%) subjects in the LEV group compared with the CBZ group (15.1%). It should be noted, however, 
14/15

that  a  lower  initial  dose  of  LEV  and  a  slower  rate  of  dose  titration  was  used  in  this  study  than  is 
currently recommended for LEV as adjunctive therapy.

Pharmacovigilance 
Risk management plan 
The CHMP did not require the MAH to submit a risk management plan because the safety profile of 
Keppra was considered unlikely to be different in monotherapy.   
6. 
Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment 
The  data  provided  support  the  efficacy  of  LEV  used  in  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  partial 
seizures  with  or  without  secondary  generalisation  in  patients  from  16  years  of  age  with  newly 
diagnosed epilepsy. LEV was shown to be non-inferior to the active comparator CBZ as the proportion 
of patients who were seizure-free for at least 6 months at their last evaluated dose was similar in the 
two groups in the primary analysis. 
The study also confirmed the safety profile of LEV observed in previous studies in subjects suffering 
from  various  epileptic  syndromes.  Overall,  the  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  was 
similar  in  both  groups,  but  the  spectrum  of  side  effects  differed  with  a  more  frequent  occurrence  of 
psychiatric adverse events (including depression, nervousness and insomnia) in the LEV group, and a 
higher frequency of some gastrointestinal events and allergic skin reactions including rash and pruritus 
in the CBZ group.  
In light of this favourable benefit/risk profile and the clarifications provided by the MAH, Keppra may 
be recommended as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with partial onset seizures with or 
without secondary generalisation in patients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy. The 
CHMP agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet.

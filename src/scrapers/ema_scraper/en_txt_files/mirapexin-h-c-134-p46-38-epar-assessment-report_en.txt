1  Introduction 
Paediatric Investigation Plans (PIP) for Sifrol and Mirapexin, pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate, 
were agreed by EMA on 12 September 2008. The conditions are combined vocal and multiple motor tic 
disorder (de la Tourette) and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). The granted waiver applies to preterm 
newborn infants, term newborn infants, infants and toddlers and children less than 6 years for both 
conditions. 
A deferral has been granted for the paediatric RLS study. The paediatric Committee (PCDO) had 
agreed that safety results from the paediatric Tourette’s Disorder development program and a positive 
risk benefit assessment for the potential lifetime dopaminergic treatment of RLS starting at childhood 
ages, should be available prior to starting the paediatric RLS study.  
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) also agreed to conduct a 30-week toxicity study in juvenile 
Rhesus monkeys as a follow-up measure. 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
Paediatric  studies  submitted  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as 
amended. 
The MAH submitted: 
 - The Final Report for clinical trial 248.642 titled: 
"An  open-label,  flexible  dose.  follow-up  study  to  evaluate  safety  and  efficacy  of  oral  pramipexole 
(0.0625-0.5  mg/day)  for  24  weeks  in  children  and  adolescents  (age  6-17  years)  diagnosed  with 
Tourette  Syndrome  according  to  DSM-IV  criteria  and  who  have  completed  the  double-blind  phase  of 
either study 248.641 or 248.644". 
and, 
- The Final Report for the non-clinical study U09-1156 titled: 
"Pramipexole:  Thirty-week  toxicity  study  in  juvenile  Rhesus  monkeys  followed  by  a  twelve-week 
recovery  period:  use  of  nonhuman  primate  model  for  studying  the  consequences  of  long-term 
dopaminergic receptor stimulation on complex brain functions using the NCTR operant battery".

2.1  Report for clinical trial 248.642 
Tourette’s Disorder 
Tourette’s Disorder is a neuropsychiatric disorder that is characterized by childhood onset of motor and 
phonic  tics.  A  dopaminergic  hyperfunction  in  certain  brain  areas  in  Tourette’s  Disorder  would  explain 
why  postsynaptic  dopamine  antagonists  such  as  antipsychotics  as  well  as  dopamine  agonists  with  a 
presynaptic component may be effective in suppressing tics associated with Tourette’s Disorder. 
From  epidemiological  studies it  seems likely  that  the  prevalence  of  Tourette’s  Disorder  in  the  general 
population ranges from 4.3 to 10 per 10,000. 
The  main  characteristics  of  Tourette’s  Disorder  appear  to  be  independent  of  culture  and,  in  general, 
symptoms  are  similar  worldwide.  Tourette’s  Disorder  is  found  in  all  countries,  all  racial  groups  and  is 
three to four times more common in males. 
The  age  range  for  this  paediatric  development  program  was  6-17  years,  inclusive.  This  age  range  is 
based on published data showing that onset of tics associated with Tourette’s Disorder generally occurs 
at the age of 6 years, with tics progressively worsening and showing the greatest severity at 10 years.

Clinical program as agreed in the PIP 
The following clinical studies in patients with Tourette’s Disorder were planned in line with the 
approved PIP: 
Study 248.644, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose study to evaluate efficacy 
and safety of pramipexole immediate release (IR) (0.0625-0.5 mg/day) vs. placebo for 6 weeks in 
children and adolescents (age 6-17 inclusive) diagnosed with Tourette’s Disorder according to 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV criteria. 
Study  248.642,  an  open-label,  flexible  dose  study  to  evaluate  efficacy  and  safety  of  pramipexole  IR 
(0.0625-0.5  mg/day)  for  24  weeks  in  children  and  adolescents  (age  6-17  inclusive)  diagnosed  with 
Tourette’s Disorder according to DSM IV criteria in those patients who have completed the double-blind 
phase of either Study 248.644 or 248.641. 
Study  248.641,  a  Phase  III,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  12-week  fixed  dose  trial  with 
pramipexole  0.125-0.5  mg/day  per  os  to  investigate  efficacy,  safety,  and  tolerability  and  safety  in 
children and adolescents (age 6-17 inclusive) diagnosed with Tourette’s Disorder according to DSM IV 
criteria. 
The  clinical  trial  report  for  study  248.644  was  submitted  in  January  2010.  Study  248.642  was 
prematurely  terminated  as  the  negative  results  of  study  248.644  had  become  available.  It  should  be 
noted  that  prior  to  the  initiation  of  Study  248.641,  the  program  was  cancelled,  so  all  patients  in  this 
study  had  completed  the  248.644  study.  The  clinical  trial  report  is  being  submitted  along  with  this 
critical expert overview. The planned Phase III study 248.641 will not commence due to the negative 
results of Study 248.644 and the termination of the paediatric Tourette’s program. 
Assessment comments: 
The  clinical  trial  report  for  study  248.644  was  submitted  and  assessed  as  part  of  a  type  II  variation 
(Sifrol II/56 and Mirapexin II/64). 
In  May  2010  CHMP  agreed  that  the  results  of  study  248.644  didn’t  indicate  any  efficacy  of 
prapmipexole  in  Tourette  Disorder  and  consequently  the  termination  of  the  Tourette’s  development 
programme was considered acceptable. 
In addition the negative efficacy (and safety) results of this study were included in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC by this variation. 
Conclusions for open-label study 248.642 
This study was important for the long-term evaluation of the safety and efficacy of pramipexole in the 
treatment of Tourette’s Disorder. The open-label trial design was appropriate for an extension study of 
patients  who  completed  one  of  the  double-blind  trials  (either  248.644  or  248.641).  The  study 
evaluated  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  pramipexole  over  a  24-week  period  in  children  and  adolescents 
diagnosed with Tourette’s Disorder. 
It was anticipated that 120 patients would be entered into the trial (this is approximately 60% of the 
total  number  of  patients  expected  to  have  entered  trials  248.641  and  248.644).  Due  to  the  early 
termination of the trial, a total of only 45 patients received at least one dose of study medication. The 
mean exposure to treatment was 128.1 days. The range of exposure was 22-184 days. 
As  this  trial  was  discontinued  prematurely,  enrolment  was  significantly  less  than  what  was  planned 
(120  planned  entered  vs.  45  actual  entered)  and  a  high  number  of  patients  (23  of  45,  51.1%)  were 
prematurely discontinued. Therefore, the objectives of this study could not be fully assessed. 
Assessment comments: 
In  accordance  with  the  assessment  of  study  248.644,  the  CHMP  considerd  the  above  discussion  and 
conclusion of the MAH acceptable.

Administration  of  pramipexole  resulted  mainly  in  functional  effects,  mainly  involving  the  CNS  in  both 
rats and Rhesus monkeys and the female reproductive system in the rat. Both effects are considered 
to result from an exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect of pramipexole. In rats (including juvenile) as 
well as Rhesus monkeys (including juvenile), clinical signs observed included somnolence, underactive 
as well as overactive behaviour and changes in motor or spontaneous activity. In the juvenile rat, the 
effects  at  the  end  of  the  treatment  period  on  learning  and  memory  at  4  or  20  mg/kg/day  were 
considered  to  be  related  to  the  changes  in  behaviour  with  regards  to  activity  that  were  seen  in 
association with treatment and were not present anymore at the end of recovery. Also, in the juvenile 
rat,  motor  activity  was  only  affected  at  the  very  high  dose  of  20  mg/kg/day.  No  clinically  relevant 
effects of pramipexole were observed in the study on fertility and early embryonic development or in 
the  study  on  pre-  and  postnatal  development  in  rats.  Results  of  the  studies  on  embryo-fetal 
development  in  rats  and  rabbits  did  not  indicate  a  compound-induced  teratogenic  effect. 
Embryo/fetotoxicity  was  found  in  the  rat  at  maternotoxic  doses.  In  the  juvenile  rat,  oestrous  cycles, 
mating  performance  and  fertility,  offspring  survival  and  development  were  not  affected  at  any  dose. 
The NOEL for reproductive performance was 0.5 mg/kg/day. With respect to the known class effects of 
dopaminergic agents, the NOAEL for prolactin levels and effects on the ovaries was 0.5 mg/kg/day in

the  juvenile  rat.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  role  of  prolactin  in  rodents  with  regard  to  hormonal 
regulation  and  affected  organs  is  different  than  that  in  humans:  in  the  rat,  prolactin  doubles  as  the 
luteotrophic hormone while in humans this function is assumed by luteinising hormone. Therefore, the 
above described findings in the rat are considered to be species-specific and of no biological relevance 
for  the  human  situation.  However,  given  the  different  physiological  function  in  man,  prolactin 
deficiency or hypoprolactinemia is not accompanied by severe side effects and therefore is not treated 
in clinical practice. In addition, decreased prolactin levels in the study in juvenile Rhesus monkeys at 
the higher doses had not induced any adverse effects on any of the hormones tested. 
A special focus for a dopamine agonist with regard to development is CNS. Special neuropathology was 
performed in the juvenile rat and juvenile monkey study. The NOAEL for neuropathology in the juvenile 
rat was 20 mg/kg/day, in the juvenile monkey 2 mg/kg/day.  
PK  data  in  paediatric  RLS  patients  are  available  (U08-3440).  Exposure  multiples  for  the  proposed 
highest  total  daily  dose  of  pramipexole  in  the  clinical  Tourette  Syndrome  program  were  estimated 
taking into account the PK results of Study 248.600 (U08-3440) and the plasma levels at the NOAEL 
(0.5  mg/kg/day)  from  the  30-week  study  in  juvenile  Rhesus  monkeys.  In  addition,  the  following 
assumptions were used a) the PK properties of pramipexole in paediatric Tourette Syndrome patients 
will not differ from that in RLS patients at the same age range; b) the body weight of at least 20 kg for 
a paediatric patient (at an age of six years); c) it had been planned that the maximum exposure in the 
proposed phase III study should not exceed 0.5 mg/day as the daily and 0.25 mg as a single dose (the 
daily dose of 0.5 mg/patient is equivalent to 0.025 mg/kg at a body weight of 20 kg). Based on these 
facts, the dose multiples for the maximum intended clinical dose in paediatric patients are ~80 based 
on C(max) and ~20 based on AUC. These exposure multiples were considered sufficient for the use of 
pramipexole in paediatric patients aged 6 years and older. 
Assessment comments: 
Pharmacodyamic  effects  on  brain  functions  were  observed  in  rats  and  monkeys  without  any 
histopathological changes. The dose-response seemed to be bell-shaped. Based on the monkey toxicity 
data  alone,  the  safety  margins  are  sufficient  for  the  proposed  daily  dose  to  children.  However,  rat 
toxicity  data  raises  a  concern  regarding  the  reproduction  performance  and  sexual  maturation.  The 
effects consisted of low plasma levels of oestradiol and prolactin (the latter also observed in monkeys), 
marked  delay  in vaginal opening  and  bodyweights  on  completion  of  opening,  slight  delay  in  preputial 
separation  and  bodyweight  at  completion, low  number  of  implantation  sites,  and  low  number  of  total 
and  live  litter  size.  The  safety  margin  for  the  effects  on  reproduction  performance  seems  to  be 
sufficient (AUC > 1000 ng.h/mL at the NOAEL of 4 mg/kg for low number of implantation sites, total 
and live litter size). The MAH assumed that the effect on preputial separation is attributed to a delay in 
physical  rather  than  sexual  maturation  due  to  the  low  body  weight  gain  during  dosing.  However,  the 
effect may be related to the effects on prolactin and vaginal opening. The MAH has suggested that the 
effects on prolactin (and ovarian weights) may be due to a species-specific effect of dopamine agonists 
on  hormone  secretion.  It  is  acknowledged  that  the  delay  of  preputial  separation  and  vaginal  opening 
may be due to a hormonal disturbance. However, a NOAEL could not be established with regards to the 
delay  in  vaginal  opening.  The  relevance  of  the  effects  on  prolactin,  oestradiol,  and  male  and  female 
maturation  for  the  sexual  development  in  human  children  dosed  with  pramipexole  is  not  known.  For 
these  reasons,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  following  statement  should  be  included  in  section  5.3  of 
the  SmPC,  e.g.,  “A  delay  in  sexual  development  (i.e.,  preputial  separation  and  vaginal  opening)  was 
observed in rats. The relevance for humans is unknown.” 
3  Overall Conclusion And further action required 
P46 040/P46 038 
Overall Conclusion: 
As outcome of this assessment, the CHMP requested that the MAH should update the Product 
Information as follows and to submit the corresponding variation within 2 months: 
In  section  5.3  of  the  SPC  should  be  stated,  e.g.,  “A  delay  in  sexual  development  (i.e.  preputial 
separation and vaginal opening) was observed in rats. The relevance for humans is unknown.”

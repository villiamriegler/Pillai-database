2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Ibrutinib is a first-in-class, potent, orally administered, covalently binding inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine 
kinase (BTK). It is authorized in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with: 
- 
relapsed or refractory MCL based on the Phase 2, open-label, monotherapy study with ibrutinib 560 
mg/day (Study 1104) ; 
Assessment report  
EMA/623036/2016 
Page 5/68 
 
  
  
 
 
-  CLL who have received at least 1 prior therapy, and as a single agent for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously untreated CLL, -  based on the Phase 3, open-label, randomized 
monotherapy study in which subjects received either ibrutinib 420 mg/day or ofatumumab (Study 
1112) and on the Phase 3 open-label randomized monotherapy study in which previously untreated 
subjects received either ibrutinib or chlorambucil. 
-  WM who have received at least 1 prior therapy or in first-line treatment for patients unsuitable for 
chemoimmunotherapy - based on the Phase 2, open-label, monotherapy study with ibrutinib 420 
mg/day (Study 1118E). 
The Applicant has been requested to provide the final clinical study reports (CSR) for Studies; PCI-
32765MCL3001 (MCL3001), PCI-32765MCL2001 (MCL2001), PCYC-1117-CA (1117) and PCI-
32765CLL3001 (CLL3001);  These additional studies were performed in adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory MCL and CLL,  in order to fulfil post authorisation measures and Annex II obligations.  
Studies in this application include the first randomized Phase 3 study of ibrutinib monotherapy in subjects 
with relapsed or refractory MCL (Study MCL3001) and the first randomized Phase 3 study of ibrutinib in 
combination with chemoimmunotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL (Study CLL3001). 
Phase 2 studies in subjects with relapsed or refractory MCL (Study MCL2001) and relapsed or refractory 
CLL with del17p (Study 1117) are also included in this submission. In addition, data from 2 studies 
supportive of the use of ibrutinib combination therapy are also presented (Studies 1108 and 1109).  
Based on the results of these studies changes have been proposed to the SmPC and Package Leaflet. In 
Annex II, the PCI-32765MCL3001 study has been deleted from the list of post-authorisation obligations. 
In addition the Applicant has taken the opportunity to make minor editorial amendments to the SmPC. 
The revised RMP version 5.1 has been included in the submission. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The previously available population pharmacokinetic model (included in original MAA) was updated with 
data from the studies included in this submission. The updated population pharmacokinetic analysis was 
submitted through a separate procedure (variation II/20).  
Systemic exposure data, collected using a sparse sampling scheme in all studies included in this 
submission, showed substantial overlap of observed and predicted exposure values based on the previous 
population pharmacokinetic model, indicating that the pharmacokinetic behaviour was consistent with the 
previous assessments.  
In study CLL3001 (a phase 3 combination study with bendamustine and rituximab), sparse 
pharmacokinetic samples were collected at selected sites to assess whether there was an effect of 
ibrutinib on the pharmacokinetic profiles of bendamustine or rituximab. The pharmacokinetic report from 
this study was submitted separately (variation II/20). In this study, the systemic exposure of rituximab 
was higher in subjects receiving ibrutinib compared to those receiving placebo. Pre-dose serum 
concentrations were on average 2- to 3-fold higher in the first three cycles and 1.17- to 1.71-fold higher 
in the subsequent cycles. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
After assessment of the primary MAA, there were some remaining uncertainties regarding the potential of 
ibrutinib to induce CYP1A2.  As part of a relevant post authorisation measure, the MAH submitted a new 
in vitro induction study indicating no potential for induction of CYP1A2. The data from study CLL3001 
showed no effect of ibrutinib on bendamustine, a CYP1A2 substrate, at 1, 2, 3 and 4-8 hr post-dose. 
Although it is unclear whether bendamustine is sensitive to CYP1A2 induction in vivo (no interaction data 
of bendamustine with a known inducer appears to be published), the data from CLL3001 does not 
contradict the conclusion from the in vitro study.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
An assessment of the pharmacokinetic data from the studies included in this submission was performed 
as a separate variation II/20.  
It is agreed that the effect of ibrutinib treatment on rituximab concentrations is likely not a drug-drug 
interaction but might possibly be a secondary effect due to increased response and thereby lower target-
mediated clearance of rituximab in the ibrutinib arm. Therefore, no change to section 4.5 of the SmPC on 
the effect of ibrutinib on rituximab is required. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion, the updated population pharmacokinetic analysis and the analysis of the interaction with 
bendamustine/rituximab do not affect previous conclusions on ibrutinib pharmacokinetics, dose 
adjustments or interaction potential. Therefore, the SmPC remains unchanged with regards to the clinical 
pharmacology aspects.

the stopping guideline was updated for efficacy (1-sided p-value of 0.007). The Sponsor Steering 
Committee was notified that the pre-specified statistical boundary for early stopping was crossed (p-value 
<0.0001 for the primary endpoint PFS). The DMC recommended unblinding the study.

Ancillary analyses 
Disease-related Symptoms 
There were no overall clinically relevant shifts in disease-related symptoms (fatigue, night sweats, weight 
loss, fever, and abdominal discomfort due to splenomegaly, anorexia) 
Immunoglobulin Effects 
No clinically meaningful differences in IgA, IgG and IgM) were observed between the treatment groups.  
Patient-reported Outcomes 
During the Treatment Phase, the overall compliance rates for each of the patient-reported outcomes 
measured (FACIT-Fatigue, EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CLL 16, and EQ-5D- 
5L) were acceptable with <10% missing at most time points administered. 
Mean summary scores for the FACIT-fatigue, EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CLL 16 Individual Items, and 
EQ-5D-5L utility values and visual analogue scale scores were similar for each treatment group at 
baseline.  
No notable mean changes from baseline over time were observed in the scores within or between the 
treatment groups. Times to improvement and deterioration in patient-reported outcome scores were 
similar for each treatment group.  
Supportive studies 
Study 1108: Phase 1b Study in Combination with BR 
A Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group safety study of ibrutinib in combination with 
chemoimmunotherapy in subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma 
Ibrutinib 420 mg was administered orally once daily in combination with intravenous bendamustine 70 
mg/m2 and intravenous rituximab 375 to 500 mg/m2 (n=30). The  safety and tolerability profiles were 
similar to historical data for BR regimens. The high overall response rate of 93.3% compares favorably to 
historrical data.

Study 1109  
An open-label, Phase 1b/2, safety and efficacy study of ibrutinib and ofatumumab in subjects with 
relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and prolymphocytic 
leukemia. 
MAH’s conclusions: The study results indicate that ibrutinib, when administered at an oral dose of 420 
mg/day in combination with a standard regimen of ofatumumab, was well tolerated and highly active 
(ORR 81.7% across the three dosing sequences) in this study for subjects with heavily pre-treated 
relapsed or refractory CLL, SLL, PLL, or RT. With the exception of a higher rate of peripheral sensory 
neuropathy, the observed safety profile of the combined treatment regimen is consistent with the 
individual profiles of ibrutinib and ofatumumab. Most subjects (76.1%) continued ibrutinib treatment in a 
long-term extension study.   
Study 1117 
A Single-arm, Multicenter Phase 2 Study of Ibrutinib 420 mg daily in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma with 17p Deletion. 
A total of 144 subjects received at least 1 dose of ibrutinib and represents the analysis set for both 
efficacy and safety in this study (ie, all treated population). 
Primary Endpoint – The ORR per IRC assessment was 63.9% with 95% CI (55.8%, 71.3%).  
Duration of Response: At the time of data cut, 83.7% of responders were alive and did not have disease 
progression; the estimated median DOR per IRC was 13.2 months (95% CI: 13.2, NE).

•  Required anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists or treatment with a 
strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor. 
Treatments 
Subjects randomized to Treatment A received 560 mg oral ibrutinib once daily continuously during the 
21-day cycle.  
Subjects randomized to Treatment B received temsirolimus IV infusion 175 mg on Days 1, 8, and 15 of 
the first cycle followed by 75 mg on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each subsequent 21-day cycle.  
Treatment on both arms continued until disease progression (or relapse if the subject achieved a CR), 
or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurred first. 
Objectives 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Endpoints 
Primary endpoint: PFS assessed by IRC and performed on the ITT population. The IRC was blinded to 
study treatment assignment, and both the IRC and the site performed disease evaluations according to 
the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007).  
Disease evaluations included CT, MRI, PET, and clinical evaluation performed every 9 weeks for up to 15 
months from the start of study drug, and every 24 weeks thereafter. Whole body FDG-PET scan (skull 
base to the proximal femur) will be done at Screening. For subjects who are PET-positive at baseline, PET 
will be done at the time of maximal tumor reduction (eg, CR or PR with 2 consecutive CT scans showing 
no further tumor reduction). In addition, PET will be performed at suspected disease progression, if a new 
lesion was detected on CT. 
Key secondary endpoints: ORR, OS, 1-year survival rate, duration of response, time to response, time 
to next treatment, and time to worsening in the Lym subscale of the FACT-Lym. 
Important exploratory endpoint: PFS2 (defined as the time interval between the date of 
randomization to the date of an event, defined as progressive disease as assessed by the investigator 
after the next line of subsequent therapy, death from any cause, or start of the second line of subsequent 
therapy if no disease progression is noted).

Statistical methods 
Key statistical elements 
Open design, central 1:1 randomisation stratified by the number of prior lines of therapy (1 or 2 versus ≥
3) and simplified MCL international prognostic index (MIPI; low risk [0-3]; versus intermediate risk [4-5]; 
versus high risk [6-11]).  
The study was planned to enroll approximately 280 subjects (about 140 subjects to each arm) to observe 
178 PFS events at the primary analysis. Assuming 57% improvement in median PFS of the ibrutinib arm 
over the temsirolimus arm (a hazard ratio of 0.64 for the ibrutinib relative to temsirolimus arm, under the 
exponential distribution assumption, or for example, an improvement in median PFS from 7 months to 11 
months), with 178 events the study has at least 85% power to achieve a statistical significance level of 
2.5% (1-sided). 
Statistical hypothesis testing for secondary endpoints was performed in a hierarchical manner with an 
alpha level of 0.05 in the order of ORR, OS, time to next treatment, and time to worsening in the Lym 
subscale of the FACT-Lym assessment. 
The end of study is defined as when 80% of the randomized subjects died, or 3 years after the last 
subject was randomized, or the sponsor terminates the study, whichever comes first.

Worsening was defined by a 5-point decrease from baseline. The overall compliance rates for the patient-
reported outcomes measured (FACT-Lym and EQ-5D-5L) were <10% missing at most time points 
administered. The temsirolimus arm showed a lower compliance rate (by 5 to 10% compared with the 
ibrutinib arm) at most timepoints. The most common reason for the lower compliance rate was 
“administrative failure”. Mean summary scores were similar for each treatment arm at baseline.

Endpoints 
Primary endpoint: ORR, defined as the proportion of evaluable subjects who achieved CR or PR as 
assessed by the IRC based upon the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. 
Disease evaluations included CT, MRI, PET, and clinical evaluation performed every 9 weeks for up to 15 
months from the start of study drug, and every 24 weeks thereafter. Whole body FDG-PET scan (skull 
base to the proximal femur) will be done at Screening. For subjects who are PET-positive at baseline, PET 
will be done at the time of maximal tumor reduction (eg, CR or PR with 2 consecutive CT scans showing 
no further tumor reduction). In addition, PET will be performed at suspected disease progression, if a new 
lesion was detected on CT. 
Key secondary endpoints: Time to initial response/best response for subjects who achieved CR/PR, 
duration of response, PFS as determined by the IRC, OS. 
Key statistical elements 
Single arm design. The sample size for this study was based on the assumption that the ORR for ibrutinib 
would be 56%, which was the lowest observed response rate in all subgroups analyzed from the 
then ongoing Phase 2 study, PCYC-1104-CA. With 101 evaluable subjects, the study was expected 
to have 90% power to declare that ORR was 40% or higher at the 1-sided significance level of 0.025. No 
interim analysis. The final analysis for ORR was to be conducted using a clinical cutoff date approximately 
1 year after enrollment of the last subject. End of study occurred approximately 2 years after the last 
subject was enrolled. 
With amendment INT-2 (28 August 2013; 120 subjects = fully enrolled), the clinical cutoff for the primary 
analysis was changed from 6 months to approximately 1 year after the last subject was enrolled.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
CLL studies 
Ibrutinib is currently licensed “for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy, and as a single agent for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously untreated CLL ”. This submission aims at providing the results of the pivotal 
study CLL3001, a placebo controlled add-on study to bendamustine + rituximab (BR) in patients with R/R 
CLL or SLL, and other supportive studies as foreseen at the time of the approval and agreed as part of 
the post- authorisation programme of ibrutinib.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The median/mean ages at enrolment were 64/64 and about 30% of patients were >70 years of age. The 
efficacy of ibrutinib in patients previously treated for CLL were further evaluated in a randomised, 
multicenter, double-blinded phase 3 study of IMBRUVICA in combination with BR versus placebo + BR 
(Study CLL3001). Patients (n = 578) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily or 
placebo in combination with BR until disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. All patients received 
BR for a maximum of six 28-day cycles. Bendamustine was dosed at 70 mg/m2 infused IV over 
30 minutes on Cycle 1, Days 2 and 3, and on Cycles 2-6, Days 1 and 2 for up to 6 cycles. Rituximab was 
administered at a dose of 375 mg/m2 in the first cycle, Day 1, and 500 mg/m2 Cycles 2 through 6, Day 1. 
Ninety patients randomised to placebo + BR crossed over to receive IMBRUVICA following IRC confirmed 
progression. The median age was 64 years (range, 31 to 86 years), 66% were male, and 91% were 
Caucasian. All patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The median time since 
diagnosis was 6 years and the median number of prior treatments was 2 (range, 1 to 11 treatments). At 
baseline, 56% of patients had at least one tumour ≥ 5 cm, 26% had del11q. 
CLL3001 enrolled patients with R/R CLL/SLL. About 50% of patients had received one line of prior therapy 
and about 25% were refractory to purine analogues. Due to the selected background therapy, patients 
with del.17p positive CLL/SLL were excluded. 
The supportive Study 1108 provides supportive single arm evidence as regards the activity and safety of 
ibrutinib as add-on to BR. Study 1109, exploring the combination ofatumumab and ibrutinib, is of minor 
relevance for this submission whilst the single arm, monotherapy study 1117 provides further 
confirmation of the efficacy of ibrutinib in case of CLL with del 17p.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Submitted data refer to an interim analysis conducted at a PFS event rate about 20 and 60%, i.e. at a 
higher event rate than originally planned for. Expressed as PFS HRs the treatment difference was about 
0.02 at a p-value <0.001. The main difference in terms of PFS events was observed after end of induction 
therapy.  
The reported ORRs (IRC) were 83% vs. 68%, p-value <0.0001. 
At event rates of 9% and 14%, there is a trend towards improved survival HR 0.63, p-value 0.06.  
An increase in MRD negativity was reported in the experimental arm, 13% vs. 5% p-value 0.001 (to be 
viewed as exploratory due to hierarchical testing procedure).   
The interim analysis was conducted at a low event rate in the ibrutinib arm, meaning that the stability of 
the PFS event curve is ill defined. Based on prior monotherapy studies, however, it is accepted that 
ibrutinib show durable responses. A formal issue is that the interim was conducted at a higher event rate 
than planned (OC). 
Assessment report  
EMA/623036/2016 
Page 44/68 
 
  
  
Submitted subgroup analyses are compatible with consistent add-on activity, but the low event rate in 
the ibrutinib arm undermines firm conclusions. ORR data grouped according to the co-variates used in the 
PFS subgroup analyses might provide some insights as regards possible heterogeneity (OC).  
The main difference between study arms develops during the maintenance phase comparing ibrutinib in 
mono-therapy with placebo. This means that events of PD have different meaning in the two study arms. 
A PFS2 analysis has therefore been submitted. The event rates in this analysis were as expected low, 10 
vs. 17%, HR 0.53, p-value 0.006 (exploratory). Based on the results of the interim analysis, the DMC 
recommended unblinding of the study  
At this stage OS data cannot be used to support conclusions as regards long term benefit. The study was 
also opened to cross-over to ibrutinib in January 2014 when all patients were enrolled.  
The prognostic value of MRD negativity relies on data  from patients who have been off therapy for some 
months. Its value in patients on therapy is non-established. A comparison of ORR including MRD 
negativity after end of induction therapy might nevertheless be informative (OC) about the value of 
ibrutinib during the induction phase.  
Mantle Cell Lymphoma studies 
The final CSRs for study MCL3001 and MCL2001 have been provided in support of the current indication 
as foreseen at the time of the approval and agreed as part of the post- authorisation programme of 
ibrutinib in r/r MCL. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of ibrutinib in MCL was further studied in a randomised phase 3, open-label, multicenter 
study including 280 patients with MCL who received at least one prior therapy (Study MCL3001). Patients 
(n=280) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA orally at 560 mg once daily for 21 days or 
temsirolimus intravenously at 175 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 of the first cycle followed by 75 mg on Days 1, 8, 
15 of each subsequent 21-day cycle. Treatment on both arms continued until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. The median age was 68 years (range, 34; 88), 74% were male and 87% were 
Caucasian. The median time since diagnosis was 43 months, and median number of prior treatments was 
2 (range: 1 to 9 treatments), including 51% with prior high-dose chemotherapy, 18% with prior 
bortezomib, 5% with prior lenalidomide, and 24% with prior stem cell transplant. At baseline, 53% of 
patients had bulky disease (≥ 5 cm), 21% had high-risk score by Simplified MIPI, 60% had extranodal 
disease and 54% had bone marrow involvement at screening. Progression-free survival (PFS) was 
assessed by IRC according to the revised International Working Group (IWG) for non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (NHL) criteria. 
MCL2001 was a Phase 2, open-label, monotherapy study in r/r MCL after at least one prior rituximab-
containing chemotherapy regimen and documented PD after at least 2 cycles of single-agent 
or combination bortezomib therapy (n=120). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the MCL3001 study, PFS by IRC, the primary outcome measure, showed a HR of 0.43 in favour of the 
ibrutinib arm, p<0.0001, with mature data in the temsirolimus arm (79%). The median PFS was 14.6 
(10.4, NE) months in the ibrutinib arm compared to 6.2 (4.2, 7.9) months in the temsirolimus arm. 
Sensitivity analyses and secondary outcomes, as well as PFS2, were all supportive.  
A smaller proportion of patients treated with ibrutinib experienced a clinically meaningful worsening of 
lymphoma symptoms versus temsirolimus (27% versus 52%) and time to worsening of symptoms 
occurred more slowly with ibrutinib versus temsirolimus (HR 0.27, p < 0.0001). 
Assessment report  
EMA/623036/2016 
Page 45/68 
 
  
  
In the MCL2001 study, ORR by IRC, the primary outcome measure, was 63% for the response-evaluable 
population, with a CR rate of 21%, and 57% for the all-treated population. At the final analysis by 
investigator, with a median follow-up of 26.7 months, ORR was unchanged but the fraction of patients 
with CR had increased from 18% at the time of the cut-off for the primary analysis to 24.5%. At the 
primary cutoff and with 33% events the median DOR by IRC was approximately 15 months. At the final 
analysis by investigator, with a median follow-up of 26.7 months, DOR had increased from 12.9 months 
at the time of the primary analysis to 21.3 months. 
Looking at activity in terms of response rates with ibrutinib across the MCL studies, the ORR was 72% in 
MCL3001 (vs 40.4 % in the temsirolimus arm), 63% in MCL2001 and 68% in 1104. 
Inspection of the KM curve for PFS in study MCL3001 reveals a slightly higher event rate in the ibrutinib 
arm vs the temsirolimus arm for the first approximately 2 months and a separate analysis for the first 3 
months, with PD and deaths addressed separately, was provided. 
A smaller proportion of patients treated with ibrutinib experienced a clinically meaningful worsening of 
lymphoma symptoms versus temsirolimus (27% versus 52%) and time to worsening of symptoms 
occurred more slowly with ibrutinib versus temsirolimus (HR 0.27, p < 0.0001). The rationale for the 
definition of clinically meaningful worsening in the Lym subscale of the FACT-Lym assessment as a 5-
point decrease from baseline in the MCL3001 study was justified. 
Due to small subject numbers in several groups and the uncontrolled setting in MCL2001, subgroup data 
should be interpreted with caution. The analyses may, however, indicate a potentially lower activity in 
high risk disease and in blastoid histology. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results of the submitted study CLL3001 demonstrate the efficacy of ibrutinib as add-on to the 
rituximab – bendamustine regimen as PFS favoured the ibrutinib arm with a HR for PFS estimated at 0.2 
[95% CI; 0.15, 0.28] (median PFS not reached for ibrutinib arm). As the studies supporting the CLL 
indication granted at the time of the Marketing Authorisation included use of ibrutinib as single agent, the 
CLL indication is extended to the use of ibrutinib in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR). 
The results from the MCL studies submitted, confirm the efficacy of ibrutinib in the approved indication of 
MCL as PFS with ibrutinib was 14.6 (10.4, NE) as compared to 6.2 (4.2, 7.9) months in the temsirolimus 
group with HR of 0.43 [95% CI: 0.32, 0.58].  
Study resuts were included under section 5.1 of the SmPC. The indication section was revised to include 
the combination of ibrutinib with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) for the treatment of adult patients 
with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy and to specify where appropriate the use of  
ibrutinib as a single agent.

ibrutinib+BR treatment group and 4.2% of subjects in the placebo+BR treatment group. Grade 3 or 4 
events were reported for 6 (2.1%) subjects in the ibrutinib+BR treatment group; no events were fatal.  
In the placebo+BR treatment group, 4 (1.4%) subjects had Grade 3 or 4 events; and 1 subject had fatal 
hepatobiliary events (cholestasis and hepatocellular injury).

Of the 15 subjects in the ibrutinib arm who were reported with a TEAE leading to death, 6 subjects had 
progressive disease as their primary cause of death and are counted in that category in Table 22. Of the 
11 subjects in the temsirolimus arm who were reported with a TEAE leading to death, 3 subjects had 
progressive disease as their primary cause of death and are counted in that category in Table 22.  
During the first 6 months of treatment, 8 subjects (5.8%) in the ibrutinib arm and 11 subjects (7.9%) in 
the temsirolimus arm had a TEAE with an outcome of death. When adjusted for exposure differences 
between the treatment arms, the incidence rate for TEAEs leading to death was 0.811 per 100 patient-
months for the ibrutinib arm and 1.299 for the temsirolimus arm.

SAEs 
The 4 patients with multiorgan failure noted in the ibrutinib arm were all assessed with progressive 
disease concurrently or immediately prior to the multi-organ failure event. 
For the pleural effusion cases, 2 subjects had a concurrent infection (1 pneumonia, 1 tuberculosis) 
and the other subject had a history of “pleurisy” and tuberculosis with no clear etiology for the 
event. All subjects resumed treatment for at least 6 months with the pleural effusion event reported 
as recovered/resolved.

patient-months for the ibrutinib arm and 1.077 events per 100 patient-months for the temsirolimus 
arm. A major bleeding event was reported for 8 subjects (5.8%) in the ibrutinib arm and for 6 
subjects (4.3%) in the temsirolimus arm during the first 6 months of drug treatment. One subject in the 
ibrutinib arm died with a cause of death reported as subdural hematoma. 
•

•  Other malignancies 
•  Ocular events 
Serious Grade 3-4 events were reported for 2 subjects in the ibrutinib arm (1 subject with diabetic 
retinopathy and 1 subject with vitreous hemorrhage) and 1 subject in the temsirolimus arm with 
cataract.  
The EAIR for the Eye disorder SOC was 1.919 events per 100 patient-months for the ibrutinib arm and 
3.403 events per 100 patient-months for the temsirolimus arm. The EAIR for conjunctivitis was 0.968 
events per 100 patient-months for the ibrutinib arm and 0.878 events per 100 patient-months for the 
temsirolimus arm.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events (all grades) from the Eye disorders SOC were reported for 17 
subjects (12.2%) from each treatment arm during the first 6 months of drug treatment. Conjunctivitis 
was reported for 11 subjects (7.9%) in the ibrutinib arm and for 5 subjects (3.6%) in the temsirolimus 
arm during the first 6 months of drug treatment. 
•  Hypertension 
The EAIR for hypertension were 0.571 events per 100 patient-months for the ibrutinib arm and 0.614 
events per 100 patient-months for the temsirolimus arm. 
Hypertension was reported for 6 subjects (4.3%) in the ibrutinib arm and for 3 subjects (2.2%) in the 
temsirolimus arm during the first 6 months of drug treatment. 
•  Hepatic AEs 
Three subjects (2.2%) in the ibrutinib treatment arm met the laboratory criteria for potential drug-
induced liver injury (DILI) based on ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin laboratory 
abnormalities (Hy’s Law). However, one event occurred in the setting of septic shock and disease 
progression, and one in the context of hepatitis B reactivation (day 340, 11 days after the last dose of 
ibrutinib) with obviously negative rechallenge. No clear alternative aetiology is reported for the 3rd event 
but the patient had a negative rechallenge. 
The EAIR for the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC was 0.338 events per 100 patient-months for the ibrutinib 
arm and 0.478 events per 100 patient-months for the temsirolimus arm.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events from the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC were reported for 4 subjects 
(2.9%) from the ibrutinib arm and for 3 subjects (2.2%) from the temsirolimus arm during the first 6 
months of drug treatment.

•  AEs in relation to age (<65 versus ≥65 years) 
The incidences of any grade TEAE, drug-related TEAEs, TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and 
TEAEs leading to death were similar (<10% difference) between the age groups for both the ibrutinib and 
temsirolimus treatment arms.  
For the ibrutinib arm, incidences were higher (>10% difference) for subjects ≥65 years for Grade ≥3 
TEAEs (72.1% versus 60.4%), any serious TEAE (52.3% versus 41.5%), and drug-related serious TEAEs 
(25.6% versus 13.2%). 
• 
Treatment-related lymphocytosis 
Treatment-related lymphocytosis was reported for 52 subjects (38.2%) in the ibrutinib arm and for 31 
subjects (22.6%) in the temsirolimus arm. The median time to lymphocytosis was 3.14 weeks for 
subjects in the ibrutinib arm and 2.86 weeks in the temsirolimus arm. Most events in the ibrutinib arm 
resolved (43 of the 52 subjects) with a median duration of 6.14 weeks.

TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation – Study MCL3001 
TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported for 12.9% of subjects in the ibrutinib arm and 
29.5% of subjects in the temsirolimus arm. Serious TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were 
reported for 8.6% of subjects in the ibrutinib arm and 14.4% of subjects in the temsirolimus arm. 
TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation in more than one patient were thrombocytopenia (3) 
abdominal pain (2) and pneumonia (2) in the ibrutinib arm, and fatigue (7), thrombocytopenia (4), 
pneumonitis (4), neutropenia (3), oedema peripheral (3), asthenia (3), pneumonia (2), confusional state 
(2), decreased appetite (2), mucosal inflammation (2), pyrexia (2) and rash (2) in the temsirolimus arm. 
TEAEs leading to dose reduction – Study MCL3001 
TEAEs leading to dose reduction were reported for 3.6% of patients on the ibrutinib arm and 43.2% of 
patients on the temsirolimus arm. In the ibrutinib arm, no event was reported in more than 1 patient. 
Exposure-adjusted Incidence Rates – Study MCL3001 
An exposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) analysis was performed to explore the influence of 
differences in drug exposure (median exposures: ibrutinib arm = 14.39 months; temsirolimus arm = 3.02 
months) in summarising TEAEs that occurred up to 30 days from the last dose of study drug. An EAIR is 
reported as the incidence rate per 100 patient-months at risk. 
The most frequently reported SOCs by EAIR (per 100 patient-months) were Infections and infestations 
(ibrutinib: 11.68 all grades, 1.64 Grade ≥3; temsirolimus: 30.34 all grades, 5.69 Grade ≥3), 
Gastrointestinal disorders (ibrutinib: 8.19 all grades, 0.79 Grade ≥3; temsirolimus: 33.36 all grades, 3.38 
Grade ≥3), General disorders and administration site conditions (ibrutinib: 6.62 all grades, 0.84 Grade ≥3; 
temsirolimus: 26.92 all grades, 3.77 Grade ≥3), and Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders 
(ibrutinib: 5.95 all grades, 0.90 Grade ≥3; temsirolimus: 19.01 all grades, 2.28 Grade ≥3).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the CLL studies there was an overall moderate degree of ADR related to the add-on of ibrutinib; in 
terms of AEs leading to treatment discontinuations, 14% vs. 12% and in terms of dose reductions 9% vs. 
7%. The ADR the profile in the combination arm looks essentially as expected based on the combination 
of the profiles of BR and ibrutinib alone. Thus the components were administered at the same dos 
intensity as used for ibrutinib and BR alone.  
Regarding the data in MCL, it should be noted that treatment duration was substantially different between 
the study arms in MCL3001, median 14.4 months for the ibrutinib arm and 3 months for the temsirolimus 
arm (21 vs 5 cycles), with obvious impact on AE rates. Nevertheless, all TEAE categories (grade≥3, 
TESAE etc), except for outcome with death, were numerically more commonly reported in the 
temsirolimus arm. TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 12.9% of patients in the 
ibrutinib arm and 29.5% in the temsirolimus arm. When the analysis was restricted to the first 6 months 
of treatment, the differences between study arms were larger, and TEAEs with outcome of death 
numerically slightly lower in the ibrutinib arm. The latter outcome was also supported by an exposure 
time-adjusted analysis. 
No new ADRs were identified, except muscle spasm and hypertension that were recently added as new 
ADRs through the type II variation for a broader first line indication in CLL.  
The median time to atrial fibrillation/flutter was shorter in the Additional monotherapy studies (61 days; 
n=31) as sompared to the Current monotherapy label pool (91 days; n=29). 
Based on the additional data provided with this submission the MAH proposes a revised list of ADRs for 
inclusion in SmPC 4.8. Except from revision of incidence information for some ADRs, dehydration, dry 
mouth and anemia are suggested to be removed. This is considered acceptable.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety of ibrutinib as observed in the submitted studies is in line with the already known profile and 
no new or unexpected findings were revealed. The list of ADRs under SmPC section 4.8 was revised in 
terms of changes to the incidence for some ADRs, and the removal of dehydration, dry mouth and 
anaemia. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP): 
The PRAC considered that the RMP version 5.1 (dated 10 November 2015) is acceptable, as described in 
the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur revised assessment report dated 18 February 2016. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The PRAC and CHMP also endorsed RMP version 6.0.1 (dated 12 July 2016), combining the RMP versions 
6.0 (dated 24 June 2016) and 5.1, approved within variations II-24/G (positive CHMP opinion received on 
21 July 2016) and II-17/G, respectively, with the following contents.

The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and the Annex II 
have been updated. In addition, a minor editorial change was made to section 4.5 of the SmPC. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No user consultation on the Package Leaflet was conducted as the changes to the Package Leaflet were 
considered minor. This is acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
CLL3001 enrolled patients with R/R CLL/SLL. About 50% of patients had received one line of prior therapy 
and about 25% were refractory to purine analogues. Due to the selected background therapy, patients 
with del.17p positive CLL/SLL were excluded. The median/mean ages at enrolment were 64/64 and about 
30% of patients were >70 years of age.  
Submitted data refer to an interim analysis conducted at a PFS event rate about 20 and 60%, i.e. at a 
higher event rate than originally planned for. Expressed as PFS HRs the treatment difference was about 
0.02 at a p-value <0.001. The main difference in terms of PFS events was observed after end of induction 
therapy. The reported ORRs (IRC) were 83% vs. 68%, p-value <0.0001. A PFS2 analysis has been 
submitted. The event rates in this analysis were as expected low, 10 vs. 17%, HR 0.53, p-value 0.006 
(exploratory). Based on the results of the interim analysis, the DMC recommended unblinding of the 
study.  
At event rates of 9% and 14%, there is a trend towards improved survival with HR 0.63, p-value 0.06. An 
increase in MRD negativity was reported in the experimental arm, 13% vs. 5% p-value 0.001 (to be 
viewed as exploratory due to hierarchical testing procedure).   
The supportive Study 1108 provides supportive single arm evidence as regards the activity and safety of 
ibrutinib as add-on to BR. Study 1109, exploring the combination ofatumumab and ibrutinib, is of minor 
relevance for this submission whilst the single arm, monotherapy study 1117 provides further 
confirmation of the efficacy of ibrutinib in case of CLL with del 17p.  
The final CSRs for study MCL3001 and MCL2001 have been provided in support of the current indication 
in r/r MCL. MCL3001 was a Phase 3, open-label, randomised monotherapy study comparing ibrutinib with 
temsirolimus in r/r MCL after at least one prior rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimen (n=280, 1:1 
randomisation). MCL2001 was a Phase 2, open-label, monotherapy study in r/r MCL after at least one 
prior rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimen and documented PD after at least 2 cycles of single-

In the MCL3001 study, PFS by IRC, the primary outcome measure, showed a HR of 0.428 in favour of the 
ibrutinib arm, p<0.0001, with mature data in the temsirolimus arm (79%). Sensitivity analyses and 
secondary outcomes, as well as PFS2, were all supportive. 
In the MCL2001 study, ORR by IRC, the primary outcome measure, was 63% for the response-evaluable 
population, with a CR rate of 21%, and 57% for the all-treated population. At the final analysis by 
investigator, with a median follow-up of 26.7 months, ORR was unchanged but the fraction of patients 
with CR had increased from 18% at the time of the cutoff for the primary analysis to 24.5%. At the 
primary cutoff and with 33% events the median DOR by IRC was approximately 15 months. At the final 
analysis by investigator, with a median follow-up of 26.7 months, DOR had increased from 12.9 months 
at the time of the primary analysis to 21.3 months. 
Looking at activity in terms of response rates with ibrutinib across the MCL studies, the ORR was 72% in 
MCL3001, 63% in MCL2001 and 68% in 1104.  
Overall the data submitted confirm the benefit observed with ibrutinib in the approved indications. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The interim analysis was conducted at a low event rate in the ibrutinib arm in the CLL study, therefore 
the PFS event curve is not well established, however based on prior monotherapy studies, however, it is 
accepted that ibrutinib shows durable responses. At this stage OS data cannot be used to support 
conclusions as the study was open to cross-over to ibrutinib at the time of patients’ enrolment.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
There was an overall moderate degree of ADR related to the add-on of ibrutinib; in terms of AEs leading 
to treatment discontinuations, 14% vs. 12% and in terms of dose reductions 9% vs. 7%. The ADR profile 
in the combination arm looks essentially as expected based on the combination of the profiles of BR and 
ibrutinib alone. Thus the components were administered at the same dose intensity as used for ibrutinib 
and BR alone.  
It should be noted that treatment duration was substantially different between the study arms in 
MCL3001, median 14.4 months for the ibrutinib arm and 3 months for the temsirolimus arm (21 vs 5 
cycles), with obvious impact on AE rates. Nevertheless, all TEAE categories (grade≥3, TESAE etc), except 
for outcome with death, were numerically more commonly reported in the temsirolimus arm. TEAEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 12.9% of patients in the ibrutinib arm and 29.5% in 
the temsirolimus arm. When the analysis was restricted to the first 6 months of treatment, the 
differences between study arms were larger, and TEAEs with outcome of death numerically slightly lower 
in the ibrutinib arm. The latter outcome was also supported by an exposure time-adjusted analysis. 
No new ADRs were identified, except muscle spasm and hypertension that were proposed as new ADRs in 
the ongoing type II variation for a broader first line indication in CLL. 
The median time to atrial fibrillation/flutter was shorter in the additional monotherapy studies (61 days; 
n=31) as compared to the current monotherapy label pool (91 days; n=29). 
Based on the additional data provided with this submission the MAH proposes a revised list of ADRs for 
inclusion in SmPC 4.8. Except from revision of incidence information for some ADRs, dehydration, dry 
mouth and anemia are suggested to be removed, which is considered acceptable.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There were no further uncertainties resulting from the assessment of the submitted studies. 
Benefit Risk  
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The results from studies conducted in the CLL indication were considered of high clinical relevance. The 
results provided reconfirm the importance of the benefits of ibrutinib in the CLL and MCL approved 
indications as discussed in the original application.  
Clinically relevant results were observed in patients with MCL treated with ibrutinib monotherapy in the 
original application for a marketing authorisation and although the pivotal study was a single arm study, 
the dramatic activity seen in terms of ORR, and DOR was considered unprecedented historically and 
sufficiently important in this heavily pre-treated patient population to support approval. Having now these 
results confirmed by the comparison of ibrutinib to temsirolimus is an additional reassurance to their 
importance. 
The safety data are in line with the so far known safety profile. Subject to additional scrutiny through this 
assessment, some modifications of the ADRs incidences were implemented in the PI. Long term safety 
data are still lacking and will be provided through agreed study updates in the RMP. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance  
The results of the pivotal study CLL3001, a placebo controlled add-on study to bendamustine + rituximab 
(BR) in patients with R/R CLL or SLL -which was part of the post-authorisation studies for Imbruvica- led 
to an extension of indication to add the combination of ibrutinib with bendamustine and rituximab to the 
CLL indications. These are of high clinical relevance to CLL patients, consistent across subgroups and 
supported by evidence as regards the activity and safety of ibrutinib as add-on to BR from supportive 
single arm data. The benefit – risk profile of adding ibrutinib to bendamustine + rituximab is considered 
favourable in patients with R/R CLL. 
The final CSRs for study MCL3001 and MCL2001 have been provided in support of the current indication 
in r/r MCL. From a safety perspective, potentially important issues have been extensively discussed and 
revisions of the SPC have been agreed whilst in the overall pattern the safety profile of ibrutinib is 
unchanged.

Extension of Indication for use of Imbruvica in combination with bendamustine and rituximab in patients 
with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy; as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and the Annex II are updated. The Package 
Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, a clarification is made that the indications in mantle cell 
lymphoma (MCL) and Waldenstroem’s macroglobulinaemia (WM) refer to use of ibrutinib as single agent. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) introduced minor editorial changes throughout the 
product information. The RMP is updated accordingly (RMP version 6.1). 
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the following obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore recommends its 
deletion from the Annex II: 
• 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
Submission of the final study report of study MCL3001 
Due date 
1Q 2016 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Imbruvica is not similar to Arzerra and Gazyvaro within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1

2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion at the designation stage 
The COMP opinion on the orphan medicinal product designation was based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing mogamulizumab was 
considered justified based on preclinical data showing reduction of tumour size, and on preliminary 
clinical data; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to the development of cutaneous lesions, generalised 
erythroderma, and lymphadenopathy. Ulceration of tumours, with secondary bacterial infections, is 
linked to morbidity and death. The overall five-year survival rates vary between 24% and 68% 
according to the subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma;  
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 2.6 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition  
At the designation stage in 2006, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) were considered a 
heterogeneous subgroup of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma with the 2 main subtypes being mycosis 
fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS). In the most updated version of WHO classification, several 
types cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are described under the “mature T/NK cell neoplasms” (Swerdlow, 
et al, 2016, Blood 127(20): 2375-2390).  
In the ESMO clinical practice guidelines reflecting WHO-EORTC classificatoin, Cutaneous T-cell 
lymphomas include mycosis fungoides and its variants (folliculotrophic MF, pagetoid reticulosis, 
granulomatous slack skin), Sezary Syndrome, primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders 
(Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma,  Lymphomatoid papulosis), Subcutaneous 
panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma , Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma nasal-type , as well as primary 
cutaneous peripheral T cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified (Primary cutaneous γ/δ T cell 
lymphoma,Primary cutaneous CD8+ aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic T cell lymphoma, Primary 
cutaneous acral CD8+ T cell lymphoma,  Primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T cell 
lymphoproliferative disorder) (Willemze, Ann Oncol.(2018); 00: 1–11).  All of the above entities can 
thus be considered as covered by the orphan indication. 
The proposed therapeutic indication “POTELIGEO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sézary syndrome (SS) who have received at least one prior systemic 
therapy” falls entirely within the scope of the designated orphan indication “treatment of cutaneous T-
cell lymphoma”.

Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition is considered justified.  
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The sponsor has not identified any changes in the seriousness of the condition compared to the time of 
orphan designation. 
The COMP has acknwledged that CTCL is chronically debilitating due to the development of cutaneous 
lesions, generalised erythroderma, and lymphadenopathy. Ulceration of tumours, with secondary 
bacterial infections, is linked to morbidity and death. The overall five-year survival rates vary between 
24% and 68% according to the subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The applicant performed a literature and database search and produced an incidence ranging from 
0.052-0.29/10,000/year based on databases and a range of 0.047-0.14/10,000/year based on 
published literature. The applicant was invited by the COMP to perform the exercise according to the 
“points to consider on the calculation of prevalence” document and estimate the point prevalence at 
the time of the review of the criteria. 
In response to the raised issue by the COMP, the sponsor assumed a 20 years duration of the disease 
(Agar et al, J Clin Oncol. 2010, 28(31):4730-9.) and used a 0.13 yearly incidence (as a mean of the 
lower and upper figures above) to produce an estimate of 2.6 per 10,000. 
This was considered acceptable for the purpose of the maintenance procedure and in line with previous 
COMP considerations. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
As per knowledge of the COMP, currently authorised products in the EU for treatment of CTCL include 
bexarotene, bleomycin, dexamethasone, interferon alpha, chlormethine, brentuximab vedotin. The 
applicant pointed out in particular the following: 
•  Roferon-A authorisation states that “Interferon may be active in patients who have progressive 
disease and who are refractory to, or unsuitable for, conventional therapy” (UK Roferon SPC 
2016).  
• 
• 
Targretin (bexarotene) is authorised for the skin manifestations of advanced stage CTCL in 
adult patients refractory to at least one systemic treatment (Targretin SPC 2015).   
Ledaga (chlormethine) was authorised in 2017 for the topical treatment of MF-type CTCL in 
adult patients (Ledaga SPC 2017).  
•  Adcetris (brentuximab) is authorised for the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ CTCL after 
at least 1 prior systemic therapy (Adcetris SPC 2018). 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/811424/2018 2.0,CURRENT,OMAR final 
 
 
 
Moreover, there are 2018 treatment guidelines of ESMO for primary cutaneous lymphomas, (Annals of 
Oncology 29 (Supplement 4): iv30–iv40, 2018) giving summary recommendations for MF and SS. In 
particular for refractory or second line treatments, gemcitabine, liposomal doxorubicin and 
alemtuzumab (the latter for SS), are also mentioned as accepted standards, and therefore they can be 
of relevance for the justification of significant benefit. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor produced three types of arguments to justify significant benefit:  
a) expectations from the mechanism of action of the product 
b) responses in patients that have failed available therapies and;  
c) an implicit argument of improved safety (“Mogamulizumab has a favourable safety profile in 
subjects with CTCL. The majority of TEAEs are manageable”.) 
Of those arguments, the first one was not considered acceptable per se in the absence of data 
demonstrating the assumed improved effects, while the third one was not elaborated on versus the 
other products. However, the second argument was considered meriting further discussion, and the 
sponsor was invited by the COMP to provide a clinical data-driven comparative discussion versus the 
authorised treatments, to justify either a clinically relevant advantage or a major contribution to 
patient care. 
In response sponsor elaborated on the prior therapies of the patients included in the pivotal Marketing 
Authorisation study, with more than 60% of patients enrolled having failed at least 3 prior systemic 
treatments administered, and some having failed up to 18. It was stated that in the EU patients prior 
therapies included Bexarotene-Oral, Interferon-alpha, Methotrexate, PUVA, ECP, 
Gemcitabine/Gemcitabine Regimen, Topical Steroid Phototherapy, Doxorubicin HCL Liposome, Retinoid, 
Carmustine, CHOP/CHOP like Regimens, Nitrogen Mustard, Oral Steroid, Alemtuzumab, Brentuximab, 
HDAC Inhibitors. The sponsor provided in particular one table describing the responses seen in the 
0761-010 study as per previous treatment. Confirmed ORR, as measured by Investigator Assessment 
(IA), in the ITT population of Study 0761-010 by prior CTCL therapies commonly used in Europe is 
summarized in the table below:

Based on this information, the COMP acknowledged that there are documented responses in patients 
who have failed the authorised treatments covering the proposed population. It was further considered 
that in particular in patients who have failed multiple lines of previous treatments, the product offers a 
clinical relevant advantage.  
In particular effects in non-cutaneous lesions were considered relevant, taking into consideration that 
the assessment of responses related to multiple compartments of disease (such as skin, blood and 
lymph nodes). With reference to the secondary analyses in the CHMP assessment report, the response 
rates (confirmed CR + PR, %) by compartment (mogamulizumab vs vorinostat) were for blood 66.9 vs 
18.4 (p<0.0001) for skin lesions 41.9 vs 15.6 (p<0001) and for lymph nodes 15.4 vs 3.8 (p=0.0008) 
(table below).

4.  COMP position adopted on 11 October 2018 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 2.6 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to the development of cutaneous lesions, generalised 
erythroderma, and lymphadenopathy. Ulceration of tumours, with secondary bacterial infections, is 
linked to morbidity and death. The condition is life-threatening with five-year survival rates varying 
between 24% and 68% according to the subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the assumption that Poteligeo may be of potential significant benefit to those affected by 
the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor has provided clinical data documenting responses in 
multiple compartments of disease (such as skin, blood and lymph nodes) in patients who have 
previously failed multiple lines of available treatments. The COMP considered that this constitutes a 
clinically relevant advantage. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Poteligeo, Mogamulizumab, 
EU/3/16/1756 for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is not removed from the Community 
Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

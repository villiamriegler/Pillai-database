Study 402 was a Phase IV, open-label, single-arm study 
results of study SHP-GCB-402: A multicenter, open-
label, single-arm, phase 4 study designed to 
prospectively evaluate the effects of VPRIV on bone-
related pathology in treatment-naïve subjects with 
type 1 Gaucher disease. In addition, the MAH took 
that evaluated the effect of VPRIV on bone-related 
pathology in 21 treatment naïve adult subjects with type 1 
Gaucher disease. The primary efficacy analysis was 
conducted in 16 subjects that completed 24 months of 
VPRIV treatment with a median age of 46 years at baseline 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
and baseline mean (SD) BMD Z score of -1.93 (0.876).  
In this study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the change 
from baseline to 24 months in LS BMD Z score as measured 
by the DXA method. A positive trend for the primary 
efficacy endpoint was seen [change in LS BMD Z score 
baseline to 24 months mean (SD) 0.17 (0.394), 95% CI -
0.04, 0.38; but the effect was not statistically significant 
(p-value 0.1077). No relevant effect of VPRIV on LS BMD Z 
score was seen after 1 year of treatment. 
The safety profile was consistent with data from previous 
studies as well; no new safety signals were observed.

Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
PL 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit risk profile of VPRIV continues 
to be favourable. 
It is expected that additional data from a registry called 
Gaucher observational study (GOS) will provide additional 
information on Infusion-related reactions (IRR) including 
hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis, and the 
additional information expected on the connection or non-
connection of IRR to antibody development as well as the 
comparison with alternative treatments is expected to 
provide information on risk factors that will facilitate more 
focussed risk minimisation measures. 
Therefore the CHMP was of the view that one additional 
five-year renewal on the basis of pharmacovigilance 
grounds was required.

change relates to a biological AS or a starting 
volumes (MRI), skeletal pathology, and reduction in the 
plasma biomarkers chitriosidase and CCL18 achieved in the 
parent study TKT025 were further improved or sustained 
during the extension.  
Regarding study HGT-GCB-044, the interpretation of the 
results of the submitted 2-year interim report is considered 
limited by the CHMP since the analysis has not been 
prespecified and the trial is currently ongoing. 
The provided data do not indicate a change in the AE profile 
of velaglucerase alfa. No new or unexpected safety signals 
have been reported through the long-term safety 
extensions.  
The CHMP agreed that section 5.1 of the SmPC is updated 
to include information on the clinical data collected in study 
TKT025EXT. However, regarding study HGT-GCB-044 the 
CHMP considered that the interpretation of the results of 
this 2-years exposure interim report is limited and 
requested that a variation to add data on this study in the 
product information will be submitted in the future when 
the final study report becomes available. 
The CHMP was of the opinion that this data do not affect 
the benefit/risk balance of Vpriv (velaglucerase) indicated 
for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in 
patients with type 1 Gaucher disease (GD).

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
GCB, Velaglucerase alfa) Enzyme Replacement Therapy in 
Newly Diagnosed or Previously Treated (with Imiglucerase) 
Patients with type 1 Gaucher Disease’ additional clinical 
data especially related to safety and the use of Vpriv in 
elderly patients became available. In addition to the patient 
safety assessment conducted as part of the overall clinical 
assessment, efficacy of velaglucerase alfa in patients 
switching from imiglucerase was also evaluated. The 
provided data indicate that efficacy in patients switching 
ERT from imiglucerase to velaglucerase alfa is maintained, 
while for treatment-naïve patients these parameters 
indicate improvement with velaglucerase treatment. There 
are no new or unexpected findings regarding the efficacy or 
safety of velaglucerase alfa. The CHMP was of the opinion 
that this information is of importance to the prescribers and 
the patients and addition of appropriate wording in the PI 
of Vpris is therefore agreed. The overall benefit risk balance 
remains positive.

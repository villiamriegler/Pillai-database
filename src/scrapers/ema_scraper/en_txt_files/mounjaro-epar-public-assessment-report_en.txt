2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Tirzepatide is intended to be used in the following indication (indication worded in line with the initial 
submission): 
Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to 
diet and exercise 
‒ 
‒ 
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications 
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.  
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control, weight and cardiovascular 
events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.   
Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
receptor agonist which is administered subcutaneously once-weekly. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a metabolic disease which is highly prevalent in western and worldwide societies, 
attributed to unhealthy lifestyle. 
Type 2 diabetes remains a substantial health care challenge that affects the individual patient and the society 
profoundly. The prevalence of the chronic and progressive metabolic disorder is expected to increase 
worldwide markedly; projections suggest that around 10% of the global adult population will be affected by 
2045. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Most subjects with T2D are overweight or obese, which is important in the aetiology as it increases insulin 
resistance and leads to persistent hyperglycaemia.  
The pathogenesis is seemingly heterogeneous and also involves environmental, lifestyle, and genetic 
components. All of these factors contribute to chronic hyperglycaemia, which (if left untreated) is associated 
with β-cell failure and increased risk of long-term micro- and macrovascular complications. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The typical presentation of diabetes includes polyuria and polydipsia. However, many patients with T2D are 
asymptomatic and are diagnosed with screening or general investigations of a specific complaints like fatigue. 
The diagnosis is made by measurement of hyperglycaemia. 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 9/212 
 
 
 
2.1.5.  Management 
The guidelines of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the American Diabetes 
Association (ADA) for treatment of T2D have been developed in cooperation and are widely agreed. The 
major steps recommended for managing type 2 diabetes are lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. For 
glycaemic control, primarily metformin, other non-insulin anti-diabetic agents and finally insulin (in various 
forms) are used. 
To avoid the microvascular complications associated with the disease, it is a crucial aim to establish adequate 
glycaemic control as soon as possible after a T2D diagnosis. Besides anti-glycaemic therapy, 
antihypertensive, antithrombotic and lipid lowering treatments might be indicated to avoid other associated 
co-morbidities (e.g. hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia) and macrovascular complications (MI, stroke). 
Recently, SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs in T2D patients at high CV risk have shown not only 
improvements in glycaemic control but also a reduction in body weight and CV events. 
2.2.  About the product 
Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like 
peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist and is intended as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic 
control in adults with T2DM.  
Proposed Indication: see above. 
Proposed Posology 
The starting dose of tirzepatide is 2.5 mg once weekly. After 4 weeks, increase the dose to 5 mg once 
weekly. If needed, dose increases can be made in 2.5 mg increments after a minimum of 4 weeks on the 
current dose. The recommended doses are 5, 10 and 15 mg. 
The maximum dose is 15 mg once weekly. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
Development program 
Completed studies 
This application for tirzepatide as a novel adjunct treatment to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control 
in adults with T2DM is supported by 19 completed clinical studies in healthy participants or patients with 
T2DM: 
•  3 biopharmaceutic studies 
•  7 clinical pharmacology studies, including 1 mechanism of action study 
•  2 Phase 2 studies 
•  5 global (pivotal) Phase 3 studies, and 
•  2 regional (Japan) Phase 3 studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 10/212 
 
 
 
The 10 biopharmaceutic and clinical pharmacology studies were designed to assess the PK, PD, the effects of 
extrinsic and intrinsic factors on tirzepatide PK, the impact of tirzepatide on PK of orally administered drugs, 
and safety and tolerability of tirzepatide. Single doses of tirzepatide were administered over a range of 0.25 
to 8 mg, and multiple once-weekly doses that ranged from 0.5 to 15 mg for up to 28 weeks. The effect of 
tirzepatide on insulin and glucagon secretion and insulin sensitivity was assessed in a dedicated mechanism 
of action study.  
The two Phase 2 studies (GPGB and GPGF) were multicenter, double-blind studies conducted to provide 
assessments of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tirzepatide between 1 and 15mg to support dose 
selection and optimization of the dose-escalation scheme for Phase 3 studies. Patients had T2DM and 
inadequate glycaemic control on diet and exercise with or without a stable dose of metformin. Study GPGB 
was a 26-week study that compared tirzepatide with placebo and dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Study GPGF was a 12-
week study that compared tirzepatide with placebo. These Phase 2 studies used different dose-escalation 
schemes than the scheme that was used in the Phase 3 studies; hence, the data are not included in the 
efficacy assessments but contribute exposures to the safety assessment. 
The 5 global Phase 3 studies (GPGK, GPGL, GPGH, GPGM, and GPGI) were designed to assess the efficacy 
and safety of tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg once-weekly (40- or 52-week treatment duration at the primary 
endpoint) versus placebo or active comparators in adults with T2DM. The treatment exposure in Study GPGM 
lasted up to 104 weeks. Within Study GPGH, 2 sub-studies were performed, and were designed to investigate 
the 24-hour glucose profile captured with CGM or characterize potential changes in hepatic fat content 
through magnetic resonance imaging. The clinical studies utilized double-blinded or open-label designs and 
included patients with varying disease severity, differing in duration of disease, background therapy, 
comorbidities, and complications. Background therapies ranged from diet and exercise alone, to 1 to 3 OAMs, 
and basal insulin with or without metformin. 
The 2 regional Phase 3 studies (GPGO and GPGP) were 52-week, multicenter studies conducted in Japan. 
Study GPGO was a double-blind study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide compared with 
dulaglutide 0.75 mg in patients with T2DM who discontinued OAM monotherapy or were OAM-naïve. 
Dulaglutide 0.75 mg is the only dulaglutide dose currently registered in Japan and was the active comparator 
chosen since it is marketed in Japan as monotherapy in patients with T2DM. Study GPGP was an open-label 
study without comparator, designed to assess safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in combination with 
monotherapy of OAMs. These 2 regional studies used the tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg maintenance doses 
and the same tirzepatide dose-escalation scheme as was used in the global Phase 3 studies. The data from 
these studies are not included in the efficacy assessments but contribute exposures to the safety assessment. 
Compliance with CHMP Guidance 
The design of the registration program was informed by available regulatory guidance documents and advice 
from the EMA/CHMP and FDA, among others: 
• 
• 
FDA 2008: Guidance for Industry. Diabetes Mellitus: Developing Drugs and Therapeutic Biologics for 
Treatment and Prevention. 
ICH 2017: ICH harmonised guideline: estimands and sensitivity analysis in clinical trials, E9(R1), Step 2 
version. 
•  EMA 2018: Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment or Prevention of 
Diabetes Mellitus (draft rev.2).

SA was requested and advice was sought on quality, pre-clinical, and clinical aspects of the development.  
Conclusion: 
In general, regulatory feedback has been implemented in the study program. A different approach for dose- 
de-escalation was chosen by the Applicant (see 2.5.4.1.3). In addition, PK/PD modelling to address the use of 
tirzepatide in patients with hepatic impairment was not performed as patients with hepatic impairment were 
excluded from the phase 3 study program. Instead, a clinical pharmacology study (GPGQ) was conducted.

structure of tirzepatide was characterized using orthogonal biophysical techniques. The 
secondary structure of tirzepatide is predominantly α-helical under native conditions. 
The chemical structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of LC-MS, LC-MS/MS, of 
Intact Molecule, LC-MS Peptide Mapping, Chiral GC-MS, RP-HPLC and IC, NMR,  far-UV CD spectroscopy, FT-
IR spectroscopy, near-UV CD spectroscopy, composition gradient multiangle light scattering, and cell based 
bioassays.   
The active substance is a hygroscopic white to practically white solid, and freely soluble in 5 mM phosphate 
buffer pH 7.0 at 25°C  
Regarding stereoisomerism, the active substance exhibits L-form for natural amino acids except no chiral 
center for Gly and 2-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) in positions 2 and 13.  
Polymorphism has not been observed for active substance.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufacture by one manufacturing site. 
The active substance is synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis, dissolution and chromatographic 
purification, isolation and drying concentration and solvent exchange, and using well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications.  
The manufacturing process utilizes a standard solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) manufacturing procedure 
including addition of the linear sidechain at Lys20. The peptide is cleaved from the resin with simultaneous 
side-chain deprotection. The tirzepatide crude active substance is purified by reverse phase chromatography, 
concentrated, solvent exchanged, isolated, and dried to produce the final active substance. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Detailed information on degradation impurities was investigated. Degradation pathways were discussed in 
detail, including identification of most degradation products for solid active substance and active substance 
solution/finished product based on stress stability results. No degradation was observed under the proposed 
storage conditions for the active substance and the degradation occurring over the shelf-life of the finished 
product solution is discussed in this section.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The development of the manufacturing process for the tirzepatide synthetic routes included the use of Quality 
by Design principles, however, no design space was claimed, and the linking of elements of risk management 
to rigorous scientific understanding. Robustness of unit operations, process parameters, and controls were 
evaluated against the CQAs of the final active substance, ultimately linking to the CQAs of the finished 
product. The commercial process development approach is described in full detail. Purge of impurities are 
discussed for SPPS and purification. The active substance manufacturing process was extensively 
characterized, and the data provided in the dossier demonstrate thorough understanding of the 
manufacturing process.

The active substance is packaged in a primary liner which complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 
10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification  includes tests for identification, (RP-LC-UV, peptide map, cell-based 
bioassay), assay (RP-LC-UV), purity tests (RP-LC-UV,  RP-LC-MS), high molecular weight (SEC), residual 
solvents (GC), description (visual), water content (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), and TAMC and 
TCYMC (Ph. Eur.). 
All CQAs have been included in the specification. The proposed acceptance criteria have been adequately 
justified. 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for identity and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 3 commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 12 months under long term conditions (-20°C) and for up to 12 
months under accelerated conditions (5°C) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Supportive stability data from 1 batch manufactured using the Initial Phase 3 Process and used in clinical 
trialsfor up to 24 months under long term conditions (-20°C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (5°C) according to the ICH guidelines was provided. 
The following parameters were tested: assay, purity, related substances/impurities (total, specified, and 
largest unspecified), high molecular weight species, water content, and description. The analytical methods 
used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications under long-term and accelerated conditions. While 
packaged in a different container than the primary stability batches, the supporting stability batch has shown 
similar stability profiles to the primary stability batches. 
Results on stress conditions (25°C/ 60% RH) for 6 months were also provided on one batch. Increases in 
impurities were observed over 6 months with a corresponding decrease in purity. These changes are 
consistent with degradation pathways observed in stress studies and were not observed at either the -20°C 
long-term or 5°C accelerated conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period when stored frozen (-25°C to -10°C) in the 
proposed container.

2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as a clear to opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow or brown, essentially 
free of particles, sterile and non-pyrogenic parenteral solution for subcutaneous administration. 
The pharmaceutical development for the finished product was based on a Quality by Design approach, 
however, no design space was claimed. A comprehensive QTTP was presented. The Quality Target Product 
Profile (QTPP) was defined by taking into consideration the pharmaceutical product quality attributes required 
to meet the needs of the patient. The defined QTPP formed the basis for the finished product design. 
Formulation and manufacturing process development considered the necessary CQAs for a sterile solution in 
a semi-finished syringe assembled in an autoinjector. The Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) were defined 
based on the understanding derived from the risk assessment from a safety and efficacy perspective, taking 
into consideration CQAs related to the active substance, excipients and those specific to the parenteral 
dosage form. The QTPP and CQAs were used to design pre-formulation and formulation development studies 
with the goal of developing a stable commercial finished product formulation. 
The active substance characteristics with a possible impact on the finished product formulation were 
provided.  
All excipients are well-known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Extensive formulation development studies were conducted taking into account solubility of the active 
substance, tonicity, the effect of pH and agitation. The commercial formulation was already used during 
phase 3 clinical studies.  
The finished product does not contain overages. However, an overfill is required to discharge the nominal 
volume from the autoinjector containing the syringe. Sufficient justification of the proposed overfill in the 
syringes assembled in the autoinjector has been provided. 
The manufacturing process is a common process for aqueous sterile finished products, which cannot be 
subjected to terminal sterilisation: buffer formulation and filtration, finished product formulation and first 
filtration, sterile filtration, filling and plunger insertion. The semi-finished syringe is finally assembled into the 
autoinjector. 
The choice of sterile filtration with aseptic filling has been adequately justified in accordance with the 
guideline on sterilisation EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015.  
Following a risk-based approach, manufacturing process development studies were performed. The overall 
control strategy was defined based on the results from these studies. Detailed lists of critical and non-critical 
process parameters as well as in-process controls with limits and ranges were provided and considered 
satisfactory.  
Product contact materials have been evaluated under worst case processing times for their impact on the 
finished product quality and were found to have no negative impact. Potential extractables and leachables 
have sufficiently been evaluated.  
In conclusion, the manufacturing process development of the finished product is sufficiently described. 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022

The commercial primary container system for the finished product consists of a 1 mL clear glass staked 
needle syringe barrel closed with a plunger and a rigid needle shield.   
The semi-finished syringe is assembled into an autoinjector. The same autoinjector is used for all six 
strengths. This container closure system was also used in Phase 3 clinical trials.  
For the semi-finished syringe, sufficient information with respect to protection, safety, compatibility and 
performance has been provided.  
The finished product is a medicinal product that falls under the second sub-paragraph of Article 1(9) of 
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR). The medical device/device parts and the medicinal product form an 
integral product which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and which is not reusable. In 
accordance with Article 117 of the Medical Device Regulation, all applications for an integral medicinal 
product should include evidence of the conformity of the device parts with the relevant GSPRs set out in 
Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2017/745. Therefore, for the prefilled pen part of the finished product, a Notified 
Body Opinion must be provided. The originally missing Notified Body Opinion constituted a major objection, 
to which as a response the applicant provided the requested opinion from the Notified Body. Sufficient 
documentation in accordance with the Guideline on quality documentation for medicinal products when used 
with a medical device (EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/259165/2019) has also been provided. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by two manufacturing sites. 
The manufacturing process consists of 5 main steps: buffer solution preparation, finished product 
formulation, bioburden reduction and in-line sterile filtration (immediately before filling), aseptic filling, 
plungering, and assembly of the semi-finished syringes with the autoinjector components. The process is 
considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
Critical and non-critical process parameters, in-process controls, as well as processing time limits (hold 
times) were given with ranges or limits in accordance with the knowledge gained during development. 
Process parameters and in-process controls for assembly of the semi-finished syringe into the autoinjector 
were also provided.  
Validation data on production scale batches covering the entire manufacturing process including processing 
times and assembly of semi-finished syringe into the autoinjector were missing and resulted in a major 
objection (MO). Data for PPQ batches of the semi-finished syringe (SFS) and autoinjectors were provided. 
CPPs, PPs, CIPC, IPC and release data are all within specifications. Processing time limits were also 
successfully validated. Four batches of SFS were assembled into autoinjectors. All test parameters in 
accordance with the finished product specification are within specifications. Overall, the PPQ data submitted 
are considered sufficient to demonstrate that the manufacturing process of the finished product is under 
control and results in consistent quality. 
Validation of the membrane filters was performed, and respective data is considered sufficient. 
Results of media fill runs at both manufacturing sites sufficiently demonstrated the maximum filling time for 
the finished product solution into the syringes. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process.

Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: identity (RP-LC-UV, peptide map), assay (RP-LC-UV), purity (RP-LC-UV), high molecular weight species 
(SEC), description (visual), color (Ph. Eur.), clarity (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. 
Eur.) pH (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), particle matter (Ph. Eur.), volume of injection (Ph. Eur.), and 
syringe functionality break loose force and glide force (compression test).  
The autoinjector specifications include appropriate tests for identity (RP-LC-UV), dose accuracy (volume by 
weight, visual/functional inspection (inspection), and injection time (timing). 
The specifications cover the necessary tests for a sterile solution in a semi-finished syringe assembled into an 
autoinjector including two orthogonal identity tests, assay, purity, related substances, HMWS, safety tests 
(sterility, bacterial endotoxins, particulate matter) and functionality tests for syringe and device.  
The finished product manufacturing process does not lead to new degradation products compared to the 
active substance. The specification limits for total and identified impurities are considered acceptable. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data using an 
ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 
30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded 
that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has 
been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the 
“Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there 
is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no 
specific control measures are deemed necessary. The analytical methods used have been adequately 
described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Reference standards are used 
for both active substance and finished product. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the release specifications, through traditional final 
product release testing 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 6 batches (four of the batches are pilot scale and two are commercial scale for both semi-
finished syringe and autoinjector batches of finished product (for 2.5 mg and 15 mg strength) manufactured 
by one manufacturing site stored for up to 18 months under long term conditions (2 - 8 °C) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (30 C/ 65% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The

batches of the medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Supporting stability studies cover long term stability for finished product from phase 3 clinical trial batches, 
intermediate strength batches, batches in container closure from alternate supplier and chemical and physical 
stability in the autoinjector.  
Samples were tested for assay, purity, HMWS, description, colour, clarity, bacterial endotoxins, sterility, 
container closure integrity, pH, particulate matter, break loose and glide force, and autoinjector testing. The 
analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
A bracketing approach consistent with the guidelines in ICH Q1D was applied for the finished product. This is 
considered acceptable as the finished products contain the same excipients in the same concentrations, the 
fill volume is the same and primary container closure system and autoinjector are identical. 
Long-term stability data show no obvious trends. 
The finished product was exposed to stress degradation conditions with respect to thermal, pH, and oxidative 
stress. Based on the results, the potential degradation pathways are well understood and characterized. The 
analytical methods are capable of detecting degradation products from the likely and potential degradation 
pathways. 
Batches of the finished product in semi-finished syringes were exposed to ICH Q1B confirmatory 
photostability conditions. These studies demonstrated that the finished product in the SFS is susceptible to 
degradation under the ICH photostability conditions. The analytical methods were capable of detecting photo-
induced degradation products. Based on the results of the study in the SFS, follow-up photostability studies 
were conducted in the autoinjector, and the autoinjector packaged in the marketing pack. Degradation was 
reduced in the finished product incorporated into the autoinjectors and no degradation was observed under 
the ICH confirmatory photostability conditions for the autoinjectors packaged in the marketing pack. 
As part of the stability assessment of the finished product, a patient-use study was conducted at the 11-
month time point by transferring a subset of syringes that had been stored at 5 °C to 30 °C / 65% RH 
storage and evaluating product quality attributes for up to 30 days to encompass the period that the finished 
product may be stored out of refrigeration (up to 30 °C) by the patient. Additional patient-use studies are 
planned at the end of shelf life, and the patient-use stability is also supported by the stability data generated 
at the accelerated condition of 30 °C / 65% RH. The primary stability data at the long-term storage condition 
(5 °C) and the patient-use study data were compared to the proposed commercial specifications. At the 
recommended storage condition of 5 °C, all available results including the autoinjector performance 
requirements tests have remained within the proposed acceptance criteria. In addition, the results remained 
within the proposed acceptance criteria for at least 21 days at 30 °C / 65% RH for patient-use. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years and store in a refrigerator (2 ºC - 8 ºC), 
do not freeze as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. The finished product may be stored 
unrefrigerated for up to 21 days at a temperature not above 30 ºC. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. Two issues were raised by CHMP as Major Objections (MO) related to the 
request of validation data on production scale batches covering the entire manufacturing process including 
processing times and assembly of semi-finished syringe into the autoinjector and  the missing Notified Body 
Opinion of the prefilled pen part of the finished product. The issues were resolved satisfactorily by the 
applicant as discussed above. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and/or finished product 
and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of 
the active substance, nor for the finished product. 
 The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
In-vitro and in-vivo studies were performed to characterise tirzepatide’s effects in relation to its intended 
indication Type 2 diabetes. The focus laid – according to its mechanism of action – on binding to the GLP-1 
and GIP receptor and on its effects on glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Special studies were performed to 
elaborate the contribution of the GIP receptor on the tirzepatide effects using GIP receptor deficient mice or 
cells of them. Furthermore, the effect of albumin on tirzepatide’s binding to its target receptors was 
specifically studied in vitro since tirzepatide is intended to bind rather tightly to serum albumin to prolong its 
duration of action. Other special studies addressed tirzepatide’s effect on gastric emptying; this effect is due 
to GLP-1 receptor activation and is already known from pure GLP-1 RAs.

Main results 
Tirzepatide has Ki values in the nanomolar range towards GIP and GLP1 
receptors from human, monkey, rat and mouse. Binding strongly affected 
by serum albumin as expected 
Binding results in line with DBT201; furthermore, cAMP production was 
measured. EC50 of cAMP production in the nanomolar or sub-nanomolar 
range, depending on receptor expression level in the HEK cells 
GTP recruitment to Gs protein was measured after cell stimulation with 
tirzepatide (compared to the endogenous ligands, GIP and GLP1). EC50 of 
tirzepatide was in the sub-nanomolar range; Emax was only around 50% 
(compared to GIP) at the GIP receptor 
beta-arrestin-2 recruitment was measured to address receptor 
internalisation and inactivation upon prolonged stimulation. EC50 and 
Emax were similatr on the GIP receptor for tirzepatide and GIP. In 
contrast tirzepatide had virtually no effect on the arrestin recruitment to 
the GLP1recptor 
Receptor internalisation was measured. Effect of tirzepatide and GIP were 
similar on GIP receptors. In contrast, EC50 was markedly higher and 
Emax was markedly lower for tirzepatide than for GLP1 on the GLP1 
receptor. This is in line with Study QSB171 
Tirzepatide increased insulin liberation in the presence of glucose (11.2 
mM) in WT animals. The effect size was roughly comparable with GLP1. In 
GIPR-KO mice, the effect of various tirzepatide concentrations was highly 
similar to WT animals. In GLP1R-KO mice, the tirzepatide effect was 
stronger than in WT animals at the high tirzepatide concentration of 1000 
nM. 
cAMP production and lipolysis were measured. Effects of GIP and 
tirzepatide were similar; EC50 of tirzepatide was lower than EC50 of GIP

In Vitro Receptor Binding Affinity of LY3298176 for the Cloned Human, Monkey, Rat, and Mouse 
Gastric Inhibitory Peptide (GIP) and Glucagon-like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) Receptors 
The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro binding affinity of LY3298176 against various species 
using cell membranes prepared from HEK-293 cells over-expressing the cloned human, monkey, rat, or 
mouse gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) receptor or glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor. Equilibrium 
dissociation constants (Ki) determined by competitor inhibited radioligand binding in membrane preparations 
of the HEK cells. The amount of bound radioligand was determined by a scintillation proximity assay (SPA). 
Since LY3298176 contains a long chain acyl moiety, binding affinity was determined both in the absence and 
presence of 0.1% fatty-acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA) where feasible. 
The following four tables show the binding affinities of tirzepatide (LY3298176) on the GIP (upper two 
figures) and the GLP-1 (lower two figures) receptor of different species. The endogenous ligand served as 
comparator. Binding assays were performed in the absence and presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin 
(BSA). The presence of BSA markedly reduced the apparent affinity of tirzepatide to the GIP and GLP-1 
receptor. This was probably due to the fact that tirzepatide was designed for strong binding to albumin. The

endogenous ligands were not affected by BSA. Binding affinities towards the GLP-1 receptors from different 
species were in the low nanomolar range (in the absence of BSA).

The affinity of tirzepatide towards the human and monkey GIP receptor was remarkable high (low Ki) in the 
presence of BSA (second table). In these species and at this receptor the Ki was in the low nanomolar range 
whereas otherwise it was in the range of one or a few hundred nanomolar.

In Vitro LY3298176 GLP-1 and GIP Receptor Radioligand Binding and Induced Intracellular cAMP 
Accumulation on Recombinant Human GLP-1, GCG, and GIP Receptors in HEK293 Cell Lines with 
Varying Receptor Densities 
Functional cAMP data for LY3298176 and comparator peptides was generated using clonal cell lines (from 
HEK-293) having a low-, medium-, and high-expression density of human glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
(hGLP-1R), low-, medium-, and high-expression density of human glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide 
receptor (human gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor, hGIP-R), or low expression density of human 
glucagon receptor (hGCGR). Assays were carried out in the presence of bovine casein with and without 
human serum albumin (HSA). 
As shown in the following figure, EC50 of cAMP production following receptor stimulation strongly decreased 
with increasing receptor expression level. Emax virtually remained unchanged. This shown for the GLP-1 
receptor in the following table. A similar effect was observed for the GIP receptor. 
Tirzepatide had only a very low affinity at the glucagon receptor (EC50 2350 nM in the absence of HSA).

Note that the receptor expression should not affect EC50 because this depends on affinity, which is a 
property of the individual molecule. In contrast, Emax should increase with increasing receptor number (or 
density). But this was not the case.

It was also shown in this study (and in a corresponding publication by Lilly employees) that human serum 
albumin markedly increases the EC50 of tirzepatide in respect to cAMP formation (as it did for receptor 
binding, see Study DBT201 above). 
QSB171: 
In Vitro LY3298176 Induced β-Arrestin-2 Recruitment to Recombinant Human GIP and GLP-1 
Receptors in CHO-K1 PathHunter® Cells 
In this study, the ability of tirzepatide was tested to induce β-arrestin recruitment at the human GLP-1 and 
GIP receptor. This was done in cell lines overexpressing the respective receptor. Recruitment of β-arrestin 
leads to receptor internalisation and thereby inactivation or desensitisation upon binding of a ligand. 
At the human GLP-1 receptor, tirzepatide was not able to recruit β-arrestin. In contrast, β-arrestin 
recruitment was observed with the endogenous ligand GLP-1 in nanomolar concentrations as positive control, 
indicating that the test system works. For details, see table below.

At the human GIP receptor, there were no relevant differences between tirzepatide and GIP. Both peptides 
were able to recruit β-arrestin to the human GIP receptor in a similar way.

In Vitro LY3298176 Induced Receptor Internalization of Recombinant Human GIP and GLP-1

This study, like QSB171, also addressed receptor inactivation in response to binding of a ligand. In this study 
internalisation was determined directly by suitable cytological methods. Human GLP-1R and GIP-R were

tagged at the C-terminus with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). These constructs were stably 
expressed in HEK293 cells. Internalisation was assessed by confocal imaging. Thereby, EGF fluorescence 
could be located either at the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm after counter-staining of the cell nuclei. 
Representative images of the transfected HEK cells after ligand treatment are shown below (GFP 
fluorescence). The upper row (A-C) shows GIP receptor expressing cells, the lower row (D-F) GLP-1 receptor 
expressing cells. Note that in the latter the endogenous ligand GLP-1 (Panel E) caused a marked 
internalisation of receptor fluorescence (green) but tirzepatide (Panel F) did not. 
In case of the GIP receptor, GIP and tirzepatide caused a similar internalisation (Panels B and C) as 
compared to vehicle control (Panel A).

Internalisation was also assessed by measuring the decrease of the N-terminal HA tag from the cell surface in 
unpermeabilised cells. The results are in line with the findings from the GFP approach. Again, TZP caused 
poor internalisation of the GLP-1 receptor (markedly weaker than GLP-1 did) whereas internalisation of the 
GIP receptor was similar with GIP and tirzepatide.

Effects of LY3298176 on Insulin Secretion In Vitro from Rat and Mouse Pancreatic Islets 
In this study, the potency of LY3298176 in stimulating insulin secretion from rat and mouse pancreatic islets 
was evaluated. Islets were isolated from rats and from wild-type (WT) mice as well as from genetically 
modified mice lacking the GIP or the GLP-1 receptor.

In islets from rats (not genetically modified), tirzepatide dose-dependently increased insulin liberation in the 
presence of glucose; the effect in the absence of glucose was not tested. The maximal effect size of 
tirzepatide was similar to GLP-1, and the tirzepatide effect was virtually maximal with concentrations of 300 
nM and above. 
The following figure shows the tirzepatide effect on insulin liberation in islets prepared from mice lacking the 
GLP-1 receptor or the GIP receptor, compared to islets from wild-type (WT) mice. Effect size and 
concentration-response relationship were highly similar in WT and GLP-1 receptor KO mice, with nearly 
maximal responses at 100 to 300 nM onwards. The picture in GIP receptor KO mice is somewhat different 
with still increasing effect size at the highest doses tested. Furthermore, the maximal effect appears to be 
larger.

In-vivo studies 
The following table provides an overview of the submitted in-vivo studies and the main observations made. A 
more detailed description of the important studies is provided thereafter. 
Main results 
An Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (ipGTT) was performed. 
Glucose AUC strongly decreased with ascending doses of tirzepatide in 
WT animals; EC50 was 0.2 nmol/kg. Tirzepatide was also effective in 
GIPR-KO and GLP1R-KO animals whereas semaglutide was not effective 
in GLP1R-KO mice 
An Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test was performed. A dose-
dependent decrease in glucose AUC was observed; EC50 was 0.87 
nmol/kg 
A hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic clamp was performed. Tirzepatide 
markedly rduced the glucose infusion rate. Furthermore, 2-
deoxyglucose uptake into muscle and adipose tissue was measured 
during the clamp. Tirzepatide increased glucose uptake. 
A hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic clamp was performed. Results were 
in line with the rat study ENDO127. Semaglutide was tested as 
comparator in the mouse study. Effects of semaglutide and tirzepatide 
were qualitatively similar; effect size was smaller with semaglutide, but 
the question remains whether comparable doses were tested.  
Levels of glutamic acid, branched-chain amino acids and ketoacids were 
measured in plasma and brown adipose tissue (BAT). There was a 
tirzepatide-related increase of the amino acids in BAT and a decrease in 
plasma. The ketoacids decreased in plasma and were not tested in BAT. 
Acute and chronic effects of tirzepatide on gastric emptying in lean and 
obese mice were tested. Acute tirzepatide treatment dose-dependently 
inhibited gastric emptying. A pure GIP receptor agonist had no effect. 
After two weeks’ treatment with tirzepatide, delay of gastric emptying 
was no longer observed.

Effect of tirzepatide on body weight was studied. Semaglutide served as 
comparator. Tirzepatide and semaglutide hat qualitatively similar effects 
on body weight and food intake; the effect of tirzepatide was larger with 
the doses used.  
The In Vivo Effect of LY3298176 in Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test in Mice 
An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (ipGTT) were performed in normal C57Bl/6 mice as well as in mice 
lacking the GIP receptor or the GLP-1 receptor to demonstrate that LY3298176 improved glucose tolerance 
by acting through both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors 
In wild-type (WT) mice, tirzepatide dose-dependently lowered the blood glucose excursion after IP glucose 
administration. EC50 was 0.22 nmol/kg, see figure below.

from 0.01 to 100 nmol/kg (0.048 to 480 µg/kg) were challenged with a 2 g/kg intraperitoneal dose of 
glucose. Blood glucose was recorded with glucometers from 0 to 120 minutes post glucose dose (A), followed 
by area under the curve analysis (AUC, B). Data are presented as mean ± SEM of 7 to 8 mice per group.

In GIP receptor KO mice, tirzepatide (30 nmol/kg) also reduced glucose excursion in the IPGTT, essentially to 
the same extent as the same molar dose semaglutide, see figure below.

Overnight-fasted GIPr null mice (GIPr-/-) subcutaneously dosed with LY3298176 at 30 nmol/kg (144 µg/kg;

the DPP4-resistant GIP analogue [d-Ala2]GIP at 30 nmol/kg (1 hour prior to glucose), were challenged with a 
2 g/kg intraperitoneal dose of glucose. Blood glucose was recorded with glucometers from 0 to 120 minutes 
post glucose dose (A), followed by area under the curve analysis (AUC, B). Data are presented as mean ± 
SEM of 5 mice per group. p<.05 using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett’s post hoc test

In GLP-1 receptor KO mice, tirzepatide reduced glucose excursion to nearly the same extent as a GIP

In Vivo Effect of LY3298176 on Insulin Secretion in Male Wistar Rats in an Intravenous Glucose 
Tolerance Test 
In this study, LY3298176 was subcutaneously dosed to naïve male Wistar rats 16 hours prior to an 
intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), in order to determine its effect on insulin secretion. 
Insulin secretion (upper figure) and glucose excursion (lower figure) were measured after IVGTT. Insulin 
liberation increased with increasing doses of tirzepatide (LY3298176). The maximal response was reached at 
a tirzepatide concentration of 3 nmol/kg (14.4 µg/kg). 
Note that the effect of tirzepatide on glucose excursion (right panel) was markedly smaller than on insulin 
liberation (left panel) in this model. The applicant assumes that pentobarbital used for anaesthesia caused 
insulin resistance and hence prevented a major insulin effect on blood glucose level. As similar phenomenon 
was observed when using semaglutide instead of tirzepatide. Therefore, the reduced glucose response was 
not related to tirzepatide.

ENDO128: 
Chronic Dosing of LY3298176 Improves Insulin Sensitization in an Insulin-Resistant Mouse Model  
A similar study (ENDO127) was performed in rats. The results were in line with the results of Study ENDO128 
presented below. Studies ENDO127 and ENDO128 were intended to investigate whether LY3298176 improves 
insulin sensitivity in an insulin resistant rat or mouse model.  
In Study ENDO128, two euglycaemic clamp experiments were performed in the diet induced obese C57BL/6 
mouse model to assess insulin sensitivity. First, body weight and glucose infusion rates needed to maintain 
glucose steady state were determined. A second experiment was executed to determine the insulin 
sensitization effects of LY3298176, semaglutide, or pair feeding at more closely matched body weight loss. 
Whole body glucose utilization, insulin-mediated effects on liver glucose production, and muscle and adipose 
tissue glucose uptake were measured. 
The following doses were used in the two parts of the study: 
Part 1 
Vehicle: 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 8; 10 mL/kg. 
Semaglutide: 10 nmol/kg (41 µg/kg) 
LY3298176 (tirzepatide): 10nmol/kg (48 µg/kg) 
Part 2 
Vehicle: 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8; 5 mL/kg. 
Semaglutide: 10 nmol/kg (41 µg/kg) 
LY3298176 (tirzepatide): 3 nmol/kg (14.4 µg/kg) 
Pair-fed group was matched to the food intake of the LY3298176 group. 
The results in the two parts of the study were similar; therefore, data are only shown for the more extensive 
second part, which also included a semaglutide and a pair-fed group as controls. 
The following figure shows food intake and development of body weight over 14 days in all groups of the 
second series of experiments. Reduction food intake was marked compared to control in all other groups

(reduction was forced in the pair-fed group). Accordingly, there was similar body weight reduction from 
baseline in all treatment groups. Only in the vehicle control group development of body weight was markedly 
different from the other groups (only slight reduction).

completed by Modified Krushal-Wallis test followed by Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. 
Glucose uptake into muscle was increased by semaglutide and by tirzepatide compared to vehicle control. 
The effect of tirzepatide appeared stronger than that of semaglutide in both series of experiments; the results 
of the second series are shown in the figure below. Notably, in the first series of experiments (upper one of 
the following two figures) the effect of semaglutide and tirzepatide was nearly of the same magnitude. In 
contrast, in the second series (lower one of the following two figures) the semaglutide effect was rather weak 
compared to tirzepatide and was even numerically lower than the effect of pair-feeding (i.e. the effect of 
weight reduction alone).

(*p<.05 versus vehicle, **p<.05 LY3298176 versus semaglutide) was completed by Modified Krushal-Wallis 
test followed by Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.  
According to the figure above, glucose uptake in response to semaglutide was similar to (or even lower than) 
that in pair-fed animals. This indicates that semaglutide has no direct effect on glucose uptake (only indirect, 
probably via improvement of insulin resistance). In contrast, tirzepatide increased glucose uptake above the 
level seen in pair-fed animals, arguing for a direct effect via the GIP receptor.  
However, this finding was not consistent. In adipose tissue, glucose uptake tended to be higher in the 
semaglutide than in the pair-fed group (figure below). Furthermore, in the first set of experiments, there was 
no marked difference between tirzepatide and semaglutide in respect to effect size. A difference in effect size 
between the two compounds was only seen in the second set of experiments. Thus, the question remains 
whether there is indeed a fundamental, qualitative difference between the actions of tirzepatide and 
semaglutide (which could be due to GIP receptor activation by tirzepatide). The observed differences may 
also be gradual in nature (e.g. because the dose levels of semaglutide and tirzepatide were not equivalent) or 
due to random fluctuation. 
The following figures shows the effect of the different treatments on glucose uptake into adipose tissue. The 
effect of semaglutide was consistently noticeably weaker than that of tirzepatide, but the semaglutide effect 
was numerically higher than the effect of weight loss alone (i.e. of pair-feeding).

time-points after a semi-liquid diet. 
Gastric emptying delay was assessed after acute single dosing as well as following chronic (ie, daily) 
treatment with semaglutide (1, 3 and 10 nmol/kg [4.1, 12.3 and 41 µg/kg]) or tirzepatide (1, 3 and 10 
nmol/kg [4.8, 14.4 and 48 µg/kg]) for 14 days. 
Tirzepatide and semaglutide, given as single dose, retarded gastric emptying in a clearly dose-dependent 
manner; the effect of semaglutide appeared somewhat stronger (panels A and B of the figure below). A GIP 
receptor agonist did not affect gastric emptying (panel C). The results of repeated administration of three 
doses of semaglutide and tirzepatide, respectively, is shown in panel E. After daily administration for 14 days, 
an effect of the two compounds on gastric emptying no longer was detectable.

In-Vitro Functional Activity of LY3298176 on Human and Mouse GIP, Human GLP-1, Human GLP-2,

The glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide receptor (GIP-R), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), 
glucagon-like peptide-2 receptor (GLP-2R), and glucagon receptor (GlucR or GCGR) activate adenylyl cyclase 
resulting in elevated intracellular cAMP. These studies were conducted to determine the potency of 
LY3298176 for activation of human GIP-R, human GLP-1R, human GLP-2R, and human GCGR by measuring 
elevation of intracellular cAMP in cell lines expressing these cloned receptors. 
The following two tables provide the EC50 and Emax values of tirzepatide compared to the respective 
endogenous ligands on the human glucagon and GLP-2 receptor; GIP receptor and GLP-1 receptor are also 
included for comparison. Tirzepatide had no detectable affinity at the glucagon receptor and only low affinity 
at the GLP-2 receptor.

Cardiovascular Safety Pharmacology Evaluation of LY3298176 Administered by Subcutaneous 
Injection to Male Telemetry-Instrumented Conscious Nonhuman Primates 
Heart rate (HR) 
LY3298176-related increases in heart rate and decreases in dP/dtmax occurred in animals given ≥0.05 
mg/kg. 
In animals given 0.15 mg/kg, overall LSMeans of HR for 1 to 6, 21 to 31, and 45 to 55 hours post-dose were 
higher by 14, 19, and 11 bpm (12, 16, and 10%), respectively, compared with control. 
In animals given 0.05 mg/kg, HR was also increased 1 hour post-dose and for the overall mean 45 to 55 
hours post-dose.  
Blood pressure (BP) 
Administration of LY3298176 was associated with increased diastolic and mean arterial pressure and 
decreased pulse pressure in animals given 0.15 mg/kg. No compound-related effect on systolic pressure 
occurred. 
For diastolic pressure, the overall LSMeans for 9 to 19 hours post-dose (first dark phase) and 57 to 67 hours 
post-dose (third dark phase) in animals given 0.15 mg/kg were 6 and 4 mmHg higher (8 and 6%) than 
control, respectively.  
For mean arterial pressure, the overall LSMean for 9 to 19 hours post-dose in animals given 0.15 mg/kg was 
5 mmHg higher (6%) than control. 
ECG 
No abnormal ECG waveforms or arrhythmias were attributed to administration of LY3298176 mg/kg.

Methods: Determination of tirzepatide in plasma 
Plasma samples were analyzed to determine tirzepatide concentrations using a liquid chromatography with 
tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method. The LC/MS methods quantitated tirzepatide intact mass, which 
comprised the full-length peptide plus the acyl side chain. The methods used a protein precipitation 
extraction procedure with a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/exact mass spectrometry assay. 
Qualified LC/MS methods were used to support the single dose PK studies. The LC/MS methods were 
validated in mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey plasma to support the GLP toxicology studies. The validated 
methods for all species were conducted by Q2 Solutions (Ithaca, New York). The table below provides the 
quantifiable range, precision, accuracy, and stability of the assays utilized in the determination of tirzepatide 
in plasma. Samples above the limit of quantitation were diluted and reanalyzed to yield results within the 
calibrated range. Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) was conducted for mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey studies 
and results indicated that the assay methods performed according to established ISR acceptance criteria. 
Samples were handled and analyzed within demonstrated stability parameters. 
Results 
Tirzepatide is injected subcutaneously. Therefore, the applicant has not conducted studies on the 
mechanisms of absorption. In the following descriptive PK/TK parameters after single-dose administration 
and after repeated administration (from tox studies) in different species are shown, after the first and the last 
tirzepatide administration to address changes in PK over time. 
In mice (following table), no consistent differences in PK parameters between males and females were 
observed, At Day 176, compared to Day 1, AUC and Cmax were increased.

For distribution studies, radiolabelled tirzepatide was used. The c14-labels were contained in the linker to 
the fatty acid side chain, see figure below.

Tissue distribution 
Quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) was conducted to determine the tissue distribution of 
[14C]tirzepatide in male nonpigmented (Sprague Dawley) rats and male pigmented (Long Evans) rats 
following a single SC administration of 3 mg/kg of [14C]tirzepatide (report 8404127). Highest tissue 
exposure (AUC, Cmax) was observed in the kidneys (beside injection site). Accordingly, half life was rather 
long in the kidneys (46.6 h); a longer half-life was observed in brown fat (53.1 h). A remarkably long half–
life was found in the uveal tract of the eye (147 h). 
Plasma protein binding 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of tirzepatide was determined in rat and monkey plasma by a florescence 
polarization (FP) method (Report LY3298176-fu). In the presence of a fixed 0.05 µM concentration of the 
fluorescent ligand, binding was measured over a range of protein concentrations (0.120 to 240 µM) for the 
following matrices: rat serum albumin, rat plasma, monkey serum albumin, and monkey plasma (table 
below). The protein binding of fluorescent-labeled tirzepatide in plasma was attributed to albumin.

The structures of the metabolites found in rat and/or monkey plasma are depicted below. Metabolisation 
steps of tirzepatide include proteolytic cleavage, beta-oxidation, taurine conjugation, oxidation, amide 
hydrolysis, N-formylation, dehydrogenation and decarboxylation.

Excretion profiles were determined in male intact and bile-duct cannulated (BDC) Sprague Dawley rats 
following a single subcutaneous dose of 3 mg/kg [14C]tirzepatide (Report 8404127). Total recovery of

radioactivity in both intact and BDC rats was complete by 336 hours. In intact and BDC rats, 
[14C]tirzepatide-related radioactivity was slowly excreted with measurable radioactivity out to 336 hours, 
however approximately 92% of the radioactive dose was recovered from 0-120 hours. In intact rats, the 
recovery of the administered radioactive dose was comparable between urine and feces, likewise in BDC rats, 
the amounts eliminated were comparable between urine and bile. 
In male cynomolgus monkeys, the excretion profiles were determined following a single subcutaneous dose 
of 0.5 mg/kg [14C]tirzepatide (Report 8404128). [14C]Tirzepatide-related radioactivity was slowly excreted 
with measurable radioactivity out to 672 hours post-dose, however approximately 80% of the total 
radioactivity was recovered from 0-240 hours post-dose. The primary route of elimination for 
[14C]tirzepatide-related radioactivity was via urine, followed by faeces. 
Potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) via CYP enzymes and via drug transporters were addressed by the 
applicant in in-vitro studies using standard procedures. Inhibition and induction of CYP enzymes by 
tirzepatide was studied as well as inhibition of drug transporters. No relevant effects were found.

species. Dose-limiting was dehydration and weight loss due to strongly decreased food and water intake of 
the animals. In mice and monkeys, tasty food and fluid supplementation was offered to increase fluid and 
caloric intake. In contrast to toxicology studies with other GLP1RAs, no dose up-titration was performed. The 
animals started with the nominal dose. This may have contributed to the poor condition of the animals 
(following reduced food and water intake) and to the need of food and fluid supplementation. This also has 
limited the maximally tolerated dose and hence the safety margin to human therapeutic exposure.  
Study 8337876 (rat 6 mo, 4 wk recovery) 
Male and female rats were assigned to four groups, and doses were administered as indicated in the following 
table. Animals were dosed via subcutaneous injection in the dorsal region twice weekly at a volume of 1 
mL/kg. The vehicle control article was 10 mM tris, 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), and 0.02% Polysorbate 
80, pH 7.0 ± 0.2.

Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical observations, body weights, body weight change, food 
consumption, ophthalmic observations, laboratory parameters (haematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, 
urine chemistry; calcitonin plasma levels were not determined) and macroscopic and microscopic pathology. 
Blood samples were collected for toxicokinetic evaluations and active drug assessment. 
Mortality 
Two males were sacrificed at an unscheduled interval. The moribund condition of these animals was 
considered not test article related. One male (Animal B56642) administered 1.5 mg/kg, was sacrificed on Day 
71 because of limited use of the right front limb which was related to a bone fracture. One male (Animal

B56674) administered 3 mg/kg, was sacrificed in a moribund condition on Day 127 because of clinical 
observations attributed to spontaneous perforation of the aortic root. 
Clinical signs 
Appearance of hunched posture occurred in two males and seven females administered 3 mg/kg on Day 180. 
No other test article-related clinical observations occurred. 
Body weight 
Dose-dependent decreases in mean body weight, compared with control, were observed in animals 
administered ≥0.5 mg/kg. At the conclusion of the dosing phase, mean body weights were decreased by 
21.6, 23.7, and 29.5%, for males, and 21.4, 23.8, and 23.8%, for females administered 0.5, 1.5, or 3 
mg/kg, respectively, compared with final mean control body weights. During recovery, control males and 
females gained 82 and 66 grams, respectively during the course of the recovery phase while males and 
females previously administered 3 mg/kg LY3298176 gained 194 and 104 grams, respectively. At the 
conclusion of the recovery phase, mean body weights were decreased 4% for males and 16% for females 
administered 3 mg/kg compared with final mean control body weights. 
Food consumption was decreased accordingly. 
Laboratory findings 
There were some minor effects of LY3298176 on laboratory parameters. They were no longer present at the 
end of the recovery phase. Effects included mildly lower amylase activity in males administered ≥1.5 mg/kg 
and females administered ≥0.5 mg/kg. Additional minor findings in rats administered ≥0.5 mg/kg included 
mildly lower absolute reticulocyte count, mildly lower total protein concentration (due to minimally to mildly 
lower albumin and/or globulin concentrations), and minimally to mildly lower total cholesterol and 
triglycerides concentrations 
Organ weights 
Test article-related changes in organ weight parameters were generally considered secondary to significant 
decreases in terminal body weights in animals administered LY3298176. No macroscopic findings were 
reported. 
Microscopic findings 
Test article-related microscopic findings at the terminal sacrifice were present in the pancreas (increased 
incidence of lobular atrophy in females administered ≥1.5 mg/kg; zymogen depletion in rats administered 
≥0.5 mg/kg; diffuse atrophy in males administered ≥1.5 mg/kg and females administered ≥0.5 mg/kg; and 
decreased incidence of islet fibrosis and/or pigment in males administered ≥0.5 mg/kg); spleen (decreased 
incidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) in rats administered ≥1.5 mg/kg, which correlated with 
decreased splenic weight parameters and lower absolute reticulocyte count in rats administered ≥0.5 
mg/kg); skin/subcutis (increased incidence and/or severity of adipocyte atrophy in rats administered ≥0.5 
mg/kg); marrow of the femur (decreased adipocytes in females administered ≥0.5 mg/kg and one male 
administered 3 mg/kg); adrenal cortex (decreased incidence and/or severity of vacuolation in males 
administered ≥1.5 mg/kg); and heart (decreased incidence of cardiomyopathy in males administered ≥1.5 
mg/kg and females administered 3 mg/kg). 
At the terminal sacrifice, increased incidence of lobular atrophy in the pancreas of females was a test article-
related exacerbation of a background finding, with uncertain relationship to decreased terminal body weights

and/or decreased food consumption. All other microscopic findings were considered by the applicant 
secondary to decreased terminal body weights and/or decreased food consumption. 
At the recovery sacrifice, no test article-related differences were noted in microscopic findings, except for 
persistence of lobular atrophy in the pancreas (females). 
Study 8336517 (monkey 6 mo, 4 wk recovery) 
Male and female cynomolgus monkeys were assigned to four groups, and doses were administered as 
indicated in the following table. Animals were dosed via subcutaneous injection once weekly for 26 weeks at 
a volume of 0.1 mL/kg. The vehicle control article was 10 mM tris, 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), and

Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical observations, body weights, food consumption, 
ophthalmic observations, electrocardiographic (ECG) measurements, laboratory parameters (haematology, 
serum chemistry, coagulation, urine chemistry; calcitonin plasma levels were not determined) and 
macroscopic and microscopic pathology. Blood samples were collected for toxicokinetic and active drug 
assessment evaluations. 
Results 
Mortality 
All animals survived to their scheduled sacrifice. 
Clinical signs 
Dehydration was noted by technical staff on Day 12 in five males and one female administered 0.5 mg/kg, on 
Day 33 in two females administered 0.5 mg/kg, and on Day 33 and 34 in one male administered 0.15 mg/kg. 
A request for veterinary services was made for some of these occurrences. All groups were supplemented 
with fruit and other dietary options for the duration of the study to avoid dehydration and body weight loss as 
far as possible. 
Body weight 
Test article-related decreased body weights were observed for individual animals administered 0.5 mg/kg 
through the first 12 days of the dosing phase. Overall body weight gains were significantly lower for males 
administered ≥0.05 mg/kg and for females administered 0.5 mg/kg (non-significant). These decreases 
correlated with a higher incidence of low food consumption,

Administration of 0.15 or 0.5 mg/kg was associated with higher heart rates, primarily during the dark cycle 
(8 through 19 hours postdose), on all three occasions (Day 8, 78, or 169 of the dosing phase) where an ECG 
was obtained. Increase was 19 (18%) and 31 bpm (30%) in animals administered 0.15 or 0.5 mg/kg. 
Laboratory findings 
The only finding was mildly and transiently increased serum lipase activity on Day 15 of the dosing phase in 
two males administered 0.5 mg/kg. Otherwise no changes in haematology, coagulation or clinical chemistry 
were noted. 
Organ weights  
There was non-statistically significant trend toward decreased spleen weight parameters in males 
administered 0.15 or 0.5 mg/kg 
No test-article-related macroscopic findings were made 
Microscopic findings 
At the terminal sacrifice, LY3298176-related microscopic findings were limited to the pancreas and consisted 
of minimally decreased zymogen granules in two females administered 0.5 mg/kg. This finding correlated 
with the increased frequency of low food consumption in females administered 0.5 mg/kg (compared with 
controls). 
All other microscopic findings were considered by the applicant spontaneous and/or incidental because they 
occurred at a low incidence, were randomly distributed across groups (including concurrent controls), and/or 
their severity was as expected for cynomolgus monkeys of this age. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Tirzepatide a chemically synthesized peptide is not expected to interact directly with DNA. Therefore, 
according to ICH S6 [R1] a mutagenicity assessments (e.g. AMES) was not conducted. 
In vivo tirzepatide was negative for clastogenic effects in a chromosome aberration test (micronuclei in bone 
marrow cells) in rats. The exposure (AUC) at the highest dose tested (3 mg/kg → MTD) corresponded 
approximately to the clinical exposure and no safety margin was established (SM ~ 1). Dose limiting effects 
on body weight and food consumption were consistent with, or secondary to, incretin pharmacology and 
effects reported with long acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. 
In conclusion, tirzepatide did not exert any genotoxic potential based on the studies performed. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity testing of tirzepatide was carried out in a 2-year study in Crl:CD(SD) rats and a 6 month 
study in hemizygous Tg.rasH2 mice [CByB6F1-Tg(HRAS)2Jic (+/-hemizygous c-Ha-ras)] in compliance with 
GLP.  
As observed in the toxicology studies in rodents, in both carcinogenicity studies dose-limiting effects on body 
weight and food consumption were consistent with, or secondary to, exaggerated incretin pharmacology and 
effects reported with long acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. No other signs of direct target organ toxicity or off-
Assessment report

target effects were observed in mice. In rats dose dependent mild to severe unilaterally and bilaterally focal 
C-cell hyperplasia in the thyroid was considered as a pre-neoplastic lesion and is consistent with findings 
reported for GLP-1 receptor agonists. 
Tirzepatide was not carcinogenic in a short-term carcinogenicity study in mice at exposures 12 x above 
expected clinical exposures. Neoplasms that occurred in control and tirzepatide treated groups represented 
the types commonly reported and representative of the spontaneous, background findings observed for the 
RasH2 mouse model in 6-months studies. 
In the long-term carcinogenicity study in rats, tirzepatide showed an increase in C-cell adenomas in all dose 
groups and C-cell carcinomas in the high dose groups in rodents at exposures comparable to clinical exposure 
(MoE ~ 1 x) without mortality up to the end of the study. The increase in C-cell hyperplasia/neoplasia is 
known for other long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, dulaglutide, semaglutide) and presumably 
rodent specific. Particularly for tirzepatide a relevance for humans cannot be ruled out since in contrast to 
“pure” GLP-1 receptor agonists tirzepatide caused an increase in serum calcitonin in humans (see clinical 
section). All other neoplasms that occurred in control and tirzepatide treated groups represented the types 
commonly reported and representative of the spontaneous, background findings observed for rats in a 
lifespan two year study. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In the rat, male fertility and early embryonic development study there were no effects on sperm parameters, 
reproductive performance, male reproductive organs, or early embryonic survival. In the rat female fertility 
and early embryonic development study, numbers of corpora lutea were decreased, resulting in decreased 
numbers of implantation sites and viable embryos. Estrous cycles were also disrupted. These effects were 
considered secondary to the decreased body weight and food consumption, noted at all dose levels. Similar 
effects were reported with long acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. There were no effects on mating, conception 
and fertility indices, pre-coital intervals, or implantation loss.  
In embryo-fetal development (EFD) studies with both rats and rabbits, tirzepatide caused pharmacology 
related effects on body weight, body weight gain, and/or food consumption in both rats and rabbits. 
At the high dose of 0.5 mg/kg (rat) and 0.1 mg/kg (rabbit), the maternal toxicity was significant and included 
clinical signs and sustained maternal body weight decreases, decreased body weight gain and food 
consumption. Increased incidences of malformations and developmental variations at 0.5 mg/kg in the rat 
were considered secondary to the lower mean fetal body weights at this dose level, which is seen in a 
consense to the maternal bodyweight decreases. Effects on fetal morphology, including increased numbers of 
malformations, have already been reported for other long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist class. Overall, it can 
be concluded that the developmental and reproductive effects occurred only at doses associated with 
maternal toxicity. In the rat pre-/postnatal study maternal systemic toxicity based on effects on body weight, 
body weight gain, and food consumption was seen at 0.25 mg/kg. In the offspring body weight and body 
weight gain for F1 males at 0.25 mg/kg was also negatively affected. Exposure and distribution in the milk of 
lactating rats was not investigated. A safety margin to the human exposure at therapeutic dose levels was 
not calculated. 
The effects in the rat juvenile toxicity study were the same/similar (pharmacology related effects on body 
weight, body weight gain, and/or food consumption) as in the toxicity studies with adult animals. Delays in 
the attainment of balanopreputial separation and vaginal patency at 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg were considered 
secondary to the decreased body weight, which is an effect of tirzepatide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 45/212 
 
 
 
Exposures at the NOAEL of all studies performed for reproductive and juvenile toxicity were in general below 
exposures at the MRHD. Accordingly, there are no safety margins to the human exposure at therapeutic dose 
levels in all studies. 
The findings in the fertility and embryo-fetal development studies as well as in the rat pre-/postnatal study 
are described in the SmPC.   
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
TK data were obtained in all larger toxicology studies. The results, sorted by species and dose, are tabulated 
below. The low doses (<1 mg/kg) given to rats are of little toxicological relevance and were omitted for 
clarity.

The exposure multiples (based on AUC) to human therapeutic exposure are tabulated below for the highest 
dose used in each toxicology study. Since the dosing interval was different between animals and humans, the 
applicant calculated an average plasma level (Cave) to allow comparison. Cave was obtained by dividing the 
AUC in the dosing interval (AUC(0-τ)) by the interval τ. 
The table below shows only the highest doses of each toxicology study for brevity. The main toxic effects 
were due to exaggerated pharmacodynamics, i.e. reduced water/food consumption and body weight loss so 
that a clear NOAEL cannot be derived. Even at the highest doses given, the exposure multiples were low in 
most cases. In the embryo-foetal studies they were markedly below one.

2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity  
For tirzepatide, a protein, the ICH S10 does not generally apply. Tirzepatide absorbed light at approximately 
280 nm that exhibits a spectral pattern that is typical for proteins and peptides and consistent with the 
known absorbance spectrum of proteins. Therefore, phototoxicity studies with tirzepatide were not 
conducted.   
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The ERA provided is considered complete and acceptable. No ERA studies are required with respect to the 
chemical nature of the molecule. Tirzepatide is administered in parenteral form and has been described to be 
not excreted in unchanged form (m1.6, m2.5, m5.3). It consists of 39 amino acids, two of them non-coded 
(aminoisobutyric acid, Aib in positions 2 and 13). The backbone of the peptide contains 2 methylated amid 
bonds, which are protected from cleavage by standard metabolic peptidases. However, the remaining amid-
bonds are susceptible to peptidase activity. Therefore, the peptide part is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. Also, the 1,20-eicosanedioic acid moiety are identical to naturally occurring substances. The 
fate of the linker (γ-Glu and two 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid moieties) is not known. 
Tirzepatide is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
PD 
Tirzepatide was developed as a long-acting agonist at the human GLP-1 and GIP receptor PD studies were 
performed in vitro and in vivo to substantiate the claimed actions. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that 
tirzepatide also binds to the GLP-1 and GIP receptor of the animal species used in PD and toxicology studies 
(mouse, rat, monkey, rabbit). 
In line with the mechanism that prolongs the duration of action, i.e. binding to albumin, tirzepatide’s affinity 
towards its receptors in vitro was strongly affected by the presence of albumin. Presence of bovine serum 
albumin (BSA) reduced receptor affinity by around two orders of magnitude (range, 95- to 172-fold) across 
species and receptor type (GIPR and GLP-1R); for rodent GIPR no data are available. 
The in vitro activity at the GIP receptor was clearly lower in rodents than in humans and monkey. In 
presence of bovine serum albumin (considered to be most relevant for the in vivo situation) the binding 
affinity for rat GIPR, Ki, was 96-fold higher (386 nM vs 4.02 nM) than for human GIPR. For the mouse, the 
difference was even higher. If this finding is true (see above), this would mean in consequence that the 
contribution of GIPR in in vivo studies in the rat and mouse safety studies is uncertain, in particular since the 
pharmacological effect on food consumption and body weight limited the exposure in these studies. The 
applicant argued that the measurement of affinity in presence of albumin is uncertain, and that evidence 
from in vivo studies is more relevant. In particular, it was referred to the studies in knock-out mice with 
deletion of the GLP-1 receptor. The respective findings are discussed further below. 
Receptor activation was studied in vitro by measuring cAMP formation in HEK293 cells artificially 
overexpressing GIPR or GLP-1R. In this model, the amount of expressed receptor strongly affected EC50 
(decreasing EC50 with increasing receptor density). The applicant explained this phenomenon with the 
presence of spare receptors. In this case, activation of a small fraction of receptors is sufficient to elicit the 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 48/212 
 
 
 
maximal response, and EC50 no longer corresponds to receptor affinity. It is not known whether the presence 
of a large fraction of spare receptors reflects the situation in vivo or whether it is only due to the artificial 
overexpression. 
Activation of the GLP-1 receptor is expected to enhance glucose-induced insulin secretion like established 
pure GLP-1 receptor agonists such as exenatide, liraglutide and semaglutide do. Therefore, in many in vivo 
PD studies the tirzepatide effect was compared to the effect of semaglutide. Furthermore, GLP-1 receptor 
agonists (RAs) reduce food intake and body weight, probably mainly by direct action on certain brain areas. 
Due to this mechanism of action, the applicant studied insulin secretion and related parameters in vitro 
(primary cultured islets) and in vivo (glucose clamp studies, glucose uptake in vivo, food consumption etc.). 
Most studies were performed in animal models of diabetes and obesity, predominantly in diet-induced-obesity 
(DIO) mice or rats. Tirzepatide and the comparator semaglutide (if present) showed the expected effects on 
glucose-induced insulin secretion, food intake and body weight. In one study, the applicant also employed 
pair-feeding (i.e. in an untreated group food was restricted to the amount which was consumed by the 
tirzepatide-treated group). By this means, it was possible to distinguish direct effects of tirzepatide and 
semaglutide on glucose control from indirect effects of weight loss. In most cases the effect size of 
semaglutide was smaller than that of tirzepatide, but it is unclear whether the semaglutide dose was 
appropriate. In some experiments, the applicant has studied the effect of ascending semaglutide doses, but a 
maximally effective dose could not consistently be established. Thus, it remains unclear whether the maximal 
size of the semaglutide effect was reached in all studies. 
As tirzepatide acts as an agonist not only on the GLP-1 but also on the GIP receptors, actions beyond the 
known GLP-1 receptor mediated effects would be expected. Beside insulin secretion, GIP is known to affect 
glucagon liberation and adipose tissue metabolism. In order to demonstrate GIP receptor activation by 
tirzepatide in vivo, the applicant conducted studies with animals lacking the GIP receptor (GIP receptor 
knock-out [KO] mice). For comparison, GLP-1 receptor KO mice were also studied in parallel. It turned out 
that tirzepatide had similar effects in GIP receptor KO and wild-type animals. This indicates that in the 
presence of the GLP-1 receptor the GIP receptor has only minor metabolic effects. GIP receptor effects 
became obvious in GLP-1 receptor KO mice. The GIP receptor effects in GLP-1 receptor KO mice effects were 
qualitatively similar to the known GLP-1 receptor effects but required somewhat higher tirzepatide doses. 
This indicates that GIP receptors can substitute for GLP-1 receptors if the latter are absent. 
However, the applicant could not clearly demonstrate a metabolic effect of GIP receptor activation in wild-
type animals. As mentioned above, the effects of semaglutide were quantitatively smaller than the effects of 
tirzepatide in the metabolism studies (which may depend on the doses used), but a clear qualitative 
difference between tirzepatide and semaglutide could not be demonstrated in vivo. In vitro, Tirzepatide, like 
GIP, caused cAMP production and lipolysis in cultured adipocytes after single administration. A pure GLP-1 RA 
was not tested in this setting. 
In respect to the lack of a clear GIP-receptor-dependent component of the tirzepatide effect in vivo, it is 
important that the applicant also has conducted extensive studies on β-arrestin binding and internalisation of 
the GLP-1 and GIP receptors in vitro. By this internalisation process, triggered by binding of the receptor to 
β-arrestin, the receptor disappears from the cell surface and therefore becomes inactive, as it no longer can 
react to extracellular GLP-1 or GIP. It turned out that tirzepatide, in contrast to the endogenous ligand, did 
not inactivate the GLP-1 receptor after prolonged stimulation. A similar effect was reported for other 
therapeutic GLP-1 RAs; this probably is the mechanistic basis for the fact that GLP-1 RAs remain effective 
despite their permanent presence in the body during therapy. However, the GIP receptor rapidly became 
internalised after tirzepatide binding as it became after binding of the endogenous ligand GIP. This is a strong 
Assessment report

hint that in case of chronic tirzepatide administration the GIP receptor becomes down-regulated so that GIP-
receptor-mediated effects may not play a role in the intended long-term therapy with tirzepatide. 
Taken together, there was no clear evidence for GIP-mediated effects in most rodent studies. This could be 
related to GIP receptor down-regulation. Alternatively, tirzepatide could have a low affinity to rodent GIP 
receptors. 
As further discussed in other sections, the tirzepatide effects (desired and undesired) observed in clinical 
trials also were highly similar to the known effects of pure GLP-1 RAs. The only salient difference in respect to 
safety was that tirzepatide, unlike pure GLP-1 RAs, increased serum calcitonin levels in humans. This to date 
was only known from rodents (see toxicology section below). 
Another known effect of GLP-1 RAs is the delay of gastric emptying. This may cause drug-drug interactions 
(DDIs) by delaying the absorption of concomitantly administered substances. However, the applicant 
demonstrated in animals that gastric emptying is affected by tirzepatide only for a short period of time 
immediately after start of treatment. Thus, the potential for DDIs would be transient. Furthermore, effects of 
gastric emptying on drug absorption can be modelled fairly well. On the other hand, tirzepatide may not only 
gastric emptying but also motility of the small intestine. This may lead to more complex DDIs which most 
likely are not easy to model because the factors affecting intestinal absorption of a drug are difficult to 
measure so that the model cannot be informed. The applicant pointed out that tirzepatide’s effects on GI 
motility (gastric emptying and intestinal transit) most likely are related to its GLP1R agonistic effects and 
hence are similar to the effects of pure GLP-1RAs. No studies on the effect of tirzepatide on intestinal transit 
time were performed. Such data – as they are difficult to obtain – were only reported for liraglutide in the 
published literature. Thus, in respect to GI-related DDIs, data from pure GLP-1RAs probably can be 
transferred to tirzepatide. 
PK 
The applicant has performed a somewhat reduced PK programme since tirzepatide is a (modified) peptide. 
Tirzepatide consists of a peptide chain of 39 amino acids, including two non-natural amino acids 
(aminoisobutyric acid Aib) and a fatty acid side chain, attached to the peptide chain via a linker which in part 
resembles polyethylene glycol.  
Due to the SC way of administration, studies on the mechanism of absorption were not needed. And since 
tirzepatide is not a substrate for CYP enzymes or drug transporters, the effect of CYP inhibitors/inducers and 
transporter inhibitors on tirzepatide metabolism were not studied. 
Distribution was studies with radiolabelled tirzepatide whereby the label was attached to the linker. The 
highest levels of radioactivity were found at the Injection sites and in kidneys.  
Despite being a peptide, extensive metabolism studies were performed with tirzepatide, primarily to follow 
the fate of the linker region of the molecule, which is a non-natural compound. The peptide chain and the 
fatty acid of tirzepatide were degraded like endogenous peptides and fatty acids, respectively, by proteolytic 
cleavage and beta-oxidation. 
No circulating metabolites representing >10% of the total radioactive drug-related exposure were observed 
in rats, monkeys, or humans. All human plasma metabolites were identified in rat and monkey plasma. 
Tirzepatide did not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes and did not inhibit drug transporters. 
Taken together, PK of tirzepatide does not give rise to concerns.

Since tirzepatide is intended to be used chronically in humans, a rather constant plasma level is intended. 
Hence the applicant reported steady-state concentrations (Css) from human repeated-dose studies whereas 
in animal studies usually AUC(0-t) was reported. Thus, comparison of human and animal exposure is difficult, 
also because of the different dosing intervals (τ). To circumvent this problem, the applicant calculated 
average plasma levels in animals in humans by dividing AUC(0-τ) by τ. This approach is considered suitable. 
Toxicology 
The most prominent finding in the repeated-dose studies was a pronounced reduction in weight gain or even 
weight loss in the tirzepatide-treated groups of all species tested. This was obviously due to reduced food 
intake. There were accompanying macroscopic and microscopic findings e.g. atrophy of adipose tissue and 
thymus as well as changes in organ weights. The applicant assumes that all these changes are secondary to 
the weight loss. This is most likely true for the adipose tissue atrophy, but in other organs, it cannot fully be 
excluded that the massive weight loss and its sequels have masked some direct toxic effects. 
A problem of this exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect was that the maximally tolerated dose was low. Not 
only reduced food intake but also reduced water intake reduced survival and thereby was dose-limiting. The 
applicant took efforts to increase food and water intake of the animals by offering tasty food and beverage 
(fruit juice) or a special commercial DietGel intended for use in animals of poor condition to increase water 
and caloric intake. 
Nevertheless, the exposure resulting from highest tolerated doses in the repeated-dose, reproductive and 
carcinogenicity studies were not far above the human therapeutic exposure. This limits the value of the 
toxicology studies for predicting human safety. Higher exposures were reached with authorised pure GLP-1 
RAs. This could be because slow dose up-titration at the start of treatment was performed in the repeated-
dose studies, as it is done in human therapy. It is known from human studies that immediate administration 
of therapeutic GLP-1 RA doses leads to strong nausea and other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Less severe 
symptoms occur upon slow dose up-titration. At least in this case the undesired GI symptoms largely 
disappear after a few weeks. It can be expected that similar GI symptoms are responsible for the strongly 
reduced food intake in the toxicology studies. One can assume that also the strong GI effects following full 
dosing in drug-naïve animals will disappear after a certain time, but this is not necessarily the case. It cannot 
be excluded that the strong GI effects limited food and water intake over the complete study period in the 
animals. The applicant explained that dose up-titration was not performed because no beneficial effect was 
expected. According to the applicant, pure GLP-1RAs reduce food intake for a certain peroid of time only 
whereas tirzepatide reduced food intake persisted. Hence, the applicant assumed that no accomodation takes 
place so that up-titration would be meaningless. However, this notion may not be fully correct since in 
patients dose up-titration is successfully employed 
In the previous CHMP Scientific Advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/689326/2018) the possible anabolic effects of GIP 
on bone were discussed. The company was advised to study the effect of tirzepatide on bone parameters. 
The applicant has discussed available data, showing no anabolic activity on bone of tirzepatide in rats or 
monkeys. They presented evidence that such anabolic activity would readily be detected by microscopy in the 
context of standard toxicity studies. 
Tirzepatide did not exert any genotoxic potential based on the studies performed.  
Carcinogenicity testing of tirzepatide was carried out in a 2-year study in Crl:CD(SD) rats and a 6 month 
study in hemizygous Tg.rasH2 mice [CByB6F1-Tg(HRAS)2Jic (+/-hemizygous c-Ha-ras)] in compliance with 
GLP. In the 6-month study, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) was used as positive control at a dose of 75 
mg/kg, which is often used in this animal model.

As observed in the toxicology studies in rodents, in both carcinogenicity studies dose-limiting effects on body 
weight and food consumption were consistent with, or secondary to, exaggerated incretin pharmacology and 
effects reported with long acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. No other signs of direct target organ toxicity or off-
target effects were observed in mice. In rats dose dependent mild to severe unilaterally and bilaterally focal 
C-cell hyperplasia in the thyroid was considered as a pre-neoplastic lesion and is consistent with findings 
reported for GLP-1 receptor agonists). The relevance for humans is considered low for established GLP-1 
receptor agonists. However, since tirzepatide is not a pure GLP-1 receptor agonist, the relevance for humans 
is unclear in this case.  
In case of pure GLP-1 RAs, it is established that C-cell proliferation is rodent-specific because non-rodents 
including humans do not express GLP-1 receptors on the C-cells. In rodents, C-cell proliferation is 
accompanied by increased plasma calcitonin levels (not measured in case of tirzepatide), indicating that C-
cell hyperplasia in rodents is an adaptive response of the C-cells to increased calcitonin production and 
secretion. Accordingly, elevation of plasma calcitonin is not found in humans with pure GLP-1 RAs. However, 
a small but clear and consistent increase in plasma calcitonin was found in humans treated with tirzepatide in 
the phase 3 trials. Thus, in this respect the action of tirzepatide differs from the action of pure GLP-1 RAs.  
Tirzepatide was not carcinogenic in a short-term carcinogenicity study in mice at exposures 12 x above 
expected clinical exposures. Neoplasms that occurred in control and tirzepatide treated groups represented 
the types commonly reported and representative of the spontaneous, background findings observed for the 
RasH2 mouse model in 6 months studies. 
In the rat, male fertility and early embryonic development study there were no effects on sperm parameters, 
reproductive performance, male reproductive organs, or early embryonic survival. In the rat female fertility 
and early embryonic development study, numbers of corpora lutea were decreased, resulting in decreased 
numbers of implantation sites and viable embryos. Estrous cycles were also disrupted. These effects were 
considered secondary to the decreased body weight and food consumption, noted at all dose levels.  Similar 
effects were reported with long acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. There were no effects on mating, conception 
and fertility indices, pre-coital intervals, or implantation loss.  
In embryo-fetal development (EFD) studies with both rats and rabbits, tirzepatide caused pharmacology 
related effects on body weight, body weight gain, and/or food consumption in both rats and rabbits. 
At the high dose of 0.5 mg/kg (rat) and 0.1 mg/kg (rabbit), the maternal toxicity was significant and included 
clinical signs and sustained maternal body weight decreases, decreased body weight gain and food 
consumption. Increased incidences of malformations and developmental variations at 0.5 mg/kg in the rat 
were considered secondary to the lower mean foetal body weights at this dose level, which is seen in a 
consense to the maternal bodyweight decreases. Effects on foetal morphology, including increased numbers 
of malformations, have already been reported for other long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist class. Overall, it 
can be concluded that the developmental and reproductive effects occurred only at doses associated with 
maternal toxicity. In the rat pre-/postnatal study maternal systemic toxicity based on effects on body weight, 
body weight gain, and food consumption was seen at 0.25 mg/kg. In the offspring body weight and body 
weight gain for F1 males at 0.25 mg/kg was also negatively affected. Exposure and distribution in the milk of 
lactating rats was not investigated. A safety margin to the human exposure at therapeutic dose levels was 
not calculated. 
While it is agreed that maternal toxicity have contributed to the foetal findings in the embryo-foetal toxicity 
studies, a direct effect on the foetus cannot fully be excluded. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC.

The effects in the rat juvenile toxicity study were the same/similar (pharmacology related effects on body 
weight, body weight gain, and/or food consumption) as in the toxicity studies with adult animals. Delays in 
the attainment of balanopreputial separation and vaginal patency at 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg were considered 
secondary to the decreased body weight, which is an effect of tirzipatide. 
Exposures at the NOAEL of all studies performed for reproductive and juvenile toxicity were in general below 
exposures at the MRHD. Accordingly, there are no safety margins to the human exposure at therapeutic dose 
levels in all studies. 
Environmental Risk Assessment 
There are no open issues left in the ERA. The ERA provided is considered complete and acceptable. No ERA 
studies are required with respect to the chemical nature of the molecule. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical PD studies demonstrated that the effects of tirzepatide are in line with known effects of GLP-1 
receptor agonists on receptor binding/activation, insulin liberation, blood glucose excursion after glucose 
challenge, and body weight. Effects related to the GIP receptor became clearly obvious only in animals 
lacking the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1 receptor knock-out mice). Furthermore, it turned out that the GIP 
receptor, in contrast to the GLP-1 receptor rapidly became inactivated upon binding of tirzepatide. Thus, the 
relevance of GIP receptor binding for the pharmacodynamic profile of tirzepatide could not be clearly 
established. Virtually all PD effects of tirzepatide were qualitatively highly similar to the effects of pure GLP-1 
receptor agonists. 
In the toxicology studies, the predominant finding was dose-limiting strong weight loss that can be regarded 
as exaggerated PD effect. Therefore, the margins to human therapeutic exposure were low, but this is not 
regarded as a major concern since the safety profile of GLP-1 receptor agonists is well known (and the action 
of tirzepatide on the GIP receptor appears to play a minor role, see above). 
In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, hyperplasia and neoplasia of the thyroid C-cells were observed, again 
in line with the known effects of pure GLP-1 receptor agonists. This effect usually is accompanied by increase 
in serum calcitonin (not measured in this study). Serum calcitonin increase followed by C-cell hyperplasia and 
neoplasia is considered rodent-specific in case of pure GLP-1 receptor agonists, and with the latter, no serum 
calcitonin increaser in humans is observed. However, in case of tirzepatide, calcitonin increase consistently 
was found in humans. This is further discussed in the clinical section. 
The active substance is a protein covalently linked with 20 fatty acids, excretion of the intact molecule from 
humans does not occur. Therefore, tirzepatide is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community

were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
The main clinical studies contributing to efficacy of tirzepatide on glycaemic control in adult patients with 
T2DM are summarized below:  
• Two Phase 2 studies: GPGB and GPGF, and 
• Five global Phase 3 studies GPGK, GPGL, GPGH; GPGM, GPGI. 
All Phase 3 trials were randomized, parallel group, multinational trials. These trials were designed to 
establish: 
• superiority of tirzepatide to placebo (GPGK and GPGI), and 
• non-inferiority and superiority of tirzepatide to active comparator (GPGL, GPGH and GPGM). 
The active comparators in the Phase 3 studies were subcutaneous semaglutide 1 mg (GPGL), insulin degludec 
(U100) [GPGH], or insulin glargine (U100) [GPGM]. 
Efficacy in Phase 3 studies 
The primary efficacy measure in all five global Phase 3 studies was mean change in HbA1c from baseline to 
the primary endpoint at 40 or 52 weeks. Secondary efficacy measures, including mean change in body 
weight, FSG, 7-point SMBG, and proportions of patients achieving HbA1c and weight loss targets, were also 
evaluated. Study GPGM collected long-term, comparator-controlled safety and efficacy data up to 104 weeks. 
The Phase 3 studies were designed to assess safety and efficacy in a broad T2DM patient population across 
different stages of the T2DM treatment continuum. The study population included patients who were: 
• 
• 
• 
relatively newly diagnosed and on diet and exercise only 
inadequately controlled on up to 3 OAM(s) (including patients with increased CV risk), or  
inadequately controlled on basal insulin, with or without metformin. 
Study GPGM included patients with increased risk of CV events and/or impaired renal function. 
Because of differences among the trials in, for example, background therapies, treatment durations, patient 
characteristics, and comparators, pooling of the efficacy data across these studies was not performed.  
The tables below present the primary endpoint and key design features of the two Phase 2 studies and the 
five global Phase 3 studies.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
The 10 biopharmaceutic and clinical pharmacology phase 1 studies were designed to assess the PK, PD, the 
effects of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on tirzepatide PK, the impact of tirzepatide on PK of orally 
administered drugs, and safety and tolerability of tirzepatide. Single doses of tirzepatide were administered 
over a range of 0.25 to 8 mg, and multiple once-weekly doses that ranged from 0.5 to 15 mg for up to 28 
weeks. The effect of tirzepatide on insulin and glucagon secretion and insulin sensitivity was assessed in a 
dedicated mechanism of action study. 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Following subcutaneous administration of tirzepatide, median time to peak concentration (tmax) was achieved 
approximately 24 hours (range 8 to 72 hours) postdose.  
Pharmacokinetic characteristic of tirzepatide on Day 1 for Study I8F-MC-GPGA (Part A) 
Dose-proportionality analysis over the single dose range of 0.25 to 8 mg resulted in a ratio of dose-
normalized geometric means in exposure (AUC and Cmax) of about 0.8 to 0.85. 
The absolute bioavailability of a 5-mg subcutaneous dose of tirzepatide in healthy participants was 80%.  
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 57/212 
 
 
 
 
 
Tirzepatide can be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, upper arm, or thigh, without need for any dose 
adjustment. 
Distribution 
For single dose in healthy subjects, the apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase after extra-
vascular administration (Vz/F) was 7.83 L (study GPGA). Mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) in 
patients with T2DM after multiple dosing was 10.3 L. After 0.5-mg IV bolus administration, the mean volume 
of distribution (Vz) was 5.52 L (study GPGE part D) indicating that tirzepatide distributes primarily in the 
blood volume. Tirzepatide was highly bound to albumin in human plasma with a mean percent bound of 99 
%. 
Elimination 
Tirzepatide is a dual-action incretin mimetic that was designed as a 39 amino acid synthetic peptide that 
exerts its function by binding either the GIP or GLP-1 receptor with high affinity. The structure was 
engineered from the GIP sequence and includes a C20 fatty diacid moiety. The molecular weight is 4.8 kDa.  
Tirzepatide has a mean half-life of approximately 5 days. 
Tirzepatide is eliminated through metabolism. The primary metabolic pathways that contributed to the 
clearance of tirzepatide were proteolytic cleavages of the peptide backbone, β-oxidation of the C20 fatty 
diacid moiety and amide hydrolysis. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The following graph show the tirzepatide concentrations in a 90-kg individual using the tirzepatide population 
pharmacokinetic model. The solid lines denote concentrations following dose escalation up to 5, 10, or 15 
mg. Dose escalation started with 2.5 mg and dose amount was increased by a 2.5-mg increment every 4 
weeks. The dashed line denotes concentrations following a single 2.5-mg dose. Tirzepatide doses were 
administered once weekly. 
Tirzepatide PK was generally similar between healthy participants and patients with T2DM.

No clinically relevant effects on the PK of a single SC dose of 5 mg tirzepatide were observed for participants 
with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment or ESRD when compared to participants with normal renal 
function. 
The overall exposure to tirzepatide, based on AUC(0-∞) and Cmax and tmax, was similar across the control and 
hepatic impairment groups. 
Sex and race (Asian, black, or white) were not found to be of significance after accounting for influence of 
body weight. 
Body weight was identified to have a significant influence on tirzepatide PK. As tirzepatide treatment is 
associated with significant weight loss over time, body weight was evaluated as a time-varying as well as a 
baseline covariate. Approximately, every kilogram increase in weight was associated with a 1.1% decrease in 
tirzepatide exposure (AUC0-τ). 
Age was tested as a continuous covariate on tirzepatide PK and was not found to be of significance. 
Approximately 1427 (25%) participants were aged between 65 and 75 years and 214 (4%) participants were 
at least75 years.

The drug-drug interactions mediated by tirzepatide, are expected primarily because incretins are known to 
cause gastric emptying delay which can influence the rate of absorption (Cmax, tmax) without greatly 
influencing overall extent of absorption (AUC) of orally administered concomitant drugs. This was confirmed 
by studies with acetaminophen and oral contraceptive.  
Within study GPGA the impact of tirzepatide on gastric emptying delay was studied using acetaminophen as a 
gastric emptying marker. Subjects received 1 g acetaminophen on Day −1 (prior to study drug dosing) at a 
time corresponding to the approximate LY3298176 Cmax (about 24 hours after the first and fourth dose of 
study drug). 
Data in patients with T2DM (part C) with 5 mg LY3298176 on Day 1 and Day 8, 10 mg LY3298176 on Day 15 
and 15 mg LY3298176 on Day 22 
Results: 
  In healthy subjects and in patients with T2DM, acetaminophen Cmax decreased approximately 50% after 
the first 5-mg dose of tirzepatide and Tmax was delayed by about an hour, thereby suggesting delay in 
gastric emptying. 
  Impact on acetaminophen PK was greatest after the first dose of tirzepatide and showed diminishing 
effect with time (tachyphylaxis) with repeated QW dosing. 
Study GPGR participants was conducted to evaluate the effects of tirzepatide on oral contraceptive. 
Each OC cycle consisted of 21 days of active combination tablet (ethinyl estradiol 0.035 mg + norgestimate 
0.25 mg) followed by 7 days of placebo. OC alone in period 1 was compared with OC + tirzepatide 5 mg in 
period 2. Additionally, each participant received 1 dose of tirzepatide on Day 20 of Period 2, administered via 
pre-filled syringe (i.e., one SC injection of 5 mg tirzepatide into the abdomen). 
Ethinyl Estradiol (EE) 
The Cmax of EE was reduced by 59% (ratio of geometric means [90% CI]: 0.410 [0.355, 0.473]) when OC 
was administered in the presence of single dose of 5-mg tirzepatide compared to OC alone. This was

accompanied by a delay in tmax of OC of approximately 4 hours (median of differences [90% CI]: 4.23 [1.50, 
6.50]). 
Overall exposure, as measured by AUC(0-τ), and AUC(0-tlast) was reduced by about 20% (ratio of geometric 
means [90% CI]: 0.788 [0.730, 0.850], and 0.800 [0.722, 0.888]), respectively. 
Norgestimate is rapidly metabolized by first-pass (intestinal and/or hepatic) mechanisms to Norelgestromin 
and Norgestrel, which are the major active metabolites of Norgestimate. Hence the results for Norelgestromin 
are considered more robust. 
Norelgestromin (NGMN) 
The Cmax of NGMN decreased by approximately 55% (ratio of geometric means [90% CI]: 0.451 [0.402, 
0.505]), when OC was administered in the presence of single dose of 5-mg tirzepatide compared to OC 
alone. There was also a delay in tmax of OC of 4.5 hours (median of differences [90% CI]: 4.50 [1.50, 
5.00]). 
Overall exposure, as measured by AUC(0-tlast) and AUC(0-τ) was reduced by 16 and 23% (ratio of geometric 
means [90% CI]: 0.838 [0.771, 0.912], and 0.775 [0.712, 0.843]), respectively, when OC was administered 
in the presence of tirzepatide compared to OC alone. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
4 studies were submitted to adress PD endpoints in phase 1 and 2. PD assessment was included in Study 
GPHX (Disposition of radioactivity and PK, few PD data on glucose parameters and vital signs), study GPGA 
included a Single- and multiple-dose PD evaluation in healthy participants, and a multiple-dose PD evaluation 
in patients with T2DM. Study GPGC included a multiple-dose PD evaluation in Japanese patients with T2DM 
and Study GPGT investigated the effect of tirzepatide on pancreatic α and β cell function and insulin 
sensitivity in patients with T2DM. A concentration effect analysis for QTcF and PR interval was provided based 
on phase 1 and 2 clinical data and a PopPK PD analysis integrating data from the phase 3 trial. 
Mechanism of action 
Tirzepatide is a dual-action incretin mimetic that was designed as a 39 amino acid synthetic peptide that exerts 
its function by binding either the GIP or GLP-1 receptor with high affinity.  
Key effects of GLP-1 and GIP as described in the literature are summarized in Table 2.5.1.1 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 61/212 
 
 
 
 
The concept of designing a drug with agonistic effects on both GLP-1 and GIP receptors in patients with T2DM 
may  be  to  combine  positive  effects  of  both  pathways:  Increase  the  sensitivity  of  beta  cells  to  glucose  and 
insulin release via both pathways under hyperglycaemic conditions and counterregulate a decrease in GLP-1 
mediated  glucagon  secretion  by  an  activation  of  glucagon  secretion  via  GIP  receptor  activation  under 
hypoglycaemic  conditions,  thereby  further  reducing  the  likelihood  of  hypoglycaemia.  In  addition,  GLP-1 
mediated effects on GI mobility, a decrease in appetite and an increase in satiety may be complemented by 
GIP mediated effects on adipose tissue in order to contribute to weight reduction in overweight patients with 
T2DM. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary Pharmacodynamic effects 
Fasting and Postprandial Plasma Glucose:  
Tirzepatide decreased FPG and PPG concentrations as well as glucose AUC after an OGTT. Significant effects 
were seen at doses of 5 mg QW or higher after the first dose up to a maximally investigated target dose of 10 
or 15 mg QW. The effect was sustained up to day 64 in phase 2 studies and up to week 52 in phase three 
studies. PK/PD modelling including phase 3 data showed a dose response with relevant effect on FPG between 
5 mg QW and up to 15 mg QW. 
In patients with T2DM who received once weekly 15 mg doses for 28 weeks (Study GPHT, Standardized Mixed-
Meal  Tolerance  Test),  fasting  glucose  concentrations,  and  post-prandial  serum  gAUC0-240  min  were 
significantly  reduced  compared  to  placebo  (-2.61  mMol/L,  -373.7  (mMol/L)*min  mg/dL,  respectively).  The 
effects were significantly larger than those observed with 1 mg Semaglutide, a GLP-1R agonist. 
HbA1c 
In multiple dose trials in patients with T2DM, tirzepatide consistently decreased HbA1c in a dose dependent 
manner. In study GBHT, a significant mean reduction in HbA1c of -2.33 % (mean baseline HbA1c 7.83%) was 
observed  after  once  weekly  tirzepatide  15  mg  dosing  for  28  weeks  compared  to  placebo.  The  effect  was 
significantly larger than the effect observed with semaglutide 1 mg QW (- 1.57%). In study GPGA the LS mean 
difference vs. placebo was -0.58 % on day 29 after multiple ascending doses of 5/5/10/15 mg (study GPGA). 
In Japanese patients with T2DM the mean decrease in HbA1c was -2.05% at day 57 at a maintenance dose of 
15 mg QW after weekly uptitration from 5 to 10 to 15 mg QW (predose value 8.19%) (Study GPGC). 
First and second phase insulin secretion and glucose-dependent insulin secretion and beta cell function  
Tirzepatide improved first-phase insulin secretion (0 – 8 min) and increased second phase insulin (20 – 120 
min)  in  response  to  i.v.  glucose  (hyperglycaemic  clamp)  in  patients  with  T2DM  (study  GBCT).  In  addition, 
maximal insulin secretion, as provoked by a 5-g bolus of arginin, was increased by tirzepatide.  
Beta  cell  function  improved  as  assessed  by  an  increase  of  the  Clamp  disposition  index  (cDI).  At  Week  28, 
change from baseline in cDI was + 4.2% for placebo, + 338.3% for semaglutide (1 mg QW), and + 596.9% 
for tirzepatide (15 mg QW, study GPHT). Consistently, HOMA-B improved in patients with T2DM (baseline mean 
value: 41.1, day 23: 95.4, for 5/5/10/15 mg QW, study GPGA).  
β cell sensitivity to glucose (GS) significantly increased with tirzepatide 15 mg QW from baseline to week 28 
from  17.2  to  92.3  (mean  values,  pmol  insulin  secreted/min/m2/pmol/l  glucose)  in  patients  with  T2DM.  The 
effect  was  significantly  larger  than  the  effect  of  semaglutide  (from  16.8  to  77.3,  clamp  study  GPHT). 
Consistently,  β  cell  sensitivity  to  glucose  numerically  increased  as  assessed  based  on  Insulin  secretion  rate

(ISR) from the Standardized Mixed-Meal Tolerance Test (sMMTT) by 13.5 pmol/min/m2/[mmol/L], (95% CI [-
1.3, 28.4] p-value=0.074, T2DM, study GPHT). 
In  the  sMMTT  (study  GPHT,  T2DM)  mean  fasting  insulin,  total  insulin  AUC0-240  and  incremental  AUC0-240 
decreased with tirzepatide 15 mg (week 28) by - 10.3 pMol/L (mean baseline 57.2 pMol/L), approximately 36% 
and 41%, respectively. The reduction in C-peptide was similar. However, at a fixed glucose concentration of 
7.2 mmol/L tirzepatide increased insulin release from baseline in these patients. 
Whole body insulin sensitivity 
HOMA-IR  increased  slightly  from  a  mean  of  2.0  to  2.5  in  this  group  (placebo  from  1.8  to  2.2).  However, 
Tirzepatide increased the M-value by approximately 63% in the Hyperinsulinemic Euglycaemic Clamp study in 
patients with T2DM indicating an increased whole body insulin sensitivity (GPHT, day 28 15 mg QW). The effect 
was significantly larger than the effect of semaglutide 1 mg QW (+ 35%)). 
Glucagon secretion 
Glucagon  concentration  parameters  during  sMMTT  decreased  significantly  with  tirzepatide  from  baseline  to 
week 28 (15 mg QW) in patients with T2DM. Mean fasting values prior to sMMTT were 11.8 pmol/L at baseline 
and  8.4  at  week  28  (Placebo  15.2  and  15.3,  respectively).  Total  glucagon  AUC0-240  min  during  sMMTT 
decreased  by  a  mean  of  -1625.4  pmol/min  (mean  baseline  values  4016.6  (placebo:  -  207.7  study  GPHT). 
Incremental AUC-240 was reduced by -552.0 pMol/L*min. The changes were numerically similar but overall 
less pronounced with semaglutide.  
Secondary Pharmacodynamic effects 
Gastric Emptying: Tirzepatide delayed gastric emptying at first doses of 4.5 and 5 mg in healthy subjects and 
patients with T2DM (study GPGA). The effect was time dependent. It disappeared after repeated administration 
of 4.5 mg QW and decreased upon ascending doses (5/8/15/10) mg by day 23 in healthy volunteers. In patients 
with T2DM the effect decreased by day 23 at a constant dose of 5 mg PW. Following the tirzepatide 5/5/10/10 
mg QW and 5/5/10/15-mg QW titration regimen, the delay in gastric emptying was reduced after the fourth 
dose at day 23. (For details see above, PK) 
Body Weight  
There was a consistent and dose related effect of tirzepatide on total body weight in healthy subjects and in 
patients with T2DM. In healthy subjects weight decreased after 4 weeks by a mean of -1.32, -1.75, -5.09, and 
-4.61 kg, respectively (with 0.5 mg QW, 1.5 mg QW, 4.5 mg QW, and 5/5/8/10 mg QW titration, GPGA, part 
B). In patients with T2DM weight decreased by -0.38, -1.21, -2.62, and -2.07 kg for 0.5 mg QW, 5 mg QW, 
5/5/10/10-mg, and 5/5/10/15-mg QW titration after 4 weeks (GPGA, part C). In Japanese patients with T2DM 
the placebo corrected decrease was -5.04, -6.59, and -3.39 kg (2.5/5/10 mg QW, 5/10/15 mg QW, 5-mg QW) 
after 8 weeks (GPGC). At Week 28, there was a statistically significant mean body weight loss from baseline in 
patients with T2DM treated with tirzepatide 15 mg QW when compared with placebo (-11.2 kg). The effect was 
larger compared to semaglutide 1 mg QW (-4.3 kg). 
Body composition 
Fat  mass  decreased  by  a  mean  of  -9.6  kg  (95%  CI  [-12.4,  -6.9],  p-value<0.001)  in  patients  treated  with 
tirzepatide 15 mg QW over 28 weeks. Fat-free mass decreased to a lesser degree by a mean of -1.5 kg. The 
percentage of fat mass in total body mass decreased by about 7%.

Food consumption 
In Japanese patients with T2DM (GPGC) tirzepatide reduced meal intake in a dose dependent fashion by day 
51. Compared to baseline (100% complete meal consumption at lunch and dinner) only 26.7 and 13.3 percent 
of the patients at a maximal target dose of 15 mg tirzepatide (5/10/15 mg QW increments) consumed 100%, 
compared with placebo values of 77.8 and 66.7%. 
In patients with T2DM (GPHT) placebo corrected intake of kcals of a mixed meal decreased by week 28 by -
309.8  kcal  with  tirzepatide  (15  mg  QW,  baseline  mean  consumption  Placebo:  1253  kcal,  tirzepatide:  1105 
kcal). In the Japanese study VAS trends towards a decrease in hunger and fullness scores and no effect on 
satiety and prospective food consumption scores and over all appetite scores were noted. In study GPHT at 
fasting and 240 min post-prandial, a significant reduction in appetite VAS score was observed with tirzepatide, 
at other time points there was a numerical reduction. Results for calorie intake and VAS scores were similar 
with semaglutide with the exception that VAS scores were significantly reduced at all pre- and post-prandial 
time points. 
Lipids  
There were no marked effects of tirzepatide on HDL- or LDL cholesterol in healthy subjects (GPGA part A and 
b) and patients with T2DM (GPGA part C) at day 29 and in Japanese patients with T2DM at day 51(GPGC). A 
downward  trend  in  triglyceride  concentrations  at  Day  29  was  noted  following  a  4-week  titration  of  both 
5/5/10/10- and 5/5/10/15 mg cohorts (GPGA part C). Numerically, triglyceride levels decreased in Japanese 
patients from mean predose values (5/10/15 mg QW): 1.958 to 1.376 mmol/L at day 51. 
Bone markers 
In patients with T2DM (GPGY Part C) trends to a decrease in N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP, 
a  marker  of  bone  formation)  concentration  from  Day  29  compared  to  Day  1  –  pre-dose  across  all  doses  of 
study drug and a trend to small increases of arithmetic mean CTX levels (a marker of bone turnover)  at Day 
29 as compared to Day 1 – pre-dose for study drug at dose 5 mg and 5/5/10/10 and 5/5/10/15 mg QW titrated 
doses was observed.  
PD interactions:  
A discussion on PD interactions with other drugs has not been provided by the Applicant. PD interactions are 
conceivable with drugs targeting the same PD endpoints relevant for effects on glucose homeostasis, systolic 
blood  pressure  or  heart  rate.  PD  interactions  with  insulin  or  insulin  secretagogues  may  increase  the  risk  of 
hypoglycaemia in case of coadministration. There was a small and insignificant increase in PR interval which 
per se will not be clinically relevant in most patients but may have an impact when tirzepatide is coadministered 
with  other  PR  prolonging  drugs.  Coadministration  with  drugs  affecting  gastric  emptying  may  mutually 
potentiate the effect.  
Heart rate 
A PopPK-PD analysis based on phase 3 studies indicated exposure related mean increases in heart rate by 5.6 
to 7.4 bpm at Css for 15 mg and a 7.0 to 9.2 bpm increase at the model-predicted tirzepatide Cmax for 15 mg. 
Blood pressure 
A  decrease  of  -8.3  and  -8.4  mmHg  change  from  baseline  systolic  blood  pressure  at  Weeks  40  and  52, 
respectively was estimated for the model-predicted tirzepatide Css for 15 mg, trends for diastolic blood pressure 
were not statistically significant.

ECG parameter 
QTc: PopPK based analyses on phase 1 and phase 2 studies combined indicated a ddQTcF (placebo corrected) 
of -0.570 (-1.52; 0.352 ms) based on studies GPGA, GPGB, and GPGF. In the phase 1 and 2 studies the highest 
dose  investigated  was  15  mg,  which  matches  the  maximally  proposed  dose  of  tirzepatide  of  15  mg  once-
weekly.  
PR-Intervall: Minor numerical but overall not significant increases in PR interval by a mean of 1.55 ms (0.594; 
2.36) were estimated based on the PopPK-PD analyses. 
Immunogenicity 
ADA antibodies: ADA titers peaked at Week 40 and showed a plateau up to Week 52. No effect of ADAs on PK 
of tirzepatide or PD as assessed by HbA1c was observed. The detection of ADAs did not appear to be related 
to tirzepatide concentrations. 
Safety parameter of interest 
Nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea  (N/V/D):  In  the  PopPK-PD  analysis  Covariate  effects  related  to  patient’s  race, 
ethnicity,  and  gender  were  identified.  In  the  model  none  of  these  significant  covariates  resulted  in  clinically 
meaningful differences in N/V/D incidence to warrant an alternate dosing scheme. 
Amylase,  lipase,  calcitonin:  Analyses  of  amylase  (absolute  and  change  from  baseline)  versus  observed 
tirzepatide concentrations showed a statistically significant positive slope. Similarly, a statistically significant 
positive  slope  was  also  observed  for  the  regression  analysis  of  lipase  (absolute  and  change  from  baseline) 
versus  observed  tirzepatide  concentrations  (Weeks  40  and  52).  Results  for  calcitonin  (absolute)  versus 
observed  tirzepatide  concentrations  showed  negative  slopes  that  did  not  reach  statistical  significance,  while 
calcitonin  (change  from  baseline)  versus  concentration  analyses  resulted  in  positive  slopes  that  attained 
significance only at Week 40 
Post hoc PK parameters for individuals with ≥3x upper limit of normal amylase, lipase, or calcitonin did not 
indicate relevant differences in model predicted Css when comparing patients with values > 3x ULN vs. those 
< 3xULN at the respective dose level. 
Hypoglycaemia: PK parameters in patients with Level 2 or 3 hypoglycaemia were comparable to those without 
hypoglycaemia. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Tirzepatide (also known as LY3298176) is a dual-action incretin mimetic that was designed as a 39 amino 
acid synthetic peptide that exerts its function by binding either the GIP or GLP-1 receptor with high affinity. 
The structure was engineered from the GIP sequence and includes a C20 fatty diacid moiety. The molecular 
weight is 4.8 kDa.  
The clinical pharmacology of tirzepatide was evaluated in 7 clinical pharmacology studies, 3 biopharmaceutic 
studies, two Phase 2 studies, five Phase 3 studies, and two regional (Japan) Phase 3 studies.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Tirzepatide  doses  of  0.25  to  15  mg  were  administered  over  the  course  of  these  studies.  Single  doses  of 
tirzepatide  over  a  range  of  0.25  to  8  mg  were  evaluated.  A  dose  of  tirzepatide  5  mg  was  identified  as  the 
maximum tolerated dose when given as a single dose in healthy participants, and hence doses greater than 5

mg were attained by stepwise dose-escalation schemes in subsequent multiple dose evaluations. Once-weekly 
multiple doses over a range of 0.5 to 15 mg were studied. 
Tirzepatide should be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. 
Tirzepatide  has  a  mean  half-life  of  approximately  5  days,  which  enables  once-weekly  dosing.  Tirzepatide 
distributes primarily in the blood volume and is highly bound to albumin in human plasma with a mean percent 
bound of 99 %. 
Tirzepatide  was  eliminated  through  general  physiologic  metabolic  pathways.  The  primary  pathways  that 
contributed to the clearance of tirzepatide were proteolytic cleavages of the peptide backbone, β-oxidation of 
the C20 fatty diacid moiety and amide hydrolysis. 
According  to  these  mechanisms  tirzepatide  PK  did  not  depend  on  specific  pathways  and,  except  weight,  no 
major  differences  of  pharmacokinetics  in  special  populations  should  be  expected.  This  was  confirmed  by 
dedicated  studies  (e.g.  GPGG  -  Impaired  renal  function  or  GPGQ  -  Impaired  hepatic  function)  or  by 
subpopulation  analyses,  partly  pooled  or  extended  by  POP-PK  analyses.  A  weakness  in  the  dedicated  renal 
impairment  and  hepatic  impairment  studies  was  that  unbound  concentrations  were  not  measured,  although 
this is recommended for drugs that are highly protein-bound according to the respective guidelines. However, 
as no effects were seen on total concentrations and as no relevant effects on PK are expected, no concern is 
raised. Similarly, except consequences of delayed gastric emptying, potential drug-drug interactions mediated 
by tirzepatide are considered limited.  
Apart  from  two  clinical  studies  on  drug-drug  interactions,  one  assessing  tirzepatide’s  effect  on  the  PK  of 
paracetamol (acetaminophen; study GPGA) and one assessing tirzepatide’s effect on the PK of a combination 
oral  contraceptive  (study  GPGR),  the  claims  regarding  no  clinically  meaningful  impact  on,  and  no  dose 
adjustments (or monitoring) of, concomitantly administered oral medicinal products, rely solely on simulations 
from physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. Although the models are the same as previously 
developed and/or applied to assess drug-drug interactions caused by the GLP-1 receptor agonist dulaglutide, 
the current application of the models to assess tirzepatide’s effect (through delayed gastric emptying) on the 
PK  of  concomitantly  administered  oral  medicinal  products  is  not  supported.  The  models  are  not  able  to 
adequately capture the data following co-administration of tirzepatide in studies GPGA and GPGR, indicating 
that tirzepatide’s effect on gastric emptying is not estimated correctly in the semi-mechanistic model analysis 
of  delayed  gastric  emptying,  or  there  are  more  aspects  to  drug-drug  interactions  with  tirzepatide  than  the 
models do account for.  
Thus, in Section 4.5 PBPK simulation is not included. Instead, available in vivo data regarding the effects on 
paracetamol and oral contraceptives, and the conclusions possible to be drawn from these studies are given, 
along with a general wording regarding possible effects on tmax, which may be relevant for substances where 
early  onset  of  effect  is  critical,  the  dose-dependence  of  the  effect  on  gastric  emptying  and  that  the  largest 
effects on gastric emptying are observed at initiation of treatment.  
In  study  GPGR,  investigating  the  effect  of  tirzepatide  on  oral  contraceptives,  AUC0-t  of  ethinylestradiol  and 
norgestimate was reduced by 20 and 16% respectively, AUC0-Ƭ by 21 and 23% respectively and Cmax by 59 and 
55% respectively. For dulaglutide and other pure GLP-1 receptor agonists, effects on Cmax but not on AUC of 
oral contraceptives have been observed. The the exact mechanism of this difference cannot be explained, but 
the effect on AUC is considered of not being of clinical relevance, especially since the starting dose in T2DM 
patients of 2.5 mg is expected to lead to a smaller GE delay than the 5 mg single dose used in the DDI study 
with oral contraceptives and since the GED effect has been shown to decrease on repeated dosing.

Pharmacodynamic effects 
Characterization of primary and secondary pharmacodynamics effects was appropriately conducted. Tirzepatide 
decreased fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations and HBA1C dose dependently in patients with T2DM. 
Clinically relevant effects were observed in a dose range between 5 mg QW and 15 mg QW. First and second 
phase insulin secretion increased, beta cell function and sensitivity of beta cells to glucose improved. The results 
were inconsistent with regards to whole body insulin resistance. Mean HOMA-IR increased slightly from 2.0 to 
2.5  in  patients  with  T2DM,  indicating  lack  of  a  beneficial  effect  or  even  an  increase  in  insulin  resistance. 
However, data were inconclusive since also in the placebo group HOMA-IR values increased from 1.8 – 2.2. On 
the other hand, in the Hyperinsulinemic Euglycaemic Clamp study in patients with T2DM tirzepatide increased 
the M-value indicating an increased whole body insulin sensitivity. The effect was significantly larger than the 
effect of semaglutide 1 mg QW. Taken together, the data are more in line with the assumption that tirzepatide 
increases whole body insulin sensitivity. 
Overall,  the  effects  as  observed  at  a  tirzepatide  dose  level  of  15  mg  QW  were  qualitatively  similar  but 
statistically significantly or numerically larger than those observed with the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide 1 mg 
QW. This raises the question, whether the additional efficacy is related to an additional effect at GIP receptors 
or whether tirzepatide is mainly a GLP-1 agonist with a higher potency or higher efficacy at the dose level of 
15 mg QW as compared to semaglutide 1 mg QW. Higher doses of semaglutide (2.4 mg QW) were administered 
for weight reduction in patients with overweight (Wilding et al., N Engl J Med 2021; 384:989-100) and it is 
conceivable that 1 mg is not the maximally effective dose. Opposite effects on glucagon release are expected 
for GIP and GLP-1 agonists. GLP1-1 receptor agonists are expected to decrease glucagon levels at high blood 
glucose  concentrations,  whereas  GIP  agonists  increase  glucagon  levels  at  low  glucose  concentrations 
counterbalancing the risk for hypoglycaemias. With a dual agonist, glucagon excretion should be higher at low 
blood glucose concentrations than with a pure GLP-1 agonist. However, this was not the case in the clinical 
program.  In  the  sMMTT,  fasting  glucagon  secretion  and  post  prandial  incremental  glucagon  0  –  240  min 
secretion were lower with tirzepatide than with semaglutide. Mathiesen DS et al., Int J Mol Sci. 2019; 20: 4092 
described differences in the GIP mediated regulation of the insulinotropic and glucagonotropic effect in healthy 
subjects  and  patients  with  T2DM  and  indicated  that  the  effect  on  fasting  glucagon  levels  remain  to  be 
characterized. The relevance of the GIP-R agonism of tirzepatide in patients with T2DM is therefore unclear. 
The applicant explained that patients in the sMMTT study were not hypoglycaemic and no increase in glucagon 
levels with tirzepatide were expected. There is an ongoing phase 1 study that more specifically investigates 
tirzepatide action on α-cell function under the conditions of induced hypoglycaemia. The results may provide 
a better insight into the mechanism of action. 
The weight reduction observed with tirzepatide 15 mg QW was to a large degree due to a reduction in body fat 
mass and to a lesser degree to non-fat mass, indicating that the reduction is associated with a beneficial effect 
on whole body composition. The effect was larger than effects obtained with semaglutide 1 mg QW but in a 
cross study comparison similar effects on body weight and body composition were observed with a higher dose 
of semaglutide (2.4 mg QW, Wilding et al., N Engl J Med 2021; 384:989-100) indicating that GLP-1 agonistic 
effects alone may explain the results. 
The Applicant provided extensive exposure-response modelling for several efficacy parameters (fasting plasma 
glucose, HbA1c, and body weight). It is believed that the models have provided valuable insights throughout 
the clinical development, but their role is insignificant at this stage, when there are clinical data available on 
both efficacy and safety from 5 global and 2 Japanese Phase 3 studies. It should be pointed out though, that 
the model for tirzepatide’s effect on body weight is flawed since it is modelling a confounded relationship. The 
exposure is highly dependent on body weight, and body weight is included as a time-varying covariate in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 67/212 
 
 
 
popPK model. Hence, individual exposures derived through the popPK model are not independent in relation to 
changes in body weight. The model should therefore be disregarded, and no predictions should be made based 
on this model. 
The observed cardiovascular actions are expected class effects of GLP-1 agonists. The decrease in systolic blood 
pressure may be beneficial in patients at an increased CV risk. In general, an increase in heart rate is associated 
with an increase in CV risk (prognostic marker). However, the therapeutic administration of GLP-1 agonists has 
not been associated with a negative impact on CV outcome (not a predictive marker). The increase in heart 
rate has been adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
The exposure response analyses provided for PR and QTc intervals do not raise concerns per se. PR prolongation 
is not mentioned in the SmPC. Since it cannot be excluded a priori that in patients with AV-block tirzepatide 
may  exaggerate  the  condition,  PR  prolongation  should  be  added  to  the  PD  actions  (5.1  “cardiovascular 
evaluation”). The exposure response analyses based on phase 1 and 2 trials cover doses up to 15 mg QW but 
not on supratherapeutic doses. Analyses including also phase 3 data sufficiently represent high exposures in 
clinical practice. Model predicted values with Cmax, ss in 70 and in 90 kg individuals were provided. The data 
do not indicate an increase in QTc in patients at lower weight. The results are in line with the requirements as 
laid down in ICH E14 Question and answer documents to serve as a substitute for a TQT study. The symmetrical 
higher rate of patients with increased and decreased QTc values are reasonably explained by statistical effects. 
Since also the assessment of CV safety in the phase 3 studies did not raise concerns there is no concern of a 
torsadogenic potential of tirzepatide. 
PD  interactions  are  conceivable  with  drugs  targeting  the  same  PD  endpoints  relevant  for  effects  on  glucose 
homeostasis, systolic blood pressure or heart rate. PD interactions with insulin or insulin secretagogues may 
increase  the  risk  of  hypoglycaemia  in  case  of  coadministration.  The  concern  of  an  increased  risk  of 
hypoglycaemia  when  used  with  insulin/SU  is  reflected  in  section  4.2,  4.4,  and  4.8,  but  not  in  4.5.  This  is 
consistent  with  other  approved  medicinal  products  and  is  acceptable.  Coadministration  with  drugs  affecting 
gastric emptying may mutually potentiate the effect. In the absence of data on the coadministration it can be 
accepted that the description of the effect on gastric emptying in section 5.1. is sufficient to bring the issue to 
the attention of prescribing physicians even in case of co-administration with other drugs with similar secondary 
PD effects. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the pharmacokinetic and PD characterisation is considered appropriate, taking the biochemical 
and physiological properties of tirzepatide into account. This holds true, considering the known properties of 
related drugs as e.g. dulaglutide or semaglutide.  
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics information is reflected properly in the SmPC.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
A tabulated overview of clinical studies contributing to the current application is provided in section 3.3. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The doses and the dose-escalation scheme used in the Phase 3 studies were selected based on assessment of 
safety, efficacy (glycaemic and weight loss benefit), and GI tolerability data from the Phase 2 studies GPGB

and GPGF and exposure-response modelling of data from patients with T2DM in the Phase 1 and 2 studies 
(for details on exposure-response modelling please refer to section pharmacodynamics of this report). 
Phase 2 Study GPGB 
Study GPGB was a 26-week study with the aim to explore the dose response relationship of tirzepatide (1, 5, 
10, and 15 mg) and collect efficacy and safety data in comparison with placebo and dulaglutide 1.5 mg. 
The escalation scheme for the investigational doses of tirzepatide was based on tolerability data from the 
Phase 1 Study GPGA. The figure below illustrates the study design including the dose-escalation scheme: 
Study design GPGB 
Study GPGB enrolled patients with T2DM with inadequate glycaemic control based on HbA1c values ranging 
from 7.0% to 10.5%. The table below presents key patient demographic characteristics at baseline. 
Approximately 90% of randomized patients were receiving a stable dose of metformin at baseline. 
Summary of results 
For brevity, baseline characteristics for study GBGB, which were balanced across treatment groups, are not 
given in this overview. 
The primary efficacy measure was HbA1c change from baseline to 26 weeks. The primary analyses were 
performed on the mITT population using a Bayesian dose-response model. All doses of tirzepatide reduced 
HbA1c from baseline to 26 weeks relative to placebo in a dose-dependent manner. Superiority to placebo was 
met for tirzepatide doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg with a superiority margin of -0.8%. These tirzepatide doses 
also demonstrated non-inferiority to dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Supportive analyses using the MMRM model 
demonstrated similar results. MMRM model results for Study GPGB are presented here to provide a

presentation format that is consistent with the Phase 3 studies. Key efficacy results are presented in the table 
below. 
Additionally, at 26 weeks for the mITT population on treatment without rescue dataset, compared to placebo, 
the tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg doses had significantly greater 
proportion of patients achieving HbA1c targets (<7.0% and ≤6.5%) 
• 
•  mean change in FBG, and  
•  mean change in body weight.  
Tirzepatide 10- and 15 mg doses also had significantly greater proportions of patients achieving the HbA1c 
target of <5.7%. The tirzepatide 10- and 15 mg doses also demonstrated significantly greater improvements 
in the above efficacy measures compared with dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Reductions in HbA1c and FBG for 
tirzepatide 5 mg were significantly greater than with dulaglutide 1.5 mg.

Phase 2 Study GPGF 
For brevity, baseline characteristics for study GBGF, which were balanced across treatment groups, are not 
given in this overview. 
Study GPGF was a 3-month study with the aim to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
subcutaneous once-weekly tirzepatide administered in three different dose-escalation schemes compared 
with placebo. Study GPGF aimed at determining which dose-escalation scheme would allow patients to reach 
the highest tirzepatide dose with the lowest incidence of GI AEs. The primary objective of the study was to 
demonstrate that at least one tirzepatide dose-escalation scheme was superior to placebo in HbA1c reduction 
at 12 weeks. The escalation schemes explored 
• 
• 
• 
lower starting dose in 2 groups in comparison to Study GPGB (2.5 mg instead of 5 mg)  
the effect of varying duration of the initial dose-escalation steps (2 weeks versus 4 weeks), and 
the magnitude of dose increase during the dose-escalation period (2.5, 4, 5, and 7.5 mg steps).  
The figure below illustrates the study design, including dose-escalation schemes. The dose escalation 
schemes in Study GPGF were chosen based on tolerability data from the Phase 1 Study GPGA and the highest 
dose and dose-escalation schemes evaluated study GPGB.

Safety results: Treatment emergent adverse events were reported by 77.6% (66 of 85 patients) in the 
tirzepatide treatment groups and 50% (13 of 26 patients) in the placebo group. Mild to moderate GI events 
were the most common TEAEs. The combined nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea AEs of each treatment group 
suggest that the first exposure to tirzepatide was generally more likely to result in AEs, but the incidence and 
prevalence may be reduced with lower initial doses. Smaller subsequent dose escalations to higher doses 
were also more likely to be associated with lower incidences of GI events. There were no reports of severe 
hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, or cholelithiasis. 
2.6.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Please note: for brevity and ease of reading, key methodological aspects for the five global phase 3 studies 
are summarised below.  
Five phase 3 studies were conducted designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-weekly treatment 
with injectable tirzepatide at maintenance doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg compared with placebo or active 
comparators in a broad population of patients with T2DM. Tirzepatide was assessed as monotherapy and as 
add-on treatment to OAMs or basal insulin.

Investigators and patients were blinded to the dose of tirzepatide administered in Study GPGL. 
The phase 3 studies included both double-blinded and open-label study designs. A double-blind design was 
possible for studies GPGK and GPGI because tirzepatide and the comparator (placebo) were provided in 
single-dose pens with the same appearance. Studies GPGL, GPGH, and GPGM were open-label with regard to 
the assignment of patients to either tirzepatide or the active comparator, due to differences in the devices, 
differences in the dose-escalation schemes for tirzepatide and semaglutide, and the dose-titration scheme for 
the insulin comparators, and the inability to obtain a placebo control for semaglutide. Only global Studies 
GPGH and GPGM were open-label with regard to tirzepatide doses, which enabled dose de-escalation in these 
studies. 
Methods 
•  Study Participants  
Patient population 
The patient population across the studies included adults with T2DM who varied with regard to their HbA1c 
requirements, the duration of disease, background therapy, co-morbidities, and complications. Key exclusion 
criteria included conditions related to special safety topics of pancreatitis, MTC, hepatic function, and diabetic 
retinopathy.  
HbA1c requirements for enrollment 
The HbA1c requirements for enrollment in the phase 3 studies varied. The lower limit of the inclusion 
criterion range was higher in Study GPGM than in the other global phase 3 studies (7.5% instead of 7.0%) to 
minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia, as some patients enrolled in this study were also taking a sulfonylurea. 
Additionally, the upper limit of the HbA1c inclusion criterion was lower in placebo-controlled Study GPGK 
(≤9.5%) than in the other global Phase 3 studies (≤10.5%).  
Rescue therapy 
Patients enrolled in the clinical trials were tightly monitored for blood glucose during their participation. 
Rescue therapy could be added to randomized study drug in all studies if patients met the criteria for severe 
persistent hyperglycaemia. GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4i, and pramlintide were not allowed as rescue 
Assessment report

therapy since the mechanism of action of these medications would confound assessment of the efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability of tirzepatide. For patients randomly assigned to the insulin treatment groups of 
Studies GPGM and GPGH, the prespecified criteria for initiation of rescue therapy were only applicable after 
weeks 12 and 16, respectively. During the initial 12 or 16 weeks, the first choice before initiating any rescue 
therapy with those patients was to increase the dose of basal insulin following the treat-to-target algorithm, 
which was not considered as rescue therapy. 
BMI requirements for enrolment 
The majority of the patients in the phase 3 studies had BMI in the obesity or overweight range. Patients were 
required to be of stable weight for at least 3 months prior to screening. Other than the lifestyle and dietary 
measures for diabetes treatment, patients were not allowed to initiate a new diet or exercise program with 
the intent of reducing body weight. The lower limit of the BMI inclusion criteria was lower in the two studies 
that enrolled patients in Japan compared with the other phase 3 studies: studies GPGL, GPGH, and GPGM 
required BMI ≥25 kg/m2 while studies GPGK and GPGI allowed BMI as low as 23 kg/m2 at screening. 
Renal function and CV risk 
The inclusion criteria were designed to accommodate country-specific eGFR thresholds for use of some 
background therapy (for example, metformin). In most phase 3 studies patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment were included (lower limit of eGFR 30 ml/min/1.73 m2), except for study GPGM which had no 
exclusion criterion based on eGFR.  
coronary heart disease 
peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin 
Study GPGM also included patients with increased risk of CV events, as defined by at least 1 of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
aged ≥50 years with a history of CKD and eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 
cerebrovascular disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin 
aged ≥50 years with congestive heart failure. 
•  Treatments 
Tirzepatide dosing regimen 
Dose-escalation scheme and duration of treatment in phase 3 studies 
The tirzepatide dose-escalation scheme (increments of 2.5 mg tirzepatide) used in the phase 3 studies is 
shown in the table below. Patients were treated with the target dose for at least 16 weeks. The 15 mg dose 
group had the longest dose-escalation period. Treatment durations of 40 weeks (Studies GPGK, GPGL, and 
GPGI), 52 weeks (Study GPGH), or 52 to 104 weeks (Study GPGM) were planned for the period following 
study drug initiation.

Dose de-escalation 
Tirzepatide dose de-escalation was allowed during the first 24 weeks of studies Studies GPGH and GPGM. The 
goal of dose de-escalation was to improve tolerability during study drug initiation and dose escalation for 
patients with persistent, intolerable GI symptoms and encourage patients to remain in the study on study 
drug. No dose de-escalation was allowed after week 24. Patients could de-escalate only once to a lower 
maintenance dose. Those patients who de-escalated remained on that lower maintenance dose throughout 
the remainder of the study. Patients on tirzepatide 5 mg could not de-escalate to a lower dose and had to 
discontinue from study drug. Dose de-escalation was used by 14.4% of patients in study GPGH and 15.1% of 
patients in study GPGM. 
Add-On Therapies and Active Comparators 
Add-on therapies 
Tirzepatide was investigated as monotherapy and as add-on therapy to other glucose-lowering medications, 
either alone or in combination. The combination therapies reflect the evaluation of tirzepatide throughout 
disease progression, ranging from metformin alone, to combination therapy with up to 3 commonly used oral 
medications (metformin ± sulfonylurea ± SGLT-2i), and  as add-on to a basal insulin. For the studies in which 
metformin was allowed, a stable dose (defined as 3 months prior to study entry) was required (≥1500 
mg/day). 
Active comparators 
Insulin degludec, an ultra-long-acting basal insulin, was chosen as the active comparator in study GPGH. 
Semaglutide 1 mg once-weekly was chosen as the active comparator in study GPGL. The 1 mg dose was the 
highest marketed dose of semaglutide for the treatment of T2DM available when Study GPGL was initiated.  
Both add-on therapy and active comparator 
Insulin glargine, a long-acting basal insulin, was chosen as add-on therapy for Study GPGI and as the active 
comparator in Study GPGM. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy endpoints in Phase 3 studies 
The primary endpoint for assessment of efficacy was change from baseline in HbA1c. Change from baseline in 
body weight was a key secondary endpoint (controlled for Type 1 error) in all studies. Additional clinical 
endpoints included, but were not limited to, proportions of patients reaching glycaemic and body weight loss 
targets, change from baseline in FSG, 7-point SMBG, waist circumference, change from baseline in lipid 
profile, and patient-reported outcomes. Two substudies of study GPGH provided data on CGM, change from

baseline in liver fat content, volume of visceral adipose tissue, and volume of abdominal subcutaneous 
adipose tissue. 
Patient reported outcome measures 
The following questionnaires were applied in the phase 3 studies: 
The IW-SP questionnaire contains three items that assessed how often the patients’ body weight affects how 
happy they are with their appearance and how often they feel self-conscious when out in public. Each item 
was rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 “always” to 5 “never.” Raw scores were derived by summing the 
item scores and dividing by the number of items. Scores were then linearly transformed to a range from 0 to 
100. Higher IW-SP raw scores and higher transformed scores correspond to better self-perception. 
The APPADL questionnaire contained seven items that assesses how difficult it was for patients to engage in 
certain activities considered to be integral to normal daily life, such as walking, standing, and climbing stairs. 
Items were scored on a 5-point numeric rating scale ranging from 1 “unable to do” to 5 “not at all difficult.” 
Raw scores were derived by summing the item scores and dividing by the number of items. Scores were then 
linearly transformed to a range from 0 to 100. Higher APPADL raw scores and higher transformed scores 
correspond to better self-reported ability to perform physical activities of daily living.  
An improvement in the EQ-5D-5L score indicates better overall health-related quality of life (categorises into 
five domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, anxiety/depression). 
The DTSQ questionnaire assesses patient satisfaction with diabetes treatment (e.g. How satisfied are you 
with your current treatment? Response options: very satisfied to very dissatisfied). 
The IWQOL-Lite-CT is a 20-item patient-reported outcomes instrument where the instrument assesses three 
domains of weight-related quality of life: Physical (7 items), Physical Function (comprising 5 of the 7 items 
included in the Physical domain), and Psychosocial (13 items). Items in the Physical Function composite 
describe physical limitations related to general and specific physical activities. 
•  Statistical methods 
Estimands and efficacy analyses 
All efficacy analyses were conducted using all randomly assigned patients who took at least 1 dose of study 
drug excluding patients who discontinued study drug due to inadvertent enrolment. 
Two estimands were specified for evaluating primary and key secondary efficacy objectives (subjected to 
type I error control). 
The “treatment-regimen” estimand represents the efficacy irrespective of adherence to study drug or 
initiation of rescue antihyperglycaemic therapy. Analyses aligned to the “treatment-regimen” estimand were 
conducted using all available data obtained up to the primary endpoint visit, regardless of adherence to study 
drug or initiation of rescue antihyperglycaemic medication. Analyses for mean change from baseline to the 
primary endpoint visit in HbA1c and other longitudinal continuous variables were conducted utilizing analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA). Analysis of the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c reduction targets at the 
primary endpoint visit was conducted using logistic regression. Analyses were conducted with multiple 
imputation for missing data at the primary endpoint visit. In Studies GPGL, GPGH, and GPGM imputation of 
missing data was based on “retrieved dropouts”, defined as patients with evaluable data at the primary 
Assessment report

endpoint visit in the same treatment arm who prematurely discontinued study drug. In Studies GPGK and 
GPGI, due to an insufficient number of “retrieved dropouts”, missing data were imputed using placebo data. 
The “efficacy” estimand represents the efficacy prior to discontinuation of study drug without confounding 
effects of rescue antihyperglycaemic therapy. Analyses aligned to the “efficacy” estimand were conducted 
using data obtained up to the primary endpoint visit excluding data after initiation of rescue 
antihyperglycaemic medication or permanent discontinuation of study drug (last dose date + 7 days). 
Analyses for mean change from baseline to the primary endpoint visit in HbA1c and other longitudinal 
continuous variables were conducted utilizing mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM). Analysis of the 
proportion of patients achieving HbA1c reduction targets at the primary endpoint visit was conducted using 
logistic regression. Missing data for HbA1c reduction targets at the primary endpoint visit were imputed using 
the predicted values from MMRM followed by dichotomizing per the cut-off value. 
Multiplicity adjustment 
No type 1 error rate adjustments were made for conducting analyses relative to “treatment-regimen” and 
“efficacy” estimands. For analyses within each estimand, graphical multiple testing procedures were used to 
control the family-wise type 1 error rate at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 for evaluating primary and key 
secondary objectives (subjected to type I error control).

Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg were superior to placebo on mean change from baseline in HbA1c at 40 weeks 
using both estimands (***p<0.001). Additionally, compared with placebo, all three doses of tirzepatide had 
significantly higher proportions of patients who achieved HbA1c target values of:  
•  <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol)  
•  ≤6.5% (≤48 mmol/mol), and  
•  <5.7% (<39 mmol/mol)

PRO measures (methods are summarized in section 2.6.5.2) 
Tirzepatide seemed to improve patient`s self-perception related to the psychological burden of overweight 
(IWSP) and overall health-related QoL (EQ VAS). No significant effects in favour of tirzepatide were seen on 
self-reported ability to perform physical activities of daily living (APPALD) and the UK EQ-5D-5L, measuring 
health related QoL.

GPGL Study (SURPASS-2) results: 
Primary endpoint: mean change from baseline in HbA1c 
At 40 weeks, tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg demonstrated statistically significant reductions in HbA1c from 
baseline to 40 weeks compared with semaglutide 1 mg. 
Additionally, for the efficacy estimand, compared to semaglutide 1 mg, all 3 doses of tirzepatide had 
significantly higher proportions of patients who achieved HbA1c target values of  
<7.0% (<53 mmol/mol)  
≤6.5% (≤48 mmol/mol), and  
<5.7% (<39 mmol/mol) 
Results (including those on the secondary endpoints responder analyses) are given in the following table for 
both estimands.

Mean change from baseline in HbA1c over time to 40 weeks 
Secondary endpoints 
All key secondary efficacy objectives were controlled for type 1 error. Fasting serum glucose: tirzepatide 5, 
10, and 15 mg showed statistically significant reductions in FSG from baseline to 40 weeks compared with 
semaglutide 1mg. 7-Point SMBG: tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced SMBG overall daily 
mean, pre-meal daily mean, and postmeal daily mean from baseline to 40 weeks compared with semaglutide 
1 mg.

Mean change from baseline in body weight over time to 40 weeks 
All three tirzepatide dose groups had significantly greater mean reductions from baseline in body weight 
compared with semaglutide beginning at Week 4. Weight reductions continued through 40 weeks for all 
treatment groups and did not appear to plateau. 
Lipid parameter results 
All treatment groups significantly reduced triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-C, 
and VLDL-C and increased HDL-C from baseline. Additionally, all 3 doses of tirzepatide had significant 
reductions in triglycerides and VLDL-C and significant increases in HDL-C at 40 weeks compared with

IWQOL-Lite-CT 
Study GPGL was the only study in the Phase 3 program that measured the IWQOL-Lite-CT. 
There was a greater improvement in physical impact experienced by patients due to their weight. There were 
also significant differences for tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg compared to semaglutide in IWQOL-Lite-CT total 
scores (meaning there was a greater improvement in overall health-related quality of life and functioning 
associated with weight) and physical scores (indicating there was a greater improvement in physical impact 
experienced by patients due to their weight). There was also a significant difference for tirzepatide 15 mg 
compared to semaglutide in psychosocial scores, meaning there was a greater improvement in the emotional 
and social impact experienced by patients due to their weight.

GPGH Study (SURPASS-3) results 
Primary endpoint: mean change from baseline in HbA1c 
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg demonstrated statistically significant reductions in HbA1c from baseline to 52 
weeks compared with insulin degludec. Additionally, compared to insulin degludec, all three doses of 
tirzepatide had significantly higher proportions of patients who achieved HbA1c target values of <7.0%, 
≤6.5%, and <5.7%.

doses were reached around 24 weeks and were maintained through 52 weeks. 
Secondary endpoints 
All key secondary efficacy objectives were controlled for type 1 error. 
Fasting serum glucose 
Significant mean changes from baseline in FSG at Week 52 were observed in all four treatment groups. 
Insulin degludec had a significantly larger mean reduction in FSG compared to tirzepatide 5 mg. Tirzepatide 
10 and 15 mg showed similar mean reductions to insulin degludec in FSG.  
Insulin degludec was titrated throughout the study to achieve an FSG <90 mg/dL (<5 mmol/L). At week 52, 
significantly higher proportions of patients in the insulin degludec group compared to all 3 tirzepatide groups 
achieved the FSG target of <90 mg/dL (<5 mmol/L): tirzepatide 5 mg: 6.9%, tirzepatide 10 mg: 14.6%, 
tirzepatide 15 mg: 16.3%, and insulin degludec: 25.7%. 
7-Point SMBG 
All doses of tirzepatide significantly reduced the SMBG overall daily mean and 2-hour postmeal daily mean 
assessed at 52 weeks compared with insulin degludec. Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg also significantly reduced 
the pre-meal daily mean compared to insulin degludec.

Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) substudy 
Percentage and Duration of Time in euglycaemic range of 71 to 140 mg/dL (3.9 to 7.8 mmol/L) 
A subset of patients in Study GPGH (N=243) participated in an evaluation of the 24-hour glucose profiles 
captured with blinded CGM. All three doses of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg) presented a significantly 
greater mean percentage of time with glucose in the euglycaemic range of 71 to 140 mg/dL (3.9 to 7.8 
mmol/L) within a 24-hour period at 52 weeks compared with insulin degludec. Thus, the duration of time in 
the euglycaemic range for tirzepatide increased by 167.39 to 353.93 minutes (approximately 3 to 6 hours) 
more than insulin degludec at 52 weeks. Once weekly tirzepatide 10 mg and 15 mg presented a significantly 
greater mean percentage of time with glucose in the euglycaemic range of 71 to 140 mg/dL (3.9 to 7.8 
mmol/L) within a 24-hour period at 24 weeks compared with insulin degludec. This was equivalent to an 
increase of 276.22 to 304.85 minutes (approximately 4 to 5 hours) in euglycaemic range for tirzepatide 10 
mg and 15 mg when compared to insulin degludec. Once weekly tirzepatide 5 mg achieved a numerically but

not significantly greater mean percentage of time within euglycaemic range at 24 weeks compared with 
insulin degludec, with a difference of 119.89 minutes (approximately 2 hours) longer spent in euglycaemic 
range of 71 to 140mg/dL (3.9 to 7.8 mmol/L). 
According to the international CGM consensus guidelines ADA (Battelino 2019), the goal for hypoglycaemia is 
to spend less than 4% of time <70mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L), for TIR 70-180mg/dL (3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L) to be 
70% of time, and for hyperglycaemia >180mg/dL (>10.0 mmol/L) to be less than 25% of time within a 24-
hour period. A numerically higher percentage of tirzepatide treated patients achieved all three of these goals 
in comparison to insulin degludec, as illustrated in the following figure: 
Actual values in percentage of time with sensor glucose within target ranges of 
≤70 mg/dL (≤3.9 mmol/L), 71 to 180 mg/dL (3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L), and >180 (>10.0 
mmol/L) during a 24-hour period at baseline and 52 weeks: CGM analysis set. 
Abbreviations: TZP = tirzepatide. 
Note: Actual values do not add up to 100% due to separate analysis models for each endpoint. 
Baseline percentage and duration of time with glucose in the hyperglycaemic range of >180 mg/dL (>10.0 
mmol/L), baseline percentage and duration of time with CGM glucose in the hypoglycaemic ranges of ≤70 
mg/dL and <54 mg/dL within a 24-hour period did not significantly differ across the treatment groups. 
Tirzepatide 10 mg and 15 mg presented a numerically but not significantly lower incidence of patients with at 
least 1 nocturnal episode of hypoglycaemia <70mg/dL (≤3.9 mmol/L) at both 24 and 52 weeks when 
compared with insulin degludec (number of events tirzepatide 5 mg 8, tirepatide 10 mg 9, tirzepatide 15 mg 
12, insulin 14). 
Baseline within day glucose SD variability during a 24-hour period did not significantly differ across the 
treatment groups. All 3 doses of tirzepatide achieved a significant decrease in within day glucose SD 
variability as measured by SD from baseline at both 24 weeks and 52 weeks compared to insulin degludec. 
Insulin degludec presented limited improvement from baseline in glycaemic variability as measured by SD at 
24 and 52 weeks.

Liver fat content (LFC) and adipose tissue, MRI substudy 
A subset of patients (N = 296) participated in an evaluation of LFC, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and 
abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT) assessed through magnetic resonance imaging. At 52 weeks, 
patients treated with tirzepatide (10 mg and 15 mg pooled) demonstrated statistically significantly greater 
mean reductions in LFC compared to insulin degludec, -8.09 % versus -3.38 % respectively, from baselines 
of 15.67 % and 16.58 %. Patients treated with tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg had significantly greater 
reductions in volume of VAT (-1.10, -1.53 and -1.65 L respectively) and ASAT (-1.40, -2.25 and -2.05 L 
respectively) from overall baselines of 6.6 L and 10.4 L respectively at 52 weeks compared with an increase 
in the insulin degludec group (0.38 and 0.63 L). 
Body Weight 
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg showed significant reductions in body weight from baseline to 52 weeks. 
Conversely, patients in the insulin degludec group showed an increase in mean body weight. Additionally, 
compared to insulin degludec, all three doses of tirzepatide had significantly higher proportions of patients 
who achieved body weight reductions of ≥5%, ≥10%, and ≥15%.

Mean change from baseline in body weight over time to 52 weeks 
All three tirzepatide dose groups had significant mean reductions from baseline in body weight starting at 
Week 4. Steady decreases in weight continued through 52 weeks and did not appear to plateau by the end of 
the treatment period. Conversely, the mean body weight in the insulin degludec group increased from 
baseline starting at Week 12.  
Lipid parameter results 
At 52 weeks, all tirzepatide groups significantly reduced triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and VLDL-C 
and increased HDL-C from baseline. Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg significantly reduced triglycerides and VLDL-C 
compared with insulin degludec. Additionally, all 3 doses of tirzepatide significantly increased HDL-C at 52

PRO results (questionnaires are briefly described in section 2.6.5.2 of this overview) 
IW-SP 
There was a significant difference in the total transformed IW-SP score for all three doses of tirzepatide 
compared with insulin degludec at 52 weeks, indicating better self-perception. 
APPADL 
All three doses of tirzepatide significantly improved the APPADL transformed scores from baseline to 52 
weeks compared with insulin degludec, indicating better self-reported ability to perform physical activities of 
daily living. 
DTSQs and DTSQc 
Each of the three tirzepatide groups had a significantly higher total DTSQc scores, indicating greater 
improvement in treatment satisfaction, compared with insulin degludec. The tirzepatide 15-mg group had a 
statistically significant lower perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia compared with the insulin degludec 
group. The tirzepatide 5-mg group had a statistically significant lower perceived frequency of hypoglycaemia 
compared with the insulin degludec group. 
EQ-5D-5L 
There were significant differences in the EQ VAS score for all 3 doses of tirzepatide compared with insulin 
degludec at 52 weeks, indicating better overall health-related quality of life. No significant differences were 
seen in the EQ-5D-5L Index scores for all 3 doses of tirzepatide compared to insulin degludec from baseline

Fasting serum glucose 
Tirzepatide 5 and 10 mg showed similar mean reductions in FSG compared with insulin glargine, while 
tirzepatide 15 mg had a significantly larger mean reduction compared with insulin glargine.  
7-Point SMBG 
All doses of tirzepatide significantly reduced the SMBG overall daily mean, premeal daily mean, and 2-hour 
postmeal daily mean assessed at 52 weeks compared with insulin glargine for the efficacy estimand. At 52 
weeks, all daily mean SMBG values were <140 mg/dL across all 3 tirzepatide groups, while only the premeal 
daily mean SMBG value was <140 mg/dL in the insulin glargine group.

lower perceived frequency of hypoglycaemia compared with the insulin glargine group. 
IW-SP 
There were significant differences in the total transformed IW-SP scores for all three doses of tirzepatide 
compared with insulin glargine at 52 weeks, indicating better weight-related self-perception. 
APPADL 
All 3 doses of tirzepatide significantly improved the APPADL transformed scores from baseline to 52 weeks 
compared with insulin glargine, indicating better self-reported ability to perform physical activities of daily 
living.

Mean change from baseline in HbA1c over time to 40 weeks 
All 3 doses of tirzepatide achieved mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c at all time points assessed. 
Because, per protocol, the insulin glargine dose could not be modified during the first 4 weeks, no meaningful 
response from the placebo group was expected before this time point. However, at Week 8 and all

around 24 weeks and were maintained through 40 weeks. 
Secondary endpoints 
All key secondary efficacy objectives were controlled for type 1 error. 
Fasting serum glucose 
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg showed statistically significant mean reductions in FSG from baseline to 40 
weeks compared with placebo.  
Insulin glargine was titrated throughout the study to achieve an FSG <100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L).  At Week 
40, significantly higher proportions of patients in all tirzepatide dose groups compared to placebo achieved 
the FSG target of <100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
tirzepatide 5 mg: 54.8% 
tirzepatide 10 mg: 61.1% 
tirzepatide 15 mg: 64.1%, and 
placebo: 29.1%. 
7-Point SMBG 
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced SMBG overall daily mean, premeal daily mean, and 
postmeal daily mean from baseline to 40 weeks compared with placebo.  
Additionally, compared to placebo, all 3 doses of tirzepatide significantly reduced mean SMBG levels for all 7 
time points. Treatment with all 3 doses of tirzepatide enabled patients to have lower mean blood glucose 
values throughout the day compared with the patients who received placebo.

Mean change from baseline in body weight over time to 40 weeks 
All three tirzepatide dose groups had significantly greater mean reductions from baseline in body weight 
compared with placebo beginning with Week 4. For the tirzepatide groups, the curves for 10 and 15 mg 
diverged from 5 mg at Week 16, and the 15-mg curve diverged from 10 mg at Week 20, and thereafter. 
Mean weight reductions continued through 40 weeks and did not appear to plateau.

Lipid parameter results 
At 40 weeks, all tirzepatide groups significantly reduced triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and VLDL-C 
from baseline. No significant differences were observed for HDL-C for any of the treatment groups compared 
to baseline. 
Additionally, all three doses of tirzepatide significantly reduced triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and

doses compared with placebo at 40 weeks, indicating better self-perception. 
APPADL 
The 10 and 15 mg tirzepatide doses significantly improved the APPADL transformed scores from baseline to 
40 weeks compared with placebo, indicating better self-reported ability to perform physical activities of daily 
living. 
DTSQs and DTSQc 
Each of the 3 tirzepatide groups had a significantly higher total DTSQc score, indicating greater improvement 
in treatment satisfaction compared with placebo. Each of the 3 tirzepatide groups had a statistically 
significant lower perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia compared with the placebo group. No significant 
differences were seen for the perceived frequency of hypoglycaemia scores between each of the 3 tirzepatide 
groups, indicating similar self-perceived problems with hypoglycaemia compared with the placebo group. 
EQ-5D-5L 
There was significant difference in the EQ VAS score for the tirzepatide 10 mg group compared with placebo 
at 40 weeks, indicating better overall health-related quality of life. There were significant differences in the 
EQ-5D Index scores for the tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg groups compared with placebo at 40 weeks, indicating 
better overall health-related quality of life.

2.6.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
Renal impairment 
In most phase 3 studies patients with mild to moderate renal impairment were included (lower limit of eGFR 
30 ml/min/1.73 m2), except for study GPGM which had no exclusion criterion based on eGFR. It is stated in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC that “no dose adjustment is needed based on… renal impairment including ESRD”. 
With the Response it had been clarified that very few (n=16) patients with eGFR <30 mL/minute/1.73 m2 
were treated with tirzepatide. By-participant data showed that efficacy seemed not to be lower in this subset 
compared to the overall study population, both with regard to HbA1c and weight. No unexpected safety 
issues occurred in these patients and no deterioration in renal function (eGFR) was noted. Hence, the 
available data do not justify a dose adjustment in patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Instead, a revised wording indicating limited experience in patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD 
in section 4.2 of the SmPC has been added to section 4.2.

Hepatic impairment 
Patients with hepatic impairment were excluded from the phase 3 studies. A clinical pharmacology study 
(Study GPGQ) was conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. No clinically relevant effects of hepatic 
impairment were observed on the PK of tirzepatide in this study. The applicant concluded that patients with 
hepatic impairment do not require different dosing regimens (and inserted a respective wording in section 4.2 
of the SmPC).  This was further justified in the Response by hinting at study results which suggest 
improvement of liver-related clinical markers (e. g. liver fat content). The lack of data on patients has been 
reflected with the addition of a sentence in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Paediatric population 
Tirzepatide has not been studied in children below the age of 18 years. A PIP for tirzepatide (EMEA-C1-
002360-PIP01-18) reached a decision (P/0311/2019) on 10 Sep 2019 for the treatment of T2D in paediatrics 
from 10 to less than 18 years of age and a clinical study in T2DM paediatrics from 10 to less than 18 years of 
age is currently being initiated by the applicant. 
Elderly 
At baseline, 
•  2082 patients (33.2%) were aged ≥65 years, with 1314 of those patients treated with tirzepatide  
•  317 patients (5.1%) were aged ≥75 years, with 179 of those patients treated with tirzepatide, and 
•  13 patients (0.2%)were aged ≥85 years with 6 of those patients treated with tirzepatide

Change from baseline in FSG 
In Studies GPGK and GPGI, all three doses of tirzepatide reduced FSG significantly more than placebo. 
Similarly, in Study GPGL, all three doses of tirzepatide reduced FSG significantly more than semaglutide. In 
Study GPGH, insulin degludec was titrated to an FBG <90 mg/dL. In Study GPGH, there were no significant 
differences observed in reductions in FSG between insulin degludec and tirzepatide 10- and 15 mg groups, 
while there was a significantly larger reduction in insulin degludec compared with tirzepatide 5 mg. In Study 
GPGM, insulin glargine was titrated to an FBG <100 mg/dL. In Study GPGM, tirzepatide 5 and 10 mg showed 
similar reductions in FSG compared with insulin glargine, while tirzepatide 15 mg had a significantly larger 
reduction compared with insulin glargine. 
For the treatment-regimen estimand, the mean changes in FSG from baseline to primary endpoint ranged 
from 
-tirzepatide 5 mg: -39.6 mg/dL (-2.2 mmol/L) [Study GPGK, 40 weeks] to -58.2 mg/dL 
(-3.2 mmol/L) [Study GPGI, 52 weeks], 
-tirzepatide 10 mg: -39.8 mg/dL (-2.2 mmol/L) [Study GPGK, 40 weeks] to -64.0 mg/dL (-3.6 mmol/L) 
[Study GPGI, 40 weeks], and 
-tirzepatide 15 mg: -38.6 mg/dL (-2.1 mmol/L) [Study GPGK, 40 weeks] to -62.6 mg/dL (-3.5 mmol/L)

7-point SMBG 
In all phase 3 studies, treatment with all three doses of tirzepatide demonstrated significant reductions from 
baseline in SMBG overall daily mean, premeal daily mean, and 2-hour postmeal daily mean at the primary 
endpoint. At the primary endpoint for all global Phase 3 studies, all daily mean SMBG values were <140 
mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) across all 3 tirzepatide groups. 
Additional details regarding 7-point SMBG, including change in SMBG levels from baseline at 52 weeks for all 
7 time points and daily 2-hour postmeal SMBG excursions, are not described in this Overview.

Body Weight 
At the primary endpoint of each phase 3 study, tirzepatide significantly reduced body weight compared to 
placebo and all active comparators studied. For the treatment-regimen estimand, the mean changes in body 
weight from baseline to primary endpoint ranged from 
-tirzepatide 5 mg: -5.4 kg (Study GPGI, 40 weeks) to -7.6 kg (Study GPGL, 40 weeks) 
-tirzepatide 10 mg: -7.0 kg (Study GPGK, 40 weeks) to -9.6 kg (Study GPGH, 52 weeks), and 
-tirzepatide 15 mg: -7.8 kg (Study GPGK, 40 weeks) to -11.3 kg (Study GPGH, 52 weeks). 
Steady decreases in weight were seen at the first time point assessed, continued through the end of the 
study, and did not appear to plateau by the end of the treatment period, for both the 40- and 52-week 
studies.

Lipid Parameters 
For brevity, results for VLDL-C and total cholesterol are not provided in this section; these are given in the 
description of the individual studies. 
Triglycerides: in all 5 global phase 3 studies, at the primary endpoint, all doses of tirzepatide demonstrated 
significantly larger decreases in triglycerides compared to placebo (Studies GPGK and GPGI), semaglutide 1 
mg (Study GPGL), and insulin glargine (Study GPGM). Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg demonstrated significantly 
larger decreases in triglycerides compared to insulin degludec (Study GPGI). 
For the efficacy estimand, the mean percent changes in triglycerides from baseline to primary endpoint 
ranged from 
-tirzepatide 5 mg: -15.2% (-22.0 mg/dL; -0.2 mmol/L) [Study GPGI, 40 weeks] to -19.0% (-31.4 mg/dL; -
0.35 mmol/L) [Study GPGL, 40 weeks] 
-tirzepatide 10 mg: -18.2% (-27.6 mg/dL; -0.31 mmol/L) [Study GPGK, 40 weeks] to 
-26.7% (-43.6 mg/dL; -0.49 mmol/L) [Study GPGH, 52 weeks], and

-tirzepatide 15 mg: -21.0% (-31.8 mg/dL; -0.36 mmol/L) [Study GPGK, 40 weeks] to 
-25.2% (-41.2 mg/dL; -0.46 mmol/L) [Study GPGH, 52 weeks]. 
Total cholesterol: greater reductions from baseline in total cholesterol levels were observed for all 3 doses 
of tirzepatide compared with placebo and insulin glargine. The magnitudes of the reductions were not 
statistically different when the tirzepatide doses were compared with semaglutide or insulin degludec. The 
percent changes from baseline at the primary endpoint were: 
-Study GPGK: tirzepatide, -5.5% to -8.4%; placebo, -0.8% 
-Study GPGL: tirzepatide, -5.5% to -6.3%; semaglutide, -4.8% 
-Study GPGH: tirzepatide, -4.3% to -5.8%; insulin degludec, -2.9% 
-Study GPGM: tirzepatide, -5.0% to -5.6%; insulin glargine, 0% 
-Study GPGI: tirzepatide, -8.8% to -12.9%; placebo, -0.4% 
LDL-C: greater reductions from baseline in LDL-C levels were observed for tirzepatide 15 mg compared with 
placebo in Study GPGK, whereas all 3 doses of tirzepatide significantly reduced LDL-C compared with placebo 
in Study GPGI. In Study GPGM, all 3 doses of tirzepatide significantly reduced LDL-C compared with insulin 
glargine. The magnitudes of the reductions were not statistically significant when the tirzepatide doses were 
compared with semaglutide or insulin degludec. The percent changes from baseline at the primary endpoint 
were: 
-Study GPGK: tirzepatide, -6.7% to -12.4%; placebo, -1.6% 
-Study GPGL: tirzepatide, -5.2% to -7.7%; semaglutide, -6.4% 
-Study GPGH: tirzepatide, -5.7% to -6.6%; insulin degludec, -2.7% 
-Study GPGM: tirzepatide, -6.7% to -8.4%; insulin glargine, 1.3% 
-Study GPGI: tirzepatide, -8.9% to -15.5%; placebo, 2.8% 
HDL-C: greater increases from baseline in HDL-C levels were observed for all 3 doses of tirzepatide 
compared with placebo (Study GPGK), semaglutide, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine. In Study GPGI, no 
statistically significant differences were observed between the tirzepatide and placebo groups in this 
population of patients on a background of insulin glargine. The percent changes from baseline at the primary 
endpoint were: 
-Study GPGK: tirzepatide, 3.2% to 7.5%; placebo, -3.8% 
-Study GPGL: tirzepatide, 6.8% to 7.9%; semaglutide, 4.4% 
-Study GPGH: tirzepatide, 5.5% to 10.2%; insulin degludec, 1.0% 
-Study GPGM: tirzepatide, 6.8% to 10.9%; insulin glargine, 2.9% 
-Study GPGI: tirzepatide, 0.9% to 2.1%; placebo, 1.7%.

Phase 2 Study GPGB 
The two Japanese phase 3 studies (GPGO and GPGP) were 52-week, multicenter studies to meet local 
registration requirements. Study GPGO was a double-blind study designed to assess the safety and efficacy 
of tirzepatide compared with dulaglutide 0.75 mg in patients with T2DM who discontinued OAM monotherapy 
or were OAM-naïve. Dulaglutide 0.75 mg is the only dulaglutide dose currently registered in Japan and was 
the active comparator chosen since it is marketed in Japan as monotherapy in patients with T2DM. Study 
GPGP was an open-label study without comparator, designed to assess safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in 
combination with monotherapy of OAMs. These two regional studies used the tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg 
maintenance doses and the same tirzepatide dose-escalation scheme as was used in the phase 3 studies.  
Methodology and key results of study GPGO are summarised in the following table (for brevity, results of the 
uncontrolled safety and tolerability study GPGP are not provided; efficacy endpoints in this study showed no

Design and conduct of clinical studies

The efficacy of tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with T2DM is supported by two phase 2 studies (GPGB 
and GPGF), five global phase 3 studies (GPGK, GPGL, GPGH, GPGM, and GPGI) and two phase 3 studies 
conducted in Japan (GPGO and GPGP); the latter are considered as supportive in the EU context. 
The two phase 2 studies (GPGB and GPGF) were double-blind studies investigating efficacy and safety of 
tirzepatide at doses between 1 and 15 mg to enable dose selection and optimization of the dose-escalation 
scheme. Patients had T2DM and inadequate glycaemic control on diet and exercise with or without a stable 
dose of metformin. Study GPGB was a 26-week study that explored the dose response relationship of 
tirzepatide (1, 5, 10, and 15 mg) compared to placebo and dulaglutide 1.5 mg (meanwhile higher dulaglutide 
doses of 3 and 4.5 mg are licensed; results have to be viewed in the light of the rather low dose of 
dulaglutide). Study GPGF was a 12-week study which evaluated three different dose-escalation schemes; the 
schemes differed with regard to starting dose, duration of escalation steps and magnitude of dose increase 
compared with placebo. Study GPGF provided key data for determining which dose-escalation scheme 
allowed patients to reach the highest tirzepatide dose with the lowest incidence of GI AEs. 
The five phase 3 studies were designed to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg 
once-weekly. Within Study GPGH, two substudies were performed, to investigate the 24-hour glucose profile 
captured with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM, n=234) and to characterize potential changes in hepatic 
fat content through magnetic resonance imaging. The clinical studies utilized double-blinded (GPGK, GPGI) or 
open-label designs; open-label performance was unavoidable in studies GPGL, GPGH, GPGM due to 
differences in devices and application schemes for tirzepatide and its active comparators semaglutide, insulin 
degludec and insulin glargine. 
Doses and dose-escalation scheme and possibility to de-escalate 
Treatment durations of 40 weeks (Studies GPGK, GPGL, and GPGI), 52 weeks (Study GPGH), or 52 to 104 
weeks (Study GPGM) allowed for tirzepatide dose initiation at a dose of 2.5 mg and escalation in steps of 2.5 
mg every 4 weeks, followed by at least 16 weeks at steady state for all treatment groups, including 
tirzepatide 15 mg, which had the longest dose-escalation period. The duration of treatment at steady state is 
considered appropriate to assess the glycaemic efficacy of tirzepatide. In the open-label studies GPGH amd 
GPGM patients had the possibility to de-escalate the dose during the first 24 weeks; in the other studies no 
dose-de-escalation was allowed. 
Background therapies and active comparators 
Background therapies ranged from diet and exercise alone (study GPGK), metformin (GPGL), 1 to 3 OAMs 
(GPGH, GPGM) and basal insulin with or without metformin (GPGI). 
The active comparators chosen for studies GPGL (semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg) and GPGH (insulin 
degludec) and GPGM (insulin glargine) are acceptable. Semaglutide had shown superior improvement in 
glycaemic control relative to other GLP-1 agonists (e.g. Ahmann et al, 2018; comparison with exenatide). 
Semaglutide 1 mg is the highest currently marketed dose; 2 mg semaglutide for treatment of T2DM is 
currently subject to a line extension procedure. However, the comparably low 1 mg dose may have 
contributed to differences in glycaemic potency (especially no on par comparison between semaglutide 1 mg 
and tirzepatide 15 mg). 
Endpoints 
The primary endpoint for assessment of efficacy in the phase 2 and phase 3 studies was change from 
baseline in HbA1c. Change from baseline in body weight was a key secondary endpoint (controlled for type 1 
error) in all studies. Additional clinical endpoints included, but were not limited to, proportions of patients 
Assessment report

reaching glycaemic and body weight loss targets, change from baseline in FSG, 7-point SMBG, waist 
circumference, change from baseline in lipid profile, and patient-reported outcomes. The GPGH substudies 
provided data on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), change from baseline in liver fat content, volume of 
visceral adipose tissue, and volume of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue; the CGM substudy aimed to 
evaluate the 24-hour glucose profile captured with CGM for tirzepatide versus insulin degludec; both were 
compared as regards the percentage of time in the hyper- and hypoglycaemic range. Further, glucose 
variability was assessed. In general, CGM results are considered valuable to contextualise results on patient 
reported outcomes. 
These endpoints are in line with recommendations in the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal 
products in the treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev.2; 9 January 2018). An 
additional stricter responder criterion (proportion of patients who reached HbA1c<5.7%=normoglycemia) 
than those given in the Guideline was used supplemented by an analysis on how many patients achieved this 
target without hypoglycaemia, which is endorsed. 
Population studied 
A total of 6263 patients were randomly assigned and treated with at least on dose of study drug. The 
patients included in the studies were representative of the T2DM target population. Inadequate glycaemic 
control was defined in most of the studies as an HbA1c level of ≥7.0 and ≤10.5%, which is appropriate; in 
the placebo-controlled monotherapie study GPGK a lower upper limit was chosen (≤9.5%).  
The majority of the patients in the phase 3 studies had BMI in the obesity or overweight range. The lower 
limit of the BMI inclusion criterium was BMI ≥25 kg/m2 at screening in studies GPGL, GPGH and GPGM. 
Studies GPGK and GPGI with a lower limit of BMI ≥23 kg/m2 included a proportion of normal weight patients. 
In most phase 3 studies patients with mild to moderate renal impairment were included (lower limit of eGFR 
30 ml/min/1.73 m2), except for study GPGM which had no exclusion criterion based on eGFR. It is stated in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC that “no dose adjustment is needed based on… renal impairment including ESRD”. 
With the Response it had been clarified that very few (n=16) patients with eGFR <30 mL/minute/1.73 m2 
were treated with tirzepatide. By-participant data showed that efficacy seemed not to be lower in this subset 
compared to the overall study population, both with regard to HbA1c and weight. No unexpected safety 
issues occurred in these patients and no deterioration in renal function (eGFR) was noted. Hence, the 
available data do not justify a dose adjustment in patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Instead, a revised wording indicating limited experience in patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD 
in section 4.2 of the SmPC has been added to section 4.2. 
Patients with hepatic impairment were excluded from the phase 3 studies. A clinical pharmacology study 
(Study GPGQ) was conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. No clinically relevant effects of hepatic 
impairment were observed on the PK of tirzepatide in this study. The applicant concluded that patients with 
hepatic impairment do not require different dosing regimens (and inserted a respective wording in section 4.2 
of the SmPC). This was further justified in the Response by hinting at study results which suggest 
improvement of liver-related clinical markers (e. g. liver fat content). The lack of data on patients has been 
reflected with the addition of a sentence in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Study GPGM also included patients with increased cardiovascular risk, defined by coronary heart disease, 
peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, age 50 years or older with a history of CKD and eGFR 
<60ml/min/1.73 m2, or 50 years or older with congestive heart failure. Therefore, this study contributed 
data to support cardiovascular safety (see safety part of this AR). 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 163/212 
 
 
 
Study protocols had no upper age limit; 317 patients who were ≥75 years, and 13 subjects who were ≥85 
years of age were included. Hence, more than 100 geriatric patients were included in the phase 3 program 
and, as such, the requirement as outlined in EMA/ CHMP/ ICH/604661/2009 (ICH topic E7 Studies in Support 
of special populations: Geriatrics Q and A) was met. 
Overall, the patients included in the phase 3 studies were representative of the T2DM target population. 
Statistical methods 
Two estimands were specified for evaluating primary and key secondary objectives (subjected to type I error 
control). The “treatment-regimen” estimand was based on a treatment policy strategy targeting the effect 
regardless of premature treatment discontinuation or initiation of rescue antihyperglycaemic medication. 
Analyses aligned to the “treatment-regimen” estimand were conducted using all available data obtained up to 
the primary endpoint visit, regardless of adherence to study drug or initiation of rescue antihyperglycaemic 
medication. The “efficacy” estimand was based on a hypothetical strategy targeting the effect if all patients 
had not prematurely discontinued study treatment and rescue antihyperglycaemic medication had not been 
introduced. Analyses aligned to the “efficacy” estimand were conducted using data obtained up to the 
primary endpoint visit excluding data after initiation of rescue antihyperglycaemic medication or permanent 
discontinuation of study drug (last dose date + 7 days). 
As per the EMA Draft Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment or prevention 
of diabetes mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 2), the actual adherence to study treatment (e.g. treatment 
discontinuation due to intolerance, lack of efficacy) should be reflected in the target of estimation and the 
evaluation of the effect of test product should not be confounded by rescue medication. Therefore, the 
estimand of primary interest for the EU would be the one targeting the effect regardless of adherence to 
study treatment (treatment policy strategy) and had rescue medication not been introduced (hypothetical 
strategy). For this estimand, data obtained after treatment discontinuation are of interest (patients are not 
expected to benefit once treatment is discontinued), but data obtained after initiation of rescue medication 
are not (they reflect the effect of the rescue medication itself). An analysis had been requested for this 
estimand (using a treatment policy strategy for discontinuations and a hypothetical strategy for rescue 
medication). As expected, given that the frequency of initiation of rescue medication in all treatment groups 
in all studies (except for the placebo group in Study GPGK) was low, results for the estimands as specified for 
evaluating primary and key secondary objectives turned out to be much in line with the newly submitted 
results obtained for the estimand per guideline.  
Conduct of the studies 
Studies were generally well conducted. Patient retention was high (between 89.5% and 94.9% completed the 
study), which is considered reassuring. Of note, patient retention seemed not to depend of the possibility to 
de-escalate the dose. In addition, the frequency of add-on rescue antihyperglycaemic therapies to tirzepatide 
or control was low (tirzepatide 0% to 1.7%; comparator 0.5% to 4.2%). The COVID-19 pandemic did not 
impact evaluation of the efficacy or safety of tirzepatide in any of the phase 3 studies. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results of the phase 2 studies 
The results of study GPGB showed dose-depended effects on glycaemic control and body weight reduction 
over the dose range of 1 mg to 15 mg tirzepatide. Picking the 5mg, 10mg and 15mg tirzepatide dose 
strengths for further evaluation in the phase 3 program is considered acceptable in the light of the 
incremental effect size and the considerably greater proportions of patients achieving HbA1c targets in the 5

mg, 10 mg and 15 mg tirzepatide groups compared to the 1 mg group. In addition, the effect on body weight 
seemed to be more robust at the higher doses. 
Study GPGF supported a dosing algorithm starting at a dose of 2.5 mg accompanied by dose escalation of 2.5 
mg increments every 4 weeks. This scheme was expected to minimize gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions 
and was selected for the phase 3 studies; it is also proposed as the recommended dose-escalation scheme in 
section 4.2 of the SPC, which is considered acceptable. 
Results of the phase 3 studies (all figures refer to the treatment regimen estimand) 
Study results supported the use of once-weekly tirzepatide for glycaemic control in T2DM. All doses of 
tirzepatide were superior to placebo and the active comparators evaluated (semaglutide 1 mg, insulin 
degludec, and insulin glargine) for the mean HbA1c change from baseline (absolute effect sizes ranged for 
tirzepatide 5 mg from -1.75% to -2.11%, for tirzepatide 10 mg from -1.71% to -2.40% and for tirzepatide 
15 mg from -1.69% to -2.41%). Sustainability of glycaemic efficacy through 76 weeks was shown in study 
GPGM. Incremental improvements across the tirzepatide dose range were small; they were absent in study 
GPGK in which patients in an early stage of the disease were included. 
Between 75.1% and 89.6% of patients taking tirzepatide achieved HbA1c <7.0% at the primary endpoint; 
between 21.7% and 49.6% of patients taking tirzepatide achieved HbA1c <5.7%, considered a normal HbA1c 
value. An analysis was performed of patients achieving <5.7% HbA1c at primary endpoint without clinically 
significant documented symptomatic (<54 mg/dL) or severe hypoglycaemia. Reassuringly, the vast majority 
of patients reached HbA1c targets below 5.7% safely: 93.6% to 100% of patients not on a background of 
insulin glargine and 85.9% of patients on a background of insulin glargine. Mainly, cases of clinically 
significant or severe hypoglycaemia were recorded in studies GPGM and GPGI, in which tirzepatide was 
administered add-on SUs (study GPGM) and insulin (study GPGI). There was no discernible dose-dependency 
for development of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia may have been overestimated in the phase 3 
studies as it has to be taken into account that patients in the phase 3 studies underwent forced up-titration. 
In clinical practice up-titration is expected to be performed according to the individual patients’ needs (and 
some patients will reach their glycaemic goal at the 5 mg dose). 
Significant changes from baseline in FSG at the primary endpoint were observed for all tirzepatide groups 
compared to placebo/active comparator. Notably, FSG improved to the near-normal range, and 7-point SMBG 
showed normalization of mean postprandial glucose (<140 mg/dl) at the primary endpoint. Glycaemic control 
seemed to be improved throughout the day, including post-prandial glycaemic excursions. Only a weak dose-
response relationship was seen for lowering of FSG. 
The GPGH CGM addendum demonstrated that tirzepatide led to significantly more time spent in the 
euglycaemic range (71-140mg/dL) at 52 weeks; this was not achieved at the expense of increased 
hypoglycaemia. The overall time spent in hypoglycaemic range ≤70 mg/dL (≤3.9 mmol/L) was significantly 
reduced to less than 1% of time in a 24 hour period, for all 3 doses of tirzepatide compared to insulin 
degludec (2%) at 52 weeks; this was likewise shown for clinically significant hypoglycaemia, <54mg/dL. The 
incidence of nocturnal hypoglycaemia was relatively low, however only tirzepatide 5 mg had significantly 
fewer events compared to insulin degludec. Glycaemic control was further established by improved glycaemic 
variability for patients with tirzepatide compared to insulin degludec. 
Overall, the weak dose-response on glycaemic endpoints is not considered of concern; individual patients are 
expected to attain their glycaemic goals only after up-titration to the highest 15 mg dose. Generally, up-
titration is an effective means to prevent overtreatment.

All doses of tirzepatide were superior to placebo and the active comparators (semaglutide 1 mg, insulin 
degludec, and insulin glargine) for the mean body weight change from baseline at the primary endpoint. 
Reductions in body weight were observed regardless of concomitant therapy with SU or insulin which are 
known to promote weight gain. The mean changes in body weight from baseline to primary endpoint ranged 
from -5.4 kg to -7.6 kg (tirzepatide 5mg), -7.0 kg to -9.6 kg (tirzepatide 10mg) and -7.8 kg to -11.3 kg 
(tirzepatide 15mg). Steady decreases in weight were seen continuing through the end of the study; they did 
not appear to plateau by the end of the treatment period, for both the 40- and 52-week studies. In contrast 
to glycaemic benefit, the dose-response relationship for weight loss was pronounced. 
Results from the GPGH MRI sub-study showed significantly greater reductions from baseline in liver fat 
content, volume of visceral adipose tissue, and volume of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue compared 
with insulin degludec. Reduction of visceral adipose tissue is considered beneficial as it is thought to improve 
cardiovascular health (e. g. Ferrara et al., 2019).  
Albeit weight loss is surely beneficial in the majority of study participants, there is some concern that weight 
loss may be an undesired effect in patients without overweight. In light of ongoing weight loss exceeding the 
observational period in the phase 3 studies, some patients may struggle to keep their weight during chronic 
therapy. To further elucidate the benefit/risk of tirzepatide in the subgroup of patients with BMI between 23 
and 24.9 kg/m2 (from studies GPGK and GPGI) an analysis has been provided with the Response. It has 
been further detailed how many patients had BMI below 18.5 kg/m2 at week 40 or week 52.  
The requested subgroup analysis showed maintained efficacy and no significant safety concerns in patients 
with BMI ≥23 and <25 kg/m2 at baseline. A total of nine patients from studies GPGK (n=478), GPGI 
(n=475), and GPGO (n=636), which included seven patients with BMI ≥23 and <25 kg/m2 at baseline, had a 
BMI ≤18.5 kg/m2 at the end of the study (Week 40 and Week 52, respectively), which is considered a low 
number.  
In clinical practice, the risk of underweight may even be lower, as the treating physician will not have to 
adhere to an assigned dose and will adjust the dose of tirzepatide according to the therapeutic needs and the 
tolerability of each patient.  
On the other hand, patients with lower initial BMI than 23 kg/m2 may be treated with tirzepatide, as use of 
tirzepatide is not restricted per BMI. Therefore, it can be expected that some patients may experience weight 
loss as an undesired effect. 
Therefore, while it is agreed that a general and somewhat arbitrary BMI cut-off for the use of tirzepatide in 
the SmPC or a warning is not warranted (in line with other GLP-1 receptor agonists); “weight decreased” is 
listed as adverse event in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
At the primary endpoint, all tirzepatide groups showed significant decreases from baseline in triglycerides, 
total cholesterol, LDL-C, and VLDL-C. Significant increases from baseline were also observed for HDL-C in 
studies GPGK, GPGL, GPGH, and GPGM. At the primary endpoint, all 3 doses of tirzepatide had significant 
reductions in triglycerides and VLDL-C and significant increases in HDL-C compared to semaglutide in Study 
GPGL. Tirzepatide seemed to improve (diabetic) dyslipidemia which supports the beneficial effects on 
glycaemic control and body weight. Diastolic and systolic blood pressure were reduced. 
Across all QoL measures results for tirzepatide showed improvement from baseline for the vast majority of 
measurement scores (for all but 1 out of 108 PRO scores). Tirzepatide led to greater improvement in scores 
compared to placebo/active comparator indicating an increase in the patients` satisfaction with treatment 
and weight-loss related and overall QoL. These results suggest that the achieved weight-loss and the

improved glycaemic control throughout 24 hours as demonstrated in the CGM substudy seemed to translate 
into better well-being from the patients` perspective. Results from the open-label studies were considered 
less reliable than the double-blind studies GPGK and GPGI, as score ratings may have been influenced by the 
awareness of treatment group assignment. However, no distinct pattern for score changes could be identified 
between open-label and double-blind studies. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Across the five pivotal phase 3 studies, tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg consistently demonstrated statistically 
superior and clinically meaningful glycaemic control and weight loss compared with placebo and current 
standard-of-care diabetes regimens among individuals at different stages of T2DM. Clinically meaningful 
effects on glycaemic control were achieved with a very small increase in hypoglycaemic events, despite 
forced up-titration even to the high 15 mg dose. In clinical practice, where patients are up-titrated in 
accordance with their glycaemic needs and tolerability, the risk of hypoglycaemia is considered low. 
Glycaemic and weight loss benefit was supported by other parameters reflecting cardiometabolic health, like 
favourable effects on the lipid profile, on blood pressure, and on liver and abdominal fat content. The patient 
perspective was taken into account. PRO results reflected an improved QoL. 
Uncertainty with respect to the representation and the B/R in certain subpopulations (patients with stage 4 
and 5 renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and normal weight patients) is removed by amendments to the 
label.  
Initially, a MO had been raised as regards the wording of the indication. The reference to weight was found 
unacceptable. Consecutively, the Applicant consented to delete the reference to “weight” from section 4.1. 
This was considered necessary since the last sentence pointing to 5.1 should be restricted to micro- and 
macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The benefits shown for the respective entities (e.g. 
“cardiovascular benefit”, once confirmed by a CV outcome trial) should be applicable for the entire target 
population (in the SURPASS studies patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have been investigated). Weight 
reduction was investigated as a secondary endpoint in the SURPASS studies; a small proportion of the 
studied population was not overweight (lower cut-off for BMI in studies GPGK and GPGI 23 kg/m2). As the 
SmPC does not restrict use of tirzepatide with respect to BMI and patients with even lower BMI than 23 
kg/m2 (BMI cut-off in the phase 3 studies) might be treated in clinical practise, a proportion of patients may 
experience weight loss as an unwanted effect. 
Furthermore, it was consented by CHMP to add “insufficiently controlled” to the indication wording in line with 
the wording of other GLP1 agonists. Generally, the CHMP agreed on an indication wording (“treatment of 
adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes”) omitting “to improve glycaemic control” even if a benefit 
with respect to cardiovascular outcome has not yet been shown. Results of the performed CV safety meta-
analysis exclude an excessive cardiovascular risk but do not demonstrate a benefit (see 2.6.8.2 under 
Cardiovascular Safety). Tirzepatide, in addition to the improvements in glycaemic control measures, was also 
associated with significant improvements on other health outcomes relevant in the treatment of T2DM 
patients. It is considered undesired to have a long list of separate outcomes and the treatment of T2DM 
should be consider in a more holistic way hence a more simple reference to 5.1 to support this. All relevant 
information is included section 5.1 and study results on effects on glycaemic control are cross-referenced and 
reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Overall, the following wording in 4.1 was found acceptable:

Mounjaro is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as 
an adjunct to diet and exercise  
‒as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications 
‒in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.  
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control, and weight, and cardiovascular 
events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The safety population comprises patients who took ≥1 dose of study drug. The safety assessments were based 
on all available data through treatment period and subsequent 4-week safety follow-up. The applicant presents 
5 analysis sets (AS1 – AS5; see Table 1). Due to their common phase 3-specific dose escalation scheme, the 
phase 3 studies were analysed separately from the phase 2 studies. Analysis of the pooled comparator group 
was  presented  for  both  the  CV  meta-analysis  (dataset  AS5)  and  for  the  safety  analysis  set  AS2.  Additional 
safety data, including those from the biopharmaceutic and clinical pharmacology program (phase 1), are part 
of an Integrated Summary of Safety (ISS).

2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
7769   patients received study treatment (TZP or comparator) in 9 completed Phase 2 and 3 studies.  
5415   patients received TZP for 4833.1 patient-years.  
2375   patients received TZP for ≥52 weeks in phase 2/3 
535  
patients received treatment for ≥78 weeks.  
The population exposed to TZP and the duration of exposure is considered sufficiently large to detect adverse 
events (AEs) of reasonable frequency (0.5 - 5%) and to elucidate, whether frequently occurring AEs increase 
or  decrease  over  time.  A  sufficiently  large  number  of  patients  was  exposed  long-term  (≥52  weeks).  In 
summary,  exposure  meets  the  recommendations  in  the  “Note  for  Guidance  on  Population  Exposure” 
(CPMP/ICH/375/95) and is considered acceptable. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Overview 
In  AS2  (comparison  across  TZP  dosing  groups,  phase  3;  Table  2,  upper  part),  the  number  of  TEAEs  and 
discontinuations of study drug increased incrementally across TZP doses. The percentage of patients with SAEs 
or  discontinuations  from  study  due  to  an  AE  was  similar  across  TZP  dose  groups.  In  AS4  (TZP  vs.  placebo, 
phase 2/3; Table 2, lower part), more TEAEs, SAEs, discontinuations from study and from study treatment 
occurred with TZP than with placebo.

AEs according to MedDRA Terms 
Most common TEAEs (≥5% of either treatment group) in safety analysis sets AS2 and AS4: 
In analogy to the safety profile of GLP1 receptor agonists, the most common TEAEs (≥5% of either treatment 
group)  were  gastrointestinal  AEs.  In  the  placebo-controlled  dataset  AS4,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea, 
dyspepsia,  constipation  and  decreased  appetite  occurred  more  often  with  TZP  than  with  placebo,  while 
hyperglycaemia was reduced by TZP. 
Table 3 illustrates that in the phase 3 dataset AS2, the percentage of nausea, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, 
and vomiting incrementally increased with higher TZP doses. All AEs except for nasopharyngitis occurred more 
often with TZP than with comparator. Moreover, “lipase increased” was higher with TZP than with comparator, 
pointing to a pancreatic effect, which is also known from GLP1 agonists.

AEs of special interest (AESIs) 
For discussion of the AESI “Immunogenicity” please refer to section 2.6.8.7 (“Immunological events”). 
Gastrointestinal Adverse Events 
The most commonly occurring severe/serious GI TEAEs were nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. In AS1, mild and 
moderate GI TEAEs occurred more often in TZP- than placebo-treated patients. Mild GI TEAEs incrementally 
increased with TZP dose, but no such trend was seen for severe GI TEAEs. The frequency of severe TEAEs did 
also not differ between TZP_ALL and placebo (Table 4). Similar safety data were obtained with analysis set 
AS2. There was also no imbalance between TZP dosing groups in AS1 and AS2 for pooled severe and serious 
GI TEAEs.

In contrast to phase 2, GI AEs like nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were considerably mitigated in phase 3 by 
introduction of a dose escalation period (week 0-24). For example, in the phase 2 study GPGB, nausea occurred 
in 20.0 – 41.5% of TZP-treated patients (placebo: 5.9%), while this proportion was reduced to 12.2 – 18.3% 
in phase 3 analysis set AS1 (placebo: 4.3%). 
Comparison with GLP1 receptor agonists (Studies GPGL and GPGO) 
Phase  3  study  GPGL  compared  TZP  (5,  10  and  15  mg)  with  semaglutide  (Sema)  1  mg.  The  proportion  of 
patients with ≥1 GI TEAE was similar with TZP 5 mg and Sema 1 mg. However, the 10 mg and 15 mg TZP 
groups  show  a  numerically  higher  percentage  of  affected  patients  than  Sema  1  mg,  specifically  in  case  of 
nausea and vomiting (Table 5). Similarly, in the regional (Japan) phase 3 study GPGO, comparing TZP with 
dulaglutide (Dula) 0.75 mg, all TZP dosing groups showed numerically higher percentages of patients affected 
by GI TEAEs than the dulaglutide control group (Table 5). This suggests that TZP was not compared on par 
with semaglutide or dulaglutide, and the GLP1 receptor agonists were rather underdosed relatve to TZP.

Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea over time in AS2  
Combined and individual incidence of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea depended on TZP dose and were higher 
during dose-escalation than in steady state. 
The  graphical  representation  of  the  gastrointestinal  AEs  throughout  the  entire  phase  3  study  program  (AS2 
dataset) suggests that, in the 15 mg TZP group, the prevalence of vomiting remains elevated throughout the 
study  as  compared  to  the  first  4  weeks.  According  to  the  Applicant,  the  seemingly  prolonged  prevalence  of 
vomiting is mainly driven by study GPGM, which had a longer duration than all other studies in AS2. In addition, 
the prevalence of vomiting may have additionally been prolonged by the study centres keeping an AE open in 
case of intermittent episodes of vomiting. However, as the product can be discontinued in clinical practice in 
case of inacceptable GI adverse events and since the GI AEs are most likely reversible, this issue is not further 
pursued. 
In  addition,  it  is  noted  that  the  prevalence  of  vomiting  remained  incrementally  increased  with  TZP  dose  at 
safety follow-up (e.g., in AS2: vomiting: TZP 5 mg: 0.12%; 10 mg: 0.36% and 15 mg: 0.60%). This is most 
likely due to the long half-life of TZP, which may have prolonged the AE e.g., after study discontinuation due 
to GI AEs.  
Renal Safety 
In  AS1,  a  numerically  higher  percentage  of  patients  reported  ≥1  renal  TEAE  for  TZP_ALL  (1.1%)  than  for 
placebo (0.4%) (no dose dependency was observed). Similar results were obtained for AS2. However, in AS2, 
seven (0.14%) of the 65 patients with ≥1 renal TEAE in AS2 had severe or serious AEs (TZP 5 mg: 0.12%; 10 
mg: 0.18%; 15 mg: 0.12%).  
A search for MedDRA PTs revealed that the PT “renal cyst” incrementally increased with TZP in safety analysis 
set AS2 and was higher with TZP 10 mg and 15 mg than with pooled comparator (TZP 5 mg: 6 [0.35%]; TZP 
10 mg: 10 [0.59%]; TZP 15 mg: 20 [1.17%] and pooled comparator: 8 [0.36%]). However, it is noted that 
out of the 36 TZP-treated patients with renal cysts in AS2, 15 patients had a pre-existing condition of kidney-
related  disease.  Moreover,  renal  cysts  were  only  reported  as  incidental  findings  in  several  patients,  and  in 
general, there is an increased incidence of renal cysts in T2DM patients. Thus, it is difficult to firmly establish 
a  connection  with  TZP  treatment.  No  difference  in  the  incidence  of  renal  cysts  as  compared  to  placebo  was 
observed in the placebo-controlled datasets AS1 and AS4.  
At  40  weeks  and  safety  follow-up,  the  mean  eGFR  (estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate)  reductions  from 
baseline did not show clinically meaningful differences between TZP doses or between TZP_ALL and comparator 
(AS2). Accordingly, the percentage of patients shifting to higher/lower eGFR categories was comparable across 
treatment groups.

In AS1, mean UACR (urine albumin/creatinine ratio) decreased with TZP, while it increased with placebo. Fewer 
patients  shifted  to  higher  UACR  categories  with  TZP  (9.6%)  than  with  placebo  (18.8%),  and  more  patients 
shifted to lower UACR categories with TZP (13.5%) than with placebo (9.0%). Similar trends occurred in AS2.  
In the subpopulation of patients with renal impairment (eGFR<60, Study GPGM), the renal safety profile was 
similar to that of the total study population. 
Exocrine Pancreas Safety 
Pancreatitis 
In AS2, no relevant differences between TZP dosing groups were observed for any category of pancreatic event. 
Only 11 of 58 CEC-assessed pancreatitis events were adjudicated as acute pancreatitis (Table 6). In AS3, 13 
(0.24%) TZP-treated patients and 4 (0.17%) comparator-treated patients had treatment-emergent, positively 
adjudicated pancreatitis.

which is a known effect of GLP1 receptor agonists.

Both enzymes plateaued at ~24 weeks and decreased after 40 weeks. At safety follow-up, the values were still 
higher than baseline.  
Thyroid Safety 
Calcitonin  plasma  levels  were  determined  in  all  phase  3  studies.  The  results  indicate  that  TZP  treatment 
increases plasma calcitonin.  
A search across the phase 3 study CSRs for the PT “blood calcitonin increased” revealed a TZP-dose-dependent 
increase,  and  a  higher  frequency  with  TZP  than  with  comparator  (TZP  5  mg:  9 [0.53%];  TZP  10  mg:  11 
[0.65%]; TZP 15 mg: 16 [0.93%] vs. pooled comparators: 5 [0.22%]). From the 36 events of “blood calcitonin 
increased” reported in the TZP-treated groups, 27 were mild in severity, and the remainder was moderate. No 
case occured in the pooled placebo groups.  
In  study  GPGO,  post-baseline  blood  calcitonin  was  also  elevated  by  TZP,  while  dulaglutide  0.75  mg  had  no 
effect (TZP 5 mg: 33 [20.75%]; TZP 10 mg: 36 [22.78%]; TZP 15 mg: 42 [26.25%] and dulaglutide 0.75 mg: 
16 [10.06%]. The time course of blood calcitonin in study GPGO is shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1: Blood calcitonin levels over time during study GPGO (Fig. GPGO 8.9, CSR of study GPGO) 
The TZP-dependent elevation of blood calcitonin in study GPGO is also confirmed by the data from the other 
phase 3 studies. The calcitonin levels stayed elevated until the last week of the treatment phase and returned 
to or below baseline levels at safety follow-up (see Table 7, showing change from baseline). It is noted that 
no calcitonin elevation was observed in the semaglutide 1 mg and dulaglutide 0.75 mg comparator groups of 
study  GPGL  and  GPGO,  respectively  (Table  7,  highlighted  in  red;  for  GPGO,  see  additionally  Figure  1). 
Apparently, TZP seems to act differently on the thyroid gland than the established GLP1 receptor agonists.

GPGI  
(Placebo) 
Insulin glargine 
± metformin 
N = number of patients in the population with baseline and post-baseline value at the specified time point;  
n = number of patients with hypoglycaemia; SGLT-2i = sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor;  
Sema = semaglutide; SU = sulfonylurea; TZP = tirzepatide. 
The risk of “BG <54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycaemia” was higher with TZP than with placebo in study GPGI, 
where insulin glargine was part of the background therapy (TZP 5 mg: 15.52%; TZP 10 mg: 19.33%; TZP 15 
mg: 14.17% vs. placebo: 12.5%).  
Not only with insulin as background therapy but also as add-on to metformin, TZP showed a numerically higher 
frequency of “BG <54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycaemia” than the comparator semaglutide (TZP 5 mg: 0.85%; 
TZP  10  mg:  0.21%;  TZP  15  mg:  1.70%  vs.  semaglutide  1  mg:  0.43%;  Study  GPGL).  Similarly,  more 
hypoglycaemias of this category occurred with TZP as compared to dulaglutide 0.75 mg in the regional study 
GPGO. This finding could be related to the relative under-dosing of semaglutide and dulaglutide in these studies 
as already discussed  (e.g., semaglutide, in contrast to TZP, was not given in its maximally weight-reducing 
dose). 
Cardiovascular Safety 
TZP consistently led to small decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (TZP vs. plc in AS1: in mean 
by around 6 mmHg for systolic and by 2 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure). 
Heart rate was increased vs. plc across studies by around 4 bpm. Accordingly, the number of patients 
reporting HR increase by more than 20 bpm vs. baseline was higher in the TZP than in the plc groups (TZP 
5mg, 9.7%, TZP 10 mg, 12.2%, TZP 15 mg, 15.0%; placebo: 6.4%, AS1). 
In ECG, the PR interval was prolonged by 2.7 – 4.5 msec with TZP vs. placebo; no clear dependency on the 
TZP dose was observed. Due to the small magnitude, the finding is not considered clinically relevant. 
Major adverse cardiovascular events (CV safety meta-analysis) 
In accordance with the requirements of the Reflection paper EMA/CHMP/50549/2015, 25 February 2016), a CV 
safety meta-analysis based on data from all phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies was performed to assess the 
effect of TZP on CV risk. The events were prospectively adjudicated by an independent CEC. 
A vast majority of the MACE came from Study GPGM. The primary endpoint of the CV meta-analysis was the 
time to first occurrence of MACE-4, a composite endpoint of death from CV or undetermined causes, MI, stroke, 
and hospitalisation for unstable angina pectoris (HUA). For the meta-analysis, the pooled TZP group combined 
patients randomized to 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg maintenance doses. MACE-3 was investigated as an 
additional endpoint. 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 176/212 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statistical method 
The CV meta-analysis was planned to be conducted after approximately 133 patients reach MACE-4 endpoint. 
An interim CV meta-analysis was conducted after all the following conditions were met: 
1.  At  least  100  patients  have  reached  primary  MACE-4  endpoint  confirmed  by  the  CEC  across  all  the 
studies included in the CV meta-analysis. 
2.  Global Phase 3 Studies GPGK, GPGI, GPGH, and GPGL have achieved their database lock.  
3.  All patients in Study GPGM who have not discontinued the study before 12 months have completed the 
12-month primary endpoint (change in HbA1c) assessment.  
4.  At least 300 patients in Study GPGM have reached 18 months or longer of exposure to tirzepatide. 
Alpha level for the interim analysis was determined based on Hwang, Shih, DeCani (Hwang et al. 1990) with 
Gamma=-6.6 and the information fraction based on the total of 133 MACE-4 endpoints. 
Since 116 of the 133 planned CEC-confirmed MACE-4 endpoints were available at the interim analysis, that is, 
116/133  fraction  of  MACE-4  endpoints,  a  significance  level  of  0.0215  was  utilized  at  the  interim  analysis. 
Accordingly,  97.85%  CI  for  the  HR  (pooled  tirzepatide  versus  pooled  comparator)  guided  the  decision  to 
discharge excess CV risk with tirzepatide. 
Since  the  pre-marketing  safety  requirement  was  met  at  the  interim  CV  meta-analysis  with  116  MACE-4 
endpoints,  the  complete  analysis  with  142  MACE-4  endpoints  was  presented  as  an  additional  supportive 
analysis.  Therefore,  no  alpha  level  adjustment  was  warranted, and  all  analyses  with  142  MACE-4  endpoints 
were conducted using a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. 
All analyses were assessed using the mITT population which consisted of all randomized patients receiving at 
least 1 treatment dose according to the treatment to which they were randomly assigned. In all summaries 
and  analyses,  mITT  population  patients  randomly  assigned  to  any  dose  of  tirzepatide  were  included  in  the 
pooled tirzepatide group, and mITT population patients randomly assigned to placebo or an active comparator 
were included in the pooled control group. Unless otherwise specified, only CV events that occurred during the 
treatment period and the 4-week follow-up period that were positively adjudicated by the CEC, were included 
in the CV meta-analysis. 
Since  the  CV  risk  of  different  studies  varied  based  on  patient  population  and  other  considerations  such  as 
duration of follow-up, a stratification factor by study-level CV risk was set as follows: 
o  Stratum 1: Study GPGM - High CV risk patient population with longer follow-up 
o  Stratum 2: All other trials enrolling lower CV risk patient population (Studies GPGB, GPGH, GPGI, GPGK, 
GPGL, and GPGO) 
Under  the  proportional  hazards  assumption,  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  with  treatment  (pooled 
tirzepatide  arm,  pooled  control  arm)  as  a  fixed  effect  and  stratified  by  study-level  CV  risk  (Stratum  1  and 
Stratum 2) was used to derive the HR (pooled tirzepatide versus pooled control) and the associated CI. 
Counts and proportions of patients who experienced a primary endpoint event were provided. Person-years of 
follow-up for the primary endpoint and the incidence rate were calculated. The incidence rate was calculated 
by  dividing  the  number  of  patients  who  developed  the  event  during  the  study  period  by  the  event-specific

person-years of follow-up. Adjusted Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates of the survival curve for pooled tirzepatide 
arm and pooled control arm were generated. 
Results of the CV safety meta-analysis 
For  the  complete  analysis,  a  total  of  142  patients  (72  TZP,  70  pooled  comparator)  were  reported  with  an 
adjudicated primary endpoint. The results for MACE-4 and its components are tabulated below (Table 9). All 
point estimates of the hazard ratios (HR) were below 1, except for investigator-reported CV death. HR for CEC-
confirmed CV death was below 1.

Regarding the outcome of further CV and mortality endpoints, MACE-3, hospitalisation for heart failure and all-
cause  death,  there  is  numerically  decreasing  frequency  of  these  endpoints  with  increasing  TZP  dose. 
Accordingly, event rate in the TZP-all group is numerically lower than in the combined comparator group. 
Data on CV safety and potential CV benefits of TZP will be provided from the currently ongoing CV outcome 
study  (Study  I8F  MC  GPGN,  SURPASS-CVOT),  with  dulaglutide  as  an  active  comparator.  This  event-driven 
study is expected to enroll 12,500 patients with a history of CV disease, and will have an average treatment

Hypersensitivity Reactions 
No  anaphylactic  reactions  were  observed.  Hypersensitivity  Reactions  were  more  frequently  reported  in  the 
combined TZP than in the plc group of AS1. In detail: 
Immediate: TZP: 4 (0.6%; eczema, injection site hypersensitivity, swelling of eyelid and urticaria); placebo: 1 
(0.4%); no event reported by >1 patient. 
Non-immediate: TZP: 19 (2.6%); placebo: 3 (1.3%). Events in ≥2 patients of any treatment group: rhinitis 
allergic  (TZP:  5  [0.7%];  placebo:  0);  rash  (TZP:  3  [0.4%];  placebo:  1  [0.4%]);  urticaria  (TZP:  3  [0.4%]: 
placebo, 0); injection site hypersensitivity (TZP: 2 [0.3%]; placebo: 0); mostly mild, no discontinuations. 
Since in AS2 no comparator group was included, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn from this dataset. 
However,  one  patient  in  the  TZP  5  mg  group  displayed  marked  signs  of  hypersensitivity:  the  patient 
experienced 16 events of throat tightness, all occurring on days with TZP administration. Each event resolved 
within ≤1 day. “Hypersensitivity” was excluded, and the patient completed the study on study drug without 
additional reports of throat tightness. 
Severe/Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions 
4  (0.08%)  TZP-treated  patients  reported  4  potential  severe  or  serious  non-immediate  hypersensitivity 
reactions. The events were skin necrosis (5 mg TZP, 9 days after last dose, not related to study drug), urticaria 
(5 mg TZP, 7 events starting on day 19, mostly mild or moderate, one severe; all resolved), allergic rhinitis (5 
mg  TZP,  severe,  during  safety  follow-up,  recovering),  eczema  (TZP  15  mg,  severe,  led  to  study  drug 
discontinuation). 
Hypersensitive and injection site reactions in Japan studies 
In  the  studies  GPGO  and  GPGP,  conducted  in  Japanese  patients,  the  incidence  of  potential  hypersensitivity 
reactions was rather high. E.g., potential nonimmediate hypersensitivity occurred in 7.5% of subjects in the 
15 mg TZP group of Study GPGO whereas in the non-Japanese phase 3 studies the incidence ranged from 0 to 
4.2%. However, incidence of potential hypersensitivity events was also higher in the control (dulaglutide) group 
of GPGO compared to the control groups of the non-Japanese studies; GPGP had no control group. Thus, the 
increased  incidence  of  potential  hypersensitivity  reaction  in  Japanese  subjects  is  not  considered  a  safety 
concern of TZP. 
Injection Site Reactions 
In AS1, the percentage of patients with injection site reactions was higher with TZP than with placebo (3.2% 
vs. 0.4%). Likewise, in AS2, the most frequently reported PT was “injection site reaction” (incremental increase 
with TZP dose). All events in AS1 and AS2 were mild or moderate in severity. 
Diabetic Retinopathy Complications 
In the TZP phase 3 program, patients with an increased risk for diabetic retinopathy complications (history of 
proliferative  diabetic  retinopathy,  diabetic  maculopathy,  or  non-proliferative  diabetic  retinopathy  requiring 
acute treatment) were excluded due to prior findings with semaglutide. In the phase 3 studies, 18 (0.35%) 
TZP-treated patients reported worsening of fundoscopic examination results (retinopathy eCRF). Future results 
from the ongoing dedicated addendum study to SURPASS-CVOT (investigating the impact of TZP on diabetic

retinopathy  progression)  should  be  awaited  to  allow  a  more  reliable  estimation  of  the  TZP-associated 
retinopathy risk.  
Hepatobiliary Disorders 
Hepatobiliary events 
Hepatobiliary events reported in the different phase 3 studies are tabulated below. In most studies, event rate

Hepatic analytes (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin)  
Notably,  mean  values  of  AST,  ALT  and  ALP  dose-dependently  decreased  from  baseline  in  the  TZP  groups. 
However, in AS2, for both post-baseline ALT and AST, a higher percentage of patients in the TZP 15 mg group 
as compared to the lower TZP doses was reported in the categories ≥3 x ULN and ≥5 x ULN (Table 11). Post-
baseline ALP was ≥ 2 x ULN in 16 (0.32%) TZP-treated patients (TZP_ALL).

It  is  noted  that  some  of  the  aforementioned  patients  with  elevated  ALT/AST  levels  started  already  with 
increased  enzyme  levels  at  baseline  and/or  may  have  had  a  history  of  confounding  hepatic  diseases  like 
steatosis, NAFLD, hepatitis E or hepatomegaly. Moreover, in some of the patients with ALT/AST elevations ≥3 
x ULN, the high enzyme levels were only detected once and returned to the normal range for the duration of 
the study. Thus, no clear conclusion on a potential causative role of TZP can be drawn. 
However,  hepatotoxicity  of  TZP  is  considered  unlikely,  as  the  applicant  provided  a  drug-induced  serious 
hepatotoxicity  (eDISH)  plot,  revealing  that  none  of  the  patients  met  the  criteria  for  Hy’s  law.  Moreover,  as

mentioned above, ALT, AST and ALP were more prominently reduced from baseline to week 52 at higher TZP 
doses as compared to lower doses in AS2. 
Gallbladder-related disorders 
AS1: Of 12 TZP-treated patients with ≥1 TEAE of hepatobiliary disorders, 4 (0.6%) had gallbladder disease; 
all were in the TZP 5 mg group (no serious/severe event; no study drug discontinuation). 
AS2: Of 146 TZP-treated patients with ≥1 TEAE of hepatobiliary disorders, 51 (1.00%) had gallbladder disease 
(independently of TZP dose; mostly cholelithiasis and cholecystitis). A numerically higher percentage of patients 
reported ≥1 TEAE of gallbladder disease in the pooled TZP group (TZP_ALL) as compared to the comparator 
group across the phase 3 studies (Table 12).

Abbreviations: N = total number of patients in treatment group, n = total number of patients reporting at least 1 
TEAE; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event; TZP = tirzepatide. 
In  AS2,  16  TZP-treated  patients  reported  serious/severe  gallbladder-related  events,  mostly  cholelithiasis 
(TZP_ALL: n=7/0.14%) and cholecystitis (TZP_ALL: n=6/0.12%). 14 of these patients had cholecystectomy 
during  the  studies.  An  increase  in  gallbladder  complications,  specifically  cholelithiasis,  is  known  from  other 
established GLP1 receptor agonists and would also be expected with TZP. 
Moreover, a rapporteur’s search for imbalances in MedDRA PTs in the phase 3 study reports revealed an 
increased occurrence of “gallbladder polyp” with TZP 15 mg as compared to lower TZP doses or control 
groups in AS2 (TZP 5 mg: 3 [0.2%]; TZP 10 mg: 0 [0.0%]; TZP 15 mg: 11 [0.6%] vs. comparator: 1 
[0.1%]). It is noted that 6 of the 11 patients affected in the 15 mg group were still in the dose escalation 
phase. Moreover, in 8 of the patients the Gallbladder polyps were only an incidental finding. Finally, 8 of the 
11 cases of gallbladder polyp in the 15-mg group occurred in the Japan studies, and the literature suggests 
that the prevalence of gallbladder polyps in adults may be higher in East Asian populations. No relevant 
difference between TZP and placebo groups was visible with regard to this AE in datasets AS1 (0.3% and 
0.4%, respectively) and AS4 (0.2% and 0%, respectively).    
Major Depressive Disorder/Suicidal Ideation or Behaviour 
Eating may be a compensatory behavior in some patients, producing positive emotions and satisfaction and 
helping to cope with difficult life situations. TZP-associated AEs like loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting could 
precipitate or worsen depressive episodes in predisposed patients.  
In this regard, it is noted that in AS2, more cases of depression (excl. suicide and self-injury) were reported 
for the TZP 15 mg group as compared to the other dosing groups (TZP 5 mg: 11 [0.65]; 10 mg: 4 [0.24] and 
15 mg: 20 [1.17]). This was mainly driven by the PT “depression” (TZP 5 mg: 6 [0.35]; 10 mg: 3 [0.18] and 
15 mg: 16 [0.93]). 
Four patients (0.08%; none considered related to study drug) experienced ≥1 SAE of major depressive disorder 
or suicide/self-injury:

TZP 5 mg:

TZP 15 mg:

death (depression suicidal); suicide attempt; major depression 
It  is  noted  that  depression  may  potentially  be  associated  with  rather  unspecific  symptoms  (“masked 
depression”). An analysis of the PTs asthenia, malaise or fatigue shows that these symptoms dose-dependently 
increased across the TZP dose-groups and occurred more frequently with TZP as compared to placebo. 
In AS1, at least 1 TEAE of major depressive disorder or suicidal ideation occurred in 5 (0.5%) patients (TZP 5 
mg:  1  [0.4%];  10  mg:  1  [0.4%];  15  mg:  2  [0.8%]  and  placebo:  1  [0.4%]).  No  serious  or  severe  major 
depressive disorder or suicidal ideation events were reported. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths  
No deaths were reported in the biopharmaceutic/clinical pharmacology studies. In AS2, death occurred in 20 
(1.18%),  8  (0.47%)  and  13  (0.76%)  cases  with  TZP  5  mg,  10 mg  and  15  mg,  respectively  (TZP_ALL:  41 
[0.8%]). With comparator, 39 deaths (1.7%) occurred in AS2 (Table 13). The most frequently reported cause 
of  death  was  “sudden  cardiac  death”,  followed  by  “undetermined”  and  “infection”.  There  was  no  major 
imbalance between treatment groups (Table 13). The adjusted estimates (considering different randomization 
ratios and differences in patient populations among strata), yielded 1.0% (TZP_ALL) and 1.2% (comparator) 
deaths.

Note:  The adjusted estimates (considering different randomization ratios and differences in patient 
populations among strata), yielded 1.0% (TZP_ALL) and 1.2% (comparator) deaths.; 
Note: The randomization ratio for Study GPGM was 1:1:1:3 (TZP 5 mg: TZP 10 mg: TZP 15 mg: insulin 
glargine), while other Phase 3 studies with a comparator arm were 1:1:1:1 (TZP 5 mg: TZP 10 mg: TZP 
15 mg: comparator).  
Other SAEs 
In AS1, the number of patients with ≥1 SAE was similar across TZP groups, and between pooled TZP groups 
and placebo (TZP 5 mg: 14 [5.9%]; 10 mg: 15 [6.3%]; 15 mg: 10 [4.1%] and placebo: 13 [5.5%]). The most 
common SAEs (≥0.5% in TZP_ALL) were in the following SOCs:  
Cardiac disorders:  
Infections and infestations  
TZP_ALL: 9 (1.3%) vs. placebo: 4 (1.7%) 
TZP_ALL: 8 (1.1%) vs. placebo: 1 (0.4%) 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders  
TZP_ALL: 5 (0.7%) vs. placebo: 1 (0.4%) 
Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified    
TZP_ALL: 4 (0.6%) vs. placebo: 2 (0.9%) 
Nervous system disorders 
TZP_ALL: 4 (0.6%) vs. placebo: 1 (0.4%) 
SAEs in the SOC “infections and infestations” occurred more than twice as frequently with TZP than with 
placebo in analysis set AS1. 
In AS2, the number of patients with ≥1 SAE was similar across TZP groups (TZP 5 mg: 134 [7.88%]; 10 mg: 
135 [7.93%]; 15 mg: 122 [7.11%]). The most common SAEs (≥0.5% in TZP_ALL) were in the following SOCs:  
Infections and infestations  
Cardiac disorders:  
TZP_ALL: 93 (1.82%) 
TZP_ALL: 87 (1.70%) 
Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified    
TZP_ALL: 47 (0.92%) 
Nervous system disorders 
TZP_ALL: 36 (0.70%) 
In  the  SOC  “Cardiac  disorders”,  the  number  of  events  tended  to  decrease  with  increasing  TZP  dose.  Most 
frequently, acute myocardial infarction, COVID-19 pneumonia and coronary artery disease were reported.  
Analysis of SAEs on individual phase 3 study level revealed the lowest percentage of affected patients in study 
GPGK (no background treatment; TZP_ALL: 2.2%; comparator: 2.6%). Highest percentages were reported for 
studies GPGI (background: insulin glargine; TZP_ALL: 8.7%; comparator: 8.3%) and GPGM (background: 1-3 
OADs;  TZP_ALL:  9.8%;  comparator:  13.0%).  In  GPGL,  SAEs  occurred  more  than  twice  as  frequently  with 
TZP_ALL (6.0%) as compared to the control group (2.8%). 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Laboratory  findings  regarding  renal  safety  (UACR,  eGFR),  exocrine  pancreas  safety  (p-amylase  and  lipase), 
thyroid safety (calcitonin), immunogenicity and hepatobiliary safety (ALT, AST, bilirubin, ALP) are discussed in 
the corresponding subsections above (“AEs of special interest”). 
Hemoglobin/Anemia 
In  AS1,  a  slight  decrease  from  baseline  in  haemoglobin  (Hb)  was  observed  in  all  groups  including  plc.  This 
effect was somewhat more pronounced in the TZP groups and, accordingly, more subjects shifted from normal 
to low Hb in the combined TZP than in the plc group (16.3% vs. 9.2%). Anaemia was reported infrequently in 
TZP-treated patients in AS1 (TZP_ALL: 1.1% vs. placebo: 0%).

In AS2, the percentage of patients with anemia ranged from 0.2% to 2.5% with TZP and from 0% to 3.5% 
with comparator, with no consistent pattern between studies. In Study GPGM (largest study, longest treatment 
duration, about 1:1 randomization to TZP_ALL or comparator insulin glargine), the percentage of patients with 
≥1 TEAE of anaemia was similar in TZP- and insulin glargine-treated patients (2.5% and 3.5%, respectively)

Anaemia is common in patients with T2DM and kidney disease, and the observation that haemoglobin decreased 
over  time  in  all  treatment  groups  (including  placebo)  probably  reflects  the  development  of  the  underlying 
disease.  Overall,  the  data  do  not  suggest  that  low  hemoglobin  or  anaemia  are  safety  concerns  with  TZP 
treatment.

Due to the low number of subjects aged ≥85 years, it is virtually impossible to draw reliable conclusions on 
tolerability of TZP in this age group. 
Regarding subjects <65, 65-74 and 75-84 years: 
•  The percentage of total TEAEs was numerically higher across all three age groups in the TZP_ALL group vs. 
pooled comparator. However, the SAEs were numerically reduced in the TZP_ALL vs. the pooled comparator 
group.  
•  Most event categories are numerically lower (or at least unchanged) in the TZP-treated patients (TZP_ALL) 
as compared to the pooled comparator group. 
•  However,  the  category  “AEs  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation”  is  strongly  increased  in  TZP-treated 
patients (TZP_ALL) as compared to the pooled comparator group, specifically in the higher age groups (e.g., 
21.95 % discontinue TZP treatment due to AEs in the 75-84 age group, but only 10.29 % of this age group 
discontinue  comparator  treatment).  It  is  suspected  that  this  category  may  be  driven  by  gastrointestinal 
events.  
•  It is reassuring that no event of the category “quality of life decreased” is listed for TZP-treated patients. 
Gastrointestinal AEs in the elderly: 
An additional analysis of gastrointestinal AEs across age groups in the TZP_ALL group (AS2 dataset) revealed 
a slightly increased frequency in patients aged 75-84 years than in younger patients (<65: 43.77%; 65-74: 
42.80%; 75-84: 45.85%). This tendency was specifically visible for diarrhoea and vomiting:  
AS2: 
Diarrhoea:  
TZP_ALL: <65: 15.45%  
65-74: 12.89%  
75-84: 19.02 %  
Vomiting:  
TZP_ALL: <65:   7.65%  
65-74:   7.16%  
75-84: 11.22 %  
No such trend was visible for vomiting and diarrhoea in the comparator group. 
Table 16 below shows that the percentage of patients discontinuing due to gastrointestinal AEs increased with 
age in the TZP_ALL group of dataset AS2, while no such trend occurred in the comparator group.

Renal or hepatic insufficiency 
In the clinical pharmacology study (I8F-MCGPGG), which investigated the PK of 5 mg of TZP (single s.c. dose) 
in subjects with varying levels of renal impairment, no clinically relevant effects of renal impairment on the PK 
of TZP were observed. Therefore, no dose adjustments were recommended in patients with renal impairment 
or in patients undergoing dialysis. There is only limited data on patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2.  
Patients  with  hepatic  impairment  were  excluded  from  the  Phase  3  program.  To  evaluate  the  use  of  TZP  in 
patients  with  hepatic  impairment,  the clinical  pharmacology  study  GPGQ  was  conducted,  where  no  clinically 
relevant effects of hepatic impairment were observed on the PK of TZP. No long-term clinical data on hepatic 
impairment are available. 
GI disease 
No data on patients with severe GI disease are available. 
2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
Immunogenicity 
The applicant provided an extensive analysis of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) as summarized in the following. 
The other aspects of immunogenicity, systemic hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions, are 
discusses as AEs of special interest in the respective section above. In this section the relationship between 
the presence of ADA and the incidence of hypersensitivity and injection site reactions will be summarized. 
Analytical methods for ADA detection 
Binding antibodies 
The assay principle was a so-called affinity capture and elution (ACE) approach, which employs 2 TZP 
analogues, GIP735 with a single biotin in place of the fatty acid, and GIP740 with a single N-terminal biotin. 
This approach served to control the biotin placement and to minimize nonspecific labelling. The positive 
control material was isolated from cynomolgus monkeys hyperimmunised with ovalbumin-coupled TZP, 
yielding serum with an approximate titre of 1:102,400 against the drug.  
The assay encompassed the following consecutive steps (tiers): Tier 1 was a screening assay, where ADA 
was detected as described above without further control for specific binding. Any sample yielding a signal 
ratio ≥the Tier 1 floating cut point factor was transferred to Tier 2a; all other samples with lower signal ratios 
were reported as “not detected”. In Tier 2a, an excess of unlabelled TZP was added to the assay to control 
for specific binding. Samples with a percent inhibition ≥ the Tier 2a cut point were reported as “detected,” 
and further evaluated in tiers 2b, 2c and 3. In Tier 2b, an excess of unlabelled native GIP(1-42) was added 
to the biotin-labelled TZP analogue-containing detection solution to address cross-reactive binding to native 
GIP(1-42). Accordingly, in Tier 2c cross-reactive binding to native GLP-1(7-36) was addressed by adding 
excess unlabelled GLP-1(7-36). Finally, in Tier 3, confirmed positive samples were serially diluted to identify 
the highest sample dilution still yielding a response ≥ the titration cut point of the assay, which allowed titer 
quantitation of ADA confirmed in Tier 2a. 
The validation strategy for this assay is summarised in Table 17 below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 187/212 
 
 
 
Table 17: Validation Strategy Table 
Neutralising antibody (NAb) assay 
For characterization of the neutralizing activity of ADA the following cell-based and in-silico assays were 
used: 
1.  Cell-based NAb assay to detect ADA that prevent TZP from activating the GIPR (Tier 4a). 
2.  Cell-based NAb assay to detect ADA that prevent TZP from activating the GLP1R (Tier 4b). 
3.  In silico classification using Tier 2b/4a results to detect ADA preventing GIPR activation by nGIP. 
4.  In silico classification using Tier 2c/4b results to detect ADA preventing GLP1R activation by nGLP-1. 
The in-silico approach was chosen for NAbs cross-reacting with endogenous GLP-1 or GIP because the cell-
based assays turned out to have a low drug tolerance (i.e. are affected by peptides present in the plasma 
samples). 
The in-silico classification was performed as follows: Any patient sample with cross-reactivity to native GIP 
(Tier 2b) and capable of neutralising TZP activity on the GIPR (Tier 4a) will be considered positive for cross-
reactive NAb against native GIP. Likewise, any samples positive for cross-reactive ADA to GLP-1 in Tier 2c 
and positive for NAb in Tier 4b will be considered positive for cross-reactive NAb activity against native GLP-
1. 
ADA Results 
Overview 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022

The evaluated ADA for the safety datasets AS1 (placebo-controlled studies) and AS2 (TZP-treated patients in 
Phase 3 studies). ADA were regarded as treatment-emergent (TE) if they were induced or boostered (i.e., 
increase in titre) during treatment. 
In AS1, the following observations were made (similar results in AS2, which lacks the comparator group):  
At baseline, 77 (8.3%) patients had pre-existing ADA (similar rates with TZP and placebo). The baseline ADA 
titres ranged from 1:10 to 1:640 (median 1:20). Post-baseline, 695 TZP-treated patients were evaluable for 
TE ADA during the planned treatment period. Of these, 352 (50.6%) were TE ADA+. Only a small fraction of 
ADA (~1%) were neutralising according to the laboratory tests. 
In detail: 
•  327 (47.1%) were classified as treatment induced 
•  25 (3.6%) were classified as treatment boosted 
•  226 (32.5%) patients were positive for cross-reactive binding ADA to nGIP 
•  92 (13.2%) patients were positive for cross-reactive binding ADA to nGLP-1 
•  8 (1.2%) patients were positive for NAb against TZP activity on GIPR 
•  7 (1.0%) patients were positive for NAb against TZP activity on GLP-1R 
•  5 (0.7%) patients were positive for cross-reactive NAb against nGIP 
•  4 (0.6%) patients were positive for cross-reactive NAb against nGLP-1 
The maximum titre ranged from 1:20 to 1:40960 (median 1:160). 
In the placebo group, 11 patients (4.8%) were TE ADA+ during the planned treatment period. 
Time-to-First TE ADA+ Titre 
The cumulative frequency of TZP-treated patients from each Phase 3 study who had developed TE ADA by 
specific time points shows that the Time-to-first TE ADA+ titre followed similar profiles across all Phase 3 
studies; most ADAs developed within 40 weeks. In detail: 
•  4.6 to 10.7% (median 7.2%) developed TE ADA by 12 weeks, 
•  19.9 to 38.2% (median 25.6%) by 24 weeks, 
•  31.4 to 58.4% (median 45.9%) up to 40 weeks, 
•  38.4 to 65.5% (median 50.5%) up to 52 weeks, and 
•  40.7 to 67.6% (median 54.2%) up to 78 weeks (includes GPGH, GPGM, GPGO, and GPGP studies 
only). 
The median titre was highest between Week 40 and Week 52 (up to 1:160) and decreased thereafter (1:80 
or 1:40). 
Persistence of ADA 
Persistent ADA was defined as TE ADA detected at 2 or more sampling time points, with the first and last 
ADA+ samples separated by ≥16-weeks. Transient ADA was defined as TE ADA detected with the first and 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 189/212 
 
 
 
last ADA+ samples separated by a period of <16 weeks and with TE ADA not detected at the last sampling 
time point. Other constellations were regarded as potentially persistent. 
In the TE ADA+ patients, ADA were 
• 
• 
• 
persistent in 72.3% of cases 
potentially persistent in 11.9% 
transient in 15.8 % of cases. 
In absolute terms, of the patients treated with tirzepatide (any dose), 38.3 % developed persistent ADA.  
Effect of ADA on PK (clearance) 
No relationship between the presence of ADA and the clearance of TZP was detectable. The applicant also 
investigated the relationship between ADA titres and clearance, revealing a tendency to slightly lower TZP 
clearance with higher ADA titres, but the number of patients with high titres is low. Therefore, no firm 
conclusions are possible. 
Effect of ADA on treatment outcome (HbA1c) 
In mean, ADA+ patients displayed a slightly lower HbA1c reduction in most studies. In Studies GPGL and 
GPGM some patients had a very poor glycaemic control. Notably, these outliers were mainly found among 
the ADA+ patients. The applicant also presented an analysis on the relationship between ADA titre (≥1:5120 
vs. <1:5120) and HbA1c level. According to this analysis, the outliers were in the low-titre group, i.e. the 
poor glycaemic control was not due to high ADA titres. Also, the applicant provides an evaluation of HbA1c 
level in relation to the presence of neutralising antibodies (as identified by the in-vitro assays described 
above). No meaningful conclusions can be drawn from this evaluation. This may be due to the low number of 
patients with NAbs. 
In summary, a small effect of ADA on the efficacy of TZP cannot be excluded, but due to the small size, it is 
not considered clinically relevant. 
Correlation of ADA and hypersensitivity reactions / injection site reactions 
Of the 179 total TZP-treated patients with hypersensitivity reactions during the planned treatment period, 
106 were TE ADA+ and 73 were TE ADA-. One ADA+ patient had a severe hypersensitivity reaction. The 
other events were mild or moderate in severity. 
Of the 137 total TZP-treated TE ADA-evaluable patients with injection site reaction (prespecified MedDRA 
search) during the planned treatment period, 119 were TE ADA+ and 18 were TE ADA-. 
2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Similar to established GLP1 receptor agonists, TZP delays gastric emptying and intestinal transit time. This may 
result  in  altered  absorption  of  other  orally  administered  concomitant  medications,  potentially  altering  PK 
parameters like Cmax and Tmax. The influence of TZP on gastrointestinal function was addressed in phase 1 study 
GBGA  (acetaminophen  as  a  probe  to  assess  gastric  emptying).  Physiologically  based  PK  modelling  was 
conducted  instead  of  drug-drug  interaction  studies  for  acetaminophen,  lisinopril,  metoprolol,  digoxin,  oral 
contraceptives, atorvastatin, sitagliptin, metformin and warfarin. In addition, the drug-drug interaction study 
GPGR was conducted to evaluate the interaction of TZP with combination oral contraceptives in healthy female 
subjects.

2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In AS1, a higher percentage of TZP- than placebo-treated patients permanently discontinued study drug due 
to an AE (non-specific reasons excluded), with an incremental increase across TZP doses (TZP 5 mg: 11 [4.6%]; 
10 mg: 16 [6.7%]; 15 mg: 21 [8.7%]; placebo: 6 [2.6%]). The most frequent AEs causing discontinuation 
were from the SOC gastrointestinal disorders. This was confirmed by AS2 (TZP 5 mg: 121 [7.11%]; 10 mg: 
145  [8.52%];  15  mg:  169  [9.85%]),  with  SOC  gastrointestinal  disorders  (mostly  nausea,  diarrhoea  and 
vomiting) responsible for ~50% of all discontinuations. The incremental increase across TZP doses (5 mg: n=2; 
10 mg: n=33; 15 mg: n=42) in AS2 is illustrated by the Kaplan-Meier plot in Figure 2.  
Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier plot of time to premature study treatment discontinuation due to AEs in AS2 
It is noted that the curves in Figure 2 separate at the end of the dose escalation period (i.e., after week 24). 
Across all TZP treatment groups, 53.1% of patients discontinued prior to receiving their maintenance dose. In 
GPGH, GPGM and GPGP, the option to de-escalate the dose (TZP 10 mg  5 mg or TZP 15 mg  10 mg) was 
used by 104 (14.4%), 101 (15.2%) and 34 (11.5%) patients, respectively. A comparison of the reasons for 
treatment discontinuation earlier in the study (0-24 weeks) vs. later (>24 weeks) confirms that gastrointestinal 
AEs play a larger role during the dose escalation phase. A similar effect can be seen for more unspecific AEs 
like  “malaise”  or  “asthenia”.  Furthermore,  two  cases  of  “abnormal  loss  of  weight”  occurred  as  reasons  for 
treatment discontinuation after >24 weeks. 
As illustrated by Table 16 above, the percentage of patients discontinuing due to gastrointestinal AEs increased 
with age in the TZP_ALL group of dataset AS2, while no such trend occurred in the comparator group. 
Comparison with GLP1 agonists: 
In study GPGL, more patients discontinued study drug due to gastrointestinal AEs in the TZP 10 mg (20 [4.3%]) 
and 15 mg (20 [4.3%]) group as compared to sema 1 mg (15 [3.2%]). In study GPGO (conducted in Japan), 
more  patients  discontinued  due  to  a  gastrointestinal  AE with  TZP  (any  dose  group)  than  with  dula  0.75  mg 
(TZP 5 mg: 7 [4.4%]; 10 mg: 4 [2.5%]; 15 mg: 11 [6.9%]; dula: 1 [0.6%]).

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety analysis sets, exposure and discontinuations 
The  applicant  has  provided  five  safety  analysis  sets  (AS).  AS1  (phase  3)  and  AS4  (phase  2/3)  only  include 
placebo-controlled studies; AS2 and AS3 comprise all phase 3 and phase 2/3 studies, respectively. For AS1 
and  AS4,  the  applicant  compares  TZP  vs.  placebo,  for  AS2  an  analysis  TZP  vs.  comparator  is  presented. 
Moreover,  AS2  compares  the  different  TZP  dose  levels.  For  AS3,  only  a  summary  was  presented,  but  no 
comparison was performed (neither between TZP dosing groups, nor between TZP and comparator). For AS5, 
which focuses on cardiovascular risk assessment, a comparison of TZP vs. comparator groups is provided.  
The  population  exposed  to  TZP  and  the  exposure  duration  (5415  patients  received  TZP  for  4833.1  patient-
years)  is  considered  sufficient  to  detect  AEs  of  reasonable  frequency  (0.5  -  5%)  and  to  elucidate,  whether 
frequently occurring AEs increase or decrease over time. Long-term exposure (>2000 patients exposed to TZP 
for ≥52 weeks) is considered adequate. Thus, exposure corresponds to the recommendations of the “Note for 
Guidance on Population Exposure” (CPMP/ICH/375/95). 
As  expected  with  a  GLP1  receptor  agonist,  a  large  part  of  study  drug  discontinuations  was  due  to 
gastrointestinal  AEs,  particularly  in  elderly  subjects.  In  clinical  reality,  this  would  be  addressed  by  dose 
reduction, an option, which was available and used in studies GPGH, GPGM and GPGP of the TZP program. The 
curves in the discontinuation Kaplan Meier Plot of AS2 separate at the end of the dose escalation period (week 
24). A comparison of the reasons for treatment discontinuation earlier in the study (0-24 weeks) vs. later (>24 
weeks) confirms that gastrointestinal AEs play a larger role during the dose escalation phase. A similar effect 
can be seen for more unspecific AEs like “malaise” or “asthenia”. The occurrence of two cases of “abnormal 
loss  of  weight”  as  reasons  for  treatment  discontinuation  after  >24  weeks  underlines  that  caution  should  be 
exercised when treating non-overweight patients with TZP. 
AEs, including AEs of special interest (AESIs) 
Although TZP shows a safety profile similar to other GLP1 receptor agonists, the 10 mg and/or 15 mg dose 
caused more gastrointestinal, pancreatic, hypoglycaemic and systemic (such as asthenia) AEs and decreased 
blood pressure to a larger extent than semaglutide 1 mg or dulaglutide 0.75 mg. It should be noted, however, 
that, semaglutide and dulaglutide could have been under-dosed in relation to TZP because the GLP-1RAs were 
used in their antidiabetic dose, while TZP also caused marked weight reduction (which requires higher doses 
as known from liraglutide), precluding on par comparison with TZP. 
The  applicant  has  analysed  the  following  AESIs:  gastrointestinal  AEs,  dehydration,  renal  safety,  metabolic 
acidosis,  exocrine  pancreas  safety,  thyroid  safety,  hypoglycaemia,  severe  persistent  hyperglycaemia, 
cardiovascular  safety,  amputation  or  peripheral  revascularization,  hypersensitivity  reactions,  injection  site 
reactions, immunogenicity, diabetic retinopathy complications, hepatobiliary disorders, malignancy and major 
depressive disorder/suicidal ideation or behaviour. 
The most common TEAEs (≥5%) were gastrointestinal AEs, mostly nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, occurring 
specifically during the phase 3 study dose escalation phase. However, the dose escalation effectively mitigated 
gastrointestinal AEs in comparison to phase 2, where no such phase was included. TZP did not increase severe 
GI TEAEs in comparison to placebo. It seems that the prevalence of vomiting remains increased with TZP 15 
mg throughout the study duration as compared to the first 4 weeks, and GI AEs appear to persist for a longer 
time at safety follow-up.  According to the applicant, the appearingly prolonged prevalence of vomiting is mainly 
driven by study GPGM, which had a longer duration than all other studies in AS2. In addition, the prevalence 
of  vomiting  may  have  additionally  been  prolonged  by  the  study  centres  keeping  an  AE  open  in  case  of 
intermittent episodes of vomiting. It is noted that this may have led to an underestimation of the number of 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 192/212 
 
 
 
AEs  of  vomiting.  Regarding  the  persistence  of  vomiting  during  the  safety  follow-up,  this  could  be  explained 
with the long half-life of TZP, which may have prolonged the AE e.g., after study discontinuation due to GI AE.  
In  general,  gastrointestinal  AEs  are  considered  not  of  major  concern,  as  they  would  be  managed  in  clinical 
reality by dose adjustment. It is noted that no data on patients with severe GI disease are available. However, 
a slight increase of the frequencies of diarrhoea and vomiting was observed in TZP-treated patients aged 75-
84  years  as  compared  to  younger  age  groups.  Moreover,  the  percentage  of  patients  discontinuing  due  to 
gastrointestinal AEs increased with age in the TZP_ALL group of dataset AS2, while no such trend occurred in 
the comparator group. For elderly, electrolyte disturbance or dehydration caused by nausea and vomiting may 
be particularly hazardous. This is reflected in the SmPC.  
TZP did not appear to significantly worsen kidney function in T2DM patients. However, it is noted that there is 
only limited data on patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Two patients (both randomized to TZP 15 mg) 
showed  a  very  fast  decline  in  renal  function.  However,  both  patients  had  pre-existing  conditions  of  diabetic 
nephropathy  at  baseline  and  received  concomitant  therapy  with  confounding  medications  (omeprazole  and 
amoxicillin). Thus, it is difficult to conclude on a causative role of TZP. In general, the safety data generated in 
the  TZP  development  program  do  not  indicate  a  nephrotoxic  effect  of  TZP  or  glomerular  damage  by  ADA-
containing immune complexes.  
The PT of “renal cyst” was increased with TZP 10 and 15 mg as compared to control. However, it is noted that 
out of the 36 TZP-treated patients with renal cysts in AS2, 15 had a pre-existing condition of kidney-related 
disease.  Renal  cysts  are  often  asymptomatic  and  only  reported  as  incidental  findings  and  their  incidence  is 
increased in patients with T2DM. Thus, it is difficult to firmly establish a connection with TZP treatment. No 
difference  in  the  incidence  of  renal  cysts  as  compared  to  placebo  was  observed  in  the  placebo-controlled 
datasets AS1 and AS4.  
Thyroid safety was a pre-defined AESI, since C cell hyperplasia  and thyroid carcinomas were observed with 
TZP in rodents in line with what has been reported for other long-acting GLP-1 agonists. It is reassuring that 
no  case  of  medullary  thyroid  carcinoma  (MTC)  or  C-cell  hyperplasia  was  reported  in  the  phase  2/3  clinical 
studies.  However, the risk for developing MTC cannot be fully explored from controlled data in the clinical trial 
program covering rather short observation periods. Moreover, it is noted that detection of C-cell hyperplasia 
would require special diagnostics so that it would not be detected and reported in most cases. The applicant 
has performed more detailed endocrinological evaluation in the small subset of patients with very high calcitonin 
levels.  
Across the phase 3 study program, mean serum calcitonin levels were higher with TZP than with comparator. 
Of note, the comparators semaglutide 1 mg and dulaglutide 0.75 mg did not increase calcitonin, suggesting 
that the slight calcitonin increase is a peculiarity of tirzepatide. Furthermore, the PT “blood calcitonin increased” 
was  also  reported  more  frequently  in  TZP-treated  patients  as  compared  to  control  groups.  Of  note,  the 
applicant’s calcitonin assays did not show cross-reactivity with procalcitonin, and it is considered unlikely that 
procalcitonin was inadvertently detected during the calcitonin measurements. Procalcitonin was not determined 
in the TZP clinical program. Although the calcitonin elevations were usually reversible and not acutely clinically 
relevant (mostly within normal range), the long-term consequences (e.g. increased risk of C-cell malignancy) 
are currently unclear. An underlying mechanism could not be established. However, MTC has been adequately 
proposed to be included in the RMP, in line with other GLP-1 agonists. Serum amylase and lipase increased 
with TZP treatment, in line with what has been described with other incretin-based treatment. In the placebo-
controlled dataset AS1, more TZP- than placebo-treated subjects exhibited an increase in serum amylase from 
normal (<1×ULN) levels at baseline to postbaseline values of >1×ULN to ≤3×ULN (15.9% vs 5.1% for TZP vs 
placebo) and of >3×ULN to ≤5×ULN (0.7% vs 0% for TZP vs placebo). Moreover, the proportion of subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 193/212 
 
 
 
reaching post-baseline lipase values of >3×ULN to ≤5×ULN (2.8% vs 0.9% for TZP vs placebo) and >5×ULN 
to ≤10×ULN (0.6% vs 0% for TZP vs placebo) was higher for TZP as compared to placebo.    
TZP may increase the risk of pancreatitis; however, the number of cases was low, which is reassuring. In the 
phase  2/3  program,  the  incidence  of  acute  pancreatitis  was  increased  for  TZP  (0.24%)  compared  with  the 
comparator group (0.13%; all treated with semaglutide). No adjudicated events of pancreatitis were identified 
in the integrated analysis of placebo-controlled phase 3 studies (AS1). Notably, many of investigator-reported 
cases  of  pancreatitis  (47  patients)  were  adjudicated  “no  event”,  the  majority  (43)  due  to  negative  imaging 
results.  
Two cases, #GPGH-109-2671 and #GPGI-300-5214, were adjudicated “no event”, despite signs and symptoms 
of pancreatitis. Patient GPGH-109-2671 had negative imaging results and, according to one of the adjudicators, 
amylase  and  lipase  were  <3  x  ULN.  In  case  of  patient  GPGI-300-5214,  symptoms  were  rather  unspecific 
(dyspepsia) and amylase and lipase were < 3 x ULN, but sonography showed signs of subacute pancreatitis. It 
is somehow controversial, whether this patient should be considered “event” of acute pancreatitis or “no event” 
(i.e. pancreatitis, but not acute). A causal relationship between development of pancreatitis and TZP treatment 
cannot be excluded. Acute pancreatitis as well as increased amylase and increased lipase are labeled in the 
SmPC Section 4.4 and 4.8. 
The  hypoglycaemic  risk  profile  of  TZP  essentially  corresponds  to  the  known  risk  profile  of  GLP1  receptor 
agonists. TZP increased hypoglycaemias of the category “BG <54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycaemia” mainly in 
combination with other glucose-lowering drugs (i.e., insulin glargine or SU), but did not appear to cause such 
events when used alone. Severe hypoglycaemia was uncommon with TZP treatment. 
In AS1, an increase in pulse rate of 3.3-5.2 beats/ minute for TZP vs. 1.0 beat/minute for placebo was noted. 
In the phase 3 studies, the pulse rate increased in a dose-dependent manner (TZP 5 mg: 4.3 bpm; 10 mg: 4.9 
bpm and 15 mg: 5.7 bpm). The magnitude of mean pulse rate was lower when excluding the Japanese studies 
(3.8 bpm, 4.0 bpm and 4.6 bpm for tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively). The magnitude of mean 
increase in pulse rate was highest for Japanese patients (6.1 bpm, 7.9 bpm and 9.5 bpm for tirzepatide 5 mg, 
10 mg and 15 mg, respectively). Moreover, the incidence of patients who met threshold criteria for abnormal 
pulse  was  dose-dependently  higher  for  TZP  as  compared  to  placebo.  The  incidence  of  patients  who  had  a 
change  of  baseline  pulse  rate  of  >20  bpm  was  9.7%,  12.2%  and  15.0%  for  TZP  5 mg,  10  mg  and  15 mg, 
respectively, compared with 6.4% for placebo. The incidence of patients that had a pulse rate of >100 at any 
visit  was  7.2%,  9.7%  and  16.3%  for  TZP  5 mg,  10  mg  and  15  mg,  respectively,  compared  with  6.8%  for 
placebo. Increased pulse rate is therefore included in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. In this context, it is noted that 
for GLP1 receptor agonists, the maximum pulse rate increase occurs at rest (during the night), and the rate 
assessed  by  office  measurements  (and  proposed  for  Section  5.1  of  the  SmPC)  is  not  representative. 
Nevertheless, measuring the night time heart rate for patients treated with TZP is not considered necessary, 
since the CV safety assessment (AS5) suggests TZP does not lead to excess CV risk. Moreover, further data on 
cardiovascular  safety  are  going  to  be  gained  in  a  dedicated  head-to-head  CVOT  study  between  TZP  and 
dulaglutide.  
Comparing pooled TZP vs. pooled comparators in AS5, a HR of 0.81 (97.85% CI, 0.52 to 1.26) was attained at 
the interim analysis. Thus, the upper limit of the CI of the HR of MACE 4 for TZP vs. comparators was less than 
the regulatory-stipulated limit of 1.8 for submission, thereby fulfilling the pre-marketing safety requirement. 
The upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the HR was also less than the regulatory stipulated limit of 1.3 and 
thus, demonstrated that treatment with TZP was not associated with excess CV risk. The results of the complete 
analysis (HR of 0.80; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.11 for the primary MACE 4 composite endpoint), as well as analyses 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 194/212 
 
 
 
of the composite endpoint of MACE-3 support the interim analysis. The result regarding MACE-4 was confirmed 
by MACE-3, which was tested in a sensitivity analysis.  
The applicant is going to conduct the SURPASS-CVOT with MACE-3 as the primary efficacy outcome for ultimate 
conclusion of the CV efficacy and safety of TZP. 
Data on CV safety and potential CV benefits of TZP will be provided from the currently ongoing CV outcome 
study  (Study  I8F  MC  GPGN,  SURPASS-CVOT),  with  dulaglutide  as  an  active  comparator.  This  event-driven 
study is expected to enrol 12,500 patients with a history of CV disease, and will have an average treatment 
follow up of approximately 4 years. Of note, although the cardiovascular meta-analysis clearly excluded excess 
cardiovascular risk, a cardiovascular benefit has not been demonstrated yet, since the completion of SURPASS-
CVOT is projected for 2025. Thus, TZP can only be approved for glycaemic control in T2DM based on the dossier 
submitted.  
Immunological aspects of TZP treatment were covered by the AESIs “hypersensitivity reactions”, “injection site 
reactions”  and  “immunogenicity”.  No  anaphylactic  reaction  was  observed.  In  AS1,  the  incidence  of 
hypersensitivity reactions was increased for TZP (3.2%) compared with placebo (1.7%) in AS1. No potential 
immediate  or  non-immediate  severe  or  serious  hypersensitivity  reactions  were  reported  in  AS1.  A  similar 
percentage of patients reported immediate and non-immediate hypersensitivity AEs across TZP dose groups in 
the total phase 3 dataset (AS2). Moreover, in AS2, a total of 4 (0.08%) TZP-treated patients reported potential 
severe  or  serious  non-immediate  hypersensitivity  reactions  (skin  necrosis,  urticaria,  allergic  rhinitis  and 
eczema). Four of the six study discontinuations due to hypersensitivity reactions occurred in the Japan studies 
GPGO and GPGP, and one patient from Japan has repeatedly experienced throat tightness in association with 
TZP  administration.  However,  in  the  comparator  group  (dulaglutide)  of  Study  GPGO,  the  frequency  of 
hypersensitivity reactions was also higher than in the comparator groups of the other phase 3 studies (study 
GPGP did not include a comparator group). This could indicate that Japanese patients are more susceptible to 
hypersensitivity reactions but does not appear to be a specific safety concern of TZP. 
As to be expected with a non-physiological peptide like TZP, the frequency of injection site reactions (mainly 
erythema,  pruritus,  induration,  pain  and  oedema)  was  increased  with  TZP  vs.  placebo.  Most  injection  site 
reactions (78.35%) occurred > 6 hours after study drug administration, with 34.33% occurring from 24 hours 
to  14  days  post-administration.  It  is  reassuring  that  none  of  the  injection  site  reactions  identified  from  the 
predefined MedDRA search were severe or serious. However, analysis of the dedicated injection site reaction 
electronic case report forms (eCRFs) revealed severe signs and symptoms of “bright red erythema” (68 events 
in  10  patients  [6.76%])  and  one  event  of  “severe  induration”  in  1  patient  ([0.68%])  in  AS2.  Injection  site 
reactions have adequately been proposed to be included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.   
Immunogenicity  of  TZP  was  assessed  by  determining  the  new  formation  or  increase  in  titre  of  anti-drug 
antibodies during treatment (TE ADAs). While the ADA+ status was comparable at baseline, the post-baseline 
TE ADA+ status was considerably increased with TZP vs. comparator; around 50% of the study participants in 
phase  3  developed  TE  ADA.  Among  the  TE  ADA+  patients,  most  of  them  (72.3%)  developed  persistent 
antibodies. In 15.8% of these patients, transient antibodies were found; the remainder was uncertain according 
to the applicant’s criteria used for definition of persistence. Although there was a tendency to slightly lower 
TZP  clearance  with  higher  ADA  titres,  the  small  number  of  patients  precludes  firm  conclusions  on  the 
relationship  between  ADA  titres  and  clearance.  A  small  effect  of  ADA  at  reducing  efficacy  of  TZP  cannot  be 
excluded,  but,  due  to  the  small  size,  it  is  not  considered  clinically  relevant.  There  was  a  marked  imbalance 
between  ADA+  and  ADA-  subjects  in  regard  to  the  incidence  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  and  injection  site 
reactions. These conditions mainly occurred in ADA+ patients. As the number of patients with and without TE 
ADA was nearly equal (around 50% TE ADA+), a similar incidence of hypersensitivity and injection site reactions 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 195/212 
 
 
 
would be expected if ADA had no effect. Vice versa, this means that the presence of ADA is responsible for 
several of these reactions so that at least part of the observed hypersensitivity / injection site reactions were 
indeed  related  to  tirzepatide  treatment  via  ADA  formation.  Reassuringly,  most  of  these  reactions  were  not 
serious or severe and were self-limiting. Apparently, patients from Japan are more susceptible to develop TZP 
antibodies during therapy, which may favour the occurrence of hypersensitivity and injection site reactions in 
patients from Japan.  
Analysis of ADA+ patients experiencing hypersensitivity reactions or injection site reactions revealed that in 
most cases (>85%) these patients had ADA of low titre (defined as less than 1:5120). 
The AESI of diabetic retinopathy complications was pre-defined based on previous experience with the GLP1 
agonist  semaglutide.  In  SUSTAIN-6,  a  2-year  CVOT  with  semaglutide  in  patients  with  T2DM  and  a  high 
cardiovascular  risk,  diabetic  retinopathy  complications  occurred  more  frequently  in  patients  treated  with 
semaglutide  (3.0%) compared to placebo (1.8%). This was observed in insulin-treated  patients with known 
diabetic  retinopathy.  No  exclusion  criteria  regarding  retinopathy  were  implemented  in  the  CVOT  for 
semaglutide.  By  contrast,  in  the  phase  3  trials  of  the  semaglutide  programme,  patients  requiring  active 
treatment  for  known  proliferative  retinopathy  or  maculopathy  at  baseline  were  excluded  and  diabetic 
retinopathy was reported in similar proportions of subjects treated with semaglutide (1.7%) and comparators 
(2.0%). Due to exclusion of respective risk patients in the TZP phase 3 program, TZP has not been studied in 
patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring acute therapy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy 
or  diabetic  macular  oedema.  There  is  no  experience  with  tirzepatide  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  with 
uncontrolled or potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, tirzepatide should be used with caution in 
these patients, and regular monitoring should be performed. This is appropriately indicated in the SmPC. In 
the phase 3 studies, the incidence of potential diabetic retinopathy complications was slightly higher for the 
comparator group (0.99%; 22/2223) than for TZP (0.72%; 37/5119). Four TZP-treated subjects (2 retinal vein 
occlusion,  2  retinal  detachment)  in  AS2  experienced  a  serious  or  severe  event  of  a  diabetic  retinopathy 
complication. Worsening of fundoscopic examination (as recorded on eCRF) was noted in 0.35% (18/5119) of 
the tirzepatide-treated subjects and in 0.22% (5/2223) in the comparator group. No SAEs were reported. The 
ongoing  SURPASS  CVOT  will  further  investigate  the  impact  of  TZP  treatment  on  diabetic  retinopathy 
progression. 
AESI “hepatobiliary disorders”: A numerically higher percentage of patients was affected by hepatobiliary TEAEs 
with TZP than with comparator in most phase 3 studies. This imbalance was probably driven by gallbladder 
complications. In the placebo-controlled studies (AS1), the proportion of subjects with gallbladder-related AEs 
was increased for TZP (0.6%) vs. placebo (0%). None of the events were serious or led to study discontinuation. 
In the phase 3 studies (AS2), the incidence of gallbladder-related AEs was 1.1% (n=18) for TZP 5 mg, 1.1% 
for TZP 10 mg (n=19), 0.8% (n=14) for TZP 15 mg and 0.8% (n=17) for comparator. The gallbladder-related 
AEs in the TZP group (n=51) were mainly driven by cholelithiasis (n=30). Sixteen (16) SAEs were reported, of 
which cholecystitis/acute cholecystitis (n=8) and cholelithiasis (n=5) were the most frequently reported SAEs.  
The increased risk of cholelithiasis with TZP is in line with data from other GLP-1 agonists. Cholelithiasis has 
been  included  in  Section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  with  the  frequency  “uncommon”.  Increased  weight  loss  did  not 
increase the risk of cholelithiasis.  
In addition, a rapporteur’s search for gallbladder-related PTs in the phase 3 studies revealed a slightly increased 
occurrence of “gallbladder polyp” with TZP 15 mg as compared to lower TZP doses and control groups in AS2. 
However,  it  is  noted  that  6  of  the  11  patients  affected  in  the  15  mg  group  were  still  in  the  dose  escalation 
phase and 8 of the 11 cases of gallbladder polyp in the 15-mg group occurred in the Japan studies. Literature 
suggests  that  the  prevalence  of  gallbladder  polyps  in  adults  may  be  higher  in  East  Asian  populations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 196/212 
 
 
 
Nevertheless,  the  imbalance  between  TZP-treated  and  comparator  treated  patients  remains  unexplained 
(TZP_ALL:  14  [0.27%]  vs.  pooled  comparator:  1  [0.04%).  It  is  expected  that  gallbladder  imaging  will  be 
performed in upcoming studies (due to the increased probability of cholelithiasis in TZP-treated patients so that 
gallbladder polyps will most likely be detected, possibly allowing a final conclusion on this AE.  
In AS2, a numerically higher percentage of patients in the TZP 15 mg group as compared to lower TZP doses 
reached  a  post-baseline  ALT/AST  category  of  ≥3  x  ULN  and  ≥5  x  ULN.  However,  no  clear  conclusion  on  a 
potential causative role of TZP can be drawn, as some of these patients started already with increased enzyme 
levels at baseline and/or may have had a history of confounding hepatic diseases. Moreover, in some of the 
patients with ALT/AST elevations ≥3 x ULN, the high enzyme levels were only measured once and returned to 
the normal range during the study. Since none of the patients met the criteria for Hy’s law (ALT or AST ≥3 x 
ULN and total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN), it is considered unlikely that TZP has a hepatotoxic effect. TZP may even 
have a beneficial effect on liver function (possibly a consequence of positive metabolic effects), as ALT, AST 
and ALP were more prominently reduced from baseline to week 52 at higher TZP doses as compared to lower 
doses. 
The  malignancy  risk  does  not  appear  to  be  increased  with  TZP  (TZP  vs.  placebo  in  phase  2/3:  1.02%  vs. 
1.60%). However, it is noted that the risk for developing malignancies cannot be fully explored from controlled 
data in the clinical trial program covering rather short observation periods. As discussed above in context of 
thyroid safety, the TZP-mediated elevation of calcitonin may be of concern, although no cases of MTC were 
identified in the clinical programme. Thyroid proliferative C-cell changes in rodents are a known class effect 
following  GLP-1R  activation  by  GLP-1R  agonists  and  increases  in  thyroid  C-cell  tumours  were  identified  in 
rodents treated with TZP. In total, 3 cases of pancreatic cancer occurred, of which 2 were identified in the TZP 
group and 1 in the placebo group. The 2 cases in the TZP group were adjudicated unrelated to TZP treatment. 
However, the number of cases in the TZP program is too low to draw firm conclusions about a TZP-associated 
pancreatic cancer risk.  Thyroid C-cell tumours are included in the RMP as important potential risk in line with 
other GLP-1 agonists on the market. Pancreatic malignancies will be evaluated in further studies. Pancreatic 
malignancy is a potential risk that requires long-term surveillance. 
AESI of major depressive disorder/suicidal ideation or behavior: TZP can cause loss of appetite, nausea and 
vomiting. Since eating might be a short-term compensatory behavior in some patients, which produces positive 
emotions and helps to cope with difficult life situations, it is conceivable that the gastrointestinal and appetite-
reducing effects of TZP may precipitate or worsen depressive episodes in predisposed patients. It is noted that 
in AS2, TZP 15 mg was associated with more depressions than the 5 mg and 10 mg dose. Even when some of 
the affected patients may have been pre-disposed (e.g., life situation, previous depressive episodes), it cannot 
be excluded that TZP could have triggered a depressive episode in such persons. It should also be considered 
that depression may be associated with rather unspecific somatic symptoms like fatigue, back pain or sleeping 
problems (“masked” depression). Therefore, the applicant has analysed, whether the 6 PTs dizziness, asthenia, 
fatigue, vertigo, illness or malaise are associated with depression. There seems to be a weak relationship with 
depression, as in 5 patients with depression (all in the TZP group), 2 of the 6 aforementioned AEs were co-
reported.  By  contrast,  no  such  case  was  identified  in  the  comparator  group.  Nevertheless,  depression  was 
generally not reported more frequently with TZP than with comparator.  
In  AS1,  more  patients  in  the  TZP  group  (16.3%)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (9.2%)  shifted  from 
normal/high haemoglobin to low haemoglobin. Haemoglobin values across the tirzepatide groups did not return 
towards baseline at the time of safety follow-up. Similar results were reported for the AS2 dataset. However, 
the between-group difference is very small and large standard deviations preclude a meaningful interpretation

of the results. A large part of the haemoglobin decrease is likely to be caused by the underlying condition of 
T2DM. The incidence of anemia was numerically increased for tirzepatide vs placebo (1.1% vs 0%).  
Deaths and SAEs 
There was no relevant imbalance between TZP dose groups or between TZP and comparator groups with regard 
to deaths. The majority of fatal cases in the TZP group (61%; 25/41) and the comparator group (90%; 35/39) 
occurred in patients from the study GPGM (patients with increased CV risk and/or impaired renal function).  
Special groups 
As described above for immunogenicity, hypersensitivity reactions, injection site reactions and increase in pulse 
rate, patients from Japan appear to be more susceptible to TZP AEs. This was confirmed by an analysis of the 
most common TEAEs by geographic region in AS2, revealing more GI AEs in patients from Japan and from Asia 
(excluding Japan) as compared to other regions.  
A detailed treatment-by-subgroup interaction analysis of dataset AS1 revealed no relevant interactions.  
Regarding  AEs  by  age  category,  the  applicant  has  provided  the  required  table  with  an  analysis  of  the  TZP-
treated patients in phase 2/3 safety analysis set AS3. Moreover, the applicant has presented a corresponding 
analysis for AS2, including a comparison with the pooled comparator groups and differentiating between TZP 
doses. Due to the low number of subjects aged ≥85 years, it is virtually impossible to draw reliable conclusions 
on tolerability of TZP in this age group.  
The  applicant  has  provided  an  AE  analysis  in  different  subgroups,  including  gender,  race/ethnicity,  baseline 
BMI and hepatic function. AEs were also analysed by weight reduction at study end. There were some numerical 
differences in the AE frequencies of these subgroups and conditions, but overall the analyses gave no hint for 
concern in any group or condition. 
No specific issues were identified with regard to patients with renal or hepatic impairment. However, it is 
noted that long-term clinical data are limited for patients with hepatic impairment. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Although TZP is a dual agonist of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-
1  (GLP-1)  receptors,  its  safety  profile  strongly  resembles  the  safety  profile  of  GLP1  receptor  agonists. 
Specifically, the rate of gastrointestinal adverse events was dose-dependently higher with TZP compared with 
placebo. Among the subjects that experienced ≥1 GI event, more subjects in the TZP groups dose-dependently 
discontinued treatment permanently compared with placebo (up to 15% in the TZP 15 mg group). Moreover, 
serum  amylase  and  lipase  increased  with  TZP  treatment.  Furthermore,  similar  to  GLP1  agonists, 
hypoglycaemias only occurred in combination with other glucose-lowering drugs, and TZP lowers blood pressure 
and  dose-dependently  increases  pulse  rate  (up  to  5.2  beats/minute  for  15  mg  TZP  compared  to  1.0 
beats/minute with placebo). 
However, it appears that unlike pure GLP1 receptor agonists, TZP increases calcitonin, and it is currently not 
clear, whether this may also be associated with C cell hyperplasia. No cases of MTC were identified across the 
phase 2 and 3 clinical studies; however, the risk for developing MTC cannot be fully explored from controlled 
data in the clinical trial program covering rather short observation periods. In non-clinical studies, thyroid C-
cell tumour responses were identified in rodents, in line with what has been reported for other long-acting GLP-
1 agonists. 
About  50%  of  TZP-treated  patients  developed  antibodies,  of  which  about  4%  were  positive  for  neutralising 
antibodies against TZP activity on the GIPR and GLP-1 receptors, respectively. Most of the affected patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 198/212 
 
 
 
developed persistent treatment-emergent antibodies. Injection site reactions were dose-dependently increased 
for  tirzepatide  5  mg.  A  majority  of  the  injection  site  reactions  were  identified  in  subjects  that  developed 
antibodies. 
Worsening of fundoscopic examination results of diabetic retinopathy was noted in 0.35% of the tirzepatide-
treated  subjects  and  in  0.22%  in  the  comparator  group.  TZP  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  non-
proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring acute therapy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or diabetic macular 
oedema.  There  is  no  experience  with  TZP  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  with  uncontrolled  or  potentially 
unstable diabetic retinopathy. This is appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
The cardiovascular meta-analysis excludes an excessive cardiovascular risk. However, a cardiovascular benefit 
has not been demonstrated yet, since the completion of SURPASS-CVOT is projected for 2025. Thus, TZP can 
only be approved for glycaemic control in T2DM based on the dossier submitted.

The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 0.5 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 13.05.2022. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Mounjaro (tirzepatide) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Tirzepatide was proposed to be used in the following type 2 diabetes mellitus indication (wording initially 
proposed by the Applicant): 
Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to 
diet and exercise 
‒ 
‒ 
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications 
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.  
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control, weight and cardiovascular 
events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.   
The indication wording has been modified throughout the procedure and the final approvable wording is 
provided in section 3.7.3. 
Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
receptor agonist which is administered subcutaneously once-weekly. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Diabetes affects approximately 463 million adults worldwide, with T2DM accounting for approximately 90% of 
all diabetes worldwide (IDF 2019). Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by a complex pathophysiology 
that causes chronic hyperglycaemia which, if left untreated or inadequately managed, can result in long-term 
damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs, including the heart, kidneys, and eyes, as well as blood 
vessels and nerves (Alam et al. 2014). Arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity all contribute to the 
development of chronic complications of T2DM (Van Gaal et al. 2006; ADA 2021e). Most subjects with T2D 
are overweight or obese, which is important in the aetiology as it increases insulin resistance and leads to 
persistent hyperglycaemia. The pathogenesis is seemingly heterogeneous and also involves environmental, 
lifestyle, and genetic components. All of these factors contribute to chronic hyperglycaemia which, if left 
untreated, is associated with β-cell failure and increased risk of long-term micro- and macrovascular 
complications. The typical presentation of diabetes includes polyuria and polydipsia. However, many patients 
with T2D are asymptomatic and are diagnosed with screening or general investigations of aspecific 
complaints like fatigue. The diagnosis is made by measurement of hyperglycaemia. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The guidelines of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the American Diabetes 
Association (ADA) for treatment of T2D have been developed in cooperation and are widely agreed. The 
major steps recommended for managing type 2 diabetes are lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. For 
glycaemic control, primarily metformin, other non-insulin anti-diabetic agents and finally insulin are used, 
alone or in combination. Treatment is individualized to the individual patient’s glycaemic target (for example, 
HbA1c <7.0%) and co-morbidities (for example, renal insufficiency), and risks of adverse effects (for 
example, increased risk of hypoglycaemia, body weight gain) (Pfeiffer and Klein 2014; Inzucchi et al. 2015; 
Davies et al. 2018; Buse et al. 2020; ADA 2021d). Besides anti-glycaemic therapy, antihypertensive, 
antithrombotic and lipid lowering treatments might be indicated to avoid other associated co-morbidities (e.g. 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 202/212 
 
 
 
hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia) and macrovascular complications (MI, stroke). Recently, SGLT-2 
inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs have shown not only improvements in glycaemic control but also a reduction in 
body weight and CV events in patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk. There is no unmet medical 
need for tirzepatide. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The efficacy data supporting this application are from the five global pivotal phase 3 studies. Tirzepatide was 
compared with placebo or active comparators in a population of patients with T2DM, representing a broad 
range of patients who could be treated in clinical practice. Tirzepatide was assessed as monotherapy and as 
add-on treatment to OAMs or basal insulin. Key design elements are outlined in the table below.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Tirzepatide showed statistically superior and clinically relevant reductions from baseline in HbA1c compared 
with placebo, a GLP-1 receptor agonist (semaglutide 1mg), and basal insulin (insulin degludec, insulin

glargine). Basal insulin was titrated to a sufficiently high dose to achieve full antihyperglycaemic potential; 1 
mg semaglutide is currently the highest semaglutide dose available. 
For the treatment-regimen estimand, irrespective of adherence to study drug or initiation of another 
antihyperglycaemic medication, the mean changes in HbA1c from baseline to primary endpoint ranged from 
tirzepatide 5 mg: -1.75% (Study GPGK, 40 weeks) to -2.11% (Study GPGI, 40 weeks), tirzepatide 10 mg: -
1.71% [Study GPGK, 40 weeks] to -2.40% [Study GPGI, 40 weeks], and tirzepatide 15 mg: -1.69% [Study 
GPGK, 40 weeks] to -2.41% [Study GPGM, 52 weeks]. Results for the efficacy estimand (study drug was 
taken as intended without use of rescue) results were consistent. Sustainability of the HbA1c lowering effect 
over 104 weeks was demonstrated. 
Glycaemic benefit was further reflected by significantly greater proportions of patients achieving HbA1c 
targets of <7.0%, ≤6.5%, and <5.7%, the latter corresponding to normoglycemia, compared to placebo and 
all active comparators studied. The vast majority of patients who achieved a glycaemic goal of <5.7% did so 
without developing hypoglycaemia (93.6% to 100% of patients not on a background of insulin glargine; 
85.9% of patients on a background of insulin glargine). 
FSG and 7-point SMBG results further supported the effect of tirzepatide on HbA1c. Glycaemic control 
seemed to be improved throughout the day, including post-prandial glycaemic excursions. For the treatment-
regimen estimand, the mean changes in FSG from baseline to primary endpoint ranged from -tirzepatide 5 
mg: -39.6 mg/dL [Study GPGK, 40 weeks] to -58.2 mg/dL [Study GPGI, 52 weeks], -tirzepatide 10 mg: -
39.8 mg/dL [Study GPGK, 40 weeks] to -64.0 mg/dL [Study GPGI, 40 weeks], and -tirzepatide 15 mg: -38.6 
mg/dL [Study GPGK, 40 weeks] to -62.6 mg/dL [Study GPGI, 40 weeks]. 
Further, Tirzepatide led to significantly more time spent in the euglycaemic range (71-140mg/dL), as 
demonstrated through continuous glucose monitoring; this was not achieved at the expense of increased 
hypoglycaemia. 
Tirzepatide demonstrated superior and clinically relevant (body weight loss >5% from baseline weight) 
reductions in body weight in all phase 3 studies compared with placebo, semaglutide and basal insulin 
(insulin degludec and insulin glargine): tirzepatide 5 mg: -5.4 kg (Study GPGI, 40 weeks) to -7.6 kg (Study 
GPGL, 40 weeks), tirzepatide 10 mg: -7.0 kg (Study GPGK, 40 weeks) to -9.6 kg (Study GPGH, 52 weeks), 
and tirzepatide 15 mg: -7.8 kg (Study GPGK, 40 weeks) to -11.3 kg (Study GPGH, 52 weeks). 
Reductions in body weight were observed regardless of concomitant therapy with SU or insulin which are 
known to promote weight gain. Of note, weight loss did not plateau by the end of the 40 to 52 week 
treatment period. A reduction of the volume of visceral adipose tissue, and the volume of abdominal 
subcutaneous adipose tissue, as demonstrated in the MRI substudy, showed that weight loss was related to 
loss of fat mass. 
Likewise, other cardiometabolic measures (waist circumference, lipid parameters, blood pressure, hepatic fat 
content) improved with tirzepatide. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are uncertainties with respect to the beneficial effect in subgroups. Weight loss exceeded the 
observational period in the phase 3 studies. Hence, some patients may struggle to keep their weight during 
chronic therapy. Further analyses had been requested in the subgroup of patients with baseline BMI between 
23 and 24.9 kg/m2 (from studies GPGK and GPGI, as well as from the supportive study GPGO). These 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 204/212 
 
 
 
subgroup analyses showed maintained efficacy and no significant safety concerns in patients with BMI ≥23 
and 24.9 kg/m2 at baseline. A total of nine patients from studies GPGK (n=478), GPGI (n=475), and GPGO 
(n=636), which included seven patients with BMI ≥23 and <25 kg/m2 at baseline, had a BMI ≤18.5 kg/m2 at 
the end of the study (Week 40 and Week 52, respectively), which is considered a low number. In clinical 
practice, the risk of underweight may even be lower, as the treating physician will not have to adhere to an 
assigned dose and will adjust the dose of tirzepatide according to the therapeutic needs and the tolerability of 
each patient.  
Overall, the data do not justify implementing a BMI cut-off for the use of tirzepatide in the SmPC or a 
warning in the SmPC; this issue was resolved by adding weight loss as adverse event in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. 
There was some uncertainty as regards the benefit in patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease. 
Except for study GPGM which had no exclusion criterion based on eGFR, the phase 3 studies had a lower limit 
of eGFR of 30 ml/min/1.73m2. The Applicant submitted a by-participant listing of the 32 participants enrolled 
in Study I8F-MC-GPGM who had a baseline eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (11 treated with 5 mg, 2 on 10 mg, 3 
on 15 mg, 16 treated with glargine). Efficacy seemed not to be lower in this subset compared to the overall 
study population, both with regard to HbA1c and weight. No unexpected safety issues occurred in these 
patients and no deterioration in renal function (eGFR) was noted. Results from the PK study GPGG showed a 
PK largely independent of renal function after administration of a single subcutaneous dose of 5 mg 
tirzepatide. Based on these data no dose adjustment of tirzepatide in patients with CKD stage 4 and 5 seems 
warranted. However, the applicant acknowledges the limited phase 3 data in patients with stage 4 and 5 
kidney disease and has proposed the addition of a sentence in section 4.2 of the SmPC that “Experience with 
the use of tirzepatide in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD is limited. Caution should be 
exercised when treating these patients with tirzepatide.” 
Patients with hepatic impairment were excluded from the phase 3 studies. A clinical pharmacology study 
(Study GPGQ) was conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. No clinically relevant effects of hepatic 
impairment were observed on the PK of tirzepatide in this study. The applicant concluded that patients with 
hepatic impairment do not require different dosing regimens (and inserted a respective wording in section 4.2 
of the SmPC); this needed to be further justified as long term clinical data in patients with hepatic 
impairment do not exist The Applicant pointed to published clinical data suggesting that tirzepatide may lead 
to improvements in liver-related clinical markers: a post-hoc analysis of a phase 2 study showed 
improvement in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-related biomarkers after 26 weeks of treatment with tirzepatide 
(Hartman et al. 2020) and in a substudy of the Phase 3 SURPASS-3 study, patients treated with tirzepatide 
had a significantly greater decrease in liver fat content at Week 52 compared to insulin degludec (Gastaldelli 
et al. 2021).  
However, the applicant has acknowledged the lack of clinical data following the use of tirzepatide in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment in the phase 3 studies and has proposed a revision to the text in section 4.2 
which adequately reflects the lack of data. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile for TZP is overall similar to what is known for the class of GLP-1 agonists. Gastrointestinal 
AEs  were  dose-dependently  increased  with  TZP-treatment.  More  subjects  in  the  TZP  groups  discontinued 
treatment permanently (up to 15% for TZP 15 mg) than for placebo. About 50% of the TZP-treated patients 
developed  antibodies  (<5%  positive  for  neutralising  antibodies),  the  majority  of  which  were  persistent 
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 205/212 
 
 
 
antibodies.  Injection  site  reactions  were  dose-dependently  increased  for  TZP,  of  which  most  cases  were 
identified  in  subjects  that  developed  antibodies.  Pancreatic  enzymes  (serum  amylase  and  lipase)  were 
increased for TZP, which, however, was in general not associated with pancreatitis.  
Pancreatitis occurred slightly more frequently with TZP than with comparator in the phase 2/3 program (0.24 
vs. 0.17%). Moreover, unlike pure GLP1 receptor agonists, TZP appears to slightly increase serum calcitonin. 
TZP does not exert major negative effects on renal and hepatic function.  
TZP  increased  the  frequency  of  general  adverse  events  like  dizziness,  asthenia,  fatigue,  vertigo,  illness  and 
malaise.   
Discontinuation from study drug due to GI AEs was <5%. During the initial dose escalation phase (0-24 weeks), 
the majority of discontinuations was due to GI AEs. After week 24, despite reduced frequency, GI AEs remain 
an important factor for discontinuations, specifically at higher TZP doses. 
The data suggest that the presence of ADA is responsible for several of the hypersensitivity- and injection site 
reactions, most of which were not serious or severe and were self-limiting. The influence of TZP antibodies on 
TZP clearance and efficacy seems negligible. 
There was no relevant imbalance between TZP dose groups or between TZP and comparator groups with regard 
to deaths.  
In several instances (e.g., GI TEAEs, increase in pulse rate, hypersensitivity reactions, post-baseline TE ADA+), 
patients from Japan were more sensitive to TZP-associated TEAEs than patients from other parts of the world, 
which may partly be due to a higher TZP dose relative to body weight.  
Hypoglycaemia  events  were  low  with  TZP  and  mainly  occurred  in  combination  with  other  glucose-lowering 
background therapies like insulin or OADs.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Some AEs (including typical AEs associated with GLP1 receptor agonism) occurred more frequently with TZP 
as  compared  to  GLP1  receptor  agonist  comparators  (semaglutide  1  mg  and  dulaglutide  0.75  mg).  This  is 
probably  due  to  a  relatively  low  GLP1  receptor  agonist  dose  as  compared  to  TZP,  which  precludes  on  par 
comparison of TZP and GLP1 receptor agonists.  
According to the applicant, no C-cell hyperplasia occurred during the study program. However, the rapporteur 
considers  the  employed  diagnostic  methods  insufficient  to  exclude  C-cell  hyperplasia,  which  is  specifically 
emphasized  in  light  of  the  serum  calcitonin  increase  associated  with  TZP  treatment.  No  MTC  cases  were 
observed in the TZP clinical programme, but the duration of the clinical studies does not allow identification of 
long-latency events, such as thyroid cancer. 
Regarding pancreatitis, many of the investigator-reported cases of pancreatitis were not confirmed by the CEC. 
Two cases of pancreatic cancer were reported in TZP-treated patients of the phase 2/3 study program, both 
being adjudicated unrelated to TZP treatment. Based on the current data that are derived from a clinical study 
program with only limited duration, the risk for long-latency events like pancreatic cancer cannot be assessed. 
The applicant has not presented data on patients with a history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic 
maculopathy,  or  nonproliferative  diabetic  retinopathy  that  required  acute  treatment,  as  such  patients  were 
excluded in the phase 3 programme. However, it is to be expected that the ongoing dedicated addendum

Page 206/212 
 
 
 
study to SURPASS-CVOT (investigating the impact of TZP on diabetic retinopathy progression) will allow a more 
reliable estimation of the TZP-associated retinopathy risk.  
The TZP-induced increase of the frequency of general adverse events like dizziness, asthenia, fatigue, vertigo, 
illness and malaise seems to weakly correlate with depression, but the number of cases is too low and no major 
imbalance with regard to depression is observed between TZP- and comparator group. 
Due to limited data, no firm conclusion can be drawn on long-term hepatic safety. There is only limited data 
on patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. It seems that the PTs “renal cyst” and “gallbladder polyp” occurred 
with slightly increased frequency in TZP-treated patients, but due to confounding factors (background medical 
conditions) and the low number of cases, a clear causative role of TZP cannot be established.  
No data on patients with severe GI disease are available.

Strength of evidence  
•  Phase 3 studies were adequately 
powered to show superior reductions 
in HbA1c and body weight in the 
target population: patients across 
the disease continuum with varying 
disease duration, background 
therapies, comorbidities, and 
complications. 
•  Participants encouraged to remain in 
studies up to primary endpoint visit, 
whether or not they adhered to 
study treatment, resulting in high 
retention rates and minimal missing 
data 
•  In all phase 3 studies, all 3 TZP 
doses statistically significantly 
reduced HbA1c and body weight 
relative to comparators using both 
the treatment-regimen estimand and 
efficacy estimand. 
•  TZP was efficacious in reducing 
HbA1c and body weight across all 
subgroups evaluated, including age, 
gender, baseline BMI, and 
background oral diabetes meds.  
•  Higher percentages of patients 
achieving HbA1c targets (<7%, 
≤6.5%, <5.7%), and weight loss 
targets (≥10% and ≥15%) than with 
comparators. 
•  FSG and 7-point SMBG support 
beneficial effect of tirzepatide on 
glycaemic control throughout the 
day, including postprandial 
glycaemic excursions. 
•  TZP improved waist circumference, 
lipid parameters, and blood pressure 
in all global Phase 3 studies 
•  Glycaemic control was achieved 
without clinically significant or 
severe hypoglycaemia for most 
tirzepatide-treated patients: for 
those achieving HbA1c <5.7% at the 
primary endpoint, 93.6% to 100% of 
tirzepatide-treated patients not on 
background of insulin and 85.9% of 
patients on background of insulin. 
Limitations and uncertainties  
•  Limitation: no weight loss claim. 
Therefore, reference to “weight” in 
section 4.1 of the SmPC not 
acceptable.

in Phase 2 and 3 studies (4833.1

•  Safety profile of TZP was mostly 
consistent with the known safety 
profiles of GLP-1 receptor agonists.  
•  Acute pancreatitis showed a slight 
imbalance between TZP and 
comparator. GLP1 receptor agonists 
can increase pancreatic enzymes, 
but this is mostly not associated 
with pancreatitis.  
•  GI events, the most common AEs 
for TZP, were more frequent during 
the dose-escalation period and were 
mostly mild to moderate in severity, 
and discontinuation from study drug 
due to GI AEs was <5%. 
•  Hypoglycaemia events were low 
with TZP and dependend mostly on 
background therapy. 
Limitations and uncertainties  
•  No data on patients with a history 
of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 
diabetic maculopathy, or 
nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy 
that required acute treatment. 
•  No data on patients with severe GI 
disorders. 
•  Limited data on patients with eGFR 
<30 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
•  TZP caused slight increases in 
serum calcitonin. A potential risk of 
C cell hyperplasia could not be 
excluded.  
•  Duration of the clinical studies does 
not allow identification of long-
latency events, such as thyroid 
cancer.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most important effects observed are (in order of importance), superior and clinically meaningful reduction 
from  baseline  in  HbA1c  compared  to  placebo  and  to  active  comparators,  significantly  higher  proportions  of 
responders to HbA1c targets of (>7%, ≤6.5% and <5.7%= normoglycaemia), improvement of other glycaemic 
measures (FSG, 7-point SMPG, increased time in range), achievement of normoglycemia without a significant 
increase  in  the  rate  of  hypoglycaemias,  weight  reduction,  improvement  of  PRO  scores,  and  improvement  of 
other  parameters  related  to  cardiometabolic  health  (reduction  of  visceral  fat  mass,  reduction  of  hepatic  fat 
content, blood pressure, lipids). 
The evidence of efficacy was considered statistically convincing and there is good concordance among efficacy 
endpoints  and  among  subgroups.  Some  uncertainties  with  respect  to  efficacy  in  subgroups  (patients  with 
hepatic impairment, stage 4 and 5 CKD, and normal weight patients) have been addressed by a revised wording 
in the SPC. Their impact on the overall benefit of tirzepatide is considered small. 
Importance of unfavourable effects: 
Pancreatitis has been assigned the highest importance, because it may lead to severe complications.  
The PTs “renal cyst” and “gallbladder polyp” are considered important, but a causal relation to TZP is difficult 
to conclude, based on the currently available data.  
The importance of the systemic TEAEs dizziness, asthenia, fatigue, vertigo, illness is considered low, as they 
only  weakly  correlate  with  depression  and  there  seems  to  be  no  association  with  dehydration  and/or 
hypotension.  
Although gastrointestinal TEAEs belong to the most common unfavourable effects, they are considered of minor 
importance, as they are mostly occurring temporarily and can be controlled by dose adjustment. 
The effects of TZP on blood pressure and heart rate are also considered to be of minor importance, as they are 
well  known  from  other  GLP1  receptor  agonists,  and  the  CV  meta-analysis  suggests  no  increased  risk  of 
cardiovascular death.  
Increase in pancreatic enzymes is deemed of minor importance, as it was not associated with pancreatitis in 
most of the cases and is an adverse event well known from established GLP1 receptor agonists. 
Hypersensitivity- and injection site reactions are considered to be of low importance, since they were mostly 
not  serious  or  severe  and  were  self-limiting.  Likewise,  hypoglycaemia  events  are  considered  to  be  of  low 
importance as they rarely occurred with TZP, mainly in combination with other glucose-lowering background 
therapies like insulin or OADs.  
The relevance of the mild increases in serum calcitonin is unclear and will be followed up post-marketing. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
For the key benefits of glycaemic control and body weight reductions, tirzepatide was superior to placebo and 
all active comparators, including the GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide. Glucose control with all tirzepatide 
doses could be achieved with only minimally increased risk of hypoglycaemia.  
Assessment report  
EMA/791310/2022 
Page 210/212 
 
 
 
The safety and tolerability profile of tirzepatide was characterized in a patient population aligned with the target 
population for up to 104 weeks (in the longest study) and is considered acceptable. As expected, similar to the 
GLP-1 receptor agonist class, the most common AEs were GI-related. For the key risk of acute pancreatitis, 
adjudication-confirmed cases were low in frequency, but a slight imbalance was observed between TZP- and 
comparator-treated patients. The aetiology and potential long-term implications of the observed increases in 
serum calcitonin levels are not clear. Post-marketing follow-up is therefore necessary.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Quality: 
The major objections concerning the missing Notified Body Opinion for the prefilled pen, drug product 
manufacturing process validation data and risk evaluation report for nitrosamines have been solved. 
Clinical: 
Initial MO with respect to the indication wording, evolution of indication wording throughout the procedure: 
please refer to section 2.6.7 of this report. 
The following wording is considered approvable: 
Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes 
mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise 
‒ 
‒ 
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications 
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.  
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control, and the populations studied, see 
sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.   
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Mounjaro is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Mounjaro is favourable in the following indication(s):

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major European public health challenge, with a prevalence of 0.4-3.5% in 
different EU member states. It is the most common single cause of liver transplantation in the Union.  
HCV is divided into six major genotypes and numerous subtypes, which are based on phylogenetic relationship. 
Genotype 1 is the most common genotype in Europe, comprising approximately 70 % of infections. Genotype 3 
is second most common, followed by genotype 2. Genotype 4 is predominant in Egypt, the nation in the world 
with the highest documented HCV prevalence. Genotypes 5 and -6 are uncommon in Europe and the US, but are 
more  common  in  South  Africa  and  South-East  Asia,  respectively  (Simmonds  et  al,  Hepatology  2005).  HCV 
genotype does not clearly impact the rate of disease progression. Treatment response, however, with available 
regimens, differs between genotypes. 
The goal of antiviral therapy against HCV is to reach sustained virological response (SVR), which is traditionally 
defined as the absence of quantifiable virus in plasma at least 24 weeks after the end of therapy. However, most 
relapses  occur  within  4  weeks  of  treatment  discontinuation,  and  a  98-99%  concordance  has  been  shown 
between absence of quantifiable virus 12 weeks after therapy, and SVR24 (Florian et al, AASLD 2011). Therefore 
the absence of measurable virus 12 weeks post end of treatment (SVR12) is presently accepted by European 
and US regulators as the primary endpoint in clinical trials. Though occasional late relapses occur, in general the 
durability of SVR has been amply demonstrated (see e.g., Ng and Saab, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2011). 
Up until the European commission approval of sofosbuvir, all approved therapeutic regimens for hepatitis C virus 
infection contained an interferon. For the treatment of genotype 1 infection, the addition of either one of the NS 
3/4A  protease  inhibitors  telaprevir  or  boceprevir,  approved  in  2011,  was  considered  standard-of-care.  For 
genotypes other than -1 there were no direct-acting antivirals (DAA) approved, bi-therapy with pegIFN/RBV 
being  the  standard.  Interferon-based  therapies  are  associated  with  potentially  serious  side  effects  that  are 
important in limiting real life effectiveness. These include a risk of hepatic decompensation and septicaemia in 
patients  with  advanced  liver  disease,  as  well  as  bone  marrow  suppression.  Also,  there  are  psychiatric  side 
effects such as depression, which considerably limits eligibility to treatment in the target population (see e.g., 
Bini et al, Am J Gastroenterol 2005). 
Recent years have seen a very rapid drug development for hepatitis C. There are numerous further drugs in the 
pipeline, and the anticipation is that within short interferon-free therapies with very high antiviral efficacy will be 
approved and recommended for most or all patients with hepatitis C, regardless of genotype and clinical status. 
The applicant has developed an IFN-free regimen containing 3 DAAs with distinct mechanisms of action and 
non-overlapping resistance profiles for the treatment of chronic HCV infection: 
•  ABT-450 is a nonstructural protein [NS] 3/4A protease inhibitor, which is necessary for the proteolytic 
cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B 
proteins) and is essential for viral replication.  ABT-450 is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 
(CYP) 3A4 and is dosed with ritonavir (r), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer  
in  order  to  achieve  efficacious  exposures  (the  combination  of  ABT-450  and  ritonavir  is  denoted 
ABT-450/r);

•  Ombitasvir (ABT-267) is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, which is essential for viral replication; 
•  Dasabuvir (ABT-333) is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded 
by the NS5B gene. 
Exviera contains dasabuvir. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as immediate release film-coated tablets containing 250 mg of dasabuvir (as 
sodium salt monohydrate) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: microcrystalline cellulose (E460(i)), lactose monohydrate, copovidone, croscarmellose 
sodium, colloidal anhydrous silica (E551), magnesium stearate (E470b), polyvinyl alcohol (E1203), titanium 
dioxide (E171), polyethylene glycol 3350, talc, iron oxide yellow (E172), iron oxide red (E172) and iron oxide 
black (E172), as described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The product is available in in clear Polyvinylchloride/Polyethylene/Polychlorotrifluoroethene – Aluminium 
blisters (PVC/PE/PCTFE-Al), as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance dasabuvir sodium monohydrate is sodium 3-(3-tert-butyl-4- 
-methoxy-5-{6-[(methylsulfonyl) amino] naphthalen-2-yl} phenyl)-2,6-dioxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-ide 
hydrate (1:1:1), corresponding to the molecular formula C 26H26N3O5SNa.H2O and has a relative molecular 
mass 493.57 (free acid), or 533.57 (salt, hydrate). It has the following structure: 
The structure of the active substance has been confirmed by mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, 1H- and 
13C-NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, all of which support the chemical structure.  
Dasabuvir sodium monohydrate appears as a white to pale yellow to pink, non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. 
It is practically insoluble in 0.1 N HCl pH 1, slightly soluble in water and very slightly soluble in methanol. The 
solubility of the free acid of dasabuvir in various pH buffer solutions is pH dependent and ranges from 0.13 to 
910 μg/ml. The dissociation constants of dasabuvir sodium were determined to be pK1 = 8.2 and pK2 = 9.2.  
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014

It does not show stereoisomerism. As a result of polymorphic screen studies several crystal forms have been 
identified; five of them are most relevant to the proposed manufacture. The active substance is consistently 
manufactured as monosodium salt monohydrate (Form I), which is also the thermodynamically stable form. 
The active substance is packaged in material which complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured in six chemical synthetic steps followed by salt formation. The proposed 
starting and raw materials used in the synthesis and intermediates are well-defined and controlled by suitable 
methods  and  specifications.  The  synthesis  has  been  described  in  sufficient  detail  and  critical  process 
parameters,  yields  and  in-process  controls  (IPCs)  have  been  reported  and  are  considered  satisfactory.  The 
desired  active  substance  particle  size  is  ensured  by  sufficient  IPC  of  the  critical  wet  milling  step  and  by 
controlling  the  critical  process  parameter  (stoichiometry)  of  salt  formation.  Sufficient  evidence  has  been 
presented that the desired polymorph is consistently manufactured. 
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  is  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on 
chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  and  degradation  products  have  been 
characterised and toxicologically qualified as appropriate.  
Any potential genotoxic impurities (GTIs) and their precursors are controlled through material attributes (input 
materials and intermediates) and processing conditions, or decompose in-process due to their reactivity under 
the reaction conditions. The overall control strategy including any GTIs is therefore considered satisfactory. 
The proposed commercial process has been used in clinical trials and in the manufacture of the primary stability 
batches. Two slightly different processes have been used in batches for earlier clinical trials; differences have 
been presented but raised no concerns regarding the comparability of the active substance quality.  
Process  validation  will  be  performed  as  per  the  presented  and  agreed  protocol  on  three  consecutive 
production-scale batches at the commercial manufacturing facilities. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes appropriate  tests  and  limits  for:  appearance  and  colour  (visual), 
clarity and colour of solution (Ph. Eur.), identity (dasabuvir: IR, HPLC; Na counterion: Ph. Eur.), crystal form 
(X-ray powder diffraction), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC) and microbiological quality 
(Ph. Eur.). 
The  omission  of  certain  tests  from  the  specification  of  the  active  substance  such  as  control  of  GTIs,  some 
residual  solvents,  heavy  metals,  particle  size,  crystal  morphology  and  water  content  has  been  adequately 
justified on the basis of upstream control (IPCs), batch analysis data and physicochemical properties of the 
substance. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data for 22 batches manufactured using the proposed commercial process have been provided. 
In addition, batch analysis results of another 15 batches manufactured using the two slightly different processes 
used  in  early  development  were  also  presented.  Additional  characterisation  details  were  provided  for  these 
batches on heavy metals, optical microscopy, particle shape, crystallinity, particle size, water content, sodium 
content and additional residual solvents. 
The submitted batch analysis data confirm that the manufacture is sufficiently robust and provide reassurance 
that the process yields active substance of consistent quality, complying with the designated specification.

Stability 
Stability data on four commercial size batches of active substance stored in the intended commercial package 
for up to nine months under long term conditions at 25 °C/60% RH and for up to six months under accelerated 
conditions at 40 °C/75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. In addition, one full scale batch was 
stored at 50 °C/75% RH. In addition, data from another three smaller than commercial scale batches from a 
different site used in development were also presented for up to 12 months under long term conditions at 25 
°C/60% RH a and for up to six months under accelerated conditions at 40 °C/75% RH. The batches were stored 
in  the  packaging  configuration  intended  for  marketing.  The  stability  parameters  tested  were  appearance, 
identification, assay, related substances and microbial controls. Crystal form and water content were monitored 
on  the  three  smaller  scale  batches.  The  methods  used  were  the  same  as  those  used  for  release  and  are 
considered stability indicating. 
No significant changes were observed in any of the monitored parameters through the stability study period, 
compared to the initial values, for any of the tested storage conditions. The commercial site batches were found 
comparable to the smaller batches from the different site. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Furthermore, the active 
substance was exposed to acid, base, oxidation, heat, heat with moisture and light (exposure to high intensity 
UV light) stress conditions. Results for the stress stability samples indicated that dasabuvir sodium is potentially 
susceptible  to  base  and  oxidative  degradation,  and  to  a  much  lesser  extent,  acid  and  ultraviolet  radiation 
degradation whereas it appears stable to heat, heat with moisture and light stress conditions.  
Finally, the data generated at 50 °C/75% RH support temperature excursions during shipping of up to 50 °C for 
1 month.  
Based on presented stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage conditions for dasabuvir sodium are 
acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Pharmaceutical development was conducted in line with recommendations in ICH Q8/9/10. The approach to the 
pharmaceutical development can be considered a mix of the traditional and more enhanced approach, although 
no design space or PAT tools are utilised and multivariate experiments were only performed to understand the 
manufacturing process.  
The objective of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a product with a quality target product profile 
(QTPP) defined as follows: 250 mg film-coated immediate release tablet, less than 1000 mg total tablet weight 
and  of  acceptable  appearance,  meeting  the  relevant  compendial  requirements  for  this  pharmaceutical  form 
comprised of known excipients and stable in different climatic zones. Following the definition of the QTPP an 
initial  risk  assessment  was  performed  upon  selection  of  the  commercial  formulation  which  led  to  the 
identification of formulation attributes and manufacturing process parameters that could potentially impact final 
product quality. Subsequently, using design of experiments, statistical analysis, simulations and mathematical 
models and the relationship of the material attributes and process parameters to the drug product CQAs were 
defined. After determining the CQAs, critical process parameters (CPPs), and in-process controls (IPCs), the 
control strategy was determined to ensure final product quality and manufacturability. A final risk assessment 
was  then  completed  to  demonstrate  risks  previously  identified  are  mitigated  using  the  proposed  control 
Assessment report

Page 10/119 
  
  
strategy. Taking into account the QTTP, the CQAs identified for dasabuvir tablets are: identity, purity, assay, 
degradation  products,  uniformity  of  dosage  units,  description  (appearance),  water  content,  dissolution  and 
microbiological quality. 
Dasabuvir  free  acid  is  a  weak  acid  with  relatively  low  solubility  at  bio-relevant  pH  values.  Consequently,  a 
crystalline sodium salt in the form of a monohydrate having a higher apparent aqueous solubility and a much 
faster dissolution rate was selected for product development. The permeability by Caco-2 assay indicates it is 
Class  II  (low  solubility  and  high  permeability)  compound  according  to  the  Biopharmaceutics  Classification 
Systems (BCS). 
The particle size range which is acceptable for product manufacture and clinical performance was defined; this 
is controlled in the active substance manufacturing process. The choice of all excipients has been satisfactorily 
justified and their function has been adequately described. In addition it has been shown that the crystal form 
of dasabuvir sodium is not changed by the tablet manufacturing process or upon storage. 
An overview of the different formulations used throughout the clinical and formulation development programme 
has  been  provided.  Originally  a  low  strength  capsule  formulation  was  developed  for  Phase I  and  IIa  clinical 
studies. As soon as it was realised that a higher dose would be required, a 400 mg tablet was developed using 
largely the same excipients as the first capsules for the Phase I and II clinical studies. During optimisation of this 
formulation it was possible to reduce the dose form 400 to 250 mg – the proposed strength for marketing. 
Bioequivalence between the proposed commercial optimised 250 mg film coated tablet and the 400 mg Phase II 
tablet  was  confirmed  in  a  bioequivalence  study.  The  tablets  were  further  optimised  to  add  a  cosmetic 
non-functional film coating that has no significant impact on drug release. 
Given the low aqueous solubility of the active substance, a pH 6.8 buffered medium with surfactant is proposed 
as a dissolution method for release testing. Several surfactants at various concentrations were studied before 
selecting a medium with 15 mM cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) able to achieve sink conditions. The 
rotation speed was also optimised to avoid coning.  
The discriminating power of the dissolution method was investigated with regard to the tablet hardness and 
active substance particle size. Although no changes to the dissolution profile were found for the tested wide 
ranges, indicating robust performance, the proposed method was able to discriminate tablets with varying levels 
of binder and disintegrant as well as stability related changes. Therefore the dissolution method is considered 
sufficiently discriminatory. 
A summary of the manufacturing process development history has been presented and a discussion on each 
individual unit operation was provided assessing their impact to content uniformity, uniformity of dosage units, 
appearance,  assay  and  dissolution.  Design  of  experiments  (DoE)  were  utilised  to  define  the  operating 
parameters for the dry granulation and coating steps particularly. 
Exviera film-coated tablets are packaged in polyvinyl chloride/polyethylene/ polychlorotrifluoroethylene blisters 
with aluminium foil lidding (PVC/PE/PCTFE-Al). The material complies with the Ph. Eur. requirements. The choice 
of  the  container  closure  system  is  supported  by  stability  data  and  is  adequate  for  the  intended  use  of  the 
product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014

The  manufacturing  process  for  dasabuvir  tablets  consists  of  the  following  separate  manufacturing  steps: 
blending,  dry  granulation,  blending,  tableting,  and  coating,  followed  by  bulk  and  subsequently  primary 
packaging; it has been described in sufficient detail. The manufacturing process of the finished product follows 
conventional pharmaceutical practices and is therefore considered a standard process. Holding times for bulk 
tablets have been defined and are supported by data. The control strategy was based upon the CPPs, IPCs, raw 
material and final product specifications. The designed control strategy ensures that the manufacturing process 
consistently delivers a product that meets the defined criteria for all CQAs. 
The manufacturing process for Exviera tablets will be validated before commercialisation of the product on three 
consecutive production-scale batches manufactured at the commercial manufacturing facilities in accordance 
with the agreed protocol. 
Overall it is considered that the manufacture is sufficiently robust to provide reassurance that the process 
produces the finished product Exviera 250 mg film-coated tablets of consistent quality, complying with the 
designated specification. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  and  shelf  life  specifications  include  appropriate tests  and  limits  for  appearance 
(visual),  identification  (HPLC,  IR),  assay  (HPLC),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units 
(Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.- HPLC) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.).  
A  statistical  evaluation  for  water  content  showed  the  appropriateness  of  the  specification  limits  for  this 
parameter. Because the microbial risks of this solid oral dosage product are low, testing is only planned until 
additional confirmatory data are obtained. As per ICH Q6A Specifications, Decision Tree #8, based on the results 
of these confirmatory batches (development and commercial ones) meeting the acceptance criteria, the test for 
microbial quality will be removed from the commercial specification and the testing will no longer be applied. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  16  production  scale  batches.  Results  confirm  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three production scale batches of Exviera tablets from the proposed site, stored under long term 
conditions for six months at 30 °C/75%  and under accelerated conditions for six months at 40 °C/75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The same three batches were stress tested at -20 °C, 5 °C, 50 °C, 
and one of them was tested for photostability as per the ICH guideline. An additional batch was exposed to 
oxidative conditions, heat, heat and moisture, and light. 
Three further production scale batches manufactured in a different facility using the same process were studied 
under the same conditions for up to 15 and 9 months respectively. The stability batches were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Parameters tested were: description, assay, dissolution, water content, degradation products, microbiological 
quality and water activity (selected time points). The methods used for stability testing were the same as for 
release and were shown to be stability indicating.  
No meaningful changes were seen in any of the batches tested under long term and accelerated conditions and 
all results remained within specification. The product is not sensitive to light.

In addition to the real time stability data a statistical analysis was performed showing that the assay results 
would be met at the end of the shelf life. 
The open dish study showed that if tablet water content exceeds a certain level, then drug release might not 
meet the acceptance criteria. Therefore an appropriate water content limit has been set for the release and shelf 
life. 
Based on the packaged stability data, statistical analyses, blister permeability water content model and 
interpretation of the open dish stability data, the shelf life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used 
to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant 
material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal 
Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology  
Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, encoded 
by the non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) gene. For a further discussion of the primary pharmacology, see below, 
section on pharmacodynamics.  
Secondary pharmacology 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 13/119 
  
  
In assays including 75 receptors, ion channels and transporters, dasabuvir (0,1-10 μM) showed an inhibition of 
binding  by  >  50%  at  the  V1a  (82%)  receptor,  the  Cl–channel  (109%),  the  A3  receptor  (76%),  the  BZD 
(peripheral,  69%),  the  CCKA  receptor  (78%),  the  5-HT1B  receptor  (60%)  and  the  glucocorticoid  receptor 
(69%). In another assay including 79 receptors, ion channels and transporters, metabolite M1 (10 μM) displayed 
an inhibition of binding by > 50% at the V1a receptor (57%).  
According  to  the  study  reports  results  showing  an  inhibition  higher  than  50%  are  considered  to  represent 
significant effects of the test compounds. Even so, in the pharmacology written and tabulated summaries the 
applicant has only presented results showing an inhibition higher than 80%. Clearly, several other targets were 
showing  an  inhibition  higher  than  50%  and  several  targets  were  showing  inhibition  of  20  to  50%  (mild  to 
moderate effect). A functional assay was performed only for the V1a receptor (no activity found). A comment 
regarding  the  large  amount  of  targets  showing  a  moderate  to  high  inhibition  would  have  been  desirable. 
However,  the  possible  secondary  targets  have  been  taken  into  account  when  evaluating  the  results  of  the 
toxicology studies.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Cardiovascular effects of dasabuvir were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.  
In a GLP hERG assay the IC 50 of dasabuvir was 0.3 µg/mL, to be compared with the clinical plasma concentration 
at the maximum recommended human dose, 1.03 µg/mL. This indicates a possible effect of dasabuvir on hERG. 
No  prolongation  of  dog  Purkinje  fiber  action  potential  duration  was  seen  up  to  and  including  the  highest 
concentration tested, 14.9 µg/mL. In anesthetized dogs, dasabuvir produced a modest increase in mean arterial 
blood pressure (7 mmHg) and a shortening of the QT interval (maximum 14 ms) at plasma concentrations of 
0.23 and 1.84 μg/mL, respectively. When administered in a low-dose study over a slower range of escalating 
infusion dasabuvir did not produce an effect on mean arterial blood pressure at concentrations as high as 0.7 
μg/mL suggesting that the pressor effect observed at high infusion rates was mediated by the rate of rise in 
dasabuvir  concentration.  In  conscious  dogs,  10  mg/kg  dasabuvir  (exposure  =  6  μg/mL)  produced  a  slight 
decrease  in  blood  pressure  (13  mmHg  at  two  hours  after  dosing).  Clinically,  in  First-In-Human  studies  on 
dasabuvir no effects on blood pressure were observed. Furthermore, the effect of dasabuvir on cardiovascular 
safety  was  evaluated  in  a  thorough  QT  study.  The  3DAA  (direct  acting  antivirals,  combination  of  ABT-450, 
ABT-267 and dasabuvir) regimen, at dasabuvir doses of 250 mg and 500 mg, did not result in QTc prolongation 
in humans. Taken together, dasabuvir does not appear to have a potential for adverse QT-effects. 
Safety studies on the central nervous system included a primary observation study (Irwin, doses up to 100 
mg/kg),  a  pro-/anticonvulsant  study  (doses  up  to  100  mg/kg),  a  study  on  nociception  and  spontaneous 
locomotor activity (doses up to 100 mg/kg) and a functional observational battery (FOB, doses up to 30 mg/kg). 
In  all  of  the  studies,  performed  in  rat,  the  plasma  exposures  were  exceeding  the  highest  clinical  plasma 
concentration (Cmax =1.03 µg/mL). No relevant effects were found in any of the studies.  
Effects  of  dasabuvir  on  the  respiratory  function  were  evaluated  in  conscious  rats.  Oral  administration  of 
dasabuvir  did  not  produce  any  physiologically  relevant  effects  on  respiratory  rate,  tidal  volume  or  minute 
volume up to and including 30 mg/kg, a dose associated with plasma levels of 4.7 µg/mL (clinical Cmax =1.03 
µg/mL). 
The safety aspects of the gastrointestinal system were studied in ferrets and rats. No emesis or nausea was 
observed  in  ferrets  up  to  and  including  the  highest  oral  dose  of  15  mg/kg,  corresponding  to  a  plasma 
concentration of 1.1 µg/mL. In rats dasabuvir had no significant effects on gastrointestinal transit up to and 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014

including the highest oral dose of 30 mg/kg, corresponding to a plasma concentration of 3.6 µg/ml (clinical Cmax 
=1.03 µg/mL). 
In rats, dasabuvir did not affect latency to sodium barbital (159 mg/kg, intraperitoneal)-induced sleep, sleep 
duration, or number of rats sleeping through the highest dose tested, 100 mg/kg, p.o. Neither did dasabuvir 
induce sleep when given with ethanol (2000 mg/kg, i.p.), through the highest dose tested, 100 mg/kg, p.o. 
In conclusion, no concerns were raised in the safety pharmacology studies on dasabuvir and no further studies 
are considered needed. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The species used for studies on absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of dasabuvir were mouse, 
rat, dog, rabbit and monkey.  
Dasabuvir, as the free acid has minimal solubility in aqueous solutions. The sodium salt has greater solubility in 
water and a faster in vitro dissolution rate, enabling administration of a simple aqueous suspension at high doses 
(up to 12000 mg/kg/day) for toxicology testing. The applicant has submitted results from product development 
studies, presenting pharmacokinetics data on different formulations of dasabuvir (R&D/14/0041, R&D/07/1144, 
R&D/13/785). In general, the data on pharmacokinetics are presented by the applicant in an unstructured way 
with several different formulations used, which makes comparison of data e.g. between different species difficult 
to assess. For the rat no results on absorption using the final formulation, the sodium salt suspension, were 
presented and only limited data on the dog. This is considered a shortcoming, since rat and dog are the main 
species used in the pivotal toxicity studies. Furthermore, the only data on bioavailability were measured using 
the solution formulation of free acid in 10% DMSO in PEG-400. The final formulation was not used in any of the 
studies on metabolism, distribution and excretion. This is, however, considered acceptable by the CHMP (see 
also below the comment regarding the distribution studies). 
A study in fasted dogs after a single dose of dasabuvir administered as the sodium salt suspension in 0.2% HPMC 
and as the solution of free acid in DMSO: PEG-400 demonstrated comparable exposures. In study R&D/13/785, 
data regarding exposure after administration of different formulations in rat is included. The data described in 
the report is ambiguous and unclear. Since rat is a main species used in the toxicology studies and since other 
formulations of dasabuvir than the final formulation have been used in most of the pharmacokinetics studies and 
the initial GLP toxicity studies in rat, a clarification of the stated comparability in plasma exposure in rats after 
treatment with the final sodium salt formulation and the formulations of the free acid would have been desirable. 
However,  since  the  final  sodium  salt  formulation  is  used  in  all  pivotal  toxicity  studies,  thereby  enabling 
estimation of adequate exposure margins in these studies, an explanation of the ambiguous data is considered 
not to be needed. 
Dose  proportionality  and  gender  differences  were  not  studied  in  the  pharmacokinetic  studies  but  were 
addressed in the toxicokinetic analysis. 
Dasabuvir was rapidly absorbed with Tmax values being around two hours in in rats, dogs and rabbits and around 
one hour in mice and somewhat higher in monkey. The oral bioavailability values from studies using the solution 
formulation of free acid in 10% DMSO in PEG-400, were wide-ranging, with values high in dog (96%), moderate 
in rat (21%) and very low in monkey (4.5%).  
According to the study report R&D/07/1144 the bioavailability from studies using the suspension of the sodium 
salt in fasted dogs was comparable to that obtained from a solution formulation of the free acid (~2.5 mg/kg 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014

doses). Regarding comparison between bioavailability of the different formulations following oral dosing in rat, 
a study is referred to in the study report, but this is not enclosed in the documentation. 
In all of the distribution studies presented the formulation of dasabuvir used was the solution of the free acid in 
DMSO: PEG-400, i.e. not the final formulation. Since the absorption of the free acid formulation can be assumed 
to be lower than of the sodium salt formulation it is not certain that the distribution of dasabuvir using the free 
acid in DMSO:PEG-400 would be fully representative of the distribution of the suspension of the sodium salt in 
0.2% HPMC. However, the CHMP agreed that the presented results can be considered sufficient for the purpose 
of these studies.   
Protein binding of dasabuvir and the M1 metabolite was independent of the 0.1 to 10 µM concentrations tested 
in mouse, rat, dog, monkey or human plasma, a concentration range which encompasses the average clinical 
concentrations.  Dasabuvir was highly protein bound with fraction unbound <0.01 in all species tested, showing 
no significant differences across species. The M1 metabolite was less highly protein bound (fraction unbound 
<0.1) in all species when compared to dasabuvir. 
When incubated in whole blood, [3H]dasabuvir distributed preferentially into the plasma compartment, with a 
blood-to-plasma concentration ratios ranging from 0.6 and 0.7 in rat, dog, monkey and human, independent of 
the 0.3 to 30 µM concentration evaluated. 
In  a  tissue  distribution  study  in  rats  the  highest  concentration  of  [14C]dasabuvir  was  found  in  the  liver, 
but  [14C]dasabuvir-derived radioactivity was not shown to be distributed to tissues protected by the blood brain 
barrier  (brain,  spinal  cord)  or  the  lens  of  the  eye.  [14C]dasabuvir-derived  radioactivity  did  not  selectively

associate  with 
Peak [14C]dasabuvir-derived radioactivity distributed to most tissues by 0.5-1 hours after drug administration. 
Tissue concentrations declined below the limits of quantitation in most tissues within 24 hours after dosing and 
tissues  containing  melanin 
(pigmented 
tissues  of 
concentrations of radioactivity were not detectable in any tissues 168 hours post-dose (R&D/12/152). After 96 
hours radioactivity was still detectable in the pigmented skin. The Applicant referred to clinical data, showing  
that there were no serious adverse events and no discontinuation of treatment due to a photosensitivity event. 
Based on this, the Applicant concluded that no risk minimization measures were warranted for the 3DAA or 
2DAA  combinations  to  prevent  phototoxicity-related  adverse  events  in  humans.  Based  on  the  submitted 
information, CHMP concluded that there was no large concern regarding a risk for photosensitivity reactions 
associated with treatment using the 3DAA regimen (see also section on phototoxicity below). 
Following  oral  administration  of  [14C]dasabuvir  to  pregnant  Sprague-Dawley  rats,  there  was  a  lack  of 
drug-derived radioactivity in the amniotic fluid and detectable foetal levels only in the liver. This indicates that 
only small amounts of [14C]dasabuvir-related material are crossing the placenta.   
Dasabuvir metabolite identification across species showed that metabolism primarily occurred on the t-butyl 
group to form the active metabolite M1, followed by secondary oxidation to M4 and M5, followed by secondary 
glucuronidation of M1 and M5 to M3 and M6, respectively, as well as sulfation of M1 to M2. Seven metabolites 
were  identified  in  human  plasma,  including  M1,  M2,  M3,  M4,  M5,  M6  and  a  trace  amount  of  the  desmethyl 
metabolite, M11. Unchanged parent drug was the most abundant component in plasma in animals (46 to 100%) 
and  humans  (59%).  Metabolite  M1  was  the  only  major  (>10%  of  total  drug  related  materials  in  plasma) 
metabolite  in  plasma  in  TgHras  mice  (30  %),  CD1-mice  (34  %)  and  human  (18%).  In  rats  all  metabolites 
including  M1  (3  %)  was  considered  minor  (<10%  of  total  drug  related  materials  in  plasma).  In  dogs  only 
unchanged parent drug was detected. Thus, M1 was not detected in the dog plasma, but detectable levels were 
found in the faeces and urine. The M1 metabolite was shown to have similar activity against genotype 1 HCV 
infection as dasabuvir. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 16/119 
  
  
In rats (bile duct cannulated Sprague-Dawley, single i.v. dose) the most significant metabolite in bile was M3 
(~50% of the dose), followed by M1 (8% of the dose) and M5 (5% of the dose). Other metabolites included M2, 
M4 and M6.   In urine, M1 was the primary component (2.5% of dose) (similar metabolite profiles observed 
following single oral doses).  In dogs, unchanged parent drug was the major species in faeces, representing 
53.9% of the administered oral [14C]dasabuvir dose, followed by M1. Other metabolites included M4, M12, M13 
and some small uncharacterized radiochemical components, each representing <2% of dose. 
Studies in human liver microsomes and studies with recombinant CYP and FMO enzymes have demonstrated 
that dasabuvir is predominantly metabolized by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4.  
Following single oral administration of dasabuvir to mice, rats, dogs and humans, parent drug and metabolites 
were mainly cleared via biliary excretion and fecal elimination, with minimal renal clearance. In CD-1 mouse, a 
majority of radioactivity was recovered in the faeces (>98%), with the fraction of dose recovered in urine <1%. 
In bile-duct cannulated male Sprague-Dawley rats, most of the radioactivity was observed in faeces (58.7% of 
dose), followed by 32.1% in bile and 0.9% in urine, with an overall recovery of 92.0%. In dogs, 82.3% of the 
dose was recovered in the faeces, with minimal recovery in the urine (~0.6% of dose). In human, 94.4% of the 
dasabuvir dose was found in faeces and 2.2% in urine, with an overall 96.6% recovery of radioactivity during the 
240 hour collection period. 
Rats and dogs are the species used in the pivotal repeated toxicology studies. The choice of nonclinical species 
can be considered acceptable. The active metabolite M1 was the only major human metabolite. In dogs, M1 was 
not detected in plasma. In rats, dispite the low level of M1 detected in plasma (3%), the plasma exposure level 
in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  and  the  reproductive  toxicity  studies  was  exceeding  the  human  maximal  clinical 
exposure. The only carcinogenicity study included in the documentation was performed in TgHras mouse (a 
study  in  rat  is  ongoing)  and  also  in  this  study  the  plasma  exposure  level  of  M1  was  exceeding  the  human 
maximal clinical exposure. Thus the M1 metabolite can be considered to be covered in the pivotal toxicology 
studies in rats and mice (see also the toxicokinetics section).  
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of dasabuvir has been evaluated in a set of non-clinical studies including repeat-dose 
toxicity studies up to 3 months in mice, 6 months in rats and 9 months in dogs; combination repeat dose toxicity 
studies with ribavirin (RBV) and/or pegylated interferon-α (pegIFN) up to 1 month in monkeys and 3 months in 
rats;  genotoxicity;  carcinogenicity  studies  (Tg-rasH2  mice,  Sprague-Dawley  rats);  fertility  and  pre-  and 
postnatal  development  (rat)  and  embryo-fetal  development  (EFD)  (rat  and  rabbit)  studies;  and  impurity 
qualifying studies. The rat carcinogenicity study is in the reporting phase. 
The  rat  (Sprague-Dawley)  and  dog  (Beagle)  were  selected  as  the  main  rodent  and  non-rodent  toxicology 
species. In general, the non-clinical toxicology program has been performed according to relevant guidelines.  
Single dose toxicity 
No single-dose toxicity studies were conducted with dasabuvir, which was deemed acceptable by CHMP. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Dasabuvir has been evaluated in repeat-dose toxicity studies in wild type TgHras mice (up to 1 month), CD-1 
mice (up to 3 months), Sprague Dawley rats (up to 6 months with 1 month recovery) and Beagle dogs (up to 9 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 17/119 
 
  
  
months with 1 month recovery). Treatment with dasabuvir was well tolerated in rats and dogs. No dose-limiting 
effects were noted in the chronic rat and dog studies and therefore, the toxicology of dasabuvir is not considered 
fully explored. However, based on the 18-/47-fold (males/females) exposure margins in the 6-month rat study, 
and the 120-fold exposure margin in the 9-month  dog study, this is considered acceptable. Adverse effects 
including mortality and GI tract effects were observed in mice.  Findings in rat (lung and small intestine) and 
dogs (liver, adrenal gland and lymphoid tissue) were not considered adverse.  
Preterminal mortalities and GI tract effects in mice  
CD-1 and wild-type TgHras mice were terminated for welfare reasons at ~ 29- and 110-fold clinical exposure 
based on AUC, respectively.  At necropsy, the presence of semisolid luminal material presumed to represent 
unabsorbed dasabuvir was observed in the stomach of mice. Microscopic findings included hyperplasia of the 
mucosal epithelium, mucus metaplasia of gastric glands and increased inflammation in the glandular stomach 
and hyperkeratosis and squamous metaplasia in the non-glandular stomach. The deaths and GI tract effects 
were attributed to the administration of large amounts of dasabuvir locally, rather than a systemic effect. This 
is  supported  by  the  lack  of  similar  GI  tract  findings  in  the  dog  at  equivalent  exposures  and  the  increased 
incidence/severity  of  the  findings  in  the  mouse  at  12000  compared  to  6000 mg/kg/day  despite  a  similar 
exposure at these two dose levels. As the total daily dose of dasabuvir in humans, 500 mg/day corresponding to 
~8  mg/kg/day  in  a  60  kg  patient,    is  considerably  less  than  6000  mg/kg/day,  the  findings  in  mice  are  not 
anticipated in humans. 
Non-adverse intestinal findings were noted at high dosages and after long term administration (6-months) in the 
rodent.    In  the  6-months  TgHras  carcinogenicity  study,  there  was  refractile  foreign  material  presumed  to 
represent  precipitated  dasabuvir  accompanied  by 
infiltrates  of  neutrophils  and  macrophages  (≥ 
600 mg/kg/day;  ≥  119 µg·hr/mL)  but  not  at  lower  dosages.    The  refractile  material  with  associated 
inflammation is considered to be secondary to local effects of a high drug load rather than a systemic effect.   
In  the  6-months  rat  study,  similar  refractile  foreign  material  was  present  accompanied  by  granulomatous 
inflammation in the ileum at 800 mg/kg/day; 119 µg·hr/mL in males and 319 µg·hr/mL in females. While the 
inflammation and crystals were still present at the end of the 1-month recovery period, there was no evidence 
of progression.  Support for this conclusion is based on the lack of findings at a lower drug load (200 mg/kg/day) 
in the 6-month rat study (female rats at 200 mg/kg/day achieved a higher systemic exposure than the males at 
800 mg/kg/day) and the lack of findings in the 9-month dog study at a lower drug load (60 mg/kg/day) but high 
systemic exposure (828 µg·hr/mL).  
Lung effects in rats 
Non-adverse  findings  in  the  6-month  rat  study  included  alveolar  histiocytosis  (≥ 50  mg/kg/day;  ≥ 31 
µg·hr/mL).  Alveolar histiocytosis was not observed in other species (mouse, dog or monkey) and evidence of 
reversibility was noted at the end of the 1-month recovery period.  
Liver effects in dogs 
In the 9-month dog study, microscopic changes in the liver were limited to minimal to mild diffuse hepatocellular 
vacuolation in males given 60 mg/kg/day correlating with mildly increased liver enzyme values (ALT, SDH, GGT 
and total bilirubin) and increased liver weights. These effects were not noted at the end of the 1-month recovery 
period.  
Lymphoid tissue and adrenal gland effects in dogs and mice 
Assessment report

In the 9-month dog study, there was an increase in incidence and severity of thymic lymphoid depletion in the 
male high dose group (60 mg/kg/day) with a corresponding decrease in mean thymus weight.  In addition, some 
dogs in this group exhibited lymphoid depletion in the spleen (mild), Peyer’s patches (minimal to moderate), and 
lymph nodes (minimal to mild).  However, there were no effects on peripheral lymphocyte counts. The affected 
males  also  had  increased  adrenal  gland  weights  and  mild  diffuse  adrenal  cortical  hypertrophy/hyperplasia, 
suggestive  of  a  stress  response.    There  were  no  effects  in  females  despite  similar  exposures  in  males 
(829 µg·hr/mL) and females (848 µg·hr/mL) at 60 mg/kg/day.  The lymphoid effects in the high dose males 
were reversible.  No adverse clinical findings related to lymphoid depletion were noted during the study and 
there  were  no  effects  on  peripheral  lymphocyte  counts.    Thus,  the  effects  in  the  high  dose  males  were  not 
considered adverse. 
Effects on lymphoid tissues in other studies were limited to the 1-month study in wild-type TgHras mice where 
a minimal to moderate thymic lymphoid depletion/necrosis was noted in female mice administered 6000 and 
12000 mg/kg/day.  This finding was considered to be secondary to stress based on the presence of adrenal 
cortical  hyperplasia  and  deaths  in  these  groups.  Similar  findings  were  not  apparent  in  the  6-month 
carcinogenicity study in TgHras mice at dosages up to 2000 mg/kg/day.   
Combination repeat-dose toxicity  
Co-administration of ribavirin (rat and monkey) and pegIFN (monkey) with dasabuvir did not exacerbate any 
toxicities associated with ribavirin/pegIFN and did not induce any new combinatorial toxicities.  Additionally, 
there  were  no  apparent  effects  on  the  toxicokinetic  parameters  (dasabuvir,  ribavirin,  or  pegIFN)  with  the 
co-dosing paradigms in either species.  
According  to  the  SmPC,  dasabuvir  is  indicated  for  combination  therapy  with  ombitasvir  (ABT-267)  and 
ABT-450/ritonavir with or without ribavirin for up to 24 weeks. No non-clinical combination toxicity studies have 
been conducted with the 3 DAAs; this was deemed agreeable by CHMP. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Dasabuvir was tested negative in a complete package of genotoxicity studies, including test for gene mutations 
and chromosomal aberrations in vitro and chromosomal aberrations in vivo.  
The carcinogenic potential of dasabuvir was evaluated in a 26-week study in TgHras transgenic mice with no 
statistically significant increases in neoplastic changes due to dasabuvir treatment. Therefore, dasabuvir was 
considered  not  carcinogenic  up  to  the  highest  dosage  tested  (2 g/kg/day)  corresponding  to  39-fold  clinical 
exposure based on AUC. The 2-year carcinogenicity study in Sprague Dawley rats is in the reporting phase.  
Reproduction and developmental toxicity 
In the fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, there were no significant effects on male or 
female fertility parameters when tested up to doses of 800 mg/kg/day (400 mg/kg BID) corresponding to 29- 
and 36-fold the expected clinical AUC in males and females, respectively. In addition, dasabuvir did not affect 
reproductive organ weights, or caused macroscopic or histopathological findings in reproductive organs in any of 
the investigated species in repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Embryofoetal developmental studies were performed in rats and rabbits. There were no dasabuvir-related 
changes in maternal or foetal parameters in either of the species. In rats, the NOAEL for maternal and foetal 
toxicity was 800 mg/kg/day (400 mg/kg BID) corresponding to 48-fold clinical exposure based on AUC and in

rabbits, the NOAEL for maternal and foetal toxicity was 400 mg/kg/day corresponding to 12-fold clinical 
exposure based on AUC. 
In the pre- and post-natal study in rats, oral administration of dasabuvir up to doses of 800 mg/kg/day (400 
mg/kg BID) from the period of implantation to weaning of offspring no significant effects on maternal function 
such as maintenance of pregnancy, delivery and nursing were observed. In the F1 generation rats, there were 
no significant effects on survival, growth, sexual maturation, motor activity, acoustic startle, learning and 
memory, mating and fertility, male reproductive organ weights or ovarian and uterine parameters. The NOAEL 
was 800 mg/kg/day corresponding to 44-fold clinical exposure based on AUC. On Day 14 post-partum, the mean 
dasabuvir plasma concentration in F1 pups were between 10 to 15% of that in maternal animals indicating that 
dasabuvir is transferred to the pups via milk. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Immunotoxicity  
No  independent  immunotoxicity  studies  were  conducted.  However  immunotoxicity  was  evaluated  by  the 
standard parameters in repeat-dose toxicity studies. The evaluations did not identify direct dasabuvir-related 
immunotoxicity concerns. 
Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance studies were submitted which is acceptable. Local irritating properties of dasabuvir in the GI 
tract have been observed in mice after administration of ≥6000 mg/kg/day (110-fold above the clinical AUC 
exposure). This is not considered a concern in the clinical situation. 
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity  
Dasabuvir absorbs light within the range of natural sunlight (290 to 700 nm) with a MEC exceeding the threshold 
of 1000 L mol-1cm-1 as cited in ICH S10 Step 4 Guideline. In rat QWBA studies, [14C] dasabuvir-derived material 
was widely distributed following an oral dose, with concentrations in skin and eye comparable to blood.  The 
[14C]  dasabuvir-derived  material  was  not  selectively  associated  with  melanin-containing  tissues.  Tissue 
concentrations declined below the limits of quantitation in most tissues, including non-pigmented skin and eye, 
within 24 hours after dosing. However, radioactivity was still detectable in pigmented skin at 96 hours. No in 
vitro or in vivo phototoxicity studies were performed with ABT-333. The Applicant refers to clinical data, showing 
that there were no serious adverse events and no discontinuation of treatment due to a photosensitivity event. 
Based on this, the Applicant concludes that no risk minimization measures are warranted for the 3DAA or 2DAA 
combinations to prevent phototoxicity-related adverse events in humans. 
The performed Phase 2 or 3 clinical trials with the 3DAA regimen were primarily conducted over the period of 
November 2012 through November 2013, and included the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. In the 
clinical trials, there were no restrictions on sun exposure or requirements for sun protection or use of sunscreen 
and the percentage of subjects with rash-related treatment-emergent events following treatment with the 3DAA 
regimen (13.9%) was comparable to that observed for placebo subjects (15.7%), suggesting that the higher 
frequency  of  rash-related  events  in  the  3DAA  +  RBV  treatment  groups  (28.6%)  was  primarily  due  to  the 
presence of RBV. In addition, utilizing a company MedDRA query (CMQ) for photosensitivity reactions a search 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014

was performed which identified a low and comparable incidence of photosensitivity preferred terms (0.9% for 
the ABT-450/r, ABT-267 and ABT-333 + RBV group, 1.0% for ABT-450/r, ABT-267 and ABT-333 and 0.8% for 
the placebo group) for the 3DAA+RBV regimen and placebo. According to the Applicant, all events in the three 
groups were non-serious, mild in severity and did not lead to study drug discontinuation. 
Approximately 88% of the patients in the Phase 2/3 trials (2309 patients) is reported to have been treated for 
at least 28 days during the time period from Spring equinox to Fall equinox per hemisphere (approximately six 
months with at least 12 hours of day light per day and 52% (1372 patients) were treated for at least 28 days 
during the time period from Summer solstice to Fall equinox per hemisphere (approximately three months of 
summer).  Using exact binomial probability calculations, the Applicant estimate the probability to be at least 
95% to observe a photosensitivity reaction in at least one subject in the 6 month period or the 3 month period 
if the rates of these reactions were 0.0013 and 0.0022, respectively. 
Based  on  the  above  information,  CHMP  concluded  that  there  is  no  large  concern  regarding  a  risk  for 
photosensitivity reactions associated with treatment using the 3DAA regimen. 
Dependence  
No drug dependence studies were submitted. CHMP considered this as acceptable, as neither dasabuvir, nor its 
metabolites have no distribution to the brain and there was no evidence of effects on the central nervous system 
in toxicology studies. 
Metabolites 
No dedicated studies were conducted with dasabuvir metabolites. In humans, metabolite M1 was characterized 
as a major metabolite (21.4% of total plasma radioactivity). M1 is also a major metabolite in CD-1 and TgHras 
mouse and a minor metabolite in rats. However, based on the high exposure in rats, adequate exposure of M1 
has been achieved in the evaluation of general toxicity, carcinogenicity, in vivo genotoxicity and embryo-foetal 
development. 
Impurities  
The toxicological qualifications of the specified ABT-333 impurities as suggested by the applicant are endorsed. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  risk  to  the  terrestrial  compartment  needs  to  be  further  evaluated  and  refined  in  an  updated  ERA.  The 
applicant has indicated that the final reports and the updated ERA will be provided in April 2015. 
2.3.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical documentation is comprehensive and studies have been conducted in accordance with relevant 
guidelines and GLP. The Applicant has sought scientific advice for the non-clinical program and followed the 
recommendations received.  
The non-clinical part of the dossier is considered to be sufficient. No major deficiencies have been identified. A 
final Environmental risk assessment cannot be made at present, which needs to be addressed by the Applicant.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Dasabuvir  has  a  major  metabolite,  M1,  which  has  antiviral  activity,  albeit  7-8  fold  lower  than  the  parent 
compound (see below). M1 has been measured in almost all pharmacokinetic studies. M1 is present at plasma 
concentrations about half those of dasabuvir. However, due to differences in protein binding, the unbound M1 
concentration is 6.5-fold higher than the concentration of dasabuvir and thus the contribution of M1 to efficacy 
is  significant.  Active  moiety  calculations  have  been  performed  but  are  difficult  to  use  as  M1  in  contrast  to 
dasabuvir may have higher liver distribution due to active uptake. In the calculations the applicant has used a 
relative activity factor of 10 instead of 7-8. Thus, M1 contributes slightly more to the active moiety and efficacy 
than estimated by the applicant. 
Absorption  
Dasabuvir as the free acid, is a moderate molecular weight (mw 493.58), lipophilic compound (logD 4.3), with 
minimal  solubility  in  aqueous  solutions  (~0.15  µg/mL  at  pH  7.4).  The  solubility  is  not  pH  dependent  at 
physiological pH:s. The absorption of dasabuvir was moderate with Tmax occurring at ca. 3 hours post-dose. 
Different formulations have been used during development and the PK bridging is sufficient. In the last part of 
development an optimized tablet was used that had a higher, almost complete, bioavailability than the earlier 
formulations and therefore the dose was reduced from 400 to 250 mg to maintain the same exposure. Dasabuvir 
is  a  substrate  of  Pgp  in  MDR-1  over-expressing  MDCK  cells.  The  permeability  in  vitro  has  not  been  well 
determined but seems to be high in vivo based on the high bioavailability. 
Dasabuvir should be administered with food. In most studies dasabuvir has been administered 30 minutes after 
the  start  of  a  moderate  meal.  The  administration  of  dasabuvir  30  minutes  after  starting  a  moderate-fat 
breakfast resulted in a ca. 40% increase in dasabuvir AUC and a 54% increase in Cmax. The corresponding 
parameters for M1 increased ca. 54 and 30%, respectively. Administration with a high-fat breakfast resulted in 
somewhat lower food-effect. A quite marked difference in exposure between morning and evening dose was 
observed in many studies and may be caused by differences in food intake. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution of dasabuvir is approximately 400 L after iv administration. Dasabuvir is extensively 
protein bound, fu values in human ranged from 0.0030-0.0054.  The metabolite M1 is less bound with an fu of 
about 0.05. This means that the free concentration of M1 is ca. 6.5-fold the free concentration of dasabuvir 
(using 0.57 in molar M1/dasabuvir ratio) and thus the M1 contribution to efficacy (assuming similar distribution) 
could be significant. In contrast to dasabuvir, M1 is a substrate to hepatic uptake transporters (OATP1B1, 1B3 
and  OCT-1)  and  may  reach  higher  concentrations  in  the  liver  as  compared  to  plasma.  The  liver/plasma 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 37/119 
 
 
  
  
concentration ratio of radioactivity after a radiolabelled dasabuvir dose to rat was ca 23-46 at different time 
points. M1, but not dasabuvir, is substrate to OATP1 and 3. The blood to plasma ratio of dasabuvir was 0.67.  
Elimination 
In the mass-balance study, 94% of the radioactivity was excreted in faeces up to 240 hours postdose and 2.2% 
(± 0.57%) was excreted in urine. Unchanged dasabuvir contributed to 26% of the radioactivity in faeces while 
excretion of dasabuvir in urine is negligible. As the unchanged drug in faeces likely is unabsorbed drug based on 
the expected bioavalability of an early formulation (no information found on which formulation was used in this 
study),  biliary  and  renal  excretion  seems  not  to  be  significant  elimination  pathways  of  unchanged  drug. 
Dasabuvir  is  eliminated  mainly  through  formation  of  M1.  M1  was  the  most  abundant  component  in  faeces, 
accounting for 32% of total dose, followed by unchanged dasabuvir (26%), M2 (15%), M5 (11%) and some 
minor metabolites (M8-10). The total amount of M1-related conjugates in human urine and faeces was 24% of 
dose.  Secondary oxidative metabolite of M1 and subsequent conjugates comprised 14% of dose, indicating M1 
is  mainly  cleared  through  direct  faecal  elimination  or  M1  conjugates;  subsequent  oxidation  of  M1  plays  a 
secondary role. M1 is the only “major metabolite” present in plasma after dasabuvir dosing. 
This is the proposed elimination schedule of dasabuvir (and M1) 
The formation of M1 is catalysed by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 in vitro and their roles have been confirmed in vivo in 
the drug interaction study with the 2C8 inhibitor gemfibrozil and the 3A inhibitor ketoconazole. As dasabuvir 
always will be given with ritonavir, which is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A and possibly also an inducer of 
CYP2C8, the role of CYP2C8 in relation to CYP3A becomes even more marked at steady state in the 3-DAA 
combination.  The  applicant  has  not  fully  investigated  which  transporters  and  enzymes  are  involved  in  the 
elimination of M1. M1 seems to be partly biliary excreted (ca 45%), partly glucuronidated (35%) and to a lesser 
extent – oxidized (20%). The uptake transporters OATP1B1 and 1B3, as well as OCT-1 are likely involved and as 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 38/119 
 
  
  
M1 can be transported by Pgp and BCRP, these may be involved in hepatic efflux. UGT1A4, 1A9 and 2B7 are 
capable of performing the glucuronidation. CYP2C8 and 3A4 has been proposed to catalyse the oxidation. There 
are no in vivo data indicating involvement of a certain enzyme/transporter. 
If the active uptake of M1 would be in vivo relevant, OAT1B1 and 1B3 inhibitors could give rise to increased M1 
exposure. However, the lack of increase in M1 exposure in the DDI studies with cyclosporine and atazanavir (see 
below) indicate that OATP uptake is of limited importance for M1 elimination. It is possible that OCT-1 is more 
relevant. 
Pharmacogenetics 
CYP2C8  is  a  polymorphic  enzyme.  The  transporters  OCT-1,  BCRP  and  OATP1B1  are  also  subject  to 
polymorphisms. The applicant has analysed the impact of pharmacogenetics on ABT-450 and dasabuvir pooling 
data  from  many  PK  studies.  No  association  was  found  between  genotype  of  genes  coding  enzymes  and 
transporters and drug exposure. The  variability in drug exposure may have been too large for effects to be 
detected with this method. 
The  applicant  has  also  analysed  the  relationship  between  BSEP  genotype  and  elevation  in  transaminases 
generally in the file as well as elevation of transaminases in oestrogen treated patients (the OC DDI study). 
(Genetic  studies  have  identified  that  mutations  in  BSEP  that  lead  to  premature  truncation  of  the  protein  or 
missense  mutations  in  patients  are  responsible  for  hereditary  cholestasis.  In  addition,  a  relatively  common 
polymorphism  in  exon  13  (rs2287622)  may  be  associated  with  higher  incidences  of  pregnancy  and 
contraceptive-induced  cholestasis.)  No  relationship  between  BSEP  genotype  and  raised  transaminases  was 
found but looking at the subjects in the OC DDI study, there was a correlation. However, this is a very small data 
set (see Table 1).

(CC has a lower expression) 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 39/119 
 
 
  
  
The applicant has been asked by CHMP to investigate as a post-authorisation measure whether concomitant use 
of drugs that are BSEP inhibitors is associated with increased transaminases.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Single dose pharmacokinetics using early formulations is linear up to doses of 800-1200 mg, where absorption 
starts  to decrease,  possibly  due  to  solubility.  There  is  no  single-dose  vs.  multiple-dose  comparison,  thus,  it 
cannot be properly assessed whether there is any change over time in clearance. There is an in vitro induction 
signal and in some of the DDI studies, the results could be interpreted as dasabuvir mediating a small induction. 
There is also a signal of CYP3A4 TDI in vitro. The accumulation ratio of dasabuvir and M1 are about 2 and 1.5, 
respectively. Based on the short half-life of dasabuvir (ca. 6 hrs), a somewhat smaller accumulation would be 
expected. In conclusion, there seems to be no marked time-dependency. Steady state for both substances was 
reached approximately on the third day of treatment. 
Special populations 
Population  pharmacokinetic  analyses  of  PhaseI/II  and  Phase  III  data  suggested  cirrhosis,  sex,  creatinine 
clearance and body weight to be statistically significant predictors of dasabuvir CL. However these effects were 
not considered clinically relevant and no dose adjustment based on gender, age, weight and race is warranted. 
Females had higher exposures (AUC24,ss) of the DAAs compared to males. The dasabuvir exposure was ≤ 30% 
higher.  There  were  no  indications  of  an  altered  DAA  exposure  in  Asians;  Black  and  Hispanic/Latinos.    Body 
weight was a significant covariate on CL/F, Vc/F and Vp/F. A < 10% change in exposure with a change of ± 10 
kg from 76 kg of body weight was estimated. The difference is deemed as clinically not relevant. Age was a 
significant covariate on CL/F. A ≤ 10% change in exposures with a change of ± 10 years from 54 years of age 
was predicted for dasabuvir.  
Hepatic impairment 
The AUC of dasabuvir was 17% increased, 16% decreased and 4.2-fold increased, respectively in patients with 
mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment. M1 was unchanged, decreased by 57% and increased by 76%.  
There  was  no  increase  in  fu  vs  degree  of  impairment.  Due  to  lack  of  clinical data,  a  posology  for  moderate 
hepatic impairment is not given in the Exviera SmPC.  
Renal impairment 
The  AUC  of  dasabuvir  was  97,  38  and  47%  (increased  in  mild,  moderate,  and  severe  renal  impairment), 
respectively. For M1 the AUC was 39 and 28 decreased in mild and moderate renal impairment while it was 34% 
decreased in severe impairment. 
No information about the effect of age on the PK of dasabuvir is available in truly elderly patients (>75 years) 
and limited information is available in elderly patients >65 years. Possible differences in exposure in elderly are 
thereby difficult to predict. However, based on safety data, no dose adjustments appear necessary.  
Exposure associated with clinical response  
ABT-333 monotherapy data did not suggest a significant difference in efficacy  between 300 mg BID (~25% 
lower exposure), 400 mg BID (~Phase 3 exposure) and 600 mg BID dosing. A logistic-regression analyses using 
GT1a  data 
from  Phase  3  studies  (including  cirrhotic  and  non-cirrhotic, 
treatment-naïve  and 
treatment-experienced subjects), indicated that ABT-333 exposures were not a significant predictor of SVR. In 
addition,  a  simulation  study  using  a  semi-mechanistic  model  of  viral  dynamics  (ABT-450/r,  ABT-267  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014

ABT-333 Exposure-Viral Load Response Report R&D/13/1069) did not show a significant difference in SVR when 
all components (ABT-450, ABT-267and ABT-333) were reduced by 50%.    
Multivariate logistic regression did not suggest a significant correlation between ABT-333 exposure and safety 
(Rash-related events, ALT elevations, Total bilirubin elevations and Low hemoglobin levels) at the dose 400 mg 
BID. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The applicant has submitted an extensive DDI data package with in vitro and in vivo studies. Both dasabuvir and 
M1 has been screened for enzyme and transporter inhibition in vitro. The DDI potential has been investigated 
with 17 drugs, sometimes in more than one study. In the in vivo studies, all DAAs are included and the net effect 
is  gained.  This  is  satisfactory  as  it  reflects  the  clinical  situation,  but  it  sometimes  hinders  mechanistic 
conclusions, in particular when combining with such a DDI prone drug as ritonavir. The DDIs with ritonavir are 
time-dependent and the drug affects a multitude of proteins. Thus, mutual, time dependent interactions are 
expected. However, the study designs do not always take this into account and the estimated interaction effect 
may be slightly different at steady state. 
Dasabuvir as perpetrator – in vitro studies

*If two concentrations and evaluations are given this relates to intestinal / systemic inhibition. 
As can be seen from the table, the Ki’s of UGT1A4 and 1A6 are close to the cut-off. The EC50’s were not well 
determined and are likely over-predicted. Thus, the signals are considered positive. 
When relevant, enzyme inhibition parameters were corrected for non-specific binding and metabolism. Based on 
the in vitro information, potential for in inhibition in vivo can be concluded for dasabuvir and intestinal Pgp, 
dasabuvir and M1 on intestinal BCRP, dasabuvir and M1 on OATP1B1 and 1B3, dasabuvir on CYP2C8 and 2C19 
dasabuvir on UGT1A2, 1A4, 1A6 and 2B7. Possibly also CYP3A4 through TDI but here data is lacking to perform 
the IVIVC assessment.   
The in vitro enzyme induction study results indicate PXR mediated (CYP3A) induction as well as CYP1A2 down 
regulation  or  toxicity.  Toxicity  was  observed  at  the  highest  concentration.  Again  the  influence  of 
metabolism/degradation during the 24h 37°C incubations and well as non-specific binding is unknown. If there 
are toxicity issues, the full study could have had reduced sensitivity. However, as ritonavir will give induction of 
PXR inducible proteins unless they are sufficiently inhibited by ritonavir, or one of the 3-DAA components, this 
will not be further pursued. The net effect of the combination is available on a number of enzymes. In some of 
the  studies  comparing  3-DAA  and  2-DAA  (with  and  without  dasabuvir),  the  results  actually  indicate  that 
dasabuvir give rise to some additional induction.  
Dasabuvir as perpetrator – in vivo studies 
Mutual interactions in vivo between the components of the 3-DAA combination. 
Dasabuvir give rise to increased plasma concentrations of ABT-450. In a DDI study 400 mg dasabuvir increased 
the  ABT-450  exposure  by  ca  50%.  The  ritonavir  exposure  was  slightly  decreased.  ABT-450/r  200/100  mg 
decreased the exposure of dasabuvir by approx. 50% along with a minor to similar decreases in M1 exposure. 
The  mechanisms  of  the  DDI  effects  on  ABT-450  and  dasabuvir  may  be  BCRP+OATP1B1  inhibition  and  CYP 
induction,  respectively.  This  study  was  not  designed  for  investigating  time-dependent  processes  and  the 
ABT-450/r dose was higher than the one recommended. The pharmacokinetics of ABT-450 is markedly dose 
dependent  and  thus  extrapolation  between  doses  is  difficult.  There  is  no  study  investigating  the  mutual 
interaction between all substances of the combination. However, DDIs affecting ABT-267 exposure are rare.  
In vivo interaction studies with 3-DAA as perpetrator drugs 
CYP3A4: alprazolam  
The 3-DAA combination at steady state and alprazolam was given alone and in combination. Alprazolam AUC 
was increased by 34%, the increased exposure alprazolam is probably due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and 
possible also ABT-450. As compared to midazolam, alprazolam is not a very sensitive CYP3A4 substrate due to 
its limited first-pass metabolism. Thus, the effect on a more sensitive substrate may be higher. In the SmPC 
clinical monitoring of alprazolam is recommended. A decrease in alprazolam dose can be considered based on 
clinical response. 
CYP3A4: amlodipine 
When multiple doses of 3-DAAs were co-administered with a single oral dose of amlodipine besylate a 157% 
increase in amlodipine AUC, while amlodipine harmonic mean t1/2 increased from 42 hours to 104 hours. Cmax 
increased  by  26%  for  amlodipine.  No  change  in  DAAs  was  observed.  There  is  some  CYP3A4  metabolism  of 
amlodipine but it is not very sensitive to inhibition. The very strong CYP3A4 inhibitory combination indinavir/r 
800/100  gave  rise  to  a  89%  increase  in  amlodipine  AUC  (Glesby  et  al  Clin  Pharmacol  Ther.  2005).  A  dose 
reduction by 50% and extra monitoring is recommended in the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 42/119 
  
  
CYP2C9: warfarin 
3-DAA at steady state did not significantly affect the exposure of warfarin. 3-DAA decreased the AUC of S- and 
R  warfarin  by  approx.  15%,  most  likely  due  to  induction.  INR  should  be  monitored.  Clinically  significant 
drug-drug interactions are not expected with other CYP2C9 substrates. 
CYP2C19: Omeprazole and escitalopram 
Omeprazole is metabolised by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. 3DAA slightly (38%) reduced omeprazole exposure. This 
is expected due to the induction by ritonavir. If dasabuvir was removed from the DAA regimen, there was a 55% 
increase in omeprazole exposure. This would indicate that dasabuvir inhibit CYP2C19. This is also indicated by 
the in vitro data. There was no effect of omeprazole 40 mg qd on the exposure of the DAAs. 
Escitalopram  is  metabolised  by  CYP2C19  and  CYP2D6.  2-DAA  gave  rise  to  a  25%  reduction  in  the  AUC  of 
escitalopram, while there was no effect on escitalopram if dasabuvir was included in the treatment. This part is 
thus in contrast to the possible effects of dasabuvir indicated by the omeprazole study. However, based on the 
omeprazole data the DAA regimens appears to induce CYP2C19. The net effect could be higher if a drug is more 
metabolized by CYP2C19 than omeprazole, which is also metabolized by the inhibited CYP3A4. The formation of 
the  active  metabolite  from  clopidogrel  is  catalyzed  by  CYP2C19  and  CYP3A4.  Thus,  the  net  effect  on  active 
metabolite exposure is unknown.  
P-glycoprotein: digoxin 
In  a  drug  interaction  study  with  digoxin,  2DAA  gave  rise  to  a  higher  effect  (36%)  than  3-DAA  (16%)  with 
dasabuvir). Renal CL of digoxin was slightly decreased by 14% and by 19% with 3-DAA and 2-DAA, respectively. 
The reason for the smaller effect when adding dasabuvir is unknown. Monitoring is recommended. 
OATP1B1: pravastatin 
Pravastatin exposures (AUC24) were increased by 82% by concomitant 3DAA treatment. A similar effect was 
obtained with 2DAA. In vitro data indicate that dasabuvir (and M1) are OATP1B1 inhibitors in vivo. ABT-450, 
ritonavir and ABT-267 are also inhibitors. This study indicates that the 3DAA combination also inhibits these 
transporters  in  vivo.  Pravastatin  multiple  dose  treatment  increased  the  exposure  to  ABT-450  and  ritonavir 
(approx. 30-40%) during 2DAA but not 3DAA treatment. A pravastatin dose-reduction is recommended. 
BCRP and OATP1B1: rosuvastatin 
The  exposure  to  rosuvastatin  increased  by  ~160%  and  by  ~30%  when  co-treated  with  3-DAA  and  2-DAA, 
respectively. The study was performed with a Viekirax formulation that gave rise to only 60% of the exposure 
obtained with the final formulation. Effects up to 4-fold are expected with the 3-DAAs. Rosuvastatin increased 
ritonavir exposure by approx. 50 % during the 3DAA regimen and less so during 2DAA. The 2-DAA and 3-DAA 
differences shows the BCRP inhibitory potential of dasabuvir and ABT-450 in vivo. The dose of rosuvastatin is 
limited to 5 mg together with the 3DAA and 10 mg with the 2-DAA treatment.  
Other statins: The possible DDI with pitavastatin and fluvastatin has not been investigated. Increased exposure 
is  expected.  Therefore  a  temporary  suspension  of  these  statins  is  recommended  during  treatment  with  the 
DAAs. If statin treatment is required, pravastatin may be used at reduced dose. 
CYP3A metabolized statins (simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin) are contraindicated. 
Antiretroviral drugs: 
Rilpivirine 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 43/119 
  
  
The 3-DAA regimen increases the exposure of rilpivirine (administered as 75 mg qd) 3-fold. The effect by the 
DAAs was higher than expected as the most pronounced effect reported by a CYP3A4 inhibitor in the SPC so far 
(by  darunavir/r,  a  2.3-fold  increase).  Rilpivirine  should  be  used  cautiously,  in  the  setting  of  repeated  ECG 
monitoring. 
Raltegravir 
Raltegravir is eliminated through UGT1A1 catalysed metabolism. Treatment with 3-DAA gave rise to a 2-fold 
increase  in  raltegravir  exposure  (400  mg  bid).  UGT1A1  was  inhibited  in  vitro  by  dasabuvir,  ABT-267  and 
ABT-450. The background induction is evident if dasabuvir or ABT-267 is excluded, then the exposure increases 
2.2-fold  or  more  initially  (due  to  inhibition)  followed  by  induction  becoming  more  prominent  over  time, 
counteracting the inhibition leading to a gradual reduction in exposure and a net ca 40% increase in raltegravir 
exposure. No dose adjustment is necessary. 
Dolutegravir 
Based  on  the  effects  observed  on  raltegravir,  it  seemed  likely  that  the  dolutegravir  exposure  would  have  a 
similar increase. However, the specific UGT enzyme involvement in the elimination of the two drugs has not 
been confirmed by in vivo DDI studies. Preliminary in vivo DDI data indicate that the effect on dolutegravir is 
less  pronounced  than  observed  for  raltegravir.  The  applicant  will  submit  the  study  report  when  available. 
Meanwhile, dolutegravir will not be included in the SmPC. 
Lopinavir/r 
Lopinavir/r (steady state 800/200 mg QD and 400/100 mg BID) was investigated with two 2-DAA regimens and 
the  3-DAA  regimen.  The  exposure  to  dasabuvir  and  M1  was  reduced  by  46%  and  28%,  respectively,  when 
lopinavir/r was dosed QD in the evening. There were no marked effects of the 3-DAA regimen on lopinavir. In all 
three DAA regimens, lopinavir/r increased the exposure to ABT-450. The effect of lopinavir/r at steady state was 
considerable  greater  in  the  ABT-450/r+ombitasvir  regimen  (~6-fold  increase  in  AUC)  compared  to  the 
ABT-450/r+dasabuvir and the 3-DAA regimen (2-3-fold increase in AUC). In all DAA regimens, there was an 
increase in plasma concentrations of ABT-450 (second peak) following the evening dose of lopinavir/r. Use of 
lopinavir/r is contraindicated.  
Darunavir/r 
The effect of the 3 DAAs (ABT-450/r+ombitasvir+dasabuvir), the 2 DAAs (ABT-450/r+ombitasvir) and the 
2-DAAs (ABT-450/r+dasabuvir) on darunavir (800 mg QD and 600 mg BID) and vice versa was investigated.  In 
an additional study, the effect of ABT-450/r/ombitasvir ± dasabuvir on darunavir/r (800/100 mg QD in the 
evening) and vice versa was investigated. The mutual interactions were investigated when all study drugs were 
at steady state. The effects on darunavir (small decrease in exposure) were concluded not to be clinically 
relevant unless there is extensive PI resistance development. The exposure to ombitasvir, dasabuvir and M1 
were either comparable or decreased upon co-administration with darunavir. The greatest effects were 
observed on the exposure to ABT-450. If darunavir was dosed bid, there was a second peak of ABT-450 
following the evening dose of darunavir/r (similar to lopinavir/r). Darunavir can be taken (without ritonavir) 
unless there is extensive PI resistance. 
Atazanavir 
The effect of ABT-450/r+ombitasvir±dasabuvir on atazanavir (300 mg QD in the morning and 300/100 mg in 
the evening) and vice versa was investigated when all study drugs were at steady state. Atazanavir increased 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 44/119 
  
  
the  exposure  to  ABT-450  between  2-  and  3-fold.  The  recommended  dose  of  atazanavir  is  300  mg,  without 
ritonavir, in combination with the 3-DAAs. (Combination not recommended without dasabuvir.) 
HIV  protease  inhibitors  other  than  atazanavir  and  darunavir  are  not  recommended,  for  reasons  of 
interactions/lack of data. 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate  
The  effect  of  ABT-450/r+ombitasvir±dasabuvir  on  emtricitabine/tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  (200/300 mg 
QD) and vice versa was investigated with all study drugs being at steady state. The exposure to emtricitabine 
was unchanged, whereas the exposure to tenofovir was slightly increased. Based on what is known about the 
inhibitory effects on transporters by the DAA combinations, the increased tenofovir exposure could possibly be 
caused by inhibition of intestinal P-gp or possibly BCRP (increasing absorption of the prodrug tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate).  
The 3DAA combination including dasabuvir as victim for DDIs 
CYP2C8 inhibition: gemfibrozil 
The effect of 600 mg gemfibrozil bid on a single dose of ABT-450/r + dasabuvir was investigated. AUC tom 
dasabuvir increased approx. 11-fold. The metabolism to M1 was inhibited showing in a 78% reduction of M1 
AUC. The effect is probably different at steady state and there are some design issues adding variability to the 
DDI investigation. There was a 38% increase in the AUC of ABT-450 but no change in ritonavir. Gemfibrozil is 
contraindicated. 
CYP3A inhibition: ketoconazole 
The  effect  of  the  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitor  ketoconazole  (at  steady  state;  400 mg  QD  for  six  days)  on  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  the  3-  and  2-  DAA/r  combinations  (single  dose)  and  vice  versa  was  investigated. 
Ketoconazole increased the exposure to ABT-450, ritonavir and ombitasvir by approximately 2-fold, 1.5-fold and 
1.2-fold, respectively. The exposure (AUC) of dasabuvir increased 42%. M1 was unaffected. The exposure to 
ketoconazole  increased  2-fold.  The  net  effect  at  steady  state  on  all  substances  is  likely  somewhat  more 
pronounced as the ritonavir/ the3-DAA regimen shows time dependent CYP3A4 inhibition likely affecting also 
ketoconazole exposure. CYP3A4 inhibitors are contraindicated. The reason for the contraindication is not only 
the  somewhat  higher  effect  expected  at  steady  but  also  the  observed  marked  effects  of  lopinavir/r  and 
atazanavir/r proposed to be caused by dual CYP3A  and transporters. Many potent CYP3A inhibitors are also 
transporter  inhibitors.  The  elimination  of  ABT-450  is  not  well  characterised  and  as  such  mechanistic 
interpretation is difficult. 
Enzyme induction: Carbamazepine 
The effect of carbamazepine, 200 mg BID on a single dose administration of the 3-DAAs decreased the exposure 
by  65%  for  ABT-450,  32%  for  ABT-267,  by  70%  for  dasabuvir  and  38%  for  M1.  The  ritonavir  exposure 
decreased by approx. 85%. The carbamazepine study may not be worst case due to the use of single dosing of 
the DAA as there will be a time dependent inhibition and induction mediated by the DAA regimens (probably due 
to  ritonavir)  potentially  affecting  the  carbamazepine  exposure.  Strong  as  well  as  moderate  inducers  are 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014

contraindicated in the SmPC. Induction may both reduce the systemic exposures to sub therapeutic levels as 
well as increase the production of a reactive metabolite potentially leading to hepatotoxicity (see below). 
Enzyme induction: Efavirenz 
This interaction was investigated in the DDI study together with emtricitabine and tenofovir (Atripla). The study 
was terminated early due to increased transaminases. When it was terminated, the DAAs had been administered 
for 14 days alone and co-treatment with Atripla has occurred for 3 days. Terminated DDI studies between CYP3A 
inducers (efavirenz and rifampicin) due to adverse events (ALT elevations in particular) have previously been 
reported in literature: (Schmitt et al. Arch Drug Info. 2009. Jamois. Arch Drug Info. 2009. Nijland, et al. AIDS. 
2008;22:931-5.) This is further discussed in the clinical safety section. Strong as well as moderate inducers are 
contraindicated in the SmPC.  
OATP, Pgp and likely BCRP inhibition: Cyclosporine 
The effect of cyclosporine A (single dose; 10 mg or 30 mg) on the exposure to three various DAA combinations 
(at steady state) and vice versa was investigated. The DAA combinations were: 2-DAA (ABT-450/r+dasabuvir), 
2-DAA  (ABT-450/r+ombitasvir)  and  3-DAA  (ABT-450/r+ombitasvir+dasabuvir)  regimens.  The  exposure  to 
ABT-450 was increased by approximately 1.5-fold in the two DAA regimens included in the current application, 
and there was an approximate 30% reduction in the exposure dasabuvir (~20% reduction of its metabolite M1). 
The effect by CyA at steady state may be markedly higher. The reduced exposure to dasabuvir could possibly be 
caused by inhibited intestinal uptake transporters. The effect of the 3-DAA and 2-DAA on cyclosporine (CyA) 
single-dose PK was investigated. The DAAs was dosed to steady state. The dose normalised AUC of CyA was 
increased 4.3-fold by 2-DAA and 5.8-fold by 3-DAA. The effect of C24 was 3-fold higher that the effect on AUC. 
The  half-life  was  increased  from  8.7  to  9.8  hrs  (2-DAA)  indicating  that  the  major  part  of  the  DDI  is  at 
absorption/1st pass using this regimen. The half-life was increased from 7.3 to 24.5 when the 3-DAA regimen 
was administered.  
A reduction of the initial CyA dose to 1/5 of the normal daily dose is proposed in the SmPC but with a dosing 
frequency of once daily instead of twice daily. This was considered acceptable by CHMP.  
Other commonly used medicinal products: 
Oral contraceptives 
The interaction between ABT-450/r/ABT-267 with or without dasabuvir and  the COC EE + NGM (Ortho-Cyclen 
tablets) was investigated as well as  3-DAA with POP containing NET (Jolivette) and 3-DAA with COC containing 
EE + NET (Balziva) . Ortho Cyclen was administered for 21 days, Jolivette for 17 days and Balziva for 21 days. 
On  the  10th,  4  th  and  8th  day,  respectively,  the  DAA  treatment  started  and  was  continued  for  19,21  and  8 
(discontinued) days, respectively. The first and last contraceptive investigations were prematurely discontinued 
due to increased transaminases.  
ORTO CYCLEN (EN/NGM) 
The AUC24 of ABT-450 were ca. 30% reduced as 2-DAA and unchanged as 3-DAA (day 21 vs day 28) when 
combined with the COC. The exposure of ritonavir was 20-29% lower when used concomitantly with the COC 
(day  21).  Ombitasvir  was  unaffected.  AUC12  of  dasabuvir  were  ca.  50%  lower  when  dosed  with  the  COC. 
Correspondingly, M1 were similarly 37-46% reduced. 
The  exposure  of  Norelgestromin  was  increased  by  ca  160%  when  co-administered  by  2-DAA  or  3-DAA, 
respectively. AUC of norgestrel (NG) was increased by ca.150% regardless of dasabuvir co-administration. The 
Assessment report

pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol was unaffected. This treatment was discontinued. The mechanism of the 
increase in progestin is unknown (it could be UGT inhibition) as well as the reason for the lower dasabuvir, M1 
and ABT-450 exposure. 
JOLIVETTE (NET) 
The  exposure  values  of  ABT-450  were  approximately  25%  higher  (day  17  vs  24)  when  administering    NET 
(Jolivette)  POP.  The  pharmacokinetics  of  ritonavir,  ombitasvir  and  dasabuvir  was  largely  unaffected.  The 
exposure of norethindrone was somewhat reduced during the 3-DAA treatment.  
BALZIVA (EE/NET) 
This treatment was again discontinued early due to adverse events and thus the pharmacokinetic data set is 
imcomplete.  Through  concentration  comparisons  of  ritonavir  indicated  no  marked  change  in  exposure.  The 
sparse C24 data on dasabuvir and M1 did not indicate a marked increase in exposure. 
The sparse C24 data on EE did not indicate a marked change in exposure. AUC24 was increased by 22%, from 
day 7 to day 8 (only 1 day together). The effect that would be obtained at steady state is unknown. The exposure 
of norethindrone was increased (AUC at day 4 29% increased) but the full extent is unknown.  
Based on the DDI study and on clinical safety data analyses, use of EE is contraindicated. Based on avaiable 
safety data, use of other estrogens is not restricted. 
Knowing the mechanism of the decrease in DAA exposure would enable prediction of similar DDIs. At present, 
the  mechanism  is  unknown.  Up-regulation  of  hepatic  uptake  transporters  and  thereby  increased  hepatic 
exposure  (possibly  saturation  of  efflux  transporters),  with  or  without  increased  formation  of  a  reactive 
metabolite,  could  explain  both  reduced  DAA  exposure  and  higher  risk  of  hepatic  safety  issues.  Other 
mechanisms such as BSEP inhibition/down-regulation are also possible. 
Interactions causing increased transaminases: 
Increased transaminases were observed both in the efavirenz and OC interaction studies. Inhibitors of BSEP, 
such as glybenclamide, troglitazone and oestrogen have been associated with liver cholestasis (Paulis Magnus et 
al 2010). See also the pharmacogenetics section. Both ABT-450 and ritonavir have been shown to be inhibitors 
of BSEP in vitro at in vivo relevant concentrations. Dasabuvir and is also an inhibitor in vitro but at 30-fold higher 
than clinically relevant concentrations. Oestrogen and progesterone metabolites are trans-inhibitors of BSEP 
(Vallejo et al 2006). 
Testing of bile acids was performed in order to explore a possible relationship between changes in the levels of 
various bile acids in plasma and the observed changes in ALT levels. Total bile acid levels were measured as 
were the levels of ursodeoxycholic, cholic, chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acids. This testing was performed 
using available samples from subjects in Arms 1 and 2 and all subjects in Arm 4. Evaluation of these data did not 
demonstrate any trend. See also the section on pharmacogenetics. The CHMP agreed on the need to request a 
safety analysis of the risk of raised transaminases if the 3DAAS are combined with a BSEP inhibitor within a 
post-authorisation measure. The analysis of the clinical safety data with respect to concomitant use of 
drugs  that  may  inhibit  BSEP  based  on  the  EU  DDI  guideline  criteria  (50*Cmaxu/Ki≥1)  should  be 
submitted by the Applicant by March 2015.

Tacrolimus 
A  single  dose  of  tacrolimus  gave  rise  to  a  small  to  moderate  reduction  of  the  exposure  of  all  substances 
coadministered  but  ombitasvir.  This  study  was  not  designed  to  investigate  a  full  mutual  interaction,  i.e. 
obtaining steady state for all substances. An extensive accumulation is expected at multiple dose conditions of 
tacrolimus due to the quite long half-life.  Dose normalised tacrolimus AUC was increased between 57- to 86 fold 
by the 3-DAA depending on the study design. The half-life increased up to 230 h. The applicant recommends 
administration of tacrolimus every week instead of the recommended bid. This is the starting dose and will be 
followed by TDM based dose titration. The resulting plasma concentration-time course of tacrolimus will be very 
different from the usual one and the exposure level may also be very different. However, there is clinical data on 
this combination.  
Methadone 
A DDI study was conducted with subjects who were on stable methadone therapy. The study showed a minimal 
effect on the methadone exposure. Compared to historical controls presented by the applicant initially, ABT-450 
AUC was up to 90% lower. However, after gaining more pk data with the (final) formulation used in the study 
and therefore changing the historical control data, there was no clear difference in exposure as compared to the 
controls. Methadone seemed to have minimal impact on ritonavir, ABT-267, dasabuvir or M1 exposures. There 
is a marked inter-study difference in DAA exposure and using historical controls is not a satisfactory approach 
for these drugs. Methadone is an auto-inducer in vivo. Due to the difficulty in performing studies there is little in 
vivo DDI data. In conclusion nothing may be concluded regarding the potential effects of methadone on the 
DAAs. One question was posed regarding which arms to use in the comparison. This is now considered resolved. 
It  is  difficult  to  study  this  interaction  without  having  historical  controls.  There  is  some  clinical  data  on  the 
combination but the population was 95% treatment naïve, quite young and non-cirrhotic. 
Buprenorphine/naloxone 
ABT-450/r  and  ABT267  with  or  without  dasabuvir  increased  buprenorphin  AUC  by  ca  40%  (3-DAA)  or  60% 
(2-DAA). The AUC of the metabolite norbuprenorphin increased by 82% by 3-DAA and 111% by 2-DAA. No dose 
adjustment of buprenorphine is considered necessary. Comparison of DAA exposure was made with historical 
controls. This approach is not adequate for this kind of high variability situation. No marked differences in DAA 
exposure were observed.  
Zolpidem 
A single dose of zolpidem decreased the ABT-450 exposure (after 3-DAA multiple doses) by up to 37%. The 
mechanism behind this interaction is not known. There is conflicting data in the literature on whether or not 
zolpidem is a PXR activator in vitro.  If the mechanism of the DDI is time dependent there might be a larger 
effect on ABT-450 when at steady state. However, the mechanism is unknown. 
Duloxetine 
A  single  dose  of  duloxetine  exposures  were  17%  to  25%  lower  when  co-dosed  with  the  2  DAA  and  3-DAA 
regimen respectively at steady state. Duloxetine is eliminated through oxidative metabolism via CYP1A2 and, to 
a lesser degree, CYP2D6. The effect of DAAs on duloxetine might be the mild CYP1A2 induction by ritonavir. 
Furosemide 
The effect of 2-DAA and 3-DAA on furosemide pharmacokinetics (single dose) was investigated. There was no 
effect  on  furosemide  AUC  but  Cmax  was  increased  by  40%.  With  the  earlier  and  higher  furosemide  peak 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 48/119 
  
  
concentration, caution is warranted when co-administering furosemide with the 3-DAA regimen and monitoring 
of the clinical response is recommended.  
Ribavirine 
While the effects of DAAs on ribavirin and vice versa was not evaluated in Phase 1 studies, the effects were 
characterized in Phase 2 and 3 studies and analysed in the population PK analysis. The results indicated that 
DAAs did not affect ribavirin pharmacokinetics and vice versa. 
Spironolactone 
Spironolactone may be a reasonably common co-medication if 3-DAA is used in patients with advanced liver 
disease (not recommended at present). There is no DDI study with spironolactone. There are few indications of 
a  marked  effect  by  the  ABTs  on  spironolactone  as  no  CYPs  are  involved  in  its  elimination.  However 
spironolaktone is a PXR ligand and in vitro inducer (El-Sankary et al 2001, Horita et al 2014). Induction has also 
been observed in vivo in an old but well performed study (Huffman et al 1973). Furthermore spironolactone is 
a Pgp inhibitor in vivo (Volpe et al 2013, Waldorf et al 1978, Fenster et al 1984). Spironolactone also inhibits 
estrogen metabolism in vivo and it has been stipulated that this is the cause of the gynecomastia observed with 
spironolactone (Satog et al 2003). Induction could cause both reduced efficacy and possibly increased active 
metabolite formation. However, the CHMP agreed that since the paper was old and that since no induction has 
been indicated during the clinical use in all these years, this issue will not be further pursued. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Dasabuvir (ABT-333) is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which is an 
enzyme that catalyses the replication of the viral RNA. ABT-333 displays a novel mechanism of action, as the 
previously approved inhibitor of NS5B is a nucleotide analogue. 
ABT-450 (ABT-450) is an inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease which is necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the 
HCV  encoded  polyprotein  (into  mature  forms  of  the  NS3,  NS4A,  NS4B,  NS5A,  and  NS5B  proteins)  and  is 
essential for viral replication. 
Ombitasvir (ABT-267) is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A which is essential for viral replication.  
Based on EC50s, no activity against HBV or HIV is anticipated for any of these three drugs. 
Exviera contains dasabuvir (ABT-333). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
2.4.3.1.  The in vitro activity of ABT-333 
Activity in biochemical assays  
ABT-333  is  an  inhibitor  of  the  RNA-dependent  RNA  polymerase  encoded  by  the  NS5B  gene  of  HCV.  This 
compound inhibited purified recombinant NS5B polymerases derived from HCV genotype 1a and 1b isolates with 
IC50 values between 2.2 and 10.7 nM. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 49/119 
  
  
ABT-333 had IC50 values of 900 nM or greater against purified polymerases derived from HCV genotypes 2a, 
2b, 3a, and 4a isolates. Thus, the activity of ABT-333 appears specific to genotype 1. For this reason, the drug 
has not been evaluated for use in other genotypes than this. 
Activity in the replicon assay  
ABT-333 inhibited replication of HCV subgenomic replicons in cell culture assays with EC50 values of 7.7 and 1.8 
nM against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1, respectively. The M1 metabolite of ABT-333 has antiviral activity, 
albeit 7-8 fold lower than the parent compound, and shows appreciable plasma exposures (30% to 60% of the 
parent drug). 
ABT-333 had a TD50 of 10,360 nM in an MTT cytotoxicity assay, producing a therapeutic index that exceeded 
1345-fold. 
2.4.3.2.  The in vitro activity of ABT-450 
Activity in biochemical assays 
ABT-450 is an inhibitor of the protease encoded by the NS3 and NS4A (cofactor) genes of HCV. This compound 
inhibited activity of purified NS3/4A protease enzymes from genotypes 1a, 1b and 4a with IC50 values between 
0.16 and 0.43 nM. 
For the purified NS3/4A protease enzymes derived from HCV genotypes 2a, 2b and 3a isolates, the IC 50 values 
were 2.4 to 14.5 nM. 
Activity in the replicon assay 
ABT-450 inhibited replication of HCV subgenomic replicons in cell culture assays with EC50 values of 1.0 and 
0.21 nM against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1, respectively. The EC50 value of ABT-450 against stable cell line 
replicons  containing  the  NS3  genes  from  HCV  genotype  3a,  4a  or  6a  was  19  nM,  0.09  nM  or  0.68  nM, 
respectively;  and  the  EC50  against  the  2a  JFH-1  strain  replicon  was  5.3  nM.  The  lower  activity  seen  for 
macrocyclic NS3/4A inhibitors against genotype 3 is likely due to a conserved polymorphism at 168 position in 
NS3/4A which confers lower viral susceptibility. 
ABT-450 had a median toxic dose (TD50) of 37,000 nM in an MTT cytotoxicity assay, producing a therapeutic 
index that exceeded 37,000-fold. 
2.4.3.3.  The in vitro activity of ABT-267 
As there is no known enzymatic function of NS5A, no studies with biochemical assays were reported. 
Activity in the replicon assay 
ABT-267 inhibited replication of HCV subgenomic replicons in cell culture assays with EC50 values of 14 pM and 
5 pM against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1, respectively.  
The EC50 value of ABT-267 against stable cell line replicons containing NS5A from HCV genotypes 2a, 2b, 3a, 
4a, 5a or 6a was 12.4, 4.3, 19.3, 1.7, 3.2 or 366 pM, respectively. 
The relatively similar EC50 values for all major HCV genotypes are noted. It is likely that ABT-267 might have 
been a valuable drug for the treatment of genotype 3; however, it will only be available co-formulated with a 
Assessment report

NS3/4A inhibitor with significantly reduced activity against this genotype (see above). Also, the lower activity 
against genotype 6a is noted. The molecular background for this has not been clarified. 
ABT-267  had  a  TD50  of  >  32,000,000  pM  in  an  MTT  cytotoxicity  assay,  producing  a  therapeutic  index  that 
exceeded 2 million-fold. 
2.4.3.4.  In vitro selection of drug resistance 
HCV  subgenomic  replicon  cell  lines  were  passaged  in  the  presence  of  ABT-450,  ABT-267  or  ABT-333.  The 
resistance variants selected in HCV genotype 1a-H77 or 1b-Con1 cell lines by these compounds were cloned into 
the  respective  subgenomic  replicon,  and  the  EC50  and  EC90  values  of  ABT-450,  ABT-267  or  ABT-333  were 
evaluated.  In  addition,  variants  reported  as  being  selected  by  other  NS3/4A  protease,  NS5A  or  NS5B 
polymerase inhibitors were also analysed. 
Resistance selection in genotypes 1a and -1b 
The  following  major  variants  in  HCV  NS3  were  observed  in  HCV  subgenomic  replicon  cell  lines  treated  with 
ABT-450: R155K, D168E, and D168N in 1a-H77; and R155Q, A156T, A156V, D168H and D168V in 1b-Con1. As 
is typical for a macrocyclic inhibitor of NS3/4A, ABT-450 selects for resistant variants at positions 155 and 168, 
which confer significant fold-changes in susceptibility (see below). This confirms that the virology of ABT-450 is 
relatively similar to that of simeprevir. 
Notably, the substitutions at positions 155 and 168 confer higher fold-changes 37-fold for R155K;13-219-fold 
for mutations in 168 position and likely significant resistance. The prevalent  Q80K mutation in genotype 1a 
confers a fold-change of 3. For simeprevir, another macrocyclic inhibitor of NS3/4A, the fold-change for Q80K 
was less than 10; still this variant was associated with lower clinical efficacy, presumably due to an impaired 
barrier to further resistance. 
The following major variants in HCV NS5A were observed in HCV subgenomic replicon cell lines treated with 
ABT-267:    M28T,  M28V,  Q30R,  Y93C,  and  Y93H  in  1a-H77;  and  L28T,  L31F,  L31V  and  Y93H  alone  or  in 
combination with L28M, R30Q or L31F/V in 1b-Con1. The selection of variants at positions 28, 30, 31 and 93, as 
well  as  the  susceptibility  changes  seen  indicate  full  cross  resistance  between  ABT-267  and  daclatasvir  and 
ledipasvir.  The  high  fold-changes  for  resistance  associated  mutations  at  28,  30  and  93  in  genotype  1a  is  a 
feature shared with daclatasvir and ledipasvir. Further, similar to these drugs, the barrier to resistance is higher 
in genotype 1b compared to 1a, with two mutations required to conceive very high fold-changes in -1b versus 
one in -1a. 
The following major variants in HCV NS5B were observed in HCV subgenomic replicon cell lines treated with 
ABT-333: C316Y, M414T, Y448H and S556G in both genotypes 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 replicons. Based on the 
fold-changes for single mutations (up to 5000-fold), ABT-333 is anticipated to be a drug with a low barrier to 
resistance in both genotype 1a and -1b. The lack of impact on susceptibility of the S282T mutation is notable, 
and indicative of the anticipated lack of cross resistance with nucleos(t)ide analogue inhibitors of NS5B. 
2.4.3.5.  Clinical drug resistance 
The main method used to detect resistant variants was population sequencing. No next-generation sequencing 
data has been presented; this, however, is no regulatory requirement. The regions encoding NS3 amino acids 1 
– 360, NS5A amino acids 1 – 215, and NS5B amino acids 300 – 591 were sequenced.

The  primary  virologic  failure  (PVF)  population  consists  of  patients  in  the  phase  2  and  3  program  who  were 
randomized  to  active  therapy  and  who  experienced  on-treatment  virological  failure  (failure  to  suppress,  or 
on-treatment virological rebound) or who relapsed after end of therapy were included. As a control group, to 
assess the impact of baseline polymorphic variants on outcome, there were baseline samples sequenced from 
patients achieving SVR in the large phase IIb AVIATOR study (M11-652) as well as some other phase II studies. 
For  the  six  phase  3  studies,  samples  were  sequenced  from  baseline  and  time  of  failure  for  those  who  had 
rebound or relapse. In addition to that additional baseline samples were included from a subset of patients who 
achieved SVR (i.e. 2 SVR-achieving patients for every 1 PVF patient matched for HCV subtype, IL28B genotype, 
baseline HCV RNA, and sex to the extent possible). 
Resistance variants (RAVs) seen at baseline 
Below follow summary tables of all baseline RAVs detected by population sequencing in the population described

The high frequency of NS3 Q80K is anticipated, particularly in US patients with genotype 1a. Baseline mutations 
at positions 155 and 168 are rare. The reported frequency of NS5A mutations at baseline is roughly similar to 
that seen in other DAA development programs (approx. 15%). Approximately 5% of samples showed baseline 
resistance relevant to ABT-333.

As  anticipated,  baseline  NS3  resistance  in  genotype  1b  is  rare.  The  frequency  of  NS5A  Y93H  is  similar  to 
previous reports. Mutations impacting the susceptibility to ABT-333 are relatively common (>18%). 
BL RAVs and impact on outcome 
As the virological failure rate was very low in genotype 1b, the following discussion focuses on genotype 1a. 
No strong correlations between baseline resistant variants and outcomes were found, as shown in the following 
table. Please note that this table is an extract only including patients of the PVF population who were treated 
with the 3DAA regimen, +/- RBV. Also note that the table indicates the proportion of patients with a certain 
mutation among those failing virologically and those achieving SVR, respectively.

Notably, the Q80K mutation (very prevalent with GT1a-infection) was overrepresented in baseline samples from 
patients  who  did  not  achieve  SVR  in  the  population.  However,  response  rates  were  still  above  90%  among 
patients receiving at least 12 weeks of therapy (see table below).

Note:  Observed data SVR 24 rates exclude subjects who do not achieve SVR 24 due to premature discontinuation of study 
drug or missing data in the SVR 24 window as Q80K variants at baseline are unlikely to contribute to premature 
discontinuation from study drug or study. 
All in all, as most patients that failed virologically did not have RAVs at baseline conferring significant resistance 
to the DAAs, one may speculate further on the reasons for failure. For instance, one may wonder whether a more 
sensitive assay for detecting baseline RAVs might yield further prognostic information. This issue was raised 
during the approval procedure of another macrocyclic NS3/4A inhibitor showing a similar resistance pattern as 
that of ABT-450, and therefore being essentially virologically similar. However, next generation sequencing with 
a sensitivity threshold of 1% (as opposed to approximately 20% for population sequencing), did not identify a 
substantial  further  proportion  of  patients  with  detectable  resistant  variants  at  baseline.  Furthermore,  for 
another NS5A inhibitor, there was no impact on outcome of resistant variants at baseline detectable by next 
generation sequencing at a population proportion of less than 20%. In summary, baseline resistance testing is 
not anticipated to be of utility for guiding the use of the present DAA combo. 
Resistance at time of failure 
The following table is a summary for resistance at time of failure, for patients with rebound or relapse in the 
phase 3 studies. The vast majority failing therapy had genotype 1a (those with genotype 1b are indicated in 
column 3).  
The table only includes RAVs that would be considered as primary (i.e. RAVs with more profound effects on 
susceptibility), to somewhat simplify. Therefore, when no RAVs are indicated, this may be either none detected, 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014

or  RAVs  associated  with  a  low  FC  (or  where  the  FC  has  not  been  determined).  Hence,  the  table  somewhat 
underestimates treatment emergent resistant variants.

This table demonstrates that close to all patients fail with resistance to both the NS3A/4 and the NS5A class, and 
around  half  of  the  patients  fail  with  a  virus  also  resistant  to  dasabuvir.  The  lower  frequency  of  dasabuvir 
resistance is likely due to a lower selective pressure due to lower potency; a  similar phenomenon is seen if

comparing the risk of NS3/4A resistance on failure with telaprevir and boceprevir. The primary NS3/4A- and 
NS5A-RAVs that are seen confer cross resistance to other available agents of these classes. 
Persistence of selected resistant variants 
The  persistence  of  emerged  variants  was  evaluated  in  Phase  2  Studies  M12-998,  M13-386,  M12-746,  and 
M11-652. The table below shows RAVs associated with a larger FC (i.e. those shown in the preceding tables). 
Data is lacking for genotype 1b due to the low number of such treatment failures.

As can be seen, while the proportion of follow up sample with detectable NS3/4A mutations decline over 48 
weeks  of  post  treatment  follow-up,  the  proportion  of  samples  with  NS5A  and  NS5B  resistance  remains 
stationary. The findings of NS3/4A as well as NS5A are in accordance with previous reports after non-curative 
exposure to these classes. The persistence of selected resistance mutations to non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitors 
has previously been less well characterised. 
All in all, these data illustrate the problem of what would be the appropriate retreatment regimen in those few 
patients that fail virologically on a combination of three drugs from different classes, all of which have a low 
barrier to resistance. 
2.4.3.6.  Thorough QT study 
Study M12-680 was a thorough QT study of the combination of ABT-450, ritonavir, ABT-267, and ABT-333 in 
healthy adults conducted to support the Phase 3 program. This placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 
400 mg) study evaluated therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of the DAAs, as shown below: 
• 
Therapeutic doses:  ABT-450 200 mg SDD + ritonavir 150 mg + ABT-267 25 mg + ABT-333 250 mg 
•  Supratherapeutic doses:  ABT-450 350 mg SDD + ritonavir 150 mg + ABT 267 50 mg + ABT-333 500 
mg 
Mean Cmax values with the supratherapeutic doses were 6.3-fold (ABT-450), 1.8-fold (ABT-267), and 2-fold 
(ABT-333) compared to Cmax values from the to-be-marketed formulation of ABT-450/r/ABT-267 150/100/25 
mg  +  ABT-333  250  mg.  No  subject  in  this  study  experienced  QT  interval  corrected  for  heart  rate  using

Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) interval values > 450 msec or changes from baseline > 30 msec when 
receiving a therapeutic or supratherapeutic dose of the 3-DAA combination. 
There is a minor QTc effect which is not considered clinically relevant. As discussed below, in the context of the 
dose ranging of ABT-333, this effect is likely due to that particular DAA. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Basic PK characteristics 
Dasabuvir has a high bioavailability and a moderate absorption rate. Intake of food increases the absorption and 
dasabuvir should be taken 30 minutes after starting a meal. This is the same recommendation as used in the 
majority of studies. The formulation development is bridged well through bioequivalence studies.  
Dasabuvir  is  eliminated  through  metabolism  to  M1  catalysed  by  CYP2C8  and,  to  some  extent  CYP3A4.  The 
CYP3A4  is  likely  reduced  when  dasabuvir  is  administered  as  3-DAA.  The  metabolite  M1  is  active  and  likely 
contributes to the target pharmacological effects obtained with dasabuvir. The metabolite is present at about 
half the plasma concentration of dasabuvir but is much less protein bound and therefore its free exposure is 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 57/119 
 
 
  
  
6-fold higher than the free exposure of dasabuvir. M1 is eliminated through biliary excretion, glucuronidation 
and, to a minor extent, oxidation. 
Intrinsic factors affecting 3-DAA exposure 
There are few intrinsic factors identified that affect the exposure of the DAAs to a clinically relevant extent.  
The AUC of dasabuvir was 4.2-fold increased in severe hepatic impairment but was not much affected by mild 
and moderate disease. M1 was 57% decreased and 76% increased in moderate and severe hepatic impairment, 
respectively. There was no increase in fu vs degree of impairment. Due to lack of clinical data, a posology for 
moderate hepatic impairment is not given in the SPC. 
The  AUC  of  dasabuvir  was  97,  38  and  47%  increased  in  mild  moderate  and  severe  renal  impairment, 
respectively. For M1 the AUC was 39 and 28 decreased in mild and moderate renal impairment while it was 34% 
decreased in severe impairment.  
There is little data in patients older than 65 years and no PK data in patients over 75 years. Women had ca. 30% 
higher exposures than men. The applicant has performed extensive pharmacogenetic analysis on PK related 
genes but no polymorphism was identified as important. The analysis may not be sensitive enough due to the 
high  inter-study  variability.  Polymorphism  in  the  gene  coding  for  BSEP  and  the  relation  to  increased 
transaminases has also been investigated. The results were unclear. 
Extrinsic factors affecting 3-DAA exposure 
The applicant has submitted an extensive DDI data package with in vitro and in vivo studies. In the in vivo DDI 
studies, all DAAs are included and the net effect is observed. This is satisfactory as it is the clinical situation, but 
sometimes hinders mechanistic conclusions, in particular combining with such a DDI prone drug as ritonavir. 
The DDIs with ritonavir are time-dependent and the drug affects a large number of proteins. Thus, mutual time 
dependent interactions are expected. However, the study design does not always takes this into account and the 
estimated steady state effects and their uncertainty needs to be discussed.  
Dasabuvir interactions 
The available in vitro data indicate that dasabuvir (or M1) may inhibit UGT1A1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, BCRP 
and Pgp. In the in vivo studies these proteins are also all inhibited by the 3-DAA combination. However, there 
are other components in the 3-DAA regimen which also inhibits these proteins. Thus, dasabuvir may contribute 
and  not  be  solely  responsible  for  these  effects.  Sometimes,  the  effect  of  ABT-450  and  ombitasvir  has  been 
investigated with and without dasabuvir. In this situation, an indication about the effect of dasabuvir could be 
observed although it should be remembered that introducing dasabuvir also gives rise to an about 50% increase 
in ABT-450. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 58/119 
 
 
  
  
The applicant has tabled some of the differing results below. 
The results in the DDI rosuvastatin study indicates that it is dasabuvir which gives the major part of the BCRP 
inhibition effect. This effect is probably causing the interaction effect on dasabuvir on ABT-450 as well. 
3-DAA interactions 
The  available  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies  indicate  the  following  effects  of  the  3-DAA  combination: 
time-dependent  CYP3A  inhibition,  CYP2C19  induction,  UGT1A1  inhibition,  BCRP  inhibition,  P-gp  inhibition, 
OATP1B1 and 1B3 inhibition, induction of PXR inducible enzymes is also expected. Effects by other drugs on the 
DAAs  are  expected  by  BCRP  inhibitors  and  CYP3A4  inhibitors  and  enzyme  inducers  (ABT-450)  and  CYP2C8 
inhibitors and enzyme inducers (dasabuvir). The elimination of ombitasvir seems to be mainly biliary excretion. 
The  interaction  effects  observed  affecting  ombitasvir  exposure  are  very  small and  involved  transporters not 
identified. 
Increased  transaminases  have  been  observed  in  the  DDI  study  with  oral  contraceptives  in  arms  containing 
ethinyl  estradiol  (EE).  There  is  also  a  signal  of  increased  hepatotoxicity  in  EE  treated  patients  in  phase  III. 
Furthermore, increased transaminases have been observed in a DDI study with efavirenz. BSEP inhibition may 
be one mechanism, hepatic accumulation of a toxic metabolite another possibility. A post-authorisation measure 
has been performed to follow up one of the theories (the analysis of clinical safety data when combined with 
BSEP inhibitors). Available phase III data does not indicate a raised risk of increased transaminases in patients 
treated with other systemic oestrogens (see section on clinical safety). 
In the submitted drug interaction study with ketoconazole only a single dose of 3DAA is administered. Potent 
CYP3A4 inhibition was reached as the ketoconazole exposure was increased by the 3DAAs. A somewhat higher 
effect could be reached as steady state but the net effect is difficult to predict. More marked effects (up to a 
6-fold change instead of the 2-fold increase observed with ketoconazole) have been observed by lopinavir/r and 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 59/119 
 
  
  
atazanavir/r.  This  may  be  due  to  dual  inhibition  of  CYP3A  and  transport  proteins  (such  as  OATP1B1  and 
BCRP).The elimination of ABT-450 has not been elucidated and two post-authorisation measures are present to 
clarify the major elimination pathways (see CHMP AR for Viekirax). 
There is no drug interaction study with the usually recommended probe drug midazolam. The studies submitted 
involve less sensitive CYP3A substrates. Thus classification, which is usually based on the effect on midazolam, 
is  not  straight  forward,  neither  of  course  how  potent  effects  should  be  expected  by  3-DAA  on  CYP3A4 
metabolised drugs. The 3-DAA combination is classified as strong CYP3A inhibitor. 
Other important issues involve specific drug combinations and the clinical relevance interpretation of observed 
effects of darunavir, atazanavir, methadone, weak and moderate enzyme inducers, etc. Potent CYP3A inhibitors 
are  contraindicated  due  to  expected  marked  increases  in  exposure  and  inducers  can  give  rise  to  both 
subtherapeutic levels and increased hepatotoxicity (This is discussed in more detail in the Viekirax AR.) 
Spironolactone may be a common co-medication if 3DAA is used in patients with advanced liver disease. Some 
indications of spironolactone being an inducer were observed in the literature but there is no signal from the long 
therapeutic use and therefore this will not be further pursued. 
ABT-333  is  the  first  non-nucleoside  inhibitor  of  the  viral  NS5B  polymerase  to  undergo  European  regulatory 
evaluation. It has nanomolar EC50s against genotype 1, but is likely not effective against other genotypes. It 
has a low barrier to resistance. The primary NS5B variant selected on failure is S556G. 
ABT-450 shows protein binding adjusted EC50 values in replicon assays for genotypes 1a, -1b and 4 in the low 
nanomolar range. Similar to other macrocyclic NS3/4A inhibitors, it selects for resistance at positions 155 and 
168  in  the  protease.  ABT-450  has  a  low  to  moderate  barrier  to  resistance;  in  case  of  virological  failure, 
treatment emergent resistant variants are seen in most patients. 
ABT-267  shows  picomolar  EC50s  across  genotypes.  As  typical  of  its  class,  this  drug  has  a  low  barrier  to 
resistance and selects for resistant variants at NS5A positions 28, 30 and 93. 
A  combination  through  QTc  study  including  supratherapeutic  doses  of  each  DAA  did  not  show  any  clinically 
relevant impact on the QTc interval. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There  are  no  major  issues  on  pharmacokinetics.  An  important  aspect  is  the  DDI  with  ethinyl  estradiol  and 
efavirenz  giving  rise  to  increased  transaminases  –  both  regarding  what  treatment  recommendations  are 
important  and  what  could  be  a  likely  mechanism,  attempting  to  predict  other  scenarios  at  risk.  A 
post-authorisation measure has been requested to follow up one of the theories (the analysis of clinical safety 
data when combined with BSEP inhibitors, to be submitted by the Applicant by March 2015).  
Multiple class resistance in patients failing therapy with this regimen may have important consequences on any 
further treatment attempts. This is a major risk associated with the use of this 3DAA combination, which should 
be  followed  prospectively  as  specified  in  the  RMP.  The  clinical  consequence  of  treatment  failure  is  a  most 
important issue to integrate to the discussion of optimal regimens and treatment durations, in particular for 
patients with cirrhosis (discussed further in the efficacy section).

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Formulation issues 
As a preamble, it is noted that the formulations used in earlier trials and in phase III were not fully bioequivalent. 
The  following  introduction  serves  to  clarify  this  background  to  the  dose  selection  process.  The  doses  and 
formulations of the DAAs used for all Phase 3 studies are presented in the table below. 
The formulations of the 3 DAAs used in Phase 2 studies were different than those used in Phase 3 studies. The 
doses and formulations of the DAAs used for the Phase 2 studies are presented in Table 68. 
ABT-450 exposure was about 60% higher with the phase III formulation compared to that used in phase II. Note 
that ABT-450 kinetics are non-linear with a non-proportional increase in exposure with increased dose.  
ABT-267, ABT-333 and ritonavir exposures from the Phase 3 formulations were comparable to the formulations 
used in Phase 2 studies. However, the dose of ABT-333 in the phase 3 formulation was lower, as bioavailability 
of ABT-333 was higher compared to the phase 2 formulation. ABT-333 exposures from the ABT-333 250 mg 
tablet formulation used in the Phase 3 studies were bioequivalent to the ABT-333 400 mg tablets used in the 
Phases 2 studies. It is furthermore notable that the phase 2 formulation of ABT-333 differed from that used in 
the monotherapy study (see below). 
The dose selection of ABT-333 
The antiviral activity of ABT-333 as monotherapy and in combination with pegIFN and RBV has been evaluated 
in three Phase 1b/2 studies (Studies M10-351, M10-380, and M11-602). Monotherapy doses of 100, 600, and 
1200 mg QD and 100, 300, 400, 600, and 800 mg BID were assessed. In combination with pegIFN and RBV, 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 61/119 
 
 
  
  
doses of 300 and 600 mg BID and 1200 mg QD were evaluated for up to 4 weeks while doses of 400 and 800 mg 
BID were evaluated for up to 12 weeks followed by pegIFN and RBV for up to 48 weeks.  
In Study M10-380, ABT-333 doses of 300 mg BID (N = 8), 600 mg BID (N = 8), and 1200 mg QD (N = 8) showed 
similar antiviral activity when dosed as monotherapy for 2 days (1.01, 0.78, 0.68 log10 IU/mL decline at 300 mg 
BID, 600 mg BID and 1200 mg QD, respectively), followed by 26 days of coadministration with pegIFN and RBV 
(3.65, 3.96, and 3.59 log10 IU/mL decline at 300 mg BID, 600 mg BID, and 1200 mg QD, respectively). The 
potency of ABT-333 is low relative to DAAs of other classes. It does not appear possible to reach a drug exposure 
that covers the fold-change in EC50 of treatment-emergent single mutants (also see pharmacodynamics section 
above). 
In combination with pegIFN and RBV, the 800 mg BID dose was associated with a greater mean hemoglobin 
reduction (4.2 g/dL decrease at Week 12) compared to the 400 mg BID dose (2.4 g/dL at Week 12) and placebo 
plus pegIFN and RBV (2.3 g/dL decrease at Week 12).  Thus, higher doses of ABT-333 caused an additive effect 
to the anaemia seen with peginterferon+RBV. Furthermore, higher ABT-333 exposures were associated with a 
higher QT interval (corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula [QTcF]) in the first-in-human study (Study 
M10-351).  Thus,  ABT-333  likely  exerts  an  exposure-dependent  impact  on  the  QTc  interval,  and  is  likely 
responsible  for  the  small  QT  increase  seen  in  the  combination  QT  study.  (see  above  section  on 
pharmacodynamics  for  the  discussion).  However,  the  magnitude  of  this  effect  at  the  selected  dose  is  not 
clinically relevant. 
ABT-333 has an elimination half-life of about 5 to 8 hours, conducive to BID dosing. All in all, it appears that the 
selected dose should yield exposures at the proximal end of the Emax plateau, in terms of effect against virus 
with wild-type susceptibility. 
The dose selection of ribavirin 
The daily dose of RBV used in Phase 3 studies was 1,000 or 1,200 mg, divided BID, and based on subject weight. 
This dose is approved for treatment of adult patients with chronic HCV infection in combination with pegIFN by 
itself and pegIFN with telaprevir or boceprevir and others. The selection of the dose of 1000/1200 mg ribavirin 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 62/119 
 
 
 
  
  
when used in interferon-free DAA combinations has become standard. This dose has previously been shown to 
have a generally acceptable safety profile and to provide the possibility of dose reduction in case of significant 
anaemia without any loss of efficacy. 
2.6.  The selection of treatment regimens for phase III 
The main study to inform regimen selection for phase III was M11-652, also termed AVIATOR. 
This was a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, combination treatment study of multiple doses of ABT-450/r, and 
ABT-267  and/or  ABT-333  with  or  without  RBV  in  non-cirrhotic  HCV  genotype  1-infected  treatment-naïve 
subjects and previous null responders to pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and RBV treatment. 
The study consisted of a  Treatment Period of 8, 12, or 24 weeks and a  Follow-up Period for sustained viral 
response and resistance monitoring for 48 weeks.  
For each arm, dosing was as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 63/119 
 
  
  
Ribavirin was dosed at 1000/1200 mg per day depending on body weight below or above 75 kg. 
Subjects were HCV-infected, non-cirrhotic, treatment-naïve or prior null responders to pegIFN+RBV. Patients 
with HBV or HIV coinfection were excluded. For a definition of null response, see below under the heading “main 
efficacy studies”. The selection of previous null responders provides an enrichment of patients known to be on 
the  difficult  to  cure  end  of  the  scale;  thus,  the  population  is  presumed  to  bracket  the  range  of  innate  host 
responses to support direct acting antiviral effects. 
In terms of defining the appropriate regimen the study contains comparisons of  
•  Duration: 8 versus 12 versus 24 weeks of therapy. 
•  ABT-450 doses: 100 versus 150 versus 200 mg of ABT-450 used for 12 weeks, and 100 versus 150 mg 
of ABT-450 used for 24 weeks.  
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 64/119 
 
  
  
•  Combinations  of  drugs:  ABT-450+ABT-333+RBV  versus  ABT-450+ABT-267+RBV  versus 
ABT-450+ABT-267+ABT-333 versus ABT-450 +ABT-267 + ABT-333+RBV when used for 12 weeks.  
Thus,  the  AVIATOR  study  forms  quite  a  complex  investigation  of  different  regimen  possibilities.  In  terms  of 
regimens not studied, it is notable that there are no 2DAA regimens without RBV. Thus, there is no way, within 
this study, of directly assessing the impact of the third agent on overall regimen efficacy. 
Overall, SVR24 was achieved in 89.7% of treatment-naïve subjects and 92.5% of prior null responders overall. 
The further analysis of this study, however, is conducted along the lines of its informing on adequate regimens 
in genotypes 1a and -1b respectively.

While the response rates are generally impressive, the lower efficacy in genotype 1a compared to -1b is notable. 
This is due to a lower potency and/or barrier to resistance for all the three DAAs against genotype 1a. 
Conclusions regarding treatment duration 
Comparison  of  relapse  rates  between  arms  is  particularly  relevant  when  assessing  the  impact  of  treatment 
duration.  Among  treatment-naïve  subjects  receiving  3  DAAs  +  RBV,  10/80  relapsed  following  8  weeks  of 
treatment in Group A, compared with 1/79 following 12 weeks of treatment in Groups [F + G] and 3/78 following 
24 weeks of treatment in Groups [H + I], 2 of which discontinued treatment prematurely. The difference in 
response  rates  between  8  and  12  weeks'  duration  was  driven  primarily  by  the  subjects  with  genotype  1a 
infection, as there was only 1 virologic failure in Group A and  none in Groups  [F + G] among subjects with 
genotype 1b infection. There were no relapses among null responders treated with 3 DAAs+RBV for 12  [K + L] 
or 24 [M + N] weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 65/119 
 
 
  
  
Based on the higher relapse rate with 8 weeks duration, and the lack of a difference between 12 and 24 weeks, 
12 weeks was chosen as the standard duration in the phase III studies. 24 weeks of therapy was also studied in 
the TURQUOISE-II trial, dedicated to compensated cirrhotics. Such patients are now known to require a longer 
treatment duration on average than do non-cirrhotics. Furthermore, there were no cirrhotics in the AVIATOR 
study. 
Conclusions regarding the dose of ABT-450 
No significant differences were seen in SVR12 rates among subjects treated with the same regimen, but with 
different  ABT-450/r  doses  (100/100  mg  versus  150/100  mg  or  100/100  mg  versus  200/100  mg).  Overall 
efficacy was therefore not a driver of ABT-450/r dose selection for Phase 3. Instead, selection of the ABT-450/r 
dose was based on resistance and safety analyses. These concerns are described above, under the heading on 
dose selection. 
Conclusions regarding the contribution of ABT-267 to regimen efficacy 
The comparison of the SVR24 rate in Group B (no ABT-267) and groups treated with 3 DAAs + RBV for 12 weeks 
was used to assess the contribution of ABT-267 to the treatment response. When Group B was compared with 
Group G (same ABT-450/r dose), the difference of 11.64% was not statistically significant (P = 0.141). When 
Group  B  was  compared  with  Groups  [F  +  G],  the  difference  of  13.15%  showed  a  trend  toward  statistical 
significance (P = 0.056). The difference in response rates was driven by the subjects with genotype 1a infection, 
as there were no virologic failures in these groups among subjects with genotype 1b infection. 
Conclusions regarding the contribution of ABT-333 to regimen efficacy 
Comparison of the SVR24 rate in groups that did not receive ABT-333 and groups treated with 3 DAAs + RBV for 
12  weeks  was  used  to  assess  the  contribution  of  ABT-333  to  the  treatment  response.  When  Group  C  was 
compared with Group F (treatment-naïve, same ABT-450/r dose), the difference of 13.31% showed a trend 
toward statistical significance (P = 0.090), which persisted when Groups [C + D] were compared with Groups [F 
+ G] (P = 0.090) and when Groups [C + D + J] were compared with Groups [F + G + K + L] (P = 0.065). Once 
again, the difference in responses was driven by genotype 1a –infected subjects, as there were no failures in 
these groups among genotype 1b-infected subjects. 
Conclusions regarding the contribution of ribavirin to regimen efficacy 
The comparison of the SVR24 rate in Group E (no RBV) and groups treated with 3 DAAs + RBV for 12 weeks was 
used to assess the contribution of RBV to the treatment response. When Group E was compared with Group G 
(same ABT-450/r dose), the difference of 6.88% was not statistically significant (P = 0.262). When Group E was 
compared with Groups [F + G], the difference of 8.03% showed a trend toward statistical significance (P = 
0.089). Again, the difference in response rates was driven by the subjects with genotype 1a infection, as there 
were no virologic failures in these groups among subjects with genotype 1b infection. 
Comments on the selection of the combination regimen 
ABT-450 is the most potent antiviral agent in the combination, but cannot be used as monotherapy due to its 
insufficient barrier to resistance. 
In a very small sample in study M12-998, the SVR  rate with ABT-450(r)+ABT267 given without ribavirin to 
patients with genotype 1a virus was 5/8 (62.5%). Data from the AVIATOR study indicate the contribution of 
each of the 3DAAs to regimen efficacy against genotype 1a.

Concerning genotype 1b, the dual DAA combo of ABT-450(r) + ABT-267 is being studied in the ongoing PEARL-1 
(M13-393) study, as well as in the M12-539 study. The virological failure rate seen when only ABT-450(r) + 
ABT267  was  given  to  treatment  experienced  patients  with  genotype  1b  infection,  under  two  different  study 
protocols, is reported at 6.6% (5/76).

In  the  PEARL-1  study,  there  were  no  virological  failures  with  this  combination  among  42  treatment  naïve, 
non-cirrhotic patients. Despite the latter, these outcomes would further support an incremental effect of a third 
agent  also  in  an  unselected  treatment  naïve  population  with  genotype  1b,  as  a  wide  such  group  would  be 
anticipated to contain such patients as in a peginterferon+ribavirin cohort, the only difference being that these 
have not been exposed to these drugs (about half of a treatment naïve genotype 1 cohort would not be cured if 
treated with peginterferon+ribavirin only, and 10-20% would be “null responders”). 
The preliminary data on the efficacy of the dual combination in genotype 1b receive external support from an 
analogous  drug  development  program,  indicating  that  the  efficacy  of  this  combination  would  likely  be 
considerable, though not optimised. A similar argument goes for the combination of ABT-450+ABT-333, though 
due  to  the  lower  potency  of  ABT-333,  the  efficacy  of  this  combination  would  likely  be  lower  than  for  the 
ABT-450+ABT-267 combination. 
Based on such considerations, as well as the apparent tolerability of the regimen, the company proceeded to 
study only the triple DAA combination in phase III. The value of the addition of ribavirin was studied in three 
trials including non-cirrhotic patients. The choice of comparing 3DAA versus 3DAA + RBV, rather than, e.g., 
ABT-450 + ABT267+ RBV versus 3DAA+RBV was informed by safety data indicating a favourable safety profile 
of  ABT-333  compared  to  RBV  (see  discussion  of  clinical  safety)  Furthermore,  in  the  phase  III  trial 
(TURQOUISE-II) dedicated to compensated cirrhotics, all patients received RBV, and a comparison was made 
between 12 and 24 weeks of therapy. 
2.6.1.  Main studies 
The applicant has performed six phase III studies in patients with genotype 1a and -1b virus. Five of these were 
in non-cirrhotic patients, whereas one was dedicated to patients with compensated cirrhosis. Furthermore, the 
applicant has submitted four supportive studies performed in post-transplant patients with genotype 1 virus that

do not have advanced fibrosis, in patients with genotype 1 virus that are on opiate substitution, and in patients 
with genotype 1 infection that have HIV co-infection.

In this table, 3-DAA refers to ABT-450/r/ABT-267 (150/100/25 mg QD) + ABT-333 (250 mg BID). In all studies, 
ribavirin was dosed at 1000/1200 mg per day with body weight below or above 75 kg. 
2.6.1.1.  General design features for the phase 3 studies 
There are two studies where 12 weeks of 3DAA+RBV therapy is compared to placebo (SAPPHIRE I and –II). As 
the anticipated SVR rate in the placebo group is 0, the purpose of this comparison is exclusively the evaluation 
of safety. 
There are three studies where 12 weeks of 3DAA+RBV is compared to 12 weeks of 3DAAs (PEARL-II, PEARL-III, 
PEARL-IV) 
The  above  studies  included  non-cirrhotic  patients  with  genotype  1a  or  -1b infection.  Requirements  for  prior 
treatment  history  varied  (see  below).  Patients  with  prior  exposure  to other  direct  acting  antivirals  were  not 
studied. 
There is one study where 12 weeks and 24 weeks of 3DAA+RBV are compared in patients with compensated 
cirrhosis (TURQUOISE-II). These patients could have genotype 1a or -1b virus, and could either be treatment 
naïve or having previously failed on pegIFN+RBV therapy. 
The following stratification factors were used in the studies:  
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014

•  HCV genotype (1a vs. 1b) when applicable 
• 
• 
IL-28 genotype (CC vs. non-CC) for the treatment naïve groups. 
Type of prior response (null – or partial responders, or relapse), and referring to prior therapy with 
peg-IFN + RBV.  
The definitions of prior response to peginterferon+ribavirin where those generally accepted and in accordance 
with regulatory guidance: 
•  Null responder: failed to achieve a 2 log10 reduction in HCV RNA (IU/mL) at Week 12; or > 1 log10 
reduction at Week 4 (≥ 25 days). 
• 
Partial responder: achieved ≥ 2 log10 IU/mL reduction in HCV RNA at Week 12, but still had detectable 
HCV-RNA at end of treatment (minimum 20 weeks). 
•  Relapser: undetectable at or after the end of at least 36 weeks of treatment, but relapsed within 52 
weeks of treatment follow-up. 
Main inclusion/exclusion criteria 
The major inclusion/exclusion criteria are implied in each of the study titles. These pertain to the subgenotype 
of the virus and to the patient being treatment naïve or having previously been treated with peginterferon+RBV. 
Furthermore cirrhosis was either an exclusion criterion or an inclusion criterion for each of the pivotal studies. 
These are the definitions used to determine cirrhosis as an inclusion criterion (study M13-099), or to exclude 
cirrhosis (the other five pivotal trials).

Note: 1 method was sufficient. A non-qualifying FibroTest/APRI or FibroScan could be overruled by a qualifying 
liver biopsy. 
The methods and limits used to determine cirrhosis status have been accepted by regulators. Any of the three 
methods could be used to rule out cirrhosis (in accordance with local practice). With regards to fibroscan results, 
a kPA of <9.6 kPa would in fact also rule out many patients with METAVIR F3, creating an enrichment of patients 
with mild or moderate fibrosis in the non-cirrhosis studies. 
Apart from cirrhosis (above), the same main exclusion criteria applied in all studies, namely:

Furthermore, patients could not have a present or past Child-Pugh B/C classification, or have a history of hepatic 
decompensation, including variceal bleeding events. 
Due to the potential for DDIs of this ritonavir-boosted triple DAA regimen, a considerable number of medications 
were prohibited.

*Two patients were lost to follow-up, 1 patient discontinued due to "other" reasons 
Virological rebound occurred from week 2 to week 8 of treatment, and all relapses were seen within 4 weeks of 
stopping therapy in this study. 
It  is  clear  that  in  patients  with  genotype  1a  virus,  also  in  the  absence  of  advanced  liver  disease,  the  3DAA 
regimen  without  ribavirin  is  associated  with  a  higher  risk  both  of  on-treatment  virological  breakthrough 
(rebound)  and  of  post-treatment  relapse.  Thus  the  3DAA  regimen  is  in  fact  not  optimized  in  an  unselected 
population with genotype 1a. The apparent impact of IL28B genotype on the likelihood of SVR, particularly in the 
RBV-free arm, is noted. Regarding baseline resistance in this study, while the Q80K mutation, which does not 
confer  high  level  resistance  to  ABT-450,  was  apparently  more  common  in  those  failing  virologically  in  the 
ribavirin-free arm, the impact of detectable high level baseline resistance does not explain the increased failure 
rates (see above section on pharmacodynamics).

is analogous to PEARL-IV, described above, except that its target population have genotype 1b rather than -1a 
virus. 
The study was conducted at 50 investigative sites in Austria, Belgium, Spain, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Poland, 
Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, and the United States. 
Patients were randomized to 3 DAAs + RBV or 3 DAAs without RBV (1:1) for 12 weeks.

The efficacy of the 3DAA without ribavirin regimen was outstanding in genotype 1b. There was no room for 
additive efficacy with RBV. 
2.6.1.2.2.  Treatment experienced (TE) patients without cirrhosis   (GT-1) 
It has been noted above that patients with prior experience of direct acting antiviral therapy were not included 
in  the  TE  studies;  thus  TE  exclusively  refers  to  experience  of  peginterferon+ribavirin.  As  exposure  to  this 
regimen does not select for resistance, and thus does not alter the activity of drugs in a subsequent regimen, 
such a TE population is understood as an enrichment of that more difficult to treat subgroup of a treatment naïve 
population,  who  would  not  have  been  cured  on  peginterferon+ribavirin  therapy  alone.  In  typical  trials  of 
genotype  1  infected,  treatment  naïve  subjects  with  pegIFN/RBV,  SVR  rates  have  been  approximately  50%. 
Approximately 10-15% relapse after the end of treatment; 10-15% are partial responders and approximately 
20% are null responders. 
Study M13-098 (SAPPHIRE-II) 
Study  title:  A  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
ABT-450/Ritonavir/ABT-267  (ABT-450/r/ABT-267)  and  ABT-333  co-administered  with  ribavirin  (RBV)  in 
treatment-experienced adults with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (SAPPHIRE-II) 
This  study  was  conducted  at  76  investigative  sites  in  Australia,  Canada,  Czech  Republic,  Denmark,  France, 
Germany,  Ireland,  Italy,  Mexico,  The  Netherlands,  Portugal,  Russia,  Spain,  United  Kingdom,  and  the  United 
States/Puerto Rico. 
Patients were randomized to 3 DAAs + RBV or placebo (3:1) for 12 weeks. Patients allocated to placebo were 
offered the active regimen for 12 weeks open label after the blinded period. As stated above, in the discussion

of  SAPPHIRE-I,  the  anticipated  SVR  rate  in  the  placebo  group  is  0.  Therefore  the  placebo  comparison  is  of 
relevance for safety only.

Of the 7 who relapsed, 6 were male, 6 had the IL28B non-CC genotype, and 3 had F3 fibrosis stage. 
When using the 3DAA+RBV, efficacy is very high also in these patients that are enriched “poor responders” to 
pegIFN+RBV, with virtually similar outcomes regardless of prior response category or viral subgenotype (though 
the  proportion  of  relapsers  was  numerically  higher  in  genotype  1a.  Further,  it  is  notable  that  also  in  such 
previously  defined  poor  responders  to  pegIFN+RBV,  the  addition  of  RBV  to  3DAA  prevents  on  treatment 
virological breakthrough in patients with genotype 1a virus. 
Study M13-389 (PEARL-II)

combination of ABT-450/Ritonavir/ABT-267 (ABT-450/r/ABT-267) and ABT-333 with and  without ribavirin in 
treatment-experienced subjects with genotype 1b chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (PEARL–II). 
As the efficacy of the 3DAA combination without RBV had been shown to be lower in genotype 1a in the AVIATOR 
study, the three DAA combination without RBV was studied in phase III in treatment experienced patients with 
genotype 1b virus, but not with -1a (see also comment above). 
This study was conducted at 43 investigative sites in United States, Austria, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Puerto 
Rico, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and Turkey. 
Patients were randomised to 3DAA or 3DAA+RBV, for 12 weeks, at a 1:1 ratio. 
None of the patients had a virological failure as the resons for not achieving SVR12, table below:

2.6.1.2.3.  Patients with genotype 1a or 1b virus and compensated cirrhosis 
Study M13-099 (TURQUOISE-II) 
Study title: A randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABT-450/Ritonavir/ABT-267 
(ABT-450/r/ABT-267)  and  ABT-333  coadministered  with  ribavirin  (RBV)  in  adults  with  genotype  1  chronic 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and cirrhosis (TURQUOISE-II). 
This  study  is  remarkable  insofar  as  it  is  the  first  registrational  study  in  the  field  of  HCV  therapy  dedicated 
exclusively to patients with (compensated) cirrhosis. Thus it counterbalances the fact that most patients in the 
other phase III studies had minimal fibrosis. 
The study was conducted at 78 investigative sites in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, Belgium, France, 
Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. 
In contrast to the other phase III studies, this study was providing the treatments open label: 
Patients were randomized to 3DAAs + RBV for either 12 weeks or 24 weeks.  
Notably, this study included patients with either -1a or -1b viral sub genotype; also, it included both patients 
that  were  treatment  naïve  as  well  as  patients  with  prior  experience  of  non-curative  peginterferon  +  RBV 
therapy. 
It is presently well known that the mean requirements in terms of drug pressure and/or treatment duration, in 
order to maximize SVR rates, is higher in patients with cirrhosis compared to those that have less advanced liver 
disease. Furthermore, the phase II program did not include patients with cirrhosis. Finally, failure to achieve 
SVR with the 3DAA is likely to be associated with multiple class drug resistance. As compensated cirrhotics may 
progress to decompensation if SVR is not reached, and as it is presently unclear how to retreat patients with 
cirrhosis that have preselected for triple class drug resistance, the prudent strategy of adding ribavirin to the 
regimen  of  all  patients  is  recognized,  even  though  it  leaves  the  question  open  of  whether  cirrhotics  with 
genotype 1b infection might do without it. Furthermore, the need to explore the appropriate treatment duration 
in cirrhotics in phase III is recognized. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria and stratification factors are delineated at the beginning of this section on the pivotal 
studies of this application. As a reminder, patients could only be included if they had a prior liver biopsy showing 
cirrhosis, or a Fibroscan result (within 6 months) of 14.6 kPa, minimum baseline platelets was 60,000. Further, 
patients had to have a Child-Pugh A classification and no history of clinical decompensation. 
Overall,  SVR  rates  were  91.8%  (191/208)  and  95.9%  (165/172)  in  the  12  and  24  weeks  treatment  arm, 
respectively. SVR rates were very high for either treatment duration for patients infected with genotype 1b - 
only 1/119 did not achieve SVR12. This patient, TE with prior partial response, had a relapse after completing 12 
weeks of therapy. For patients with genotype 1a-infection, 24 weeks of therapy yielded an SVR rate of >90% in 
all subgroups, while 12 weeks of therapy carried higher risk of failure in some subsets.

Thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis is a marker of portal hypertension. Baseline platelet count is one of the main 
predictors of disease progression in cirrhosis. Low counts are generally associated with more severe disease, 
where extended treatment durations may be of importance. This is both in terms of required drug pressure to 
achieve SVR, as well as in terms of the potential clinical consequences of failing to achieve SVR. The number of 
patients with low platelets was relatively small in this study (a consequence of selection criteria, as the likelihood 
of  meeting  other  exclusion  criteria  related  to  Child-Pugh  status  and  clinical  decompensation  increases  with 
decreasing platelet counts). 
SVR12 rates by baseline platelet counts were presented as below:

Rebound  (n=4)  only  occurred  in  patients  with  genotype  1a-infection  (1  in  arm  A,  3  in  arm  B).  The  risk  for 
rebound  is  not  affected  by  the  treatment  duration.  The  relapse  frequency,  however,  may  be  lowered  by 
increasing the treatment duration.  
For genotype 1a there is therefore an interest in scrutinizing the risk for relapse for the two different treatment 
durations by type of patient population. In the full dataset, the relapse rate among patients with GT1a in the 12 
week arm was 11/140 (8%) versus 1/121 (1%) in the 24 week arm. Counting the patient in the 24 week arm 
with  on-treatment  breakthrough  at  day  97  as  a  “relapse”  (as  this  breakthrough  occurred  after  12  weeks  of 
therapy), the point estimate would be 2/121 (1.5%).

In an attempt to further understand the determinants of relapse after 12 weeks, in order to identify those 
cirrhotic GT1a patients most suitable for 12 or 24 weeks of therapy, the applicant further analysed this dataset 
by logistic regression. Some traditional prognostic factors, such as age and baseline HCV RNA, were unrelated 
to relapse. Former injection drug use identified 10 of the 11 relapsers, but the biological plausibility of this 
marker is uncertain. IL28b genotype was also associated with relapse, but only when comparing TT genotype 
with non-TT genotype.  Male sex was marginally associated with relapse. 
Higher AFP, lower platelets, and lower albumin, all factors identifying patients with more advanced cirrhosis, 
were each significantly associated with relapse. These variables collectively identified all of the prior null 
responders who relapsed and 3 of the 4 treatment-naïve subjects who relapsed.

While it is recognized that GT1a cirrhotics with a higher risk of relapse on 12 weeks of therapy could be identified 
post hoc using various biologically plausible baseline characteristics, and particularly that data indicate that 
cirrhosis associated with low platelets or biochemical abnormalities is a risk factor for relapse with a shorter 
treatment durations, the actual cut-offs presented above are considered clinically arbitrary.

Patients received 3DAA + RBV for 24 weeks.  
RBV dosing was managed at the discretion of the investigator. Previous studies in this population highlight the 
potential  for  RBV  dose  modification,  use  of  erythropoiesis-stimulating  agents,  such  as  erythropoietin,  and 
transfusion.  Creatinine  clearance  is  commonly  reduced  in  this  population,  in  part  due  to  chronic  calcineurin 
inhibitor  (CNI)  exposure.  The  reduced  creatinine  clearance  may  augment  RBV  exposures,  increasing  the 
possible risk of RBV toxicity. Consequently, RBV dosing was at the discretion of the investigator and typical 
weight-based dosing was not required upon initiation of study drug. 
The most frequently selected RBV dose range at the initiation of therapy was 600 – 800 mg per day (19/34 
subjects;  55.9%).  This  was  also  the  most  common  RBV  dose  at  completion  of  the  study  regimen  (23/34 
subjects; 67.6%). Overall, 19 (55.9%) subjects dose modified RBV. 
The use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), cyclosporine and tacrolimus, at a stable dose was permitted with the 
following  recommendations  for  dose  adjustment  based  on  data  from  Phase  1  drug-interaction  studies: 
Tacrolimus:  500  mg  once  a  week  taken  with  the  study  drugs  and  with  food.  Cyclosporine:  one-fifth  of  the 
pre-study total daily dose taken as a single daily dose with the study drugs and with food. Adjustment of CNI 
dose and dosing interval was permitted based on the investigator's interpretation of CNI levels.

Of the 32 subjects with data available to assess SVR12, 31 (96.9%) achieved SVR12; being 96.3% (26/27) in 
subjects with genotype 1a infection and 100% (5/5) in subjects with genotype 1b infection.  
A single subject with HCV genotype 1a infection, experienced relapse at Post-Treatment Day 3. 
2.6.1.4.  Efficacy in patients receiving opiate substitution therapy 
Study M14-103 
This  was  an  open-label,  single-arm,  phase  2  study  to  evaluate  the  combination  of  ABT-450/r/ABT-267  and 
ABT-333 coadministered with ribavirin (RBV) in adults with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection taking 
methadone or buprenorphine. 
From a regulatory perspective, patient with HCV infection taking opiate substitution therapy is not considered a 
clinically relevant subgroup for which there is a need of a specific demonstration of efficacy and safety, in the 
absence  of  clinically  relevant  drug-drug  interactions  that  would  mandate  specific  studies,  e.g.,  of  the 
appropriateness of proposed dose adjustments. In this case, estimates by cross study comparisons indicate that 
methadone  may  lower  exposure  to  ABT-450  substantially.  Furthermore,  there  is  an  increase  in 
buprenorphine/norbuprenorphine  exposure  on  co-administration  with  3DAA.  (further  discussed  in  the 
pharmacokinetics section). 
Hepatitis  C  virus  genotype  1-infected  adult  subjects  who  were  on  a  stable  opioid  replacement  therapy  of 
methadone or buprenorphine ± naloxone for at least 6 months prior to screening were eligible for the study. 
Patients were non-cirrhotic and either treatment naïve or had prior pegIFN/RBV treatment experience. Patients 
with HBV or HIV co-infection were excluded. 
All subjects were scheduled to receive 3DAA+RBV for 12 weeks. 
The study population comprised 38 patients, 66% of whom were male and 94,7% of whom were white. Mean 
age  was  48  years.  84%  had  genotype  1a  virus  and  32%  had  IL28B  C/C  genotype.  36/38  patients  were 
treatment naïve. 19 (50%) subjects were on methadone and 19 (50%) subjects were on buprenorphine +/- 
naloxone. 
37/38 patients achieved SVR, with one patient discontinuing the study prematurely.  
2.6.1.5.  Efficacy in patients with genotype 1 infection and HIV co-infection 
Study M14-004 is an ongoing, randomized, open-label trial to evaluated 3DAA coadministered with RBV for 12 
and 24 weeks in HCV GT1-infected subjects with HIV-1 coinfection. 
In part a of this study, for which SVR12 and safety data have been submitted, TN or pegIFN/RBV experienced 
patients with or without cirrhosis were included. Most patients had GT1a infection. Patients were treated with 
either an atazanavir or a raltegravir based antiretroviral regimen. The SVR rates were 29/31 (93.5%) and 29/32 
(90.6%) in the 12 and 24 week arms, respectively. Like previous studies with different interferon-free DAA 
regimens, these data are indicative that HIV co-infection does not impact the likelihood of SVR:

2.6.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Each of the drugs were studied in dose ranging monotherapy studies in genotype 1. Subsequently each drug was 
studied in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin in further phase IIa dose ranging. This is in agreement 
with  the  paradigm  that  has  prevailed  during  the  recent  transition  from  interferon  based  to  interferon  free 
anti-HCV therapy. 
After  a  few  exploratory  combination  studies,  the  company  performed  the  large  phase  IIa  study  AVIATOR 
(M13-652). This trial is crucial for informing on the drug combinations and durations that were subsequently 
studied in phase III. This drug development program comprises four active drugs – three direct acting antivirals 
of different classes, as well as ribavirin – and a pharmaco-enhancer. Thus, the number of potential combinations 
is very large. Adding to these parameters is the fact that also treatment duration was a factor to consider in the 
selection of the appropriate regimen. It is notable that factorial designs covering all possible combination are not 
only practically infeasible, but would also have been impossible, as several combinations would be anticipated to 
provide insufficient efficacy based on pharmacodynamic considerations and/or clinical trial experiences. In this 
context, it should be noted that all three DAAs select for resistant variants, and that there is therefore a need to 
protect patients from inadvertent non-curative exposure.  
The  company  has  further  presented  the  largest  interferon-free  phase  III  program  hitherto  submitted  for 
regulatory  evaluation.  There  are  five  studies  of  the  use  of  3DAAs  with  or  without  ribavirin  in  non-cirrhotic 
patients, 
further  classified  based  on 
treatment  experience 
(naïve  or  previously  exposed 
to 
peginterferon+ribavirin) and on viral sub genotype (1a versus -1b). The company has also performed the first 
phase III trial dedicated exclusively to (compensated) cirrhotics. The dossier is complemented by interim data 
from a study of the use of 3DAA+RBV post-transplant in patients with genotype 1 infection that do not yet have 
advanced fibrosis. 
All  in  all,  the  rationale  for  the  design  of  this  drug  development  program  is  understood  and  there  are  no 
indications of particular deficiencies in its conduct. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In selecting the doses, the applicant has not only, as in the general case, needed to balance sufficient potency 
and  barrier  to  resistance  against  exposure  dependent  safety  concerns,  but  also  take  into  account 
multi-directional drug-drug interactions between the regimen components and the pharmacokinetic enhancer 
ritonavir. The company has adequately described this procedure and the rationale for the dose selection is in 
agreement with the antiviral drug development paradigm. For all three drugs, exposures at the selected dose 
are anticipated to yield maximal activity against wild-type virus. Dasabuvir appears only to be active against 
genotype 1 virus. 
The AVIATOR study demonstrated that, in non-cirrhotic subjects, 8 weeks of therapy is submaximal and that 
more  than  12  weeks  did  not  add  efficacy.  These  findings  are  supported  by  other  data  on  interferon-free 
treatment regimens that have yielded similar results. Furthermore, this study clearly showed that the optimal 
regimen might differ between genotypes 1a and -1b.  
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 81/119 
 
  
  
For  genotype  1a,  leaving  out  ombitasvir,  dasabuvir  or  ribavirin  from  the  regimen  yielded  lower  SVR  rates. 
Though perhaps not always statistically compelling, this is supported by PK/PD arguments and in particular by 
an understanding of differential barriers to resistance, as well as by sparse clinical observations.  
For genotype 1b, the additive value of a third agent, be it ombitasvir, dasabuvir or ribavirin is less clear cut. 
There are two on-going studies – M13-393 (PEARL-1) and M12-536 - in which the use of the dual combination 
of ABT-450 and dasabuvir is investigated in genotype 1b. While 0/42 treatment naïve non-cirrhotic patients 
experienced virological failure, data indicate a 6.6% virological failure rate among a total of 76 patients with the 
dual  DAA  combination  in  treatment  experienced  patients  with  genotype  1b.  Further,  there  is  a  numerical 
over-representation  of  baseline  NS5A  RAV  Y93H  in  those  that  fail.  There  are  similar  figures  from  other 
programs. Furthermore, it may be that adding a third drug would give some increment in efficacy in patients 
that are intrinsically “difficult to cure” due to host factors.  
It is notable that in weighing the benefit of a third agent, its side effects profile must be considered. Dasabuvir 
has a favourable side effects profile compared to ribavirin, which is the main driver of symptomatic adverse 
effects within the regimens tested, as will be clear from the analysis of safety. For such reasons, the company 
studied the 3DAA regimen without ribavirin in phase III, rather than either of the 2DAA regimens with ribavirin. 
However, the efficacy of 2DAA+RBV for 12 weeks in non-cirrhotic patients with GT1b is likely to be similar as 
that of 3DAA, as shown in the AVIATOR study and further supported by a reverse bridging argument (GT4 to 
GT1b) based on the M13-393 study. 
The phase III program has demonstrated excellent efficacy with 99% SVR when 12 weeks of 3DAA is given to 
non-cirrhotic  patients  with  genotype  1b, 
regardless  of  host 
factors  and  prior  exposure 
to 
peginterferon+ribavirin, which does not per se impact response to the DAAs. Patients with prior DAA exposure 
were not included in this study program, as in most cases these would have previously selected for variants 
cross-resistant to one of the DAAs in the present regimen).

Concerning genotype 1a, the important PEARL-IV study clearly shows the advantage of adding ribavirin to the 
3DAA  when  treating  for  12  weeks  (and  likely  also  compared  to  a  longer  treatment  duration,  as  some

on-treatment virological failure was seen when ribavirin was excluded from the regimen); whereas the SVR rate 
was 97% with 3DAA+RBV, it was 90% without RBV. These data are supported by results from the AVIATOR 
study.  The  numerical  difference  is  somewhat  greater  in  IL28B  non  C/C  genotype,  compared  to  the  smaller 
sample with C/C genotype. Baseline resistance does not clearly identify patients likely to fail without ribavirin; 
the  numerical  over-representation  of  patients  with  the  Q80K  variant  among  failures,  however,  is  noted  and 
should be further discussed. 
Based on these data, the company proposes that 3DAA+RBV is the recommended regimen in genotype 1a. This 
is supported.

In general rates of virological failure on DAA regimens tend to be somewhat higher in patients with cirrhosis, 
with 12 weeks of therapy. Furthermore, as more drug pressure is required for maximal efficacy, the differential 
effect of adding ribavirin may be somewhat greater in such patients. Moreover, there were no cirrhotic patients 
in the AVIATOR study. Therefore, the TURQUOISE-II study (M13-399) compared 3DAA+RBV for 12 versus 24 
weeks  in  compensated  cirrhotic  patients  with  either  of  the  genotype  1  subgenotypes,  and  with  or  without 
treatment  experience  (peginterferon+ribavirin).  Results  were  again  excellent  in  patients  with  genotype  1b

infection,  with  a  single  relapse  among  64  patients  treated  for  12  weeks  (including  46  previously 
peginterferon+ribavirin treated patients). 
For genotype 1a, efficacy was somewhat lower, with 92-93% SVR in treatment naïve patients. In patients with 
prior peginterferon+ribavirin experience, preselected as a difficult to cure subgroup of a general population, 12 
weeks of therapy yielded 85.5% SVR versus 95.5% SVR with 24 weeks. However, it is notable that 10-20% of 
a  treatment  naïve  genotype  1  population  would-be  null  responders  if  subjected  to  peginterferon+ribavirin 
therapy.  Furthermore,  a  similar  trend  for  24  weeks  is  seen  in  treatment  naïve  patients  with  IL28B  non  C/C 
genotype  (from  which  null  responders  are  generally  selected),  as  well  as  in  patients  with  low  platelets  at 
baseline, comprising those with most advanced but yet compensated disease. 
SVR is considered a clinical imperative in patients with compensated cirrhosis to avoid disease progression with 
decompensation, which may be imminent. Furthermore, effective retreatment alternatives may not be readily 
available for cirrhotic patients failing with emergence of resistance to NS3/4A and NS5A inhibitors +/- resistance 
to dasabuvir.  
In the full dataset, the relapse rate among patients with GT1a in the 12 week arm was 11/140 (8%) versus 
1/121 (1%) in the 24 week arm. Counting the patient in the 24 week arm with on-treatment breakthrough at 
day 97 as a “relapse” (as this breakthrough occurred after 12 weeks of therapy), the point estimate would be 
2/121 (1.5%). 
During  the  assessment  procedure,  the  applicant  proposed  different  algorithms  to  identify  a  subset  of  GT1a 
cirrhotic patients for whom 24 weeks of therapy would be indicated, presuming that those not fulfilling criteria 
might be treated for 12 weeks. These include prior null responder status or, alternatively, having one or more 
biomarkers of more advanced disease (platelets, alfa-fetoprotein, albumin) with certain cut-offs (see above). 
Such approaches however, are fraught with uncertainty. Given the similar tolerability of 12 and 24 weeks of 
therapy (the proportion of patients stopping therapy due to adverse events in the Turquoise study was 4/208 
versus 4/172 for the two durations), and the abovementioned uncertainty of the effectiveness of retreatment 
options, a 24 week course of therapy is considered appropriate for all GT1a patients with compensated cirrhosis. 
Nevertheless, the CHMP agreed to include the information originating from the post hoc analysis on the risk of 
relapse in subgroups of GT1a cirrhotics in section 5.1. of the Exviera SmPC. 
A  further  interim  analysis  has  demonstrated  high  efficacy  of  3DAA+RBV  in  post-transplant  patients  without 
advanced fibrosis. Further data from those with more advanced liver disease are eagerly awaited, but not within 
the approval procedure. 
There are no data in patients with decompensated liver disease. 
2.6.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall 3DAA without ribavirin and 3 DAA+RBV for 12 weeks in non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients, respectively, 
with  genotype  1b  has  demonstrated  outstanding  efficacy,  as  has  3DAA+RBV  for  12  weeks  in  non-cirrhotic 
patients with genotype 1a. In compensated cirrhotic patients with genotype 1a, the relapse rate was higher with 
12  compared  to  24  weeks.  Failure  of  these  regimens  is  often  associated  with  the  selection  of  dual  class 
resistance, with or without further resistance to dasabuvir; in such cases, appropriate retreatment alternatives 
may not always be obvious. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 84/119 
  
  
Outstanding  issues  include  the  appropriate  treatment  duration  in  subsets  of  patients  with  genotype  1a  and 
compensated cirrhosis, as well as which patients with genotype 1a virus could be suitable for RBV-free therapy 
if this is needed. 
2.7.  Clinical safety 
The safety database submitted at the time of the application for the 3-DAA regimen contained data from 6 Phase 
3 and 2 Phase 2 studies in HCV GT1-infected adult subjects (Phase 3 Studies M11-646, M13-098, M13-099, 
M13-389, M13-961, and M14-002 and Phase 2 Studies M11-652 and M14-103) that included administration of 
the 3 DAAs in combination with and without RBV at the proposed doses or higher—ABT-450 150 mg once daily 
(QD), ritonavir 100 mg QD, ABT-267 25 mg QD, and ABT-333 250 mg twice daily (BID).  
In  addition,  17  Phase  1  studies  that  evaluated  safety  in  healthy  volunteers  who  received  multiple  doses  of 
ABT-450/r  +  ABT-267  +  ABT-333  at  the  proposed  doses  or  higher  of  each  of  the  DAAs  are  included  in  the 
provided integrated summary of safety (ISS). 
The safety population consisted of the following subjects for each analysis set: 
• 
Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set: all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of double-blind 
study drug in a Phase 3 placebo-controlled study (SAPPHIRE I and –II); 
•  Regimen-Controlled Analysis Set: all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in 
a Phase 3 regimen-controlled study (PEARL II, -III and –IV) 
• 
• 
Phase 2 and 3 (All Treated) Analysis Set: all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of active 
(3-DAA +/-RBV) study drug at the proposed dose or higher in a Phase 2 or 3 study; 
Phase 1 Analysis Set: all healthy volunteers who received multiple doses of the 3-DAA regimen at the 
proposed  dose  or  higher  of  each  of  the  DAAs  in  the  regimen  in  a  Phase  1  study.  For  drug-drug 
interactions studies, only data from period/days during which the DAAs were administered without the 
interacting drug were included in the pooled analyses. 
Thus  3DAA+RBV  was  compared  with  placebo  in  two  randomised  phase  III  trials,  whereas  3DAA+RBV  was 
compared with 3DAA in three randomised phase III trials. This allows for some disentanglement of the side 
effect profile of the 3DAA per se versus that of placebo, through cross study comparison. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 2,632 subjects received at least 1 dose of 3 DAAs ± RBV and were included in the All Treated Analysis 
Set. The median number of days of treatment for all subjects was 84 days, with greater than 95% of subjects 
receiving  more  than  60  days  of  treatment.  The  size  of  the  safety  database  considerably  exceeds  ICH 
suggestions.

The proposed treatment duration is 84 days in most patients, and 168 days in some compensated cirrhotics. 
The majority of subjects in the All Treated Analysis Set were white (90.5% total); 57.3% of all subjects were 
male and mean age was 51.6 years overall. Overall, a total of 188 (7.1%) subjects were black and 163 (6.2%) 
subjects were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.  The majority of subjects participated at sites in the US (45.0%) 
and  European  Union  (40.7%).  The  representation  of  non-white  subjects  was  relatively  low,  whereas  EU 
representation is considerable. 
The  majority  of  subjects  were  treatment-naïve  (68.0%)  and  had  minimal  fibrosis  (F0  –  F1,  59.8%).  The 
proportion of patients with minimal fibrosis is notable; however, the applicant has performed a substantially 
sized phase III trial dedicated to patients with compensated cirrhosis. 
The All Treated Analysis Set included 690 subjects (26.2%) with a history of hypertension, 482 (18.3%) with a 
past  or  current  history  of  depression  or  bipolar  disorder,  and  169  subjects  (6.4%)  with  a  past  or  current 
diagnosis of diabetes. The inclusion of a large proportion of patients with prior psychiatric issues is notable, as 
such medical problems form relative contraindications and often prevent interferon-based therapy. 
The all treated analysis set included 385 patients with compensated cirrhosis, 383 of whom were treated with 
3DAA+RBV.

Adverse events 
The 3DAA combination of ABT-450(r), ombitasvir and dasabuvir was investigated in combination with ribavirin, 
in two randomised, placebo controlled phase III trials; furthermore this combination was studied with or without 
ribavirin in three randomised, controlled trials. Notably, the side effect profile of ribavirin is well understood, and 
includes primarily haemolytic anaemia, secondary hyperbilirubinaemia, pruritus, rash, dry skin, fatigue, cough 
and neuropsychiatric side effects such as insomnia and irritability.

The frequency of any side effect or any side effect considered reasonably attributable to a DAA was similar in 
placebo-treated patients and patients treated with 3DAA without ribavirin. The frequency of severe or serious 
side effects, however, was numerically somewhat higher with 3DAA compared to placebo, though still relatively 
low (1.4% versus 0.4% for serious AEs). The side effect burden was clearly higher when ribavirin was added to 
the 3DAAs. Similar to previous observations in other settings, dose modifications of ribavirin (mostly due to 
anaemia) were not associated with lower efficacy.  
In the all-treated analysis set, the frequency of serious adverse events when using the 3DAA regimen with or 
without  ribavirin  was  2.5%,  the  frequency  of  AEs  leading  to  drug  discontinuation  was  1%.  The  all  treated 
analysis set contains one fatal adverse event, discussed further below under the section on hepatic safety.

Notes:  Order is by decreasing risk difference. 
Fatigue, asthenia, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, pruritus and rash were the most common treatment-emergent

Notes:  Order is by decreasing risk difference. 
Anaemia, insomnia, pruritus, asthenia and increased bilirubin are more common when the 3DAA are used with 
RBV. All of these side effects have previously been associated with ribavirin use. Also nausea is more commonly 
reported with RBV than without RBV.  
With the relevant caveats of cross study comparison, the following table further informs on the contribution of 
RBV to the side effects profile of the treatment regimen.

d.  Risk difference was calculated as the percentage of subjects in the 3-DAA + RBV treatment group minus the percentage of subjects in 
the placebo treatment group (Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set) or as the percentage of subjects in the 3-DAA + RBV treatment group 
minus the percentage of subjects in the 3-DAA treatment group (Regimen-Controlled Analysis Set). 
Note: 
Order is by decreasing magnitude of risk difference in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. 
It may be concluded that on cross study comparison none of these common side effects were clearly numerically 
more  frequently  reported  with  the  3DAA  regimen  compared  to  placebo,  and  that  the  bulk  of  the  treatment 
emergent AEs arising from the use of 3DAA+RBV are due to RBV and are also characteristic of the known side 
effects profile of this compound. Risk differences indicate that the 3DAAs may cause fatigue and pruritus. The 
latter has been seen with other macrocyclic NS3/4A inhibitors, and may be due to the impact of ABT-450 on 
biliary transporters such as BSEP. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Three  deaths  were  reported  among  subjects  in  the  All  Treated  Analysis  Set.    Of  the  3  deaths,  none  was 
considered related to study drug and 2 were due to non-treatment emergent adverse events.  
•  Subject 112201 in Study M11-646 (3-DAA + RBV) died during the Post Treatment Period, 221 days after 
the last dose of study drug, due to treatment-emergent adverse events of non-small cell lung cancer 
and mediastinal mass that began 15 days after the last dose of study drug. 
•  Subject  5682  in  Study  M11-652  (3-DAA)  died  67  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug  due  to 
non-treatment-emergent adverse events of coronary artery stenosis and arteriosclerosis. 
•  Subject 382123 in Study M13-099 (3-DAA + RBV) had severe lactic acidosis in the setting of metformin 
use and multi-organ failure in the setting of severe hypotension and lactic acidosis.  The subject went on 
to receive a liver transplant 3 days after the last dose of study drug.  The subject died 84 days after the 
last dose of study drug due to non-treatment emergent adverse events including multi-organ failure and 
septic shock that began 80 days after the last dose of study drug. 
No pattern in the type of adverse events leading to death in the All Treated Analysis Set was observed, and the 
events are considered unlikely to be causally associated with treatment.

Serious adverse events 
The  overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  serious  adverse  events  was  (0.4%  to  2.7%  across  treatment 
groups in each analysis set (Table 6 and Table 7).  
Of the 65 subjects with treatment-emergent serious adverse events in the All Treated Analysis Set (Table 7), 11 
subjects experienced treatment-emergent serious adverse events assessed by the investigator as being related 
or as having a reasonable possibility of being related to DAA treatment  
One subject in the Phase 1 Analysis Set experienced a treatment-emergent serious adverse event. One subject 
312 from Study M13-782 experienced a spontaneous abortion during the first 12 weeks of gestation, which was 
considered by the investigator to be moderate in severity and to have a reasonable possibility of relationship to 
both DAA and RBV treatment.  This subject had a risk factor of advanced maternal age (43 years old).

Laboratory findings 
Treatment emergent abnormalities in liver function test are specifically discussed within the context of hepatic 
safety, in the section below.

Haematology 
Mean Change from Baseline in Haemoglobin (g/L) (Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set) 
Anaemia is a well-recognized RBV-related toxicity. The magnitude of the mean decrease in haemoglobin seen in 
the 3DAA+RBV group (compared with placebo, below) is typical of the ribavirin dose used. 
The  following  graph,  comparing  the  impact  on  haemoglobin  of  3DAA+RBV  versus  3DAA  without  ribavirin  is 
indicative that the effect is indeed largely due to RBV, though it may be that the 3DAA (perhaps dasabuvir – see 
discussion above on dose selection) may provide a very minor contribution to this effect.

Four 
treatment-emergent  serious  adverse  events  were 
reported  among 
these  anaemia-related 
treatment-emergent  adverse  events.  These  include  3  subjects  who  had  RBV  dose  modification  (including 
1 subject whose nadir haemoglobin was 86 g/L and 1 subject who interrupted study drug) and 3 subjects who 
had a blood transfusion. The percentage of subjects in the All Treated Analysis Set who received erythropoietin 
or  a  blood  transfusion  was  low  (<  0.5%).  All  in  all,  in  terms  of  anaemia,  ribavirin  seems  roughly  similarly 
tolerated in combination with these DAAs, as seen in other interferon-free studies. 
Clinical chemistry 
With  the  exception  of  liver  function  tests,  which  are  further  discussed  below,  the  rate  of  clinically  relevant 
treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities was low. The impact of ribavirin-associated haemolysis on serum 
bilirubin was apparent – the proportion of patients with bilirubin >2xULN was 12% versus 2% with and without 
ribavirin.

2.7.1.  Hepatic safety 
As anticipated, in the general case, suppression of HCV replication with direct acting antivirals leads to prompt 
normalization of ALT due to a reduction of hepatic inflammation. This is demonstrated in the figure below: 
Mean Change from Baseline in ALT (U/L) (Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set) 
However, as discussed above, under the section on dose selection, ABT-450 shows a dose-dependent tendency 
to cause treatment-emergent increases in transaminases. Furthermore, this drug is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and 
–B3. Also, all three DAAs are described as inhibitors of UGT1A1. Therefore, the 3DAA combination is a cause of 
mechanistic (mainly indirect) hyperbilirubinaemia. This complicates the assessment of potential cases of drug 
induced liver injury (DILI). 
In the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, the percentages of subjects (3DAA versus placebo) with at least grade 
2 post-baseline ALT values were 2.2% [17/765] versus 16.1% [41/254]) or at least grade 3 (1.2% [9/765] 
versus 3.9% [10/254]. The higher frequency of low level ALT increases in the placebo group is anticipated, as 
fluctuating transaminase increases are common in hepatitis C. In general, virological suppression is associated 
with biochemical response in the form of ALT normalisation. 
In the Regimen-Controlled Analysis Set, the percentages of subjects in the 3-DAA + RBV and 3-DAA treatment 
groups with at least grade 2 (2.0% [8/401] and 1.8% [9/509], respectively) or at least grade 3 (0.7% [3/401] 
and  0.2%  [1/509],  respectively)  post-baseline  ALT  values  were  similar.  A  similar  pattern  of  results  was 
observed for AST. 
In  the  All  Treated  Analysis  Set,  the  percentages  with  at  least  grade  2  post-baseline  ALT  values  were  2.2% 
[59/2626]) and at least grade 3 were 1.0% [26/2626]). A similar pattern of results was observed for AST. Six 
(0.2%) subjects (all 3-DAA + RBV) had a post-baseline grade 4 ALT value. One of these 6 subjects also had a 
post-baseline grade 4 AST value. 
The following table illustrates the relation between ABT-450 dose and ALT increases, as well as the impact of 
concomitant systemic oestrogen-containing medications:

Thus, there are two salient aspects of the treatment emergent transaminitis associated with the 3DAA combo. 
First, as stated above, it is a dose and therefore exposure related side effect of ABT-450. Second, the risk of 
transaminitis  is  strikingly  increased  with  concomitant  administration  of  systemic  oestrogen-containing 
medications. Notably, Grade 3 or higher ALT elevations were not observed in subjects receiving progestins only 
or  subjects  receiving  topical  vaginal  oestrogen  preparations.  A  logistic  regression  analysis  also  identified 
systemic  oestrogen  co-medication  as  a  risk  factor  for  grade  3+  ALT  increases.  Cirrhosis,  however,  was  not 
identified as a risk factor. 
In a further sub analysis, patients on ethinyl oestradiol (rather than other oestrogens such as oestradiol, estriol 
and conjugated oestrogens) were the driver of the excess transamnitis rates noted above.

The difference in frequency between those receiving RBV and those that do not, is not significant when systemic 
oestrogen use is taken into account. 
Although the typical signature event observed was an early rise in serum ALT/AST peaking at 2 weeks with 
subsequent resolution despite continued drug treatment, variations on this theme were observed.  
In the phase III studies, the following algorithm was used to manage confirmed ALT increases. 
In some of the studies this was qualified by a requirement that ALT be >2x baseline.

The  number  of  patients  discontinuing  study  therapy  due  to  ALT  or  transaminase  increases  was  very  low  – 
2/2632 in the all treated analysis set. 
The following graphs illustrate the time-course of treatment emergent hyperbilirubinaemia (indirect and direct).

The predominantly indirect hyperbilirubinaemia is apparent, with a maximum occurring at week 1 – that is, 
typically somewhat earlier than the onset of grade 3+ transaminitis. 
The overall incidence of bilirubin-related treatment-emergent adverse events in the All Treated Analysis Set was 
3.8%; the incidence of jaundice, ocular icterus, and yellow skin was 1.9%, 0.6%, and 0.1%, respectively. The 
overall  incidence  of  gallbladder-related  treatment-emergent  adverse  events,  including  cholecystitis, 
cholecystitis acute, cholecystitis chronic, and cholelithiasis, in the All Treated Analysis Set was 0.2%.

Figure 3. 
eDISH Plot (All Treated Analysis Set) 
Approximately 1% of patients are found in the Hy’s law quadrant. Notably, all were also treated with ribavirin, 
which causes indirect hyperbilirubinaemia due to haemolysis. 
The applicant convened an external hepatic expert panel that was not provided treatment assignment reviewed 
hepatic laboratory and clinically relevant data from all subjects whose ALT and total bilirubin values were in the 
Hy's quadrant of the eDISH plot, and any subject with a post-baseline serum ALT > 5 × upper limit of normal 
(ULN) without a total bilirubin elevation ≥ 2 × ULN (subset of Temple's corollary quadrant). The panel concluded 
that none of these 32 subjects met criteria for Hy’s law, as the elevations in total bilirubin in these cases were 
temporally inconsistent with Hy's law in that they preceded the peak serum ALT elevations, a result consistent 
with inhibition of bilirubin transporters by ABT-450 (see above). Moreover, the peak total bilirubin elevations 
were predominantly indirect bilirubin, a finding inconsistent with Hy's law, and again consistent with inhibition of 
bilirubin transporters and exacerbation by RBV-induced haemolysis. 
Of the 32 subjects evaluated by the external hepatic expert panel, treatment-emergent adverse events led to 
interruption of study drug in 3 subjects and discontinuation of study drug in 2 subjects. In all cases, serum ALT 
improved or resolved by end of treatment. 
The majority of these 32 subjects completed study drug with ALT levels that had declined from the peak value 
and that were normal or grade 1 by the Final Treatment Visit or by Post-Treatment Week 4. 
Seven of the 32 subjects were taking systemic oestrogen-containing medication and 5 of these subjects also 
discontinued the hormones. Two of these 5 subjects interrupted the study drug regimen.  All 5 subjects had 
improvement and normalization of ALT.  Among the remaining 2 subjects, 1 subject discontinued study drug 
with return to baseline of serum ALT and 1 subject continued both study drug and the hormonal contraceptive 
with resolution of serum ALT by Post-Treatment Week 2.

There was one case of on treatment liver failure in the safety database. This was a 64 year old white female with 
CPT-A cirrhosis, metformin-treated diabetes type II and hypertension. This patient was hospitalised shortly after 
starting  therapy  for  treatment  of  oedema  of  unknown  cause.  On  day  9  after  starting  therapy  the  patient 
experienced circulatory shock and lactic acidosis, which was possibly metformin-related. Subsequently there 
was multiorgan-failure, including liver failure. In this case it appears that circulatory shock preceded liver failure 
and a causal relation to 3DAA treatment does not seem likely. During the review procedure, the company was 
asked for an update on total exposure to paritaprevir and on any serious liver related adverse events. Among a 
total of 4,589 patients exposed, there were no further on-treatment hepatic failure reported.   
Safety in special populations 
Sex 
A greater percentage of females versus males had at least 1 post-baseline grade 2 haemoglobin result (10.3% 
versus 1.8%). The somewhat lower tolerability of ribavirin in women has been seen in other studies also, and is 
presumably due to lower baseline haemoglobin counts. 
The frequency of at least grade 2 ALT elevations was 2.3% in males and 2.1% in females; the frequency of at 
least grade 3 elevations was 1.1% and 1.2% respectively. 
Age and race 
There were fewer subjects ≥65 years of age (N = 62 for the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, N = 87 for the 
Regimen-Controlled Analysis Set) and fewer black subjects (N = 70 for the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, N = 
69 for the Regimen-Controlled Analysis Set) compared with subjects < 65 years of age. That stated, within each 
age group (< 65 years, ≥ 65 years) or each race group (black, non-black), the treatment-group differences in 
the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and the percentage of subjects with haemoglobin and liver 
function test values by maximum grade were generally consistent with those observed in the overall analysis. 
Cirrhosis 
The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were similar to those observed in noncirrhotic subjects. 
The overall incidence of treatment emergent serious adverse events (5.5%) and treatment emergent adverse 
events leading to premature discontinuation of study drug was 2.1% and thus somewhat higher than observed 
in subjects without cirrhosis. There was no commonality evident among these events. 
A  greater  frequency  of  total  bilirubin  elevations  and  anaemia-related  events  was  observed  in  cirrhotics 
compared with Phase 3 clinical studies of AbbVie DAAs with RBV in subjects without cirrhosis. This is in line with 
previous  experiences  of  the  use  of  ribavirin  in  cirrhotics.  No  subject  discontinued  due  to  symptomatic 
hyperbilirubinaemia. 
Importantly,  the  safety  of  ABT-450(r),  ombitasvir  and  dasabuvir  in  patients  with  HCV  and  decompensated 
cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B and –C) has not been described. 
Post transplant 
The  applicant  has  submitted  interim  results  from  the  M12-999  study  of  3DAA+RBV  for  24  weeks  in  a 
post-transplant population that do not have advanced fibrosis. Overall safety was as follows. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 101/119 
  
  
Anaemia  was  reported  at  a  higher  rate  in  this  post-transplant  population  than  in  the  general  treatment 
population (20% versus less than 10%). This is anticipated, notwithstanding the lower mean starting dose of 
ribavirin. The most frequently selected RBV dose range at the initiation of therapy was 600 – 800 mg per day 
(19/34 subjects; 55.9%). This was also the most common RBV dose at completion of the study regimen (23/34 
subjects; 67.6%). Overall, 19 (55.9%) subjects dose modified RBV. No subject received a transfusion.  Five 
subjects received erythropoietin No subject initiating RBV at doses of 800 mg or less per day interrupted RBV for 
anaemia or required erythropoietin. 
CNI levels were monitored closely throughout the study by means of post-dose testing to inform the scheduling 
of  the  next  dose.  No  subject  had  a  reported  event  of  rejection.  There  was  no  apparent  signal  of  increased 
hepatotoxicity in this population. 
2.7.1.1.  HCV/HIV coinfection 
Due to the fact that Exviera is always given in combination with Viekirax, it is relevant to remind that Viekirax 
contains  low  dose  ritonavir  (100  mg  qd),  which  may  select  for  PI  resistance  in  co-infected  patients  without 
suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Based on in vitro studies conducted with Viekirax the applicant concluded 
that  that  this  risk  is  not  relevant.  However,  since  the  possibility  of  bridging  from  in  vitro  to  in  vivo  in  this 
particular  regard  is  unclear  and  in  the  absence  of  reassuring  in  vivo  data,  the  combination  of  Exviera  and 
ritonavir  co-formulated  with  paritaprevir  and  ombitasvir  should  only  be  given  to  co-infected  patients  in  the 
setting of effective antiretroviral therapy.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As described in the section on pharmacokinetics, the drug-drug interaction profile of these ritonavir-boosted 
combination  regimens  are  very  complex.  Apart  from  a  considerable  range  of  potentially  significant 
pharmacokinetic  drug  interactions,  two  pharmacodynamics  interactions  have  been  identified,  where  the 
hepatotoxicity of ABT-450, in combination with other agents, appear to be augmented. The drugs implicated are 
ethinyl estradiol and efavirenz. In the first case, the mechanism is unclear; the same to some extent pertains to 
the efavirenz interaction, though the applicant argues that this may represent a negative effect of combining 
ritonavir  with  a  significant  inducer,  as  similar  findings  as  those  for  efavirenz  have  been  reported  in  other 
interaction studies with ritonavir and efavirenz or rifampicin.  
Some antiretrovirals are considered acceptable as alternatives for co-treatment, despite the fact that rather 
substantial exposure effects are seen: 
The decrease seen for darunavir exposure (darunavir dosed 800 mg qd) is considered unlikely to affect viral 
suppression in the absence of extensive PI resistance, during the limited treatment duration in question. 
The 2-fold increase in raltegravir exposure is not considered a safety issue, on the basis on what is known for 
this  agent  and  class.  A  similar  increase  in  exposure  for  dolutegravir  (not  studied)  was  expected.  However, 
preliminary data suggest a smaller effect on dolutegravir. 
Rilpivirine  exposure  is  increased  3-fold,  which  may  have  a  potential  for  QT-prolongation.  However,  a  2-fold 
increase  is  deemed  safe  (seen  with  rilpivirine  in  combination  with  boosted  HIV  protease  inhibitors). 
Furthermore, in addition to the approved dose of rilpivirine (i.e. 25 mg qd), doses of 75 mg qd and 150 mg qd 
were studied over 96 weeks in the rilpivirine phase 2 studies, without QTc-problems noted. Therefore, also the 
combination with rilpivirine is considered acceptable, in the setting of ECG-monitoring. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events leading to interruption of study drug was low (0% 
to  2.0%  across  treatment  groups)  in  each  analysis  set.  Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  leading  to 
interruption  of  study  drug  for  at  least  2  subjects  in  the  All  Treated  Analysis  Set  were  diarrhoea,  nausea, 
vomiting, asthenia, fall, alanine aminotransferase increased, and haemoglobin decreased (2 [< 0.1%] subjects 
each, all 3-DAA + RBV). 
Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to RBV dose modification occurred in 6.0% of all subjects in the All 
Treated Analysis Set. Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to RBV dose modification reported for more 
than 1.0% of subjects were anaemia (3.3%) and haemoglobin decreased (1.6%). 
All in all, this four or five drug combo is very well-tolerated. Transaminase increases are mainly asymptomatic 
and only prompted treatment discontinuation in two cases. Ribavirin dose reductions were not associated with 
lower efficacy. 
2.7.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  primary  (“all-treated”)  safety  database  for  this  application  comprises  approximately  2600  patients  that 
received  at  least  1  dose  of  3DAAs+/-  RBV,  and  thus  exceeds  ICH  recommendations.  The  tolerability  of  this 
combination is very good, with serious adverse events emerging in approximately 2% of patients treated with 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 103/119 
 
  
  
3DAA+RBV and 1.4% in those treated with 3DAA without RBV. Discontinuation rates due to AEs were 0.4% with 
3DAA and somewhat higher with 3DAA+RBV. 
As for the individual components, ABT-450 has shown an exposure dependent risk of transaminitis, which was 
considered dose limiting. All in all, in the “all treated” analysis set. 2.2% of patients had at least grade 2 ALT 
increases and 1% had at least grade 3 increases. Furthermore, ABT-450 is an inhibitor of OATP1B1, -B3 as well 
as  UGT1A1.  Therefore,  it  is  a  cause  of  mechanistic  hyperbilirubinaemia,  which  is  augmented  when  given  in 
combination with RBV - exposure to which induces haemolytic anaemia.  
As with other NS5A inhibitors, no specific side effects have been associated with ombitasvir. 
The development program of dasabuvir indicates that this drug at high exposure may have some negative effect 
on haemoglobin, and also that it has a dose-dependent, albeit limited, QT-prolonging potential. At the proposed 
doses, the 3DAA regimen is not anticipated to cause clinically relevant QT prolongation. 
As an important part of the rationale to study 3DAA in phase III rather than ABT-450 + ABT-267+RBV, the 
company considers that the emerging safety profile indicates that dasabuvir is better tolerated than ribavirin. A 
comparison  of  symptomatic  side  effects  in  the  M11-652  (AVIATOR)  study,  where  these  two  regimens  were 
directly compared, is as follows. 
As  anticipated,  the  incidence  of  anaemia  and  hyperbilirubinaemia  was  higher  with  ribavirin  compared  to 
dasabuvir. Whereas 52.4% of patients on ribavirin had at least a grade 1 decrease in haemoglobin with ribavirin, 
the same figure with the three DAA was 8.9% Also the frequency of post-baseline at least grade 3 ALT increases 
was higher with ribavirin - 4.2% versus 0%. Thus, data support the argument of the applicant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 104/119 
 
  
  
The drug development program as a whole indicates that the 3DAA combination without ribavirin may cause 
pruritus as a common adverse effect. With the addition of ribavirin, side effects such as anaemia, asthenia, 
insomnia,  rash,  dry  skin  and  indirect  bilirubinaemia  increase  in  frequency.  This  is  typical  of  the  previously 
described side effects profile of ribavirin. 
Paritaprevir  as  a  component  of  these  regimens  is  a  cause  of  transaminitis,  seen  at  grade  3  or  more  in 
approximately 1% of treated patients. Treatment emergent transaminitis is usually mild and asymptomatic, and 
is often transient despite treatment continuation; very few patients discontinued therapy due to ALT increases. 
There  is  an  association  of  the  concomitant  use  of  ethinyl  oestradiol-containing  drugs  and  the  risk  of 
transaminitis. The risk of at least grade 3 ALT increases was approximately 1% in those not treated with ethinyl 
oestradiol versus approximately 25% in the somewhat more than 20 patients receiving concomitant therapy. In 
most cases the ALT increases resolved on continued 3AA therapy, in some cases after discontinuation of the 
oestrogen.  In  the  phase  III  studies,  a  stopping  algorithm  whereby  patients  with  ALT  increases  >10xULN  or 
>5xULN if accompanied by signs and symptoms of hepatitis should discontinue antiviral therapy. Only 2 patients 
were reported to discontinue the 3DAA regimen due to transaminitis. It is notable that stopping therapy would 
be associated with rebound or relapse with virus resistant to the NS3/4A and/or NS5A classes. 
The applicant identified 32 patients either potentially fulfilling Hy’s law, or having increases of ALT >5x ULN 
without fulfilling the bilirubin criteria. In many of these cases, bilirubinaemia is either indirect or clearly precedes 
ALT increases. There was one on-treatment case of hepatic failure. This has been extensively reviewed and a 
causal relation with HCV treatment is considered unlikely. Thus, within this drug development program, there is 
no evidence that paritaprevir or the 3DAA regimen is a causative agent of serious DILI with hepatic failure. This 
includes a relatively large experience in patients with compensated cirrhosis. 
On-treatment monitoring of transaminases is not recommended, as transaminitis is generally transitory with 
continued  therapy,  there  is  no  evidence  of  its  development  into  failure  of  hepatic  function,  and  there  is  no 
information on what level of increase should mandate treatment discontinuation, which may lead to dual or 
triple class drug resistance with uncertain retreatment options on relapse of previously suppressed virus. The 
relevant findings on transaminitis and bilirubinemia, however, are described in detail in the product information. 
13 out of 23 patients with taking concomitant EE experience on-treatment transaminase increases, while 5 out 
of 23 patients had grade 4 transaminitis. One patient had grade 4 transaminitis and concomitant nausea, and 
discontinued under the investigator-reported diagnosis of “acute hepatitis”. The concerns raised are supported 
by findings in a DDI study in healthy volonteers, There two arms with different progestins in combination with 
EE were discontinued due to transaminase increases. There were no transaminase increases in the progestin 
only arm. This supports the inference that the interaction is indeed due to the EE component. Progestins when 
given alone or in combination with other estrogens have not shown the same association. The safety database 
for concomitant treatment with EE is too small to ascertain acceptable liver safety. If needed, other effective 
contraceptive measures should be instituted prior to therapy, which is always elective as to its precise timing. 
The reasons why a contraindication is preferred to ALT monitoring are the high frequency of grade 3 or more 
changes, the impossibility of defining an operational cut-off for corrective action (discontinuation of EE or the 
DAA regimen) and the fact that inadvertent discontinuation of the EE regimen may lead to dual or triple class 
resistance with unclear retreatment options (see above). 
The safety dataset on systemic non-EE oestrogens is considered sufficiently reassuring to support the limitation 
of the proposed contraindication to ethinyl oestradiol. 
ABT-450  exposure  is  moderately  increased  in  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (62%  increase)  and  increased 
9.5-fold in severe hepatic impairment. There are no efficacy and safety data available in these populations. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/768319/2014 
Page 105/119 
  
  
applicant proposed that the 3DAA combination should be contraindicated patients with Child-Pugh C, whereas 
the product information reports that there are no data on efficacy and safety in patients with Child-Pugh B. This 
is supported. 
2.7.3.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
This triple DAA combination, which also includes ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, and furthermore in 
many cases should be used in combination with ribavirin, has been shown generally well tolerated with low rates 
of serious adverse events and treatment discontinuations. The drug combination may cause transaminitis and 
mechanistic  hyperbilirubinemia;  however  an  association  with  progression  to  serious  DILI  including  hepatic 
failure has not been established. Due to a high frequency of higher grade transaminitis, the combination with 
ethinyl  oestradiol  is  contraindicated;  forms  of  effective  contraception  without  this  drug  must  be  used  when 
needed.  Due  to  the  ritonavir  component,  there  is  a  high  propensity  for  potentially  important  drug-drug 
interactions. This has been extensively addressed in the product information.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In  non-cirrhotic,  treatment  naive  patients  with  genotype  1a  infection,  the  combination  of  3DAA 
(ritonavir-boosted ABT-450, ombitasvir, dasabuvir) plus ribavirin yielded an SVR (sustained virologic response) 
rate of 95.7% (404/422) across the SAPPHIRE-I and PEARL-IV studies. In non-cirrhotics, PEGinterferon plus 
ribavirin experienced patients, the SVR rate was 96% (166/173) (SAPPHIRE-II study). In the PEARL IV study 
(non-cirrhotic, treatment naïve) 3DAA without RBV gave 90.2% (185/205) SVR rate. Within that study, this was 
almost 7% higher when RBV was added (SVR rate 97%, 97/100). 
In non-cirrhotic, treatment naïve patients with genotype 1b infection, the combination of 3DAA+RBV yielded an 
SVR  rate  of  98.9%  (357/361)  across  the  SAPPHIRE-I  and  PEARL-III  studies.  In  non-cirrhotic,  pegIFN+RBV 
experienced patients, the SVR rate was 96.7% (205/212). As opposed to the case with genotype 1a, 3DAA 
without RBV were shown to be similarly effective as 3DAA with RBV. In the PEARL-II study, the SVR rate with 
3DAA was 100% (91/91). This was higher than when RBV was added (96.6%, 85/88). The conclusion that RBV 
does not add to efficacy in such patients is supported by information from the phase IIb AVIATOR study. 
In  patients  with  genotype  1a  and  compensated  cirrhosis  (treatment  naïve  and  pegIFN+RBV  experienced), 
3DAA+RBV  for  12  weeks  yielded  an  SVR  rate  of  88.6%  (124/140)  (TURQUOISE-II).  When  treatment  was 
extended to 24 weeks, the SVR rate was 94.2% (114/121). The difference between treatment durations was 
apparent in subsets of patients classified as prior null responders to pegIFN/RBV, by those with IL28B non C/C 
genotype and by those with low platelets at baseline. 
In contrast to this, when the same regimen (3DAA+RBV) was given for 12 or 24 weeks was given to patients 
with genotype 1b infection within the same study, there was no apparent impact of treatment duration on the 
probability of SVR, with 98.5% (67/68, one patient relapsing) SVR with 12 weeks and 100% SVR (51/51) with 
24 weeks of therapy. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
It is unclear what precise subsets of patients with compensated cirrhosis and genotype 1a infection would have 
an equal probability of SVR when given 12 rather than 24 weeks of 3DAA+RBV. 
The magnitude of the incremental effect of adding dasabuvir to ABT-450(r) and ombitasvir in genotype 1b is 
relatively ill defined. 
Efficacy in decompensated liver disease has not been studied.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In  a  total  of  approximately  2600  subjects  receiving  at  least  1  dose  of  3DAA+RBV,  the  frequency  of  serious 
adverse events was 2.5% and the frequency of AEs leading to discontinuation was 1%. Most AEs were consistent 
with the previously described side effects profile of RBV (anaemia, hyperbilirubinemia, pruritus, rash, insomnia, 
and asthenia). The 3DAA appear to contribute to pruritus. 
Transaminitis  has  been  described  as  an  exposure-dependent  AE  of  ABT-450.  The  general  pattern  of  ALT 
normalisation within a few weeks of therapy when HCV replication is suppressed by a potent antiviral regimen, 
is seen in most treated cases. However, 1% of the treated population experienced an at least grade 3 (≥5xULN) 
ALT  while  on  treatment.  This  frequency  was  higher  in  patients  treated  with  ethinyl  oestradiol-containing 
medications (6/23, 26%, five of whom had grade 4 transaminitis). 
Among those few patients that experienced virological failure, treatment emergent resistance to the NS3/4A + 
NS5A  class  was  generally  seen,  and  around  half  the  patients  showed  resistance  also  to  dasabuvir.  In  the 
presence of a resistant viral quasispecies that is detectable with population sequencing and is cross-resistant to 
other  agents,  impaired  retreatment  efficacy  is  anticipated  both  with  the  same  drug(s)  as  well  as  with  cross 
resistant drugs. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The clinical impact of the general emergence of resistance to both the NS3/4A and the NS5A class, as well as in 
many cases to dasabuvir in case of virological failure is an issue surrounded by considerable uncertainty. As 
previously reported, there is some degree of reversion of NS3/4A resistance as selection pressure is removed. 
It is unclear whether retreatment efficacy would still be impaired, e.g., due to “quasispecies memory” after such 
reversion, as well as the extent of such reversion with time. As previously reported, preselected NS5A resistance 
does  not  appear  to  revert.  The  potential  residual  activity  of  NS5A  inhibitors  in  such  patients  is  not  fully 
characterised. 
It is important to consider that in most cases, patients that fail virologically on these very potent regimens are 
likely to be intrinsically difficult to treat. In such cases, the efficacy of any presently conceivable retreatment 
regimen is unclear, as the efficacy of other available and investigational NS3/4A and NS5A inhibitors may be 
compromised.  Also,  interferons  may  have  poor  efficacy  or  be  ill  tolerated  due  to  advanced  liver  disease  or 
significant comorbid conditions. For these reasons, it is difficult to accept submaximal durations or removing 
RBV from the regimen, if this is anticipated to lower SVR rates or, as in cirrhotics with more advanced disease, 
be associated with a non-negligible risk of clinical disease progression. Due to these uncertainties, the selection 
of resistance is considered a major safety concern despite the high efficacy of these combination regimens. 
While it is clear that the 3DAA regimen may cause transaminitis (attributable to the paritaprevir component), 
the  extent  to  which  it  may  be  a  cause  of  serious  DILI  with  liver  failure  is  not  fully  clear.  Still,  a  traditional 
assessment of Hy’s law is difficult, as patients generally exhibit mechanistic hyperbilirubinaemia. However, it is 
notable that none of the cases where the 3DAA clearly caused hyperbilirubinaemia and transaminitis progressed 
to liver failure with signs of hepatic synthesis defects; thus available data, given its limitations, are reassuring.  
It is not fully clear whether recommending the stopping algorithm for ALT increases that was used in phase III 
would  be  associated  with  a  positive  or  negative  benefit-risk  balance.  On  the  one  hand,  serious  DILI  might 
theoretically be prevented, though given that only 2 patients stopped therapy due to ALT and that no definite 
cases of 3DAA associated, serious DILI with hepatic dysfunction have been documented, this potential benefit 
remains hypothetical. On the other hand, premature stopping of the antiviral regimen may result in rebound or

relapse with resistance to NS3/4A and NS5A inhibitors. For these reasons, routine transaminase monitoring is 
not recommended 
While  it  is  highly  likely  that  concomitant  ethinyl  oestradiol  potentiates  the  risk  of  treatment  emergent 
hepatotoxicity, the mechanism of this finding is unclear; notably, it does not appear to be due to a (plasma) 
pharmacokinetic interaction. An interaction study with between ABT-450+ritonavir+dasabuvir on the one hand, 
and  efavirenz  on  the  other,  was  prematurely  discontinued  due  to  ALT  increases.  Available  data  are  not 
supportive of a pharmacokinetic interaction in this case either. Therefore, there is some lack of clarity on the 
ability of co-medications to impact the potential hepatotoxicity of the DAA combination.  
There are no safety data in patients with HCV and decompensated liver disease.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The overall benefit-risk of Exviera is considered positive by the CHMP.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The general efficacy of the proposed regimens is excellent in genotypes 1b. It is also very good in genotype 1a, 
though  RBV  is  needed  and  in  cirrhotics  a  prolongation  of  therapy  to  24  weeks  is  required  for  optimisation. 
Furthermore, these regimens are generally very well tolerated, with most symptomatic adverse events being 
due to RBV. The proposed regimens may cause transaminitis; treatment-induced transaminitis has, however, 
hitherto  not  been  associated  with  serious  DILI  including  hepatic  failure.  When  used  for  the  treatment  of 
genotype  1  in  patients  with  compensated  liver  disease  as  recommended  in  the  product  information,  the 
benefit-risk balance is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Exviera in combination with other medicinal products the treatment of chronic hepatitis 
C infection in adults is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation 
subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, 
section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
• 
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 6 
months following authorisation. Subsequently, the marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety 
update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates 
(EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European

• 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the same time. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the quality properties of the active substance, the CHMP considers that 
dasabuvir (sodium) is qualified as a new active substance.

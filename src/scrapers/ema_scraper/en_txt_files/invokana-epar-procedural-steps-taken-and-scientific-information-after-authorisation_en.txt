Diabetic ketoacidosis may be prolonged after 
discontinuation of canagliflozin in some patients, i.e. it may 
last longer than expected from the plasma half-life of 
canagliflozin (see section 5.2). Prolonged glucosuria has 
been observed along with persistent DKA. Insulin deficiency 
may contribute to prolonged diabetic ketoacidosis and has 
to be corrected when verified.

In a pooled analysis of patients (N = 348) with a baseline 
eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, canagliflozin provided a 
modest reduction in HbA1c compared to placebo, with  
0.23% for canagliflozin 100 mg and  0.39% for 
canagliflozin 300 mg. 
There is experience with canagliflozin for the treatment of 
diabetic kidney disease (eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2) both 
with and without albuminuria. While both groups of 
patients benefitted, patients with albuminuria may benefit 
more from treatment with canagliflozin. 
For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics.

treatment of patients with eGFR between ≥30 and

Based on the recent completion of studies DIA3008 
update of sections  4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in 
order to update the safety and efficacy information 
on cardiovascular events following final results from 
CANVAS Program (DIA3008 and DIA4003); the 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
Study DIA3008 is phase 3 Randomized, Multicenter, 
Double-Blind, Parallel, Placebo-Controlled Study of 
the Effects of JNJ-28431754 on Cardiovascular 
Outcomes in Adult Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes 
Mellitus 
Study DIA4004 is phase 4 Randomized, Multicenter, 
Double-Blind, Parallel, Placebo-Controlled Study of 
the Effects of Canagliflozin on Renal Endpoints in 
Adult Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
The RMP version 7.3 in Rev.2 of the GVP module V 
has also been submitted. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local 
(CANVAS) and DIA4003 (CANVAS-R), the European Union 
Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPCs) ) for 
canagliflozin (INVOKANA) has been revised to update the 
efficacy and safety information with data from these 2 
studies. 
The wording in section 4.1 of SmPC has been amended, 
CHMP considered as adequate the enhancement of the 
wording of the indication by deleting “. . . to improve 
glycaemic control” from this section (as this restriction does 
no longer adequately reflect the demonstrated effects). The 
wording “treatment of . . . type 2 diabetes” was considered 
more relevant as it encompasses both glycaemic control 
and results of clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular 
complications, with a reference to section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
This is aligned with the labelling of other oral 
antihyperglycaemic agents. 
The Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated with 
editorial change; the paragraph on lower limb amputations

In Section 4.8 of the SmPC, existing safety information was 
updated to reflect the results of the CANVAS studies. 
Furthermore, a paragraph providing detailed information on 
lower limb amputation and a paragraph describing the time 
course of eGFR during canagliflozin treatment were 
included. 
Section 5.1 of SmPC has been updated to include the data 
on CANVAS program, please refer to SmPC for details of 
Cardiovascular outcomes; information on the secondary 
endpoint all-cause mortality and of the additional endpoint 
hospitalisation for heart failure as well as renal endpoints is 
included.The PL have been updated accordingly. 
The CANVAS Program demonstrated that canagliflozin is 
not associated with an unacceptable increase in 
cardiovascular risk (major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACE)), as non-inferiority to placebo has been 
demonstrated. Results of the primary and the key 
secondary endpoints all-cause mortality and cardiovascular 
mortality were numerically in favor of canagliflozin. A 
reduction of heart failure and an improvement of diabetic 
nephropathy may have contributed to the observed 
mortality benefits. 
The PL has been updated accordingly.

SmPC and PL 
Please refer to the assessment report:  
726/2004, the European Commission requested on 
15 April 2016 the PRAC to assess the impact on the 
benefit-risk balance of canagliflozin containing 
medicinal products of an increase in amputations, 
mostly affecting the toes, observed in an ongoing 
clinical trial (CANVAS) for canagliflozin and a 
numerical imbalance with regards to amputation 
events seen in an ongoing renal study CANVAS-R 
with a similar population as CANVAS. 
Considering that a class effect cannot be excluded, 
the European Commission extended on 6 July 2016 
the scope of the procedure to include all SGLT2 
inhibitors containing medicinal products to allow a 
review of data from the class.  
The PRAC was requested to assess the impact 
thereof on the benefit-risk balance of Invokana, 
Vokanamet, Forxiga, Edistride, Xigduo, Ebymect, 
Jardiance and Synjardy and to give its 
recommendation whether the marketing 
SGLT2 inhibitors - EMEA/H/A-20/1442

authorisation of these products should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
As the request results from the evaluation of data 
resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, the 
CHMP opinion has been be adopted on the basis of a 
recommendation of the Pharmacovigilance Risk 
Assessment Committee.

With this procedure the MAH intended to update the 
safety information related to bone fractures, based 
on new information collected from the CANVAS 
(DIA3008). In addition, the MAH implemented some 
linguistic minor changes in sections 4.2, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8

Product Information (PI) for Invokana in order to bring it in

fractures. Based on an analysis of fracture events in the 
ongoing CV outcome study CANVAS the MAH has included 
the new AE “bone fractures” as uncommon in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC and added an explanatory paragraph as follows:  
 “Bone fracture

years of exposure to canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 
mg, and placebo, respectively, with the fracture imbalance 
initially occurring within the first 26 weeks of therapy. In 
other type 2 diabetes studies with canagliflozin, which 
enrolled a general diabetes population of approximately 
5,800 patients, no difference in fracture risk was observed 
relative to control. After 104 weeks of treatment, 
canagliflozin did not adversely affect bone mineral density.”

clinical development programme in Japan have been 
submitted. The MTPC studies were conducted in Japan in 
accordance with Japanese Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 
The provision of these reports is deemed as informational 
data only. Of note, the phase III studies submitted with 
this variation were conducted with products containing 100 
mg and 200 mg canagliflozin (as opposed to the 100 mg 
and 300 mg canagliflozin doses investigated in the 
European program). 
One of the studies submitted investigated the effect of 
CANA in patients with moderate renal impairment used 
inclusion criteria for eGFR ranges distinct from the ones 
used in the European programme. In the phase III studies 
numbers of patients with an eGFR<60ml/ min/ 1.73 at 
baseline were too low to draw conclusions on the efficacy in 
this subgroup. 
Overall, the two phase III studies showed that CANA 
exerted good antihyperglycemic efficacy in the Japanese 
population with the magnitude of effect being in the same 
range as in the European phase III programme. 
The newly submitted phase III studies did not reveal new 
Page 24/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
safety signals for CANA. Known effects of SGLT2 inhibitors 
became obvious such as increased formation of ketone 
bodies, decreased incidence in elevated blood pressure and 
increased incidence in vulvovaginal candidiasis. Otherwise 
these newly submitted studies do not contribute relevantly 
to the safety assessment of CANA due to limitations (low 
patient number in study 05 and lack of a control group in 
study 06). Also the newly submitted phase I and II studies 
cannot provide relevant new information because of low 
patient number and treatment duration. They are therefore 
not discussed here under safety aspects. 
Taken together, the B/R balance of CANA remains 
unchanged.

patients each from the canagliflozin 300 mg and placebo 
(1,5-AG) assays.  
In addition editorial changes were made to the SmPC 
(Section 4.8 and 5.2; 300 mg only), significance 
levels have been added (section 5.1, table 2) and 
errors were corrected in (section 5.1, tables 2 and 
3). 
In addition, the MAH has corrected typographical 
errors in Annex II and Annex IIIA. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

treatment groups of a subset of patients who participated 
in a Phase 3 study of canagliflozin monotherapy. 
In this post hoc analysis, serum 1,5-AG levels were 
decreased with canagliflozin 300 mg compared with 
placebo after 26 weeks of treatment. As reductions in 1,5-
AG indicate poorer glycemic control, findings are in contrast 
to improvements in HbA1c.  
The results of this post hoc analysis are consistent with an 
interference with the measurement of 1,5-AG in the 
context of SGLT2 inhibition; thus, 1,5-AG assays may 
provide inaccurate results regarding glycemic control in 
patients with T2DM treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor, such 
as canagliflozin. 
This new information pertains to interference with a 
laboratory assessment and does not affect the benefit risk

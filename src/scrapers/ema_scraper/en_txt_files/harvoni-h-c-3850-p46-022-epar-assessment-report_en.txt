1.  Introduction 
Gilead Sciences Ireland UC (Gilead) has submitted a final clinical study report the Gilead study GS-US-
337-1904, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. Gilead confirms that there 
are no regulatory consequences identified. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
This is a standalone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Subjects were assigned to receive LDV/SOF 90/400 mg (1 x 90/400−mg tablet, i.e. adult tablet, or 4 x 
22.5/100 mg tablets) once daily based on a swallowability assessment performed during screening 
period. All subjects were able to swallow the 90/400 mg tablet, the lower dose tablet was not used. 
This is the approved dose for adolescents. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
Background 
Chronic hepatitis C is highly prevalent in Egyptian pediatric patients receiving cancer chemotherapy or 
following allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation (El-Sayed 2011 and 2004). The progression of 
HCV-related liver disease in this population may be rapid and a main cause of death in Egyptian 
patients with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. 
The study 
Study GS-US-337-1904 [study period August 2016 to Feb 2019] was conducted at 1 study center in 
Egypt, in adolescents (12-18 years of age) with chronic hepatitis C infection of genotypes 1 or 4, who 
were receiving maintenance cancer chemotherapy for a hematologic malignancy. A total of 19 subjects 
were enrolled out of 24 screened. 
Of those 19 enrolled, 16 were males, and 13/19 aged 12 to 15.  All had genotype 4-infection, none had 
cirrhosis. 
All 19 completed the 12 weeks of treatment, and SVR12 was achieved in 19/19. 
There were no specific safety issues identified. Serious adverse events were reported in 3 subjects, 
non-related to the hep C therapy (but to underlying condition/cancer therapy).  None of the 
chemotherapy interruptions or discontinuations was due to a study drug-related AE. Laboratory 
abnormalities were frequent, and deemed most likely caused by underlying treatment. 
None experienced an HCV flare (defined in the protocol as ≥ 3-fold increase in aALT combined with 
≥ 1 log10 increase in HCV RNA from Day 1 of the study).

3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
In this phase 2 study of limited size the efficacy and safety of sof/ldv in adolescents with chronic 
hepatitis C who were receiving a maintenance cancer chemotherapy regimen was without remarks.  
The outcome is rather expected; sof/ldv has been studied in fairly large number of patients with a prior 
liver transplant, i.e. and subsequent immunosuppressive therapy, with favourable efficacy and safety 
outcomes. 
The company does not propose any labelling changes. This is endorsed. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

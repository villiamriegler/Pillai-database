2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Actual dates 
20 Janaury 2022 
21 January 2022 
27 January 2022 
Brivaracetam (Briviact) is indicated as adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in adults,  adolescents 
and children from 4 years of age with  epilepsy. 
In this  variation, the MAH  is proposing to  extend the indication  to the  paediatric population from 1 month 
to 4 years of age. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
An  application  for  the  extension of  indication  to  the  paediatric  population  from  4  years of  age  in  the  EU 
(adjunctive)  and the  US  (adjunctive and  monotherapy) based on  the  concept  of extrapolation of  efficacy 
data from the  adult population was approved in 2018. 
During the Epilepsy Foundation  Research Roundtable for Epilepsy in May 2020  with FDA representatives in 
attendance,  paediatric  epileptologists  and  researchers  shared  data  demonstrating  that  the  underlying 
pathophysiology  of  partial  onset 
seizures 
(POS),  seizure 
characteristics  and 
symptoms, 
electroencephalogram (EEG) features, disease progression, and treatment  response are similar in patients 
≥1  month  to  <2  years  to  those  in  older  children  (2020  Research Roundtable  for  Epilepsy).  These  data 
support the possibility that  no separate efficacy studies (which would be very difficult to accomplish) would 
be needed for  these young  children as  efficacy can  be extrapolated in  children ≥1  month  to  <2  years of 
age. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Brivaracetam (BRV) is indicated  as adjunctive therapy in  the treatment  of  POS in  patients  4  years of age 
and older with  epilepsy. BRV displays a high and selective affinity for synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) in 
the brain. Binding to SV2A is believed to  be the primary mechanism for BRV anticonvulsant activity. 
2.1.3.  The 
guidance/scientific advice 
development 
programme/compliance 
with 
CHMP 
In April 2020,  the MAH  received a scientific  advice from the  Committee  for Medicinal Products for Human 
Use (CHMP) regarding UCB’s proposed extrapolation strategy (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/203707/2020): 
• 
• 
For patients  ≥2  to <4  years: extrapolation of efficacy from data in adults  receiving BRV as adjunctive 
treatment 
For patients ≥1 month to  <2 years: extrapolation of efficacy from data in adults and children receiving 
adjunctive levetiracetam (LEV), and efficacy data from adults receiving BRV as adjunctive treatment 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99325/2022 
Page 7/86 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP supported, in principle, a model-informed extrapolation-based approach to support the extension 
of  indication  in  patients  ≥2  to  <4  years of  age. This  approach was previously agreed with  the  Paediatric 
Committee in  the frame of the  BRV PIP (EMEA-000332-PIP01-08-M06).  In addition,  the  CHMP  considered 
that  BRV efficacy data  would  be  fundamental  for  the  extrapolation  to  patients  ≥1  month  to  <2  years of 
age.  Therefore,  the  extrapolation  model  has  been  externally  validated  using  seizure  count  data  from 
N01263  and  N01266.  As  agreed  with  the  CHMP,  UCB  has  provided  further  information  and  discussion 
regarding the  similarities and dissimilarities between BRV and LEV as well as the anticipated impact of the 
dissimilarities between  BRV and  LEV. It  was further  supported that  the  extrapolation of efficacy would  be 
supported by  pharmacokinetic(s) (PK)  data from paediatric participants  and  by relevant safety data from 
at least 100 paediatric participants treated for at least 1 year. 
To  support  the  proposed  paediatric  indication,  the  paediatric  pool  includes  clinical  safety  data  from  all 
paediatric study participants in N01263  and N01266  regardless of age or duration of treatment. In addition, 
support of the extension of the currently approved BRV indications down to 1 month of age will be provided 
by post-marketing data, literature, and reference to previously submitted adult data from Pool S4 and Pool 
Monotherapy. 
In  2020,  the  MAH  also  received scientific  advice from the  Swedish Medical  Products  Agency (MPA)  (MPA 
Ref No  4.2.3-2020-056158)  regarding the  proposed extrapolation strategy.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Oral solution 
The currently approved formulation, 10 mg/ml oral solution for children from 4 years of age, was initially 
applied to be used in children from 1 month of age. However, the extension of the indication  was revised 
and the formulation is now intended to be used from 2 years of age. No new formulation has been 
developed for the lower age group applied. 
The oral solution contains the  excipients sodium citrate, citric acid anhydrous, methyl 
parahydroxybenzoate, carmellose sodium, sucralose sorbitol liquid, glycerol, raspberry flavour and 
purified water. 
The solution is filled in amber glass bottles with  child resistant closures (polypropylene). The bottle,  filled 
with  300 ml solution,  will be provided with  a 5 ml and a 10 ml oral dosing syringe and an adaptor, as 
already approved for children from 4 years of age. In view of the  final revised extension of indication to 
children from 2 years of age, the  addition of a 1 ml syringe intended to be used for dosing children from 1 
months of age is no longer applied for. This is agreed. 
Suitability of the oral formulation for the paediatric population from 2 years of age. 
In line with  the Guideline on pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use 
EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012  Rev.2, the suitability  of the proposed formulation in the proposed age 
group has been satisfactorily addressed considering the  safety profile of the excipients for children in the 
target age groups in relation to exposure. 
Suitability of the Container closure system, including dosing devices 
The same container closure system as already on the  market, an amber glass bottle  with  a child  resistant 
closure (polypropylene) containing 300  ml of the  drug product  is intended  to be used in all age groups. To 
justify the bottle  size when used for the  smallest children, additional in-use stability  data supporting  an 
in-use shelf life of 8 months,  were provided. This is acceptable. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99325/2022 
Page 8/86 
 
 
 
 
The already approved package contains a 5 ml and a 10  ml oral syringe which is considered sufficient to 
cover the recommended doses from 2 years of age. 
IV  formulation 
The currently approved formulation, 10 mg/ml Solution for injection/infusion for children from 4 years of 
age, is intended  also to be used in children from 2 years of age. The excipients of the solution for 
injection/infusion formulation are sodium chloride, sodium acetate(trihydrate), glacial acetic acid and 
water for injection. 
The solution is filled in type 1 glass vials with  an extractable volume of not less than  5 ml. The same vial 
size 5 ml as already approved is intended to be used for all age groups. 
Suitability of the iv formulation for the  paediatric population from 2 years of age. 
The excipients, as described in table 2.2-1  above, included in the current formulation is commonly used 
and of no safety concern for the use in  children from 2 years of age.  
For a child weighing 10 kg the lowest dose to be administered on one occasion is 0.5 ml. When using a 1 
ml syringe no issues with regards to accuracy and precision are expected since commonly available 
syringes of 1 ml syringes with  0.01 increments are to be used for dosing. The lowest volume to be dosed 
corresponds to 50% of the maximum capacity of the capacity of the 1 ml syringe. This is acceptable. 
The risk of a 10-fold overdose, by the use of a 5 ml presentation for the youngest children, has been 
addressed. The conclusion not  to develop a smaller presentation for these children is acceptable since it  is 
a temporary replacement from oral administration, handled and administered by highly trained medical 
professionals in hospital.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
No  new clinical data  have been submitted  in  this  paediatric extension of indication,  which was  considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
The  previously  submitted  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies,  including  juvenile  toxicity 
studies,  included and  reviewed in  the  Briviact iMAA,  are summarised hereafter. The  relevant findings are 
reflected in the  Product Information. 
An updated environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been provided in this submission 
2.3.1.  Toxicology 
Reproduction toxicity 
Prenatal  and postnatal  development,  including maternal function 
Rats were dosed orally up  to 600  mg/kg, twice  daily with  10  hours apart, from gestation  day 6 to  day 20 
of lactation. The F1 pups were exposed to BRV and to its  metabolites irrespective of the dose administered 
to the mothers indicating that BRV and possibly metabolites were present in the mother’s milk. An increased 
liver weight  was  noted  from 300  mg/kg in  the  F0  generation. In the  F1  generation, at  BRV doses of  600 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

mg/kg,  up  to  13%  lower  body weight  loss  was  observed during  post-natal  day  (PND)  10-14  and  14-17 
resulting in  lower body weight of up  to - 5.2% on  post-natal day 17 and  lower mean body weights  during 
the  post-weaning period. In  addition, the  mean age of attainment  of vaginal patency was  delayed 2 days 
compared to controls at 600 mg/kg. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for F0 maternal effects, 
F0 and F1  generation reproductive toxicity and F1  generation functional/neurobehavioral development was 
set to 600 mg/kg, giving a margin to maximum human exposure of 17. The NOAEL for female F1 generation 
neonatal/postnatal  development is  300  mg/kg due  to slightly  delayed vaginal patency, and for  males the  
NOAEL was set to 600  mg/kg, giving a margin to maximum human exposure of 6 and 17, respectively. 
Studies with offspring (juvenile animals)  
Juvenile rats and dogs were evaluated from postnatal day 4-70 and 4-276,  respectively, corresponding to 
neonatal to early (0 to 12 years) and adolescent (12 to 18 years) stages of development in humans. Juvenile 
rats were dosed by oral gavage at 150,  300 and 600  mg/kg between postnatal day 4 to  70, followed by a 
30-day  recovery period.  The  main  findings  were lower  absolute  brain  weights,  -5.2%  to  -11.4%  at  600 
mg/kg  in  males and  females on postnatal  days 22,  71  and  100,  corresponding with  shorter  brain  length 
and width.  At 150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg, the lower absolute brain weights were of lesser amplitude (-0.1%  
to -6.5%). There were no relevant differences in relative brain weights between control and treated groups 
and there  was no histopathology  observed at any dose. In addition,  there  were no  adverse effects in any 
of the behavioural tests performed, apart from a slightly increased startle response on postnatal day 78 in 
males and  females in  the  high-dose group.  An  additional  study in  rats  at  postnatal  days  22,  71  and  100 
showed that  mean absolute  and relative (to  final body weight)  brain  weights  were similar within  sexes in 
untreated animals on the three days studied. The percentage of variation between maximum and minimum 
absolute  brain weight  values within  the  three  evaluation ages ranged from  -12%  to  -26%  for  males and 
from -14%  to  -19%  for females. Thus,  the  differences seen in  the  BRV treated  juvenile rats  were  within 
the range of differences seen inter-individually at the  same developmental ages in untreated rats. 
Reversible centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy, accompanied with higher  liver weights,  was observed 
in  both  sexes. The size  and number  of hyaline  droplets in  the  kidneys of  males given 300  mg/kg  or  600 
mg/kg  increased  on  postnatal  day  71,  a  finding  that  was  no  longer  present  on  postnatal  day  100.  The 
hyaline  droplets  were  considered a  male  rat-specific change.  Lower  prostate  weight  in  males given  600 
mg/kg, only on postnatal  day 71, was  without  concurrent histological findings.  All the  findings in  the liver 
and kidney were also seen in repeat-dose toxicity studies in adult rats. The NOAEL for rat pup growth and 
development, including  central nervous system (CNS)  development, was set at 150  mg/kg in females and 
300mg/kg in males, giving exposure margin to maximum human exposure of 4. The NOAEL for reproductive 
toxicity was 600 mg/kg, giving an exposure to maximum human exposure of 10. Exposure margins in adult 
rats, based on NOAEL  and area under the  curve (AUC)  values derived from the  main repeat-dose toxicity 
study, generate a margin to clinically relevant exposure of approximately 5-8.  
In addition  to studies in  rats, juvenile dogs were dosed by oral gavage at 15,  30 and 100  mg/kg between 
postnatal  day  4  to  276  (9  months  duration),  followed  by  a  56-day  recovery period.  The  main  findings 
concerned a partially to fully reversible decrease in thyroid hormone T4 level, seen mainly in females given 
100  mg/kg.  At  the  same  dose,  changes  in  the  liver  parameters were  noted,  as  well  as  brown  pigment 
accumulation  (most  likely  porphyrin),  centrilobular  and  periportal  fibrosis,  bile  duct  hyperplasia, 
hepatocellular hypertrophy  and  degeneration,  associated  with  higher  liver  weights  and  concretion  in  the 
gall  bladder.  The  effects  on  the  liver  were  partially  or  fully  reversible, apart  from  the  brown  pigment 
accumulation  and  concretion in  the  gall  bladder. A  reversible decrease in  thymus  weight  in  females was 
also seen and  was accompanied by a  slight  increase in  severity of thymic  atrophy. All  the  findings  in  the 
liver, thyroid and thymus were also seen in repeat-dose toxicity studies  in adult dogs. In another study  in 
juvenile dogs,  the  pups  were dosed at  15,  50  and  100  mg/kg  between postnatal  days  4  to  31.  In males 
only, a  lower bone mineral content,  bone  area and  bone mineral density  in femur was  seen, as well  as a 
shorter femoral length, lower bone mineral content and density in L3-L5 lumbar vertebral column. However, 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

these  effects were not  seen in  the  longer duration,  main  9-month  study  in  juvenile dogs  using  the same 
dosage regimen. The NOAEL for dog pup growth and development, including CNS development, was set at 
30  mg/kg, giving no margin to  maximum human exposure. Similarly, in adult  dogs, based on NOAEL  and 
AUC  values  derived  from  the  pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  study,  no  margin  was  observed to  clinically 
relevant exposure. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  MAH  has  submitted  an  updated  ERA  in  this  application  which  accounts  for  the  extended  paediatric 
indication, but no new data has been provided.  The MAH concludes that the inclusion of children ≥1 month 
to <4 years of age in the indication is not expected to impact the default FPEN value of 0.01  previously used 
for the PECSurface Water calculation and consequently the existing PECSurface Water of 1 µg/L remains valid.  
A  Phase  II of  the  ERA  with  environmental  fate  and  effects  analysis was  performed in  the  initial  MAA  of 
Briviact. The  PEC/PNEC  ratio  for microorganisms was  below  0.1.  The  PEC/PNEC  ratios for  surface water, 
groundwater and sediments were below 1. 
The ERA concludes that  the  proposed use of  BRV is  considered unlikely to  represent an  unacceptable risk 
to  water,  sewage  treatment  plants  and  sediment.  There  are  therefore  no  changes  to  the  proposed 
precautionary measures to  be taken for administration,  disposal and labelling as described in the  existing 
ERA. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  non-clinical  aspects  of  BRV  were  thoroughly  evaluated  during  the  original  Marketing  Authorisation 
procedure for Briviact and no new non-clinical studies  were submitted  in  support of the present extension 
of indication  application.  This is acceptable since the  already assessed juvenile studies cover the relevant 
age span. In the previously conducted juvenile studies, rats and dogs were evaluated from postnatal day 4 
to 70  and 4 to 276,  respectively, corresponding to neonatal to early (0 to 12  years) and adolescent (12 to 
18 years) stages of development in humans.  
The data from the available non-clinical juvenile toxicity studies have not identified any new or unique risks 
with  regards to the safety of BRV in  a juvenile population. 
The findings are adequately reflected in the SmPC and the CHMP agreed that no further updates are needed. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From  a  non-clinical  point  of  view, the  CHMP  agreed that  there  are no  objections regarding  the  proposed 
extension of the indication. 
The  CHMP  agrees with  the  ERA  conclusions  that  BRV  is  unlikely  to  represent a  risk  to  the  environment 
under  the  proposed conditions  of  use  and  no  changes  to  the  precautionary  measures described in  the  
existing ERA are needed.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
The BRV paediatric  development program supporting  the  extension of  indication  in  children  ≥1  month  to 
<4 years of age, consists of 1 completed study (N01263)  and 1 ongoing  long-term safety study (N01266) 
(Pool Paediatric Studies),  is summarized in Table  1. In addition,  an IV PK, safety and tolerability study in 
paediatrics ≥1 month  to  <16  years of age with  epilepsy (EP0065)  is included  in this  application.  The final 
N01263  clinical  study  report  was  previously  submitted  in  the  first  paediatric  extension  application 
(EMEA/H/C/003898/II/0010/G). 
Table 1: Phase 2/3  studies of BRV in paediatric study participants  with epilepsy 
The following modelling and simulation studies are included in this  application in support of extrapolation:  
•  CL0187:  A  population  PK  (popPK)  study  in  paediatric  study  participants  with  POS  (previously 
submitted  in the initial  paediatric extension application).   
•  CL0258:  An exposure-response modelling study  of BRV as  adjunctive therapy in  paediatric  study 
participants with  POS (previously submitted  in the initial  paediatric extension application).  
•  CL0428:  An  extension of  CL0258  to  paediatric  study  participants  ≥1  month  to  <  4  years of  age

(new  information  in  the  current  submission,  which  includes  comparisons  of  the  modelling 
projections on efficacy with  the open-label efficacy data collected in N01263  and N01266). 
In addition to the modelling and simulation studies, pooled safety data from the following 2 paediatric BRV 
studies that  comprise Pool Paediatric Studies are included in this application:  
− N01263:  A completed open-label, Phase 2 study of BRV in paediatric participants with epilepsy, including 
participants with  POS.  
− N01266: An ongoing open-label long-term study of BRV in paediatric participants with epilepsy, including  
participants  who enrolled from N01263  and at  least 100  directly enrolled participants  with  POS who have 
at least 1 year of BRV exposure.  
Further support of the proposed paediatric indication is provided by updated safety data from 2 adult safety 
pools included in the  initial  Marketing Authorization Application (MAA):  Pool S4 and Pool Monotherapy. No  
new  study participants  were added to  these  pools since the  initial  MAA or initial  paediatric extension (for 
patients  ≥4  to  <  16  years of  age)  applications  were reviewed; however,  the  clinical  cut-off  date  for  the 
current application  provides data  for approximately 3  years of additional  exposure to  BRV compared  with 
the initial  paediatric extension application (from 4 years to 16  years of age). 
Lastly, post  marketing data from paediatric patients (data  cut-off date: 14  Jul 2020)  including  a literature 
review as well as reference to previously submitted adult data are included 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of BRV was investigated in paediatrics in studies N01263,  EP0065 and in the ongoing 
study N01266.   
An oral popPK model was previously developed, using  exposure data from study  N01263,  to  describe the  
PKs of BRV in  paediatrics aged ≥1 month  to  <16  years (Report no. CL0187).  The model was assessed in 
the  initial  paediatric  extension  of  indication  procedure. In  this  application,  the  popPK model  was  further 
extended to include exposure data  from study  N01266  (Report no.  CL0428  external validation). Based on 
the paediatric popPK model, different weight-based dosing schemes for oral BRV, that would result in  BRV 
steady state plasma concentrations in  the range of adults receiving 200 mg/day (maximum recommended 
therapeutic dose), were simulated. Population PK/PD analyses for BRV and LEV were performed to support 
the  extrapolation of  effect between adults  and paediatrics (≥1 month  to  <4  years). A summary of  the PK 
and PK/PD modelling and simulation studies to  support the indication  for BRV as adjunctive therapy in the 
treatment of POS in paediatric patients ≥1  month of age with  epilepsy is presented in Table  2 hereafter.

In the initial paediatric extension of indication variation (for patients ≥4 to < 16 years of age) BRV PK data 
came from sparse sampling in  the Phase 2a study  N01263  where study  participants had received at  least 
7  days of treatment.  This  study  was performed in  participants  aged ≥1  month  to  <16  years. All  PK data 
were modelled in CL0187,  including the data from participants below the age of 4. Covariates investigated 
to explain interparticipant variability included: 
•  Demographic and physiological covariates, ie, postconceptional age, sex, (lean) body weight,  race, 
ethnicity,  and renal function (estimated glomerular filtration  rate)  
•  Covariates  that  are  specific  for  treatment  of  epilepsy,  ie,  use  of  the  antiepileptic  drugs  (AEDs) 
carbamazepine (CBZ),  valproate (VPA), phenytoin  (PHT),  and  phenobarbital/Primidone (PB);  use 
of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-inducing AEDs in  general; and use of combinations of AEDs  
•  Covariates  that  are  relevant  due  to  the  PK  properties  of  BRV,  ie,  use  of  CYP3A4  or  CYP2C19 
inhibitors 
The PK of BRV could be described by a linear 1-compartment model with  first order absorption. Allometric 
scaling factors  for CL/F  and  V/F  were fixed to  the  theoretical values of  0.75  and 1.00,  respectively. Lean 
body mass was used as a metric for body size. The covariates that proved to be relevant and were retained 
in the  final model were use of CBZ, PB, and VPA, and lean body weight.  Use of the metabolic inducers PB 
and CBZ increased CL/F  by 40.8%  and 47.9%, respectively, while VPA decreased Cl/F by 10.1%. 
An exposure-response modelling study  (CL0258)  of BRV as adjunctive  therapy in  children with  POS, was 
conducted  to  support  the  dosing  regimens.  CL0258  was  based  on  Phase  3  PK/PD  data  from  adults  and 
children who  received LEV and on  Phase 2  and 3 PK/PD data from adults  who received BRV as well as PK 
data from children in N01263.  The LEV PK/PD model was used to assess if and how the PK/PD relationship 
scales from adults to paediatric subjects. The final objectives of the analysis were to scale the existing adult 
population  PK/PD  model  for  BRV  into  children,  using  the  information  from  a  combined  adult-paediatric 
PK/PD model for LEV, a compound with  the same primary MoA, and to predict the effective dose of BRV in 
children  aged 4  to  16  years. Using  the  popPK  model  of CL0187,  doses  were determined  in  CL0258  that 
resulted in the same exposure as therapeutic doses in adults. 
Population PK modelling of oral BRV in paediatric patients  aged > 1 month  
The previously developed BRV paediatric popPK model, based on exposure data from Study N01263, was 
a  one compartment  model  with  first  order absorption and  an  allometrically scaled effect  of  body size  on 
clearance (CL) and Vc (fixed allometric exponents). In report CL0428,  this  model included body weight  as 
a metric for body size. Coadministration effects on CL of inducer AEDs were also included. The model was 
updated  by  including  data  from  the  long-term  follow-up  (LTFU)  study  N01266  (Study  report  CL0428 
external validation). The updated  model is considered as the  final model since it  includes  more paediatric 
data.  
The analysis was performed using Nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM,  Version 7.4.3) and the first 
order  conditional  estimation  method  with  interaction.  The  study  designs  for  N01263  and  N01266  are 
summarized below.  
N01263  was  an  open-label,  single-arm,  multicenter,  fixed  3-step  up-titration  study  evaluating  the  PK, 
safety, and efficacy of BRV in  children aged≥ 1  month  to  <16  years with  epilepsy. BRV oral solution  was 
administered at weekly increasing doses of approximately 0.4 mg/kg twice a day (bid),  0.8 mg/kg bid, and 
1.6  mg/kg  bid  for  subjects ≥8  years  of  age  and  0.5  mg/kg  bid,  1.0  mg/kg  bid,  and  2.0  mg/kg  bid  for 
subjects <8 years of age. The doses did not exceed a maximum of 50, 100 and 200  mg/day, respectively. 
The overall planned study duration per subject was 8 weeks. Two to three PK samples were taken per visits, 
with  one visit for each of three dosing levels.

N01266 is an ongoing open-label, single-arm, multicenter, long-term study to evaluate safety and efficacy 
of BRV oral solution  and oral tablets  used as adjunctive treatment  in paediatric participants with  epilepsy. 
N01266  is  a  LTFU  to  N01263  and  EP0065,  which  enrolled  only  subjects  with  either  focal  or  generalized 
epilepsy (1  month  to  <  16  years of  age), but  also  includes direct  enrolment  of  subjects  4  years  to  <17 
years of  age who  have focal  epilepsy.  Participants  enrolled  from  other  studies  continue  their  treatment. 
Directly enrolled subjects  enter N01266  at  the screening visit  and then  participate in  up to  3 weeks of an 
up-titration  period. If a  directly enrolled subject demonstrates, acceptable tolerability  and seizure control 
on the  same daily dose of BRV (no  lower than  1 mg/kg/day) for 7±2  days during  the  up-titration  period, 
the subject will attend  the entry visit and enter the  evaluation period on that  dose. 
The maximum dose is 5 mg/kg/day, not to  exceed a dose of 200  mg/day in subjects with  body weights  > 
40  kg. Pharmacokinetic samples are collected  at the  entry  visit, the  yearly evaluation visit/final  visit,  the 
early  discontinuation  visit  and  whenever  the  subject  experiences a  serious  adverse  event  (SAE).  Data 
available  in  the  current  analysis  are  from  227  subjects  (data  cut-off  20  January  2020).  Planned  total 
enrolment is approximately 600 subjects. 
A summary of categorical and continuous covariates included in the updated PK dataset is provided in Table 
4 and Table 5.

A total  of 855  concentration records from 232  individuals were included in the  updated analysis (Table 6). 
Only concentrations up  to  up to  180  days after first administration  was included,  which  is in  line with  the  
range of seizure count  data that  were analysed in the external validation of the BRV popPK/PD model (see 
section  2.4.3.  PK/PD modelling).  This  was also  the  main  reason for  data  exclusions  in  study  N01266. In 
study  N01266,  less  than  4%  of  the  observations were  considered  outliers  and  were  excluded from  the 
analysis.  Handling  of  missing  data,  data  exclusions  and  outliers  in  study  N01263  were  assessed  in  the 
previous application ((EMEA/H/C/003898/II/0010/G).

The AED coadministration covariates were reassessed. Additionally, the potential association between post-
conceptional  age  (PCA) and  CL  was  assessed using  a  sigmoid  Emax  model  to  investigate  potential  age-
related maturation  of BRV CL.

IV  PK study (EP0065) 
EP0065 was a Phase 2, multicenter,  open-label study to evaluate the  PK, safety, and tolerability of IV BRV 
administered as a 15-minute iv infusion and an IV bolus (up to 2-minute infusion) in study participants ≥1 
month  to <16  years of age with  epilepsy. Participants  received at least 1-2  consecutive doses of BRV (for 
further  information  about  the  study  design,  see section  2.5.1.  Studies  EP0065).  For  IOB  (initiating  oral 
BRV) and IIB (initiating  IV BRV) participants,  the  maximum BRV dose was 4  mg/kg/day. For OLB  (open-
label BRV) and  RxB (prescribed-BRV) participants,  the  maximum BRV dose was  5  mg/kg/day (rounded). 
No  study  participants received a dose greater than  BRV 200  mg/day. Study  drug exposure during the  IV 
PK Period is provided in Table 8.

Table 8 Study drug exposure during the iv PK period (SS-iv) 
PK  samples were  collected  at  pre-dose, and  15  min  and  3  h  post-dose  following  two  IV  administrations 
(where the first sampling occasion was following the first IV administration). 45 children (out of 50 children) 
were included in the  pharmacokinetic evaluation (PK-PPS). 
The main  reason for exclusions were no measurable postdose  plasma samples. One subject (in  the  ≥2  to 
<6 years age cohort [RxB/bolus group]) was excluded, since the BRV concentrations were above the upper 
LOQ (20 000 ng/mL) at the 15-minutes and 3-hour postdose timepoints, even after a 100-fold dilution step. 
These high concentrations were thought  to be due to  contamination of the  sample during  blood sampling. 
One study participant in the ≥1 month  to <2 years age cohort (RxB/bolus group) had plasma concentration 
above the upper LOQ (>20 000 ng/mL) at the 15-minute postdose time point, and the value remained high 
(7280  ng/mL)  at  the  3-hour  postdose time  point.  The sample  that  had  a  concentration  greater than  the  
upper LOQ was considered an outlier and was not included in the summary statistics. 
Most  of  the  plasma  samples were  collected  following  the  first  IV  dose  (Visit  3).  A  summary  of  Briviact 
plasma concentrations at  Visit 3  are shown  in Table  9 and  Table 10,  whereas plasma concentrations for 
the different age cohorts are graphically displayed in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Plasma concentrations of BRV relative to iv administration of BRV by Age Group  
Absorption 
No specific studies have been performed to evaluate the  absorption of BRV in paediatrics. 
In  adults,  BRV  is  completely  and  rapidly  absorbed  throughout  the  gastrointestinal  tract  after  oral 
administration.  There  is  no  pre-systemic  metabolism  or  active  (efflux)  transport.  The  high  oral 
bioavailability of approximately 100%  is not  affected by food. As BRV is a Biopharmaceutics Classification 
System Class-I drug, it is expected that the BRV absorption profile in paediatric patients after administration 
of a tablet  or oral solution is similar to that  in adults. 
Distribution 
BRV is weakly bound  to plasma proteins  in  adults (≤20%)  and shows  a nearly even distribution  between 
plasma and blood. No  relevant change in  the low plasma protein binding is expected to occur in paediatric 
patients. 
The volume of distribution  of BRV is 0.5 L/kg in adults.  Based on the updated paediatric popPK model, the 
apparent volume distribution  of BRV in the  paediatric population was  estimated to  71.3  L for a total  body 
weight  of 70  kg (95%  CI: 65.0,  77.7 L). 
Metabolism 
In  paediatrics,  the  plasma  clearance  was  estimated  to  4.17  L/h  (normalised  to  a  70  kg  person).  This 
estimate is comparable to that reported with the  previous popPK model. 
Expression of the  amidase enzyme, which  represents the  main  disposition  pathway  of BRV and  accounts 
for  60%  of  metabolism,  is not  known  to  be  age dependent  and  it  is  assumed  to  be  widely expressed at 
birth.  The  secondary hydroxylation pathway,  on the  other  hand,  is supported  by cytochrome P450  (CYP) 
2C19 and accounts for 30% of metabolism, which has been reported to have a fractional expression of 0.23 
at birth  relative to  adults, a time to  half adult expression of 0.99  year, and a fractional expression of 0.92 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99325/2022 
Page 23/86 
 
 
 
 
 
or 92%  of  adults  at  the  age of  4 years (Johnson  et  al, 2006).  Therefore, the  ontogeny of  this  secondary 
disposition pathway  could have an effect of BRV metabolism and contribute to  a lower clearance in young 
children. However, such an effect was not evidenced in the small dataset of paediatric subjects (see section 
Population  PK modelling).  None  of  the  3  metabolites  are pharmacologically active.  The concentrations  of 
BRV  and  the  3 metabolites  of  BRV were  determined  in  all  plasma  samples collected  in  paediatric  study 
N01263.  The  results  indicated  that  the  plasma  concentrations  of  the  metabolites  in  paediatric  study 
participants were similar to those observed in healthy adults.     
Elimination 
No specific studies have been performed to evaluate the excretion of BRV in paediatric subjects. In adults, 
BRV  is  primarily  eliminated  from  the  systemic  circulation  by  renal  excretion  following  extensive 
biotransformation.  The  terminal  half-life  (t½)  of  BRV  in  adults  is  approximately  9  hours.  As  BRV  is 
extensively biotransformed with  <10%  excreted unchanged  by the  kidneys, renal maturation  in  younger 
children is not expected to influence its clearance significantly. 
The  mean (SD)  plasma half-life  of  BRV in  children,  estimated  by  simulation  in  CL0187,  ranged from  5.6 
hours (1.9  hours) in  the group from 0  to <  1 years to  9.1  hours (3.1  hours) in the  group from 15  to <16 
years of age. 
Special populations 
Age and gender 
The previous paediatric popPK analysis (Report no. CL0187)  did not  identify a significant  effect of gender, 
or  age on  BRV CL.  Clinical  studies  in  adults  with  epilepsy showed  that  gender and  race does  not  have a 
clinically significant influence on the plasma concentrations of BRV. 
Race 
The previous paediatric popPK analysis (Report no. CL0187)  did not  identify a significant  effect of race on 
BRV CL.  Based on these data, it  is expected that  BRV PK profile in paediatric subjects would be consistent 
with  the  known  PK  profile  of  BRV  derived  from  adult  studies  where  there  were  no  clinically  relevant 
differences in the PK of BRV among Asian, Black, and Caucasian subjects.  
Body weight 
Body weight  was identified  as a covariate for both  CL and V.  
Genetic polymorphism 
The effect of genetic polymorphisms was not evaluated in the  paediatric studies. 
Results from a PK study in healthy Japanese adults demonstrated that BRV AUCt underwent small increases 
as  shown  by values of  16.6,  20.0,  and  23.1  μg.h/mL  (normalized to  a  dose of  1  mg/kg)  in  homozygous 
extensive metabolizer (EM),  heterozygous EM, and poor metabolizer (PM) subjects, respectively; whereas, 
the  hydroxy  metabolite  decreased  to  less  than  1/10th,  from  2.55  (homozygous  EM  subjects)  to  0.968 
(heterozygous  EM  subjects)  to  0.191  (PM  subjects)  μg.h/mL  (normalized  to  a  dose  of  1mg/kg).  The 
carboxylic acid  metabolite and  hydroxyacid metabolite AUCs  were not  consistently modified among  the  3 
genotypes. These observations indicate  that  CYP2C19  is the  isoenzyme responsible for  the  hydroxylation 
of BRV into  hydroxyl metabolite, and that  this  pathway is secondary compared to hydrolysis. As such, the 
potential  for CYP2C19-mediated interactions  with  BRV is  expected to  be low. Thus, no  dose adjustment  is 
expected  to  be  needed  in  paediatric  patients  with  CYP2C19  polymorphisms  or  paediatric  patients  who 
received CYP2C19-inhibiting  drugs concomitantly with  BRV.

Renal and hepatic impairment 
The effects of renal and hepatic impairment were not  evaluated in the paediatric studies.  
Based on renal impairment from adults,  no  dose adjustment is  recommended for paediatric  patients  with 
renal impairment. BRV is not recommended in paediatric patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing 
dialysis due to lack of data. 
In adults  with  chronic liver disease corresponding to  Child-Pugh  classes A, B and C,  exposure to BRV was 
increased by 50%, 57% and 59%, respectively, compared with matched healthy controls. A maximum daily 
dose of BRV 150 mg administered in 2 divided doses is recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment 
in adults, and a starting dose of BRV 50 mg/day should be considered 
Based on these data, a starting dose of BRV 1.5 mg/kg/day for body weight below 10 kg, 1 mg/kg/day for 
body weight ≥10 to 20 kg, and 1 mg/kg/day for body weight ≥20 to < 50 kg is recommended for paediatric 
patients  aged  ≥1  month  to  4  years  at  any  stage  of  hepatic  impairment.  Based  on  the  maximum  dose 
recommended  for  adults,  similar  BRV  maximums  (4.5  mg/kg/day  for  body  weight  ≥3  to  <10  kg,  4 
mg/kg/day for body weight ≥10 to <20kg and 3mg/kg/day for body weight ≥20 to 50 kg) are recommended 
for paediatric patients aged ≥1 month to  <4 years with  any stage of hepatic impairment. 
Drug-drug interactions 
As in adults, for paediatric patients prescribers should consider increasing the BRV dose in patients starting 
treatment  with  rifampicin  and  decreasing  when  stopping  rifampicin  treatment.  For  paediatric  subjects, 
coadministration  with  PB  and  CBZ increased BRV clearance. The  estimated  increase  was  39%  (95%  CI: 
19%/62%)  and 27% (95%  CI: 14%/42%)  for PB and CBZ, respectively. Coadministration with VPA or PHT 
did not have any significant impact on BRV clearance. 
Simulations to establish dosing recommendations for oral administration 
Simulations  of the  proposed dosing  schedule for BRV, based on  the  updated paediatric popPK model, are 
shown in Figure 5. The population estimates from the final adult patient popPK model (Report no. CL0028) 
were used to derive the target reference range of concentrations for adults receiving 100  mg BRV bid (200 
mg/day). The adult  popPK model has been assessed in an earlier application. In the simulations,  effects of 
inducer  AED  coadministration  were  excluded  from  both  adult  and  paediatric  populations  to  allow  an 
unbiased comparison. The Nhanes DXA database was used to provide demographic variables (age and body 
weight)  for both  adults and children to  drive the simulations.

2.4.3.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-response modelling was conducted to  support the proposed dosing recommendations for BRV as 
adjunctive therapy in children 1  month to <4  years of age with  POS. The modelling was based on Phase 2 
and 3 data of LEV and BRV. 
Methods 
A popPK/PD model was previously developed to describe the relationship between average concentrations 
of BRV and daily seizure frequency in adults (Report no. CL0027). In order to support the extrapolation of 
effect to paediatrics 1 month to <4 year of age, an existing LEV adult/paediatric PK/PD model was extended 
with  data from children aged 1 month to <4 year (Report no. CL0428).  The results from the combined LEV 
adult/paediatric PK/PD model was subsequently used to scale the BRV adult  PK/PD model to children  of 1 
month to  < 4 years.  
The combined adult/paediatric BRV PK/PD model was also externally validated using observed seizure count 
data from paediatrics in studies  N01263  and  N01266.  The average daily concentrations from the  updated 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

popPK  model  used  as  input  in  the  simulations.  The  external validation  was  restricted  to  records  at  the 
baseline, up-titration  and evaluation visits. N01266  is a  LTFU  study,  and the  duration of treatment  of the  
participants varied considerably. To ensure the comparability of the data with  respect to treatment duration 
for the various studies, the data from N01266  were restricted to a treatment period of up to 180  days.  
Patients starting treatment in study EP0065 were excluded from the analysis. This since the study included 
IV  administered  BRV  data  and  was  not  considered  relevant  for  the  current  analysis.  Additionally,  no 
multiple-day  recordings of baseline seizure counts  were present in  the study,  which  made the  calculation 
of change from baseline in seizure rates problematic for these patients.  
The number of subjects and data records in the PK/PD analysis are presented in  Table 11. In the  younger 
children, <4  year of age, the  number of seizures were assessed using two  48-hour  continuous video-EEG 
recordings, in contrast to older children (> 4 years) where daily seizure counts were documented in diaries. 
EEG data were available in 7  subjects and diary data were available in 22  subjects aged > 1 month  to <4 
years with  POS.

Results 
The developed adult/paediatric  LEV PK/PD model described seizure frequencies using a negative binomial 
distribution for the seizure count data and an Emax model to describe the relation between change in seizure 
count and average daily concentrations of LEV. LEV PD data indicated that the  lower age group (<4  years) 
was more severely ill compared to the previous paediatric group (> 4 years), as evidenced by much higher 
baseline seizure frequencies, with median values of 10.1 seizures/day and 0.75  seizures/day, respectively. 
The differences in baseline seizure counts between adults and paediatrics were accounted for in this model. 
A  mixture  model  approach  was  included  to  separate  a  placebo  (PBO)–like  (i.e.  non-responder)  and  a 
responder subpopulation.  According  to  the  MAH,  the  analysis  showed  that  in  study  participants  aged  ≥1 
month  to  < 4  years the  same exposure to  LEV as in  older study  participants resulted  in the  same clinical 
efficacy.  
The structure of the popPK/PD model for BRV was similar to the  model used for LEV. The adult  parameter 
estimates  were  used  from  the  existing  adult  BRV  popPK/PD  model.  A  LEV  scaling  factor  from  adults  to 
paediatrics and  adult  estimated  LEV  basal seizure  rate values were  included  in  the  BRV  PK/PD model  to 
take into account the differences in seizure frequency between adults and paediatrics. 
In the  external validation, the  typical baseline seizure count  in  the BRV PK/PD model was updated  to  the 
median baseline seizure count for the 1 month-4 years age group in studies N01263/N01266,  and therefore 
no LEV scaling factor was used. The simulated and observed median percentage change in seizure frequency 
from baseline are shown in Figure  8. Change from baseline was determined by subtracting the  logarithm 
of the  average daily seizure count  during treatment  (over a maximum of 180  days) from the  logarithm of 
the  average daily  seizure count  during  baseline,  and  the  result  was  back-transformed to  a  percentage 
change estimate.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
This  variation  concerns  the  extension  of  the  current  approved  indication  to  include  the  use  of  BRV  as 
adjunctive therapy in  patients ≥1  month to  <4 years of age with  POS. The proposed indication  covers the 
use of currently available BRV formulations: film-coated tablets, oral solution  and solution  for IV injection.  
The MAH has performed population PK and PK/PD modelling to support the extrapolation of efficacy between 
adults  and  paediatrics  (≥1  month  to  <4  years).  There  are  some  limitations  in  the  population  PK/PD 
modelling and therefore it  cannot be used to  support the extrapolation of efficacy to  children ≥1 month to  
<4 years. Extrapolation of efficacy from adults to  children above 2 years of age based on similar exposure 
may be considered adequate due  to  the  similarity of  disease between  adults  and children  in  combination 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

with  safety data. The extrapolation of efficacy from adults to  paediatric patients ≥1  month  to <2  years of 
age cannot be supported.  
The proposed therapeutic dose ranges are 1-4 mg/kg/day (recommended maintenance dose 2 mg/kg/day) 
for children weighing ≥20 to <50 kg, 1-5 mg/kg/day (recommended maintenance dose 2.5 mg/kg/day) for 
children  weighing  ≥10  to  <20  kg and  1.5-6  mg/kg/day (recommended maintenance dose 3  mg/kg/day) 
for children weighing ≥3 to <10 kg. The MAH stated that the proposed dosing regimen results in BRV steady 
state  plasma concentrations  in  the  range of  adults  (≥16  years of age)  receiving BRV 50  to  200  mg/day, 
based on population PK simulations. 
Population PK analysis 
PK samples were collected in  paediatrics in  studies N01263  (included  in the  initial  extension  application), 
EP0065 and in the  ongoing LTFU study  N01266.   
The  previous paediatric population  PK  model  was  updated  with  the  exposure  data  in  study  N01266.  The 
data used in the population PK analysis were restricted to a treatment period of up to 180  days, which was 
also the  main  reason for data  exclusions. A  sensitivity analysis was  performed by  re-estimating  the  final 
updated model with  inclusion of concentrations measured after 180 days of dosing.  The analysis indicated 
no greater differences in population PK results between the two models and therefore the exclusion of these 
observations is acceptable.  
Less than  4%  of  the  observations were considered outliers  in study  N01266  and were  excluded from  the 
analysis, which  is considered acceptable.  
Body weight  was  included as  a covariate on  V and  CL,  using  fixed allometric constants.  The  model could 
reasonably well  describe the  BRV PK  data  in  children  aged  ≥2  month  to  <  4  years (the  youngest child, 
included  in the  analysis, was 2  months  old). Age related maturation  of BRV CL  was investigated  and was 
found  not  to  further  improve the  description  of  BRV PK  in  small  children  and  hence  not  included  in  the  
model, which  is acceptable. According to the MAH,  this finding could be due to either CL being fully mature 
at birth,  or that  the data were insufficient  to detect a relationship between CL  and PCA.  
It is  noted that  the interindividual  variability in  ka is very small, which  is unexpected. However, this  is not 
considered to have any greater impact on the results from the  PK analysis. 
In  general,  the  pcVPC  seemed  adequate  across  different  weight  and  age  groups  and  there  were  no 
indications of model misspecifications in  the goodness of fit  plots. The model seem to adequately describe 
the observed concentration-time profiles.  
The previous paediatric population  PK model included effects of AED coadministration (PB, CBZ and VPA) 
on BRV CL. In the updated model, PB and CBZ still induced BRV CL, but VPA coadministration was no longer 
significant.  In  accordance  with  the  SmPC  recommendations  for  children  ≥4  years  and  adults,  these 
covariate effects are not considered clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustments are needed based 
on coadministration with  PB, CBZ, VPA or PHT.  
The MAH  associated the  increased CL in  young children with  the frequent  use of phenobarbital. However, 
covariate effects based on a  small sample size should  be interpreted  with  caution,  especially interactions 
since both substances could be influence by age (maturation) effects not accounted for. 
Exposure ranges based on  predicted steady state concentrations  from individual  CL values are considered 
acceptable due to an adequate population PK model and moderate parameter shrinkage (24%) in individual 
CL estimates. The eta-shrinkage was high for Vc and Ka, for which reason these parameters cannot be used 
for individual predictions of exposure.

To  support  the  assumption  of  a  similar  PK/PD  relationship  for  BRV  between  the  adults  and  paediatrics, 
PK/PD modelling of  LEV  adult/paediatric  data was  included  in this  application.  LEV and  BRV  interact  with 
the  same target  protein  (SV2A),  and  therefore  it  was  assumed that  the  exposure-response relationship 
between adults and paediatrics would be similar between these compounds. The LEV analysis indicated that 
paediatric data could  be described using  the  adult  PK/PD parameters, and that  the  only difference was  in 
the  basal seizure frequency. The  results from  the  LEV  modelling were  used to  support  the  scaling  of  the 
existing adult BRV PK/PD model into children.  
The BRV adult/paediatric model was externally validated by comparing simulated and observed effect data 
(seizure  counts)  in  study  N01263  and  N01266.  Although  there  were  limited  number  of  paediatrics, the  
simulations  indicated  that  the  model  underestimated  the  effect  on  seizures  in  the  younger  age  groups, 
especially in children < 4 years of age. For paediatric patients ≥4 years of age, the model could reasonably 
well describe the  effect. Due to the  limitations  in the external validation, the PK/PD model cannot be used 
to support this  extension. It  is noted  that the  observed effect on seizure counts in the paediatrics included 
in the BRV PK/PD analysis seems to be different from the effect reported in the clinical studies N01266 and 
N01263.  Due to the limited value of the  PK/PD analysis, it has not been assessed in detail.  
Simulations to support dose selection 
If  extrapolation  of  efficacy  from  adults  to  paediatrics  ≥1  month  of  age  is  considered  acceptable,  the  
posology in paediatrics aged ≥ 1 month  to <4  years can be supported by a similar exposure in children as 
compared to adults at therapeutic doses. Since Briviact is indicated for adjunctive therapy in the treatment 
of POS  with  or without  secondary generalisation, the  simulations  for BRV with  concomitant  AEDs  are the  
most relevant for this application.  
The simulations indicated higher oral Cmax values and average concentration over 24h (Cav) of BRV at steady 
state in paediatrics at the maximum proposed doses (3 mg/kg bid for weight<10  kg and 2.5  mg/kg bid for 
weight  ≥10  kg and <20  kg) as compared to  adults receiving the maximum recommended flat dose of 100 
mg bid. The simulated Cmax should be interpreted with caution due to the sparse sampling which limits the 
characterization of  the  absorption phase. The  Cmin seemed slightly  lower in  paediatrics aged  ≥1  month  to 
<4 years as compared to adults. 
The  simulations  also  indicated  that  if  the  maximum  doses  are  reduced,  there  is  a  higher  risk  that  the 
children  might  be underdosed. The  highest  dose of 3  mg/kg  bid  (6  mg/kg/day) in  children  weighing  ≥3-
<10  kg, which  is higher than  the maximum dose (5 mg/kg/day) used in  study N01266,  was also justified 
from  a  safety  perspective. Based on  the  limited  number  of  data,  the  safety  profile  of  BRV  in  paediatric 
patients  who  received oral  BRV  modal  doses >5  mg/kg/day  (n=10,  most  doses  close  to  5  mg/kg/day) 
seemed  similar  to  those  who  received  modal  doses  ≤5mg/kg/day,  with  predominant  TEAEs  related  to 
infections  and considered as not  related. No  safety signal  was identified.  In  addition,  since the  Cav is  not 
expected to exceed that  in children  ≥ 4  years, it  is  unlikely that  there would  be a different safety profile. 
The neurologists are also used to titrate  the  dose of anti-epileptic  drugs to  find the  lowest dose providing 
an adequate efficacy and acceptable safety profile.  
Regarding the  proposed IV posology, the  MAH clarified that bioequivalence of the IV and oral formulations 
of  BRV  has  been  discussed  in  the  previously  submitted  paediatric  extension  application,  where  it  was 
concluded that  no dose adjustment was needed in adults and  in paediatric patients ≥4  years of age when 
switching  between oral and iv dosing.  
To support the IV posology, the oral paediatric population PK model was updated by including IV data from 
the paediatric study EP0065.  Only limited information was given about the model. However, the model will 
not be further assessed since it could not be used to simulate Cmax (due to the sparse sampling). Regarding 
Cav, it  is  agreed that  comparable Cav is expected after administration of  the same iv and  oral dose, which 
also seemed to  be supported by this model.  
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99325/2022 
Page 32/86 
 
 
 
 
A higher IV Cmax is however expected at similar oral and IV doses. This might be a concern since the oral 
Cmax in paediatrics seemed to slightly  exceed the  adult  exposure range at  the  proposed maximum doses. 
The maximum IV dose in  study  EP0065  (4.6  mg/kg/day) was also  lower than  the  proposed maximum IV 
dose (6  mg/kg/day). As  discussed above, a  lower maximum dose  might  result  in  that  more subjects are 
being  underdosed and therefore is  not  supported. With  regards to  the  expected higher  IV Cmax, the  MAH 
provided treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) data from study EP0065, which together with the fact 
that IV infusions occur only in a hospital setting,  where subjects are already closely observed, support that 
no  additional  monitoring  is  needed  during  IV  administration.  In  addition,  there  is  no  risk  of  cardiac 
arrythmias or AV block after IV administration  of BRV. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  extrapolation  of  efficacy from  adults  to  paediatric  patients  ≥1  month  to  <2  years of  age  cannot  be 
supported. The proposed posology of BRV in  children above 2  years of age is supported by  population PK 
modelling  and  simulations  with  the  aim  to  match  adult  reference exposure levels.  It  is  agreed that  the  
proposed dosing recommendation in paediatric patients match the exposure of the adult patients.   
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Background 
The MAH  sought  CHMP  scientific  advice and received feedback from the  CHMP  regarding UCB’s  proposed 
strategy (EMEA/H/SA/681/11/2020/PA/PED/III)  to  extrapolate efficacy from data  in  adults  receiving BRV 
as adjunctive treatment. Efficacy will  be extrapolated from data in adults and children receiving adjunctive 
LEV  and  efficacy data  from  adults  receiving  BRV  as  adjunctive  treatment  using  the  exposure-response 
modeling study  CL0428.  In addition,  the  extrapolation model has  been externally validated using  seizure 
count  data  paediatric  patients  with  POS  and  generalized  seizures collected  in  studies  from  N01263  and 
N01266  to consider all available BRV clinical data in  response to  the CHMP  advice. The MAH  has provided 
further information and discussion regarding the similarities and dissimilarities between the mode of action 
and  age-related responses of  BRV  and  LEV.  Because  the  primary  mechanism  is  similar  and  LEV  did  not 
show  any  age-related  change  in  response, it  is  unlikely that  BRV  would  show  an  age-related  change  in 
response for the  following reasons: 
• 
• 
BRV’s primary MoA is similar to LEV, and LEV did not show any age-related change in response. 
BRV is highly selective for SV2A and does not have another known MoA. 
Efficacy  extrapolation  was  considered  acceptable  by  the  PDCO  in  the  frame  of  the  PIP  request  for 
modification EMEA-000332-PIP01-08-M06  with  some caveats that  were also raised by the CHMP.   
2.5.1.  Main studies 
Study N01263 (previously submitted and reviewed in the previous paediatric extension of indication, only 
summarised below) 
A  phase 2a,  open-label, single-arm,  multicenter, fixed  3-step up-titration study  in 
participants aged between ≥1 month and <16 years with epilepsy evaluating the PK, 
safety, and efficacy of BRV 
Enrollment  was stratified by  age group  (at least  30 infants  and toddlers [28  days to  23 months];  at  least 
30 paediatric participants [2  to 11 years]; and a maximum of 30 adolescents [12 to <16  years]) to ensure 
that  a substantial  number of participants were included in each category.

All participants  completed  a 1-week Baseline Period, followed by a  3-week Evaluation Period with  weekly 
fixed  3-step  up-titration  of  the  BRV dose.  Participants  may have  been  eligible  for  conversion to  a  LTFU 
study (N01266)  upon completion of at least the lowest dose level (DL) of the Evaluation Period. Participants 
not choosing the option to enter N01266  or participants discontinuing due to not being able to tolerate the  
lowest  BRV dose or due  to other  reasons entered a Down-Titration  Period of up  to 2  weeks followed by a 
2-week study  drug-free Safety Period and a final Safety Visit. 
BRV oral solution was administered at weekly increasing doses of approximately 0.4mg/kg, 0.8mg/kg, and 
1.6mg/kg bid for participants ≥8 years of age, and 0.5mg/kg, 1.0mg/kg, and 2.0mg/kg bid for participants 
<8 years of age. 
Primary objectives 
To characterize the steady-state PK of BRV and its metabolites in subjects from ≥1 month  to <16 years of 
age, evaluate their relationship with physiological developmental variables, and develop dosing adaptations. 
Secondary objectives 
• 
• 
• 
To document the short-term safety and tolerability of BRV 
To gain preliminary information on  the efficacy of BRV in paediatric subjects with various epileptic 
syndromes 
To assess compliance to study drug oral solution 
Efficacy endpoints:

Meaningful comparisons across age groups should be interpreted with caution and considered as preliminary 
due  to  the  limited  sample size,  particularly in  the  ≥12  to  <16  years group,  the  open-label design  of  the 
study,  and  the  short  duration  of  BRV  treatment  (3  weeks  overall; 1  week  at  each  dose).  Discussion  of 
seizure type and syndrome analyses was  limited based on the  small number of subjects available in each 
subgroup; data for seizure types and syndromes (occurring in at least 3 subjects) are provided in the tables 
and listings.  A minimum  baseline seizure count  was not  required for study  entry; therefore, subjects who 
did not report baseline seizures (n=20)  could not be included in any of the percent change analyses.

Seizure status (seizure free/not seizure free) for subjects ≥1 month  to <2 years of age, based on 24-hour 
EEG data,  did  not change from Baseline to  V5/EDV for most subjects overall or by seizure category (POS 
and primary generalized seizures [PGS]). A total of 5 subjects (19.2%) who were not seizure free at baseline 
were  seizure free based  on  a  24-hour  EEG  at  V5/EDV.  This  included  2  subjects  (7.7%)  with  POS  and  3 
subjects (11.5%)  with  PGS. Two subjects (7.7%)  who  were seizure free at baseline were not  seizure free 
at V5/EDV (1 subject [3.8%] each with POS and PGS).

and seizure category (FAS) 
Reduction from Baseline  to the  end of the  Evaluation Period in the  number of seizure days 
The overall mean (±SD) reduction in the number of seizures days (standardized to a 28-day duration) from 
the Baseline Period to the Evaluation Period was 1.6 days (±6.5  days). The median reduction in the number 
of seizure days from the Baseline Period to the  Evaluation  Period was  0.0 days (Table 8.4.1).  The overall 
mean reduction was similar in subjects with  PGS (1.7  days [±4.9  days]) and subjects with  POS (1.5 days 
[±7.8  days]); both  groups also had similar median reductions (0.0  days). 
The overall mean (±SD) reduction in the number of seizures days (standardized to a 28-day duration) from 
the  Baseline Period to the  Evaluation  Period was highest  in  ≥1  month  to <2  years group (3.2  days [±8.0 
days]), compared with the ≥2 to <12 years group, which had the smallest mean reduction (0.7 days [±5.6 
days]), and the  ≥12 to <16  years group (1.7  days [±5.7  days]). 
The median reduction in the number of seizure days from the  Baseline Period to the Evaluation Period was 
2.0 days for the ≥1 month  to <2 years group compared with  0.0 days for the ≥2 to <12  years and ≥12 to 
<16 years groups.

The overall median percent reduction in the number of seizures days was 4.8% (range: -533% to 100%;). 
This  was due solely to  the  reduction observed in  subjects with  POS (13.6%;  range: -533%  to  100%),  as 
no median percent reduction was observed in subjects with  PGS (0.0%;  range: -75%  to 100%). 
Similar to  absolute reductions,  the  greatest median percent reduction  in  the  number of seizure days was 
observed in the  ≥1  month  to <2  years group (13.6%  [range: -75%  to  100%]),  compared with  the  ≥2 to  
<12  years group, which  had no median percent reduction  (0.0%  [range: -533%  to 100%]),  and  the ≥12 
to <16  years group (9.5%  [range: -17%  to 100%]). 
There were too few subjects in seizure categories to  make comparisons across age groups.

Study N01266 LTFU  
N01266  is an ongoing Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, LTFU  study to evaluate the  safety and 
efficacy of BRV in study participants with  epilepsy. 
Upon  enrollment,  eligible LTFU  study  participants  entered  the  Evaluation  Period and continued  their  BRV 
treatment  in  accordance  with  their  individualized  dose  at  the  completion  of  their  core  study.  Directly 
enrolled study  participants were screened and participated in up to 3  weeks of an Up-Titration  Period. If a 
DE  study participant  demonstrated,  in  the  opinion  of the  Investigator, acceptable tolerability  and  seizure 
control on the same daily dose of BRV (no lower than the minimum specified dose) for 7±2 days during the 
Up-Titration  Period, the  study participant  attended  the Entry  Visit  (EV) and entered the  Evaluation  Period 
on that dose. BRV (tablet and oral solution) was administered bid in 2 equally divided doses. All LTFU study 
participants must have been able to tolerate the minimum BRV dose specified in the core study to be eligible 
for entry into  the  Evaluation  Period of  N01266.  All  DE study  participants must  have been able to  tolerate 
at least 1mg/kg/day during the  Up-Titration Period prior to entering the Evaluation Period of N01266. 
For all study  participants enrolled in  N01266,  the  maximum BRV dose was 5.0mg/kg/day (2.5mg/kg bid), 
not to  exceed a dose of 200mg/day for study participants.  Study participants  received oral solution or oral 
tablets, as appropriate. Dose adjustments of BRV and/or concomitant AEDs were allowed at any time based 
on clinical  judgment; however, during the  Up-Titration  Period, dose adjustments for BRV were made only 
as specified by the  protocol. 
During  the  Evaluation  Period,  Minimal  Evaluation  Visits  and  Full  Evaluation  Visits  were  performed 
alternatively every month during the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter, with  a Yearly Evaluation 
Visit every 12 months.

Efficacy results 
Study participants ≥2 years  of age 
Table 20: Absolute and percent change in 28-day adjusted POS seizure frequency during Evaluation Period 
assessed by DRC (participants ≥2 years of age with  POS only) (FAS) 
Overall, participants  ≥2 years of age with  POS reported a median (minimum, maximum) absolute change 
in POS frequency from Baseline over the Evaluation Period of 7.09 (-7075.3,  715.2)  per 28-day period and 
a median (minimum,  maximum) percent change in POS frequency of 62.92%  (-693.7%,  100.0%)  per 28-
day period. The  median absolute changes from Baseline in  28-day adjusted  POS frequency were positive 
for  all  3-monthly  intervals,  supporting  that  the  number  of  seizures  observed at  Baseline from  DRC  was 
generally maintained or reduced over the course of N01266. 
The  large  median  absolute  and  percent  change  values  during  Months  1  to  3  are  attributed  to  a  study 
participant at study entry who had seizure frequency over the Evaluation Period of 8095.3, resulting in the 
absolute and  percent changes from Baseline of -7075.3  and -693.7%,  respectively. The study  participant 
received BRV treatment for 106  days before discontinuing  the study due to lack of efficacy.

Table  23: Summary of responder rate during  Evaluation Period by seizure category assessed by EEG (all 
participants <2 years of age) (FAS) 
Overall, 6  participants  (75.0%  of  all  evaluable participants  <2  years of  age) were responders during  the 
Evaluation  Period (defined  as  participants  with  a  ≥50%  reduction  in  ADF,  based  on  the  EEG  data).  This 
included  4  participants  with  POS  (100%  of  evaluable  participants  with  POS  <2  years  of  age)  and  2 
participants with  PGS (50.0%  of evaluable participants with PGS <2 years of age). 
Study EP0065 (IV administration) 
A Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerability of iv BRV administered 
as a 15-minute  iv infusion and an ≥  bolus (up  to 2-minute infusion)  in study participants ≥1 month to <16 
years of age with  epilepsy. 
The following age-based cohorts (approximately 12 study  participants/cohort): 
•  Cohort 1: ≥12  to <16 years

• 
For IOB and IIB participants:  the maximum BRV dose 4mg/kg/day  
•  No study participant  may receive a dose greater than BRV 200mg/day 
Eligibility  criteria: 
Patients  with  a diagnosis of epilepsy, aged from ≥1  month  to  <16 years of age, weight  ≥3 kg,  and being 
treated with ≥1 AED (including BRV) without a change of dose regimen for at least 7 days prior to Screening. 
PK results 
The  plasma concentrations  were  generally higher  15  minutes  after  dosing  as  compared to  3  hours  after 
dosing. The  geometric mean concentrations were 1903  (n=21)  and  1705  ng/mL  (n=19)  15 minutes  after 
administration  of the first  IV infusion and IV bolus,  respectively. The interindividual variability (geo CV%) 
was 61 and 75%. For further information, see section 2.4.2  Pharmacokinetics above. 
Safety  results 
Exposure: Overall mean (SD) study drug exposure during the study was 3.98 (3.24)  days (ranging from 1 
to 13 days). 
Adverse events

CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99325/2022 
Page 49/86 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the  most common TEAE (by preferred term [PT])  was somnolence (3  study participants  [6.0%]), 
followed by fatigue, dizziness, pyrexia, and rash (2 study participants [4.0%],  each) (Table 24). 
All other TEAEs (by PT) were experienced by ≤1 study participant  each. 
Incidences  of  TEAEs  were  generally  similar  across  age  groups.  Somnolence  was  experienced  in  the  2 
youngest age cohorts only  (1 [7.7%]  and  2 [15.4%]  study participants,  respectively, in  the  ≥1  month  to 
<2 years and ≥2 to <6  years age cohorts). 
Vital  signs 
Overall, Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) Baseline values were of no clinical 
concern for this  population.  Mean BP at each time point  fluctuated;  however, there was no obvious trend. 
In some participants,  there were somewhat large decreases from Baseline in  both  SBP and/or DBP at the  
time  points  shortly  after  infusion  at  Visit  3;  however, these  decreases were generally  short  lived.  Mean 
changes from Baseline for SBP and DBP in the 15-minute infusion and bolus infusion groups were generally 
consistent across age cohorts. 
Supportive non-clinical data 
The  extension of the  indication  as  adjunctive therapy in  the  treatment  of POS with  or without  secondary 
generalization in  children≥1 month to <4  years of age with  epilepsy is based on: 
• 
• 
For  patients  ≥2  to  <4  years:  extrapolation  of  efficacy  from  data  in  adults  receiving  BRV  as 
adjunctive treatment. 
For  patients  ≥1  month  to  <2  years: extrapolation  of  efficacy from  data  in  adults  and  children 
receiving adjunctive LEV, and efficacy data from adults receiving BRV as adjunctive treatment. 
BRV  and LEV mechanisms of action 
BRV is a  2-pyrrolidone derivative with  a high  and  selective affinity  for SV2A. LEV  and BRV are the only  2 
marketed AEDs with  binding  to  SV2A, and both  possess an  ability  to  modulate neurotransmitter  release. 
Indeed,  electrophysiological  field  recordings  in  the  rat  cornu  ammonis  (CA)1  area  of  the  hippocampus 
showed  that  BRV and  LEV  had  similar effects, inducing  or augmenting  short-term  depression under  high 
frequency stimulation  and slowing synaptic  vesicle recycling (Yang et  al, 2015).  The comparison between 
the BRV and LEV mode of action associated to their receptor binding profile is provided in the table below. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99325/2022 
Page 50/86 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 25:  BRV and LEV receptor binding profile (in  vitro) 
The affinity of BRV for SV2A binding is approximately 10- to 30-fold higher than of LEV (Gillard et al, 2011). 
The major difference between BRV and LEV in terms of MoA is the moderate and varying inhibition of fast 
Na+ current by BRV (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] around 7μM  in rat cortical neurons) and 
the  inhibition  of  high  voltage  operated calcium  currents by  LEV  (IC50  of  13.9μM  in  rat  neocortical slices 
with  maximal effect around 35% at ≥100μM) (Pisani et al, 2004).  LEV was also shown to inhibit α-amino-
3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid  (AMPA)  receptors.  However,  this  inhibition  seems to  lack 
antiseizure relevance as  it  occurred only at  a  high  concentration (from  200μM  and upwards)  and  did  not 
confer  LEV  an  ability  to  inhibit  clonic  convulsions  induced  in  vivo  by  AMPA  (Margineanu  and  Klitgaard, 
2002). 
Inhibition  of fast  Na+  current  by BRV was  seen  in  rat  cortical neurons.  Subsequent  patch  clamp  studies 
showed weaker (20 to  30%)  inhibition  of the  Na+ current  (mouse neuroblastoma cell  line, embryonic rat 
primary cortical neurons), or no effects (entorhinal  cortex neurons from sham and pilocarpine mice, adult 
mouse  CA1  pyramidal neurons,  rat  hippocampal slices).  Furthermore,  the  inhibition  in  fast  Na+  current 
seen  in  rat  cortical  neurons  did  not  translate  in  modifications  of  sustained  repetitive  firing  by  BRV, 
suggesting that  the magnitude and consistency of the inhibition  of fast Na+ currents is likely not  sufficient 
to be of clinical relevance. Therefore, the main MoA of BRV is believed to  be through  binding of SV2A. 
As  mentioned  above, LEV  also partially  inhibits  high  voltage  activated (HVA)  calcium  currents  in  cortical 
neurons,  with  an  IC50  of  about  17-fold  higher  than  the  SV2A IC50.  However,  in  rat  brain  slices,  dose-
dependent  inhibition  of  Ca2+  influx  and  of  induced  paroxysmal depolarization  shifts  (PDSs) occurred  at 
higher  concentrations  (IC50  of  141  and  180μM,  respectively  with  maximal  effect  at  300μM).  This 
significantly  higher IC50  value for  LEV inhibition  of  PDSs and  Ca2+  transients  in  the  slice preparation as 
compared with  the value calculated for the  inhibition  of Ca2+ currents in the  isolated cell preparation was 
not  seen  with  lamotrigine  (LTG).  The  role  of  this  inhibitory  effect  of  LEV  on  HVA  Ca2+  current  on  the 
antiepileptic activity of LEV remains unclear. However, due to lack of validation for inhibition of HVA Ca2+ 
currents to contribute to antiepileptic  effects and a major difference in potency between SV2A binding and 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99325/2022 
Page 51/86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inhibition  of  HVA  Ca2+  current,  only  binding  to  SV2A  is  considered  to  be  the  main  MoA  of  LEV.  This 
conclusion is further supported by (S)-stereoisomer homologues of LEV showing a rank order of affinity for 
(3H)-LEV  binding site which correlates with their seizure protection (Noyer et al, 1995). Thus, although the 
detailed  molecular  events  following  binding  of  LEV  or  BRV  to  SV2A  is  unknown,  a  significant  relation 
between in  vitro  binding  affinity for SV2A and in  vivo suppression of seizure has been established. These 
findings are further supported by studies with heterozygous SV2A-deficient mice showing a major reduction 
in the anticonvulsant activity of LEV when brain levels of SV2A were experimentally diminished but not with 
non-SV2A binding  AEDs, like VPA (Kaminski et al, 2009). 
Taken  together,  these  mechanistic  studies  demonstrate  that  LEV  and  BRV  share  SV2A  as  the  primary 
mechanism for their antiepileptic effects in epilepsy patients. 
Of note, the free plasma exposure reached at the maximal approved human dose (MAHD) for BRV and LEV 
showed a 15-  to 20-fold difference in agreement with  the reported 10- to 30-fold  higher affinity of BRV for 
binding to  SV2A than LEV.

27.

The  similarity in  primary SV2A  mechanism of  LEV and  BRV manifests  itself  in  a  similar activity  profile  in 
animal models of acute seizures and chronic epilepsy, a profile that differs markedly from AEDs with other 
mechanisms. Indeed, both  LEV  and BRV are the only  approved AEDs inactive in  the  2  classical screening 
tests,  maximal electroshock and pentylenetetrazol seizure tests,  at pharmacologically relevant doses, and 
the only two  AEDs to have demonstrated a sustained inhibition  of kindling acquisition, even after cessation 
of treatment. 
A similar activity profile was demonstrated for LEV and BRV in various predictive animal models of chronic 
epilepsy. These have shown  that  both  LEV  and BRV provide broad spectrum seizure protection  in models 
of partial, drug-resistant, and primary generalized epilepsy (Matagne et al, 2008a) and in status epilepticus 
models (Mazarati et  al, 2004). 
Similar to LEV, BRV provides protection against secondarily generalized motor seizures in corneally kindled 
mice with  a  median effective dose  (ED50)  of  1.2mg/kg  intraperitoneal (ip),  against clonic  convulsions  in 
audiogenic seizure-susceptible mice (ED50  2.4mg/kg  ip)  (Matagne  et  al,  2008a),  against  6Hz  seizures in 
mice (ED50  4.4mg/kg ip)  (Detrait et al,  2008),  and against motor  seizure and after discharge duration  in 
fully  amygdala  kindled  rats.  The  latter  finding  also  extends  to  fully  amygdala kindled  mice,  resistant  to  
phenytoin.  In  these  animals,  LEV  has  previously  been  demonstrated  to  possess  relative  more  potent 
anticonvulsant properties than any other AED, a finding reproduced by BRV (ED50 68.3mg/kg ip) (Matagne 
et  al,  2008b).  Finally,  BRV  and  LEV  are  amongst  the  very  few  AEDs  that  suppress  spike-and-wave 
discharges in genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (Matagne et al, 2008a). Furthermore, testing 
in  the  kindling  paradigm  has  shown  that  chronic  treatment  with  both  LEV  and  BRV  inhibits  kindling 
acquisition  and  reveals  a  sustained  effect,  even  after  cessation  of  treatment,  a  feature  that  also 
differentiates both  from the preclinical profile of any other AED (Loscher and Honack, 1993; Matagne et al, 
2008a).  In  all  these  models, the  potency  of  BRV is  higher  than  LEV,  consistent  with  a higher  affinity  for 
SV2A. 
Taken together, comparative studies  of LEV  and BRV in  a variety of animal models of  acute seizures and 
chronic, acquired or genetic epilepsy demonstrate that  these two  AEDs possess a similar activity profile in 
vivo that differs markedly from the profiles of other AEDs. This is supportive for LEV and BRV sharing SV2A 
a similar mechanism and activity profile in epilepsy patients. 
Modelling approach 
The  modeling  approach  aimed  to  determine  weight-based  dosing  regimens  for  BRV  in  patients  aged  ≥1 
month to <2 years and ≥2 years to <4 years. For LEV, PK and PD were available for paediatric participants 
aged 1 month  and above and adults that  could be used to derive a PK/PD model for LEV showing  that the

same exposure to  LEV  was  required in  paediatric participants  and  in  adults  to  achieve the  same level of 
seizure reduction. Since LEV and  BRV share a similar mode of action,  ie, by interacting  with  SV2A, it  was 
assumed that  also for BRV an equivalent  relation between exposure and reduction  in seizure count would  
hold for all ages ≥1 month as was found for LEV. For BRV, PK data were available for paediatric participants 
aged  1  month  and  above, but  PD  data  were  lacking;  and  a  PK/PD  model  in  adults  was  available.  This 
knowledge  was  subsequently  used  to  derive  the  paediatric  BRV  doses  that  would  result  in  the  same 
exposure, and therefore same efficacy, as in adults. 
The population  PK/PD model for BRV that  was used to  simulate the effect on seizure count in  these 2 age 
groups was similar to the model used for LEV. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study  N01263  was  a  phase  2a,  open-label,  single-arm,  multicenter,  fixed  3-step  up-titration  study  in 
participants  aged between ≥1  month  and <16  years with  epilepsy evaluating the  PK, safety, and efficacy 
of BRV. All participants  completed a 1-week Baseline Period, followed by a 3-week Evaluation Period with 
weekly fixed 3-step  up-titration  of the  BRV dose. 
In the paediatric age interval, N=100 patients were enrolled, and 27/30 in the group ≥1 month to <2 years, 
47/52  in the  group ≥2  to <12  years, and 16/18  in  the group ≥12  to <16  years completed the  study. The 
MAH  has  not  presented  any  separate  data  on  patients  ≥2  to  <4  years,  as  would  be  relevant  for  this 
application for extension of Indication.  
The baseline epileptic characteristics, where each subject could be counted in more than  1 category, were 
as  follows:  ≥1  month  to  <2  years age  group:  60%  had  POS,  46.7%  had  generalized seizures  and  10% 
unclassifiable. In the ≥2  years to <12  years age group: 68.6%  had POS, 47.1% had  generalized seizures 
and 3.9% unclassifiable. With regards to baseline classification of epileptic syndromes, in the ≥1 month to 
<2  years age  group 5  patients  (16.7%)  had  infantile  spasms  and 1  patient  (3.3%)  had  Lennox-Gastaut 
syndrome. In the  ≥2  years to  <12  years age group  2  (3.9%)  had  childhood absence epilepsy,  1  (2.0%) 
had infantile  spasms and  6  patients  (11.2%)  had  Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 1 (2.0%)  had epilepsy  with 
myoclonic-astatic seizures and 2 (3.9%)  had epilepsy with  myoclonic absences.  
Currently,  BRV  only  has  the  indication  POS  and  thus,  for  this  substance  it  has  not  been  demonstrated 
whether primary generalized epilepsy syndromes including syndromes with myoclonic seizures may respond 
differently to  the  treatment.  Accurately classifying seizures in children  can be  challenging because of  the 
different  manifestations  of  childhood  epilepsy:  the  younger  the  child,  the  greater  the  likelihood  of 
misinterpretation.  Thus,  in  children, it  may be  hard  to  differentiate  POS from  epileptic  syndromes which 
include seizures with  partial onset. However, LEV has the same main MoA via SV2A as BRV and LEV has in 
addition to the  POS indication also the indications of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures and juvenile 
myoclonic epilepsy.  Given the  similarities  of  these  two  substances,  this  may  indicate  that  BRV may also 
display broader treatment  effects in various forms of epilepsy. Thus,  the  potential risk of a less beneficial 
treatment  effect  due  to  misclassification of  the  epilepsy type  in  younger children  may  be foreseen to  be 
low.  
According to the eligibility criteria, subjects should be on treatment with ≥1 to ≤3 concomitant AEDs during 
the study. 
Top  3  most  frequent  concomitant  AEDs during  the  study  in  the  ≥1  month  to  <2  years age group:  VPA 
56.7%,  PB  33%,  topiramate  (TPM)  23.3%.  In  the  ≥2  years to  <12  years age  group:  LEV  58.8%,  VPA 
54.9%,  TPM 43.1%. 
EEG or video/EEG is recommended in the EMA Epilepsy guidelines as complementary assessment of efficacy 
of AEDs in children aged 1 month  to  less than  4 years. (EMA draft epilepsy guideline (2018):  “In  younger 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99325/2022 
Page 54/86 
 
 
 
 
children,  from  1  month  to  less  than  4  years, EEG  or  video/EEG  may complete  and  evidence the  clinical 
manifestation of seizures, in particular subtle clinical seizures can be confirmed when correlated with EEG.” 
EMA  Adopted  epilepsy guideline  (2010):  “In  the  very young children  (i.e.  1  month  –  less than  4  years), 
once  efficacy has  been shown  in  the  older paediatric  population,  short  term  assessment of  response by 
using video EEG monitoring may be sufficient.” 
In the  subgroup of  children aged ≥1  month  to  ≤2 years, of the  26  patients  with  available 24-h  EEG  data 
both  at  baseline  and  at  the  end  of  the  study,  the  majority  had  an  unchanged  seizure status  during  the  
study:  10/26  were neither  seizure-free at baseline nor evaluation visit whereas 9/26  were seizure-free at 
both visits,  i.e. 19/26 (73%  had a unchanged seizure status on EEG. Of the remaining 7 patients,  5 of the  
15  patients  that  were not seizure free at baseline EEG had  become seizure-free on EEG  at the  end of the  
study,  and 2 went  from seizure-free to not  seizure-free. The proportions were similar in the  subgroups of 
patients  with  either POS or  primary generalized seizures. These data  cannot  support  an effect  of BRV as 
adjunctive therapy in children aged ≥1  month to ≤2  years with epilepsy. 
Based on diary data of seizure frequency over the 3-weeks treatment period, 4/27 (14.8%) in the ≥1 month 
to ≤2 years overall subgroup were 50% responders. In the POS subgroup in this age interval, the responder 
rate was 3/12 (25%). This was lower than in the older age intervals, where 9/41 (22%) in the overall group 
≥2 to  <12  years, 7/19  (36.8%)  in  the  POS subgroup of this  age interval were 50%  responders, and 4/12 
(33.3%)  in  the  overall group  ≥12  to  <16  years, 1/4  in  the  POS subgroup of  this  age  interval were  50% 
responders. The low number of treated patients indicates that the data should be interpreted with caution. 
For  comparison, for  LEV,  the  50%  responder rate  for paediatric  patients  aged 1  month  to  <4  years was 
43.6%  vs 19.6%  for placebo. 
For  comparison, the  extension of  approval of LEV  to  the  ≥1  month  to  <4  year paediatric age group  was 
based on a 5-day placebo-controlled study with a modified intention-to-treat population of N=109 (58 LEV, 
51  placebo) using  48-h  video-EEG for efficacy evaluation, for which  the  50%  responder rate for LEV  was 
43.6%  vs 19.6%  for placebo. 
The study was not  primarily designed to capture robust efficacy data  in the age intervals ≥1 month  to <2 
years and ≥2 to <4 years: The study was open-label, single-armed and the evaluation of efficacy was done 
during a fixed weekly dose titration  schedule or after only 1 week at the highest fixed dose level. The dose 
levels were 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg/day for week 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This is obviously not in line with 
the recommended dosing strategy for treatment of epilepsy where an individualized dose should be titrated 
based on a combination of benefit and tolerability. The submitted updated SmPC for the extension proposes 
a therapeutic dose range of 1-5 mg/kg /day (recommended maintenance dose 2.5 mg/kg/day) for children 
weighing  10-20  kg and  1.5  to  6  mg/kg/day (recommended maintenance dose  3  mg/kg/day) for children 
weighing  3-10  kg,  indicating  that  the  dose would  not  be  effective during  week 1  at  least. The  number of 
patients was also low in each subgroup, especially if only paediatric patients with  POS should be taken into 
account.  
It  is  considered  that  the  open  study  design,  the  evaluation  of  seizure  frequency  through  diary  data 
throughout  the  3-week titration  period,  the  low  number of treated  children  and low  number of  evaluable 
children in  each age interval  prohibit any robust  evaluation of efficacy in  the age groups ≥1  month  to <2 
years and ≥2 to <4 years, which  is the  remit of this  application. 
Study  N01266  is  an  ongoing  Phase  3,  open-label,  single-arm,  multicenter,  LTFU  study  to  evaluate the  
safety  and  efficacy of  BRV  in  study  participants  with  epilepsy.  In  addition  to  patients  having  completed 
study  N01263  being  offered  to  roll  over  to  study  N01266,  additional  paediatric  patients  were  enrolled 
directly into  the study. The total  number of participants was 249, of which only 28 were aged ≥1 month to 
<2  years and 14  were aged ≥2  years to <4  years. Thus, the  vast majority was 4 years and older. At the  
time of data cut-off, 14/28  (50%)  in the youngest age group and 10/14 (71.4%)  from the ≥2 years to <4 
years  age  group  had  discontinued  from  the  study,  In  the  total  study  group,  138/249  (55.4%)  had 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

Page 55/86 
 
 
 
 
discontinued.  For all age groups, adverse events (AEs) and lack of efficacy were equally frequent reasons 
for discontinuation. 
Since this was an open-label long-term safety and efficacy study where the patients were treated with  BRV 
both at  baseline and throughout the  study, only maintenance of efficacy would be considered an adequate 
efficacy measure. The MAH puts forward that  the majority of participants had either a stable or a reduction 
in  seizure frequency over the  study  duration,  which  would  show  some  support  for an  efficacy of  BRV as 
adjunctive therapy. However, the overall discontinuation rate is 55.4% so far in this still ongoing study, of 
which 26%  of the discontinuations  were due to  lack of efficacy. Thus, the interpretation  of efficacy data in 
the study participants remaining on study is hampered by many factors. 
The 50% responder rate compared to baseline in patients aged ≥2 years to <17 years was 81/167 (50.9%) 
in the overall group and 61/134  (45.5%) in the POS subgroup of the evaluable patients. The validity of this 
endpoint may however be questioned, given the design of the  study (see discussion above). 
For patients  ≥1 month  to <2  years, based on 24-h EEG  data obtained from a total of N=14  patients,  only 
8 patients contributed with ‘evaluable data’. Of these, 4/4 with  POS and 2/4 with PGS were 50% responders 
compared to  baseline. The  validity of  this  endpoint  may  however be  questioned,  given the  design  of  the 
study (see discussion above). 
The  open-label, single  arm  design  of this  LTFU  study  makes the  interpretation  of any  efficacy data  very 
difficult.  It is even difficult  to claim that  the study participants did maintain efficacy on study, since around 
half of the participants has discontinued from the study at data cut-off, many of them due to lack of efficacy. 
In addition, the majority of patients  were aged 4 years and above and only 28 were aged ≥1 month to <2 
years and 14  were aged ≥2  years to  <4 years. No conclusions may be drawn  for efficacy from this  study 
for these age groups. 
Study  EP0065 was a phase 2  PK, safety and tolerability  study in  patients  aged ≥1 month  to  <16  years. 
The study provided PK and safety data related to the IV administration route.  
The  MAH  has  been asked to  support  the  extension  of  indication  from  adults  to  children  ≥1  month to  <2 
years of age, which  is  partly based on extrapolation of efficacy from data  in adults  and children  receiving 
adjunctive LEV,  on a  non-clinical comparison of similarities  and dissimilarities  between BRV and  LEV  with 
regards to  mode of action, animal models of epilepsy and free plasma exposure at the maximal approved 
dose. 
The MAH  presents data in support of the primary MoA for both BRV and LEV being via binding to SV2A with 
a reported 10- to  30-fold  higher affinity of BRV for binding to  SV2A than  LEV.  This corresponds quite  well 
with  the 15-20-fold  higher free plasma concentration for BRV than LEV at the maximal approved dose.  
Both  BRV and  LEV have a similar activity  profile in  animal models of acute seizures and chronic  epilepsy, 
which is quite different from the profile for AEDs with  other mechanisms of action. In all the animal models 
where both have an effect, the potency of BRV is higher than LEV, consistent with a higher affinity for SV2A.  
This comparison gives some support to the notion that  BRV and LEV are similar in MoA, and above all that 
a similar difference in potency has been observed through various in vitro and in vivo tests, supporting the 
view that  the dosing of BRV for children ≥1 month  to <2 years of age may use the PK/PD model developed 
for  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  with  LEV.  However,  the  external validation  of  the  BRV PK/PD model 
indicated  a  different  PK/PD  relationship  between  adults  and  children  <4  years,  and  therefore  PK/PD 
modelling cannot be used to support this  extension (see 2.4.3.   PK/PD modelling and 2.4.4. Discussion on 
clinical pharmacology). 
The  MAH  was  asked to  justify  the  similarity  of  the  pathophysiology of  POS  epilepsy in  children  aged  ≥1 
month  to  <2 years compared to  older children  and adults.  The MAH  refers to  data showing  that  although 
clinical  manifestations  of POS  may be  different between  older children  and  children  aged below  2  years, 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

focal/partial  seizures  are  quite  similar  in  their  EEG  appearance  in  the  youngest  children  versus adults, 
indicating  a similar neurophysiological correlate.  
2.5.3.  While a population PK bridge may support extrapolation down to 2 years 
of  age,  the  PK/PD  model  cannot  be  used  to  support  the  extrapolation  of 
efficacy to children below 4 years. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Data from the clinical studies N01263  and N01266  do not establish efficacy for age groups ≥1 month to <2 
years and ≥2  to  <4  years due  to  the  low  number  of evaluable children  in  each age interval  and aspects 
relative to study design [open-label, single arm design of this  LTFU]. 
Study EP0065 provided some support that to the notion that  BRV and LEV are similar in MoA and therefore 
that  the  PK/PD  model  developed for  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  with  LEV  could  be  used  to  inform 
dosing of BRV for children below 4 years. However, the external validation of the BRV PK/PD model indicated 
a different PK/PD relationship between adults and children <4 years, and therefore PK/PD modelling cannot 
be used to  support this extension of indication.   
The absence of robust clinical efficacy results [N01263  and N01266]  and support from the PK/PD modelling 
does not allow to establish the efficacy of BRV in children aged ≥1 month  to <2 years, an age range where 
the pathophysiology of epilepsy is not  considered to  be sufficiently similar to that  of adults to  allow for an 
extrapolation based on only a PK bridge. 
However, for children aged ≥2  years to <4 years, it  may be considered adequate to  base the  approval on 
the similarity of disease between adults and children aged ≥2 years to <4 years in combination with safety 
data and a PK bridge (similar exposure). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The Summary of Clinical Safety focuses on the  following interpretations: 
First, for Pool Paediatric Studies, data from study participants with POS who are <4 years of age (ie, in the 
≥1 month to  <2 years and ≥2 to <4 years POS groups) are compared with data from the ≥4  to <16 years 
POS  group  to  determine  if  there  are  any  differences  between  age  groups.  Interpretations  are  provided 
collectively for participants ≥1  month to <2 years of age and ≥2 to <4 years of age (ie, for participants ≥1 
month to  <4 years) for comparison with  participants ≥4  to <16 years of age.  
Second, for Pool Paediatric Studies, data from all participants with POS (Total POS) are compared with data 
from  All  Paediatric  Study  Participants  to  determine  if  there  are  any  differences  between  paediatric 
participants with  POS and paediatric participants with  epilepsy (both POS and non-POS).  
The tertiary focus is to compare modal and maximum doses for the Total POS group. The Total POS group 
was chosen  for this  comparison as there are too  few  study participants  in  each POS summary age group 
for meaningful interpretations. Where possible, within  each group in Pool Paediatric Studies (≥1  month to  
<2 years, ≥2 to  <4 years, ≥4 to <16 years, Total POS, and All Paediatric Study Participants groups), data 
were compared between  gender, race, region,  and AED  inducer status  to  identify  if  there were any  data 
differences associated with  these factors.  
Finally,  data from participants  in the  Total POS group in  Pool Paediatric Studies were compared with  data 
from  Pool  S4  and  Pool  Monotherapy  to  determine  if  there  were  any  differences  between  paediatric 
participants with  POS compared with  adult participants.

b  All Paediatric Study Participants included paediatric participants with POS and other seizure types. 
Data sources: ISS Table 5.3.1A, ISS Table 5.3.1B 
The TEAE  incidence was similar  for participants  with  POS aged <4  years and  ≥4  to  <16  years except for 
the  TEAEs described here. Participants  <4  years of age  had a  higher incidence  of pyrexia and decreased 
appetite. Participants aged <4 years also had a higher incidence of some TEAEs in the System Organ Class 
(SOCs) of  Infections and  infestations  and Gastrointestinal  disorders, which  were as normally observed in 
this  age group;  however, similar proportions of participants aged <4 years and  ≥4 to  <16 years reported 
the particular PTs within  these SOCs. In addition, hypothyroidism was reported by 6 participants who were 
≥4 to  <16 years of age but no participants who  were <4 years of age. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
In  Pool Paediatric Studies,  a  total  of  6  study  participants  had  TEAEs with  fatal  outcome  during  the  BRV 
clinical  development program as of  the  data lock point  of 14  Jan  2020;  2  of these  participants  had POS. 
Three participant deaths were reviewed with the initial  MAA and 1 participant death was reviewed with the 
initial  paediatric  extension  application  (paediatric  indication  ≥4  to  <16  years  in  POS).  An  additional  2 
participants  have experienced TEAEs with  fatal  outcomes since the  initial  paediatric  extension application 
was reviewed: 
• 
A  study  participant  with  a  history  of  dysphagia  and  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  while 
concomitantly  taking  clobazam,  LTG,  VPA  and  vigabatrin  experienced fatal  pneumonia  aspiration  after 
approximately 5.9  months of exposure to BRV. An autopsy was not performed. The Investigator assessed 
the event as not  related to study drug. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99325/2022 
Page 70/86 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
A study participant with a history of asthma, hypoxia, respiratory failure, while concomitantly taking 
lacosamide and vigabatrin  experienced fatal  apnoea after approximately 6  years of exposure to  BRV. An 
autopsy was not  performed. The Investigator assessed the event as not related to  study drug. 
In  Pool S4,  a  total  of  40  participants  had  TEAEs  with  fatal  outcome during  the  BRV clinical  development 
program; 35 participant deaths were reviewed with the initial MAA, and 5 participant deaths were reviewed 
with  the  initial  paediatric  extension  application.  There  have  been  no  additional  deaths  since  the  initial 
paediatric extension application. 
In Pool Monotherapy, 1  participant  had a TEAE  with  fatal outcome (sudden  unexplained death in  epilepsy 
[SUDEP]) during  the BRV clinical development program as of the clinical  cut-off date of 14  Jan 2020;  this  
participant  death was  reviewed with  the initial  MAA. There were no TEAEs  with  fatal outcome  reported in 
Pool Monotherapy since the initial  MAA was reviewed. 
No  trend has  been identified in  the  causes of  death presented by the  participants  who received BRV. The 
events observed in  the  development program could  be expected in  a program involving  participants  with 
epilepsy. 
SAEs  
In general, the incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs was as expected in this study population. In the ≥1 
month to <2  years age group, seizure (3 participants [20.0%])  and pyrexia (2 participants [13.3%]) were 
the  most  frequently reported SAEs. In  the  ≥2  to  <4  years age  group, 1 participant  (33.3%)  reported an 
SAE of spina bifida. In the ≥4 to <16 years age group, the most frequently reported SAEs were seizure (13 
participants  [7.7%]),  status  epilepticus  (7 participants  [4.2%]),  pneumonia  (5 participants  [3.0%]),  and 
epilepsy (3 participants [1.8%]).  There were no obvious differences in treatment-emergent SAEs observed 
between study participants <4 years of age and ≥4 to  <16 years of age. 
In the Total  POS group, 52  participants (27.5%)  reported treatment-emergent SAEs. The most frequently 
reported SAEs were seizure (17 participants [9.0%]), status epilepticus (8  participants [4.2%]), pneumonia 
(5  participants  [2.6%]),  epilepsy (4 participants  [2.1%]),  and  pyrexia (3 participants  [1.6%]).  No  other 
SAEs were reported in  more than  2 participants.  There were no differences in  the incidence of treatment-
emergent  SAEs  across  modal  doses.  The  treatment-emergent  SAE  profile  was  similar  for  All  Paediatric 
Study Participants compared with the  Total POS group. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs in the adult analysis pools (Pool Monotherapy [20.0%]  and Pool 
S4 [22.6%])  was similar to the  incidence in the Total POS group in  Pool Paediatric Studies. 
TEAEs of special interest 
Growth, neurocognitive development,  sexual  maturation 
In  the  ≥1  month  to  <2  years POS  group  in  Pool  Paediatric Studies,  TEAEs  of  interest  for  the  paediatric 
population were reported most frequently in  the neurodevelopment category (3 participants [20.0%]) and 
in the endocrine function or sexual maturation category (2 participants [13.3%]).  All other TEAEs of interest 
categories  were  reported  by  no  more  than  1  study  participant.  In  the  endocrine  function  or  sexual 
maturation  category,  1  study  participant  each  (6.7%)  had  a  treatment-emergent  SAE of  cryptorchidism 
and hypoglycaemia. 
In  the ≥2  to  <4  years POS group  in  Pool  Paediatric Studies,  there  were  no  TEAEs  potentially  related  to 
neurodevelopment or cognitive impairment; 1 participant (33.3%) reported a TEAE of hair growth abnormal 
in  the  endocrine function  or  sexual maturation  category. This  event was not  serious and did  not  result  in 
the participant’s discontinuation  of study drug. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99325/2022 
Page 71/86 
 
 
 
 
In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies, TEAEs of interest for the paediatric population 
were reported most frequently in the following  categories: cognitive impairment (15 participants  [8.9%]), 
neurodevelopment  (13  participants  [7.7%]),  endocrine  function  or  sexual  maturation  (12  participants 
[7.1%]),  and  anxiety  (11  participants  [6.5%]).  All  other  TEAEs  of  interest  categories  were reported  by 
<5%  of  study participants.  No  TEAEs  were reported in the  category of growth.  In the  neurodevelopment 
category, 2 participants (1.2%) discontinued study drug due to TEAEs of psychomotor hyperactivity and in 
the depression category 1 participant each (0.6% each) discontinued study drug due to TEAEs of depression 
and depressed mood. In the  depression category, 1 participant  (0.6%)  had a treatment-emergent SAE of 
depression. No other TEAEs were treatment-emergent SAEs or resulted in  discontinuation of study drug. 
Study participants <4 years of age had greater incidence of TEAEs of interest in the categories of endocrine 
function  or sexual maturation and  neurodevelopment compared with  participants  ≥4 to  <16  years of age. 
There were no other differences between age groups observed. 
In  the  Total  POS  group  in  Pool  Paediatric  Studies,  TEAEs  of  interest  for  the  paediatric  population  were 
reported  most  frequently  in  the  following  categories:  neurodevelopment  and  cognitive  impairment  (16 
participants  each [8.5%]),  endocrine function  or sexual maturation (15  participants  [7.9%]),  and anxiety 
(12 participants [6.3%]). All other TEAEs of interest categories were reported by <5% of study participants. 
The  profile  of  TEAEs  potentially  associated  with  growth,  endocrine  function/sexual  maturation, 
neurodevelopment, cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression were similar in All Study Participants in 
Pool Paediatric Studies and the  Total POS group. 
Hepatotoxicity 
In  the  ≥1  month  to  <2  years POS  group  in  Pool  Paediatric Studies,  a  TEAE  potentially  associated  with 
hepatotoxicity of hepatic enzyme increased was reported in 1 study participant (6.7%).  The TEAE of hepatic 
enzyme increased was not  serious, and  considered not  related to  BRV by the investigator,  but resulted  in 
permanent discontinuation of the participant’s study drug. 
No participant  ≥2 to <4 years of age reported a TEAE potentially associated with  hepatotoxicity. 
Suicidality 
As expected, no AEs related to suicidality were reported in  the ≥1 month  to <4 years age group. 
TEAEs that met criteria to add as  ADR in paediatric participants 
Based on evaluation  of TEAEs  in  participants  ≥1  month  to  <16  years with  POS, the  following  TEAEs  met 
the criteria to add as adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the  paediatric population. 
Decreased  appetite 
Within  the ≥1 month to <16 year POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies, the incidence of decreased appetite 
was higher (22  of 186  participants  [11.8%]),  compared with  the  adult  population (4.3%  in  Pool S4). One 
event of decreased appetite was serious and 2 events led to permanent discontinuation of study drug. The 
TEAE of decreased appetite was considered related to  BRV by the  Investigator in  8 of the  16 participants. 
In  14  participants,  the  TEAE  of decreased appetite  started  during  Months  1  to  3  of  BRV treatment.  In  1 
participant, the  event resolved after BRV dose reduction. 
Given  the  characterization  of  decreased appetite  in  the paediatric  population,  including  the  incidence  of 
events considered related by the Investigator (about 50% of participants), the time course, and the positive 
dechallenge  result,  it  is  thought  to  be  at  least  possibly  causally  related  to  the  administration  of  BRV. 
Therefore, this term is recommended for addition to the  product information for paediatric participants. 
Psychomotor hyperactivity 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99325/2022 
Page 72/86 
 
 
 
 
Psychomotor  hyperactivity  was  reported  in  9  study  participants,  representing  a  higher  incidence  in 
participants  ≥1 month  to <16  years with  POS in  Pool Paediatric Studies (4.8%)  compared with  adult Pool 
S4 (0.3%).  No  events were serious and  all were mild or moderate in  intensity.  All events but  one started 
within  the 3 first weeks of treatment. Two events led to the permanent discontinuation  of BRV. The events 
in  5  participants  were considered related  to  BRV by the  Investigator  and, in  2  cases, the  event resolved 
after BRV withdrawal. Given the characterization of psychomotor hyperactivity in the paediatric population, 
including  the  incidence of events considered related by the Investigator (>50%  of participants),  the  time 
course,  and  the  positive  dechallenge  result,  it  is  thought  to  be  at  least  possibly  causally  related  to  the 
administration of BRV. Psychomotor activity, which is already listed as an ADR in the  US PI, also applies to 
the paediatric population ≥1 month  to <4 years of age. 
As  expected  when  comparing  paediatric  and  adult  populations,  behavioral  disorders,  infection-related 
disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and respiratory disorders were reported more frequently in paediatric 
study participants with POS compared with the established BRV safety profile in adults. The incidences were 
highest  during  the  first  3  months  of  treatment.  The  majority  of  the  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in 
intensity,  were nonserious,  and  did  not  lead to  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  As these  are  uncontrolled 
data, definitive causality cannot be concluded; however, as with adults, prescribers should be made aware 
of these symptoms. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, there  were  no  clinically  meaningful  mean changes  from  Baseline over time  in  haematology and 
clinical chemistry values and no clinically meaningful observations in qualitative urinalysis parameters in All 
Paediatric Study Participants and Total POS in Pool Paediatric Studies. 
Vital  signs 
Overall, there were no clinically meaningful mean changes from Baseline over time to the Last Value in BRV 
Overall for any vital sign parameter in All Paediatric Study Participants in Pool Paediatric Studies.

During the reporting interval from 14 Jan 2016  to  14 Jan 2020,  a total  of 614 safety case reports of post-
marketing  BRV use  in  patients  from 1  month  to  <16  years of  age were  identified  worldwide  in  the  UCB 
Global Safety database. Of these 614  case reports, 22 cases were reported in patients from 1 month to <2 
years, 54 cases were reported with  age group 2  years to <4 years, and 538 cases were reported with age 
group 4 years to <16 years. The majority of cases pertaining to off-label use did not present a clinical event 
associated with  the current age-related off-label usage. Due to  the nature of spontaneous reporting, there 
are  some  recognized  limitations  to  the  search  strategies  used,  mainly  due  to  the  lack  of  reported 
information. 
A comprehensive review of  the fatal  cases (including  potential  SUDEP), AEs of interest  relevant to  BRV in 
paediatric population (suicidality-related events, behaviour disorders, blood dyscrasias, potential worsening 
of  seizure,  potential  abuse,  DRESS  (Drug  Rash  with  Eosinophilia  and  Systemic  Symptoms)  syndrome, 
SCARs  (Severe  cutaneous  adverse  reaction),  hepatotoxicity-related  events,  renal  injury,  psychosis, 
depression, anxiety, fall and  injuries, potential  effects on  growth, cognition,  endocrine, sexual maturation 
and  neurodevelopment,  and  malignancies),  and  other  medically  important  events  (lack  of  efficacy  and 
pregnancy) did not show concerns specific to the use of BRV in patients  from 1 month to  <16 years of age 
compared with  the  known  safety profile  of  BRV  in  adults.  No  particular  pattern  was  identified  in  specific 
syndromes with  epilepsy.

As per the  Company Core Data Sheet that  was approved by the 14  Jan 2020  clinical cut-off (dated 22  Oct 
2019),  from  the  pooled open-label safety and PK studies  in  adjunctive therapy,  149  children with  POS in 
the  age range of 4 to  <16  years have received BRV, of whom 116  have been treated for ≥6  months, 104 
for ≥12 months, 58 for ≥24 months, and 20 for ≥36 months. The safety profile of BRV observed in children 
was consistent with  the safety profile observed in adults.  
No new safety concerns were identified in publications on the  use of BRV in the  paediatric population. 
In conclusion, the post-marketing BRV analysis in patients from 1 month to <16 years of age did not identify 
new safety concerns or paediatric specific risks. 
From 15 Jan  2020 to 14 Jul 2020 
During the  reporting  interval from 15  Jan  2020  to  14  Jul  2020,  a total  of 59  safety case reports of  post-
marketing  BRV use  in  patients  from 1  month  to <16  years of  age were  identified  worldwide  in  the  UCB 
Global Safety database. Of these 59  case reports, 2  cases were reported in  patients  from 1  month  to  <2 
years, 3  cases were  reported with  age  group 2  years to  <4  years, and 54  cases were  reported with  age 
group 4 years to <16 years. The majority of cases pertaining to off-label use did not present a clinical event 
associated with  the current age-related off-label usage. Due to  the nature of spontaneous reporting, there 
are  some  recognized  limitations  to  the  search  strategies  used,  mainly  due  to  the  lack  of  reported 
information. 
A comprehensive review of  the fatal  cases (including  potential  SUDEP), AEs of interest  relevant to  BRV in 
paediatric population (suicidality-related events, behaviour disorders, blood dyscrasias, potential worsening 
of  seizure,  potential  abuse,  DRESS  syndrome,  SCARs,  hepatotoxicity-related  events,  renal  injury, 
psychosis, depression, anxiety, fall and  injuries, potential  effects on growth,  cognition,  endocrine, sexual 
maturation  and  neurodevelopment,  and  malignancies),  and  other  medically  important  events  (lack  of 
efficacy and pregnancy) did not  show safety concerns specific to the  use of BRV in patients  from 1 month 
to <16  years of age. 
In addition,  27  cases that  were relevant to  the use  of BRV as monotherapy and with  the use of  BRV iv  in 
the  paediatric population  from  1  month  to  <16  years  of  age were  evaluated.  Based on  review  of  these 
cases, no specific safety concerns were identified. 
As  per  the  newly  updated  Company  Core Data  Sheet  (dated  07  Sep 2020),  from  the  pooled open-label 
safety  and  pharmacokinetic studies  in  adjunctive  therapy,  186  children  with  POS  in  the  age  range of  1 
month  to <16  years of age have received BRV, of whom 138  have been treated for ≥6  months,  123 for ≥
12  months,  107  for ≥24  months,  and  90  for ≥36  months.  The  safety profile  of BRV observed in  children 
was consistent with  the safety profile observed in adults. 
No new safety concerns were identified in publications regarding the use of BRV in the paediatric population. 
In  conclusion, the  post-marketing  BRV analysis in  patients  1  month  to  <16  years of age  did  not  identify 
new safety concerns or paediatric-specific risks during the  reporting period. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
For safety, it  has been agreed at scientific  advice that  the  safety profile in children aged ≥1  month  to <4 
years should be compared to the safety in the older paediatric age group of ≥4 to <16 years and that the 
safety database in paediatric patients  should include at  least 100  children exposed for at least 12 months.  
In the POS subgroup, 125 paediatric patients were exposed for at least 12 months, of which N=9 belonged 
to  the  1  month  to  <2  years, N=2  to  the  ≥2  to<4  years, and  N=112  to  the  ≥4  to  <16  years age  group, 
respectively.

The MAH  has  provided a  safety update  based on a cut-off  date  14 July  2020  of  long-term  study  N01266. 
From this  interim  report of study  N01266,  N=28  infants  aged 1 month  to <2  years have been exposed to  
BRV with a mean exposure of 39 months and N=14  children aged ≥2 to <4 years were exposed for a mean 
duration of 32  months. In total,  15 infants  aged 1  month to <2  years and 7 children aged ≥2 to <4  years 
were exposed for at least 12 months.  
Considering  the  safety  data  available  for  participants  ≥1  month  to  <  2  years  of  age,  there  are  34 
participants  who were enrolled in the  ≥1  month  to <  2 years age group  from the Pool Paediatric Studies. 
Of  those  34  participants,  20  participants  aged  up  to  the  ≥2  to  <4  years  age  group.  17  out  of  the  20 
participants were exposed to BRV for more than 1 year. The data show that the safety profile of BRV in this 
age group is similar to the safety profile of BRV in the paediatric population of 4 years to < 16 years of age. 
No  safety  signal  was  identified.  The  safety  database  is  still  limited  for  the  youngest  age  groups  but  is 
considered sufficient. 
The children  <4  years generally had a  higher SAE rate  than  the  older children. For  most  primary system 
organ classes, the  AE rates were numerically higher in  the youngest age groups (i.e.  < 4  years), but  this  
should  be interpreted  with  caution due  to  the  low  numbers in  the  youngest  age groups.  Thus,  it  may be 
concluded  that  the  TEAE  incidence was  similar  for  participants  with  POS aged  <4  years and  ≥4  to  <16 
years except for  patients  <4  years of  age  having  a  higher incidence  of  pyrexia and  decreased appetite. 
Participants  aged  <4  years  also  had  a  higher  incidence  of  some  TEAEs  in  the  SOCs  of  Infections  and 
infestations  and Gastrointestinal  disorders, which  were as normally observed in  this  age group.  The  MAH 
concludes that  the safety profile in  children ≥1 month  to <4  years was similar to the  one in the  older age 
groups. No changes have been proposed to the SmPC section 4.8  ADR table. This is agreed. 
The  rate  of  discontinuations  due  to  TEAE  was  13.5%  in  the  overall paediatric  group,  and  13.3%  in  the  
youngest age group of patients < 2 years of age. 
6  deaths  occurred  in  the  overall study  population,  2  of  these  participants  had  POS.  1  patient  died  from 
aspiration pneumonia after 5.9 months  on treatment  with  BRV in conjunction with  4 other AEDs. 
With  regards to TEAEs  of special interest in  the  paediatric population;  including  growth,  cognition,  sexual 
maturation, no TEAEs within  this category led to any new safety concerns for this age group.  
At  the  time  of  approval of  the  ≥4  to  <16  years age  group,  it  was  concluded  that  insufficient  data  was 
available on  paediatric-specific safety  concerns as  the  potential  effects on  growth,  cognition  and  sexual 
maturation.  The  data  provided in  this  application  do  not  shed  sufficient  light  on  these  issues. Thus,  it  is 
considered  adequate  that  the  ‘long-term  effects  on  growth,  endocrine  function  or  sexual  maturation, 
neurodevelopment, cognitive and psychomotor development in paediatric patients’ are included in the RMP 
Safety Concerns as ‘Missing information’. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety was similar in the  age group <4  years of age compared to  older paediatric age groups with  no 
new safety findings in this age group. The total paediatric safety database appears adequate, although it is 
acknowledged that  the number of exposed children in the  two youngest age groups was very restricted in 
number. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle

2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this extension of indication variation, sections 2, 4.1,  4.2,  4.4, 4.8,  5.1,  5.2, 6.3  and 
6.5 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the  PI to  implement editorial updates,  which  were reviewed and accepted by 
the CHMP. 
In  addition,  the  list  of  local  representatives in  the  PL  has  been revised to  amend contact  details  for the  
representative of United  Kingdom (Northern Ireland). 
Please refer to Attachment 1  which includes all proposed changes to the Product Information. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The MAH has submitted a full user test for the oral solution and two bridging reports, one for the film coated 
tablets and one for the solution  for injection. 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet show that the package 
leaflet  meets  the  criteria  for  readability  as  set  out  in  the  Guideline  on  the  readability  of  the  label  and 
package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. The bridging reports have also been found acceptable.

2.9.  Additional Expert Consultation 
During the assessment procedure, the  CHMP convened an ad hoc expert group (AHEG) in  order to discuss 
a number of questions including the extrapolation of efficacy data in POS from the adults to the younger (1 
month-2  year) paediatric  population,  the  extrapolation of  efficacy in  isolated POS to  POS  with  coexisting 
seizure  types  and  the  relevance  of  LEV  data  for  conclusion  on  brivaracetam  efficacy  in  the  younger 
paediatric population.   
The details of the  questions and the  summary of the  expert group discussion is detailed hereafter: 
GENERAL 
1.  Is  it  possible  to  extrapolate  efficacy  data  in  partial  onset  seizures  (POS)  from  adults  to 
children aged  ≥1  month to  <2  years  based  on  similar drug  exposure  only, considering the 
immaturity  of  the  developing  brain,  potentially  different  pathophysiology,  and  different 
clinical presentation (POS  together with other seizure types) in this age  group? 
Whether  efficacy  can  be  established  based  solely  on  extrapolation  (without  data  from  trial)  was  not 
considered a straightforward question  and the  opinion of the  experts was clearly split.  
•  Some  experts  agreed  that  extrapolation  is  possible  for  this  age  group  based  on  the  arguments 
presented  by  the  Applicant.  Some  experts  acknowledged  that  presentation  of  the  seizure  is  not  a 
relevant aspect related to efficacy. Additionally, it  was noted  that both  drugs are anti-seizures and not 
anti-epileptogenic drugs and,  in this  regard, pathophysiology of seizures is considered to be similar in 
children from 1 month  to 2 years and in children from 2 to 4 years. An expert noted that  one exception 
could  be West  syndrome. Another  expert commented that  waiting  for  a perfect  study  may delay the 
access for  the drug  and that  extrapolation could be a  pragmatic approach provided we  are reassured 
on the safety profile.  
•  Other experts agreed that  extrapolation is possible but  based on scientific theoretical grounds that  are 
considered of a rather low scientific level by these experts. Therefore, they must be considered only as 
supportive  arguments in  addition  to  data  from trials,  which  are  definitely needed.  One  expert noted 
that, paradoxically, extrapolation could be easier for situations without  studies (e.g. Brivaracetam) than 
for situations for which we have studies showing negative results (Lacosamide). Another expert did not 
believe  that  extrapolation  was  possible  because  even  if  the  physiopathological  manifestations  are 
considered to  be similar, impact on  the brain may be different, due to  a different brain developmental 
status.  For  this  expert, this  argument  is  also applicable for refusing extrapolation  from 2-4  years, an 
argument  shared to  some  extend also  by another  member. A  couple of  experts noted  that  posology 
(exposure drug) could be a relevant aspect because PK profile could be different in small children which 
may impact safety (e.g. metabolism may be slower exposing children to higher doses). It was clarified 
by  the  Rapporteurs to  the  experts  that  this  aspect  has  been considered  in  the  assessment and  that 
extrapolation is considered under comparable exposure levels.    
The two  patients´ representatives were convinced that pathophysiology could be similar but  still they have 
concerns specially regarding to the impact on neurodevelopmental status, and thus still consider that well-
designed clinical trials are needed.  One of the patient’s representatives was also concerned about the lack 
of  effect  in  contrast  with  potential  risk  of  adverse events,  especially  on  children  with  severe  epileptic 
syndromes.   
2.  Can efficacy in isolated POS  be extrapolated  to efficacy in POS with coexisting seizure types, 
which is an epileptic syndrome more often present in the younger age  group?  
Similarly, experts were split  as  there were some experts who  would  not  agree on  extrapolation approach 
as  a  sole  strategy  to  get  confirmatory  evidence on  efficacy.  Taken this  into  consideration,  experts also 
express the following views:  
While  there is a risk of aggregation of  other seizures with  certain drugs, overall experts do not  think  that 
the  existence  of  other  seizure  does  modifies  the  response  of  brivaracetam  or  lacosamide  on  seizures. 
However, it  was noted that  when there  are global and focal seizures in  children aged 1 month  to 2  years, 
it  is possible that  these  patients,  most likely without  a diagnosis, suffer from an epileptic  encephalopathy 
and likely a refractory epilepsy. As per regards of refractory epilepsy, it was noted that except for the auto-
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99325/2022 
Page 78/86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
limitated seizures, young children may become refractory quite soon and several changes in the medication 
is needed. The prevalence of refractory epilepsy is about the same in both groups (up to 30%  as reported 
by one of the patients representative). Therefore, it was agreed that the need for new drugs is the same in 
the two  age groups. 
A  couple  of  experts noted  that  currently  prescription  is  not  based  on  precision  medicine (specific  to  the  
syndrome) and  therefore, the  risk of  prescribing an  ineffective  drug  already sin  the  clinical  practice  and 
having another drug could be helpful for the  management of seizures in these patients.   
BRIVIACT 
3.  For levetiracetam,  data  from a  placebo-controlled trial  in pediatric subjects  with refractory 
POS,  aged  1  month  to  <  4  years,  supported  the  granting  of  a  corresponding treatment 
indication. Taking  into consideration that  the  MOA  of levetiracetam  and  brivaracetam  may 
not be  completely  identical, does  the  SAG consider these  data  relevant  for any  conclusions 
on brivaracetam  efficacy in children aged ≥1 month to <2 years,  given  the pharmacological 
dissimilarity between  brivaracetam  and levetiracetam? 
Overall and based on the discussion already provided for Q1 and Q2, it may be possible to use levetiracetam 
data  to  extrapolate  on  brivaracetam, as proof  of  efficacy exists for  a  similar  drug.  However, there  were 
some specific concerns:  
•  One  expert thought  efficacy could  be  extrapolated because the  MOA  is  essentially the  same,  but 
the  expert expressed concerns regarding safety, in  particular relevant to  the  impact  on  cognition 
by brivaracetam. 
•  Another  expert  noted  that  this  is  not  a  straightforward  question  because  clinical  data  is  more 
relevant  that  MOA  and  the  clinical  data  of  brivaracetam was  insufficient  to  provide  evidence on 
efficacy. This expert believes that  extrapolation should be better  based on data  on the same drug 
in a different age group (brivaracetam) but not on a similar one (levetiracetam). 
• 
Finally, another expert noted that  study populations were different.  
The  two  patients’  representatives expressed  also  concerns  regarding  this  strategy,  based  on  personal 
experience with both drugs. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Partial-onset  epilepsies,  associated  with  a  local  cerebral  lesion,  are  the  most  frequent,  representing 
approximately  60%  of  cases.  Generalized  epilepsies  represent  approximately  30%  of  cases.  In  the 
remaining 10%  of  seizures, the classification  is uncertain  (Noe,  2011;  Hauser et  al,  1993).  Based on  the 
ILAE, revised seizure classification terminology (Fisher et al, 2017), the term “focal seizures” should replace 
“partial seizures” when describing seizure onset. These terms are synonymous and describe seizures that 
originate at some point  within  networks limited  to 1 hemisphere of the brain.  
Among paediatric populations,  there are significant  differences in  the manifestations,  etiology, prognosis, 
therapeutic response, and impact  of epileptic seizures. The etiology of partial epilepsies may be idiopathic 
(presumably related to genetic factors), symptomatic (identifiable previous brain injury or encephalopathy), 
or cryptogenic (no identifiable  brain lesion or abnormality).  Partial-onset seizures have been classified on 
the  basis  of  whether  or not  awareness is  impaired  during  the  attack  and  whether  or  not  progression to  
generalized convulsions occurs: 
• Simple partial seizures (when  awareness is not  impaired). 
• Complex partial seizures (when awareness is impaired). 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99325/2022 
Page 79/86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Partial seizures evolving to secondarily generalized (tonic-clonic or tonic or clonic) seizures. 
The clinical  presentation of POS may be subjective, objective, or both;  convulsive or nonconvulsive; brief 
or prolonged; inconspicuous or dramatic and bizarre. The subjective and/or objective symptoms observed 
in  POS depend on  the functional  organization  at  the site  of  ictal origin  and/or sites  of propagation.  Thus, 
symptoms  may  be  motor,  sensory,  mental,  emotional,  cognitive,  or  linguistic  (alone  or  in  various 
combinations). 
EEG or video/EEG is recommended in the EMA Epilepsy guidelines as complementary assessment of efficacy 
of AEDs in children aged 1 month  to  less than  4 years. (EMA draft epilepsy guideline (2018):  “In  younger 
children,  from  1  month  to  less  than  4  years, EEG  or  video/EEG  may complete  and  evidence the  clinical 
manifestation of seizures, in particular subtle clinical seizures can be confirmed when correlated with EEG.” 
EMA  Adopted  epilepsy guideline  (2010):  “In  the  very young children  (i.e.  1  month  –  less than  4  years), 
once  efficacy has  been shown  in  the  older paediatric  population,  short  term  assessment of  response by 
using video EEG monitoring may be sufficient.” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Most  patients  with  epilepsy  require  appropriate pharmacological  therapy  (Glauser et  al,  2006;  Perucca, 
1996;  Abou-Khalil, 2019).  The newer  AEDs differ from older  agents in  several important  ways,  including 
MoA, spectrum of activity, and PK (Abou-Khalil, 2019). 
Pharmacological treatment  of  epilepsy  usually  starts  with  an  AED  on  monotherapy.  If  seizures  are  not 
adequately controlled or there are intolerable adverse drug effects with  the  initial  monotherapy, a second 
or third  different AED on monotherapy can be used. Alternatively, adjunctive therapy can  be explored. In 
adjunctive therapy, it is recommended to use drugs with different mechanisms of action. Despite availability 
of many approved AEDs, more than 30% of patients have inadequate seizure control on currently available 
AEDs or experience significant adverse drug effects (Beghi et al, 2015). Therefore, a need remains for AEDs 
with  improved efficacy and tolerability (Sander, 1998; Institute  of Medicine, 2012). 
LEV  is the  first-in-class AED with  the  main MoA  through binding  to  the  SV2A. BRV shares the  same main 
MoA via binding  to SV2A and is relatively similar molecularly. LEV  is approved for adjunctive treatment of 
POS  from  1  months  to  4  years  of  age.  For  LEV,  a  placebo-controlled  study  of  5  days  duration  in  109 
evaluable paediatric patients  aged  from 1  month  to  ≤4  years with  a primary endpoint  using  48  h  video-
EEG.

In 2018, an extrapolation of efficacy based on PK/PD data was approved for children ≥4 years to <16 years. 
The  current extension  of  indication  is  based on  the  possibility  to  further  extrapolate efficacy from  adults 
and  adolescents  aged  from  16  years  down  to  infants  aged  ≥  1  month  to  <4  years.  To  support  this 
extrapolation exercise,  data  from  the  main  study  N01263  and  its  long-term  follow-up  study  N01266  has 
been provided.  
Population PK and PK/PD  modelling, based on seizure count  data for BRV and LEV,  was performed to 
support  the  extrapolation  of  efficacy between  adults  and  the  paediatrics (≥1  month  to  <  4  years). The 
PK/PD  modelling  indicated  a  similar  exposure-response  relationship  in  adults  and  children  for  LEV. 
Therefore,  a  similar  relationship  was  assumed  for  BRV.  In  the  external  validation  of  the  combined 
adult/paediatric  BRV PK/PD  model,  the  model  did  not  seem  to  describe the  effect  on  seizure  counts  in

patients  ≥1  month  to  <4  years  in  study  N01263  and  N01266.  Due  to  the  limitations  in  the  external 
validation, the PK/PD model cannot  be used to  support this  extension. It  is noted that  the observed effect 
on seizure counts included in the PK/PD analysis seems to be different from the effect reported in the clinical 
studies  N01266  and  N01263.  The  popPK simulations  were  performed to  support  the  proposed  posology 
based on a similar exposure between adults and the paediatrics. 
Study  N01263:  A  phase  2a,  open-label,  single-arm,  multicenter,  fixed  3-step  up-titration  study  in 
participants  aged between ≥1  month  and <16  years with  epilepsy evaluating the  PK, safety, and efficacy 
of BRV. All participants  completed a 1-week Baseline Period, followed by a 3-week Evaluation Period with 
weekly fixed 3-step up-titration  of the  BRV dose. BRV oral solution was administered at weekly increasing 
doses of approximately 0.5mg/kg, 1.0mg/kg, and 2.0mg/kg bid for participants  <8 years of age. 
In the  subgroup of  children aged ≥1  month  to  <2 years, of the  26  patients  with  available 24-h  EEG  data 
both  at  baseline  and  at  the  end  of  the  study,  the  majority  had  an  unchanged  seizure status  during  the  
study:  10/26  were neither  seizure-free at baseline nor evaluation visit whereas 9/26  were seizure-free at 
both visits, i.e. 19/26 (73%)  had a unchanged seizure status on EEG. Of the remaining 7 patients, 5 of the 
15  patients  that  were not seizure free at baseline EEG had  become seizure-free on EEG  at the  end of the  
study,  and 2 went  from seizure-free to not  seizure-free. The proportions were similar in the  subgroups of 
patients  with  either POS or  primary generalized seizures. These data  cannot  support  an effect  of BRV as 
adjunctive therapy in children aged ≥1  month to <2  years with epilepsy. 
Based on diary data of seizure frequency over the 3-weeks treatment period, 4/27 (14.8%) in the ≥1 month 
to <2 years overall subgroup were 50% responders. In the POS subgroup in this age interval, the responder 
rate was 3/12 (25%). This was lower than in the older age intervals, where 9/41 (22%) in the overall group 
≥2  to <12  years, 7/19  (36.8%)  in the  POS subgroup of this  age interval were 50%  responders, and 4/12 
(33.3%)  in  the  overall group  ≥12  to  <16  years, 1/4  in  the  POS  subgroup  of this  age interval  were  50% 
responders. The low number of treated patients indicates that the data should be interpreted with caution. 
For  comparison, for  LEV,  the  50%  responder rate  for paediatric  patients  aged 1  month  to  <4  years was 
43.6%  vs 19.6%  for placebo. 
Study  N01266  is  an  ongoing  Phase  3,  open-label,  single-arm,  multicenter,  LTFU  study  to  evaluate the  
safety  and  efficacy of  BRV  in  study  participants  with  epilepsy.  In  addition  to  patients  having  completed 
study  N01263  being  offered  to  roll  over  to  study  N01266,  additional  paediatric  patients  were  enrolled 
directly into  the study. The total  number of participants was 249, of which only 28 were aged ≥1 month to 
<2 years and 14 were aged ≥2 years to <4  years. 
The 50% responder rate compared to baseline in patients aged ≥2 years to <17 years was 81/167 (50.9%) 
in the overall group and 61/134  (45.5%) in  the POS subgroup of the evaluable patients.  
For patients  ≥1 month  to <2  years, based on 24-h EEG  data obtained from a total of N=14  patients,  only 
8 patients contributed with ‘evaluable data’. Of these, 4/4 with  POS and 2/4 with PGS were 50% responders 
compared to baseline. 
In addition, a non-clinical comparison of BRV and LEV had previously been recommended and was provided 
by the MAH. The MAH presents data in support of the primary MoA for both BRV and LEV being via binding 
to SV2A with a reported 10- to 30-fold higher affinity of BRV for binding to SV2A than LEV. This corresponds 
quite well with  the 15-20-fold higher free plasma concentration for BRV than LEV at the maximal approved 
dose.  
Both  BRV and  LEV have a similar activity  profile in  animal models of acute seizures and chronic  epilepsy, 
which is quite different from the profile for AEDs with  other mechanisms of action. In all the animal models 
where both have an effect, the potency of BRV is higher than LEV, consistent with a higher affinity for SV2A.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No  randomised controlled  trial focusing  on clinical  efficacy in  the  paediatric population has  been provided 
in the  current application. Both studies N01263  and N01266  are single arm trials that  do not  allow for the  
isolation of  the effects of BRV. Therefore, the  efficacy of BRV is extrapolated from the  adult  population to  
those between 2-4 years old, based on presumed similar pathophysiology and PK/PD. This, however, gives 
rise to some uncertainty about the precise metrics of efficacy. Extrapolation of efficacy in adjunctive therapy 
of POS as established in adults is proposed by the MAH, with support of clinical pharmacology data. Similar 
exposure  as  in  adults  and  dose  recommendations  are  supported  with  population  PK  modelling  and 
simulation.  However, the  AHEG  did  not  consider that  the  pathophysiology in  patients  below two  years of 
age is sufficiently similar to  that  of adults,  to allow for an extrapolation based on only a PK bridge (similar 
exposure). 
It is not entirely clear that the  MoA of LEV and BRV are fully similar (efficacy exclusively mediated through 
SV2A). Further, there was limitations,  and consequent uncertainty, regarding the external validation of the 
BRV the PK/PD model and therefore PK/PD modelling cannot be used to support the extrapolation of efficacy 
from adults  to children below 4  years of age. 
With regards to differences in disease between children younger than 2 years of age and adults, it is unclear 
whether efficacy in isolated POS, as more commonly seen in adults, may be extrapolated to efficacy in POS 
with coexisting seizure types, which is an epileptic syndrome more often present in the younger age group. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
For safety, it  has been agreed at scientific  advice that  the  safety profile in children aged ≥1  month  to <4 
years should be compared to the safety in the older paediatric age group of ≥4 to <16 years and that the 
safety database in  the  total  paediatric patient  population should  include at  least 100  children exposed for 
at least 12 months. 
In the POS subgroup, 125 paediatric patients were exposed for at least 12 months, of which N=9 belonged 
to  the  1  month  to  <2  years, N=2  to  the  ≥2  to<4  years, and N=112  to  the ≥4  to  <16  years age group, 
respectively. There are very few  children below  the  age of 4  years. In the  POS subgroup,  125  paediatric 
patients were exposed for at least 12 months, of which N=9  belonged to the 1 month to  <2 years, N=2 to  
the ≥2  to<4  years, and N=112  to  the ≥4  to <16  years age group, respectively. Thus, the total  paediatric 
safety  database  appears  adequate,  although  the  number  of  exposed  children  in  the  two  youngest  age 
groups was very restricted in number.   
The MAH  has  provided a  safety update  based on a cut-off  date  14 July  2020  of  long-term  study  N01266. 
From this  interim  report of study  N01266,  N=28  infants  aged 1 month  to <2  years have been exposed to  
BRV with a mean exposure of 39 months and N=14  children aged ≥2 to <4 years were exposed for a mean 
duration of 32  months. In total,  15 infants  aged 1  month to <2  years and 7 children aged ≥2 to <4  years 
were exposed for at least 12 months. Considering the safety data available for participants ≥1 month to < 
2 years of age, there  are 34  participants who  were enrolled in the  ≥1 month  to <  2 years age group from 
the  Pool  Paediatric Studies.  Of  those 34  participants,  20  participants  aged  up  to  the ≥2  to  <4  years age 
group.  17  out  of the  20  participants  were exposed to  BRV for  more than  1  year. The  data  show  that  the 
safety profile of BRV in  this age group is similar to  the safety profile of BRV in the paediatric population of 
4  years to  <  16  years of age.  No  safety signal  was identified.  The safety database  is  still  limited  for  the 
youngest age groups but is considered sufficient. 
The  children  <4  years generally had  a higher  SAE  rate  than  the  older  children.  The TEAE  incidence  was 
similar for participants  with  POS aged <4  years and ≥4  to  <16  years except for patients  <4  years of age 
having a higher incidence of pyrexia and decreased appetite. Participants aged <4 years also had a higher 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

incidence of  some TEAEs in  the  SOCs of Infections  and infestations  and  Gastrointestinal  disorders, which 
were as normally observed in this age group. 
With  regards to TEAEs  of special interest in  the  paediatric population;  including  growth,  cognition,  sexual 
maturation, no TEAEs within  this category led to any new safety concerns for this age group.  
The safety profile in the age group <4  years of age was consistent with  that of older paediatric age groups 
with  no new safety findings in the  age group of <4  years of age. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The single-arm open-label uncontrolled study  design intrinsically makes specific attribution  of causality of 
side effects fraught with  uncertainty. 
The safety database,  particularly in  the  very young,  is relatively small, and  inferences of safety rely to  a 
certain extent on extrapolation from adults. 
In the  previous extension of indication  down to  4 years and above (EMEA/H/C/003898/II/0010/G),  it  was 
concluded that  insufficient  long-term data  on the  possible effects on growth,  neurocognitive development 
and  sexual maturation  was available. The  study data  from  the  current application  did  not  shed  sufficient 
light  on  these remaining  uncertainties.  Thus,  it  is considered adequate  that  the  RMP  Summary of safety 
concerns 
includes 
‘Long-term  effects  on  growth,  endocrine 
function  or  sexual  maturation, 
neurodevelopment, cognitive and psychomotor development in paediatric patients’ as missing information. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the current extension of indication procedure, the MAH seeks an extension of indication for the adjunctive 
treatment  of  partial  onset  seizures in  children  ≥1  month  to  <4  years of  age, based  on  extrapolation  of 
safety and efficacy from studies in patients  16  years and older, given similar exposure from the  proposed 
dosing regimen. Weight-based paediatric dosing regimens are proposed using population PK modelling and 
simulations.  
Extrapolation  of  efficacy  from  adults  to  children  above  2  years  of  age  based  on  similar  exposure  is 
considered acceptable based on  similarity  of disease, in  accordance with  prior  CHMP  SA  to  the  MAH  and 
based on available scientific understanding. The extrapolation of efficacy from adult to paediatrics ≥1 month 
to  <2  years of  age is  not  supported, due  to  limitations  in  the  PK/PD model,  and  uncertainties  about  the 
similarity of pathophysiology given the lack of maturation of the nervous system.  
The CHMP convened an AHEG on the 7th of October to  discuss whether an extension of indication for those 
below  2  years of  age could  be  based on  these  arguments.  The  AHEG  was  split  in  their  views regarding 
whether an extrapolation of efficacy may be based on similar drug exposure only and there were views that 
efficacy data from a well-designed study was needed for this  age group as well.  
The CHMP  is not sufficiently certain about the  possibility to extrapolate efficacy for BRV from efficacy data 
on LEV. Regarding this,  the AHEG was also split,  and among other views it was noted that the similarity of 
MoA is  not  sufficient but  clinical  data is  needed and  that  extrapolation should better  be based on data  on 
the same active substance (i.e. BRV) from a different age group than on data from a similar active substance 
(LEV) in the  same age group.  
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99325/2022 
Page 83/86 
 
 
 
 
In  summary, the  discussion held  by the  AHEG  did  not  provide clear support  the  extrapolation of  efficacy 
based similar drug exposure only, neither on efficacy results from a compound with similar MoA. Therefore, 
there was  not  sufficient  strength  and consistency of  arguments for an  extrapolation, to  impact  the  CHMP 
position  that  extrapolation  of  efficacy  from  adults  is  permissible  down  to  2  years,  whereas  substantial 
uncertainties about this  procedure exists for those that  are younger. 
The  paediatric  safety  profile  of  BRV  evaluated  in  the  long-term  follow-up  open-label,  single-arm  study 
N01266  as  adjunctive  treatment  was  consistent  with  previously  established  safety  profile  in  adult  and 
adolescent patients with  partial onset seizures from 16 years. The total paediatric safety database is in line 
with what  has previously been recommended by the CHMP for a paediatric indication, although the number 
of  exposed  children  in  the  two  youngest  age  groups  is  limited.  Overall,  however,  the  safety  profile  is 
acceptable in the  context, provided that efficacy is deemed to be established.   
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The CHMP agrees that the  extrapolated benefit of Briviact as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial 
onset  seizures  with  or  without  secondary  generalisation in  children  from  2  years  to  4  years of  age  is 
considered established and outweigh  the risks.  
It  is  also  agreed that  the  extrapolation of  efficacy to  children  aged ≥1  month  to  <2  years has  not  been 
established. Therefore, the CHMP cannot recommend an extension of the Briviact indication to this  younger 
paediatric population.    
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Briviact for the extension of indication  in children from 2 years of age is positive.

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In  accordance  with  Article  13(3)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  the  Agency  makes  available  a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product  assessed by the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial marketing 
authorisation  (MA)  and  is  continuously  updated  during  the  lifecycle  of  the  medicinal  product.  In 
particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the assessment report of 
the  CHMP and  the reasons for its  opinion in  favour of granting  the change to  the authorisation,  after 
deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential information, 
please  provide  the  EMA  Procedure  Assistant  your  proposal  for  deletion  of  commercially 
confidential  information (CCI)  in  “track  changes”  and  with  detailed  justification  by  11  February 
2022.  The  principles  to  be  applied  for  the  deletion  of  CCI  are  published  on  the  EMA  website  at 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/heads-medicines-agencies/european-medicines-
agency-guidance-document-identification-commercially-confidential-information_en.pdf 
In  addition,  should  you  consider  that  the  CHMP  assessment  report  contains  personal  data,  please 
provide the  EMA Procedure Assistant  your proposal for deletion of these data in  “track changes” and  
with  detailed  justification  by <No  date in  SIAMED>. We  would  like to remind  you that,  according  to 
Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”) ‘personal data’ 
means any information, relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (the ‘data subject’). An 
identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference 
to an identifier such as a name, an identification  number, location data, an online identifier or to  one 
or  more factors  specific to  the  physical,  physiological, genetic,  mental,  economic,  cultural  or  social 
identity of that  natural person. 
It  is  important  to  clarify that  pseudonymised data  are  also  considered personal data.  According to  
Article 4(5)  of  GDPR pseudonymisation means that  personal data is  processed in  a manner  that  the 
personal  data  can  no  longer  be  attributed  to  a  specific  data  subject  without  the  use  of  additional 
information (e.g. key-coded data).  
Accordingly, the name and the patient identification  number are two examples of personal data which 
may relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. The definitions also encompass for instance: 
office  e-mail  address  or  phone  number  of  a  company,  data  concerning  health,  e.g.  information  in 
medical records, clinical reports or case narratives which  relates to an identifiable individual.”

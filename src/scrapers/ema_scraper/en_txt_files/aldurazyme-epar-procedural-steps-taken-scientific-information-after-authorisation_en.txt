Section 4.2 
Home Infusion 
Infusion of Aldurazyme at home may be considered for 
patients who are tolerating their infusions well and have no 
history of moderate or severe IARs for a few months. The 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

decision to have a patient move to home infusion should be 
made after evaluation and upon recommendation by the 
treating physician.   
Home infusion infrastructure, resources, and procedures, 
including training, must be established and available to the 
healthcare professional. Home infusion should be 
supervised by a healthcare professional who should be 
always available during the home infusion and for a 
specified time after infusion. Appropriate information 
should be given by the treating physician and/or nurse to 
the patient and/or caregiver prior to initiation of home 
infusion. 
Dose and infusion rate should remain constant while at 
home, and not be changed without supervision of a 
healthcare professional. 
If the patient experiences adverse reactions during the 
home infusion, the infusion process should be stopped 
immediately, and appropriate medical treatment should be 
initiated (see section 4.4). Subsequent infusions may need 
to occur in a hospital or in an appropriate setting of 
outpatient care until no such adverse reaction is present.

Product Characteristics.

PL 
Based on the review of the available information, the CHMP 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Aldurazyme 
remains positive.  
Due to inconsistencies in the PSURs submitted and the 
relatively low patient exposure, the PSUR should remain on 
a yearly cycle. Furthermore, Aldurazyme remains under 
exceptional circumstances due to one pending specific 
obligation regarding the MPS I Registry, by which the MAH 
commits to collect long term safety and efficacy data in 
patients treated with Aldurazyme as well as data on natural 
disease progression in untreated patients. Annual updates 
will be provided at the time of the annual reassessment. 
The benefit-risk balance of the product will continue to be 
reviewed annually as part of the Annual Re-assessments.  
The CHMP concluded that the renewal can be granted with 
unlimited validity.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Sodium oxybate is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant  which reduces cataplexy in patients with 
narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and modifies sleep architecture reducing fragmented 
nighttime sleep.  
Xyrem was approved in the EU (Marketing Authorisation Number EU/1/05/312/001) on 13 October 2005, 
for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy and in 2007 for use in the treatment of 
narcolepsy with cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy. The Marketing Authorisation was renewed with 
unlimited validity on 8 September 2015.  
The purpose of this submission is to seek approval for the extension of the use of Xyrem for the Treatment 
of narcolepsy with cataplexy in adolescents and children from the age of 7 years. 
The  clinical  summary  documents  supporting  this  submission  focus  primarily  on  findings  from  a  study  in 
paediatrics  (study  13-005)  conducted  with  sodium  oxybate  in  paediatric  patients  with  narcolepsy  with 
cataplexy to generate efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic (PK) information.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of sodium oxybate have been characterised in a 
series of studies previously submitted and reviewed upon the Marketing Authorization Application for 
Xyrem. 
In this application for the extension of the indication to adolescents and children from the age of 7 years, 
the applicant provides two (new) juvenile animal studies: 
- A Pilot Pharmacokinetic/Tolerability Study of Xyrem® (Sodium Oxybate) Following a Single Oral 
(Gavage) or Intravenous Dose in Juvenile Rats with a Lactational Exposure Evaluation in F0 Dams 
(Study 1301-016; non-GLP) 
- A 10-Week Juvenile Toxicity Study of Xyrem (Sodium Oxybate) by Oral (Gavage) in Rats with 
an 8-Week Recovery Period (Study 20078509; GLP) 
2.2.2.  Toxicology  
A Pilot Pharmacokinetic/Tolerability Study of Xyrem® (Sodium Oxybate) Following a Single Oral (Gavage) 
or Intravenous Dose in Juvenile Rats with a Lactational Exposure Evaluation in F0 Dams (Study 1301-
016; non-GLP) 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the single dose pharmacokinetics and tolerability of sodium 
oxybate in juvenile Sprague Dawley rats following a single oral or intravenous administration. Lactational 
exposure in lactating F0 dams was also evaluated upon a single oral dose administration. 
Male and female Sprague Dawley rat pups (groups of 15, 30 or 60 /sex) were administered a single oral 
dose of sodium oxybate at 200 or 2000mg/kg on PND 4, 21, 28, or 49, or at 1000mg/kg on PND 5, or a 
Assessment report

single intravenous bolus administration at 120mg/kg on PND 28. Fifteen dams were administered a single 
oral dose of 2000 mg/kg on LD 12. 
Results 
Sodium oxybate was considered to be well tolerated when administered orally at 200mg/kg at all of the 
ages evaluated, at 1000mg/kg on PND 5 (the only age evaluated at this dose level), and at 2000mg/kg 
beginning on PND 28. Among pups PND 4, 9 males and 9 females administered 2000 mg/kg (from a 
group of 60 animals/sex) were found dead prior to blood collection 2 hours post-dose. One of these 
animals had laceration of the esophagus at necropsy, evidence of a gavage error. No other findings were 
made on the remainder of the animals at necropsy. On PND 21, 1 female at 2000 mg/kg (from a group of 
30 animals/sex) was found dead prior to blood collection 2 hours post-dose. There were no findings at 
necropsy for this animal. Clinical signs, as decreased activity, were observed in all age groups, including 
the dams, after the administration of 2000 mg/kg, as well as after the oral administration of 1000 mg/kg 
and i.v. administration of 120 mg/kg to PND 5 and PND 28 pups, respectively. 
Systemic exposure to sodium oxybate appeared to be independent of sex in juvenile rats. The following 
Cmax (μg/mL) and AUCTlast (μg*h/mL) values (males/females combined) were determined in the juvenile 
rat:

A 10-Week Juvenile Toxicity Study of Xyrem (Sodium Oxybate) by Oral (Gavage) in Rats with an 8-Week 
Recovery Period (Study 20078509; GLP) 
A  10-week  toxicity  study  was  conducted  in  male  and  female  juvenile  Sprague  Dawley  rats  with  sodium 
oxybate given orally once daily (0, 100, 300, or 900mg/kg/day) from PND 21 to PND 90. This age is stated 
to cover a corresponding age in children from 2 to 16 years. Reversibility was assessed during an 8-week 
recovery period. The study included the following measurements or assessments: general toxicity (viability, 
clinical signs, body weights, body weight gains, food consumption, ophthalmology, clinical pathology, gross 
necropsy findings, organ weights, and histopathology), neurobehavior (acoustic startle habituation, motor 
activity, and Morris water maze), bone growth (femur lengths and bone densitometry), and reproductive 
endpoints (sexual maturation assessed by vaginal patency in females and balano-preputial separation in 
males,  estrous  cycle  evaluations,  reproductive  capacity,  ovarian  and  uterine  parameters,  and  sperm 
evaluation). Toxicokinetics was evaluated on the first day of treatment (PND 21), at mid-treatment (PND 
49) and at the end of the treatment period (PND 90). In all three days, blood samples were collected post-
dose up to 4 hours post dose; on PND 49 and PND 90, blood samples were also collected pre-dose.

Results 
Clinical signs 
During the first week of dosing, mortalities were observed at the mid dose (1 female, on PND 27) and the 
top  dose  (2  males  and  1  female,  on  PND  21,  22  or  23,  respectively).  They  were  preceded  by  sodium 
oxybate-related clinical signs (bradypnea, deep breathing, decreased activity, uncoordinated gait, impaired 
righting reflex), in line with its expected pharmacology. Sodium oxybate exposure levels were not measured 
in these animals as they were found dead. Three additional deaths (1 female top dose, 1 male mid dose 
and 1 female control) were unrelated to oxybate.  
Clinical signs attributed to expected pharmacology of oxybate were also observed in surviving animals of 
the 300 and 900 mg/kg/day dose groups. These clinical signs generally occurred within the first two weeks 
of dosing at  300 mg/kg/day and within the first three weeks of dosing at  900 mg/kg/day. Clinical signs 
observed in both dose groups have included decreased activity, uncoordinated gait, partially closed eye(s), 
deep breathing, low carriage, decreased respiratory rate. Additional signs, such as abnormal gait, lying on 
its side and lack of and/or impaired righting reflex, were observed in the 900 mg/kg/day dose group. 
Body weight, body weight gain and food consumption 
There were slight reductions in body weight and body weight gain at 900mg/kg/day, which persisted 
during recovery, and in food consumption from 300mg/kg/day, which were not noted during recovery.  
There was a statistically significant reduction (p≤ 0.01) in mean body weight gains in the males in the 900 
mg/kg/day dose group for the overall dose period interval of PND 21 to 90 compared to controls (-12.03% 
from  controls).  Mean  body  weight  gains  were  significantly  reduced  (p≤  0.05)  in  the  females  in  the  900 
mg/kg/day dose group for the overall dose period interval of PND 21 to 90 compared to controls (-6.27% 
from controls). 
Mean body weights remained reduced or significantly reduced (p≤ 0.01 or p≤ 0.05) in the males in the 
900 mg/kg/day dose group throughout the recovery period from PND 93 to PND 153 compared to 
controls (-8.13% to -17.23% from controls), reflecting reduced body weights in the dosing period. 
Mean body weights remained reduced or significantly reduced (p≤ 0.01 or p≤ 0.05) in the females in the 
900 mg/kg/day dose group throughout the recovery period in the premating period from PND 93 to PND 
153 (-2.81% to -12.76% from controls). 
Interestingly, body weight gain in the low dose group was in some groups higher than the control group. 
Food consumption was decreased during the early part of the study. Mean food consumption was reduced 
or significantly reduced (p≤ 0.01) in the males and females in the 300 mg/kg/day dose group for the 
intervals of PND 21 to 28 (-61.7% and -64.6% from controls, respectively). Mean food consumption was 
significantly reduced (p≤ 0.01) in the males in the 900 mg/kg/day dose group at each calculated interval 
from PND 21 to 56 compared to controls (-11.6% to -68.6% from controls). In the females in the 900 
mg/kg/day dose group, mean food consumption was significantly reduced (p≤ 0.01) at each calculated 
interval from PND 21 to 42 compared to controls (-45.1% to -69.1% from controls). These effects were 
considered to be linked to the observed clinical signs of decreased activity and general CNS depression 
preventing normal feeding behaviour during the early weeks of the study. 
Sexual maturation and reproductive capacity 
No sodium oxybate-related effects were noted on male and female sexual maturity and reproductive 
parameters. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021

There were no sodium oxybate-related effects on sexual maturation in the males at 100 and 300 
mg/kg/day as assessed by balano-preputial separation. Sodium oxybate-related effects on sexual 
maturation were noted for the males at 900 mg/kg/day. This delay in sexual maturation was not  
considered adverse because: 1) the day of sexual maturation was within the historical control range; 2) 
there was no effect on mating and fertility; and 3) the effect is related to reduced body weights in this 
dose group. There were no sodium oxybate-related effects on female sexual maturation at any dose 
based on vaginal patency.  
Estrous cycles were evaluated by examining the vaginal cytology of samples obtained by vaginal lavage 
for 14 consecutive days before initiation of cohabitation and then until spermatozoa were observed in a 
smear of the vaginal contents and/or a copulatory plug was observed in situ during the cohabitation 
period. There were no sodium oxybate-related effects on estrous cycling in the females. The number of 
estrous stages per 14 days was similar among the four dose groups (2.7 to 3.1) before the start of 
cohabitation and during the precohabitation period.  
On PNDs 147 to 153 (after 8 week recovery period), within each dose group, consecutive order was used 
to assign rats to cohabitation (i.e., pairing), one male per one female. Sibling matings were excluded. The 
cohabitation period consisted of 7 days. Rats were examined for evidence of mating daily throughout the 
cohabitation period until spermatozoa were observed in a smear of the vaginal contents and/or a 
copulatory plug was observed in situ. There were no sodium oxybate-related effects on days in 
cohabitation prior to mating (2.1 to 3.1 days across all dose groups), percent of animals that mated 
(83.3% to 100%), or percent of animals that mated with confirmed pregnancies (75.0% to 94.4%) at 
any dose level.  
There were no sodium oxybate-related effects on any ovarian or uterine parameter at any dose. 
Pregnancy was confirmed in 13 (72.2%), 17 (94.4%), 12 (70.6%), and 14 (87.5%) females in the 0, 
100, 300, and 900 mg/kg/day dose groups, respectively. The litter averages for corpora lutea, 
implantations, percentage of preimplantation loss, live and dead embryos and the percentage of 
postimplantation loss were similar among the four dose groups. No dam had a litter consisting of only 
dead embryos. No placentae examined had any detectable abnormalities. 
There were no sodium oxybate-related changes in sperm parameters (vas deferens sperm motility or 
caudal epididymal sperm density) in the recovery groups. Overall, reproductive capacity as evaluated in 
study groups after 8 weeks recovery seemed to be normal. 
Behavioral assessment 
No sodium oxybate-related effects were noted on behavioral assessments (acoustic startle habituation, 
motor activity, and Morris watermaze). 
Motor assessment were conducted on PND60 and PND 120 prior to dose administration. At this stage of 
the study (PND60, dosed since PND21, 39 days), most rats were habituated to sodium oxybate. There 
were no sodium oxybate-related differences in either ambulation or fine movement in the males and 
females, as evaluated during motor activity testing on PND 60 (±2 days) or on PND 120 (±2 days) at any 
dose. 
Acoustic startle habituation assessment were conducted on PND65 (cohort 1ab) and PND 125 (cohort 
2ab). There were no sodium oxybate-related effects evident during acoustic startle testing in the males or 
females when evaluated on PND 65 (±2 days) or on PND 125 (±2 days) at any dose. 
Morris water maze evaluation was performed between PNDs 70 and 90 and between PNDs 130 and 150. 
There were no sodium oxybate-related effects on learning and memory in the males or females when 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 10/92 
 
  
  
 
evaluated beginning on PND 70 through PND 90 or beginning on PND 130 through PND 150 using the 
Morris watermaze test at any dose.  
Femur measurements 
On the day of scheduled euthanasia, the length of the right and left femur were recorded for the rats 
assigned to the main study and recovery. The length of the femur was recorded in millimeters (mm). The 
right femurs were saved for histopathology evaluation. Applicant concludes that there were no sodium 
oxybate-related effects on mean femur length indicative of impact on bone growth at any dose level in 
the males or females at the end of the dose or recovery periods. However, the following was also 
observed: The mean right femur length was significantly increased (p≤ 0.01 or p≤ 0.05) at the end of the 
recovery period in the males and females in the 100 mg/kg/day dose group compared to controls 
(+3.33% and +2.86% from controls, respectively). In addition, the mean left femur length was 
significantly increased (p≤ 0.05) at the end of the recovery period in the females in the 100 mg/kg/day 
dose group compared to controls (+2.82% from controls). These increases in mean femur length were by 
the applicant considered unrelated to sodium oxybate because they were not dose dependent.  
Upon peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT), the applicant concludes the following: There 
were slight to mild increases in bone mass (total and trabecular bone mineral content [BMC]; +13% and 
+57%, respectively) and density (total and trabecular bone mineral density [BMD]; +11% and +53%, 
respectively) at the femur distal metaphysis in males at 900 mg/kg/day. Both males and females at 900 
mg/kg/day presented minimal increases in femur diaphysis total area (+8% and +9%, respectively) 
associated with minimal increases in cortical area (+7% and +9%, respectively) and BMC (+7% and 
+9%, respectively). These changes in bone size/geometry at the diaphysis were reflected by minimal 
increases in cross-sectional moment of inertia ([CSMI]; +15% and +20%, respectively). These changes 
were of limited amplitude and were not associated with changes in bone length, bone histology, alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) or clinical signs indicative of fracture and therefore these findings were considered 
non-adverse in this study. There were no sodium oxybate-related changes in either males or females at 
300 or 100 mg/kg/day in femur pQCT parameters (distal metaphysis and diaphysis). There were no 
sodium oxybate-related changes in females at 900 mg/kg/day in femur distal metaphysis pQCT 
parameters. Following an 8 week recovery period, there were no sodium oxybate-related changes in 
either males or females at ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in femur pQCT parameters (distal metaphysis and 
diaphysis), suggesting recovery”. Further to this finding, Applicant considers it to be linked to the effect of 
sodium oxybate on growth hormone. 
Histopathology 
No sodium oxybate-related effects were noted on histopathology, including neurohistopathology. 
Toxicokinetics and safety margins 
Following dosing, sodium oxybate concentrations on PND 21, 49 and 90 were generally quantifiable until 
2 hours postdose for the 100 mg/kg group, until 4 hours postdose for the 300 and 900 mg/kg groups (4 
hours was the last sampling time point). Peak sodium oxybate concentrations were observed between 0.5 
and 1.0 hour postdose for the 100 and 300 mg/kg groups, and between 0.5 and 4.0 hours postdose for 
the 900 mg/kg group. The half-life ranged from 0.36 to 1.54 hours. It should be noted here that for 
PND21, tmax for the highest dose could not be properly established as a decline in plasma concentration 
was not observed at the last sampling time point. Therefore, t½ could not be determined either for this 
dose at this time of the study. 
Systemic exposure as defined by Cmax and AUC(0-t) increased with increasing dose levels. Overall, the 
increase in exposure was greater than dose proportional throughout the dose range tested.

Following repeated administration at 100, 300 and 900 mg/kg to male and female rats, systemic 
exposure on PND 49 and PND 90 relative to PND 21 generally decreased except for the females of the 
100 mg/kg group. Accumulation ratios ranged from 0.37 to 1.00, indicating exposures tended to be 
higher in younger rats at all dose levels.  
The NOAEL for growth and development was considered to be ≥900mg/kg/day, which corresponds to 
sodium oxybate Cmax and AUC values of 500μg/mL and 1160μg*h/mL, respectively, on PND 90. Due to 
the deaths that occurred at mid and high doses during the first week of treatment, the low dose of 
100mg/kg/day was considered as the NOAEL for acute toxicity, which corresponds to Cmax and AUC values 
of 35.9μg/mL and 27.1μg*h/mL, respectively. 
The following Cmax (μg/mL) and AUC0-t values (μg*h/mL) were determined at PND 21, 49 and 90:

With regards to acute toxicity observed in the 10-week repeat administration study in juvenile rats, the 
corresponding mean Cmax and AUC0-t values of 35.9μg/mL and 27.1μg*h/mL, respectively, associated 
with the NOAEL of 100mg/kg/day, were below the exposure levels cited above in the clinical pediatric 
Study 13-005 or predicted in the population PK report. However, the mortalities observed in juvenile rats 
at higher doses occurred in animals of 21 to 27 days old, equivalent to ages well below the minimal 
recommended age for treatment of narcolepsy in children (7 years). Moreover, data from the pilot 
pharmacokinetic/tolerability study in juvenile rats has shown that exposure to a similarly high dose of 
sodium oxybate decreased with age between PND 4 and PND 28, thereby reducing the risk of acute 
toxicity in older juvenile subjects. This conclusion is confirmed further by the fact that in the pilot 
PK/tolerability study in juvenile rats, a single dose of 2000mg/kg (providing a mean Cmax of 715 μg/mL in 
PND 28 pups or 380μg/mL in PND 49 pups) was well tolerated in pups of 28 days or older.

2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment was conducted, and the applicant provided an acceptable justification 
for its absence. It is anticipated that the active substance is the sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid 
(GHB), an endogenous neurotransmitter and therefore is not expected to impact on the environment.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In this application for the extension of the indication to adolescents and children from the age of 7 years, 
the applicant provides two juvenile animal studies, both conducted in rats: a pilot single dose 
pharmacokinetic/tolerability study and a pivotal, GLP-compliant, 10-week with 8-week recovery period 
study. The first study used animals aged from PND 4 up to PND 49, as well as dams on LD 12; in the 
second study, animals received daily doses of sodium oxybate for 10 weeks starting from PND 21 and up 
to PND 90. According to the applicant, the corresponding age in humans of PND 21 to 49 in rats is 2-16 
years. 
Results from the single dose pilot pharmacokinetic/tolerability study showed that, upon single dose 
administration, toxicity and systemic exposures were age dependent. After the oral administration of 
2000 mg/kg, although clinical signs were observed in all age groups, mortality has only occurred among 
juvenile animals at PND 4 (9 out of 60 per sex) and at PND 21 (1 female out of 30). The differences 
observed in the incidence of mortality appeared to be, at least partially, related to systemic exposures. 
Plasma Cmax values observed after the administration of 2000 mg/kg to juvenile rats at PND 4, 21, 28 and 
49 were 2880, 1140, 715 and 380 μg/mL, respectively. Plasma AUC0-2hr (AUC0-4 hr for animals at PND 49) 
were 3490, 1380, 784 and 912 μg*h/mL, respectively. 
In the 10-week pivotal study, no effects on growth and development were observed up to the highest 
tested dose (900 mg/kg/day). The exposure margins at this dose, as calculated by the applicant, were 
1.9 to 3.8, based on Cmax, and 0.7 or 1.7, based on AUC. These are low to null safety margins for effects 
on growth and development, even if it needs to be noted that, in the case of margins based on AUC, the 
applicant has compared animal AUC0-4hr with human AUC0-24hr values.  
Furthermore, mortality and clinical signs were observed at 900 and 300 mg/kg/day (deaths occurred 
within the first week of treatment, i.e, up to PND 27; clinical signs were observed during the first 2 and 3 
weeks of treatment in the 300 and 900 mg/kg/day dose groups, respectively).  Therefore, the general 
toxicity NOAEL was set at 100 mg/kg/day, the lowest tested dose. At this dose, systemic exposures were 
bellow the observed or predicted human exposures. 
The applicant suggests that the mortalities observed in this study are less relevant to the adolescents and 
children from the age of 7 years, taking into account that (i) the mortalities were observed in animals of 
21 to 27 days old, equivalent to ages well below the minimal recommended age for treatment of 
narcolepsy in children (7 years), (ii) the pharmacokinetic/tolerability study in juvenile rats has shown that 
exposure to a similarly high dose of sodium oxybate decreased with age between PND 4 and PND 28, 
thereby reducing the risk of acute and that (iii) in pilot PK/tolerability study in juvenile rats, a single dose 
of 2000mg/kg (providing a mean Cmax of 715 μg/mL in PND 28 pups or 380μg/mL in PND 49 pups) was 
well tolerated in pups of 28 days or older. 
However, it is not fully clear that the observation of mortalities only during up to PND 27 are related or 
solely related to the age of the animals. For the mid and high doses, there were higher systemic 
exposures at PND 21 than at the later time points. Additionally, there could be a development of 
tolerance.  
The applicant was asked further discuss the results of the pivotal 10-week juvenile animal study, namely, 
(i) in terms of how the juvenile animals compared to adult rats in sensitivity to general toxicity of oxybate 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 13/92 
 
  
  
and mortality, for equivalent systemic exposures, and (ii) considering the possibility that the observation 
of mortalities only within the first week of treatment (up to PND 27), and also of toxicity only within the 
first weeks, may have been due to the higher systemic exposures at this age and /or development of 
tolerance. Additionally, the applicant was asked to recalculate the margins of exposure based on AUC 
values using AUC with same time intervals (i.e. not to compared animal AUC0-4 hr with human AUC0-24hr) 
and to justify for the age range of the animals used in the study.  
Applicant acknowledged that rat pups appear more sensitive to respiratory depression and other effects 
e.g. sedation induced by sodium oxybate compared to adult rat. Whether this phenomenon of difference 
in sensitivity is clinically relevant can apparently not be deduced from available clinical data. The 
Applicant has added extra warnings in SmPC to increase awareness of the effect on respiratory 
depression induced by Xyrem.  
A more extensive nonclinical literature review on the cognitive effects of sodium oxybate in animals has 
been conducted by the Applicant. Both acute and chronic effects (up to one month treatment) of sodium 
oxybate were evaluated in rats of various ages. Altogether, it is not possible to exclude that sodium 
oxybate might trigger some memory/learning impairment in healthy (non-narcoleptic) juvenile rats. 
However, there are no non-clinical studies that have investigated the cognitive effects of sodium oxybate 
in animal models of narcolepsy. The MAH provided a thorough discussion of the clinical relevance of 
nonclinical data indicating that GHB (sodium oxybate) may induce cognitive deficits. These observations 
were found in healthy animals and translatability to narcolepsy is not established. On the contrary, clinical 
experience shows improved scholastic performance, neurocognition, and quality of life of patients 
suffering from narcolepsy following treatment with sodium oxybate. 
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP concluded that non-clinical package is sufficient to support this extension of indication 
application.   
Considering the submitted justification, sodium oxybate is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Narcolepsy  is  a  life-long  neurologic  disease  for  which  no  cure  has  been  identified.  The  prevalence  of 
Narcolepsy in the EU is 47 individuals/100,000 persons (Ohayon, 2002). There are two types of Narcolepsy; 
Type  1  Narcolepsy  (NT1)  (previously  termed  narcolepsy  with  cataplexy)  and  Type  2  narcolepsy  (NT2) 
(previously termed narcolepsy without cataplexy).  
Cataplexy may be a highly disabling NT1-specific symptom, and the best clinical diagnostic marker of the 
disease.  Other  symptoms  such  as  sleep-related  hallucinations,  sleep  paralysis,  even  if  non-specific  to 
narcolepsy, are frequent and found in 50% of patients with narcolepsy (Lopez, 2016). 
Narcolepsy  type  1  often  arises  in  childhood  or  adolescence  (Postiglione,  2018).  Symptoms  may  start 
abruptly  and  sometimes  dramatically  with  the  sudden  occurrence  of  extreme  sleepiness  and  complete 
cataplexy, or progressively and insidiously, with EDS or weight gain being the only symptoms over weeks 
or  months.  Although  cataplexy  is  the  most  specific  symptom  of  the  disorder,  it  is  usually  not  the  first 
symptom to appear and may not be manifested for some 1 to 5 years after EDS occurs. The symptoms of 
paediatric  narcolepsy  show  very  similar  expression  to  that  seen  in  adults.  The  symptoms  are  frequently 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 14/92 
 
  
  
associated  with  metabolic,  cardiovascular,  and  neuropsychiatric  comorbidities,  as  well  as  other  sleep 
pathologies. 
In both adults and paediatrics there may be a great deal of variability in disease expression. This variability 
in presentation often leads to difficulties in recognising the condition or making the diagnosis at an early 
stage. Narcolepsy in children, therefore, is frequently underdiagnosed or mistaken for other diseases, and 
may not even be considered in the differential diagnosis of the presenting complaint. 
Narcolepsy with cataplexy has a dramatic impact on the quality of life (QoL) in children and adolescents: 
sleep attacks and waxing and waning drowsiness affect attention span and school performance, which may 
result  in  school  failure.  Moreover,  frequent  cataplexy,  generalised  hypotonia,  mood  variability,  and 
irritability may severely impact social life, leading to poor social integration. Also, weight gain and/or morbid 
obesity  (a  commonly  observed  feature)  may  dramatically  worsen  self-esteem  and  reduce  physical 
performance.  Consequently,  an  early  diagnosis  with  appropriate  treatment,  possibly 
including 
pharmacotherapy, is fundamental to allow children or adolescents with narcolepsy to reach a normal school 
performance and to reduce social impairment (Lecendreux, 2012). The burden of this disorder is heavily 
perceived by children compared to adults. 
Current treatments for narcolepsy are symptomatic, including wake-promoting therapeutics that increase 
presynaptic dopamine release and anticataplectic agents that activate monoaminergic neurotransmission. 
The treatment options currently available for narcolepsy are often unsatisfactory due to suboptimal efficacy, 
troublesome side effects, development of drug tolerance, and inconvenience. 
Sodium oxybate is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant  which reduces cataplexy in patients with 
narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and modifies sleep architecture reducing fragmented 
nighttime sleep. Xyrem was approved in the EU (Marketing Authorisation Number EU/1/05/312/001) on 13 
October 2005, for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy and in 2007 for use in the 
treatment of narcolepsy with cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy. The Marketing Authorisation was 
renewed with unlimited validity on 8 September 2015.  
Sodium oxybate has been used off-label to treat narcolepsy symptoms in children and adolescents, since it 
is a chronic disease and there are currently no licensed treatments in the EU for the paediatric population. 
Data from published studies in paediatric and adult patients indicate a similar safety profile and therapeutic 
response  to  sodium  oxybate  in  the  age  groups  of  <18  and  ≥18  years  (Murali  and  Kotagal,  2006;  Aran, 
2010; Lecendreux, 2012; Mansukhani and Kotagal, 2012; Huang and Guilleminault, 2009; Poli, 2012). 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.  
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
As part of the original MAA, the PK of sodium oxybate was studied in healthy adult subjects, adult patients 
with narcolepsy, adult patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy, and adult patients with hepatic impairment. 
In addition to referencing the established PK profile of Xyrem in adult patients, support for the extension 
of the Xyrem PI from 7 years of age for treatment of narcolepsy with cataplexy is provided by PK data from 
the 1 completed paediatric study 13-005. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 15/92 
 
  
  
Data from 4 adult subject studies (3 studies in healthy adults [Studies OMC-SXB-9, 09-002, and 13-010] 
and 1 in adult patients with narcolepsy [Study OMC-SXB-10]) and from paediatric patients from Study 13-
005  were  gathered  on  a  population  PK  (popPK)  to  describe  the  PK  of  sodium  oxybate  oral  solution  in 
paediatric patients and to assess sources of variability in plasma exposure and to provide a framework for 
evaluating whether covariate-based dose adjustments may be warranted. Covariates that were analysed 
included  intrinsic  factors,  i.e.,  body  size  (body  surface  area  [BSA;  m2;  continuous],  body  weight  [kg; 
continuous],  lean  body  mass  [kg;  continuous],  body  mass  index  [BMI;  continuous]),  age  (years, 
categorical),  sex  [male,  female;  categorical],  race    [American  Indian  or  Alaska  Native,  Asian,  Black  or 
African American, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, White, other; categorical], and disease status 
[narcoleptic,  healthy;  categorical];  and  extrinsic  factors,  i.e.,  prandial  status  (fasted,  fed;  categorical), 
diurnal factor (AM dosing, PM dosing; categorical), and bioanalytical method (bioanalytical method 1, 2, 3, 
4; categorical). 
PK data was obtained from a Phase II/III randomised, double-blinded efficacy and safety study in paediatric 
subjects with narcolepsy with cataplexy (Study 13-005) and subsequently combined with data from 4 Phase 
I clinical trials in adults. This included 3 studies in healthy adults (Studies OMC-SXB-9, 09-002, and 13-
010) and 1 in adult subjects with narcolepsy (Study OMC-SXB-10).  
Sodium oxybate PK profile in adults 
Sodium oxybate is absorbed rapidly following oral administration with an absolute bioavailability of about 
88%. The average peak plasma concentrations (1st and 2nd peak) following administration of a 9g daily 
dose divided into 2 equivalent doses given 4 hours apart were 78 and 142µg/mL, respectively.  The 
average time to peak plasma concentration (tmax) ranged from 0.5 to 2 hours in 8 PK studies. Following 
oral administration, the plasma levels of sodium oxybate increase more than proportionally with 
increasing dose.  Single doses greater than 4.5g have not been studied. Administration of sodium oxybate 
immediately after a high fat meal resulted in delayed absorption (average tmax increased from 0.75 h to 
2.0 h) and a reduction in peak plasma level (Cmax) by a mean of 58% and of systemic exposure (AUC) 
by 37%. 
Sodium oxybate is a hydrophilic compound with an apparent volume of distribution averaging 190 to 
384mL/kg. At sodium oxybate concentrations ranging from 3 to 300µg/mL, less than 1% is bound to 
plasma proteins. 
Studies in vitro with pooled human liver microsomes indicate that sodium oxybate does not significantly 
inhibit the activities of the human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A up to the concentration of 3mM (378µg/mL). These levels are considerably 
higher than levels achieved with therapeutic doses. 
The clearance of sodium oxybate is almost entirely by biotransformation to carbon dioxide, which is then 
eliminated by expiration. On average, less than 5% of unchanged medicinal product appears in human 
urine within 6 to 8 hours after dosing. Faecal excretion is negligible. 
Because  the  kidney  does  not  have  a  significant  role  in  the  excretion  of  sodium  oxybate,  no  PK  study  in 
patients with renal dysfunction was conducted; no effect of renal function on sodium oxybate PK would be 
expected. 
Sodium oxybate undergoes significant presystemic (hepatic first-pass) metabolism. After a single oral dose 
of 25mg/kg, AUC values were double in cirrhotic patients, with apparent oral clearance reduced from 9.1 
in healthy adults to 4.5 and 4.1mL/min/kg in Class A (without ascites) and Class C (with ascites) patients, 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 16/92 
 
  
  
respectively.  Elimination  half-life  was  significantly  longer  in  Class  C  and  Class  A  patients  than  in  control 
subjects (mean terminal elimination half-life [t1/2] of 59 and 32 vs 22 minutes). 
The effect of race on metabolism of sodium oxybate has not been evaluated. 
Drug interaction studies in healthy adults with sodium oxybate (single dose of 2.25g) and lorazepam (single 
dose of 2mg) and zolpidem tartrate (single dose of 5mg) demonstrated no pharmacokinetic interactions 
between sodium oxybate and protriptyline hydrochloride, duloxetine (antidepressants), zolpidem tartrate 
(a  hypnotic),  lorazepam  (an  anxiolytic),  tramadol  (a  central  analgesic),  ibuprofen  (a  non-steroidal  anti-
inflammatory),  diclofenac  (a  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory)  and  modafinil  (a  stimulant).  The  co-
administration of omeprazole (a medicinal product that alters gastric pH) has no clinically significant effect 
on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  sodium  oxybate.    The  dosage  of  sodium  oxybate  therefore  does  not  require 
adjustment when given concomitantly with proton pump inhibitors. 
Co-administration of sodium oxybate and diclofenac in healthy volunteers reduced impairments to attention 
compared with the administration of Xyrem alone as measured by psychometric tests. 
No  additional  effect  on  sleepiness  was  observed  when  comparing  single  doses  of  sodium  oxybate  alone 
(2.25g) and sodium oxybate (2.25g) in combination with either duloxetine (60mg) or tramadol (100mg). 
Increased  sleepiness  was  observed  after  concomitant  administration  of  sodium  oxybate  (2.25g)  and 
lorazepam (2mg).  
The  co-administration  of  sodium  oxybate  (6g  per  day)  with  valproate  (1250mg  per  day)  resulted  in  an 
increase in systemic exposure to sodium oxybate by approximately 25% and no significant change in Cmax. 
No  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  valproate  was  observed.  The  resulting  pharmacodynamic  effects, 
including increased impairment in cognitive function and sleepiness, were greater with co administration 
than  those  observed  with  either  drug  alone.  If  concomitant  use  is  warranted,  patient  response  and 
tolerability should be monitored and dose adjustments made if required. 
Paediatric PK studies and population PK analysis 
Support for the extension of the Xyrem PI from 7 years of age for treatment of narcolepsy with cataplexy 
is provided by PK data from the completed paediatric study 13-005. 
Objectives 
Primary:  Development  of  a  structural  PK  model  to  describe  the  PK  of  sodium  oxybate  oral  solution  in 
paediatric patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy.  
Secondary: Identification of covariates that contribute to PK variability. 
PK population 
174 patients (Paediatric: 29 (16.7%), Adult: 145 (83.3%)). There were a total of 3775 observations, 333 
(8.8%) from paediatrics and 3442 (91.2%) from adults. Data were available from patients who received 
sodium oxybate as a single dose of 4.5g or multiple doses (up to 52 weeks) (Range 1-4.5g twice daily).

NONMEM® version 7.3 was used to fit compartmental models to concentration-versus time data of oxybate 
after  administration  of  sodium  oxybate.  Covariates  were  body  size  (body  surface  area  [BSA;  m2; 
continuous],  body  weight  [kg;  continuous],  lean  body  mass  [kg;  continuous],  body  mass  index  [BMI; 
continuous]), age [years, continuous], age category [paediatric, child, adolescent, adult; categorical]), sex 
[male,  female;  categorical],  race  [American  Indian  or  Alaska  Native,  Asian,  Black  or  African  American, 
Native  Hawaiian  or  other  Pacific  Islander,  White,  other;  categorical],  and  disease  status  [narcoleptic, 
healthy;  categorical];  and  extrinsic  factors,  i.e.,  prandial  status  (fasted,  fed;  categorical),  diurnal  factor 
(AM dosing, PM dosing; categorical), and bioanalytical method (bioanalytical method 1, 2, 3, 4; categorical). 
Standard statistical analyses were applied. 
Results 
The  final  structural  model  was  a  2-compartment  model  with  Michaelis-Menten  clearance  and  first  order 
absorption. Final parameter estimates are shown below. 
Simulations for nonlinear clearance 
The simulated PK profiles show that dosing on a gram/patient basis results in higher plasma concentrations 
of oxybate in children than adolescents receiving sodium oxybate at the same gram dose. Both paediatric 
populations have higher plasma concentrations of oxybate than adults at the same gram/patient dose, with 
greater  differences between adults and paediatrics being apparent at higher doses. Differences between 
adults and paediatrics are expected due to lower body weights (and lower VC and clearance) in paediatric 
patients. The average profile of children at 3g BID was comparable to the adolescent profile at 4.5g BID.

Mean Day 1 PK profiles for adult and paediatric patients administered sodium oxybate on a mg/kg basis 
are  displayed  in  Figure  3-4.  When  sodium  oxybate  is  administered  on  a  mg/kg  basis,  the  simulated  PK 
profiles are similar among the 3 populations at all mg/kg doses evaluated.

Dose proportionality 
To evaluate dose proportionality, simulations were performed to predict exposure parameters (Cmax and 
AUC)  in  adult  and  paediatric  patients  administered  sodium  oxybate  on  a  mg/kg  basis.  A  power  model 
analysis was performed based on linear regression analyses of the simulated exposure values versus the 
mg/kg dose, with the exposure values and doses displayed on a log scale. A linear relationship between 
exposure and dose is indicated by a slope of 1.00, and a departure from dose linearity is concluded if 1.00 
is  not  contained  within  the  90%  CIs  for  the  estimated  slope.  For  Cmax1  (from  the  1st  dose  of  the  BID 
regimen) and Cmax2 (from the 2nd dose of the BID regimen), the slopes range from 1.19 to 1.24 and the 
90% CIs did not include 1.00. As the slopes were only slightly higher than 1.00, the supra-proportionality 
of Cmax may not be clinically important. For AUCinf and AUC0-24, the slope was estimated to be 1.68, and 
the 90% CIs did not include 1.00. As the slopes approached 2.00, the supra-proportionality of AUC may be 
more clinically relevant than that of Cmax. 
To further explore relationships between dose and PK, simulations were performed to predict PK parameters 
in paediatric and adult patients administered sodium oxybate on a gram/patient basis. In both children and 
adolescents,  an  increase  in  the  gram/patient  dose  (1,  3,  and  4.5g/patient)  was  associated  with  a  clear 
trend toward an increase in median tmax after the first dose (0.75, 1.00, and 1.50h, respectively), but less 
of a trend in median tmax after the second dose (0.50, 0.50, and 0.75h). The average t1/2 values were 
similar  between  children  and  adolescents  and  among  dose  levels  (1.35  to  1.41h).  Similar  results  were 
observed  in  adult  patients  administered  sodium  oxybate  on  a  gram/patient  basis  or  mg/kg  basis.  In 
addition,  within  a  mg/kg  dose  level,  the  PK  parameters  for  sodium  oxybate  were  similar  among  the  3 
populations evaluated. For example, mean Cmax (dose 2) and AUC0-24 in children were 80% to 90% of 
the respective mean values in adults, and mean Cmax (dose 2) and AUC0-24 values in adolescents were 
83% to 101% of the respective mean values in adults. 
Simulations for food effect 
To illustrate the effect of food on oxybate PK, single 4.5g fed and fasted doses in paediatric and 
adults were simulated. PK parameters were calculated using noncompartmental methods and the 
impact of food was evaluated using a mixed-effects analysis of variance. 
Regardless of prandial status, peak concentrations were higher in paediatric patients than in adults 
(Figure 3–5). The impact of food was slightly more pronounced in the adult population compared to

the paediatric population. The peak concentration decreased 25% and 33% with food in paediatrics 
and adults, respectively. The effect of food on AUC was slightly lower, with decreases of 7% and 22% in 
paediatrics and adults, respectively. 
Absorption  
Study 13-005: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised-withdrawal, multicentre study of 
the efficacy and safety of sodium oxybate with an open-label evaluation and safety extension in 
paediatric patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy  
Study  13-005  was  a  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  randomised-withdrawal,  multicentre  study  of  the 
efficacy, safety, and PK of sodium oxybate oral solution in paediatric patients between the ages of 7 and 
17 years with narcolepsy with cataplexy. The primary objectives of this study were evaluation of efficacy 
and  safety  of  sodium  oxybate  for  the  treatment  of  cataplexy  in  paediatric  patients  with  narcolepsy.  A 
secondary  objective  was  to  characterize  the  PK  of  sodium  oxybate  in  paediatric  patients  (aged  7  to  17 
years)  with  narcolepsy  with  cataplexy.  The  PK  of  sodium  oxybate  was  evaluated  in  a  subset  of  patients 
while on their stable dose. 
PK sample collection 
For patients  participating  in the PK evaluation, 2 doses of sodium oxybate were administered and blood 
samples were collected over an 8-hour period on 2 PK nights (PK Night 1 and PK Night 2). On PK Night 1 
patients received half of their stable dose, while on PK Night 2 patients were administered their full stable 
dose.  Blood  samples  were  taken  at  the  following  times  relative  to  the  first  sodium  oxybate  dose 
administered: 0 (predose), 0.75, 1.5, 2.5, and 4 hours (before the 2nd dose) to characterise the PK of the 
first sodium oxybate dose, and at 4.75 and 8 hours to provide insight into the peak and residual exposure 
associated with the second sodium oxybate dose. Sodium oxybate concentrations in the plasma samples 
were determined using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
Results 
The PK results were obtained for the PK Completer population (N=29), which comprised the 2 age groups, 
7  to  11  years  (N=11;  37.9%)  and  12  to  17  years  (N=18;  62.1%).  The  PK  Completer  population  was 
comprised  of  22  males  (75.9%)  and  7  females  (24.1%).  Other  demographic  characteristics  of  the  PK 
Completer  population  were  similar  to  the  baseline  demographics  of  the  Efficacy  and  Safety  populations. 
There were no apparent differences in sodium oxybate PK characteristics between the 2 age groups. The 
median stable daily dose in the PK population (based on PK Night 2) was 7g per day (range: 4 to 9g per 
day).  When  normalised  to  body  weight,  the  median  full  dose  was  112.4mg/kg  per  day  (range:  69.8  to 
225.8mg/kg per day). 
Sodium oxybate plasma concentration-time profiles 
Sodium oxybate plasma concentration-time profiles following administration of sodium oxybate at the full 
stable  dose  are  shown  in  Figure  2–1.  Higher  sodium  oxybate  plasma  concentrations  were  generally 
observed after the second daily dose than after the first. A similar pattern has been reported for twice-daily 
sodium oxybate dosing in adults and is likely due to the combined effects of accumulation and food effect 
(Borgen, 2004). The first daily dose of sodium oxybate was taken at least 2 h after a meal, while the second 
daily dose was taken 4 h after the first dose (i.e., at least 6 h after a meal). Food effect studies have shown 
that absorption is slower under fed conditions than under fasted conditions (Borgen, 2004). The plasma 
concentration-time profile presented on a log-linear scale (Figure 2–1, panel B) shows large variation in the 
terminal slopes, suggesting non-linear clearance, which is described in the population PK analysis.

Sodium oxybate PK parameters 
For the first daily dose on PK Night 2, the median tmax ranged from 0.75 to 2.5 hours, and the mean Cmax 
and AUC0-4h values ranged from 24.3 to 92.7μg/mL and 52.0 to 273μg/mL*h, respectively. There was no 
apparent  association  between  the  magnitude  of  the  gram  dose  of  sodium  oxybate  and  either  Cmax  and 
AUC0-4h. The absence of a relationship was most likely attributable to the wide range of body weights in 
the PK population, which resulted in a large variation in the mg/kg doses. Cmax and AUC0-4h showed no 
clear association with the gram dose of sodium oxybate, but these parameters demonstrated a clear trend 
toward increased values with increasing mg/kg doses. 
The bioavailability of Xyrem has not been investigated in this study, however the plasma concentration-
time  relationship  of  Xyrem  in  children  and  adolescents  is  considered  sufficiently  described.  The  children 
received quite different doses resulting in very wide inter-subject variability in both Cmax and AUC. The 
study  also  showed  higher  Cmax  after  the  second  nightly  dose  than  after  the  first,  and  a  clear  relation 
between mg/kg dose and Cmax and AUC. 
Distribution 
Sodium oxybate is a hydrophilic compound with an apparent volume of distribution averaging 
190-384mL/kg. At sodium oxybate concentrations ranging from 3 to 300μg/mL, less than 1% is bound to 
plasma proteins (Xyrem SmPC 2018). 
The distribution has not been described for paediatric patients, however it is known for adults, and a number 
of other PK parameters have been relevantly described, therefore it is accepted. 
Elimination 
Metabolism 
No  specific  studies  have  been  performed  to  evaluate  the  metabolism  of  sodium  oxybate  in  paediatric 
subjects.  Animal  studies  indicate  that  metabolism  is  the  major elimination  pathway  for  sodium  oxybate, 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 22/92 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
producing carbon dioxide and water via the tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle and secondarily by β-oxidation. 
The primary pathway involves a cytosolic NADP+-linked enzyme, GHB dehydrogenase, that catalyses the 
conversion of sodium oxybate to succinic semialdehyde, which is then biotransformed to succinic acid by 
the  enzyme  succinic  semialdehyde  dehydrogenase.  Succinic  acid  enters  the  Krebs  cycle  where  it  is 
metabolised  to  carbon  dioxide  and  water.  A  second  mitochondrial  oxidoreductase  enzyme,  a 
transhydrogenase,  also  catalyses  the  conversion  to  succinic  semialdehyde  in  the  presence  of  α-
ketoglutarate. An alternate pathway of biotransformation involves β-oxidation via 3,4-dihydroxybutyrate 
to Acetyl CoA, which also enters the citric acid cycle to result in the formation of carbon dioxide and water. 
No active metabolites have been identified (Xyrem SmPC 2018).  
Excretion 
No specific studies have been performed to evaluate the excretion of sodium oxybate in paediatric subjects. 
The clearance of sodium oxybate is almost entirely by biotransformation to carbon dioxide, which is then 
eliminated  by  expiration.  On  average,  less  than  5%  of  unchanged  medicinal  product  appears  in  human 
urine within 6 to 8 hours after dosing. Faecal excretion is negligible. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality assessment 
Dose  proportionality  assessments  were  based  on  within-patient  comparisons  of  the  2  PK  Nights,  where 
Cmax and AUC0-4h values were expressed as ratios between PK Night 2 (full stable dose) and PK Night 1 
(half of the stable dose). As PK Night 2 used a 2-fold higher dose, a mean ratio of 2.00 would suggest dose 
proportionality. For Cmax, the mean ratio was 1.97 and the 90% confidence interval (CI) was 1.67 to 2.31 
(Table 2–4). As the 90% CI included 2.00, the assessment suggested that Cmax was dose proportional. 
For AUC0-4h, the mean ratio was 2.53 and the 90% CI was 2.18 to 2.94. As the lower bound of the 90% 
CI was greater than 2.00, AUC0-4h was concluded to be supraproportional. Dose proportionality analyses 
by age group were also performed, and results were directionally consistent. 
Diurnal factors 
Population  PK  modelling  indicated  a  diurnal  effect  on  Vmax  (Population  PK  Report).  Due  to  this  effect, 
clearance is predicted to be lower (18% reduction in Vmax) when Xyrem is administered in the evening as 
compared to administration in the morning. Diurnal effects on PK have been previously described for other 
drugs  (Langner,  1988),  as  well  as  age  dependence  on  diurnal  changes  (Shiga,  1993).  However,  the 
previously described mechanisms and profiles seem to not explain the diurnal variation of the PK of Xyrem. 
At present, no other mechanistic explanation is available. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 23/92 
 
  
  
 
 
 
It is considered sufficiently described that there is not dose proportionality for AUC, with both the above 
calculation  and  the  population  PK  model  showing  non-proportionality.  With  regard  to  Cmax  the  above 
calculation shows dose proportionality but the population PK model shows a lack of dose proportionality. 
The Applicant is requested to discuss the discrepancy regarding dose-proportionality for Cmax with regard 
to results obtained in the pop PK model and the paediatric study, respectively (OC).  
With regard to time dependencies, a diurnal variation in clearance has been found, however, Xyrem is only 
intended to be used at night-time, therefore it is not considered problematic. 
Special populations 
Age 
A  covariate  analysis,  presented  in  the  Population  PK  Report,  found  age  categories  to  be  statistically 
significant covariates on central VC; however, there were no clinically meaningful differences in simulated 
PK profiles among age categories when Xyrem was administered at the same mg/kg doses. Children (7-11 
years)  have  a  12%  reduction  in  volume  relative  to  adults,  and  adolescents  (12-17  years)  have  a  22% 
increase in volume relative to adults. Differences in body composition could possibly explain the effect of 
age category (paediatrics vs adolescent) on weight-adjusted VC. 
Simulations indicate that paediatric and adult subjects receiving the same mg/kg dose have similar plasma 
concentration-time profiles (Population PK Report). 
Body weight 
Based on covariate analysis (Population PK Report) body weight significantly affects oxybate PK (VC and 
Vmax) and accounts for most of the observed differences in PK between adult and paediatric subjects when 
Xyrem is administered on a gram/subject basis. 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment was not evaluated in the paediatric studies. 
Sodium oxybate undergoes significant presystemic (hepatic first-pass) metabolism. After a single oral dose 
of 25 mg/kg, AUC values were double in cirrhotic patients, with apparent oral clearance reduced from 9.1 
in healthy adults to 4.5 and 4.1 mL/min/kg in Class A (without ascites) and Class C (with ascites) patients, 
respectively. Elimination t1/2 was significantly longer in Class C and Class A patients than in control subjects 
(mean t1/2 of 59 and 32 versus 22 minutes). The starting dose should be halved in all patients with hepatic 
impairment, and response to dose increments monitored closely (Xyrem SmPC 2018). 
Race 
The effect of race on metabolism of sodium oxybate has not been evaluated. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted in paediatric subjects. 
It is accepted that no interaction studies have been performed in paediatric patients, as the interactions 
are not thought to differ to a clinically relevant degree between adult and paediatric patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 24/92 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Studies in vitro with pooled human liver microsomes indicate that sodium oxybate does not significantly 
inhibit the activities of the human isoenzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A up 
to the concentration of 3mMol (378μg/mL). These levels are considerably higher than levels achieved with 
therapeutic doses (Xyrem SmPC 2018). 
1.1.1.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Sodium oxybate is an endogenous 4-carbon fatty acid that is thought to act as a neurotransmitter in the 
regulation of sleep cycles, blood flow, emotion, and memory. Its actions are thought to be mediated through 
brain receptors specific for GHB as well as through binding to GABA-B receptors. At low doses, the drug 
inhibits presynaptic dopamine release, while at high doses, dopamine release may be stimulated.  
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
The primary neuropharmacological effects of sodium oxybate include CNS depression, increases in brain 
dopamine, characteristic  electroencephalographic changes, and  depression of cerebral  glucose utilisation 
(Kuschinsky et al, 1985; Maitre, 1997). 
The precise mechanism by which sodium oxybate produces an effect is unknown; however, sodium oxybate 
is thought to act by promoting slow (delta) wave sleep and consolidating nighttime sleep. Sodium oxybate 
administered  before  nocturnal  sleep  increases  Stages  3  and  4  sleep  and  increases  sleep  latency,  whilst 
reducing the frequency of sleep onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (SOREMPs). Other mechanisms, 
which have yet to be elucidated, may also be involved. 
1.1.2.  PK/PD modelling 
No PK/PD modelling has been submitted 
Since  the  PD  of  Xyrem  has  not  been  fully  elucidated,  it  is  accepted  that  no  PK/PD  modelling  has  been 
performed. 
Xyrem dose selection 
Population modelling of adolescent, children over 7 years old and adults support the proposed weight and 
age-based dosing scheme. Body weight was shown to significantly affect oxybate PK (Vmax and VC) and 
accounts for most of the observed differences in PK between adult and paediatric subjects when Xyrem is 
administered on a gram/subject basis. In addition to body weight, age expressed as a categorical variable 
(paediatric [7-17 years], adult [≥18 years], child [7-11 years], adolescent [12-17 years]) was a significant 
covariate on VC, with children having a 12% reduction in volume and adolescents having a 22% increase 
in volume. Additionally, the assessment of food effect demonstrated that the administration of Xyrem after 
a meal significantly affects the rate of oxybate absorption (68% reduction in Ka) and has a small impact 
on the extent of absorption.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has investigated the PK of Xyrem in 29 paediatric patients during two separate sessions with 
blood sampling from 0 hours until 8 hours after first Xyrem dose. The PK is described both by the PK 
parameters obtained in the study and by a population PK model with input from adult PK. The population 
PK model found that the largest factor for the PK parameters was weight, with age group and time of day 
for the administration being less important factors.  
Simulations for Xyrem administrated by weight-based mg/kg posology showed no clinically relevant 
different in plasma concentration profiles between children below 12 years, above 12 years or adults. 
Evidence of non-liniarity with regard to both Cmax and clearance, and evidence of a food effect was found. 
Simulations did not include the highest proposed mg/kg dose in children (OC). The highest simulated 
mg/kg dose showed high concentrations long into the next day with possible safety issues regarding 
neurodevelopment, intoxication and addiction (OC).  
With regard to paediatric data in the PK study, no bioavailability was investigated, a Cmax for the first dose 
ranged from 24.3 to 92.7 µg/mL, tmax between 0.75 and 2.5 hours, and C at 4.75h (0.75 hours after 
second dose) showed higher values than Cmax after the first dose. Distribution was not investigated in the 
study but is known to be 190-384mL/kg I adults. Elimination occurs mainly via metabolism with less than 
5% excreted in the urine. Dose proportionality was found for Cmax but not for AUC, there was discrepancy 
between dose proportionality for Cmax between the Pop-PK model and the data from 13-005 (OC).  
Renal impairment is not considered to affect elimination of Xyrem because of near complete metabolism, 
but hepatic impairment is known to reduce clearance in adults. The effect of race on the metabolism of 
Xyrem has not been evaluated. No pharmacokinetic interaction studies in paediatric subjects have been 
performed, but a number of interactions known or suspected for adults are not thought to differ to a 
clinically relevant degree in children. CYP inhibition studies in liver microsomes show no inhibition of 
enzymes with doses of Xyrem higher than normally achieved in clinical use.  
The mechanism of action is thought to be through GABA-B and GHB receptors, with a primary 
pharmacology that is unknown, but thought to be, at least partly, through promotion of delta wave sleep. 
Other pharmacodynamics effects are CNS depression, increases in brain dopamine etc. 
Paediatric Xyrem posology is proposed to be based on weight intervals, which is endorsed, however 
paediatric patients can receive very high mg/kg doses with the proposed posology. The MAH has revised 
the recommended weight-category based dose regimen to provide optimal risk mitigation to pediatric 
patients.

Methods 
All patients were evaluated for eligibility during the Screening Period (up to 30 days).  
Following screening, patients who were sodium oxybate-naïve entered the open-label Dose-Titration Period 
of  up  to  10  weeks.  Once  the  sodium  oxybate  dose  had  been  optimised  per  the  Investigator’s  judgment 
(defined as the dose at which participants had an improvement in the frequency of cataplexy attacks and 
had  achieved  a  state  of  cataplexy  stability  [frequency  and  severity]  with  no  further  dose  adjustment 
needed),  these  patients  entered  the  open-label  Stable-Dose  Period  on  that  dose.  Following  screening, 
patients who were on sodium oxybate at study entry remained on their stable dose and regimen (i.e., 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 27/92 
 
  
  
 
equally divided doses or 2 unequally divided doses of sodium oxybate) and entered the Stable-Dose Period 
for 3 weeks.  
If  patient  doses  remained  stable  during  this  period  with  no  clinically  significant  worsening  in  narcolepsy 
symptoms  or  clinically  significant  adverse  events  due  to  sodium  oxybate,  the  patient  entered  into  the 
Double-Blind Treatment Period. Patients entering the Double-Blind Treatment Period prior to Amendment 
4 becoming effective were randomised 1:1 with a dynamic randomisation algorithm to receive one of the 
following 2 treatments during the 2-week Double-Blind Treatment Period (randomised-withdrawal): 
Sodium oxybate: Active sodium oxybate was continued as a double-blind treatment at the stable dose 
taken and regimen used in the prior 2 weeks. 
Placebo: Placebo was initiated as a double-blind treatment at a volume and regimen equivalent to the 
sodium oxybate dose taken in the prior 2 weeks. 
Following  the  Double-Blind  Treatment  Period  (2  weeks),  this  study  also  included  an  Open-Label  Safety 
extension allowing patients to continue sodium oxybate treatment for up to 1 year with a PK evaluation in 
a subset of patients. 
On 24 Feb 2016, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for this study reviewed the results from a 
pre-planned  interim  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  results  based  on  35  patients  having  completed  or 
discontinued  from  the  Double-Blind  Treatment  Period  of  the  protocol.  The  results  of  this  analysis 
demonstrated positive efficacy based on the primary endpoint, the change in weekly number of cataplexy 
attacks  from  the  last  2  weeks  of  the  Stable-Dose  Period  to  the  2  weeks  of  the  Double-Blind  Treatment 
Period  at  a  significance  level  of  p<0.005.  Since  this  met  the  prespecified  criterion  for  success  (i.e., 
p<0.005), the DSMB recommended that the placebo treatment in the Double-Blind Treatment Period of the 
trial be stopped. The DSMB further recommended that the open-label portion of the study be continued. 
These changes were implemented in Protocol Amendment 4 (05 Apr 2016).  
After Amendment 5 patients were offered and extra up to 2 years of Open-label period. 
Primary endpoint: change in weekly number of cataplexy attacks.  
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 28/92 
 
  
  
 
Key secondary endpoint: assessments of the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIc) (Guy, 1976) 
for cataplexy severity and the change in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale for Children and Adolescents (ESS 
[CHAD]) score (Johns, 1991).  
Other secondary endpoints: CGIc for narcolepsy overall and the change in quality of life (QoL; short 
form-10 Health Survey for Children [SF-10] physical and psychosocial summary score) (Saris-Baglama, 
2007). Exploratory endpoints included the change in the percentage of school days missed and the 
Patient Global Impression of change (PGIc) (Hurst, 2004) for narcolepsy overall.  
The study design was the same as that used in the adult study OMC-SXB-21. A key feature of the this 
randomised-withdrawal design is that the maximum time any paediatric patient was exposed to placebo 
was only 2 weeks, a significant advantage for this vulnerable patient population, The 2 week duration is 
sufficient to determine efficacy, as demonstrated in Study OMC-SXB-21 (see Section 4.6). Given this was 
an enriched population, a dynamic randomisation algorithm was used to assign treatments 1:1 for the 
double-blind treatment period (Pocock and Simon, 1975) which ensured that bias was minimised in this 
study. 
Study participants 
Paediatric patients between the ages of 7 and 17 years who were diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy, 
being treated with sodium oxybate or who were sodium oxybate-naïve, were eligible to enter the study. 
Participants taking sodium oxybate had to be taking a stable dose (≤9g per night) for at least 2 months 
before screening and had reported clinical improvement of cataplexy. 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria 
Male or female patients between the ages of 7 and 17 years of age were required to have primary diagnosis 
of narcolepsy with cataplexy that met International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD)-2 or ICSD-3 
criteria.  Patients  had  to  be  positive  for  the  human  leukocyte  antigen  DQB1:0602  haplotype  or  have 
cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin level ≤110pg/mL. Patients also must have had a history of having at least 
14 cataplexy  attacks  in  a  typical  2-week  period  and  clinically  significant  symptoms  of  EDS  prior  to  any 
narcolepsy treatment.  
Patients were excluded from the study if previously treated with sodium oxybate and discontinued sodium 
oxybate treatment because of lack of efficacy and/or tolerability issues. Narcolepsy could not have been 
secondary to another medical condition (e.g., CNS injury or lesion). Patients could not have specific safety 
restrictions  as  listed  in  the  protocol  (e.g.,  succinic  semi-aldehyde  dehydrogenase  deficiency  [SSADH], 
sleep-disordered breathing, psychological disorders, oxygen saturation level <95% for at least 5 minutes 
on  room  air,  past  or  current  major  thought  disorder,  e.g.,  schizophrenia,  paranoia,  mania,  etc.,  current 
suicidal risk as determined from history or Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS] or history of 
suicide attempt and clinically significant depression independent of narcolepsy symptoms).  
Disposition of Subjects 
A  total  of  136  subjects  provided  informed  consent/assent  and  were  screened  for  study  participation.  Of 
these, 106 subjects were enrolled: 74 subjects were Xyrem naïve and 32 subjects were on Xyrem at study 
entry.  (Xyrem  naïve  subjects  who  entered  the  study  underwent  dose  titration  based  on  body  weight 
category, as prescribed in the protocol, during the Dose Titration Period. This dose initiation and titration

method was successful, with > 90% of subjects achieving a tolerable and efficacious dose and entering the 
Stable Dose Period. Subjects on Xyrem at study entry immediately entered the Stable Dose Period. After 
completing the Stable Dose Period, eligible subjects entered the Double-blind Treatment Period followed by 
the Open-label Safety Period.) 
At the time of the data cut off on 10 February 2017, 46 subjects had completed the study, and 43 subjects 
were continuing treatment in the Open-label Safety Period. Overall, as of 10 February 2017, a total of 17 
subjects discontinued from the study during various study periods (7 subjects discontinued from the Dose 
Titration  Period;  3  subjects  discontinued  from  the  Stable  Dose  Period;  1  subject  discontinued  from  the 
Double-blind Treatment Period; 6 subjects discontinued from the Open-label Safety Period). Reasons for 
discontinuation  were:  Adverse  events:  5  subjects;  Protocol  deviation:  2  subjects;  Treatment 
noncompliance: 2 subjects ; Other: 6 subjects

Xyrem-naïve  subjects  were  titrated  on  Xyrem  over  a  period  of  up  to  10  weeks.  Xyrem  doses  were 
administered in 2 equally divided doses 2.5 to 4 hours apart. Dose initiation and titration was based on the 
subject’s weight as described in Table 2. Dose adjustment during the Dose Titration Period proceeded at a 
rate of ≤ 1 g/night/week for subjects < 45 kg, and ≤ 1.5 g/night/week for subjects ≥ 45 kg, to a dose level 
no higher than the maximum dose described in Table 2. Once the Investigator was satisfied that the Xyrem 
dose had been optimized, the subject could enter the 2-week Stable Dose Period. 
Selection of Doses in the Study 
In the studies reported in the literature, Xyrem doses used in children and adolescents were generally lower 
than the mean dose reported in adults (7.5 g/night). In one of these published studies, children with pre-
pubertal onset of narcolepsy took a lower maximal Xyrem dose than those with peri- or post-pubertal onset 
(Aran, 2010). 
Data  from  the  Central  Pharmacy  that  dispensed  Xyrem  in  the  US  also  indicated  that  most  children  took 
lower doses than adults, as would be expected if there were no great differences in metabolism between 
children and adults, and if effective doses were generally based on a mg/kg dose. 
Objectives 
Primary Objectives 
• Evaluate the efficacy of Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral solution in the treatment of cataplexy in paediatric 
subjects with narcolepsy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021

• Evaluate the safety of Xyrem in the treatment of cataplexy in paediatric subjects with narcolepsy for up 
to 1 year. 
Secondary Objectives 
•  Evaluate  the  efficacy  of  Xyrem  in  the  treatment  of  EDS  in  paediatric  subjects  with  narcolepsy  with 
cataplexy. 
• Characterize the PK of Xyrem in paediatric subjects (ages 7 to 17 years) with narcolepsy with cataplexy. 
• Evaluate the safety of titrating Xyrem in paediatric subjects to an effective and tolerable dose. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Appropriateness of Measurements 
The primary efficacy endpoint measure (change in weekly number of cataplexy attacks), is similar to the 
measure used in a prior study to establish efficacy in adults. Cataplexy frequency data was collected daily 
in  a  cataplexy  frequency  diary.  Both  the  Cataplexy  Frequency  Diary  and  the  ESS  (CHAD)  have  been 
evaluated for their face and content validity in children with narcolepsy (Mapi Study JZ13770A). The ESS 
(CHAD) was further validated in in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age (Janssen, 2017). The CGIc has been 
used  extensively  in  clinical  trials.  The  parameters  selected  to  assess  the  safety  of  the  study  drug  are 
appropriate since they are routinely used to assess the safety profile of drugs in clinical studies and pertinent 
to  known  risks  of  Xyrem.  The  C-SSRS,  CDI  2:SR[S],  and  MASC-10  have  been  validated  for  use  in  the 
paediatric population. 
Sample size 
Sodium  oxybate  was  initially  granted  Orphan  Drug  Designation  (ODD)  for  the  treatment  of  narcolepsy 
(EU/3/02/131) on 3 February 2003. Although this was subsequently withdrawn in January 2010 on request 
of the sponsor, the rarity of the condition fulfils the criteria for an ODD, as the prevalence of Narcolepsy in 
the  EU  is  47  individuals/100,000  persons  (Ohayon  et  al,  2002).  Consequently,  the  sample  size  for  any 
paediatric studies will be small due to limited pool of potential participants. 
The initially proposed sample size was not reached due to the scheduled interim analysis that finally lead 
to the active treatment being given to all participants. 
Randomisation 
The  randomised  clinical  trial  is  the  mainstay  of  clinical  studies,  representing  the  gold  standard  for  the 
assessment of the effect of any therapeutic intervention. However, for paediatric studies particularly where 
the population size is small, alternative designs, such as the double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised-
withdrawal  design  can  be  more  appropriate,  to  ensure  the  feasibility  of  the  trial  and  the  validity  of  the 
results. 
Placebo was the only control group used in the study, as there are no medications registered in EU for the 
treatment  of  cataplexy  in  paediatric  patients.  The  main  feature  of  this  randomised-withdrawal  design  is 
that the maximum time any paediatric patient was exposed to placebo was 2 weeks, a significant advantage 
for this vulnerable patient population, where the medication treats symptoms that can impact narcolepsy 
Assessment report

patients’ ability to function. The 2-week duration is sufficient to determine efficacy, as was demonstrated 
in Study OMC-SXB-21, a double-blind placebo controlled randomised-withdrawal study of Xyrem in adult 
narcolepsy patients. 
In order to minimise bias in this study, a dynamic randomisation algorithm was used to assign treatments 
1:1 for the double-blind treatment period. This involved balancing the treatment groups in the Double-blind 
Treatment Period for age group (7–11 years and 12–17 years), previous sodium oxybate treatment (taking 
sodium oxybate at study entry and sodium oxybate-naive), and location (USA and EU). 
Blinding (masking) 
Sodium  oxybate  and  placebo  oral  solutions  were  matched  in  volume,  flavour  and  appearance  to  ensure 
adequate blinding. 
The lead INC biostatistician and the blinded programming team remained blinded throughout study conduct 
until the formal database snapshot was performed and unblinded for the primary analysis. The Jazz study 
team,  with  the  exception  of  the  Jazz  clinical  trial  material  supply  group,  also  remained  blinded  until  the 
formal  database  snapshot  was  performed  and  unblinded.  No  emergency  unblinding  occurred.  Jazz  Drug 
Safety had code break capability for unblinding for regulatory reporting, however none occurred. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical and Analytical Plans 
The  primary  analysis  of  safety,  efficacy  and  PK  occurred  after  all  randomized  subjects  discontinued  or 
completed the Double-blind Treatment Period. Database snapshot included data through the cutoff date of 
10 February 2017. An additional final analysis will be performed after database lock at the completion of 
the study and included in the final CSR. 
Study Populations 
The Safety Population consisted of all subjects who were dispensed study drug. This population was used 
for  tables  and  listings  of  safety  data.  This  population  was  also  used  to  summarize  efficacy  data  as 
appropriate. 
The Safety Population was also categorized by period and by whether the subject took study drug within 
the different study periods. 
The PK Half-Dose Population consisted of all subjects who had any PK data for PK Night 1 when subjects 
received one half of their usual stable dose. This population was used for listings and descriptive statistics 
of the half-dose PK data. 
The PK Full-Dose Population consisted of all subjects who had any PK data for PK Night 2 when subjects 
received their usual stable dose. This population was used for listings and descriptive statistics of the full-
dose PK data. 
The  PK  Completer  Population  consisted  of  all  subjects  who  had  PK  data  for  both  PK  nights.  This 
population was used for evaluating within subject dose proportionality. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 32/92 
 
  
  
The Efficacy Population consisted of all subjects who were randomized to Xyrem or Xyrem Placebo and 
who completed at least 5 days of dosing in the Double-blind Treatment Period. This population was used 
as the main analysis population for tables of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The Randomized Population consisted of all subjects who were randomized to Xyrem or Xyrem Placebo 
for the Double-blind Treatment Period of the study. This population was used to summarize demographics 
and baseline characteristics. 
The Per Protocol (PP) Population consisted of subjects from the Efficacy Population where subjects with 
major deviations were assessed, flagged and excluded from this analysis population. All deviations were 
reviewed and assessed prior to the data snapshot. The final list of protocol deviations was determined and 
approved prior to the database snapshot for the primary analysis. 
Interim Analysis 
A pre-planned interim analysis was conducted after 35 patients completed or discontinued early from the 
Double-Blind Treatment Period. The interim analysis was performed by a statistician not directly involved 
with the design and analysis of the study. 
For  stopping  the  study  early  because  of  treatment  success,  so  that  fewer  patients  would  be  exposed  to 
‘placebo, the O’Brien-Fleming approach (O’Brien, 1979) was used with the primary efficacy endpoint. This 
endpoint was tested at a significance level of 0.005 at the interim analysis. If statistical significance was 
shown,  the  DSMB  could  recommend  stopping  the  study  considering  the  overall  study  objectives  and 
patient’s safety. If the study was not stopped, to maintain an overall alpha of 0.05, the final analysis was 
conducted at a significance level of 0.048, based on one prior look at the data. 
For the later analyses (based on the data cut-off for this report), a tiered statistical testing approach was 
implemented to control the Type 1 family-wise error rate at the 0.05 significance level with all tests being 
2-sided for testing of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. If sodium oxybate was significantly 
better than placebo, then testing continued with the next tier. The endpoints were as follows: 
Primary endpoint (Tier 1): 
Change in weekly number of cataplexy attacks from the last 2 weeks of the Stable-Dose Period to the 2 
weeks of the Double-Blind Treatment Period. 
Key secondary endpoints (Tiers 2 and 3): 
CGIc  for  cataplexy  severity  from  the  end  of  the  Stable-Dose  Period  to  the  end  of  the  Double-Blind 
Treatment Period. 
Change  in  the  ESS  (CHAD)  score  from  the  end  of  the  Stable-Dose  Period  to  the  end  of  Double-Blind 
Treatment Period. 
Other secondary endpoints (Tiers 4 and 5): 
CGIc  for  narcolepsy  overall  from  the  end  of  the  Stable-Dose  Period  to  the  end  of  the  Double-Blind 
Treatment Period. 
Change  in  QoL  (SF-10  physical  and  psychosocial  summary  scores)  from  the  end  of  the  Stable-Dose 
Period to the end of the Double-Blind Treatment Period. 
Exploratory endpoints: 
Change in percentage of school days missed from the last 2 weeks of the Stable-Dose Period to the 2 
weeks of the Double-Blind Treatment Period. 
 PGIc  for  narcolepsy  overall  from  the  end  of  the  Stable-Dose  Period  to  the  end  of  the  Double-Blind 
Treatment Period.

Results 
Participant flow 
Recruitment 
A  total  of  136  subjects  provided  informed  consent/assent  and  were  screened  for  study  participation.  Of 
these, 106 subjects were enrolled: 74 subjects were Xyrem naïve and 32 subjects were on Xyrem at study 
entry.  (Xyrem  naïve  subjects  who  entered  the  study  underwent  dose  titration  based  on  body  weight 
category, as prescribed in the protocol, during the Dose Titration Period. Thirty patients failed to meet one 
or more inclusion criteria and/or fulfilled one or more exclusion criteria. The efficacy population included 63 
patients.  One  of  the  63  patient  terminated  early  because  of  a  score  of  72  at  Visit  3  according  to  the 
Children’s  Depression  Inventory  2nd  Edition  Self-Report  Short  Version  (CDI:2  SR[S]  T)  (Kovacs,  1992)

Open-Label Safety Period. 
Conduct of the study 
Data Quality Assurance 
Steps  to  assure  the  accuracy  and  reliability  of  data  included  the  selection  of  qualified  Investigators  and 
appropriate study sites, review of protocol procedures with the Investigator and associated personnel prior 
to the study, and periodic monitoring visits by Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee. Data were reviewed

for  accuracy  and  completeness  by  Jazz  Pharmaceuticals  or  its  representatives  during  and  after  onsite 
monitoring visits, and any discrepancies were resolved with the Investigator or designees as appropriate. 
Audits were performed by Jazz Pharmaceuticals that operate independently of the trial monitors. The audits 
within a clinical program were aimed at trial documentation, investigator sites and clinical trial reports. The 
audit  program,  together  with  Jazz  Pharmaceutical’s  internal  quality  control  procedures,  provides 
reassurance that trial conclusions were based on valid procedures for data management and analysis, and 
that the clinical trial program was carried out in accordance with GCP guidelines. In this regard, 5 individual 
site audits, as well as routine vendor audits were conducted during the course of the study. 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
The DSMB reviewed the safety data on a regular basis and primary efficacy endpoint data from the Interim 
Analysis. Pharmacokinetic data were also reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Baseline characteristics were collected at study entry, prior to administration of study drug. 
Demography 
Across  study  populations,  the  median  age  was  12  years  (range:  7  to  16).  Overall,  more  subjects  were 
enrolled in the 12 to 17 year age group (68/106 subjects, 64.2%) than in the younger 7 to 11 year age 
group (38/106 subjects, 35.8%). Most subjects were male (63/106 subjects, 59.4%) and White (73/106 
subjects, 68.9%) (Table 8). Baseline demographic characteristics were well balanced between treatment 
groups in the Efficacy population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021

Baseline Disease Characteristics 
In the Safety population, 74 subjects who were Xyrem naïve entered the study, and 32 subjects were on 
Xyrem at study entry (Table 9). Of the subjects with prior Xyrem exposure, median (min, max) previous 
Xyrem exposure was 12.00 (2.0, 52.0) months. Most subjects administered Xyrem in 2 equal doses nightly; 
4/32 subjects (12.5%) administered Xyrem in unequal doses nightly. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021

The  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  the  Efficacy population  were  similar  across  treatment  groups.  On 
average, subjects enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with narcolepsy for 1.5 to 2 years (Table 10). 
Prior  to  receiving  narcolepsy  treatment,  all  subjects  reported  experiencing  cataplexy  and  EDS.  A  large 
proportion  of  subjects  also  reported  experiencing  disrupted  night-time  sleep  (from  78.1%  to  96.6%  of 
subjects).  Over  half  of  the  enrolled  population  reported  experiencing  hypnagogic  and  /  or  hypnopompic 
hallucinations, and less than half reported sleep paralysis.

Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Prior Medications 
Prior medications were used by approximately half of subjects in the Safety Population. The most frequently 
used  prior  medications  were  centrally  acting  sympathomimetics  (ie,  including  stimulants,  modafinil  and 
armodafinil,  obetrol  and  amphetamines;  53/106  subjects,  50.0%)  In  general,  use  of  centrally  acting 
sympathomimetics was similar across subgroups, with subjects on Xyrem at study entry reporting a lower 
use  frequency  compared  with  Xyrem  naïve  subjects  (14/32  subjects,  43.8%  vs  39/74  subjects,  52.7%, 
respectively). 
Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications were taken by approximately 60 to 70% of the safety population, regardless of 
treatment  period,  and  centrally  acting  sympathomimetics  (ie,  including  stimulants,  modafinil  and 
armodafinil,  methylphenidate  and  amphetamines)  were  the  most  frequently  reported  concomitant 
medication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 39/92 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Stimulants 
Centrally  acting  sympathomimetics  (ie,  including  stimulants,  modafinil  and  armodafinil,  obetrol  and 
amphetamines) for the treatment of EDS were permitted during the study, and use was monitored via an 
electronic Simulant Dosing Diary. 
During the Stable Dose Period, the proportion of subjects on stimulants was similar for subjects aged 7 to 
11 years and subjects aged 12 to 17 years (18/36 subjects, 51.4%, and 37/63 subjects, 58.7%), but was 
greater for Xyrem naïve subjects compared with subjects on Xyrem at study entry (41/67 subjects, 62.1%, 
and 14/32 subjects, 43.8%, respectively).  
Similarly,  during  the  Double-blind  Treatment  Period,  subjects  who  were  prescribed  stimulants  were  well 
balanced  across  treatment  groups  (18/32  subjects,  56.3%  were  randomized  to  receive  Placebo;  17/31 
subjects,  54.8%  were  randomized  to  receive  Xyrem;  and  18/33  subjects,  56.3%  received  open-label 
Xyrem). 
The proportion of subjects taking stimulants was consistent across both the Stable Dose and Double-blind 
Treatment Periods (Table 11). 
Numbers analysed 
The  Safety  population  consisted  of  all  106  subjects  who  were  dispensed  study  drug  (74  subjects  were 
Xyrem naïve and 32 subjects were on Xyrem at study entry; 38 subjects were in the younger 7 to 11 year 
age  group  and  68  subjects  were  in  the  12  to  17  year  age  group).  The  Safety  population  was  further 
subdivided into the number of subjects who were dispensed and took drug in each of the 4 study periods. 
During the Dose Titration Period, 2 subjects were dispensed study drug, but did not take study drug; both 
subjects were discontinued on the first day of study. In total, there were 104 subjects who took study drug 
in the Safety Population. 
The  final  Efficacy  population  consisted  of  subjects  randomized  to  Xyrem  (31  subjects)  or  Placebo  (32 
subjects) who completed at least 5 days of dosing in the Double-blind Treatment Period. No subjects were 
excluded from the Efficacy population due to major deviations; therefore, the Per Protocol population and 
the Efficacy population were equivalent at the time of the 10 February 2017 data cut date. The Randomized 
Population consisted of all subjects who were randomized to either Xyrem or Xyrem Placebo for the Double-
blind Treatment Period, and was equivalent to the Efficacy population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 40/92 
 
  
  
 
 
A total of 29 subjects participated in PK assessments and comprised the PK Population (including 11 subjects 
aged 7 to 11 years and 18 subjects aged 12 to 17 years). All subjects completed both Night 1 and Night 2 
of the PK assessments, and therefore the PK Half-dose population, the PK Full-dose population, and the PK 
Completers population were equivalent, and are reflected in this report as the PK population. 
The analysis populations are summarized in Table 7. A listing of the subjects included in each of the data 
analysis sets is provided in Listing. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Compliance: 
During the Double-blind  Treatment Period, mean (SD) percent  compliance rate was similar between the 
randomized treatment groups, (93.73% [7.836] for subjects randomized to Placebo, 92.81% [10.653] for 
subjects randomized to Xyrem).  
Exposure: 
Overall,  the  mean  (SD)  Xyrem  dose  dispensed  during  the  Stable  Dose  Period,  which  represents  the 
efficacious and tolerable dose, was 6.636 (1.6281) g/night. The overall mean Xyrem dose ranged from 3.0 
to 9.0 g/night. When measured in a mg/kg basis, the mean (SD) dose of Xyrem dispensed was 118.679 
(43.6711) mg/kg/night, and ranged from 46.51 to 304.88 mg/kg/night. 
Efficacy Results 
Final comparative efficacy analyses were performed including all randomized subjects who completed or 
discontinued the Double-Blind Treatment Period. Based on the planned hierarchical testing strategy, each 
of the primary and key secondary endpoints were met. Results were consistent with the pre-planned interim 
analysis, in which the primary efficacy endpoint was met. 
Baseline  values  for  comparative  efficacy  assessments  were  collected  during  the  Stable  Dose  Period. 
Specifically for endpoints of cataplexy frequency and school attendance, baseline values were calculated 
based on the diaries during the last 2 weeks of the Stable Dose Period. For the other efficacy endpoints 
(ESS [CHAD] and SF-10), baseline values were defined as the End of Stable Dose value. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 41/92 
 
  
  
 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted on all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints using the Per Protocol 
population. Since the Per Protocol population is identical to the Efficacy population, no differences in these 
analyses were observed. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint – Change in Weekly Number of Cataplexy Attacks 
During the Double-blind Treatment Period, the median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline (the last 2 weeks of 
the Stable Dose Period) in the weekly number of cataplexy attacks was 12.71 (3.44, 19.77) for subjects 
randomized to Placebo and 0.27 (-1.00, 2.50) for subjects randomized to Xyrem. The comparison of the 
rank change from baseline between treatments was statistically significant (p < 0.0001) when analyzed by 
ANCOVA modeling containing rank baseline cataplexy and treatment group. Subjects randomized to Placebo 
had, on average, greater numbers of weekly cataplexy attacks at baseline compared to subjects randomized 
to Xyrem, although median (Q1, Q3) values were similar. To account for this potential imbalance, baseline 
weekly cataplexy was included in the ANCOVA model. 
When  subgroup  analyses  by  age  group  were  conducted  for  the  primary  endpoint,  similar  results  were 
observed. During the Double-blind Treatment Period, among subjects aged 7 to 11 years, the median (Q1, 
Q3) change from baseline in the weekly number of cataplexy attacks was 18.32 (7.58, 35.75) for subjects 
randomized to Placebo and 0.13 (-1.15, 2.05) for subjects randomized to Xyrem (p = 0.0001). During the 
Double-blind Treatment Period, among subjects aged 12 to 17 years, the median (Q1, Q3) change from 
baseline  in  the  weekly  number  of  cataplexy  attacks  was  9.39  (1.08,  16.12)  for  subjects  randomized  to 
Placebo and 0.58 (-0.88, 2.58) for subjects randomized to Xyrem (p = 0.0044) (Table 20).

Key Secondary Endpoints 
CGIc for Cataplexy Severity 
Results of the CGIc for cataplexy severity showed that subjects randomized to receive Placebo during the 
Double-blind Treatment Period of the study experienced a worsening of cataplexy severity compared with 
subjects randomized to continue receiving Xyrem. 
The mean (SD) change in CGIc score for cataplexy severity was significantly worse for subjects randomized 
to  Placebo  (-1.5  [1.19])  than  for  subjects  randomized  to  Xyrem  (-0.4  [1.12])  (p  =  0.0006)  (Table  21). 
Exploratory analyses showed the percentage of subjects with worsening CGIc scores for cataplexy severity 
(defined as scores of ‘Much Worse’ or ‘Very Much Worse’) was significantly higher for subjects receiving 
Placebo (65.6%) than for subjects receiving Xyrem (17.2%) (p = 0.0001).

Change in ESS (CHAD) Score 
Paediatric  subjects  on  stable  doses  of  Xyrem  who  received  Placebo  during  the  Double-blind  Treatment 
Period recorded a significant increase in ESS (CHAD) score compared with subjects who continued to receive 
Xyrem treatment (Table 22).

Double-blind Treatment Period of the study experienced a worsening of narcolepsy symptoms compared 
with subjects randomized to continue receiving Xyrem. 
Change in Quality of Life (SF-10) 
In  this  study,  no  statistically  significant  difference  in  the  changes  from  baseline  in  SF-10  physical  or 
psychosocial summary scores was observed between subjects randomized to receive Placebo and subjects 
randomized to Xyrem during the Double-blind Treatment Period of the study.

PGIc for Narcolepsy Overall 
Results  of  PGIc  for  narcolepsy  overall  showed  that  subjects  randomized  to  receive  Placebo  during  the 
Double-blind Treatment Period of the study experienced a worsening of narcolepsy symptoms compared 
with subjects randomized to continue receiving Xyrem.

Long-term Effectiveness 
For long-term measures of efficacy, the weekly number of cataplexy attacks, ESS (CHAD)score, and SF-10 
Summary scores were also calculated for the Open-label Treatment Period (which included data through 
52 weeks on study). 
• For the weekly number of cataplexy attacks, the baseline value was the value calculated from the last 2 
weeks of the Stable Dose Period 
• For ESS (CHAD) and SF-10 Summary scores, baseline values were the values collected at Visit 3 (End of 
Stable Dose Period / Start of Double-blind Treatment Period). 
Weekly Number of Cataplexy Attacks 
Overall, the median change from baseline in the weekly number of cataplexy attacks remained fairly stable 
throughout  the  duration  of  the  Open-label  Safety  Period  (ie,  up  to  52  weeks,  Figure  8).  Fewer  than  20 
subjects had cataplexy recorded starting from Week 44, and fewer than 10 subjects had recorded cataplexy 
from  Week  48  onwards.  Despite  the  reduction  in  the  number  of  observations,  the  median  change  from 
baseline did not exceed 4 attacks per week.

Table 1.  Summary of Efficacy for trial Study 13-005 
Title: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised-withdrawal, multicentre study of the efficacy, 
safety, and PK of sodium oxybate oral solution in paediatric patients between the ages of 7 and 17 
years with narcolepsy with cataplexy. 
Study identifier 
Study 13-005  
Design 
A  double-blind  placebo-controlled  trial  after  stable  oxybate  dose  run-in  period 
until amendment 4; afterwards An open-label oxybate treatment. 
In  detail:  following  screening,  patients  entered  a  Stable-Dose  Period  (either  a 
newly  established  dose  for  sodium  oxybate  naïve  patients  or,  for  patients  on 
sodium oxybate at study entry, their established dose). If patient doses remained 
stable  during  this  period  with  no  clinically  significant  worsening  in  narcolepsy 
symptoms  or  clinically  significant  adverse  events  due  to  sodium  oxybate,  the 
patient  entered  into  the  Double-Blind  Treatment  Period.  Patients  entering  the 
Double-Blind Treatment Period prior to Amendment 4 becoming effective were 
randomised 1:1 to receive either sodium oxybate at the stable dose determined 
in the Stable-Dose Period or sodium oxybate placebo at a volume and regimen 
equivalent to the sodium oxybate dose taken during the Stable-Dose Period. As 
a result of a preplanned interim analysis, which demonstrated positive efficacy 
results on the primary efficacy endpoint, the protocol was amended (Amendment 
4) to replace the placebo treatment in the Double-Blind Treatment Period with 
open-label sodium oxybate treatment. After Amendment 4 became effective, all 
patients entering the Double-Blind Treatment Period received open-label sodium 
oxybate treatment.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 13-005 was a double blind placebo controlled randomized withdrawal study. Patients were titrated 
to effect and tolerability over 7-10 weeks, were subsequently on a stable dose for 2-3 weeks, and were 
then randomized to 2 weeks withdrawal followed by an open label period of up to 38-47 weeks. Both Xyrem 
naïve patients (who completed the titration period) and patients on Xyrem prior to inclusion (who entered 
the stable dose period directly) were included. As such, the study population was enriched with responders.  
The  EPAR  for  Xyrem  states  that  there  is  evidence  of  rebound  cataplexy,  which  could  inadvertently  be 
measured as efficacy in this type of design. Therefore, the design of the trial was not optimal and questions 
were  raised  whether  the  shown  efficacy  reflects  a  true  measure  of  efficacy,  or  whether  the  observed 
difference between groups is actually in part caused by rebound effects.  
The  study  included  patients  7-17  years  old.  Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  considered  relevant 
although  they  served  to  further  enrich  the  population.  136  patients  were  screened  and  106  patients 
enrolled, with 74 Xyrem naïve and 32 on prior Xyrem therapy. 17 patients dropped out, with 6 dropouts 
occurring  after  the  randomized  period.  Only  63  patients  were  randomized  because  an  interim  analysis 
showed effect and thereafter patients were no longer randomized to placebo, and 62 patients completed 
the randomized period.  
The  primary  endpoint  was  change  in  the  weekly  number  of  cataplexy  attacks,  with  several  secondary 
endpoints  related  to  narcolepsy  and  life  quality.  The  sample  size,  randomization,  blinding  and  statistical 
methods  were  considered  appropriate.  The  recruitment  and  conduct  of  the  study  was  considered 
acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Median  age  was 12 years, with 64.2 % 12-17 and 35.8% 7-12 years old. Other baseline characteristics 
were  evenly  distributed  between  placebo  and  treatment  groups  and  considered  to  reflect  the  target 
population.  
The primary endpoint was met, with placebo treated patients experiencing on average 17.37 more weekly 
cataplexy attacks than on their stable dose. For the active treatment group this was 2.52, with a p-value 
for difference of 0.0001. Different effect sizes are observed for paediatric patients under or above 12 years 
of age. The Applicant explained this finding as the age group 7-11 had a higher frequency of cataplexy at 
initiation  of  treatment,  but  were  titrated  to  effect  with  higher  final  doses,  resulting  in  similar  cataplexy 
frequencies between age groups at start of the randomized period. A number of secondary endpoints were

also statistically significant. Number of cataplexy attacks was relatively stable during the open label period 
indicating continued effect.  
A total of 106 patients were enrolled into the paediatric study (74 were Xyrem naïve and 32 were on Xyrem 
at study entry), all of them with improvement on the frequency of cataplexy per protocol prior to being 
randomized. 2 of the 74 Xyrem naïve patients were early terminated prior to the double-blind period due 
to no improvement with Xyrem treatment, reproducing clinical setting approach to discontinue treatment 
if there is no improvement in narcolepsy symptoms or there are tolerance issues. Subgroup analyses by 
Xyrem  status  at  study  entry  were  conducted  for  the  primary  endpoint,  with  similar  results  having  been 
observed. This is considered as proof that the enriched population does not have a significant impact on 
the trial validity, which can be considered acceptable. 
The issue about rebound was also discussed. The applicant provided data from 2 adult pivotal studies (OMC-
GHB-2  and  OMC-SXB-21)  submitted  upon  adult  MAA.  Both  studies  demonstrated  gradual  increase  in 
incidence  of  cataplexy  on  withdrawal  of  treatment  but  number  of  cataplexy  attacks  at  the  end  of  the 
treatment was still lower than at baseline (by definition rebound effect would require a sudden increase of 
events and to a higher number compared to baseline after treatment discontinuation). It was concluded 
from  the  totality  of  data  from  the  adult  studies  that  there  was  evidence  for  the  existence  of  a  mild 
withdrawal syndrome and rebound cataplexy upon suspension of treatment. This was reflected in the SmPC 
but still considering the possibility of causal link this may be due to the normal variability of the disease. 
The adult and paediatric data to date, suggest that rather than a rebound effect there is in fact a carryover 
treatment  effect  lasting  anywhere  from  a  few  days  to  a  week  or  more.  In  fact,  both  the  randomised 
withdrawal study designs (13-005 [pediatrics] and SXB-21 [adults]) demonstrate a gradual (rather than 
sudden) return in cataplexy by week during the double-blind treatment period. The strongest rebound effect 
for a short-acting CNS compound would be expected to be seen within the first 72 hours following abrupt 
discontinuation,  would  not  be  expected  to  continue  longer  than  a  few  days  to  one  week  and  would  be 
associated with lessened intensity over time which was not the profile seen after Xyrem discontinuation. 
The degree of the worsening of narcolepsy symptoms in placebo group also provides evidence that sodium 
oxybate treatment is beneficial and there is no evidence of rebound. In summary the efficacy results from 
this randomised withdrawal study design seem not have been impacted by a rebound effect. Further data 
from post-marketing use further corroborate the applicant’s position on rebound effect occurrence. 
Although the discussed studies seem to support the applicant’s claim on lack of rebound, they do not cover 
longer  periods  after  treatment  discontinuation  that  could  have  resulted  in  cataplexy  results  worse  than 
baseline.  The  cataplexy  profiles  for  the  Xyrem  naïve  patients  throughout  study  13-005  seem  to  further 
corroborate this hypothesis and to confirm that results represents a true treatment effect 
A comparison of the data concerning the adult and paediatric withdrawal trial design was presented and 
discussed.  The  apparent  more  severe  response  of  the  younger  population  on  placebo  is  justified  by  the 
higher median cataplexy during the initial dose titration period compared to the older Xyrem naïve subject. 
A  discussion  on  the  magnitude  of  therapeutic  effect  seen  in  paediatric  withdrawal  design  Vs  adult 
randomised trials was also made and may be similar. Considering a similar behaviour of the condition and 
response to Xyrem the consistency of the adult data (randomized Vs withdrawal design studies) makes it 
expectable to accept that the same would occur in the paediatric population.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of Xyrem is documented primarily in a single pivotal trial. The observed effect supports 
granting Marketing Authorisation in the paediatric population.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
CNS and respiratory depression were  among the important identified risks that have the highest impact 
due to their frequency and potential to induce life-threatening adverse effects. However, these risks are 
appropriately  addressed  in  the  SmPC  through  a  number  of  recommendations  that  appropriately  contain 
them. The interaction with alcohol is classified in the RMP as an important identified risk and educational 
materials have been updated to mitigate the risk. Convulsion and psychosis have also been identified. 
Dependence and withdrawal symptomatology; risk of overdose, misuse and abuse potential, and diversion 
/ criminal use are also known and risk reduction strategies are well implemented in the adult population. 
Depression and suicidality have been more recently identified and characterised following post-marketing 
reports and constitute special concern. 
The new paediatric population strengthens the depression and suicidality concern, together with the risk of 
misuse/abuse and diversion of use. Moreover, the impact on learning abilities and broader neurocognitive 
and physical growth are relevant for the paediatric population.  
The safety evaluation plan for the paediatric population type II variation incorporates safety information 
from  study  13-005  and  post  marketing  data.  The  Safety  Population  in  Study  13-005  consisted  of  106 
patients who were dispensed study drug. During the Dose-Titration Period, 2 patients were dispensed study 
drug, but did not take the medication and were subsequently discontinued on the first day of the study. 
Therefore,  104  patients  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  medication  and  safety  analyses  focus  on  this 
subset. 
Justification of Weight and Age Limit 
Study 13-005 was conducted only in patients aged 7 to 17 years, therefore sodium oxybate can only be 
prescribed to paediatric patients aged 7 years or older. 
The body weight distribution for this age range was calculated (category: <15kg, 15-<20kg or ≥20kg). This 
was  based  on  EU  population  statistics  (European  Commission,  2018)  and  weight  by  age  growth  data 
reported by WHO (2015) for children in the age range 7 to 17 years. The narcolepsy prevalence reported 
as 47 patients in 100,000 persons (Ohayon 2002)  was applied to understand the weight distribution  for 
narcolepsy  patients.  Presented  in  Table  1–1,  the  total  number  of  persons  in  the  EU  aged  7  to  17  years 
weighing <15kg was 1087 (total 7–17 years in the EU: N=59,157,274) this represented less than 0.002% 
of  this  population  and  estimates  only  one  patient  with  narcolepsy.  The  15-<20kg  and  >20kg  weight 
categories contained significantly greater numbers of children and adolescents aged 7 to 17 years and as 
such greater numbers of patients with narcolepsy are expected for these weight categories (677 and 27126, 
respectively).

Patient exposure 
As of the 10 Feb 2017 data cut-off date, 46 patients completed the study with up to 1 year of study drug 
exposure, while 43 patients were continuing treatment. Of the patients receiving study drug, 15 patients 
discontinued from the study during various study periods (5 patients discontinued from the Dose-Titration 
Period; 3 patients discontinued from the Stable-Dose Period; 1 patient discontinued from the Double-Blind 
Treatment Period; 6 patients discontinued from the Open-label Safety Period). A total of 104 patients took 
study drug for a median duration of 332 days. Overall, the median (Q1, Q3) total cumulative dose of sodium 
oxybate received was 1607.250g (859.250, 2112.875). Patients on sodium oxybate at study entry recorded 
a higher cumulative sodium oxybate dose while on study compared with patients who were sodium oxybate-
naïve (median [Q1, Q3]: 1736.000g [1154.250, 2019.300] vs 1592.625g [803.000, 2220.625]). Similar 
differences  were  observed  between  the  2  age  categories  (median  [Q1,  Q3]:  1543.000g  [1056.500, 
1937.750] for patients 7 to 11 years of age vs 1626.000g [801.500, 2246.000] for patients 12 to 17 years 
of  age).  Patients  who  were  sodium  oxybate-naïve  at  study  entry  were  required  to  initiate  dosing  at 
subtherapeutic doses and undergo 3 to 10 weeks of titration during the Dose-Titration Period to arrive at a 
stable  dose.  Furthermore,  titration  occurred  by  weight,  which  resulted  in  patients  with  lower  weight 
(commonly younger patients) initiating treatment at lower doses.

Note: The Safety Population consisted of all patients who were dispensed study drug.  
Adverse events 
Adverse events were recorded after patient assent or informed consent and until the last study visit; AEs 
with an onset date on or after the last dose date and up to and including 30 days after the last dose date 
were included in the AE summaries. The AEs were mapped to system organ classes (SOC) and/or preferred 
terms (PT) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 17.0. 
Events were assessed as occurring in treatment periods based on the onset date and the date of first dosing 
in each of the treatment periods. Treatment-emergent AEs were defined for a treatment period. Treatment 
emergent AEs of special interest were pre-specified by the Sponsor based on the FDA’s written request and 
the  DSMB  based  on  the  known  effects  of  sodium  oxybate.  Pre-specified  AEs  of  special  interest  included 
confusion, somnolence (and more pronounced levels of depressed consciousness), respiratory depression, 
depressed mood and suicidality, anxiety, sleepwalking and other parasomnias, abuse and misuse of study 
drug, and weight loss. 
Analysis of adverse events 
Within  the  Safety  Population  who  took  study  drug  (n=104),  across  all  treatment  periods,  a  total  of  75 
patients (72.1%) reported TEAEs. A similar proportion of patients in each age group reported TEAEs (7 to 
11  years  of  age=75.7%,  12  to  17  years  of  age=70.1%).  A  higher  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  reported  by 
sodium oxybate-naive patients compared with patients on sodium oxybate at study entry (76.4% vs 62.5%, 
respectively).  Most  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  Two  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  were 
reported during the study; no deaths were reported. Across all treatment periods, 5 patients experienced 
TEAEs leading to withdrawal from treatment and the study.  
The incidence of TEAEs was:  
•  56.9% during the Dose-Titration Period, 
•  15.3% during the Stable-Dose Period, 
•  21.1% during the Double-Blind Treatment Period, and 
•  61.7% during the Open-Label Safety Period.  
The  short  duration  of  the  Stable  Dose  Period  (2  to  3  weeks)  and  the  Double-Blind  Treatment  Period  (2 
weeks) compared with the longer durations of the Dose-Titration Period (3  to 10 weeks) and the Open-
Label Safety Period (38 to 47 weeks) must be noted, and comparisons between periods are limited. 
Half of all patients (50.0%) experienced TEAEs considered by the Investigator to be related to study drug. 
A higher incidence of treatment-related TEAEs was reported in sodium oxybate naive patients compared 
with patients on sodium oxybate at study entry (59.7% vs 28.1%, respectively). The improved tolerability 
of sodium oxybate over time has been observed previously in adults, and similar trends were present in 
this  paediatric  study.  This  may  result  from  improved  tolerability  with  treatment,  or  arise  from  potential 
bias, such as reporting bias and self-selection bias. 
A similar proportion of patients in each age group experienced related TEAEs (7 to 11 years of age=48.6%, 
12  to  17  years  of  age=50.7%).  Across  all  treatment  periods,  no  clear  difference  in  TEAE  incidence  was 
observed between the 2 different age groups, although this conclusion may be limited by the small number 
of patients in the 7 to 11-year age category. Additional analysis was performed to assess the TEAEs across 
all  treatment  periods  for  patients  only  receiving  sodium  oxybate.  Close  to  half  of  all  patients  (49.0%) 
experienced  TEAEs  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  related  to  study  drug.  A  higher  incidence  of 
treatment-related TEAEs was reported in sodium oxybate naïve patients compared with patients on sodium

oxybate at study entry (59.7% vs 25.0%, respectively). A similar proportion of patients in each age group 
experienced related TEAEs (7 to 11 years of age=48.6%, 12 to 17 years of age 49.3%).  
The types of TEAEs reported during this study were the same as those previously reported in clinical studies 
or  post  marketing  reporting  in  adult  patients  taking  Xyrem.  Enuresis  and  vomiting,  both  of  which  are 
generally seen more frequently in children than in adults, occurred more frequently among the paediatric 
patients in this study than in previously studied adult narcolepsy patients. 
During the Dose-Titration Period, Stable-Dose Period, and Open-Label Safety Period, TEAEs occurred most 
frequently in the SOC Gastrointestinal Disorders, and included the PTs of nausea and vomiting. Nausea and 
vomiting  were  among  the  most  commonly  reported  TEAEs  in  sodium  oxybate  clinical  studies  with  adult 
patients. Treatment-emergent AEs also occurred frequently in the SOC Nervous System Disorders during 
the  Dose-Titration  Period,  the  Stable-Dose  Period,  and  the  Double  Blind  Treatment  Period,  and  included 
PTs of headache and dizziness.  
Of note, among randomised patients during the Double-Blind Treatment Period, within the SOC Nervous 
System Disorders, the PTs of headache and dizziness were not reported. Rather, the PTs of somnolence 
and cataplexy were reported solely in patients randomised to placebo. This observation was consistent with 
the efficacy findings that the number of cataplexy attacks and the ESS (CHAD) scores increased in patients 
randomised to placebo treatment during this period.

Overall, patients taking sodium oxybate during the study experienced 334 TEAEs and the event rate per 
100 days was 1.2.  
When comparing between age subgroups, the overall event rate per 100 days was similar (1.107 vs 1.258 
for patients 7 to 11 years of age and patients 12 to 17 years of age, respectively). The TEAE event rate 
was  similar  across  most  SOC  categories,  with  imbalances  noted  in  the  SOCs  Nervous  System  Disorders 
(0.094 vs 0.198, respectively), Investigations (0.113 vs 0.076, respectively) and Respiratory, Thoracic and 
Mediastinal Disorders (0.075 vs 0.052, respectively). At the PT level, imbalances were noted between the 
2 subgroups for headache (0.047 vs 0.128, respectively), nausea (0.094 vs 0.134), and vomiting (0.113 
vs 0.070, respectively). 
When comparing between subgroups based on sodium oxybate status at study entry, a higher event rate 
was observed for sodium oxybate-naive patients compared with patients on sodium oxybate at study entry 
(1.466 vs 0.674, respectively). This event rate imbalance translated across all SOCs, and most PTs.

Common Adverse Events 
Dose-Titration Period (3 to 10 weeks) 
A total of 41/72 patients (56.9%) experienced TEAEs during the Dose-Titration Period of the study. Most 
TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Both of the SAEs reported in the study occurred during the Dose-
Titration Period and in patients aged 12 to 17 years. During the Dose-Titration Period, TEAEs occurred most 
frequently in the SOCs Gastrointestinal Disorders (29.2%) and Nervous System Disorders (22.2%). Patients 
in  the  younger  7  to  11-year  age  group  reported  more  TEAEs  (i.e.,  >5%  difference  in  frequency)  than 
patients  12  to  17  years  of  age  in  the  SOC  categories  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  (37.5%  vs  25.0%, 
respectively), Infections and Infestations (16.7% vs 10.4%, respectively), and Investigations (12.5% vs 
2.1%,  respectively).  Conversely,  patients  in  the  12  to  17-year  age  group  reported  more  TEAEs  in 
Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders (i.e., >5% difference in frequency) than patients 7 to 11 years of age 
(8.3% vs 0%, respectively). 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  overall  by  PT  were  nausea  (18.1%),  enuresis  (15.3%),  headache 
(13.9%), and vomiting (12.5%). Vomiting and enuresis occurred more frequently in younger patients 7 to 
11 years of age than in older patients 12 to 17 years of age (vomiting: 25.0% vs 6.3%; enuresis: 20.8% 
vs 12.5%; respectively). Headache occurred more frequently in older patients 12 to 17 years of age than 
in younger patients (16.7% vs 8.3%, respectively). 
Stable-Dose Period (2 to 3 weeks) 
A total of 15/98 patients (15.3%) experienced TEAEs during the Stable-Dose Period of the study. All TEAEs 
were mild or moderate in severity. One TEAE of weight decreased led to withdrawal from treatment and 
the study. No SAEs were reported during the Stable-Dose Period. During the Stable-Dose Period, TEAEs 
occurred more frequently among patients 12 to 17 years of age (17.5%) than in patients 7 to 11 years of 
age (11.4%). Sodium oxybate-naïve patients reported a higher frequency of TEAEs (18.2%) than patients 
on sodium oxybate treatment at study entry (9.4%). Most TEAEs occurring during the Stable-Dose Period 
were considered by the Investigator to be related to study drug. Treatment-related TEAEs were reported 
more in patients 12 to 17 years of age (11.1%) than in patients 7 to 11 years of age (8.6%). Treatment

related  TEAEs  were  reported  more  in  patients  who  were  sodium  oxybate  naïve  at  study  entry  (12.1%) 
compared with patients on sodium oxybate treatment at study entry (6.3%). 
During  the  Stable  Dose  Period,  TEAEs  occurred  most  frequently  in  the  SOCs  Gastrointestinal  Disorders 
(5.1%)  and  Nervous  System  Disorders  (4.1%).  The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  overall  by  PT  were 
nausea (3.1%), enuresis (2.0%), and weight decreased (2.0%). No TEAEs occurred at a frequency >5% in 
any PT. Because of the low frequency of events, no specific discernible patterns were evident among any 
subgroups. 
Double-Blind Treatment Period (2 weeks) 
A total of 20/95 patients (21.1%) reported TEAEs during the Double-Blind Treatment Period. All TEAEs were 
mild or moderate in severity. One TEAE (sleep apnoea syndrome) led to withdrawal from treatment and 
the study. No SAEs were reported during the Double-Blind Treatment Period. 
During the Double-Blind Treatment Period, TEAEs occurred most frequently in the SOCs of Nervous System 
Disorders (8.4%) and Psychiatric Disorders (7.4%). Patients randomised to placebo reported TEAEs in the 
SOC  Nervous  System  Disorders  more  frequently  (21.9%)  than  patients  randomised  to  sodium  oxybate 
(0.0%) or patients receiving open-label sodium oxybate (3.1%). During the Double-Blind Treatment Period, 
the most frequently reported TEAEs by PT were somnolence (7.4%), cataplexy (6.3%), and sleep disorder 
(3.2%). Somnolence and cataplexy occurred solely in patients randomised to placebo during the Double-
Blind Treatment Period (21.9% and 18.8%, respectively), which was consistent with the efficacy findings 
that  the  number  of  cataplexy  attacks  and  the  ESS  (CHAD)  scores  increased  in  patients  randomised  to 
placebo treatment during this period. 
Open-Label Safety Period (38 to 47 weeks) 
A total of 58/94 patients (61.7%) reported TEAEs during the Open-Label Safety Period. Most TEAEs were 
mild or moderate in severity. One TEAE led to withdrawal from the study (affect lability). One patient in the 
12 to 17-year age group experienced  1 event of pain in jaw that was severe in severity; the event was 
considered not related to study drug by the Investigator. No SAEs were reported during the Open-Label 
Safety Period. 
TEAEs occurred with similar frequency between age groups (7 to 11 years of age=64.7%; 12 to 17 years 
of  age=60.0%)  and  occurred  more  frequently  among  patients  who  were  sodium  oxybate  naïve  at  study 
entry (64.5%) than patients on sodium oxybate at study entry (56.3%). Of the TEAEs occurring during the 
Open-Label Safety Period, approximately half were considered by the Investigator to be related to study 
drug. Related TEAEs occurred more frequently among patients who were sodium oxybate-naïve at study 
entry (37.1%) than patients on sodium oxybate at study entry (21.9%). 
During  the  Open-Label  Safety  Period,  TEAEs  occurred  most  frequently  in  the  SOCs  Gastrointestinal 
Disorders (23.4%), Infections and Infestations (17.0%), Investigations (13.8%), and Psychiatric Disorders 
(13.8%). 
•  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  TEAEs  occurred  with  similar  frequency  across  age  subgroups,  but 
occurred  more  frequently  in  patients  who  were  sodium  oxybate-naïve  at  study  entry  (27.4%) 
compared with patients on sodium oxybate at study entry (15.6%). 
• 
Infections  and  Infestations  TEAEs  occurred  with  similar  frequency  across  subgroups  by  sodium 
oxybate status at study entry, but occurred more frequently in patients who were aged 12 to 17 
years (20.0%) than in younger patients aged 7 to 11 years (11.8%).

• 
Investigations TEAEs occurred with similar frequency across subgroups by sodium oxybate status 
at study entry, but occurred more frequently in patients who were aged 7 to 11 years (17.6%) than 
in older patients aged 12 to 17 years (11.7%). 
Psychiatric Disorders TEAEs occurred at a greater frequency in patients who were 7 to 11 years of 
age (20.6%) than in patients who were 12 to 17 years of age (10.0%), and at a greater frequency 
in  patients  who  were  on  sodium  oxybate  at  study  entry  (18.8%)  than  sodium  oxybate-naïve 
patients (11.3%).  
The most frequently reported TEAEs by PT during the Open-Label Safety Period were enuresis (10.6%), 
headache (9.6%), vomiting (9.6%), and nausea (8.5%). Nausea and headache occurred more frequently 
in patients 12 to 17 years of age than in patients 7 to 11 years of age (nausea: 11.7% vs 2.9%, respectively; 
headache: 11.7% vs 5.9%, respectively). There were no other notable imbalances across subgroups with 
regard to TEAE frequency by PT. The events of special interest are discussed below. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There were no deaths in the trial. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Two patients, both of whom were sodium oxybate naïve at study entry, experienced SAEs during the Dose-
Titration Period. One event was severe (acute psychosis) and the other was moderate (suicidal ideation) in 
severity. Both events resolved, and both were considered as related to study drug. The event of suicidal 
ideation led to withdrawal from the study. The event of acute psychosis led to study drug interruption; the 
patient later resumed treatment with sodium oxybate at a lower dose without recurrence of the event. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Treatment emergent AEs of special interest were prespecified by the Sponsor, based on the FDA’s written 
request, and the DSMB, because of the known effects of sodium oxybate. The prespecified AEs of special 
interest  in  this  study  included  confusion,  somnolence  (and  more  pronounced  levels  of  depressed 
consciousness), respiratory depression, depressed mood and suicidality, anxiety, sleepwalking and other 
parasomnias, abuse and misuse of study drug, and weight loss. A full list of prespecified MedDRA PTs for 
AEs of special interest is provided in Appendix 16.1.9 of the Study 13-005 CSR. The trend observed in the 
incidence  of  TEAEs  of  special  interest  while  receiving  sodium  oxybate  across  all  treatment  periods  was 
similar  to  the  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  while  receiving  sodium  oxybate  across  all  treatment  periods. 
Specifically,  a  larger  proportion  of  patients  7  to  11  years  of  age  (35.1%)  experienced  TEAEs  of  special 
interest compared with patients 12 to 17 years of age (25.4%), and a larger proportion of sodium oxybate-
naïve patients (33.3%) experienced TEAEs of special interest compared with patients on sodium oxybate 
at study entry (18.8%). 
Five  patients  experienced  confusion.  Apart  from  the  event  of  acute  psychosis,  all  events  were  mild  or 
moderate in severity. All events recovered / resolved. Only the event of acute psychosis was an SAE. Four 
of 5 events were considered to be related to study drug. The dose of study drug was reduced in 2 patients 
after experiencing the events of confusional state and acute psychosis. Of these 5 events, 1 event (affect 
lability) led to discontinuation from the study.

Nine patients experienced somnolence during the study. All events were mild or moderate in severity and 
all but 2 events recovered / resolved. None of the events were SAEs. Eight of 9 events were considered by 
the Investigator to be related to study drug. The 7 events that occurred during the Double-Blind Treatment 
Period  were  experienced  by  patients  randomised  to  placebo.  The  dose  of  study  drug  was  increased  in  1 
patient and reduced in 1 patient. None of these events led to discontinuation from the study. 
Two patients experienced respiratory depression during the study and details are provided in Both patients 
experienced  events  of  central  sleep  apnoea  and  both  patients  also  had  asthma  in  their  medical  history. 
Further, both events were moderate in severity, considered by the Investigator to be related to study drug, 
and were findings revealed during PSG assessment. Neither of the events was an SAE. One of the 2 events 
resolved  by  the  final  PSG,  but  the  event  led  to  interruption  of  study  drug  and  the  patient  subsequently 
discontinued from the study. 
One patient experienced depression / suicidality during the Dose-Titration Period. The patient did not have 
a  medical  history  of  depression  or  suicidality.  The  event  was  an  SAE  of  moderate  severity  and  was 
considered by the Investigator to be related to study drug. The event led to withdrawal from the study. 
Six patients experienced  anxiety during the study. All events were mild or moderate in severity, and all 
recovered / resolved. None of the events were SAEs. Two of 6 events were considered by the Investigator 
to be related to study drug. The dose of study drug was reduced in 1 patient. None of these events led to 
discontinuation from the study. 
Twelve  patients  experienced  13  events  of  parasomnia  during  the  study,  including  somnambulism  (4 
patients), nightmare (4 patients), confusional arousal (3 patients), abnormal dreams (1 patient), and sleep 
talking  (1  patient).  Three  patients  reported  events  during  the  Double  Blind  Treatment  Period  and  were 
randomised to receive placebo. All parasomnia events were mild in severity, and all but 1 event of nightmare 
recovered / resolved. None of the events were SAEs. Nine events were considered by the Investigator to 
be  related  to  study  drug.  The  dose  of  study  drug  was  reduced  in  2  patients  after  experiencing 
somnambulism  and  confusional  arousal  and  increased  in  1  patient  after  experiencing  the  event  of 
nightmare. None of these events led to discontinuation from the study. 
No specific event categorised as abuse or misuse of study drug has been reported as of the data cutoff date 
of  10  February  2017.  However,  2  patients  were  terminated  early  from  the  study  because  of  treatment 
noncompliance. 
Thirteen patients experienced weight loss or weight decreased during the study. All events were mild in 
severity, all but 1 event resolved, and 9 events were considered by the Investigator to be related to study 
drug. Of these 12 patients, 1 patient discontinued due to weight decreased. All patients were overweight 
or at the upper end of normal weight category at study entry per the Center for Disease Control (CDC) BMI 
percentile  definition  for  paediatrics.  One  patient  became  underweight  during  the  study  but  returned  to 
within  normal  range  by  the  end  of  the  study.  Notably,  10  of  13  patients  also  experienced  concurrent 
gastrointestinal  AEs,  but  no  apparent  relationship  to  the  weight  loss  was  observed.  In  addition  to  the 
patients with reported TEAEs of weight loss presented above, some patients also experienced weight loss 
that was not reported as a TEAE during the study. Three patients became underweight based on from CDC 
BMI percentile definition for paediatrics at varied time points during the study.

One 10-year-old black male patient experienced 3 TEAEs relating to the SOC Investigations, including PT 
blood  triglycerides  increased  (blood  triglycerides  were  increased  at  screening  but  resolved  at  Visit  4, 
approximately  3  months  later);  haematocrit  decreased  (screening  value  was  0.350L/L  [reference  range 
0.354 to 0.437] and decreased to 0.344L/L at Visit 4); and haemoglobin decreased (screening value was 
109g/L [reference range 113 to 149] which decreased to 107g/L at Visit 4). All of these TEAEs were mild 
in intensity and none were considered by the Investigator to be related to study drug. None were SAEs. All 
events resolved without interruptions / changes in dosing. 
Clinical chemistry 
A technical issue was identified regarding serum direct bilirubin  values reported from laboratory testing. 
Between 02 Jan and 21 Nov 2016, serum direct bilirubin values levels assayed by ACM Global Laboratories 
(ACM)  for  this  study  were  assigned  a  positive  proportional  bias  due  to  a  calibrator  issue  (calibrator 
manufactured by Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). Calibrator values were reassigned by the manufacturer 
and  were  placed  into  effect  by  ACM  as  of  21  Nov  2016.  ACM  conducted  an  internal  correlation  between 
results obtained using the old calibrator set point and the new reassigned calibrator set point. A positive 
shift in direct bilirubin results was observed that was proportional in nature. An average bias of 30% was 
seen when direct bilirubin was >3 x upper limit of normal (ULN). Differences for results that were in the 
normal range and up to 3 x ULN were within the total allowable error of the assay. Siemens estimated the 
average  bias  to  be  approximately  40%.  A  correction  factor  could  not  be  provided  and  previously  tested 
samples could not be re-assayed. Results obtained during the affected period are in the clinical database 
uncorrected. Upon analysis of the direct bilirubin outliers by the Sponsor, the positive bias was considered 
to have no clinical impact. 
There  were  no  apparent  differences  of  clinical  relevance  observed  over  time  across  treatment  periods. 
Serum  chemistry  values  were  generally  stable  relative  to  baseline  over  the  period  of  treatment.  When 
examining  serum  chemistry  shift  tables,  there  was  no  discernible  pattern  observed  for  any  parameter, 
regardless of treatment group or subgroup. 
A total of 7 patients experienced TEAEs relating to the SOC Investigations. These included PT blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased, potassium increased, sodium increased, blood urea nitrogen increased, lactate 
dehydrogenase increased and alanine aminotransferase increased. All of these AEs were mild or moderate 
in intensity and none were considered by the Investigator to be related to study drug. None were SAEs. All 
events resolved without interruptions / changes in dosing. 
Urinalysis 
Urinalysis  values  were  generally  stable  relative  to  baseline  over  the  treatment  periods.  The  majority  of 
abnormal urinalysis results reported during the study were not clinically significant. 
The  overall  median  (Q1,  Q3)  urine  pH  was  6.5  (6,  7)  at  baseline.  Sodium oxybate-naïve  patients  had  a 
median (Q1, Q3) baseline urine pH of 6.0 (5.5, 6.5) and subsequently had a median (Q1, Q3) increase of 
1 unit (0, 1.5) at the end of the Double-Blind Treatment Period (up to 12 weeks of sodium oxybate) from 
baseline. No further increase was observed by the end of the study. Patients on sodium oxybate at study 
entry had an elevated urine pH of 7.5 (6.5, 7.5) at baseline. No further increase was observed by the end 
of the study. Furthermore, no clinically significant changes in bicarbonate were observed. 
Two  patients  experienced  TEAEs  related  to  the  SOC  Investigations.  These  included  PTs  of  protein  urine 
present (both patients) and pH urine increased (1 patient). These AEs were mild in intensity and none were 
considered by the Investigator to be related to study drug. None were SAEs. All events resolved without 
interruptions / changes in dosing.

Overall,  mean  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  values,  mean  pulse  rate,  mean  respiratory  rate,  and 
mean temperature were generally within normal limits throughout the study. Minimal changes from baseline 
were observed at all time points, during all periods, regardless of subgroup. 
Physical examination findings 
Physical stature  
Physical stature was assessed via measurements of height (cm) and weight (kg) at each visit during the 
study. Each patient’s BMI was calculated at each visit as weight (kg)/height (m2). A decreasing trend in 
weight and BMI percentile was observed during the study while height percentile remained relatively stable. 
Body weight and body mass index 
Overall, body weight percentile trended downwards throughout the study. The impact of sodium oxybate 
on body weight percentile appeared similar for both age groups. When examined by sodium oxybate status 
at study entry, sodium oxybate-naïve patients demonstrated a decrease in body weight percentile during 
the Dose-Titration Period. At the start of the Stable-Dose Period, body weight percentiles were similar for 
sodium oxybate-naïve patients and patients on sodium oxybate at study entry. All patients subsequently 
demonstrated  a  similar  decrease  in  body  weight  percentile  for  the  remainder  of  the  study.  Similar  to 
observations  for  body  weight,  a  decreasing  trend  in  BMI  percentile  was  observed  during  the  study.  The 
impact of sodium oxybate on BMI percentile appeared similar for both age groups. When compared to CDC 
Growth Charts, on average sodium oxybate-naïve patients were overweight at study entry while patients 
who were on sodium oxybate at study entry were at the upper end of the weight range. Sodium oxybate-
naïve patients demonstrated a decrease in BMI percentile during the Dose-Titration Period. At the start of 
the  Stable-Dose  Period,  BMI  percentiles  were  similar  for  sodium  oxybate-naïve  patients  and  patients  on 
sodium  oxybate  at  study  entry.  All  patients  subsequently  demonstrated  a  similar  slight  decrease  in  BMI 
percentile for the remainder of the study.

Brain Development 
There was no specific evaluation of brain development. However, in Study 13-005, there were assessments 
conducted to assess behaviour in children. The main assessment was the SF-10 Health Survey for Children. 
The SF-10™ Health Survey for Children is a parent-completed survey that contains 10 questions adapted 
from the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). The SF-10 provides coverage across a wide range of domains 
and is scored to produce physical and psychosocial health summary measures. This survey is intended for 
children between the ages of 5 and 18, and is available with a standard 4-week recall period. The outcome 
of the survey suggests there is no behaviour change. This is also supported from a non-clinical perspective 
in a study with juvenile rats. Potential effects of sodium oxybate on the developing brain were evaluated 
through 3 different neurobehavioral assessments (locomotor activity measurements, acoustic startle reflex 
habituation  test,  and  Morris  water  maze  test)  covering  various  CNS  functions  (motor  activity  and 
coordination, sensorimotor function, memory/learning, reactivity). No effects were observed in these tests 
at any of the doses. Moreover, social/sexual behaviour was assessed through cohabitation (pairing of one 
male and one female) and observation of mating at the end of the study. In addition, neurohistopathological 
examinations were conducted on 34 subanatomic sections of the brain in the control and high dose groups, 
as well as 11 morphometric measurements taken on 6 neocortex, hippocampus and cerebellum sections. 
These examinations did not reveal any sodium oxybate-related findings. Altogether, there is no evidence 
that  sodium  oxybate  had  any  adverse  effects  on  the  developing  brain  of  juvenile  rats  up  to  a  dose  of 
900mg/kg/day.   
Given the paucity of clinical and post marketing data, regarding brain development, this will be followed up 
under routine PV activities. Furthermore, the RMP includes ‘Long-term impact on children and adolescents, 
including growth and neurocognitive development’ as missing information

Electrocardiograms 
There were no meaningful changes from baseline in ECG assessments during the study, and no clinically 
relevant differences were observed between treatment groups or subgroups. Overall, the majority of ECG 
assessments  were  recorded  as  normal,  with  a  small  proportion  of  patients  recording  abnormal  but  not 
clinically significant results. Five patients had ECGs flagged as clinically significant by the central reader, 
but after additional review by the Investigator, all were clarified as not clinically significant. No changes in 
ECG were recorded as TEAEs. No QT or QTcB changes were considered clinically significant. 
Polysomnograms 
Polysomnograms were performed for sodium oxybate-naïve patients at screening without sodium oxybate, 
at the end of the Stable-Dose Period while on a stable dose of sodium oxybate treatment, and at the End 
of Study Visit while on a stable dose of sodium oxybate treatment. For patients on sodium oxybate at study 
entry,  PSGs  were  performed  at  screening  and  at  the  End  of  Study  Visit,  both  while  on  a  stable  dose  of 
sodium  oxybate.  Parameters  assessed  included  sleep  stage,  oxygen  saturation,  central  and  obstructive 
apnoea index, and apnoea hyponea index (AHI), among many others.   
Patients  with  sleep-disordered  breathing  (SDP)  were  excluded  from  the  study  per  Screening  PSG 
parameters. The 2 patients excluded for evidence of SDB on PSG based on an AHI >5 without associated 
desaturation,  hypoventilation,  or  clinically  significant  findings  were  SXB  naïve.  Overall,  there  was  no 
clinically  significant  increase  in  central  or  obstructive  apnoea  and  hypopnea  or  significant  oxygen 
desaturation for sodium oxybate-naïve patients after receiving sodium oxybate treatment, or when patients 
had been treated with sodium oxybate up to 1 year. 
For patients who were sodium oxybate-naïve at study entry, mean oxygen saturation values were in the 
normal range at the Screening PSG, and at the End of Study PSG. The median (Q1, Q3) value for these 
mean oxygen saturations at the Screening PSG (without study drug) was 97.30% (96.80, 98.00). At the 
End of Stable Dose PSG (with study drug), median (Q1, Q3) oxygen saturation was 97.10% (96.40, 97.75), 
and at the End of Study PSG (with study drug) was 97.25% (96.90, 97.90). For patients on sodium oxybate 
at study entry, mean oxygen saturation values were in the normal range at the Screening PSG, at the End 
of  Stable  Dose  PSG  and  at  the  End  of  Study  PSG.  The  median  (Q1,  Q3)  value  for  these  mean  oxygen 
saturations  for  patients  on  sodium  oxybate  at  study  entry  at  the  Screening  PSG  (with  study  drug)  was 
97.50% (96.95, 98.20), and at the End of Study PSG (with study drug) was 97.20% (96.60, 98.10). 
Overall, there was no apparent association between study drug dose and nadir oxygen saturation. Individual 
desaturation  events  occurred.  They  were  infrequent  and  brief  in  duration.  Nadir  oxygen  saturation  was 
≥90% for the entire total sleep time in the majority of patients. No patients had oxygen desaturation below 
70% while on study. 
For sodium oxybate-naïve patients, oxygen saturation ≥90% was maintained in 91.8% of patients during 
the  Screening  PSG  (without  study  drug),  in  90.6%  of  patients  during  the  End  of  Stable  Dose  PSG  (with 
study drug), and in 90% of patients during the End of Study PSG (with study drug). During the Screening 
PSG,  the  median  (Q1,  Q3)  nadir  oxygen  saturation  for  sodium  oxybate-naïve  patients  was  92  (91,  94). 
During the End of Stable Dose PSG, the median nadir oxygen saturation for sodium oxybate-naïve patients 
was 92 (91, 93.5). For patients on sodium oxybate at study entry, oxygen saturation ≥90% was maintained 
in 93.8% of patients during the Screening PSG (with study drug), and in 76.5% of patients during the End 
of Study PSG (with study drug). 
Four patients had nadir oxygen saturation below 90% (between 83 and 88%) for >6 seconds. During the 
Screening PSG, the median (Q1, Q3) nadir oxygen saturation for patients on sodium oxybate at study entry 
was 93.5 (91, 94.5). Median (Q1, Q3) nadir oxygen saturation at the End of Study PSG for both sodium 
oxybate naïve patients and patients on sodium oxybate at study entry was 93 (91, 94) 
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) (Posner 2011) was administered at each contact with 
Assessment report

patients during the study, and measured suicidal ideation or behaviour. Patients with a current suicidal risk 
as determined from history or C-SSRS or history of suicide attempt were excluded from the study. Based 
on  the  age  of  the  subject,  the  version  for  children  ≥12  years  of  age  or  the  version  for  children  was 
administered. In addition, the exclusion criteria were amended in Protocol amendment 3 to strengthen the 
exclusion/discontinuation  criteria  to  exclude/discontinue  subjects  with  depression  that  is  independent  of 
narcolepsy symptoms. In the revised criteria, the use of the T-score on Children’s Depression Inventory 
Self Report (CDI 2:SR[S]) was changed to identify the need for a formal evaluation by a qualified clinician. 
Since many narcolepsy symptoms overlap with items assessed in the CDI 2:SR[S], this scale was used only 
as a screening assessment for the risk of depression in this study. 
As of the data cut date of 10 February 2017, 2 patients responded positively to the C-SSRS; in both patients, 
the positive responses were associated with SAEs. Patient 132-1001 responded positively to questions on 
nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviour at Visit 1.6 (Week 6 plus 3 days) after the SAE of acute psychosis was 
reported. Patient 501 1004 responded positively in response to questions on suicidal ideation in the C SSRS 
at the Early Termination Visit after the SAE of suicidal ideation was reported. 
The 2 patients who had positive screen on C-SSRS were sodium oxybate naïve. In addition to screening 
positive on C-SSRS, these patients also were screened positive for depression (one patient) and depression 
and anxiety (one patient) based on CDI 2:SR[S] assessment.  
The  observed  serious  adverse  events  in  patients  501-1004  and  132-1001  was  deemed  to  support  that 
suicidality and psychiatric events were a concern to be taken into account for the paediatric population. 
Children’s Depression Inventory-Second Edition 
The CDI 2:SR[S] was administered at each visit to monitor for depression or increased risk of depression 
during the study. The T scores were used in the analysis of CDI:2. For this assessment, T scores ≤40 are 
categorised as Low, scores from 41 to 59 are Average, scores from 60 to 64 are High Average, scores from 
65  to  69  are  categorised  as  Elevated,  and  T  scores  ≥70  are  Very  Elevated;  higher  scores  reflect  more 
severe  depression.  A  slight  downward  trend  was  observed  in  mean  T  scores  over  time,  but  scores  were 
within the average range in both sodium oxybate-naïve patients and patients on sodium oxybate at study 
entry. Similar results were observed for the age subgroups. 
Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children-10 Item (MASC-10) 
Because  sodium  oxybate  is  a  CNS  depressant,  the  Multidimensional  Anxiety  Scale  for  Children-10  Item 
(MASC-10) was administered at each visit to monitor for risk of anxiety during the study. The T scores were 
used in the analysis of MASC 10, such that T scores <40 were categorised as below average, scores from 
40  to  55  were  Average,  scores  from  56  to  60  were  Slightly  Above  Average,  scores  from  66  to  70  were 
categorised as Much Above Average, and T scores >70 were Very Much Above Average. Overall, MASC-10 
scores  remained  steady  over  the  duration  of  the  study,  with  minimal  changes  regardless  of  treatment 
period, age subgroup or subgroup by sodium oxybate status at study entry. 
Growth hormones, sex hormones and Tanner Stage 
Tests of growth (including measurements of growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1, and prolactin) 
were  assessed  at  the  beginning  of  the  Double-Blind  Treatment  Period,  at  the  end  of  the  Double-Blind 
Treatment Period, and at the end of the Open-Label Safety Period. Tests of precocious puberty (including 
luteinising  hormone,  follicle  stimulating  hormone,  testosterone,  estradiol,  and  Tanner  Staging)  were 
assessed at screening and at the end of the Open-Label Safety Period for female patients under the age of 
8 and male patients under the age of 9.

Sodium oxybate use did not result in adverse effects on growth or sex hormones, and there were no signals 
of premature puberty during the study. No clinically relevant differences were observed for subgroups by 
age or sodium oxybate status at study entry. 
In  a  study,  to  assess  the  effect  of  repeated,  twice-a-night  administration  of  SXB  on  24-h  GH  secretion 
patterns in both patients with hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy and matched healthy controls. GH secretion 
was assessed during a 24-h sample occasion with concomitant sleep registrations at baseline and after 5 
nights of SXB. It was hypothesised in the study that SXB administration would lead to a persistent increase 
in nocturnal GH secretion in both patients and controls, paralleled by an increase in SWS. In contrast to 
existing studies that found diminished or even unmeasurable GH concentrations around sleep onset, this 
study  found  repeated  administration  of  sodium  oxybate  leads  to  a  consistent  increase  in  nocturnal  GH 
secretion  in  both  healthy  controls  and  hypocretin-deficient  narcoleptic  patients.  Sodium  oxybate  also 
strengthens the temporal relation between GH secretion and SWS. These data suggest that SXB may alter 
somatotropic  tone  in  addition  to  its  consolidating  effect  on  night-time  sleep  in  hypocretin  deficient 
narcolepsy.  This  could  explain  the  suggested  nonsleep  effects  of  SXB,  including  body  weight  reduction 
(Donjacour, 2011).  
In a study where nine hypocretin deficient patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy and 
nine  healthy  matched  controls  were  enrolled,  it  was  found  that  narcolepsy  patients  were  more  insulin 
sensitive  and  tend  to  have  a  lower  rate  of  lipolysis  than  weight  matched  controls.  Sodium  oxybate 
stimulated lipolysis in narcolepsy patients, possible accounting for the observed weight loss after treatment. 
While sodium oxybate had a tendency to decrease systemic insulin sensitivity, it increased hepatic insulin 
sensitivity, suggesting tissue-specific effects (Donjacour, 2014). 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors 
Throughout this SCS, safety analyses are discussed by age (patients 7 to 11 years of age and 12 to 17 
years of age) where data were available. 
There was no analysis of safety by race as the great majority of the patients were classed as Caucasian 
(White). No safety analyses were conducted based on sex. Population PK analyses were conducted with the 
following age, race and sex covariates: age (years, continuous), age (categorical; paediatric [7-17 years of 
age],  adult  [≥18  years  of  age],  child  [7-11  years  of  age],  adolescent  [12-17  years  of  age]);  race 
(categorical; American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or other 
Pacific Islander, White, other); and sex (categorical; male, female). 
The Population PK analyses showed that age categories affect the volume of distribution of sodium oxybate. 
Children  (7-11  years  of  age)  had  a  12%  reduction  in  volume  relative  to  adults,  and  adolescents  (12-17 
years  of  age)  had  a  22%  increase  in  volume  relative  to  adults.  While  age  categories  were  significant 
covariates on the volume  of distribution, there were no clinically meaningful differences in simulated  PK 
profiles among age categories when sodium oxybate was administered at the same mg/kg doses. Covariate 
analysis did not reveal sex or race as significant covariates. However, due to the limited population sample 
size and relative lack of racial diversity, a contribution of race as a covariate to the observed overall PK 
variability cannot be excluded. 
Generally, the types of AEs observed in paediatric subjects were the same as that of adults in clinical studies 
and  post  marketing  experience.  No  new  safety  concerns  were  identified,  and  the  safety  profile  was 
consistent  with  what  has  previously  been  established  (Xyrem  SmPC,  2018).  In  Study  13  005,  the  most 
frequently  reported  TEAEs  included  enuresis,  nausea,  headache,  vomiting  and  weight  decreased.  All  of 
these events were consistent with what has been observed in adult subjects treated with Xyrem (Xyrem 
SmPC, 2018), although enuresis and vomiting were reported more frequently in paediatric subjects. 
Assessment report

Respiratory  depression,  CNS  depression,  depression/suicidality,  as  well  as  alcohol 
interaction, 
dependence/withdrawal,  overdose,  misuse/abuse,  diversion/criminal  use,  convulsion,  and  psychosis  are 
considered important identified risks of sodium oxybate treatment in adult and paediatric patients. 
Based on this known safety profile of Xyrem, pre-specified TEAEs of special interest were closely monitored 
in Study 13 005. These events included confusion, somnolence, respiratory depression, depressed mood 
and suicidality, anxiety, sleepwalking and other parasomnias, abuse and misuse of study drug, and weight 
loss. A low incidence of TEAEs occurred in the individual categories of special interest. Adverse events of 
special  interest  observed  in  paediatric  subjects  were  also  observed  in  the  adult  narcolepsy  population 
treated with Xyrem (Xyrem SmPC, 2018).

Data from a limited number of pregnant women exposed in the first trimester indicate a possible increased 
risk of spontaneous abortions. To date no other relevant epidemiological data are available. Limited data 
from  pregnant  patients  during  second  and  third  trimester  indicate  no  malformative  or  foeto/neonatal 
toxicity of sodium oxybate. Sodium oxybate is therefore not recommended during pregnancy (Xyrem SmPC, 
2018). 
Sodium oxybate and/or its metabolites are excreted into breast milk. Changes in sleep patterns have been 
observed in breastfed infants from exposed mothers, which may be consistent with the effects of sodium 
oxybate on the nervous system. Sodium Oxybate should not be used during breastfeeding (Xyrem SmPC, 
2018). 
Overdose 
Information about signs and symptoms associated with overdosage with sodium oxybate is limited. Most 
data derives from the illicit use of GHB. Sodium oxybate is the sodium salt of GHB. Events associated with 
withdrawal syndrome have been observed outside the therapeutic range (Xyrem SmPC, 2018). 
Patients have exhibited varying degrees of depressed consciousness that may fluctuate rapidly between a 
confusional, agitated combative state with ataxia and coma. Emesis (even with impaired consciousness), 
diaphoresis, headache, and impaired psychomotor skills may be observed. Blurred vision has been reported. 
An increasing depth of coma has been observed at higher doses. Myoclonus and tonic-clonic seizures have 
been reported. There are reports of compromise in the rate and depth of respiration and of life-threatening 
respiratory  depression,  necessitating  intubation  and  ventilation.  Cheyne-Stokes  respiration  and  apnoea 
have been observed. Bradycardia and hypothermia may accompany unconsciousness, as well as muscular 
hypotonia,  but  tendon  reflexes  remain  intact.  Bradycardia  has  been  responsive  to  atropine  intravenous 
administration (Xyrem SmPC, 2018).  
There is little experience of overdose in the clinical studies of sodium oxybate. The few cases that were 
recorded are from studies in adult patients. In one case in the Scharf study, one patient was commenced 
on sodium oxybate at 4.5 g/day and was hospitalised following an overdose of 18g of sodium oxybate. The 
patient  was  comatose  and  unresponsive  on  admission,  and  was  intubated  and  ventilated,  and  awoke  6 
hours later. Sodium oxybate therapy was recommenced 2 days later at a dose of 7.5 g/day.   
In  the  AE  data  for  Study  OMC-SXB-7,  a  patient  was  noted  to  have  taken  an  intentional  overdose.  The 
patient took approximately 150g once while on a sodium oxybate maintenance dosage of 9 g/day, and was 
permanently discontinued from the study. The patient recovered without sequelae in the Emergency Room 
and  was  hospitalised  for  5  days  for  psychiatric  evaluation.  The  patient  had  a  history  of  treatment  for 
depression and had made a previous suicide attempt.  
Drug abuse 
The active substance is sodium oxybate, which is as the sodium salt of GHB, an active substance with well-
known abuse potential (Xyrem SmPC, 2018).  
Prior  to  treatment  physicians  should  evaluate  patients  for  a  history  of  or  susceptibility  to  drug  abuse. 
Patients should be routinely monitored and in the case of suspected abuse, treatment with sodium oxybate 
should be discontinued. 
There have been case reports of dependence after illicit use of GHB at frequent repeated doses (18 to 250 
g/day)  in  excess  of  the  therapeutic  dose  range.  Whilst  there  is  no  clear  evidence  of  emergence  of 
dependence  in  patients  taking  sodium  oxybate  at  therapeutic  doses,  this  possibility  cannot  be  excluded 
(Xyrem SmPC, 2018).

A more detailed discussion of the post marketing data for sodium oxybate related to drug abuse is discussed 
in post-marketing data assessment. 
Withdrawal and rebound 
The discontinuation effects of sodium oxybate have not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical 
trials in patients with narcolepsy. In some patients, cataplexy may return at a higher frequency on cessation 
of sodium oxybate therapy, however this may be due to the normal variability of the disease. Although the 
clinical trial experience with sodium oxybate in narcolepsy/cataplexy patients at therapeutic doses does not 
show clear evidence of a withdrawal syndrome, in rare cases, events such as insomnia, headache, anxiety, 
dizziness,  sleep  disorder,  somnolence,  hallucination,  and  psychotic  disorders  were  observed  after  GHB 
discontinuation (Xyrem SmPC, 2018). 
In Study 13 005, paediatric patients irrespective of age group on stable doses of Xyrem who were withdrawn 
from  sodium  oxybate  treatment  and  randomised  to  Placebo  during  the  Double-blind  Treatment  Period 
experienced a significant increase in weekly cataplexy attacks compared to subjects who were randomised 
to  continue  treatment  with  Xyrem.  The  median  change  from  baseline  of  number  of  cataplexy  attacks  at 
Week 1, and Week 2 of the Double-blind Treatment Period for patients on Placebo was 10.25 and 15.31, 
respectively, and for patients continued on Xyrem was 0.00 and 1.42, respectively. It is to be noted that 
there  is  no  data  relative  to  the  pre-treatment  period  and  that  the  baseline  used  for  this  assessment  is 
calculated from the last 14 days of the Stable –dose Period. The main TEAEs documented, also exclusively 
reported  by  these  paediatric  patients,  were  cataplexy  (6  [18.8%]  patients)  and  somnolence  (7  [21.9%] 
patients). In addition to these two TEAEs the following TEAEs were reported: psychiatric disorders occurred 
in 5 (15.6%) patients (sleep disorder (2 [6.3%] patients), irritability (1 [3.1%] patient), abnormal dreams 
(1 [3.1%] patient), aggression (1 [3.1%] patient), initial insomnia (1 [3.1%] patient), and sleep walking 
(1 [3.1%] patients)), infections and infestations in 1 (3.1%) patient (impetigo), investigations in 2 (6.2%) 
patients  (1  [3.1%]  patient  blood  creatinine  phosphokinase  abnormal  and  1  [3.1%]  weight  decreased), 
metabolism and nutrition disorders in 1 (3.1%) patient (increased appetite), and renal and urinary disorders 
in 1 (3.1%) patient (enuresis). 
Effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability 
Sodium oxybate has a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines (Xyrem SmPC, 2018).  
Somnolence has been reported in clinical studies with sodium oxybate, and this was observed at a higher 
frequency in adult subjects than in paediatric subjects. Overall, 10.5% of adult patients treated with sodium 
oxybate  in  the  clinical  development  program  experienced  somnolence  compared  to  1.9%  of  adolescent 
subjects in Study 13 005. There is therefore no evidence that paediatric patients are at a greater risk for 
somnolence associated with sodium oxybate treatment. 
For at least 6 hours after taking sodium oxybate, patients must not undertake activities requiring complete 
mental alertness or motor co-ordination, such as operating machinery or driving. When patients first start 
taking sodium oxybate, until they know whether this medicinal product will still have some carryover effect 
on  them  the  next  day,  they  should  use  extreme  care  while  driving  a  car,  operating  heavy  machines,  or 
performing any other task that could be dangerous or require full mental alertness (Xyrem SmPC, 2018).

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug and drug-disease interactions were not investigated in this study. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Five  patients,  all  of  whom  were  sodium  oxybate-naïve  at  study  entry,  experienced  TEAEs  that  led  to 
withdrawal  from  treatment  and  the  study.  These  events  are  summarised  in  Table  below  and  included 
hallucination, tactile; suicidal ideation; weight decreased; sleep apnoea syndrome; and affect lability. The 
suicidal ideation was an SAE.

b  Treatment with open-label sodium oxybate 
Post marketing experience 
Sodium oxybate is currently indicated in the treatment of narcolepsy with cataplexy in adults. 
A total of 3919 safety case reports related to post marketing use of sodium oxybate in patients 7 to <18 
years of age were identified in the UCB Global Safety database. Due to the nature of spontaneous reporting, 
there are recognised limitations to the search strategies used, mainly due to lack of reported information. 
The submited cumulative review, characterises the safety of paediatric patients exposed to sodium oxybate. 
Overall, the safety profile in the paediatric population is similar to the safety profile in the adult population. 
Among the most frequently reported PTs in the paediatric population (>2%), 17 are also among the most 
frequently  reported  ones  in  the  adult  population  (>2%),  showing  considerable  overlap  between  the  two 
age  groups,  particularly  among  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs.  Overall,  13  clinical  PTs  were  more 
frequently  reported  in  paediatrics  than  in  adult  population,  classified  from  the  highest  to  the  lowest 
difference  in  reporting:  Vomiting,  Nausea,  Decreased  appetite,  Somnolence,  Abdominal  pain  upper, 
Nasopharyngitis, Cataplexy, Weight decreased, Cough, Headache, Somnambulism and Dizziness. 
Most of the frequently reported AEs are usually known to occur in the paediatric population, as they could 
be  related  to  childhood  development.  Enuresis  for  instance  is  a  typical  childhood  disorder  and  sodium 
oxybate likely contributes to its re-emergence by promoting deep sleep. Aggression is also considered as a 
highly frequent behaviour in young developing children. Somnambulism is also known to be more common

in young children and has been shown to decrease markedly by early adolescence. Nausea and vomiting 
are very common symptoms in the paediatric population. The etiology of nausea and vomiting is often age-
dependent,  with  a  wide  spectrum  of  gastrointestinal,  non-gastrointestinal,  and  environmental  causes, 
including use of medications.   
Regarding depression and suicidality, higher reporting percentages were observed for suicidal ideation and 
suicidal attempt in the paediatric population and more specifically in the adolescent sub-population than in 
the adult population. However, this is to be considered in the light of higher background rates of suicidal 
ideation and suicide attempt in adolescents in the general population. An enhanced wording is suggested 
in the proposed product information to increase the awareness regarding this subpopulation at risk.  
Long-term  impact  on  children  and  adolescents,  including  growth  and  neurocognitive  development  is 
considered  missing  information  for  the  paediatric  population.  As  of  today,  the  review  of  post  marketing 
data did not highlight evidence for adverse effects related to possible long-term impact. 
A  total  of  9  relevant  articles  were  reviewed  in  the  successive  PSURs.  The  authors  highlighted  good 
tolerability of sodium oxybate used in children. No additional relevant articles were identified since the last 
PSUR data lock point.  
The  current  reference  information  and  educational  materials  provide  adequate  wording  to  minimize  the 
known risks. The suggested updates targeting the paediatric population aim at enhancing and reinforcing 
the  information  to  paediatric  patients  and  their  caregivers  for  specific  safety  concerns  of  interest  in  this 
population. 
In  summary,  the  present  cumulative  analysis  supports  the  use  of  sodium  oxybate  in  the  treatment  of 
narcolepsy with cataplexy in the paediatric population 7 to <18 years of age. 
Literature data 
The  topic  of  sodium  oxybate  use  in  paediatric  population  was  considered  as  missing  information  in  the 
periodic  safety  update  reports  (PSUR)  completed  following  the  good  pharmacovigilance  practice  module 
VII. 
The reviewed articles in these PSURs are summarised below. No additional relevant articles were identified 
since the last PSUR data lock point. 
A total of 9 relevant articles were identified in these PSURs: 
In  Aran  et  al  (2010),  the  authors  retrospectively  studied  symptoms  and  therapies  used  in  childhood 
narcolepsy-cataplexy (51 patients). The second most used treatment was sodium oxybate (79%) and they 
concluded that treatments commonly used in adults are safe in young children. Irritability was a common 
side  effect  of  sodium  oxybate.  This  side  effect  was  also  more  commonly  reported  in  prepubertal  versus 
older children (p<0.01). Nausea and weight loss were the most commonly reported side effects for sodium 
oxybate in all groups. Sodium oxybate had more side effects in prepubertal versus older children (p=0.058), 
and  a  larger  number  of  prepubertal  children  stopped  this  medication  due  to  side  effects  (18%),  in 
comparison  with  in  older  children  (0%).  The  authors  found  no  effects  of  sodium  oxybate  treatment  in 
prepubertal children on the occurrence of subsequent puberty. Indeed, of 11 children who started sodium 
oxybate prior to puberty, 4 have undergone puberty (1 girl, 3 boys, average age at puberty 12 years), and 
7 are still prepubertal (4 girls, 3 boys; average current age, 11.6 years). The average age at puberty of the 
4 subjects who have been treated all along with sodium oxybate (12 years) is similar to that of all other 
children (12.2 years). 
The  retrospective  study  of  Lecendreux  and  colleagues,  documents  the  good  efficacy  and  tolerability  of 
sodium oxybate in 27 European children (6-16 years) suffering from narcolepsy with cataplexy (Lecendreux 
Assessment report

et  al,  2012).  The  main  side  effects  included  weight  loss,  headache,  nausea,  disturbed  nocturnal  sleep, 
irritability, parasomnias (sleepwalking, sleep talking, enuresis), and/or daily episodes of sleep drunkenness. 
The above side effects were not considered severe enough by either clinicians and patients (or parents) to 
withdraw sodium oxybate. Interestingly, the reason for withdrawal was never a lack of efficacy; in 4 patients 
(14.8%) a complete sodium oxybate withdrawal was necessary because of important side effects (sleep 
loss, n=2; persistent nausea, n=2). 
A  retrospective  study  was  conducted  by  Mansukhani  and  colleagues  in  15  children  (<18  years)  with 
narcolepsy.  The  safety  of  sodium  oxybate  as  a  treatment  for  narcolepsy  and/or  cataplexy  in  paediatrics 
was evaluated for 33 months after initiation. Adverse reactions were observed in 40% of patients including: 
constipation, dissociative feelings, tremor, blurring of vision, nocturnal awakening, dizziness and increased 
nightmares (Mansukhani et al, 2012). 
Lewelt  et  al  (2012)  investigated  the  safety,  tolerability,  dosage,  and  effect  of  sodium  oxybate  on  ictal 
episodes in children with alternating hemiplegia of childhood. The impact of treatment with sodium oxybate 
in children with AHC was difficult to interpret. Administration of sodium oxybate on an as needed basis to 
abort  alternating  hemiplegia  of  childhood  episodes  proved  ineffective  or  poorly  tolerated  in  most  with 
prolonged  use.  However,  2  children  remained  on  medication  due  to  long-term  benefits  of  decreased 
alternating hemiplegia of childhood episode duration and severity. 
A case report by Berner (2013) described sodium oxybate intolerance in a 10-year-old boy (case number 
083235)  associated  with  a  familial  serum  acylcarnitine  elevation  who  experienced  severe  hyperphagic 
episodes and progressive chronic widespread pain. The author acknowledged that there is no direct proof 
that metabolic disturbance implied by the observed serological abnormalities directly causes oxybate/GHB 
intolerance. 
A paper by Joshi et al (2015) set out to demonstrate the co-existence of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and 
narcolepsy  that  raised  the  possibility  of  a  shared  genetic  predisposition  to  both  conditions.  The  authors 
mentioned  that  stimulants,  selective  serotonin  receptor  inhibitors,  and/or  sodium  oxybate  were  used  to 
successfully treat their patients’ narcolepsy. 
The  review  by  Babiker  and  Klrasad  (2015)  summarises  the  pathophysiology,  clinical  features,  and 
management options for children with narcolepsy. Sodium oxybate is mentioned as one of the treatment 
options. It improves both daytime sleepiness and cataplexy and is the only Food and Drug Administration 
approved medication for treatment of cataplexy for age 16 and older. 
In a publication by Kacar Bayram et al (2016), the authors studied 5 unrelated consecutive children with 
narcolepsy, focusing on clinical and laboratory features, the therapy and outcome over the 33-month follow-
up period. The study subjects included 2 boys and 3 girls. The mean age at diagnosis was 11.8±3.3 years 
(range: 8–16 years). Three patients had cataplexy. There were no hypnagogic hallucinations and/or sleep 
paralysis in any patients. All patients were educated about sleep hygiene, appropriate nutrition, and regular 
exercise. Three patients were treated with modafinil, while 2 patients received methylphenidate. Sodium 
oxybate was added to existing treatment in patients with cataplexy. Cataplexy attacks did not improve due 
to  the  treatment  in  1  patient,  therefore  intravenous  immunoglobulin  therapy  was  given.  The  authors 
concluded  that  early  diagnosis  is  important  to  help  narcoleptic  patients  in  improving  their  quality  of  life 
(QoL).  A  combination  of  pharmacological  treatment  and  nondrug  interventions  can  greatly  improve 
children’s clinical symptoms (Kacar Bayram et al, 2016). 
One relevant publication described AEs in paediatric population (Zvosec and Cole, 2017). This retrospective 
review was conducted of de-identified National Poison Data System (NPDS) data on exposures involving 
any/all GHB analogues and formulations, including Xyrem, from 2002 to 2015. 
Data included demographics, co-ingestants, clinical effects, and therapies. Of 973 total exposures, 72 (7%) 
were  paediatric  cases  (ages  8  months  to  17  years),  including  66  Xyrem-only.  Of  72  paediatric  cases, 
Assessment report

reasons  for  exposure  were  the  following:  31(43%)  Unintentional-General;  21(29%)  Unintentional-
Therapeutic  Error  (ages  8  months  to  17  years,  including  10  children  ≤12  years);  eight  (11%)  Adverse 
Reaction-Drug; six (8.5%) Intentional-Abuse (ages 9–16 years); three (4%) Intentional-Suspected Suicide 
(ages  15–17  years);  two  (3%)  Unknown;  and  one  (1.5%)  Intentional-Misuse.  Three  children  ≤3  years 
exhibited Major Effects including bradycardia (1), respiratory depression (2), vomiting (2), coma (2), and 
two were intubated and ventilated. The review of these articles did not identify a specific safety concern 
related to the use of sodium oxybate in paediatric population. 
Conclusion 
Sodium oxybate is currently indicated in the treatment of narcolepsy with cataplexy in adults. A total of 
3919 safety case reports related to post marketing use of sodium oxybate in patients 7 to <18 years of age 
were identified in the UCB Global Safety database. Due to the nature of spontaneous reporting, there are 
some recognised limitations to the search strategies used, mainly due to lack of reported information. 
The presented cumulative review characterises the safety of paediatric patients exposed to sodium oxybate. 
Overall, the safety profile in the paediatric population is qualitatively similar to the safety profile in the adult 
population. Among the most frequently reported PTs in the paediatric population (>2%), 17 are also among 
the most frequently reported ones in the adult population (>2%), showing considerable overlap between 
the  two  age  groups,  particularly  among  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs.  Overall,  13  clinical  PTs  were 
more frequently reported in paediatrics than in adult population, classified from the highest to the lowest 
difference  in  reporting:  Vomiting,  Nausea,  Decreased  appetite,  Somnolence,  Abdominal  pain  upper, 
Nasopharyngitis, Cataplexy, Weight decreased, Cough, Headache, Somnambulism and Dizziness. 
Most of the frequently reported AEs are usually known to occur in the paediatric population, as they could 
be  related  to  childhood  development.  Enuresis  is  a  typical  childhood  disorder  and  sodium  oxybate  likely 
contributes  to  its  re-emergence  by  promoting  deep  sleep.  Aggression  is  also  considered  a  frequent 
behaviour  in  young  developing  children.  Somnambulism  is  also  known  to  be  more  common  in  young 
children and has been shown to decrease markedly by early adolescence. Nausea and vomiting are very 
common  symptoms  in  the  paediatric  population.  The  aetiology  of  nausea  and  vomiting  is  often  age-
dependent,  with  a  wide  spectrum  of  gastrointestinal,  non-gastrointestinal,  and  environmental  causes, 
including use of medications.   
Regarding depression and suicidality, higher reporting percentages were observed for suicidal ideation and 
suicidal attempt in the paediatric population and more specifically in the adolescent sub-population than in 
the adult population. However, this is to be considered in the light of higher background rates of suicidal 
ideation and suicide attempt in adolescents in the general population. An enhanced wording is suggested 
in the proposed product information to increase the awareness regarding this subpopulation at risk.  
Long-term  impact  on  children  and  adolescents,  including  growth  and  neurocognitive  development  is 
considered  missing  information  for  the  paediatric  population.  As  of  today,  the  review  of  post  marketing 
data did not highlight evidence for adverse effects related to possible long-term impact. 
A  total  of  9  relevant  articles  were  reviewed  in  the  successive  PSURs.  The  authors  highlighted  good 
tolerability of sodium oxybate used in children. No additional relevant articles were identified since the last 
PSUR data lock point.  
The  current  reference  information  and  educational  materials  provide  adequate  wording  to  minimize  the 
known risks. The suggested updates targeting the paediatric population aim at enhancing and reinforcing 
the  information  to  paediatric  patients  and  their  caregivers  for  specific  safety  concerns  of  interest  in  this 
population.

In summary, the present cumulative analysis could support the use of sodium oxybate in the treatment of 
narcolepsy with cataplexy in the paediatric population 7 to <18 years of age. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data encompasses that obtained from the paediatric study 13-005, the paediatric adverse drug 
reactions spontaneously reported for the post-marketing (non-labelled use) and publicly published data. 
Study 13-005 
The presented study 13-005, across all treatment periods did not provide robust longterm data in the 
Paediatric population. Thus, there was a need for the detailed assessment of available post marketing 
data. 
In the Study 13-005, across all treatment periods, a total of 74/104 subjects (71.2%) reported TEAEs 
while on Xyrem, the majority of which were non-serious and mild or moderate in severity. TEAEs were 
reported by a total of 75.7% of subjects 7 to 11 years of age and 68.7% of subjects 12 to 17 years of 
age. TEAEs were reported by 76.4% of Xyrem naïve subjects and 62.5% of subjects on Xyrem at study 
entry. The most frequently reported TEAEs during treatment with Xyrem were Enuresis, Nausea, 
Headache, Vomiting, and Weight decreased. All of these events were consistent with what has been 
observed in adult subjects treated with Xyrem, although Enuresis and Vomiting were reported more 
frequently in paediatric subjects. There were no deaths. Two treatment emergent SAEs (Suicidal ideation 
and Acute psychosis) were reported during the study. Both events have been reported in studies of 
Xyrem in adult narcolepsy and during postmarketing experience.  
Five subjects experienced TEAEs leading to withdrawal from the study (Hallucination, tactile; Suicidal 
ideation; Weight decreased; Sleep apnoea syndrome; and Affect lability). A low incidence of TEAEs 
occurred in the individual categories of special interest (which were Confusion, Somnolence, Respiratory 
depression, Depressed mood and suicidality, Anxiety, Sleepwalking and other parasomnias, and Weight 
loss). Adverse events of special interest observed in paediatric subjects were also observed in the adult 
narcolepsy population treated with Xyrem. 
No event of abuse or misuse was reported; however, 2 subjects were terminated early from the study 
because of treatment non-compliance. A decreasing trend in body weight and BMI percentile was 
observed during the study while height percentile remained relatively stable. There was no clear 
relationship between TEAEs of weight loss and concurrent GI-related events. 
Overall, safety assessments conducted during Study 13-005 have shown that Xyrem was tolerated by 
studied paediatric subjects with narcolepsy. The types of TEAEs that occurred in this study were similar to 
previous reports in studies of narcolepsy in adults. No new safety concerns with regard to death, SAEs, or 
other significant AEs were identified. However, the study was short limited and no impact on cognition 
and learning was studied. 
UCB Global Safety database  
Using the DLP of 31 Jan 2018, total of 3919 safety case reports related to postmarketing use of sodium 
oxybate in patients 7 to <18 years of age were identified in the UCB Global Safety database. Overall, the 
safety profile in the paediatric population is qualitatively similar to the safety profile in the adult 
population. Therefore, the cumulative analysis supports the use of sodium oxybate in the treatment of 
narcolepsy with cataplexy in the paediatric population 7 to <18 years of age.  
This assessment of safety has not identified new important risks in adults and children/adolescents 
regarding the use of sodium oxybate. The Applicant proposed additional wordings in both SmPC and 
educational materials to characterise those risks in the paediatric population exposed to sodium oxybate.

Regarding possible negative effects of Xyrem on neurodevelopment, the MAH analysed post-marketing 
safety data (3919 safety case reports in patients 7 to <18 years, plus information from the JAZZ 
database in US plus published literature involving pediatric off-label use).  There were 52 events 
suggestive of memory impairment (1 case reported as serious), 4 events suggestive of mental 
impairment, and 26 events suggestive of disturbance in attention (2 cases reported as serious). No 
particular pattern could be identified with respect to action taken with sodium oxybate and the outcomes 
of the events. A few reports suggested that there was an impact on schooling and activities of daily living, 
however it is difficult to differentiate the causal role of sodium oxybate from patient’s underlying 
narcolepsy. Cumulative AE reporting rate in pediatric patients was consistent with that in adult patients 
when Xyrem was used off-label in pediatric patients (JAZZ database in US). 
study 13-005 had no safety signal for negative neurodevelopmental impact. The neuropsychiatric adverse 
events (AEs) of special interest included confusion, somnolence, depressed mood and suicidality, anxiety, 
sleepwalking and other parasomnias, and abuse and misuse of study drug. 
the topic of Neurotoxicity was raised in the PRAC assessment report on PSUR No.9 (covering the period 
13 Oct 2011 to 12 Oct 2012) following the publication of a study on the long-term effect of sodium 
oxybate on neurotoxicity (which is related to neurodegeneration that could lead to symptoms of 
dementia). The EMA concluded that there is insufficient evidence to promote a change in the reference 
safety information. However, the PRAC recommended to review data related to memory problems, 
cognition impairments, movement disorders, convulsion/epilepsy, speech or sensory problems, and 
behavior changes in general, as the consequences of possible neurotoxicity of sodium oxybate were not 
limited to dementia and related conditions. The revised data did not support an increased risk of 
neurotoxicity and brain damage over time and repeated exposure. 
The MAH acknowledges that longitudinal research assessing neurodevelopment using age-appropriate 
standardized assessment tools in large cohorts of paediatric patients is still lacking. The existing evidence 
on the consequences of this condition is also not homogeneous as different outcomes and tools have been 
used. Some circumstances such as the low prevalence of narcolepsy and diagnostic delay may contribute 
to this lack of scientific evidence. 
The MAH also considers that there is no consensus with respect to which cognitive domains should be 
assessed and the most adequate tools to do it. Most patients are first treated or frequently co-treated 
with other medications (approximately 50% of patients in study 13-005 were taking concomitant CNS 
stimulant medications) that are known to also impact in this domain and limit the interpretability of any 
findings. For all these reasons, the CHMP agreed that is not feasible to conduct a dedicated study for 
appraisal of cognition and learning and that Routine Pharmacovigilance methods (ADR collection) is the 
most appropriate and feasible for the appraisal of neurodevelopment. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The presented safety data supports use of Oxybate in paediatric patients. The identified safety issues can 
be mitigated by adequately implemented measures as described in Risk Management Plan.

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Narcolepsy type 1 is a life-long multifaceted disease often arising in childhood or adolescence. It affects 
0.02% to 0.067% of the paediatric population. Young patients affected by the disorder often show dramatic 
and  abrupt  impairments  in  many  domains  because  of  EDS,  fatigue,  and  lack  of  energy,  including  social 
skills and academic performance. The symptoms of paediatric narcolepsy show very similar expression to 
that  seen  in  adults.  The  symptoms  are  frequently  associated  with  metabolic,  cardiovascular,  and 
neuropsychiatric comorbidities, as well as other sleep pathologies. As in adults, paediatric narcolepsy may 
show a great deal of variability in its presentation. 
Narcolepsy with cataplexy has a dramatic impact on the quality of life in children and adolescents: sleep 
attacks and waxing and waning drowsiness affect attention span and school performance, which may 
result in school failure. Moreover, frequent cataplexy, generalised hypotonia, mood variability, and 
irritability may severely impact social life, leading to poor social integration. Therefore, the burden of this 
disorder in children is higher than in adults. Consequently, an early diagnosis with appropriate treatment, 
is fundamental to allow children or adolescents with narcolepsy to reach a normal school performance and 
to reduce social impairment. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are no currently approved treatments and there is no accepted standard of care for paediatric patients 
who have narcolepsy with cataplexy. Treatments used in practice have not been proven to be consistently 
efficacious.  
The lack of approved treatments for paediatric narcolepsy with cataplexy, highlights an unmet medical need 
for paediatric patients.  
Sodium  oxybate,  has  been  marketed  for  16  years,  and  the  efficacy  in  the  adult  population  has  been 
established, with a number of studies. There are also some reports of off-label use in children. 
The current claimed indication for Xyrem is as a treatment of paediatric patients aged 7 years and older 
in Narcolepsy with cataplexy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 86/92 
 
  
  
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study  OMC-SXB-21,  a  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  randomised-withdrawal  design  study  provided 
some insights into the magnitude of effect that could be seen in adults with narcolepsy with cataplexy.  
Using the same design, Study 13-005 was conducted in adolescents and children from 7 years to 17 years 
of age.  Given the small population size and the rarity of the disease, the choice of this study design was 
deemed appropriate, to ensure minimal exposure to placebo for a vulnerable population. 
The original trail design had a Double-Blind Treatment Period (2 weeks) that followed an open-label Dose-
Titration Period (of up to 10 weeks) and a Stable-Dose Period (3 weeks). Following a preplanned interim 
analysis, which demonstrated positive efficacy results on the primary efficacy endpoint of 35 patients having 
completed  or  discontinued  from  the  Double-Blind  Treatment  Period  of  the  protocol,  the  protocol  was 
amended (Amendment 4) to replace the placebo treatment in the Double-Blind Treatment Period with open-
label sodium oxybate treatment. After Amendment 4 became effective, all patients entering the Double-
Blind Treatment Period received open-label sodium oxybate treatment. This study also included an Open-
Label Safety extension allowing patients to continue sodium oxybate treatment for up to 1 year with a PK 
evaluation in a subset of patients. This period was further enhanced up to 2 years following Amendment 5 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Paediatric subjects on stable doses of sodium oxybate who were withdrawn from sodium oxybate 
treatment and randomised to Placebo during the Double-blind Treatment Period experienced: 
a)  a significant increase in weekly cataplexy attacks  
b)  a statistically significant worsening in CGIc scores for cataplexy severity, ESS (CHAD) score and 
CGIc scores for narcolepsy overall 
compared to subjects who were randomised to continue treatment with sodium oxybate. 
The median change from baseline in the weekly number of cataplexy attacks remained fairly stable 
throughout the duration of the Open-Label Safety Period (i.e., up to 52 weeks).  
Similar results were observed for the subgroups based on age and sodium oxybate status at study entry.  
When considering the magnitude of effect observed by the median values for the weekly number of 
cataplexy attacks in the adult study and the paediatric study, the data from the paediatric study can be 
considered comparable to the adult data.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The main uncertainties regarding the paediatric results relate to the small sample size. Nevertheless, 
considering the rarity of the condition and comparing to the adult data that supported adult indication, it 
seems reasonable to accept this limitation.  
Patients who withdraw from sodium oxybate to placebo experienced significant deterioration of their 
condition as measured in the endpoints evaluated in the trial. However, patients who continued to be 
given sodium oxybate also had a deterioration in their condition (except for some endpoints for which 
Assessment report  
EMA/82865/2021 
Page 87/92 
 
  
  
 
there was no significant change from baseline) as measured by the same endpoints. Probably this is 
related to the condition progression. 
Another limitation is the lack of data on treatment suspension and impact on the control of the condition. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the Study 13-005, across all treatment periods, a total of 74/104 subjects (71.2%) reported TEAEs 
while on Xyrem, the majority of which were non-serious and mild or moderate in severity. TEAEs were 
reported by a total of 75.7% of subjects 7 to 11 years of age and 68.7% of subjects 12 to 17 years of 
age. TEAEs were reported by 76.4% of Xyrem naïve subjects and 62.5% of subjects on Xyrem at study 
entry. The most frequently reported TEAEs during treatment with Xyrem were Enuresis, Nausea, 
Headache, Vomiting, and Weight decreased. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The study 13-005 did not provide robust long-term data. 
One of the main concerns of the chronic use of this drug would be on the impact on growth and 
psychological development throughout infancy and adolescence. This is one of the topics listed in the Risk 
Management Plan.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The effectiveness of sodium oxybate treatment of paediatric patients who have narcolepsy with cataplexy 
was demonstrated by decreased change from baseline in weekly number of cataplexy attacks as well as 
key secondary and other endpoints: cataplexy severity (as assessed by the CGIc) and ESS (CHAD).  The 
results for the main analyses were consistent across sensitivity and subgroup analyses, and effects were 
maintained for up to 1 year. Furthermore, the response to Xyrem observed in paediatric subjects was 
similar to that observed in adults.

Safety assessments have shown that Xyrem was tolerated by paediatric subjects. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs during treatment with Xyrem were enuresis, nausea, headache, vomiting, and weight 
decreased. All of these events were consistent with what has been observed in adult subjects treated with 
Xyrem, although Enuresis and Vomiting were reported more frequently in paediatric subjects. No new 
safety concerns with regard to death, SAEs, or other significant AEs were identified. The identified safety 
issues can be mitigated by measures as described in Risk Management Plan 
Overall, the efficacy, safety and PK results demonstrated in paediatric subjects with narcolepsy in this 
study were consistent with those previously observed in adults. The totality of evidence including data 
from the adult studies and published literature supplement the results observed in Study 13-005. In the 
current landscape, where no licensed treatments exist for paediatric patients with narcolepsy with 
cataplexy, and the significant impact this has on their quality of life, the availability of sodium has 
potential to address this unmet medical need and ensure children or adolescents with narcolepsy could 
reach a normal school performance and reduce social impairment, thus positively impacting their quality 
of life. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
When balancing all the favourable and unfavourable effects described above it is considered that the 
results point to a favourable effect of sodium oxybate in paediatric patients with narcolepsy with 
cataplexy.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
NA 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Xyrem is positive in adolescents and children older than 7 years old.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following amended conditions:  
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation 
Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in 
accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) ) provided for 
under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures  
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall develop an educational programme for Xyrem to ensure 
that physicians who intend to prescribe Xyrem are aware about the posology of Xyrem and the important 
risks. The five components of this comprehensive program are: 
•  Healthcare Professional Checklist (i.e. forms for treatment initiation and follow-up visits) to 
remind physicians to check the following:  
a.  Contraindications, warnings, and precautions in the SmPC and specifically highlighting 
that Xyrem can cause CNS and respiratory depression, that alcohol may result in the 
potentiation of CNS depression and that Xyrem has an abuse potential 
b.  For paediatric patients: height, weight, learning, social and psychiatric behaviour 
• 
• 
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for patients (to be given to the patient): to provide patients 
with responses to some questions they might have about taking Xyrem. 
Patient instructions for administration of sodium oxybate (to be given to the patient): to provide 
patients with information related to the use of Xyrem. 
•  Xyrem guide for paediatric patients and their caregivers to provide information about the safe use 
and handling of sodium oxybate

• 
Patient Alert Card (to be given to the patient): to remind patients, caregivers, and physicians of 
the important safety information related to the use of Xyrem. 
The MAH has established a controlled distribution program that enhances existing controls for Xyrem to 
allow reaching the intended population of narcolepsy patients while minimizing the risk of Xyrem being 
diverted by those seeking to misuse it. 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures  
N/A 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the

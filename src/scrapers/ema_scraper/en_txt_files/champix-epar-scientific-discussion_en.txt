SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1. 
Introduction 
The claimed indication for CHAMPIX (varenicline) 0.5 mg and 1 mg film-coated tablets is smoking 
cessation in adults.  
Varenicline is a highly selective partial agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α4β2 subtype. In 
animal  models,  the  α4β2  nicotinic  receptor  has  been  shown  to  be  responsible  for  the  reinforcing 
properties of nicotine. Both nicotine and varenicline bind to this receptor subtype. Binding of nicotine 
to  this  receptor  subtype  causes  dopamine  release  in  the  mesolimbic  “reward”  system  (nucleus. 
accumbens).  It  is  hypothesized  that  varenicline,  a  partial  agonist,  blocks  the  full-agonist  activity  of 
nicotine by competitive binding. As varenicline has this partial agonistic action it may cause relief of 
withdrawal  and  craving  symptoms.  Withdrawal  and  craving  symptoms  are  thought  to  maintain 
nicotine addiction, and diminishing these symptoms would promote smoking cessation.  
The  European  Commission  has  estimated  that  more  than  650,000  (i.e.  1  in  7)  Europeans  die 
prematurely every year due to smoking related diseases while an additional 13 million suffer from a 
serious,  chronic  disease  as  a  result  of  smoking.  The  economic  burden  due  to  smoking  was  in  EU 
conservatively estimated at 98-130 billion Euros per year or between 1.04% and 1.39% of the region’s 
Gross Domestic Product for 2000.  
According to World Bank estimates the number of smokers worldwide exceeded 1.3 billion in 2003.  
The worldwide prevalence of smoking was estimated at 47% of men and 10% of women.  Smoking 
prevalence  overall  and  by  gender  varies  by  country  and/or  region).    In  2002-2003,  the  average 
prevalence of adult smoking in the 25 EU member states was 29% overall, 35% for men and 22% for 
women. Reducing the current smoking rate by 50% would avoid 20-30 million premature deaths in the 
first quarter of this century. 
Population-based surveys in the United States and United Kingdom indicate that approximately 70% 
of smokers say they are interested in giving up smoking. Reports indicate that 35% to 45% of smokers 
actually  try  to  abstain  each  year  but  only  3.5%  succeed  without  assistance.    Relapse  within  days  to 
weeks  is  common  and  most  smokers  make  multiple  attempts  to  stop,  often  waiting  2  to  3  years 
between attempts.   
Nicotine  has  affinity  for  the  nicotinic cholinergic  receptors,  which  are  widely  spread  throughout  the 
brain,  the  autonomic  ganglia,  and  the  neuromuscular  junction.  The  natural  ligand  for  the  receptor  is 
acetylcholine. Nicotine may exert both stimulating and inhibiting effects upon different organ systems. 
Nicotine use induces arterial constriction and affects the cardiovascular tone; nicotine induces nausea 
in naïve subjects  and  may induce  metabolic changes (hyperglycaemia). Its addictive properties arise 
from its pre-synaptic actions influencing neurotransmitter release in the brain (dopamine release in the 
nucleus accumbens reward system). The craving and withdrawal symptoms, which include depressed 
mood,  irritability,  difficulty  concentrating,  restlessness,  increased  appetite,  and  sleep  disturbance, 
cause significant distress to the smoker and threaten the quit attempt 
Current pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation are presently various forms of nicotine replacement 
therapy (NRT) and the non-nicotinic agent, sustained release bupropion.  Meta-analyses of controlled 
clinical trials have consistently shown that both NRT (any form) and bupropion approximately double 
the odds of smoking cessation compared with placebo.

Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Champix  is  presented  as  immediate  release  film-coated  tablets  containing  0.5  mg  and  1  mg  of 
varenicline  (as  varenicline  tartrate)  as  active  substance.  The  other  ingredients  are  cellulose, 
microcrystalline,  calcium  hydrogen  phosphate,  anhydrous,  croscarmellose  sodium,  silica,  colloidal 
anhydrous and magnesium stearate. The film consists of hypromellose, titanium dioxide, macrogols, 
Purified Water and colorants. 
The  film-coated  tablets  are  marketed  either  in  opaque  blue-white  HDPE  bottle  with  an  aluminum 
foil/polyethylene  induction  seal  and  a  child-resistant  polypropylene  closure  or  in  clear  PVC  /  Aclar 
film with an aluminum foil backing. 
Active substance 
The drug substance is varenicline as varenicline tartrate and its chemical name is 7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-
6,10-methano-6H-azepino[4,5-g]quinoxaline (2R,3R)-tartrate according to the IUPAC nomenclature. 
Varenicline  tartrate  is  white  to  off-white  to  slightly  yellow  solid  and  is  non-hygroscopic.  It  is 
moderately  soluble  in  dimethylacetamide,  acetronitrile,  methanol,  hexane  and  ethyl  acetate. 
Varenicline freebase is an achiral molecule, however varenicline tartrate, which is formed through the 
reaction  of  varenicline  freebase  and  L-tartaric  acid  is  optically  active,  and  has  the  absolute 
configuration of the counter ion 2R, 3R. 
•  Manufacture 
Varenicline is synthesised in six chemical steps followed by purification (filtration) and milling. 
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  adequately  described.  Critical  parameters  have  been  identified 
and adequate in-process controls included. 
Specifications  for  starting  materials,  reagents,  catalysts  and  solvents  have  been  provided.  Adequate 
control of critical steps and intermediates have been presented. 
Structure elucidation has been performed by infrared absorption spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, 1H-
NMR spectroscopy, 13C-NMR spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy and optical 
rotation spectroscopy, and these data confirm the structure of the active substance. The established 
structure of varenicline tartrate was in agreement with the method of synthesis, analytical and 
spectroscopic data.   The molecular weight determined by mass spectroscopy was in agreement with 
the expected molecular weight.  Definite proof of structure was provided by X-ray crystallography.   
• 
Specification 
The active substance specifications include test for Appearance (Visual Inspection), identification (IR 
and HPLC), assay (98.00 – 102% HPLC), tartaric acid content (HPLC), water content (Karl Fisher), 
Residue on Ignition, heavy metals, residual solvents (GC) Impurities (HPLC) and  particle size. 
The specifications reflect all relevant quality attributes of the active substance. The analytical methods 
which were used in the routine controls were described and their validations are in accordance with the 
ICH Guidelines.  Impurities have been extensively described, classified as process related impurities 
and possible degradation products, and qualified. Furthermore, some of the genotoxic impurities were 
reduced resulting in levels in the active substance in accordance with CHMP Guideline on the Limits 
of Genotoxic Impurities. Residual solvents have been satisfactorily controlled in the active substance. 
Limits are in accordance with ICH requirements. Batch analysis results for the active substance

Stability 
The stability results from long-term accelerated and stress studies which were completed according to 
ICH guidelines demonstrated adequate stability of the active substance. It was confirmed that the 
active substance is very stable when exposed to a variety of stressed conditions such as acid, base, 
oxidation, thermal, humidity and light exposure. The results of the long-term and accelerated studies 
support the retest period.

Pharmaceutical Development 
All information regarding the choice of the drug substance as a tartaric acid salt and the excipients are 
sufficiently justified. Well known excipients were used in the formulation, selected based on their 
suitability for use in a dry granulation process. Microcrystalline cellulose is used as a diluent and 
binder, anhydrous calcium hydrogen phosphate as a diluent, croscarmellose sodium as a disintegrant, 
anhydrous colloidal silica as a glidant and magnesium stearate as lubricant.  The compatibility of the 
active substance was demonstrated with the results of stability studies performed on the finished 
product. 
A film-coating system was added and the tablet shape was changed to capsular tablet shape. In order 
to differentiate the two strengths the colorant use in the film-coating system was slightly different.  
The bioequivalence studies which were performed confirmed bioequivalence between the commercial 
tablets (1 mg) and the phase 3 tablets, as well as between phase 3 tablets and phase 2B tablets (tartrate 
salt) and phase 2A tablets (succinate salt). The same core formulation (common blend) has been used 
for the 0.5 mg tablets as has been used for the 1 mg tablets.  
Comparative  dissolution  profiles  are  presented  for  the  two  strengths  of  six  primary  stability  batches 
manufactured  by  the  site.  All  batches  demonstrated  similar  dissolution  profiles  with  nearly  100  % 
dissolved after 5 minutes. 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  involves  standard  technology  using  standard 
manufacturing  process  such  as  blending,  milling  (deagglomeration),  roller  compaction  and  milling, 
compression,  aqueous-based  film-coating  unit  operations.  Furthermore  the  equipment  used  is 
commonly available in the pharmaceutical industry. A dry granulation process was selected based on 
the  improved  process  robustness  gained  by  the  resulting  properties  of  the  granulate,  including 
improvements to flow and drug uniformity. 
The process validation scheme for manufacture commercial batches was provided.  
The  batch  analysis  results  show  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly 
according the agreed finished product specifications. 
• 
Product Specification 
The drug product specifications were established according the ICH guidelines and include the 
following tests: appearance, identification (TLC and HPLC), content per tablet of the active substance 
(HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph Eur), disintegration (Ph Eur), water content (Ph Eur), 
individual degradation products (HPLC), microbial limits (Ph Eur). 
All analytical procedures which were used for testing the drug product were properly described. 
Moreover, all relevant methods were satisfactorily validated in accordance with the CHMP and ICH 
guidelines. 
The batch analysis data obtained from the analysis of six batches for each strength manufactured by 
the commercial manufacturing process confirmed satisfactory uniformity of the product at release.

Stability of the Product 
The stability studies were conducted according to the ICH guideline. Three production scale batches 
of each strength have been stored at long term and accelerated conditions in the proposed market 
packaging. 
One production batch per strength was stored under elevated temperature and humidity conditions for 
3 months and at ICH photostability conditions and degradation conditions. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC 
are acceptable.  
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture, control of the active substance and the finished product 
have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in accordance with relevant Guidelines. The 
results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of the finished product. 
Therefore, this medicinal product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues which do 
not have impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the medicinal product. The applicant gave a letter of 
undertaking and committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within the 
agreed timeframe. 
3. 
Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The  non-clinical  programme  is  in  reasonable  agreement  with  EU/ICH  guidelines.  The  majority  of 
safety pharmacology studies were not conducted in compliance with GLP-regulations. The toxicology 
studies  were  GLP-compliant.  As  several  pivotal  toxicokinetic  bioanalyses  were  performed  by  a 
laboratory not listed in the Cumulative Overview of GLP inspections in OECD Member countries of 
2001, its GLP-status was verified by the EMEA.  
Pharmacology 
In  vitro  varenicline  displayed  high  affinity  for  the  rat  cortex  α4β2  nicotine  receptor  in  radioligand 
displacement binding assays with a Ki value of 0.17 nM.  It is believed that the nicotinic α4β2 receptor 
mediates dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and thus is involved in the motivational effects 
of  smoking.  Both  nicotine  and  varenicline  both  reversibly  bind  to  the  same  receptor  binding  site. 
Considering the 15-fold higher affinity of varenicline for the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor as 
compared  with  nicotine,  very  high  nicotine  brain  concentrations  would  be  required  to  fully  displace 
varenicline and produce nicotine rewarding in the subject. 
Ex  vivo,  varenicline  only  partially  activates  the  mesolimbic  dopamine  system,  in  comparison  to 
activation  induced  by  nicotine:  varenicline  released  3H-dopamine  from  rat  striatal  slices  with  a 
maximal  response  of  51%  (relative  to  the  release  evoked  by  nicotine)  at  1  μM,  indicating  that 
varenicline  acts  as  a  partial  agonist  at  the  nicotinic  acetylcholine  receptor.  Additionally,  10  µM 
varenicline reduced the response induced by nicotine by 53%, down to levels induced by varenicline. 
An  EC50  value  of  3.5  μM  was  obtained  for  varenicline  in  HEK293  cells  expressing  human  α4β2 
receptors. The maximal effect of varenicline was 43% of what was observed for nicotine. Concurrent 
application of 10 μM varenicline and nicotine reduced the inward current by 53% at steady state. 
In  vivo  microdialysis  showed  that  p.o  varenicline  treatment  caused  moderate  increases  in  dopamine 
release  in  the  nucleus  accumbens  of  freely  moving  rats.  Maximal  extracellular  dopamine 
concentrations were reached 2 hours following dosing and the level started to normalise 4 to 5 hours 
after varenicline administration. The maximal dopamine response of varenicline was around 63% of 
the full agonist nicotine.

In  drug  discrimination  studies,  varenicline  (0.01-1  mg/kg  p.o.)  dose-dependently  generalized  to 
nicotine,  with  complete  generalization  at  1  mg/kg.  However  in  self-administration  studies,  rats  self-
administered  varenicline  significantly  less  than  nicotine,  demonstrating  that  varenicline  is  not  as 
reinforcing as nicotine. Furthermore, varenicline pretreatment (1-3 mg kg s.c.) reduced the amount of 
nicotine by 50% that rats self-administered.  
Varenicline  displayed  binding  affinity  towards  the  5-HT3A-receptor  subunit  with  a  Ki  value  of  350 
nM.  The  Ki  for  HT3A  is  approximately  10-fold  higher  then  the  human  Cmax.  The  HT3-receptor  is 
involved  in  the  mediation  of  nausea/emesis  and  irritable  bowel;  symptoms  which  are  observed 
clinically  during  varenicline  treatment.  According  to  the  Applicant,  varenicline  could  cause  emesis 
peripherally  by  affecting  afferent  signaling  pathways  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract  to  the  emetic 
center  in  the  mid-brainstem,  most  likely  by  activation  of  5-HT3  receptors  and/or  α3β4  nAChRs. 
Furthermore,  varenicline  could  possibly  have  a  central  action  that  contributes  to  emesis  through  the 
activation of α4β2 nAChRs in brain nuclei that control the activity of the emetic center. 
• 
Secondary pharmacodynamics and safety pharmacology  
In the safety pharmacology studies, high doses of varenicline induced various CNS effects; however, 
they all occurred with safety margins of at least 50. The only exception is a treatment-related decrease 
in body temperature, which occurred with a safety margin of 16. 
In  vitro,  17  μM  varenicline  inhibited  the  hERG  current  by  17%.  Additionally,  10  μM  varenicline 
increased  the  action  potential  duration  in  dog  cardiac  purkinje  fibers.  In  both  cases,  the  findings 
occurred  with  a  safety  margin  of  more  than  90.  When  evaluated  in  six  monkeys,  there  were  no 
significant differences between ECG data obtained during vehicle and varenicline treatment. However, 
one  monkey  experienced  a  30%  decrease  in  heart  rate  and  a  slight  increase  in  P-R-interval.  In  the 
repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  conducted  in  monkeys,  no  treatment-related  effects  were  observed  with 
respect to heart rate, blood pressure, ECG or respiration rate. Since no effects on ECG were observed 
in the 9 month repeat dose toxicity study in monkeys at the highest dose (1.2 mg/kg/day), this dose 
may be considered as NOAEL for QT-prolongation. Comparing clinical Cmax and Cmax in the monkeys 
gives  a  safety  margin  of  approximately  15.  No  noteworthy  changes  in  the  QT  interval  or  any  ECG 
parameters  were  observed  in  the  clinical  studies  and  there  appears  to  be  no  need  for  further 
investigations.  
A dose-dependent increase in the urinal excretion of sodium and chloride was observed in rats but this 
finding  occurred  with  a  safety  margin  of  50.  An  inhibiting  effect  on  gastrointestinal  motility  was 
observed with a safety margin of 10. Based on an emesis study conducted in ferrets, varenicline has 
the potential to induced emesis in humans possible via both a local effect on the gut wall as well as a 
central effect.  
Overall,  other  pharmacodynamic  effects  caused  by  varenicline  treatment  were  observed  with  large 
safety margins and the only observations of clinical relevance are nausea and emesis.  
• 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
local  anesthetics,  anti-psychotics,  anti-depressants  and 
Glaucoma,  mydriasis,  anti-Parkinson, 
anxiolytic/hypnotic  drugs  show  low  to  very  low  affinity  for  the  nicotinic  α4β2  AChRs.  In  turn, 
varenicline  displays  very  low  affinity  for  the  target  receptors  of  these  classes  of  drugs. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions are therefore unlikely to occur. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption:  overall,  varenicline  is  characterised  by  high  absorption,  negligible  first-pass  effect, 
moderate distribution across many tissues, moderate half-life and extensive renal excretion. In rats and 
monkeys  there  was  no  evidence  of  gender  differences  with  respect  to  plasma  exposure  following 
repeated  p.o.  varenicline  administration.  The  systemic  exposure  (AUC)  appeared  to  be  higher 
following repeated p.o. dosing of rats, indicating that accumulation occurred to a minor extent. Mean 
5/44

varenicline Cmax and AUC values increased in a less than dose-proportional manner following repeated 
p.o. dosing of rats and monkeys.  
Distribution:  the  percent  of  drug  bound  to  plasma  proteins  was  18%,  45%,  19%,  41%  and  20%  in 
mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human plasma, respectively. The tissue distribution of varenicline was 
investigated using whole-body autoradioluminography in male and female Long-Evans rats following 
oral  dosing  of  14C-varenicline.  In  the  majority  of  tissues,  maximal  radioactivity  concentrations  were 
measured  at  the  first  sampling  point,  which  was  1  hour  post  dosing.  Varenicline  distributed  into  all 
collected  tissues  except  the  lens  and  vitreous  humor.  Still,  varenicline  displayed  a  high  affinity  for 
ocular tissues since (besides the GI tract) maximal radioactivity was measured in ciliary body, uvea, 
iris and choroid. Moreover, high concentrations of radioactivity were detected in ocular tissues at the 
last  sampling  point  (168  hours).  There  were  no  apparent  gender  differences  with  respect  to  tissue 
distribution. Varenicline displays affinity for melanin containing tissues.  
Metabolism: the metabolites of varenicline were identified in circulation and in excreta of laboratory 
animals and healthy human subjects. In mice, rats, monkeys, and humans the vast majority (75%-93%) 
of drug-related material in circulation and excreta was comprised of unchanged drug, indicating that 
metabolism  is  not  a  primary  route  of  varenicline  clearance  in  these  species.  In  rabbits,  metabolites 
were  present  in  greater  abundance  than  varenicline.  A  total  of  13 metabolites  were  observed  in  all 
species and were products of oxidation and conjugation pathways. Three metabolites in animal studies 
remain unidentified (designated as M3, M3a, and M6), but all were present at less than 3.3% and none 
were detected in humans. In excreta, there was no single metabolite that was more than 4.6% of dose 
in any species, while unchanged varenicline comprised at least 75% or more of dose in excreta in all 
species. Overall, the metabolism of varenicline in laboratory species and humans is very similar and 
all metabolites observed in humans were observed in one or more animal species used in preclinical 
safety evaluations. 
Excretion: the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT-2) is involved in renal elimination of varenicline and 
the  risk  of  pharmacokinetic  drug  interactions  with  OCT-2  inhibitors  has  been  evaluated  clinically. 
Drug interactions on the level of CYP mediated metabolism are not likely. In vitro studies showed that 
glucuronyl  transferase  2B7  (UGT2B7)  is  responsible  for  the  N-carbamoylglucuronidation  of 
varenicline but this pathway represents only a very small portion of the total clearance.

• 
Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
Repeated dose toxicity of  varenicline was evaluated  after oral  administration in  mice, rats,  dogs and 
monkeys.  Two  studies  of 14-days  and 3  months  duration  were  conducted  in mice,  four  studies  with 
durations of 10 days, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months in rats, one 7-day study in dogs and seven oral 
studies  with  durations  of  7  days  to  9  months  were  conducted  in  monkeys.  In  each  study,  systemic 
exposure to varenicline was evaluated for relationship to dose level, sex, and duration of dosing. 
Decreased body weight, body weight gain and food consumption were observed in rats at varenicline 
plasma  exposure  levels  around  50-fold  higher  than  is  observed  in  the  clinic.  Body  weight  loss, 
dehydration  and  inappetance  were  dose-limiting  factors  in  the  monkey  repeat-dose  toxicity  study, 
where weight loss and reduced food consumption occurred at AUC values approximately 10 times the 
human  systemic  exposure. Anorexia and decreased appetite  are  uncommon findings in the clinic. In 
contrast,  most  patients  experience  increased  appetite,  which  is  commonly  observed  following 
cessation of smoking.  
Effects on the central nervous system (e g tremors, laboured respiration, unsteady gait) were seen in 
mice, rats (both at 100 mg/kg/day), and dogs (at ≥0.1 mg/kg/day). At 150mg/kg/day, convulsions were 
seen  in  mice.  Salivation  was  a  common  finding  in  varenicline-treated  rats  and  monkeys,  which 
occurred at a 6-fold higher AUC values than observed in the clinic.  
Gastrointestinal  effects  (gastric/cecal/colonic  dilatation  and/or  emesis,  and  loose  stools/dehydration) 
occurred in mice, rats and/or monkeys and were expected findings based on known pharmacological 
effects of nicotine. Enlarged stomach with or without enlarged pylorus was observed in mice (at 150 
mg/kg/day) and jejunal/cecal/colonic dilatation were observed in rats (at ≥30 mg/kg/day, effects that 
might be related to decreased gastrointestinal transit. One monkey died due to megacolon (at 0.2 BID 
mg/kg/day). It cannot be excluded that varenicline contributed to pathology in this animal that showed 
prior to and during treatment various episodes of gastrointestinal disorders. Emesis occurred in dogs 
(at  ≥  0.05  mg/kg/day)  and  in  monkeys  (at  ≥0.25  mg/kg/day  QD  and  ≥0.2  mg/kg/day  BID).  Loose 
stools and dehydration occurred in rats (at ≥100 mg/kg/day) and dogs (at 1 mg/kg/day). The reduced 
blood  glucose  levels,  observed  in  mice  (at  150  mg/kg/day)  and  rats  (at  ≥10  mg/kg/day),  might  be 
secondary and related to the gastrointestinal effects.

The liver was identified as a target organ in mice and rats on the basis of hepatocellular (single-cell) 
necrosis and moderate elevations in ALT, AST, total bilirubin and decreased 5’nucleotidase activity at 
100 mg/kg/day. Liver weight was also increased by varenicline treatment at 10 mg/kg/day in rat but 
caused  smaller  increases  in  mean  transaminase  elevations  without  a  microscopic  correlate.  At  30 
mg/kg/day, an increase of hepatic microsomal enzymes was seen (CYP1A, CYP2E, CYP3A). Serious 
effects  like  necrosis  were  only  seen  at  high  doses  in  the  short  term  studies.  Elevated  liver  enzymes 
were observed at lower doses but still these findings occurred with a large margin of exposure. The 
lack of similar findings in dogs and monkeys may be due to the dose-limiting emesis observed in these 
species. 
Hematopoietic effects consisted of increases in red blood cell counts (RBC) and haemoglobin levels 
and decreases in white blood cell counts (WBC) and lymphocyte counts in rats (at 100 mg/kg/day) and 
decreases in RBC, haemoglobin levels, WBC, and lymphocyte counts in mice (at 100 mg/kg/day).  In 
addition  there  was  minimal  to  mild  cellular  depletion  of  the  bone  marrow  at  30  mg/kg/day  in  the  3 
month  rat  toxicity  study.  The  bone  marrow  changes  might  be  related  to  a  decrease  in  food 
consumption and body weight. Treatment-related changes in erythroid parameters (decreases in mean 
RBC count, haemoglobin, and haematocrit; increases in mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular 
haemoglobin, and reticulocyte count in rats (at ≥30 mg/kg/day) and mice (at ≥100 mg/kg/day) might 
be related to increased RBC turnover. These effects were not seen in dogs and monkeys. An increase 
in total bilirubin was seen in rats and occasionally also in monkeys. 
Based on plasma AUC values obtained at the NOAEL and adjusted for species differences in plasma 
protein binding, the overall safety margins ranged from 6 to 15 in rats and from 1 to 6 in monkeys.

Genotoxicity 
Varenicline  was  neither  mutagenic  nor  clastogenic  when  tested  in  assays  for  gene  mutations  in 
bacteria and mammalian cells or for chromosome aberrations in vitro and in vivo. 
• 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenic potential was investigated in two-year studies in mice and rats. 
In  mice  no  treatment-related  increase  in  tumor  incidence  was  noted  at  any  dose  tested.  Based  on 
toxicokinetic  data  from  a  3-month  study,  systemic  exposure  in  the  mice  of  the  high  dose  group  (20 
mg/kg/day)  is  estimated  to  be  at  least  58  times  the  expected  systemic  exposure  in  humans  at  the 
maximum recommended therapeutic dose.  
In rats, 1 benign hibernoma (brown fat tissue (BAT) tumour) were seen in the mid-dose males and 2 
malignant hibernomas in the high-dose males. According to the applicant, varenicline, at exaggerated 
multiples  of  efficacious  levels,  could  act  like  nicotine,  and  increase  sympathetic  stimulation/β-
oxidation/UCP-1 expression in brown adipocytes. The resulting sustained stimulation of β-oxidation in 
mediastinal  BAT  could  lead  to  the  formation  of  reactive  oxygen  species  may  cause  sufficient  local 
oxidative damage to DNA and decreased apoptosis for development of BAT neoplasia (hibernoma) in 
rodents.  
The exposure multiple at the NOAEL in the rat carcinogenicity study was 5 and at the mid dose where 
one benign hibernoma was observed the exposure multiple was 17. In rodents, BAT is present at birth, 
develops  rapidly  postnatally,  and  is  important  in  thermogenesis.  In  contrast,  in  humans,  BAT  is 
present  at  maximal  amounts  at  birth,  after  which  its  metabolic  activity  and  thermogenic  capacity 
decrease  to  minimal  levels.  Based  on  these  arguments  it  is  considered  that  the  risk  for  humans  to 
develop  hibernomas  following  treatment  with  varenicline  is  theoretical  and  most  probably  non-
existent.

Reproduction Toxicity 
Varenicline was tested for reproductive and developmental toxicity in conventional studies in the rat 
(Segment  I,  II  and  III)  and  the  rabbit  (Segment  II).  Toxicokinetics  were  included  in  all  studies. 
Exposure margins were up to 37-133 times the human Cmax or AUC at the MRHD. 
Separate  female  and  male  fertility  studies  were  conducted  with  varenicline.  In  either  sex,  toxicity 
consisted  of  decreases  in  body  weights  at  15  mg/kg/day.  There  were  no  findings  on  fertility  or 
reproductive  parameters  in  females  and  no  treatment-related  effects  on  copulation,  pregnancy  rates, 
reproductive  parameters  or  the  reproductive  tract  in  males.  Thus,  the  NTEL  for  reproduction  and 
fertility  was  15  mg/kg/day.  Based  on  the  toxicokinetic  part  of  the  6-week  rat  study,  this  dose  level 
would correspond to an AUC value of 36 times the AUC at the MRHD. 
Varenicline  was  not  teratogenic  in  rats  or  rabbits  at  any  of  the  doses  evaluated.  In  the  rat  study, 
maternal  toxicity  (decrease  in  body  weight)  was  observed  at  doses  of  5  and  15  mg/kg/day  with  a 
NOAEL  of  0.3  mg/kg/day.  The  NTEL  for  fetotoxicity  and  teratogenicity  was  15  mg/kg/day, 
corresponding to a safety margin of 36. In the rabbit study, maternal toxicity (decrease in body weight) 
was  observed  at  30  mg/kg/day.  The  only  finding  was  a  significant  decrease  in  fetal  and  placental 
weights  at  the  maternally  toxic  dose  of  30  mg/kg/day.  Thus,  the  NTEL  for  fetotoxicity  was  10 
mg/kg/day, corresponding to a safety margin of 50. Pre- and postnatal development was studied in rats 
at doses of 0.3, 3 and 15 mg/kg/day. The NTEL for maternal systemic toxicity (reduced body weight 
and food consumption) was 0.3 mg/kg/day. 
Based  on  the  toxicokinetic  part  of  the  rat  Segment  II  study,  this  dose  level  would  correspond  to  an 
AUC  value  of  0.85  times  the  AUC  at  the  MRHD.  In  the  offspring,  treatment-related  developmental 
findings  were  observed  at  15  mg/kg/day  and  included  reduced  body  weights,  a  reduction  in  the 
number  of  rearings,  increased  maximum  amplitude  of  the  auditory  startle  response  (ASR)  in  males 
only, and reduced fertility; therefore, the NTEL for F1 developmental toxicity was 3 mg/kg/day. The 
fertility  rate  at  15 mg/kg  was  80%  compared  to  95%  for  the  control,  which  is  outside  the  historical 
control  range  (90%-100%).  An  association  between  treatment  on  the  one  hand  and  the  increase  in 
ASR  amplitude  and  reduced  number  of  successful  F1  mating  pairs  on  the  other  hand  cannot  be 
excluded, but is considered to pose minimal risk to humans as maternal AUC exposures were 36 times 
the  AUC  at  the  MRHD,  based  on  the  toxicokinetic  part  of  the  rat  Segment  II  study.  Moreover, 
perinatal nicotine exposure also alters postnatal behavioral function in experimental animals and it is 
well known that maternal smoking is detrimental to human fetal development, with the most notable 
effect  being  intra-uterine  growth  retardation.  Therefore,  although  varenicline  is  classifiable  as  a 
developmental toxicant, this is not considered a cause for concern and it is duly reflected in the SPC.  
There are no studies in juvenile animals as a pedriatric indication is not being sought. 
• 
Local tolerance  
Varenicline  has  been  tested  for  dermal  toxicity,  eye  and  skin  irritation,  delayed  contact 
hypersensitivity and phototoxicity. These studies show the drug product to be well tolerated by dermal 
application, minimally irritating to the skin and eye, unlikely to cause contact dermatitis and devoid of 
phototoxic potential.  
• 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity and immunotoxicity studies were not conducted. Nevertheless, it is known that nicotine 
alters  a wide range of immunological  functions and  may impair  both the immune and inflammatory 
responses.

Dependence 
The comparatively lower release of dopamine in striatal slices, lower dopamine turnover and release in 
nucleus accumbens and the lower potential of varenicline to maintain self-administration behavior as 
compared  to  nicotine  suggests  that  varenicline  should  have  a  lower  dependence  potential  when 
compared  to  nicotine.  Yet,  the  functional  and  behavioral  effects  were  not  absent  and  varenicline 
generalized  to  nicotine  in  a  drug  discrimination  study,  suggesting  varenicline  has  similar  subjective 
effects as nicotine. Thus, based on the non-clinical studies, it may be concluded that varenicline has 
dependence potential due to its reinforcing properties. 
Male  rats  were  trained  to  discriminate  0.4  mg/kg  SC  nicotine  from  saline.  On  days  with  nicotine 
administration,  30  consecutive  responses  on  the  nicotine-associated  lever  produced  a  food  pellet 
delivery  (reward).  On  alternate  days,  vehicle  was  used  and  the  other  lever  was  activated.  After 
varenicline administration to trained rats, the percentage of responding on the nicotine-associated lever 
was  taken  as  an  indication  of  the  degree  of  nicotine  stimulus  exerted.  In  this  model,  SC  varenicline 
produced dose-dependent substitution for nicotine with complete substitution at 1.0 mg/kg. Treatment 
did not compromise the animals’ ability to respond. Mecamylamine attenuated the varenicline-treated 
animals’ preference for the nicotine lever. 
Varenicline  was  tested  in  male  rats  trained  to  self-administer  (via  lever  pressing)  30  μg/kg/infusion 
nicotine  through  a  catheter  placed  in  the  jugular  vein.  The  animals  were  trained  according  to  two 
different  nicotine  treatment  protocols:  1)  reinforcement  was  allowed  after  the  rats  had  pressed  the 
lever 5 times (Fixed ratio) and 2) a schedule that investigated how hard an animal would work (lever 
pressing) for reinforcement (Progressive ratio). Pre-treatment with PO and SC varenicline decreased 
nicotine intake under a fixed ratio schedule at doses that did not compromise the animals’ ability to 
respond.  The  reductions  in  nicotine  intake  were  approximately  50%  and  35%  following  SC  and  PO 
administration  of  3  mg/kg  varenicline,  respectively.  Similarly,  SC  pre-treatment  with  varenicline 
reduced the number of nicotine infusions earned per minute in animals working on a progressive ratio 
schedule by up to 50% (at 1.78 and 3.2 mg/kg). Under the progressive ratio schedules, animals worked 
harder  for  a  nicotine  infusion  than  they  did  for  varenicline.  However,  animals  on  the  fixed  ratio 
schedule were not able to differentiate between nicotine and varenicline. Consequently, varenicline’s 
reinforcing properties are the same as or lower than nicotine’s.   
Male rats were trained in a lever-pressing paradigm, where 10 lever presses resulted in a reward food 
pellet being dispensed. Based on an acute-dose response curve, it was chosen to administer 1.7 mg/kg 
varenicline (decreased response rate by ~ 50%) daily for 14 days. As expected the response rate was 
decreased  the  first  days  of  treatment  but  tolerance/neuroadaptation  to  treatment  developed  and  the 
response rate returned to the baseline level by Day 10 (see Figure below). Potential withdrawal effects 
were investigated by dosing with sterile water on Days 15 through 21. Discontinuation of varenicline 
dosing after 14 days and substitution with sterile water on Days 15 through 21 resulted in no change in 
response rate, and no-observable behavioural effects. Discontinuation of dosing with varenicline did 
not  cause  any  behaviour  that  have  been  observed  previously  following  discontinuation  of  nicotine, 
including teeth chattering, chewing, gasping, writhing, head shakes, body shakes, tremors, and ptosis. 
Additionally, no changes in response rate or body weight were observed during the 1-week abstinence 
period.

SC administration of varenicline 1.7 mg/kg produced a reduction of response rate of 78% on Day 1. Dosing was 
continued  for  14  consecutive  days,  and  toleration  was  achieved  by  Day  10  and  maintained  through  Day  14.  
Administration of varenicline was discontinued after Day 14, and rats were dosed with sterile water from Day 15 
through Day 21 with no observed effect on response rate or behavior. 
Overall, the negative results in the rat withdrawal study and the results obtained at the end of the 9-
months monkey toxicology study suggest that varenicline has little or no potential to cause physical 
dependence. The positive reinforcing effects of varenicline, however, should be judged in view of the 
chemical-pharmaceutical  properties  of  varenicline  (difficulty  to  synthesize  varenicline  outside  of  an 
industrial  setting;  bitter  taste),  clinical  experience  (emetic  properties  at  higher  doses),  and  the  wide 
availability of a full α4β2 nicotinic receptor agonist (nicotine). 
Metabolite, impurity and special studies were not conducted and are not required. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  environmental  risk  assessment  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  current  draft  CHMP 
guideline.  Given  a  maximum  daily  dose  of  2  mg  and  a  default  market  penetration  of  1%,  the 
calculated  PECsurfacewater  was  equal  to  the  action  limit  of  0.01  μg/L.  As  a  result,  a  Phase  II  fate  and 
effects analysis was provided. Varenicline did not meet the criteria for PBT/PvBv substances. Based 
on a 7-day survival and reproduction study in Ceriodaphnia dubia, the lowest NOEC was 0.003 mg/L 
and  the  PEC/PNEC  ratio  equal  to  0.03.  Therefore,  varenicline  is  unlikely  to  represent  a  risk  to  the 
aquatic environment and no further testing or specific labelling is required. 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Varenicline  plasma  levels  were  not  addressed  in  the  submitted  pharmacodynamic  studies.  However, 
varenicline plasma concentration data are available from the dopamine turnover study (1997-38271). 
The provided data cover studies were varenicline’s intrinsic activity as a nicotinic partial agonist has 
been investigated. In this study, the oral ED50 for varenicline was derived to be 6 μg/kg and following 
extrapolation the provided plasma data support the chosen clinical dose.  
The  CHMP  was  also  concerned  as  all  the  safety  pharmacology  studies  (except  for  cardiac  purkinje 
fiber  study  IC/001/02),  were  not  performed  in  compliance  with  GLP.  During  the  procedure,  the 
Applicant clarified that all safety pharmacology studies (CNS, CV, cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal 
and renal) were performed between November 1997-August 1998, i.e. before the release of ICHS7A 
and data were compiled in a report that was signed off by management on 4 September 1998. After 
that date additional data were generated (rat colon assay) and/or were repeated (binding assays) and 
these new data were combined with the safety pharmacology data from 1997-1998 into a new report 
that was included in the original submission (CP526555/0705/GP).

Finally,  the  CHMP  was  also  concerned  by  the  lack  of  any  functional  immunological  evaluation  of 
varenicline  in  an  animal  model  and  the  lack  of  convincing  evidence  that  the  Immunosuppressive 
effects of nicotine are solely mediated through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (non-α4β2 subtypes) 
in human lymphocytes. Therefore, the Applicant will perform a functional immunotoxicity study as a 
post-approval commitment. The protocol for the study will be provided before the end of 2006.  The 
final report for that study will be provided within one year of the protocol being agreed (see letter of 
undertaking.

Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
All  plasma  samples  were  analyzed  for  varenicline  concentrations  using  a  fully  validated  assay 
employing liquid-liquid extraction followed by HPLC/MS/MS. The analytical methods are suitable for 
their  purposes  and  well  validated.  It  is  agreed,  that  the  results  from  the  two  evaluated  analytical 
laboratories are comparable. 
Overview of Clinical Pharmacology Studies 
The  clinical  pharmacology  program  has  been  studied  in  healthy  volunteers  (men  and  women),  in 
patients with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, in elderly people and in adolescents.  
The program consists of: 
•  16 clinical pharmacology studies that used only IR formulations;  
•  2 clinical pharmacology studies that contained IR arms as part of an evaluation of controlled 
release (CR) formulations  
•  5 bioavailability and bioequivalence studies  
•  1 abuse potential study

Pharmacokinetics 
• 
Absorption  
Varenicline  (tartrate)  oral  formulations  are  virtually  completely  absorbed.  Since  varenicline  is  no 
substrate for glycoprotein-P transporter enzymes and is practically not metabolised by CYP enzymes 
in  humans,  there  is  no  first  pass-  effect  and  varenicline  is  therefore  highly  available  systemically. 
There  was  no  interaction  with  food  and  absorption.  Varenicline  plasma  exposure  (AUC,  Cmax)  is 
dose-linear.

Distribution 
Varenicline is a basic amine. In animals, varenicline is distributed throughout the body, including the 
brain, and varenicline passes the placenta. In rodents, varenicline accumulated in melanine containing 
cells and the eyes. Whether this also occurs in humans is unknown. Protein binding of varenicline in 
humans  is  low  (≤20%),  and  therefore  no  major  interactions  regarding  protein  binding  are  expected. 
The volume of distribution (V/F) is estimated as 337 l in adults. Vd was significantly related to body 
weight. Steady-state is achieved after 4 days repeat dosing.  
• 
Elimination 
Metabolism:  Varenicline  is  not  significantly  metabolised  oxidatively  by  liver  CYP  enzymes.  It  is 
therefore  not  expected  that  varenicline  metabolism  and  exposure  would  be    affected  by  hepatic 
disorders.  In  minor  quantities,  conjugates  are  recovered  in  plasma  and  urine  (approximately  10%  of 
the total dose). Whether these conjugates are biological active is yet unknown.  
Excretion:  Varenicline,  and  its  conjugates,  are  virtually  completely  excreted  renally,  primarily  by 
passive glomerular filtration and to minor extent by active secretion in the proximal tubulus.  
• 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
In the multiple dose regimen in study 001, varenicline exposure increased linearly with dose (range 1-
3 mg QD). In the single dose regimens in the same study, varenicline exposure was dose proportional 
from 0.01-3 mg. The Cmax and AUC after 10 mg were however similar to 3 mg dose. However, as 
vomiting was common after the 10 mg single dose, and this may have biased the estimation of Cmax 
or AUC after 10 mg single dose.

Exposure of varenicline in plasma is linearly related to the dose.  
Time dependency 
There was no diurnal variability in varenicline levels. Varenicline exposure was virtually completely 
similar  when  a  single  dose  of  2  mg  varenicline  was  administered  in  the  morning  or  before  bedtime 
(Study A3051015, 90% CI AUC0-24 95-103%) 
Renal varenicline clearance was consistent over a study period of 1-14 days. This was confirmed in 
the population PK model; there were no trends observed in the WRES-time plots. 
• 
Special populations 
In the conducted population PK analysis renal function (on systemic clearance, CL/F) and bodyweight 
(on volume of distribution, V2/F) were  the important factors leading to interindividual variability in 
the  pharmacokinetics  of  varenicline.  Plasma  concentration  time  data  were  fitted  to  a  two-
compartmental  model,  with  first-order  absorption  and  elimination.  Model  parameters  were  central 
compartment (V2/F), clearance from central compartment (Cl/F), peripheral compartment (V3/F) and 
inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F), dosing compartment V1 and absorption constant (Ka) and a lag-
time for absorption (Alag).  
The  table  below  provides  estimated  ranges  of  expected  variability  in  CL/F  and  V2/F  relative  to  the 
typical value based on the covariate effects and the observed range of age, weight, and CRCL values 
in the dataset. Observed covariate factors in the final PK model described a large fraction of the total 
observed  inter-individual  variability  in  both  the  apparent  clearance  (44.5%)  and  central  volume  of 
distribution (45.6%) of varenicline.

Weight  was  shown  to  influence  the  volume  of  distribution,  thus,  plasma  concentration  fluctuations 
will be affected by weight.  
The  clearance  of  varenicline  is  linearly  related  to  GFR  (glomerular  filtration  rate),  and  varenicline 
exposure  increased  in  patients  with  limited  GFR.  It  is  therefore  recommended  to  adjust  the  regular 
varenicline  dose  if  the  patient  has  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment.  Varenicline  is  not 
recommended in patients with ESRD, based on insufficient clinical experience. 
Varenicline was cleared by haemodialysis. 
Varenicline plasma exposure was similar in elderly with normal renal function for their age (aged 65-
75, creatinine clearance >  70 ml/min) and adults, in different ethnic groups, and between males and 
females.  
In conclusion, there are no major problems expected based on the PK profile of varenicline regarding 
interactions, gender and ethnicity, though dose adjustments are necessary for patients with severe renal 
dysfunction.  
It should be noted that this product is currently not indicated for children or adolescents. Limited data 
in  adolescents  suggests  that  Cmax  was  30%  higher than  in  adults  and  elimination  was  50%  shorter, 
probably because of a limited Vd in adolescents compared to adults.

• 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The active tubular secretion is mediated by human organic cation transporter proteins type 2 (hOCT2). 
Cimetidine is a substrate and inhibitor of this renal transporter, and concomitant use of cimetidine and 
varenicline  caused  an  increase  of  varenicline  exposure  of  approximately  30%.  Administration  of 
varenicline did not cause inhibition of renal elimination of another hOCT2 substrate, metformin. There 
were  no  significant  PK  interactions  found  between  varenicline  and  narrow  therapeutic  drugs  like 
digoxin and warfarin, and other smoking cessation agents like nicotine replacement and bupropion.

• 
Mechanism of action 
Varenicline  acts  as  a  competitive,  partial  agonist  for  nicotine  binding  to  nicotinic  acetylcholine 
receptor  α4β2.  Both  nicotine  and  varenicline  binds  to  this  receptor  subtype.  In  animal  models,  the 
α4β2 nicotinic receptor has been shown to be responsible for the reinforcing properties of nicotine. It 
is hypothesized that varenicline, as it is a partial agonist, blocks the full-agonist activity of nicotine by 
competitive binding. On the other hand, the partial agonist action of varenicline  may cause  relief of 
withdrawal and craving symptoms on its own.

A laboratory craving study was performed in smokers not intending to quit, who were exposed to a 
smoking related cue after an abstinence period of 12 hours. A single dose of either placebo or 2 mg 
varenicline was given to each participant. Varenicline significantly reduced the cue-stimulated craving 
and  withdrawal  symptoms  in  comparison  with  placebo.  Results  of  a  PK/PD  analysis  indicated  that 
increasing plasma varenicline concentration was associated with reduced cigarette craving.  
A  study  was  performed  to  test  the  abuse  potential  of  varenicline  in  non-smokers  and  smokers. 
Varenicline was compared to amphetamine and placebo in a group of regular amphetamine users, in a 
double-blind,  randomised  study.  Amphetamine  (15/30  mg),  varenicline  (1/3  mg)  or  placebo  was 
administered  to  21  tobacco  smokers  +  21  non-smokers.  The  VAS  Drug  Liking  scale  was  used  to 
assess the subjective appreciation of the offered drug. Smokers could not distinguish 1 mg varenicline 
from  placebo.  The  3  mg  varenicline  dose  could  be  distinguished  from  placebo,  but  the  drug  was 
considered as unpleasant. Non-smokers could distinguish 1 mg varenicline from placebo, but like in 
smokers,  the  drug  was  considered  unpleasant,  especially  at  3  mg  doses.  Varenicline  did  not  induce 
euphoria in any subject in this study. Higher dose of amphetamine were most appreciated, indicating 
the  validity  of  the  chosen  test  method.  Considering  the  fact  that  high  doses  of  varenicline  induce 
nausea  and  the  rewarding  effects  were  low,  it  is  unlikely  that  varenicline  would  become  a  drug  of 
abuse.  
Finally, 4 studies were performed in smokers and non-smokers to investigate the maximum tolerated 
dose and dose titration and timing on dose toleration. The dose-limiting factor was nausea. Smokers 
were more tolerant to varenicline than non-smokers with respect to nausea. In smokers, the maximum 
tolerated single dose and multiple dose is 3 mg and 1 mg BID, respectively. Nausea was less severe 
when varenicline is up-titrated, when varenicline  is  administered  under fed conditions and when the 
dose was divided over the day. Results from studies A3051014 and A3051015 indicate that the burden 
of  nausea  might  be  reduced  by  titrating  the  dose.  The  results  do  not  enlighten  any  dose-response 
effect.

The  incidence  of  nausea  increased  when  varenicline  was  concomitantly  used  with  nicotine 
replacement therapy. The interaction between varenicline and other psychotropic agents like alcohol 
and benzodiazepines is however only briefly investigated by the Applicant. However, varenicline use 
induced somnolence and abnormal dreams, indicating that this compound could be psychoactive. This 
is further addressed in the RMP. 
Clinical efficacy  
In total, seven Phase II/III studies were performed which provided efficacy data from 5944 subjects. 
Subjects were eligible if they were current smokers of more than 10 cigarettes per day, willing to quit, 
and if they had no successful quit attempt that lasted more than 3 months in the year before entrance.

Dose response study(ies) 
Based on the Phase II dose-finding studies, the following conclusions could be drawn; Varenicline, in 
dosages > 0.3 mg, was superior to placebo (see figure 17 below). Abstinence-rates were higher after 
12-weeks  than  after  6-weeks  continuous  varenicline  treatment.    Dose  titration  was  useful  to  prevent 
nausea.  
In  pooled  data  analyses,  continuous  cessation  rate  at  the  end  of  treatment  at  week  12  was 
approximately 45% in both the 0.5 and 1 mg BID treatment arms (see table III.4.1. below). At week 
52, the long-term continuous abstinence rate was 22.6% after 1 mg BID dose and 19.0% after 0.5 mg 
BID dose.

In a patient-controlled dosing study (A3051016), patients could choose a dose of 0.5/1/1.5/2 mg a day. 
The overall median auto-regulated total daily dose was 1.3 mg. At the end of the 12-weeks treatment 
period, a higher proportion of study participants were taking the 0.5 mg BID dose than the 1 mg BID 
dose. These data indicate that most patients would benefit from a 1 mg BID dose regime. However, 
every patient that would stop varenicline use prematurely due to adverse events can be considered as a 
loss,  as  varenicline  is  an  effective  drug  to  promote  smoking  cessation.  Intolerant  patients  should  be 
given the opportunity to change to a regimen of 0.5 mg BID.

Main studies  
METHODS 
Design of pivotal studies: A3051007/1018, A3051028 and A3051036 
In Studies A3051028, -36, and –07/18, varenicline was administered for 12 weeks at 1 mg BID with 
subsequent non-treatment follow-up for one year from the start of treatment. Based on a comparison of 
titrated  and  non-titrated  regimens  in  Study  A3051007/18,  the  Phase  III  studies  titrated  varenicline 
from 0.5 mg QD to 1 mg BID during the first week of treatment to improve tolerability. The one-year 
follow-up  period  from  the  start  of  treatment  is  an  established  design  element,  widely  used  in  the 
smoking cessation field. Up to 10 minutes of counselling on smoking cessation was provided at each 
visit in accordance with Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines. 
The identical Phase III trials (A3051028 and -36) were designed to demonstrate the superior efficacy 
of  varenicline  compared  with  bupropion  and  placebo.  Bupropion  was  selected  as  an  active  control 
because it is an efficacious, widely prescribed, oral pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. Nicotine 
replacement therapy was another alternative. 
Studies A3051028 and -36 were designed as 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 
multi-centre studies. Varenicline, bupropion or placebo was administered for 12 weeks, followed by a 
40  week  non-treatment  phase.  At  screening,  subjects  were  requested  to  select  a  Target  Quit  Day  to 
coincide with the Week 1 visit, after the varenicline or bupropion dose had been up-titrated to 1 mg 
BID and 150 mg BID, respectively.  
Clinical visits took place each week during the initial 12 weeks dosing period. At each visit, subjects 
were asked about cigarette and other nicotine use since the last study visit and in the past 7 days (using 
the Nicotine Use Inventory).  End-expiratory exhaled carbon monoxide was measured at each clinic 
visit (nonsmoking status being confirmed with a measurement ≤ 10 ppm).  During the non-treatment 
follow-up phase, clinical visits took place at weeks 13, 24, 36, 44, and 52.  In addition, subjects 
received a telephone call at weeks 16, 20, 28, 32, 40, and 48.  The Nicotine Use Inventory was 
administered at each visit and at each telephone call during the non-treatment phase. 
Adjunctive  Counselling:  At  baseline,  candidates  were  asked  to  review  an  educational  booklet  on 
smoking  cessation  by  the  NCI.  At  each  visit  up  to  10  minutes  of  counselling  was  provided. 
Counsellors  acted  according  to  guidance  of  the  Agency  for  Healthcare  Research  and  Quality.  All 
subjects were contacted 3 days after the Target Quit Date, as a reminder and support. During the non-
treatment  phase,  additional  phone  contacts  were  scheduled  between  clinic  visits  to  encourage 
maintenance of abstinence.   
Study Participants  
Both adult men and women were included and the maximum age was 65 years in Phase II studies and 
75 years in Phase III studies. The Phase III protocols were amended to include patients with mild or 
moderate COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and subjects with a history of cardiovascular diseases 
(e.g.  myocardial  infarction,  coronary  bypass  graft,  PTCA,  angina  pectoris)  other  than  in  the  past  6 
months.  Subjects  treated  for  hypertension  could  be  included  in  Phase  III  studies,  provided  that 
hypertension was adequately controlled.  
Patients with conditions that are contraindicated for the comparator bupropion  were excluded. These 
conditions were: seizures, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal impairment, bipolar disorder, alcoholism 
(current or in the recent past) and the use of MAO-inhibitors. In addition, chronic and episodic use of 
antidepressants and antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, naltrexone, systemic steroids (with exception of 
inhaled steroids), and theophylline was prohibited during the study.

Patients  who  had  used  bupropion  in  the  past  were  not  included  into  the  Zyban-comparator  studies. 
Participants who had used NRT, or other smoking cessation treatment like clonidine and nortryptiline 
other than the last month could be included.   
Treatments 
In  these  parallel  placebo-controlled,  double-blind,  active-comparator  studies,  varenicline  1  mg  BID, 
placebo or Zyban 150 mg BID was administered for 12 weeks. In week 1, varenicline and Zyban, or 
their placebo tablets, were titrated according to the following schedule:  
varenicline

Day 4-7 
Day 8-84 (week 12)  1 mg BID

The  primary  objective  of  these  studies  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  varenicline  to  placebo  and 
bupropion regarding smoking cessation at the end of treatment period of 12 weeks.   
Secondary objectives were; 
-Long term efficacy, till 40 weeks after end of treatment (Week 52) 
-The effect on craving and withdrawal 
-The effect on weight  
-Safety data 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy outcome was the 4-weeks CQR (Continuous Quit Rate) at the end of treatment 
between  week  9-12.    Responders  were  subjects  who  remained  totally  abstinent  from  weeks  9-12 
without  a  single  puff,  confirmed  by  CO-breath  test.  Key  secondary  variable  was  the  long  term 
efficacy, the Continuous Abstinence Rate (CAR) during weeks 9-52. Responders were subjects who 
remained totally abstinent from Weeks 9-52, without a single puff, confirmed by CO-breath test.  
Craving,  withdrawal  and  reinforcing  effects  of  smoking  were  assessed  by  means  of  the  MNWS 
(Minnesota  Nicotine  Withdrawal  Scale),  the  QSU-Brief  (Brief  Questionnaire  of  Smoking  Urges, 
measures craving), and SEI (Smoking Effects Inventory). The Urge to Smoke item, and the Negative 
Affect  and  Restlessness  subscales  of  the  MNWS  were  prespecified  as  subscales  of  primary  interest. 
The Total Craving Score of the QSU-Brief was pre-specified as the endpoint of primary interest for 
that scale.  The SEI included subscales that assessed smoking satisfaction and psychological reward in 
subjects who smoked since the last time the questionnaires were due. 
The MNWS and QSU-Brief questionnaires were filled in by subjects at baseline, and at Week 1-7 and 
12 during treatment. The MNWS was also scored at Week 13, one week after end of treatment. The 
SEI was assessed through Week 7. 
Body weight was measured every clinical visit. For the assessment of total weight gain, body weight 
measured  at  Week  12  was  compared  to  baseline  value  in  Responders  (i.e.  Cessators)  and  the  Total 
Population.  
Sample size 
Sample  sizes  were  based  on  the  comparison  of  varenicline  1  mg  BID  vs.  bupropion  150  mg  BID, 
using a continuity-corrected Chi-Squared test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. The study was 
intended  to  be  powered  to  detect  differences  for  both  the  primary  (4-week  CQR)  and  the  key 
secondary  CAR  endpoint.  Sample  size  calculations  were  based  on  the  bupropion  response  rate 
(varenicline OR of 1.721 over bupropion 4-week CQR of 28.6%). In each study, at least 335 subjects 
21/44

per  group  would  be  needed  to  detect  a  difference  between  bupropion  and  varenicline,  with  90% 
power. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were equally randomised over the 3 study arms (varenicline/bupropion/placebo arm). 
Blinding (masking) 
This  was  a  double-dummy  study,  and  there  were  both  placebo  tablets  available  for  varenicline  and 
Zyban.  So  patients  received  either  varenicline  +  Zyban-placebo  (varenicline-arm),  varenicline  -
placebo + Zyban (bupropion-arm), or varenicline -placebo + Zyban-placebo (placebo-arm).  
Statistical methods  
For binary outcome (CQR week 9-12, CAR), logistic regression analysis, with study site and treatment 
included  as  fixed  factor,  was  applied.  A  step-down  procedure  was  employed  for  the  analyses  of 
primary  and  key  secondary  endpoints  to  preserve  the  family-wise  error  rate  (alpha  0.05).  The 
hierarchy  of  comparisons  was  as  follows:  1.  varenicline  versus  placebo  and  2.  varenicline  versus 
Zyban.  The  withdrawal  and  craving  subscales  were  analysed  by  repeated  measures  Mixed  Effect

The  most  common  reasons  for  study  discontinuation  in  all  three  study  arms  were  loss-to-follow-up, 
refusal  to  continue  participation,  and  AEs.  The  discontinuation  rate  was  higher  in  the  placebo  arm

compared  to  varenicline  arm.  Probably,  this  is  due  to  the  more  severe  withdrawal  symptoms  and 
because of the lack of efficacy in the placebo arm.  
Discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  was  more  common  in  the  Zyban  arm  (n  =  50)  and  in  the 
placebo-arm (n = 37) than in the varenicline-arm (n = 28).  
Recruitment 
Smokers were recruited from the general population, and were not referred by medical specialists.   
Conduct of the study 
Both phase 3 Protocols A3051028 and -36 were amended shortly after study start to allow enrolment 
of subjects with pre-existing medical conditions typical of the intended patient population. 
Both 305A53010 Studies A3051028 and -36 took place in the US, in different study centres.  
Baseline data 
The  demographics  and  smoking  characteristics  of  subjects  in  the  2  identical  Phase  III  studies  were 
well balanced across treatment groups. 
Demographics: Phase III trials A3051028 and -36 enrolled more men than women (56% versus 44%).  
 The  mean  age  was  approximately  42  years  (SD  11)  in  both  studies.  Approximately  80%  of  the 
participants  were  Caucasian,  10%  were  African  and  the  remainder  were  from  other  ethnical  origin. 
Sixty-two (27 + 35) subjects were older than 65 in study A30510-28 and -36, respectively.  Only 17 
varenicline treated subjects were 65 years of age or older. 
The low number of elderly is a drawback in the  assessment of safety. The plasma exposure  may be 
similar  in  elderly  compared  to  younger  adults,  but  elderly  may  be  more  sensitive  to  side  effect  of 
varenicline,  and  the  subgroup  is  considered  too  small  to  make  a  sound  evaluation.    This  will  be 
reflected in the SPC. Treatment in elderly should be monitored post-approval (see Risk Management 
Plan).  
Concomitant diseases: in subjects who were included, the following present & past medical conditions 
were noted at screening (pooled data Study A30510-28 and -36): 
Cardiac Disorders 
Dyspnea at exertion 
COPD  
Emphysema 
History of depression 
History of alcoholism

Smoker  status:  all  participants  were  current  smokers,  who  smoked  at  least  10  cigarettes  a  day.  The 
baseline  smoking  behaviour  features  were  similar  in  both  studies,  over  all  study  arms.  The  mean 
Fagerström  Total  Score  ranged  between  5.16-5.40  (SD±2)  across  study  arms,  indicating  that  the 
average participant was a moderate smoker. 
The  mean  age  at  which  the  subjects  started  smoking  was  approximately  17  years,  and  the  average 
smoking years were approximately 24-25 years in all study arms (range 1-61). In the last month before 
entrance,  the  participants  smoked  on  average  21  cigarettes  (range  10-80)  per  day.  The  majority  of 
participants, about 85%, had at least one serious quit attempt in lifetime. 
Numbers analysed 
Efficacy analyses occurred in the “All Subjects” group, i.e. all subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
the relevant study drug (further referred as ITT in this report). To test the robustness of the conclusions 
from  ITT  dataset,  analyses  took  also  place  in  “Evaluable  Subjects”  group,  defined  as  subjects  who 
took study medication at least for 14 days, and Completer Subjects group, i.e. subject who were for at 
23/44

least 80% treatment compliant. In this report, efficacy parameters of the ITT population are presented, 
unless specified otherwise. For details see participant flow table above.  
Subjects who withdrew from the study or who were lost to follow-up before the study was completed 
were considered as non-responders for subsequent smoking evaluations. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Main results of clinical efficacy 
Varenicline at the recommended dosing regimen (1 mg BID for 12 weeks) is superior to placebo for 
smoking cessation at the end of treatment period and at one year from the start of treatment. 
With  regard  to  4-Week  CQR  (Weeks  9-12)  and  Continuous  abstinence  Weeks  9-24  varenicline  was 
significantly  better  than  bupropion.  At  Continuous  Abstinence  Weeks  9-52  varenicline  was 
statistically superior to bupropion in one of the two phase III studies.  
The results of primary endpoints in the pivotal Phase III studies (A3051028 and -36) are summarised 
below in table III.3.2 below:

In the individual Phase III studies, varenicline significantly reduced craving, withdrawal characterised 
by symptoms of negative affect (depressed mood, irritability, frustration, or anger, anxiety, difficulty 
concentrating) and the reinforcing effects of smoking compared with placebo.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Overall, pooled data from studies A3051007/1018, A3051028 and A3051036 showed that varenicline 
is significantly better that placebo. 
Subgroup analysis by age, gender, race, and baseline smoking characteristics. 
Post  hoc  subgroup  analyses  based  on  gender,  age,  race,  and  baseline  smoking  characteristics  (total 
Fagerström score and average number of cigarettes smoked during the month prior to study enrolment) 
were conducted using pooled data from Studies A3051028, -36 and the 1 mg BID arm of Study -07/18 
(N = 1750).  
Figure: Treatment Effect (as Odds Ratio) for 4-Week CQR (Weeks 9-12) by Gender, Race, Age and 
Baseline Smoking Status: Pooled Principal Smoking Cessation Studies 
The age analysis split subject ages <45 years and ≥45 years because the small number of subjects ≥65 
years (39/1750, 2.2%) precluded a meaningful analysis based on the age groups designated in ICH-E7. 
No  remarkable  effects  of  gender  or  baseline  Total  Fagerström  score/Average  number  of  cigarettes 
smoked on either 4-week CQR (Weeks 9-12) or Continuous Abstinence (Weeks 9-52) were observed.

In the by-race analysis, the small number of non-White subjects limits the ability to estimate precisely 
the  treatment  effect  in  these  subpopulations.  The  Weeks  9-12  CQRs  and  the  Continuous  Abstinence 
rates  from  Weeks  9-24  and  Weeks  9-52  were  similar  in  Whites  and  Other  races.  Similarly,  the 
estimated treatment effects were strong and similar in these 2 subgroups. Varenicline also increased 
the rate of smoking cessation in Blacks compared with placebo, however, the Weeks 9-12 CQR (Table 
below)  and  Continuous  Abstinence  rates  over  both  intervals  were  lower  than  those  of  Whites  and 
Others  and  the  treatment  effect  was  smaller.  The  finding  of  a  smaller  treatment  effect  in  Blacks  is 
consistent with published survey data for the United States showing that fewer Blacks than Whites or 
Hispanics remained abstinent for at least one month. 
Overall,  pooled  data  from  these  three  studies  showed  that  the  efficacy  of  varenicline  in  the  above-
mentioned subgroups was generally comparable to that observed in the total ITT population. 
Pooled Analysis of Craving, Withdrawal, and the Reinforcing Effects of Smoking. 
For  pooled  studies  A3051028  and  –36,  varenicline  significantly  reduced  craving  compared  with 
placebo, as measured by both MNWS Urge to Smoke and QSU-Brief Total Craving Score (see table 
below).    Varenicline  was  superior  to  placebo  in  reducing  withdrawal  characterised  by  symptoms  of 
negative  affect  (depressed  mood,  irritability,  frustration,  or  anger,  anxiety,  difficulty  concentrating) 
and the reinforcing effects of smoking in patients who smoked over treatment.

Maintenance Study   
Because published literature as well as observations from the varenicline clinical program indicate that 
most  relapses  to  smoking  occur  in  the  first  weeks  following  end  of  treatment.  Study  A3051035 
examined whether an additional 12 weeks of varenicline treatment at 1 mg BID would increase long-
term smoking abstinence rates in subjects who were abstinent for at least the last week of the initial 
treatment period.

The primary efficacy endpoint in this study was a comparison between varenicline and placebo in the 
rate of continuous abstinence for Weeks 13-24 in subjects responding to an initial 12-week course of 
smoking cessation therapy with varenicline. The rate of continuous abstinence form weeks 13-52 was 
a secondary endpoint. 
Study design: This international multicentre study was conducted in 3 phases: a 12-week open-label 
phase in which all patients were treated with varenicline at 1 mg BID; a 12-week double-blind phase 
in which patients were randomised to either varenicline 1 mg BID or placebo (Weeks 13-24); and a 
non-treatment follow-up phase to Week 52.  Patients who were abstinent during the last week of the 
open-label period were eligible to enter the double-blind treatment phase.   
Results: Of the subjects who received open-label varenicline 1 mg BID, 1236 (64.1%) subjects were 
abstinent for the 7 days prior to and including the Week 12 visit. Of these, 1206 (602 varenicline, 604 
placebo)  took  at  least  one  dose  of  double-blind  study  medication  and  were  included  in  efficacy 
evaluations. 
For the All Subjects population, the Continuous Abstinence rate from Week 13 through Week 24 was 
statistically  significantly  higher  for  varenicline  (425/602,  70.6%)  than  for  placebo  (301/604,  49.8%) 
(p<0.0001; odds ratio = 2.47). The Continuous Abstinence rate from Week 13 through Week 52 was 
significantly  higher  for  subjects  treated  with  double-blind  varenicline  (265/602,  44.0%)  than  for 
subjects treated with double-blind placebo (224/604; 37.1%) (p = 0.0126, odds ratio = 1.35).  
The  Applicant  concluded  that  subjects  given  an  additional  12  weeks  of  varenicline  treatment  had 
significantly  higher  rates  of  complete  smoking  abstinence  for  Weeks  13  to  24  than  subjects  given 
placebo  and  the  treatment  effect  of  the  additional  12  weeks  of  varenicline  treatment  remained 
statistically significant at the end of the non-treatment follow-up at Week 52. Based on these findings 
it was concluded that subjects who successfully quit smoking after 12 weeks treatment should take an 
additional 12 weeks of treatment in order to maintain abstinence. 
• 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The CHMP was concerned by the fact that comparing the response rates for the two groups at a time 
point where they have been without treatment for the same period of time, the response rates are equal.  
Based on the observation of point Week 24 in the placebo group and point Week 36 in the varenicline 
group, both treatment groups share approximately 50 % response rate. Therefore it can not be ruled 
out that the two curves are approaching each other resulting in an insignificant difference after a drug 
free follow up period of 40 weeks. 
The additional 12 weeks treatment with varenicline reduced the initial rate of relapse compared with 
the  placebo  as  shown  in  the  figure  below.  The  abstinence  rate  in  the  varenicline  group  was  70.6% 
compared  with  49.8%  in  the  placebo  group  at  Week  24,  but  the  CHMP  questioned  whether  this 
comparison was relevant.

Study Week
The recommendation for treatment prolongation with another 12 weeks was therefore initially not 
supported and the Applicant was invited to further argue this issue or to amend the SPC accordingly. 
The applicant contested the CHMP’s interpretation of the A3051035 results on the following bases: 
A:  The  comparison  of  the  two  treatment  arms  at  equal  time  points  after  the  end  of  varenicline 
treatment creates a staggered analysis that violates the principle of a randomized trial, in which 
study arms should differ solely in the quality of the intervention.   
B: The protocol design and data analysis of Study A3051035 conform to the standard approach for 
smoking relapse prevention studies.   
C: The statistically significant treatment effect of the 12 weeks varenicline maintenance treatment at 
final  follow-up  (40  weeks  after  randomization)  represents  a  clinically  meaningful  impact  on 
long-term health outcomes. Extrapolation of a model fitted to the observed relapse curves shows 
that a difference between varenicline and placebo lines is likely to persist beyond the observed 
period.   
The CHMP, taking into account the arguments from the Applicant during the oral explanation and the 
following  discussion  within  the  CHMP  meeting,  agreed  to  the  inclusion  of  maintenance  data  in  the 
label to inform discussions of maintenance treatment between physicians and patients. 
The CHMP was also concerned by abrupt withdrawal at the end of treatment and suggested that dose-
tapering may be useful to prevent increased relapse the first week after stopping varenicline. Both after 
12 and 24 week varenicline treatment, a sharp decline in treatment response (i.e. a sharp increase in 
relapse rate) was observed that is not fully understood. It may be related to withdrawal symptoms of 
weak AchR agonist activity of varenicline, or a rebound effect.  
Although the elimination half-life of varenicline is indeed long, it may not be long enough for nAchRs 
to  adapt  to  the  absence  of  the  partial  agonist-antagonist  varenicline.  Though  the  exact  mechanism 
underlying this phenomenon may not be fully understood, the initial sharper decline in success rate in 
varenicline arm is a fact, and it may be tempered by a more gradual decline of the dose.  
Based  on  these  observations,  the  Applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  the  feasibility  of  a  clinical  trial 
comparing the long term efficacy of abrupt discontinuation versus dose –tapering or whether   dose –
tapering should be proposed as an option for individual patient.

The applicant noted that there was a slightly higher relapse rate (3-6% compared with placebo or 
bupropion) in the varenicline group that was limited to the first week after stopping treatment.  The 
Applicant agreed to amend the dosing recommendation in section 4.2 of the SPC to acknowledge that 
the risk for relapse to smoking is elevated in the period immediately following the end of treatment in 
smoking cessation therapy and that in patients with a high risk of relapse, dose tapering may be 
considered. In addition, the Applicant agreed to add a statement in section 4.4 outlining that there was 
an increase in irritability, urge to smoke, depression, and/or insomnia in up to 3% of patients on 
discontinuation of Champix and that the prescriber should inform the patient accordingly and discuss 
or consider the need for dose tapering. 
Moreover, the Applicant committed to report back to the CHMP about the feasibility of a clinical trial 
evaluating  dose  tapering  versus  abrupt  discontinuation  in  terms  of  long-term  efficacy,  as  a  post-
authorisation follow-up measure. 
Clinical safety 
The safety profile of varenicline was investigated in a program of 32 studies. These studies included: 
1)  8 completed Phase 2/3 studies, with a total of 5944 subjects in all treatment groups 
2)  24  completed  Phase  1  studies,  with  a  total  of  795  subjects  in  all  treatment  groups  (include  2 
studies with controlled release treatment arms) 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in subjects receiving the CR formulation are included in the listings of 
SAEs, but routine safety data from subjects who received only a CR formulation are not included.  
A  cut-off  date  of  15  July  2005  has  been  applied  to  data  from  3  ongoing  studies  and  to  the  Serious 
Adverse Event data.  
• 
Patient exposure 
As of 15 July 2005, the varenicline clinical development program safety database comprised of 6739 
individuals who received at least one dose of study drug (5944 in Phase 2/3 studies; 795 subjects in 
Phase 1 studies). Of the 3298 subjects who received study drug in the Fixed-dose, Placebo-controlled 
Studies, 1575 received varenicline, 795 received bupropion (Zyban), and 928 received placebo. In all 
completed  phase  2/3  trials,  3940  subjects  received  varenicline;  795  received  bupropion,  and  1209 
received placebo. 
More  than  80%  of  the  3940  subjects  who  received  varenicline  in  all  completed  phase  2/3  studies 
received the 1 mg BID dose. In the fixed-dose, placebo-controlled studies, 314 subjects received >12 
weeks of varenicline at 1 mg BID. In addition, most subjects counted as receiving >11 weeks of the 1 
mg BID dose actually completed the full 12 weeks of treatment (i.e. 84 days).

In the All Completed Phase 2/3 Subjects cohort, 456 subjects had >24 weeks of treatment. In addition, 
many  subjects  counted  as  receiving  >20  weeks  of  treatment  completed  the  scheduled  24  weeks  of 
dosing  in  Study  A3051035  but  had  their  final  study  day  prior  to  Day  169.  In  Study  A3051037,  95 
subjects had >52 weeks of varenicline (1 mg BID) treatment, and 112 subjects received varenicline for 
≥52 weeks (≥364 days), in compliance with ICH-E1A. 
In  All  Completed  Phase  2/3  Studies  ,  approximately  equal  proportions  of  men  and  women  received 
varenicline  (49.7%  versus  50.3%,  respectively)  (see  table  below).  A  greater  proportion  of  men  than 
women received bupropion (57.2% versus 42.8%) or placebo (54.3% versus 45.7%).  The mean age 
across all groups was 43.4 years; a total of 165 (2.8%) subjects were 65 years of age or older. More 
than 87% of subjects were White, 7% were Black, and 6% belonged to other racial groups. 
These data indicate that the number of subjects (White < 65 years) exposed to varenicline at the dose 
and duration of exposure proposed in the label is adequate for the safety assessment of the product.

• 
Adverse events  
The ability to characterize the adverse event profile of varenicline is confounded by the fact that some 
subjects  may  continue  to  smoke  while  taking  smoking  cessation  pharmacotherapy;  and/or  smoking 
cessation may be associated with symptoms of nicotine withdrawal (e.g. depressed  mood, insomnia, 
irritability/frustration/anger,  restlessness,  difficulty  concentrating).  No  attempt  was  made  in  the 
analysis  of  varenicline  safety  data  to  distinguish  between  adverse  events  associated  with  study  drug 
treatment and those possibly associated with either of the two conditions mentioned above. 
In  the  fixed-dose,  placebo-controlled  trials,  varenicline-treated  subjects  most  commonly  reported 
treatment-emergent (and treatment-related) gastrointestinal, central nervous system and/or psychiatric 
system  events.  Nausea  was  the  single  most  frequently  reported  adverse  event  among  varenicline-
treated  subjects.  In  addition  to  nausea,  the  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  most  commonly 
reported  (≥5%  and  ≥1.5  times  placebo)  by  varenicline-treated  subjects  (1  mg  BID)  were 
gastrointestinal  disorders  (specifically,  constipation,  flatulence,  dyspepsia,  and  vomiting).  The 
treatment-emergent adverse events that increased in frequency with increasing varenicline dose were 
nausea,  constipation,  vomiting,  abnormal  dreams,  and  sleep  disorder.  These  common  treatment-
emergent (and treatment-related) events were mild or moderate in severity in more than 98% of cases.  
The percentage of varenicline-treated subjects (1 mg BID) reporting severe adverse events exceeded 
1% only for nausea (1.3% vs. 0.4% for placebo) and headache (1.2% vs. 0.9% for placebo). Among 
the  common  treatment-emergent  adverse  events,  the  only  two  leading  to  discontinuation  from  1  mg 
BID varenicline treatment at a rate ≥1% were nausea (3.1% vs. 0.5% placebo) and insomnia (1.2% vs. 
1.1% placebo). 
The  adverse  event  profile  in  the  all  completed  phase  2/3  Studies  was  similar  to  the  Fixed-dose 
Placebo-controlled Studies, indicating that the safety and tolerability profile in subjects receiving 12 
weeks treatment accurately reflected the overall varenicline safety experience (see table below).  
 The incidence of gastrointestinal disorders is high compared to the placebo group. However no weight 
loss was observed in the Cessator subjects who completed the studies.

The treatment emergent adverse events observed in varenicline-treated subjects in the pooled Phase 1 
studies  were  similar  to  those  in  Fixed-dose  Placebo-controlled  Studies  with  nausea,  headache,  and 
vomiting  being  the  most  commonly  reported  adverse  events.  The  relatively  high  incidences  of 
vomiting  in  the  2  mg  and  >2  mg  daily  dose  groups  (8.7%  and  21.4%,  respectively)  may  reflect  the 
higher varenicline doses used in the Phase 1 studies (e.g. up to a 10 mg single dose in Study 305-001). 
The incidence of gastrointestinal disorders is high compared to the placebo group.  
In Phase 2/3 studies, no weight loss was observed in the Cessator subjects who completed the studies. 
Time to onset and persistence 
The time to onset of first occurrence of an adverse event and the presence of that adverse event over 
time were assessed using the Fixed-dose, Placebo-controlled Studies dataset. The majority of subjects 
who  experienced  nausea  reported  the  first  occurrence  during  the  first  week  of  treatment.  The 
proportion of subjects reporting nausea as “present” was greatest at Week 1 then decreased over time. 
Among  subjects  receiving  varenicline  at  doses  less  than  1  mg  BID,  the  percent  reporting  nausea 
approached placebo levels as early as Week 4. Among subjects receiving varenicline at 1 mg BID, the 
proportion  with  nausea  decreased  by  about  50%  over  the  12  weeks  of  study  treatment.  The  median 
duration of a nausea event for subjects receiving the 1 mg BID dose was 10 days.

While the overall incidence of adverse events in subjects receiving varenicline for up to for 52 weeks 
(Study A3051037) was higher than in studies with 6- or 12-weeks varenicline treatment, no additional 
adverse events emerged that suggested an increase in risk with increased duration of exposure. 
No clinically meaningful changes in laboratory test results were observed in the clinical trials nor were 
there any noteworthy changes in the QT/QTc interval or any other ECG parameter in either preclinical 
or clinical studies.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The SAE safety database included 134 cases (count includes deaths). 
There  were  five  deaths  (3  varenicline,  1  bupropion,  1  placebo)  reported  in  the  safety  database,  no 
deaths  were  reported  in  ongoing  studies.  All  deaths  occurred  post-treatment  in  Phase  3  studies.  The 
bupropion and placebo deaths occurred outside the 30-day post-treatment reporting window. None of 
the deaths were considered treatment-related.

treatment  or  within  30  days  of  the  last  dose  of  study  drug.  The  majority  of  SAE  cases  were  single 
events. Among patients treated with varenicline, two SAE cases in Phase 1 and 7 cases in Phase 2/3 
were considered treatment-related by the investigator. Among these 9 cases, no pattern was evident in 
either the event terms or the time to onset of event from the beginning of treatment. A summary of the 
serious adverse events by treatment group is provided below.

a  SAEs listed in this column occurred in those subjects who received placebo in the double-blind phase of 
Study A3051035. 
Thirteen  (8  varenicline,  4  bupropion,  1  placebo)  of  the  16  subjects  with  treatment-related  SAEs 
discontinued treatment due to the SAE.  In addition, 35 (23 varenicline, 4 Zyban, 8 placebo) subjects 
permanently  discontinued  treatment  for  SAEs  not  considered  related  to  study  drug.  Of  the  23 
varenicline-treated subjects, 6 were discontinued for Cardiac Disorders (tachycardia; angina unstable; 
atrial  fibrillation;  acute  coronary  syndrome;  myocardial  infarction;  coronary  artery  disease),  2  for 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (duodenal ulcer; abdominal pain), 6 for Nervous System Disorders (grand 
mal  convulsion  (2  cases);  headache;  cerebral  infarct,  cerebral  thrombosis;  loss  of  consciousness; 
multiple  sclerosis);  3  for  Neoplasms  (cholesteatoma;  adenocarcinoma;  lung  and  brain  neoplasm 
malignant); and 6 for SAEs affecting other body systems  (chest pain;  meningitis aseptic;  back pain; 
calculus  ureteric;  epistaxis;  acute  psychosis,  affect  lability).  No  pattern  was  observed  in  either  the 
event terms or the time to onset of event from the start of treatment. 
Neither  the  number  of  deaths  nor  the  number  and  severity  of  SAE  are  of  concern  from  a  safety

Laboratory findings 
Liver function 
The  clinical  laboratory  test  database  was  reviewed  for  liver  enzyme  abnormalities  based  on  non-
clinical findings of hepatic changes and microscopic evidence of hepatocellular necrosis in rats given 
100  mg/kg/day  in  a  10-day  study.  Few  subjects  (≤0.8%  in  any  group)  demonstrated  clinically 
significant elevations in liver function tests (LFT) (AST and ALT (>3xULN), bilirubin (>1.5xULN). 
The proportion of varenicline-treated subjects with elevated LFTs was generally comparable to that in 
the placebo group. Additionally, there was no apparent relationship between dose and the incidence of 
elevated LFTs. Increasing the size of the safety database to All Completed Phase 2/3 Studies had no 
notable  effect  on  the  incidence  of  liver  function  test  abnormalities  in  spite  of  including  longer-term 
Studies A3051035 and A3051037.

Electrocardiogram 
The effects of varenicline on the ECG and the QT/QTc interval were assessed in both non-clinical and 
clinical studies. 
In  the  Phase  1  clinical  program,  on-treatment  ECGs  were  collected  in  19  of  the  24  studies  and 
manually read by a centralized ECG reader in 7 of those studies. Two of the 7 studies (A3051012 and 
A3051014) employed rigorous methods for assessing QT/QTc following single dose and multiple dose 
administration  of  varenicline,  respectively.  These  two  studies  were  among  the  7  Phase  1  studies  in 
which QT intervals from electronic ECG tracings were measured by a blinded centralized reader. Both 
performed  baseline  and  post-baseline  measurements  in  triplicate,  measured  QTc  at  the  approximate 
Tmax,  standardized  the  timing  of  ECGs  with  regard  to  meals,  enrolled  both  males  and  females, 
included a within subject placebo control group and included pharmacokinetic sampling to provide for 
ECG/PK time matched pairs.  Study A3051014 is particularly noteworthy for the number of subjects 
(n=120, 40 per treatment regimen) studied, and also for including a 1.5 mg BID dose, i.e., higher than 
the  recommended  dose  of  1  mg  BID.  In  these  studies,  the  placebo-adjusted  mean  changes  from 
baseline  in  QTcF  were  generally  0  msec  or  less,  with  isolated  increases  of  <4  msec.  For  all 
measurements  the  nominal  90%  confidence  interval  excluded  10  msec,  the  threshold  of  concern 
proposed in the ICH E14 guidance. 
Additionally, because of the extensive collection of data in healthy male and female subjects, smokers 
and  non-smokers,  treated  with  both  single-  and  multiple-doses  of  varenicline  or  placebo,  a  model-
based  analysis  was  performed  to  evaluate  the  exposure-response  relationship  between  varenicline 
concentration and the heart rate corrected QT interval (QTc). The results of this analysis show that no 
concentration-related effect of varenicline on QT/QTc prolongation was detected in male and female 
subjects, as evidenced by a mean slope estimate near zero and an upper bound of the 95% confidence 
interval predicting a maximum mean effect on QTc of about 0.3 msec at the recommended 1 mg BID 
dose. Even with factors that can influence the pharmacokinetics of varenicline such as renal function, 
the upper extremes of predicted probability distributions for mean QTc prolongation do not exceed 2 
msec. 
Blood pressure and heart rate 
Varenicline  produced  no  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  standing/sitting  diastolic  or  systolic blood 
pressure  or  pulse  rate  in  Phase  1/2/3  studies.  In  Fixed-dose,  Placebo-controlled  Studies,  median 
changes in blood pressure and pulse rate were comparable in the varenicline and placebo groups. The 
presence  of  an  additional  cardiovascular  risk  factor  did  not  affect  median  change  of  either  variable. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  blood  pressure  or  pulse  rate  measurements  meeting  categorical 
thresholds was small (≤1.5%) and showed no consistent pattern. 
Lipids 
Approximately 25 % of the subject had elevated non-fasting triglycerides without regard to baseline 
values. There were no differences between the varenicline, bupropion and placebo groups. 
Renal function 
Clinical laboratory assessments of renal function included BUN, creatinine, and qualitative urinalysis 
tests. No varenicline-treated subjects in the Phase 2/3 Fixed-Dose, Placebo-Controlled Studies had a 
clinically significant elevation of BUN or creatinine. Among the 3940 varenicline-treated subjects in 
the  Phase  2/3  studies,  3  had  clinically  significant  elevations  of  BUN,  and  none  had  clinically 
significant elevations of creatinine. 
• 
Safety in special populations 
Safety in subgroups 
Analyses  of  the  safety  data  revealed  that  the  safety  and  tolerability  profile  of  varenicline  was 
independent of gender, age, race or presence of cardiovascular risk factors (additional to smoking) and 
within  each  of  these  subgroups  there  was  a  similar  pattern  of  events  in  varenicline-treated  subjects 
compared  with  placebo  subjects.  No  children  younger  than  12  years  have  been  treated  with 
37/44

varenicline. No systematic studies on the use of varenicline in pregnant or lactating women have been 
conducted. 
It  should  be  noticed  that  only  a  small  percentage  of  the  study  population  had  any  concurrent 
cardiovascular  disease  at  study  entrance  (<3%),  and  most  of  them  were  mild  of  nature.  The  lack  of 
experience in this special patient group is compensated for by the applicant´s commitment to perform 
further studies  
Because of the use of bupropion as comparator, many specific populations could not be included in the 
clinical studies. Varenicline is not investigated in subjects with a history of seizures, diabetes mellitus, 
hepatic or renal impairment, bipolar disorder, alcoholism (current or in the recent past). Neither was 
varenicline  investigated  in  combination  with  MAO-inhibitors,  antidepressants,  antipsychotics, 
benzodiazepines,  naltrexon,  systemic  steroids  (with  exception  of  inhaled  steroids),  and  theophylline. 
Cholinergic agents are known to induce psychoses. There were only two cases of acute psychosis (one 
possible  drug-related)  reported  during  varenicline  use.  In  addition,  there  were  3  cases  of  seizures 
reported  after  varenicline  use,  but  none  of  them  was  deemed  to  be  drug-related.  Despite  the  low 
incidence  of  psychoses  and  seizures,  one  should  realise  that  patients  at  risk  had  not  been  included. 
Since  there  is  no  clinical  experience  in  these  special  groups,  no  clear  conclusion  could  be  drawn 
concerning the risk of varenicline treatment in these patients. 
• 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In  anticipation  of  probable  co-administration  in  clinical  practice,  NRT  was  selected  for  drug 
interaction study. In Study A3051033 varenicline (1 mg BID) and NRT (patch, 21 mg/day) were co-
administered  to  smokers  for  12  days.  A  statistically  significant  decrease  (mean  =  2.6  mmHg)  in 
systolic  blood  pressure  was  measured  on  the  final  day  of  the  study.  In  this  study,  the  incidences  of 
nausea,  headache,  fatigue,  vomiting,  dizziness,  and  dyspepsia  were  greater  for  the  combination  than 
for  NRT  alone.  Aside  from  this  interaction,  no  evidence  for  clinically  important  pharmacokinetic 
interactions between varenicline and the other tested drugs were observed. Furthermore no other safety 
concerns were observed. 
• 
Abuse potential 
Examination  of  abuse-potential  adverse  event  terms  in  all  Phase  2/3  fixed-dose,  placebo  controlled 
studies showed that the only preferred term with an incidence in the varenicline groups higher than in 
the  placebo  group  was  somnolence  (4.4%  and  4.0%  for  varenicline  <1  mg  BID  and  1  mg  BID, 
respectively  versus  2.6%  for  placebo).  In  study  A3051002,  where  subjects  were  treated  with 
varenicline  for  six  weeks  followed  by  one  week  placebo,  subjects  did  not  experience  immediate 
relapse  with  the  withdrawal  of  therapy  nor  was  there  any  indication  that  subjects  needed  to  smoke 
additional cigarettes to manage craving and withdrawal symptoms. This observation is consistent with 
the  observations  in  rats  and  monkeys  that  varenicline  does  not  produce  physiological  dependence. 
Study A3051016 demonstrated that when subjects were permitted to adjust their daily dose ad libitum 
between  0.5 mg  and  2  mg,  the  mean  modal  dose  for  varenicline  peaked  at  approximately 1.5  mg  at 
Week 2 and declined to just above 1.0 mg at Week 12, supporting the claim that there is no pattern of 
abuse in subjects treated with varenicline and no psychic dependence liability. 
The  objective  of  the  A3051039  study  was  to  evaluate  the  abuse  potential  of  varenicline  relative  to 
amphetamine in a population of recreational stimulant using subjects. The pattern of effects for both 
smokers  and  non-smokers  is  consistent  with  the  profile  of  a  drug  that  while  having  pharmacologic 
activity  (i.e.  some  known  action),  has  a  dose-response  profile  unlike  amphetamine  and  the  general 
pattern  for  other  drugs  of  abuse.  This  is  based  on  the  multivariate  analysis  of  primary  measures  of 
abuse  potential  and  further  evaluation  of  secondary  parameters,  including  physiological  effects.  For 
smokers,  the  data  provide  evidence  that  subjects  are  unmotivated  to  abuse  varenicline.  For  non-
smokers,  1  mg  varenicline  differentiated  from  placebo  in  the  multivariate  analysis,  specifically  with 
respect to the peak values for the VAS High and ARCI/Cole Abuse Potential scales. The VAS High 
measure, while capturing the sensation of receiving an active drug, was associated with a disliking of 
the  sensation,  especially  compared  with  their  liking  of  amphetamine.  No  reinforcing  effects  were 
38/44

identified  for  varenicline  as  evidenced  by  the  lack  of  significant  difference  from  placebo  on  the 
multiple choice procedure. 
The clinical and non-clinical data collected to date, taken together, indicate that varenicline is unlikely 
to be a substance of abuse. 
• 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In all completed phase 1 and 2/3 studies, 535 among 4748 varenicline treated subject discontinued due 
to AE. Most of the events resulting in discontinuation from treatment were gastrointestinal, nervous, 
and/or psychiatric system events. The median number of days to discontinuation was 28 days for the 
varenicline  1  mg  BID  in  the  fixed-dose,  placebo-controlled  trials.  Few  laboratory  abnormalities 
resulted in treatment discontinuation for more than one subject in the Phase 2/3 Fixed-dose Studies. 
Most  of  the  discontinuations  resulted  from  abnormalities  in  liver  function  tests  (LFTs).    Fifteen 
varenicline-treated  subjects  in  Phase  2/3  Fixed-dose,  Placebo-controlled  studies  and  23  varenicline 
treated subjects in All Completed Phase 2/3 Studies were permanently discontinued due to clinically 
significant elevations in LFT values. 
31  varenicline  treated  subjects  discontinued  treatment  due  to  an  SAE.  Eight  varenicline-treated 
subjects were discontinued due to SAEs that were considered treatment related: 3 subjects experienced 
altered visual acuity/transient loss of vision; 2 subjects were characterized by chest/abdominal pain; 2 
subjects  experienced  multiple  treatment-related  SAEs  affecting  two  or  more  organ  systems;  and  1 
experienced acute psychosis.  Additionally, one varenicline-treated subject had atrial fibrillation which 
was considered treatment related but was not noted until the Week 12 visit (end of treatment).

Discussion on clinical safety   
Overall,  the  analysis  of  routine  adverse  events  identified  no  serious  safety  concerns  in  smokers 
receiving varenicline at doses up to 1 mg BID for up to 12 weeks. 
The  Applicant  recommends  1  mg  BID  dose  for  all  patients,  except  for  patients  with  severe  renal 
dysfunction. However, every patient that would stop varenicline use prematurely due to adverse events 
can  be  considered  as  a  loss,  as  varenicline  is  an  effective  drug  to  promote  smoking  cessation. 
Therefore the CHMP considered that intolerant patients should be given the opportunity to change to a 
regimen of 0.5 mg BID.  The Applicant was asked to introduce the 0.5 mg tablets as a separate pack 
size  to  accommodate  the  need  for  dosing  of  patients  intolerant  of  1.0  mg.  The  Applicant  has 
implemented the requested measure. 
Regarding carcinogenicity, the concern was raised by the fact that hibernomas were identified in rats. 
It  is  agreed  that  the  risk  for  humans  to  develop  hibernomas  following  treatment  with  varenicline  is 
theoretical  and  most  probably  non-existent.  Furthermore,  it  also  agreed  that  the  potential  benefit  of 
smoking  cessation  due  to  treatment  with  varenicline,  which  would  prevent  additional  exposure  to 
known carcinogens from smoking, would be expected to outweigh a hypothetical risk arising from the 
non clinical hibernoma finding. This is taken into account in the Section 5.3 of the SPC. 
Concerning the cardiovascular effects, although there seems to be no suggestion for an increased risk 
for  cardiovascular  adverse  reactions,  the  population of  patients  who  stop  smoking  is  a population  at 
risk  and  therefore  cardiovascular  effects  should  be  included  in  the  safety  specifications  and  be 
monitored.  The  applicant  proposed  that  the  specific  Cardiovascular  Study  and  monitoring  for 
cardiovascular  adverse  events  in  the  COPD  and  Psychosis  Studies  address  the  request  for 
cardiovascular monitoring; the RMP will be updated as part of the follow-up measures. 
Concerning  the  issue  relating  to  rebound,  withdrawal  and  dependence,  this  is  a  general  issue  for 
centrally acting products intended for smoking cessation, and therefore will be included in the safety 
specifications. A label change to address this issue  can be found in Section 4.4 of the SPC where it 
39/44 
©EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
states:    “At  the  end  of  treatment,  discontinuation  of  CHAMPIX  was  associated  with  an  increase  in 
irritability,  urge  to  smoke,  depression,  and  insomnia  in  up  to  3%  of  patients.  The  prescriber  should 
inform the patient accordingly.” 
Concerning  patients  on  antidepressants,  antipsychotic  agents,  benzodiazepines,  anticonvulsants, 
naltrexone, oral hypoglycaemic agents, insulin, steroids and theophylline, it is agreed that these drugs 
show low to very low affinity for the nicotinic α4β2 AchRs and that in turn, varenicline displays very 
low  affinity  for  the  target  receptors  of  these  classes  of  drugs.  Pharmacodynamic  interactions  are 
therefore  unlikely  to  occur.  Nevertheless,  the  Applicant  agreed  to  monitor  for  adverse  events 
associated with drug-drug interactions in the Cardiovascular, COPD and Psychosis studies and modify 
the RMP accordingly. 
As is the case with many medicinal products, there are very limited data from the clinical program on 
the use of varenicline in pregnant women.  The Applicant recognized that some pregnant women may 
potentially  be  exposed  to  varenicline  as  they  attempt  to  stop  smoking.    To  assess  the  safety  of 
varenicline  exposure  during  pregnancy,  the  Applicant  committed  to  conducting  a  prospective  cohort 
study  post-approval  to  compare  women  who  use  varenicline  while  pregnant  to  women  who  smoke 
while pregnant with respect to birth outcomes.  
The Applicant will submit a study protocol to the EMEA within three months of the approval and a 
study report at the time of varenicline renewal. 
The  varenicline  RMP  has  been  updated  to  include  the  above  proposed  prospective  cohort  study  in 
pregnant women.

Pharmacovigilance 
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
In the data submitted the applicant has provided information which ensure that the necessary resources 
and systems are in place to support routine pharmacovigilance activities that meet the needs for this 
product. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.    
Risk Management Plan  
The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan. 
Based on the results from the non-clinical and clinical development program, the Applicant identified 
areas of potential risk and areas with limited information, for continued pharmacovigilance.  
Potential Risks: Effects of smoking cessation 
Areas with Limited Information: Very elderly subjects (≥75 years old); cardiovascular Patients; COPD 
Patients; Psychosis Patients; Pregnancy; Adolescents and Overdose. 
Post-launch  safety  monitoring  activities  will  include  routine  periodic  database  searches  for  any 
varenicline  report  of  a  Designated  Medical  Event  (DME,  a  predetermined  list  of  medical  events 
considered to be clinically important and frequently associated with drug use), adverse events reported 
in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  and/or  aged  75  years  or  older.  In  addition,  reviews  of  all 
events  received  post-launch  will  be  conducted  periodically  and  following  the  cut-off  date  of  each 
Periodic safety Update Report (PSUR). 
Routine pharmacovigilance will be employed. The Applicant will provide reviews of adverse events 
associated with the use of varenicline, and specific reviews of events reported in patients with severe 
renal impairment, in patients older than 74 years of age or younger than 18 years of age, overdose and

effects  of  use  during  pregnancy  (mother  and  child)  in  PSURs.  In  addition,  specific  studies  in 
cardiovascular,  COPD,  and  psychosis  subjects,  adolescents  and  the  prospective  cohort  study  in 
pregnancy also will be conducted.

2.1  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology were sufficiently documented in the non-clinal  
studies  program,  except  for  the  functional  immunological  evaluation  of  varenicline  in  an  animal 
model.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  will  perform  a  functional  immunotoxicity  study  as  a  post-approval 
commitment.  
Efficacy 
One  thousand  one  hundred  ninety-eight  (1198)  subjects  were  treated  with  varenicline  and  805  were 
treated with  placebo for up to 12 weeks in Studies A3051028, -36, -07/18.  Six hundred ninety-two 
(692)  and  669  subjects  were  treated  with  varenicline  or  bupropion,  respectively,  in  Phase  III  trials 
42/44

A3051028 and –36.  In Study A3051035, 1927 subjects were treated with open-label varenicline for 
up to 12 weeks; of these 1236 (64.1%) had stopped smoking by Week 12.  One thousand two hundred 
six (1206) subjects (602 varenicline, 604 placebo) were subsequently randomised and received up to 
12 additional weeks of double-blind treatment.   
Across the above-mentioned 12-week trials, varenicline was superior to placebo for smoking cessation 
at doses of 0.5 mg BID and 1 mg BID:  Approximately 46% of the smokers in the 0.5 mg BID and 1 
mg  BID  varenicline  groups  had  stopped  smoking  over  the  last  4  weeks  of  treatment  (Weeks  9-12), 
compared with 17% in the placebo arm.   
Varenicline was also superior to bupropion at the end of the 12 weeks treatment.  In pooled Studies 
A3051028, and -36, 44% of subjects treated with varenicline at 1 mg BID stopped smoking at Weeks 
9-12 compared with 30% of bupropion-treated subjects.  
In  the  pooled  Studies  A3051028,  -36,  and  –07/18,  23%  of  subjects  treated  with  varenicline  at  1  mg 
BID  were  still  abstinent  at  Week  52  compared  with  9%  in  the  placebo  arm.    In  pooled  Studies 
A3501028 and –36, 23% of varenicline treated subjects remained abstinent at Week 52 compared with 
16% in the bupropion group.   
In Study A3051035, subjects who received varenicline for an additional 12 weeks had higher 
abstinence rates at both Weeks 13-24 (71%) and Weeks 13-52 (44%) than the placebo group at the 
corresponding intervals (50% and 37%, respectively).   
Safety 
A total of 5944 subjects (3940 varenicline, 795 bupropion, 1209 placebo) comprised the varenicline 
Phase 2/3 safety database.  In all completed Phase 2/3 studies, 1531 subjects have received varenicline 
1 mg BID for >12 weeks, 456 subjects for >24 weeks and 112 subjects for ≥ 52 weeks. 
The  most  commonly  observed  (≥10%)  treatment-related  adverse  events  (AEs)  in  varenicline-treated 
subjects in all completed Phase 2/3 studies were nausea, insomnia, abnormal  dreams, and headache. 
Overall,  10.7%  of  varenicline-treated  subjects  discontinued  treatment  due  to  a  treatment-related 
adverse  event;  12.9%  of  varenicline-treated  subjects  discontinued  treatment  due  to  an  all  causality 
adverse event.  
Some other special patients’ groups were eligible for the varenicline trials, such as elderly and patients 
with  cardiovascular  diseases,  but  only  low  numbers  were  included.  It  is  therefore  difficult  to  draw 
conclusions  concerning  safety  for  these  special  patients’  groups,  and  these  patients  should  be 
monitored when varenicline is prescribed (see Risk Management Plan). 
Overall, the well-established risks of smoking use outweigh the risks of varenicline, and this product is 
considered favourable from a safety point of view. 
The safety profile of varenicline is considered acceptable, since the majority of AEs were reversible 
and not in need of acute medical attention. Most subjects became tolerant to nausea in due time. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

Risk-benefit assessment 
Tobacco  smoke  is  a  major  preventable  factor  in  the  development  of  a  number  of  life-threatening 
diseases  such  as  ischaemic  heart  disease,  cancers  and  COPD.  Nicotine  is  a  strong  addictive  agent 
which  is  reflected  in  the  low  spontaneous  quitting  rate  and  rate  of  continuous  abstinence  among 
quitters  not  using  any  pharmacological  aid.  Nicotine  replacement  therapy  and  bupropion  roughly 
doubles the chances for a successful attempt to quit as compared to no pharmacological aid, but there 
is still a need for therapies to aid smoking cessation in both healthy smokers and especially in patients 
with smoking-related diseases. 
In three 12-week trials, varenicline at 1 mg BID was superior to placebo for stopping smoking at both 
the end of treatment and at one year from the start of the study. Forty-six percent (46%) of subjects 
treated with varenicline at 0.5 mg BID or 1 mg BID stopped smoking during the last 4 weeks of a 12-
week  treatment  period  (versus  17%  in  the  placebo  arm);  the  long-term  abstinence  rate  (ie  to  1  year 
from  the  start  of  the  study)  was  23%  in  subjects  treated  with  varenicline  compared  with  9%  in 
placebo-treated subjects.   
The most common treatment-related adverse events were nausea (reported by approximately 30% of 
patients),  insomnia,  abnormal  dreams,  and  headache.  Most  of  these  symptoms,  including  nausea, 
decreased over time.   Overall, 10.7% of varenicline-treated subjects discontinued treatment due to a 
treatment-related adverse event; 12.9% discontinued treatment due to an all causality adverse event. 
Some other special patients’ groups were eligible for the varenicline trials, such as elderly and patients 
with  cardiovascular  diseases,  but  only  low  numbers  were  included.  Therefore  these  patients  will 
bemonitored post marketing (see Risk Management Plan). 
Efficacy  was  demonstrated,  and  overall,  the  well-established  risks  of  smoking  outweigh  the  risks  of 
varenicline.  
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
(cid:131)  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed 
to investigate further some of the safety concerns 
and  
(cid:131)  the following follow-up measures were needed: 
o  an immunotoxicity study in an appropriate model, will be  performed; 
o  a  prospective cohort study to compare women who use varenicline while pregnant to 
women who smoke while pregnant with respect to birth outcomes will be conducted; 
o  a protocol for a study in patients with psychosis will be provided 
o  information on the feasibility of performing a study for evaluating dose tapering 
versus abrupt discontinuation in terms of efficacy  will be provided 
o  final results of on-going clinical studies will be reported 
o  the Risk management Plan will be updated, in line with the CHMP Guideline on Risk 
Management Systems for medicinal products for human use 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus  decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Champix  in  approved  indication  of  smoking 
cessation was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Dasselta is indicated in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older for the relief of symptoms 
associated with: 
- 
- 
allergic rhinitis (see section 5.1), 
urticaria (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and over) 
The recommended dose of Dasselta is one tablet once a day. 
Intermittent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or for less than 
4 weeks) should be managed in accordance with the evaluation of patient’s disease history and the 
treatment could be discontinued after symptoms are resolved and reinitiated upon their reappearance. 
In persistent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than 
4 weeks), continued treatment may be proposed to the patients during the allergen exposure periods. 
Paediatric population 
There is limited clinical trial efficacy experience with the use of desloratadine in adolescents 12 
through 17 years of age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
The safety and efficacy of Dasselta 5 mg film-coated tablets in children below the age of 12 years 
have not been established. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
The tablet can be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to loratadine.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
In the case of severe renal insufficiency, Dasselta should be used with caution (see section 5.2). 
Desloratadine should be administered with caution in patients with medical or familial history of 
seizures, and mainly young children (see section 4.8), being more susceptible to develop new seizures 
under desloratadine treatment. Healthcare providers may consider discontinuing desloratadine in 
patients who experience a seizure while on treatment. 
Dasselta contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No clinically relevant interactions were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets in which 
erythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
In a clinical pharmacology trial desloratadine tablets taken concomitantly with alcohol did not 
potentiate the performance impairing effects of alcohol (see section 5.1). However, cases of alcohol 
intolerance and intoxication have been reported during post marketing use. Therefore, caution is 
recommended if alcohol is taken concomitantly. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no 
malformative nor foeto/ neonatal toxicity of desloratadine. Animal studies do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of desloratadine during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Desloratadine has been identified in breastfed newborns/infants of treated women. The effect of 
desloratadine on newborns/infants is unknown. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from desloratadine therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data available on male and female fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Desloratadine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines based on clinical 
trials. Patients should be informed that most people do not experience drowsiness. Nevertheless, as 
there is individual variation in response to all medicinal products, it is recommended that patients are 
advised not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or using machines, 
until they have established their own response to the medicinal product. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical trials in a range of indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at 
the recommended dose of 5 mg daily, undesirable effects with desloratadine were reported in 3 % of 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients in excess of those treated with placebo. The most frequent of adverse reactions reported in 
excess of placebo were fatigue (1.2 %), dry mouth (0.8 %) and headache (0.6 %). 
Paediatric population 
In a clinical trial with 578 adolescent patients, 12 through 17 years of age, the most common adverse 
event was headache; this occurred in 5.9 % of patients treated with desloratadine and 6.9 % of patients 
receiving placebo. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The frequency of the clinical trial adverse reactions reported in excess of placebo and other 
undesirable effects reported during the post-marketing period are listed in the following table. 
Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 
to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated 
from the available data).

Paediatric population 
Other undesirable effects reported during the post-marketing period in paediatric patients with an 
unknown frequency included QT prolongation, arrhythmia, bradycardia, abnormal behaviour and 
aggression. 
A retrospective observational safety study indicated an increased incidence of new-onset seizure in 
patients 0 to 19 years of age when receiving desloratadine compared with periods not receiving 
desloratadine. Among children 0-4 years old, the adjusted absolute increase was 37.5 (95% 
Confidence Interval (CI) 10.5-64.5) per 100,000 person years (PY) with a background rate of new 
onset seizure of 80.3 per 100,000 PY. Among patients 5-19 years of age, the adjusted absolute 
increase was 11.3 (95% CI 2.3-20.2) per 100,000 PY with a background rate of 36.4 per 100,000 PY.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to 
that seen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher. 
Treatment 
In the event of overdose, consider standard measures to remove unabsorbed active substance. 
Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. 
Desloratadine is not eliminated by haemodialysis; it is not known if it is eliminated by peritoneal 
dialysis. 
Symptoms 
Based on a multiple dose clinical trial, in which up to 45 mg of desloratadine was administered 
(nine times the clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed. 
Paediatric population 
The adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to 
that seen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other antihistamines for systemic use, ATC code: R06AX27 
Mechanism of action 
Desloratadine is a non-sedating, long-acting histamine antagonist with selective peripheral H1-receptor 
antagonist activity. After oral administration, desloratadine selectively blocks peripheral histamine H1-
receptors because the substance is excluded from entry to the central nervous system. 
Desloratadine has demonstrated antiallergic properties from in vitro studies. These include inhibiting 
the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 from human mast 
cells/basophils, as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin on 
endothelial cells. The clinical relevance of these observations remains to be confirmed. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In a multiple dose clinical trial, in which up to 20 mg of desloratadine was administered daily for 14 
days, no statistically or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was observed. In a clinical 
pharmacology trial, in which desloratadine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the 
clinical dose) for ten days, no prolongation of QTc interval was seen. 
No clinically relevant changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed in multiple-dose 
ketoconazole and erythromycin interaction trials. 
Desloratadine does not readily penetrate the central nervous system. In controlled clinical trials, at the 
recommended dose of 5 mg daily, there was no excess incidence of somnolence as compared to 
placebo. Desloratadine given at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg did not affect psychomotor performance 
in clinical trials. In a single dose study performed in adults, desloratadine 5 mg did not affect standard 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measures of flight performance including exacerbation of subjective sleepiness or tasks related to 
flying. 
In clinical pharmacology trials, co-administration with alcohol did not increase the alcohol-induced 
impairment in performance or increase in sleepiness. No significant differences were found in the 
psychomotor test results between desloratadine and placebo groups, whether administered alone or 
with alcohol. 
In patients with allergic rhinitis, desloratadine was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, 
nasal discharge and itching, as well as ocular itching, tearing and redness, and itching of palate. 
Desloratadine effectively controlled symptoms for 24 hours. 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy of desloratadine tablets has not been clearly demonstrated in trials with adolescent 
patients 12 through 17 years of age. 
In addition to the established classifications of seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can 
alternatively be classified as intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis according to 
the duration of symptoms. Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of symptoms for less 
than 4 days per week or for less than 4 weeks. Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of 
symptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than 4 weeks. 
Desloratadine was effective in alleviating the burden of seasonal allergic rhinitis as shown by the total 
score of the rhino-conjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire. The greatest amelioration was seen in the 
domains of practical problems and daily activities limited by symptoms. 
Chronic idiopathic urticaria was studied as a clinical model for urticarial conditions, since the 
underlying pathophysiology is similar, regardless of etiology, and because chronic patients can be 
more easily recruited prospectively. Since histamine release is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, 
desloratadine is expected to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for other urticarial conditions, 
in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, as advised in clinical guidelines. 
In two placebo-controlled six week trials in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, desloratadine 
was effective in relieving pruritus and decreasing the size and number of hives by the end of the first 
dosing interval. In each trial, the effects were sustained over the 24 hour dosing interval. As with other 
antihistamine trials in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who were identified as 
nonresponsive to antihistamines was excluded. An improvement in pruritus of more than 50 % was 
observed in 55 % of patients treated with desloratadine compared with 19 % of patients treated with 
placebo. Treatment with desloratadine also significantly reduced interference with sleep and daytime 
function, as measured by a four-point scale used to assess these variables. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Desloratadine plasma concentrations can be detected within 30 minutes of administration. 
Desloratadine is well absorbed with maximum concentration achieved after approximately 3 hours; the 
terminal phase half-life is approximately 27 hours. The degree of accumulation of desloratadine was 
consistent with its half-life (approximately 27 hours) and a once daily dosing frequency. The 
bioavailability of desloratadine was dose proportional over the range of 5 mg to 20 mg. 
In a pharmacokinetic trial in which patient demographics were comparable to those of the general 
seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4 % of the subjects achieved a higher concentration of 
desloratadine. This percentage may vary according to ethnic background. Maximum desloratadine 
concentration was about 3-fold higher at approximately 7 hours with a terminal phase half-life of 
approximately 89 hours. The safety profile of these subjects was not different from that of the general 
population. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Desloratadine is moderately bound (83 % - 87 %) to plasma proteins. There is no evidence of 
clinically relevant medicine accumulation following once daily dosing of desloratadine (5 mg to 
20 mg) for 14 days. 
Biotransformation 
The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and therefore, 
some interactions with other medicinal products can not be fully excluded. Desloratadine does not 
inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not inhibit 
CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. 
Elimination 
In a single dose trial using a 7.5 mg dose of desloratadine, there was no effect of food (high-fat, high 
caloric breakfast) on the disposition of desloratadine. In another study, grapefruit juice had no effect 
on the disposition of desloratadine. 
Renally impaired patients 
The pharmacokinetics of desloratadine in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) was 
compared with that of healthy subjects in one single-dose study and one multiple dose study. In the 
single-dose study, the exposure to desloratadine was approximately 2 and 2.5-fold greater in subjects 
with mild to moderate and severe CRI, respectively, than in healthy subjects. In the multiple-dose 
study, steady state was reached after Day 11, and compared to healthy subjects the exposure to 
desloratadine was ~1.5-fold greater in subjects with mild to moderate CRI and ~2.5-fold greater in 
subjects with severe CRI. In both studies, changes in exposure (AUC and Cmax) of desloratadine and 
3-hydroxydesloratadine were not clinically relevant. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Desloratadine is the primary active metabolite of loratadine. Non-clinical studies conducted with 
desloratadine and loratadine demonstrated that there are no qualitative or quantitative differences in 
the toxicity profile of desloratadine and loratadine at comparable levels of exposure to desloratadine. 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development. The lack of carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in studies conducted with 
desloratadine and loratadine.

1.  What Dasselta is and what it is used for 
What Dasselta is 
Dasselta contains desloratadine which is an antihistamine. 
How Dasselta works 
Dasselta is an antiallergy medicine that does not make you drowsy. It helps control your allergic 
reaction and its symptoms. 
When Dasselta should be used 
Dasselta relieves symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal passages 
caused by an allergy, for example, hay fever or allergy to dust mites) in adults and adolescents 12 
years of age and older. These symptoms include sneezing, runny or itchy nose, itchy palate, and itchy, 
red or watery eyes. 
Dasselta is also used to relieve the symptoms associated with urticaria (a skin condition caused by an 
allergy). These symptoms include itching and hives. 
Relief of these symptoms lasts a full day and helps you to resume your normal daily activities and 
sleep.

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS 
OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S)  
ANNEX IV 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for desloratadine, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data from the literature including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a 
positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC 
considers a causal relationship between desloratadine and depressed mood is at least a reasonable 
possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing desloratadine 
should be amended accordingly. 
As described in the literature and signal section of some MAHs, WHO identified a potential safety 
signal of dry eyes for desloratadine during the reporting period. Based on the anticholinergic 
properties of desloratadine and strengthened by the reports with a short time to onset and both de- and 
rechallenges described, the PRAC considers that “eye dryness” should be considered for inclusion in 
the product labels and patient leaflets. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for desloratadine the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing desloratadine is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

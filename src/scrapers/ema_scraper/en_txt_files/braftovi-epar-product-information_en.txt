CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Encorafenib is indicated: 
- in combination with binimetinib for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
- in combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
(CRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, who have received prior systemic therapy (see sections 4.4 and 
5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Encorafenib treatment should be initiated and supervised under the responsibility of a physician 
experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products. 
Posology 
Melanoma 
The recommended dose of encorafenib is 450 mg (six 75 mg capsules) once daily, when used in 
combination with binimetinib.

Colorectal cancer  
The recommended dose of encorafenib is 300 mg (four 75 mg capsules) once daily, when used in 
combination with cetuximab.  
Dose modification 
Melanoma 
The management of adverse reactions may require dose reduction, temporary interruption or treatment 
discontinuation of encorafenib (see Tables 1, 3 and 4). 
For information on the posology and recommended dose modifications of binimetinib, see section 4.2 
of binimetinib Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).     
Dose reduction recommendations for encorafenib are presented in Table 1.

Dose level 
Encorafenib dose  
when used in combination with binimetinib 
Six 75 mg (450 mg) capsules once daily 
Starting dose 
1st dose reduction 
Four 75 mg (300 mg) capsules once daily 
2nd dose reduction   Three 75 mg (225 mg) capsules once daily 
Subsequent 
modification 
There are limited data for dose reduction to 100 mg once daily.  
Encorafenib should be permanently discontinued if patient is unable to 
tolerate 100 mg (two 50 mg capsules) once daily.   
Administration of encorafenib at a dose of 450 mg once daily as a single agent is not recommended. If 
binimetinib is temporarily interrupted, encorafenib should be reduced at 300 mg once daily during the 
time of binimetinib dose interruption (see section 4.2 of binimetinib SmPC) as encorafenib is not 
well-tolerated at the dose of 450 mg as a single agent. If binimetinib is permanently discontinued, 
encorafenib should be discontinued. 
If encorafenib is temporarily interrupted (see Tables 3 and 4), binimetinib should be interrupted. If 
encorafenib is permanently discontinued, then binimetinib should be discontinued.  
If treatment-related toxicities occur, then encorafenib and binimetinib should be dose reduced, 
interrupted or discontinued. Dose modifications are necessary for binimetinib only (adverse reactions 
primarily related to binimetinib) for the following: retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED), 
retinal vein occlusion (RVO), interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis, cardiac dysfunction, creatine 
phosphokinase (CK) elevation and rhabdomyolysis, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). 
If one of these toxicities occurs, see section 4.2 of binimetinib SmPC for dose modification 
instructions for binimetinib. 
Colorectal cancer 
The management of adverse reactions may require dose reduction, temporary interruption or treatment 
discontinuation of encorafenib (see Tables 2, 3 and 4). 
For information on the posology and recommended dose modifications of cetuximab, see section 4.2 
of cetuximab SmPC. 
Dose reduction recommendations for encorafenib are presented in Table 2.

Duration of treatment 
Treatment should continue until the patient no longer derives benefit or the development of 
unacceptable toxicity. 
Missed doses 
If a dose of encorafenib is missed, the patient should only take the missed dose if it is more than 
12 hours until the next scheduled dose.  
Vomiting 
In case of vomiting after administration of encorafenib, the patient should not take an additional dose 
and should take the next scheduled dose. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
No dose adjustment is required for patients aged 65 years and older (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment may have increased encorafenib exposure (see 
section 5.2).  
Administration of encorafenib should be undertaken with caution at a dose of 300 mg once daily in 
patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). 
No dosing recommendation can be made in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe 
(Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment based on a 
population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis. There are no clinical data with encorafenib in patients 
with severe renal impairment. Therefore, the potential need for dose adjustment cannot be determined. 
Encorafenib should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2).  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of encorafenib have not yet been established in children and adolescents. No 
data are available.

Method of administration  
Braftovi is for oral use. The capsules are to be swallowed whole with water. They may be taken with 
or without food. The concomitant administration of encorafenib with grapefruit juice should be 
avoided (see sections 4.4 and 4.5)  
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Encorafenib is to be given in combination with binimetinib (for patients with BRAF V600 mutant 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma), or in combination with cetuximab (for patients with BRAF 
V600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer). For additional information on warnings and 
precautions associated with binimetinib or cetuximab treatment, see section 4.4 of binimetinib 
SmPC or cetuximab SmPC. 
BRAF mutation testing 
Before taking encorafenib, patients must have unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600 
mutation or metastatic colorectal cancer with BRAF V600E mutation confirmed by a validated test. 
The efficacy and safety of encorafenib have been established only in patients with melanoma tumours 
expressing BRAF V600E and V600K mutations or colorectal tumours expressing BRAF V600E 
mutation. Encorafenib should not be used in patients with wild type BRAF malignant melanoma or 
wild type BRAF colorectal cancer. 
Encorafenib in combination with binimetinib in patients who have progressed on a BRAF inhibitor 
There are limited data for the use of the combination of encorafenib with binimetinib in patients who 
have progressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor given for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma with BRAF V600 mutation. These data show that the efficacy of the combination would be 
lower in these patients.  
Encorafenib in combination with binimetinib in patients with brain metastases 
There are limited efficacy data with the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib in patients with a 
BRAF V600 mutant melanoma which have metastasised to the brain (see section 5.1). 
Left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) 
LVD defined as symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction has been reported when 
encorafenib is used in combination with binimetinib. It is recommended that left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) is assessed by echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan before 
initiation of encorafenib and binimetinib, one month after initiation, and then at approximately 3-
month intervals or more frequently as clinically indicated, while on treatment. If during treatment 
LVD occurs, see section 4.2 of binimetinib SmPC.  
The safety of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib has not been established in patients with a 
baseline LVEF that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower limits of normal. Therefore, in 
these patients, binimetinib should be used with caution and for any symptomatic left ventricular 
dysfunction, Grade 3-4 LVEF decrease or for absolute decrease of LVEF from baseline of ≥ 10%, 
binimetinib and encorafenib should be discontinued and LVEF should be evaluated every 2 weeks 
until recovery.

Haemorrhage 
Haemorrhages, including major haemorrhagic events, can occur with encorafenib (see section 4.8). 
The risk of haemorrhage may be increased with concomitant use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet 
therapy. The occurrence of Grade ≥3 haemorrhagic events should be managed with dose interruption 
or treatment discontinuation (see Table 4 in section 4.2) and as clinically indicated. 
Ocular toxicities 
Ocular toxicities including uveitis, iritis, and iridocyclitis can occur when encorafenib is administered. 
RPED has also been reported in patients treated with encorafenib in combination with binimetinib (see 
section 4.8). 
Patients should be assessed at each visit for symptoms of new or worsening visual disturbance. If 
symptoms of new or worsening visual disturbances including diminished central vision, blurred vision 
or loss of vision are identified, a prompt ophthalmologic examination is recommended.  
If uveitis including iridocyclitis and iritis occurs during treatment, see section 4.2.  
If during treatment patient develops RPED or RVO, see section 4.2 of binimetinib SmPC for guidance. 
QT prolongation 
QT Prolongation has been observed in patients treated with BRAF-inhibitors. A thorough QT study to 
evaluate the QT prolongation potential of encorafenib has not been conducted.  
Overall, results suggest that single agent encorafenib has the potential to cause mild increases in heart 
rate. Across pooled combination studies of encorafenib and binimetinib at the recommended doses and 
a single-agent encorafenib study, results suggest that encorafenib has the potential to result in small 
increases in QTc interval (see section 5.1). 
There are insufficient data to exclude a clinically significant exposure dependent QT prolongation. 
Due to the potential risk for QT prolongation, it is recommended that serum electrolytes abnormalities, 
including magnesium and potassium, are corrected and risk factors for QT prolongation controlled 
(e.g. congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias) before treatment initiation and during treatment. 
It is recommended that an electrocardiogram (ECG) is assessed before initiation of encorafenib, one 
month after initiation, and then at approximately 3-month intervals or more frequently as clinically 
indicated, while on treatment. The occurrence of QTc prolongation can be managed with dose 
reduction, interruption or discontinuation with correction of abnormal electrolytes and control of risk 
factors (see section 4.2). 
New primary malignancies 
New primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, have been observed in patients treated with 
BRAF inhibitors and can occur when encorafenib is administered (see section 4.8). 
Cutaneous malignancies 
Cutaneous malignancies such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) including 
kerathoacanthoma have been observed in patients treated with BRAF-inhibitors including encorafenib. 
New primary melanoma has been observed in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors including 
encorafenib (see section 4.8). 
Dermatologic evaluations should be performed prior to initiation of therapy with encorafenib, every 
2 months while on therapy and for up to 6 months following treatment discontinuation. Suspicious 
skin lesions should be managed with dermatological excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. 
Patients should be instructed to immediately inform their physicians if new skin lesions develop. 
Encorafenib should be continued without any dose modification.  
Non-cutaneous malignancies 
Based on its mechanism of action, encorafenib may promote malignancies associated with activation 
of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms. Patients receiving encorafenib should undergo a head 
and neck examination, chest/abdomen computerised tomography (CT) scan, anal and pelvic 
examinations (for women) and complete blood cell counts prior to initiation, during and at the end of 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment as clinically appropriate. It should be considered to permanently discontinue encorafenib in 
patients who develop RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies. Benefits and risks should 
be carefully considered before administering encorafenib to patients with a prior or concurrent cancer 
associated with RAS mutation. 
Liver laboratory abnormalities 
Liver laboratory abnormalities including AST and ALT elevations have been observed with 
encorafenib (see section 4.8). Liver laboratory values should be monitored before initiation of 
encorafenib and monitored at least monthly during the 6 first months of treatment, then as clinically 
indicated. Liver laboratory abnormalities should be managed with dose interruption, reduction or 
treatment discontinuation (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
As encorafenib is primarily metabolised and eliminated via the liver, patients with mild to severe 
hepatic impairment may have increased encorafenib exposure over the range of inter-subject 
variability exposure (see section 5.2).  
In the absence of clinical data, encorafenib is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment.  
Administration of encorafenib should be undertaken with caution at a dose of 300 mg once daily in 
patients with mild hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).  
Closer monitoring of encorafenib related toxicities in patients with mild hepatic impairment is 
recommended, including clinical examination and liver function tests, with assessment of ECGs as 
clinically appropriate during treatment. 
Renal impairment 
There are no data available in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Encorafenib should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. Creatinine 
elevation has been commonly reported with encorafenib as single agent or in combination with 
binimetinib or cetuximab. Observed cases of renal failure including acute kidney injury and renal 
impairment were generally associated with vomiting and dehydration. Other contributing factors 
included diabetes and hypertension. Blood creatinine should be monitored as clinically indicated and 
creatinine elevation managed with dose modification or discontinuation (see Table 4 in section 4.2). 
Patients should ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. 
Effects of other medicinal products on encorafenib. 
Concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with encorafenib should be avoided. If 
concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor is necessary, patients should be carefully monitored 
for safety (see section 4.5). 
Caution should be exercised if a moderate CYP3A inhibitor is co-administered with encorafenib. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Effects of other medicinal products on encorafenib 
Encorafenib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4. 
CYP3A4 inhibitors  
Co-administration of moderate (diltiazem) and strong (posaconazole) CYP3A4 inhibitors with single 
doses of encorafenib in healthy volunteers resulted in a 2 and 3-fold increase in the area under the 
concentration-time curve (AUC), respectively and in 44.6% and 68.3% increase in maximum 
encorafenib concentration (Cmax) respectively.  
Model based predictions indicate that the effect of posaconazole after repeated administrations could 
be similar for AUC (3-fold increase) and slightly greater for Cmax (2.7-fold increase). Model-based 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
predictions for ketoconazole suggest an increase of approx. 5-fold for encorafenib AUC and 3 to 4-
fold for encorafenib Cmax after administration of encorafenib 450 and 300 mg QD, respectively. 
Therefore, concomitant administration of encorafenib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be 
avoided (due to increased encorafenib exposure and potential increase in toxicity, see section 5.2). 
Examples of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include, but are not limited to, ritonavir, itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, telithromycin, posaconazole and grapefruit juice. If concomitant use of a strong 
CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, patients should be carefully monitored for safety. 
Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should be co-administered with caution. Examples of moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors include, but are not limited to, amiodarone, erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, 
amprenavir and imatinib. When encorafenib is co-administered with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, 
patients should be carefully monitored for safety. 
CYP3A4 inducers 
Co-administration of encorafenib with a strong CYP3A4 inducer was not assessed in a clinical study; 
however, a reduction in encorafenib exposure is likely and may result in compromised efficacy of 
encorafenib. Examples of strong CYP3A4 inducers include, but are not limited to carbamazepine, 
rifampicin, phenytoin and St. John’s Wort. Alternative agents with no to moderate CYP3A induction 
potential should be considered.  
Effects of encorafenib on other medicinal products 
CYP substrates 
Encorafenib is a strong inducer of CYP3A4. Concomitant use with agents that are substrates of 
CYP3A4 (e.g., hormonal contraceptives) may result in loss of efficacy of these agents. If the 
coadministration of narrow therapeutic index CYP3A4 substrates cannot be avoided, adjust the dose of 
these substrates in accordance with their approved SmPC.  
Encorafenib is an inhibitor of UGT1A1. Concomitant agents that are substrates of UGT1A1 (e.g. 
raltegravir, atorvastatin, dolutegravir) may have increased exposure and should be therefore 
administered with caution.  
Effect of encorafenib on binimetinib 
While encorafenib is a relatively potent reversible inhibitor of UGT1A1, no differences in binimetinib 
exposure have been observed clinically when binimetinib was co-administered with encorafenib. 
Transporter substrates 
In vivo, encorafenib is an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and/or BCRP. Coadministration of 
encorafenib with OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or BCRP substrates (such as rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, 
methotrexate) can result in increased concentrations (see section 5.2). 
In vitro, encorafenib potentially inhibits a number of other transporters. Agents that are substrates of 
renal transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 (such as furosemide, penicillin) or agents that are substrates of 
the hepatic transporters OCT1 (such as, bosentan) or substrates of P-gp (e.g. posaconazole) may also 
have increased exposure. 
Therefore, these agents, substrates of transporters should be co-administered with caution. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in females  
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with encorafenib 
and for at least 1 month following the last dose. Encorafenib may decrease the efficacy of hormonal 
contraceptives (see section 4.5). Therefore, female patients using hormonal contraception are advised 
to use an additional or alternative method such as a barrier method (e.g. condom) during treatment 
with encorafenib and for at least 1 month following the last dose. 
Pregnancy 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are no data from the use of encorafenib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
Encorafenib is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. If encorafenib is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking 
encorafenib, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether encorafenib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
breastfed newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue encorafenib therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding 
for the child and the benefit of therapy for the mother.  
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of encorafenib on fertility in humans. Based on findings in animals, 
the use of encorafenib may impact fertility in males of reproductive potential (see section 5.3). As the 
clinical relevance of this is unknown, male patients should be informed of the potential risk for 
impaired spermatogenesis. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Encorafenib has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Visual disturbances have 
been reported in some patients treated with encorafenib during clinical studies. Patients should be 
advised not to drive or use machines if they experience visual disturbances or any other adverse 
reactions that may affect their ability to drive and use machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of safety profile  
The safety of encorafenib (450 mg orally once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg orally 
twice daily) was evaluated in 274 patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma (hereafter referred to as the pooled Combo 450 population), based on two Phase II studies 
(CMEK162X2110 and CLGX818X2109) and one Phase III study (CMEK162B2301, Part 1).  
At the recommended dose (n = 274) in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, the most 
common adverse reactions (>25%) occurring in patients treated with encorafenib administered with 
binimetinib were fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, retinal detachment, abdominal pain, arthralgia, 
blood CK increased and myalgia.  
The safety of encorafenib (300 mg orally once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg orally 
twice daily) was evaluated in 257 patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma (hereafter referred to as the Combo 300 population), based on the Phase III study 
(CMEK162B2301, Part 2). The most common adverse reactions (>25%) occurring in patients treated 
with encorafenib 300 mg administered with binimetinib were fatigue, nausea and diarrhoea. 
The encorafenib single agent (300 mg orally once daily) safety profile is based on data from 
217 patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600-mutant melanoma (hereafter referred to as 
the pooled encorafenib 300 population). The most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (>25%) 
reported with encorafenib 300 were hyperkeratosis, alopecia, PPES, fatigue, rash, arthralgia, dry skin, 
nausea, myalgia, headache, vomiting and pruritus. 
The safety of encorafenib (300 mg orally once daily) in combination with cetuximab (dosed as per its 
SmPC) was evaluated in 216 patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer, based 
on the phase III study ARRAY-818-302. The most common ADRs (>25%) reported in this population 
were: fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, dermatitis acneiform, abdominal pain, arthralgia/musculoskeletal 
pain, decreased appetite, rash and vomiting.

(62 %) were < 65 years old, 62 patients (28.7%) were 65-74 years old and 20 patients (9.3%) were 
aged ≥ 75. The most common adverse reactions reported with a higher incidence in patients aged 
≥ 65 years compared to patients aged < 65 years included, vomiting, pain in extremity and dizziness.  
In both melanoma and colorectal cancer populations, due to a very small number of patients treated in 
the age subgroup of patients aged ≥ 75 years, differences in the incidence of adverse reactions 
compared to patients aged < 75 years could not be assessed. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

hypercreatinaemia) was observed in 3 out of 14 patients. The highest administered dose occurred as a 
dosing error in one patient who took encorafenib at a dose of 600 mg twice daily for 1 day (total dose 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1200 mg). Adverse reactions reported by this patient were Grade 1 events of nausea, vomiting and 
blurred vision; all subsequently resolved. 
Management 
There is no specific treatment for overdose.  
Since encorafenib is moderately bound to plasma proteins, haemodialysis is likely to be ineffective in 
the treatment of overdose with encorafenib. There is no known antidote for encorafenib. In the event 
of an overdose, encorafenib treatment should be interrupted and renal function must be monitored as 
well as adverse reactions. Symptomatic treatment and supportive care should be provided as needed.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EC03 
Mechanism of action 
Encorafenib is a potent and highly selective ATP-competitive small molecule RAF kinase inhibitor. 
The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of encorafenib against BRAF V600E, BRAF and 
CRAF enzymes was determined to be 0.35, 0.47 and 0.30 nM, respectively. The encorafenib 
dissociation half-life was >30 hours and resulted in prolonged pERK inhibition. Encorafenib 
suppresses the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in tumour cells expressing several mutated forms of BRAF 
kinase (V600E, D and K). Specifically, encorafenib inhibits in vitro and in vivo BRAF V600E, D and 
K mutant melanoma cell growth and BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer cell growth. Encorafenib 
does not inhibit RAF/MEK/ERK signalling in cells expressing wild-type BRAF. 
Combination with binimetinib  
Encorafenib and binimetinib (a MEK inhibitor, see section 5.1 of binimetinib SmPC) both inhibit the 
MAPK pathway, resulting in higher anti-tumour activity. 
Additionally, the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib prevented the emergence of resistance in 
BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in vivo.  
Combination with cetuximab 
One of the main mechanisms of resistance of BRAF-mutant CRC to RAF inhibitors has been 
identified as the re-activation of EGFR with bypassing signal transduction via BRAF. Combinations of 
a BRAF inhibitor, e.g.encorafenib and agents targeting EGFR, e.g. cetuximab have shown to improve 
anti-tumour efficacy in non-clinical models.   
Clinical efficacy and safety 
BRAF V600 Mutant Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma 
The safety and efficacy of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib were evaluated in a 2-part 
Phase III, randomised (1:1:1) active-controlled, open-label, multicentre study in patients with 
unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 E or K mutant melanoma (Study CMEK162B2301), as 
detected using a BRAF assay. Patients had histologically confirmed cutaneous or unknown primary 
melanoma but those with uveal or mucosal melanoma were excluded. Patients were permitted to 
receive prior adjuvant therapy and one prior line of immunotherapy for unresectable locally advanced 
or metastatic disease. Prior treatment with BRAF/ MEK inhibitors was not allowed.  
Study CMEK162B2301, part 1 
In Part 1, patients in the study were randomised to receive encorafenib 450 mg orally daily and 
binimetinib 45 mg orally twice daily (Combo 450, n = 192), encorafenib 300 mg orally daily 
(Enco 300, n = 194), or vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily (hereafter referred to as Vem, n = 191). 
Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was stratified 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage (IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a or IVM1b, vs IVM1c) and 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs 1) and prior immunotherapy 
for unresectable or metastatic disease (yes vs no).  
The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) of Combo 450 compared 
with vemurafenib as assessed by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC). PFS as assessed by 
investigators (investigator assessment) was a supportive analysis. An additional secondary endpoint 
included PFS of Combo 450 compared with Enco 300. Other secondary efficacy comparisons between 
Combo 450 and either vemurafenib or Enco 300 included overall survival (OS), objective response 
rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR) and disease control rate (DCR) as assessed by BIRC and by 
investigator assessment. 
The median age of patients was 56 years (range 20-89), 58% were male, 90% were Caucasian, and 
72% of patients had baseline ECOG performance status of 0. Most patients had metastatic disease 
(95%) and were Stage IVM1c (64%); 27% of patients had elevated baseline serum lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), and 45% of patients had at least 3 organs with tumour involvement at baseline 
and 3.5% had brain metastases. 27 patients (5%) had received prior checkpoint inhibitors (anti-
PD1/PDL1 or ipilimumab) (8 patients in Combo 450 arm (4%); 7 patients in vemurafenib arm (4%); 
12 patients in Enco 300 arm (6%) including 22 patients in the metastatic setting (6 patients in Combo 
450 arm; 5 patients in vemurafenib arm; 11 patients in Enco 300 arm) and 5 patients in the adjuvant 
setting (2 patients in Combo 450 arm; 2 patients in vemurafenib arm; 1 patient in Enco 300 arm). 
The median duration of exposure was 11.7 months in patients treated with Combo 450, 7.1 months in 
patients treated with Enco 300 and 6.2 months in patients treated with vemurafenib. The median 
relative dose intensity (RDI) for Combo 450 was 100% for encorafenib and 99.6% for binimetinib; the 
median RDI was 86.2% for Enco 300 and 94.5% for vemurafenib. 
Part 1 of Study CMEK162B2301 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the 
patients treated with Combo 450 compared with patients treated with vemurafenib. Table 6 and 
Figure 1 summarise the PFS and other efficacy results based on central review of the data by a blinded 
independent radiology committee.  
The efficacy results based on investigator assessment were consistent with the independent central 
assessment. Unstratified subgroup analyses demonstrated point estimates in favour of Combo 450, 
including LDH at baseline, ECOG performance status and AJCC stage.

An interim OS analysis of Study CMEK162B2301 Part 1, (cut-off date 07 November 2017) 
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for Combo 450 compared with 
vemurafenib (see Table 7 and Figure 2).  
A similar proportion of patients in each treatment arm received subsequent treatment with checkpoint 
inhibitors, mainly pembrolizumab, nivolumab and ipilimumab (34.4% Combo 450 arm, 36.1% 
encorafenib arm, 39.8% vemurafenib arm).

Quality of Life (QoL) (cut-off date: 19 May 2016) 
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Melanoma (FACT-M), the European Organisation for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer’s core quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the 
EuroQoL-5 Dimension-5 Level examination (EQ-5D-5L) were used to explore patient-reported 
outcomes (PRO) measures of health-related Quality of Life, functioning, melanoma symptoms, and 
treatment-related adverse reactions. A definitive 10% deterioration in FACT-M and in EORTC QLQ-
C30 was significantly delayed in patients treated with Combo 450 relative to other treatments. The 
median time to definitive 10% deterioration in the FACT-M score was not reached in the Combo 450 
arm and was 22.1 months (95% CI: 15.2, NE) in the vemurafenib arm with a HR for the difference of 
0.46 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.72). An analysis of time to definitive 10% deterioration in EORTC QLQ-C30 
score provided with similar results. 
Patients receiving Combo 450 reported no change or a slight improvement in the mean change from 
baseline EQ-5D-5L index score at all visits, whilst patients receiving vemurafenib or encorafenib 
reported decreases at all visits (with statistical significant differences). An evaluation of change over 
time in score yielded the same trend for EORTC QLQ-C30 and at all visit for FACT-M.  
Study CMEK162B2301, part 2 
Part 2 of Study CMEK162B2301 was designed to assess the contribution of binimetinib to the 
encorafenib and binimetinib combination. 
The PFS for encorafenib 300 mg orally daily used in combination with binimetinib 45 mg orally twice 
daily (Combo 300, n = 258) was compared to the PFS for Enco 300 (n = 280, including 194 patients 
from Part 1 and 86 patients from Part 2). Enrolment in Part 2 started after all Part 1 patients were 
randomised.  
Preliminary Part 2 data, at a cut-off date of 9 November 2016, demonstrated the contribution of 
binimetinib with an improved median PFS estimate of 12.9 months (95% CI: 10.1, 14.0) for 
Combo 300 compared to 9.2 months (95% CI: 7.4, 11.0) for Enco 300 (Parts 1 and 2) per independent 
central review (BIRC). Similar results were observed per Investigator assessment.  
The confirmed ORR per BIRC was 65.9% (95% CI: 59.8, 71.7) for Combo 300 and 50.4% (95% CI: 
44.3, 56.4) for Enco 300 (Parts 1 and 2). Median DOR for confirmed responses per BIRC was 
12.7 months [95% CI: 9.3, 15.1] for Combo 300 and 12.9 months [95% CI: 8.9, 15.5] for Enco 300. 
The median duration of treatment was longer for Combo 300 vs Enco 300, 52.1 weeks vs 31.5 weeks. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
In the safety analysis of pooled studies, the incidence of new QTcF prolongation >500 ms was 
0.7% (2/268) in the encorafenib 450 mg plus binimetinib group, and 2.5% (5/203) in the encorafenib 
single agent group. QTcF prolongation of >60 ms compared to pre-treatment values was observed in 
4.9% (13/268) patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, and in 3.4% (7/204) in the 
encorafenib single agent group (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
BRAF V600E Mutant metastatic colorectal cancer - Study ARRAY-818-302 
Encorafenib in combination with cetuximab was evaluated in a randomised, active-controlled, open-
label, multicentre trial (ARRAY 818-302 BEACON CRC). Eligible patients were required to have 
BRAF V600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer that had progressed after 1 or 2 prior regimens. 
Enrolled patients were eligible to receive cetuximab per locally approved label with regards to tumour 
RAS status. Prior use of RAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors or EGFR inhibitors was prohibited. 
Randomisation was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, 
prior use of irinotecan and cetuximab source.  
A total of 665 patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive encorafenib 300 mg orally daily in 
combination with cetuximab dosed as per its approved SmPC (n=220), or encorafenib 300 mg orally 
daily in combination with binimetinib 45 mg orally twice daily and cetuximab dosed as per its 
approved SmPC (n=224) or Control (irinotecan with cetuximab or irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic 
acid (FOLFIRI) with cetuximab, n= 221). Treatment continued until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The efficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR) as 
assessed by a blinded independent central review committee (BIRC), comparing encorafenib 300 mg 
in combination with cetuximab versus Control. Other efficacy measures are summarised in Table 8 
below. 
The median age of patients was 61 years (range 26-91), 47 % were male and 83% were white. 51% of 
patients had baseline ECOG performance status of 0, and 51% received prior irinotecan. 46.8% of 
patients had at least 3 organs with tumour involvement at baseline.  
The median duration of exposure was 3.2 months in patients treated with encorafenib 300 mg in 
combination with cetuximab, and 1.4 months in patients treated with irinotecan/cetuximab or 
FOLFIRI/cetuximab (Control arm).  In patients treated with the combination of encorafenib 300 mg 
and cetuximab, the median relative dose intensity (RDI) was 98% for encorafenib and 93.5% for 
cetuximab. In the control arm, the median RDI was 85.4% for cetuximab, 75.7% for irinotecan and in 
the subset of patients who received Folinic acid and 5-FU, the median RDI was 75.2% and 75% 
respectively.  
Encorafenib 300 mg in combination with cetuximab demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in OS, ORR and PFS compared to Control. Efficacy results are summarised in Table 8 
and Figures 3 and 4. 
The efficacy results based on investigator assessment were consistent with the independent central 
assessment.

Cardiac Electrophysiology 
In the safety analysis of the Phase 3 (ARRAY-818-302) safety set in colorectal indication, the 
incidence of new QTcF prolongation >500 ms was 3.2% (7/216) and QTcF prolongation of >60 ms 
compared to pre-treatment values was observed in 8.8% (19/216) of patients of the encorafenib + 
cetuximab arm (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
encorafenib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in melanoma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
encorafenib in all subsets of the paediatric population in colorectal carcinoma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
The pharmacokinetics of encorafenib were studied in healthy subjects and patients with solid tumours, 
including advanced and unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma harbouring a BRAF-V600E or 
K mutation, and in adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation. The 
pharmacokinetics of encorafenib have been shown to be approximatively dose linear after single and 
multiples doses. After repeat once-daily dosing, steady-state conditions were reached within 15 days. 
The accumulation ratio of approximately 0.5 is likely due to auto-induction of CYP3A4. The 
inter-subject variability (CV%) of AUC is ranged from 12.3% to 68.9%.  
Absorption 
After oral administration, encorafenib is rapidly absorbed with a median Tmax of 1.5 to 2 hours. 
Following a single oral dose of 100 mg [14C] encorafenib in healthy subjects, at least 86% of the 
encorafenib dose was absorbed. Administration of a single 100 mg dose of encorafenib with a 
high-fat, high-calorie meal decreased the Cmax by 36%, while the AUC was unchanged. A drug 
interaction study in healthy subjects indicated the extent of encorafenib exposure was not altered in the 
presence of a gastric pH-altering agent (rabeprazole). 
Distribution 
Encorafenib is moderately (86.1%) bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. Following a single oral 
dose of 100 mg [14C] encorafenib in healthy subjects, the mean (SD) blood-to-plasma concentration 
ratio is 0.58 (0.02) and the mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of encorafenib is 
226 L (32.7%). 
Biotransformation 
Following a single oral dose of 100 mg [14C] encorafenib in healthy subjects, metabolism was found to 
be the major clearance pathway for encorafenib (approximately 88% of the recovered radioactive 
dose). The predominant biotransformation reaction of encorafenib was N-dealkylation. Other major 
metabolic pathways involved hydroxylation, carbamate hydrolysis, indirect glucuronidation and 
glucose conjugate formation.  
Elimination 
Following a single oral dose of 100 mg [14C] encorafenib in healthy subjects, radioactivity was 
eliminated equally in both the faeces and urine (mean of 47.2%). In urine, 1.8% of the radioactivity 
was excreted as encorafenib. The mean (CV%) apparent clearance (CL/F) of encorafenib was 27.9 L/h 
(9.15%). The median (range) encorafenib terminal half-life (T1/2) was 6.32 h (3.74 to 8.09 h).

Medicinal product interactions 
No drug drug interaction was evidenced between encorafenib and cetuximab. 
Effect of CYP enzymes on encorafenib  
Encorafenib is metabolised by CYP3A4, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. In vitro, CYP3A4 was predicted to 
be the major enzyme contributing to total oxidative clearance of encorafenib in human liver 
microsomes (~83.3%), followed by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 (~16.0% and 0.71%, respectively).  
The effect of co-administering a strong CYP3A4 inducer on encorafenib exposure has not been 
studied in a dedicated trial. Repeat dose administration of encorafenib 450 mg once daily and 
binimetinib 45 mg twice daily in melanoma patients with modafinil, a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, 
decreased encorafenib steady-state AUC by 24% and Cmax by 20%, compared to encorafenib alone. 
Effect of encorafenib on CYP substrates 
In vitro experiments indicate encorafenib is a relatively potent reversible inhibitor of UGT1A1, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5, as well as a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Encorafenib 
induced CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in human primary hepatocytes.  
Repeat dose administration of encorafenib 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily in 
melanoma patients with a single dose of CYP probe substrate cocktail reduced midazolam 2 mg 
(CYP3A4 substrate) AUC by 82% and Cmax by 74 %. It decreased omeprazole 20 mg (CYP2C19 
substrate) AUC by 17 % and did not change Cmax and increased caffeine 50 mg (CYP1A2 substrate) 
AUC by 27 % and Cmax by 13 %. It decreased the ratio of losartan metabolite E3174 to losartan 
(CYP2C9 substrate) concentrations in urine by 28% and did not change the ratio of dextromethorphan 
metabolite (dextrorphan) to dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) concentrations in urine. These 
results indicate strong induction of CYP3A4, mild inhibition of CYP1A2 and no impact on 
pharmacokinetics of CYP2C19 substrates. From the urinary data, the inhibitory potency on CYP2C9 
and CYP2D6 cannot be finally concluded. No data are available for CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. 
A single dose of encorafenib 450 mg and binimetinib 45 mg reduced bupropion 75 mg (CYP2B6 
substrate) AUC and Cmax by ≤ 25%. Repeated administration of encorafenib 450 mg daily and 
binimetinib 45 mg twice daily reduced bupropion AUC and Cmax by ≤ 26 % and increased the AUC 
of the active metabolite hydroxybupropion by 49% indicating mild induction. 
For co-administration with UGT1A1 substrates that undergo gut extraction, a minor to moderate 
interaction is expected. While binimetinib is a UGT1A1 substrate, it does not undergo gut extraction 
and therefore no DDI with encorafenib is expected. Additionally, no differences in exposure have been 
observed clinically when binimetinib is co-administered with encorafenib. 
Effect of transporters on encorafenib  
Encorafenib was found to be a substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters. Inhibition of P-gp is 
unlikely to result in a clinically important increase in encorafenib concentrations as encorafenib 
exhibits high intrinsic permeability. The involvement of several uptake transporter families (OCT1, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATPB1) was investigated in vitro using relevant transporter inhibitors. 
The data suggest that hepatic uptake transporters are not involved in encorafenib distribution into 
primary human hepatocytes. 
Effect of encorafenib on transporters  
Repeated administration of encorafenib 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with a 
single dose of rosuvastatin (a OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BCRP substrate) increased rosuvastatin 
Cmax by 2.7-fold and AUC by 1.6-fold indicating a mild inhibition of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and/or 
BCRP transporters.  
In vitro, encorafenib inhibited the hepatic transporter OCT1, but is unlikely to be an effective inhibitor 
clinically. Based on in vitro studies, there is potential for encorafenib to inhibit renal transporters 
OCT2, OAT1, OAT3 at clinical concentrations. In addition, encorafenib may inhibit P-gp in the gut at 
the expected clinical concentrations.

Special populations 
Age  
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age was found to be a significant covariate on 
encorafenib volume of distribution, but with high variability. Given the small magnitude of these 
changes and high variability, these are unlikely to be clinically meaningful, and no dose adjustments 
are needed for elderly patients. 
Gender 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis gender was not found to be a significant model 
covariate on clearance or volume of distribution. As a result, no major changes in encorafenib 
exposure are expected based upon gender. 
Body weight 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, body weight was found to be a significant model 
covariate on clearance and volume of distribution. However, given the small magnitude of change in 
clearance and the high variability in the predicted volume of distribution in the model, weight is 
unlikely to have a clinically relevant influence on the exposition of encorafenib.  
Race  
There are no clinically relevant differences in encorafenib PK between Asians and non Asians . There 
are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the exposure of encorafenib in other races or 
ethnicity.  
Hepatic impairment 
Results from a dedicated clinical study indicate a 25% higher total encorafenib exposures in patients 
with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) compared with subjects with normal liver 
function. This translates into a 55% increase of the unbound encorafenib exposure.  
The pharmacokinetics of encorafenib has not been evaluated clinically in patients with moderate 
(Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. As encorafenib is primarily 
metabolised and eliminated via the liver, based on PBPK modelling, patients with moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment may have greater increases in exposure than patients with mild hepatic 
impairment. No dosing recommendation can be made in patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  
Renal impairment 
Encorafenib undergoes minimal renal elimination. No formal clinical study has been conducted to 
evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of encorafenib. 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no clear trend in encorafenib CL/F was observed in patients 
with mild (eGFR 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) or moderate (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal 
impairment compared with subjects with normal renal function (eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2). A small 
decrease in CL/F (≤5%) was predicted for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, which is 
unlikely to be clinically relevant. The pharmacokinetics of encorafenib have not been studied in 
patients with severe renal impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
In the 4-week and 13-week rat toxicity studies, clinical signs, reduced body weight reduced 
epididymides and prostate weights and microscopic findings in testes, epididymides, stomach and skin 
were noted. Partial reversibility of these findings was noted after a 4-week recovery period. 
Additionally, in the 13-week rat toxicity study, reversible clinical pathology changes were noted at 
doses ≥ 100 mg/kg/d. No NOAEL could be established for the 4-week study. The NOAEL determined 
in the 13-week study was more than 10-times human therapeutic exposures. 
In the 4-week and 13-week monkey toxicity study, isolated/sporadic episodes of emesis and diarrhoea 
as well as ophthalmic lesions were observed at slightly above human therapeutic exposures. 
Ophthalmic lesions were partially reversible and consisted of a separation or detachment in the retina 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between the outer rods and cones layer and retinal pigmented epithelium at the central macula at the 
fovea. This observation was similar to that described in humans as central serous-like 
chorioretinopathy or central serous retinopathy. 
Encorafenib was not genotoxic. 
Fertility studies were not conducted with encorafenib. In the 13-week rat toxicology studies, 
encorafenib treatment at 6 mg/kg/d (dose level more than 5 times the human exposure at the 
therapeutic dose) resulted in decreased testes and epididymis weights with tubular degeneration and 
oligospermia. In the 13-week study, partial reversibility was noted at the highest dose level 
(60 mg/kg/d).  
The embryo-foetal development study in rats indicated that encorafenib induced foetal toxicity with 
lower foetal weights and delays in skeletal development.  
The embryo-foetal development study in rabbits indicated that encorafenib induced foetal toxicity with 
lower foetal weights and transitory changes in skeletal development. Dilatation of the aortic arc was 
observed in some foetuses.  
Encorafenib was phototoxic in an in vitro 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Test. Encorafenib was not a 
sensitiser in the in vivo mouse sensitization assay. Collectively, these data indicate that encorafenib 
has a risk of phototoxic potential and minimal risk for sensitization at therapeutic doses in patients.

1.  What Braftovi is and what it is used for 
Braftovi is an anti-cancer medicine that contains the active substance encorafenib. Changes 
(mutations) in the BRAF gene can produce proteins that cause the cancer to grow. Braftovi targets 
proteins made from this changed BRAF gene. 
It is used in combination with another medicine containing binimetinib to treat adult patients with a 
type of skin cancer called melanoma when it has

As  Braftovi  is  to  be  used  in  combination  with  cetuximab  to  treat  large  intestine  cancer,  read  the 
cetuximab leaflet carefully as well as this leaflet.   
Do not take Braftovi  
- 
  if you are allergic to encorafenib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Braftovi, about all of your medical conditions, 
particularly if you have any of the following: 
- 
heart problems including alteration of the electrical activity of your heart (QT interval 
prolongation) 
bleeding problems or if you are taking medicines that may cause bleeding 
eye problems  
liver or kidney problems 
- 
- 
- 
Tell your doctor if you have had a different type of cancer than melanoma or large intestine cancer, 
as Braftovi may worsen certain other types of cancers. 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you get the following while you are taking this 
medicine: 
- 
Heart problems: Braftovi when taken with binimetinib can make your heart work less well, alter 
the electrical activity of your heart called “QT interval prolongation” or make existing heart 
problems worse. Your doctor will check that your heart is working properly before and during 
your treatment with these medicines. Talk to your doctor immediately if you have any 
symptoms of heart problems such as feeling dizzy, tired, lightheaded, if you have shortness of 
breath, if you feel like your heart is pounding, racing, beating irregularly, or if you have 
swelling in the legs. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Bleeding problems: Braftovi may cause serious bleeding problems. Talk to your doctor 
immediately if you have any symptoms of bleeding problems such as coughing up of blood, 
blood clots, vomit containing blood or that looks like “coffee grounds”, red or black stools that 
look like tar, passing blood in the urine, stomach (abdominal) pain, unusual vaginal bleeding. 
Also tell your doctor if you have headache, dizziness or weakness. 
Eye problems: Braftovi, when taken with binimetinib, can cause serious eye problems. Talk to 
your doctor immediately if you get blurred vision, loss of vision, or other vision changes (e.g. 
coloured dots in your vision), halo (seeing blurred outline around objects). Your doctor will 
examine your eyes for any problems with your sight while you are taking Braftovi. 
Skin changes: Braftovi may cause other types of skin cancer such as cutaneous squamous cell 
carcinoma. New melanomas may also occur while taking Braftovi. Your doctor will check your 
skin for any new skin cancers before treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 
months after you stop taking Braftovi. Tell your doctor immediately if you detect skin changes 
during and after treatment including: new wart, skin sore or reddish bump that bleeds or does 
not heal, or a change in size or colour of a mole. Additionally, your doctor needs to check for 
squamous cell carcinoma on your head, neck, mouth and lymph glands, and you will have CT 
scans regularly. This is a precaution in case a squamous cell carcinoma develops inside your 
body. Genital examinations (for women) and anal examinations are also recommended before 
and at the end of your treatment. 
Liver problems: Braftovi can cause abnormal blood tests related to how your liver works (raised 
levels of liver enzymes). Your doctor will run blood tests to check your liver before and during 
treatment. 
Kidney problems: Braftovi can alter your kidney activity (often abnormal blood tests, more 
rarely dehydration and vomiting). Your doctor will run blood tests to monitor your kidneys 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
before and during treatment. Drink plenty of fluids during treatment. Tell your doctor 
immediately if you vomit and become dehydrated. 
Children and adolescents 
Braftovi is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This medicine has 
not been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Braftovi 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  
Some medicines may affect how Braftovi works or make it more likely that you will have side effects. 
In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking anything in this list or any other medicines: 
- 
- 
some medicines to treat fungal infections (such as itraconazole, posaconazole, fluconazole)  
some medicines to treat bacterial infections (such as rifampicin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, 
erythromycin, penicillin) 
medicines typically used to treat epilepsy (seizures) (such as phenytoin, carbamazepine)

Braftovi with food and drink  
Do not have grapefruit juice during your treatment with Braftovi. This is because it could increase 
Braftovi side effects.  
 Pregnancy 
Braftovi is not recommended during pregnancy. It may cause harm or birth defects to an unborn baby. 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before taking this medicine. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use reliable contraception while you are 
taking Braftovi, and you must continue to use reliable contraception for at least 1 month after taking 
your last dose. Birth control medicines containing hormones (such as pills, injections, patches, 
implants and certain intrauterine devices (IUDs) that release hormones) may not work as well as 
expected while you are taking Braftovi. You should use another reliable method of birth control such 
as a barrier method (e.g. condom) so you do not become pregnant while you are taking this medicine. 
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice. 
Contact your doctor straightaway if you become pregnant while taking Braftovi.  
Breast-feeding 
Braftovi is not recommended while breast-feeding. It is not known if Braftovi passes into breast milk. 
If you are breast-feeding, or planning to breast-feed, ask your doctor for advice before taking this 
medicine.  
Fertility 
Braftovi may reduce sperm count in males. This could affect the ability to father a child. Talk to your 
doctor if this is a concern for you.  
Driving and using machines  
Braftovi can affect your ability to drive or use machines. Avoid driving or using machines if you have 
any problems with your vision, or have any other side effects that can affect your ability to drive or 
use machines (see section 4), while taking Braftovi. Talk to your doctor if you are not sure you can 
drive.

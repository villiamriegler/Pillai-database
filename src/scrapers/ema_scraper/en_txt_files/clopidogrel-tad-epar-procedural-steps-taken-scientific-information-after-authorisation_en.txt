The safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been 
demonstrated by several large clinical studies. The MAH 
has submitted an Addendum to Clinical Overview (ACO) to 
provide details of the efficacy and safety of Clopidogrel TAD 
since its approval. In the CHMP’s view the provided data do 
not change the overall knowledge about the beneficial 
effect and safety profile of clopidogrel when used in the 
approved indications.

1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (including 
septicaemia, meningitis, and bacteraemic pneumonia) and non invasive pneumococcal diseases (such 
as acute otitis media (AOM), non-bacteraemic pneumonia, sinusitis, and bronchitis) in young children. 
WHO estimates that about 16 million people, including up to 1 million children under 5 years old, die 
every year of pneumococcal disease. The highest incidence of IPD is found at the extremes of age - in 
young children <2 years of age and in elderly adults. The highest morbidity and mortality rates have 
been reported in developing countries, but the disease burden is considerable also in industrialised 
countries. Extrapolation of data on hospitalizations due to IPD from England and Wales (prior to 
introduction of Prevenar) to the European Union (EU) paediatric population <5 years of age indicate 
that there would be 6500 IPD cases and 61,000 pneumonia cases annually. Acute otitis media (AOM) is 
most prevalent in early childhood and it has been estimated that each year in the EU 2.1 million AOM 
cases occur in children <5 years of age.  
Bacteria are isolated in ~70% of children with otitis media, with S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae 
being the most commonly identified pathogens. 
Despite the availability of antibiotic therapies the mortality of pneumococcal disease remains high. 
The continuing emergence of penicillin-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococcal strains is an 
increasing global threat posing serious therapeutic challenges. Although the resistance patterns vary 
between countries, the predominance of certain serotypes (i.e. 6A, 6B, 9V, 14, 19A, 19F, and 23F) 
among the resistant organisms is shared. 
Synflorix is a second generation vaccine being developed and contains other carrier proteins (protein D, 
diphtheria toxoid [DT] and tetanus toxoid [TT]) and three more pneumococcal serotypes (1, 5 and 7F) 
in addition to the seven shared with Prevenar. The three additional serotypes are among the major IPD 
causing serotypes worldwide and represent in Europe a combined average of 13% of all IPD in children 
<5 years of age. Protein D was selected as a carrier protein, due to its potential to provide protection 
against H. influenzae infections. 
The Company proposes to update the indication section of the Synflorix Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) by increasing the upper age limit of infants and children from 2 years to 5 years. 
Accordingly the sections posology, adverse events and pharmacodynamics have been amended.  
The proposed changes are supported by two clinical studies, 10PN-PD-DIT-013 and -046. During the 
assessment, new reactogenicity results became available from study 10PN-PD-DIT-070 in Kenya (600 
children of 12-59 months of age exposed to one or two doses of Synflorix). The reactogenicity profile 
of Synflorix across age groups in study 070 is described below and supports the claim according to 
which two doses of Synflorix are safe and well tolerated in children 2-5 years of age.  
Additional supporting safety data in children above 4 years of age have also been provided during the 
assessment.

The scope of the variation includes updating the indication Section 4.1 to increase the upper age limit 
of infants and children from 2 years to 5 years and updating all relevant sections of the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC), i.e. 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 and Package Leaflet.  
Amend  the  version  number  of  the  RMP  mentioned  in  Annex  II  in  order  to  reflect  the  latest  approved 
RMP version 5.0. 
The proposed changes are supported by two main clinical studies 10PN-PD-DIT-013 and -046 and one 
supportive study 10PN-PD-DIT-070. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA 
decision (P/104/2010) for the following condition(s): 
  Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae 
  Acute otitis media caused by Haemophilus influenzae 
On the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
The PIP is not yet completed. 
1.2.  Clinical aspects 
Three clinical studies were submitted to support the proposed change of indication, 10PN-PD-DIT-013, 
10PN-PD-DIT-046 and study 10PN-PD-DIT-070. Study 10PN-PD-DIT-013 was submitted at the time of 
the initial MAA, and assessed during the approval procedure. The study 10PN-PD-DIT-013 results are 
summarised in this assessment report (AR). Study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 was submitted during the type II 
variation EMEA/H/C/973/II/14, with the purpose of adding the 2+1 primary vaccination schedule, in 
addition to the 3+1 primary schedule. The EC decision for variation II/14 was issued on 24 January 
2011. Study 10PN-PD-DIT-070 was submitted as additional supporting data that became available in 
support of the current variation. 
Clinical efficacy  
Methods 
Study 10PN-PD-DIT-013 is an open, controlled study with 4 parallel groups stratified according to 
age and with different vaccination schedules and blood sampling time points according to the age 
group, which are detailed in Table 1.  
Primary objective was to evaluate the immunogenicity of the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (10Pn-PD-DiT), when given as a catch-up immunization in children older than 7 months of age 
(three age-groups with different schedules). 
Secondary objectives included the evaluation of safety and reactogenicity of 10Pn-PD-DiT as well as 
the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine when co-administered in the 
group starting vaccination before 6 months of age.

Statistical methods and endpoints 
For  the  evaluation  of  immunogenicity  of  the  appropriate  schedule  for  catch-up  vaccination,  the 
following parameters were measured.   
One month after the administration of the primary (<6 Mo and 7-11 Mo groups) or the full (12-23 Mo 
and 24 Mo groups) vaccination course, before and one month after the booster dose (<6 Mo and 7-11 
Mo groups): 
 
Antibody  concentrations  against  pneumococcal  serotypes  1,  4,  5,  6B,  7F,  9V,  14,  18C,  19F, 
23F, 6A and 19A (22F-inhibition ELISA). 
Assessment report

 
Opsonophagocytic activity against pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 
23F, 6A and 19A. 
 
Antibody concentrations against protein D. 
Serological Methods 
All  serological  assays  used  to  evaluate  the  anti-pneumococcal  antibody  and  OPA  responses  were 
performed in the MAH’s laboratory in Rixensart, Belgium using standardised and validated procedures 
with adequate controls. 
Antibody concentrations as measured by ELISA and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) against all vaccine 
serotypes  and  vaccine  related  serotypes  6A  and  19A  were  evaluated  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-013.  The 
analysis  of  the  immunogenicity  was  performed  on  the  according  to  protocol  (ATP)  cohort  for 
immunogenicity.  
For the evaluation of the immunogenicity of the different vaccination schedules a descriptive analysis 
based on GMCs and GMTs as well as seropositivity rates was performed for each of the pneumococcal 
serotypes, protein D and the co-administered antigens. In addition, an exploratory inferential analysis 
was  performed  for  pneumococcal  serotypes,  by  comparing  the  percentages  of  subjects  reaching  an 
ELISA  antibody  concentration  of  0.2g/ml  after  catch-up  vaccination  and  after  a  3-dose  primary 
schedule in infants below 6 months of age.  
Without an immunological correlate for individual protection, the comparison of the immune response 
after catch-up vaccination in older children to those after a 3-dose primary schedule in infants below 6 
months of age is justified because the catch-up vaccination can actually be seen as primary vaccination 
in older children. The immune response after full catch-up vaccination should therefore be at least as 
good as after 3 doses in infants below 6 months of age.  
Study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 is an open, controlled, long-term follow-up study with three parallel groups 
and is an extension study of the primary and booster vaccination study 10PN-PD-DIT-002. The study 
design is detailed further in Table 2 and Figure 1.

Primary objective was to assess the immune responses following vaccination with a booster dose of the 
10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  administered  at  36-46  months  of  age  in  children  previously  vaccinated  with  the 
10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-002  according  to  either  a  3-dose  or  2-dose  primary 
vaccination within the first 6 months of age and booster vaccination at 11 months of age and to assess

the  immune  responses  following  vaccination  with  a  single  dose  of  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  in  age-
matched unprimed children. 
Secondary  objectives  included  the  assessment  of  safety,  reactogenicity  and  immunogenicity  of  the 
10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  when  given  as  a  2-dose  vaccination  course  to  unprimed  children  in  their  fourth 
year of life.

For the evaluation of immunogenicity of an appropriate schedule for catch-up vaccination, the following 
parameters  were  measured  prior  to, 7-10  days  post-dose  1  (all  groups), and  one  month  post-dose  2 
(unprimed group only):  
 
 
 
Antibody  concentrations  against  pneumococcal  serotypes  1,  4,  5,  6B,  7F,  9V,  14,  18C,  19F  and 
23F (22F-inhibition ELISA) 
Opsonophagocytic  activity  (OPA)  against  pneumococcal  serotypes  1,  4,  5,  6B,  7F,  9V,  14,  18C, 
19F and 23F.  
Antibody concentrations and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) against cross-reactive pneumococcal 
serotypes 6A and 19A.  
 
Antibody concentrations against protein D (ELISA).  
Statistical methods and endpoints 
Where appropriate, for each treatment group, at each time-point for which a blood-analysis result was 
available and for each pneumococcal serotype and for protein D: 
 
 
 
 
Antibody GMCs/GMTs with 95% CIs was tabulated. 
Seropositivity rates with exact 95% CIs were calculated. 
Percentage of subjects with pneumococcal antibody concentrations 0.2g/ml with exact 95% CIs 
was calculated for each pneumococcal serotype. 
The  distribution  of  antibody  concentrations/titres  was  displayed  using  table  and/or  reverse 
cumulative distribution curve.

 
For  each  pneumococcal  serotype,  at  each  time  point  for  which  a  blood  analysis  result  was 
available,  geometric  mean  of  ratios  of  opsonophagocytic  titres/ELISA  concentrations  were 
tabulated with their 95% CIs. 
Without an immunological correlate for individual protection, the comparison of the immune response 
after  full  catch-up  vaccination  in  older  children  to  those  after  a  3-dose  primary  schedule  in  infants 
below  6  months  of  age  is  justified  because  the  catch-up  vaccination  can  actually  be  seen  as  primary 
vaccination  in  older  children.  The  immune  response  after  catch-up  vaccination  should  therefore  be  at 
least as good as after 3 doses in infants below 6 months. Although in study 046 no direct control group 
of  infants  receiving  a  3-dose  primary  schedule  was  available,  in  the  preceding  study  002  this  group 
was  present  and  can  be  compared  with.  The  3-dose  primed  group  in  study  002  was  vaccinated 
according  to  a  3,  4,  5  month  schedule,  despite  the  protocol  defined  vaccination  schedule  of  2,  3,  4 
months. A limitation of such comparison is that the groups were vaccinated at different points in time 
as there was approximately a 2 year interval between studies.  
Results of main studies 
Immunogenicity results for study 10PN-PD-DIT-013 and study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 are presented in 
Table 3 and Table 4. In addition to the results for the unprimed group in study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 the 
immune responses for the 3-dose primary schedule in infants vaccinated in the preceding study 10PN-
PD-DIT-002 are shown.

Table 4.  Protein D in studies 10PN-PD-DIT-013, -002 and -046 
In  study  10PN-PD-DIT-013  for  the  24  Mo  group,  one  month  post-dose  I,  at  least  91.4%  of  the 
subjects  had  antibody  concentrations  0.2  g/ml,  for  each  of  the  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes 
except  for  serotypes  6B  (68.6%)  and  23F  (66.9%).  The  observed  antibody  GMCs  were  lower  for 
serotypes 1, 5, 14 and 23F and higher for serotypes 4, 18C and 19F compared to those observed for 
the same serotypes in the <6 Mo group after a 3-dose primary series (non-overlap of CIs) (Figure 2). 
The  observed  percentage  of  subjects  with  ELISA  antibody  concentrations  0.2  g/ml  was  lower  for 
serotypes 14 and 23F and higher for serotype 19F compared to the <6 Mo control group.

In  study  10PN-PD-DIT-013  for  the  24  Mo  group,  one  month  post-dose  I,  at  least  90.2%  of  the 
subjects had an OPA titre  8, for each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes except for serotypes 1 
(46.3%),  5  (56.4%)  and  6B  (64.7%).  The  observed  GMTs  were  lower  for  serotype  5  and  higher  for 
serotypes  4,  18C  and  19F  compared  to  those  observed  in  the  <6  Mo  group  after  a  3-dose  primary 
series (non-overlap of CIs) (Figure 3).

In all three catch-up immunization groups, high responses were observed for serotypes 18C and 19F. 
These  serotypes  are  conjugated  to  the  TT  and  DT  carrier  respectively,  for  which  children  were 
previously primed during early childhood. This priming could have contributed to the observed higher 
responses  for  serotypes  18C  and  19F.  However,  also  high  responses  were  observed  for  serotype  4, 
conjugated to protein D, for which children were not previously primed.

The  anti-PD  GMC  [224.8  EL.  U/ml  (95%  CI:  185.2-272.7)]  and  the  proportion  of  subjects  [76.3% 
(68.3-83.1)]  with  measurable  anti-PD  antibody  concentrations  (100  EL.U/ml)  after  one  dose  in  the 
24 Mo group were lower compared to the responses after a 3-dose primary vaccination schedule, i.e. 
a GMC of 1637.7 (1430.9-1874.3) and 100% (97.2-100) of subjects with measurable anti-PD antibody 
concentrations.  
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
From these results it can be concluded that one dose in 2-5 year olds was immunogenic but that the 
response was not as high as the response after 3 doses in infancy for some serotypes, and Protein D. 
In  study  013  higher  antibody  GMCs  and  OPA  GMTs  against  serotype  6B  were  observed  one  month 
post-dose 1 in children >2 years old at the time of vaccination, compared to those in the 2 years old 
group (no overlap of 95% CIs).  
No statistically significant differences could be observed for the other serotypes, although conclusions 
need to be drawn with caution given the small sample sizes. No consistent differences were observed 
between age groups, with for some serotypes a trend for a higher response in the above 2 years old 
subgroup  and for other serotypes a  trend for higher responses in the 2 years old group. However, in 
the OPA analysis, consistently higher GMTs were observed in the older subgroup. It is of note that OPA 
activity was tested only in one third of the subjects, i.e. approximately 50 subjects per age group. 
The  number  of  subjects  3-5  years  of  age  is  limited  to  40  subjects,  which  is  considered  very  low.  No 
firm conclusions with respect to vaccine immunogenicity and safety could be drawn.

In  study  046,  the  immune  responses  following  2-dose  catch-up  vaccination  with  the  pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine during the 4th year of life showed robust increases in ELISA antibody GMCs and OPA 
GMTs  one  month  after  the  second  dose  of  vaccine  as  compared  to  the  pre-vaccination  status.  All 
subjects  had  pneumococcal  antibody  concentrations  0.2  g/ml  for  each  vaccine  serotype  except  for 
serotypes 6B and 23F (both 93.3%). One month after the second dose of vaccine, all subjects had an 
OPA  titre  8  for  each  vaccine  serotype  except  for  serotypes  1  (89.3%),  5  (98.2%)  and  6B  (93.0%). 
The results of study 046 are summarised in Tables 3 and 4.  
For each of the pneumococcal serotypes, 2 doses resulted in higher GMCs and GMTs compared to a 3-
dose  primary  vaccination  course  in  infants  (at  2,  3  and  4  months  of  age)  in  study-002.  Also,  the 
proportion  of  subjects  reaching  an  antibody  concentration  0.2  g/ml  or  an  OPA  titre  8  was  greater 
after  2  doses  when  compared  to  3  doses  in  the  first  6  months  of  life  for  all  serotypes.  Although  this 
study  was  not  designed  to  compare  to  the  3-dose  primed  group  in  the  preceding  study-002  and 
comparison  should  be  done  with  caution,  it  is  reassuring  to  observe  that  2  doses  in  previously 
unvaccinated older children result in higher immune responses compared to the primary vaccination in 
infants.   
Of note, the OPA GMTs 1 month after the second dose in the unprimed group were lower than 7 days 
after the first dose for serotypes 1, 4, 5, 7F, 9V, remained at the same levels for serotype 18C and 23F, 
and  increased  for  serotypes  6B,  14  and  19F.  In  contrast,  the  IgG-specific  antibody  responses  as 
measured  by  ELISA  did  not  follow  the  same  kinetics.  This  observation  suggests  that  the  OPA  GMTs 
resulted  from  the  combined  opsonic  activity  of  different  immunoglobulin  classes  i.e.  IgG,  IgM  or  IgA. 
Early  kinetics  of  these  immunoglobulin  classes  upon  PCV  vaccination  are  poorly  described  in  the 
literature, especially in paediatric populations. However, ELISA results available in toddlers, adults and 
elderly  populations indicated  that  the  observed  immunoglobulin  profile  (IgG,  IgM,  IgA),  magnitude  of 
immune  responses  and  the  pneumococcal  natural  immunity  may  vary  from  serotype  to  serotype. 
Although the IgM and IgA composition of the samples was not investigated in study 046, a high level 
of IgM at 7 days post-vaccination could explain the  observed  OPA titre in absence of IgG while at 30 
days  post-vaccination  the  opsonisation  would  be  mainly  mediated  by  IgG.  The  different  OPA  kinetic 
profiles between serotypes might depend on pre-existing immunity which may have evolved differently 
over  time.  The  lack  of  knowledge  in  the  OPA  kinetics  during  the  course  of  the  vaccination  schedule 
makes it difficult to draw final conclusions on these observations.  
One  month  after  the  second  dose  of  vaccine,  the  observed  percentage  of  subjects  with  measurable 
anti-PD antibody concentrations (100 EL.U/ml) was 98.3% and anti-PD GMC was 960.4 EL.U/ml (95% 
CI  752.7-1225.5).  This  was  in  the  same  range  as  the  response  after  a  3-dose  primary  vaccination 
course in study-002, i.e. 100% with measurable anti-PD antibody concentrations and a GMC of 1223.3 
EL. U/ml (95% CI 1066.5-1403.2).  
The immune responses after 2  doses in study-046  were clearly higher than those observed after one 
dose in this age group in study-013 for each of the pneumococcal serotypes and for Protein D.  
The  results  of  study  046  indicate  that  2  doses  given  to  children  3-4  years  of  age  result  in  immune 
responses  that  are  higher  than  what  was  seen  in  children  ≤  6  months  receiving  the  3-dose  priming 
schedule.  Higher  immune  responses  are  expected  among  older  children,  as  they  are  more  likely  to 
have  some  previous  exposure  to  pneumococci.  Thus,  in  conclusion,  two  doses  should  be  given  to 
children above 2 years of age for optimal immune responses.  
Clinical safety 
Methodology of safety monitoring 
The  evaluation  of  the  safety  of  the  catch-up  vaccinations  schedules  included  in  both  study  013  and 
study  046  the  incidence  of  solicited  local  and  general  events  (during  4  days  post  vaccination),  the

incidence of unsolicited events (during 31 days post vaccination), the use of concomitant antipyretics 
or  medication  and  the  occurrence  of  SAEs  (during  the  whole  study  period).  The  intensity  of  each 
solicited  symptom  was  graded  according  to  a  standard  intensity  scale  except  for  fever  (rectal 
temperature  38C  or  axillary/oral/tympanic  temperature  37.5C;  3  fever  was  defined  as  rectal 
temperature >40.0C or axillary/oral/tympanic temperature >39.5C). Using his/her clinical judgement 
the  investigator  assessed  the  intensity  of  each  unsolicited  event  and  the  presence  or  absence  of  a 
possible  causal  relationship  to  vaccination  according  to  criteria  specified  in  the  protocol.  All  solicited 
local  symptoms  were  considered  to  be  causally  related  to  vaccination.  Large  swelling  reactions 
involving  the  entire  vaccinated  limb  are  a  well-recognised  phenomenon  following  booster  vaccination 
with many vaccines including DTPa, DT, and DTPw vaccines from all manufacturers and with Prevenar. 
The  cause  of  these  large  swelling  reactions  is  not  fully  understood,  they  are  however  generally  not 
associated  with  significant  impairment  of  function,  and  resolve  without  sequelae.  The  occurrence  of 
large swelling reactions was solicited following catch-up vaccination in both studies.  
Solicited adverse events 
Study 013 
The age distribution of the subjects vaccinated in the  24 months - 5 years of age group in catch-up 
study  10PN-PD-DIT-013  is  shown  below.  Of  the  150  subjects  vaccinated  in  this  age  group,  100 
subjects were 2 years of age and in total 50 subjects were older than 2 years. Therefore the safety and 
immunogenicity  analyses  were  done  according  to  two  subcategories;  2  year  old  subjects  (24  -  35 
months of age) (N=100) and subjects above 2 years of age ( 36 months of age) (N=50). The safety 
analysis included only the solicited AEs.

A  trend  towards  a  higher  incidence  of  local  solicited  symptoms  was  reported  in  subjects  who  started 
catch-up  immunization  at  an  older  age,  but  differences  with  the  younger  age  group  were  not 
statistically  significant.  Due  to  the  small  sample  size  of  the  dataset,  one  cannot  exclude  a  slight 
increase  of  local  symptoms  when  administering  the  vaccine  beyond  36  months  of  age.  There  was  no 
evidence  of  imbalance  between  age  groups  when  comparing  the  incidence  of  solicited  general 
symptoms. 
The solicited symptoms (local and general) following catch-up immunization, are shown in Table 5 and 
Table 6. Pain (any and grade 3) was the most commonly reported solicited local symptom at the 10Pn-
PD-DiT injection site in the 12-23 months of age and 24 months of age groups, whereas redness was 
more common in the 7-11 months of age group. High incidences of pain in the 12-23 months and 24

months  of  age  groups  (60  %  and  68.9%,  respectively,  for  any  reaction  and  11.3%  and  16.2% 
respectively,  for grade 3 reactions) were previously documented for the licensed Prevenar vaccine.  
Large  swelling reactions  were reported by four out of 300 subjects at the 10Pn-PD-DiT injection site: 
one  subject  was  in  12-23  months  group  and  three  subjects  in  24  months  group.  All  were  local 
reactions around the injection site, not involving adjacent joints. Two were associated with functional 
impairment that prevented normal activities and all resolved within 2 days.  
Although  comparison  of  reactogenicity  between  the  different  catch-up  groups  needs  to  be  done  with 
caution  given  the  difference  in  age  and  number  of  vaccine  doses,  fever  38C  was  less  commonly 
reported in the 24 months of age group compared to both the 7-11 months of age and 12-23 months 
of  age  groups.  In  all  groups,  general  symptoms  of  grade  3  intensity  were  infrequently  reported, 
following no more than 2.4% of doses. There were no cases of fever > 40.0C in any of the catch-up 
groups.

Study 046 
The  incidences  of  solicited  events  (local  and  general)  are  presented  in  Table  7  and  Table  8.  Pain  at 
injection  site  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  local  adverse  event  (72.6%  dose  1,  51.6% 
dose  2  and  62.1%,  overall/dose).  The  overall/dose  incidence  of  grade  3  solicited  local  symptoms 
ranged  from  4.8%  to  13.7%  in  the  unprimed  group.  Large  swelling  reaction  (>  50  mm)  following 
vaccination was reported by 1 subject after the first dose. The lesion had a diameter of 60 mm and had 
resolved after 1 day.  
Irritability  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  adverse  event.  None  of  the  subjects 
reported fever> 40C or any other grade 3 solicited general adverse events.  
There was no increase in incidence of events with consecutive doses.

Unsolicited adverse events 
Study 013 
The overall/dose incidence of at least one unsolicited AE was 56.6% in the 7-11 months of age group 
(two doses), 43.4% in the 7-11 months of age group (third dose), 47.8% in the 12-23 months of age 
group  and  36.0%  in  the    24  months  of  age  group  (Table  9).  The  most  common  unsolicited  adverse 
event  considered  to  be  causally  related  to  vaccination  was injection  site induration  in  the  two  groups 
receiving two 10Pn-PD-DiT doses. In the 24 months of age group, the most common related adverse 
event was headache (2.0%).

The mean age in the unprimed group was 40.3 months (38 months in the other two groups) and the 
range was 36-45 months.  
The overall/dose incidence of at least one unsolicited AE was 40.3%, and 8.1% of the doses were 
followed by at least one unsolicited event that was considered to be causally related to vaccination. 
The most common unsolicited adverse events considered to be causally related to vaccination were 
nausea, vomiting, injection site hematoma, pyrexia and rhinitis (all reported after 1.6% of the doses).

Study 013 
In  study  10PN-PD-DIT-013,  6  subjects  in  the  7-11  months  of  age  group,  2  subjects  in  the  12-23 
months  of  age  group  and  none  in  the  24  months  of  age  group  reported  at  least  one SAE  (data  lock 
point  15  June  2008).  None  of  the  subjects  reported  a  causally  related  SAE  or  an  SAE  with  a  fatal 
outcome.  
Study 046 
One  subject  in  the  unprimed  group  reported  an  SAE  (bronchitis) during  the  course  of  the study.  This 
SAE  was  not  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to  vaccination  and  the  subject 
recovered uneventfully.  
Following  assessment  of  the  submitted  documentation,  some  concerns  were  raised.  The  major 
objection concerned the limited data in children above 4 years of age.

Study 10PN-PD-DIT-070 is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted in Kenya. This 
study is a GSK-supported conducted at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). The main 
objectives of the study are to determine the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of 1 or 2 doses of 
Synflorix in children aged 12-59 months and to determine the effect of vaccination on the carriage 
prevalence of Synflorix types. A total of 600 children aged 12-59 months were enrolled in three study 
groups as follows: 
Vaccination schedule 
This study provided safety data from 600 children aged 12-59 months exposed to two doses of 
Synflorix. 
The occurrence of solicited local and general symptoms reported within 3 days after vaccination has 
been calculated across age groups (12-23 months; 24-35 months; 36-47 months; 48-59 months). 
Table 11 and Table 12 summarise the reactogenicity data following the first dose of Synflorix (pooled 
Groups A+B: N ~100 per age group) or control vaccine Havrix (Group C: N ~50 per age group), 
respectively. The occurrences of solicited symptoms were comparable between Synflorix and the 
control vaccine in all age groups. Most importantly, no increase of occurrence of solicited symptoms 
was observed in children aged 48 months and above as compared to younger children for either 
Synflorix or control vaccine. There were no reports of grade 3 solicited local and general symptoms 
across all age groups, except grade 3 drowsiness which was documented in one child after the first 
dose of Synflorix. 
The occurrences of solicited symptoms across all age groups and overall after a second dose of 
Synflorix (Group A: N ~ 50) or after control vaccine Infanrix at Day 60 (pooled Groups B+C: N ~100) 
are shown in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively. Similar to the reporting of solicited symptoms observed 
after the first dose of Synflorix, there was no trend towards higher reactogenicity with increasing age 
after the second dose of Synflorix. The occurrences of solicited symptoms following a second dose of 
Synflorix and following the control vaccine Infanrix at day 60 were comparable.  
The results from Table 11 and Table 13 show that the reactogenicity profile for solicited local and 
general symptoms following one dose of Synflorix was generally higher than that following the second 
dose of Synflorix across all age groups. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were documented in 6 of 400 
children (1.5%) in the groups receiving at least one dose of Synflorix (groups A+B) and 1 of 200 
children (0.5%) in the control group C. All SAEs were considered to be unrelated to vaccination. 
It is acknowledged that the safety profile of Synflorix in European population may differ from that 
obtained in the Kenyan population due to ethnic factors, clinical settings or health conditions in Africa. 
However, the data are reassuring in that the reactogenicity profile for the subjects in the 48-59 
months age group was not higher than in the other age groups, either following one dose or two doses 
of Synflorix. In addition, the reactogenicity profile in the 48-59 months age group following two doses

of Synflorix tended to be lower than that following one dose of Synflorix. Finally the reporting of 
solicited local and general symptoms following vaccination with Synflorix was similar to that following 
the control vaccines (Havrix and Infanrix).

Supportive data from studies conducted in Europe 
The safety and reactogenicity data of a single dose of Synflorix in children 24-71 months of age in 
study 10PN-PD-DIT-013 and two doses in children 36-45 months of age in study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 
was previously submitted and assessed. Synflorix was well tolerated in both studies. There was no 
increase of local and general symptoms with increasing age, except for injection site pain of any 
severity in study 013, which was higher in the ≥24 months age group (68.9%) than in the 12-23 
months and 7-11 months age groups (60.6% and 44.1%, respectively).

A new analysis of study 013 has been performed to determine if this trend towards higher injection site 
pain with age is observed in the 48-59 months age group and the 60-71 months age group. The 
results indicated that the occurrences of local adverse events of any severity and grade 3 by age group 
are generally similar in the 36-47 months, 48-59 months and 60-71 months age groups. 
With regards to the solicited general symptoms, higher incidences were not observed in children in of 
48-59 months of age and 60-71 months of age in study 013 with the exception of fever of any severity 
in the 60-71 months of age group (22%). No grade 3 cases of fever, drowsiness, irritability and loss of 
appetite were reported in children of 48-59 months of age and 60-71 months of age. 
In addition to this new analysis, the solicited local and general symptoms after one dose of Synflorix in 
children of 46-48 months of age from study 10PN-PD-DIT-061 are also presented. Study 10PN-PD-
DIT-061 is a phase III, open, multicentre, extension study in Germany to assess the immune response 
following administration of an additional dose of Synflorix or Prevenar at approximately 4 years of age 
in children previously vaccinated with three primary doses of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 
study 10PNPD- DIT-003 and a booster dose of 23-valent pneumococcal plain polysaccharide vaccine in 
study 10PN-PD-DIT-008 BST: 003. In total, 52 subjects were enrolled in study 061, of which 27 
subjects received one dose of Synflorix and 25 subjects received one dose of Prevenar. The 
percentages of subjects reporting any adverse event (solicited and unsolicited, local and general) 
within the 31-day post-additional dose period were 80.8% in the Synflorix group and 72.0% in the 
Prevenar group. The percentages of subjects reporting at least one unsolicited adverse event in the 
31-day post-additional dose period were 22.2% in the Synflorix group and 32.0% in the Prevenar 
group. No grade 3 unsolicited adverse events were reported within the 31-day post-additional dose 
period. No serious adverse events were reported and none of the subjects was withdrawn due to an 
adverse event. 
In study 061, the reporting of solicited local and general symptoms (Table 15 and Table 16 
respectively) were generally similar to the reporting in study 013 for the similar age groups (i.e. 36-47 
months of age and 48-59 months of age) except for higher fever of any severity in study 061 (26.9% 
of subjects versus 0% and 4.3% in the 36-47 months of age and 48-59 months of age groups in study 
013 respectively).

Table 16.  Study 061: Incidence of solicited general symptoms reported during the 4-day (Days 0-3)

As noted previously, there was no increase of occurrence of solicited local and general symptoms with 
consecutive vaccine doses in study 046. 
Worldwide marketing experience 
There  were  41  spontaneous  reports  when  Synflorix  was  used  in  subjects  older  than  2  years  of  age 
(data  lock  point  10  June  2010).  Out  of  the  41  reports,  there  were  21  cases  concerning  children 
between 2 and 6 years of age. The Company is closely monitoring off-label use in PSURs and so far did 
not observe any particular safety signal linked to the use of Synflorix in subjects older than 2 years. 
Since launch up to 10 December 2010, 379 spontaneous cases were reported after Synflorix 
vaccination. Of these 379 cases, 28 occurred in subjects who were aged from 2 to 5 years old at the 
time they received Synflorix vaccination. Data presented within these 28 cases did not highlight any 
particular safety concern regarding cases reported in children aged from 2 to 5 years old. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety and reactogenicity of a single dose of Synflorix has been documented in 206 children 36 to 
48 months of age (studies 013, 046, 061 and 070), 124 children of 48 to 59 months of age (studies 
013 and 070) and 9 subjects of 60 to 71 months of age (study 013). Reporting of adverse events 
following a second dose of Synflorix was studied in 62 subjects of 36 to 45 months of age in study 046 
and 52 children of 48 to 59 months of age in study 070. It should be noted that the number of children 
of 3 to 4 years of age (36 months to 59 months) in these studies are similar to that the number of 
children found in for PCV13 indication in children 2-5 years of age (N=152 in PCV13 study 3002) (EPAR, 
2009).

A further analysis by age of the data from study 013 in children of 24 to 71 months of age showed that 
local and general solicited symptoms were similar in children of 36 to 47 months of age, 48-59 months 
of age and 60 to 71 months of age, except for fever of any severity in the 61 to 71 months of age 
group. Study 061 provided additional data in children of 46 to 48 months of age with reporting of local 
and general solicited symptoms generally similar to the reporting in study 013 for the age groups 36 to 
47 months of age and 48 to 59 months of age. 
The recently available data from study 070 in Kenya indicate that Synflorix was well tolerated in 
children of 12 to 59 months of age and are of special interest as they provide safety and reactogenicity 
data for children of 48 to 59 months of age following one or two doses of Synflorix. The reporting of 
solicited symptoms for oldest age group in the study (48 to 59 months of age) was similar to the other 
age groups that received Synflorix and also similar to that in children of 48 to 59 months of age 
receiving control vaccine Havrix (except for higher number of children reporting fever in the Synflorix 
group) or control vaccine Infanrix. 
Following  the  first  round  of  assessment,  some  concerns  were  raised.  The  major  objection  concerned 
the  limited  data  in  children  above  4  years  of  age.  This  concern  was  satisfactorily  resolved  upon  the 
assessment of additional supporting safety data. 
Furthermore, a new analysis of safety data from previous studies conducted in Europe provided 
additional evidence that there are no trends towards higher reactogenicity in children above 48 months of 
age receiving one or two doses of Synflorix. 
In conclusion, one dose of Synflorix has been shown to be well tolerated in children of 2 up to 5 years 
of age in studies 013 and 061 with similar reporting of solicited symptoms in the older children of 3 up 
to 5 years of age and, in study 046, there was no increase in reporting of solicited symptoms following 
a second dose of Synflorix in children of 3 years of age. A review of the available post-marketing 
surveillance safety data did not reveal any safety concerns in children of 2 to 5 years of age. The data 
from Kenya can support the conclusions reached for the safety and tolerability of two doses of 
Synflorix when administered to children from 2 up to 5 years of age (i.e. up to 59 months of age). 
The evidence presented supports the safety and tolerability of two doses of Synflorix in children of 2 up 
to 5 years of age and supports the changes to the SmPC to increase the upper age limit to 5 years of 
age and the inclusion of immunogenicity data and new safety data. 
Overall Conclusion and Benefit-Risk assessment 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
Two doses of Synflorix were shown to elicit immune responses in children aged 3-4 years old in study 
046, which are at least of the same magnitude as the responses to the approved 3+1 and 2+1 primary 
vaccination schedule in infants.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There are limited data in children 48-60 months of age, and there are no data on children in this age 
group receiving two doses. The immune responses after two doses in children 3-4 years of age were 
lower than those seen in children of the same age who had received a priming course of 3+1 or 2+1 
doses and a booster dose at 36-46 months of age. The implication of this lower response on long-term 
immunity is currently unknown. The lack of immunogenicity data following 2 doses in children >4 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/736592/2011  
Page 24/27
 
 
 
 
<6 years of age are of some concern, but it is likely that immune responses in 2-4 year old children 
are also representative of children 4-5 years of age.  
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The reactogenicity is generally similar to what has been shown previously in younger children. 
However, the frequency of pain at the injection site was shown to increase with increasing age in study 
013.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There are no data on children 48-60 years of age receiving two doses. Considering the observed 
increased frequency of pain at the injection site in study 013, there is a need for more data on the 
risks. The MAH provided additional analysis from study 013 for age groups 24-35 months, 36-47 
months, 48-59 months and 60-71 months, which do not indicate a clear increase in reactogenicity with 
increasing age, although the age segments are small, e.g. the 60-71 month group only includes 9 
individuals. In addition, a Kenyan study in children 12-59 months of age do not support increased 
reactogenicity with increasing age. However, data in the oldest children, i.e. 48-60 months of age 
receiving two doses are scarce, and the MAH is requested to closely monitor adverse reactions in 
children 2-5 years and report in upcoming PSURs. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The incidence of pneumococcal infection is greatest among children below 5 years of age, and 
therefore there is a need to vaccinate this age group. The lack of immunogenicity data following 2 
doses in children older than 4 years of age is a deficiency, but it is likely that the results from the 
younger children can be extrapolated to the older children. The lack of safety data in the initial dossier 
was identified by CHMP as a major objection, mainly due to the observed increase in frequency of 
injection site pain with increasing age. However, in response to the major objection raised, the MAH 
has presented additional data that do not support an overall increase in reactogenicity by increasing 
age.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The incidence of disease caused by S. pneumoniae is highest in children up to 5 years of age, thus 
there is a need to vaccinate children up to 5 years of age. The results of study 013 indicated that a 
single dose given to children over 2 years of age did not result in sufficient immune responses. In 
study 046, it was shown that 2 doses given to children 3-4 years of age resulted in immune responses 
that were at least comparable to the responses seen in younger children following primary 
immunisation. It is considered that the immunogenicity data from the 3-4 year old children can be 
extrapolated to children up to 5 years of age.  
There was an increase in the incidence of pain at the injection site with increasing age in study 013, 
but no increase in systemic reactions. These data were not supported by a Kenyan study 070, which 
did not support increased reactogenicity with increasing age and by further analysis of the 013 data by 
age group. Thus, there is no specific safety concern with increasing age, and the safety data from 
younger children can be extrapolated to children up to 5 years of age.

Thus, the benefit of vaccinating children up to 5 years of age is considered to outweigh the risks of 
vaccination.  
As the overall safety database in children 2-5 years of age is very limited, the CHMP recommended 
performing an active safety surveillance, and closely monitoring vaccine safety in this age group. All 
serious listed and unlisted adverse events should be continuously reported and accordingly be 
presented cumulatively in future PSURs. 
Changes to the Product Information 
The  changes  to  the  Product  Information  include  updating  the  indication  Section  4.1  to  increase  the 
upper age limit of infants and children from 2 years to 5 years and updating all relevant sections of the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), i.e. 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 and Package Leaflet.  
Amend  the  version  number  of  the  RMP  mentioned  in  Annex  II  in  order  to  reflect  the  latest  approved 
RMP version 5.0. 
The CHMP agreed with the changes to the Product Information. The SmPC has been modified as 
indicated in Annex 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers that the benefit risk 
balance of Synflorix for active immunisation against invasive disease and acute otitis media caused by 
Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants in children 2-5 years is considered acceptable. The MAH took the 
opportunity to amend the version number of the RMP mentioned in Annex II in order to reflect the 
latest approved RMP version 5.0.  
The CHMP recommends performing an active safety surveillance and closely monitoring vaccine safety 
in  this  age  group.  All  serious  listed  and  unlisted  adverse  events  should  be  continuously  reported  and 
accordingly be presented cumulatively in future PSURs. 
The CHMP is of the opinion that study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 EXT: 002, which is contained in the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan and has been completed after 26 January 2007, is considered significant. 
2.  Conclusion 
On 23 June 2011 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be approvable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet: 
Variation requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate the Package Leaflet.

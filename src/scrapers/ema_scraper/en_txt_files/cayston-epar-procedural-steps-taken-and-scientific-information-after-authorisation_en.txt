1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC, Annex 
In a Phase 2 open-label study (GS-US-205-0162), 105

Positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)].  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update

Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to

< 6 years; 56 patients aged 6 to < 18 years) with CF and 
documented initial/new onset P. aeruginosa infection 
received Cayston 3 times a day for 28 days.  
Of the 101 patients, all having a positive cultures for P. 
aeruginosa within 30 days of study enrolment, of whom 56 
(55.4%) were free of P. aeruginosa at baseline who 
completed a 28-day treatment course 89.1% (n= 90) were 
free of P. aeruginosa at the end of treatment (Day 28) and 
75.2% (n=76) were free of P. aeruginosa 1 month after the 
end of treatment (Day 56). A total of 79 patients  who 
completed a 28-day treatment course and who did not 
receive an additional antipseudomonal antibiotic during the 
treatment period were evaluable 6 months after the end of 
treatment; of these, 58.2% (n=46) remained free of P.

aeruginosa throughout this time period.   
These data provide some evidence of possible benefit of 
early treatment with a single 28-days course of aztreonam. 
However, data are too limited for final conclusions, 
particularly with regards to dose recommendations and 
post-treatment management. 
The benefit/risk for Cayston 75 mg in the currently 
approved indication “the suppressive therapy of chronic 
pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 6 years and older.”

To assess the results of study GS-US-205-0160, an 
23/01/2014 
n/a 
The MAH submitted a paediatric safety study (Study GS-
Open-Label phase 3 trial, to evaluate the safety of 
aztreonam 75 mg powder and solvent for nebuliser 
solution/aztreonam for inhalation solution (AZLI) in 
children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in the lower airways. 
The requested variation proposes no amendments to 
the Product Information. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
US-205-0160, open-label, single-arm), listed in the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan (Decision - P/0124/2013). The 
study was not powered for efficacy. The primary endpoint 
was the percentage of patients who discontinued study 
drug due to safety or tolerability reasons by day 168. 
In total 61 paediatric patients (n=2 aged <2 years, n=7 
aged 2 to <6 years, n=52 aged 6 to 12 years) were 
enrolled. All patients in this study received 3 intermittent 
28-day courses of aztreonam lysine (AZLI, Cayston) 75 mg 
TID (28 days on/28 days off) administered via the PARI 
Investigational eFlow Nebulizer System. AZLI was 
administered via best method for each patient using 
SmartMask Baby, SmartMask Kids, or the standard 
nebulizer mouthpiece.  
The MAH submitted the secondary efficacy results of 52 
paediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years. No conclusion could 
be drawn from the efficacy results. However, these are in 
line with the results previously reported in paediatric (and 
adult) patients. 
The safety data from this study are consistent with results 
from the previous phase 2/3 studies and further support 
the use of AZLI in children with CF and chronic PA infection 
over repeated courses of treatment. Cough, pyrexia and 
hemoptysis were the most common reported AEs similar to 
already reported in the previous studies. Study-drug 
induced bronchospasm was reported in 2 paediatric 
patients.  These AEs are already addressed in SmPC 
Page 14/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sections 4.4 and 4.8. The CHMP is of the opinion that based 
on the newly submitted safety data, no changes to the 
SmPC are presently warranted.   
The benefit/risk for Cayston 75 mg remains positive in the 
currently approved indication.

dyspnea; as a consequence, the Cayston Company Core 
Data Sheet (CCDS) has been updated to Version 3, dated 
24 October 2011. 
In placebo-controlled clinical trials, dyspnoea and arthralgia 
were adverse events that were reported in fewer patients 
treated with Cayston relative to placebo (10.2% Cayston

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
vs. 11.3% placebo) and (2.8% Cayston vs. 3.8% placebo) 
respectively. In contrast, joint swelling was an undesirable 
effect that was reported in a larger percentage of patients 
treated with Cayston relative to placebo (0.5% Cayston vs. 
0% placebo). Dyspnoea is a symptom of pulmonary 
exacerbation, which can occur in patients with cystic 
fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Extensive antibiotic therapy use 
in patients with CF can result in allergic responses with 
musculoskeletal manifestations, including arthralgia and 
joint swelling. 
Based on these frequencies, the MAH proposes the 
amendments to the section 4.8.  
In order to be in line with the Company Core Data Sheet 
(CCDS), the MAH also proposes to modify the 
Pharmacokinetic Properties of the label.  Following 
assessment of proposed changes, a statement is provided 
on “metabolism” and more information is added to the 
existing elimination data.

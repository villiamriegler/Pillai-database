The CHMP, having reviewed the evidence of compliance 
with the specific obligations and the impact of the data 
submitted by the MAH on the benefit/risk profile of the 
medicinal product, concluded that marketing authorisation 
of Strensiq should be maintained. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of sections 4.4, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.2 of the SmPC 
with the results of the integrated safety analysis of 
pooled asfotase alfa clinical studies, and section 5.1 
of the SmPC with the final results of study ENB-002-
08/ENB-003-08 (an open-label, non-randomised, 
non-controlled study) and study ENB-010-10  (a 
controlled, open label study to evaluate the efficacy, 
safety, and PK of asfotase alfa in infants and children 
with perinatal/infantile (n=89), juvenile-onset (n = 22), 
adult onset (n = 1) HPP (age at enrolment from 1 day to 
66.5 years) treated with asfotase alfa, with a treatment 
duration range from 1 day to 391.9 weeks [7.5 years]).  
A few case reports of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity 
reaction have been received in the clinical trial setting.  
Localized lipodystrophy, including lipoatrophy and 
lipohypertrophy, has been reported at injection sites after 
several months in patients treated with Strensiq in clinical

≤ 5 years of age with hypophosphatasia (HPP)). The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In

editorial changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet.

trials. The majority of patients who experienced an 
injection site reaction had the first occurrence within the 
first 12 weeks of treatment with asfotase alfa, and some 
patients continued to experience injection site reactions 
until 1 or more years after initiating asfotase alfa dosing. 
These have been generally assessed as non-serious, mild to 
moderate in severity and self-limiting. 
The ADRs Hypocalcaemia and Nephrolithiasis were 
observed with a frequency of common and have been 
added to SmPC section 4.8.  
Study ENB-010-10 was a controlled open-label study in 69 
patients, aged 1 day to 72 months, with perinatal/infantile-
onset HPP. The mean age at sign/symptom onset was 1.49 
months. Patients received Strensiq at 6 mg/kg per week for 
the first 4 weeks. All patients began the study on a dose of 
asfotase alfa 6 mg/kg per week. The dose of asfotase alfa 
was increased for 11 patients during the study. Of these 11 
patients, 9 patients had their doses increased specifically to 
improve clinical response. Thirty-eight patients were 
treated for at least 2 years (24 months) and 6 patients 
have been treated for at least 5 years (60 months).  
At Week 48, 50/69 patients (72.5%) in the full analysis set 
achieved Radiographic Global Impression of Change scores 
≥ 2, and were considered responders. Improvements in 
median RGI-C were maintained over the course of 
treatment, which ranged from 0.9 to 302.3 weeks, even if 
fewer patients were followed after Week 96 (a total of 29 
patients were followed after Week 96 and ≤8  patients after 
Week 192). 
Height, weight and head circumference were plotted on 
growth charts (series of percentile curves that illustrate 
Page 9/20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
distribution) available from the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC), USA. A total of 24/69 (35%) 
patients displayed apparent catch-up height-gain and 
32/69 (46%) patients displayed apparent catch-up weight-
gain, as shown by movement over time to a higher 
percentile on CDC growth charts. 40/69 patients and 32/69 
patients did not show apparent catch-up gain in height and 
in weight, respectively. 4 patients did not have enough 
data to permit judgement and 1 patient could not be 
determined with certainty. 
Please refer to the updated section 5.1 of the SmPC for the 
final results of study ENB-002-08/ENB-003-08. 
SmPC section 5.2 has been updated to reflect the fact that 
in adult patients with pediatric-onset HPP, the 
pharmacokinetics of asfotase alfa at doses of 0.5, 2 and 3 
mg/kg administered three times per week was consistent 
with those observed in pediatric patients with pediatric-
onset HPP, and thus supported the approved dose of 6 
mg/kg per week in treating adult patients with pediatric-
onset HPP.

Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) is used as the detection reagent 
the information on Asfotase alfa interaction with the 
Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), used as the detection 
reagent in many routine laboratory assays, which 
may leading to abnormal values reports. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
in many routine laboratory assays. If asfotase alfa is 
present in clinical laboratory samples, aberrant values 
could be reported. 
The treating physician should inform the testing lab that 
the patient is treated with medication affecting the ALP 
levels. Alternative assays (i.e. not utilizing an ALP-
conjugated reporter system) may be considered in patients 
treated with Strensiq.

The CHMP, having reviewed the evidence of compliance 
with the specific obligations and the impact of the data 
submitted by the MAH on the benefit/risk profile of the 
medicinal product, concluded that Marketing Authorisation 
of Strensiq should be maintained.

anaphylaxis. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. The MAH took the opportunity to include 
the Pharmacotherapeutic group in section 5.1.

has been updated to include that: “severe or life-
threatening hypersensitivity to the active substance or to 
any of the excipients is a contraindication to re-challenge, if 
hypersensitivity is not controllable”. 
In addition, the existing warning on hypersensitivity has 
been expanded to include that: “Hypersensitivity reactions 
including signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis 
have been reported in patients treated with asfotase alfa 
(see section 4.8). These symptoms included difficulty

breathing, choking sensation, nausea, periorbital edema, 
and dizziness. The reactions have occurred within minutes 
after subcutaneous administration of Strensiq and can 
occur in patients on treatment for more than one year. 
Other hypersensitivity reactions included vomiting, fever, 
headache, flushing, irritability, chills, skin erythema, rash, 
pruritus, and oral hypaesthesia. (…) Consider the risks and 
benefits of re-administering Strensiq to individual patients 
following a severe reaction, taking other factors into 
account that may contribute to the risk of a hypersensitivity 
reaction, such as concurrent infection and/ or use of 
antibiotics. If the decision is made to re-administer the 
product, the re-challenge should be made under medical 
supervision and consideration may be given to use 
appropriate pre-medication.   Patients should be monitored 
for recurrence of signs and symptoms of a severe 
hypersensitivity reaction. 
The need for supervision for subsequent administrations 
and need for emergency treatment for home care should be 
at the discretion of the treating physician. 
Severe or potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity is a 
contraindication to re-challenge, if hypersensitivity is not 
controllable (see section 4.3)” 
In addition, “Anaphylactoid reactions” has been included in 
the product information as a common adverse reaction.

SmPC and PL 
In this submission the MAH proposed a modified schedule 
order to add a 4-dose regimen posology for patients 
with renal insufficiency including those undergoing 
haemodialysis and to update safety and 
pharmacodynamic information based on final results 
from study HBV-24 “An Open-label, Single Arm 
Study, Evaluating the Immunogenicity and Safety of 
HEPLISAV-B in Adults With End-Stage Renal Disease 
Undergoing Hemodialysis”. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to make some editorial updates to the PI 
mainly to align the wording with the QRD guidance 
and templates. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
of HEPLISAV B for individuals with CKD (chronic kidney 
disease) who are initiating or receiving HD (haemodialysis).  
The company submitted the final results from study HBV-
24 “An Open-label, Single Arm Study, Evaluating the 
Immunogenicity and Safety of HEPLISAV-B in Adults With 
End-Stage Renal Disease Undergoing Hemodialysis”. In this 
trial, four doses of HEPLISAV B were given to CKD patients 
one month apart: the proposed schedule for HD was 4 
doses of the approved dose level (20 mcg rHBsAg/3000 
mcg CpG 1018 [20/3000]), one IM injection given at 0, 1, 
2, and 4 months. Anti-HBs were measured at baseline and 
then at Weeks 4, 8, 16, and 20. Seroprotection was defined 
as anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL.   
The primary immunogenicity objective was to evaluate the 
immunogenicity induced by HEPLISAV B at Week 20 as 
measured by the seroprotection rate (SPR). In the 75 
subjects in the PP population, the SPR at each visit through 
Week 20 was 20.3% after the first vaccine dose at Week 4, 
56.8% after the second vaccine dose at Week 8, 78.7% 
after the third vaccine dose at Week 16, and 89.3% at 
Week 20 (with 95% confidence interval [CI]: 80.1%, 
95.3%). The CHMP noted that high seroprotection rate 
after four doses of HEPLISAV B in this patient group, as 
well as the increase of responses after each subsequent 
dose, justifying the proposed posology. As regards to 
safety, the CHMP is of the view that the safety results did 
not cause further concern; the safety profile of four doses

of HEPLISAV B in this population was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP.  
Based on the above, updates of sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of 
the SmPC were performed accordingly to add the above-
mentioned 4-dose regimen posology for patients with renal 
insufficiency including those undergoing HD whilst updating 
safety and pharmacodynamic information. The Package 
Leaflet was updated consequently. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to make some editorial updates to the 
PI mainly to align the wording with the QRD guidance and 
templates.

Based on clinical trial data, the addition of “injection site 
‘injection site pruritus’ to the list of adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) with frequency ‘uncommon’, based 
on post-marketing surveillance. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to introduce minor changes to 
the PI.

pruritus” to the list of adverse drug reactions in section 4.8. 
of the SmPC (with a frequency “uncommon”) was 
performed during this procedure. In addition, “fever” was 
removed under section 4.8 - ”undesirable effects” in the 
SmPC, under the section “summary of the safety profile” 
but not from the tabulated list of adverse reactions, based 
on the fact that fever occurred in considerably lower 
frequencies than the other adverse reactions (such as 
injection site pain, headache, malaise, fatigue). In light of 
the above, the Product Information was amended 
accordingly.

Potentially immune-mediated disorders is a known 
26: Post-Marketing Observational Surveillance Study 
to Evaluate the Incidence of New-Onset Immune-
mediated Diseases, Herpes Zoster, and Anaphylaxis, 
listed as a category 3 post-authorisation safety study 
(PASS) in the RMP. 
This is a post-marketing observational surveillance 
study comparing the incidence of new-onset 
immune-mediated diseases, herpes zoster, and 
anaphylaxis in recipients of HEPLISAV B with 
recipients of another hepatitis B vaccine. 
The RMP version 1.3 has also been submitted. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
theoretical risk that requires no further characterisation and 
is followed up via routine pharmacovigilance. There is no 
known causality mechanism. The final study results of 
study HBV-26 (category 3 PASS study in the RMP) confirm 
that there is a similar safety profile for these disorders as 
for the comparator product. Based on the evidence in this 
study, the important potential risk ‘Potentially immune-
mediated disorders (including inflammatory disorders)’ was 
removed from the RMP as a safety concern. 
In conclusion, this observational study did not identify 
safety concerns for HEPLISAV-B with respect to herpes 
zoster, anaphylaxis, or selected immune-mediated 
diseases. This study did not identify a potential safety 
signal that requires further investigation.

listed as a category 3 PASS study in the RMP. This is 
a post-marketing observational surveillance study 
comparing the occurrence of Acute Myocardial 
Infarction (AMI) in recipients of HEPLISAV-B with

consequence, the RMP version 1.2 has also been 
submitted, in which the MAH proposed the removal 
of AMI as an important potential risk from the list of 
safety concerns.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Requested Type II Group of variations 
Pursuant  to  Article  7.2.(b)  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No 1234/2008,  Merck  Serono  Europe  Ltd 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 15 June 2011 an application for a group of variations. 
This application concerns the following medicinal product: 
Medicinal product: 
International non-proprietary or 
Presentations: 
common name: 
Rebif 
interferon beta-1a 
See Annex A 
The following variations were requested in the group: 
Variations requested 
Type 
C.I.6 a) 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
B.II.e.5 a) 2 
Change in pack size of the finished product – Change in 
IB 
the number of units (e.g. tablets, ampoules, etc.) in a 
pack – Change outside the range of the currently approved 
pack sizes 
The  MAH  proposed  the  update  of  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics  (SmPC)  and  sections  1  and  3  of  the  Package  Leaflet  to  include  information  on  a  new 
indication,  i.e.  treatment  of  patients  with  a  single  demyelinating  event  with  an  active  inflammatory 
process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of 
developing relapsing multiple sclerosis. These updates affect the PI of the 44 mcg presentations (pre-
filled  syringe,  pre-filled  pen  and  cartridges)  and  the  PI  of  the  initiation  pack  presentations  (pre-filled 
syringe, pre-filled pen and cartridges).  In addition, minor editorial changes were implemented across 
the SmPC and the Package leaflet, and the DDPS version number was removed from Annex II. 
At the same time, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.2 and 6.5 of the SmPC for the pre-filled 
syringe (PFS) and pre-filled pen (PFP) initiation packs in order to add additional pack sizes of 2x22 mcg 
PFS  +  2x8.8  mcg  PFS  and    2x22  mcg  PFP  +  2x8.8  mcg  PFP.  Labelling  and  Package  Leaflet  were 
proposed to be updated accordingly. 
The  requested  group  of  variations  proposed  amendments  to  the  SmPC,  Annex  II,  Labelling  and 
Package Leaflet.

3.  Background information on the procedure 
3.1.  Submission of the dossier 
With  this  application  the  MAH  proposed  to  add  the  following  indication  “Rebif  is  indicated  for  the 
treatment of a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses 
have  been  excluded,  and  if  they  are  determined  to  be  at  high  risk  of  developing  relapsing  multiple 
sclerosis”, with consequential changes to sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC. This type II variation 
was initially grouped with a type IB variation to introduce two additional pack sizes (2x8.8 micrograms 
and 2x22 micrograms initiation packages) for the pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen, corresponding to 
the first month supply of the 44 micrograms once weekly posology.  
The  type  IB  variation  was  withdrawn  by  the  applicant  at  the  time  of  response  to  the  Request  for 
Supplementary Information.

4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
Rebif (interferon beta-1a) was approved in Europe on 4 May 1998. The currently approved indication is 
for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS. The recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms, to 
be  administered  subcutaneously  three  times  a  week,  whereas  a  lower  dose  of  22  micrograms  three 
times a week is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating 
specialist. 
Rebif is currently not approved for patients at the early stage of the disease, i.e. when they experience 
a first single clinical, demyelinating event and the multiple sclerosis diagnosis is not yet confirmed. 
It  is  widely  acknowledged  that  irreparable  damage  to  the  central  nervous  system  occurs  from  the 
earliest  stages  of  multiple  sclerosis,  even  before  clinical  manifestation  when  patients  seemingly  are 
doing  well.  This  underlines  the  importance  of  treatment  initiation  as  early  as  possible  in  the  disease 
course. 
This  submission  constitutes  an  extension  of  the  current  Rebif  marketing  authorisation  to  include  the 
indication:  “Rebif  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  a  single  demyelinating  event  with  an  active

inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at 
high risk of developing relapsing multiple sclerosis”.  
4.2.  Clinical aspects 
4.2.1.  Introduction 
The  MAH  submitted  results  of  one  pivotal  phase  III  study  27025  (REFLEX)  in  subjects  with  a  single 
demyelinating event at high risk of converting to multiple sclerosis to support the indication “treatment 
of  a  single  demyelinating  event  with  an  active  inflammatory  process,  if  alternative  diagnoses  have 
been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing relapsing multiple sclerosis”. 
GCP 
The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH provided a statement to the effect that the clinical trial conducted outside the EU was carried 
out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
4.2.2.  Clinical efficacy  
4.2.2.1.  Main study 
One  pivotal  clinical  trial  (study  27025,  REFLEX)  supported  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Rebif  in  the 
indication applied for. 
An overview of the study is provided in the table below. 
Table 1 
Methods 
This  was  a  Phase  III,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  clinical  trial  of  RNF 
(44 mcg tiw and 44 mcg ow) in subjects considered at high risk of converting to multiple sclerosis. The 
double-blinded treatment duration was 24 months. 
A schematic of the study design is shown in Figure 1 below.

Fig. 1 Trial Design of Study 27025 (REFLEX) 
Study visits were scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months post-baseline. Relapses were 
monitored on an ongoing basis. MRI scans were assessed at Screening and at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 
18  and  24.  If  the  patient  reached  CDMS  prior  to  24  months,  MRI  scans  were  performed  at  6-month 
intervals following conversion. 
A  central  neuroradiology  centre  performed  the  central  blinded  analysis  of  all  MRI  scans.  A  separate 
MRI-DSMB  was  to  review  all  MRI  scans  that  met  the  predefined  alert  criteria  in  order  to  provide 
appropriate recommendations for the protection of individual subjects.  
Subjects reaching CDMS were switched to active treatment, at the approved 44 mcg sc tiw regimen. 
The study utilized an independent Adjudication Committee, responsible for the following: 
 
eligibility  assessment  of  individual  subjects  prior  to  randomization,  based  on  the  subjects’ 
screening MRI and clinical status, 
 
confirmation of classification or reclassification of subjects’ first demyelinating event into monofocal 
or multifocal (this was performed after randomization), 
 
 
 
adjudication of conversion to McDonald MS, 
adjudication of conversion to CDMS, 
confirmation of classification or reclassification of relapses as qualifying or non-qualifying. 
Study Participants 
The  study  enrolled  adult  male  and  female  subjects  18  to  50  years  of  age,  within  60  days  following 
onset of a single, first clinical event suggestive of MS. The clinical event had to be a new neurological 
abnormality  present  for  at  least  24  hours,  either  mono-  or  polysymptomatic,  other  than  paresthesia, 
vegetative  or  cerebral  dysfunction.  The  T2-weighted  MRI  scan  had  to  show  at  least  2  clinically  silent 
Assessment report  
Page 8/34
 
 
 
 
 
lesions,  with  a  size  of  at  least  3  mm,  at  least  one  of  which  was  ovoid  or  periventricular  or 
infratentorial.  Subjects  had  to  have  an  EDSS  score  between  0  and  5.0  (inclusive)  before  the  start  of 
treatment.  
Subjects  fulfilling  the  following  criteria  were  excluded:  a  diagnosis  of  MS  (as  per  McDonald  criteria 
[2005]) or any other disease that could better explain the patient’s signs and symptoms. Subjects with 
complete  transverse  myelitis  or  bilateral  optic  neuritis  and  subjects  who  had  received  prior 
immunomodulatory  or  immunosuppressant  therapy  were  also  excluded  (subjects  could  have  received 
oral or parenteral corticosteroids). 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  revised  McDonald  criteria  (2005)  are  widely  accepted  for  a  presumed 
diagnosis of MS under the prerequisite that they are applied to those patients with a typical clinically 
isolated  syndrome  (CIS)  suggestive  of  MS  or  symptoms  consistent  with  CNS  inflammatory 
demyelinating disease and alternative diagnoses are excluded. 
High risk was defined in the study protocol as having experienced an event suggestive of MS within 60 
days prior to randomisation and presenting at least 2 clinically silent lesions on T2-weighted brain MRI.  
The CHMP considered that there is no standard definition of “high risk of converting” and that various 
criteria were applied in prior studies with other MS product; the issue of defining high risk patients is 
further discussed in the Discussion of clinical efficacy section). 
Treatments 
Subjects were allocated to one of 2 active dosage regimens (44 mcg tiw or ow) or matching placebo in 
a 1:1:1 randomization ratio. The blinded treatment duration was 24 months. Patients were titrated in 
accordance with the currently approved indication (8.8 mcg during the initial 2 weeks, 22 mcg during 
weeks 3 and 4, with the full dose administered from week 5 onward). Treatments were administered 
as subcutaneous injections using an auto-injector device, if possible at the same time (late afternoon 
or evening) on the same 3 days (e.g. Monday, Wednesday and Friday), as recorded by subjects using 
diary cards. Patients randomized to RNF 44 mcg ow were provided with one active dose and 2 placebo 
doses to mimic the tiw treatment. 
If subjects converted to CDMS during the blinded treatment period, they were re-titrated to open-label 
treatment with RNF 44 mcg tiw for the remainder of the 24 months. 
Concomitant Therapy 
Subjects were recommended to take 400 mg of ibuprofen or 1000 mg of paracetamol/acetaminophen 
prophylactically with each injection during the first 12 weeks of treatment. If necessary, subjects could 
take  additional  doses  every  4  to  6  hours  thereafter  during  the  first  24  hours  (up  to  a  maximum  of 
1200 mg ibuprofen or 3 g paracetamol/acetaminophen within any 24-hour period). 
Subjects were treated with corticosteroids for relapses at the discretion of the treating physician. Any 
MRI scans conducted during the trial were to be performed before administration of steroids or at least 
7 days after the last steroid dose. 
Additional 
immunomodulatory  or 
immunosuppressive 
therapy,  chronic  or  monthly  pulse 
corticosteroids,  cytokines  or  anti-cytokine  therapy,  plasmaferesis,  telbivudine  or  any  experimental  or 
off-label MS treatments were not allowed.

Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  RNF  44  mcg  (tiw  and  ow)  versus 
placebo  on  the  time  to  conversion  to  McDonald  multiple  sclerosis  in  subjects  with  a  first  clinal 
demyelinating event at high risk of converting to MS. 
The main secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of RNF 44 mcg (tiw and ow) versus placebo 
on the time to conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) in subjects with a first clinical 
demyelinating event at high risk of converting to MS. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the time to conversion to MS according to the revised 
McDonald  criteria  (2005),  as  confirmed  by  the  independent  Adjudication  Committee.  A  subject  was 
considered  to  have  converted  to  MS  according  to  the  2005  McDonald  criteria  if,  following  the  first 
clinical  demyelinating  event,  there  was  evidence  of  dissemination  in  space  and  in  time  based  on  a 
clinical event or on clinical data and MRI. 
The  main  secondary  endpoint  was  the  time  to  conversion  to  clinically  definite  MS  (CDMS).  This  was 
defined by either a second attack or a 3-month sustained increase (≥ 1.5 points) in the EDSS score (as 
confirmed by the independent Adjudication Committee). 
The main MRI-based secondary endpoint was the mean number of Combined Unique Active (CUA) MRI 
lesions per subject per scan from randomization up to Month 24 or up to CDMS conversion, whichever 
occurred first. 
Such MRI lesion was defined as a newly active or persistently active lesion found during a given scan 
on  the  PD/T2  sequence  or  the  T1  Gd-enhancing  sequence,  without  being  double  counted.  As  per  the 
data collected, CUA MRI was computed by the sum of the new lesions and the persisting lesions on the 
T1 Gd-enhancing scan, plus the sum of the new lesions and the growing lesions on the PD/T2 scan not 
enhancing  on  the  T1  Gd-enhancing  scan.  The  mean  number  of  CUA  MRI  lesions  per  subject  per  scan 
was  calculated  as  the  subject’s  total  number  of  CUA  lesions  across  all  available  scans  during  the  DB 
period, divided by the subject’s total number of available scans during that period. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints included the following: 
  Mean number of new T2 lesions per subject per scan 
  Mean number of new T1 lesions per subject per scan 
  Mean number of new Gd-enhancing lesions per subject per scan 
 
 
 
T2 lesion volume 
T1 hypointense lesion volume 
T1 Gd-enhancing lesion volume 
  Annualized relapse rate 
 
 
Proportion of relapse-free subjects during 12 months 
Proportion of relapse-free subjects during 24 months 
  EDSS change from baseline over time 
  Changes from baseline

The  CHMP  considered  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  acceptable  and  acknowledged  the  use  of 
an independent Adjudication Committee in confirming the diagnosis.  
Sample size 
RNF  44  mcg  tiw  vs.  placebo  was  considered  the  main  treatment  group  comparison.  It  was  estimated 
that a total of 450 subjects equally allocated to each of the 3 treatment groups (placebo, RNF 44 mcg 
ow and RNF 44 mcg tiw) would be required to achieve 165 events for the comparison of RNF 44 mcg 
tiw  vs.  placebo  and  238  events  in  total  (96  in  placebo  group,  73  in  RNF  44  mcg  ow  group  and  69  in 
RNF 44 mcg  tiw group) after approximately 21 months of recruitment (assuming a recruitment of 30 
subjects  per  month).  This  was  to  provide  90%  power  using  a  2-sided  log-rank  test  at  a  0.05  alpha-
error for detecting an HR of 0.6 in the primary efficacy endpoint for the main comparison RNF 44 mcg 
tiw vs. placebo, corresponding to an expected proportion of 15% free of conversion over 24 months in 
the placebo group and 32% in the RNF 44 mcg tiw group. 
Assuming  a  withdrawal  rate  of  10%  over  24  months,  the  planned  sample  size  was  increased  to 
480 subjects equally allocated to each of the 3 treatment groups (i.e., 160 subjects per group). 
The sample size was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Randomisation 
Subjects  were  randomized  on  Day  1  in  a  ratio  1:1:1  to  either  RNF  44  mcg  tiw,  RNF  44  mcg  ow  or 
placebo tiw through a centralized IVRS system, using a minimization procedure to prevent imbalances 
between treatment groups and using the following a priori-defined stratification factors: 
  Age (<30 years, ≥ 30 years), 
  Classification  of  first  clinical  demyelinating  event  (monofocal,  multifocal)  according  to  the 
investigator, 
  Steroid use at first clinical demyelinating event (yes, no), 
 
Presence of at least 1 Gd-enhancing lesion (yes, no) according to the central MRI reading centre. 
The  CHMP  considered  the  randomisation  and  randomisation  stratification  factors  acceptable  and 
reflective of previous interferon studies. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was conducted in a double-blind fashion. If subjects converted to clinically definite multiple 
sclerosis  (CDMS)  during  the  blinded  period,  they  were  switched  and  re-titrated  to  the  recommended 
posology  of  Rebif  44 micrograms  three  times  per  week  in  an  open  label  manner,  while  maintaining 
blinding as to their initial randomisation. 
The  evaluating  physician  conducting  the  neurological  examinations  and  the  neuro-radiology  centre 
team  assessing  the  MRI  scans  were  blinded.  Before  the  physician  evaluated  the  subjects,  all  visible 
injection  site  reactions  were  covered  by  clothing;  these  site  reactions  were  not  examined  by  the 
evaluating physician. 
The measures taken to maintain the blinding during the study were considered sufficient by the CHMP.

Statistical methods 
The  main  analysis  population  for  the  efficacy  endpoints  was  the  ITT  population,  consisting  of  all 
randomized subjects. Subjects were analyzed according to their randomly allocated treatment. 
The primary efficacy variable (time to conversion to McDonald MS) was analyzed by 2-sided stratified 
(by  randomization  stratification  factors)  log-rank  test  at  the  0.05  significance  level.  The  hazard  ratio 
with  2-sided  95%  CIs  was  estimated  using  an  adjusted  Cox’s  proportional  hazards  model  using 
treatment  and  the  stratification  factors  as  covariates.  Subjects  who  did  not  convert  to  McDonald  MS 
within the 24-month trial period from randomization up to the Month 24 visit were considered as right-
censored  data.  The  date  of  the  last  available  MRI  assessment  reported  from  randomization  up  to  the 
Month 24 visit was used as time of censoring. 
The secondary endpoint of time to CDMS was analyzed similarly. 
For  pair-wise  comparisons  for  the  secondary  endpoint  of  CUA  lesions,  the  treatment  effect  with 
corresponding  95%  CIs  was  estimated  using  a  negative  binomial  model  including  treatment  and 
stratification  factors  as  covariates.  The  p-value  for  this  comparison  was  estimated  using  a  non-
parametric ANOVA on ranks model including treatment and stratification factors as covariates. 
The primary efficacy endpoint (time to conversion to McDonald MS), time to conversion to CDMS and 
the  main  MRI-based  efficacy  endpoint  (mean  number  of  CUA  lesions)  were  part  of  the  hypothesis 
testing and type I error control using a hierarchical approach in the following sequence: 
(I)  RNF 44 mcg tiw vs. placebo for: 
1.  Time to McDonald MS at the first level of the hierarchy 
2.  Time to CDMS at the second level of the hierarchy 
3.  Mean number of CUA lesions per subject per scan at the third level of the hierarchy 
(II)  RNF 44 mcg ow vs. placebo for the same 3 endpoints in the same hierarchical order: 
4.  Time to McDonald MS at the first level of the hierarchy 
5.  Time to CDMS at the second level of the hierarchy 
6.  Mean number of CUA lesions per subject per scan at the third level of the hierarchy 
The 6 confirmatory tests were 2-sided and performed at the 0.05 significance level in the pre-specified 
fixed sequence described above with confirmatory testing being continued if the current hypothesis (H0) 
in the sequence was rejected. 
Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses 
According to the study protocol, the MAH planned to conduct the first analysis for the main treatment 
group  comparison  (RNF  44  mcg  tiw  vs.  placebo)  when  a  total  number  of  107  conversions  to  CDMS 
were  reached  in  the  placebo  group  and  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  group  combined  during  the  24-month  study 
period, as monitored by an independent statistician, unless the timing of this analysis would fall within 
3 months  of  the  24-month  analysis.  The  last  projection  received  in  December  2009  estimated  that 
these  107  events  would  not  be  reached  at  least  3  months  prior  to  the  24-month  analysis  and 
accordingly, the first analysis was not performed. The CHMP considered this approach acceptable.

Results  
Recruitment 
The  study  was  performed  between  16  November  2006  (first  subject,  first  visit)  and  13  August  2010 
(last subject, last visit). Eighty study centres across 28 countries randomized one or more subjects. 
Participant flow 
A total of 517 subjects (ITT Population) were randomized and 515 subjects started the DB treatment 
(DB Safety Population), of which 339 subjects (65.8%) completed the 24-month DB treatment period; 
120 subjects (23.3%) converted to CDMS and subsequently switched to OL RNF 44 mcg tiw (OL Safety 
Population) and 56 subjects (10.9%)  prematurely discontinued treatment. The disposition of subjects 
is summarised in Figure 2.

Demographics and other Baseline Characteristics 
Baseline characteristics for the ITT population are summarized in table 4. The treatment groups were 
similar with respect to demographic, clinical and MRI parameters.  
Overall, EDSS scores of randomized subjects were balanced across treatment groups at baseline. The 
median  EDSS  score  was  1.50  in  the  overall  population,  ranging  from  0.0  to  4.0.  The  majority  of 
subjects (83.9%) had a score between 1.0 and 2.5.

Table 4: 
Baseline Characteristics (ITT Population) 
A single screening MRI scan was performed at least 30 days after the clinical event suggestive of MS 
and  10  days  prior  to  study  day  1.  In  the  overall  study  population,  58.8%  of  subjects  had  no  T1  Gd-
enhancing lesions, 17.6% of subjects had one lesion, 9.3% had two lesions and the remaining subjects 
had  three  or  more  lesions,  with  similar  distribution  across  the  treatment  groups.  The  majority  of 
subjects had at least 9 T2 lesions at screening. Furthermore, the majority of subjects received steroids 
for  the  first  clinical  event.  The  CHMP  noted  that  there  was  consistency  in  the  monofocal/  multifocal 
classification by the investigator and the Adjudication Committee. Overall, the CHMP was of the opinion 
that  the  study  population  was  similar  to  that  enrolled  in  other  beta  interferon  studies  and  was 
representative of the population observed in clinical practice. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The  main  primary  endpoint  was  the  time  to  conversion  to  McDonald  MS  over  24 months,  for  RNF 
44 mcg  tiw  and  ow,  as  compared  to  placebo.  The  main  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  time  to 
conversion to CDMS. The main efficacy results are summarized in table 5 and figures 3 and 4.

RNF  44  mcg  tiw  and  RNF  44  mcg  ow  statistically  significantly  delayed  the  conversion  from  the  first 
clinical  event  to  McDonald  MS  as  compared  with  placebo  (adjusted  log-rank  test:  p<0.001  and 
p=0.008, respectively). Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the cumulative probability of conversion to 
McDonald MS over 24 months was 85.8% in the placebo group compared to 62.5% and 75.5% in the 
RNF 44 mcg tiw and RNF 44 mcg ow groups, respectively. 
Similarly,  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  and  RNF  44  mcg  ow  statistically  significantly  delayed  the  conversion  from 
the  first  clinical  event  to  CDMS  as  compared  with  placebo  (adjusted  log-rank  test:  p<0.001  and 
p=0.002, respectively). Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the cumulative probability of conversion to 
CDMS  over  24  months  was  37.5%  in  the  placebo  group  compared  to  20.6%  and  21.6%  in  the  RNF 
44 mcg tiw and RNF 44 mcg ow groups, respectively. 
In an exploratory analysis, comparing the RNF 44 mcg tiw group to the 44 mcg ow group indicated a 
difference between the dose groups for McDonald MS (HR = 0.71, 95% CI [0.54, 0.91], log-rank test: 
p=0.009). This difference was not observed for time to conversion to CDMS (RNF 44 mcg tiw vs. RNF 
44 mcg ow: HR = 0.90, 95% CI [0.56, 1.43], log-rank p=0.774).  
Sensitivity analyses 
A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted for the primary endpoint including the following: 
Unadjusted Analysis 
Treatment  group  comparison  and  treatment  effect  estimate  was  further  investigated  using  an 
unadjusted  Cox’s  proportional  hazards  model.  The  pair-wise  comparison  of  active  treatment  groups 
versus placebo using a 2-sided unstratified log-rank test showed a statistically significant delay in the 
time  to  conversion  to  McDonald  MS  in  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  (p-value  <  0.001)  and  ow  (p-value  =  0.004) 
treatment groups as compared to placebo. 
Interval-Censored Analysis 
Conversion to McDonald MS could take place at a fixed time point dictated by the timing of the MRIs 
(every 3 months) or at the occurrence of the second clinical attack which could occur within an interval 
of time defined by visits. Additional sensitivity analysis was performed using statistical methods dealing 
with  interval-censored  type  of  data  as  parametric  estimations  using  Weibull  modelling.  Parameter 
estimates  using  both  the  adjusted  and  unadjusted  Weibull  models  with    interval  censoring  showed  a 
statistically significant reduction of the risk of converting to McDonald MS over 24 months both for RNF 
44 mcg tiw (p-value <0.001) and RNF 44 mcg ow (p-value = 0.001) compared to placebo. 
Analysis based on Initial Cut-Off Date 
As  the  original  First  Analysis  based  on  the  McDonald  conversions  prior  to  Protocol  Amendment  5  was 
performed  at  the  same  time  as  the  24-Month  Analysis  (as  per  Amendment  5),  the  number  of 
conversions  to  McDonald  MS  at  the  time  of  analysis  was  higher,  providing  higher  power  than  initially 
defined. Therefore, the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint and the secondary analysis of 
the primary efficacy endpoint were also performed based on the initial cut-off date defined by the date 
when the 165 conversions to McDonald MS originally required were accumulated in the placebo group 
and the RNF 44 mcg tiw group combined. The results of these analyses were comparable.

Per-Protocol Analysis 
The primary and secondary analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint, the unadjusted analysis and the 
interval-censored analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (as described above) were also performed 
on  the  PP  Population,  defined  as  all  subjects  from  the  ITT  population  who  did  not  have  any  major 
protocol deviations likely to interfere with the efficacy assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The CHMP considered the results of sensitivity analyses to be consistent with the primary analyses. 
Subgroup analyses 
The  primary  (time  to  McDonald  MS)  and  main  secondary  (time  to  CDMS)  efficacy  endpoints  were 
analyzed  by  subgroup,  using  the  randomization  stratification  factors:  age  (<30  years,  ≥30  years), 
classification  of  first  clinical  demyelinating  event  (Monofocal,  Multifocal),  steroid  use  at  first 
demyelinating event (Yes, No) and presence of at least 1 Gd-enhancing lesion at screening (Yes, No). 
Additional subgroup analyses based on other (a priori defined) factors included number of T2 lesions at 
screening visit (<9 T2 lesions, ≥9 T2 lesions) and gender (Male, Female). The results are summarized 
in Tables 6 and 7 below.

Table 7: 
Time to Conversion to CDMS by Subgroup (ITT Population) 
The effect of RNF 44 mcg tiw on delaying the time to conversion to McDonald MS was maintained and 
statistically significant in all pre-defined subgroups except one (male [p=0.107]). The treatment effect 
of  RNF  44  mcg  ow  did  not  reach  statistical  significance  in  several  subgroups  (<30  years  [p=0.072]; 
monofocal [p=0.074]; no steroid use at first demyelinating event [p=0.142]; no Gd-enhancing lesion 
at baseline [p=0.069] and male [p=0.694]). 
Statistically  significant  effects  of  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  on  the  time  to  CDMS  were  observed  across  the 
subgroups  except  for  subjects  with  <9  T2  lesions  at  screening  (p=0.081)  and  males  (p=0.076). 
Regarding RNF 44 mcg ow for time to conversion to CDMS, statistical significance was not reached in 
some cases (no steroid use at first demyelinating event [p=0.180]; no Gd-enhancing lesion at baseline 
[p=0.251]; <9 T2 lesions at baseline [p=0.053] and male [p=0.138]). 
Secondary MRI-based Endpoints 
Mean number of CUA lesions 
The main MRI-based secondary efficacy endpoint was the mean number of CUA lesions per subject per 
scan from randomization up to Month 24 or up to conversion to CDMS, whichever occurred first.  
The  main  analysis  of  this  endpoint  consisted  of  the  pair-wise  comparison  of  the  treatment  groups  at 
the  0.05  significance  level  using  a  non-parametric  ANOVA  on  ranks  model  including  treatment  and 
randomization stratification factors as covariates.

Within  the  double-blind  period,  the  treatment  with  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  and  RNF  44  mcg  ow  reduced  the 
mean  number  of CUA lesions  per  subject  per  scan (p<0.001  for  both).  The  comparison  between  RNF 
44  mcg  tiw  and  RNF  44  mcg  ow  also  showed  statistically  significant  difference  (p=0.002).  The  mean 
(SD)  number  of  CUA  lesions  per  subject  per  scan  in  the  DB  treatment  period  was  0.60  (1.15)  in  the 
RNF 44 mcg tiw treatment group, 1.23 (4.26) in the RNF 44 mcg ow treatment group, and 2.70 (5.23) 
in the placebo treatment group. 
Table 8: 
CUA Lesions during the DB Period (ITT Population) 
Other secondary efficacy variables 
The  mean  number  of  new  T2  lesions  per  subject  per  scan  was  significantly  lower  in  subjects 
randomized  to  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  (0.50)  and  in  subjects  randomized  to  RNF  44  mcg  ow  (0.59)  than  in 
subjects randomized to Placebo (1.35).  
The  mean  number  of  new  T1  hypointense  lesions  per  subject  per  scan  was  significantly  lower  in 
subjects randomized to RNF 44 mcg tiw (0.35) and in subjects randomized to RNF 44 mcg ow (0.46) 
than in subjects randomized to placebo (0.84).  
The mean number of new Gd-enhancing lesions per subject per scan was significantly lower in subjects 
randomized  to  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  (0.16)  and  in  subjects  randomized  to  RNF  44  mcg  ow  (0.35)  than  in 
subjects randomized to placebo (0.97). 
Over  the  duration  of  24  months  in  subjects  with  a  first  demyelinating  event,  small  changes  in  EDSS 
scores were observed in all treatment groups over the entire study period, showing a mean change in 
EDSS  score  of  -0.09  in  the  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  treatment  group,  0.01  in  the  RNF  44  mcg  ow  treatment 
group  and  0.14  in  the  placebo  treatment  group.  No  clinically  significant  changes  were  observed  for 
MSFC or its individual components.

4.2.3.  Discussion of clinical efficacy 
The MAH submitted results of study 27025 (a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing RNF 44 
mcg tiw and 44 mcg ow vs. placebo in patients with CIS) to support the following indication: 
Rebif  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  a  single  demyelinating  event  with  an  active 
inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at 
high risk of developing relapsing multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1). 
With  respect  to  clinical  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  that  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  and  RNF  44  mcg  ow 
statistically  significantly  delayed  the  conversion  from  the  first  clinical  event  to  McDonald  MS  as 
compared  with  placebo  (adjusted  log-rank  test:  p<0.001  and  p=0.008,  respectively).  Based  on 
Kaplan-Meier estimates, the cumulative probability of conversion to McDonald MS over 24 months was 
85.8% in the placebo group compared to 62.5% and 75.5% in the RNF 44  mcg tiw and RNF 44 mcg 
ow groups, respectively. 
Similarly,  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  and  RNF  44  mcg  ow  statistically  significantly  delayed  the  conversion  from 
the  first  clinical  event  to  CDMS  as  compared  with  placebo  (p<0.001  and  p=0.002,  respectively).  The 
cumulative  probability  of  conversion  to  CDMS  over  24  months  was  37.5%  in  the  placebo  group 
compared to 20.6% and 21.6% in the RNF 44 mcg tiw and RNF 44 mcg ow groups, respectively. 
Thus, the CHMP was of the opinion that both dosing regimens of Rebif were indicative of an effect in 
delaying time to McDonald MS (2005) and time to CDMS in the study population enrolled.  
Subjects had to have an EDSS score between 0 and 5.0 (inclusive) before the start of treatment. The 
mean  baseline  EDSS  score  was  1.53  in  the  placebo  treatment  group,  1.50  in  the  RNF  44  mcg  ow 
treatment  group  and  1.51  in  the  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  treatment  group.  The  median  (Q1;  Q3)  baseline 
EDSS score was 1.50 (1.00; 2.00) in all treatment groups. Over the duration of 24 months in subjects 
with  a  first  demyelinating  event,  only  small  changes  in  EDSS  scores  were  observed  in  all  treatment 
groups over  the entire study period,  although this endpoint reached statistical significance (p=0.011) 
for  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  vs.  placebo  at  last  observed  value  during  the  DB  period  (mean  change  in  EDSS 
score: -0.09 in the RNF 44 mcg tiw treatment group, 0.01 in the RNF 44 mcg ow treatment group, and 
0.14 in the placebo treatment group). Although in the current study, conversion to CDMS was defined 
as  either  a  second  attack  or  a  sustained  increase  (≥  1.5  points)  in  the  EDSS  score,  the  CHMP 
considered that there was no clinically significant increase in disability progression during the course of 
the study for any of the treatment groups. 
During  their review,  the CHMP  expressed  concerns  with  respect  to  the  definition  of  ‘high-risk  patient’ 
used in the study 27025. This study included patients with a single, first clinical event suggestive of MS 
and at least 2 clinically silent T2 lesions, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of which was ovoid 
or periventricular or infratentorial. The CHMP noted that the definition of ‘high risk to conversion’ is not 
well  established.  Based  on  prior  studies  with  other  interferon  products  for  similar  indications,  a  more 
conservative  approach  was  previously  applied,  whereby  patients  with  at  least  nine  T2  hyperintense 
lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan 
have been referred to in the product information. In a prior study with Betaferon (BENEFIT), a higher 
risk for progression to CDMS within 2 years was seen in monofocal patients with at least 9 T2 lesions 
or Gd-enhancement on the brain MRI at baseline. The risk of CDMS in the placebo group for patients 
with these characteristics increased from 31% in patients with <9 T2 lesions to 55% in patients with 
≥9  T2  lesions.  Similarly,  the  risk  of  CDMS  increased  from  36%  in  patients  without  Gd-enhancing 
lesions to 63% in patients with Gd-enhancing lesions. 
Similar  trends  were  observed  in  the  current  study  27025.  Placebo  patients  with  ≥9  T2  lesions  at 
baseline  had  an  estimated  40%  risk  of  developing  CDMS  over  2  years  as  compared  with  32%  of 
Assessment report  
Page 21/34
 
 
 
 
patients with less than 9 lesions. Placebo patients with Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline had 46% risk 
of developing CDMS, compared with 31% of patients with no such lesions.  
Similarly,  placebo  patients  with  ≥9  T2  lesions  at  baseline  had  an  estimated  96%  risk  to  develop 
McDonald MS over 2 years as compared with 62% of patients with less than 9 lesions. Placebo patients 
with Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline had 94% risk to develop McDonald MS, compared with 79% of 
patients  with  no  such  lesions.  Considering  these  data,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  those  patients 
with  ≥9  T2  lesions  at  baseline  and/or  those  patients  with  Gd-enhancing  lesions  at  baseline  could  be 
seen as a population at highest risk of conversion within 2 years. 
In  the  current  study,  statistically  significant  reductions  in  time  to  CDMS  were  only  observed  in  those 
patients with ≥9 T2 lesions and/or presence of Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline, in both the 44 mcg 
tiw and ow dose groups. For time to McDonald MS, statistically significant effects were observed for all 
four subgroups, but only for the RNF 44 mcg tiw dose. The CHMP considered that positive trends were 
seen in all patient categories and the lack of statistical significance could be due to a lower number of 
subjects in some subgroups.  
Overall, given the current data, the CHMP concluded that patients with ≥9 T2 at baseline and/or with 
Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline could be seen to be at highest risk of conversion within 2 years, and 
requested that the MAH revise the text in section 5.1 of the SmPC as follows: 
“For  the  time  being  there  is  no  well  established  definition  of  a  high  risk  patient,  although  a  more 
conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least 
one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the initial 
scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk.” 
The CHMP considered that steroid treatment of the first event was not mandated by the protocol, but 
given at the discretion of the investigator. Overall, 365 out of 517 randomized subjects (71%) received 
steroids  (i.v.  in  most  cases)  to  treat  the  first  clinical  demyelinating  event.  Subjects  who  received 
steroids  at  baseline  and  who  were  allocated  to  placebo,  RNF  44  mcg  ow  and  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  had  a 
cumulative  probability  of  86%,  74%  and  65%,  respectively  of converting  to  McDonald  MS,  compared 
with 85%, 78% and 56%, of subjects who did not, respectively. Similarly, subjects receiving steroids 
and who were allocated to placebo, RNF 44 mcg ow and RNF 44 mcg tiw had a cumulative probability 
of  39%,  22%  and  24%,  respectively  of  converting  to  CDMS,  compared  with  34%,  21%  and  12%, 
respectively  who  had  not.  The  CHMP  noted  that  the  subgroup  with  no  prior  steroid  therapy  was 
relatively small (approximately 30% of the population), but considered that the data indicated a very 
similar  magnitude  of  effect  in  both  patient  categories.  In  this  context,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion 
that intravenous steroid treatment need not be a mandatory component for selecting high-risk patients 
for  treatment  with  Rebif.  Thus,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  restricting  the  indication  to  patients  severe 
enough to warrant treatment with intravenous steroids was not necessary. 
The CHMP considered that exploratory analyses were done comparing the two dosing regimens; these 
showed no statistically significant differences between the 44 mcg tiw and ow dose groups with respect 
to  CDMS  (p=0.774).  However,  the  difference  between  the  tiw  and  ow  dose  groups  for  time  to 
McDonald  MS  was  statistically  significant  (p=0.009).  Furthermore,  44  mcg  tiw  was  observed  to 
statistically  significantly  reduce  the  mean  number  of  CUA  lesions  per  subject  per  scan  (p=0.002) 
compared to 44 mcg ow.  
Overall, the CHMP concluded that study 27075 has shown a benefit of treatment with Rebif in patients 
with  CIS.  Based  on  the  current  data  this  was  most  consistently  shown  for  the  44  mcg  tiw  treatment 
group. The results were statistically significant for both time to McDonald MS (2005) and time to CDMS 
in  those  patient  categories  previously  considered  by  CHMP  as  ‘high  risk’,  namely  those  patients  with 
Assessment report  
Page 22/34
 
 
 
 
≥9 T2 lesions and/or those patients with presence of Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline, and regardless 
of monofocal or multifocal disease presentation. 
The rationale for the alternative 44 mcg ow dosing regimen was questioned by the CHMP. Although it 
was acknowledged that once-weekly dosing may enhance patient adherence to therapy, the CHMP was 
concerned  that  based  on  the  data  available,  efficacy  of  this  dosing  regimen  could  be  inferior  to  the 
thrice weekly treatment and requested that the MAH should further discuss the rationale for proposing 
a 44 mcg ow dose regimen from an efficacy and safety/tolerability point of view. Eventually, the MAH 
took the decision not to pursue the once-weekly posology in the current procedure. Consequently, the 
Type IB variation to introduce additional pack sizes for the PFP and PFS initiation packs, relevant to the 
once weekly dosing, was no longer needed and therefore, the MAH withdrew the type IB variation. 
Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The  double  blind  (DB)  safety  population  consisted  of  all  randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least 
one dose  of  study  drug.    A  subpopulation,  referred  to  as  the  “OL  safety  population”  consisted  of  all 
subjects from the DB safety population who received at least one open label study treatment injection 
with RNF 44 mcg tiw after having converted to CDMS. The DB Safety Population included 515 subjects, 
171 subjects in the placebo treatment group, 173 in the RNF 44 mcg ow group and 171 in the RNF 44 
mcg tiw group (see section Participant flow). 
A  total  of  130  subjects  converted  to  CDMS  and  of  these,  120  subjects  (59  in  the  placebo  treatment 
group, 30 in the RNF 44 mcg ow group and 31 in the RNF 44 mcg tiw group) switched to OL RNF 44 
mcg tiw and were included in the OL safety population. A descriptive summary of the safety population 
is provided in table 2.  
Demographic  characteristics  of  subjects  in  the  DB  safety  population  were  balanced  across  treatment 
groups and similar to the ITT population. 
Treatment exposure 
Table  9  summarises  the  study  drug  exposure  during  the  DB  treatment  period  (up  to  24 months  or 
conversion to CDMS, whichever occurred first). The mean time on treatment was slightly lower in the 
placebo treatment group (533.1 days) as compared to the active treatment groups (604.0 days in the 
RNF  44  mcg  tiw  treatment  group  and  609.5  days  in  the  RNF  44  mcg  ow  treatment  group).  This  was 
consistent with the higher CDMS conversion rate in the placebo treatment group as compared to both 
active treatment groups. Treatment exposure during the OL period was similar between the treatment 
groups (initial placebo, initial RNF 44 mcg ow and initial RNF mcg tiw).

Table 13: 
Incidence  of  Most  Common  TEAEs  during  OL  Treatment  Period  (≥10%  of  Subjects  in

During the blinded treatment period, the RNF treatment groups showed an AE pattern as expected for 
IFN  beta-1a,  with  a  higher  incidence  of  AEs  such  as  influenza-like  illness,  pyrexia  and  injection  site 
erythema than placebo. The injection site erythema AEs occurred more frequently in the RNF 44 mcg 
tiw group than in the 44 mcg ow group. The incidence of influenza like illness and pyrexia was slightly 
higher for the RNF 44 mcg ow group than the 44 mcg tiw group. Most AEs across the treatment groups 
were mild or moderate in intensity.  
AEs of special interest 
Adverse  events  of  interest  with  interferon-beta-1a  treatment  included  the  following  pre-specified 
groups:  flu-like  syndrome,  cytopenia,  hepatic  disorders,  thyroid  disorders,  hypersensitivity  reactions, 
skin rashes, depression and suicidal ideation and injection site reactions. The incidence of these events 
is summarized in table 14.

Increased  incidence  of  AEs  related  to  IFN  beta-1a  treatment  was  observed  in  the  RNF  44  mcg 
treatment groups as compared to placebo.  
A  similar  analysis  for  the OL  treatment  showed  an  increased  incidence  of  flu-like illness  and  injection 
site  reactions  in  newly  exposed  subjects  (those  subjects  initially  in  the  placebo  group),  which  was 
considered expected by the CHMP. 
Serious adverse events 
Two deaths occurred during the study, both in the placebo group during the DB treatment period (one 
patient  with  a  history  of  cholecystolithiasis  died  of  severe  acute  pancreatic  necrosis  and  one  patient 
died due to fatal hematoma after surgery for subtotal excision of glioblastoma). 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) other than the two fatal events were reported in 12 subjects (7.0%) in 
the placebo treatment group, 8 subjects (4.6%) in the RNF 44 mcg ow group and 6 subjects (3.5%) in 
the RNF 44 mcg tiw group.  
There  were  6  subjects  in  the  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  group  with  one  or  more  SAEs  (other  than  death)  that 
occurred  during  the  DB  treatment  period,  including  cases  of  appendicitis  (3),  dermoid  cyst  (1), 
tonsillitis  (1),  drug  hypersensitivity  (1),  deafness  congenital  (1)  and  acute  myocardial  infarction  (1). 
There were 8 subjects in the RNF 44 mcg ow group that experienced one or more SAEs: spontaneous 
abortion (1), hypacusis (1), cervical polyp (1), varicella (1), nasal septum deviation (1), iron deficiency 
anemia (1), tibia fracture (1), muscle rupture (1) and tonsillar disorder (1).  
These SAEs were either assessed unlikely to be related or unrelated to the IMP by the MAH, the CHMP 
also considered a possible relationship to Rebif in these cases unlikely. 
SAEs assessed as possibly related to study drug included a case of varicella in one subject treated with 
RNF 44 mcg ow and 2 spontaneous abortions, one in a subject receiving placebo and one in a subject 
receiving RNF 44 mcg ow.  
The SAE of varicella concerned a 26-year-old female with a history of varicella infection. She developed 
symptoms  of  varicella  approximately  20  weeks  after  starting  treatment  with  RNF  44  mcg  ow.  She 
received treatment with acyclovir and the event was considered resolved within a week. According to 
the  narrative,  a  search  of  the  safety  database  identified  other  confirmed  reports  of  varicella 
infection/herpes  zoster/shingles  in  patients  treated  with  Rebif  (with  lack  of  clarity  as  to  whether  this 
includes any cases of primary infection).  
In  the  OL  period,  SAEs  were  reported  in  one  subject  initially  randomized  to  placebo  (brief  psychotic 
disorder)  and  one  subject  initially  randomized  to  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  (cholelithiasis).  Both  events  were 
assessed as unrelated to the study drug by the investigator. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
During the DB treatment period, 6 subjects (3.5%) in the placebo treatment group, 4 subjects (2.3%) 
in the RNF 44 mcg ow treatment group and 5 subjects (2.9%) in the RNF 44 mcg tiw treatment group 
permanently discontinued treatment due to a TEAE. Two additional subjects in the placebo treatment 
group discontinued due to pregnancy. 
The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  was  influenza-like  illness  (2  subjects  each  in  the  RNF 
44 mcg ow and 44 mcg tiw group). One subject in the 44 mcg tiw group was discontinued due to mild 
increase in liver transaminases considered possibly related to study drug. 
During  the  OL  treatment  period,  three  subjects  permanently  discontinued  treatment  because  of 
increase  in  ALT  and  AST,  one  in  each  treatment  group.  In  addition,  one  subject  initially  treated  with 
Assessment report  
Page 27/34
 
 
 
 
RNF  44  mcg  tiw  discontinued  treatment  permanently  due  to  injection  site  pain.  One  subject  in  the 
initial placebo group switching to RNF tiw discontinued treatment due to pregnancy. 
Laboratory findings 
Most laboratory parameters remained within the normal range during the DB treatment period.  
Haematology 
The  majority  of  worst  post-baseline  CTCAE  grades  in  the  DB  treatment  period  for  each  of  the 
haematology assessments were Grade 0 or 1 for all treatment groups. The most notable toxicity shifts 
were seen for haemoglobin, WBC count, neutrophils and lymphocytes. There was a greater frequency 
of Grade 2 and Grade 3 toxicity for WBC count, neutrophils and lymphocytes in the two RNF treatment 
groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  One  Grade  4  shift  was  observed  in  the  placebo  group  for 
neutrophils in a subject with a normal baseline value. No Grade 4 toxicities were observed in the RNF 
treatment groups. 
Biochemistry 
The majority of the worst post-baseline CTCAE toxicity grades in the DB treatment period for each of 
the  biochemistry  assessments  were  Grade  0  or  1  for  all  treatment  groups.  The  most  notable  toxicity 
shifts were reported for total bilirubin, AST and ALT. 
In the placebo group, there was one case of Grade 2 toxicity for total bilirubin in a subject who had a 
normal  value  at  baseline.  Two  subjects  with  normal  baseline  values  and  one  subject  with  Grade  1 
baseline  value  shifted  to  Grade  2  toxicity  for  AST.  Six  subjects  with  normal  baseline  values  and 
one subject with Grade 1 baseline value shifted to Grade 2 toxicity for ALT and 1 subject with normal 
baseline value developed Grade 3 toxicity. 
In the RNF 44 mcg ow group, a shift to Grade 2 toxicity for total bilirubin occurred in one subject with 
normal baseline value and one subject with Grade 1 baseline value. Five subjects with normal baseline 
values  shifted  to  Grade  2  toxicity  for  AST.  Seven  subjects  with  normal  baseline  values  and  three 
subjects  with  Grade  1  baseline  values  shifted  to  Grade  2  toxicity  for  ALT,  whereas  five  subjects  with 
normal baseline values and one subject with Grade 1 baseline values shifted to Grade 3 toxicity.  
In the RNF 44 mcg tiw group, thirteen subjects with normal baseline values shifted to Grade 2 toxicity 
for AST and two subjects shifted to Grade 3. Nineteen subjects with normal baseline values and three 
subjects  with  Grade  1  baseline  values  shifted  to  Grade  2  toxicity  for  ALT.  Eight  subjects  with  normal 
baseline values and three subjects with Grade 1 baseline values shifted to Grade 3. A shift from normal 
to Grade 4 toxicity was reported for one subject. 
Overall, haematology parameters such as haemoglobin, platelets, WBC counts, lymphocyte counts and 
neutrophil  counts  were  lower  in  both  active  treatment  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group, 
generally  with  a  dose  dependent  decrease.  The  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  treatment  regimen  showed  a  higher 
frequency of abnormally high AST and ALT values compared with the RNF 44 mcg ow regimen. 
Immunogenicity 
Samples  for  immunogenicity  assessments  were  taken  at  6-monthly  intervals.  No  sampling  was 
performed at conversion to CDMS (at the end of the DB Period). The same ELISA for binding antibodies 
(BAbs)  and  the  same  cell-based  assay  for  the  determination  of  neutralizing  anti-interferon-beta 
antibodies (NAbs), i.e. the cytopathic effect (CPE) assay that was used for previous Rebif studies, was 
used in study 27025.  
Assessment report  
Page 28/34
 
 
 
 
All  samples  were  screened  for  BAbs  and  BAb  positive  samples  were  further  tested  for  NAbs,  as  the 
ELISA  test  for  BAbs  was  found  to  be  an  effective  screening  procedure  for  NAbs.  NAb  positivity  was 
defined by a titer of ≥20 NU/ml. 
Twenty-five  (14.8%)  subjects  treated  with  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  were  NAb-positive  at  the  Last  Observed 
Visit (LOV) of the 24-month study period. The proportion of subjects treated with RNF 44 mcg tiw who 
were  NAb-positive  at  any  time  during  the  24  months  was  15.4%;  the  median  NAb  titer  was  1345 
NU/ml. Twenty-eight (16.7%) subjects treated with RNF 44 mcg ow were NAb-positive at the LOV of 
the whole study period. The proportion of subjects treated with RNF 44 mcg ow who were NAb-positive 
at any time during the 24 months was 18.5%; the median NAb titer was 393 NU/ml. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  similar  NAb-positive  rates  were  observed  with  ow  and  tiw  dosing,  at  a 
frequency in line with that previously observed with RNF treatment. Median titers were lower with the 
44  mcg  ow  treatment.  Antibody  formation  will  be  further  followed  in  an  extension  study,  which  the 
CHMP considered of interest with regard to long-term efficacy and safety. 
4.2.4.  Discussion of clinical safety 
The CHMP considered that during the blinded treatment period, the RNF treatment groups showed an 
AE pattern as could be expected of interferon beta-1a, with a higher incidence of adverse events such 
as influenza-like illness, pyrexia and injection site erythema compared to placebo.  
In  the  context  of  varicella  reports  identified  in  the  MAH´s  safety  database,  the  CHMP  requested  that 
the MAH discuss whether ‘varicella infection’ and/or ‘herpes zoster’ should be included in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC. In response to this request, the MAH provided a cumulative review and a detailed analysis 
of  herpes  zoster  and  varicella  Infection  cases.  The  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  review  did  not 
indicate an increased risk of herpes zoster/ varicella in MS patients treated with Rebif and agreed that 
the company will continue to monitor these cases as part of the routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  incidence  of  injection  site  erythema  AEs,  as  well  as  laboratory 
abnormalities  such  as  elevated  liver  transaminases  was  slightly  lower  in  the  RNF  44  mcg  ow  group 
than in the 44 mcg tiw group, whereas the incidence of influenza-like illness and pyrexia was slightly 
higher.  Over  the  double-blind  period  of  study  27025,  the  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  flu-like 
symptoms at any time was 70.5% in the RNF 44 mcg ow group compared with 54.4% in the RNF 44 
mcg  tiw  group.  Similarly,  12.7%  of  patients  in  the  44  mcg  ow  group  experienced  pyrexia,  compared 
with 3.5% in the tiw group. The CHMP considered that this could be a random finding or, as discussed 
by  the  MAH,  the  difference  in  incidence  could  be  explained  by  the  more  sustained  level  of  IFN-beta 
effect  with  fewer  peaks  and  troughs  in  the  tiw  compared  with  the  ow  dosing.  As  mentioned  in  the 
clinical  efficacy  section,  the  alternative  ow  dosing  regimen  was  withdrawn  by  the  MAH  during  the 
procedure and thus, the CHMP agreed that this observation did not need to be discussed further. 
From a safety perspective, the CHMP concluded that the overall safety and tolerability profile for Rebif 
was as expected and did not lead to any new safety concerns.  
4.3.  Risk management plan 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  dossier,  was  of  the  opinion  that  no  new 
pharmacovigilance activities in addition to those already being performed were needed to monitor the 
safety of the product. 
With  this  procedure,  the  opportunity  was  taken  to  introduce  the  standard  text  regarding  the  risk 
management plan submission requirements in the Annex II. 
Assessment report

4.4.  Changes to the Product Information 
The  MAH  proposed  the  following  changes  to  the  Product  Information  (PI),  to  which  the  CHMP  agreed 
(new  text=  underlined,  deleted  text=  strikethrough).  The  changes  shown  below  are  those  related  to 
the extension of indication, for a complete set of changes see Attachment 1 to this report. 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
Section 4.1 
Rebif is indicated for the treatment of  
 
patients  with  a  single  demyelinating  event  with  an  active  inflammatory  process,  if  alternative 
diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically 
definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) 
 
patients  with  relapsing  multiple  sclerosis.  In  clinical  trials,  this  was  characterised  by  two  or  more 
acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). 
Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without 
ongoing relapsing activity (see section 5.1). 
Section 4.2  
Posology 
... 
First demyelinating event 
The posology for patients who have experienced a first demyelinating event is 44 micrograms of Rebif 
given three times per week by subcutaneous injection.  
Section 4.8 
... 
The data presented isare obtained from pooled controlled clinical studies in multiple sclerosis 
(placebo=824 patients; Rebif 22 micrograms three times per week (TIW)=398 patients; 
Rebif 44 micrograms TIW=727 patients) and shows the frequency of adverse reactions observed at 
six months (in excess over placebo). Adverse reactions are listed below by frequency of occurrence 
and by MedDRA System Organ Class.  
Section 5.1 
Single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis 
One  2-year  controlled  clinical  trial  with  Rebif  was  performed  in  patients  with  a  single  clinical  event 
suggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had  at least 
two clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of 
which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could 
better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded.  
Patients  were  randomised  in  a  double-blind  manner  to  either  Rebif  44 micrograms  given  three  times 
per  week,  Rebif  44 micrograms  once  weekly,  or  placebo.  If  a  second  clinical  demyelinating  event 
Assessment report  
Page 30/34
 
 
 
 
 
occurred  confirming  definite  multiple  sclerosis,  patients  switched  to  the  recommended  posology  of 
Rebif  44 micrograms  three  times  per week  in  an  open  label  manner,  while maintaining blinding  as  to 
initial randomisation. Efficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to 
placebo from this study are as follows:

For  the  time  being  there  is  no  well  established  definition  of  a  high  risk  patient,  although  a  more 
conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least 
one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the initial 
scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. 
Package Leaflet 
Section 1 
Rebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the 
severity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. It is also approved for use in patients who 
have experienced a single clinical event likely to be a first sign of multiple sclerosis. 
Section 3 
Dose 
Patients who have experienced a single clinical event  
The usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week for adults and adolescents 
from 16 years of age.

In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representatives of the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Norway and Romania. 
5.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Overall, the CHMP was of the view that results of study 27075 supported a positive benefit-risk balance 
of Rebif in the treatment in patients with clinically isolated syndrome to delay a diagnosis of multiple 
sclerosis. Based on the available data, this was most consistently observed with the 44 mcg tiw (three 
times a week) treatment group. The results were statistically significant for both time to McDonald MS 
(2005)  and  time  to  CDMS  in  those  patient  categories  previously  considered  by  CHMP  as  ‘high  risk’, 
namely those patients with ≥9 T2 lesions and/or those patients with presence of Gd-enhancing lesions 
at  baseline  and  regardless  of  the  monofocal  or  multifocal  disease  presentation.  From  a  safety 
perspective, the overall safety and tolerability profile of Rebif was as expected and did not lead to any 
new safety concerns.  
In conclusion, the submitted data were considered to support the following indication: 
“Rebif  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  a  single  demyelinating  event  with  an  active 
inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at 
high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1). 
Section 5.1 
... 
For  the  time  being  there  is  no  well  established  definition  of  a  high  risk  patient,  although  a  more 
conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least 
one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the initial 
scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk.” 
The CHMP noted that the MAH is conducting an extension study REFLEXION, a double-blind extension 
of  the  study  27025  to  obtain  long-term  follow-up  data  in  patients  with  clinically  definite  MS  and 
patients  with  a  first  demyelinating  event  at  high  risk  of  converting  to  multiple  sclerosis,  treated  with 
Rebif  New  Formulation.  The  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  this  extension  study  could  provide  additional 
comparative  data  on  the  long-term  efficacy  and  safety  of  both  dosing  regimens  (tiw  and  ow)  and 
recommended that these be submitted for review once available. 
With  respect  to  the  Type  IB  variation  initially  submitted  in  a  group  with  the  Type  II  variation  – 
extension of indication, the CHMP concluded that the approval of the additional pack sizes was linked 
to the approval of the 44 mcg once weekly dosing regimen. Since the MAH decided not to pursue the 
alternative  ow  dosing  regimen,  the  above  mentioned  type  IB  variation  was  withdrawn  at  the  time  of 
response  to  the  Request  for  Supplementary  Information  and  the  evaluation  procedure  was  finalised 
accordingly (see section 6 - Recommendations). 
Assessment report  
Page 32/34
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.I.6 a) 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Extension of indication: Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and sections 1 and 3 of 
the Package Leaflet to include information on a new indication, i.e. treatment of patients with a single 
demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, 
and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis. These 
updates affect the PI of the 44 mcg presentations (pre-filled syringe, pre-filled pen and cartridges) and 
the  PI  of  the  initiation  pack  presentations  (pre-filled  syringe,  pre-filled  pen  and  cartridges).    In 
addition, minor editorial changes were implemented across the SmPC and the Package leaflet, and the 
DDPS  version  number  was  removed  from  Annex  II.  Furthermore,  Annex  II  was  updated  to  introduce 
the  standard  text  regarding  the  risk  management  system.  The  MAH  also  took  the  opportunity  to 
update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II and Package Leaflet. 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  MAH  must  ensure  that  the  system  of  pharmacovigilance  presented  in  Module  1.8.1  of  the 
Marketing Authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market. 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The  MAH  shall  perform  the  pharmacovigilance  activities  detailed  in  the  Pharmacovigilance  Plan,  as 
agreed  in  the  RMP  presented  in  Module  1.8.2  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  and  any  subsequent 
updates of the RMP agreed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). 
As  per  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  Risk  Management  Systems  for  medicinal  products  for  human  use,  the 
updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR). 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
  When  new  information  is  received  that  may  impact  on  the  current  Safety  Specification, 
Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities 
  Within  60  days  of  an  important  (pharmacovigilance  or  risk  minimisation)  milestone  being 
reached 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency 
PSURs 
The MAH will submit PSURs on an annual basis until otherwise specified.

7.  EPAR changes 
The  EPAR  will  be  updated  following  Commission  Decision  for  this  variation.  In  particular  the  EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of indication: Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and sections 1 and 3 of 
the Package Leaflet to include information on a new indication, i.e. treatment of patients with a single 
demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, 
and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis. These 
updates affect the PI of the 44 mcg presentations (pre-filled syringe, pre-filled pen and cartridges) and 
the  PI  of  the  initiation  pack  presentations  (pre-filled  syringe,  pre-filled  pen  and  cartridges).    In 
addition, minor editorial changes were implemented across the SmPC and the Package leaflet and the 
DDPS  version  number  was  removed  from  Annex  II.  Furthermore,  Annex  II  was  updated  to  introduce 
the  standard  text  regarding  the  risk  management  system.  The  MAH  also  took  the  opportunity  to 
update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
Summary 
The revised CHMP variation assessment report will be published as part of the EPAR, following review/ 
deletion of confidential information.

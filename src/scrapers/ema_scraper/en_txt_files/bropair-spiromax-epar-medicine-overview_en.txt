BroPair Spiromax (salmeterol / fluticasone) 
An overview of BroPair Spiromax and why it is authorised in the EU 
What is BroPair Spiromax and what is it used for? 
BroPair Spiromax is a medicine used for the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 
above 12 years of age. It is used in patients whose disease is not adequately controlled despite 
treatment with a combination of a short-acting beta-2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroid. It contains 
the active substances salmeterol and fluticasone. 
How is BroPair Spiromax used? 
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription. It is available as an inhalation powder in an 
inhaler device.  
It comes in two strengths, one containing 12.75 micrograms of salmeterol and 100 micrograms of 
fluticasone and a higher strength (containing 12.75 micrograms of salmeterol and 202 micrograms of 
fluticasone). 
Patients use one inhalation twice a day (one in the morning and one in the evening); the doctor will 
decide which strength is appropriate (and change it when necessary) based on how severe the asthma 
is and how well it has been controlled. Once the asthma is controlled doctors should consider changing 
patients to inhaled corticosteroid alone. 
Patients should be shown how to use the inhaler correctly by a doctor or other healthcare professional. 
The delivered doses for BroPair Spiromax are different from other salmeterol / fluticasone containing 
products. BroPair Spiromax should therefore not be swapped with other salmeterol / fluticasone 
containing inhalers. 
For more information about using BroPair Spiromax, see the package leaflet or contact your doctor or 
pharmacist. 
How does BroPair Spiromax work? 
The two active substances in BroPair Spiromax are well known and are present in several medicines 
used to treat asthma, either alone or in combination with other medicines.

Salmeterol is a long-acting beta-2 agonist. It attaches to beta-2 receptors in the muscles of the 
airways and causes the muscles of the airways to relax and widen, allowing the patient to breathe 
more easily. 
Fluticasone is a corticosteroid. It reduces the activity of the immune system by attaching to receptors 
in various types of immune cells, blocking the release of substances involved in the inflammation 
process. This reduces inflammation in the airways and improves the patient’s breathing. 
What benefits of BroPair Spiromax have been shown in studies? 
Two main studies in 1,375 patients with asthma have shown that BroPair Spiromax is effective at 
improving patients’ FEV1 (the maximum volume of air they can breathe out in one second). 
In the first study, patients treated with BroPair Spiromax (containing 12.75 micrograms of salmeterol 
and 100 micrograms of fluticasone)  for 12 weeks had FEV1 increases of 315 ml, compared with 204 ml 
for patients treated with a comparable dose of inhaled fluticasone, and 53 ml for patients treated with 
placebo. 
In the second study, patients treated with BroPair Spiromax (containing 12.75 micrograms of 
salmeterol and 100 micrograms of fluticasone) had FEV1 increases of 271 ml, compared with 119 ml 
for patients treated with a comparable dose of inhaled fluticasone, and a decrease of 4 ml for patients 
treated with placebo. For the higher strength BroPair Spiromax FEV1 increases were 272 ml, compared 
with 179 ml for patients treated with a comparable dose of inhaled fluticasone. 
What are the risks associated with BroPair Spiromax? 
The most common side effects with BroPair Spiromax (which may affect up to 1 in 10 people) are 
nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat), headache, cough and oral candidiasis (thrush, 
a fungal infection). 
For the full list of side effects and restrictions of BroPair Spiromax, see the package leaflet. 
Why is BroPair Spiromax authorised in the EU? 
BroPair Spiromax improves breathing in patients with asthma. It contains two active substances which 
are well known and already marketed as combination inhalers. The safety profile of BroPair Spiromax 
is considered similar to that of other similar inhaler medicines. The European Medicines Agency decided 
that BroPair Spiromax’s benefits are greater than its risks and it can be authorised for use in the EU. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
BroPair Spiromax? 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of BroPair Spiromax have been included in the summary of product characteristics 
and the package leaflet. 
As for all medicines, data on the use of BroPair Spiromax are continuously monitored. Side effects 
reported with BroPair Spiromax are carefully evaluated and any necessary action taken to protect 
patients.

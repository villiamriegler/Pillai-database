Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Lixiana 
edoxaban 
On 23 April 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Lixiana, 
intended for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adults with atrial fibrillation and for 
treatment and prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The applicant for this 
medicinal product is Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH. 
Lixiana will be available as 15 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg film-coated tablets. The active substance of 
Lixiana is edoxaban, an antithrombotic agent (ATC code: B01). Lixiana is a highly selective, direct and 
reversible inhibitor of factor Xa. Inhibition of factor Xa in the coagulation cascade reduces thrombin 
generation, prolongs clotting time and reduces the risk of thrombus formation. 
The benefits with Lixiana are its ability to:  
• 
• 
reduce the combined risk of stroke and systemic embolic events in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
fibrillation who are at risk of stroke and systemic embolic events. 
treat and reduce the risk of recurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism in patients who 
had acute symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. 
The most common side effects are cutaneous soft tissue haemorrhage (up to 5.9%), epistaxis (up to 
4.7%) and vaginal haemorrhage. Bleeding can occur at any site and may be severe and even fatal. 
Other common adverse reactions for edoxaban were anaemia, rash and abnormal liver function tests.  
The full indication is: “Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular 
atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, 
age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). 
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent

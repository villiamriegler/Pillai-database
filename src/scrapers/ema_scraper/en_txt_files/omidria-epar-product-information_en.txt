4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1 Therapeutic indications 
Omidria is indicated in adults for maintenance of intraoperative mydriasis, prevention of 
intraoperative miosis and reduction of acute postoperative ocular pain in intraocular lens replacement 
surgery. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Omidria must be administered in a controlled surgical setting by a qualified ophthalmological surgeon 
experienced in intraocular lens replacement surgery. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 4.0 mL of Omidria concentrate for solution diluted in 500 mL of irrigation 
solution administered by intraocular irrigation to the affected eye during surgery. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
The elderly population has been studied in clinical studies. No dose adjustment is 
required. Renal or hepatic impairment 
No formal studies have been conducted with Omidria in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. No 
dose adjustment or special considerations are anticipated for patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
(see section 5.2).

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Omidria in children aged below 18 years have not been established. No data 
are available. 
Method of administration 
Intraocular use (after dilution). 
Single use only. 
Omidria has not been evaluated in the the absence of standard preoperative mydriatic and 
anesthetic agents. Preoperative antibiotic, anaesthetics, corticosteroid, mydriatic, and non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) eye drops may be administered at the discretion of the treating 
ophthalmologist. 
Before administering the medicinal product 
Omidria must be diluted into 500 mL of irrigation solution before use. For dilution instructions, see 
section 6.6. 
The Omidria-containing irrigation solution is intended to be used during the surgical procedure in the 
same manner that the standard irrigation solution would be used. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
This medicinal product must be diluted before intraocular use. 
Omidria is indicated for addition to irrigation solution used during intraocular lens 
replacement procedures only. 
Omidria is not indicated for undiluted use, intravitreal injection, general topical ophthalmic use, or 
non-ocular systemic use. 
The safety and efficacy of Omidria have not been evaluated in patients with a history of uveitis, 
iris trauma, or alpha-adrenergic antagonist use. 
The following warnings and precautions related to topical ophthalmic use of phenylephrine 
and ketorolac should be considered with the use of Omidria: 
Cardiovascular reactions 
There have been reports of serious cardiovascular reactions, including ventricular arrhythmias and 
myocardial infarctions, in patients using ophthalmic phenylephrine. These episodes, some fatal, 
have usually occurred in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases. 
Significant elevations in blood pressure have been reported following instillation of topical ocular 
phenylephrine. Anticipated systemic exposure is minimal and transient, however, caution should be 
used in treating patients with poorly controlled hypertension. The risk of blood pressure elevations 
may be increased in patients requiring prolonged surgery. 
Hyperthyroidism and unstable cardiovascular disease should be addressed prior to surgery. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cross-sensitivity 
There is the potential for cross-sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid derivatives, and 
other NSAIDs. There have been reports of bronchospasm or exacerbation of asthma associated with 
the use of ketorolac ophthalmic solution in patients who either have a known hypersensitivity to 
acetylsalicylic acid/NSAIDs, or a past medical history of asthma. Therefore, use Omidria with 
caution in individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these active substances. 
Cardiovascular reactions and cross-sensitivity reactions are known to occur with topical ophthalmic 
use of phenylephrine and ketorolac when used as monotherapy at higher concentration levels than 
present in Omidria. 
The use of Omidria during intraocular lens replacement surgery may cause vision to be temporarily 
affected. (see section 4.7). 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Intraocular metabolic interactions are unlikely because phenylephrine and ketorolac are removed from 
the anterior chamber by irrigation during the surgical procedure and by normal aqueous humour 
circulation postoperatively. The magnitude of the mydriatic effect of Omidria may be altered in 
patients who concurrently receive medicinal products that can affect pupil size, such as opioids 
(miotics) or non-sedating antihistamines (mydriatics). 
Concomitant use of phenylephrine and atropine may enhance pressor effects and induce tachycardia in 
some patients. Phenylephrine may potentiate the cardiovascular depressant effects of some inhalation 
anesthetic medicinal products. In a pharmacokinetic study evaluating Omidria, systemic exposure to 
each of phenylephrine and ketorolac was minimal and transient. Therefore, no interaction is expected. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Omidria is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of phenylephrine hydrochloride and/or ketorolac 
trometamol in pregnant women. Omidria is not recommended during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It  is  unknown  whether  phenylephrine  is  excreted  in  human  milk.  Ketorolac  is  excreted  in  human 
milk  after  systemic  administration.  A  risk  to  the  newborns/infants  cannot  be  excluded.  Omidria 
should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of phenylephrine hydrochloride and/or ketorolac 
trometamol on fertility in humans.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Omidria has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. As vision may be temporarily 
affected following intraocular lens replacement in patients who receive Omidria, patients should be 
advised not to drive or use machines until vision is clear. See section 4.8 for further details regarding 
possible visual disturbances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile of Omidria is based on data from 459 adult patients collected during clinical 
development obtained in randomised controlled studies. Adverse reactions reported in patients 
receiving Omidria were typical postoperative findings and most were mild to moderate in intensity 
and resolved without intervention or any residual effects. The most frequently reported adverse 
reactions were, eye pain (4.8%), anterior chamber inflammation (3.9%), conjunctival hyperaemia 
(2.2%), photophobia (1.7%), corneal oedema (1.3%) and inflammation (1.3%). Each of these same 
findings was reported at a similar frequency in patients receiving placebo. 
Following post-marketing exposure to Omidria, primarily in the Unites States of America (USA), 
there have been very few suspected adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions are a 
small number of cases with corneal oedema which were mostly non-serious and self-limiting. The 
overall safety profile of Omidria on the market is similar to the clinical study experience with this 
medicinal product. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), 
not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of specific adverse reactions 
Cardiovascular reactions and cross-sensitivity reactions are known adverse reactions associated 
with topical ophthalmic use of phenylephrine and ketorolac when used as monotherapy at higher 
concentration levels than present in Omidria. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In case of accidental intracameral injection of the concentrated solution, the anterior chamber should 
be evacuated immediately and irrigated with standard ophthalmological irrigation solution. 
Systemic overdose of phenylephrine may cause a rapid rise in blood pressure. It may also cause 
headache, anxiety, nausea, and vomiting, and ventricular arrhythmias. In the event of phenylephrine 
overdose, prompt injection of a rapidly acting alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, such as phentolamine, 
has been recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, Sympathomimetics excl. antiglaucoma preparations. 
ATC code: S01FB51 
Mechanism of action 
The phenylephrine and ketorolac in Omidria act by distinct mechanisms, to maintain intraoperative 
mydriasis, to prevent intraoperative miosis, and to reduce acute postoperative pain. 
Phenylephrine is an α1-adrenergic receptor agonist and acts as a mydriatic agent by contracting the 
radial muscle of the iris, dilating the pupil with little or no cycloplegia. Vasoconstriction occurs in the 
conjunctival circulation and in other ocular vessels to the extent that they are exposed to medicinal 
product. 
Ketorolac is an NSAID that inhibits both cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX1 and COX2), reducing 
pain and inflammation by decreasing tissue concentrations of prostaglandins resulting from surgical 
trauma. Ketorolac, by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis secondary to ocular surgical insult or direct 
mechanical stimulation of the iris, may also contribute to the prevention of surgically induced miosis. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of Omidria was evaluated in two Phase 3, randomised, multicentre, double-
masked, placebo-controlled clinical studies in 808 adult patients undergoing intraocular lens 
replacement. The population in the studies was 26 to 90 years of age (59% female, 41% male; 
80% white, 12% black and 8% other race). Nineteen percent of cataracts were LOCS II Nuclear Grade 
2 or 3. Fifty-three percent of patients had brown irides, 28% had blue irides, and 19% had irides of 
other colours. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients were randomised to either Omidria or placebo (1:1). All patients were treated with 
standardised preoperative topical mydriatic and anaesthetic agents. Pupil diameter was measured 
throughout the surgical procedure. Postoperative pain was evaluated by a self-administered 0-100 
mm visual analogue scale (VAS). 
Statistical tests for the change from baseline in pupil diameter (mm) during surgery were carried out 
with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted for the randomisation strata. In Study 1, the 
CMH weighted mean difference (Omidria – placebo) in the mean area under the curve (AUC) was 
0.58 mm [95% confidence interval: 0.48, 0.68] (P < 0.0001). In Study 2, the CMH weighted mean 
difference (Omidria – placebo) in the mean AUC was 0.59 mm [95% confidence interval: 0.49, 0.69] 
(P < 0.0001). 
Mydriasis was maintained in the Omidria-treated groups, while the placebo-treated 
groups experienced progressive constriction of the pupil (see Figure 1.).

Figure 1. Intraoperative pupil diameter (mm) change from baseline 
Prevention of miosis was confirmed in a categorical analysis. In Study 1, only 4% of patients in the 
Omidria group compared to 23% of patients in the placebo group had a pupil diameter < 6 mm at the 
time of cortical clean-up, and 3% of patients in the Omidria group compared to 28% of patients in the 
placebo group had a pupil constriction ≥2.5 mm (P < 0.0001 in both instances, Chi-Square test). In 
Study 2, only 4% of patients in the Omidria group compared to 23% of patients in the placebo group 
had a pupil diameter < 6 mm at cortical clean-up, and 1% of patients in the Omidria group compared

Histologic examination in non-clinical toxicology studies demonstrated no treatment-related effects 
on the cornea and, in clinical studies with Omidria, no detrimental effects were observed on best-
corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Endothelial cell counts were not conducted during the clinical 
studies. 
Paediatric Population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies 
with Omidria in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in lens therapeutic procedures 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In a pharmacokinetic study evaluating Omidria, systemic exposure to both phenylephrine and 
ketorolac was minimal and transient.

Absorption 
Detectable phenylephrine plasma concentrations were observed in only one of 14 patients. The 
maximum concentration observed in this patient was 1.7 ng/mL, occurring after instillation of topical 
preoperative phenylephrine drops and prior to exposure to Omidria. 
Ketorolac plasma concentrations were detected in 11 of 14 patients. The maximum ketorolac 
concentration seen was 4.2 ng/mL. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reported in the literature for the individual components in Omidria revealed no 
special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose 
toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and development. 
A single-dose toxicology study was conducted in African green monkeys exposed to ocular irrigation 
solutions containing the combination of phenylehphrine and ketorolac used during lens replacement 
surgery. No drug-related adverse reactions or pathological findings were observed, with combinations 
of phenylephrine and ketorolac in irrigation solution administered at concentrations up to 7200 µM 
phenylephrine and 900 µM ketorolac. These concentrations are over 10-fold higher than the 
concentration of each agent administered clinically in patients receiving Omidria.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Omidria is and what it is used for 
Omidria is a medicine used during surgery on the eye. It contains the active substances phenylephrine 
and ketorolac. Phenylephrine acts to keep the pupil dilated (widened). Ketorolac is a painkiller that 
belongs to the group called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS); it also helps stop the 
pupil from contracting (getting smaller). 
Omidria is used in adults to rinse the eye during surgery to implant a new lens (part of the eye that 
focuses light passing through the pupil to allow you to see clearly). This is known as intraocular lens 
replacement. The medicine is used to keep the pupil dilated (widened) during surgery and to reduce 
eye pain after the procedure. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Omidria 
Do not use Omidria: 
- 
if you are allergic to phenylephrine or ketorolac or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6); 
if you have an eye condition called narrow-angle glaucoma. 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Omidria if you: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
have heart disease; 
have raised blood pressure; 
have overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism); 
are allergic to acetylsalicylic acid or other painkillers called non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); 
have asthma. 
- 
If any of the above applies to you, please inform your doctor. Your doctor will decide if Omidria 
is suitable for you. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children and adolescents 
Omidria should not be used in children and adolescents aged below 18 years as it has not been studied 
in these groups. 
Other medicines and Omidria 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
- 
- 
- 
Especially, tell your doctor if you are using a medication to dilate (widen) the pupil of the eye 
(e.g., atropine or homatropine). Using this type of medication at the same time as Omidria 
may increase blood pressure and cause the heart to beat faster in some patients. 
Also tell your doctor if you are taking an opioid pain reliever or a non-drowsy 
antihistamine. These medications, when taken at the same time as Omidria, can change how 
effectively Omidria is able to dilate (widen) your pupil for surgery. 
One of the active substances in Omidria can react with several types of anaesthetics. Your 
doctor will know about this. If your eye surgery will involve general anaesthesia, talk to your 
doctor about this. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Omidria should not be used during pregnancy. If you are able to become pregnant, you should be 
using suitable contraception before you are given Omidria. 
Omidria should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
This medicine has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. As your vision may be 
affected, you should not drive or use machines until your vision has cleared. This may be several hours 
up to about a day, depending on other medications your doctor may use during surgery. 
3. 
How Omidria is used 
Omidria will be given to you in a hospital or clinic by a qualified doctor or surgeon who is 
specialised in eye surgery. 
Omidria is used as a solution to rinse the eye (irrigation solution) during surgery to replace the lens. 
If you are given more Omidria than you should have been 
Phenylephrine, one of the active substances of Omidria, may cause a rapid rise in blood pressure if 
too much is given and enough passes into the blood to affect other parts of the body. It may also cause 
headache, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, and abnormal rapid heart rhythm. 
Your doctor will monitor you for any signs or symptoms of side effects and will treat them 
if necessary. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

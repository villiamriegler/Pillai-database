As part of this application, the MAH proposed to revise the

Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, 
the MAH took the opportunity to update the ATC

EVICEL product information with instructions regarding the 
use of additional EVICEL Fibrin Sealant accessory tips; a 4 
cm Control Tip, a 45 cm tip, and an Airless Spray 
Accessory. Detailed instructions for use of these accessory

tips have not been included in the Product Information as it 
should be provided together with the devices. However, for 
the proposed 45 cm flexible tip, the CHMP was of the view 
that distance and pressure recommendations should be 
included in the Product Information. Under the prerequisite 
of compliance with distance requirements, CHMP 
considered the 45 cm flexible accessory tip acceptable. It 
can be used in both open and laparoscopic procedures, but 
is especially designed for the use in laparoscopic 
procedures. For open surgery a pressure range of 1.4 – 1.7 
bar is proposed, however, the range appears unnecessarily 
high for laparoscopic procedures. Following life-threatening 
events of air/gas embolism the spray pressure used in 
laparoscopic procedures was limited to a maximum of 1.4 
bar (Article 20 referral). No clinically relevant advantage 
could be demonstrated for 1.7 bar over 1.4 bar for the 
small distances used within laparoscopic procedures. On 
the other hand a pressure of 1.0 bar cannot produce a 
sufficient mixing of the two sealant components. It is 
therefore recommended to use the 45 cm flexible tip in 
laparoscopic procedures at a spray gas pressure of 1.4 bar. 
The product information has been revised accordingly.

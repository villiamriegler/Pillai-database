Annex II 
patient randomized, the final OS analysis was performed 
(HER2CLIMB), listed as a PAES in the Annex II of the 
Product Information. This is a phase 2 randomized, 
double-blinded, controlled study of tucatinib vs. 
placebo in combination with capecitabine and 
trastuzumab in patients with pretreated unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast 
based on 370 events, which corresponded to a median 
follow-up of 29.6 months. Median OS was 24.7 months 
(95% CI: 21.6, 28.9) for patients on the tucatinib + 
trastuzumab + capecitabine arm compared to 19.2 months 
(95% CI: 16.4, 21.4) for patients on the placebo + 
trastuzumab + capecitabine arm (HR = 0.725; 95% CI: 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

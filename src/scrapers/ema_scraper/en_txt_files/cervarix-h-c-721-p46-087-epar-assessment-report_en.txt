Treatment groups: 3 parallel groups in 2 age strata (9-14 or 15-25 years of age)  
• 
• 
• 
Group (0,6): females aged 9-14 years receiving 2 doses of Cervarix at Day 0 and at Month 6, 
respectively.

respectively.  
Group (0,1,6): females aged 15-25 years receiving 3 doses of Cervarix at Day 0, at Month 1 
and at Month 6, respectively.  
To ensure equal distribution of the population, enrolment was stratified by age as follows:  
•  9-14 years: stratification into 9-11 years (~50%) and 12-14 years (~50%).  
•  15-25 years: stratification into 15-19 years (~50%) and 20-25 years (~50%).  
If non-inferiority of the 2-dose schedule (0, 6 months) versus the standard 3-dose schedule (0, 1, 6 
months) is not demonstrated 1 month after the last dose of study vaccine or at any further timepoint, 
a 3rd vaccine dose will be offered to the subjects of Group (0,6) at the end of the study, according to 
local prescribing information.  
If non-inferiority of the 2-dose schedule (0, 12 months) versus the standard 3-dose schedule (0, 1, 6 
months) is not demonstrated 1 month after the last dose of study vaccine or at any further timepoint, 
a 3rd vaccine dose will be offered to the subjects of Group (0,12) at the end of the study, according to 
local prescribing information.

Statistical evaluation  
1.Within groups assessment 
PBNA (pseudovirion-based neutralization assay) and ELISA 
For each group at each time point for which a blood sample result was available, the following 
analyses were conducted:  
•  Seroconversion and seropositivity rates for each antigen (with exact 95% CI) per pre-
vaccination status.  
•  GMTs with 95% CI and range of antibody titres were tabulated for antibodies for each antigen 
per pre-vaccination status.  
• 
The distribution of antibody titres for each antigen were displayed using reverse cumulative 
distribution curves for the sub-cohort of initially seronegative subjects.  
Cellular-mediated immunity  
1.CD4+/CD8+ T-cell response by ICS (IntraCellular Cytokine Staining)  
Frequency of cytokines-positive (d-CD40L, d-IL2, d-TNFα, d-IFNγ or all doubles) CD4+ or CD8+ T 
cells, for each stimulant (HPV-16 and HPV-18 & HPV-31 and HPV-45) at each time point (at Day 0, 
Months 7, 12, 24 and 36 [for subjects having received their last vaccine dose at Month 6] or at Day 0, 
Months 13, 18 and 36 [for subjects having received their last vaccine dose at Month 12]) were 
summarised for each group by the number of values (N), the number of missing values, minimum, 1st 
quartile, median, 3rd quartile, maximum and geometric mean (Gmean). 
Threshold was determined on the basis of 95th percentile of frequency of CD4+ or CD8+ all doubles 
stimulated by HPV-16 or HPV-18 antigen at Month 0 for HPV seronegative subjects.

2. B-cell response  
Frequencies of memory B-cells for each stimulant (HPV-16 and HPV-18 & HPV-31 and HPV-45) at each 
time point (at Day 0, Months 7, 12, 24 and 36 [for subjects having received their last vaccine dose at 
Month 6] or at Day 0, Months 13, 18 and 36 [for subjects having received their last vaccine dose at 
Month 12]) were summarised for each group by the number of values (N), the number of missing 
values, minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile, maximum and geometric mean (G-mean). Values 
of 0 were given an arbitrary value of 1 for the purpose of geometric mean calculation. 
2.Inferential analysis : between-group assessment  
Between-group comparisons were performed in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. 
• 
For each HPV antigen, the upper limit (UL) of the 2-sided standardised asymptotic  
95% CI of the difference between the percentage of seroconverted subjects in the 3- 
dose schedule (15-25 year old group) minus the percentage of seroconverted subjects 
in the 2-dose schedule (9-14 year old group) was computed. 
Non-inferiority of HPV (0,6) schedule to HPV (0,1,6) schedule with respect to anti- 
HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 was demonstrated if the upper limits of these 95% CIs was 
below the pre-defined clinical limit of 5%. 
• 
If non-inferiority of HPV (0,6) schedule to HPV (0,1,6) schedule with respect to 
anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 seroconversion rates was reached, the 2-sided 95% 
CIs of GMT ratios was computed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model on 
the log10 transformation of the titres at each timepoint. The ANOVA model included 
the vaccine group as fixed effect. 
Non-inferiority of HPV (0,6) schedule to HPV (0,1,6) schedule with respect to anti- 
HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 was demonstrated if the upper limits of these 95% CIs 
wass below the pre-defined clinical limit of 2. 
Those 2 sequential steps was/ will be performed 1 month after the last dose of study vaccine (primary 
objective) and 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 30 months after the last dose of study vaccine. 
Similarly, non-inferiority testing would be performed between HPV (0, 12) schedule vs. HPV (0, 1, 6) 
schedule and between HPV (0, 12) schedule vs. HPV (0, 6) schedule 1 month, 6 months and 12 
months after the last dose of study vaccine. 
In the secondary active Epoch, the secondary objectives were to demonstrate non-inferiority in initially 
seronegative subjects in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity based on the following criteria:

Anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibody response 
1.HPV-16/18 serostatus at baseline 
The HPV-16/18 serostatus at baseline as measured by ELISA in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity is 
presented in Table 11. 
The proportion of subjects initially seropositive for both HPV-16 and HPV-18 was 1.7% and 1.3% in the 
youngest age group (9-14 years) receiving 2 doses of HPV-16/18 vaccine (Groups (0,6) and (0,12), 
respectively) and 5.2% in the older age group (15-25 years) receiving 3 doses of HPV-16/18 vaccine 
(Group (0,1,6)).  
The majority of subjects was initially seronegative for both HPV-16 and HPV-18, i.e., 83.8% in Group 
(0,6), 85.9% in Group (0,12) and 75.4% in (Group (0,1,6). In Group (0,6), 8% and 6.5% of subjects 
were seropositive for only HPV-16 and only HPV-18, respectively. In Group (0,12), 8.7% and 4.1% of 
subjects were seropositive for only HPV-16 and only HPV-18, respectively. In Group (0,1,6), 13.2% 
and 6.1% of subjects were seropositive for only HPV-16 and only HPV-18, respectively. 
No trend for a difference in initial serostatus by country was observed across the different age strata.

Antibody persistence up to Month36 
In Study HPV-070, up to Month 36, the kinetics of the antibody response to HPV-16 and HPV-18 in the 
9-14 year old girls who received 2 doses of Cervarix at 0,6 months and in the 15-25 year old who 
received the standard 3-dose schedule at 0,1,6 months followed a similar pattern, i.e. after an initial 
peak response, a decline in antibody titers is observed that reached a plateau phase between Month 18 
and Month 36.

CHMP’s comment 
Higher antibody titers are reached for HPV-16 than for HPV-18. 
All initially seronegative subjects remained seroconverted for antibodies against HPV-16 (ELISA). 
All initially seronegative subjects remained seroconverted for antibodies against HPV-18 (ELISA) 
except for one subject each in group (0,6) and (0,1,6). 
GMT’s were broadly comparable between initially seronegative and seropositive subjects, with 
overlapping 95%CI. In the (0,6) group, HPV-18 titers were higher in the S+ subjects compared to 
the S- subjects. 
At all time points, a wide range was observed between the minimum and maximum GMT’s. 
The antibody kinetics are similar for the three schedules, with a slightly better antibody persistence 
in the (0,12) schedule.

this subset were the same subjects as in the sub-cohort for CMI testing. 
At Month24 
At Month 24, all (100%) of the initially seronegative subjects in all three groups [group (0,6), group 
(0,12) and group (0,1,6)] had seroconverted for anti-HPV-16 neutralising antibodies, and at least 
97.8% of the initially seronegative subjects had seroconverted for anti-HPV-18 neutralising antibodies 
when measured by PBNA (Table 14, Table 15).

Safety data from study HPV-008 have extensively been discussed in previously approved variations II-
11 (event-driven final analysis) and II-22 (Month 48 analysis, end of the study) and are not the object 
of the current variation application.  
Safety is evaluated in this final Study report HPV-070 up to Month 36. 
Safety results from Study HPV-070 23 month after the last vaccination in the 2-dose [Group (0,12)] 
and up to Month 36 (30 months after the last vaccination) in the 2-dose [Group (0,6)] and the 3-dose 
[Group (0,1,6)] were presented and discussed by the MAH. 
The analysis of safety presented was performed on the Total Vaccinated Cohort TVC (primary 
analysis). The primary analysis was complemented by an analysis based on the According-To-Protocol 
ATP cohort for safety which is presented in the HPV-070 (Month 36) Clinical Study Report CSR. 
In Study HPV-070, the following safety parameters were assessed at months 24 and 36 : 
•  Serious adverse events (SAEs) (up to Month 36) 
•  Medically significant conditions (up to Month 36) 
• 
• 
Potential immune-mediated diseases (up to Mo 36) 
Pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes (up to Mo 36) 
2.5.2.  Results 
1.Serious adverse events and deaths 
No fatal SAEs were reported up to the Follow-up 2 & 3 Epoch (Day 0 to Month 24/36) of Study HPV-
070.  
Up to mo 13, 47 non-fatal SAEs were reported for 38 subjects (12 (2.2%) subjects in [Group (0,6)], 
11 (2.7%) subjects in [Group (0,12)] and 15 (3.1%) subjects (3.1%) in [Group (0,1,6)].None of these 
SAEs were considered by the investigator to have a possible causal relationship to vaccination. All SAEs 
resolved without sequelae except for 2 events (1 event of autoimmune thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes 
mellitus), reported for one same subject in [Group (0,6)] during the primary epoch, which were not 
recovered/resolved.  
During the follow-up period up to Month 24 (TVC), 53 subjects reported at least one SAE (none were 
fatal), and 326 subjects reported at least one medically significant conditions (MSCs). During the 
follow-up period up from Month 18 to Month 24 (Month 24 TVC), 16 subjects reported at least one SAE 
(none were fatal), and 81 subjects reported at least one MSC. 
One SAE [systemic lupus erythematosus] reported by one subject (last visit final diagnosis was SLE, 
the sponsor adjusted pIMD) in group[0,12] was considered by the investigator as causally related to 
vaccination.  The SAE was not recovered/resolved at the Month 36 time point. None of the other SAEs 
were considered to be causally related to vaccination by the investigator.

Narrative: This 10-year-old female subject was enrolled in an open label study titled A Phase IIIb 
openlabel,randomised, multi-centre primary immunization study to evaluate the immunogenicity and 
safety of GSK Biologicals’ HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine when administered intramuscularly according to 
alternative 2-dose schedules in 9 - 14 year old healthy females compared to the standard 3-dose schedule 
for GSK Biologicals’ HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine in 15 - 25 year old healthy females.The subject 
received the 1st dose of Human papilloma type 16 + 18 vaccine 
(intramuscular) for prophylaxis. 
Two hundreds and sixty four days after receiving Human papilloma type 16 + 18 vaccine the subject 
developed 
severe - grade 3 systemic lupus erythematosus. Serious criteria included GSK medically significant and 
clinically significant/intervention required. The subject was treated with methotrexate and folic acid. 
Human papilloma type 16 + 18 vaccine was interrupted. The outcome of systemic lupus erythematosus 
was not recovered/not resolved. 
The investigator considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the systemic lupus erythematosus 
may have been caused by Human papilloma type 16 + 18 vaccine.

fatal), and 374 subjects reported at least one MSC. During the follow-up period up from Month 24 to 
Month 36 (Month 36 TVC), 21 subjects reported at least one SAE (none were fatal), and 114 subjects 
reported at least one MSC. 
2. Other significant adverse events 
2.1. Medically significant conditions (MSCs) 
During the primary active epoch (Day 0 to Month 7) of Study HPV-070, 107 MSCs were reported for 75 
(13.6%) subjects in Group (0,6) and 129 MSCs were reported for 96 (19.9%) subjects in Group 
(0,1,6). Except for bronchitis and cystitis, which were each reported in 5 (1.0%) subjects in Group 
(0,1,6), no MSCs occurred in more than 4 (<1%) subjects in any group. 
Up to the secondary active epoch, 489 MSCs were reported for 284 subjects: 99 (18.0%) subjects in 
[Group (0,6)], 61 (11.4%) subjects in [Group (0,12)] and 124 (25.7%) subjects in [Group (0,1,6)].

During the primary active epoch (Day 0 to Month 7) of Study HPV-070, 3 pIMDs (autoimmune 
thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes mellitus and Raynaud’s phenomenon) were reported for 2 (0.4%) subjects 
in Group (0,6) and 1 pIMD (VIIth nerve paralysis) was reported for 1 (0.2%) subject in Group (0,1,6). 
Autoimmune thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes mellitus reported in one subject of Group (0,6) were also 
reported as SAEs. VIIth nerve paralysis reported in one subject in Group (0,1,6) was considered by the 
investigator to have a possible causal relationship to vaccination. 
Up to the secondary active epoch, 8 pIMDS were reported for 6 subjects (2 subjects in each group). 
Except for one (VIIth nerve paralysis), none of the pIMDS had resolved by the Month 13 data lock 
point. None of the 8 pIMDS, except one, were considered by the investigator to have a possible causal 
relationship to vaccination. VIIth nerve paralysis, a non-serious pIMD reported for 1 subject (0.2%) in 
[Group (0,1,6)], was considered by the investigator to have a possible causal relationship to 
vaccination and had resolved without sequelae. Note that autoimmune thyroiditis and type I diabetes 
mellitus reported for one subject in [Group (0,6)] were also reported as SAEs. 
Reports of the pIMDs are presented below except the SLE case. 
•  Type 1 diabetes mellitus and Autoimmune thyroiditis 
Serious Events: Type 1 diabetes mellitus and Autoimmune thyroiditis 
Narrative: This female subject was enrolled in the prophylactic open study 114700 (HPV-070). 
She received the 1st dose of Human papillomavirus type 16 and 18 vaccine (HPV). 
Two months after the 1st dose of HPV 16-18, 
this 14-year-old subject developed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and Hashimoto thyreoiditis. The 
subject was hospitalised. The subject was treated with dextrose + electrolytes + insulin, human insulin 
and insulin. The events were unresolved at time of reporting. The investigator considered that there was 
no reasonable possibility that the insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and Hashimoto thyreoiditis may 
have been caused by HPV 16-18. 
Investigator Comments: 
Three months after the 1st dose blood exams were performed due to polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia and 
weight 
loss. Symptoms started about one month before. The exams showed hyperglycemia (glucose: 289 mg/dL) 
and ketonuria. The subject was hospitalized, and discharged 
with diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus Insulin-Dependent and Hashimoto Thyroiditis. The subject was 
discharged in therapy with Insulin in glycemic control. During hospitalization a goiter and positivity of 
Antibody anti-TPO were observed, so a thyroid echography was performed that showed inhomogeneity 
echostructural and pseudonodular lesion. No end date of SAEs are expected since they are chronic 
diseases; there is no family history of autoimmune disease; subject did not have any medical history or 
medical condition that could have contributed to the SAEs 
This case contains two events assessed by the investigator as serious possible immune mediated 
disorders (pIMD). 
•  Autoimmune thyroiditis 
Non-Serious Events: Autoimmune thyroiditis 
Narrative: This female subject was enrolled in the prophylactic open study 114700 (HPV-070). 
She received the 1st and 2nd dose of Human papillomavirus type 16 and 18 vaccine (HPV). 
Seven months after the 1st dose of HPV 16-18, this 15-year-old subject developed 
hashimoto thyreoiditis. The event was unresolved at time of reporting. The investigator considered that 
there was no reasonable possibility that the hashimoto thyreoiditis may have been caused by HPV 16-18. 
Investigator Comments: 
Two months after the second dose subject performed TSH (2.3) AbTG (16) TPO:274, she was diagnosed 
with Hashimoto 
Thyroiditis with preserced thyroid functions. No other symptoms, no familiar history, no concomitant 
medications/diseases that could have concurred to the pathology. No therapy given for the moment. 
Additional information received: 
thyroid tests were performed since subject had dysmenorrea, hence the request to perform tests. 
Additional information received: 
the start date (1st signs and symptoms) was 6 months after the 1st dose. 
This case contains an event assessed by the investigator as a non-serious possible immune mediated 
disorder (pIMD).

•  VIIth nerve paralysis 
Non-Serious Events: VIIth nerve paralysis 
Narrative: This female subject was enrolled in the prophylactic open study 114700 (HPV-070). 
She received the 1st dose of Human papillomavirus type 16 and 18 vaccine (HPV). 
Eighteen days after the 1st dose of HPV 16-18, this 21-year-old subject developed Bell's paralysis. The 
subject was treated with betamethasone, pantoprazole, Amoxicillin + clavulanate potassium, thioctic acid 
and ketoprofen. The event resolved the same month. The investigator considered that there was a 
reasonable possibility that the bell's paralysis may have been caused by HPV 16-18. 
Investigator Comments: 
The month she received the 1st dose the patient started to feel otalgia at the left ear and weakness in 
correspondance of the 
left side of the forehead, of the eyelid and of the mouth. The day after this weakness became worse. She 
wasn t able to move the left side of the mouth and of the forehead and to close the left eye. She was 
visited by her physician that prescribed her one injection of betametasone (4mg), and an oral therapy of 
betametasone for two days (5mg/day). She didn t start the oral therapy but she continued with 
betametasone injection for other 5 days, she also started amoxicillin-clavulanate and alpha lipoic acid. To 
treat the otalgia the physician prescribed her oral ketoprofene 25mg. The same month of the 1st dose 
resolution of the otalgia. The next days improvement of the palsy. 
The month of the 1st dose she had a neurologic visit that confirmed the diagnosis and prescribed to stop 
the therapies. The month of the 1st dose resolution of the palsy. She didn t do blood exam, CSF analysis or 
instrumental 
investigations (MRI, EMG,CT). I visited the patient the month after the 1st dose and the paralisis was 
completely resolved. We consider the AE only temporarily linked to the vaccine administration. No history 
of demyelinating diseases, immunomediated diseases, autoimmune diseases; no similar symptoms in the 
past; no history of head trauma or cranial tumors; she doesn' t live in a region with endemic lyme disease; 
no documentated recent viral infection but the patient refers otalgy as symptom preceding the palsy. No 
family history of similar or other immunomediated/autoimmune disorder. 
Additional information received: 
The event didn't occur after next doses. 
This case contains an event assessed by the investigator as a non-serious possible immune mediated 
disorder (pIMD). 
Unlikely as event did not reoccur after next doses (confirmation needed).  
Withdrawals due to adverse events /serious adverse events: 
There was one withdrawal due to a non-serious adverse event in the group (0,12) at Month 12 (this 
subject was diagnosed with coeliac disease). There were no additional withdrawals due to SAEs during 
the course of the study. 
5. Pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes 
During the primary active epoch (Day 0 to Month 7), a total of 9 pregnancies were reported in Group 
(0,1,6). Seven (77.8%) of these pregnancies were ongoing at the time of the Month 7 data lock point. 
One (11.1%) subject underwent an elective termination of the pregnancy and one (11.1%) subject 
had an ectopic pregnancy. 
A total of 25 pregnancies were reported (1 in [Group (0,12)] and 24 in [Group (0,1,6)]) during the 
secondary  active epoch (Day 0 to Month 13). Four (16.7%) of these pregnancies were ongoing at the 
time of the Month 13 data lock point. Eighteen (1 in [Group (0,12)] and 17 in [Group (0,1,6)] 
pregnancies resulted in a live infant with no apparent congenital anomaly. One (4.2%) subject had an 
ectopic pregnancy, one (4.2%) subject underwent an elective termination with no apparent congenital 
anomaly and one (4.2%) subject had a still birth with no apparent congenital anomaly, all in [Group 
(0,1,6)]. 
A total of 36 pregnancies were reported (TVC), [one pregnancy each in groups (0,6) and (0,12), and 
34 in group (0,1,6)] up to Month 36. Of these, 32 pregnancies resulted in a live infant with no 
apparent congenital anomaly. There was one ectopic pregnancy, two elective terminations and one

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Efficacy 
The purpose of this study HPV-070 was to provide phase III confirmatory immunobridging data to 
support reduced 2-doses schedules (0, 5-13 months) in females aged 9-14 years.  
In the follow-up epochs up to 30 months post-vaccination, non-inferiority of immune responses to both 
HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens was demonstrated at Month 24 and Month 36 when Cervarix was 
administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0,12 months in 9-14 year old females, compared to 
the administration according to a 2-dose schedule at 0,6 months in 9-14 year old females and 
according to the standard 3-dose schedule at 0,1,6 months in 15-25 year old females.  
The clinical relevance of some observed immunological differences between the three investigated 
schedules, such as the slightly higher plateau in terms of antibody titers for the (0,12) schedule, 
remains unknown. 
Although there is no immunological correlate of protection, it is believed (and demonstrated in animal 
models) that protection against oncogenic HPV infection in humans is mainly based on the presence of 
neutralizing antibodies as well as on cell-mediated immunity. If the responses are comparable between 
the reduced-dose schedule in the target population (9-14 years old girls) and the standard schedule in 
the population where clinical protection was demonstrated in previous clinical studies or in 
epidemiological surveillance, it is reasonable to conclude that Cervarix will confer a clinical protection 
that is comparable with the standard schedule.  
All initially seronegative subjects in group (0,6), group (0,1,6) and group (0,12) had seroconverted for 
anti-HPV-16 neutralising antibodies and at least 97.8% of the initially seronegative subjects had 
seroconverted for anti-HPV-18 neutralising antibodies when measured by PBNA at Month 24. All 
initially seronegative subjects in the three groups had seroconverted for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 
neutralising antibodies at Month 36. Although antibody levels are slowly declining, they remain well 
above the threshold conferred by natural infection and reach a plateau, conform earlier data.

The cell-mediated immunity was demonstrated by measurable CD4+ T cell responses which were 
maintained up to Month 36 for HPV-16/18/31/45. Memory B cell responses were maintained up to 
Month 36 for the vaccine HPV-types HPV-16/18.  
Safety 
In general, Cervarix administered at different schedules (0,6- months or 0,12-months in 9-14 year old 
healthy females or 0,1,6-months in 15-25 year old healthy females) had an acceptable safety profile in 
all groups in the follow-up period up to Month 36. No new safety information was collected in study 
HPV-070 during the follow up period of 36 months, the occurrence of adverse reactions is in line with 
the current information in the SmPC. One SAE [systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)] reported by one 
subject in group[0,12] was considered by the investigator as causally related to vaccination.  The SAE 
was not recovered/resolved at the Month 36 time point. None of the other SAEs were considered to be 
causally related to vaccination by the investigator.  
Although recent results from pre-licensure clinical trials and current Post Marketing Surveillance data 
suggest that Cervarix has a clinically acceptable safety profile and is generally well tolerated, there 
remains a potential (theoretical) concern that Cervarix, and adjuvanted vaccines in general, might be 
associated with an excess risk of new onset of autoimmune diseases such as SLE. Autoimmune 
Diseases are reported in ongoing clinical trials with Cervarix. They are reported in ongoing clinical trials 
when they meet the criteria for SUSARS (Suspected, Unexpected, Serious Adverse Reactions) and are 
systematically included for review in the context of Cervarix Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs).  
According to the latest PSUR, the cumulative data evaluated so far remains inconclusive to determine 
any potential pathogenic link between the vaccine and autoimmune diseases. The low reporting rates 
of autoimmune diseases combined with a background incidence in the population complicate causality 
assessment of such events to vaccination. From the cases reported in spontaneous reporting (passive 
surveillance), VIIth nerve paralysis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Guillain Barré Syndrome 
(GBS) were the most frequently reported pIMDs. 
This SLE case which was assessed as causally related to vaccination should be further discussed by the 
MAH. Careful assessment of the medical and family history to identify potential risk factors is important 
in determining possible causes or triggers of the illness. In many of the cases reported as reviewed, 
confirmatory diagnostic information and/or relevant family and medical histories were not available. 
Hence, assessment of potential causality with vaccination could not be performed. The MAH is 
requested to further discuss the clinical history and the rationale of the diagnosis of this event 
assessed as causally related to vaccination. In this context, the MAH is invited to bring together 
information concerning SLE from individual case reviews, aggregate assessments of case reports from 
clinical trials and from the post-marketing settings, post-marketing observational safety studies. 
It is important to note that women with SLE present higher risk of development HPV diseases. SLE 
predominantly affects women of reproductive age, that is the same group where the occurrence of HPV 
infection is increased. As the immune system of SLE patients is abnormal, the clearance of the virus is 
impaired. The result is the persistence of HPV virus in the cervix of SLE patients more often than in 
healthy women, what leads to higher prevalence of cervical dysplasia and cancer in SLE female 
population.Non-live HPV vaccines are safe and able to produce a protective response even in patients 
with autoimmune diseases (Grein et al. HPV infection and vaccination in Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus patients: what we really should know Pediatric Rheumatology (2016) 14:12. DOI 
10.1186/s12969-016-0072-x). 
Recently, the results of the EPI-HPV-040 observational cohort study done in the UK became available 
(Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000721/II/69). No evidence of increased risk was observed for the co-

primary objectives, including neuroinflammatory/ophthalmic autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis, 
transverse myelitis, optic neuritis, GBS and its variants, ADEM and its specific variants, autoimmune 
peripheral neuropathies and plexopathies and autoimmune uveitis). Higher risk was observed in 
exposed female vs non-exposed female cohort, [Relative risk (RR) 3.75; 95%CI: 3.25-11.3] for 
autoimmune thyroiditis (secondary objective). The risk became non-significant when all cases 
(Confirmed+Non-Confirmed, according to the study definition) are considered for calculation (RR 1.45; 
95%CI: 0.79-2.64) (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000721/II/69).This finding is currently under 
investigation. 
In France,  a recent study based on a cohort of more than 2 million girls covered by the national health 
insurance general scheme, aged between 13 and 16 years, followed from 2008 to 2013, did not 
demonstrate any global increase of the risk of autoimmune disease among girls who had received at 
least one dose of HPV vaccine compared to unvaccinated girls. This overall result is in line with the 
data of the literature concerning the association between HPV vaccination and the risk of autoimmune 
diseases. A significant association with HPV vaccination was found for 2 of the 14 events studied, IBD 
and GBS.This association was particularly strong for Guillain Barré Syndrome GBS. As this is the first 
pharmaco-epidemiological study to suggest an association between HPV vaccination and these two 
autoimmune diseases, these results therefore need to be confirmed. HPV vaccines and risk of 
autoimmune disease: pharmaco-epidemiological study, Final report, September 2015, ANSM, France

Hpv2_Rapport_Septembre-2015.pdf 
Concerning Cervarix exposure during pregnancy risks, the RMP also proposes to generate further data 
based upon the results of a subgroup analysis of pre-licensure clinical trial data suggesting a numerical 
imbalance in spontaneous abortions among Cervarix recipients whose pregnancies occurred around the 
time of vaccination (defined as the last menstrual period [LMP] occurring 30 days before until 45 days 
after vaccination), compared to control subjects. Cervarix is not recommended for use in pregnancy, 
because safety has not been established in pregnant women; however, unintended exposure prior to 
the onset of pregnancy or during pregnancy is possible in the population recommended for vaccination. 
Pregnancies and their outcomes are being closely monitored in ongoing clinical trials and post-
marketing setting (i.e. through spontaneous reporting and post marketing surveillance study including 
Pregnancy Exposure Registry established in the US and in the UK). Results from the EPI-HPV-018 PASS 
study have become available in 2015. 
Apart from the above, GSK has not identified any new important risks that could be associated with the 
use of Cervarix in ongoing clinical trials and in post-marketing surveillance. Important safety concerns 
for Cervarix, which are included in the RMP are listed in Table 3.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The Article 46 paediatric submission is considered not fulfilled, and further regulatory action is needed. 
The provided data do not cause major concern regarding efficacy or safety of Cervarix but there needs 
to be additional clarifications concerning safety concern related to the Severe - grade 3 systemic lupus 
erythematosus reported case. 
Meanwhile, the benefit/risk balance of Cervarix remains positive. 
Recommendation  
  Not fulfilled: 
Additional clarifications requested 
The systemic lupus erythematosus reported case which was assessed as causally related to HPV 
vaccination should be further discussed by the MAH. Careful assessment of the medical and family 
history to identify potential risk factors is important in determining possible causes or triggers of the 
illness. In many of the cases reported as reviewed, confirmatory diagnostic information and/or relevant 
family and medical histories were not available. Hence, assessment of potential causality with 
vaccination could not be performed. The MAH is requested to further discuss the clinical history and 
the rationale of the diagnosis of this event assessed as causally related to vaccination. In this context, 
the MAH is invited to bring together information concerning SLE from individual case reviews, 
aggregate assessments of case reports from clinical trials and from the post-marketing settings, post-

the Additional clarifications requested 
Question 1 
The systemic lupus erythematosus reported case which was assessed as causally related to HPV 
vaccination should be further discussed by the MAH. Careful assessment of the medical and family 
history to identify potential risk factors is important in determining possible causes or triggers of the 
illness. In many of the cases reported as reviewed, confirmatory diagnostic information and/or relevant 
family and medical histories were not available. Hence, assessment of potential causality with 
vaccination could not be performed. The MAH is requested to further discuss the clinical history and 
the rationale of the diagnosis of this event assessed as causally related to vaccination. In this context, 
the MAH is invited to bring together information concerning SLE from individual case reviews, 
aggregate assessments of case reports from clinical trials and from the post-marketing settings, post-
marketing observational safety studies

Summary of MAH answer 
The case of SLE in question concerns a 10-year-old female patient. No relevant medical history was 
reported and no risk factors for SLE were identified. The patient’s familial medical history was not 
reported. 
The patient received the first dose of Cervarix. Seven months after the 1st dose the patient was 
diagnosed with suspected transient synovitis. The patient had been experiencing right knee pain for an 
unreported length of time. Treatment with methotrexate and folic acid was initiated. Thirty five months 
after the 1st dose, the patient was diagnosed with SLE. Outcome is stated as unresolved. No other 
physical symptoms were reported by the Investigator. The following laboratory results were provided: 
This case was assessed as related by the Investigator and no rationale for this assessment was 
provided. The Investigator stated there was ‘a reasonable possibility the SLE may have been caused by 
Human papilloma type 16 + 18 vaccine’. 
The diagnosis of SLE could not be confirmed based on the information provided. In this patient, SLE 
diagnostic criteria were not accomplished; there were unspecific weakly positive immunology results 
(low titres of positive ANA with weakly positive Sm antibodies) added to the described clinical features 
that were also unspecific starting about ten months after vaccination with a transient synovitis and 
right knee pain of unknown duration. No response to requests for further information from the 
Investigator was received. Insufficient clinical information is available for adequate assessment of this 
case.  
A safety evaluation of all cases of SLE associated with Cervarix was performed and is attached in 
Appendix 1 of this response. 
MAH conclusion on SLE (Appendix 1) 
The currently available data do not indicate an increased risk of SLE following vaccination with 
Cervarix. The data seen in this review reflect what is seen in the general population: 
• 
The majority of the cases were reported from Asian and Hispanic territories where it is known 
that SLE is more prevalent [Danchenko N, 2006].

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

•  Available post-marketing information does not support a higher-than-expected rate of SLE in 
patients receiving vaccination with Cervarix. 
• 
• 
The age at which the onset of SLE was reported was between 14-58 years, with a mean age of 
24 years. The onset of SLE in females is highest at child-bearing age [Danchenko N, 2006]. 
The time-to-onset for confirmed Cervarix cases ranged from 10 days to 2.5 years and was on 
average 2.5 months. The literature review describes the onset of SLE symptoms as occurring 
between 8 days and 4 months after HPV vaccination.  
Reports of SLE will continue to be monitored through normal proactive pharmacovigilance. 
Rapporteur assessment of Question 1 
Of the 13 confirmed cases, 11 were assessed as having a plausible causal association with Cervarix. 
Table 17 
Characteristics of the 13 confirmed cases. 
Of the 13 confirmed cases, 11 were assessed as having a plausible causal association with Cervarix. In 
these cases, the time-to-onset (TTO) ranged from 10 days to 7 months and a possible association with 
vaccination cannot be excluded. For two of these 11 cases, alternative etiologies such as viral infection 
and pre-existing inflammatory disease were reported.  
The remaining 2 out of the 13 confirmed cases were assessed as unlikely related to Cervarix. For one 
of these cases the time-to-onset was 2.5 years. For the final case, the patient had experienced joint 
pain for 4 years prior to administration of Cervarix, suggesting SLE was pre-existing. 
For the three fatal cases, the cause of death in each case was due to SLE disease activity and related 
complications. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC should include “all adverse reactions from clinical trials, post-authorisation 
safety studies and spontaneous reporting for which, after thorough assessment, a causal relationship 
between the medicinal product and the adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, based for 
example, on their comparative incidence in clinical trials, or on findings from epidemiological studies 
and/or on an evaluation of causality from individual case reports. Adverse events, without at least a 
suspected causal relationship, should not be listed in the SmPC.” 
Because vaccines stimulate the body’s immune system it has been suggested that vaccines could 
increase the risk of developing an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease is a type of disease

that causes the body to attack its own tissues and organs. There are lots of different types of these 
diseases and they cause many different effects. Examples of these diseases are rheumatoid arthritis, 
diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Crohn’s disease, lupus and asthma. About 5 – 8 % of 
the population have these conditions. In clinical trials, the risk of developing an autoimmune disease 
was not higher in the group of people who received Cervarix compared to the group of people who 
received a control (a fake vaccine or another vaccine). 
Conclusion 
The Applicant concludes that there is no increased risk of SLE following vaccination with Cervarix. It is 
acknowledged that the number of cases are too low to distinguish their incidence from the background 
incidence. On the other hand, the Applicant acknowledges both a temporal and causal relationship 
between SLE and Cervarix. In view of the potential theoretical risk of autoimmune diseases following 
vaccination and the temporal association of the SLE cases following vaccination with Cervarix, a causal 
relationship cannot be excluded and is indeed plausible.  
At present, the level of evidence is too low to determine an increased risk of SLE following vaccination, 
despite the temporal relationship. The data are therefore inconclusive as to the risk of SLE following 
vaccination with Cervarix.  
More data are being gathered as SLE is included as an important potential risk of Cervarix in the RMP 
(under the header “Theoretical risk of acquiring vaccine-induced autoimmune disease after 
vaccination”) and a close monitoring is already ongoing, meaning that SLE cases are described in the 
PSUR/PBRER and a discussion on the cumulative cases is provided.  
Since an increased risk of SLE cannot be distinguished from the background incidence of SLE, and for 
the sake of trust in the overall safety and benefit of Cervarix, the Rapporteur agrees with the MAH and 
considers that no further regulatory action is required. 
The MAH is nevertheless requested to continue the close monitoring of SLE and to provide, in the next 
PSUR/PBRER, a detailed discussion of this safety issue together with an updated Observed versus 
Expected Analysis. Moreover, the MAH should describe which additional information regarding SLE 
diagnosis, case confirmation and causality assessment is requested from the SLE case reporter. 
5.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The Article 46 paediatric submission is considered fulfilled. The provided data do not cause major 
concern regarding efficacy or safety of Cervarix. The benefit/risk balance of Cervarix remains positive. 
The MAH is nevertheless requested to continue the close monitoring of SLE and to provide, in the next 
PSUR/PBRER, a detailed discussion of this safety issue together with an updated Observed versus 
Expected Analysis. Moreover, the MAH should describe which additional information regarding SLE 
diagnosis, case confirmation and causality assessment is requested from the SLE case reporter. 
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
Further regulatory action required in the next PBRER:

Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The purpose of this addendum is to provide a summary of the safety and immunogenicity data from 6 
recently completed studies involving the use of Menveo, from now on referred to as MenACWY, in the 
paediatric population, as per Article 46 of the European Paediatric Regulation (EC N0 1901/2006). 
Of these 6 paediatric studies, 4 were in children 2 years of age and above (studies V59_39, V59_40, 
V59_49,  and  V59_50)  and  2  in  children  <  2  years  of  age  (studies  V59_33  and  V59P14E1).  The  MAH 
submitted final reports for V59_39, V59_40, V59_49, V59_50, V59_33 and V59P14E1. An overview of 
these studies is provided in the following table:

Clinical studies 
Study V59_39 
Description 
This  phase  3  study  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  and  the  safety  of  MenACWY  in 
healthy subjects from 11 to 55 years of age in Korea. 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary: 
To  assess  the  immunogenicity  of  a  single  injection  of  MenACWY  as  measured  by  the  percentage  of 
subjects with hSBA seroresponse, directed against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y. 
Secondary: 
To assess the immunogenicity of MenACWY as measured by hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) and 
by the percentage of subjects with hSBA .1:8 directed against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and 
Y. 
Safety objectives: 
To  assess  the  safety  profile  following  MenACWY  and  saline  placebo  in  terms  of  percentages  and 
numbers of subjects with: 
▫ Local and systemic reactions reported from day 1 (day of vaccination) through day 7 postvaccination. 
▫ All other adverse events (AEs) reported from day 1 through day 7 postvaccination. 
▫ Serious AEs (SAEs) and medically attended AEs from day 1 through day 29. 
Study design 
This  study  was  designed  as  a  phase  3,  observer-blind,  multi-center,  randomized,  placebo-controlled 
study in healthy subjects aged 11 to 55 years in Korea.  
Study population /Sample size 
The study enrolled (non-pregnant) healthy subjects aged 11 to 55 years who had not:  
- 
had a previous or suspected disease caused by N. meningitidis,  
Menveo 
P46 029 
Page 3/69 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
- 
had  household  contact  with  and/or  intimate  exposure  to  an  individual  with  culture-proven  N. 
meningitidis infection within 60 days prior to enrolment,  or  
- 
had previously been immunized with a meningococcal vaccine 
A total of approximately 450 healthy subjects (including a drop-out rate of 20%) were enrolled in this 
study. 
Treatments 
Subjects  between  the  ages  of  11  and  55  years  old  were  randomized  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  receive  either 
MenACWY or saline placebo. 
Subjects  who  have  been  randomized  to  Group  II,  the  control  group,  will  be  given  the  option  to  be 
vaccinated with MenACWY after successful registration of the vaccine. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  measure  of  immunogenicity  used  in  this  study  is  a  Serum  Bactericidal  Assay  using  human 
complement (hSBA). hSBA for MenA, MenC, MenW135, and MenY was performed at Novartis Vaccines, 
Klinische Serologie, Marburg (Germany). All subjects had a blood draw before the vaccination (day 1) 
and 28 days following the vaccination (day 29). 
The immunogenicity endpoints are (all at day 29): 
Primary: % subjects with hSBA seroresponse defined as: 
- for subjects with a pre-vaccination hSBA titer < 1:4, a postvaccination hSBA titer ≥1:8 
- for subjects with a pre-vaccination hSBA titer ≥1:4, an increase in hSBA titer of at least four 
times the pre-vaccination titer. 
Secondary:  hSBA GMTs and  % subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8  
The  immune  response  was  considered  sufficient  (i.e.,  the  primary  objective  is  met)  if  for  all  four 
serogroups, the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the percentage of subjects 
with hSBA seroresponse is≥50%. 
CHMP’s comments 
Note that the acceptance criteria for the immune response (i.e. hSBA seroresponse ≥50%) would not 
be acceptable in the European context – response would be expected to be ~70%. 
Statistical Methods 
Definition of analysis populations: 
(a) All Enrolled Population included▫ all subjects who were randomized 
(b)  Full  Analysis  Set/Modified  Intention-to-treat  (MITT)  population,  Immunogenicity  included▫  all 
subjects in the enrolled population who actually received a study vaccination, and - provided at least 
one evaluable serum sample both before and after baseline and whose assay result is available for at 
least one serogroup. 
Menveo 
P46 029 
Page 4/69 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 (c)  Per  Protocol  Set/Per  protocol  (PP)  population,  Immunogenicity  included  all  subjects  in  the  MITT 
immunogenicity  population  who  had  correctly  received  the  vaccine,  and  provided  evaluable  serum 
samples  at  the  relevant  time  points,  and    had  no  major  protocol  violation  as  defined  prior  to 
unblinding. In case of randomization errors, subjects were excluded from the PP analysis and analyzed 
as randomized in the MITT population 
(d) Exposed Population included all enrolled subjects who actually received a study vaccination 
(e) Safety population included all subjects in the Exposed population who provided post-baseline safety 
data. In case of randomization errors, subjects were analyzed as treated in the safety analysis. 
Statistical Hypothesis 
The antibody response of MenACWY was planned to be considered sufficient if for all four serogroups 
the  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  (i.e.,  the  lower  limit  of  the  onesided  97.5%  CI)  for  the 
percentage of subjects with seroresponse, was at least 50%.  
Analysis 
Primary  analysis:  The  primary  analysis  population  for  immunogenicity  is  the  Per  Protocol 
Immunogenicity  Population.  If  the  difference  between  the  PP  and  MITT  population  was  at  least  10% 
then the immunogenicity analyses on the primary endpoints was also assessed on the MITT population 
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) for age, height and 
weight at enrollment were calculated overall and by vaccine group. Distributions of subjects by sex and 
age  were  summarized  overall  and  by  vaccine  group.  The  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA 
seroresponse  and  associated  two-sided  95%  Clopper-Pearson  CIs  were  computed  for  each  vaccine 
group and N. meningitidis serogroup, at each time point for which a blood sample was available. The 
hSBA titers at each visit were logarithmically transformed (base10) and summarized by serogroup and 
vaccine  group.  GMTs  and  associated  two  sided  95%  CIs  were  calculated  at  each  time  point  by 
exponentiating the corresponding log-transformed means (and mean differences from baseline in log-
transformed titers) and 95% CIs for the log-transformed means obtained from a two-way Analysis of 
Variance (ANOVA) with a factor for vaccine group and study center. Titers below the limit of detection 
were set to half that limit for the purposes of analysis. The percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 to 
N.  meningitidis  serogroups  A,  C,  W135  and  Y  was  computed  for  each  vaccine  group,  serogroup  and 
time point including two-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson CIs. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
All 297 subjects enrolled in the MenACWY group and 153 subjects in the placebo group completed the 
study.  Major  protocol  deviations  were  reported  for  1  subject  (<1%)  in  the  MenACWY  group  and  1 
subject (<1%) in the placebo group, while minor protocol deviations were reported for 5 subjects (2%) 
in  the  MenACWY  group  and  1  subject  (<1%)  in  the  placebo  group.  Protocol  deviations  were  mostly 
“Developed Withdrawal Criteria but not Withdrawn” (2 in MenACWY group, 1 in control group) and no 
hSBA results at visit 2 (1 in MenACWY group).

Baseline data 
The  demographic  and  other  baseline  characteristics  were  balanced  across  the  different  vaccination 
groups.  Age,  sex  ratios,  height  and  weight  were  similar  across  the  vaccination  groups  and  all  the 
enrolled subjects met the study entry criteria (Table). 
Efficacy results 
The  overall  seroresponse  rates  at  day  29  were  76%,  86%,  28%,  and  69%  for  the  A,  C,  W  and  Y 
serogroups,  respectively.  Lower  limits  of  the  two-sided  95%  Clopper-Pearson  CI  for  these  observed 
seroresponse  rates  were  71%,  82%,  23%,  and  63%  for  the  A,  C,  W  and  Y  serogroups,  respectively. 
The majority of subjects entered the study with hSBA ≥1:4 against W serogroup in both MenACWY and 
placebo  groups  (261  out  of  293  subjects  [89%]  in  the  MenACWY  group  and  131  out  of  151  subjects 
[87%]  in  the  placebo  group).  Only  21%  of  the  261  MenACWY  subjects  who  had  baseline  hSBA  ≥1:4 
against the W serogroup were seroresponders. 
The baseline GMT against the W serogroup for these 261 seropositive MenACWY subjects was 73 and 
the day 29 hSBA GMT was 171. The GMR to the baseline for these seropositive subjects was 2.34, with 
a two sided 95% CI that did not overlap 1.0 (2.09, 2.62).  
Among the 32 MenACWY subjects who had baseline hSBA <1:4 against the W  serogroup, 84% had a 
day  29  hSBA  ≥ 1:8.  The  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  Clopper-Pearson  CI  for  this  observed 
Menveo 
P46 029 
Page 6/69 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
seroresponse rate was 67%. The hSBA GMT against the W serogroup for these 32 initially seronegative 
MenACWY  subjects  was  40  on  day  29.  The  GMR  at  day  29  was  20  (GMTday  29  /GMT  day  1),  with  a 
two-sided 95% CI of (12, 34). Baseline GMTs were low for the A, C and Y serogroups (2.7, 7.82 and 
9.01  in  the  MenACWY  group  and  2.86,  5.94  and  8.82  in  the  placebo  group),  whereas  baseline  GMTs 
were elevated for the W serogroup (51 in the MenACWY group and 48 in the placebo group).  
The GMTs at 29 days after vaccination in the MenACWY group were 48, 231, 147 and 107 for the A, C, 
W and Y serogroups, respectively.  
The  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA  ≥1:8  were  79%,  99%,  98%,  and  94%  for  the  A,  C,  W  and  Y 
serogroups, respectively at 29 days after vaccination in the MenACWY group.  
Menveo 
P46 029 
Page 7/69 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA  ≥1:8  at  baseline  were  high  for  the  C,  W,  and  Y  serogroups 
(49%  and  39%  for  C,  89%  and  87%  for  W  and  54%  and  53%  for  Y  serogroups  in  MenACWY  and 
placebo  arms,  respectively).  However,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  pre-existing  titers  was  low  for 
the A serogroup (13% in the MenACWY group and 15% in the placebo group). 
CHMP’s comments 
These  primary  outcome  of  seroresponse  at  D29  is  largely  in  line  with  the  results  seen  from  pivotal 
study  V59P13  submitted  in  support  of  the  licensing  of  Menveo  in  the  EU.  A  high  level  of  baseline 
immunity to MenW has also been seen in other studies, albeit not this high. The seroresponse in these 
subjects  was  however  lower  than  would  be  expected  based  upon  earlier  studies  (21%  in  this  study 
compared  to  47%  in  V59P13  for  example).  Importantly,  there  is  a  substantial  increase  in  GMTs  in 
subjects  with  baseline  immunity  against  MenW  in  the  present  study  (GMR  2.09  vs  0.93  in  placebo 
group). Moreover, the % of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 is acceptable. 
Safety results 
In total 450 persons were enrolled, of which 297 exposed to MenACWY and 153 exposed to placebo. All 
subjects  were  included  in  the  safety  population.  Of  these,  40%  in  the  MenACWY  group  compared  to 
34% in the placebo group had at least one reported local or systemic reaction during the 7 days after 
vaccination.  The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  local  reactions  was  comparatively  higher  in  the 
MenACWY  group  (28%)  than  the  placebo  group  (9%),  whereas  the  percentage  of  subjects  reporting 
systemic  reactions  was  similar  in  both  groups  (28%).  Unsolicited  AEs  were  reported  by  12%  of 
subjects receiving MenACWY vs 7% of those receiving placebo (up to D29). AEs considered related to 
study  vaccine  were  reported  for  4%  (11  subjects)  of  the  MenACWY  group  vs  1%  (2  subjects)  of  the 
placebo group. 
Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity. 
The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  solicited  local  reactions  was  comparatively  higher  in  the 
MenACWY group than the placebo group. The most commonly reported local reaction was pain (23% in 
the MenACWY group and 8% in the placebo group) and none of them were severe in intensity. Other 
local reactions were erythema and induration.  
Menveo

The  percentage  of  subjects  with  solicited  systemic  reactions  was  similar  in  both  the  MenACWY  and 
placebo  groups.  The  most  commonly  reported  systemic  reaction  was  myalgia  (15%  in  the  MenACWY 
group  and  8%  in  the  placebo  group)  and  none  of  them  was  severe  in  intensity.  Other  systemic 
reactions were headache, nausea, chills, arthralgia, rash, and fever. 
Other AEs. 
The  most  commonly  experienced  AEs  by  SOC  were:  infections  and  infestations  (1-5%  of  subjects), 
gastrointestinal  disorders  and  general  disorders  and  administrative  site  conditions  (1-3%).  The  most 
commonly  experienced  AEs  by  preferred  term  were:  acute  tonsillitis  and  nasopharyngitis  (1%  in  the 
MenACWY group).

V59_40 
Description 
A  Phase  4,  Placebo-Controlled,  Randomized  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Immunogenicity  and  Safety  of  a 
Combined  Tetanus,  Reduced  Diphtheria  Toxoid,  Acellular  Pertussis  Vaccine  (Tdap,  Boostrix®)  and 
Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus [Types 6, 11, 16, 18] Recombinant Vaccine (Gardasil®) in Healthy 
Adolescents when Administered with MenACWY Conjugate Vaccine 
CHMP’s comments 
The  possible  interaction  between  Gardasil  and  Menveo  and  Tdap/Boostrix  and  Menveo  has  been 
studied in V59P18. V59P18 examined the effect of concomitant administration of MenACWY with Tdap 
and HPV on immunogenicity (to MenACWY, Tdap and HPV vaccine) and safety. This study provided no 
evidence  to  suggest  that  concomitant  administration  of  MenACWY  with  Tdap  &  HPV  vaccines  has  an 
effect  on  the  immune  response  to  MenACWY.  There  was  some  evidence  to  suggest  that  vaccination 
with Tdap one month prior to vaccination with MenACWY might interfere with the immune response to 
MenACWY, as non-inferiority could not be demonstrated for MenW. Secondly, there was some evidence 
to  suggest  a  negative  effect  of  concomitant  vaccination  with  MenACWY  and  HPV  on  the  response  to 
pertussis antigens FHA and PRN, however the clinical relevance is unknown.

Objective(s) 
Immunogenicity Objectives: 
Coprimary: 
Menveo 
P46 029 
Page 10/69 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
1. To demonstrate that the immune response of Tdap given concomitantly with MenACWY and HPV is 
noninferior to the response of Tdap when given with placebo and HPV when measured at 1 month after 
1 dose of Tdap. 
2. To demonstrate that the immune response of HPV vaccine given concomitantly with MenACWY and 
Tdap  is  noninferior  to  the  response  when  HPV  is  given  with  placebo  and  Tdap  when  measured  at  1 
month after the third dose of HPV vaccination. 
Secondary: 
To assess the immune response of MenACWY when administered with Tdap and HPV at 1 month after 1 
dose of MenACWY vaccination.  
Safety Objectives 
To describe the safety profile of Men+Tdap+HPV vs. Placebo+Tdap+HPV. 
The  current  clinical  study  report  (CSR)  presents  only  data  for  the  first  primary  objective  and  the 
secondary immunogenicity and safety objectives. The immunogenicity analysis for the second primary 
objective  (assessment  of  immune  response  against  HPV  antigens)  will  be  performed  as  soon  as 
serological  results  are  available.  The  results  will  be  presented  in  an  addendum  to  the  clinical  study 
report. 
Study design 
This  study  was  designed  as  a  phase  4,  placebo-controlled,  randomized  study  to  evaluate  the 
immunogenicity  and  safety  of  a  combined  tetanus,  reduced  diphtheria  toxoid,  acellular  pertussis 
vaccine and quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recombinant vaccine in healthy adolescents when 
administered with MenACWY. 
Study population /Sample size 
The  study  included  healthy  male/  (non-pregnant)  female  subjects  with  no  history  of  meningococcal 
infection  and/or  vaccination  or  HPV  vaccination,  and  with  an  up-to-date  vaccination  record  for  DTP. 
Approximately 800 subjects, 400 in group 1 and 400 in group 2 were to be enrolled in this study. The 
expected dropout rate was 10%. 
Treatments 
Subjects  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  allocation  ratio  within  each  study  center.  Group  1  received  Tdap, 
HPV  and  MenACWY  concomitantly  for  the  first  vaccination.  Group  2  received  Tdap,  HPV  and  placebo 
concomitantly for the first vaccination. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary outcomes: 
▫ Seroprotection rates for diphtheria and tetanus at 1 month after Tdap vaccination: 
- Percentage of subjects with diphtheria antitoxin ≥1.0 IU/mL; and 
- Percentage of subjects with tetanus antitoxin ≥1.0 IU/mL. 
Menveo 
P46 029 
Page 11/69 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
▫ GMCs for anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN at 1 month after Tdap vaccination 
▫  Seroconversion  rates  for  HPV  types  6,  11,  16  and  18  at  1  month  after  3  HPV  vaccinations. 
Seroconversion  was  defined  as  a  negative  baseline  sample  for  anti-HPV  antibodies  and  anti-HPV 
antibody level greater than or equal to the HPV type-specific cutoff at 1 month after the third dose of 
HPV vaccine. The HPV type-specific seroconversion cutoffs were: 
- Percentage of subjects with HPV 6 ≥ 20 mMU/mL; 
- Percentage of subjects with HPV 11 ≥16 mMU/mL; 
- Percentage of subjects with HPV 16 ≥20 mMU/mL; and 
- Percentage of subjects with HPV 18 ≥24 mMU/mL. 
General Endpoints and Statistics: 
▫  GMT  or  GMC  with  associated  2-sided  95%  CIs  are  displayed  by  visit  and  vaccine  group.  When 
baseline values were available, geometric mean ratios (GMRs) to baseline were also presented. 
▫ Percentage of subjects meeting response criteria. For the routine vaccine antigens, the cut-off levels 
indicated  seroprotection/seroconversion  rates.  The  2-sided  95%  CIs  for  all  response  rates  were 
displayed for all available immunogenicity data by visit and vaccine group. 
▫  Anti-HPV  seroconversion  was  defined  as  a  negative  baseline  sample  for  anti-HPV  and  an  anti-HPV 
greater than or equal to the HPV type-specific cutoff at 1 month after the third dose of the vaccine. 
▫  All  primary  and  secondary  objectives  are  embedded  within  the  display  of  GMT/GMC/percentage 
response according to the respective visit and vaccine group of interest. 
Statistical Methods 
Definition of populations analyzed: 
All Enrolled Population: The enrolled population contained all subjects enrolled and randomized in the 
study. 
Exposed Population: All subjects in the enrolled population who received a study vaccination. 
MITT Population: The MITT population included all subjects in the enrolled population who received all 
the relevant doses of vaccine, and  provided at least 1 evaluable serum sample after baseline. 
Per  Protocol  (PP)  Population:  The  PP  population  included  all  subjects  in  the  MITT  immunogenicity 
population who correctly received all the relevant doses of vaccine, provided evaluable serum samples 
at the relevant time points; and ▫ had no major protocol deviation as defined prior to study unblinding. 
The PP populations were: 
PP – Tdap Serology results at visit 2 within required windows for at least 1 Tdap antigen. 
PP  –  HPV  Serology  results  for  at  least  1  HPV  type  at  both  visit  1  and  visit  5  within  required 
window 
PP – MenACWY Serology results for at least 1 serogroup at both visit 1 and visit 2 within the 
required window 
Menveo 
P46 029 
Page 12/69 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Subjects  were  included  in  the  PP  population  if  they  had  no  major  deviations.  A  major  deviation  was 
defined as a protocol deviation that was considered to have a significant impact on the immunogenicity 
result of the subject.  
Analysis for the primary immunogenicity objectives was based on the PP population as well as the MITT 
population.  Analyses  for  secondary  immunogenicity  objectives  and  other  immunogenicity  endpoints 
were carried out in the PP population only. 
Safety Population 
All subjects who had received at least 1 study vaccine and had postbaseline safety data were included 
in  the  safety  analysis.  If  an  error  in  administration  occurred  where  the  actual  vaccination  that  the 
subject  received  was  different  than  the  one  to  which  they  were  randomly  assigned  (unless  they 
received  all  doses  in  accordance  with  the  incorrect  schedule),  the  subject  was  included  in  the 
vaccination  group  for  the  vaccine  they  were  randomized  to  receive.  If  the  full  series  was  provided 
incorrectly, the subject was analyzed as treated. Safety analyses were based on the safety population. 
Subjects who only provided safety data at 30 minutes postvaccination were represented in summaries 
of safety at 30 minutes postvaccination and were excluded from all other summaries of safety. 
Analysis of Immunogenicity criteria 
The success criterion for this study was a composite based upon 2 coprimary objectives that involve 9 
noninferiority hypotheses. The first coprimary objective was to demonstrate that the immune response 
of  Tdap  given  concomitantly  with  MenACWY  and  HPV  was  noninferior  to  the  response  of  Tdap  when 
given with placebo and HPV  when measured at 1  month after 1 dose of Tdap. The second coprimary 
objective  was  to  demonstrate  that  the  immune  response  of  HPV  vaccine  given  concomitantly  with 
MenACWY and Tdap was noninferior to the response when HPV was given with placebo and Tdap when 
measured at 1 month after the third dose of HPV vaccination. 
First Coprimary Objective: To demonstrate that the immune response of Tdap given concomitantly with 
MenACWY  and  HPV  is  noninferior  to  the  response  of  Tdap  when  given  with  placebo  and  HPV  when 
measured at 1 month after 1 dose of Tdap. 
The group 1 immune response to Tdap was considered noninferior to the group 2 immune response to 
Tdap  at  1  month  after  Tdap  administration  if  the  lower  limit  of the  2-sided  95%  CI  on  the  difference 
between  the  group  1  and  group  2  diphtheria  seroprotection  rate  and  on  the  difference  between  the 
group 1 and group 2 tetanus seroprotection rate were each greater than -10%, and if the lower limit of 
the 2-sided 95% CI on the ratio of group 1 to group 2 GMCs for anti-PT, anti-FHA, and anti-PRN were 
each greater than 0.5. 
The 2-sided 95% CIs for group 1 minus group 2 differences in diphtheria and tetanus response rates 
were constructed using the method of Miettinen and Nurminen. The group 1 versus group 2 GMC ratios 
for  anti-PT,  anti-FHA  and  anti-PRN  and  their  associated  2-sided  95%  CIs  were  computed  by 
exponentiating (base10) the corresponding vaccine group difference in least square means of the log-
transformed  concentrations  and  the  associated  95%  CI  for  the  difference  obtained  from  an  ANOVA 
model  having  factors  for  vaccine  group  and  center.  Concentrations  below  the  limit  of  detection  were 
set to half the limit for the purpose of analysis. 
Second  Coprimary  Objective:  To  demonstrate  that  the  immune  response  of  HPV  vaccine  given 
concomitantly  with  MenACWY  and  Tdap  is  noninferior  to  the  response  when  HPV  was  given  with 
placebo and Tdap when measured at 1 month after the third dose of HPV.

The group 1 immune response to HPV will be considered noninferior to the group 2 immune response 
to  HPV  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  2-sided  95%  CI  on  the  differences  between  the  group  1  and  group  2 
HPV type 6, 11, 16, and 18 seroconversion rates are each greater than -5%. The 2-sided 95% CIs for 
the group 1 minus group 2 differences in HPV 6, HPV 11, HPV 16, and HPV 18 seroconversion rates will 
be constructed using the method of Miettinen and Nurminen. Titers below the limit of detection will be 
set to half the limit for the purpose of analysis. 
Secondary Response Variables: To assess the immune response of MenACWY when administered with 
Tdap  and  HPV  at  1  month  after  1  dose  of  MenACWY  vaccination.  For  a  subject  with  baseline  hSBA 
<1:4, seroresponse was defined as a postvaccination hSBA ≥ 1:8; for  a subject with baseline hSBA ≥
1:4,  seroresponse  was  defined  as  a  postvaccination  hSBA  of  at  least  4  times  the  baseline.  The 
assessment of this objective was based upon descriptive statistics and the construction of 2-sided 95% 
Clopper-Pearson  CIs  on  the  seroresponse  rates  for  each  serogroup  at  1  month  after  MenACWY 
vaccination in group 1. 
Exploratory/Other Analyses 
Other measures of immunogenicity included i) GMCs for diphtheria antitoxin and tetanus antitoxin at 1 
month  after  Tdap  vaccination,  ii)  seroresponse  rates  for  anti-PT,  anti-FHA  and  anti-PRN  at  1  month 
after  Tdap  vaccination,  iii)  GMTs  for  human  HPV  types  6,  11,  16  and  18  at  1  month  after  3  HPV 
vaccinations, iv) percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 for meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y, 
and  v)  hSBA  GMTs  for  meningococcal  serogroups  A,  C,  W  and  Y.  These  additional  endpoints  were 
assessed  using  the  same  methods  as  for  the  analogous  primary  and  secondary  endpoints.  However, 
there  were  no  criteria  for  assessing  vaccine  group  differences  where  group  comparisons  were  made. 
For analyses showing GMCs/GMTs, GMRs to baseline were presented. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A  total  of  801  subjects  who  signed  informed  consent  forms  were  enrolled  in  the  study  and  were 
randomized;  402  subjects  were  included  in  the  Men+Tdap+HPV  group  and  399  subjects  in  the 
Placebo+Tdap+HPV group. In the enrolled population, 741 (93%) subjects completed the study and 60 
(7%)  subjects  were  prematurely  withdrawn.  The  premature  withdrawals  were  mostly  due  to 
withdrawal of consent (3%) and lost to follow up (3%). Less than 1% subjects were withdrawn due to 
protocol deviations (7 subjects), AEs (2 subjects), and administrative reasons (1 subject). 
Out of a total of 801 enrolled subjects, 131 (16%) subjects (18% in the MenACWY+Tdap+HPV group 
and  15%  in  the  Placebo+Tdap+HPV  group)  had  major  protocol  deviations.  The  most  common  major 
deviations  were  due  to  noncompliance  with  study  vaccination  schedule  (10%  subjects  in  the 
MenACWY+Tdap+HPV group and 8% subjects in the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group), followed by receipt of 
concomitant  vaccine(s)  forbidden  in  the  protocol  (2%  in  the  MenACWY+Tdap+HPV  group  and  3%  in 
the  Placebo+Tdap+HPV  group)  and  noncompliance  with  blood  draw  schedules  (2%  in  the 
MenACWY+Tdap+HPV and Placebo+Tdap+HPV groups). 
Minor  protocol  deviations  were  reported  for  297  (37%)  subjects.  These  were  most  commonly  due  to 
procedural  deviations  (27%),  unavailability  of  diary  card  or  worksheet  and/or  solicited  safety  data 
(13%), and subject randomization out of sequence (2%).

Baseline data 
The  demographic  parameters,  such  as  age,  sex  and  race,  were  generally  similar  across  the  study 
groups. The average age of the subjects at study entry was 11.9 (±1.6) years and the majority of the 
subjects were male (60%). The percentage of female subjects was 42% in the Men+Tdap+HPV group 
and 
39% 
in 
the 
Placebo+Tdap+HPV 
group. 
Efficacy results 
First Coprimary endpoint: The noninferiority criterion for diphtheria antigen was met, as the difference 
in  seroprotection  rates  observed  between  the  study  groups  was  13%,  with  the  lower  limit  of  the  2-
sided  95%  CI  for  the  difference  being  9%.  The  difference  in  seroprotection  rates  was  0%,  with  the 
lower  limit  of  the  2-sided  95%  CI  for  the  difference  being  -2%  (Table  11.4.1-1),  satisfying  the 
noninferiority  criterion  for  tetanus  antigen.  The  ratios  of  the  GMCs  of  antibodies  against  pertussis 
antigens  for  the  Men+Tdap+HPV  group  to  the  Placebo+Tdap+HPV  group  were  1.01  for  anti-PT,  0.84 
for  anti-FHA,  and  0.82  for  anti-PRN  with  the  lower  limit of  the  2-sided  95%  CI  for  the  vaccine  group 
ratio  being  0.89,  0.76,  and,  0.72  respectively  (each  greater  than  0.5).  Therefore  the  noninferiority 
criteria for all pertussis antigens were met. In summary, the primary immunogenicity analysis showed 
that  the  immune  responses  to  Tdap  vaccine  given  concomitantly  with  MenACWY  and  HPV  were 
Menveo 
P46 029 
Page 15/69 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
noninferior to that of Tdap vaccine given with placebo and HPV vaccine, for all 5 endpoints measured. 
Results were similar when analyses were repeated for the Tdap MITT population. 
Second  Coprimary  endpoint:  The  immunogenicity  analysis  for  the  second  primary  objective 
(assessment  of  immune  response  against  HPV  antigens)  are  to  be  presented  in  an  addendum  to  the 
clinical study report as soon as results are available.  
CHMP’s comments 
The MAH should submit these results.

Secondary  Objectives:  In  the  Men+Tdap+HPV  group,  at  1  month  postvaccination,  the  overall 
seroresponse  rate  to  a  single  dose  of  MenACWY  was  75%,  69%,  49%,  and  69%  respectively  for 
serogroups A, C, W, and Y. Among the subjects with baseline hSBA <1:4, the seroresponse rate at 1 
month postvaccination was 76%, 78%, 89%, and 81% respectively for serogroups A, C,W and Y. For 
subjects with baseline hSBA ≥1:4, the seroresponse rate was 65%, 58%, 28% and 50% respectively 
for serogroups A, C, W, and Y. Approximately 1% to 5% of subjects in the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group 
showed seroresponse against any MenACWY serogroup. 
At  1  month  postvaccination,  the  GMTs  in  the  Men+Tdap+HPV  group  versus  the  Placebo+Tdap+HPV 
group  were  35  vs.  2.13  against  serogroup  A,  59  vs.  3.92  against  serogroup  C,  61  vs.  12  against 
Menveo 
P46 029 
Page 17/69 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
serogroup  W  and  48  vs.  3.54  against  serogroup  Y,  respectively.  In  the  Men+Tdap+HPV  group,  at  1 
month postvaccination, the GMTs increased 16-fold (GMR) over the baseline against serogroup A, 13-
fold  against  serogroup  C,  5-fold  against  serogroup  W  and  12-fold  against  serogroup  Y.  The  relative 
increase in GMTs for MenW was lower than the other serogroups, reflecting the higher baseline hSBA. 
Assessor’s comments 
Results  are  in  line  with  the  known  immunogenicity  of  MenACWY.  Note  that  earlier  studies  (V59P18) 
provided some indication that there might be immune interference between Tdap and MenACWY: the 
effect of concomitant administration on the response to the MenW component can not be evaluated in 
the current study.  
V59P18  also  provided  some  evidence  to  suggest  a  negative  effect  of  concomitant  vaccination  with 
MenACWY and HPV on the response to pertussis antigens FHA and PRN, in this study too the response 
to  FHA  and  PRN  is  significantly  lower  (albeit  non-inferiority  was  demonstrated)  when  Tdap  is  given 
concomitantly with MenACWY, confirming earlier findings. 
Safety results 
Among  801  subjects  in  the  enrolled  population,  793  (99%)  subjects  were  exposed  to  the  study 
vaccines, all of whom provided postvaccination safety data and were included in the safety set.  
Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity. 
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  any  solicited  AE  reported  from  day  1  (6  hours)  through  day  7 
postvaccination was 72% in the Men+Tdap+HPV group and 64% in the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group 
The rates of both local and systemic solicited AEs were higher in the Men+Tdap+HPV group than in the 
Placebo+Tdap+HPV group (local AEs: 54% vs. 43%; systemic AEs: 53% vs. 46%) after the first study 
vaccination.  The  most  commonly  reported  local  solicited  AE  was  pain  at  the  injection  site  (41%  vs. 
35% in Men+Tdap+HPV  vs. Placebo+Tdap+HPV, respectively; p=0.095), followed by erythema (17% 
vs.  7%;  p<0.001)  and  induration  (16%  vs.  10%;p=0.011).  The  most  commonly  reported  systemic 
solicited  AE  from  6  hours  through  day  7  was  myalgia  (30%  vs.  26%  in  Men+Tdap+HPV  vs. 
Placebo+Tdap+HPV,  respectively)  followed  by  headache  (29%  vs.  25%),  chills  (15%  vs.  13%)  and 
malaise (15% vs. 11%).

Other AEs. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  each  unsolicited  AE  was  similar  across  the  study  groups;  51%  in  the 
Men+Tdap+HPV  group  and  50%  in  Placebo+Tdap+HPV  group.  The  possibly  related  unsolicited  AEs 
were reported by 4% of subjects in both study groups. 
The most commonly reported unsolicited treatment emergent AEs were injection site pain (7% vs. 6% 
in Men+Tdap+HPV vs. Placebo+Tdap+HPV) and pharyngitis (6% vs. 5%). 
There  was  no  death  reported  in  this  study.  A  total  of  7  subjects  (4  subjects  in  the  Men+Tdap+HPV 
group and 3 subjects in the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group) reported 9 SAEs during the entire study period. 
Haematuria, abdominal adhesions, small intestinal obstruction, aggression, hypothyroidism, and type 1 
diabetes  mellitus  were  SAEs  reported  in  subjects  in  the  Men+Tdap+HPV  group.  Peritonsillar  abscess, 
accidental overdose and affective disorder were reported in subjects in the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group. 
Menveo 
P46 029 
Page 20/69 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
All  subjects  recovered  from  the  SAEs  except  for  one  subject  (119/017)  with  persistent  affective 
disorder. None of the SAEs were considered to be related to study vaccine. 
Pyrexia  and  headache  in  subject  108/035  and  vasovagal  syncope  in  subject  114/047  led  to  the 
premature  withdrawal  in  the  Men+Tdap+HPV  group.  Subject  114/047  was  not  vaccinated  during  the 
study.  Toothache,  influenza  and  laceration  led  to  delay  in  study  vaccination  in  2  subjects  from  the 
Men+Tdap+HPV group and 1 subject from the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group. 
Assessor’s comments: 
Safety findings are in line with the known safety profile of Menveo.

Study design 
This was a phase 3, multicenter, single armed open-label study to evaluate immunogenicity and safety 
of MenACWY-CRM in healthy subjects ≥ 2 to ≤ 18 years of age in Taiwan. 
CHMP’s comments: 
Note that the study design was a recommendation of the Taiwanese authorities. 
Study population /Sample size 
Inclusion criteria: Subjects eligible to be enrolled in this study were those who were ≥2 to ≤18 years 
of age, those whose parent/legal representative provided written informed consent (≥2 to ≤18 years 
of age) and who provided written assent (≥7 to ≤18 years of age), were available for both study visits, 
and were in good health based on the clinical judgment of the investigator. Exclusion criteria: Serious, 
acute, or chronic illnesses were reasons for exclusion. 
A total of 340 subjects (170 subjects in each age group) were planned to be enrolled in the study. A 
total of 341 subjects were actually enrolled; 173 subjects in the age group ≥ 2 to ≤ 10 years and 168 
subjects in the age group ≥ 11 to ≤ 18 years. A total of 340 (173 subjects in the age group ≥ 2 to ≤ 10 
years  and  167  subjects  in  the  age  group ≥  11  to  ≤ 18  years)  subjects  completed  the  study  and  were 
analyzed for safety, 336 (170 subjects in the age group ≥ 2 to ≤ 10 years and 166 subjects in the age 
group  ≥   11  to  ≤   18  years)  subjects  were  included  in  the  modified-intent-to-treat  (MITT)  and  per 
protocol (PP) immunogenicity analyses 
Treatments 
Investigational  (Test)  vaccine,  Novartis  MenACWY  (vial/vial)  [Lot  no.  M11006  (expiry  date  August 
2012)]  was  obtained  by  extemporaneous  mixing  of  the  lyophilized  MenA  component  with  the  liquid 
MenCWY  component  just  before  injection.  One  0.5  mL  dose  of  MenACWY-CRM  was  administered  by 
intramuscular (IM) injection in the deltoid area of nondominant arm.

Statistical Methods 
For this study there was no hypothesis to be statistically tested. Endpoints were reported descriptively, 
overall and by age group. 
Definition of data sets analyzed: 
a. Enrolled set: all subjects who  signed an informed consent,  underwent screening procedure(s), and 
were assigned a subject number. 
b. Exposed set: all enrolled subjects who actually received the study vaccination.  
c. Safety set: all subjects in the exposed set who provided any postbaseline safety data. 
d. Modified intent-to-treat (MITT) set: This set was defined by visit (visit 1, visit 2, both visits) and by 
serogroup. All subjects in the exposed set who provided evaluable serum samples whose assay results 
were  available  for  at  least  one  serogroup  on  day  1  and/or  day  29.  The  primary  and  secondary 
objectives were based on MITT Population 
e. Per protocol (PP) set: all subjects in MITT who had no major protocol violations. 
The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  with  hSBA  seroresponse  and  associated  two-sided  95%

W135 and Y at day 29, for all subjects overall. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Date of first enrollment: 15-08-2011; Date of last visit: 21-01-12 
There were 341 subjects enrolled into the study and 340 subjects completed the study. One subject in 
the  age  group  ≥  11  to  ≤  18  years  was  prematurely  withdrawn  from  the  study  due  to  withdrawal  of 
consent. The primary analysis set was MITT that included nearly all subjects (336; 99%).

Baseline data 
The  mean  age  of  age  group  ≥  2  to  ≤  10  years  and  ≥  11  to  ≤  18  years  was  6.3  and  14.0  years, 
respectively and nearly a similar number of male and female subjects participated in both age groups. 
Efficacy results 
Primary objective 
The overall seroresponse rates at day 29 after MenACWY-CRM vaccination were 83%, 93%, 50%, and 
65%  respectively  for  the  serogroups  A,  C,  W135,  and  Y.  Highest  seroresponse  was  observed  against 
the  serogroup  C  (93%)  and  the  lowest  against  the serogroup  W135  (50%).  The  majority  of  subjects 
entered the study with hSBA titer ≥ 1:4 against the serogroup W135 (201 out of 334 subjects; 60%). 
In  the  subjects  with  the  negative  prevaccination  titer  (baseline  titer  <  1:4),  hSBA  seroresponse  was 
83%,  96%,  89%,  and  77%  respectively  for  the  serogroups  A,  C,  W135,  and  Y  after  MenACWY-CRM 
vaccination.

The  baseline  GMTs  were  low  for  all  the  serogroups  (2.12,  3.19,  10,  and  3.56  respectively  for  A,  C, 
W135 and Y serogroups). At day 29 after MenACWY-CRM vaccination, GMTs increased up to 53, 179, 
71  and  38  respectively  for  the  serogroups  A,  C,  W135,  and  Y.  GMR  (GMTday  29/GMTday  1)  for  the 
serogroups A, C, W135 and Y at day 29 was 25, 57, 6.78 and 11, respectively. The highest increase in 
GMTs was observed for the serogroup C and lowest for the serogroup W135

The  percentage  of  subjects  with  prevaccination  hSBA  titer  ≥  1:8  were  low  for  the  serogroups  A,  C,  Y 
(3%,  17%  and  24%,  respectively)  and  high  for  the  serogroups  W135  (58%).  At  day  29  after 
MenACWY-CRM vaccination, the percentages of subjects with hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 were 83%, 96%, 96%, 
and 82% respectively for the serogroups A, C, W135, and Y. 
CHMP’s comments 
Results are in line with other immunogenicity studies in the same age groups. The response is slightly 
higher in older children compared to children aged 2-10 yrs. Here too the limited seroresponse seen in 
subjects  with  pre-existing  antibody  titers  against  MenW  but  also  MenY  is  evident  –  there  is  a 
substantial increase in GMT. A relatively high proportion of subjects had pre-existing antibodies against 
MenW, this proportion increased with age.   
Safety results 
Of the 341 subjects enrolled in this study, 340 were administered study vaccine. Subject 03/015 was 
terminated from the study due to withdrawal of consent at visit 1 and was not vaccinated. 
Solicited local and systemic AEs 
Age group ≥ 2 to ≤ 5 years 
In the age group ≥ 2 to ≤ 5 years, any local AE was reported by 33 subjects (46%) any systemic AE 
was  reported  by  19  subjects  (26%),  and  any  other  AE  was  reported  by  4  subjects  (6%).  The  most 
Menveo

commonly  reported  solicited  local  AE  was  tenderness  (27  subjects;  38%),  followed  by  erythema  (7 
subjects,  10%)  and  induration  (6  subjects,  8%).  The  majority  of  solicited  local  AEs  were  of  mild  or 
moderate  intensity.  One  subject  reported  tenderness  of  severe  intensity  and  one  subject  reported 
erythema  of  severe  intensity.  The  most  commonly  reported  systemic  AE  was  vomiting  (7  subjects; 
10%),  followed  by  irritability  (5  subjects;  7%),  rash  (4  subjects;  6%)  and  fever  ≥38C  (4  subjects; 
6%).  The  majority  of  systemic  AEs  were  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity  with  the  exception  of  an 
urticarial  rash  which  was  reported  in  1  subject  (1%).  Antipyretic/analgesic  medications  were 
administered to 4 subjects (6%). 
Age group ≥ 6 to ≤ 10 years 
In the age group ≥ 6 to ≤ 10 years, any local AE was reported by 42 subjects (42%), any systemic AE 
was  reported  by  19  subjects  (26%),  and  any  other  AE  was  reported  by  4  subjects  (6%).  The  most 
commonly reported solicited local AE was pain (37 subjects; 37%), followed by erythema (17 subjects, 
17%)  and  induration  (14  subjects,  14%).  All  of  the  solicited  local  AEs  were  of  mild  or  moderate 
intensity.  The  most  commonly  reported  systemic  AE  was  myalgia  (20  subjects;  20%),  followed  by 
malaise  (13  subjects;  13%),  headache  (11  subjects;  11%)  and  nausea  (10  subjects;  10%).  The 
majority of systemic AEs were of mild or moderate intensity with the exception of urticarial rash which 
was  reported  in  3  subjects  (3%).  There  were  3  subjects  (3%)  who  reported  fever  ≥  38  °C,  and  2 
subjects (2%) who were administered antipyretic/analgesic medications. 
Age group ≥ 11 to ≤ 18 years 
In  the  age  group  ≥  11  to  ≤  18  years  of  age,  any  local  AE  was  reported  by  71  subjects  (43%),  any 
systemic AE was reported by 63 subjects (38%) and any other AE  was reported by 3 subjects (2%). 
The most commonly reported solicited local AE was pain (62 subjects; 37%), followed by erythema (17 
subjects,  10%)  and  induration  (12  subjects,  7%).  The  majority  of  solicited  local  AEs  were  of  mild  or 
moderate  intensity,  with  only  1  subject  reporting  pain  of  severe  intensity.  The  most  commonly 
reported  systemic  AE  was  myalgia  (49  subjects;  29%),  followed  by  malaise  (35  subjects;  21%)  and 
headache  (29  subjects;  17%).  The  majority  of  systemic  AEs  were  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity. 
However, severe intensity reactions were reported in 4 subjects (2%) for headache, in 3 subjects (2%) 
for urticarial rash, in 2 subjects (1%) each for malaise and myalgia and in 1 subject (1%) for arthralgia. 
There were 2 subjects (1%) who reported fever ≥ 38 °C, and 3 subjects (2%) who were administered 
antipyretic/analgesic medications.

Unsolitited AEs 
Unsolicited  AEs,  which  were  collected  from  study  day  1  (day  of  vaccination)  through  to  study  day  7 
postvaccination, were experienced by 16% of subjects in the age group 2 to 10 years and by 12% of 
subjects in the age group 11 to 18 years.The most commonly reported AEs by SOC in the age group ≥ 
2  to  ≤  10  years  were  infections  and  infestations  (11  subjects;  6%);  general  disorders  and 
administrative  site  conditions  (9  subjects;  5%);  gastrointestinal  disorders  (3  subjects;  2%); 
respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (3  subjects;  2%);  and  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue 
disorders (3 subjects; 2%). The most commonly reported AEs by SOC in the age group ≥ 11 to ≤ 18 
years  were  general  disorders  and  administrative  site  conditions  (7  subjects;  4%);  infections  and 
infestations (6 subjects; 4%); and nervous system disorders (6 subjects; 4%) 
The most commonly reported AEs by PT in the age group ≥ 2 to ≤ 10 years were: 
Nasopharyngitis  (6  subjects;  3%),  injection  site induration  (4  subjects; 2%),  injection  site pruritis  (4 
subjects;  2%),  injection  site  erythema  (3  subjects;  2%),  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (3 
subjects;  2%).  At  least  possibly  related  AEs  were  experienced  by  6%  of  the  subjects  and  were  most 
commonly associated with injection site events. 
The most commonly reported AEs by PT in the age group ≥ 11 to ≤ 18 years were:   
injection site induration (5 subjects; 3%), dizziness (4 subjects; 2%), upper respiratory tract infection 
(3 subjects; 2%), headache (2 subjects; 1%), injection site erythema (2 subjects; 1%), injection site 
swelling  (2  subjects;  1%),  nasopharyngitis  (2  subjects;  1%),  and  oropharyngeal  pain  (2  subjects; 
1%). At least possibly related AEs were experienced by 6% of the subjects and were most commonly 
associated with injection site events or dizziness 
Deaths, other serious adverse events and other significant adverse events 
There were no deaths during the study. There was one SAE reported during the study; subject 03/039 
who  experienced  pneumonia  of  moderate  intensity  starting  on  study  day  17  and  lasting  for  15  days. 
This was considered unrelated to the study drug. There were no AEs leading to premature withdrawal.

Description 
A  phase  3,  multicenter,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  Novartis 
meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-CRM) in healthy children,  adolescents, and adults 
in Russia 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Immunogenicity (all at day 29) 
Primary: 
• 
To assess the immunogenicity of a single injection of MenACWY-CRM vaccine as measured by 
the  percentage  of  subjects  with  hSBA  seroresponse1,  directed  against  N  meningitidis 
serogroups A, C, W, and Y. 
Secondary: 
• 
• 
To assess the immunogenicity of a single injection of MenACWY-CRM vaccine as measured by 
the  percentage  of  subjects  with  hSBA  seroresponse1,  directed  against  N  meningitidis 
serogroups A, C, W, and Y by age group (2-10, 11-17, and 18 years and above). 
To assess the immunogenicity of a single injection of MenACWY-CRM vaccine as measured by 
hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) and by the percentage of subjects with hSBA titer ≥ 1:8, 
directed against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y, overall and by age group. 
Safety objectives: 
To assess the safety profile following MenACWY-CRM vaccination in terms of percentage and number of 
subjects with: 
• 
• 
• 
local and systemic reactions reported from study day 1 (day of vaccination) through study day 
7 postvaccination; 
all other adverse events (AEs) reported from study day 1 through study day 7 postvaccination; 
serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  and  medically  attended  AEs  and  AEs  resulting  in  premature 
withdrawal from study day 1 through study day 29. 
Study design 
This was a phase 3, multicenter, open-label, single arm study to evaluate immunogenicity and safety 
of  Novartis  meningococcal  ACWY-CRM  conjugate  vaccine  (MenACWY-CRM)  in  healthy  subjects  in 
Russia from the age of 2 years (≥2 years).

Study population /Sample size 
A  total  of  approximately  198  subjects  (66  subjects  in  each  age  group;  ≥2  -  ≤10  yrs;  ≥11-≤17  yrs; 
≥18  yrs)  were  planned  for  enrollment  into  this  study.  Assuming  a  10%  dropout  rate,  this  would 
provide approximately 60 evaluable subjects in each age group. The sample size of approximately 180 
evaluable subjects was considered reasonable based on 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the observed 
seroresponse. 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: 
Inclusion  criteria:  Male  and  female  subjects,  from  2  years  of  age  and  above  (≥2  years),  who  were 
generally  in  good  health,  available  for  all  study  visits,  who  and/or  whose  parent/legally  acceptable 
representative had given written informed consent at the time of enrollment. 
Exclusion criteria: Serious, acute, or chronic illnesses, as well as confirmed pregnancies led to subject 
exclusion.  Previous  or  suspected  disease  caused  by  N  meningitidis  or  previous  immunization  with 
meningococcal vaccine were considered exclusion criteria. 
Treatments  
All persons received MenACWY-CRM (cross-reacting material) conjugate vaccine Lot #: M11052 (vial-
vial presentation). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The following immunogenicity endpoints were assessed for serogroups A, C, W, and Y. 
• 
Primary:  Percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA  seroresponse.  Seroresponse  is  defined  as  (a)  for 
subjects  with  a  prevaccination  hSBA  <1:4,  a  postvaccination  hSBA  titer  ≥1:8  or  (b)  for 
subjects with a prevaccination hSBA ≥1:4, an increase in hSBA titer of at least four times the 
prevaccination titer 
•  Secondary: hSBA GMTs and percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8. 
Solicited local and systemic AEs: 
Selected local and systemic AEs reported from days 1 through 7 after vaccine administration 
Unsolicited AEs: 
•  All AEs other than solicited local and systemic AEs from days 1 through 7. 
•  Serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  medically  attended  AEs,  and  AEs  resulting  in  premature 
withdrawal from days 1 through 29. 
Statistical Methods 
Definition of populations to be analyzed: 
(a)  All  Enrolled  Population:  All  subjects  who  had  signed  an  informed  consent,  undergone  screening 
procedure(s), and had a subject number assigned. 
(b) Exposed: All enrolled subjects who actually received study vaccination. 
Menveo 
P46 029 
Page 33/69 
 
 
  
 
 
 
(c) Full Analysis Set (FAS) population6, Immunogenicity: This population was defined by serogroup. All 
subjects  in  the  exposed  population  who  provided  one  evaluable  serum  samples  whose  assay  results 
were available for at least one serogroup at baseline and at day 29. 
(d) Per Protocol (PP) Population, Immunogenicity: This population was to be defined by serogroup. All 
subjects in the FAS who provided evaluable serum samples whose assay results were available for at 
least one serogroup on day 1 and on day 29 and had no major protocol violations. 
Immunogenicity analysis: There was no statistical hypothesis related to the objectives to be tested. 
Endpoints for each serogroup were descriptively reported for the overall study population and by age 
group.  For  each  of  the  serogroups  in  the  vaccine,  the  numbers,  percentages,  and  95%  CI  of  the 
percentages  of  subjects  who  have  achieved  seroresponse  were  reported.  The  numbers,  percentages, 
and  95%  CI  of  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  pre-  and  post-vaccination  hSBA  ≥  1:8  were  also 
summarized.  Pre-  and  postvaccination  GMTs  and  their  associated  95%  CIs  were  presented  for  each 
serogroup overall and by age group. 
Safety analysis: The number and percentage of subjects with the following reports was calculated: 
•  Solicited  local  and  systemic  adverse  events  reported  during  days  1  through  7  across  age 
groups– 2 through 3 years (≥2 to ≤3 years), 4 through 5 years (≥4 to ≤5 years), 2 through 5 
years (≥2 to ≤5 years), 6 through 10 years (≥6 to ≤10 years), 11 through 17 years (≥11 to 
≤17 years), 18 years and above (≥18 years) and also overall summary for 6 years and above 
(≥6 years). 
•  All  AEs  occurring  during  days  1  through  7  after  vaccination  across  age  groups  2  through  10 
years (≥2 to ≤10 years), 11 through 17 years (≥11 to ≤17 years), 18 years and above (≥ 18 
years)  and  overall  summary  for  2  years  and  above  (≥2  years).  ▫  all  SAEs  and  medically 
attended AEs and premature withdrawals due to AEs, occurring during days 1 through 29. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Date of first enrollment: 14 NOV 12; Date of last visit: 19 MAR 13 
The primary analysis population for immunogenicity was the Full Analysis Set (FAS). For assessing the 
robustness of results, the immunogenicity analyses on the primary and secondary endpoints was also 
assessed  on  the  Per  Protocol  Set  (PPS).  Out  of  the  total  198  subjects,  197  (99%)  subjects  were 
vaccinated  with  the  study  vaccine.  One  subject  (01006)  from  2-10  years  age  group  was  withdrawn 
from the study at visit 1 due to withdrawal of consent and did not receive study vaccination 
The FAS included 97% of the enrolled subjects (193 subjects). One subject (01006) was excluded from 
day 1 and day 29 FAS due to withdrawal of consent at visit 1. Additionally 4 subjects (03011, 04012, 
05034,  05062)  were  excluded  from  day  29  FAS  as  there  was  no  blood  draw  analyzed  for  these 
subjects,  therefore  the  postvaccination  hSBA  results  were  not  available.  The  PPS  included  92%  of 
enrolled subjects. A total of 16 subjects (8%) had  major protocol deviations and were excluded from 
PP immunogenicity analysis. Most common reasons for major protocol deviations were that the blood 
draw was performed outside the protocol specified window (in 5% of subjects) and samples at visit 2 
were not analyzed for 4 subjects (2%) (subjects 03011, 04012, 05034 and 05062) for serogroups A, 
C, W and Y.

Baseline data 
The  mean  age  of  the  overall  study  population  was  19.6  (+15.9)  years  and  a  higher  percentage  of 
females were enrolled than males (55% versus 45%).  
The  mean  age  of  the  2  through  10  years  age  group  was  6  (+2.7)  years  and  a  slightly  higher 
percentage of females were enrolled than the males (53% versus 47%). The mean age of 11 through 
17  years  age  group  was  13.8  (+2.1)  years  and  a  higher  percentage of  males were enrolled  than  the 
females (56% versus 44%). The mean age of the  ≥18 years age group was 38.8 (+12.5) years and 
majority of enrolled subjects were females (67% versus 33% males). 
The demographic and baseline characteristics of the FAS and PPS were similar to the enrolled set. 
Efficacy results 
In the overall study cohort, against serogroup  A, 91% of subjects had a prevaccination hSBA < 1:4 
(176  subjects)  and  88%  of  these  subjects  achieved  a  postvaccination  hSBA  ≥1:8.  There  were  9%  of 
subjects  (17  subjects)  with  a  prevaccination  hSBA  ≥1:4  and  9  subjects  (53%)  had  at  least  a  4-fold 
increase. Against serogroup  C, 66% of subjects (126 subjects) had a prevaccination hSBA< 1:4 and 
77%  of  these  subjects  achieved  a  postvaccination  hSBA≥  1:8.  There  were  34%  of  subjects  (66 
subjects)  with  a  prevaccination  hSBA≥  1:4  and  45  of  these  subjects  (68%)  had  at  least  a  4  fold 
increase.  Overall,  74%  of  subjects  showed  seroresponse  against  serogroup  C,  at  4  weeks  after  one 
dose  of  MenACWY  conjugate  vaccine.  Against  serogroup  W,  42%  of  subjects  had  a  prevaccination 
hSBA<  1:4  and  93%  of  these  subjects  achieved  a  postvaccination  hSBA≥  1:8.  There  were  58%  of 
subjects  (112  subjects)  with  a  prevaccination  hSBA≥  1:4  and  37%  of  these  subjects  (41  subjects) 
showed at least a 4 fold increase in hSBA titers. Overall, 60%of subjects showed seroresponse against 
serogroup W, at 4 weeks after one dose of MenACWY conjugate vaccine. Against serogroup Y, 79% of 
subjects  had  a  prevaccination  hSBA<  1:4  and  87%  of  these  subjects  achieved  a  postvaccination 
hSBA≥ 1:8. There were 21% of subjects (40 subjects) with a prevaccination  hSBA≥ 1:4 and 70% of 
these subjects (28 subjects) showed at least a 4 fold increase in hSBA titers. Overall, 83%of subjects 
Menveo

showed seroresponse against serogroup Y, at 4 weeks after one dose of MenACWY conjugate vaccine 
(Table 11.4.1-1). 
GMTs and GMRs: 
Overall (≥2 years): 
In the overall study cohort (≥2 years of age), the baseline hSBA GMT against serogroup  A was 2.35. 
At  4  weeks  after  one  dose  of  MenACWY  conjugate  vaccine,  there  was  40-fold  increase  in  hSBA  titers 
against serogroup A. The baseline hSBA GMT against serogroup  C was 4.07 in the overall age group. 
At  4  weeks  after  1  dose  of  MenACWY  conjugate  vaccine  there  was  14-fold  increase  in  GMTs  from 
baseline. Against serogroup  W the baseline GMT was 12 in the overall age group. At 4 weeks after 1 
dose  of  MenACWY  conjugate  vaccine  there  was  9.33-fold  increase  in  GMTs  from  baseline.  Against 
Menveo

serogroup  Y,  the  baseline  GMT  was  2.93  in  the  overall  age  group.  At  4  weeks  after  1  dose  of 
MenACWY conjugate vaccine, there was 20-fold increase in GMTs from baseline. 
Age group:  
Serogroup  A:  At  4  weeks  after  vaccination,  there  was  31-fold  and  30-fold  increase  in  GMTs  from 
baseline in the 2 to 10 years and ≥18 years age groups respectively; in the 11 to 17 years age group 
there  was  55-fold  increase  in  GMTs  from  baseline  against  serogroup  A.  Serogroup  C:    At  4  weeks 
after vaccination, there was 7.16-fold increase in GMTs in 2 to 10 years age group, 12-fold increase in 
11  to  17  years  age  group  and  25-  fold  increase  in  ≥18  years  age  group  against  serogroup  C. 
Serogroup W: At 4 weeks after vaccination, there was 11-fold increase in GMTs from baseline in 2 to 
10 years and ≥18 years age groups; in the 11 to 17 years age group there was 6.48-fold increase in 
GMTs against serogroup W. Serogroup  Y: At 4 weeks after vaccination, there was 11-fold increase in 
GMTs from baseline in 2 to 10 years age group; in 11 to 17 years age group there was 19-fold increase 
in GMTs from baseline and in ≥18 years age group there was 29-fold increase in GMTs from baseline 
against serogroup Y.

Against serogroup A, in the overall study cohort ( ≥2 years) there were 6% subjects with hSBA≥1:8 at 
baseline. At 4 weeks after MenACWY vaccination there was a significant increase in the percentage of 
subjects with hSBA≥1:8 against serogroup A (89% of subjects with hSBA≥1:8). Against serogroup C, 
at baseline 26% of subjects had hSBA≥1:8 from the overall study cohort. At 4 weeks after vaccination, 
84% of subjects from the overall age group had hSBA≥1:8 against this serogroup. Against serogroup 
W,  at  baseline  57%  of  subjects  from  the  overall  study  cohort  had  hSBA≥1:8.  At  4  weeks  after 
vaccination,  a  large  proportion  of  subjects  (97%  of  subjects)  from  the  overall  age  group  showed 
hSBA≥1:8  against  serogroup  W.  Against  serogroup  Y,  at  baseline,  16%  of  subjects  from  the  overall 
study cohort had hSBA≥1:8. At 4 weeks after vaccination, 88% of subjects showed hSBA≥1:8 against 
this serogroup.

CHMP’s comments 
Again, results are by and large in line with what is known about Menveo. The high % of subjects with 
baseline titers against MenW is evident in this study too – in particular in persons aged over 11 yrs. In 
these  subjects  too  you  see  a  reasonable  increase  in  GMTs,  in  line  with  the  increase  seen  for  MenC, 
suggesting a good vaccine induced response. Notably, for MenC, MenY and in particular for MenA the 
response  is  stronger  in  subjects  aged  11-18  yrs  compared  to  those  aged  2-10  years.  For  MenW  the 
response seems less strong in the 11-18 yr age group. 
In general, the immunogenicity findings from the study  are in line with what is known already. 
Safety results 
A total of 99% of the enrolled subjects were included in the safety population 
Solicited AEs: 
The solicited AEs (local, systemic or other solicited AEs) were reported by 67% of subjects from 2 to 5 
years age group and by 64% of subjects from ≥6 years age group. When assessed by age group, the 
percentage of subjects reporting solicited local, systemic or other solicited AEs in 2 to 3 years, 6 to 10 
years, 11 to 17 years and ≥18 years age group was 58% to 67% across these age groups. 
Menveo 
P46 029

Solicited local AEs were reported by 59% of subjects in 2 to 5 years age group and by 53% of subjects 
in  ≥6  years  age  group.  The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  solicited  AEs  in  the  age  groups  2  to  3 
years, 6 to 10 years, 11 to 17 years and .18 years was similar to the overall age groups (2 to 5 years 
and ≥6 years) (47% to 59% across age groups). 
Most  commonly  reported  solicited  local  AE  in  2  to  5  years  age  group  was  injection  site  tenderness 
(41%);  a  similar  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  2  to  3  years  age  group  reported  tenderness  (39%). 
There were no severe local AEs reported in 2 to 5 years age group.  
Most  commonly  reported  solicited  local  AE  in  ≥6  years  age  group  was  injection  site  pain  (48%)  and 
across the age sub-groups. 42% of subjects from 6 to 10 years, 50% of subjects from 11 to 17 years 
and 50% of subjects from ≥18 years age groups, reported injection site pain. 
Solicited  systemic  AEs  were  reported  by  a  low  percentage  of  subjects  from  2  to  5  years  age  group 
(7%)  and  2  to  3  years  age  group  reported  11%  of  subjects  with  such  AEs.  The  ≥6  years  age  group 
reported  40%  of  subjects  with  solicited  systemic  AEs  and  across  age  sub-groups,  32%  from  6  to  10 
years, 45% from 11 to 17 years and 39% from ≥18 years age groups reported systemic AEs. 
Most commonly reported systemic AEs in the ≥6 years age group and in age sub-groups was headache 
(25% in ≥6 years), malaise (20% in ≥6 years) and myalgia (19% in  ≥6 years). Severe systemic AEs 
were reported by a low percentage of subjects (≤4%). 
Unsolicited AEs (including solicited AEs continuing past day 7): 
The unsolicited AEs (including solicited AEs continuing past day 7) with onset within days 1 to 7, were 
reported by 17% of subjects in the overall study cohort (≥2 years of age); most of the unsolicited AEs 
were solicited local and systemic AEs continuing past 7-day window and these were assessed to be at 
least possibly related to the study vaccination (10%). Medically attended AEs were reported by 4% of 
subjects in the overall study cohort and across age sub-groups 2% to 8% subjects reported medically 
attended  AEs.  The  most  commonly  reported  unsolicited  AEs  by  subjects  in  2  to  10  years  age  group 
were rhinitis (8%), oropharyngeal pain (3%) and nasopharyngitis (3%). The 11 to 17 years age group 
commonly  reported  injection  site  swelling  (5%),  injection  site  pain  (3%)  and  injection  site  erythema 
(3%). The ≥18 years age group commonly reported injection site induration (6%) and other injection 
site AEs such as erythema (5%), pain (3%), and pruritus (3%). 
Deaths, serious adverse events or other significant adverse events 
No  deaths  were  reported  in  the  study.  None  of  the  subjects  reported  SAEs  and  there  were  no 
premature withdrawals due to AEs. 
CHMP’s comments 
The incidence of AEs is in line with other studies – there is no new safety signal.

months or either 1 or 2 doses between 12-18 months. Among subjects who received 4 doses rates for 
hSBA titer ≥8 at 40 months were 10% for A, 34% for C, 76% for W and 67% for Y.  Among those who 
received 1-2 doses rates were 35% for A, 51% for C, 83% for W and 71% for Y.

Objective(s) 
Immunogenicity Objectives: 
Primary 
▫  To  evaluate  the  persistence  of  the  antibody  response  in  children  of  40  and  60  months  of  age 
previously  vaccinated  with  MenACWY  in  study  V59P14,  as  measured  by  percentage  of  subjects  with 
human Serum Bactericidal Assay (hSBA) titers ≥1:8 directed against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, 
W-135, and Y. 
Secondary 
▫  To  evaluate  the  persistence  of  the  antibody  response  in  children  of  40  and  60  months  of  age 
previously vaccinated with MenACWY in study V59P14, as measured by the percentage of subjects with 
hSBA titers ≥1:4 and hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) directed against N meningitidis serogroups 
A, C, W-135, and Y. 
▫  To  evaluate  the  functional  antibody  levels  in  children  of  40  and  60  months  of  age  who  were  not 
previously vaccinated with meningococcal vaccine, as measured by percentage of subjects with  hSBA 
titers  ≥  1:4,  percentage  of  subjects  with  hSBA  titers  ≥1:8,  and  hSBA  GMTs  directed  against  N 
meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. 
▫  To  evaluate  the  antibody  response  of  MenACWY  given  at  60  months  of  age  in  children  who  had 
previously received at least one dose of Novartis MenACWY vaccine in study V59P14 compared to the 
antibody response to one dose of MenACWY in meningococcal vaccine-naive subjects, as measured by 
percentage of subjects with seroresponse, the percentage of subjects with  hSBA titers ≥1:8, and the 
percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥1:4 directed against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, 
and Y, at 1 month1 postvaccination. 
Safety Objectives: 
▫ To assess the safety and tolerability of a booster dose of MenACWY in subjects who were previously 
vaccinated with MenACWY.  
▫  To  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  a  single  dose  of  MenACWY  in  meningococcal  vaccine  naive 
subjects 60 months of age. 
Study design 
This was a phase 3b, multicenter, open-label, controlled study. All US sites participating in the V59P14 
trial  that  had  adequate  enrollment  were  approached  to  participate  in  this  extension  study.  Subjects 
from the parent V59P14 study who received either 4 doses of MenACWY (ACWY-42) or 1 or 2 doses of 
Menveo 
P46 029

MenACWY  (ACWY-23),  were  included  in  this  extension  study  and  administered  a  booster  dose  of 
MenACWY at 60 months of age. 
Subjects in the ACWY-4 group received a primary vaccination schedule of 3 doses 2 months apart (2, 4 
and  6  months  of  age)  followed  by  a  fourth  dose  at  12  or  13  months.  Subjects  in  the  ACWY-2  group 
received the first dose at 12 or 13 months and the second dose at 15 months of age or a single dose at 
18  months.  A  group  of  naive  subjects  (Naive404  and  Naive605),  age-matched  to  the  subjects  in  the 
ACWY-4 and ACWY-2 groups, were enrolled at visit 9 (40 months of age) and visit 10 (60 months of 
age), respectively and served as a reference for immunogenicity analyses. 
Study population /Sample size 
Subjects who participated in the V59P14 trial were recruited for this extension study. 
Target  enrollment  for  this  extension  study  was  500  subjects.  A  total  of  approximately  400  subjects 
who participated in study V59P14 were to be enrolled (ACWY-4 and ACWY-2) at 40 and 60 months of 
age.  Additionally,  a  total  of  approximately  50  naïve  subjects  40  months  of  age  (Naive40)  and  60 
months  of  age  (Naive60)  were  to  be  recruited  age-matched  with  ACWY-4  and  ACWY-2  at  visit  9  and 
10, respectively. 
Children  eligible  to  be  enrolled  in  the  study  were  those  whose  parents  provided  written  informed 
consent,  and  who  were  generally  in  good  health  based  on  the  clinical  judgment  of  the  investigators. 
ACWY-4  and  ACWY-2  subjects  should  have  participated  in  the  original  V59P14  study  and  have  been 
40±3 months of age at the time of the 40-month visit (visit 9) and 60±3 months of age at the time of 
the 60-month visit (visit 10).  
Naive 40 and Naive60 subjects were healthy, meningococcal vaccine-naive children aged 40±3 months 
(visit 9) or 60±3 months (visit 10), respectively, at the time of enrollment. 
Serious,  acute,  or  chronic  illnesses  were  reasons  for  exclusion.  Other  exclusion  criteria  included  the 
following: 
▫ Subjects who received any  vaccine (excluding influenza  vaccines) 28 days  preceding the enrollment 
visit.  Influenza  vaccines  (including  FluMist®)  were  excluded  for  the  14  days  prior  to  the  enrollment 
visit. 
▫  Subjects  who  received  any  meningococcal  vaccine  since  birth  (Naive60) or  last  study  vaccination  in 
the V59P14 trial (ACWY-4 and ACWY-2). 
Treatments 
Novartis  MenACWY  [Lot  Numbers:  (vial/prefilled  syringe;  PFS)  Lot  no.  091601A  (expiry  date  April, 
2013);  (vial/vial)  Lot  no.  M11016  (expiry  date  August,  2012)]  was  obtained  by  extemporaneous 
mixing  just  before  injection  of  the  lyophilized  MenA  component  with  the  liquid  MenCWY  component. 
One 0.5 mL dose of MenACWY was administered by intramuscular (IM) injection in the left deltoid. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity Endpoints: 
Primary 
▫ Percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥1:8 for serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y. 
Menveo 
P46 029 
Page 42/69 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Secondary 
▫ Percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥1:4 for serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y; 
▫ hSBA GMTs. 
Safety Endpoints 
▫ The percentages of subjects with solicited local and systemic AEs within 7 days after vaccination with 
MenACWY. 
▫ The percentages of subjects with unsolicited AEs within 7 days after vaccination with MenACWY and 
SAEs, medically attended AEs, and AEs resulting in premature withdrawal for 28 days after vaccination 
at 60 months (from visit 10 through visit 11). 
Statistical Methods 
There  is  no  statistical  hypothesis  associated  with  the  immunogenicity  objective.  All  analyses  are 
descriptive. The primary analysis was performed on the per protocol set (PPS). 
Primary measures of immunogenicity: 
Percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA  .1:8  and  associated  2-sided  95%  Clopper-Pearson  confidence 
intervals (CIs) were computed for each serogroup and for each vaccination group and visit. There is no 
formal statistical hypothesis associated with this endpoint.  
Secondary measures of immunogenicity: 
Persistence at 40 and 60 months of age in subjects previously vaccinated with MenACWY as infants or 
toddlers  in  study  V59P14.  The  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA  titer  ≥1:4  against  N.  meningitidis 
serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y and associated 2 sided 95% Clopper- Pearson CIs were calculated and 
presented by vaccine group. For subjects in the Naive60 group, the percentages of subjects with hSBA 
≥1:8 were also calculated. 
Geometric  mean  titers  (GMT)  at  the  three  timepoints  (visits  9,  10,  11)  were  calculated  for  each 
serogroup  and  for  each  vaccine  group  with  available  data  at  the  visits.  The  hSBA  titers  were 
logarithmically  transformed  (base10)  and  GMTs  and  associated  2-sided  95%  CIs  computed  by 
exponentiating (base10) the corresponding log-transformed means and 95% confidence limits for the 
log-transformed means. These were obtained from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with vaccine group 
and center as effects in the model. Titers below the limit of detection were set to half that limit for the 
purposes of the analysis. Titers reported as being above a cutoff value, were set to that cutoff value in 
the analyses. 
Immune response at 1 month after vaccination with MenACWY 
The  percentage  of  subjects  in  ACWY-4,  ACWY-2  and  Naive60  groups  with  hSBA≥1:8,  hSBA≥1:4 
against  N.  meningitidis  serogroups  A,  C,  W  and  Y  and  associated  two  sided  95%  Clopper-  Pearson 
confidence interval (CIs) were calculated at baseline (Visit 10) and 1 month after vaccination (Visit 11) 
for each serogroup and were presented by vaccine group 
Geometric  Mean  Titer  (GMT)  at  the  three  timepoints  (visits  9,  10,  11)  was  calculated  for  each 
serogroup  and  for  each  vaccine  group  with  available  data  at  the  visit.  The  hSBA  titers  were 
logarithmically transformed (base10).

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Date of first enrollment: July 26, 2010 
Date of last visit: April 23, 2013 
A total of 335 subjects from the parent V59P14 were enrolled in the extension study at the 40 month 
time point, including 214 subjects in the ACWY-4 group and 121 subjects in the ACWY-2 group. A total 
of 225 subjects remained enrolled at the 60 month time point, including 136 subjects in the ACWY-4 
group, and 89 subjects in ACWY-2 group. In the Naive 60 group, 45 subjects age-matched to subjects 
in the ACWY-4 and ACWY-2 groups were enrolled at the 60 months age visit. 
In total, 4 subjects were early terminated from the study between visit 10 and visit 11. 
Baseline data 
The mean age of subjects at enrollment was 59.7 months, 59.6 months and 60 months in the ACWY-4, 
ACWY-2 and Naive60 groups, respectively (Table 11.2-1). There were more males than females in both 
the ACWY-4 (53% and 47%, respectively) and ACWY-2 (53% and 47% respectively) vaccine groups. 
Menveo 
P46 029

The Naive60 group had more females (58%) than males (42%). The most commonly reported ethnic 
origin in all 3 groups was Caucasian (44% to 67% across groups). 
Weight  and  height  were  not  measured  at  60  months  of  age  (visit  10)  for  subjects  in  ACWY-4  and 
ACWY-2 groups. Mean weight and height of subjects enrolled in the Naïve 60 group were 20.06 kg and 
110.71 cm, respectively (Table 11.2-1). 
Efficacy results 
The percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 against 4 serogroups at 60 months of age are presented 
in Table 11.4.1-1. 
Specifically, for groups ACWY-2, ACWY-4, and Naive60, the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 
against serogroup A were 25%, 6% and 2%, respectively; 43%, 27% and 22% for serogroup C; 74%, 
69%, and 40% for serogroup W-135; and 69%, 56%, and 25% for serogroup Y. 
Antibody  levels  against  serogroups  W  and  Y  were  higher  for  both  groups  than  background  rates  of 
bactericidal  antibodies  in  age-matched  naive  control  (Naive60).  For  serogroups  A  and  C,  antibody 
levels were higher than those of naive control (Naive60) for subjects who had received 1 or 2 doses of 
MenACWY (ACWY-2) in the parent study. Among subjects who received the 4-dose infant series in the 
parent study (ACWY-4), antibody levels against serogroups A and C were generally only slightly higher 
than those of naive control (Naive60).

CHMP’s comments 
Note that in the ACWY-4 group  the antibody levels are not much different to those in the naïve group. 
Similarly for MenC, where 95% CIs also overlap. 
The  antibody  response  was  assessed  at  2,7,12,13,  40  and  60  months  of  age  in  subjects  for  whom 
serological  data  from  the  V59P14  study  were  available  as  measured  by  the  percentages  of  subjects 
with hSBA ≥ 1:8 and GMTs. The persistence of bactericidal antibodies in children 40 and 60 months of 
age  previously  vaccinated  with  MenACWY  was  also  evaluated  as  measured  by  hSBA  GMTs  and 
percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥1:4 against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y.  
The antibody response of MenACWY given at 60 months of age in children who had previously received 
at  least  one  dose  of  Novartis  MenACWY  vaccine  in  study  V59P14  was  compared  to  the  antibody 
response  to  one  dose  of  MenACWY  in  meningococcal  vaccine-naive  subjects.  This  was  measured  by 
percentage  of  subjects  with  seroresponse,  percentage  of  subjects  with  hSBA  titers  „d  1:8,  and 
percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 1:4 directed against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, 
and Y at 28 days postvaccination. 
The results are presented in the tables below.

The  ratio  of  the  least  square  GMTs  was  significantly  higher  than  1  for  all  serogroups  for  both  the 
ACWY-4 vs. Naive60 comparison as well as for the ACWY-2 vs. Naive60 comparison (lower limit of the 
2-sided 95% CI for the vaccine group ratio was greater than 1). Additionally, the ratio of the ACWY-4 
vs. ACWY-2 least square GMTs was significantly lower than 1 for serogroups A and C (upper limit of the 
2-sided 95% CI for the vaccine group ratio was less than 1; Table 11.4.1-5). 
CHMP’s comments 
Antibody  persistence is  greater  among  subjects  in  the  MenACWY2  group  compared  to  those  who  had 
received  the  4-dose  infant  series  –  this  is  likely  attributable  to  the  age  at  when  the  final  dose  was 
received  or  could  reflect  the  maturity  of  the  immune  system  at  the  time  of  priming.  The  low 
Menveo 
P46 029

persistence  for  MenA  seen  here  is  in  line  with  earlier  observations  in  other  studies  and  resulted  in  a 
warning  in  the  SmPC.  Moreover,  an  update  of  section  4.2  based  upon  further  persistence  data  is 
currently being considered in variation II/42. Note that the MAH indicates that an increasing numbers 
of  publications  are  suggesting  that  hSBA  need  not  be  an  optimal  assay  for  persistence  assessment, 
especially  for  serogroup  A.  The  greatest  difference  observed  between  immunogenicity  results  using 
hSBA and rSBA assays. A discrepancy could be attributable to known differences between assays due 
to  differences  in  target  strain  susceptibilities  for  the  complement  sources  (Findlow  H,  2009,  Poolman 
JT, 2011).  
The  response  to  vaccination  with  MenACWY  is  clearly  better  in  those  subjects  vaccinated  previously 
with MenACWY compared tot the Naive60 group.  
As the present data are collected in subjects outside the indication and do not add to what is already 
known about the vaccine they do not need to be included in the SmPC. 
Safety results 
All subjects received a single dose of MenACWY on day 1, at approximately 60 months of age. Subjects 
in group ACWY-4 had previously received 4 doses of MenACWY, at 2, 4, 6 and 12 or 13 months of age; 
those  in  study  group  ACWY-2  had  previously  received  either  2  doses  of  MenACWY,  at  12  and  15 
months or at 13 and 15 months of age, or a single dose of MenACWY at 18 months of age. Subjects in 
study  group  Naïve-60  had  not  previously  received  any  MenACWY  vaccination.  Among  all  treated 
subjects, 98% in both the ACWY-4 and ACWY-2 study groups were included in the overall safety set, 
while 100% of the subjects in the Naive60 group constituted the overall safety set. 
Local and systemic solicited AEs 
The  frequencies  of  subjects  who  reported  solicited  AEs  in  any  category  were  similar  between  the 
AWCY-4 and ACWY-2 study groups, and were somewhat higher in the Naive60 group. Among subjects 
in  the  ACWY-4,  ACWY-2,  and  Naive60  groups,  62%,  64%,  and  76%,  respectively,  reported  any 
solicited AEs; 52%, 53%, and 59%, respectively, reported any local solicited AEs; and 35%, 31%, and 
47%,  respectively,  reported  any  systemic  solicited  AEs.  Any  other  indicator  of  reactogenicity  was 
reported by 13% to 14% of subjects for all 3 study groups. Severe local AEs were reported by 7% and 
11%  of  subjects  in  the  ACWY-4  and  ACWY-2  groups,  respectively,  versus  14%  of  subjects  in  the 
Naive60 group.

The  most  commonly  reported  was  pain,  in  42%,  40%,  and  49%  of  subjects,  respectively.  Smaller 
percentages  of  subjects  reported  each  of  the  other  local  solicited  AEs:  20%,  24%,  and  27%, 
respectively, reported erythema and 14%, 17%, and 20%, respectively, reported induration. For each 
of  these  local  AEs,  differences  between  groups  were  small,  and  did  not  approach  statistical 
significance. None of the subjects reported severe pain. Severe erythema (> 100 mm) was reported by 
2  subjects  (2%)  in  the  ACWY-4  group,  none  in  the  ACWY—2  group,  and  one  in  the  Naive60  group, 
while severe induration (> 100 mm) was reported by a single subject in the ACWY-4 group and none 
of the subjects in the ACWY-2 and Naive60 groups. 
The  most  commonly  reported  were  irritability,  reported  by  19%,  17%,  and  16%  of  subjects, 
respectively, and sleepiness, reported by 16%, 11%, and 14% of subjects, respectively. The only other 
systemic  solicited  AE  reported  by  >  10%  of  subjects  in  either  group  was  change  in  eating  habits, 
reported  by  11%,  6%,  and  8%  of  subjects,  respectively.  There  were  no  appreciable  patterns  in  the 
frequencies of AEs among the study groups. 
Unsolicited AEs 
Previously vaccinated subjects: 
From  day  1  through  day  7  postvaccination,  a  total  of  7%,  8%,  and  12%  of  subjects  in  the  ACWY-4, 
ACWY-2, and Naive60 study groups, respectively, reported 1 or more unsolicited AEs. The only AEs, by 
preferred term, reported by more than 2 subjects in any group were pyrexia, in 3 (2%), 1 (1%), and 2 
(4%)  subjects  in  the  ACWY-4,  ACWY-2,  and  Naive60  groups,  respectively,  and  cough,  in  2  (2%),  3 
(3%),  and  0  subjects  in  the  ACWY-4,  ACWY-2,  and  Naive60  groups,  respectively.  The  only  SOCs  in 
which  more  than  2  subjects  in  any  group  reported an  AE  were  “general  disorders  and  administration 
site conditions” (4 (3%), 2 (2%), and 3 (6%) subjects in the ACWY-4, ACWY-2, and Naive60 groups, 
respectively), and “respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders”(with 3 (2%), 3 (3%), and 1 (2%) 
subjects in the 3 groups,  respectively), and  “infections and infestations” (with 2  (2%), 0 and 3 (6%) 
subjects in the 3 groups, respectively; Table 12.2.3-2). 
The only AE, from day 1 through day 7 postvaccination that was considered at least possibly related to 
vaccination  by  more  than  1  subject  was  pyrexia:  it  was  considered  at  least  possibly  related  in  4 
subjects across 3 study groups (Table 12.2.3-2).  
From day 8 postvaccination through study termination (nominally 28 days postvaccination), a total of 
8%,  13%,  and  10%  of  subjects  in  the  ACWY-4,  ACWY-2,  and  Naive60  study  groups,  respectively, 
reported  1  or  more  unsolicited  medically-attended  AEs.  The  only  AEs,  by  preferred  term,  reported  in 
more than 2 subjects in any study group was conjunctivitis, in 0, 1 (1%), and 3 (6%) subjects in the 
ACWY-4, ACWY-2, and Naive60 groups, respectively. The only SOCs in which AEs were reported, from 
day  8  postvaccination  through  study  termination,  by  more  than  2  subjects  in  any  group  were 
“infections and infestations,” reported by 8 (6%), 6 (7%), and 1 (2%) subjects in the ACWY-4, ACWY-
2,  and  Naive60  groups,  respectively,  “respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders,”  reported  by  1 
(1%), 1 (1%), and 3 (6%) subjects in the 3 groups, respectively, and ”eye disorders,” reported by 0, 1 
(1%), and 3 (6%) subjects in the 3 groups, respectively.

There were no deaths or SAEs in this study. No subject withdrew prematurely from the study due to an 
AE.  
Chronic  conditions  with  new  onset  reported  from  termination  of  the  parent  study  (V59P14),  at 
approximately  18  through  21  months  of  age,  through  Visit  10  of  the  current  study,  at  approximately 
60 months of age, were recorded for subjects in the ACWY-4 and ACWY-2 groups. 
The  most  commonly  reported  chronic  conditions  with  new  onset  in  the  ACWY-4  and  ACWY-2  groups 
were asthma (13% and 10% of subjects, respectively) and allergic rhinitis (8% and 5%, respectively).

In  addition,  3%  of  subjects  in  each  group  reported  ‘contact  dermatitis  and  other  eczema’  as  a  new 
chronic  disease.  Other  than  ‘certain  adverse  effects  not  elsewhere  classified’  in  the  injury  and 
poisoning  SOC,  no  other  chronic  condition,  by  preferred  term,  was  reported  in  more  than  2%  of 
subjects  in  either  the  ACWY-4  or  ACWY-2  group.  Among  subjects  in  the  Naive60  group,  the  most 
commonly reported new chronic conditions, by preferred term, were ‘specific delays in development’ in 
6 subjects (13%), ‘personal history of allergy to medicinal agents’, asthma and ‘certain adverse effects 
not elsewhere classified’, each in 4 subjects (9%), and allergic rhinitis and ‘contact dermatitis or other 
eczema’, each in 3 subjects (7%). 
The  profile  of  new  onset  chronic  conditions  reported  by  subjects  since  the  end  of  the  parent  study 
V59P14 is consistent with diseases typical for the age group enrolled, suggesting acceptable longterm 
vaccine safety.  
CHMP’s comments 
No  safety  concerns  were  identified  during  the  study.  The  frequencies  of  solicited  AEs  were  similar  to 
the previously reported in this age group.

Description 
This  phase  III  open  label,  randomized,  controlled,  multicentre  study  aimed  to  evaluate  the 
immunogenicity  and  safety  of  four  doses  of  MenACWY  when  administered  concomitantly  with  routine 
vaccines to healthy infants at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age, conducted in US, Canada and Australia. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary Immunogenicity Objectives 
1. To assess the sufficiency of the immune response following 4 doses of MenACWY vaccine given at 2, 
4, 6 and 12 months in healthy infants in terms of the proportion of subjects with an hSBA ≥1:8 at 1 
month post vaccination, for each of the four meningococcal vaccine serogroups. 
Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives 
1. To evaluate the hSBA GMTs after 4 doses of MenACWY at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months against each of the 
four MenACWY serogroups.  
2.  To  evaluate  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  post  vaccination  hSBA  ≥1:8,  fourfold  rise,  and  hSBA 
GMTs after 3 doses of MenACWY at 2, 4, and 6 months against each of the four MenACWY serogroups. 
3.  To  demonstrate  that  the  immune  responses  to  routine  concomitant  vaccinations  (pneumococcal, 
IPV,  HBV,  Hib,  DTaP)  are  non-inferior  when  given  with  MenACWY  compared  with  when  given  without 
MenACWY. 
4. To assess the persistence of MenACWY immune responses at 12 months of age prior to the fourth 
dose.  
5.  To  evaluate  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  four-fold  rise  in  hSBA  at  1  month  post  4th  dose  as 
compared to the pre-4th dose hSBA against each of the four MenACWY serogroups.

Safety Objectives 
To assess the safety of MenACWY when given concomitantly with routine infant vaccines at 2, 4, 6 and 
12 months of age (i.e., DTaP, IPV, pneumococcal conjugate, HBV and Hib at 2, 4 and 6 months of age 
and MMR and pneumococcal conjugate at 12 months of age). 
Study design 
This  was  an  open  label,  randomized,  controlled,  multicentre  study.  Eligible  subjects  were  randomized 
at visit 1 to receive either MenACWY and concomitant routine vaccines or routine vaccines only in a 1:1 
ratio.  Group  1  subjects  received  four  injections  of  MenACWY  plus  concomitant  routine  vaccinations. 
Group  2  subjects  received  only  routine  vaccination  through  the  time  of  the  blood  draw  at  13  month 
visit,  with  one  dose  of  MenACWY  given  at  18  months  of  age.  An  overview  of  the  study  design  is 
provided below. 
Study population /Sample size 
Health infants (aged 55-89 days at enrolment) who were born after an estimated gestational age ≥37 
weeks and a birth weight of ≥ 2.5 kg, without any history of confirmed or suspected disease caused by 
agents to which vaccination was intended nor with a history of vaccination with vaccines given in study 
(meningococcal, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio (IPV), H. influenzae type b (Hib) or pneumococcus 
vaccines). 
A total of 520 subjects (260 subjects per group) were planned to be enrolled in the study.  
Treatments 
Group  1:  MenACWY  conjugate  vaccine  along  with  routine  vaccinations  intramuscularly  at  2,  4,  6  and 
12 months of age.  
Group 2: Routine vaccinations intramuscularly at 2,  4, 6, and 12 months of age. In addition subjects 
were offered a dose of MenACWY  conjugate vaccine at 18 months as a benefit of participating in this 
study.

Safety  was  assessed  for  all  subjects  in  terms  of  the  frequency  and  percentage  of  subjects  with 
reported SAEs or medically attended AEs. 
Statistical Methods 
Primary Immunogenicity Objectives: 
a. The primary immunogenicity objective was to show sufficiency of the immune response as measured 
by  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  serum  bactericidal  activity  (hSBA)  ≥1:8  at  1  month  following  the  
fourth dose of MenACWY given to infants at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age. 
H0: PMenA ≤0. 80 or PMenC ≤0.85 or PMenW ≤0.85 or PMenY ≤0.85 
H1: PMenA >0.80 and PMenC >0.85 and PMenW >0.85 and PMenY >0.85 
Where  PMenA,  C,  W,  or  Y  was  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  hSBA  ≥1:8  at  1  month  following  the 
fourth dose of MenACWY. The study was considered a success if the lower limit of the 95% CI for each 
serogroup met the levels as specified above. 
Key Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives: 
a.  The  null  hypothesis  associated  with  the  pertussis  non-inferiority  objective  was  that  for  either  PT, 
FHA,  pertactin,  or  FIM,  the  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  for  the  ratio  of  the  GMCs 
(GMCMenACWY +Pentacel / GMCPentacel) at 1 month after the 6-month vaccination (third dose) was 
less than or equal to 0.67. 
H0: GMCMenACWY +Pentacel / GMCPentacel ≤0.67 
H1: GMCMenACWY +Pentacel / GMCPentacel >0.67 
The  other  key  secondary  endpoint  for  the  pertussis  antigens  non-inferiority  assessments  was  the 
percentage of subjects with seroresponse at 1 month after the 6-month vaccination. 
H0: PMenACWY+Pentacel – PPentacel ≤-10% 
H1: PMenACWY+Pentacel – PPentacel >-10% 
b. The null hypothesis associated with the pneumococcal non-inferiority objective was that  for any of 
the seven serotypes in Prevnar/Prevenar, the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the ratio of the 
GMCs  (GMCMenACWY  +  Prevnar  /  GMCPrevnar  )  at  1  month  after  the  12-month  vaccination  (fourth 
dose) was less than or equal to 0.50. 
H0: GMCMenACWY + Prevnar / GMCPrevnar ≤0. 50 
H1: GMCMenACWY + Prevnar / GMCPrevnar >0.50 
The  other  key  secondary  endpoint  for  the  pneumococcal  non-inferiority  assessments  was  the 
percentage of subjects with antibody level ≥0.35 μg/mL at 1 month after dose 3. 
H0: PMenACWY+Prevnar – PPrevnar ≤-10% 
H1: PMenACWY+Prevnar – PPrevnar >-10% 
c.  The  null  hypothesis  associated  with  other  key  secondary  non-inferiority  immunogenicity  objectives 
was  that,  for  Hib,  diphtheria,  tetanus,  poliovirus  and  HBV  antigens  administered  with  and  without 
MenACWY,  the  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  for  the  difference  between  the  groups  (PRoutine 
Menveo 
P46 029 
Page 57/69 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Vaccine  +  MenACWY  minus  PRoutine  Vaccine)  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  antibody  response 
greater than or equal to the antigen-specific cut-off level was ≤-10% (-5% for the polio antigens) 
H0 PRoutine Vaccine + MenACWY – PRoutine Vaccine ≤-Δ% 
H1 PRoutine Vaccine + MenACWY – PRoutine Vaccine >-Δ% 
Where -Δ% is -5% for polio antigens and -10% for all others.  
The primary and secondary objectives were based on the PP populations which included subjects who 
received  all  vaccinations,  provided  blood  draws  within  a  pre-specified  window,  and  had  no  major 
protocol deviations. The primary objective was also assessed using the modified intent to treat (MITT) 
population.  Subjects  who  were  exposed  but  excluded  from  the  per  protocol  analyses  for 
immunogenicity were still evaluable for safety. 
To address the multiplicity issue the non-inferiority testing was performed sequentially. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 529 subjects were enrolled and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either MenACWY 
concomitantly  with  routine  vaccines  (N=258)  or  routine  vaccines  alone  (N=271).  A  total  of  525 
(255+270)  subjects  were  analyzed  for  safety,  411  (202+209)  subjects  were  included  in  infant  per 
protocol (PP) analysis and 352 (172+180) subjects were included in toddler PP analysis. 
Baseline data 
The demographic and other baseline characteristics were similar between subjects receiving MenACWY 
concomitantly  with  routine  vaccines  vaccination  (Group  1)  and  those  receiving  only  routine 
vaccinations (Group 2).

Efficacy results 
Primary objective: 
One  month  post-toddler  dose  (13  months),  89%,  95%,  97%  and  96%  of  the  subjects  in  Group  1 
achieved  an  hSBA  ≥1:8  against  serogroups  A,  C,  W  and  Y,  respectively.  The  percentages  were  very 
low (1%-7%) in the routine vaccination only group (Group 2). The lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI 
(83%, 90%, 93% and 92%) were greater than 80%, 85%, 85% and 85% for MenA, MenC, MenW and 
MenY, respectively in subjects who received MenACWY vaccination (Table 11.4.1-1). Thus, the primary 
objective was met. 
Secondary Objectives: 
1.  Immune  response  after  three  doses  of  infant  vaccination  series  (PP  infant  MenACWY 
Population) 
hSBA ≥1:8 
At baseline (day 1), the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 were similar between the two groups 
(A:  2%  vs,  1%,  C:  7%  each,  W:  13%  vs.  15%,  Y:  8%  vs.  4%).  One  month  postinfant  series 
Menveo 
P46 029 
Page 59/69 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
vaccination  (7  months),  76%,  94%,  98%  and  94%  of  the  subjects  in  Group  1  achieved  hSBA  ≥1:8 
against serogroups A, C, W and Y, respectively. The percentages remained very low (1%-3%) after the 
infant series in routine vaccination only group (Group 2) (Table 11.4.1-2). 
At Least Four-Fold Rise in hSBA 
One  month  post-infant  series  vaccination  (7  months),  78%,  94%,  93%  and  93%  of  the  subjects  in 
Group  1  had  at  least  four-fold  rise  in  hSBA  against  serogroups  A,  C,  W  and  Y,  respectively.  The 
percentages  were  very  low  (1%-2%)  after  the  infant  series  routine  vaccination  only  group  (Group  2) 
(Table 11.4.1-2). 
hSBA GMTs 
The hSBA GMTs in Group 1 increased over the baseline (A: 2.09 to 21, C: 2.49 to 74, W: 2.94 to 79, 
Y:  2.52  to  51)  while  those  in  Group  2  remained  at  the  similar  levels  of  baseline  against  each  of  the 
serogroups (Table 11.4.1-2). 
Similar responses in terms of  hSBA  ≥1:8 and  hSBA GMTs were observed in the subset of the infants 
who continued in the study to receive a toddler dose (PP toddler MenACWY population; Table 11.4.1-
3). 
2. Persistence of MenACWY immune responses at 12 months of age 
Prior to toddler dose (12 months), 37%, 70% and 53% of the subjects in Group 1 maintained an hSBA 
≥1:8  against  serogroups  C,  W  and  Y,  respectively.  The  percentages  were  low  against  serogroup  A  in 
Group 1 (7%) and also against all serogroups in Group 2 (2%-5%) (Table 11.4.1-3). 
hSBA GMTs and associated 95% CI were assessed at 12 months of age prior to the fourth dose. The 
hSBA  GMTs  were  higher  in  Group  1  compared  with  those  in  Group  2  for  the  serogroups  C  (5.98  vs. 
2.15), W (15 vs. 2.23) and Y (8.39 vs. 2.09) while the hSBA GMTs were similar for serogroup A (2.52 
vs. 2.12) (Table 11.4.1-3).

In line with results from earlier studies the persistence for MenA is very poor between the 3rd dose of 
MenACWY at 6 months and the subsequent dose at 12 months. A strong decline in antibodies against 
MenC is also seen, from 96% after the 3rd dose to 37% prior to the fourth.  
3. hSBA GMTs after 4 doses of MenACWY (Toddler MenACWY PP Population)  
One  month  after  the  toddler  dose  (13  months  of  age),  the  hSBA  GMTs  in  Group  1  were  significantly 
higher  compared to  Group  2  for  all  vaccine  serogroups  (A:  54  vs.  1.87,  C:  135  vs.  1.94,  W:  215  vs. 
2.15; Y: 185 vs. 1.89) (Table 11.4.1-3; Figure 11.4.1-1).

4. At least four-fold rise in hSBA after toddler dose (PP Toddler MenACWY Population) 
One month post-toddler dose (13 months of age), 89%, 92%, 95% and 96% of the subjects in Group 
1 had at least four-fold rise in hSBA against serogroups A, C, W and Y, respectively. The percentages 
remained very low (1%-2%) after the 12-month vaccination in the routine vaccination group (Group 2) 
(Table 11.4.1-3). 
5. Immune responses to routine vaccine antigens 
The  ratio  of  GMCs  (GMCMenACWY  +  Pentacel  GMCPentacel)  for  the  pertussis  antigens  ranged  from 
1.02  –  1.09  with  the  lower  limit  of  two  sided  95% CI  (0.81  to  0.9)  being  greater  than  0.67  for  each 
antigen. The non-inferiority objectives for pertussis antigens after infant series in terms of GMC  were 
demonstrated. 
The  lower  limit  of  two  sided  95%  CI  for  the  difference  in  the  seroresponse  rates  between  groups 
(PPentacel + MenACWY PPentacel) for FHA and pertactin was greater than -10% while for PT it was -
12.1% and for FIM it was -10.6%. 
Because the group difference for PT and FIM in the percentage of subjects with seroresponse did not 
meet the required non-inferiority criterion, the multiplicity procedure required that testing be stopped. 
Results post-infant series 
The lower limit of two sided 95% CI for the difference between the antibody response rates (PRoutine 
Vaccine + MenACWY minus PRoutine Vaccine) for diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and Hib was greater 
than  -10%  (met  non-inferiority  margin).  For  all  polio  antigens  (types  1,  2,  3)  the  difference  was 
greater than -5% (met non-inferiority margin). 
The  difference  between  Group  1  and  Group  2  in  percentage  of  subjects  with  antibody  concentration 
≥0.35 μg/mL varied from 0 to -5%, the lower limit of 95% CI on the difference was greater than -10% 
(met non-inferiority margin) for all of the antigens except for PnC 6B (-10.3%) and PnC 23F (-11.4%). 
The  ratio  of  GMCs  (GMC  Routine  Vaccine  +  MenACWY  GMCRoutine  Vaccine)  or  GMTs  for  diphtheria, 
tetanus,  poliovirus,  HBV  and  Hib  antigens  ranged  from  0.83  –  1.36  with  the  lower  limit  of  two  sided 
Menveo 
P46 029 
Page 62/69 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
95% CI being greater than 0.50.The results demonstrated that the pre-defined equivalency criteria for 
these  antigens  were  achieved.  The  ratio  of  GMCs  (GMCMenACWY  +  routine  /  GMCRoutine)  for  the 
pneumococcal  antigens  ranged  from  0.79  –  0.96  with  the  lower  limit  of  two  sided  95%  CI  (0.62  to 
0.81) being greater than pre-defined margin of 0.5 for each antigen. 
Results post-toddler dose 
One month post-toddler dose (13 months), the ratio of GMCs (GMC MenACWY + Prevnar GMCPrevnar) 
for  the  pneumococcal  antigens  ranged  from  0.76  to  1.04  with  the  lower  limit  of  two  sided  95%  CI 
Menveo 
P46 029

being greater than 0.50 for all antigens. The lower  limit of 95% CI for the difference (P MenACWY + 
Prevnar  PPrevnar)  in  percentages  of  subjects  achieving  a  concentration  of  ≥0.35  µg/mL  was  greater 
than -10% (Group 1 non-inferior to Group 2) for all of the pneumococcal antigens. For percentage of 
subjects with the stricter cut-off antibody concentration ≥1.0 µg/mL, the lower limit of 95% CI on the 
difference between groups after the toddler dose was greater than -10% (met non-inferiority criteria) 
for PnC antigens PnC 6B, PnC 14, PnC 18C, PnC 19F and PnC 23F. 
Safety results 
Out of a total of 529 subjects enrolled in the study, 525 (99%) subjects were exposed to at least one 
study vaccination and provided safety data; these subjects were included in the safety analysis. 
Safety  was  assessed  for  all  subjects  in  terms  of  the  frequency  and  percentage  of  subjects  with 
reported SAEs or medically attended AEs. 
CHMP’s comments 
Note that reactogenicity, local and systemic, was not solicited during the study. 
During  the  infant  series  vaccination  (2-7  months),  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  AEs  were  similar 
between the vaccination groups (72% in Group 1 and 70% in Group 2) with low rates (2% and <1% 
subjects  in  the  respective  groups)  having  AEs  that  were  at  least  possibly  related  to  the  study 
vaccination. Between the third and fourth vaccination (7-12 months), the percentages of subjects with 
AEs were similar between the vaccination groups (75% in Group 1 and 74% in Group 2) with none of 
the  subjects  in  either  group  having  AEs  that  were  judged  to  be  related  to  the  study  vaccination. 
Twenty eight days after toddler dose at 12 months, the percentages of subjects with AEs were similar 
between  the  vaccination  groups  (36%  in  Group  1  and  35%  in  Group  2)  with  none  of  the  subjects  in 
either group having AEs that were judged to be related to the study vaccination. 
Adverse events 
The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  by  preferred  term  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infections  (56% 
57%,  similar  between  Group  1  and  Group  2)  followed  by  otitis  media  (39%  in  each  group), 
conjunctivitis  (23%  and  19%),  viral  infections  (15%  and  19%),  pyrexia  (17%  in  each  group), 
bronchiolitis (16% and 15%), gastroenteritis (15% and 12%), and dermatitis due to diaper (13% and 
15%). None of these AEs was judged to be related to the study vaccination.

The  most  commonly  affected  SOC  was  “Infections  and  Infestations”  (82%  in  Group  1  and  83%  in 
Group  2,  similar  in  both  groups),  followed  by  “Skin  and  Subcutaneous  Tissue  Disorders”  (42%  and 
39%),  “Respiratory,  Thoracic  &  Mediastinal  Disorders”  (30%  in  each  group),  “Gastrointestinal 
Disorders”  (29%  and  32%),  “Eye  Disorders”  (24%  and  20%)  and  “General  Disorders  and 
Administration Site Conditions” (22% and 20%).  
Very  few  subjects  (0-<1%  for  any  SOC)  had  AEs  judged  to  be  at  least  possibly  related  to  the  study 
vaccination (see table below).

Deaths, Serious adverse events and other significant adverse events 
No deaths were reported in this study. 21 (8%) subjects in Group 1 and 20 (7%) subjects in Group 2 
experienced  SAEs  with  none  of  the  SAEs  being  judged  to  be  related  to  the  study  vaccination.  Two 
subjects (Subject no. 28/0025 in Group 1 and Subject no. 28/0053 in Group 2) had seizures as SAEs. 
In the opinion of the investigator these SAEs were unrelated to the study vaccine. 
Subject No. 28/0025: Febrile Seizure and Enteroviral Meningitis 
This  subject  was  vaccinated  concomitantly  with  MenACWY,  Pentacel  Prevnar,  and  RotaTeq  on  23  FEB 
2010,  26  APR  2010  and  30  JUN  2010.  On  08  SEP  2010  (70  days  after  the  third  vaccination),  the 
subject suffered a  new onset of seizure (assessed as non-serious AE by the investigator). On 13 SEP 
2010 (75 days after the third vaccination), he was hospitalized after he experienced a fever of 103.4° 
F and a tonic-clonic seizure lasting 30 seconds. There were no further high fevers nor seizures noted 
during  the  hospitalization.  Neurological  exam  was  non-focal.  Cerebrospinal  fluid  was  positive  for 
enterovirus  by  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  testing.  The  subject  was  diagnosed  with  enteroviral 
meningitis and possible febrile seizure, treated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and was discharged 
on 14 SEP 2010. The subject had fully recovered from the febrile seizure and enteroviral meningitis by 
13  SEP  2010  and  16  SEP  2010,  respectively.  The  study  dropped  out  of  the  study  as  a  result  of  the 
event. 
Subject No. 28/0053: Seizure (non-febrile).

This subject was vaccinated with routine vaccinations Pentacel, Prevnar, RotaTeq on 30 MAR 2010, 01 
JUN 2010, 03 AUG 2010, Engerix-B on 30 MAR 2010, 03 AUG 2010 and Prevnar and MMR II on 07 FEB 
2011;  Fluzone  on  05  NOV  2010  and  07  MAR  2011,  hepatitis  B  vaccine  on  05  NOV  2010,  hepatitis  A 
vaccine on 07 MAR 2011, and varicella vaccine on 07 MAR 2011. Prior to study period, the subject was 
vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine on 03 FEB 2010. 
The subject was in the control group and did not receive study vaccine. On 17 MAR 2011(39 days after 
the  fourth  vaccinations  with  Prevnar  and  MMR  II),  the  subject  experienced  a  viral  syndrome  and 
vomiting.  The  subject  was  treated  with  azithromycin  and  albuterol.  On  the  same  day,  one  hour  after 
symptom onset, the subject experienced a seizure episode and was admitted to the hospital. Chest x-
ray was normal. The subject was treated with levetiracetam. The subject recovered from the events on 
19  MAR  2011.  On  23  MAR  2011,  upon  discharge  from  hospital,  the  subject  was  noted  to  sustain  an 
episode  of  “eyes  rolled  back”  for  one  minute  duration.  No  further  seizures  were  noted.  The  subject 
dropped out of the study as a result of the event. 
CHMP’s comments 
It is agreed with the MAH that these serious AEs are unlikely related to the study medication. 
III. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  MAH  submitted  the  clinical  study  reports  of  6  recently  completed  studies  involving  the  use  of 
MenACWY in the paediatric population, as per Article 46 of the European Paediatric Regulation (EC N0 
1901/2006).  Of  these  6  paediatric  studies,  4  were  in  children  2  years  of  age  and  above  (studies 
V59_39,  V59_40,  V59_49,  and  V59_50)  and  2  in  children  <  2  years  of  age  (studies  V59_33  and 
V59P14E1). 
Thee  studies  evaluated  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  MenACWY  in  different  age  group  for 
registrational  purposes  in  Korea,  Taiwan  and  Russia  (V59P39,  V59P49  and  V59P50).  The  findings  of 
these  studies  are  largely  in  line  with  those  of  studies  previously  submitted  by  the  MAH  to  support 
immunogenicity  and  safety  of  MenACWY  in  children  aged  2  to  18  years  of  age.  No  safety  concerns 
were  identified  during  the  studies.  The  frequencies  of  solicited  AEs  were  similar  to  those  previously 
reported in this age group. 
Two  studies  considered  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  MenACWY  and  routine  vaccines  following 
concomitant vaccination (V59P33, V59P40). The main findings of these studies are in line with findings 
from previous interaction studies with the same vaccines in similar age groups; namely that MenACWY 
can  safely  be  given  with  routine  vaccinations  (pneumococcal,  IPV,  HBV,  Hib,  DTaP,  Tdap).  In  Study 
V59P40  too  the  response  to  FHA  and  PRN  is  significantly  lower  (albeit  non-inferiority  was 
demonstrated)  when  Tdap  is  given  concomitantly  with  MenACWY,  confirming  earlier  findings  from 
study  V59P18.  This  information  is  already  reflected  in  section  4.5  of  the  SmPC,  i.e.  that  there  is 
evidence  to  suggest  negative  effect  of  concomitant  vaccination  with  MenACWY  and  HPV  on  the 
response to pertussis antigens FHA and PRN yet the clinical relevance is unknown. 
For  study  V59P40  the  immunogenicity  analysis  for  the  second  primary  objective  (assessment  of 
immune response against HPV antigens) are yet to be presented in an addendum to the clinical study 
report as soon as results are available. The MAH should provide these results when available.

Finally,  the  MAH  also  submitted  the  60  months  data  from  study  V59P14Ee1  of  which  the  40  month 
data have been previously submitted. These data showed that antibody persistence is greater among 
subjects who received the 2 dose series compared to those who had received the 4-dose infant series 
This is likely attributable to the age at when the final dose was received or could reflect the maturity of 
the immune system at the time of priming. The low persistence for MenA seen in V59P14Ee1 is in line 
with  earlier  observations  in  other  studies  which  resulted  in  a  warning  in  the  SmPC.  Moreover,  an 
update  of  section  4.2  based  upon  further  persistence  data  is  currently  being  considered  in  variation 
II/42. Note that the MAH indicates that an increasing number of publications is suggesting that hSBA 
need  not  be  an  optimal  assay  for  persistence  assessment,  especially  for  serogroup  A.  A  discrepancy 
observed between the results with the rSBA (which shows good persistence for MenA) and hSBA assay 
(which  shows  poor  persistence  for  MenA)  could  be  attributable  to  known  differences  between  assays 
due  to  differences  in  target  strain  susceptibilities  for  the  complement  sources  (Findlow  H,  2009, 
Poolman  JT,  2011).  This  would  merit  further  discussion  in  future  in  order  to  see  whether  the  poor 
persistence of antibodies as measured with the hSBA assay reflects a true decline in Abs. Importantly, 
the  response  to  vaccination  with  MenACWY  is  clearly  better  in  those  subjects  vaccinated  previously 
with MenACWY compared tot the Naive60 group pointing towards good priming for all serogroups. 
With regards to the safety data from these 6 studies, these  are largely in line with the  known safety 
profile of MenACWY. The incidence of solicited AEs in different age groups is similar to that previously 
reported.  No  new  safety  concerns  were  identified.  The  MAH  could  include  the  safety  data  from 
studies in children aged ≥2 years in section 4.8 to add to the body of evidence in support of 
the good safety profile of this vaccine. This could be done with a future type II variation. 
IV. 
Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
It  is  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  the  data  submitted  does  not  change  the  benefit-risk  balance  of 
MenACWY, which remains positive. 
The MAH  has  not proposed any changes to the Product Information which is  largely agreed however, 
the MAH could include the safety data from studies in children aged ≥2 years in section 4.8 to add to 
the  body  of  evidence  in  support  of  the  good  safety  profile  of  this  vaccine.  This  could  be  done  with  a 
future type II variation. 
Secondly, it is advised that the MAH should provide the assessment of immune response against HPV 
antigens from study V59P40 when available.

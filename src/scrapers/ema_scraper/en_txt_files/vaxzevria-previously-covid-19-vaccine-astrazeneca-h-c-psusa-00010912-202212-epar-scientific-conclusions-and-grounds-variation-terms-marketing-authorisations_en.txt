Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S 
[recombinant]) (Vaxzevria), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on Venous Thromboembolism from the literature and spontaneous reports, 
the PRAC considers a causal relationship between COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) and 
Venous Thromboembolism is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product 
information of products containing COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) (Vaxzevria) should be 
amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) (Vaxzevria) 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing COVID-19 
Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) (Vaxzevria) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the 
product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

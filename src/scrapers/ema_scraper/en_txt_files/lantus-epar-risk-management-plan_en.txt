Summary of risk management plan for LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly OPTISULIN) 
(Insulin Glargine) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly 
OPTISULIN). The RMP details important risks of LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly OPTISULIN). 
how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained about 
LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly OPTISULIN)’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly OPTISULIN) summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its 
package leaflet (PL) give essential information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on 
how LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly OPTISULIN) should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly OPTISULIN) should be read in the 
context of all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its 
plain-language summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly OPTISULIN) RMP. 
I. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  
Insulin glargine 100 U/mL (LANTUS) is authorized for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, 
adolescents and children aged 2 years or above. 
Insulin glargine 300 U/mL (TOUJEO) is authorized for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, 
adolescents and children from the age of 6 years (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
Insulin Glargine as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneously. 
Further information about the evaluation of LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly OPTISULIN) benefits 
can be found in LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly OPTISULIN) EPAR, including in its plain-language 
summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage:

II. 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR 
FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS  
Important risks of LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly OPTISULIN), together with measures to minimize 
such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly 
OPTISULIN) risks, are outlined in the next sections.  
 
 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL 
and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly OPTISULIN), these measures are supplemented with 
additional risk minimization measures mentioned under relevant important risks, outlined in the 
next sections. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly OPTISULIN) 
is not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ outlined in the next section. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly OPTISULIN) are risks that need special risk 
management activities to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can 
be safely administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of LANTUS/TOUJEO (formerly 
OPTISULIN). Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further 
evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

To enhance differentiation (not only in countries where U100 vial and syringe 
are marketed) a different trade name is a way to prevent patient medication 
error or dispensing errors. The trade name for U300 Insulin glargine is 
TOUJEO (TOUJEO SoloStar for the small size pen, and TOUJEO DoubleStar 
for the large size pen), while LANTUS is used for U100.

Literature, clinical data. 
A recently published quartet of observational studies a, b, c assessing whether 
different types of insulin confer different cancer risk were considered 
inconsistent and inconclusive with regard to specific insulin types, but 
consistent with the hypothesis that insulin therapy confers increased risk. In an 
accompanying editorial in the same journal issue, the commissioners of these 
studies commented that the available evidence points to the possibility that 
insulin in general, or different types of insulin, may be mitogenic, that is, they 
enhance growth and proliferation of neoplastic cells already present, rather 
than being mutagenic, that is, rather than causing the de novo appearance of

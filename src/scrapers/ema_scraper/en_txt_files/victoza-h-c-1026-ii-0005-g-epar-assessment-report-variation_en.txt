1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
About the product 
Victoza  (liraglutide)  is  a  once-daily  human  glucagon-like  peptide-1  (GLP-1)  analogue.  Compared  to 
human  GLP-1,  liraglutide  has  a  C16  fatty  (palmitic)  acid  chain  attached  at  position  26  (lysine)  of  the 
peptide,  and  has  a  lysine  at  position  34  replaced  by  an  arginine.  When  administered  subcutaneously 
(s.c.),  these  structural  modifications  result  in  PK  properties  of  the  compound  suitable  for  once  daily 
administration.  Mode  of  action  trials  in  subjects  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM)  have 
demonstrated  glucose  lowering,  increased  insulin  secretion,  restored  beta-cell  responsiveness  to 
increasing glucose concentrations and delayed gastric emptying after a single s.c. dose of liraglutide. 
Victoza  is  administered  as  a  once-daily  s.c.  injection,  irrespective  of  meals,  in  either  the  upper  arm, 
thigh or abdomen at therapeutic doses of 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg. The product is available in a 3 mL prefilled 
pen. 
Victoza was approved throughout the European Union on 30 June 2009. 
Victoza is indicated in adults who have type 2 diabetes to control their blood glucose level. Victoza is 
used together with: 
-  metformin  or  a  sulphonylurea  (anti-diabetes  medicines)  in  patients  whose  glucose  levels  are  not 
satisfactorily controlled on metformin or a sulphonylurea used on their own at the maximum possible 
dose 
-  metformin  and  a  sulphonylurea,  or  metformin  and  a  thiazolidinedione  in  patients  whose  glucose 
levels are not satisfactorily controlled despite treatment with two medicines. 
Problem statement 
The  MAH  submitted  a  grouping  of  two  type  II  variations.  The  first  variation  application  was  an 
extension of the indication for Victoza for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with 
basal  insulin  in  patients  not  achieving  adequate  glycaemic  control  with  Victoza  and  metformin  alone. 
The second variation was submitted by the MAH to include a warning in the Victoza SmPC that Victoza 
is not a substitute for insulin following spontaneous reported cases of ketoacidosis in patients switching 
from insulin to Victoza.  
The variations submitted in the group are the following:

The scopes applied for by the MAH were as follows: 
- 
Extension of indication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in combination with basal insulin in 
patients not achieving adequate glycaemic control with Victoza and metformin alone: update to 
sections 4.1, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and consequential changes to sections 1 and 2 of the 
Package Leaflet. 
- 
Update to section 4.4 of the SmPC to include a warning that Victoza is not a substitute for insulin 
and  consequential  changes  to  section  2  of  the  Package  Leaflet,  following  post-marketing 
spontaneous reports of ketoacidosis in patients switching from insulin to Victoza. In addition the 
MAH has taken the opportunity to align the Annexes with version 7.3.1 of the QRD template and 
to  delete  the  DDPS  version  number  from  Annex  IIB.  Minor  editorial  changes  have  been  made 
throughout  the  Annexes.  Finally  in  section  6  of  the  Package  Leaflet,  the  pictures  for  the 
instructions of using Victoza have been changed so that the fingers in the pictures are now white 
instead of yellow. 
Overall introduction 
Two new clinical studies have been submitted by the MAH with this grouping of two type 2 variations: 
-  Clinical  pharmacology  trial  NN2211-3673,  to  provide  information  on  PK  and  PD  of  the  basal  insulin 
and liraglutide combination in patients with T2DM. 
-  Clinical  study  NN2211-1842,  performed  in  T2DM  patients  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
adding  basal  insulin  detemir  to  the  combination  therapy  of  liraglutide  and  metformin  when  these 
agents no longer provide adequate glycaemic control. 
Trials and Data Included in the Clinical Overview 
Confirmatory Phase 3b Efficacy and 
Safety Trial 
Supportive Phase 1 Pharmacokinetics 
and Pharmacodynamics Trial  
Trial NN2211-1842 in insulin-naïve 
subjects with type 2 diabetes: 
After a 12-week run-in period with 
metformin and liraglutide, two regimens 
were compared:  
1: liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin 
2: insulin detemir + liraglutide 1.8 mg + 
metformin 
Trial NN2211-3673 in subjects with type 2 
diabetes 
Treatments: 
  liraglutide steady-state dose of  
1.8 mg 
  insulin detemir 0.5 U/kg 
  liraglutide 1.8 mg + insulin detemir 0.5 
U/kg 
In  order  to  demonstrate  the  contribution  of  Victoza  in  the  efficacy  of  the  combination  metformin  + 
basal insulin + liraglutide therapy, the MAH identified comparable patient populations to provide data 
on  the  efficacy  and  the  safety  of  the  basal  insulin  and  metformin  combination.  The  following  three 
sources were used: 
- Literature search 
- An International Variability Evaluation (PREDICTIVE) search (PREDICTIVE™ is a global observational 
study  including  30  countries  following  type  1  and  type  2  patients  initiated  on  Levemir.  The  primary 
objective of the study is to document the safety using Levemir) 
- All available Levemir clinical trials were used to identify patients with comparable patient populations.

GCP 
Both  the  clinical  pharmacology  and  the  confirmatory  clinical  trial  were  conducted  in  accordance  with 
the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH Good Clinical Practice, as declared by the MAH. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  N°  1901/2006  as  amended,  the  application  included  an  EMA 
decision (P/288/2010) for the following condition(s): 
 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). At the time of submission of the application, 
the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were deferred. 
1.2.  Clinical aspects 
1.2.1.  Clinical Pharmacology 
Study NN2211-3673 
This  clinical  pharmacology  study  was  an  open-label  phase  I  study  conducted  in  33  male  or  female, 
insulin-naïve subjects with type 2 diabetes. This study was designed to investigate whether the PK and 
PD  properties  of  insulin  detemir  and/or  liraglutide  would  be  affected  when  the  two  drugs  were  co-
administered  to  subjects with  type  2 diabetes.  The  objective  of  the  trial  was  to  compare  the  24-hour 
concentration profile – the area under the concentration–time curve (AUC0–24h) – and the maximum 
serum  concentration  (Cmax)  after  administration  of  insulin  detemir  administered  alone  and  when  co-
administered with liraglutide at a steady-state dose of 1.8 mg/day.

Methods 
Study NN2211-3673 was an open label phase I trial including a total of 33 men and women aged 18 
years or more with type 2 diabetes.  
Study participants 
According  to  the  inclusion  criteria  the  subjects  were  required  to  be  insulin  naïve  subjects  diagnosed 
with type 2 diabetes and treated with stable doses of OADs (one of which had to be metformin), body 
mass  index  (BMI)  of  ≤45  kg/m2,  screening  glycosylated  haemoglobin  (HbA1c)  of  7-10%  on 
monotherapy and 7-9.5% on dual therapy, Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) ≤250 mg/dL at Visit 2, FPG 
≥140 and ≤240 mg/dL at Visit 5. 
Study design (study NN2211-3673) 
Following  successful  screening  (Visit  1),  subjects  entered  a  3-week  washout  period  and  discontinued 
oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs), other than metformin (subjects on metformin monotherapy preceded 
to the Visit 5 clamp). During the washout, weekly telephone contact visits and the glucose diary were 
reviewed.  After  the  washout  period  (Visit  5-Day  1)  all  subjects  had  a  24  hr  euglycaemic  clamp  (100 
mg/dL)  following  dosing  with  0.5  U/kg  insulin  detemir  and  24  hour  serial  insulin  detemir  PK  was 
assessed. Following the detemir clamp, all subjects began a liraglutide titration (0.6 mg/day on days 2-
8,  1.2  mg/day  on  days  9-15  and  1.8  mg/day  on  days  16-22).  On  Day  22,  a  24  hour  liraglutide  PK 
profile  and  euglycaemic  clamp  (following  1.8  mg  liraglutide)  was  performed  in  all  subjects.  Subjects 
were  then  maintained  on  liraglutide  1.8  mg/day  for  another  14  days  with  a  telephone  contact 
visit/diary  review  on  Day  29.  At  Visit  10  (Day  36),  subjects  had  a  third  euglycaemic  clamp  following 
co-administration  of  liraglutide  (1.8  mg)  and  insulin  detemir  (0.5  U/kg).  The  liraglutide  and  insulin 
detemir PK profile was assessed. A final visit was scheduled at Day 42 ± 3 days (Visit 11).

PK and PD properties were investigated in three euclycaemic clamp settings scheduled 2-3 weeks apart 
during an 11-week study period with metformin as the only background treatment. 
For the assessment of the PK profile of Liraglutide plasma samples were collected at 0 min (pre-dose) 
and 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 24 hours post liraglutide dose. 
For the assessment of the PK profile of insulin detemir samples (serum) were collected at 0 min (pre-
dose)  and  2,  4,  6,  8,  9,  10,  11,  12,  14,  16,  18  and  24  hours  post  insulin  detemir  dose.  The  insulin 
detemir and liraglutide concentrations were determined with validated ELISA methods. 
Information  on  the  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  the  study  medication  was  derived  from  the  glucose 
infusion  rate  (GIR).  The  clamp  started  with  a  run  in  period  of  2  hours  before  start  of  medication, 
insulin  was  used  in  order  to  maintain  blood  glucose  levels  of  5.5  mmol/L  (100  mg/dL).  Basal  insulin 
infusion was discontinued approximately 30 minutes prior to dosing. After administration of the study 
medication  (insulin  detemir,  liraglutide  or  both)  glucose  infusion  was  used  in  order  to  obtain  a  blood 
glucose  level  of  5.5  mmol/L  (100  mg/dL)  ±  10%.  GIR  was  recorded.  The  clamp  procedure  was 
continued until blood glucose values reached > 6.6 mmol/L (120 mg/dL) for at least two hours without 
glucose  infusion.  The  C max  of  study  drug  should  be  achieved  before  glucose  infusion  can  be  stopped. 
When the clamp was discontinued prior to 24 hours, blood glucose concentrations were monitored for 
the remaining 24-hour post-dose period. 
Treatments 
The  treatments  used  in  this  study included  insulin detemir  (0.5  U/kg)  and  liraglutide  1.8mg.  A  single 
dose of insulin detemir was given at Visit 5, Day 1 and Visit 10, Day 36. Liraglutide was self-titrated to 
1.8mg  from  Day  2  to  Day  22  upon  which  it  was  administered  at  steady  state  for  clamp  procedural 
activity. Subjects then maintained the liraglutide 1.8mg dose for two weeks after which liraglutide and 
insulin detemir were co-administered for the final clamp procedure on Day 36. 
Subjects were directed to administer insulin detemir in the abdomen and liraglutide consistently in one 
location throughout the trial (either in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm) once daily by subcutaneous 
injections with the pen-injector. Metformin was considered a background treatment and was regarded 
as a non-investigational product. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical reports and method validation reports of the determination for liraglutide in plasma and 
the  determination  of  insulin  detemir  were  submitted.  The  insulin  detemir  concentrations  were 
determined  with  an  enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  method.  The 
liraglutide 
concentrations were determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. 
Outcome/endpoints 
▪ 
Efficacy 
Primary  endpoint  was  the  ratio  of  insulin  detemir  AUC0-24h  and  C max  (from  liraglutide  and  insulin 
detemir co-administration clamp divided by insulin detemir alone clamp).  
The secondary endpoints included: 
 
 
tmax for insulin detemir 
Liraglutide steady state AUC0-24h, Cssmax, Cssmin, Cssav and tmax 
  Clamp AUCGIR  0-24h, tGIRmax and GIRmax for three clamps 
Assessment report  
Page 8/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  AUC, C max and C min for plasma insulin, C-peptide and glucagon concentrations (insulin detemir, 
liraglutide and liraglutide co-administered with insulin detemir) 
▪ 
Safety 
Safety  was  evaluated  by  monitoring  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  events, 
incidence  of 
hypoglycaemic episodes, physical examination, vital signs, ECG, medical events of special interest and 
clinical laboratory tests (including liraglutide antibodies). 
Statistical Methods 
▪ 
Efficacy 
The  summary  statistics  and  statistical  analyses  for  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  were  based 
on  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS).  The  FAS  was  defined  as  all  treated  subjects  exposed  to  at  least  one 
dose of the trial product. 
To compare insulin detemir (Levemir) AUC0-24h and Cmax (with vs. without liraglutide co-administration) 
the  ratio  of  the  AUC0-24h  and  C max  of  both  treatments  were  compared  using  a  linear  mixed  effect 
model.  Treatment  (with  or  without  liraglutide)  was  included  as  fixed  factor  and  subject  as  a  random 
factor.  From  this  model,  the  geometric  mean  treatment  ratio  was  estimated,  and  a  90%  confidence 
interval  for  this  was  calculated.  If  the  90%  confidence  interval  lies  entirely  within  the  no  effect 
boundary interval 0.80-1.25, it was concluded that there is no PK interaction. 
To  compare  liraglutide  steady  state  PK  parameters  AUC0-24h  and  Css max  (with  vs.  without  insulin 
detemir  co  administration),  the  analysis  was  performed  in  the  same  manner  as  for  the  primary 
endpoints. 
To  compare  clamp  parameters  GIRmax  and  AUCGIR 0-24h  between  insulin  detemir  and  insulin  detemir 
with  co  administration  of  liraglutide,  the  clamp  parameters  GIRmax  and  AUCGIR0-24h  were  (after  log-
transformation) analysed separately using a linear mixed effect model with treatment (insulin detemir 
alone,  liraglutide  alone,  and  insulin  detemir  with  co-administration  of  liraglutide)  as  fixed  factor  and 
subject  as  a  random  factor.  Pair  wise  comparisons  were  made  between  insulin  detemir  and  insulin 
detemir  with  co-administration  of  liraglutide  and  between  liraglutide  and  liraglutide  with  co-
administration of insulin detemir. 
▪ 
Safety 
Safety  endpoints 
included  biochemistry,  haematology  with  differential,  urinalysis,  physical 
examinations, vital signs, ECG, FPG and adverse event monitoring. Summary statistics for FPG in raw 
scale  and  change  from  baseline  at  each  scheduled visit  were  provided.  Hypoglycaemic  episodes  were 
classified according to ADA definition. Hypoglycaemic episodes were summarised on ADA definition and 
minor hypoglycaemic episodes definition. 
Results  
Participant flow 
A total of 33 male and female subjects (≥18 years of age) were randomised and enrolled in the study, 
32  subjects  completed  the  study.  One  subject  withdrew  consent  on  Visit  5,  Day  1  after  receiving  a 
dose of insulin detemir and partially completing the clamp procedure. This subject was included in the 
full analysis set (used for safety analyses), but not the PK or PD analysis set.

The  sum  of  the  mean  AUCGIR  for  liraglutide  (1982  mg/kg)  and  insulin  detemir  (1058  mg/kg)  given 
individually was similar to that obtained when the two were given in combination (2947 mg/kg).  
C-peptide  average  (AVG0-24hr)  and  maximum  concentration  (C max)  was  greatest  when  liraglutide  was 
administered alone (950.3 pmol/L and 1348.0 pmol/L, respectively). 
The plasma insulin data was inconclusive as the assay did not discriminate between endogenous insulin 
and insulin detemir 
Glucagon  average  (AVG0-24hr)  and  C max  were  greatest  when  insulin  detemir  was  given  alone  (65.1 
pg/mL and 92.1 pg/mL, respectively).

Safety  
A  total  of  32  subjects  experienced  a  total  of  107  adverse  events  over  the  duration  of  the  trial.  On 
clamp procedure days, 14 (42.4%) subjects treated with insulin detemir, 17 (51.5%) subjects treated 
with  liraglutide,  and  13  (39.4%)  subjects  treated  with  both  insulin  detemir  and  liraglutide  had 
treatment  emergent  adverse  events.  Out  of  these  32  subjects,  15  (45.5%)  subjects  experiencing  a 
total  of  24adverse  events  which  were  potentially  treatment  related,  with  the  majority  of  subjects 
(39.4%)  having  adverse  events  following  liraglutide  administration  during  the  liraglutide  dose 
escalation period. The majority of adverse events were judged as ‘unlikely’ to be related to treatment. 
The  most  frequently  occurring  TEAEs  (occurring  in  >10%  of  subjects)  were  abdominal  discomfort, 
diarrhoea,  nausea,  weight  decrease,  and  headache.  In  four  subjects  decreased  weight  was  reported 
and  4  injection  site  reactions  were  reported  during  the  study  period.  No  adverse  events  led  to  study 
discontinuation.  All  adverse  events  were  mild  to  moderate.  No  severe  AEs  were  reported.  No  serious 
adverse  events  or  deaths  were  reported.  Three  asymptomatic  hypoglycaemic  episodes  in  2  subjects 
were reported. 
1.2.2.  Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology 
The design of the study was considered suitable by the CHMP to assess the influence of liraglutide on 
the  PK  profile  of  insulin  detemir  and  vice  versa.  The  term  “basal  insulin”  as  proposed  by  the  MAH  in 
section  4.1  of  the  SmPC  was  considered  too  broad  by  the  CHMP  as  other  long-acting  insulins  have 
different PK profile compared to insulin detemir. The MAH was requested to amend “basal insulin” by 
“insulin detemir” as only clinical pharmacology data on the combination liraglutide-insulin detemir has 
been provided with this application. 
Information  derived  from  the  glucose  infusion  rate  (GIR)  is  an  acceptable  method  to  study 
pharmacodynamic interaction. The inclusion criteria for this study have been properly motivated by the 
MAH.  The  withdrawal  of  one  study  subject  was  sufficiently  justified  according  to  the  CHMP.  The 
analytical  methods  presented  by  the  MAH  were  considered  acceptable  and  properly  validated.  The 
primary and secondary endpoints and the statistical methods were considered acceptable for this type 
of  study.  No  pharmacokinetic  interaction  was  observed  during  this  PK/PD  study.  According  to  the 
predefined  no  effect  boundary  of  [0.8,  1.25],  liraglutide  at  steady  state  did  not  affect  the 
pharmacokinetic  endpoints  (AUC,  Cmax)  of  insulin  detemir  and  vice  versa.  No  pharmacokinetic 
interaction was observed in this study. The study treatments had an additive pharmacodynamic effect. 
Both treatments and the combination of the treatments were well tolerated. 
1.2.3.  Clinical efficacy 
Study NN2211-1842 
Study  NN2211-1842,  performed  in  T2DM  patients,  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  adding 
insulin detemir to the combination therapy liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin, was submitted by the MAH 
to support this extension of indication. The purpose of the trial was to determine whether the effect of 
insulin detemir in combination with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin was superior to that of liraglutide 
1.8 mg and metformin alone. 
Methods 
Study NN2211-1842 was a 26 week randomised, open label, parallel group multicentre, multinational 
trial,  that  investigated  the  effect  of  insulin  detemir  in  combination  with  liraglutide  and  metformin 
Assessment report  
Page 12/57
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
compared to liraglutide and metformin in subjects with T2DM. The trial included a 26 week extension 
period; total duration of the trial was 52 weeks. 
Study participants 
The study was performed in 202 centers in the following countries: United States (57), Germany (37), 
United  Kingdom  (32),  France  (19),  Italy  (18),  The  Netherlands  (16),  Spain  (14),  Canada  (7),  and 
Belgium (2). 
Main inclusion criteria: 
  Subjects  diagnosed  with  type  2  diabetes,  insulin  naïve  and  treated  with  metformin  as 
monotherapy  for  ≥3  months  prior  to  screening,  at  a  stable  dose  of  ≥1500  mg/day  or 
metformin  (≥1500  mg/day)  and  a  sulphonylurea  (less  than  or  equal  to  ½  of  the  maximum 
approved  dose  according  to  local  label),  both  at  a  stable  dose  for  ≥3  months  prior  to 
screening.  Previous  short  term  insulin  treatment  in  connection  with  inter-current  illness  was 
allowed, at the discretion of the investigator 
  HbA1c  7.0-10.0%  (both  inclusive)  for  subjects  on  metformin  monotherapy,  HbA1c  7.0-8.5% 
(both inclusive) for subjects on metformin in combination with a sulphonylurea 
  Age 18-80 years, both inclusive (or as allowed according to local guidelines) 
Inclusion criteria at randomisation: 
  HbA1c measured at the randomisation visit (Visit 4a) greater than or equal to 7.0% 
Main exclusion criteria included previous treatment with insulin and glucose-lowering agents other than 
those  stated  in  the  inclusion  criteria, impaired  liver  and  renal  function,  history  of  pancreatitis,  cancer  
and known history of unstable angina, acute coronary event, other significant cardiac event. 
The  patients  included  in  the  trial  were  type  2  diabetic  patients  insufficiently  controlled  on  metformin 
treatment  and  therefore  in  need  of  intensification  of  treatment.  This  approach  is  considered 
appropriate; metformin is the recommended 1st line therapy according to current treatment guidelines 
(EASD/ADA).  It  is  noticed  however,  that  patients insufficiently controlled  on  metformin  AND  SU  were 
also  included.  This  latter  sub-population  represents  a  switch  design  rather  than  an  add-on  design. 
Since SU treated subjects were only allowed to be on a dosage corresponding to less than or equal to 
½ of the maximum approved dose this may be acceptable. 
Patients  with  ischaemic  heart  disease,  heart  failure  NYHA  class  IV,  impaired  hepatic  function  and 
impaired kidney function were excluded from the trial. 
Treatments 
Insulin-naïve  type  2  diabetic  subjects,  aged  18-80,  treated  with  metformin  monotherapy  (≥1500 
mg/day  for  ≥3  months)  and  HbA1c  between  7.0-10.0%  (both  inclusive);  or  metformin  (≥1500 
mg/day) in combination with a sulphonylurea (less than or equal to ½ of the maximum approved dose) 
resulting in an HbA1c between 7.0-8.5% (both inclusive) underwent screening, and if eligible, entered 
the 12 week run-in period. During this run-in period, sulphonylurea (SU) treatment was discontinued, 
while  treatment  with  metformin  remained  unchanged  (same  dose  and  dosing  regimen).  Treatment 
with liraglutide was initiated in all patients in 0.6 mg/day weekly increments to allow a final dose of 1.8 
mg/day. 
Subjects with an HbA1c ≥ 7.0% after the 12-week run-in period were randomised 1:1 to intensification 
of  treatment  with  open-label  insulin  detemir  (starting  dose  of  10  U)  added  to  the  combination  of 
liraglutide  (1.8  mg/day)  and  metformin  (≥1500mg/day),  or  to  continue  with  liraglutide  (1.8  mg/day) 
and metformin (≥1500mg/day) treatment as control group (see Figure 1). The metformin + liraglutide 
Assessment report  
Page 13/57
 
 
 
   
 
1.8  mg/day  +  insulin  detemir  group  is  referred  to  as  the  “detemir+lira  group”,  while  the  randomised 
metformin + liraglutide 1.8 mg/day group is referred to as the “lira-control group”. The randomisation 
of subjects to treatment groups was stratified by previous treatment with metformin or a combination 
of metformin and a SU. 
Subjects with an adequate response to liraglutide, i.e. with an HbA1c less than 7.0% after the run-in 
period,  were  not  randomised,  but  continued  the  metformin  and  liraglutide  treatment  as  in  the  run-in 
period. 
After the initial dose titration period, liraglutide was to be administered at a constant dose of 1.8 mg 
throughout the entire trial period. Insulin detemir was initiated at a dose of 10 U per day, with further 
titration depending on subjects’ self-measured glucose values. 
After  the  main  26  week  study,  subjects  could  participate  in  the  26  week  extension  study. 
Intensification of treatment with insulin detemir was allowed for subjects both in the randomised and 
non-randomised  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin  treatment  groups  with  an  HbA1c  ≥8.0%  at  week  26 
and week 38.

Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  and  compare  the  efficacy  (as  assessed  by  HbA1c)  of  insulin 
detemir in combination with liraglutide and metformin versus liraglutide and metformin in subjects with 
type 2 diabetes after 26 weeks of randomized treatment 
The  secondary  objectives  were  to  assess  and  compare  the  effects  of  insulin  detemir  in  combination 
with  liraglutide  and  metformin  versus  liraglutide  and  metformin  on  other  descriptors  of  glycaemic 
control (FPG, 7-point self-monitored glucose profiles, proportion of subjects reaching target HbA1c), C-
peptide, proinsulin to C-peptide ratio, body weight, waist and hip circumference including the waist to 
hip ratio, lipids and blood pressure after 26 weeks treatment. 
Safety objectives 
To  assess  and  compare  clinical  and  laboratory  safety  parameters  and  incidence  of  hypoglycaemic 
episodes after 26 weeks of treatment. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint:  
  Change in HbA1c (%) from baseline (randomisation and Week 0) to Week 26. 
Secondary endpoints:

 
Proportion  of  subjects  reaching  HbA1c  targets  at  Week  26  (and  Week  52  in  26-week 
extension); American Diabetes Association (ADA) target <7%; American Association of Clinical 
Endocrinologists (AACE) target ≤6.5% 
  Change  in  glycaemic  control  parameters  from  baseline  to  Week  26  (and  Week  52  in 
extension):  Fasting  plasma  glucose  (FPG);  Self-measured  7-point  (meal-related)  glucose 
profiles,  taken  before  and  90  minutes  after  the  start  of  breakfast,  lunch  and  dinner,  and  at 
bedtime 
  Change in body weight from baseline to Week 26 (and Week 52 in 26-week extension) 
  Change  in  waist  and  hip  circumference  including  waist  to  hip  ratio  from  baseline  to  Week  26 
(and Week 52 in 26-week extension) 
  Change  in  beta-cell function  from  baseline  to  Week  26  (and  Week  52 of  26-week  extension): 
Fasting insulin; Fasting pro-insulin; Fasting C-peptide; Pro-insulin to C-peptide ratio; HOMA-B;

  Change in lipid profile (cholesterol, LDL-C, VLDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides and FFA) from baseline 
to Week 26 (and Week 52 in 26-week extension) 
  Change  in  blood  pressure  (diastolic  and  systolic)  from  baseline  to  Week  26  (and  Week  52  in 
26-week extension) 
Sample size 
The trial was powered to demonstrate superiority (delta of 0.5% with a two-sided significance level of 
5% and power set to 90%) of insulin detemir + liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin randomised treatment 
over  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin  randomised  treatment  with  respect  to  change  in  HbA1c  from 
baseline (i.e. randomisation) to Week 26. 
The  variation  in  HbA1c  was  based  on  the  liraglutide  phase  3  trials,  i.e.  a  standard  deviation  (SD)  of 
approximately  1.2%.  When  using  a  1:1  randomisation,  the  number  of  subjects  required  was  123  per 
group. 
The  sample  size  calculations  were  based  on  the  aim  to  show  superiority  of  metformin  +  liraglutide 
1.8mg+insulin  detemir  vs.  metformin  +  liraglutide  1.8mg  for  the  primary  endpoint  change  in  HbA1c 
(delta  of  0.5%,  a  power  of  90%  and  a  standard  deviation  of  1.2%).  The  calculations  also  take  into 
account a high drop-out rate in the run-in- as well as during the first 12 weeks of the treatment period. 
These  criteria  and  assumptions  are  in  line  with  previous  large  diabetes  trials  and  are  considered 
acceptable. The high drop-out rates in trials including this patient population are acknowledged.  
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomised  1:1  to  receive  Insulin  detemir  +  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin  ≥1500 
mg/day or liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin ≥1500 mg/day 
The  randomisation  of  subjects  to  treatment  groups  was  stratified  by  previous  treatment  with 
metformin or a combination of metformin and a sulphonylurea. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-labeled trial design. 
Assessment report

Statistical methods 
The full analysis set (FAS) was used for analyses of all efficacy endpoints and included all randomised 
subjects who had been exposed to at least one dose of trial products and who provided post-baseline 
HbA1c efficacy data. 
The non-randomised analysis set included all subjects with an HbA1c <7.0% after 12 weeks of run-in 
and  with  at  least  one  efficacy  value  after  the  randomisation  visit.  Only  descriptive  statistics  were 
provided for this group of subjects. 
The safety analysis set included all exposed subjects. If a subject received a different treatment than 
he/she was randomised to, data for the subject was analysed, tabulated and/or listed according to the 
actual treatment received. All safety evaluations were based on the safety analysis set. 
Primary endpoint: 
The primary endpoint was analysed using the full analysis set and an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
of  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  26  for  the  randomised  treatment  groups.  Treatment, 
previous  OAD  and  country  were  explanatory  variables  and  baseline  HbA1c  values  were  included  as 
covariates. Missing observations were considered missing at random in all analyses.  
Missing values  at  post  baseline  visits  were  replaced  using last  observation carried  forward  (LOCF)  for 
analysis purposes. 
Secondary endpoints: 
FPG, 7-point SMPG profiles, body weight, hip and waist circumference, β-cell function, lipids and blood 
pressure were all analysed similar to the primary endpoint, i.e. by ANCOVA of change from baseline to 
week  26  for  the  randomised  treatment  groups  with  treatment,  previous  OAD  and  country  as 
explanatory variables, and baseline value as covariate. Proportion of subjects reaching target HbA1c < 
7%, or ≤6.5%; after 26 weeks of treatment was analysed using a logistic regression with treatment, 
previous OAD and country as fixed effect and baseline HbA1c value as covariate. 
The  secondary  endpoints  were  supportive  evidence  to  the  primary  endpoint  and  all  tests  were  two-
sided on a significance level of 5%, i.e. no adjustment for multiplicity was applied 
▪Results 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  1658  subjects  were  screened  for  this  trial  (see  Table  6).  Of  these,  670  subjects  were 
screening failures, where the majority (72.2%) failed to meet the HbA1c inclusion criterion. The second 
most  common  reason  for  screening  failure  was  ‘other’,  at  7.8%,  with  most  being  withdrawal  of 
consent.

Table 6: Subject disposition 
A  total  of  988  subjects  entered  the  run-in  phase  of  the  trial  and  all  but  one  of  these  subjects  were 
exposed to liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin. One subject withdrew before being exposed to randomised 
trial products. About 17% (167 of 988) of subjects withdrew early (‘early withdrawals’), i.e. during the 
run-in  period  and  before  randomisation.  The  most  frequent  reasons  for  withdrawal  among  these 
subjects  were  adverse  events  (mainly  gastrointestinal  adverse  events).  Protocol  deviations  and  non-
compliance  were  also  common  withdrawal  reasons  in  this  group,  including  subjects  discovered  to 
violate in- and exclusion criteria after trial start. 
A  total  of  60.7%  of  the  subjects  (N=498)  completing  the  run-in  phase  with  liraglutide  1.8 
mg+metformin,  achieved  adequate  glycaemic  control  and  continued  the  trial  in  the  nonrandomised 
treatment arm. The remaining 39.3% of subjects who did not achieve adequate glycaemic control with 
an  HbA1c  below  7%  after  completing  the  run-in  phase,  were  randomised  to  receive  either  insulin 
detemir+liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin or continued liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin treatment (162 and 
161 subjects, respectively). 
A total of 25% of subjects withdrew during the entire period of the trial. The differences in withdrawal 
rates  between  the  two  randomised  treatment  groups  were  driven  by  ineffective  therapy  in  the  lira-
control group. Of the total subject withdrawals, most subjects left the trial during the first 2 months of 
the run-in phase (22% for both months). 
Overall, 75% of subjects completed the 38-week main trial period (run-in and main 26-week treatment 
period), with 26-week main trial completion rates being 88.9%, 78.9% and 94.4% for subjects in the 
detemir+lira  group,  lira-control  group,  and  the  non-randomised  liraglutide  1.8  mg+metformin  group, 
respectively. 
For the extension study, 140 subjects (86.4%) in the detemir+lira group, 122 subjects (75.8%) in the 
lira-control  group  and  461  (92.6%)  in  the  non-randomised  group  continuated  treatment.  Seventeen

(10.6%)  of  the  subjects  in  the  liraglutide-control  group  received  insulin  detemir  intensification 
treatment,  while  in  the  non-randomized  liraglutide  1.8  mg+metformin  group  seven  (1.4%)  subjects 
received this intensification treatment. 
Overall,  68%  of  subjects  completed  the  64-week  total  trial  period  (12-week  run-in,  26-week  main 
treatment  period  and  26-week  extension  period),  with  completion  rates  being  80.2%,  57.1%  and 
85.5%  for  subjects  in  the  detemir+liraglutide,  liraglutide  control  and  the  non-randomised  liraglutide 
1.8 mg+metformin groups, respectively. 
Recruitment 
Study NN2211-1842 was conducted from the 3rd of March 2009 until the  19th of April 2010 (main 
period of 26 weeks). 
Conduct of the study 
Most important substantial protocol amendments: 
There  were  2  global  and  16  local  substantial  amendments  to  the  final  protocol,  version  1,  dated  30 
September 2008.  
The  substantial  protocol  amendments  listed  above  are  not  expected  to  have  had  clinically  relevant 
impact on the overall trial results. 
Baseline data 
The  treatment  groups  were  overall  well  matched  with  respect  to  baseline  demographics  and 
characteristics

Mean run-in efficacy parameters for subjects previously treated with metformin alone or sulphonylurea 
and metformin therapy demonstrated comparable results to those presented for all exposed subjects, 
although  with  generally  lower  means  for  HbA1c  and  FPG  for  subjects  previously  treated  with 
sulphonylurea and metformin compared to with metformin alone.

The  screening  physical  examination  findings  were  comparable  across  treatment  groups  (randomised 
and non-randomised) and most (about 90%) observations were normal for all organ systems. 
Diabetic complications included neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy and macroangiopathy. The most 
frequent diabetic complications were neuropathy and retinopathy (reported  by about 15% and 7% of 
subjects,  respectively),  while  the  overall  prevalence  of  complications  were  comparable  across 
treatment groups. 
Nearly all subjects in all treatment groups reported concomitant illnesses (96.5%). The most frequent 
concomitant  illnesses  across  treatment  groups  were  disorders  in  the  system  organ  class  metabolism 
and  nutrition  disorders  and  related  to  hyperlipidaemia,  hypercholesterolaemia,  obesity  and 
dyslipidaemia.  The  incidence  of  these  events  as  well  as  the  other  events  reported  were  comparable 
across treatment groups (both between randomised and for non-randomised). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoint – Change in HbA1c 
Figure 2 illustrates that the greatest change in HbA1c in all treatment groups was observed during the 
12-week  run-in  period;  subjects  in  the  randomised  groups  had  a  mean  screening  HbA1c  of  8.3%, 
which decreased to 7.6% after the 12-week run-in period. A further significant decrease in HbA1c was 
observed from baseline to Week 12 for the detemir+lira group, after which HbA1c appeared to remain 
relatively  stable.  The  estimated  decrease  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  26  was  0.51%  in  the 
detemir+lira  group,  whereas  a  small  increase  of  0.02%  was  observed  in  the  lira-control  group 
(comparing Least square means).

Results  from  the  ANCOVA  analysis  demonstrates  that  treatment  with  insulin  detemir+liraglutide  1.8 
mg+metformin was superior to treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin alone in terms of change 
in HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  26  (estimated treatment  difference  of  -0.52%)  (see  Table  9).  These 
results were further supported by a repeated measurements analysis of HbA1c levels after 12 and 26 
weeks of randomised treatment.

Table 9: ANCOVA of change in HbA1c (%) – LOCF -FAS 
The mean change in HbA1c from randomisation to Week 52 was also analysed using an ANCOVA model 
including  values  for  intensified  subjects  in  the  initial  treatment  group  (HbA1c  values  used  after 
intensification  with  detemir).  In  the  FAS,  using  LOCF,  the  estimated  mean  changes  in  HbA1c  from 
randomisation  to  Week  52  were  -0.51%  and  -0.10%  in  the  insulin  detemir  +  liraglutide  1.8  mg  + 
metformin and liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin treatment groups, respectively. 
In order to elucidate the impact of the subjects who were exposed during the run-in period to less than 
80 days  before randomisation, both the summary tables showing the absolute values and changes in 
HbA1c  by  week  and  the  planned  ANCOVA  on  HbA1c  was  made  for  subjects  with  at  least  80  days  of 
exposure  only.  The  mean  changes  over  time  were  comparable  to  those  observed  for  the  treatment 
groups  including  the  entire  subject  population,  as  were  the  ANCOVA  estimated  means  and  statistical 
significance levels. The inclusion of subjects with less than 80 days of exposure to liraglutide 1.8 mg + 
metformin  prior  to  randomisation  was  therefore  considered  to  have  no  impact  on  the  overall  results. 
No  statistically  significant  interaction  effect  between  treatment  and  either  baseline  HbA1c  or  baseline 
FPG was observed. 
Secondary Endpoint – Proportion of Subjects Reaching HbA1c Targets 
The  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  pre-defined  HbA1c  targets  (<7%  target;  and  ≤6.5%  target)  at 
Week 26 is summarised in Table 10. 
Table 10: Proportion of subjects with HbA1c <7% and ≤6.5% at Week 26 (LOCF) - FAS 
The  proportions  of  subjects  achieving  HbA1c  <7%  was  greater  with  insulin  detemir+liraglutide  1.8 
mg+metformin compared to liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin alone. The same was true for the number of 
subjects achieving the HbA1c ≤ 6.5% target. 
Assessment report  
Page 24/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
The  proportion  of  subjects  reaching  targets  was  higher  with  insulin  detemir+liraglutide  1.8 
mg+metformin  treatment  compared  to  liraglutide  1.8  mg+metformin  treatment,  irrespective  of 
baseline  HbA1c  level.  Furthermore,  the  lower  the  baseline  HbA1c  level,  the  higher  the  proportion  of 
subjects reaching targets. 
The  estimated  proportions  of  subjects  achieving  HbA1c  both  <7.0%  and  ≤6.5%  at  Week  52  were  in 
line  with  the  Week  26  data.  A  significantly  greater  proportion  of  subjects  with 
insulin 
detemir+liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin treatment achieved these goals (51.9% and 22.4%) compared 
to  subjects  in  the  control  group  treated  with  liraglutide  1.8  mg+metformin  (21.5%  and  6.8%; 
including values before intensification as LOCF for intensified subjects) (p<0.0001 for both analyses). 
Body weight 
Mean body weight decreased by 3.5 to 4.3 kg during run-in. This weight loss was sustained throughout 
the  main  treatment  period  for  subjects  randomised  to  further  intensification  with  insulin  detemir 
(estimated mean change of -0.16 kg), whereas subjects continuing on liraglutide and metformin had a 
further estimated mean change of -0.95 kg (see Figure 3). 
Figure 3: Mean change in body weight from run-in to Week 52 –No imputation - FAS 
After  52  weeks,  the  difference  between  groups  became  slightly  greater  with  an  estimated  mean 
change in body weight of -0.05 kg for the detemir+liraglutide group, versus -1.02 kg in the lira-control 
group (see Table 12). Table 11 shows the absolute body weight values at baseline, week 26 and end of 
the study (Week 52) and change in body weight from baseline to Week 26, and to week 52 using the 
Full  Analysis  Set  without  imputations.  The  mean  body  weight  was  numerically  larger  in  the 
detemir+lira  group,  in  comparison  with  the  lira-control  group,  95.99  kg  vs  95.32  kg,  although  the 
median body weight shows the opposite, with values of 91.70 kg vs 93.10 kg, respectively. The SD of 
both the absolute value, and the difference in body weight from baseline, was rather large in the two 
treatment  groups.  Changes  in  body  weight  values,  during  this  52-week  study,  were  between 
decreasing 15.4 kg, and gaining 13.2 kg. These minimum and maximum values were widely spread.

Other secondary endpoints 
Statistically significant improvements were seen in the detemir+lira group, in comparison with the lira-
control group, during the 52 weeks of treatment for the following items: 
 
There  was  an  estimated  mean  change  in  FPG  of  -2.12  mmol/L  and  -0.39  mmol/L,  in  the 
detemir+lira group and lira-control group, respectively (p<0.0001) at Week 26.  At Week 52, 
the  estimated  mean  change  from  baseline  was  -1.91  mmol/l  and  -0.14  mmol/l  respectively, 
with an estimated treatment difference of (LS mean [95% CI]) -1.77 [-2.24; -1.30] mmol/L. 
  Estimated  mean  decreases  in  post-prandial  glucose  at  all  meal  times  at  Week  52,  (ranging 
from  -1.14  mmol/L  to  -2.43  mmol/L  and  -0.51  mmol/L  to  -0.96  mmol/L,  for  the  two 
randomised treatments, respectively). 
 
Proportion  of  subjects  (about  10%  more)  having  post-prandial  glucose  measurements  below 
10  mmol/L  at  each  meal  at  Week  26.  At  Week  52,  only  breakfast  post-prandial  glucose 
measurements showed a statistically significant difference between treatment groups. Although 
Assessment report  
Page 26/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
no statistically significant treatment difference was observed for prandial glucose increments at 
either breakfast, lunch or dinner at either Week 26 or Week 52. 
  A  small,  but  greater  number,  difference  for  change  in  free  fatty  acids  was  seen  at  Week  26, 
estimated  change  of  -0.11  mmol/L  and  -0.03  mmol/L  (p=0.0017).  However,  no  statistically 
significant difference was observed at Week 52. 
 
From randomisation to Week 52, there was a small statistically significant treatment difference 
for change in HDL-cholesterol in favour of detemir+lira group, with increases observed for both 
treatment groups (including values before intensification as LOCF for intensified subjects). 
  At week 26, a greater proportion of subjects reaching the composite endpoint of HbA1c <7%, 
systolic  blood  pressure  <130  mmHg  and  change  in  body  weight  ≤0kg,  10.5%  and  4.1%, 
respectively (p=0.0126). Data at Week 52 were not provided by the MAH. 
  At Week 26, a greater proportion of subjects reached the composite endpoint of HbA1c <7%, 
change  in  body  weight  ≤0kg  and  no  major  or  minor  hypoglycaemic  episodes:  21.7%  and 
8.9%,  respectively  (p=0.0012).  At  Week  52,  the  proportions  of  subjects  were  25.9%  versus 
16.8%.  This  difference  between  groups  was  at  the  end  of  the  study  no  longer  statistically 
significant (p=0.06). 
No  statistically  significant  differences  were  seen  between  the  two  treatment  groups  in  fasting  lipid 
profiles or blood pressure at Week 26 or Week 52. 
Data  on  fasting  insulin  and  hence  HOMA-B  and  HOMA-IR  could  not  be  obtained  for  the  insulin 
detemir+liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin treated subjects due to cross-reactivity between insulin detemir 
and  the  insulin  assay.  Therefore,  an  overall  effect  of  treatments  on  beta-cell  function  could  not  be 
established.  Both  pro-insulin  and  C-peptide  levels  decreased  over  time,  where  the  decreases  were 
statistically significantly greater for subjects in the detemir+lira group compared to subjects in the lira-
control group (P=0.0230 and p<0.0001, respectively). Both mean baseline pro-insulin and baseline C-
peptide values were slightly higher for subjects in the detemir+lira group. No treatment difference was 
observed for pro-insulin to C-peptide ratio. 
1.2.4.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-
analysis) 
To provide data on efficacy and safety of insulin detemir + metformin, the MAH submitted data from 
literature. Three sources were used: 
Literature search 
- 
An  International  Variability  Evaluation  (PREDICTIVE)  search  (PREDICTIVE™  is  a  global 
observational study including 30 countries following type 1 and type 2 DM patients initiated on 
Levemir. The primary objective of the study is to document the safety of using Levemir) 
- 
- 
All  available  Levemir  clinical  trials  were  used  to  identify  patients  with  comparable  patient 
populations. 
The MAH identified comparable patient populations in the above mentioned studies/literature to 
provide data on efficacy and safety of the basal insulin and metformin combination. 
Results from these searches are shown in Table 13. 
The literature search provided two articles: Meneghimi et al. and Selam et al. Both articles described 
the  PREDICTIVE  study.  This  PREDICTIVE  303  Trial  included  5604  DM  type  2  patients  with  HbA1c 
≤12%. Age (58.6 years),  weight (97.8 kg) and diabetes  duration (11.4 years) were comparable with 
Assessment report  
Page 27/57
 
 
 
   
 
study  NN2211-1842,  but  HbA1c  levels  and  previous  diabetes  treatment  were  different  from  study 
NN2211-1842. 
HbA1c levels in the PREDICTIVE study were up to 12% without cut off point for minimum value. A third 
of the population (30.6%) had an HbA1c level >9.0%; and there was a group of patients (13.3%) with 
a baseline HbA1c level below 7%. The pre-treatment in this population included all possible varieties. A 
third of the patients (32%) used OADs only, while a large group (43%) was on insulin at baseline, and 
a small fraction (2.3%) did not receive any treatment at baseline (ref.: Meneghini et al). 
A post hoc sub-analysis was performed in 1806 insulin-naïve patients participating in the PREDICTIVE 
study by Selam et al. On average patients were taking two OADs. Metformin was most commonly used 
(72%),  followed  by  SU  (70%)  and  TZD  (55%).  A  third  (33.4)  of  these  subjects  had  an  HbA1c  above 
9%,  and  a  group  of  10.9%  had  an  HbA1c  <7%.  The  subjects  participating  in  this  PREDICTIVE  trial 
were not on insulin detemir in combination with metformin. 
The MAH selected 238 patients from the PREDICTIVE study who were on insulin detemir + metformin 
during the trial. Again, the age (58.5 years), weight (93.5 kg) and diabetes duration (10.3 years) were 
comparable  with  study  NN2211-1842.  However  the  mean  baseline  HbA1c,  8.85%,  and  the  previous 
treatment  were  different  from  study  NN2211-1842.  A  large  proportion  (60.50%)  of  the  subjects  was 
on  metformin  only, while  19.75%  used  the  combination  of  metformin+SU  (dosage  not  known).  Eight 
subjects (3.4%) did not receive any treatment at baseline. About a third of this population used other 
forms of OAD medication, including triple therapy. Insulin dosage at baseline was 0.32U/kg, in contrast 
to study NN2211-1842 where only insulin naïve patients participated. 
Furthermore,  the  MAH  gathered  76  subjects  on  detemir  +  metformin  treatment  from  three  pooled 
Levemir Trials. These patients had a higher mean HbA1c at baseline (8.72%), body weight was slightly 
lower (91.55 kg), while the previous diabetes treatment was not mentioned. During the trials, change 
in  HbA1c  was  -1.88%  and  mean  body  weight  increased  with  0.74kg.  Hypoglycaemic  episodes  were 
found in eight (10.5%) patients, with in total 20 events.

Table 13: Overview of the supportive data in subjects treated with basal insulin and 
metformin (HbA1c, body weight, insulin dose, and hypoglycaemic episodes) 
The  MAH  stated  that  all  the  data  presented  for  subjects  treated  with  basal  insulin  +  metformin 
illustrate  that  the  change  in  HbA1c  observed  in  these  populations  was  associated  with  a  net  weight 
gain  and  a  higher  incidence  of  hypoglycaemic  episodes  compared  to  what  was  observed  in  study 
NN2211-1842.  Finally,  there  was  a  general  need  for  higher  doses  of  insulin  (0.41U/kg  versus  0.68 
U/kg),  i.e.  up  to  40%  more  per  kg  body  weight  compared  to  both  Meneghini  et  al  and  the  pooled 
Levemir  trials  to  achieve  a  clinically  relevant  reduction  in  HbA1c,  compared  to  that  used  by  subjects 
receiving insulin detemir + liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin in the study. 
Therefore,  these  data  support  the  efficacious  combination  of  basal  insulin,  liraglutide  and  metformin, 
where  liraglutide  contributes  to  the  efficacy  with  less  basal  insulin  required  (units/kg),  a  net  weight 
loss or weight neutrality and a lower incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes. 
1.2.5.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  MAH  claimed  an  extension  of  the  indication  for  Victoza  in  the  treatment  of  T2DM  in  combination 
with  basal  insulin  in  patients  not  achieving  glycaemic  control  with  Victoza  and  metformin  alone.  This 
was not considered as acceptable by the CHMP, as this would be more an indication for insulin detemir. 
For  an  indication  for  Victoza,  it  should  be  demonstrated  that  liraglutide  has  a  value  in  efficacy  and 
safety  when  added  to  insulin.  The  design  of  study  NN2211-1842  only  gives  information  about  the 
efficacy and safety of insulin detemir when added to metformin + liraglutide. The design does not allow 
for a conclusion about the added value of liraglutide in this combination. In the study design, an extra 
treatment  arm  with  the  treatment  combination  of  insulin  detemir  +  metformin  is  missing.  The  MAH 
submitted  a  total  of  two  trials,  a  pooled  trial  and  a  data  set  with  type  2  diabetes  patients  using  the 
combination of detemir insulin plus metformin. The idea behind this comparison with subjects included 
in  study  NN2211-1842  was  to  create  an  imaginary  treatment  arm  in  this  study.  In  this  way, 
assessment  of  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  liraglutide  itself  in  the  treatment  combination  with  insulin 
detemir  might  be  possible.  However,  the  study  populations  are  different  in  terms  of  pre-existing 
Assessment report

metabolic control, severity of diabetes, and pre-study medication. Therefore, this additional data is not 
really  helpful  in  the  assessment  of  the  efficacy  of  liraglutide  in  the  combination  treatment. 
Nevertheless,  the  CHMP  considered  it  important  for  the  prescribing  physicians  to  have  access  to 
information reflecting the trial results in the Victoza SmPC in section 5.1.  
In the randomised groups, addition of insulin detemir on top of the combination therapy metformin + 
liraglutide showed a clinically relevant estimated mean change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 of -
0.51%  in  this  study.  Mean  change  (SD)  of  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  26  without  imputations 
resulted  in  -0.04%  (0.68),  vs  -0.51%  (0.75),  for  lira-control  group  vs.  the  detemir+lira  group,  a 
difference of -0.47%. This is comparable to the difference measured with LOCF. 
52  Week  data  were  provided  by  the  MAH.  The  efficacy  data  of  this  26-Week  extensi
on study  were  in 
line  with  the  main  26-Week  efficacy  data.  The  effect  on  HbA1c  was  sustained.  As  expected,  a  larger 
proportion  of  subjects  in  the  detemir+lira  group  achieved  HbA1c  goals  of  <7%  and  ≤6.5%,  in 
comparison with the lira-control group. This difference was clinically relevant. 
Body weight dropped in both treatment groups, with statistically significant difference bet
ween groups 
in  favour  of  the  lira-control  group,  indicating  less  reduction  in  body  weight  when  insulin  is  added  to 
liraglutide.  The  reduction  in  body  weight,  between  baseline  (Week  0),  Week  26  and  Week  52,  was 
however small, and the SD is quite large. 
All secondary endpoints are in line with th
e primary, HbA1c, results. However, all secondary endpoints 
were  only  of  supportive  evidence  to  the  primary  endpoint  since  no  adjustment  for  multiplicity  was 
applied in the analyses of the secondary endpoints. 
Lower number of patients in the lira-control group 
completed the study: 57.1%, versus 80.2% in the 
detemir+lira group. Half of the withdrawals in the randomised liraglutide+metformin arm were due to 
withdrawal criteria (pregnancy; confirmed fasting plasma glucose exceeding 11.1mmol/l (200 mg/dL) 
after  randomisation;  suspicion  of  acute  pancreatitis.  Though  a  higher  number  of  withdrawals  in  the 
randomised liraglutide+metformin arm based on poor glycaemic control would have been expected, no 
details  have  been  provided  regarding  the  distribution  of  withdrawal  criteria.  Data  was  provided 
regarding  the  withdrawals  from  all  treatment  groups.  The  number  of  withdrawals  by  reason  and  by 
week  since  randomisation  did  not  signal  a  specific  pattern  in  between  the  three  treatment  groups. 
Neither did the graphical presentations by withdrawal reason and by week since randomisation cause 
any concerns. 
There were no stati
stically significant differences in systolic or diastolic blood pressure between the two 
randomised treatment arms seen from randomisation to end of study. The MAH demonstrated that the 
reduction of systolic blood pressure seen in the original dossier of liraglutide was in line with the results 
from study NN2211-1842 when the run-in (start liraglutide) was taken into account. In study NN1122-
1842,  systolic  blood  pressure  reductions  were  between  1.6  and  6.3  mmHg  from  run-in  to  52  weeks 
treatment.  In  the  interim  6-months  data,  blood  pressure  lowering  effects  of  liraglutide  between  2.3 
and 6.7 mmHg were observed. However, the systolic blood pressure reduction was numerically larger 
in  patients  treated  with  liraglutide  +  metformin  compared  to  patients  treated  with  liraglutide  + 
metformin + insulin detemir. 
According to the data on blood pressu
re in the original dossier, liraglutide decreased the systolic blood 
pressure  on  average  of  2.3  to  6.7  mmHg  from  baseline  and  compared  to  active  comparator  the 
decrease  was  1.9  to  4.5  mmHg  over  the  duration  of  studies.  This  effect  is  in  contrast  to  the  results 
obtained in study NN2211-1842; though a decrease of 1.34 mmHg was observed from run-in to end of 
treatment  (completers)  for  non-randomised  subjects.  An  increase  in  systolic  blood  pressure  was 
observed  for  the  same  period  for  the  randomised  lira-control  group,  an  increase  that  was  in  fact 
numerically higher than that observed for the detemir+lira group.

Furthermore, metformin treatment was not provided by the sponsor. It was confirmed that appropriate 
actions were taken during the study to ensure compliance to metformin treatment. The mean dose of 
metformin was comparable between groups (2045.3 mg in the lira-control group, versus 2129.8 mg in 
the detemir+lira group). 
1.2.6.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The  triple  therapy  regimen  (insulin  detemir  +  lirag
lutide  +  metformin)  had  a  statistically  significant 
lowering  effect  on  HbA1c  after  26  weeks  of  treatme
nt  when  compared  to  dual  therapy  (liraglutide  + 
metformin). This effect was further supported by a statistically significantly higher number of subjects 
reaching the predefined HbA1c targets of < 7.0% and 6.5% respectively. However study NN2211-1842 
was  designed  to  determine  the  efficacy  of  adding  insulin  determir  to  the  therapy  of  T2DM  patients 
whose glucose levels are not sufficiently controlled on the combination treatment of liraglutide 1.8 mg 
and  metformin.  The  impact  of  liraglutide  in  this  triple  combination  is  not  known  and  therefore  the 
benefit of Victoza in this triple combination has not been demonstrated. 
1.2.7.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A  total  of  987  subjects  w
ere  exposed  to  trial  products.  After  the  run-in  period  39.3%  of  the  subjects 
(n
=323) were inadequately controlled with the combination therapy liraglutide 1.8mg + metformin and 
underwent  randomisation  to  either  insulin  detemir+liraglutide  1.8  mg+metformin  or  liraglutide  1.8 
mg+metformin alone. 
The  subject  exposure  to  trial  products  is  summarised  in  Table  14  and  reflects  the  percentages  in  the 
randomised and non-ra
ndomised treatment groups. The greatest liraglutide exposure was in the non-
randomised  liraglutide  1.8  mg+metformin  group,  with  a  mean  duration  of  427  days.  For  the  two 
randomised treatment groups, mean duration of liraglutide treatment was slightly longer (42 days) in 
subjects  in  the  detemir+lira  group  (411  days)  versus  that  for  subjects  in  the  lira-control  group  (369 
days),  as  also  reflected  in  the  greater  total  subject  exposure  time.  Mean  duration  of  insulin  detemir 
treatment  was  about  326  days  with  a  total  subject  exposure  time  of  145  years  for  subjects  in  the 
detemir+lira group.

Table 14: Summary of exposure to trial drugs – All Exposed Subjects 
For subjects randomised to insulin detemir+liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin, insulin detemir was initiated 
at  a  dose  of  10  U,  with  further  titration  at  visits  depending  on  the  subjects’  self-measured  plasma 
glucose levels. The mean prescribed dose was 0.41 U/kg and 0.45 U/kg for these subjects at Week 26 
and Week 52 respectively. 
Adverse events 
A  summary  of  adverse  events  by  treatment  is  presented  in  Table  15.  The  proportion  of  subjects 
reporting adverse events was comparable between the two randomised treatment groups and also for 
the  non-randomised  treatment  group.  The  incidence  of  adverse  events  with  probable,  possible  or 
unlikely  relation  to  treatment  was  comparable  across  the  two  randomised  treatment  groups  and  the 
non-randomised  treatment  group,  as  were  the  incidences  of  mild,  moderate  and  severe  events.  The 
majority of adverse events was mild in severity and thought to be unlikely related to trial products.

Table 15: Summary of treatment emergent adverse events –Safety Analysis Set 
The most commonly reported adverse events in all treatment groups and for the entire trial period was 
nasopharyngitis  within  the  system  organ  class  infections  and  infestations:  20%,  25%  and  14%  of 
subjects  in  the  detemir+liraglutide,  liraglutide-control  and  the  non-randomised  treatment  groups, 
respectively  (see  Table  16).  Gastrointestinal  disorders,  mostly  nausea,  diarrhoea  and  vomiting  were 
also common in all treatment groups. Increased lipase was reported by a higher proportion of subjects 
in  the  detemir+lira  group  versus  both  the  randomised  and  non-randomised  liraglutide  1.8 
mg+metformin  groups  (16.0%  versus  10.1%  and  11.0%).  Generally,  the  proportion  of  subjects 
reporting  adverse  events  was  comparable  across  the  two  randomised  treatment  groups  and  the  non-
randomised treatment group. 
During  the  extension  phase  of  study  NN2211-1842,  seven  (7)  cases  (4.3%)  of  neoplasms  were 
identified  in  the  detemir+lira  group,  while  one  (1)  was  reported  in  the  liraglutide-control  group  and 
twelve  (12)  neoplasms  (2.4%)  in  the  non-randomised  liraglutide  +  metformin  group.  There  was  no 
apparent clustering in the types of neoplasm seen in the detemir+lira group.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
There were no deaths reported during the main period of the trial. However, two deaths were reported 
during  the  26-week  extension  trial,  both  within  the  system  organ  class  neoplasms  benign,  malignant 
and  unspecified,  and  both  were  rated  as  unlikely  to  be  related  to  treatment.  One  death  was  due  to 
pulmonary  mass  and  metastases  to  the  central  nervous  system  (randomised  liraglutide  1.8  mg  + 
metformin) and the other death was due to gallbladder cancer and metastases to liver (nonrandomised 
liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin). 
The  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  serious  adverse  events  during  the  52-Week  trial  was  overall 
comparable across treatment groups (10.4%, 6.9% and 12.4% for subjects in the detemir+liraglutide 
group,  liraglutide-control  group  and  non-randomised  liraglutide  1.8  mg+metformin,  respectively  see 
Table  17).  A  total  of  123  serious  adverse  events  were  reported  by  97  subjects  (including  ‘early 
withdrawals’)  in  the  entire  trial  period.  For  all  treatments,  most  events  were  unlikely  related  to  trial 
products and severe in nature. No pattern or clustering of events was observed during the main period 
of  the  trial  (week  0-26),  with  most  events  being  reported  by  single  subjects  only  and  spread  across 
several  system  organ  classes.  During  the  26-week  extension  period,  the  most  frequently  reported 
adverse  events  were  within  the  system  organ  class  neoplasms,  benign,  malignant  and  unspecified 
(including cysts and polyps). These were reported by 4 subjects (2.5%) in the detemir+lira group and 
3 subjects (0.6%) in the non-randomised liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin treatment group (see below 
under “Neoplasm related adverse events”).

study –Safety Analysis Set 
Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal of Subjects 
In total, 127 out of 987 subjects (12.9%) exposed to liraglutide withdrew or were withdrawn from the 
trial  due  to  adverse  events.  A  total  of  92  subjects  withdrew  before  the  randomisation  visit  (‘early 
withdrawals’), while 7 subjects (4.3%) of the detemir+liraglutide, 9 subjects (5.6%) of the liraglutide-
control group, and 19 subjects (3.8%) in the non-randomised group withdrew after randomisation. No 
treatment difference or clustering in type of adverse event withdrawals were observed. The reasons for 
withdrawing for  the  seven  subjects  out  of  the  detemir+lira  group  were  (all items  were mentioned  for 
one  subject  only):  increased  lipase;  increased  pancreatic  enzymes;  abdominal  pain  with  diarrhoea; 
gastric carcinoma; convulsion; renal failure; and bronchopulmonary disease. 
Hypoglycaemia 
One  (1)  subject  experienced  24  episodes  of  minor  and  symptoms-only  hypoglycaemia;  this  subject 
was  identified  as  an  outlier  prior  to  database  lock  for  the  26-week  main  period  of  the  trial  and  was 
excluded from the analyses. 
The  rate  of  minor  and  symptomatic  only  hypoglycaemic  episodes  reported  during  the  main  and  the 
extension period was compared for the two randomised treatment groups in Table 18. Overall, the rate 
of  minor  hypoglycaemic  episodes  was  low  across  all  treatment  groups,  at  0.228,  0.034  and  0.115 
events  per  subject  year  for  the  detemir+liraglutide,  liraglutide-control  and  the  non-randomised 
liraglutide  group,  respectively.  A  similar  pattern  was  evident  for  ‘symptoms  only’  hypoglycaemic 
episodes,  with  the  highest  rate  being  reported  for  subjects  in  the  detemir+liraglutide  group  (0.394 
events  per  subject  year),  followed  by  subjects  in  the  liraglutide-control  (0.119)  and  non-randomised 
(0.091) treatment groups. 
The rate of both all episodes and minor hypoglycaemic episodes was significantly higher in the insulin 
detemir  +  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin  treated  subjects  compared  to  the  liraglutide  1.8  mg  + 
metformin  treated  subjects  (p=0.0012  and  p=0.0011,  respectively).  When  including  this  outlier,  no 
statistically significant treatment differences were observed. The number of subjects reporting both all 
hypoglycaemic  episodes  and  minor  episodes  was  significantly  higher  in  the  detemir+lira  group 
compared to the lira-control group (p=0.0009 and p=0.0017, respectively). No statistically significant 
treatment  difference  was  observed  for  the  number  of  subjects  reporting  hypoglycaemic  episodes 
classified as symptoms only.

Table 18: Analysis of hypoglycaemic episodes during main and extension period 
(excluding outlier*)–Safety Analysis Set 
* One subject, a 57-year-old female, reporting 24 minor and symptoms only hypoglycaemic episodes 
was  identified  as  an  outlier  prior  to  database  lock  for  the  26-week  main  period  of  the  trial.  The  first 
episode  was  reported  prior  to  trial  drug  start  during  the  screening  phase  (symptoms  only,  blood 
glucose  3.3  mmol/L).  The  next  event  occurred  after  16  days  of  liraglutide  and  metformin  treatment. 
The subject had a history of hypoglycaemia since 2007, which was specified as ongoing at the time of 
screening. When including this outlier, no statistically significant treatment differences were observed. 
Neoplasm related adverse events 
A  summary of  neoplasm adverse  events  reported  during  the  12-week  run-in,  26-week  main  trial  and 
26-week  extension  period  is  presented  in  Table  19.  Twenty-one  (21)  neoplasm  adverse  events  were 
reported  by  20  subjects.  The  number  of  events  was  small  and  most  events  were  reported  by  single 
subjects  only.  No  clustering  in  the  types  of  neoplasms  reported  was  observed.  Of  the  21  events 
reported,  11  were  serious  and  3  led  to  trial  product  withdrawal.  Eleven  (11)  of  the  subjects  fully 
recovered or were recovering at time of reporting.

Following  the  reporting  of  7  cases  of  neoplasms  in  the  triple  combination  arm  (insulin  detemir  + 
liraglutide + metformin) during the extension phase of study NN2211-1842, the MAH was requested by 
the  CHMP  to  justify  that  that  the  triple  combination  can  be  used  safely  and  to  discuss  possible 
mechanisms and ways to further elucidate this concern. To address this concern the MAH provided the 
following: 
  An  exploration  of  study  NN2211-1842  data-set  for  any  indication  of  a  tumour  growth 
promoting effects in the triple combination arm by considering all treatment emergent AEs. 
  All  narratives  and  additional  clinical  information  as  well  as  follow-up  information  to  enable  a 
comprehensive overview of the potential additional risk factors identified for each event. For all 
the malignant neoplasms, further evaluation of confounding risk factors was done. 
  A  statistical  (post-hoc)  analysis  of  the  neoplasm  events  (total  and  malignant  cases  alone) 
including  several  sensitivity  analyses  for  evaluation  of  statistical  differences  between  the 
treatment groups. 
 
In  a  separate  statistical  sub-analysis,  the  NN2211-1842  data  have  been  investigated  for  any 
significant  difference  between  the  two  treatments  (insulin  detemir  +  liraglutide  +  metformin 
and  liraglutide  +  metformin)  in  the  development  of  a  new  neoplasm  among  subjects  with  a 
previous  event  of  neoplasms  according  to  their  medical  history.  This  was  done  in  order  to 
further  disclose  any  potential  tumour  growth  promoting  effect  of  the  triple  combination 
therapy. 
  Based  on  non-clinical  and  clinical  data,  discussion  on  any  possible  mechanisms  for 
tumourgenicity  and  a  tumour  growth  promoting  effect  of  insulin  and  liraglutide,  both 
individually and combined 
 
Potential actions to further elucidate and ensure ongoing surveillance regarding this concern. 
The MAH provided extensive narrative information. There were 6 patients with malignant neoplasms in 
the triple combination arm, of which one, however, had a wrong date of onset (event occurred before 
administration  of  insulin  detemir)  which  leaves  5  patients  with  malignant  event.  In  the  randomised 
lira+met arm there was 1 patient with a malignant neoplasm and in the non-randomised lira+met arm 
arm  there  were  5  malignant  events  in  4  patients.  The  proportion  of  malignant  events  was  thus 
distinctly higher in the triple combination arm (5/163; 3.1%) compared to the randomised control arm 
(1/159;  0.6%)  or  compared  to  the  pooled  lira+met  arms  (5/658;  0.8%).  The  MAH  stated  that  the 
larger  drop-out  rate  in  the  randomised  and  non-randomised  control  group  accounted  for  relatively 
higher numbers of neoplasms in the triple therapy group. Taking these withdrawals into account, the 
proportion of malignant neoplasms would be 3.85% (5/[162-32]) in the insulin detemir + liraglutide + 
metformin  group,  compared  to  0.79%  (1/[161-53])  in  the  randomised  control  group,  and  0.74% 
(4/[(161-53)+(498-66)])  in  the  pooled  liraglutide  +  metformin  group.  In  conclusion,  even  after 
correction  of  withdrawal  rates  and  removing  the  patient  who  developed  malignant  neoplasm  before 
starting  the  triple  therapy,  there  is  a  higher  proportion  of  malignant  cases  in  the  insulin  detemir  + 
liraglutide + metformin group compared to the control groups in study NN 2211-1842. 
No  contributing  risk 
factors  could  be 
identified 
for 
the  malignancy 
in 
the  randomised 
liraglutide+metformin  arm.  Among  the  4  subjects  with  malignant  events  in  the  non-randomised  arm 
the MA identified 2 patients with potentially contributing/risk factors. 
The majority of the malignant cases was confounded by strong risk factors and contributing factors for 
cancer and that there were few”un-explained” malignant neoplasms. However, an alternative 
explanation could still be the promotion of the malignant tumours by the detemir/liraglutide treatment 
in patients with risk factors. This can not be rule out at the moment.

None  of  the  conducted  post-hoc  statistical  analyses  supported  the  concern  regarding  a  growth 
promoting  effect  of  the  triple  combination  treatment.  However,  the  most  important  test  showed  an 
estimated OR for reporting a malignant neoplasm related TEAE between the two randomised treatment 
arms  of  5.0  with  a  95%  CI  [0.58;  43.28],  without  taking  the  falsely  included  malignant  case  in  the 
triple  group  into  account.  Since  the  CI  contained  the  “1”,  no  statistically  significant  difference  was 
shown, but numbers are too low for any statistical conclusions. 
The  growth  promoting  effect  was  also  not  suggested  by  the  non-clinical  data.  Long-term 
carcinogenicity studies with metformin have been performed in rats (≤900 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks) 
and  in  mice  (≤1500  mg/kg/day  for  91  weeks).  No  evidence  of  carcinogenicity  was  found  in  male  or 
female mice or in male rats.  
Standard  carcinogenicity  studies  were  not  performed  with  insulin  detemir.  Insulin  detemir  has  a 
slightly  lower  affinity  than  insulin  itself  for  the  insulin  receptors  (IR-A  and  IR-B)  and  the  insulin-like 
Growth  Factor-1  (IGF-1)  receptor.  Especially  the  IGF-1  receptor  has  been  linked  to  the  mitogenic 
effects of insulin and insulin analogues (Kazda et al., 2010). Insulin detemir has also been tested for 
mitogenic  potency  in  vitro  by  the  MAH  (data  are  only  submitted  as  preliminary  data  in  the  response 
document)  and  others  (Weinstein  et  al.,  2009).  While  Weinstein  et  al.  (2009)  showed  slightly  higher 
potencies  of  insulin  detemir  as  compared  to  insulin  in  several  cell  lines  (HCT-116,  PC-3  and  MCF-7 
cancer  cells),  the  MAH  only  observed  lower  potencies  of  insulin  detemir  as  compared  to  insulin  in  a 
similar  (MCF-7)  and  several  different  cell lines  (Colo205,  L6hIR  and  HMEC).  The  MAH  is  requested  to 
submit the final study report has not been submitted. Following up to 26 weeks of treatment, insulin 
detemir  was  found  to  stimulate  rat  mammary  gland  cell  proliferation  in  vivo  to  the  same  extent  as 
human  insulin.  Hence,  the  available  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  non-clinical  data  suggest  that  the  mitogenic 
potential of levemir is similar to that of native human insulin.  
In carcinogenicity studies conducted with liraglutide, C-cell tumours were observed in mice and rats. A 
NOAEL value for these findings was established in mice at 0.2 mg liraglutide/kg/day, which results in 
plasma exposure levels similar to what is obtained in the clinic. A NOAEL value was not established in 
rats. A number of exploratory studies have been conducted in order to evaluate the mechanism behind 
carcinogenic  effect  of  liraglutide  on  rodent  C-cells.  The  relevance  for  humans  is  likely  to  be  low  but 
cannot  be  completely  excluded.  Other  types  of  tumours  were  also  observed  in  the  carcinogenicity 
studies  especially  in  female  animals.  However,  the  relevance  of  these  tumour  findings  for  human 
safety  was  considered  limited  to  due  the  lack  of  an  apparent  dose-response  relationship,  sufficient 
safety  margins  and/or  the  experimental  conditions.  Both  insulin  and  GLP-1  receptors  are  known  to 
cause  cell  proliferation  upon  stimulation.  Based  on  the  current  understanding  of  the  molecular 
mechanisms  of  insulin  and  GLP-1  action,  these  hormones  and  their  analogues  activate  different 
intracellular  signalling  pathways.  Additive  and  synergic  interactions  are  therefore  not  considered 
unlikely.  However,  the  proliferative  effects  of  these  pathways  seem  to  be  limited  to  specific  types  of 
cells. Hence, insulin and GLP-1 including their analogues are unlikely to be general growth promoters. 
Both insulin and GLP-1 receptors are known to cause cell proliferation upon stimulation. Based on the

limited to specific types of cells. Hence, insulin and GLP-1 including their analogues are unlikely to be 
general growth promoters. On the contrary, it is expected that a potential proliferative response due to 
combination treatments with liraglutide and insulin detemir would depend on the responsiveness of the 
different  cell  types  to  both  pathways.  The  present  data  indicate  a  clear  distinction  in  the  cell  types 
responsive  to  either  insulin  or  GLP-1  receptor  activation  in  terms  of  cell  proliferation  and  tumour 
formation. Furthermore, the MAH has studied the combined effect of insulin detemir and liraglutide on 
cell  growth  in  a  colon  cancer  cell  line  (only  preliminary  data  were  submitted  by  the  MAH).  These 
Assessment report

preliminary data showed that increasing concentrations of liraglutide had no apparent influence on the 
concentration-response relationship of insulin detemir. 
Overall,  the  weight  of  evidence  for  an  additive  or  synergic  tumour  promotion  due  to  combination 
treatments with metformin, insulin detemir and liraglutide is currently considered sparse from a non-
clinical perspective and the potential risk is presently only theoretical. 
Regarding the clinical data, MAH referred to the well-known association of type 2 diabetes and obesity 
with certain types of cancer. However, there are controversial publications from several predominantly 
epidemiological  studies  on  the  association  between  insulin,  in  particular  insulin  glargin,  and  cancer 
(Yang,  Diabetes  2010,  Hemkens,  Diabetologia  2009,  Jonasson,  Diabetologia  2009,  Colhoun, 
Diabetologia  2009,  Rosenstock,  Diabetologia  2009).  The  MAH  also  referred  to  an  individual  patient 
data  meta-analysis  of  randomised  trials  sponsored  by  the  MAH  in  8693  patients  (Dejgaard, 
Diabetologia  2009)  where  patients  with  insulin  detemir  had  a  lower  or  similar  occurrence  of  cancer 
compared  to  patients  treated  with  NPH  insulin  or  insulin  glargine,  respectively.  However,  the  trials 
were of limited duration, without post trial follow-up and not designed to assess the risk of cancer.  
Accordingly, it is self-evident that final conclusions on a potential risk of detemir and liraglutide cannot 
be drawn from study NN2211-1842. 
According  to  the  CHMP,  the  signal  of  a  tumour  promoting  risk  is  not  as  strong  as  to  advice  against 
updating  the  Victoza  SmPC  with  the  results  of  study  NN2211-1842.  It  is,  however,  considered  to 
important to follow up on this potential concern. 
Without  large  randomised  long  term  studies  with  cancer  endpoints  the  issue  of  a  potential  growth 
promoting  effect  of  the  combination  of  insulin  detemir  and  liraglutide  cannot  be  answered.  Based  on 
the  overall  evidence  currently  available,  however,  the  signal  of  a  potential  tumour  promoting  effect 
seems  not  as  strong  as  to  advise  against  the  use  of  this  combination  treatment.  In  this  respect  the 
devastating  effects  of  insufficiently  controlled  diabetes  should  also  be  weighed  against  this  potential 
risk.  The  Pharmacovigilance  measures  proposed  by  the  MAH  are  supported  by  the  CHMP,  and  have 
been implemented in the RMP. 
Pancreas related adverse events 
Pancreas related adverse events were to be reported as MESIs to establish if there were indications of 
pancreatitis.  The  pancreas  related  adverse  events  reported  during  both  run-in,  main  and  extension 
period are presented in Table 20. The overall proportion of subjects reporting pancreas related adverse 
events was higher for the detemir+lira group compared to the lira-control group and non-randomised 
liraglutide group, 11.0% vs. 8.8% and 7.8%, respectively. 
The  most  commonly  reported  pancreas  related  adverse  events  were  increased  lipase,  reported  by 
similar  proportions  of  subjects  within  treatment  groups  and  at  9.8%,  7.5%  and  7.4%  of  subjects 
treated  with  insulin  detemir  +  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin,  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin  and 
nonrandomised liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin, respectively. 
Four (4) cases of pancreatitis were reported by four subjects during the trial period. One subject with 
acute  pancreatitis  withdrew  early.  One  (1)  case  of  acute  pancreatitis  and  one  (1)  case  of  chronic 
pancreatitis were diagnosed in the lira-control group, whereas one case of unspecified pancreatitis was 
diagnosed in the non-randomised liraglutide group.

Thyroid related adverse events 
The overall proportion of subjects reporting thyroid related adverse events was 1.2%, 2.5% and 4.2% 
of  subjects  reporting  an  event  in  the  detemir+lira  group,  lira-control  group  and  the  non-randomised 
liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin  treatment  group,  respectively.  The  most  frequently  reported  thyroid 
related adverse event in all treatment groups was increased calcitonin, which was reported by single or 
few  subjects  in  each  treatment  group.  For  the  entire  trial  period,  including  follow-up  information  on 
adverse  events  reported  in  the  26-week  main  trial  period,  3  thyroid  neoplasms  were  reported  (all  in 
the  non-randomised  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin  treatment  group).  No  malignancy was  suspected 
in any of these cases. 
Cardiovascular safety 
In  line  with  previous  experience  from  liraglutide  trials  and  as  reported  in  the  original  MAA,  a  slight 
increase  in  pulse  was  observed  across  treatment  groups  in  all  treatment  groups  during  the  run-in 
period. There was no difference seen between treatment groups. 
Laboratory findings 
The  most  common  clinical  laboratory  adverse  event  in  all  treatment  groups  were  increased  lipase, 
reported  by  16.0%,  10.1%  and  11.0%  for  subjects  in  the  detemir+lira  group,  lira-control  group  and 
the  non-randomised  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin  group,  respectively.  Fluctuations  in  lipase  values 
over time were observed for all subjects, with no apparent or consistent trends. A total of 124 subjects 
reported lipase values above 2x UNR in the main period of the trial (15.1%). Of these, 23 subjects had 
lipase  values  above  2x  UNR  at  run-in.  The  increase  in lipase  did  not  appear  to  be  associated  with  an 
increased  reporting  of  gastrointestinal  adverse  events.  One  of  the  clinical  laboratory  adverse  events 
was serious: increased lipase, reported by a subject treated with liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin, and 
classified  as  severe.  The  subject  recovered,  without  change  in  dose.  It  was  clarified  by  the  MAH  that 
this  difference  in  increased  lipase  was  evident  also  before  patients  were  randomised  to  study 
treatment. Serum lipase did not seem to increase over time in any of the treatment groups and most 
importantly,  in  study  NN2211-1842  elevated  serum  lipase  was  not  associated  with  increases  in 
amylase or the observed events of pancreatitis.

Overall,  the  clinical  laboratory  evaluations  observed  in  the  trial  are  in  line  with  those  reported  in  the 
original MAA. 
Immunological events 
Between  Week  0  (randomisation)  and  Weeks  52  and  53,  only  single  subjects  tested  positive  for 
liraglutide  antibodies.  No  treatment  group  difference  in  terms  of  numbers  of  subjects  being  positive 
over time was apparent. At Week 53, where only subjects who were off drug between Weeks 52 and 
53 were included, 4 (3.7%), 2 (2.1%) and 15 (4.0%) subjects were positive for liraglutide antibodies 
in  the  insulin  detemir  +  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin,  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin  and  non-
randomised  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin  treatment  groups,  respectively.  All  but  one  of  these 
subjects  had  antibodies  exhibiting  cross-reactivity,  whereas  7  subjects  had  antibodies  demonstrating 
neutralising effects (1 subject treated with insulin detemir and 6 subjects treated with non-randomised 
liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin). 
Overall, levels of antibodies specific to insulin detemir remained low during the trial (mean 1.68 %B/T 
at Week 0 and mean 4.30 %B/T at Week 53 for subjects off drug between Weeks 52 and 53). A slight 
increase was observed from Week 0 (randomisation) to Week 53 (subjects off drug between Weeks 52 
and 53) in antibodies with cross-reacting effect (mean -0.08 %B/T at Week 0 and mean 11.74 %B/T at 
Week 53).

Post-marketing reports of ketoacidosis 
Since  the  PSUR  submission  in  August  2010,  a  few  spontaneous  case  reports  of  diabetic  ketoacidosis, 
due to switch from insulin to Victoza in insulin dependent patients, were identified during routine safety 
surveillance  of  Victoza.  Following  the  Japanese  launch  of  Victoza,  a  cluster  of  cases  was  identified  in 
Japan.  Two  of  the  cases  had  a  fatal  outcome.  The  product  label  in  Japan  was  updated  immediately 
following these incidences. The MAH proposed to update the Victoza SmPC to ensure correct use of the 
product and to prevent this inappropriate and off-label use.  
A  total  of  334  cases  of  hyperglycaemia  have  been  reported  by  the  MAH.  Of  these  cases,  26  were 
reported  as  serious  adverse  events  and  308  as  non-serious  adverse  events.  Information  on  either 
current concomitant use of insulin (n=37/334) or switch from insulin (n=28/334) was available in 65 
cases (50 non-serious cases; 15 serious cases). 
From  the  total  of  26  serious  cases,  2  cases  were  confirmed  type  1  diabetes  mellitus  patients  (cases 
292059;  312067).  A  total  of  16  cases  were  reported  as  type  2  diabetes  mellitus.  From  these  cases, 
cases  309592  and  314183  were  later  suspected  of  having  type  1  diabetes  mellitus  and  case  314183 
also was reported as having a positive anti-GAD antibody test; case 306877 was later diagnosed with 
Type 1 diabetes. 
A  total  of  8  cases  were  reported  as  either  ‘drug  used  for  unknown  indication’  or  ‘diabetes  mellitus’ 
without specification of subtype of disease. Among the 308 cases reported as non-serious, information 
on insulin treatment was available in 50 cases; 15 cases had information confirming a switch from an 
insulin-containing regimen, 35 cases had information confirming concomitant use of insulin. 
It  is  not  unusual  for  diabetic  patients  to  experience  bouts  of  hyperglycaemia  even  when  they  are  on 
adequate  therapy  as  glycaemic  control  depends  on  several  factors  apart  from  the  therapy.  This  is 
acceptable  as  long  as  the  hyperglycaemic  episodes  are  transient  and  not  serious.  The  non  serious 
cases belong to that category. 
In  the  complete  data  set  of  334  hyperglycaemia  cases,  information  confirming  a  switch  from  an 
insulin-containing regimen was available in 28/333 (8.4%). There was no pattern in the type of insulin-
containing  regimen  to  be  switched  from,  as  both  basal-bolus  regimens  and  premix  regimens  were 
reported.  Of  the  10  cases  reported  as  diabetic  ketoacidosis  or  ketoacidosis,  9  occurred  after 
discontinuation of an insulin-containing regimen. 
Duration of treatment of Victoza in the 26 serious cases ranged from 1 day to 175 days with a median 
of 16.5 days. 
Upon  identification  of  the  Japanese  cases,  the  MAH  initiated  actions  to  ensure  appropriate  use  of  the 
product.  These  actions  are  all  described  in  the  revised  Risk  Management  Plan  submitted  with  this 
application (please refer to the RMP section below). 
Based on the described cases of hyperglycaemia the MAH proposed to amend section 4.4 of the SmPC 
and  section  2  of  the  Package  Leaflet  (refer  to  section  Changes  to  the  SmPC,  Annex  II,  Labelling  and 
Package below). 
1.2.8.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In  study  NN2211-1842,  the  mean  duration  of  liraglutide  treatment  was  411  days  for  subjects  in  the 
detemir+lira  group  and  369  days  for  subjects  in  the  lira-control  group.  The  mean  duration  of  insulin 
detemir  treatment  was  about  326  days  and  with  a  total  subject  exposure  time  of  145  years  for 
subjects in the detemir+lira group. 
Assessment report

The overall pattern and frequencies of the most common adverse events in study NN2211-1842 when 
insulin  detemir  was  added  to  the  combination  of  liraglutide  1.8mg  +  metfomin  was  similar  to  the 
overall  safety  profile  observed  for  liraglutide  therapy  +  metformin  therapy.  The  overall  safety  profile 
was further confirmed by week 52 safety data submitted by the MAH during the evaluation. 
The  AE-profile  was  initially  only  presented  for  AEs  occurring  in  >5%  of  patients.  Following  a  request 
from the CHMP, tables presenting TEAES with incidences >1% of subjects were provided by the MAH 
during  the  evaluation.  No  new  safety  concerns,  besides  the  earlier  mentioned  malignancies,  were 
identified. 
Several adverse events were pre-specified as medical events of special interest (MESIs) most of them 
originating  from  the  original  MAA  for  liraglutide:  pancreas  related  events,  thyroid  related  events, 
injection site reactions and neoplasms. A potential signal of an increased lipase was noticed in 11% in 
the  insulin  detemir  +  liraglutide  group  compared  to  the  other  groups  (3.4%  and  3.8%).  There  was 
even  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  with  increased  lipase  who  were  not  specified  as  “pancreas 
related”  lipase  increases,  with  16.0%  subjects  in  the  detemir+lira  group,  10.1%  in  the  lira-control 
group, and 11.0% in the non-randomised group. It was clarified that the difference between treatment 
groups  was  evident  also  before  patients  were  randomised  to  study  treatment.  Serum  lipase  did  not 
seem  to  increase  over  time  in  any  of  the  treatment  groups  and  most  importantly,  in  study  NN2211-
1842  elevated  serum  lipase  was  not  associated  with  increases  in  amylase  or  the  observed  events  of 
pancreatitis. 
Also  of  note  is  the  frequency  of  neoplasms  reported  during  study  NN  2211-1842.  During  the  main 
study  period  (26W)  0%,  0.6%  and  2.0%  were  observed  in  the  detemir+lira  group,  lira-control  group 
and the non-randomised group, respectively. 52 Weeks safety data were submitted by the MAH during 
the  evaluation  in  which  it  became  apparent  that  7  new  cases  (4.3%,  6  of  them  were  malignant)  of 
neoplasms were identified in the detemir+lira group during the 26 Week extension period of which one 
malignant  case  turned  out  to  have  a  wrong  date  of  onset  (event  occurred  before  administration  of 
insulin detemir). No additional neoplasms were identified in the liraglutide-control group whereas two 
neoplasms 
(2.4%),  of  which  one  malignant,  were  observed 
in 
the  non-randomised 
liraglutide+metformin group. There was no apparent clustering in the types of neoplasm seen in any of 
the  detemir+liraglutide+metformin  group.  The  number  of  malignant  neoplasms  was  5  in  the  triple 
combination arm. In the randomised lira-control group there was one malignant event. Whereas in the 
non-randomised  lira+met  arm;  there  were  5  malignant  events  in  4  patients.  The  percentage  of 
malignant events was thus higher in the triple combination arm (5/163; 3.1%) compared to the pooled 
liraglutide + metformin arms (5/658; 0.8%). The MAH addressed this safety concern by providing non-
clinical  and  clinical  information,  by  conducting  further  statistical  analyses  and  by  providing  narratives 
of  all  neoplasm  cases.  The  majority  of  the  malignant  cases  seems  confounded  by  strong  risk  factors 
and contributing factors for cancer. None of the conducted post-hoc statistical analyses supported the 
concern  regarding  a  growth  promoting  effect  of  the  triple  combination  treatment.  Based  on  the  non-
clinical data, the weight of evidence for an additive or synergic tumour promotion due to combination 
treatments  with  metformin,  insulin  detemir  and  liraglutide  is  currently  considered  sparse  and 
inconclusive.  Regarding  the  clinical  data,  the  MAH  referred  to  the  well-known  association  of  type  2 
diabetes  and  obesity  with  certain  types  of  cancer.  With  respect  to  the  association  between  insulin, in 
particular  insulin  glargin  (Lantus)  there  are  controversial  data  and  further  data  of  ongoing 
observational  studies  are  awaited.  In  summary,  final  conclusions  on  a  potential  risk  of  detemir  and 
liraglutide cannot be drawn from the current study. 
There were no major hypoglycaemic events during the main period. The rate of minor hypoglycaemic 
episodes was low, but as expected the highest rate for the detemir+lira group: 0.228, 0.034 and 0.115 
events  per  subject  years  for  patients  in  the  detemir+lira  group,  lira-control  group  and  the  non-
randomised  liraglutide  1.8  mg+metformin,  respectively.  This  difference  in  minor  hypoglycaemic 
Assessment report  
Page 43/57
 
 
 
   
 
episodes  reported  between  the  two  randomised  treatment  groups  was  statistically  significant 
(p=0.0011). 
Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall,  based  on  the  safety  data  from  this  52  Week  study,  the  overall  safety  profile  observed  with 
insulin  detemir  in  combination  with  liraglutide  is  comparable  to  what  is  already  known  for  liraglutide 
and insulin detemir separately. However, more neoplasms were noted in the metformin + liraglutide + 
detemir  group  but  the  data  are  inconclusive.  The  MAH  has  updated  their  RMP  with  further 
pharmacovigilance  activities  to  address  this  safety  concern.  This  was  considered  acceptable  by  the 
CHMP. 
1.2.9.  Risk Management Plan 
As  part  of  this  grouping  of  two  type  II  variations,  the  MAH  submitted  an  update  of  the  Risk 
Management Plan (RMP) (version 13, dated 22 September 2011).

Adverse Events/Adverse Reactions 
Important identified risks 
Hyperglycaemia due to discontinuation of insulin has been added as an important identified risks: 
During  routine  post-marketing  safety  surveillance  of  spontaneous  reports,  the  MAH  identified  reports 
containing  events  related  to  hyperglycaemia  due  to  discontinuation  of  insulin  in  insulin-dependent 
patients. Victoza was started in these patients subsequent to insulin discontinuation. Hyperglycaemia is 
a  known  risk  in  patients  who  are  dependent  on  insulin  to  maintain  blood  glucose  homeostasis.  When 
these individual discontinue insulin treatment they develop severe hyperglycaemia, which may lead to 
diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycaemic coma. The risk of hyperglycaemia is not related to Victoza, but 
is a consequence of the inappropriate discontinuation of insulin therapy. Therefore, the MAH decided to 
update the CCDS, ‘hyperglycaemia due to discontinuation of insulin’ was included as an identified risk 
in order to closely monitor these reports and follow-up questions have been developed.

1.2.10.  Changes to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet 
Following the assessment of this grouping of two type II variations, the CHMP endorsed the following 
changes  to  the  SmPC  and  to  the  Package  Leaflet  (underlined  =  new  text,  strikethrough  =  deleted 
text): 
Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use of the SmPC 
Victoza is not a substitute for insulin.  
The addition of liraglutide in patients already treated with insulin has not been evaluated and is 
therefore not recommended. 
Section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction of the 
SmPC 
Insulin 
No pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed between liraglutide and insulin 
detemir when administering a single dose of insulin detemir 0.5 U/kg with liraglutide 1.8 mg at steady 
state in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties of the SmPC 
In a 52 week clinical trial, the addition of insulin detemir to Victoza® 1.8 mg and metformin in patients 
not achieving glycemic targets on Victoza® and metformin alone, resulted in a HbA1c decrease from 
baseline of 0.54%, compared to 0.20% in the Victoza® 1.8 mg and metformin control group. Weight 
loss was sustained. There was a small increase in the rate of minor hypoglycaemic episodes (0.23 
versus 0.03 events per subject years. The addition of liraglutide in patients already treated with insulin 
has not been evaluated (see section 4.4). 
Section 2 Before you use Victoza of the Package Leaflet 
Victoza should not be used if you have type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. Victoza is not an 
insulin. Victoza should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years. 
In particular, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are using medicines for diabetes containing 
any of the following active substances: 
• 
insulin. Victoza is not recommended if you are already using insulin. 
In  addition  the  MAH  has  taken  the  opportunity  to  align  the  Annexes  with  version  7.3.1  of  the  QRD 
template, to delete the DDPS version number and to update the RMP version number from Annex IIB. 
Minor  editorial  changes  have  been  made  throughout the  Annexes.  Finally in  section  6  of  the  Package 
Leaflet , the pictures for the instructions of using Victoza have been changed so that the fingers in the 
pictures are now white instead of yellow. 
The CHMP agreed with the changes to the Annexes requested by the MAH listed above.

2.  Benefit Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Initially, the MAH claimed an extension of the indication for Victoza: “In combination with basal insulin 
in  patients  not  achieving  adequate  glycaemic  control  with  Victoza  and  metformin”.  This  was  not 
considered acceptable by the CHMP, as this is an indication for insulin detemir and not for Victoza. To 
get  an  extension  of  indication  for  Victoza,  the  added  value  of  adding  Victoza  to  insulin  detemir  + 
metformin should be demonstrated in terms of efficacy and safety. The design of study NN2211-1842 
only  gives  information  about  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  insulin  detemir  when  added  to  metformin  + 
liraglutide. The shortcomings of study NN2211-1842 were acknowledged by the MAH who proposed to 
include instead only some efficacy and safety data regarding study NN2211-1842 in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. 
The  MAH  submitted  two  clinical  trials:  one  PK/PD  trial  (study  NN2211-3673)and  one  clinical  efficacy 
and safety study (study NN2211-1842). 
During  the  PK/PD  study  (study  NN2211-3673),  no  pharmacokinetic  interaction  between  insulin  and 
liraglutide was observed. According to the predefined no effect boundary of  [0.8, 1.25], liraglutide at 
steady  state  did  not  affect  the  pharmacokinetic  endpoints  (AUC,  Cmax)  of  insulin  detemir  and  vice 
versa. No pharmacodynamic interaction was observed; the treatments had an additive effect. The sum 
of  the  mean  AUCGIR  for  liraglutide  and  insulin  detemir  given  individually  was  similar  to  that  obtained 
when the two were given in combination. 
In  the  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  trial  NN221-1842  patients  included  were  a  relatively  healthy 
subgroup of type 2 DM patients. Furthermore, the trial design was open-label. The study duration was 
52  weeks,  and  the  number  of  patients  participating  in  the  study  was  limited  (total  study  population 
323  patients).  Patients  inadequately  controlled  by  Metformin  (≥1500  mg  daily)  or  Metformin  +  low 
dose SU (≤ half maximum dose) were switched to Metformin (same dose) + Liraglutide 1.8 mg daily. 
Subjects not adequately controlled after 12 weeks were randomised to receive insulin detemir as add-
on to Metformin + Liraglutide or continued on Metformin + Liraglutide. Addition of insulin to liraglutide 
+ metformin demonstrated a favourable, clinically relevant effect on the blood glucose control in terms 
of HbA1c reduction. The change from baseline in HbA1c in the triple therapy group at week 26 was (LS 
mean changes) -0.51%, vs. +0.02% in the metformin + liraglutide group (difference -0.52 [CI: -0.68; 
-0.36]).  The  estimated  proportions  of  subjects  achieving  HbA1c  both  <7%  and  ≤6.5%  were 
significantly greater with insulin detemir + liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin (44% and 19%) compared 
to liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin (20% and 7%). 
Improvements in other endpoints of glucose control were observed, including mean change in FPG and 
changes  in  post-prandial  glucose  levels.  The  glucose  lowering  effects  were  sustained  during  the 
extension period up to week 52.  
After 52 weeks, a mean reduction in body weight was observed in all treatment groups. However, the 
reduction  in  body  weight  was  less  when  insulin  was  added  to  the  metformin  +  liraglutide  treatment. 
The  estimated  mean  reductions  in  body  weight  were  0.05  kg  and  1.02  kg  in  the  detemir+lira  group 
and  lira-control  group,  respectively,  with  an  estimated  mean  difference  (95%  CI)  between  groups  of 
0.97 (0.04; 1.91), p=0.0416.

Risks 
The  overall  pattern  and  frequencies  of  the  most  common  adverse  events  in  study  NN2211-1842 
corresponds  to  what  was  observed  during  the  original  MAA  for  liraglutide  and  insulin  detemir,  except 
for  the  frequency  of  nasopharyngitis  which  was  considerably  higher  in  the  lira-control  group  vs.  the 
other  two  treatment  groups  after  26  weeks  as  well  as  vs.  the  original  dossier  for  liraglutide  1.8% 
(20.8% vs. 11.0-14.7% vs. 8.8%). 
The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  events  during  the  52-Week  study  (run-in,  26-week  main  and 
26-week  extension  period)  were  nasopharyngitis,  nausea  and,  diarrhoea  reported  by  20.2%,  18.4% 
and  17.8%  in  the  detemir+lira  group  versus  and  25.2%,  23.3%  and  16.4%  of  subjects  in  the  lira-
control  group.  Thyroid  related  adverse  events  were  reported  in  all  treatment  groups,  with  1.2%  and 
2.5% of subjects reporting an event in the detemir+lira group and the lira-control group respectively. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  serious  adverse  events  during  the  52-Week  trial  period  was 
10.4%  in  the  detemir+lira  group,  versus  6.9%  in  the  lira-control  group.  Most  of  the  serious  adverse 
events were evaluated as unlikely related to trial product and no clustering of events was observed. 
No  major  hypoglycaemic  events  were  seen  during  the  main  period  of  the  trial.  The  rate  of  minor 
hypoglycaemic  episodes  was  higher  in  the  detemir+lira  group,  compared  with  the  lira-control  group, 
with  0.228  and  0.034  events  per  subject  years  respectively.  The  estimated  rate  ratio  (detemir+lira 
group/lira-control group) in minor hypoglycaemic episodes was 6.80 (2.14; 21.60), p=0.0011. 
After  submission  of  the  safety  data  from  the  26  weeks  extension  study  it  became  apparent  that  the 
number  of  patients  with  a  neoplasm  was  highest  in  the  triple  combination  arm  (insulin  detemir  + 
liraglutide + metformin). The number of malignant neoplasms was 6 in the triple combination arm, of 
which  one,  however,  had  a  wrong  date  of  onset  (event  occurred  before  administration  of  insulin 
detemir) which leaves 5 patients with malignant event. In the randomised liraglutide + metformin arm, 
there  was  1  patient  with  a  malignant  neoplasm  and  in  the  non-randomised  lira+met  arm  arm  there 
were  5  malignant  events  in  4  patients.  The  percentage  of  malignant  events  was  thus  higher  in  the 
triple  combination  arm  (5/163;  3.1%)  compared  to  the  pooled  liraglutide  +  meformin  arms  (5/658; 
0.8%). 
The  overall  incidence  of  pancreas-related  TEAEs  was  higher  in  the  detemir+lira  group  (11.0%)  when 
compared the randomised and non-randomised liraglutide + metformin groups (7.5% and 5.4%). The 
increased incidence was mainly related to increases in blood lipase. 
Thyroid  related  AEs  were  comparable  across  treatment  groups  and  was  overall  comparable  to  the 
frequency  observed  in  the  original  MAA  for  Liraglutide.  The  most  frequently  reported  thyroid  related 
adverse  event  in  all  treatment  groups  was  increased  calcitonin,  which  was  reported  by  single  or  few 
subjects in each treatment group. 
Liraglutide  and  insulin  detemir  antibodies  were  observed,  however,  the  duration  of  the  study  seems 
too short to determine the relevance of the observed antibodies for long term efficacy and safety. 
Based on the original dossier cardiac events represent a possible concern for liraglutide and is included 
in the RMP for liraglutide as a potential risk. In addition, long-term follow up data on cardiac safety is 
being  collected  in  the  5  year  cardiovascular  outcome  study.  Study  NN2211-1842  did  not  show 
increased cardiac safety issues in the liraglutide + insulin detemir + metformin group compared to the 
liarglutide control group.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
In  clinical  study  NN2211-1842,  the  addition  of  insulin  to  patients  insufficiently  controlled  with 
metformin and liraglutide demonstrated a favourable, clinically relevant effect on blood glucose control 
in  terms  of  HbA1c  reduction,  including  an  increased  proportion  of  patients  achieving  the  clinically 
relevant goal of HbA1c < 7%. This is supported by the effect on FPG, and post-prandial glucose levels 
seen during the study. No unexpected effects occurred; an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia was 
observed, but not unexpectedly high and low in severity. 
However, this study raised some major issues. 
Firstly, this study design only gives information about the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir when 
added to metformin + liraglutide and not about the efficacy and safety of liraglutide added to insulin. 
Triple therapy might have an advantage over combination treatment with metformin and insulin alone 
in terms of lower insulin dosage, fewer hypoglycaemic episodes and less weight gain, while achieving 
the same level of glucose control. However, this was not studied in this trial and currently, literature to 
address  this  possible  advantage  is  lacking.  Thus,  the  combination  cannot  be  accepted  as  a  separate 
indication. However, information on the addition of insulin to liraglutide is considered relevant for daily 
practice and therefore information on this combination has been added in the relevant sections of the 
SmPC. 
The  excess  incidence  of  malignant  neoplasms  in  the  triple  combination  arm  (insulin  detemir  + 
liraglutide  +  metformin)  is  a  major  safety  concern.  Despite  the  fact  that  the  neoplasms  represent 
different  locations  and  types/histology,  a  general  tumour  promoting  effect  cannot  be  excluded.  The 
MAH  addressed  this  issue  by  providing  non-clinical  and  clinical  information,  by  conducting  further 
statistical  analyses  and  by  providing  narratives  of  all  neoplasm  cases.  The  majority  of  the  malignant 
cases  seem  confounded  by  strong  risk  factors  and  contributing  factors  for  cancer.  None  of  the 
conducted post-hoc statistical analyses supported the concern regarding a growth promoting effect of 
the triple combination treatment. Based on the non-clinical data, the weight of evidence for an additive 
or  synergic  tumour  promotion  due  to  combination  treatments  with  metformin,  insulin  detemir  and 
liraglutide  is  currently  considered  sparse  and  inconclusive.  Regarding  the  clinical  data,  the  MAH 
referred to the well-known association of type 2 diabetes and obesity with certain types of cancer. With 
respect  to  the  association  between  insulin,  in  particular  insulin  glargin  (Lantus)  and  cancer,  the 
currently available data are controversial and further data from the ongoing observational studies are 
awaited. In summary, final conclusions on a potential increased risk of cancer with the combination of 
insulin  detemir  and  liraglutide  cannot  be  drawn  from  study  NN2211-1842.  This  issue  is addressed  by 
the  MAH  in  the  RMP.  Further  data  will  be  obtained  both  from  observational  data  and  data  from  the 
liraglutide randomised clinical CV outcome study. 
Pancreatitis  related  events  were  reported,  but  the  incidence  was  very  low,  allowing  no  conclusions. 
None  of  the  2  cases  of  pancreatitis  occurred  in  the  triple  therapy  group,  but  the  overall  incidence  of 
pancreas-related  TEAEs  was  higher  in  this  group.  The  increased  incidence  was  mainly  related  to 
increases in blood lipase. This was the first trial with regular lipase and amylase measurements. It is 
acknowledged  that  although  serum  lipase  and  amylase  elevations  may  be  diagnostic  of  pancreatitis 
(levels usually above three times the UNL) the prevalence in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is 
not well characterised. Already at run-in, patients had relatively high lipase levels and these levels did 
not  seem  to  increase  over  time  in  any  of  the  treatment  groups.  Most  importantly,  in  study  NN2211-
1842  elevated  serum  lipase  was  not  associated  with  increases  in  amylase  or  the  observed  events  of 
pancreatitis. A placebo arm would have been necessary in order to get a clearer picture on the clinical 
relevance of increases of lipase levels. 
Thyroid  related  AEs  were  comparable  across  treatment  groups  and  was  overall  comparable  to  the 
frequency  observed  in  the  original  MAA  for  Liraglutide.  The  most  frequently  reported  thyroid  related 
Assessment report

adverse  event  in  all  treatment  groups  was  increased  calcitonin,  which  was  reported  by  single  or  few 
subjects in each treatment group. 
Liraglutide  and  insulin  detemir  antibodies  were  observed,  however,  the  duration  of  the  study  seems 
too short to determine the relevance of the observed antibodies for long term efficacy and safety. 
Altogether,  combination  therapy  of  metformin  +  liraglutide  +  basal  insulin  might  be  useful  in  a 
selective patient population for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2.  
Conclusions on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The indication for the combination of liraglutide + metformin with basal insulin has not been accepted 
by  the  CHMP  as  information  on  the  addition  of  liraglutide  to  insulin  detemir  +  metformin  is  lacking. 
However,  information  on  the  addition  of  insulin  detemir  to  liraglutide  is  considered  relevant  for  daily 
practice  and  therefore  information  on  this  combination  in  the  SmPC  is  considered  acceptable  in  the 
relevant sections.

Extension of indication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in combination with basal insulin in 
patients not achieving adequate glycaemic control with Victoza and metformin alone: update to 
sections 4.1, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and consequential changes to sections 1 and 2 of the 
Package Leaflet

MAH has taken the opportunity to align the Annexes with version 7.3.1 of the QRD template and 
to  delete  the  DDPS  version  number  from  Annex  IIB.  Minor  editorial  changes  have  been  made 
throughout  the  Annexes.  Finally  in  section  6  of  the  Package  Leaflet,  the  pictures  for  the 
instructions of using Victoza have been changed so that the fingers in the pictures are now white 
instead of yellow. 
Due to the major objections raised by the CHMP on the design of study NN2211-1842, the MAH did not 
pursue  anymore  an  extension  of  indication  for  Victoza  for  the  treatment  of  type  2  diabetes  in 
combination  with  basal  insulin  in  patients  not  achieving  adequate  glycaemic  control  with  Victoza  and 
metformin alone but instead proposed to update the Victoza SmPC with the results of study NN2211-
1842. 
On 22 September 2011 the CHMP considered this group of two type II variations:

1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Fasturtec 1.5 mg/ml powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion. 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Fasturtec is a recombinant urate-oxidase enzyme produced by genetically modified Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae strain. Rasburicase is a tetrameric protein with identical subunits of a molecular mass of 
about 34 kDa. 
After reconstitution, 1 ml of Fasturtec concentrate contains 1.5 mg rasburicase. 
1 mg corresponds to 18.2 EAU*. 
*One enzyme activity unit (EAU) corresponds to the enzyme activity that converts 1 µmol of uric acid 
into allantoin per minute under the operating conditions described: +30 °C ± 1 °C TEA pH 8.9 buffer. 
Excipient(s) with known effect: 
Each 1.5 mg/ml vial contains 0.091 mmol of sodium, which is 2.1 mg of sodium and 7.5 mg/5 ml vial 
contains 0.457 mmol of sodium, which is 10.5 mg of sodium. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for sterile concentrate). 
The powder is an entire or broken white to off white pellet. 
The solvent is a colourless and clear liquid. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1.  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment and prophylaxis of acute hyperuricaemia, in order to prevent acute renal failure, in adults, 
children and adolescents (aged 0 to 17 years) with haematological malignancy with a high tumour 
burden and at risk of a rapid tumour lysis or shrinkage at initiation of chemotherapy. 
4.2.  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Fasturtec is to be used immediately prior to and during the initiation of chemotherapy only, as at the 
present, there is insufficient data to recommend multiple treatment courses. 
The recommended dose for Fasturtec is 0.20 mg/kg/day. Fasturtec is administered as a once daily 
30 minute intravenous infusion in 50 ml of a sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution (see section 
6.6). 
The duration of treatment with Fasturtec may be up to 7 days, the exact duration should be based upon 
adequate monitoring of uric acid levels in plasma and clinical judgment. 
Paediatric population 
As no adjustment is necessary, the recommended dose is 0.20 mg/kg/day. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Renally or hepatically impaired patients: No dose adjustment is necessary. 
Method of Administration 
Fasturtec should be administered under the supervision of a physician trained in chemotherapy of 
haematological malignancies. 
Administration of rasburicase does not require any change in the timing or schedule of initiation of 
cytoreductive chemotherapy. 
Rasburicase solution should be infused over 30 minutes. Rasburicase solution should be infused 
through a different line than that used for infusion of chemotherapeutic agents to prevent any possible 
drug incompatibility. If use of a separate line is not possible, the line should be flushed out with saline 
solution between infusion of chemotherapeutic agents and rasburicase. For instructions on 
reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
Because rasburicase may degrade uric acid in vitro, special precautions must be used during sample 
handling for plasma uric acid measurements, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
G6PD deficiency and other cellular metabolic disorders known to cause haemolytic anaemia. 
Hydrogen peroxide is a by-product of the conversion of uric acid to allantoin. In order to prevent 
possible haemolytic anaemia induced by hydrogen peroxide, rasburicase is contraindicated in patients 
with these disorders. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Rasburicase like other proteins, has the potential to induce allergic responses in humans, such as 
anaphylaxis, including anaphylactic shock, with potential fatal outcome. Clinical experience with 
Fasturtec demonstrates that patients should be closely monitored for the onset of allergic-type 
undesirable effects, especially severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis (see section 
4.8). In case of severe allergic reaction, treatment should immediately and permanently be 
discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated. 
Caution should be used in patients with a history of atopic allergies. 
At present, there is insufficient data available on patients being retreated to recommend multiple 
treatment courses. Anti-rasburicase antibodies have been detected in treated patients and healthy 
volunteers administered rasburicase. 
Methaemoglobinaemia has been reported in patients receiving Fasturtec. Fasturtec should immediately 
and permanently be discontinued in patients having developed methaemoglobinaemia, and appropriate 
measures initiated (see section 4.8). 
Haemolysis has been reported in patients receiving Fasturtec. In such case, treatment should 
immediately and permanently be discontinued and appropriate measures initiated (see section 4.8). 
Administration of Fasturtec reduces the uric acid levels to below normal levels and by this mechanism 
reduces the chance of development of renal failure due to precipitation of uric acid crystals in renal 
tubules as a consequence of hyperuricaemia. Tumour lysis can also result in hyperphosphataemia, 
hyperkalaemia and hypocalcaemia. Fasturtec is not directly effective in the treatment of these 
abnormalities. Therefore, patients must be monitored closely. 
Fasturtec has not been investigated in the patients with hyperuricemia in the context of 
myeloproliferative disorders. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To ensure accurate measurement of uric acid plasma level during treatment with Fasturtec, a strict 
sample handling procedure must be followed (see section 6.6). 
This medicinal product contains up to 10.5 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.53 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. Rasburicase being an enzyme itself, it would be an 
unlikely candidate for drug-drug interactions. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of rasburicase in pregnant women. Results from animal studies could 
not be interpreted due to the presence of endogenous urate oxidase in standard animal models. 
Because teratogenic effects of rasburicase cannot be ruled out, Fasturtec should only be used during 
pregnancy if strictly necessary.  Fasturtec is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not 
using contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether rasburicase is excreted in human milk. As a protein the dose for the infant is 
expected to be very low. During treatment with Fasturtec, the advantage of breastfeeding should be 
weighted against the potential risk for the infant. 
Fertility 
There are no data regarding the effect of rasburicase on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Fasturtec is concomitantly administered as supportive care to cytoreductive chemotherapy of advanced 
malignancies, the causality of adverse events is therefore difficult to assess due to the significant 
burden of adverse events expected from the underlying disease and its treatment. 
 The most commonly reported adverse reactions were nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, and 
diarrhoea. 
In clinical trials, haematological disorders such as haemolysis, haemolytic anaemia and 
methaemoglobinaemia are uncommonly caused by Fasturtec. The enzymatic digestion of uric acid to 
allantoin by rasburicase produces hydrogen peroxide and haemolytic anaemia or 
methaemoglobinaemia have been observed in certain at risk populations such as those with G6PD 
deficiency. 
Adverse reactions possibly attributable to Fasturtec and reported in the clinical trials, are listed below, 
by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined using the following MedDRA 
convention as: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), 
rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the

Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In view of the mechanism of action of Fasturtec, an overdose will lead to low or undetectable plasma 
uric acid concentrations and increased production of hydrogen peroxide. Thus patients suspected of 
receiving an overdose should be monitored for haemolysis, and general supportive measures should be 
initiated as no specific antidote for Fasturtec has been identified.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Detoxifying agents for antineoplastic treatment, ATC code: V03AF07. 
Mechanism of action 
In humans, uric acid is the final step in the catabolic pathway of purines. The acute increase in plasma 
levels of uric acid subsequent to the lysis of large numbers of malignant cells and during cytoreductive 
chemotherapy may lead to impairment of renal function and renal failure resulting from the 
precipitation of crystals of uric acid in renal tubules. Rasburicase is a highly potent uricolytic agent 
that catalyses enzymatic oxidation of uric acid into allantoin, a water soluble product, easily excreted 
by the kidneys in the urine. 
The enzymatic oxidation of uric acid leads to stoichiometric formation of hydrogen peroxide. The 
increased of hydrogen peroxide over ambient levels can be eliminated by endogenous antioxidants and 
the only increased risk is for haemolysis in G6PD deficient and inherited anaemia patients. 
In healthy volunteers, a marked dose-related decrease in plasma uric acid levels was observed across 
the dose range 0.05 mg/kg to 0.20 mg/kg of Fasturtec. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In a randomised comparative phase III study, performed in 52 paediatric patients, 27 patients were 
treated with rasburicase at the recommended dose of 0.20 mg/kg/day, intravenously, for 4 to 7 days 
(< 5 years: n=11; 6-12 years: n=11; 13-17 years: n=5), and 25 patients with allopurinol daily oral 
doses for 4 to 8 days. Results showed a significantly more rapid onset of action of Fasturtec in 
comparison with allopurinol. At 4 hours post first dose, there was a significant difference in the mean 
percentage change from baseline plasma uric acid concentration (p <0.0001) in the Fasturtec group (-
86.0%) compared to that for the allopurinol group (-12.1%). 
Time to first confirmation of normal levels of uric acid in hyperuricaemic patients is four hours for 
Fasturtec and 24 hours for allopurinol. In addition this rapid control of uric acid in this population is 
accompanied by improvements in renal function. In turn, this allows efficient excretion of the serum 
phosphate load preventing further deterioration of renal function from calcium/phosphorus 
precipitation. 
In a randomized (1:1:1), multi-center, open-label study, 275 adult patients with leukemia and 
lymphoma at risk for hyperuricemia and tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) were treated with either 
rasburicase at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day, intravenously, for 5 days (arm A: n=92), rasburicase at a dose 
of 0.2 mg/kg/day, intravenously, from day 1 through day 3 followed by oral allopurinol at a dose of 
300 mg once a day from day 3 through day 5 (overlap on day 3: rasburicase and allopurinol 
administered approximately 12 hours apart) (arm B: n=92), or oral allopurinol at a dose of 300 mg 
once a day for 5 days (arm C: n=91). The uric acid response rate (proportion of patients with plasma 
uric acid levels ≤7.5 mg/dl from day 3 to day 7 after initiation of antihyperuricemic treatment) was 
87% in arm A, 78% in arm B, and 66% in arm C. The response rate in arm A was significantly greater 
than in arm C (p=0.0009); the response rate was higher for arm B compared to arm C although this 
difference was not statistically significant. Uric acid levels were <2 mg/dl in 96% of patients in the 
two arms containing rasburicase and 5% of patients in the allopurinol arm at 4 hours of the day 1 dose. 
The safety results of patients treated with Fasturtec in Study EFC4978 were consistent with the 
adverse events profile observed in previous clinical studies with predominantly paediatric patients. 
In pivotal clinical studies, 246 paediatric patients ( mean age 7 years, range 0 to17) were treated with 
rasburicase at doses of 0.15 mg/kg/day or 0.20 mg/kg/day for 1 to 8 days (mainly 5 to 7 days). 
Efficacy results on 229 evaluable patients showed an overall response rate (normalization of plasma 
uric acid levels) of 96.1%. Safety results on 246 patients were consistent with the adverse events 
profile in the overall population. 
In long term safety studies, an analysis of data from 867 paediatric patients (mean age 7.3 years, range 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0 to17) treated with rasburicase at 0.20 mg/kg/day for 1 to 24 days (mainly 1 to 4 days) showed 
consistent findings with pivotal clinical studies in terms of efficacy and safety. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of rasburicase were evaluated in both paediatric and adult patients with 
leukaemia, lymphoma or other haematological malignancies.  
Absorption 
After infusion of rasburicase at a dose of 0.20 mg/kg/day, steady state is achieved at day 2 - 3. 
Minimal accumulation of rasburicase (<1.3 fold) was observed between days 1 and 5 of dosing. 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution ranged from 110 - 127 ml/kg in paediatric patients and from 75.8 to 
138 ml/kg in adult patients, respectively, which is comparable to the physiological vascular volume. 
Metabolism 
Rasburicase is a protein, and therefore: 1) not expected to bind to proteins, 2) expected that metabolic 
degradation will follow the pathways of other proteins, i.e. peptide hydrolysis, 3) unlikely to be 
candidate for drug-drug interactions.  
Elimination  
Clearance of rasburicase was ca. 3.5 ml/h/kg. The mean terminal half-life was similar between 
paediatric and adult patients and ranged from 15.7 to 22.5 hours. Clearance is increased (ca. 35%) in 
children and adolescents compared to adults, resulting in a lower systemic exposure. Renal elimination 
of rasburicase is considered to be a minor pathway for rasburicase clearance. 
Special patient populations  
In adults (≥ the age of 18 years), age, gender, baseline liver enzymes and creatinine clearance did not 
impact the pharmacokinetics of rasburicase. A cross-study comparison revealed that after 
administration of rasburicase at 0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg, the geometric mean values of body-weight 
normalized clearance were approximately 40% lower in Japanese (n=20) than that in Caucasians 
(n=26).  
As metabolism is expected to occur by peptide hydrolysis, an impaired liver function is not expected 
to affect the pharmacokinetics. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. The interpretation of the non-clinical studies is 
hampered due to the presence of endogenous urate oxidase in standard animal models.

Incompatibilities 
This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in 
section 6.6. 
Rasburicase solution should be infused through a different line than that used for infusion of 
chemotherapeutic agents to prevent any possible drug incompatibility. If use of a separate line is not 
possible, the line should be flushed out with saline solution between chemotherapeutic agent infusions 
and rasburicase. 
No filter should be used for infusion. 
Do not use any glucose solution for dilution due to potential incompatibility. 
6.3  Shelf life 
3 years. 
After reconstitution or dilution an immediate use is recommended. However, the in-use stability has 
been demonstrated for 24 hours between +2°C and 8°C. 
6.4  Special precautions for storage 
Powder in vial: store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). 
Do not freeze. 
Store in the original package in order to protect from light. 
For storage conditions after reconstitution or dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container 
Fasturtec is supplied as a pack of: 
3 vials of 1.5 mg rasburicase and 3 ampoules of 1 ml solvent. The powder is supplied in 2 ml or 3 ml 
clear glass (type I) vial with a rubber stopper and the solvent in a 2 ml clear glass (type I) ampoule. 
1 vial of 7.5 mg rasburicase and 1 ampoule of 5 ml solvent. The powder is supplied in 10 ml clear 
glass (type I) vial with a rubber stopper and the solvent in a 5 ml clear glass (type I) ampoule. 
Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Rasburicase must be reconstituted with the entire volume of the supplied solvent ampoule (1.5 mg 
rasburicase vial to be reconstituted with the 1 ml solvent ampoule; 7.5 mg rasburicase vial to be 
reconstituted with the 5 ml solvent ampoule). Reconstitution results in a solution with a concentration 
of 1.5 mg/ml rasburicase to be further diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) intravenous 
solution. 
Reconstitution of the solution: 
Add the content of one ampoule of solvent to one vial containing rasburicase and mix by swirling very 
gently under controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
Do not shake. 
Inspect visually prior to use. Only clear and colourless solutions without particles should be used. 
For single-use only, any unused solution should be discarded. 
The solvent contains no preservative. Therefore the reconstituted solution should be diluted under 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
Dilution before infusion: 
The required volume of the reconstituted solution depends on the patient's body weight. The use of 
several vials may be necessary to obtain the quantity of rasburicase required for one administration. 
The required volume of the reconstituted solution, taken from one or more vials, is to be further 
diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution to make a total volume of 50 ml. The 
concentration of rasburicase in the final solution for infusion depends on the patient's body weight. 
The reconstituted solution contains no preservative. Therefore the diluted solution should be infused 
immediately. 
Infusion: 
The final solution should be infused over 30 minutes. 
Sample handling: 
If it is necessary to monitor a patient’s uric acid level, a strict sample-handling procedure must be 
followed to minimise ex vivo degradation of the analyte. Blood must be collected into pre-chilled tubes 
containing heparin anticoagulant. Samples must be immersed in an ice/water bath. Plasma samples 
should immediately be prepared by centrifugation in a pre-cooled centrifuge (4°C). Finally, plasma 
must be maintained in an ice/water bath and analysed for uric acid within 4 hours.

rasburicase 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains 
important information for you. 
-  Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
-

2.  What you need to know before you are given Fasturtec 
3.  How to use Fasturtec 
4.  Possible side effects  
5.  How to store Fasturtec 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Fasturtec is and what it is used for  
Fasturtec contains the active ingredient rasburicase. 
Rasburicase is used to treat or prevent high blood levels of uric acid from occurring in adults, children 
and adolescents (aged 0 to 17 years) with disorders of the blood cells (haematological diseases) who 
are about to receive or are receiving chemotherapy treatment.  
When chemotherapy is given, cancer cells are destroyed, releasing large amounts of uric acid into the 
bloodstream.  
Fasturtec works by allowing uric acid to more easily be removed from the body by the kidneys.  
2.  What you need to know before you are given Fasturtec 
Do not use Fasturtec if you: 
- 
are allergic (hypersensitive) to rasburicase, other uricases or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
have a history of haemolytic anaemia (an illness caused by red blood cells being abnormally 
broken down).  
- 
Warning and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, nurse or hospital pharmacist if you have a history of any kind of allergy. 
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any allergic type reactions due to other medicines; Fasturtec can 
cause allergic-type reactions, such as severe anaphylaxis including anaphylactic shock (sudden life-
threatening or fatal allergic reactions).  
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following as you may need to stop treatment: 
swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat 
coughing or wheezing 
• 
• 
•  difficulty in breathing or swallowing 
• 
rash, itching or hives (nettle-type rash) on the skin 
These may be the first signs that a severe allergic reaction is happening. Your treatment with 
Fasturtec may need to be stopped, and you may need further treatment. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is not known whether the chance of developing an allergic reaction is increased if treatment with 
Fasturtec is repeated. 
In case of disorders of the blood in which red blood cells are abnormally broken down (haemolysis) or 
abnormal blood pigment levels (methaemoglobinaemia), your doctor will immediately and 
permanently discontinue treatment with Fasturtec. 
Other medicines and Fasturtec  
Please tell your doctor if you are taking, or have recently taken, any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
Tell your doctor if you are, or think you may be pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
No information on the ability to drive and use machines is available. 
Fasturtec contains sodium 
This medicine contains up to 10.5 mg sodium, (main component of cooking/table salt) per vial. This is 
equivalent to 0.53% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
3. 
How to use Fasturtec  
Fasturtec is to be given to you before or during the start of your course of chemotherapy. 
Fasturtec is injected slowly into a vein, which should take about 30 minutes. 
Your dose will be calculated according to your body weight.  
The recommended dose is 0.20 mg per kg of body weight per day in both children and adults. 
It will be given once a day, for up to 7 days.  
During treatment with Fasturtec, your doctor will carry out blood tests to check the levels of uric acid 
and decide how long you will be treated for.  
Your doctor may also test your blood to make sure that you do not develop any blood disorders. 
If you are given more Fasturtec than you should be 
If it does occur, the doctor will closely monitor the effects on your red blood cells and treat any 
symptoms that follow. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or hospital 
pharmacist.

Other sources of information 
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu  
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:  
See section 3 “How to use Fasturtec” and practical information on preparation and handling given 
below.  
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fasturtec must be reconstituted with the entire volume of the supplied solvent (e.g. 1.5 mg rasburicase 
vial to be reconstituted with the 1 ml solvent ampoule; 7.5 mg rasburicase vial to be reconstituted with 
the 5 ml solvent ampoule). Reconstitution results in a solution with a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml to be 
further diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%). 
Reconstitution of the solution:  
Add the content of one ampoule of solvent to one vial containing rasburicase and mix by swirling very 
gently under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.  
Do not shake.  
Inspect visually prior to use. Only clear and colourless solutions without particles should be used. 
For single-use only, any unused solution should be discarded. 
The solvent contains no preservative. Therefore the reconstituted solution should be diluted under 
controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
Dilution before infusion: 
The required volume of the reconstituted solution depends on the patient's body weight. The use of 
several vials may be necessary to obtain the quantity of rasburicase required for one administration. 
The required volume of the reconstituted solution, taken from one or more vials, is to be further 
diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution to make a total volume of 50 ml. The 
concentration of rasburicase in the final solution for infusion depends on the patient's body weight.  
The reconstituted solution contains no preservative. Therefore the diluted solution should be infused 
immediately. 
Infusion: 
The final solution should be infused over 30 minutes. 
Sample handling: 
If it is necessary to monitor a patient’s uric acid level, a strict sample-handling procedure must be 
followed to minimise ex vivo degradation of the analyte. Blood must be collected into pre-chilled tubes 
containing heparin anticoagulant. Samples must be immersed in an ice/water bath. Plasma samples 
should immediately be prepared by centrifugation in a pre-cooled centrifuge (4°C). Finally, plasma 
must be maintained in an ice/water bath and analysed for uric acid within 4 hours.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
On June 5, 1981, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, published by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC), described Pneumocystis carinii (now P. jiroveci) pneumonia in 5 homosexual men 
in Los Angeles, California, USA, documenting for the first time what became known as acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). These reports were sentinels for what became one of history’s worst 
pandemics, with >60 million infections, 30 million deaths, and no end in sight. 
In 1983, HIV was discovered, an accomplishment for which French scientists received the Nobel Prize for 
Medicine in 2008. In 1985, a serologic test for HIV became commercially available. HIV type 1, group M 
(HIV-1), the predominant cause of the AIDS epidemic, evolved from a virus that crossed the species 
barrier from chimpanzees to humans. The earliest retrospective diagnosis of HIV-1 infection was made 
from a serum specimen collected in 1959 in Kinshasa, capital of what is now the Democratic Republic of 
Congo. Two additional but rare groups of HIV-1 (N and O) cause related zoonotic infections that are 
essentially restricted to central Africa. HIV-2, a second type of HIV rarely found outside western Africa, 
originated in sooty mangabeys. Although the epidemic appears to have begun in central Africa, HIV 
prevalence is now highest in southern Africa; the Republic of South Africa alone is home to about one 
sixth of the world’s HIV-infected persons. The reasons for this geographic distribution are not entirely 
clear, but biological factors, such as lack of male circumcision and rates of other genital (especially 
ulcerative) infections that facilitate HIV transmission, and social factors (some of which may have been 
influenced by the end of apartheid), such as frequent partner change and concurrent sexual partnerships, 
migration, and commercial sex, likely play a role. 
Tenofovir disoproxil is a first in class of nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Scientific 
advances resulted in the development of lifesaving, albeit not curative, treatment for HIV. Beginning with 
the approval of azidothymidine or zidovudine in 1987, the development of antiretroviral drugs and the 
design of simple and standardized approaches for therapy in the developing world constituted a public 
health triumph. By the end of 2009, >5 million persons in low- and middle-income countries were 
accessing ART, unimaginable just a few years before and made possible through the use of generic drugs,

price reductions for brand-name drugs, and efforts of international donors through initiatives such as the 
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global Fund. 
The current treatment guidelines recommend two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in 
combination with either a protease inhibitor (preferably boosted with ritonavir), a non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, or a CCR5 antagonist for initial 
antiretroviral therapy in treatment-naive, HIV-infected adults and adolescents include. The combination of 
tenofovir and FTC (or lamivudine) is the preferred dual-NRTI option in treatment-naive, HIV-infected 
adults and adolescents, particularly for patients co-infected with both HIV and hepatitis B virus as these 
agents are active against both viruses [EACS 2014; Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and 
Adolescents 2015]. 
The combination of tenofovir and FTC (or lamivudine) is the preferred dual-NRTI option in treatment-
naive, HIV-infected adults and Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil (Phosphate) 200/245 mg Film Coated 
tablet has been submitted under Article 10(1) (generic of a reference medicinal product) of Directive 
2001/83/EC as amended. 
The proposed indication was : Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is a fixed dose combination of 
emtricitabine and Tenofovir disoproxil. It is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the 
treatment of HIV-1 infected adults aged 18 years and over. The demonstration of the benefit of the 
combination emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil in antiretroviral therapy is based solely on studies 
performed in treatment-naïve patients. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development work was to develop a stable formulation of 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil containing 200/245 mg of drug substances, which would be 
pharmaceutically equivalent to the innovator product Truvada 200mg/245mg Film-Coated Tablets. 
The recommended dose of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is one tablet, taken orally, once 
daily. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is presented as film coated tablet containing a fixed-dose 
combination of 200 mg of emtricitabine and 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (equivalent to 291.5 mg of

2.2.2.  Active substance 
Emtricitabine 
General information 
The chemical name of emtricitabine is 4-amino-5-fluoro-1-[(2R,5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-5-
yl]-2(1H)-pyrimidinone corresponding to the molecular formula C8H10FN3O3S. It has a relative molecular 
mass of 247.25 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1.  Structure of emtricitabine. 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, 
elemental analysis, UV spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and specific optical rotation 
methods. 
Emtricitabine appears as a white to off-white non-hygroscopic crystalline powder, sparingly soluble in 
water and in methanol. Its pKa was found to be 4.73 and the partition coefficient log P -0.40. It has 2 
chiral centres at carbons 2 and 5 of the oxathiolane ring. 
There are four possible isomers due to these asymmetric carbons in the molecule and the isomer 2R,5S is 
commercially produced. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC and specific optical 
rotation.  
Emtricitabine  exhibits  polymorphism.  The  same  crystalline form-I  is  consistently  manufactured,  which  is 
characterised and controlled by XRD method during the manufacture and at release. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance (AS) has been provided in the 
restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Emtricitabine is synthesized in four main chemical steps followed by purification drying, milling, sifting 
and packing. The starting material is well-defined with acceptable specifications. The first two steps of the 
synthesis leading to the key intermediate are performed by two manufacturers using slightly different 
solvents in the chemical reactions. 
One manufacturer of the above is responsible for the production of the final active substance from the 
key intermediate. The starting materials were re-defined during the procedure in order to ensure that the 
incorporation of structural elements and stereochemistry is documented in the dossier and is carried out 
under GMP requirements, resulting in the addition of a second manufacturer. The key intermediate, 
solvents and reagents are described and are controlled by appropriate specifications. A satisfactory brief 
description of the micronisation step has also been provided.

                                                                                  Page 10/28  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The characterisation of the active 
substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active 
substances. Potential and actual impurities including genotoxic impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised.  
Emtricitabine is packed in two layers of LDPE bags placed in an HDPE drum. The polythene bags used as 
primary  packaging  material  are  food grade  and  comply  with  the  requirements  of  Ph.  Eur.  and  European 
Directive 10/2011 as amended. The specification of the LDPE bag as well as CoAs were presented.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for appearance (visual), solubility 
(visual), identity (IR, HPLC), polymorphism (XRD), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. 
Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals, chloride content (potentiometry), related substances (TLC, 
HPLC), enatiomeric purity (HPLC), assay (HPLC) and residual solvents (GC). 
The potential impurities and possible genotoxic impurities which are possible from the re-defined starting 
material are controlled in the final AS by validated test methods and the results from three commercial 
scale emtricitabine batches are summarised. As the results are either below detection limit or not 
detected, it has been demonstrated that the impurities are generally adequately controlled during 
manufacturing of the AS. Based on the data provided, the fate and carry-over of above impurities has 
been sufficiently demonstrated. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from three production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on four production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers 
stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 60 months under long term conditions 
(25 °C ± 2 °C / 60 %RH ± 5% RH) was provided. Three of the above batches were stored for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40 °C ± 2 °C /75 %RH ± 5% RH) according to the ICH guidelines.  
Samples  were  tested  for  the  parameters  included  in  the  release  specification.  The  analytical  methods 
used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were observed under either storage condition 
and all remained within specification. Based on the presented data a change of polymorphic form during 
the proposed retest period is considered highly unlikely. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one commercial scale batch. The 
results showed that the AS is not sensitive to light. 
Stress testing (thermal, light, hydrolysis, acidic, basic, oxidative and reductive conditions) was also 
performed on one commercial scale batch. Samples were tested for description, identification, specific 
optical rotation, loss on drying, assay and related substances. The degradation pathways  and the 
stability indicating power of the assay and related substance methods have been demonstrated.  
The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months in the proposed container.

The chemical name of tenofovir disoproxil phosphate is 9-((R)-2-bis(((isopropoxycarbonyl)oxy) 
methoxy)phosphinyl)-methoxy)propyl)adenine phosphate corresponding to the molecular formula 
C19H30N5O10P.H3PO4 and has a relative molecular mass of 617.44 g/mol. It has the structure shown in 
figure 3: 
Figure 2.  Structure of tenofovir disoproxil phosphate. 
The active substance is a white to off-white crystalline powder, slightly hygroscopic and slightly soluble in 
aqueous media across the physiological pH range. A single polymorphic form has been observed which is 
routinely produced by the manufacturing process. There is one chiral centre which originates in one of the 
starting materials and is controlled in the active substance by chiral HPLC. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Tenofovir disoproxil phosphate is synthesized in five main steps using well-defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. One manufacturer is responsible for the production of an intermediate which is 
then converted to the active substance by a second manufacturer. The starting materials were re-defined 
during the procedure in order to ensure that enough of the process is documented in the dossier and 
carried out under GMP, resulting in addition of the second manufacturer. The single chiral centre is 
controlled in one of the starting materials and carries through unaltered to the active substance. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. Potential and actual impurities were well 
discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. A thorough assessment of potential mutagenic 
impurities was carried out and adequate controls have been put in place. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The 
characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
The active substance is packaged in double LDPE bags inside a drum. The materials comply with the EC 
directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended.

Specification 
The active substance specification re-produced in table 2 includes tests for appearance, identity (IR), 
assay (HPLC), phosphoric acid assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC), 
residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), heavy metals (ICP-AES), and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
The mono-POC PMPA impurity present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A is a 
known metabolite and thus qualified. Other impurities are adequately controlled by the specifications. 
There are no controls for polymorphic form as only one crystalline form is known.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from three production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 12 months under long term conditions (5±3 °C) and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25 °C / 60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. Samples were tested for appearance, impurities, enantiomeric purity, water content and assay. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. No significant 
changes to any of the measured parameters were observed under either storage condition and all 
remained within specification. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B and stress testing (high temperature, elevated 
humidity, acidic, basic and oxidising aqueous media) was performed on one batch. The active substance 
is not photosensitive but is sensitive to heat and extremely sensitive to heat and moisture. It degrades, 
mainly via hydrolysis, under all the aqueous conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months at 5±3 °C in the 
proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as blue, oval biconvex film coated immediate release tablets, intended 
for oral administration. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development work was to develop a stable formulation containing 200 mg 
of emtricitabine and 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil which would be bioequivalent to the innovator product 
Truvada 200mg / 245mg film-coated tablets.  
At the beginning of development, dry granulation was favoured over wet granulation since this technique 
requires relatively low amounts of excipients and consequently more advantageous in terms of reduction 
of the size of the tablet. It was also favoured because it avoids exposure of the active substances to heat 
and moisture, important since tenofovir disoproxil is susceptible to hydrolysis in the presence of moisture. 
Roller  compaction  was  used  as  dry  granulation  method  for  the  manufacturing  process.  Different 
manufacturing parameters were tested in combination with different excipients and ratios throughout the 
development  of  the  manufacturing  process.  The  manufacturing  process  follows  a  conventional  approach 
for solid dosage forms, employing widely used, non-specialised manufacturing equipment. As a result of

                                                                                  Page 13/28  
 
  
  
 
 
the  selected  process,  the  qualitative  composition  of  the  generic  product  is  different  from  the  reference 
product. The selected final composition was superior to the others based on the physical properties of the 
tablets, and the flow and compression properties of the final blends. All the excipients used in the finished 
product are of pharmacopoeial quality and are commonly used for this type of medicinal product. Based 
on  the  presented  information,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  disoproxil  phosphate  do  not  show  any 
incompatibility  either  with  the  excipients  used  in  the  formulation  or  with  each  other,  which  was  also 
confirmed during the formal stability studies. 
The coating material was selected as Opadry II Blue 85F30675 which is a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based 
solid preparation for tablet coating. Dissolution profile studies were performed with core and film coated 
tablets.  It  was  proven  that  the  coating  materials  have  no  effect  on  the  dissolution  behaviour  of  the 
samples. A number of different formulations were investigated in this study.  
The reference medicinal product contains tenofovir disoproxil as a fumarate salt, however, the phosphate 
salt  of  tenofovir  disoproxil  is  used  in  the  Zentiva  generic  formulation.  Based  on  literature  information, 
emtricitabine is a class I (high solubility, high permeability) substance and tenofovir disoproxil phosphate 
is a class III (high solubility, low permeability) substance according to the Biophamaceutics Classification 
system  (BCS).  The  impurity  profiles  of  Emtricitabine/Tenofovir  disoproxil  (phosphate)  Zentiva  200/245 
mg film-coated tablets and Truvada 200 mg/245 mg film-coated tablets were determined using an HPLC 
method. The impurity profiles can be considered essentially similar based on the submitted results. 
The  bioequivalence  of  the  generic  to  the  reference  was  demonstrated  by  bioequivalence  study  ETI-P4-
464. Comparison of dissolution profiles of four batches of the test product (including the two biobatches) 
and four batches of the reference showed that release of both substances was more than 85 % within 15 
minutes in all tested media.  
For the QC dissolution method, sink conditions were obtained in all media that were investigated for both 
substances.  However,  a  coning  effect  was  observed  visually  and  the  release  of  the  two  ASs  was 
incomplete  with  the  initially  was  selected  paddle  conditions.  It  was  therefore  decided  to  switch  to 
apparatus  1  (basket)  and  set  the  rotational  speed  at  75  rpm.  Obtained  results  were  satisfactory  after 
executing  the  dissolution  tests  in  four  different  media  under  these  conditions.  Since  the  dissolution 
profiles in all media are similar, the release medium was selected as 0.1N HCl. 
The primary packaging of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil 200/245 mg film coated tablets was selected 
as  HDPE  bottles  with  child  resistant  polypropylene  (PP)  screw  caps  with  induction  heat  sealing  (with 
aluminium foil). 3 grams of silica gel (in a HDPE canister) is added to each bottle as desiccant to reduce 
adventitious  headspace  moisture.  The  provided  stability  results  indicate  that  the  proposed  packaging 
materials  are  suitable  for  the  storage  of  the  finished  product.  The  primary  packaging  material  complies 
with EU-Regulations No.10/2011 and No.1935/2004/EC. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process can be considered as a standard process which comprises the following main 
steps:  a)  preparation  of  the  blend  ready  for  compression  (sieving,  mixing,  dry  granulation  (roller 
compaction)  /  milling,  blending,  lubricating  (final  blending);  b)  compression  of  tablets;  c)  coating  of 
tablets; d) packaging.  
Based  on  the  submitted  risk  assessment  study  to  demonstrate  control  and  understanding  of  the 
manufacturing procedure, no critical steps in the manufacturing process of the finished product have been 
identified.  The  proposed  IPCs  have  been  presented  and  are  adequately  justified.  The  control  strategy 
ensures that the manufacturing process consistently delivers a product that meets the defined criteria for 
all release specifications.

The batch sizes intended for commercial use have been clearly stated. The process has been validated on 
three batches at the minimum commercial batch size and the validation report was presented. The 
process will be further validated on the first 3 production scale batches of each proposed batch size. 
In conclusion, it is considered that the manufacturing process is sufficiently robust to provide assurance 
that film-coated tablets of consistent quality, complying with the designated specification, are produced. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
appearance (visual), identification of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil (HPLC, TLC), identification of 
colourant (chemical), identification of phosphate (HPLC), disintegration (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. 
Eur.), average weight (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (mass variation, Ph. Eur. and content 
uniformity, Ph. Eur.), dissolution (HPLC), assay of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil (HPLC), related 
substances (HPLC) and  microbial purity (Ph. Eur.).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods have been 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used in the routine analysis of finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis data three commercial scale batches were presented. All batches are representative of the 
commercial formula and process. All batches meet the commercial specification limits. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches stored under long term conditions for up to 18 months 
(25 °C / 60% RH), for up to 18 months under intermediate conditions (30 °C / 65% RH and 30 °C / 75% 
RH)  and  for  up  to  six  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40  °C  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH 
guidelines  were  provided.  The  stability  batches  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  average  tablet  weight,  water  content,  dissolution,  assay,  related 
substances and microbial purity. The methods used were the same as for release testing and are stability 
indicating.  There  is  no  significant  change  in  any  of  characteristic  of  Emtricitabine/Tenofovir  Disoproxil 
Zentiva 200/245 mg film coated tablets as tested at any time point. No trends were observed. 
One commercial scale batch of the finished product was subjected to in-use stability testing. Based on the 
presented  results,  a  shelf  life  after  first  opening  is  not  warranted.  However,  once  opened  the  product 
should be stored below 30 °C. An in-use study will be performed on a second batch at the end of the long 
term stability period, too. 
A photostability study was carried out on one commercial scale batch of finished product according to ICH 
Q1B Guideline. Light exposure did not result in any significant change. Additional storage restrictions are 
not considered necessary. 
Forced degradation / stress studies were carried out on one commercial scale batch of finished product in 
order  to  demonstrate  the  stability  indicating  nature  of  the  assay  and  related  substances  methods. 
Samples of tenofovir and emtricitabine drug substances and the drug product were tested after exposure 
to  acid,  basic,  oxidative  conditions,  elevated  temperature  and  exposed  to  UV  light.  The  results  of 
degradation studies together with mass balance calculations demonstrate that that the assay and related 
substances methods are stability indicating. 
Based on the provided stability data, the proposed shelf life of 24 months stored in the original package 
in order to protect from moisture, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.

No materials of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of the finished product. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
The applicant should repeat the in-use stability study with a batch of finished product towards the 
end of its shelf life. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
No new non-clinical data have been provided. A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific 
literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of 
the reference product.  
The reference medicinal product contains tenofovir disoproxil as a fumarate salt, however, a phosphate 
salt is used in the generic formulation. Fumarate is a Class 1 product; however it is not considered a 
Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) substance. Phosphate is also a Class 1 product, but is additionally 
considered a GRAS substance. This has been discussed and was considered acceptable. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No full Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil tablets manufactured by Zentiva is considered unlikely 
to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substances. Thus, the 
environmental risk is expected to be similar and not increased.

analysis. No major protocol deviations were reported. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were presented and 
were acceptable for a BE study and for the product under investigation. 
The population chosen as well as the sample size was found to be adequate and according to guidelines.  
Analytical methods 
In each study period, 21 blood samples were collected. The first blood sample was collected prior to drug 
administration while the others were collected up to 72 hours after drug administration. Blood samples 
were collected in pre-cooled K2 EDTA Vacutainers. As soon as possible following blood collection, samples 
were centrifuged at a temperature of 4°C nominal and at approximately 1500 g for 10 minutes. The 
plasma obtained was separated into duplicate polypropylene culture tubes, when feasible. The tubes were 
labelled with a code number that did not reveal formulation identity. The samples were frozen in an 
upright position and retained in the clinic's freezers at a temperature of -20°C nominal until sent on dry 
ice to the laboratory for assay. The time from blood sample collection to plasma aliquot storage should 
have been within 90 minutes. 
Plasma concentrations of Emtricitabine and Tenofovir were determined using a validated reversed phase 
HPLC-MS/MS methods. 
The subject sample analysis was performed between 2014/11/03 and 2014/11/19, including re-assays 
and incurred samples. For emtricitabine, the lower limit of quantitation and upper limit of quantitation 
were 10.0 ng/ml and 4000.0 ng/ml, respectively. For tenofovir, the lower limit of quantitation and upper 
limit of quantitation were 2.50 ng/ml and 800.00 ng/ml, respectively. 
The concentrations were calculated using peak area ratios and the linearity of the calibration curve was 
determined using least squares regression analysis employing a weighted (1/x²) linear (y=mx+b) for 
Emtricitabine and for Tenofovir. 
Pre-study validation and bio-analytical report are presented. The method selectivity and sensitivity were 
demonstrated. Stability of analytes at various conditions during storage, sample preparation and analysis 
was shown according to the requirements for bio-analytical method validation. Dilution integrity, 
carryover and matrix effect were tested. Composition of analytical runs has been described.  
The maximum study sample storage period from first blood draw (13/10/2014) to last sample analysis 
(19/11/2014) was 36 days for Emtricitabine and Tenofovir disoproxil.  
The long-term stability of Emtricitabine in human plasma covers 37 days at -20°C nominal. The long-term 
stability of Tenofovir in human plasma covers 60 days at -20°C nominal. 
Pre- and within study validation for the determination of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir in human plasma is 
sufficient. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Primary variables: Cmax and AUC0-72. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-72, AUC0-∞, AUC0-72/∞, λZ and Thalf  were determined.

exponential of the difference between the Test and Reference product for the ln-transformed parameters 
Cmax and AUC0-72 were all to be within the 80.00 to 125.00% bioequivalence range. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters calculated are appropriate for a single dose study.  Standard 
bioequivalence criteria are proposed for Cmax and AUC0-72.

21.1 
The 90% confidence intervals for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic variables Cmax and AUC0-72 were 
within the conventional bioequivalence range of 80% to 125%. 
For Emtricitabine, ANOVA revealed significant period effect for AUC0-t and significant sequence effect for 
Cmax, which are considered acceptable. Any subjects did not reach Cmax at the first sampling time point 
indicating that sampling time schedule was adequate. None of the subjects had measurable pre-dose 
plasma concentrations of Emtricitabine or Tenofovir. 
The %AUCextrap values were not applicable because sampling scheme reached out to 72 hours. 
The pharmacokinetic variables for Emtricitabine and Tenofovir are comparable between test and reference 
product. 
Safety data 
Although the incidence of drug-related AEs was slightly higher for subjects dosed with the Test 
formulation (Test 28% vs. Reference 19%), in general, both formulations were well tolerated in the 
study. The most frequent AEs reported were headache and somnolence, which are known as very 
common AEs of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir combination. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetic conclusion 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 200 mg/245 mg film-
coated tablet by Zentiva k.s., Czech Republic, is considered bioequivalent with Truvada 200 mg/245 mg 
film-coated tablet by Gilead Sciences Ireland UC, Ireland.

in 
The applicant’s proposal for routine risk minimisation measures is considered sufficient to address most of 
safety concerns. Additional risk minimisation measures are need to address the safety in patients with 
renal impairment. 
Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 could be acceptable if the 
applicant implements the changes to the RMP with the following details:  
The Applicant committed to update the RMP with an updated pharmacovigilance plan relating to 
monitoring of pregnancy outcomes/ safety in pregnancy within 2 months after Commission decision. 
2.6.  PSUR submission

and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.  Product information 
In line with the reference product, the SmPCs/PILs state that as method of administration the tablets may 
be disintegrated and mixed with water or food prior to administration in patients with difficulties 
swallowing tablets whole. The Applicant has submitted additional investigation results demonstrating that 
dissolution and disintegration of both test and reference products are taking place within 15 minutes, 
dissolution test of crushed tablets are unaffected (>85% dissolved in 15 min in the physiological pH 
range) and therefore are not expected to translate into any differences in pharmacokinetic parameters. 
Although the BE was demonstrated with tablets taken whole, the additional disintegration and dissolution 
data using crushed tablets support the applicability of specific administration recommendation in 
originator SmPC to the generic Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva product. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil film-coated tablets. The 
reference product Truvada is indicated for treatment and prevention of HIV infection. No nonclinical 
studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical 
information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, 
this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the 
efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects 
based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a [design summary]. The study design was 
considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective 
European requirements. [Comment on appropriateness of parallel design, studies in fed status, 
investigation of metabolites, etc] Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-
out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods 
applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil (phosphate) met the protocol-defined criteria 
for bioequivalence when compared with Truvada. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals 
for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance 
range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated.

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond 
those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Emtricitabine / Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is favourable in the following 
indication: 
Emtricitabine / Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the 
treatment of HIV 1 infected adults (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

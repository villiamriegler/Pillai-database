2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
The MAH proposed to introduce for Mimpara a new pharmaceutical form associated with new strengths (1 
mg, 2.5 mg and 5 mg hard capsules) for the use in a new proposed indication “secondary HPT in paediatric 
patients with CKD receiving dialysis”. 
2.1.1.  Epidemiology  
End-stage renal disease is a rare condition in childhood with an estimated worldwide median reported 
incidence in 2008 of 9 (range: 4 to 18) per million of the age-related population. Published data indicate a 
median waiting time to kidney transplant of 11 months (first quartile [Q1], third quartile [Q3]: 6, 17 months) 
among those listed for transplant in European countries (Harambat et al, 2013). No published data exist on 
the prevalence of paediatric patients with secondary HPT; however, point prevalence estimates using USRDS 
and DaVita databases for 2015 indicate that < 1000 patients 0 to < 18 years of age on dialysis (491 for 
haemodialysis and 475 for peritoneal dialysis) will develop secondary HPT (data on file, Amgen). Of these, 
approximately 300 patients are estimated to be 0 to 5 years of age, 220 aged 6 to 12 years and 
approximately 430 aged 13 to < 18 years. 
2.1.2.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) develops in children and adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 
pathophysiology of secondary HPT is thought to be similar in adults and children. Several factors are involved 
in the pathogenesis of secondary HPT in CKD. Early alterations in fibroblast growth factor 23, vitamin D 
metabolism, and calcium and phosphorus regulation lead to a reduction in signalling through the calcium-
sensing receptor (CaR) and an increase in PTH secretion, resulting in higher PTH concentrations. Because PTH 
is the principal physiological regulator of blood calcium concentration, increases in PTH offset physiologic 
disruptions in calcium. Late in the course of CKD, phosphorus retention and overt hyperphosphatemia, 
together with skeletal resistance to the calcaemic action of PTH, can also affect calcium metabolism 
adversely, and further increase PTH secretion among patients with more advanced CKD (Wetmore and 
Quarles, 2009; Goodman and Quarles, 2008; Slatopolsky et al, 2001; de Francisco et al, 1998). Collectively, 
these changes in calcium and phosphorus concentrations and vitamin D metabolism contribute to the 
progression of secondary HPT, which generally worsens in severity over time if left untreated. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation 
The development of CKD-mineral and bone disease (CKD-MBD) is manifested by either one or a combination 
of the following: 1) abnormalities in calcium, phosphorus, PTH, or vitamin D metabolism; 2) abnormalities in 
bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth, or strength; and 3) vascular or other soft tissue 
calcification (KDIGO, 2009). In children, CKD-MBD develops early in the course of CKD, such that a 
significant portion of children on dialysis have manifestations of CKD-MBD. 
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017 
Page 8/103 
 
 
  
  
The clinical outcome most frequently associated with secondary HPT is the development of high-turnover 
bone disease, which results in reduced bone mass and increases the risk of bone deformities and fractures in 
adults and children with advanced CKD. Secondary HPT is also thought to play a role in growth retardation in 
children, potentially through alterations in bone architecture (including lesions in the epiphyseal growth 
plate), which interfere with bone formation and lead to impaired bone growth. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Children with ESRD and secondary HPT are prioritized for kidney transplant and often undergo definitive 
treatment with renal transplant within the first year after starting dialysis. 
Currently, there are no approved medical therapies for the management of secondary HPT in paediatric 
patients with CKD receiving dialysis in the European Union (EU) or the US. A number of drugs have been 
approved adult patients including Cinacalcet. Current treatment consists of vitamin D sterols, such as 
calcitriol or synthetic vitamin D analogs. In some circumstances, their use may be limited due to aggravation 
of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, conditions associated with increased long-term cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality. 
2.2.  About the product 
Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent that increases the sensitivity of the CaR to extracellular calcium. Cinacalcet 
acts as an allosteric modulator of the CaR and regulates PTH secretion by amplifying the sensitivity of the 
receptor to extracellular calcium, thereby reducing PTH secretion (Nemeth et al, 2004; Nemeth and Bennett, 
1998). Cinacalcet is a first-in-class calcimimetic that is synthesized as a hydrochloride salt and is the (R)-
enantiomeric form. 
For the adult population, cinacalcet has received marketing authorization in 79 countries at the time of this 
report and is indicated for the treatment of secondary HPT in patients with CKD receiving dialysis. Cinacalcet 
is not currently approved for use in children, and there is no age-appropriate formulation available 
commercially, leading to possible off-label use that is not informed by age- and weight-based dosing and 
titration instructions or data from clinical studies.  
2.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific 
advice 
The paediatric studies were conducted according to the EU Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) and a Written 
Request (WR) in the US. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as granules in capsule for opening containing 1, 2.5 or 5 mg of cinacalcet 
(as hydrochloride salt) as active substance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017 
Page 9/103 
 
 
  
  
Other ingredients are: 
Capsule contents: pregelatinised starch (maize), microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, crospovidone and silica, 
dental type. 
Capsule shell: iron oxide yellow (E172) (1 mg and 2.5 mg capsules only), indigo carmine (E132) (1 and 5 mg 
capsules only), titanium dioxide (E171) and gelatin. 
Printing ink: iron oxide black, shellac and propylene glycol. 
The product is available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with a foil induction seal and a child 
resistant polypropylene cap, packed into a carton as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
Mimpara 1, 2.5 and 5 mg granules in capsule for opening contain the same active substance, cincacalcet 
hydrochloride, as that used to manufacture the already authorised film-coated tablets. The active substance 
is sourced from the same manufacturer, manufactured with the same process and released in accordance 
with the same active substance specifications. Therefore, the applicant presented no new information in the 
dossier to support this line extension application. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Mimpara is presented as granules in capsule for opening containing 1, 2.5 or 5 mg cinacalcet (as 
hydrochloride salt) as active substance and is packaged in HDPE bottles with a foil induction seal. 
The aim of development was to identify a dosage form bioequivalent to the film-coated tablets which is 
suitable for the paediatric population, in line with the paediatric investigation plan (PIP). Liquid formulations 
were found to induce mouth numbing and a prolonged bitter taste. Therefore, a capsule formulation was 
investigated. 
A bioequivalence study was conducted to assess the in vivo performance of the capsule formulation relative 
to an equivalent dose of the tablets. One 30 mg tablet was compared with the contents of 6 x 5 mg capsules 
sprinkled onto apple sauce. The sprinkled formulation was shown to be bioequivalent to the approved tablets. 
Bioequivalence was not demonstrated for the capsules swallowed whole. 
Organoleptic studies showed that the inherent bitterness of the active substance is sufficiently masked when 
an appropriate quantity of food is used and the mixture is eaten immediately. Instructions to this effect are 
included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
All 3 strengths are filled into size 2 hard gelatin capsules distinguishable by colour and imprinting. As the 
capsules are intended to be opened and sprinkled on food or liquid and not ingested, the use of colourants is 
acceptable. The proposed capsule strengths provide adequate dosing flexibility for the starting dose. 
However, the maintenance dose for older children who are not able to swallow could involve opening up to 
twelve 5 mg capsules on a daily basis. This would result in significant discomfort for the patient and care 
giver. However, it was agreed that only a small population would be affected since most patients would either 
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017 
Page 10/103 
 
 
  
  
be on a lower dose or able to swallow the approved 30 mg film-coated tablets. The applicant nonetheless 
committed to evaluating the need for additional 10 or 15 mg strength capsules. 
The capsule formulation uses the same intra-granular excipients as the approved tablet presentation. Extra-
granular excipients are different given that the capsule blend does not need to be compressed. Therefore, 
instead of microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, magnesium stearate and colloidal silicon dioxide present 
in the tablet, the sole extra-granular component is silica, dental type, which is an anti-adherent used to 
ensure complete dose delivery when the capsule contents are sprinkled on food or liquid. All excipients are 
well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no 
novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC and in paragraph 2.4.1 of this report. 
Initially, concerns were raised by CHMP about the suitability of the capsule dosage form resulting in a major 
objection. Capsules are generally swallowed whole but should not be in this case since bioequivalence with 
the tablets was only demonstrated for the capsule contents. In addition, the capsule shells contain colourants 
which are generally discouraged in paediatric medicines. In addition, assessors had difficulties opening the 
capsules without breakage which, given the low weight of granules per capsule (4 mg in 1 mg capsule, 10 mg 
in 2.5 mg capsule, 20 mg in 5 mg capsule), could result in spilling part of the dose or incomplete removal of 
the granules from the capsule in a real life setting. Therefore, there is a risk of under-dosing patients. As a 
result, the applicant was requested to consider alternative containers. In order to resolve this concern, the 
applicant committed to evaluating alternative capsule designs and identifying a capsule with improved 
properties (easier to open without breakage, reduced risk of contents spilling, and improved dose accuracy). 
In addition, more detailed instructions on how to open the current capsules, including pictures, have been 
included in the SmPC. Clear instructions that the capsules are not to be swallowed are included both in the 
SmPC and on the outer packaging. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The dissolution method is the same as that used for the approved film-coated tablets and is carried out on 
unopened capsules. The acceptance criteria are the same as for the tablets. The method was originally 
developed such that it is capable of discriminating between bioequivalent and non-bioequivalent batches of 
tablets. The dissolution method is applied to the capsules without further development. Given that the 
composition and manufacturing process of the granules is equivalent to that used for the film-coated tablets, 
this is considered acceptable. 
The wet granulation process is the same as that used for the film-coated tablets. The granules are 
subsequently blended with amorphous silicon dioxide, screened to ensure suitable particle size and content 
uniformity and encapsulated. The proposed commercial process is the same as used during clinical 
development. Holding times for the intermediate powder blend and bulk capsules have been set based on 
long term stability studies and the associated bulk packaging has been defined. 
Compatibility with various food items was assessed. Full recovery of the product was observed 3 hours after 
mixing with apple sauce, yoghurt, apple juice, or 3 renal milk formulae. Instructions as to how much food to 
use for mixing are provided in the SmPC. 
In addition, compatibility with typical gastrostomy and nasogastric tubes was evaluated, using water, apple 
juice or the 3 renal milk formulae as carrier liquids. Tubes made from PVC, polyurethane and silicon were 
investigated and the combination of water with PVC tubing was found to be most acceptable. Again, 
instructions for use in combination with feeding tubes are provided in the SmPC.

There are currently no standard terms in the EDQM database deemed suitable to describe the present 
formulation. The applicant originally proposed “hard capsules” but this was considered not to accurately 
reflect the dosage form by CHMP. The committee was of the opinion that since the granules must be removed 
from the capsule before consuming, granules should be part of the given pharmaceutical form. “Granules in 
single dose container” was considered following recommendation from EDQM but it was felt that describing a 
capsule as a single dose container would be confusing for patients. Since the capsule shouldn’t be swallowed, 
then a new term was invented which aims to ensure the capsules are opened and the granules sprinkled on 
food or liquid. The new term is “granules in capsule for opening” which is included in the SmPC and 
packaging. 
The primary packaging is HDPE bottles. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice 
of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of 
the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  five  main  steps:  wet  granulation,  milling  and  drying;  sieving  and 
blending; encapsulation; packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been evaluated by a number of studies. A continuous process 
verification approach has been employed, with the process monitored through design to pilot to commercial 
scale.  The  applicant  proposes  to  complete  validation  by  manufacturing  as  suitable  number  of  consecutive 
batches of common blend which will be used to manufacture  batches of capsules of each strength. Based on 
the demonstrated level of process understanding and manufacturing experience at the commercial site, this 
is  considered  acceptable.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing  process  and 
pharmaceutical  form.  The  amount  of  water  added  to  the  wet  granulation  is  tightly  controlled  to  ensure  the 
correct  particle  size.  Amount  and  frequency  of  capsule  tapping  is  also  controlled  to  ensure  correct  filling  of 
the capsules. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form  including 
appearance,  identity  (FTIR  and  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  content  uniformity  (HPLC), 
dissolution (HPLC), and moisture content (KF). 
The  omission  of  a  test  for  microbiological  quality  is  justified  given  the  low  water  activity  of  cinacalcet 
hydrochloride  and  the  lack  of  microbial  growth  seen  during  development  and  stability  studies.  A  test  for 
colourants is omitted since the capsules are not to be ingested. The limits for impurities are in line with the 
ICH Q3B limits. 
All tests with the exception of dissolution, appearance and content uniformity are conducted on the capsule 
contents,  essentially,  the  delivered  dose.  CHMP  considered  that  the  content  uniformity  test  should  also  be 
carried out on the contents only to better reflect the dose received by the patient. The applicant committed to 
modify the relevant analytical method which will be carried out on the contents alone. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented.

Batch analysis results are provided for 45 pilot and production scale batches of the 5 mg capsule, and 3 
production scale batches each of the 2.5 mg and 1 mg capsules confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Batches complied 
with the specification in place at the time of testing. During development, the assay limit was tightened as 
the process and encapsulation accuracy improved.  
Stability of the product 
A bracketing approach was taken to stability studies with the 2.5 mg capsule omitted. Stability data from 3 
production  scale  batches  of  the  1  and  5  mg  capsules  stored  for  up  to  under  18  months  under  long  term 
conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to 
the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  medicinal  product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. In addition, supportive data on 
5  batches  of  the  5  mg  strength  stored  for  up  to  60  months  under  long  term  conditions  was  also  provided. 
Samples  were  tested  for  the  same  properties  as  for  release  with  the  omission  of  identity  and  content 
uniformity. A test for microbiological quality was also carried out annually. A slight increase in water content 
was  observed  which  reached  a  plateau  but  had  no  impact  on  other  properties.  All  measured  parameters 
remained within specification throughout the studies. 
Photostability and forced degradation studies were carried out on the active substance as part of the original 
film-coated  tablet  development.  These  indicate  that  the  active  substance  is  very  stable  and  not 
photosensitive.  
In addition, samples of the capsule contents were exposed to stressed conditions (heat (60  oC for 2 weeks) 
and moist heat (50 oC / 75% RH for 2 weeks). The granules are stable under both sets of conditions. 
Based  on  available  stability  data  and  considering  the  stability  of  the  film-coated  tablets  (shelf-life  5  years) 
and the supportive batches, the proposed shelf-life of 48 months without defined storage conditions as stated 
in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. A valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture is provided. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The selected dosage form is not considered optimum by the CHMP for several reasons as discussed in the 
pharmaceutical development section. Nonetheless, the benefit/risk is still considered positive given the 
alternative to the proposed capsules for paediatric patients is the off-label use of crushed tablets with 
significant risk of mis-dosing and considering that detailed instructions, including pictures, have been

included in the SmPC. The applicant committed to investigating alternative capsules which are easier to open 
without breaking and would ensure the accurate dosing of patients. 
A commitment was also made to evaluate the need for higher strengths (e.g. 10 or 15 mg) for older children 
needing a high maintenance dose but who are unable to swallow, and would thus require the contents of up 
to 12 capsules to be administered with the currently available 5 mg capsules. 
Finally, the applicant committed to amend the content uniformity release test so that only the contents rather 
than the entire capsule is tested. This will ensure the result more accurately reflects what is given to the 
patient. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP notes that the applicant has agreed with the Committee’s recommendations as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
to evaluate alternative capsule designs and identify a capsule with improved properties (easier to 
open without breakage, reduced risk of contents spilling, and improved dose accuracy). A variation 
introducing the new capsule should be submitted. 
to evaluate the need for higher strength capsules (10 or 15 mg) for older children on a high 
maintenance dose who are unable to swallow tablets. 
to modify the content uniformity release test such that only the granules are tested rather than the 
contents and capsule shells. The method should be validated and the relevant variation submitted. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Pharmacology  
The pharmacology of cinacalcet was thoroughly evaluated during the original approval procedure for 
Mimpara. Cinacalcet acts on the parathyroid gland by increasing the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) 
sensitivity to extracellular calcium. The primary role of the CaSR is control of parathyroid hormone (PTH) 
secretion in response to extracellular calcium concentration. Cinacalcet acts as an allosteric modulator of the 
CaSR, resulting in reduced circulating PTH concentrations. Proof of concept was shown in rat models of 
secondary HPT (5/6 nephrectomy (Nx); antibiotic-induced renal failure). 
The safety pharmacology program covered the central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular, respiratory, 
renal, gastrointestinal, and glucose homeostatic systems. Cinacalcet at 200 mg/kg produced decreased 
spontaneous motor activity in mice. This effect was attributed to hypocalcaemia resulting from the 
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017 
Page 14/103 
 
 
  
  
pharmacological effect of the drug. Increased gastric motility was observed in mice at a dose of 200 mg/kg. 
Cinacalcet administered intravenously at 20 mg/kg in guinea pigs produced a transient increase in airway 
resistance and one guinea pig died as the result of bronchoconstriction 6 minutes following dosing. 
Studies performed to determine potential interaction with a selection of receptors, channels and enzymes, 
suggested a potential, small risk for receptor interactions in the clinical situation. Considering the low safety 
margins in most safety pharmacology and toxicology studies, the presence of secondary pharmacological 
events cannot be excluded.  
No new non-clinical pharmacology studies were submitted in support of the present application. This is 
acceptable. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetic aspects of cinacalcet were thoroughly evaluated during the original approval 
procedure for Mimpara. Oral bioavailability was generally low, less than 10% in rats and approximately 20% 
in humans. Cinacalcet was highly protein bound (93% to 99%) in all species. Studies with radiolabelled drug 
showed that cinacalcet is widely distributed in tissues without marked accumulation. Cinacalcet was excreted 
into the milk of lactating rats and crossed the placental barrier in rabbits. Cinacalcet is metabolised 
extensively in mice, rats, monkeys and humans. Studies with specific CYP inhibitors suggested CYP3A4 and 
CYP1A2 as the major contributors of cinacalcet metabolism in humans. Both hepato-biliary and urinary 
elimination are major routes of elimination. 
No new non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies were submitted in support of the present application. This is 
acceptable. 
2.5.3.  Toxicology 
Previously conducted toxicology studies 
The toxicological profile of cinacalcet was characterized during the original approval procedure for Mimpara. 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 1 month (dog), 6 months (rat) and 1 year (monkey), hypocalcemia 
resulting from the pharmacological effect of cinacalcet was the dose-limiting toxicity. Conventional in vitro 
and in vivo genotoxicity studies, and 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies, did not indicate a genotoxic or 
carcinogenic potential for cinacalcet. Reproductive toxicology studies showed no effect on fertility in rats. 
Embryotoxicity (lower foetal body weights) was observed in rats and rabbits at doses associated with 
maternal toxicity. There was no evidence for a teratogenic potential; however, the margins to human clinical 
exposure were small.  
In the original MAA, two 1-month juvenile toxicity studies in rats and dogs were included. The age of the 
animals covered a human age range of 2-12 years. The maximum doses used were low and did not reach the 
MTD. Rats showed bone density changes in the femur at > 1.5 mg/kg. In dogs, intramural left ventricular 
arterial hypertrophy was noted in a few animals in all dose groups, including the control, with increasing 
severity seen among dogs administered 1.5 or 5.0 mg/kg at the end of the recovery period only. One male in 
the high dose group had multifocal left ventricular myocardial fibrosis. The relationship of these findings to 
the test article was considered unclear. The exposure to cinacalcet at the highest dose (5 mg/kg) was 0.1-
fold that of the adult human dose.

New juvenile toxicity studies 
To support the presently sought paediatric indication, the Applicant conducted two new juvenile toxicity 
studies in Beagle dogs. The first study was a 14-day dose-range finding study using doses of 10, 30 and 100 
mg/kg/day. The highest dose, 100 mg/kg/day, was judged to be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based 
on clinical signs related to hypocalcaemia as well as the magnitude of decrease in serum ionized calcium.  
In the second, 6-month pivotal toxicity study, the same doses (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day) were used. The 
dogs were aged 10 weeks at the start of treatment, corresponding to an approximate human age of 2 years. 
A 3-month recovery period was included. The main findings from the study are summarized below: 
Mortality 
One female dog at 100 mg/kg/day was euthanized on Day 88 due to lack of appetite and growth. The dog 
had been on drug holiday between Days 64-70, but failed to regain appetite and body weight when drug 
treatment was reinitiated.  
Clinical signs 
Tremor, emesis and decreased activity were observed at all dose levels. These effects are considered due to 
cinacalcet-induced hypocalcaemia. As a consequence of vomiting, dogs treated at > 30 mg/kg/day showed 
dehydration and thin body condition.  
Body weight and food consumption 
Body weight gain and body weight were reduced ranging from 11% to 33% in dogs treated at > 30 
mg/kg/day; males being somewhat more affected than females. Food consumption was generally reduced, 
although exact figures were not possible to calculate.  
Haematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis 
Slightly decreased red blood cell parameters and increased platelets were observed in dogs treated at > 30 
mg/kg/day. The Applicant related this finding to decreases in body weight secondary to decreased food 
consumption and lymphoid changes in the thoracic cavity. It is argued by the Applicant that an extended 
restoration of red blood cell levels after recovery from malnutrition or weight loss is a phenomenon known 
from clinical observations in undernourished children and is also related to the long life span of red blood 
cells. This explanation is considered acceptable. 
Total serum calcium and ionized calcium were decreased, and phosphorus increased, at all dose levels. There 
was a trend for increased serum levels of PTH at all dose levels, as evaluated at the end of study. Urinary 
calcium oxalate crystals were present at all dose levels.  
Target organs of toxicity 
Bone (femur, radius) was identified as the main target organ of toxicity. Minimal growth plate thickening of 
the calcification zone in the femur was observed at all dose levels, and in the radius at 100 mg/kg/day. 
Investigation ex vivo using pQCT showed slightly decreased bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral 
density (BMD) and total and cortical mean area in the distal femur metaphysis and diaphysis at > 30 
mg/kg/day. The periosteal circumference was slightly lower compared with controls. There were no effects on 
bone resorption markers in serum; however, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) was slightly decreased 
at > 30 mg/kg/day.   
Other findings 
Minimal to moderate lymphoid hyperplasia of thoracic (tracheobronchial, mediastinal) lymph nodes and the 
bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) in the lung was present at all dose levels. In addition, minimal to 
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017 
Page 16/103 
 
 
  
  
slight mononuclear cell infiltration was seen in the esophagus at all dose levels. These findings were 
interpreted by the Applicant as secondary to vomiting and aspiration of vomitus. Changes in the 
tracheobronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes and related findings were not fully reversible after the 3-
month recovery period. The Applicant argues based on a literature review on the influence of emesis on local 
irritation of the esophagus as well as on aspiration pneumonitis. Moreover, a literature based remark that 
regression of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia might be of extended duration due to various factors was made. 
Based on non-clinical studies conducted by the Applicant, a connection of emesis with the incidence of 
bronchointerstitial inflammation and mediastinal lymph node enlargement was made. In addition, it was 
remarked that, of various species investigated within the scope of the non-clinical development in studies of 
up to 2 year duration, the dog was the only one that developed this kind of changes. Taking all data into 
consideration, the Applicant’s explanation is considered acceptable.  
Reversibility 
All findings were reversible except for thin body condition and decreased red blood cell mass at > 30 
mg/kg/day, body weight decrease in females, changes in the tracheobronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes, 
and decreased BMD and total and cortical mean area of the femur in females at > 30 mg/kg/day.  
Toxicokinetics 
Exposure to cinacalcet was comparable (< 1.5-fold different) between male and female juvenile dogs. There 
was a slight accumulation of drug at weeks 12 and 26 relative to week 4. The exposure in terms of AUC0-24 at 
100 mg/kg/day was 527 hr*ng/mL (combined sexes) at week 26. The margin to adult human AUC0-24 at a 
maximum dose of 180 mg/day is 0.8-fold.  
NOAEL 
The NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day.  
2.5.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant submitted an environmental risk assessment (ERA) as part of the original MAA for Mimpara in 
2003. This ERA had been conducted in accordance with the draft EMA guidance available at the time 
(CPMP/SWP/4447/00 draft, 24 July 2003).   Following review of the original ERA, the MAH agreed to a post 
approval commitment (FUM003) to conduct Phase II Tier A testing following CHMP/SWP/4447/00 draft, 20 
January 2005.  The 2005 draft guidance contained different testing guidance from the draft 2003 (especially 
with regard to aquatic effects studies) to determine environmental risk.  
This Phase II Tier A testing was completed and submitted to the Agency on 30th September 2005. The CHMP 
adopted a positive conclusion on acceptability of the ERA, and fulfilment of FUM003, on 15th December 2005 
stating:  “The environmental risk assessment is acceptable and the conclusion that cinacalcet will not 
represent a significant risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients is endorsed. Follow-
up measure 003 should be considered fulfilled.” 
The Applicant has provided calculations of predicted environmental concentration (PEC) surface water for the 
previously approved indications in adults as well as the proposed paediatric indication. The calculation for the 
paediatric indication is not agreed with. The parameter DOSEai should be the maximum daily dose consumed 
per patient, not the average. Thus, DOSEai should be 180 mg instead of 17.5 mg. This results in a 
PECsurfacewater of 0.0005319 µg/L.  
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017 
Page 17/103 
 
 
  
  
In accordance with the ERA Q&A guidance (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010), if a product can be prescribed for 
the treatment of more than one indication, the PECsurfacewater
calculated. The correct calculation is as follows: 0.022 + 0.605 + 0.00605 + 0.0005319 = 0.633 µg/L. This is 
values for all the sought indications should be 
well above the trigger value of 0.01 µg/L and thus a Phase II, Tier A environmental fate and effects analysis 
is requested. Since this was already provided in the original MAA for Mimpara, no further action is considered 
necessary.  
2.5.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The new juvenile toxicity study in dogs covers the age range of 2-12 years in a human child. Previously 
conducted 28-day rat and dog studies, using lower doses, also covered this age range. In the initially sought 
indication children younger than 2 years were included; thus it may be argued that there is no specific 
toxicological coverage for the period 0-2 years.  
The difficulties of conducting studies in animals of corresponding age to humans in the period 0-2 years are 
acknowledged. In the case of cinacalcet, the toxicological profile has been established in previous repeat-
dose toxicity studies in young adult animals, as well as in juvenile rats and dogs. The main finding in all 
previous studies, as well as in the two new juvenile toxicity studies in dogs, was hypocalcaemia due to the 
pharmacological action of cinacalcet. The consequences of hypocalcaemia are well-known and it is considered 
unlikely that studies in younger animals would identify any additional or unexpected toxic effects. Thus the 
new juvenile toxicity studies in dogs, together with the previously conducted toxicology package, are 
considered sufficient to support the currently sought paediatric indication of cinacalcet.   
The most important findings from the pivotal 6-month study were growth retardation (decreased body weight 
and body weight gain) and effects on bone, including minimal growth plate thickening of the calcification zone 
in the femur, at clinically relevant exposure levels. These effects are likely related to cinacalcet-induced 
hypocalcaemia. Since serum calcium and body weight will be followed in the clinic, potential adverse effects 
on growth will be monitorable.  
There were no findings in the heart of dogs treated up to 100 mg/kg/day for 6 months. Since the dose, 
exposure and duration were higher/longer than in the previously conducted juvenile dog study where 
equivocal heart findings were observed, it is agreed with the Applicant that cinacalcet is not toxic to the heart 
of juvenile dogs.  
Red cell mass was decreased at > 30 mg/kg/day in the 6-month juvenile dog study. Similar findings were 
observed in adult monkeys. The mechanism is not clear; however, no effects on red blood cells have been 
observed in the paediatric clinical trials. 
Lymphoid changes in the thoracic cavity of dogs were interpreted as local non-specific responses to emesis-
associated aspiration.  
The low exposure margins are stated by the Applicant to be due to the fact that healthy animals are more 
sensitive to the hypocalcaemic effects of cinacalcet. This relates to the greater effect of PTH on calcium 
reabsorption in intact kidneys relative to secondary HPT patients with little or no kidney function, who also 
have elevated PTH and serum calcium. The Applicant’s explanation seems plausible.  
The Applicant was asked to propose appropriate wording regarding the new dog studies, including main 
findings and exposure margins, for section 5.3 of the SmPC. The text proposed by the Applicant was 
acceptable, with a minor revision.

2.5.6.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
There is no objection to an approval of Mimpara from a non-clinical point of view 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
Study 20070293 underwent a GCP inspection. The inspection identified deficiencies in documentation of 
investigational product (IP) administration and sample handling that called into question the overall reliability 
of data from Study 20070293.  Specifically, the inspectors found that labelling and packaging of 
investigational product was not performed in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The 
Inspectors concluded that protocol compliance with regard to IMP administration could not be confirmed 
during the inspection due to inability to reproduce IMP labels, and insufficient dosing documentation.  Since 
the protocol required administration of six capsules or one tablet per subject respectively, the Inspector 
considered it essential that the correct number of IMP units was dosed. Further, there were also issues 
affecting PK Sample analysis. As the bioanalytical site, couldn’t demonstrate consistent application of 
acceptance criteria the reported PK sample concentrations of study samples analysed are in question for 12 
subjects.  
During the procedure the applicant has performed a new bioequivalence study (20160428) in line with the 
requirements as outlined in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev. 1/Corr**. Bioequivalence has been shown between treatment A and B i.e between 6x5 mg capsule and 
the 30 mg tablet (see results below). 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.6.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Comparative Bioequivalence study 20070293 
The applicant presented an open-label, randomized, single-dose, 3-period, 3-treatment crossover study to 
assess the comparative Bioavailability of 5 mg Cinacalcet Capsules to the 30 mg Commercial Formulation 
Cinacalcet tablets in healthy adult volunteers. An inspection was carried out of the conduct of the clinical 
study 20070293, in accordance with the article 57 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 and article 15 of 
Directive 2001/20/EC. The study was considered invalid due to GCP violations was discovered with 
deficiencies in the administration of IP and the documentation processes. Further there were also deficiencies 
in bioanalysis of the plasma samples, however as the study is considered as invalid this is not further 
pursued.  The applicant conducted a new bioequivalence study (20160428) in order to support the validity of 
the results of the first study. Accordingly, the concerns regarding the analytical part of study 20070293 were 
not further pursued.

A new bioequivalence study with an open-label, randomized, single-dose, and crossover design to assess the 
bioequivalence of paediatric cinacalcet capsule (administered as six of the 5-mg cinacalcet capsules) with 30 
mg commercial cinacalcet tablet in 44 healthy adult volunteers was performed. 
The results showed that the geometric least square mean point estimates (90% CIs) for the ratios of capsule 
contents versus tablet were 0.947 (0.861, 1.042) for AUCinf, 0.945 (0.861, 1.039) for AUClast, and 0.998 
(0.885, 1.126) for Cmax, and were within the pre-specified criteria of 0.80 and 1.25.  
For commercial use in the paediatric population, 1 mg, 2.5 mg, and 5 mg capsule strengths are planned. 
However, the study 20160428 only 5mg capsules were tested but it was confirmed that the general biowaiver 
criteria according to the BE guideline are fulfilled for the 1mg and 2.5mg capsule strengths. 
Clinical PK studies 
Study 20030227 was a Phase I, Open-Label, Non-Randomized, Single-Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Cinacalcet HCl in Paediatric Subjects aged 6 to < 18 
years with Chronic Kidney Disease Receiving Dialysis.

The subjects received a single, oral, 15-mg dose (1/2 of a 30-mg tablet, corresponding to a mean dose of 
0.39 mg/kg (range: 0.28 mg/kg to 0.81 mg/kg)) of cinacalcet and were followed for 72 hours after dosing for 
the study assessments. Enrolled subjects were stratified by age into 4 cohorts of 3 subjects each: 6 to 8, 9 to 
11, 12 to 14, and 15 to 17 years. Subjects had an age range of 6 to 16 years (mean: 11.33 years) and a 
body mass index range of 15.6 kg/m2 to 25.6 kg/m2 (mean: 19.85 kg/m2). 
Mean exposure in 4 age cohorts did not consistently increase with decreasing age. However, an overall trend 
of greater exposure in younger subjects was observed in individual Cmax and AUC0-t values. In addition, 
although a trend of increasing exposure with decreasing body weight also was observed, these data should 
be interpreted with caution given the single 15 mg dose of cinacalcet administered and the small subject 
numbers (N = 3/cohort) evaluated. 
More recent data (study 20090005, see below) indicate that the trend of increasing exposure is owed mainly 
to the decreasing body weight at younger age and that weight corrected dose could prevent this effect. This 
is supported also by simulations from a PK model where no clinically relevant differences were observed in 
both PK and PD attributes of cinacalcet, but still, a trend of highest cinacalcet plasma levels in the youngest 
patients at any dose level was seen. The clinical relevance of this trend is not clear and the high intra-
individual variability as well as the small sample size need to be considered. An increased vulnerability in 
younger children can, however, not be completely excluded which should be considered regarding the 
extrapolation approach in children 28 days to < 6 years of age. Choice of a rather conservative starting dose 
in children (approx. ½ of the adult starting dose in mg/kg bw) is welcome and mitigates concerns with this 
regard. 
Study 20090005 (PIP study 4, phase I study) was an Open-label, Single-dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Cinacalcet HCl in Paediatric Subjects Aged 28 Days 
to < 6 Years With Chronic Kidney Disease Receiving Dialysis.  
Doses were weight-adjusted to be 0.25 mg/kg and rounded to the nearest whole number. Doses from 1.8 mg 
to 5.4 mg were administered. Mimpara granules will be available in 1 mg, 2.5 mg and 5 mg capsules. In 
clinical practice, no such precise dosing as in study 200900005 will be possible or is proposed. For 
pharmacokinetic characterisation, the accurate dosing approach is welcome as the dose/exposure relationship 
can reliably be determined in this way. It is, however unknown if the aspired dose in this PK study could be 
sustained through the “mixing” process with purified water or sucrose syrup. 
Two children < the age of 1 year seems to have been included in the study (see Table 9-2).

Pharmacokinetic Results 
Cinacalcet was rapidly absorbed, with a median tmax of 1 hour (range: 0.50 to 4.0 hours; Table 3 and Figure 
6). Mean plasma cinacalcet Cmax and AUC values were slightly higher (1.6- to 2.3-fold) in subjects ≤3 to < 6 
years old compared to subjects 28 days to < 3 years old, but were within the range observed for subjects 28 
days to < 3 years old. Therefore, given the extensive overlap and the high inter-subject variability, these 
results suggest that there is no clinically meaningful difference in cinacalcet exposure between the age 
groups. The limited number of subjects (especially in the younger cohort) has to be taken into account.

Study 20110100 (Phase II) was an Open-label, Single-arm Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of 
Cinacalcet HCl in Addition to Standard of Care in Paediatric Subjects Age 28 Days to < 6 years With Chronic 
Kidney Disease and Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Receiving Dialysis where PK sampling was a secondary 
objective. This study was not a PIP binding measure. Pharmacokinetic and PTH blood samples were collected 
on day 1 (predose and postdose), week 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20. At week 12, subjects had a PK assessment 
over a 24 hour period at predose, and postdose. Dosing of investigational product in Study 20110100 was 
temporarily suspended following a fatality in Study 20070208 (described further in the safety section of this 
overview, data cut-off for the interim analysis was 01.March 2013). 
As notified by the Applicant in August 2016, study 20110100 was recently closed due to difficulties with 
recruitment and a short summary of efficacy and safety results was provided. In the initial submission, 
neither interim nor final PK results were reported for the individual study, interim results were pooled with 
the results from other paediatric studies and included in the cross-study comparisons (see below); interim PK 
and PD data were also included in the population PK and PK/PD analysis. No AUC, Cmax and t max values were 
reported. It is not clear how many PK samples from different time points are available as it is not reported 
how many samples were collected. This study is the only source of repeat dose PK of cinacalcet in children 
and an individual interpretation of PK development over time is of interest.. Individual Plasma Cinacalcet HCl 
concentration-time profiles varied considerably between individual subjects and cohorts. Also, dose- and 
weight-normalized AUClast and Cmax show large variability. According to the Applicant, cinacalcet exposures 
(based on Cmax and AUClast) at week 12 appeared to generally increase with the increase in dose. Results 
indicate that the PK/PD relationship is similar across age groups, when taking into account baseline 
characteristics. However, the sample size is limited and conclusions might therefore not be very robust. In

addition, the applicant did not inform on PK/PD relationship at steady state and if it could be different in 
paediatric patients compared to adults.   
Study 20070208 (PIP study 6, Phase III) was a Randomized, Double-Blind,  30-week, Placebo-Controlled 
Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Cinacalcet in Paediatric Subjects with Chronic Kidney Disease and 
Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Receiving Dialysis were PK sampling was an exploratory objective. Blood 
samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis were collected pre-dose in all subjects and between 1 and less 
than 3 hours post-dose (half of hemodialysis subjects) or 3 to 24 hours post-dose (half of hemodialysis 
subjects) during the double-blind phase. This study was terminated early due to a fatality and after 
consultation with regulatory authorities. A total of 380 study samples were analysed between 15 December 
2011 and 20 June 2013. It is reported, that 22 subject received cinacalcet in the study and that 227 samples 
were analysed. However, results were not reported for the individual study but only used for POP PK and 
PK/PD modelling and simulation efforts (study 122055). According to the Applicant observed cinacalcet 
concentrations were within the expected range of exposures for this population. The cinacalcet concentration 
data from Study 20070208 was pooled with the results from other paediatric studies and included in the 
population PK and PK/PD analyses. No PK parameters (AUC, Cmax and t max) were reported.  
Comparison of Cinacalcet Exposure in Adult and Paediatric Subjects 
Four different PK studies using different cinacalcet (starting) doses (mg/kg) in different age groups (children 
and adults) were opposed for the comparison of AUC and Cmax parameters. 
Cinacalcet exposures based on observed dose- and weight-normalized Cmax and area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24hr) were compared across 3 paediatric studies in 
the target population with intensive PK data.  
• Study 20090005 and interim results from Study 20110100, age range 28 days to < 6 years (the youngest 
subject was 8 months old) and;  
• Study 20030227, age range 6 to < 18 years old. 
Data from a representative single-dose (30 mg) healthy adult study (20060133) were also included for 
cinacalcet exposure comparison purposes. Of note, the PK of cinacalcet is the same in healthy adults and 
adult subjects with CKD and secondary HPT receiving dialysis (Study 990163; renal impairment study). Dose- 
and weight-normalized Cmax and AUC0-24hr values (after first dose) in paediatric subjects with CKD and 
secondary HPT receiving dialysis and in healthy adult subjects largely overlapped and mean values were 
similar (< 1.31-fold and < 1.91-fold difference, respectively; Figure 9 and Figure 10), indicating that the PK 
of cinacalcet are similar between adults and paediatric subjects. The dose- and weight-normalized Cmax and 
AUC0-24hr values (after first dose) were also similar (< 1.40-fold and < 1.87-fold difference, respectively) 
between the paediatric age groups (28 days to < 6 years old, 6 to < 18 years old) and across the paediatric 
studies, demonstrating that cinacalcet PK is also similar across the paediatric age range. The comparisons of 
dose- and weight-normalized PK data across the adult and paediatric subjects indicate dose-linearity over the 
dose range evaluated. In addition, these results also support the consistency in cinacalcet PK regardless of 
renal function status and disease status between paediatric and adults subjects.

The mean AUC0-t and Cmax values following weight corrected cinacalcet doses in study 20030227 (mean dose 
of 0.39 mg/kg, range: 0.28 mg/kg to 0.81 mg/kg), study 200900005 (a single 0.25 mg/kg dose of cinacalcet 
supplied as a 5 mg capsule) and study 20110100 (starting dose 0.20 mg/kg) were within the range of values 
observed following a single 30-mg dose of cinacalcet administered to healthy adult subjects in study 
20060133 (30 mg once daily is an approximate weight-based dose of 0.4 mg/kg in an average adult (weight 
of 70 kg)). Cross-study comparison of PK parameters shows comparable PK values (Cmax, AUC) in different 
age groups of paediatric patients and adults at different doses/body weight. Considering the wide range of 
AUC and Cmax the significance of mean values is somewhat low, the high inter-individual variability seems 
constant across all age groups and the distribution of individual data points (Figure 9 and 10) is in a 
comparable range. Still, this makes the choice of an adequate starting dose somewhat complicated. It is 
therefore considered acceptable to propose a conservative starting dose (0.2mg/kg) from a PK (and a safety) 
point of view. 
PK results from study 20070208 were not included in the the figures 8 & 10 above but were included in the 
pop PK/PD analysis. 
Pk data in children using the new capsule formulation 
There are pk data (Cmax and AUC) demonstrating the similarity in cinacalcet pharmacokinetic (PK) exposures 
between tablet vs. capsule formulations in adult and paediatric subjects.   
Population PK analysis 
Cinacalcet plasma, serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and corrected calcium (cCa) concentration-time 
data were collected from 4 paediatric clinical studies (20070208, 20110100, 20030227, and 20090005) and 4 
adult clinical studies (20000172, 20000187, 970241 and 980126). Cinacalcet was administered orally with 
doses ranging from 1 to 200 mg. The PK, iPTH and cCa concentration-time data from the above-mentioned 8 
studies were pooled for the population PK and PKPD analysis. Cinacalcet pharmacokinetics was described by a 
two-compartment model with delayed first-order absorption and first order elimination processes. The PK 
model has been updated to included body weight with fixed exponents to standard allometric scaling factors 
(0.75 on CL and 1 on V2). The popPK model has the potential to be further improved, i.e. by handling of BQL 
data. However, the GOF plots and the VPCs show that the model is reasonable and thus, the simulations on 
exposure for the start doses can be simulated out to  guide that the choice of start dose in children 3-18 
years. The simulations indicate that the apllicants suggested start dose gives a similar or lower exposure 
compared to the exposure after 30 mg start dose in adults. 
PKPD analysis 
The interaction between cinacalcet, iPTH and cCa were described by a semi-mechanistic PKPD model. The 
model included the role of PTH in calcium regulation, the feedback of calcium onto PTH production via the 
calcium sensing receptor (CaSR), and the activity of cinacalcet plasma levels in increasing the sensitivity of 
the CaSR to calcium via the cooperative binding model. Age, weight, race, sex, and phosphorus were 
assessed and none of them were identified as predictors of PD variability. The updated population PK model, 
including the added allometric scaling of volumes and clearances, was used as the driver for the PD effects.   
Data from 5 additional subjects from Study 20110100 were also included in the PK/PD model update. The 
simulations from the PKPD model indicate that the chosen start doses in children are safe but there are still 
issues with the PD part of the model. 
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017 
Page 28/103 
 
 
  
  
 
From the provided GOF and VPC plots in the PKPD report (122055b), clear trends of misspecification can be 
seen throughout. The applicant has explained that there are several limitations including that the PKPD model 
does not account for changes in supplements like calcium and vitamin D (allowed by the protocol), which 
impacts changes in calcium and PTH. The limitations described by 
MAH and the clear misspecification from the PKPD model mean that it is not possible to draw accurate 
conclusions from these simulations. Thus, the choice of start dose will need to be based on the simulated 
exposures from the popPK model alone. 
PBPK analysis 
The PBPK platform including peadiatric module (SimCYP version 14.1) was used. The ontogeny was updated 
according to Upreti and Wahlstrom (2016).  The ontogeny was further supported using external although 
limited pk data for the CYP enzymes involved in cinacalcet metabolism. The used platform is however not 
deemed qualified to be used for children below 2-3 years of age.  
The PBPK cinacalcet model was first established in adults using a two compartment distribution model. The 
PBPK simulation study design mimicked the clinical study design with regard to number of patients, dose and 
study length (n = 82, 30 mg and 24 h, respectively).  
Refinement of the cinacalcet compound file was achieved through sensitivity analysis; the sensitivity analysis 
was used to optimize fm, CYP by comparison of the simulated change in cinacalcet AUC upon co-
administration with KTZ to the observed change in cinacalcet AUC from the clinical DDI study with KTZ. The 
updated cinacalcet PBPK model in adults do show reasonable prediction. However based on the performed 
sensitivity analysis there are aspects that could be improved to provide a better prediction.  
The refined cinacalcet compound file was used in all subsequent paediatric PBPK simulations. This PBPK 
model was then used to predict plasma concentration-time profiles for paediatric patients aged 28 days to 18 
year. Initial predictions were carried out at a 0.20 mg/kg dose of cinacalcet, the starting dose used in Amgen 
Study 20110100 and the expected starting dose for future cinacalcet paediatric studies. The simulations for 
children below 18 years of age show that the PK of cinacalcet is not adequate predicted for absorption and 
the elimination phase.  
Even if the PBPK simulations provide a conservative estimate of expected exposures in children the use of 
PBPK in this context for cinacalcet is too uncertain as the PBPK model in children do not show adequate 
performance as well as the Qualification aspects in young children (below 3 years) is too limited to use PBPK 
for extrapolation. 
2.6.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Efficacy was not a component of the phase 1 single-dose studies; however, the effects of cinacalcet on serum 
calcium and iPTH were evaluated. 
Study 20030227: A Phase I, Open-Label, Non-Randomized, Single-Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Cinacalcet HCl in Pediatric Subjects (6-18 years) 
with Chronic Kidney Disease Receiving Dialysis (n=12). 
Subjects received a single, oral, 15 mg dose. Mean serum PTH concentrations initially decreased from 
baseline up to 4 hours post dose, increased to above baseline between 4 to 12 (peak at 8 hours) hours post 
dose, and returned to baseline levels by day 2 as seen in figure 1 below.

Figure 2. Mean Calcium Concentration - Time Profiles for Each Age Group 
An apparent trend of increasing cinacalcet exposure with decreasing age was noted in this study, possibly 
related to less body weight. The data provided supported using a dose of 0.2 mg/kg as a starting dose in 
multi-dose paediatric studies with cinacalcet. The dose is up-titrated according to response. The maximum 
dose was lowered to 2.5 mg/kg/day (instead of 4.2 mg/kg/day) following a fatality in study 20070208. 
Study 20090005: An Open-label, Single-dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics 
and Pharmacodynamics of Cinacalcet HCl in Pediatric Subjects Aged 28 Days to < 6 Years With Chronic 
Kidney Disease Receiving Dialysis (n=12) 
Baseline PTH values varied widely since there were no inclusion criteria for minimum PTH levels. One subject 
had PTH post baseline values that were significantly higher than those observed for other subjects. Following 
a single oral dose of 0.25 mg/kg cinacalcet, reductions in serum PTH concentrations from baseline were 
observed at the 2 hours and 8 hours post dose sampling times. Concentrations of serum PTH transiently 
increased to above baseline at 12 hours post dose (+29.4%), and returned to near baseline levels by day 3 
(-5.4%). Median percent PTH reductions were more pronounced at 8 hours post dose in subjects ≥ 3 years to 
< 6 years old (-42.2%) than in subjects 28 days to < 3 years old (-5.2%), but this observation should be 
interpreted with caution given the small subject numbers (N = 3 and N = 2, respectively).

CKD = chronic kidney disease; PTH = intact parathyroid hormone Note: Day 3 = 48 hours postdose. 
After administration of cinacalcet, large intersubject variations in PTH concentration were observed, and 
median percent reductions in plasma PTH concentration appeared to correlate with changes in cinacalcet 
concentration immediately after dosing. As cinacalcet concentration declined towards undetectable levels, 
PTH concentration transiently increased and returned to baseline levels by day 3. Slight reductions in serum 
calcium were observed, followed by a return to baseline. The overall pattern of changes from baseline in 
mean serum calcium and PTH concentrations was similar for both age groups.

The results from the study 20090005 (< 6 Years) showed only a tendency to slight reductions in serum 
calcium were observed.  Large inter-subject variations in PTH concentrations were observed. A tendency to 
initial decrease followed by an increase at 12 hours was observed in age group 3-6 years but not in children 
<3 years. The decrease in PTH was most pronounced at 8 hours in contrast to Study 20030227 which 
showed a peak in PTH at the same endpoint. 
2.6.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has performed a PK/PD and a PBPK model to predict the pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet in paediatric 
patients down to 28 days and less than 1 year respectively, as clinical data in this age range is limited. 
The sought indication was for children > 28 days. However, the youngest subject recruited and evaluated in 
any trials was 7 months old. Extrapolation on the basis of modelling- and simulation was performed using 
pop PK, PKPD and PBPK analyses. The PK/PD analysis was deemed too uncertain.  The PBPK was suggested 
to be used to predict PK in young children as the clinical PK data is very limited in this age group. Even if the 
PBPK simulations provide a conservative estimate of expected exposures in children the use of PBPK in this 
context for cinacalcet is too uncertain as the PBPK model in children does not show adequate performance. 
The simulations from the popPK model can be used to guide a safe start dose in children down to 3 years of 
age and while the popPK model can be further improved, it appears passable for this purpose. There remain 
significant uncertainties that reliable and reasonable dosing recommendations can be derived, especially for 
the younger age cohorts.  As the extrapolation exercises do not provide reliable results for all age groups, the 
target population might need to be adapted accordingly. 
Thus, the dose recommendation below the age of 3 is not supported.  The applicant has updated the dosing 
table in the SmPC accordingly and appropriate weight cut off based on 3 years of age is included.   
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy

Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis 
In  addition,  a  cumulative  3  year  interim  analysis  of  data  collected  by  the  NAPRTCS  Dialysis  registry  on  the 
use of cinacalcet in dialysis participants aged <21 years was submitted and is discussed in the safety section.

Main studies 
Study 20070208  
(Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects 6 to < 18 years) 
Methods 
This multicenter study consisted of a 30-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase followed 
by a 30-week open-label phase. All subjects, regardless of treatment assignment received standard of care 
with vitamin D sterols (calcitriol and its analogs), calcium supplements, and phosphate binders at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
In addition to standard of care, in the double-blind phase, subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either 
cinacalcet or placebo. Eligibility was assessed during a 40-day screening period. 
The hypothesis for this study was that cinacalcet would reduce PTH by at least 30% in a larger proportion of 
paediatric CKD subjects with secondary HPT receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis compared to 
placebo. 
This study was terminated early due to a fatality, see following sections. 
Study participants  
Eligible subjects were between the ages of 6 to less than 18 years old who had CKD and secondary HPT 
treated with either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis for ≥ 2 months. 
Eligible subjects must have had:

Treatments 
Cinacalcet was prepared for oral administration as both capsules for sprinkling and film coated tablets for 
swallowing. Capsules were developed for the investigational clinical program for paediatric subjects and are 
not commercially available. Placebo tablets and capsules were presented in identical dosage form. 
In both the double-blind and open-label phases, subjects received investigational product orally once daily at 
a starting dose of ≤ 0.20 mg/kg based on dry weight, and the dose was titrated upward according to 
plasma iPTH and serum calcium levels and subject safety information every 4 weeks. The maximum dose 
was 4.2 mg/kg, not to exceed a total dose of 180 mg for any subject, the labelled recommended adult 
maximum dose. During the double-blind phase, subjects were randomized to receive cinacalcet or placebo. 
During the open-label phase, all subjects received cinacalcet. 
In the proposed product information, the recommended starting dose is ≤ 0.20 mg/kg. The proposed 
maximum dose is 2.5 mg/kg/day, which is lower than in the study 20070208, 4.2mg/kg/day. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint was defined as achievement of a ≥ 30% reduction from baseline in mean plasma iPTH 
during the EAP. 
Secondary Endpoints were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
achievement of a mean iPTH value ≤ 300 pg/mL (31.8 pmol/L) during the EAP 
percent change in corrected total serum calcium from baseline to the mean value during the EAP 
percent change from in serum phosphorus from baseline to the mean value during the EAP 
percent change in Ca x P from baseline to the mean value during the EAP 
growth velocity calculated from baseline to week 30, and from week 30 to week 60

Sample size 
A completed phase 3 clinical trial in the adult dialysis population revealed that among subjects who had 
baseline iPTH ≥ 300 pg/mL, (31.8 pmol/L), approximately 64% of cinacalcet subjects compared to 13% of 
placebo subjects achieved a ≥ 30% reduction in mean iPTH from baseline during the EAP using the last 
observation carried forward method. A similar difference between treatment arms in proportion of subjects 
achieving such reduction was anticipated in the paediatric dialysis population. The proportions were 
estimated to be 60% and 15% for the cinacalcet and placebo groups respectively. Using a 2-sided Fisher’s 
exact test at an alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 100 (50 per treatment group) would provide 99% power 
to detect the proposed difference. In addition, the study was also sufficiently powered for a smaller treatment 
difference; the power would be 88% if the observed proportions were 45% and 15%, respectively.  
Even though the study was terminated early it was still sufficiently powered. A sample size of 44 (22 per 
treatment group) would provide 82% power to detect the proposed difference (60% for the cinacalcet group 
and 15% for the placebo group) with a 2-sided Fisher’s exact test at an alpha level of 0.05. 
The study was sufficiently powered even though terminated early, however due to the early closure there are 
more patients with incomplete data that will affect the power. 
Randomisation 
Subjects between the ages of 6 to less than 18 years of age who met eligibility requirements for the study 
were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to placebo (control) or cinacalcet (active). 
Randomization was stratified by age group (6 to less than 12 years and 12 to less than 18 years of age at the 
time of randomization.

Statistical methods 
The general statistical hypothesis tested was: 
H0: P cinacalcet = P placebo vs. H1: P cinacalcet ≠ P placebo, 
where P is the proportion of subjects achieving the primary endpoint, H0 is the null hypothesis that the 
proportions are the same in the 2 treatment groups (cinacalcet and placebo), and H1 is the alternative 
hypothesis that there is a difference between the proportions. 
Several analysis sets were defined: 
• 
Full Analysis Set, All randomized subjects with at least 1 post-randomization assessment. 
•  Safety Analysis Set, All randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product. 
• 
• 
Per Protocol Analysis Set, All randomized subjects who completed the protocol without important 
protocol deviations and had at least 1 measurement during the EAP. 
PK/Pharmacodynamic Analyses Set, All subjects with PK data collected at the protocol-specified 
sampling time points.  
•  Completer Set, All subjects who completed 30 weeks of the study or at least 12 weeks of study 
before undergoing kidney transplant. 
•  Open-Label Safety Analysis Set, All subjects who enrolled in the open-label phase and received at 
least 1 dose of investigational product.

No interim analysis was planned. Following a fatality in this study, an unplanned interim analysis was 
performed with a data cutoff of 01 March 2013. The distribution of the unblinded results from the interim 
analysis was limited to representatives from appropriate departments of the cinacalcet paediatric 
development team involved in the analysis of the data. With the exception of 2 principal investigators 
involved in the study design, investigators, site staff, and Amgen representatives interacting with the study 
sites remained blinded. The results of the interim analysis were provided to United States (US) and European 
Union (EU) regulators to aid in their evaluation of the cinacalcet paediatric development program.  
The last observation carried forward method was used in the analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints, except for the secondary efficacy endpoint of growth velocity. For subjects who were missing an 
efficacy measurement during the EAP, the mean of the last 2 available post baseline values in the dose-
titration phase were used. If only 1 post baseline value was available, the single value was used. 
Cochran-Mantel- Haenzel (CMH) test stratified by baseline age group at 2-sided significance level of 0.05 was 
used to analyse the primary endpoint. 
ANCOVA using baseline age group as a covariate or CHM, with multiplicity adjustment using Holm’s method, 
was used for the secondary endpoints. 
Four sensitivity analyses were planned: 
•  Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints based on the per protocol analysis set 
•  Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints using subjects who complete the EAP 
•  Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints using data only from visits (EAP or prior to EAP) where 
subjects are still on IP 
•  Analysis of proportion of subjects achieving a mean iPTH ≤  300 pg/mL (31.8 pmol/L) during the EAP 
based on subjects with screening iPTH value ≥  350 pg/mL (37.1 pmol/L)

Results  
Participant flow  
The most common reason for investigational product discontinuation in the double-blind phase both the 
cinacalcet group (40.9%) and the placebo group (33.3%) was administrative decision due to the early 
termination of the study, followed by kidney transplant (27.3% of subjects in the cinacalcet group and 9.5% 
of subjects in the placebo group). All of these, except one subject in the placebo group, terminated study 
treatment during the month of January 2013 when the partial clinical hold occurred.  Although more subjects 
in the cinacalcet arm were impacted by study termination, it was considered by chance since the decision and 
timing of partial-clinical hold was unrelated to individual subject treatment assignment or outcome.  
The most common reason for investigational product discontinuation in the open-label phase was 
administrative decision due to the early termination of the study (58.3%).

There seems to be an imbalance between treatments in time to discontinuation: 11 (52%) of the placebo 
treated patients were on study at week 28 compared to only 5 (22.7%) of the cinacalcet treated patients. 
Although a numeric imbalance in IP discontinuation was observed between treatment groups, the primary 
reasons for discontinuation (study termination and kidney transplant) were unrelated to treatment received 
or treatment outcomes.

difference are 26.19% (p=0.081) and the modified primary analysis,  which included lab values up to 7 days 
after the partial clinical hold (administrative suspension of investigational product) results in a treatment

Study 20130356  
Final analysis of the study 20130356 was provided as a part of the responses to the Day 120 questions. 
Methods 
This was a phase 3, randomized, multicenter, open-label, controlled study. Cinacalcet was evaluated in 
paediatric subjects between the ages of 6 and < 18 years, with secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) and 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were receiving either haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Subjects were 
randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups; administration of cinacalcet daily in addition to standard of care 
(SOC) treatment group, or a SOC treatment group. Randomization was stratified by age group (6 to < 12 
years and 12 to < 18 years). All subjects received SOC which could include therapy with vitamin D sterols, 
calcium supplementation, and phosphate binders. Subjects randomized to the cinacalcet group received daily 
cinacalcet over weeks 1 to 20. Subjects in both treatment groups who completed the 20-week treatment 
period were eligible to enroll in an open-label extension study (Study 20140159) for further safety follow-up.

Study participants  
This study was conducted at 20 centers in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Germany, Hungary, 
Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Ukraine, and the US. The first subject was enrolled on 07 November 
2014. 
A total of 55 subjects were randomized in the study and are included in this report; 27 in the cinacalcet 
+SOC group and 28 in the SOC group. Two subjects randomized in the cinacalcet + SOC group who did not 
receive investigational product were included in the cinacalcet + SOC group (as randomized) for the full 
analysis set, and in the SOC group (as treated) for the safety analysis set. Subjects who completed at least 
12 weeks of treatment before undergoing renal transplant or parathyroidectomy were considered to have 
completed the study (not discontinued) according to the protocol; 36 subjects (65.5%) completed the study 
(16 cinacalcet + SOC [59.3%], 20 SOC subjects [71.4%]). The primary reason for subjects discontinuation 
was decision by sponsor (6 cinacalcet + SOC subjects [22.2%], 7 SOC subjects [25.0%]), which includes 10 
subjects who discontinued due to study closure on 24 June 2016. Twenty-three subjects (85.2%) in the 
cinacalcet + SOC group (8 subjects between 6 and <12 years and 15 subjects were between 12 and <18 
years) and 26 subjects (92.9%) in the SOC group (9 subjects between 6 and <12 years and 17 subjects 
were between 12 and <18 years) completed at least 12 weeks of the study. 
As of 31 July 2015, a total of 28 subjects were randomized in the study, 13 in the SOC group and 15 in the 
cinacalcet + SOC group. Two subjects who were randomized to the cinacalcet + SOC group did not receive 
investigational product. One of these subjects was randomized and withdrawn from the study on the same 
day (decision by sponsor); this subject was analyzed according to the SOC group in the safety analysis set. 
The second subject was randomized on 29 July 2015, but no investigational product record was entered as of 
the interim analysis data cutoff date 31 July 2015 (investigational product was held per protocol due to 
elevated liver function test results). This subject remained in the study and was analyzed in the cinacalcet + 
SOC group.  
Treatments 
The protocol specified doses for use in this study were: 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 mg. The 
maximum dose of cinacalcet administered at any time during the study was 2.5 mg/kg/day based on the 
subject’s dry weight measured at the screening week-2 visit or 180 mg daily, whichever was lower. 
Capsules: Each capsule contained 5 mg of cinacalcet 
Tablets were provided in a strength of 30 mg. 
Standard of care therapy included the use of vitamin D sterols, calcium supplementation, and phosphate 
binders. 
On day 1, the subject’s ionized calcium had to be at or above threshold of ≥ 1.05 mmol/L prior to initiation of 
treatment. The initial dose of cinacalcet was 0.20 mg/kg/day, and dose adjustments for subjects receiving 
cinacalcet were assessed at each weekly visit during the treatment period. The daily dose of cinacalcet was 
only increased at monthly titration visits (week 4, 8, 12, or 16) based on iPTH, corrected calcium levels, 
ionized calcium and subject safety information. At all weekly visits (including week 4, 8, 12, and 16), the 
dose was maintained, reduced or withheld based upon the specified criteria.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint is proportion of subjects who achieve a ≥ 30% reduction from baseline in mean plasma 
iPTH during the efficacy assessment period (EAP), defined as weeks 17 to 20 
Secondary endpoints are: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
proportion of subjects who achieve a mean iPTH ≤ 300 pg/mL (31.8 pmol/L) during the weeks 17 to 
20 
percent change in iPTH from baseline to the mean value during the weeks 17 to 20 
change in corrected total serum calcium from baseline to the mean value during weeks 17 to 20 
change in serum phosphorus from baseline to the mean value during weeks 17 to 20 
Sample size 
Using the Fisher’s exact test at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 48 (24 per treatment group) 
would provide 80% power to detect a difference of 42% in this endpoint (assuming response rates of 62% 
and 20% in cinacalcet and standard-of-care group, respectively). 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized by the interactive voice response (IVR) / interactive web response (IWR) system 
in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the following 2 treatment groups, administration of cinacalcet daily in addition to SOC 
therapy or SOC therapy. Randomization was stratified by age group (6 to < 12 and 12 to < 18 years of age). 
Statistical methods 
The general statistical hypothesis to be tested is: 
H0: P cinacalcet + SOC = P SOC vs H1: P cinacalcet ≠ P SOC 
where P is the proportion of subjects achieving the primary endpoint, H0 is the null hypothesis that the 
proportions are the same in the two treatment groups (cinacalcet and SOC), and H1 is the alternative 
hypothesis that there is a difference between the proportions. The comparison of the proportion of subjects 
achieving the primary endpoint between treatment groups was planned to be performed applying the 
Haybittle-Peto boundary (α = 0.001) to preserve the overall Type 1 error rate. However, due to the limited 
available data, this analysis was not performed. The final analysis will be performed at α = 0.05. 
Analysis sets defined are the Full Analysis Set (FAS) used for the primary and secondary endpoints. The FAS 
includes all randomized subjects. Each subject will be analysed according to the treatment group to which 
they are randomized. The Completer Set includes all subjects who complete 20 weeks of the study or 
complete at least 12 weeks of the study before undergoing kidney transplant. The Per Protocol Set (PP) is 
defined as all randomized subjects who completed the protocol without key important protocol deviations 
(IPDs) or non-compliance.  
The comparison of the proportion of subjects achieving the primary endpoint between the two treatment 
groups will be performed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by baseline age group (6 -
<12 years old or 12 -<18 years old) as determined at randomization. For subjects who do not have a iPTH 
value during the EAP, the mean of the last two available post-baseline values collected at protocol-specified 
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017 
Page 46/103 
 
 
  
  
visits in the dose-titration phase will be used. If only one post-baseline value is available, this single value 
will be used. If no post-baseline value is available, the subject in considered a non-responder. 
A hierarchical testing procedure will be used to test the primary and biochemical secondary endpoints. The 
primary endpoint will be tested at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. The four secondary endpoints will be 
tested using Holm’s method (Holm’s 1979) at 0.05 (2-sided) should the primary endpoint achieve a 
significant result. The overall family-wise type 1 error among the primary and secondary endpoints is 
controlled at 0.05 by using the above testing procedure. 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed for primary and secondary endpoints using the following the completer 
set and per protocol set.

Baseline data 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 55 subjects were randomized in the study, 27 in the cinacalcet + SOC group and 28 in the SOC 
group. Two subjects who were randomized to the cinacalcet + SOC group but did not receive investigational 
product were included in the cinacalcet + SOC group (as randomized) for the full analysis set, and were 
included in the SOC group (as treated) for the safety analysis set. 
The number of patients included in the per protocol analysis set were 13 in the cinacalcet + SOC group and 
25 in the SOC group. The completer set consisted of 35 patients, 15 in the cinacalcet + SOC group and 20 in 
the SOC group. It should be noted that there is a high rate of exclusion from the Cinacalcet + SOC treatment 
arm compared to the SOC treatment arm in the PP analysis set. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The proportion of subjects achieving ≥ 30% reduction from baseline in mean plasma iPTH during weeks 17 to 
20 was 22.2% (6 of 27 subjects) in the cinacalcet + SOC group and 32.1% (9 of 28 subjects) in the SOC 
group (p =0.42, stratified by age); the difference ([cinacalcet + SOC] – [SOC]) in the proportions was -9.9%

(95% confidence interval [CI] -33.3%, 13.4%) (Table 10-1). A summary of the median percent change in 
iPTH from baseline at scheduled visits, by treatment group, is provided in Figure 10-1.   
The primary endpoints did not achieve statistical significance; therefore, as pre-specified, the secondary 
endpoints were not statistically tested.  Results of the secondary endpoints also did not show clear treatment 
effects of cinacalcet on PTH, serum calcium, or serum phosphorus.  Results for the primary and secondary 
endpoints are listed below; nominal p-values are presented without multiplicity adjustment.

Growth velocity was an exploratory endpoint for this study.  The mean (95% CI) estimated growth velocity 
from baseline to week 20 was 3.67 (1.16, 6.18) cm/year for subjects in the cinacalcet + SOC group and 3.42 
(1.20, 5.65) cm/year for subjects in the SOC group.  Growth velocity was not significantly different between 
treatment groups (p = 0.88), after adjusting for age. 
The mean (SD) duration of exposure in the cinacalcet + SOC group was 112.8 (41.0) days.  The mean (SD) 
actual weight adjusted daily dose of cinacalcet taken was 0.398 (0.467) mg/kg/day during weeks 17 to 20.  
The mean (SD) maximum actual weight-adjusted daily dose was 0.55 (0.484) mg/kg/day.   
Dosing rules based on weekly assessments of calcium using protocol specified ionized calcium thresholds 
resulted in a high rate of dose interruptions and dose reductions that precluded dose titration to achieve 
adequate cinacalcet exposure and iPTH reduction in most subjects. Dose reduction and interruptions occurred 
even in situations where the corrected serum calcium value would have allowed dose maintenance or 
increase. During the entire treatment period, 23 of 25 subjects (92.0%) had ≥  1 dose withheld or reduced, 
and 19 of 25 subjects (76.0%) had ≥  1 dose of cinacalcet withheld.  Reasons for dose withholding included: 
per protocol (11 subjects [44.0%]), noncompliance (10 subjects [40.0%]), and adverse event (6 subjects 
[24.0%], and other (4 subjects [16.0%]). 
Upon investigation of the reason for the lower than expected efficacy of cinacalcet, it was noted that the 
mean dose of cinacalcet during the EAP in Study 20130356 was approximately 80% lower than the mean 
dose during the EAP in Study 20070208. 
In the day 120 LoQ, the MAH was asked to clarify if criteria for dose adjustments in study 20130356 were 
similar to the recommendations proposed in the SmPC section 4.2 for paediatric patients and discuss any 
possible differences.

Dose increases and dose reductions/withholding were managed in Study 20130356 using protocol-specified 
criteria.  In this study, dose adjustments and withholding were based on plasma intact parathyroid hormone 
(iPTH), ionized calcium and corrected serum calcium levels, and the subject’s safety status.  Dose increases 
were allowed every 4 weeks.  The dose was increased if the plasma iPTH was ≥ 300 pg/mL, provided the 
subject did not meet any criteria for dose maintenance, dose reduction, or dose withholding, there was no 
evidence of noncompliance, and the subject had not reached the maximum allowed dose.  If cinacalcet 
treatment had been stopped for more than 14 days, the protocol required that subjects restart treatment at 
the recommended starting dose. 
Study 20090198  
Study 20090198 was a multicentre, retrospective, observational chart review. 
A total of 23 paediatric subjects were identified for retrospective collection of data for this study. Medical 
charts were reviewed in an effort to describe changes in biochemical markers and the occurrence of safety 
events in children from birth to < 6 years of age with secondary HPT and CKD receiving dialysis who were 
treated off label with cinacalcet. 
Data collection for these subjects was discontinued for the following reasons: cinacalcet use was terminated 
(8 subjects), kidney transplant (6 subjects), the data collection period ended (7 subjects), or for other 
reasons (2 subjects). The reasons for terminating cinacalcet use were the following: administrative decision 
(4 subjects), death (2 subjects), noncompliance (1 subject), or adverse drug reaction (1 subject).  
The primary objective of the study was to describe changes in biochemical markers (intact PTH [iPTH], 
calcium, and phosphorus concentrations) in paediatric subjects with CKD and secondary HPT on dialysis 
following initiation of cinacalcet treatment. 
Other objectives of the study included: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To describe the safety and tolerability of cinacalcet. 
To describe the method of administration of cinacalcet (e.g., crushing or splitting of tablets), route, 
dose, and frequency. 
To describe the use of other medications (e.g., vitamin D sterols, phosphate binders, 1,25 
dihydroxyvitamin D, growth hormone, erythropoietin). 
To describe markers of bone turnover and bone mineral density if available. 
Methods 
Data were obtained from subject medical charts from paediatric nephrologists in hospital and community-
based practices, as well as dialysis centers registered in various existing networks. This study consisted of 
retrospective data collection both prior to initiating treatment with cinacalcet (baseline) and after initiating 
treatment with cinacalcet (treatment) in all subjects.  
For the estimation of biochemical parameters, data obtained prior to initiating treatment (baseline) and 1, 2, 
and 3 months after initiating treatment with cinacalcet, if available, were collected. Time points were

approximate. Acceptable variation was ± 2 weeks for the month 1, 2, and 3 time point. Additional data of 
interest (e.g., biochemical parameters) were collected beyond 3 months after initiation of treatment with 
cinacalcet for as long as the subject continued to receive treatment and was < 6 years of age. 
To identify possible adverse drug reactions to cinacalcet, retrospective record review for safety data 
continued for as long as the subject continued to receive treatment with cinacalcet and was ≤ 7 years of age.  
Baseline data collection/abstraction included demographics and medical and surgical history. In addition, the 
following data were abstracted from subject medical charts for baseline and during the period of treatment 
with cinacalcet: weight, height or length, Tanner stage, vital signs, medical and surgical history, kidney 
transplant status, hospitalizations, medication use, biochemistry (e.g., iPTH, calcium, and phosphorus).  
During the treatment period, cinacalcet use (dose, frequency, route, and method of administration) was 
recorded. 
Number of Subjects Included in Study: 23 
Sex: 14 males, 9 females 
Age: Mean age (SD), 32.6 months (15.1) 
The youngest subject recruited and evaluated in any of the clinical trials was 7 months old.  
Ethnicity (Race): 13 white or Caucasian, 4 black or African Americans, 6 other 
Main criteria for inclusion: 
•  Diagnosed with CKD requiring maintenance dialysis (peritoneal or hemodialysis). 
•  Diagnosed with secondary HPT. 
• 
Treated with at least 1 dose of cinacalcet at any time prior to 31 August 2009. 
•  Age from birth to < 6 years at the time treatment with cinacalcet was initiated. 
Statistical Methods: 
The distribution for key variables such as laboratory parameters and cinacalcet dosing were evaluated for 
outliers and missing data. Queries were generated for obvious spurious values and inconsistent data. Owing 
to the retrospective and observational nature of this study, it was anticipated that there would be missing 
data. No imputation of missing data was carried out. 
The following estimates and 95% CIs were provided to address the study primary objectives. All subjects who 
had at least 1 post-baseline measurement of the respective biomarker were included in the analysis of that 
time point: 
• 
•

• 
Percent change in iPTH concentration from baseline to month 1, 2, and 3. 
Proportion of subjects who achieved ≥ 30% reduction in iPTH concentration from baseline to month 
1, 2, and 3. 
Percent change in serum calcium concentration from baseline to month 1, 2, and 3. 
Percent change in phosphorous from baseline to month 1, 2, and 3.

Results 
Subject Characteristics: 
Fifteen study centers identified retrospectively collected data from 23 paediatric subjects who met the 
eligibility criteria. Data collection for these subjects was discontinued for the following reasons: cinacalcet use 
was terminated (8 subjects), kidney transplant (6 subjects), the data collection period ended (7 subjects), or 
for other reasons (2 subjects). The reasons for terminating cinacalcet use were the following: administrative 
decision (4 subjects), death (2 subjects), noncompliance (1 subject), or adverse drug reaction (1 subject).  
The mean (SD) weight and height of subjects at baseline was 12.6 (4.5) kg and 83.3 (11.7) cm, respectively.  
Baseline comorbid conditions that occurred in ≥ 10% of subjects were growth retardation (65%), failure to 
thrive (43%), hypertension (39%), vision impairment (22%), respiratory disease other than asthma and 
cystic fibrosis (17%), fracture (17%), liver disease (13%), other gastrointestinal disease (13%), other 
musculoskeletal (13%).  
All 23 enrolled subjects had CKD; 4 subjects had a history of kidney transplant. 
At baseline, 19 (83%) subjects were receiving peritoneal dialysis and 3 (13%) subjects were receiving 
haemodialysis. The mean duration from initiation of dialysis to initiation of cinacalcet treatment was 19.47 
months.  
The mean (SD) iPTH concentration was 1380.7 (800.0) pg/mL indicating inadequately controlled secondary 
HPT at baseline. Mean serum calcium concentration was within normal limits (i.e., 8.9 to 10.3 mg/dL). 
Dose Administration 
Fifteen of the 23 enrolled subjects were administered cinacalcet orally. Nineteen subjects received their 
medication as a crushed tablet; 7 subjects were administered cinacalcet by nasogastric (NG) tube. 
The mean (SD) duration of exposure was 274.17 (245.53) days, with a minimum exposure of 34 days and a 
maximum of 1036 days.  
The median (min, max) initial weight-adjusted daily dose was 0.61 (0.1, 1.9) mg/kg/day. The median (min, 
max) maximum weight-adjusted daily dose over the course of treatment was 1.40 (0.4, 5.6) mg/kg/day. 
Seventeen of 23 (74%) subjects had at least 3 months of cinacalcet treatment. A review of dose 
administration by individual subject showed variable dosing regimens with doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 60 
mg. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Cinacalcet treatment was assessed by the changes in biomarkers indicative of secondary HPT. 
Biochemical indices were collected at monthly intervals. Height and weight measurements were also collected 
monthly. 
The Research Project Plan (RPP) for this study targeted changes in biomarkers over a 3-month period; 
however, data were available for most subjects beyond 3 months. Summary statistics for the group were 
generated if the number of subjects with data was greater than 5 at any time point.

Intact Parathyroid Hormone (iPTH) 
Intact PTH is summarized for all 23 enrolled subjects by mean changes from baseline, mean percent changes 
from baseline, and the proportion of subjects with ≥ 30% reduction from baseline. One subject 
(19848001001) had a low baseline iPTH value (101.8 pg/mL). Upon query by the sponsor, the site confirmed 
that the sample had been collected prior to initiation of cinacalcet and further, that the baseline sample had 
been possibly diluted 10-fold. The subject’s iPTH values were 1201.9 pg/mL and 1398.0 pg/mL at Month 1 
and Month 3, respectively. 
Because the reliability of the baseline value for this subject was uncertain, summaries of iPTH results 
excluding data from this subject were also provided. 
Mean Change from Baseline in iPTH 
Mean (SD) iPTH concentrations ranged from 1312.3 (612.9) pg/mL at month 1 to 562.4 (478.2) pg/mL at 
month 6. Mean iPTH concentrations decreased from baseline at every time point except month 4. The mean 
(SD) decreases ranged from -86.8 (815.9) pg/mL at month 1 to -743.8 (910.1) pg/mL at month 6.  
A mean increase over baseline of 90.7 (1011.2) pg/mL was observed at month 4. The exclusion of data from 
Subject 19848001001 resulted in greater mean decreases from baseline at month 1 (-156.6 pg/mL), month 
3 (-634.4 pg/mL), month 5 (-400.2 pg/mL), and month 6 (-1056.0 pg/mL). Mean changes from baseline at 
months 2, 4, and 7 were the same in both datasets.

Serum Calcium 
Total and ionized calcium were assessed by mean changes from baseline and mean percent changes from 
baseline. 
Total Calcium 
Mean (SD) calcium concentrations ranged from 8.72 (1.11) mg/dL at month 1 to 9.76 (1.13) at month 2. 
Mean decreases from baseline in total calcium were observed at every time point except month 2. The largest 
mean (SD) decreases from baseline were -0.59 (0.83) mg/dL observed at month 1 and -0.61 (0.72) mg/dL 
observed at month 5. The mean (SD) percent decreases from baseline at these same time points were -
6.45% (8.98%) and -6.23% (6.91%), respectively. In general, mean serum calcium concentrations remained 
within normal limits during treatment (i.e., 8.9 to 10.3 mg/dL). 
Corrected calcium values were available for 4 subjects only; therefore, summary statistics are not provided.

Ionized Calcium 
Ionized calcium data were available for 8 subjects. 
Mean (SD) changes from baseline in ionized calcium were observed at every time point, ranging from a 
decrease of -0.15 (0.15) mg/dL at month 1 to an increase of 1.57 (2.83) mg/dL at month 2. By month 3, 
mean concentrations were approaching baseline levels. The mean (SD) percent change from baseline at 
month 2 was 34.97% (65.36%).  
Intact PTH, Calcium, and Ionized Calcium Data through 17 Months 
One subject (19848001001) had iPTH, calcium and ionized calcium data available through 17 months.

Phosphorus 
Phosphorus was assessed by mean changes from baseline and mean percent changes from baseline. 
Mean decreases from baseline in phosphorus were observed at every time point. The largest mean (SD) 
decrease from baseline was -1.48 (2.32) mg/dL observed at month 2. The mean (SD) percent decrease from 
baseline at this same time point was -20.79% (30.52%).  
Mean percent increases from baseline were observed at month 1, month 5, month 6, and month 7, which 
was inconsistent with the mean decreases from baseline observed at these time points. This difference is 
likely the result of substantial increases over baseline for 2 subjects (19826003001 and 19866012001). In 
general, mean serum phosphorus concentrations remained within normal limits during treatment (i.e., 4.5 to 
8.0 mg/dL). 
Creatinine 
Mean creatinine concentrations remained relatively unchanged over baseline at month 1 and month 2. 
Thereafter, mean (SD) increases from baseline were observed at all time points, ranging from 0.15 (1.76) 
mg/dL at month 3 to 2.06 (1.89) mg/dL at month 7. Mean (SD) percent increases over baseline ranged from 
8.09% (33.35%) at month 3 to 53.14% (62.39%) at month 7.  
Hemoglobin 
Mean (SD) decreases from baseline in hemoglobin concentrations were observed at months 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 
ranging from -0.06 (2.17) g/dL at month 6 to -0.79 (2.36) g/dL at month 4. 
Biochemical Markers for Bone Turnover 
Bone biomarker measurements were only recorded in medical charts for 2 subjects: osteocalcin concentration 
in 1 subject (3 records) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentration in 1 subject (2 records). 
Radiographic Evaluation of Bone Mineral Density 
Radiographic assessment of bone was not recorded in any of the subject medical charts. 
Weight 
Mean changes from baseline in weight were observed at every time point except month 3. The largest mean 
(SD) change in weight of -0.8 (1.1) kg was observed at month 4. The mean (SD) weight at baseline was 12.6 
(4.5) kg. 
Mean height (length) increased from baseline at every time point. By month 3, mean (SD) height increased 
over baseline by 3.2 (3.5) cm. The mean (SD) height at baseline was 83.3 (11.7) cm 
MAH Conclusions: This chart review showed that cinacalcet in a mean dose range of 0.81 to1.87 mg/kg/day 
(SD 0.54-1.30) used in children < 6 years of age with CKD and secondary HPT had expected effects on 
biochemical markers of secondary HPT. 
In summary, the study 20090198 was a retrospective, observational chart review in 23 paediatric subjects 
from birth to < 6 years of age (mean age 32.6 months). The subjects received Cinacalcet off-label. The mean 
baseline iPTH concentration was 1380.7 pg/mL indicating inadequately controlled secondary HPT, however, 
baseline total serum calcium concentrations were within normal limits.

Nineteen subjects received their medication as a crushed tablet; 7 subjects were administered cinacalcet by 
nasogastric (NG) tube. 
Both dose strength and frequency of administration varied among subjects. The median (min, max) 
maximum weight-adjusted daily dose over the course of treatment was 1.40 (0.4, 5.6) mg/kg/day (the 
currently proposed paediatric max dose is 2.5 mg/kg/day.  
Mean iPTH concentrations generally decreased and ranged from 1312.3 (612.9) pg/mL at month 1 to 562.4 
(478.2) pg/mL at month 6. About half of the subjects had iPTH value at month 6. 
Mean decreases from baseline in total calcium were observed. The largest mean (SD) decreases from 
baseline were -0.59 (0.83) mg/dL observed at month 1 and -0.61 (0.72) mg/dL observed at month 5. 
In general, mean serum phosphorus concentrations remained within normal limits during treatment (i.e., 4.5 
to 8.0 mg/dL). 
Although a research plan was developed prospectively for this chart review, this review shares similar 
limitations to other retrospective observational analyses, i.e., propensity for missing data, accuracy and 
completeness of data quality, and chart selection determination. Consequently, no firm conclusions of efficacy 
in patients < 6 years can be drawn. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
Bayesian Extrapolation Study 
Methods  
An extrapolation analysis was implemented to leverage data from cinacalcet studies in adults to support the 
data from paediatric subjects.  This approach was justified for the cinacalcet paediatric program since 
important principles of extrapolation defined by the European Medicines Agency (EMA, 2013) (i.e., similarities 
in disease progression, response to treatment, and concentration-response between the source and target 
populations) were met and the feasibility of conducting large studies in the target population was restricted 
(EMA, 2013; Dunne et al, 2011; Manolis and Pons, 2009). 
The Bayesian extrapolation study that was submitted with the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) 
used data from paediatric Study 20070208 (N = 43) and pooled data from adult Studies 20000172, 
20000183, and 20000188 (N = 1136) to make inferences on the treatment effect of cinacalcet on intact 
parathyroid hormone (iPTH).  Interim analysis data from paediatric Study 20130356 (N = 28) was also 
included to make inferences on the treatment effect of cinacalcet on corrected calcium (cCa) in paediatric 
subjects.  This analysis (submitted with the MAA) is referred to as the original Bayesian analysis throughout 
this response.   
As requested and agreed upon in the Day 120 clarification meeting (D120 Clarification Meeting Minutes), the 
original Bayesian analysis has been repeated for both efficacy and safety endpoints to include all available 
paediatric data, including the final data from Studies 20070208, 20130356 and 20110100, and interim data 
from Study 20140159 (data cutoff date 29 April 2016).  The efficacy results from the repeated Bayesian

analyses are provided below.  This analysis (the repeated efficacy and safety endpoints with all available 
paediatric data) is referred to as the repeated Bayesian analysis.   
The efficacy endpoints for this extrapolation study were the following: 
• 
• 
achievement of a ≥  30% reduction from baseline in mean plasma iPTH during the EAP 
percent change in plasma iPTH from baseline during the study 
In the Bayesian analysis of the efficacy endpoints, data from adult studies were used to derive the prior 
distributions and paediatric data from Study 20070208 were used as the likelihood.  The binary efficacy 
endpoint, achievement of a ≥ 30% reduction from baseline in mean plasma iPTH during the EAP, was fitted 
by a Bayesian binomial model and the posterior median and the 95% posterior credible interval of the 
response rate were provided.  A 30% difference in response rates for efficacy (where response was defined 
as achievement of a ≥ 30% reduction from baseline in mean plasma iPTH during the EAP) between the 
placebo and cinacalcet groups were considered a clinically meaningful treatment effect size.  The Bayesian 
inference on the response rate for efficacy was based on the posterior probabilities that the true response 
rate difference was greater than the assumed effect size π = 30% and π = 0%.  For the primary analysis, a 
weight of 5% was applied to the adult data to balance the adult and paediatric contributions; other weights 
were used as sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the prior assumptions. 
Data for the binary response efficacy endpoint (achievement of a ≥ 30% reduction from baseline in mean 
plasma iPTH during the EAP) from the pooled adult studies and all available paediatric data, including the 
final data from Studies 20070208, 20130356, 20110100 and interim data from Study 20140159, are 
summarized in Table 1.

The results from the Bayesian extrapolation analysis of the longitudinal model for the percent change in iPTH 
over time supported the results for the binary endpoint in the extrapolation study.  The percent change from 
baseline iPTH for the cinacalcet group had a decreasing trend in the first 12 weeks and then became stable, 
whereas a slightly increasing trend for the placebo group was observed over the entire study period. 
Supportive studies  
Study 20110100 
A phase 2, open-label, single-arm study to assess the safety and tolerability of cinacalcet in addition to 
standard of care (SOC) in paediatric subjects age 28 days to < 6 years with CKD and secondary HPT 
receiving dialysis. 
Primary Endpoint: 
 Proportion of subjects who develop corrected serum calcium levels < 9.0 mg/dL (2.25 mmol/L) for ages 28 
days to < 2 years, and < 8.4 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) for ages ≥ 2 to < 6 years  
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Proportion of subjects who develop corrected serum calcium levels < 8.8 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L) during the 
study  
• PK parameters at week 12 (e.g., maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), 
apparent clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (V/F))  
• The percent change of plasma intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), corrected total serum calcium, serum 
phosphorous, and Ca x P from baseline to scheduled visits during the study

• Proportion of subjects who have any decreases in iPTH of > 30% from baseline at two consecutive 
measurements  
• Achievement of ≥ 30% reduction from baseline in plasma iPTH during the study  
• Proportion of subjects who have any normal iPTH values between 200 and 300 pg/mL at two consecutive 
measurements  
• Achievement of plasma iPTH values < 300 pg/mL (31.8 pmol/L) during the study  
Safety Endpoints:  
• Nature, frequency, severity, and relationship to treatment of all adverse events, including those of special 
interest (including hypocalcemia, seizures, and infections), reported during the study  
• Subject incidence of hypocalcemia throughout the study  
• Changes in laboratory parameters, including clinical chemistry, at scheduled visits  
• Changes in vital signs at scheduled visits  
• Electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
Subjects will remain on study for 26 weeks or until time of kidney transplantation, whichever comes first. All 
subjects, in addition to receiving cinacalcet, will receive standard of care, which may include vitamin D sterols 
(25 OH vitamin D and/or 1,25 OH vitamin D and its analogs).  
Subjects who complete the 26-week study may be eligible to participate in an extension study (Study 
20140159). 
Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria: Subjects between the ages of 28 days to < 6 years of age, who 
have CKD and SHPT undergoing either HD or PD at the time of screening (subjects 6 months or older should 
have been receiving dialysis for ≥ 1 month).  
Eligible subjects must have:  
• Screening plasma iPTH level > 300 pg/mL (31.8 pmol/L) from the central laboratory, and not have received 
any cinacalcet therapy for at least 30 days prior to start of dosing  
• Screening corrected calcium from the central laboratory:  
o ≥ 9.4 mg/dL (2.35 mmol/L) if age 28 days to < 2 years  
o ≥ 8.8 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L) if age ≥ 2 to < 6 years  
• Serum phosphorus from the central laboratory:  
o ≥ 5.0 mg/dL (1.25 mmol/L) if age 28 days to < 1 year  
o ≥ 4.5 mg/dL (1.13 mmol/L) if age ≥ 1 to < 6 years  
• SHPT not due to vitamin D deficiency, per investigator assessment  
Statistical Considerations: There is no formal statistical testing for this study. The analysis for the primary 
and secondary endpoints will be descriptive in nature. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize data for continuous variables (including n, mean, standard 
deviation (SD) or standard error (SE), median, 25th (Q1) and 75th (Q3) percentiles, minimum and maximum 
values, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), where applicable). For categorical variables, the

number and percentage of subjects in each category will be reported. Results are presented overall and 
separately for subjects enrolled before (cohort 1) and after (cohort 2) the partial clinical hold. 
Results 
A total of 18 subjects were enrolled into the study: 8 before the partial clinical hold (cohort 1), and 10 after 
the partial clinical hold (cohort 2). One subject in cohort 1 did not receive cinacalcet; all other subjects 
received at least 1 dose and were included in the Safety Analysis Set. Eleven subjects overall (61.1%); 
37.5% in cohort 1, and 80.0% in cohort 2; completed at least 12 weeks of treatment. Four subjects (22.2% 
overall, 2 in each cohort) completed the study: 3 completed 26 weeks, and 1(cohort 1) completed 12 weeks, 
which was followed by a kidney transplant. Fourteen subjects (77.8%) discontinued the study. The most 
common reason for discontinuation was administrative decision, which was due to a partial clinical hold in 
2013 for cohort 1 (4 subjects) and study closure in June 2016 for cohort 2 (5 subjects). 
Demographics: 66.7% of the included subjects were boys and 33.3% girls. The mean age was 35.9 
months. Three subjects (16.7%) were within the age range of 28 days to < 2 years, and 15 subjects (83.3%) 
were within the age range of 2 years to < 6 years. 83.3% were white, 11.1% black and 5.6% other. 
Efficacy 
For the primary endpoint, no subjects had corrected serum calcium level that met the primary endpoint of a 
corrected serum calcium of < 9.0 mg/dL (2.25 mmol/L) for ages 28 days to < 2 years, and < 8.4 mg/dL (2.1 
mmol/L) for ages ≥ 2 years to < 6 years during the study. 
Results from relevant secondary efficacy endpoints are below: 
•  A higher proportion of subjects in cohort 1 (100.0%) than in cohort 2 (50.0%) achieved ≥ 30% 
reduction in iPTH. All subjects who completed the study (4 subjects: 2 subjects each per cohort) 
achieved this threshold of response. 
•  Overall, 8 subjects (47.1%, cohort 1: 57.1%, cohort 2: 40.0%) achieved > 30% reduction in iPTH 
from baseline for 2 consecutive measurements; all 4 subjects who completed the study also met this 
response threshold for 2 consecutive measurements. 
•  One subject (5.9% overall) achieved plasma iPTH values between 200 and 300 pg/mL (21.2 and 31.8 
pmol/L) at any 2 consecutive measurements. Of the subjects in the Full Analysis Set, 52.9% had 
achieved an iPTH value < 300 pg/mL during the study, and the proportion of subjects achieving this 
threshold value was similar between cohorts (cohort 1: 57.1% and cohort 2: 50.0%). Three of the 4 
subjects (75.0% overall, cohort 1: 50.0% and cohort 2: 100.0%) who completed the study achieved 
iPTH values < 300 pg/mL. 
• 
• 
Percent change of corrected serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and calcium phosphorus product (Ca 
x P): Increases in mean percent change in corrected serum calcium levels over time were noted 
overall (range: -0.10% to 5.88%). Cohort 1 generally had decreases in mean percent changes in 
corrected serum calcium values (range: -6.86% to 1.94%) compared to baseline whereas cohort 2 
generally had increases in mean percent changes in corrected serum calcium values compared to 
baseline (range: -0.49% to 5.88%). 
For serum phosphorus and Ca x P, initial decreases from baseline were observed. At week 11 and 
later time points, trends were difficult to observe.

concerns across the subject population. 
−  No clinically relevant differences in the incidences of adverse events of interest were observed for 
subjects who previously received cinacalcet in the parent study (Study 20130356 cinacalcet + SOC 
group) compared with subjects initiating cinacalcet in the current study (Study 20130356 SOC 
group). 
−  No unexpected safety concerns were revealed in subjects who previously received cinacalcet in the 
parent study compared with subjects initiating cinacalcet in the current study.

•  A high degree of intersubject variability was observed in laboratory parameters associated with CKD-
MBD, regardless of previous exposure to cinacalcet in the parent study.   
•  Weekly assessments of calcium using protocol-specified ionized calcium thresholds to guide dose 
adjustment and withholding precluded dose titration to achieve the target iPTH reduction in the majority 
of subjects.  
2.6.6.  Discussion and conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Two controlled phase 3 studies were performed in paediatric subjects 6 to 18 years. Both trials were 
conducted in accordance with the PDCO. Both were terminated early, first due to a fatality in the study and 
the second due to difficulties in recruitment.  
The first study 2007208 showed trend to positive efficacy results:  A total of 5 out of 21 (24%) of the placebo 
patients and 11 out of 22 (50%) of Cinacalcet treated patients reached the primary endpoint (p= 0.08), 
which was the number of patients achieving ≥30% reduction in mean iPTH from baseline to the efficacy 
assessment phase. When iPTH values collected after investigational product suspension were excluded, the 
corresponding numbers presented were 4 out of 21 (19%) in placebo and 12 out of 22 (55%) in Cinacalcet 
treated patients, p=0.017. 
The statistical methods are overall adequate for the study design and endpoints, however adequate 
sensitivity analyses of the dichotomized response endpoint using different single imputation methods (LOCF 
for some subjects and BOCF for the other) was requested. Since more subjects in the cinacalcet arm 
discontinued due to study termination and kidney transplant which were unrelated to treatment outcome, 
using BOCF regardless of reasons will introduce bias against the cinacalcet arm and the approach will 
generate an over-conservative estimate or treatment effect. The results from all imputation strategies were 
all directionally consistent with the primary analysis.   
The results of the analyses of PTH changes over time based on linear mixed models and different 
assumptions for handling missing values are directionally consistent with the results of the primary analysis. 
The variability is substantial; while the mean difference in percent change from BL to EAP is ─19, the 
confidence interval is very broad and it cannot be excluded that the mean change in the placebo group is 
larger by more than 50% (interpreting the upper bound of the 95% CI). The results are therefore 
inconclusive.

Due to relatively short duration of the drug exposure and low number of 
evaluable subjects no conclusions regarding the impact of cinacalcet could 
be drawn on the following other efficacy endpoints:  bone biomarkers, 
growth velocity, Tanner stage, percent change in bone mineral density, 
testosterone levels. 
Notes 
The final results from study 20130356 showed that the efficacy was less than expected, and this has an 
impact on the benefit-risk assessment. 
In Study 20070208 a higher allowed maximum daily dose of 4.2 mg/kg was suggested. The maximum daily 
dose was 2.5 mg/kg in Study 20130356. The latter failed to meet its primary endpoint. The Applicant was 
asked to clarify the actual maximum doses mg/kg given in these studies and to discuss in how far limitation 
of the maximum daily dose could have had an influence on study outcomes: 
The mean of the actual maximum weight adjusted daily dose of cinacalcet was 0.99 mg/kg/day in Study 
20070208 and 0.69 mg/kg/day in Study 20130356.   
In Study 20070208, only 1 subject received a dose above 2.5 mg/kg/day, the maximum allowed daily dose 
for Study 20130356; while in Study 20130356, no subject received the maximum allowable daily dose of 2.5 
mg/kg/day. 
The CHMP therefore concurs with the MAH that differences in the protocol-specified maximum dose per se in 
the 2 studies did not explain the different doses used. The lower than expected dose used in Study 20130356 
may have resulted from changes in the dosing algorithm used in this study and not due to a need for dose 
titration to doses higher than the protocol-specified maximum dose. The MAH has provided information on 
the weight adjusted daily dose in Mimpara exposed subjects compared to placebo in study 20070208. 
Starting from week 16, the actual exposure to placebo is higher compared to cinacalcet for the rest of the 
dose titration period and EAP.

The treatment success (>30% reduction from baseline in mean IPTH during EAP) was achieved by 54% of 
subjects group in study 20070208. The mean differences are directionally consistent with the primary 
analysis for the study, which was based on the dichotomized response endpoint of PTH reduction of > 30% 
from baseline. 
Individual patients’ data show that there is no substantial difference between the two treatment groups over 
the time. Consequently, it is not possible to make a clear statement that the iPTH reduction is in favor for 
cinacalcet arm.  
In Study 20130356, no clinically relevant changes in iPTH from baseline over time were observed for subjects 
who received cinacalcet + SOC compared with subjects who received SOC alone. These findings were 
consistent with primary analysis for this study. Additionally it should be noted that the difference in mean 
change during the EAP points towards a favorable effect of SOC.   
Although the ‘treat-to target’ approach (PTH: 100-300 pg/mL) appears to be a meaningful concept in 
general, in study 20070208 it is very difficult to recognize any trends in favor of the cinacalcet arm. This does 
not significantly improve in the long run. A related drawback is the fact that in the study 20070208 a greater 
proportion of cinacalcet-treated patients had at least one PTH level that fell below 100 pg/mL compared to 
placebo treated subjects. These results are expected due to the effects of calcimimetics to lower PTH. In 
contrast, in the Study 20130356, the additional dose adoptions rules (Cinacalcet treatment regimen was 
lower and the decision criteria for dose titration were modified) probably protect against the event to fall 
below 100 pg/mL (2 subjects in the cinacalcet + SOC group versus 4 subjects in the SOC group). As seen 
from the provided analysis no clinical relevant changes in iPTH from baseline over the time were observed. 
In the day 120 LoI, the MAH was asked to clarify if criteria for dose adjustments in study 20130356 are 
similar to the recommendations proposed in the SmPC section 4.2 for paediatric patients and discuss any 
possible differences. 
The MAH has clarified the criteria for dose adjustments in study 20130356 and provided a rationale for 
differences compared to the recommendations proposed in the SmPC section 4.2 for paediatric patients. The 
optimal wording in SmPC 4.2 needs further discussion.  
There are indications that measuring ionised calcium could be more accurate in complex patients such as 
patients undergoing dialysis. However, measurement of ionised calcium is more expensive and not performed 
at all sites. It is therefore accepted that corrected calcium is used in the SmPC. The SmPC proposal state that 
serum calcium levels should be maintained within the normal range. This is endorsed. However, the normal 
range is differs marked depending on the methods used by the laboratory and age of the child. Therefore, 
giving exact Ca limits in the SmPC may be misleading. Therefore, guidance for dose adjustment in paediatric 
patients given in the SmPC is now expressed relative to the age-specific normal range instead of absolute Ca 
values.  
Results from the open-label, single-arm study 26-week study 20110100 (subjects <6 years) show 
decreases in iPTH and calcium. 
In both controlled trials 2007028 and 20130356 cinacalcet was used as a part of a therapeutic regiment 
including phosphate binders and/or Vitamin D sterols.  
The primary endpoint for the 2 controlled studies was the proportion of subjects with ≥  30% reduction from 
baseline in mean plasma iPTH during the efficacy assessment phase (EAP), which was defined as the period 
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017 
Page 71/103 
 
 
  
  
between weeks 25 and 30, inclusive, for Study 20070208 and weeks 17 and 20, inclusive, for Study 
20130356.  
The results of the Bayesian extrapolation study show a tendency to higher response rate when results in the 
adult population compared to the paediatric population. 
Study 20090198 was a retrospective, observational chart review in 23 paediatric subjects from birth to < 6 
years of age (mean age 32.6 months). The subjects received Cinacalcet off-label. This study type has several 
limitations and no firm conclusions of efficacy can be drawn. 
Interim data from the ongoing, single arm, open-label, extension study 20140159 showed that low levels of 
iCa were common. Weekly assessments of calcium using protocol-specified ionized calcium thresholds to 
guided dose adjustment and withholding precluded dose titration to achieve the target iPTH reduction in the 
majority of subjects. The study illustrates similar concerns as the controlled studies. 
Results from both phase III studies are not appropriate to unequivocally demonstrate efficacy in the 
proposed indication. In study 20070208 a trend in favor of cinacalcet over placebo could be seen, however. 
Evaluation of the results from the second pivotal trial, study 20130356, showed that the efficacy was less 
than expected which was most likely due to inadequate drug exposure in the majority of the subjects. This 
was supposedly a direct consequence of additional safety measures and a conservative management of the 
investigational product dosing in order to further minimize the risk of hypocalcaemia.  
Based on the pharmacological mechanism, PK extrapolation for a safe starting dose in children above 3 years 
as well as results from the 20070208 study, it is likely that Mimpara is be effective in lowering PTH in 
paediatric patients if the dose can be titrated without endangering hypocalcaemia- such as in cases where the 
use of SOC is limited by hypercalcaemia. An unmet medical need to treat patients who still have elevated 
PTH levels in spite of optimally titrated standard of care therapy is recognized. Further data should be 
obtained in a proposed registry study, agreed as a category 3 study.  
A restricted indication in the paediatric population in whom sHPT is not “adequately controlled with standard 
of care therapy” was considered adequate by CHMP, in particular in the context of elevated S-Ca levels. Due 
to the risk of severe hypocalcaemia in children, the treatment should not be initiated at S-Ca levels at the 
lower limit of normal.  Corrected serum calcium should be monitored, and be above or in the upper range of 
the reference interval prior to initiation of Mimpara in the paediatric population. Mimpara should not be used 
in hypocalcaemia in both adults and children and hypocalcaemia is therefore a contraindication in the SmPC. 
For children under 3 years, the data is not sufficient to recommend a starting dose with acceptable safety.

2.7.1.1.  Exposure 
On day 121 of the procedure, further data has been provided from study 20130356 and study 20110100 
which have been completed. Furthermore the cut-off of the previously submitted 20140159, ongoing study 
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017

has been extended from 29 February 2016 to 29 April 2016. The following section has been updated 
accordingly in order to reflect the current safety results available.  
Across the entire cinacalcet paediatric development program, 103 subjects were exposed to cinacalcet in 
phase 1, 2, and 3 interventional clinical studies (cut-off date for Study 20140159:  29 April 2016; all other 
studies complete).  This includes 5 subjects between 28 days and < 2 years, 24 subjects between 2 and < 6 
years, 24 subjects between 6 and < 12 years, and 48 subjects between 12 and < 18 years; 2 subjects were 
18 years old at enrolment and are classified into "18 to < 65 years" category (see Table below, footnote).  
Summaries of cinacalcet exposure across all paediatric clinical studies, in phase 1 studies, in other studies 
(i.e., the phase 2 and 3 paediatric clinical studies), and in randomized and controlled studies by age group 
are summarized below.

2.7.1.2.  Main studies 20070208 and 20130356  
Adverse events 
Data from the 2 studies were presented side by side and not pooled, because safety measures related to 
hypocalcaemia monitoring in Study 20130356 resulted in lower exposure in Study 20130356 compared with 
Study 20070208. In below table, the corresponding numbers from adult studies 20000172, 20000183, and 
20000188 are included for comparison.

c Adverse events leading to discontinuation in adult registrational studies 
In the paediatric randomized and controlled pool, a similar proportion of subjects in the cinacalcet and control 
groups of the double-blind Study 20070208 had at least 1 adverse event (82% versus 86%, respectively), 
but not in the cinacalcet and control groups of open-label Study 20130356 (84% versus 57%). The open-
label study design of Study 20130356 may have contributed to the difference between studies in adverse 
event attribution. 
Most adverse events were reported for a similar proportion of subjects in the cinacalcet and control groups.  
In Study 20070208, the most common events reported in the cinacalcet group were vomiting (7 subjects 
[31.8%]), hypocalcaemia (5 subjects [22.7%]), and nausea (4 subjects [18.2%]); all other events in the 
cinacalcet group were reported for ≤ 3 subjects.  In Study 20130356, the most common adverse events 
reported in the cinacalcet + SOC group were hypocalcaemia (6 subjects [24.0%]), nausea (3 subjects

[12.0%]), and muscle spasms (3 subjects [12.0%]).  All other adverse events in the cinacalcet + SOC group 
were reported for ≤ 2 subjects. 
Adverse events were reported for 9 (90.0%) subjects in the open-label phase of study 20070208. The 
adverse events reported for more than 1 subject were hypocalcaemia (40.0%, 4/10 subjects); nausea 
(30.0%, 3/10 subjects); and headache, hypertension, paraesthesia, abdominal pain, and pyrexia (20.0% 
each, 2/10 subjects). 
Serious adverse events 
In the paediatric randomized and controlled pool, serious adverse events were reported for 9 subjects 
(40.9%) in the cinacalcet group and 9 subjects (42.9%) in the placebo group of Study 20070208 and for 4 
subjects (16.0%) in the cinacalcet + SOC group and 2 subjects (6.7%) in the SOC group of Study 20130356. 
The only serious adverse events reported for > 1 subject total across the study cinacalcet groups were 
hypertension (2 cinacalcet subjects and 1 control subject in Study 20070208), fluid overload (1 cinacalcet 
subject in each study and 1 control subject in Study 20070208) and peritonitis (1 cinacalcet subject and 0 
control subjects in each study).  Hypocalcaemia was reported as a serious adverse event for 1 subject (4.5%) 
in the cinacalcet group (Study 20070208) in the randomized and controlled pool.  
Four subjects (2 cinacalcet, 2 control; all in Study 20070208) had serious adverse events considered related 
to study treatment.   
The applicant has provided detailed information regarding the 2 SAE which were considered related to the 
investigational product. Both cases were related to hypocalcaemia, which is considered to be an expected 
Adverse Event due to the mechanism of action of cinacalcet. Nonetheless, in one case the severe 
hypocalcaemia was linked to a fatal case/event (see below under “Deaths”).  
During the open-label phase of study 20070208, 4 subjects (40.0%) had serious adverse events. No serious 
adverse event was experienced by more than 1 subject. 
Deaths 
One subject experienced a fatal adverse event (reported preferred term: cardiopulmonary failure) during the 
study 20070208. The fatality occurred in a 14-year-old girl with end-stage renal disease and secondary HPT 
on peritoneal dialysis  
The analysis of lab data showed that the subject had substantial increases in iPTH (≥ 300pg/mL) with 
concomitant decrease in serum calcium.  Although the fatality was determined to be multifactorial, a causal 
role for hypocalcemia as a result of treatment with cinacalcet could not be excluded, as a lab report that 
became available after the fatality showed a corrected calcium concentration of 5.3 mg/dL on the morning of 
the subject’s death.  
No death was reported in the final results from study 20130356. 
Adverse events of interest 
Based on the mechanism of action, the pharmacological profile of cinacalcet, potential class effects of 
cinacalcet as a CaR agonist, and observations made during the nonclinical and clinical program, the following 
events of interest were summarized for the paediatric clinical studies:

Hypocalcaemia 
The main safety concern of Cinacalcet in the paediatric population is hypocalcaemia. At Day 121, the 
applicant was requested to analyse whether cases of low calcium levels and hypocalcaemia in clinical studies 
are more common/ more severe in paediatric population compared to the adult population and discuss

possible rationale for that. This information is discussed in a separate section below where pooled data from 
all studies are presented.  
Haematology 
No clinically significant changes were observed in hematology parameters during the study. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety  
No clinically significant changes were observed in vital signs. Bazett-corrected QT interval (QTcB) was 
recorded in Study 20070208 and Study 20130356 with minor and varying changes recorded, 
Discontinuation due to AES 
2 subjects (5.7%) from the control group of study 20070208 (placebo) discontinued the study due to adverse 
events. 
In study 20130356 no discontinuation due to adverse events was recorded. 
2.7.1.3.  Safety in supportive studies: 
Please see the efficacy section for a detailed description of the studies. 
Study 20110100 (n=18) 
Overall, 94.1% of subjects had at least 1 adverse event. The most common adverse events in all subjects 
were cough, hypertension, upper respiratory tract infection, and vomiting (23.5% each). Nine (52.9%) 
subjects had a serious adverse event. All serious adverse events were reported for a single subject, except 
for preferred terms of complication associated with device and hypertension (2 subjects each). No deaths 
occurred during the study, and no subject discontinued investigational product because of an adverse event. 
Results from this study showed no subject developed cCa levels < 9.0 mg/dL (2.25 mmol/L) for ages 28 days 
to < 2 years, or < 8.4 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) for ages ≥ 2 to < 6 years (the primary endpoint). 
Study 20090198 (n=23) 
Two subjects had adverse drug reactions (i.e., cinacalcet-related adverse events): decreased level of 
consciousness and intermittent mild hypocalcemia; the decreased level of consciousness event occurred in 
the setting of marked hypocalcaemia and was considered serious.  
One subject reported a SAE of decreased level of consciousness in the setting of marked hypocalcaemia and 
was considered related to cinacalcet treatment. 
Two deaths were recorded in the chart review; neither death was reported by the investigator as related to 
cinacalcet.  
a)  A 1-year-old boy died from invasion of systemic aspergillose (systemic aspergillosis) in combination 
with an arterial hypertonus, which ended in dialysis with a hemorrhagic apoplexy (hemorrhagic 
stroke).  
b)  A 3-year-old girl had acute respiratory compromise at home and subsequently died as a result of 
respiratory failure in a hospital.

Study 20030227 (N=12): 
Two subjects (17%) had non-serious adverse events:  
1. One subject had adverse events of bacteraemia (grade 2) and pyrexia (grade 1).  
2. One subject had an adverse event of QT interval prolongation (grade 1), observed on the end-of-study 
ECG and obtained 4 days after cinacalcet administration, which the investigator felt was possibly due to chest 
trauma. None of the adverse events were considered by the investigator to be related to treatment.  
All adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. 
Six subjects had decreases in serum calcium below the lower limit of normal (2.23 mmol/L for both boys and 
girls). The low calcium values for these subjects ranged from 2.00 to 2.22 mmol/L.  
No serious adverse events were reported and no deaths occurred in this single-dose study.  
Study 20090005 (N=12):  
Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 3 of 12 (25%) subjects, including 1 of 4 (25%) 
subject 28 days to < 3 years old and 2 of 8 (25%) subjects ≥ 3 years to < 6 years old. 
Adverse events reported for 1 subject 28 days to < 3 years old were vomiting, catheter site haemorrhage 
and device expulsion by the same subject. Adverse events reported for subjects ≥ 3 years to < 6 years old 
were body temperature increased and hypocalcaemia (treatment-related adverse event of interest), each 
reported by 1 subject. There were no grade 4 events reported during the study. Grade 3 events included 1 
event each of catheter site haemorrhage, device expulsion (chest catheter falling out), and hypocalcaemia. 
Changes observed in laboratory test results were consistent with the disease states under study. No notable 
changes from baseline were observed for vital signs measurements or ECG results. 
1 subject aged ≥ 3 years to < 6 years old reported hypocalcaemia (treatment-related adverse event of 
interest). Grade 3 events included 1 event each of catheter site haemorrhage, device expulsion (chest 
catheter falling out), and hypocalcaemia.  
No serious adverse events were reported and no deaths occurred in this single-dose study.  
Study 20140159 (N=18) (ongoing) 
The primary endpoint for this study was the incidence of adverse events of interest. Nervous system 
disorders excluding seizures (4 subjects), hypocalcaemia (2 subjects), hypersensitivity, and fracture (each 1 
subject) were the only reported adverse events of interest.  None of the adverse events of interest were 
serious adverse events.  The adverse events of hypocalcaemia and paraesthesia were considered related to 
investigational product by the investigator. There were no adverse events of cardiac failure, convulsions, 
hypotension, torsade de pointes/QT prolongation, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, acute pancreatitis, 
drug-related hepatic disorders, malignant or unspecified tumours, ischemic heart disease, medical errors, or 
product use issues.  Hypocalcaemia as primary endpoint is discussed under Efficacy.  
A fatal event was reported in a 2.5-year, old boy.  The fatal event was not deemed to be related to cinacalcet 
by the investigator. According to the autopsy report, the cause of the death was infection 
(bronchopneumonia and acute exacerbation of a chronic pyelonephritis).

NAPRTCS Registry study 20120116 (ongoing)  
NAPRTCS (North American Paediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies) was established in 1987 to 
capture information about current practice and trends in the care of paediatric renal allograft recipients in 
North America. In 1992, the study was expanded to include paediatric patients who receive maintenance 
haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis therapy. A cumulative 3 year interim analysis of data collected by the 
NAPRTCS Dialysis registry on the use of cinacalcet in dialysis participants aged <21 years was submitted. The 
cumulative data includes available safety information about the differences between patients treated with and 
without cinacalcet. 
Exposure:  
At the time of the interim analysis cutoff date of 31 July 2015, 416 patients were enrolled. 73 patients were 
treated with cinacalcet. Dosing information was available for 67 of the 73 subjects treated with cinacalcet 
(age range: 2 to 21.4 years). The most frequent dosing schedule was 30 mg once per day, 210 mg per week. 
This was reported in 27 of the 67 subjects (40%). The median dose was 30 mg (range 7.5 to 120 mg) and 
the median dose per week was 210 mg (range 45 to 840 mg). No further exposure data is available. 
Demographics 
Children in the group receiving cinacalcet were older than children that did not receive cinacalcet, with 37 
(51%) in the >12 year age group (at last follow-up visit) vs. 130 (38%). Median age at last visit was 15.9 
years (range 2.0 – 21.4) in the group that received cinacalcet compared to 12.5 (range 0.2 - 23.6) in the 
group that did not receive cinacalcet during the study period. 
Drug Dosing 
Cinacalcet dosing information was available on 67 of the 73 participants treated with cinacalcet. The most 
frequent dosing schedule is 30 mg once per day (210 mg per week). This was reported in 27 of the 67 
participants (40%). The median dose is 30 mg (range 7.5-120 mg) and the median dose per week (mg) is 
210 mg (range 45-840 mg). 
Safety results: 
Overall, 50 subjects were treated for or had a modification of treatment for hypocalcemia a total of 105 times 
during the cumulative study period. Eleven of these 50 subjects were hospitalized for these events. Ten of 73 
subjects (13.7%) who received cinacalcet were treated for or had a modification of treatment for 
hypocalcemia. Eight of these subjects (11.0%) had a hypocalcemia treatment or modification of 
hypocalcemia treatment and 7 of 8 subjects had a change in cinacalcet therapy. In subjects not receiving 
cinacalcet, 42 of 343 (12.2%) had a total of 86 hypocalcemia treatments or modification of hypocalcemia 
treatment.  
A total of 18 of 416 subjects reported 35 seizures. In subjects receiving cinacalcet, 4 of 73 subjects (5.5%) 
reported 4 seizure episodes; 2 subjects experienced seizures before taking cinacalcet, 1 subject experienced 
a seizure 2 weeks after taking cinacalcet and 1 subject experienced a seizure while taking cinacalcet. In the 
343 subjects that did not receive cinacalcet during the study period, 14 (4.1%) reported a total of 31 
seizures.  
Eighty-seven of 416 subjects reported 156 hospitalizations due to infection. In subjects receiving cinacalcet, 
13 of 73 subjects (17.8%) reported 25 hospitalizations for infection. In subjects that did not receive 
cinacalcet during the study period, 74 of 343 (21.6%) reported a total of 131 hospitalizations for infection.

Other adverse events were reported for 1 subject (1.7%) receiving cinacalcet (moderate subtotal 
parathyroidectomy). Ten subjects (2.9%) not receiving cinacalcet reported other adverse events and 7 of the 
10 experienced serious adverse events (peritonitis [2 subjects], seizure, gastrointestinal bleed, malignant 
hypertension, cracked central venous access device, inguinal hernia repair, peritonitis, and acute viral 
myocarditis).  
The interim analysis cutoff date was 31 July 2015. In response to the Day120 LoQ, the Applicant has 
provided an updated summary of deaths in the study per 01 August 2016. There were 3 fatal cases among 
the 90 patients treated with cinacalcet. In two of the cases, cinacalcet was stopped cinacalcet more than two 
months before the death. The cause of death in the third case was complications to acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia. 
2.7.1.4.  Hypocalcaemia (pooled data) 
The main safety concern of cinacalcet in the paediatric population is hypocalcaemia. The Applicant was 
requested to analyse whether cases of low calcium levels and hypocalcaemia in clinical studies are more 
common/more severe in paediatric population compared to the adult population and discuss possible 
rationale for that. 
Based on the totality of data from the cinacalcet paediatric program, it appears that the incidence of reported 
adverse events of hypocalcaemia in paediatric patients is greater compared with the adult cinacalcet 
registrational studies, however the subject incidence was higher for both cinacalcet and control groups in the 
paediatric studies.

While it is possible that children, who have a greater demand for calcium during their skeletal growth phase, 
experience a higher incidence of hypocalcaemia, it should be noted there are limitations that affect this 
comparison. Specifically, in the studies conducted in adults, laboratory abnormalities were generally not 
collected as adverse events.  Per protocol in the paediatric studies, in addition to the clinical symptoms of 
hypocalcaemia, any clinically important calcium laboratory abnormalities alone could have been reported as 
adverse events.  Of note, laboratory evaluations of calcium were performed more frequently in Study 
20130356 than adult studies (weekly monitoring of ionized calcium, monthly monitoring of corrected serum 
calcium). 
Among all paediatric subjects exposed to cinacalcet in clinical studies (all cinacalcet pool; Studies 20070208, 
20130356, 20110100, 20140159), a total of 19 subjects (24.1%; 64.5 per 100 subject years) had at least 1 
adverse event of hypocalcaemia:  9 subjects (25.7%; 72.2) before the partial clinical hold and 10 subjects 
(22.7%; 58.8) after the partial clinical hold. 
Serious adverse events of hypocalcaemia were reported for 2 subjects:  1 subject (4.5%) in the cinacalcet 
group in the double-blind phase of Study 20070208 (this subject died of cardiopulmonary failure, as 
discussed in Section 1.2.2 “Deaths”) and 1 subject (10.0%) in the open label phase.  No subject had a 
serious adverse event of hypocalcaemia in Study 20130356. 
In other studies, the incidence of hypocalcaemia included the following: 
• 
In Study 20110100, 1 subject enrolled after the partial clinical hold had hypocalcaemia, considered 
related to investigational product; signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia were not evident.

• 
At the time of interim analysis for Study 20140159, non-serious hypocalcaemia (asymptomatic) was 
reported for 2 subjects (11.1%), 1 from each parent study (20130356) treatment group, considered by the 
investigator to be related to investigational product. 
• 
In single-dose Study 20090005, 1 subject (≥ 3 years to < 6 years of age) experienced an adverse 
event of hypocalcaemia (grade 3) approximately 12 hours after dosing on day 1.  The event was considered 
by the investigator to be related to cinacalcet, and resolved on day 3. 
No subjects in Study 20030227 had hypocalcaemia reported as an adverse event 
The Applicant was also requested to provide data on hypocalcaemia in different age groups in the paediatric 
population.  
In Study 20070208, 2/6 cinacalcet subjects and 1/5 placebo subject in the age group of 6 to < 12 years 
experienced hypocalcaemia, and 3/16 subjects from each treatment group in the age range of 12 to < 18 
years experienced hypocalcaemia.  In Study 20130356, 3/8 cinacalcet + SOC subjects (37.5%) and 
2/10 SOC subjects in the age group of 6 to < 12 years experienced hypocalcaemia (preferred term 
hypocalcaemia or blood calcium decreased).  Four out of seventeen cinacalcet + SOC subjects and 1/20 SOC 
subject experienced hypocalcaemia in the 12 to < 18 years age group.   
Among all subjects exposed to cinacalcet, 1/15 subjects in the age group of 2 to < 6 years experienced an 
adverse event of hypocalcaemia. In the age group of 6 to < 12 years, 9/18 subjects experienced adverse 
events of hypocalcaemia (preferred term hypocalcaemia [n = 8] and blood calcium decreased [n = 1]).  In 
the age group of 12 to < 18 years, 9/44 subjects experienced adverse events of hypocalcaemia. 
A summary of the incidence of low corrected serum calcium values by age group (28 days to < 6 years, 6 to 
< 12 years, and 12 to < 18 years) for the all cinacalcet pool is provided in the table below.

2.7.2.  Discussion and Conclusions on clinical safety 
Across the entire cinacalcet paediatric development program, 103 subjects were exposed to cinacalcet in 
phase 1, 2, and 3 interventional clinical studies (cut-off date for Study 20140159:  29 April 2016; all other 
studies complete). This includes 5 subjects between 28 days and < 2 years, 24 subjects between 2 and < 6 
years, 24 subjects between 6 and < 12 years, and 48 subjects between 12 and < 18 years; 2 subjects were 
18 years old at enrolment and are classified into "18 to < 65 years" category. 
In the first pivotal study 20070208, 81.8% of subjects in the cinacalcet group and 85.7% of subjects in the 
placebo group had at least 1 adverse event, with the most common events in the cinacalcet group being 
vomiting (7 subjects [31.8%]), hypocalcemia (5 subjects [22.7%]), and nausea (4 subjects [18.2%]).  
A higher proportion of paediatric subjects in the cinacalcet group compared to the placebo group had 
corrected total calcium concentrations < 8.4 mg/dL (31.8% in the cinacalcet group and 14.3% in the placebo 
group) and < 7.5 mg/dL (13.6% in the cinacalcet group and 0% in the placebo group). 
All subjects enrolled in this study was aged 6 to <18 years. Two serious events of hypocalcaemia were 
reported, one in the double-blind phase and second the open-label phase in patients receiving cinacalcet. 
The study 20070208 was terminated early due to a fatality in the cinacalcet group. At the time of event 
onset, the 14-year old patient was on 90 mg of cinacalcet.  A causal role for hypocalcemia could not be 
excluded. The paediatric program was subsequently placed on partial clinical hold for 14 months. Study 
20130356 was initiated after the paediatric program was reinitiated. 
Results from the second pivotal study 20130356, which was open label, show that the group receiving 
cinacalcet had more adverse events and serious adverse events than the group without cinacalcet. No new 
signals or unexpected safety concerns were observed during the study. It is noted that mean the average 
weight-adjusted daily dose of cinacalcet taken during week 17 to 20 time periods were approximately 80% 
lower than the mean dose taken during the EAP (week 25 to 30) in Study 20070208 (conducted before the 
partial clinical hold).   
The proportion of treatment emerged AEs were comparable in both studies in the cinacalcet arms, as were 
the AEs related to IP, despite the considerably lower doses in study 20130356. There were, however, more 
serious adverse events recorded in study 20070208 (where higher doses were administered). The dose 
response relationship as regards safety is not entirely clear. There are not enough data available for a robust 
conclusion due to the small sample size of both phase III studies. It is also noted that comparability of trials 
is problematic considering the differences in study designs (20070208: RCT; 20130356 open-label, controlled 
trial). 
Results from the open-label, single-arm study 26-week study 20110100 (subjects <6 years) show no new 
safety concerns. This study was designed as a safety and tolerability study. No subjects had corrected serum 
calcium level that met the primary endpoint of a corrected serum calcium of < 9.0 mg/dL (2.25 mmol/L) for 
ages 28 days to < 2 years, and < 8.4 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) for ages ≥ 2 years to < 6 years during the study. 
Two subjects (11.8%; 1 subject each per cohort) in the Calcium Analysis Set, both within the 2 to < 6-year 
age range, had corrected serum calcium levels that were < 8.8 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L). 
Decreases in serum calcium below the lower limit were reported in both single-dose phase 1 studies.

In the NAPRTCS Registry study 20120116, cinacalcet was used to treat older participants who have been on 
dialysis for longer time that was seen in the group not receiving cinacalcet. Crude rates of seizures, change in 
hypocalcemia treatment and hospitalization for infection are similar between cinacalcet users and non-users.  
The main safety concern of Cinacalcet in the paediatric population is hypocalcemia. Based on the totality of 
data from the cinacalcet paediatric program, it appears that the incidence of reported adverse events of 
hypocalcaemia in paediatric patients is greater compared with the adult cinacalcet registrational studies, 
however the subject incidence was higher for both cinacalcet and control groups in the paediatric studies. 
While the risk of hypocalcaemia in paediatric subjects is anticipated to be the same based on available 
knowledge about cinacalcet and the similarities in disease state in adults and children, it cannot be fully 
determined whether hypocalcaemia is more severe in children based on available data. There was a fatality in 
a hypocalcaemic patient in the paediatric clinical program, which lead to partial hold of the clinical 
development program. Hypocalcaemia has now been added as a contraindication for the use of cinacalcet in 
both adult and paediatric patients. In addition, text in SmPC section 4.2 and 4.4 includes wording against 
initiating treatment with cinacalcet unless serum calcium is above or in the upper range of the age-specified 
reference interval in the paediatric population.  
In total, two deaths occurred during the cinacalcet paediatric interventional studies; 1 in Study 20070208 
(see subsection “Deaths” under the headline “Main studies 20070208 and 20130356”) and 1 in the ongoing 
extension study 20140159 (see “study 20140159 above). Although the fatality in study 20070208 was 
determined to be multifactorial, a causal role for hypocalcemia as a result of treatment with cinacalcet could 
not be excluded. In study 20140159, on the other hand, the fatal event was not deemed to be related to 
cinacalcet by the investigator.  
In the non-interventional cinacalcet paediatric studies, 10 deaths were recorded. 5 of the subjects had 
received cinacalcet.  Two deaths were recorded in Study 20090198 (systemic fungal infections and 
respiratory failure). Neither death was reported by the investigator as related to cinacalcet (please refer to 
headline “Study 20090198”).   
In the NAPRTCS registry study (Study 20120116), 3 fatal cases among subjects having received cinacalcet 
were recorded. The causes of death were haemorrhagic pancreatitis for 1 subject and are unknown for the 
other 2 subjects (1 subject collapsed and was unable to be resuscitated and no details were provided for the 
other death, which occurred in a subject with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia-multiple complication). They 
first 2 subjects were known to have stopped cinacalcet more than two months before the death. The cause of 
death in the third case was complications to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted in paediatric patients with CKD and secondary HPT 
receiving dialysis. No update of section 4.5 of the SmPC is foreseen. In study 122055 patient- and disease- 
descriptors/covariates were evaluated as predictors of key PK parameters. These covariates included: 
demographic factors, organ function biomarkers, disease characteristics and concomitant medications. 
Treatment regimens for sHPT are rather similar between adults and paediatric patients, concomitant 
medications include vitamin D, phosphate binders and calcium supplements. However, especially in very 
young children drug management could differ as additional medication might be indicated to support weight 
gain or other conditions specific for infants.  
The main difference in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism between adults and the paediatric 
population is the treatment of possible growth retardation and the underlying comorbidities. The applicant 
has provided a discussion covering the most common used therapeutics to treat the comorbid conditions 
contributing to growth retardation and has also discussed the potential for interaction with the metabolism of 
cinacalcet.  
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017 
Page 87/103 
 
 
  
  
The most common medications used to treat comorbidities in relation to growth retardation in the paediatric 
population will most likely be found in the area of Anemia, Vitamin D Deficiency, undernutrition, metabolic 
Acidosis or renal bone disease. The typical standard medication used, as outlined by the applicant, will most 
likely not interfere with Cinacalcet metabolism. This is especially true for the treatment of growth retardation 
with recombinant growth hormone or the treatment of undernutrition or Anemia via dietary supplements 
such as Vitamins or caloric supplements. Other medications used such as Erythropoetin are not metabolized 
by CYP enzymes. Furthermore the treatment of other comorbidities in relation to growth retardation will most 
likely not be expected to interact with cinacalcet via CYP mediated drug interactions, since alternative 
pathways such as CYP2R1 and CPY27B1, and CYP24AI exist or the medication applied are metabolized via 
chemical reactions, as discussed by the applicant as part of the responses to Day180 questions. Other 
therapies such as vitamin D, phosphate binders, and calcium supplementation have been evaluated in the 
clinical studies of cinacalcet with no known drug-drug interactions with cinacalcet. In conclusion, the activity 
of CYP3A4 and 2D6 reaches levels similar to those of adults by approximately 2-3 years of age. The main 
differences with regards to the treatment of hyperparathyroidism between both treatment groups therefore 
lies in the treatment of possible growth retardation and the underlying comorbidities. The applicant´s 
argumentation line provided as part of the responses to Day180 questions as to why interactions with 
Cinacalcet treatment are most likely not to occur can be followed, especially since treatment regimens 
directed at secondary hyperparathyroidism and associated comorbidities can be considered comparable 
between adults and paediatric patients and are already covered with appropriate statements in section 4.4 
and 4.5 of the SmPC.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) develops in children and adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 
disorder is characterized by persistently elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in serum or plasma, 
and it represents an adaptive response that serves primarily to maintain calcium homeostasis systemically as 
kidney function declines. 
The development of CKD-mineral bone disease (CKD-MBD) is manifested by either 1 or a combination of the 
following: 1) abnormalities in calcium, phosphorus, PTH, or vitamin D metabolism; 2) abnormalities in bone 
turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth, or strength; and 3) vascular or other soft tissue calcification 
(KDIGO, 2009). In children, CKD-MBD develops early in the course of CKD, such that a significant portion of 
children on dialysis have manifestations of CKD-MBD. 
The clinical outcome most frequently associated with secondary HPT is the development of high-turnover 
bone disease, which results in reduced bone mass and increases the risk of bone deformities and fractures in 
adults and children with advanced CKD. Secondary HPT is also thought to play a role in growth retardation in 
children, potentially through alterations in bone architecture (including lesions in the epiphyseal growth 
plate), which interfere with bone formation and lead to impaired bone growth. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Children with ESRD and secondary HPT are prioritized for kidney transplant and often undergo definitive 
treatment with renal transplant within the first year after starting dialysis. In addition, to adequately treat 
paediatric patients with cinacalcet, an age appropriate formulation is needed since the starting dose of 0.2 
mg/kg cannot be reached with the 30 mg tablets, the dose will always be too high. 
Currently, there are no approved medical therapies for the management of secondary HPT in paediatric 
patients with CKD receiving dialysis in the European Union (EU) or the US. A number of drugs have been 
approved in adult patients including Cinacalcet. Current treatment consists of vitamin D sterols, such as 
calcitriol or synthetic vitamin D analogues and phosphate binding. In some circumstances, their use may be 
limited due to aggravation of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, conditions associated with increased 
long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 
The pathophysiology of secondary HPT is thought to be similar in adults and children. Since secondary 
hyperparathyroidism is relatively common in children with CKD receiving dialysis, this may lead to off-label 
use of Cinacalcet without information about age- and weight-based dosing and titration. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The primary biochemical end-point in main paediatric studies (achievement of a ≥ 30% reduction from 
baseline in mean plasma iPTH) is considered to be a relevant surrogate marker for efficacy in treatment of 
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017

sHPT in CKD). Plasma iPTH is used in clinical routine today to balance currently available therapy for this 
condition. 
The safety and efficacy of cinacalcet in paediatrics is primarily studied in two phase 3, controlled studies 
(20070208 and 20130356), conducted in subjects aged 6 to < 18 years with CKD and secondary HPT 
receiving dialysis. Study 20070208 was conducted in 43 subjects and included a 30-week double-blind, 
placebo-controlled phase followed by a 30-week open-label phase. Study 20130356 was a randomized, 
multicentre, open-label, controlled study. Cinacalcet was evaluated in paediatric subjects between the ages of 
6 and < 18 years, with secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were 
receiving either haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Subjects were randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups; 
administration of cinacalcet daily in addition to standard of care (SOC) treatment group, or a SOC treatment 
group. Subjects in both treatment groups who completed the 20-week treatment period were eligible to enrol 
in an open-label extension study (Study 20140159) for further safety follow-up. 
All subjects in these studies received standard of care with vitamin D sterols (calcitriol and its analogues), 
calcium supplements, and phosphate binders at the discretion of the investigator. 
A phase 2 single arm study in children <6 years has also recently been completed. A retrospective chart 
review has also been performed in children <6 years. 
In addition, the submission included paediatric data from a Bayesian extrapolation study, two single dose 
phase 1 studies and description of an ongoing extension study.  
PK data are available in a single dose setting in paediatric patients from 8 month up to 16 years (study 
20030227, study 20090005) and in a multiple dose setting from children 12 month -18 years (study 
20070208 and study 20110100). In addition, PK data in children 28 days-18 years were modelled in POP PK 
and PD study 122055 and PBPK study 122086.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Two controlled phase 3 studies were performed in paediatric subjects 6 to 18 years. Both were terminated 
early, study 20070208 due to a fatality in the study and study 20130356 due to difficulties in recruitment.  
Study 20070208 showed trend to positive efficacy results. A total of 5 out of 21 (24%) of the placebo 
patients and 11 out of 22 (50%) of Cinacalcet treated patients reached the primary endpoint (p= 0.08), 
which was the number of patients achieving ≥ 30% reduction in mean iPTH from baseline to the efficacy 
assessment phase.  When iPTH values collected after investigational product suspension were excluded, the 
corresponding numbers presented were 4 out of 21 (19%) in placebo and 12 out of 22 (55%) in Cinacalcet 
treated patients, p=0.017. 
Cinacalcet + SOC were compared with SOC only in the second pivotal study for the paediatric application, 
open-label study 20130356. The results of study 21030356 showed that the proportion of subjects 
achieving ≥ 30% reduction from baseline in mean plasma iPTH during weeks 17 to 20 was lower (22.2% [6 of 
27 subjects]) in the cinacalcet + SOC group than in the SOC group (32.1% [9 of 28 subjects]) (p =0.42, 
stratified by age). The difference ([cinacalcet + SOC] – [SOC]) in the proportions was -9.9% (95% 
confidence interval [CI] -33.3%, 13.4%).  
In summary, no trend towards cinacalcet efficacy in reducing iPTH compared to SOC was seen in this study. 
However, the mean dose of cinacalcet during the EAP in Study 20130356 was approximately 80% lower than 
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017 
Page 94/103 
 
 
  
  
the mean dose during the EAP in Study 20070208. The drug exposure in this open-label study might have 
been a direct consequence of additional safety measures and a conservative management of investigational 
product dosing focused on further minimizing the risk of hypocalcemia. Cinacalcet dose was reduced or 
withheld even in situations when the subject’s corrected serum calcium level was still in the normal range. 
Comparison with adult data: A total of 1136 adult subjects with secondary HPT and ESRD were enrolled in 3 
key phase 3 studies. When the results were pooled, the iPTH concentration was reduced by 42% during the 
efficacy-assessment phase in the cinacalcet group (n=665) compared with an increase of 8% in the placebo 
group (n=471). Serum calcium was reduced by 7% during the efficacy-assessment phase in the cinacalcet 
group compared with an increase of 0.6% in the placebo group. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In the pivotal study 20070208, a larger proportion of patients discontinued IP in the Cinacalcet group (17 vs 
10 subjects in the placebo group).  Although a numeric imbalance in IP discontinuation was observed 
between treatment groups, the primary reasons for discontinuation (study termination and kidney transplant) 
were unrelated to treatment received or treatment outcomes. 
Because of the early termination of this study due to fatality, less data were collected than originally planned. 
As a large proportion of the patients did not complete the planned treatment period, LOCF has a large impact 
on the results. Consequently, the results for the primary efficacy endpoint in study 20070208 are not robust. 
The observed effect in reduction of iPTH levels in study 20070208 is considered rather small.  The mean 
differences are directionally consistent with the primary analysis for the study, which was based on the 
dichotomized response endpoint of PTH reduction of > 30% from baseline. However the individual patients’ 
data show that there is no substantial difference between the two treatment groups over the time. 
Consequently, it is not possible to make a clear statement that the iPTH reduction is in favour for cinacalcet 
arm. 
Secondary endpoints that could have helped interpreting the clinical effect outside the surrogate endpoint 
(such as e.g. bone mineral density) could not be thoroughly assessed due to the relatively short duration of 
drug exposure and the low number of evaluable subjects in both groups. 
The summary of results of study 20130356 showed that dose titration seems not to have been performed 
according to the anticipated protocol or the recommendations in the SmPC and that drug exposure might in 
general have been too low to achieve therapeutic benefit. This might also be an issue later in clinical practice 
where the chronic “sub therapeutic” treatment might not provide any benefit to the patient. The study results 
did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between treatment groups in the primary endpoint 
(proportion of subjects who achieved a ≥  30% reduction in iPTH during the EAP). The effect was even 
smaller than could be anticipated from interim data. 
The results of the Bayesian extrapolation study show a tendency to higher response rate in the adult 
population compared to the paediatric population.    
Since the final results from study 20130356 became available, the applicant proposes to restrict the 
paediatric indication for Mimpara capsules as a second line treatment option in paediatric patients where 
treatment with vitamin D is not sufficient. 
The sought indication was from children > 28 days. However, the youngest subject recruited and evaluated 
in any trials was 7 months old (Study 20090198, a retrospective chart review). Extrapolation on the basis of 
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017 
Page 95/103 
 
 
  
  
modelling- and simulation was performed using popPK, PKPD and PBPK analyses. The PK/PD analysis was 
deemed too uncertain.  The PBPK was suggested to be used to predict pK in young children as the clinical pk 
data is very limited in this age group. Even if the PBPK simulations provide a conservative estimate of 
expected exposures in children the use of PBPK in this context for cinacalcet is too uncertain as the PBPK 
model is children do not show adequate performance as well as the Qualification aspects in young children 
(below 3 years) is too limited to use PBPK for extrapolation.  
The simulations from the popPK model can be used to guide the start dose in children down to 3 years of age 
and while the popPK model can be further improved, it appears passable for this purpose. There remain 
significant uncertainties that reliable and reasonable dosing recommendations can be derived, especially for 
younger age cohorts.  As the extrapolation exercises do not provide reliable results for all age groups, the 
target population has been adapted accordingly and restricted to age 3 and older.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The important identified risks in the Cinacalcet RMP include hypocalcaemia, convulsion/seizures, 
hypersensitivity reactions, hypotension and/or worsening of heart failure and QT prolongation and ventricular 
arrhythmias secondary to hypocalcemia. In adult studies, the most commonly reported undesirable effects 
were nausea (31% cinacalcet vs. 19% placebo) and vomiting (27% cinacalcet vs. 15% placebo) 
In the controlled paediatric study 20070208, the most common events were vomiting (7 subjects [32%] 
cinacalcet vs 5 subjects [24%] in placebo group), hypocalcemia (5 subjects [23%] cinacalcet) vs 4 subjects 
[19%] in placebo group, and nausea (4 subjects [18%] vs 3 subjects [14%]). 
A higher proportion of paediatric subjects in the cinacalcet group compared to the placebo group had 
corrected total calcium concentrations < 8.4 mg/dL (32% in the cinacalcet group and 14% in the placebo 
group) and < 7.5 mg/dL (14% in the cinacalcet group and 0% in the placebo group). 
The study 20070208 was terminated early due to a fatality in the cinacalcet group. At the time of event 
onset, the 14-year old patient was on 90 mg of cinacalcet.  A causal role for hypocalcaemia could not be 
excluded. 
In the final study report from studies 20130356 and 20110100, no subjects were withdrawn from the study 
due to an adverse event and no events were fatal. No new signals or unexpected safety concerns were 
observed. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The important potential risks in the cinacalcet RMP include possible drug-related hepatic disorders, nervous 
system disorders, acute pancreatitis, fracture, myocardial ischemia and neoplastic events. 
Across the entire cinacalcet paediatric development program, 103 subjects were exposed to cinacalcet in 
phase 1, 2, and 3 interventional clinical studies (cut-off date for Study 20140159:  29 April 2016; all other 
studies complete).  This includes 5 subjects between 28 days and < 2 years, 24 subjects between 2 and < 6 
years, 24 subjects between 6 and < 12 years, and 48 subjects between 12 and < 18 years; 2 subjects were 
18 years old at enrolment and are classified into "18 to < 65 years" category. This limited number of 
paediatric subjects allows only the detection of common and very common adverse events. 
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017 
Page 96/103 
 
 
  
  
Due to the fatality in a hypocalcaemic patient in Study 20070208, the maximum dose was lower in recently 
completed study 20130356 compared to study 20070208.  However, the recorded level of frequency of 
hypocalcaemia was not lower in Study 20130356 (7/28 subjects in the cinacalcet group) than in study 
20070208 (5/23 in the double-blind phase), Due to preclinical findings, growth retardation in children 
secondary to hypocalcaemia has been proposed to be added as an important potential risk. However, it is 
considered that this risk is already covered by the general important identified risk of hypocalcaemia.   
No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted in paediatric patients with CKD and secondary HPT 
receiving dialysis. The activity of CYP3A4 and 2D6 reaches levels similar to those of adults by approximately 
2-3 year of age. The main differences with regards to the treatment of hyperparathyroidism between both 
treatment groups therefore lies in the treatment of possible growth retardation and the underlying 
comorbidities.  Treatment regimens directed at secondary hyperparathyroidism and associated comorbidities 
can be considered comparable between adults and paediatric patients and are already covered with 
appropriate statements in section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The favorable effects of Cinacalcet were measured mainly in terms of surrogate endpoint, iPTH, both in adult 
and paediatric studies. Maintenance of PTH levels within a target range and of serum calcium in the normal 
range as well as avoidance of hyperphosphatemia are the main goals of treatment. Reaching these goals is 
challenging, however. The clinical relevance of reaching target levels of PTH is supported by relevant 
treatment guidelines and publications, but the clinical benefit of lowering PTH over a limited period of time is 
unknown. As in the paediatric population patients will be prioritized for kidney transplant, treatment 
durations will be shorter for most patients when compared to adults. An impact on harder clinical outcome 
measures such as growth or skeletal development seems not established in the respective population and 
associations between reductions in PTH and reductions of bone metabolism markers were not statistically 
significant.  
The presentations of patients with hypocalcaemia (main safety concern) vary widely, from asymptomatic to 
life-threatening situations. Most hypocalcaemic emergencies are mild and require only supportive treatment 
and further laboratory evaluation. Severe hypocalcaemia may result in seizures, tetany, refractory 
hypotension, arrhythmias and death. This is of concern since one fatality, possibly due to hypocalcaemia, has 
been reported in one of the paediatric studies. 
A new formulation (granules filled in gelatine capsules that are intended to be sprinkled out on food or liquid 
or administered through gastric or gastro-nasal tubes) could be favourable in paediatric population and also 
in adult patients with difficulties in swallowing. However, the handling of the capsules (to open the capsules 
to administer just the granules) may not be optimal way of administration. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks  
Based on the pharmacological mechanism, PK extrapolation for a safe starting dose in children above 3 years 
as well as results from the 20070208 study, it is likely that Mimpara is effective in lowering PTH in paediatric 
Assessment report  
EMA/449274/2017 
Page 97/103 
 
 
  
  
patients if the dose can be titrated without endangering hypocalcaemia- such as in cases where the use of 
SOC is limited by hypercalcaemia. Mimpara failed to meet its primary objective in study 20130356 and other 
treatment options should be considered before initiating cinacalcet. Nevertheless, individual subject profiles 
from the phase 3 studies show a trend toward iPTH reduction with increased dose of cinacalcet and an 
increase in iPTH is seen when cinacalcet treatment is stopped or interrupted.  An unmet medical need to treat 
patients who still have elevated PTH levels in spite of optimally titrated standard of care therapy is 
recognized. Further data is expected to be obtained in a proposed registry study, agreed as a category 3 
study.  
A restricted indication in the paediatric population in whom sHPT is not “adequately controlled with standard 
of care therapy” was considered adequate by CHMP, in particular in the context of elevated S-Ca levels. Due 
to the risk of severe hypocalcaemia in children, the treatment should not be initiated at S-Ca levels at the 
lower limit of normal.  Corrected serum calcium should be monitored, and be above or in the upper range of 
the reference interval prior to initiation of Mimpara in the paediatric population. Mimpara should not be used 
in hypocalcaemia in both adults and children and hypocalcaemia is therefore a contraindication in the SmPC. 
For children under 3 years, the data is not sufficient to recommend a starting dose with acceptable safety. 
Although the new formulation may represent an improvement compared to crushing tablets and are in line 
with the PDCO requirement to develop an age adequate formulation, the capsules used have proven to be 
very difficult to open without damaging them and avoiding spillage. The potential risk of spillage may 
jeopardize dose accuracy, especially since several capsules may need to be opened. The applicant has 
commited to evaluate alternative capsule designs and identify a more suitable primary container/capsule for 
the granules. Also, to reduce the number of capsules for the patients requiring a higher dose, the Applicant 
commits to considering the need for any additional strength of 10 or 15 mg. In addition, a commitment to 
improve the uniformity of content method has been made. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The benefit/risk for Mimpara for the proposed new indication in children above 3 years not adequately 
controlled with standard of care therapy is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority decision 
that the risk-benefit balance of Mimpara 1 mg, 2.5 mg and 5 mg granules in capsules for opening, is 
favourable in the following indications: 
Secondary hyperparathyroidism 
Adults  
Treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in adult patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on 
maintenance dialysis therapy.

Mimpara may be used as part of a therapeutic regimen including phosphate binders and/or Vitamin D sterols, 
as appropriate (see section 5.1).

Although the tablets and the capsule formulations provide acceptable dosing flexibility for the starting dose 
and for those who can swallow and take 30 mg tablets, the available formulations are not considered 
adequate for the older children and those at a higher maintenance dose who are not able to swallow. The 
capsules have proven very difficult to open without damage by trained pharmaceutical assessors and 
performance in a real life setting may be even worse. Opening the capsule and mixing the granules with food 
or liquid may be found difficult by the patient or the responsible person such that inaccurate dosing may 
result. For children and patients with difficulties in swallowing, a large number of capsules (up to 12) may be 
needed on a daily basis. This would imply substantial discomfort for the patient, parent or care giver. The 
dose accuracy is also considered questionable, with content uniformity being tested on the entire capsule 
rather than the contents, essentially the delivered dose. Therefore, for patient’s comfort and safety, this kind 
of administration seems to be questionable and should be reconsidered. A better single-dose container should 
be developed. 
New instructions in the SmPC, the labelling, and the commitments by the applicant are acknowledged. 
Nonetheless, the current product is still poorly designed and not patient friendly. Replacing the off-label use 
of crushed tablets with a poorly designed alternative is not considered an improvement. Therefore, the 
benefit/risk remains negative.

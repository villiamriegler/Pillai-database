1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Cetuximab  is  a  chimeric  monoclonal  Immunoglobulin  G1  (IgG1)  antibody  directed  against  the 
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). EGFR signaling pathways are involved in the control of cell 
survival,  cell  cycle  progression,  angiogenesis,  cell  migration  and  cellular  invasion/metastasis. 
Cetuximab  binds  to  the  EGFR  with  an  affinity  higher  than  that  of  endogenous  ligands.  Cetuximab 
blocks  binding  of  endogenous  EGFR  ligands  resulting  in  inhibition  of  the  function  of  the  receptor  and 
induces the internalization of EGFR, which can lead to down-regulation of the receptor. Cetuximab also 
targets  cytotoxic  immune  effector  cells  towards  EGFR-expressing  tumour  cells  (antibody  dependent 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC).  
Erbitux  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  EGFR-expressing,  KRAS  (Kirsten  rat  sarcoma 
viral oncogene homologue) wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: 
in combination with chemotherapy 
as a single agent in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based therapy, and who are 
intolerant to irinotecan. 
Erbitux is also indicated for the treatment of patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck: 
in combination with radiation therapy for locally advanced disease 
in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for recurrent and/or metastatic disease. 
In  all  indications,  Erbitux  is  administered  once  a  week  as  intravenous  infusion  at  a  maximum  rate  of 
10 mg/min. The initial dose is 400 mg/m2, and all subsequent weekly doses are 250 mg/m2.  
This variation application was submitted by the MAH on the recommendation of the CHMP in follow-up 
to  the  assessment  of  Follow-UP  Measure  044  (FUM  044)  and  the  ensuing  additional  Follow-Up 
Measures  (FU2  044.1  and  FU2  044.2).  Follow-Up  Measure  044  was  initiated  by  the  CHMP  in 
September 2009 together with FUM 029 for Vectibix, triggered by findings in a panitumumab (Vectibix) 
add-on  to  FOLFOX4  (folinic  acid,  5-fluorouracil,  oxaliplatin)  study  showing  a  negative  impact  on 
Progression-Free  Survival  (PFS)  in  patients  with  metastatic  colerectal  cancer  (mCRC)  tumours 
harbouring activating KRAS mutations further to similar earlier findings for cetuximab, also in an mCRC 
add-on  to  FOLFOX4  study  (OPUS).  Assessments  followed  with  the  aim  to  understand  the  underlying 
mechanisms  behind  these  findings  and  also  aiming  at  risk  reduction.  In  the  course  of  these 
assessments,  data  suggesting  lack  of  efficacy  of  cetuximab  were  reported  in  combinations  of 
cetuximab  with  oxaliplatin  –  fluoropyrimidine  regimens  (COIN,  submitted  and  assessed)  and  with  the 
Nordic FLOX (fluoropyrimidine-oxaliplatin) regimen (NORDIC VII, only high level data available). 
With  this  variation  application  the  MAH  proposed  changes  to  sections  4.1,  4.5  and  5.1  of  the  SmPC 
based on the results of the COIN study. The CHMP considered that the mCRC indication in combination 
with  chemotherapy  should  be  restricted.  A  new  variation  will  be  submitted  when  the  clinical  study 
report of the NORDIC VII trial becomes available with the intention to update the SmPC based on the 
results of this trial and to reassess the benefit-risk balance of the restricted indication. 
1.2.  Clinical aspects 
The initial indication granted for cetuximab was in mCRC as add-on to irinotecan in patients previously 
exposed  to  oxaliplatin  and  with  irinotecan  refractory  mCRC  based  on  a  study  (BOND)  showing  that 
2 
 
 
irinotecan  +  cetuximab  was  more  effective  than  cetuximab  alone  [cetuximab  Overall  Response  Rate 
(ORR) 11%, cetuximab + irinotecan 23%]. No KRAS mutation data are available from this trial.  
The  initial  Erbitux  mCRC  indication  was  extended  to  treatment  of  patients  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy or as single agent (after oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy) with variation 
EMEA/H/C/000558/II/0020  (EC  Decision  7  July  2008).  Support  for  the  monotherapy  indication  came 
primarily from the following trial: 
CA225025  (NCIC):  randomised,  controlled  phase  III  study  of  cetuximab  as  single  agent  in  patients 
who had failed currently available standard chemotherapy regimens 
As the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens for mCRC are combinations of fluoropyrimidines 
with either oxaliplatin or irinotecan, the indication in combination with chemotherapy was supported by 
the following studies: 
EMR 62 202-013 (CRYSTAL): randomised, controlled phase III study of cetuximab in combination with 
FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI in patients with mCRC previously untreated for metastatic disease 
EMR  62  202-047  (OPUS):  randomised,  controlled  phase  II  study  of  cetuximab  in  combination  with 
FOLFOX versus FOLFOX in patients with mCRC previously untreated for metastatic disease 
CA225006  (EMR  62  202-025  or  EPIC):  randomised,  controlled  phase  III  study  of  cetuximab  in 
combination  with  standard  irinotecan  versus  irinotecan  in  patients  who  had  failed  oxaliplatin-based 
therapy for metastatic disease 
Updated  PFS  and  Overall  Survival  (OS)  data  from  CRYSTAL,  OPUS  and  NCIC  and  updated  analyses 
based on KRAS status from all four studies were included in the Erbitux Product information (PI) with 
variation EMEA/H/C/000558/II/0035 (EC Decision 28 July 2010). Additional PI changes included in this 
variation were the following: the requirement for determination of the tumour’s KRAS mutation status 
prior  to  initiating  cetuximab  treatment  was  worded  more  explicitly,  a  warning  about  cardiovascular 
events  was  introduced  and  the  warning  of  increased  toxicity  in  combination  with  5-fluorouracil  was 
extended to all fluoropyrimidines.  
The  data  and  analyses  that  resulted  in  these  additional  safety  changes  and  the  analyses  based  on 
KRAS  status  had  been  requested  by  the  CHMP  as  FUM  044.  This  was  requested  following  the 
observation  that  the  combination  of  cetuximab  with  FOLFOX4  in  the  OPUS  trial  impacted  results 
negatively  in  patients  with  mutant  KRAS  tumour  status  [OS  HR:  1.290  (95%  CI:  0.873,  1.906),  PFS 
HR  1.720  (95%  CI:  1.104,  2.679),  ORR  HR  0.459  (95%  CI;  0.228,  0.924)  favouring  FOLFOX4  alone 
(over the cetuximab/FOLFOX4 combination)]. Similar results had been reported in a panitumumab trial 
in  combination  with  FOLFOX4.  In  the  course  of  the  assessment  of  FUM  044  and  further  to  CHMP 
requests for supplementary information (FU2 044.1, FU2 044.2 and the current variation application), 
the MAH submitted the results of an investigator sponsored trial, the COIN trial. 
COIN 
The  COIN  (COntinuous  chemotherapy  plus  cetuximab  or  INtermittent  chemotherapy)  study  was  an 
open-label,  multicentre,  3-arm,  randomised  (1:1:1),  controlled,  investigator-initiated  phase  III,  first-
line  trial  that  was  sponsored  by  the  UK  Medical  Research  Council  (MRC)  with  centres  in  the  United 
Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.

Methods 
Treatments 
The study comprised the following three arms: 
- Arm A: Oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine (OxFp) continuous chemotherapy in one of two regimens: 
 
OxMdG (Oxaliplatin Modified de Gramont: this regimen is similar to FOLFOX4, repeated  every  2 
weeks, IV): combination of oxaliplatin (85 mg/m² over 2 h), L-folinic acid (175 mg over 2 h), and 
bolus 5-FU (400 mg/m²) followed by a 46-h infusion of 5-FU (2400 mg/m²) 
 
XELOX  (capecitabine  (XELoda)  +  Oxaliplatin,  repeated  every  3  weeks):  combination  of  IV 
oxaliplatin (130 mg/m² over 2 h, day 1) and oral capecitabine (1000 mg/m² twice a day [b.i.d.] 
on days 1 to 14 of each cycle) 
- Arm B: continuous OxFp chemotherapy plus cetuximab administered as follows:  
Chemotherapy  was  administered  as  described  for  Arm  A  in  combination  with  infusions  of  cetuximab 
given  once  a  week  (first  infusion  400  mg/m²  over  2  h,  subsequent  infusions  250  mg/m²  over  1  h). 
Cetuximab could be continued if chemotherapy was stopped due to toxicity or patient choice but was 
to be discontinued on evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
-  Arm  C:  intermittent  OxFp  chemotherapy  was  administered  as  described  in  Arm  A  for  12  weeks 
followed by monitoring only until disease progression. Upon progression, treatment was restarted for a 
new period of 12 weeks. This arm will not be further described and discussed as not being pertinent to 
cetuximab. 
Objectives 
The study intended to compare the efficacy and safety of continuous vs intermittent oxaliplatin-based 
chemotherapy  in  first  line  treatment  of  mCRC  and  to  investigate  the  add-on  effect  of  cetuximab  to 
continuous  chemotherapy.  Continuous  chemotherapy  was  administered  in  cycles  without  interruption 
until  progression  of  disease,  unacceptable  toxicity  or  following  patient  choice.  Intermittent 
chemotherapy  was  administered  in  cycles  for  a  total  of  12  weeks  followed  by  patient  monitoring. 
Treatment was restarted for another 12 weeks upon progression of disease. 
Endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  Overall  Survival  (OS)  defined  as  the  interval  from  randomisation  to  death 
from any cause. Patients still alive at data cut-off were censored at the date last seen. 
Secondary  endpoints  included  response  and  Progression-Free  Survival  (PFS)  defined  as  the  interval 
from  randomisation  to  first  evidence  of  progression  or  death  from  any  cause.  Surviving  patients 
without progression were to be censored at the date they were last seen. 
Tumour  assessments  were  made  based  on  radiological  scans  that  were  scheduled  every  12  weeks. 
Tumour response was assessed by the investigators according to RECIST without central confirmation.

Results 
Conduct of the study 
There were two major protocol amendments: 
1)  An  interim  safety  analysis  resulted  in  an  amendment  to  the  protocol.  Patients  in  Arm  B  receiving 
XELOX (1000 mg/m² b.i.d.) plus cetuximab had significantly higher rates of grade ≥3 diarrhoea than 
those in other treatment groups: cetuximab + XELOX 30% vs XELOX 17% (p <0.001) vs, cetuximab + 
OxMdG 20%.  
The  starting  dose  of  capecitabine  for  patients  in  Arm  B  only  was  reduced  from  1000  mg/m²  b.i.d.  to 
850  mg/m²  b.i.d.  In  Arm  A,  the  capecitabine  dose  remained  unchanged  at  1000  mg/m²  b.i.d.  The 
amendment was implemented after 1775 (73%) patients had been randomised to all arms. 
2)  The  primary  endpoint  was  changed  to  address  the  new  findings  concerning  cetuximab, 
demonstrating  KRAS  mutations  to  be  a  negative  predictor  of  cetuximab  efficacy:  OS  was  ascertained 
separately in patients with wild-type KRAS tumours and in patients with mutant KRAS tumours. 
Numbers analysed 
815  patients  were  randomised  to  Arm  A  (279  to  OxMdG  and  536  to  XELOX)  and  815  patients  were 
randomised to Arm B. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population thus comprised 1630 patients.

Discussion on clinical aspects 
COIN 
Overall,  the  COIN  study  was  adequately  designed.  ORR  and  Progressive  Disease  (PD)  were  defined 
based  on  investigators’  assessment  only,  but  the  primary  endpoint  was  OS.  Tumour  assessment  by 
scans  was  undertaken  every  12  weeks  (in  MAH  sponsored  studies  every  8  week).  The  very  late 
amendment  with  respect  to  dose  reduction  of  capecitabine  is  of  note,  as  it  was  the  result  of  interim 
safety analyses showing an increased frequency of diarrhoea with the XELOX+cetuximab combination 
indicative  of  a  potential  negative  toxicity  interaction  of  cetuximab  with  XELOX  and  possibly  partly 
explaining the deviation in results between OxMdG and XELOX discussed below. 
The  study  population  appears  typical  for  studies  in  this  field,  but  the  proportions  of  patients  with 
synchronous metastasis and ‘liver and others’ metastatic sites appear high. There are no likely relevant 
imbalances between treatment arms. In contrast to MAH sponsored studies, life expectancy of at least 
12  weeks  was  not  an  inclusion  criterion  and  prior  adjuvant  therapy  could  have  been  administered  if 
completed > 1 month prior to enrolment (> 6 months in MAH sponsored studies). 
No  trend  towards  an  overall  survival  benefit  was  detected.  The  observed  median  survival  was  rather 
short  for  a  first-line  CRC  study,  about  1.5  year.  Of  importance,  compared  to  prior  results  showing  a 
negative  effect  of  cetuximab  add-on  to  FOLFOX4  in  terms  of  PFS  and  OS  (see  OPUS  trial  in  tables  8 
and 9), no negative effect was observed in case of KRAS mutation positive tumours (XELOX HR: 0.97, 
OxMdG HR: 0.99). However, in the XELOX group, there was an early separation in favour of the control 
followed by cross-over favouring the cetuximab arm (lower left panel of figure 2). This could be related 
to early treatment-related “toxic” deaths. 
A  borderline  significant  PFS  benefit  for  add-on  cetuximab  was  observed  only  in  the  OxMdG  arm.  Of 
note,  a  difference  was  observed  only  after  the  median  (upper  right  panel  of  figure  4).  In  OPUS,  a 
negative  effect  of  cetuximab  as  add-on  to  FOLFOX4  was  seen  in  patients  with  KRAS  mutant  positive 
tumours  (PFS  HR  1.7).  This  was  also  seen  in  patients  <65  years  of  age  and  in  good  performance 
status, indicating that toxicity is less likely to be the main driver behind the negative results. Of note, 
similar results were found in a panitumumab trial when panitumumab was given as add-on to FOLFOX4 
(PFS  HR  1.3)  and  in  the  CAIRO  2  trial,  where  cetuximab  was  added  to  a  bevacizumab  and  XELOX 
regimen. This apparent negative dynamic interaction between FOLFOX4 and anti-EGFR antibodies was 
16 
 
 
not confirmed in the COIN trial between cetuximab and OxMdG (similar to FOLFOX4, PFS HR 1.04) or 
XELOX  (PFS  1.08).  An  possible  explanation  could  be  that  the  COIN  study  lacked  assay  sensitivity  to 
show differences in terms of both negative add-on effects (mutant KRAS tumour patients) and positive 
add-on effects (wild type KRAS tumour patients).      
With  respect  to  ORR,  borderline  significant  favourable  effects  were  observed  in  the  wild  type  KRAS 
tumour population and of similar magnitude irrespectively of background chemotherapy. In the KRAS 
mutation positive tumour population no favourable difference in ORR was observed. 
In terms of safety, add-on cetuximab resulted in relevant increases in grade 3 diarrhoea (both arms), 
hand-foot syndrome (XELOX), rash (both arms), lethargy (both arms) and anorexia (OxMdG). A lower 
frequency of neuropathy was reported in the OxMdG arm after cetuximab add-on.  
Pooled analyses of Erbitux mCRC trials and discussion of indication 
The monotherapy indication in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based therapy and 
who are intolerant to irinotecan is not questioned. Cetuximab has shown clinically meaningful activity 
in terms of OS benefit as last-line therapy in patients with KRAS wild type tumours (NCIC trial). 
The  indication  in  combination  with  irinotecan-based  regimens  is  not  questioned  either,  as  cetuximab 
add-on  to  FOLFIRI  (folinic  acid,  5-fluorouracil,  irinotecan)  in  the  first  line  has  shown  a  meaningful 
prolongation of PFS and OS in patients with wild-type KRAS tumours, while no difference was seen in 
patients with mutant KRAS tumours (CRYSTAL trial). With regard to cetuximab add-on to irinotecan in 
irinotecan-naïve  and  oxaliplatin-exposed  patients  (second  line,  EPIC  trial),  KRAS  mutation  data  are 
considered non interpretable due to the low percentage (23%) of KRAS status ascertainment (compare 
patient numbers for the EPIC trial in the ITT, wt and mt KRAS tumour patients in tables 8 and 9). The 
study  did  not  meet  its  primary  endpoint  (OS),  but  cetuximab  showed  a  positive  PFS  effect  in  the  full 
study  population  (HR  0.7,  investigator  assessment).  Finally,  in  patients  exposed  to  oxaliplatin  and 
refractory to irinotecan, cetuximab add-on to irinotecan showed an ORR of 23% vs. 11% on cetuximab 
alone,  median  PFS  4.1  vs.  1.5  months,  p<0.001.  Thus  cetuximab  appeared  to  reverse  resistance  to 
irinotecan  which  is  from  a  mechanistic  perspective  a  very  interesting  finding.  As  cetuximab  in 
monotherapy  in  a  similar  population  has  shown  a  survival  benefit  over  best  supportive  care,  these 
results  are  also  considered  clinically  relevant.  No  KRAS  mutation  data  are  available  from  this  trial 
(BOND). 
With regard to the indication in combination with oxaliplatin-based regimens, in three (COIN, CAIRO2, 
NORDIC  VII)  out  of  four  (add.  OPUS)  studies  with  oxaliplatin-containing  chemotherapy  regimens, 
including  one  add-on  to  a  bevacizumab  containing  regimen  (CAIRO2)  and  the  not  yet  assessed 
NORDIC  VII  trial,  of  which  high  level  data  have  nevertheless  been  reported,  there  was  no  add-on 
activity of cetuximab in terms of time-related endpoints in KRAS wild type tumours. Only in OPUS was 
there a positive effect in PFS, but not OS, in patients with wild-type tumours. 
In  two  of  these  trials  (OPUS,  CAIRO2)  a  negative  add-on  effect  on  PFS  and  OS  was  seen  in  case  of 
mutant KRAS tumours. In addition, similar findings were reported in a panitumumab add-on to FOLFOX 
trial (PRIME). At least for the OPUS trial, toxicity appears highly unlikely to be the major cause for this 
apparent negative add-on effect on mutant KRAS tumours and similar findings have not been reported 
for  any  irinotecan-containing  regimen.  The  most  likely  cause  is  thus  a  negative  dynamic  interaction 
between  anti-EGFR  antibodies  and  oxaliplatin  in  KRAS-mutated  tumours.  An  unexpected  relationship 
between percentage of EGFR positive tumour cells and negative add-on activity of cetuximab has been 
observed (see table 11), but otherwise no possible explanation to the negative add-on effect has been 
identified. 
Among  the  fully  assessed  trials,  conflicting  results  have  thus  been  reported  for  OPUS  and  COIN:  in 
OPUS,  a  clinically  relevant  add-on  effect  in  terms  of  PFS  was  shown  in  wild  type  tumours,  while  a 
17 
 
negative effect was seen in KRAS mutated tumours. In COIN, a statistically marginalpositive effect was 
observed as add-on to the OxMdG regimen in wild type tumours and no negative effects were detected 
in  KRAS  mutated  tumours,  a  fact  probably  indicative  of  lack  of  assay  sensitivity.  To  what  extent 
tumour  burden  and  other  baseline  factors  contribute  to  this  cannot  be  determined,  but  it  should  be 
noticed that age above 65 is predictive of less add-on activity of cetuximab (see table 10).  
1.3.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following change to the mCRC indication (new text underlined): 
Erbitux  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)-
expressing, KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer 
 
 
in combination with chemotherapy (for details on certain regimens, see section 5.1), 
as a single agent in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based therapy and who are 
intolerant to irinotecan. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  a  restriction  to  the  indication  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  was 
necessary and the finally agreed wording is as follows (new text underlined): 
Erbitux  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)-
expressing, KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer 
 
 
in combination with irinotecan-based chemotherapy or FOLFOX4 (for details, see section 5.1), 
as a single agent in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based therapy and who are 
intolerant to irinotecan. 
The  warning  on  cardiovascular  disorders  in  SmPC  section  4.4  was  updated  based  on  the  cross-study 
subgroup analyses indicating potential negative effects in PFS and OS in patients older than 65 years 
or  with  poor  performance  status.  These  effects  had  previously  (see  Variation  EMEA/H/C/000558/ 
II/0035, EC Decision 28 July 2010) been associated with cardiovascular disorders, although no causal 
relationship  with  cetuximab  could  be  established.  Moreover,  the  warning  against  use  in  patients  with 
unknown  KRAS  tumour  status  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  and  the  related  information  in  section  5.1 
were expanded based on the updated information available. Finally, information on the interaction with 
the XELOX combination was added in section 4.5 of the SmPC.Finally, the CHMP requested the MAH to 
submit  the  results  of  the  NORDIC  VII  study  as  soon  as  possible  with  the  aim  to  reassess  the  benefit 
risk  of  the  updated  mCRC  indication  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in  light  of  these  data.  A 
condition was agreed to be added in Annex II requiring the submission of the NORDIC VII study data 
as soon as made available. 
1.4.  Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment  
As  add-on  to  irinotecan  containing  regimens,  cetuximab  has  shown  a  positive  effect  in  terms  of 
increased  ORR  and  PFS  and  in  the  first  line  trial  as  add-on  to  FOLFIRI  a  favourable  effect  on  OS  has 
been  shown.  In  the  EPIC  trial  (second  line  post-oxaliplatin  and  as  add-on  to  FOLFIRI),  designed  to 
demonstrate  a  survival  benefit,  a  beneficial  effect  in  terms  of  OS  could  not  be  shown,  but  a  positive 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
effect  in  terms  of  PFS  was  shown in the  overall  population, while  efficacy in  relation  to tumour  KRAS 
status  could  not  be  properly  assessed  due  to  the  small  number  of  patients  with  KRAS  evaluation.  In 
the last line setting (BOND trial), a meaningful prolongation in PFS was observed with the combination 
of  cetuximab  and  irinotecan,  compared  with  cetuximab  alone,  in  patients  that  were  refractory  to 
irinotecan. Overall, the findings in trials with irinotecan based regimens are considered consistent and 
favourable.     
Overall, the findings in trials with irinotecan based regimens are considered consistent and favourable. 
However,  in  patients  with  metastatic,  KRAS  wild-type  colorectal  cancer,  the  current  indication  ‘in 
combination with chemotherapy’ is too general based on current knowledge. In CAIRO2, an add-on to 
XELOX + bevacizumab study, no positive effects in terms of time-related endpoints was demonstrated. 
In this trial, clearly negative effects in patients with KRAS mutation positive tumours were seen; hence 
the assay sensitivity is not questioned. A restriction of the combination of cetuximab with oxaliplatin-
based regimens is thus warranted. With respect to such regimens and as discussed above, there is one 
trial  with  favourable  results  (OPUS)  in  KRAS  wild-type  tumours.  In  this  trial  cetuximab  was 
administered as add-on to the FOLFOX4 regimen. This is the only combination among oxaliplatin-based 
regimens  which  is  still  considered  to  be  associated  with  a  positive  benefit/risk  balance  based  on  the 
currently  available  information.  However,  the  MAH  will  submit  the  results  of  the  NORDIC  VII  trial 
(combination with the Nordic FLOX regimen) as soon as made available with a view to reassessing the 
benefit-risk balance of the restricted indication.

COVID-19 vaccine 
safety update  
COMIRNATY 
BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH 
The safety of Comirnaty is continuously monitored and safety updates are 
regularly provided to the public. This document outlines the outcomes 
from the assessment of emerging worldwide safety data carried out by 
EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) (see section 
1). It also contains high-level information from the reporting of suspected 
adverse reactions, which PRAC takes into account in its assessments (see 
section 2). 
This safety update follows the update of 11 August 2021. 
Main outcomes from PRAC's latest 
safety assessment 
No new updates to the product information are 
currently recommended. 
The safety updates are published regularly at COVID-19 vaccines: 
authorised. All published safety updates for Comirnaty are available at

COVID-19 vaccine safety update 
COMIRNATY 
Since its marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) 
on 21 December 2020 until 2 September 2021, almost 392 
million doses of Comirnaty have been administered in the 
EU/EEA1.

1.  Updates on safety assessments for 
Comirnaty 
PRAC assessed new safety data, including the latest Monthly Summary 
Safety Report (MSSR)2 from the marketing authorisation holder and data 
reported by patients and healthcare professionals to EudraVigilance (see 
section 2), during its meeting held 30 August to 2 September 2021.  
No new updates to the product information are currently recommended. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
No further update to the Comirnaty product information at present 
Myocarditis and pericarditis were added to the product information of 
Comirnaty in the side effects and warning sections, following the 
assessment by PRAC in July 20213. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions of the heart.  
PRAC has kept these conditions under close monitoring and in September 
2021 concluded that so far there is no new information on which base to 
change the current recommendation regarding the second vaccination in 
people who experienced myocarditis or pericarditis after the first dose or 
any other aspects of these side effects.  
Reminder: To help recovery and avoid complications, people must seek 
immediate medical attention and treatment if they experience 
breathlessness, a forceful heartbeat that may be irregular or (acute and 
persisting) chest pain, as these could be signs of myocarditis and 
pericarditis. 
1 The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) collects these 
exposure data from EU Member States as well as from the additional countries of the 
European Economic Area (EEA) Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.   
2 Monthly Summary Safety Reports, also referred to as pandemic summary safety 
reports, will be compiled by the marketing authorisation holders to support timely and 
continuous benefit-risk evaluations for COVID-19 vaccines used during the pandemic. 
These reports complement the submission of Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs).

COMIRNATY 
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) 
Assessment ongoing 
PRAC is assessing whether there is a risk of multisystem inflammatory 
syndrome (MIS) with COVID-19 vaccines following a report of MIS with 
Comirnaty. The case occurred in a 17-year old male in Denmark who has 
since fully recovered4. Some cases of MIS after administering this or other 
COVID-19 vaccines were reported in adults and/or from outside EU/EEA. 
Reported cases concern suspected side effects, i.e. medical events that 
have been observed after vaccination, but which are not necessarily 
related to or caused by the vaccine. 
MIS is a serious inflammatory condition affecting many parts of the body 
and symptoms can include tiredness, persistent severe fever, diarrhoea, 
vomiting, stomach pain, headache, chest pain and difficulty breathing. 
MIS is rare and its incidence rate before the COVID-19 pandemic 
estimated from 5 European countries was around 2 to 6 cases per 
100,000 per year in children and adolescents below 20 years of age and 
less than 2 cases per 100,000 per year in adults aged 20 years or above 
[data from observational studies coordinated by EMA (see section 2)]5. 
MIS has also been reported following COVID-19 disease. The Danish 
patient, however, had no history of COVID-19.  
As of 19 August 2021, one case was reported as MIS in a child after 
vaccination with Comirnaty in the EEA/EU (i.e. the case in Denmark 
described above) to EudraVigilance (for information on EudraVigilance, 
see section 2).  
PRAC will now assess the available data on MIS to determine whether the 
condition can be caused by COVID-19 vaccines and recommend whether 
any changes to the product information are needed.  
PRAC encourages all healthcare professionals to report any cases of MIS 
and other adverse events in people who have had these vaccines (for 
advice on reporting, see section 2).  
At this stage, there is no change to the current EU recommendations for 
the use of COVID-19 vaccines. 
EMA and national authorities will provide further updates as necessary6. 
2.  How safety is monitored 
As for all COVID-19 vaccines, relevant new information emerging on 
Comirnaty is collected and promptly reviewed. This is in line with the

pharmacovigilance plan for COVID-19 vaccines of the EU regulatory 
network (comprising the regulatory bodies of the EU Member States, EMA 
and the European Commission). 
Case reports of suspected side effects 
Collecting reports of medical events and problems that occur following the 
use of a medicine, and therefore might be side effects, is one of the pillars 
of the EU safety monitoring system. Healthcare professionals and 
vaccinated individuals are encouraged to report to their national 
competent authorities all suspected side effects individuals may have 
experienced after receiving a vaccine even if it is unclear whether the 
vaccine was the cause. For more information on how to report, see 
Reporting suspected side effects. 
These spontaneous reports are collected in EudraVigilance, the EU 
database used for monitoring and analysing suspected side effects. 
Publicly available information can be accessed via EudraVigilance – 
European database of suspected drug reaction reports in all EU/EEA 
languages. Search for “COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine PFIZER-BIONTECH 
(Tozinameran)” to see all suspected side effect cases reported for 
Comirnaty. 
As of 2 September 2021, a total of 302,517 cases of suspected side 
effects with Comirnaty were spontaneously reported to EudraVigilance 
from EU/EEA countries; 4,714 of these reported a fatal outcome7,8. By the 
same date almost 392 million doses of Comirnaty had been given to 
people in the EU/EEA9.  
These reports describe suspected side effects in individuals, i.e. 
medical events observed following the use of a vaccine. The fact 
that someone has had a medical issue or died after vaccination 
does not necessarily mean that this was caused by the vaccine. 
This may have been caused, for example, by health problems not 
related to the vaccination.  
The EU regulatory network continuously monitors EudraVigilance to detect 
any new safety issues. EudraVigilance relies on individual healthcare 
professionals and patients to report their own experience. The monitoring 
detects unusual or unexpected patterns in the reports received for further 
investigation and risk assessment. EMA’s detailed assessments take into 
7 These figures have been calculated excluding cases reported from Northern Ireland (EU 
reporting requirements for suspected adverse reactions to EudraVigilance apply to 
Northern Ireland in accordance with the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland). 
8 Source: EudraVigilance. These figures cannot be extracted directly from the public 
database of suspected adverse reactions, which groups information per type of side 
effects. As more than one suspected side effect may have been included in a single case 
report, the total number of side effects will never match the number of individual cases. 
Similarly, this public database does not provide the total number of cases reported with a 
fatal outcome.

exposure data from EU Member States as well as from the additional countries of the 
European Economic Area (EEA) Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

account all available data from all sources to draw a robust conclusion on 
the safety of the vaccine. These data include clinical trial results, reports 
of suspected side effects in EudraVigilance, epidemiological studies 
monitoring the safety of the vaccine, toxicological investigations and any 
other relevant information. 
Planned and ongoing studies 
The company that markets Comirnaty will continue to provide results from 
the main clinical trial, which is ongoing for up to two years. It will also 
conduct additional studies to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the 
vaccine as it is used in vaccination campaigns and other clinical practice. 
For the list of planned and ongoing safety studies for Comirnaty, see the 
risk management plan.  
A paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for Comirnaty is in place. This 
describes how the company collects data on the vaccine’s efficacy and 
safety for its use in children.  
In addition, EMA is coordinating observational studies in EU Member 
States looking at real-world data from clinical practice to monitor the 
safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including in pregnant 
women. 
3.  Other information for Comirnaty 
Comirnaty is a vaccine that was authorised in the EU on 21 December 
2020 to prevent COVID-19 when infected with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-
2. COVID-19 is a potentially severe disease that may result in death. The 
initial marketing authorisation was for use in people aged 16 years and 
older; on 31 May 2021, the marketing authorisation was extended to use 
in individuals aged 12 years and older.  
Comirnaty contains a molecule called mRNA, which the body uses to 
temporarily produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The mRNA is broken 
down shortly after vaccination. The spike protein does not cause COVID-
19.  
Before Comirnaty was granted an EU marketing authorisation, the efficacy 
and safety of the vaccine were assessed through pre-clinical studies and 
large clinical trials. More than 18,000 participants had been given the 
vaccine in clinical trials.  
Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not 
everybody will experience them. The most common side effects known for 
Comirnaty are usually mild or moderate and get better within a few days 
after vaccination. 
More information on how Comirnaty works and its use is available in all 
EU/EEA languages in the medicine overview. This includes information on

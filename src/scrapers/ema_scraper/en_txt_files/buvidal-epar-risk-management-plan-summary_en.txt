Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Buvidal 
(buprenorphine) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Buvidal. The RMP details important risks 
of Buvidal, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
the risks and uncertainties (missing information) of Buvidal. 
The summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for Buvidal and its package leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Buvidal should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Buvidal should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of the RMP for 
Buvidal. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Buvidal is authorised for treatment of opioid dependence within a framework of medical, social and 
psychological treatment. Buvidal is intended for use in adults and adolescents aged 16 years or 
over (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains buprenorphine as the active substance and it is 
given by subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of the benefits of Buvidal can be found in the Buvidal 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage.  
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Buvidal, together with measures to minimise such risks for learning more about 
the risks of Buvidal, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL 
and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of important risks 
Important risks of Buvidal are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Buvidal. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Injection site reactions 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Based on safety data collected during the clinical development 
to the medicine 
programme, mild to moderate injection site reactions were 
commonly observed. The majority of all injection site reactions 
reported post-marketing are non-serious. However, a few serious, 
reactions of injection site ulceration, injection site necrosis and 
 
 
 
injection site abscess have been reported post-marketing. 
However, injection site reactions are not considered to impact the 
risk-benefit balance of the product, as adverse reactions are mostly 
mild to moderate and transient.  
Injection site reactions could potentially be minimised by using the 
correct administration technique, as described in the SmPC for 
Buvidal and ensuring that the product is not injected intradermally. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No risk factors or risk groups for injection site reactions have been 
identified for Buvidal. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures 
SmPC section 6.6 and PL Instructions for use 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
None 
Important identified risk: Use in patients with severe respiratory insufficiency 
Evidence for linking the risk 
The increased risk of respiratory depression with buprenorphine is 
to the medicine 
described in scientific literature, but clinically less significant 
compared to other full agonist opioids, due to the partial agonist 
properties of buprenorphine. It is logical to assume this risk would 
be increased in patients with severe underlying respiratory 
insufficiency. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with severe respiratory insufficiency or patients at risk of 
CNS depression, e.g. taking large quantities of alcohol or taking 
benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal.

Important identified risk: Use in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
Evidence for linking the risk 
The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of 
to the medicine 
buprenorphine were evaluated in a post-marketing study of 
another buprenorphine product. Plasma levels of buprenorphine 
were found to be higher in patients with moderate and severe 
hepatic impairment in that study. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment could be at 
increased risk.

Important identified risk: Use in patients with acute alcoholism or delirium tremens 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Buprenorphine-related deaths in patients on opioid agonist therapy 
to the medicine 
have occurred when buprenorphine was taken in combination with 
other substances, especially alcohol 
Risk factors and risk groups

Important identified risk: Concomitant use of other medications (Cytochrome P 3A4 
[CYP3A4] inhibitors; benzodiazepines; other central nervous system depressants; and 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOI]; and serotonergic medicinal products) 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Based on the knowledge of use of other buprenorphine products, 
to the medicine 
buprenorphine should not be taken together with alcohol and 
should be used cautiously together with benzodiazepines, other 
CNS depressants, opioid analgesics, naltrexone, MAOI, serotonergic 
medicinal products, and CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with HIV (receiving protease inhibitors like ritonavir, 
nelfinavir or indinavir, which are CYP3A4 inhibitors); patients with 
fungal infections (receiving azole antifungals); patients with 
anxiety or other psychiatric disorders receiving benzodiazepines, 
certain antidepressants, MAOI, serotonergic medicinal products, or 
neuroleptics; patients with allergic disorders receiving sedative H1-
receptor antagonists; patients with acute or chronic pain treated 
with certain analgesics that lead to CNS depression. 
All patients receiving multiple concomitant medications, such as 
severely ill or elderly.

None 
Important identified risk: Overdose 
Evidence for linking the risk 
From the current knowledge on buprenorphine and Buvidal, it is 
to the medicine 
anticipated that the risk of overdose (associated primarily with 
respiratory depression) is lower with buprenorphine (which is an 
opioid partial agonist/antagonist) than with full agonist opioid 
agents and will be even lower with this formulation compared to 
 
 
sublingual buprenorphine formulations, as Buvidal will be 
administration by healthcare professionals only. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The risk of serious adverse events such as overdose is greater if 
the patient is under-treated with buprenorphine and continues to 
self-medicate with opioids, alcohol or other sedatives and hypnotics 
(in particular benzodiazepines) in order to prevent withdrawal 
symptoms.

Information: 
The product is intended to be administered by healthcare 
professionals only. The secondary packaging for weekly and 
monthly products will be in different colours. In addition, the 
 
 
different doses will be differentiated by different colours on the 
secondary packaging.

Important potential risk: Use in patients with various disease states (renal impairment; 
head injuries; increased intracranial pressure; hypotension; prostatic hypertrophy; and 
urethral stenosis) 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Opioids may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be 
to the medicine 
used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, 
other circumstances where cerebrospinal pressure may be 
increased, or in patients with a history of seizure. Opioids have 
been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure. Buprenorphine 
as an opioid should therefore be used with caution in patients with 
dysfunction of the biliary tract. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with these various (underlying) disease states (renal 
impairment; head injuries; increased intracranial pressure; 
hypotension; prostatic hypertrophy; and urethral stenosis).

Important potential risk:  Concomitant use of gabapentinoids 
Evidence for linking the risk 
There have been reports of gabapentinoids being misused, with 
to the medicine 
subsequent development of dependence, in particular in patients 
with opioid dependence. The concomitant use of pregabalin or 
gabapentin and opioids are of concern as the respiratory 
depressive effects might be exacerbated and increase the risk for 
overdose deaths. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with anxiety or other psychiatric disorders, epilepsy, or 
neuropathic pain receiving treatment with gabapentinoids for these 
indications, or patients misusing gabapentinoids.

are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

This is a phase 3 randomized, open-label, 
multicenter study designed to assess the efficacy, 
safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of isatuximab in 
combination with pomalidomide and low-dose 
dexamethasone (IPd) compared with pomalidomide 
and low-dose dexamethasone (Pd) in patients with 
refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple 
myeloma.

should be given to the use of a validated isatuximab-
specific immunofixation (IFE) assay to distinguish 
isatuximab from any remaining endogenous M protein in 
the patient’s serum, in order to facilitate determination of a 
complete response.

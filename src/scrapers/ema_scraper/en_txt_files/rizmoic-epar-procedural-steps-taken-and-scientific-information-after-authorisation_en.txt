SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II, Labelling 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Rizmoic in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. Amendments to 
annexes I, II and III were made to implement changes in 
line with the SmPC guideline and the current QRD 
template. Removal of black triangle sign from the annexes 
following five years of authorisation. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Results of in vitro study S-297995-PF-360-N did not 
report from non-clinical study S-297995-PF-360-N 
submitted as agreed in the letter of recommendation 
to CHMP: In-vitro data determining whether 
naldemedine inhibits in a time dependent manner 
the OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT3 
transporters. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
demonstrate significant inhibitory effect of S-297995 
monotosylate on the in vitro transporter activity of 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, or OAT3 in the tested 
concentrations (max concentration=10 μmol/L). 
There¬fore, Naldemedine administered in the attended 
amount of 200 µg is not expected to affect the 
pharmacokinetics of co-administered drugs that are 
substrates of these transporters.

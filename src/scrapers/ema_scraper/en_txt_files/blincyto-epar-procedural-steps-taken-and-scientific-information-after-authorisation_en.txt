In clinical studies of adult ALL patients treated with 
BLINCYTO, less than 2% tested positive for anti-
blinatumomab antibodies. Of patients who developed anti-
blinatumomab antibodies, the majority had in vitro 
neutralizing activity. No anti blinatumomab antibodies were 
detected in clinical studies of paediatric patients with 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

relapsed or refractory ALL treated with blinatumomab. 
Anti-blinatumomab antibody formation may affect the 
pharmacokinetics of BLINCYTO. 
Overall, the totality of clinical evidence supports the finding 
that anti-blinatumomab antibodies are not suggestive of 
any clinical impact on the safety or effectiveness of 
BLINCYTO.

antibody blinatumomab versus standard of care 
chemotherapy in adult subjects with 
relapsed/refractory b-precursor acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL). The RMP (version 7.0) has been 
updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
blinatumomab versus standard of care chemotherapy in 
adult subjects with relapsed/refractory b-precursor acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The primary endpoint was 
overall survival (OS) defined as the time of randomization 
until death due to any cause. Key secondary endpoints 
included complete remission (CR), complete remission with 
partial hematologic recovery (CRh*), complete remission 
with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) and minimal 
residual disease (MRD). In this study statistically and 
clinically significant increases of primary endpoint OS and 
secondary endpoints CR/CRh*/CRi and MRD negativity 
were observed in the blinatumomab arm as compared to 
the SOC chemotherapy arm (7.7 months vs 4.0 months, 
43.9% vs 24.3%, 23.6% vs 9.0% respectively). In 
conclusion, the controlled data of the Phase 3 study 
00103311 confirmed the efficacy and safety of 
blinatumumab and the CHMP agreed on the fulfilment of 
the specific obligation.

The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on

assessed trough the parallel variation 
EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0009 and having confirmed the 
positive benefit risk balance, is of the opinion that the 
quality, safety and efficacy of this medicinal product 
continue to be adequately and sufficiently demonstrated. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considered that, as all Specific 
Obligations have been fulfilled, there are no remaining 
grounds for the marketing authorisations to remain 
conditional and therefore recommends the granting of the

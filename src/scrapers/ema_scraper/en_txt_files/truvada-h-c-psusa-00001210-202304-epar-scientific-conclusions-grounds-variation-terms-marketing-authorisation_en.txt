Scientific conclusions
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for emtricitabine / tenofovir 
disoproxil, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows: 
In view of available data on bone mineral density decrease from clinical trials, the literature, 
spontaneous reports, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between emtricitabine / tenofovir 
disoproxil and bone mineral density decrease is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC also 
considered that the current warning/precaution on Bone effects should be further strengthened. The 
PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil 
should be amended accordingly.
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and 
grounds for recommendation.
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing emtricitabine / tenofovir 
disoproxil is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

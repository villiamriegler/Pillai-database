Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 6/177 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Not applicable. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products. 
Applicant’s request for consideration 
The assessment of the current application includes an assessment of the applicant’s claim that Liumjev 
does not fall within the scope of Article of Article 82(1) of Reg 726/2004 due to significant differences in 
safety and efficacy related to difference in excipients between Liumjev and Humalog that shares the same 
qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of active substance and the same pharmaceutical form 
and for which the Applicant holds a marketing authorisation.  
Scientific advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice on 23 June 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/3333/1/2016/III) and on 23 
February 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/3491/1/2017/I) for the development programme in question. The Scientific 
Advice pertained to the following Quality, Non-clinical and Clinical aspects: 
•  Acceptability of treprostinil as an excipient in the context of the developed formulation 
•  Sufficiency of proposed physicochemical and biochemical tests to establish comparability after 
change of the drug substance manufacturing process without the need for non-clinical or clinical 
studies 
•  Adequacy not to conduct rodent carcinogenicity studies given the minimal systemic treprostinil 
exposure with the intended therapeutic use and the inherently low carcinogenic potential of 
treprostinil 
•  Acceptability not to conduct a juvenile animal toxicity study based on the minimal systemic 
treprostinil exposure expected and the absence of reproductive and developmental toxicity in 
nonclinical studies of marketed treprostinil containing medicinal products 
•  Acceptability not to conduct PK studies in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment, 
drug-drug-interaction or a thorough QT study based on the proposed clinical pharmacology plan 
characterising PK and PD differences between established and new insulin lispro formulations

•  Agreement that clinical pharmacology studies assessing the PK of the treprostinil excipient in 
special populations or drug-drug interaction studies are not required 
•  Adequacy of the proposed Phase 3 study plans to support benefit/risk assessment in patients with 
Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus using either a multiple dose insulin (MDI) or insulin pump 
(CSII) with a focus on the proposed primary efficacy endpoint, comparator use, definition of the 
study population, duration of studies and timing of injections 
•  Adequacy of the planned number of patients to be exposed in Phase 3 trials for the duration 
specified to support benefit/risk assessment at the time of MA 
•  Acceptability of the proposed primary analysis methods and non-inferiority margin for the Phase 
3 studies 
•  Adequacy of the proposed measures for type-I error control across analyses in the Phase 3 
studies 
•  Acceptability of continuous glucose monitoring (time in range) as a clinical meaningful measure of 
glucose control 
•  Acceptability of the proposed immunogenicity assessment and loss of efficacy by deterioration of 
glycaemic control as surrogate for neutralising insulin antibodies 
•  Acceptability of global enrolment plans for the Phase 3 studies 
•  Adequacy of the planned paediatric development with a view to timing of studies and 
demonstration of PK comparability to adults for both planned dose strengths (100 U/ml and 200 
U/ml)

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Chronic hyperglycaemia defines diabetes, and glycaemic control is fundamental to diabetes 
management. Improvement in long-term glucose control has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 9/177 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and progression of complications in people with type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Both 
fasting glycaemia and glycaemic excursions occurring after meals contribute to overall glycaemic burden, 
a major contributor to the microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes. According to the 
2011 International Diabetes Federation (IDF) guideline for management of post-meal glucose in diabetes, 
hyperglycaemia after meals is associated with an increased risk of micro- and macrovascular 
complications and should be addressed as part of the diabetes treatment regimen.  
2.1.2.  Clinical presentation 
Control of glycaemic excursions after meals contributes to lowering the glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 
level. As HbA1c decreases, the relative contribution of post-meal glucose control on HbA1c levels increases. 
Thus, in order to achieve recommended HbA1c targets (<7%), it is important to address post-meal 
hyperglycaemia in addition to fasting hyperglycaemia, and control of post-meal glucose levels has 
received recognition as a therapeutic target for optimising glycaemic control in people with diabetes. 
2.1.3.  Management 
In healthy individuals, approximately 50% of the total daily insulin secretion is basal insulin secretion. The 
other half of daily insulin secretion occurs postprandially. Carbohydrates absorbed from a meal cause a 
postprandial glucose elevation that triggers an acute surge of insulin from pancreas. This "first phase" of 
insulin spike, corresponding to secretion of preformed insulin from storage granules within the β cell, 
promotes peripheral utilization of the prandial nutrient load, suppresses hepatic glucose production, and 
limits postprandial glucose elevation. First-phase insulin secretion begins within 2 minutes of nutrient 
ingestion and continues for 10 to 15 minutes. This is followed by the second phase of prandial insulin 
secretion,  corresponding to  de  novo  production of  insulin,  which  is  sustained until normoglycaemia  is 
restored. 
Rapid-acting  insulin  analogues,  first  of  which  was  insulin  lispro,  were  developed  to  enable  efficient 
postprandial glucose control. Compared to regular human insulin, insulin lispro has a more rapid onset, 
higher  peak  and  shorter  duration  of  action,  which  better  fits  for  controlling  postprandial  glucose 
excursions. The daily insulin regimen is adjusted individually for every patient. Prandial insulin boluses 
are  titrated  based  on  glucose  monitoring  and  carbohydrate  content  of  the  meal  to  achieve  glycaemic 
targets. 
Even  with  rapid-acting  insulin  analogues,  efficient  control  of  postprandial  glucose  elevation  requires 
preprandial administration of insulin, optimally 15 to 20 minutes before the start of a meal, so that the 
peak insulin concentration occurs concomitantly with postprandial glucose elevation. In many instances, 
appropriate timing is not feasible; e.g. if the patient cannot anticipate the time of meal or amount of 
ingested carbohydrates. In such cases, prandial insulin is injected during or after the meal instead of 
before meal. Hence, there is need for more rapid insulin formulations than current rapid-acting analogue 
insulins such as lispro (Humalog, Liprolog, Insulin lispro Sanofi), aspart (NovoRapid), or glulisine insulin 
(Apidra). There already is on the market one ultra-rapid mealtime insulin product, Fiasp-insulin: insulin 
aspart formulation in which the addition of nicotinamide (vitamin B3) results in a faster initial absorption 
of insulin. 
Targeting postprandial glycaemia has long been identified an important target in T1D patients, for whom 
the multiple daily injection (MDI) regimen, or alternatively, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with 
external  insulin  pump,  aims  at  mimicking  physiological  insulin  secretion.  Depending  on  the  patient’s 
lifestyle, including diet and exercise, insulin formulations with various glucodynamic action profiles are 
needed. If the patient consumes large amounts of fast carbohydrate at meal, quicker action profile is 
needed from the prandial insulin than for a patient who avoids carbohydrates and prefers protein, as time 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 10/177 
 
 
 
is needed for metabolizing protein into glucose. Furthermore, actively exercising individuals may need a 
formulation that doesn’t have a prolonged hypoglycaemic effect that would hinder exercising after several 
hours of administration. 
Currently, postprandial control of glycaemia is regarded to be important for type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients 
as well, as postprandial glucose (PPG) is a key contributor to overall glycaemic control, and represents a 
primary  target  to  improve  HbA1c  levels  and,  in  turn,  to  reduce  the  micro-  and  macrovascular 
complications  of  diabetes  (Ceriello,  Monnier).  The  relative  contributions  of  PPG  and  fasting  plasma 
glucose  (FPG)  to  hyperglycaemia  vary  according  to  HbA1c  value,  with  PPG  contributing  more  in 
well-controlled individuals and FPG in those with poor control (Madsbad). According to current treatment 
standards  (American  Diabetes  Association;  Davies  et  al)  targeting  postprandial  glycaemia  is  most 
relevant for T2D patients whose individual HbA1c goals are not met despite reaching preprandial glucose 
goals. The current target for postprandial glucose peak for most non-pregnant diabetic patients is <10 
mmol/L. It is to be noted that for T2D patients, other options on controlling postprandial hyperglycaemia 
are  primary  before  starting  insulin,  such  as  SGLT2-inhibitors,  GLP-1  receptor  agonists  or  other 
increting-based therapies (Davies et al). Insulin treatment typically causes weight gain in T2D patients, 
especially  if  multiple  daily  injections  are  used.  Therefore,  MDI  regimen  is  usually  only  started  when 
glycaemia cannot be controlled with other treatment options. This often occurs when the patient has a 
long history of diabetes and already advanced deficiency in insulin secretion. 
About the product 
LY900014 is a new formulation of insulin lispro [rDNA origin], that is being developed by the Applicant as 
an  ultra-rapid  insulin,  for the treatment  of  patients with type  1 diabetes  (T1DM)  and  type 2  diabetes 
(T2DM).  The  LY900014  formulation  utilizes  2  enabling  excipients:  treprostinil  and  citrate  with 
independent mechanisms to accelerate the absorption of insulin lispro from the site of injection or infusion 
resulting in a faster insulin time-action profile and in earlier glucose lowering when compared to Humalog. 
Lilly is the marketing authorization holder (MAH) and innovator of Humalog for which the same insulin 
lispro drug substance is used. Humalog was approved in the EU in 1996. Currently this application is 
intended for use in adults; however, paediatric development is ongoing. 
Insulin lispro is an analogue protein of human insulin, obtained by recombinant DNA technology, that has 
a reverse position of the amino acids at positions 28 (lysine) and 29 (proline) on insulin’s B chain when 
compared to the natural sequence of the human insulin. This structural change renders lispro insulin less 
prone to self-association than human insulin. The relatively unstable lispro hexamers readily dissociate to 
monomer subunits (without the intermediate dimerization as human insulin); this explains why lispro 
insulin is absorbed more rapidly after subcutaneous injection than human regular insulin. Consequently, 
insulin  lispro  has  a  faster  onset  and  shorter  duration  of  glucose-lowering  action  than  human  regular 
insulin when administered subcutaneously. 
Once insulin lispro in LY900014 is absorbed into the systemic circulation, it is expected that distribution, 
action, and metabolic clearance are the same as insulin lispro in Humalog. 
The  purpose  of  development  of  LY900014  has  been  to  provide  a  faster  glucose-lowering  effect  that 
mimics more closely the physiological carbohydrate absorption profile and mealtime insulin response than 
the  currently  available  insulin  lispro  products  with  the  global  trade  names  Humalog  and  Liprolog 
(duplicate licence), without compromising the safety. On the EU market there is also Insulin lispro Sanofi, 
a biosimilar lispro insulin. 
LY900014 will be made available as a solution for SC injection or continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSII). 
LY900014 will also be available for IV use, under medical supervision. 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 11/177 
 
 
 
LY900014 will be made available in two dosage strengths: 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL. 
Effects of LY900014 on blood glucose concentration was investigated in patients with T1D, patients with 
T2D, and in healthy subjects. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Two multiple daily injection (MDI) Phase 3 studies were conducted to establish the efficacy of LY900014 
to  improve  glycaemic  control:  Study  I8B-MC-ITRM  (called ITRM  in  this  AR)  in  patients  with  T1D,  and 
Study  I8B-MC-ITRN  (called  ITRN  in  this  AR)  in  patients  with  T2D.  A  third  Phase  3  study,  Study 
I8B-MC-ITSI  (ITSI),  provides  additional  evidence  of  efficacy  when  administered  via  continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). 
A  total  of  421  healthy  subjects  and  342  patients  with  T1D  or  T2D  were  exposed  to  LY900014  in  the 
22 completed clinical pharmacology trials. Altogether 1944 patients with T1D or T2D received study drug 
(LY900014 or the active comparator Humalog) in the Phase 3 studies, of which 1165 received LY900014. 
A  paediatric  patient  PK/PD  comparing  Humalog  versus  LY900014  in  children  and  adolescents  (6  to 
<18 years) with T1D is ongoing. A Phase 3 trial is planned for 2019. The Applicant plans to submit an 
indication for children once both trials are complete. 
In the Scientific Advices (SA) on nonclinical aspects, it was agreed that treprostinil is an excipient and 
rodent 2year carcinogenicity studies and separate juvenile safety studies for treprostinil are not required. 
During the SA in 2016, the Phase 3 clinical plan was overall accepted. The CHMP stated, e.g., that the 
differences in the PK/PD should not only be statistically different, but also clinically relevant to support the 
claim  that  LY900014  is  not  a  duplicate  of  insulin  lispro.  The  non-inferiority  margin  (NIM)  for  EU  was 
advised to be 0.3% (in accordance with Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the 
treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus, CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 1, 14 May 2012) even though the 
studies were planned for the FDA to use a NIM of 0.4%. Omitting separate studies in patients with renal 
and hepatic insufficiency was accepted during SA, as insulin lispro is a well-known active substance. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Liumjev (company code: LY900014) is an ultra-rapid-acting formulation of insulin lispro developed for 
subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) use to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes 
mellitus (i.e. in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D)). 
Liumjev is presented as a solution for injection containing 100 or 200 units/mL of insulin lispro as active 
substance. Other ingredients are: glycerol, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, metacresol, sodium citrate 
dihydrate, treprostinil sodium, zinc oxide, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) 
and water for injections (WFI). 
Liumjev is available in a vial, cartridge or prefilled pen: in a 10 ml vial, in a 3 ml cartridge for use in 
re-usable pens and in a 3 ml disposable pre-filled pen injector 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL (only for 
prefilled pen). The prefilled pens where cartridges are sealed in a disposable pen injector are called the 
“KwikPen” or “Junior KwikPen”. The pen injector is designed to deliver multiple doses of variable volume 
(each KwikPen delivers 1-60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection and each Junior KwikPen delivers 
0.5 - 30 units in steps of 0.5 units in a single injection).

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Liumjev is a new formulation of insulin lispro and contains the same active ingredient (INN: insulin lispro) 
as used in the Humalog (EMEA/H/C/000088) family of products.  
Insulin lispro is a human insulin analogue produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a 
non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12) as the production organism. All the 
development of Liumjev was done with insulin lispro active substance (AS) that is currently approved in 
the EU market for use in Humalog. The information for the active substance presented in Module 3 aligns 
with the information previously provided to support the Humalog marketing authorization. 
General Information 
The active substance insulin lispro is a known active substance produced by recombinant DNA technology 
utilising a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Insulin lispro is a 2-chain peptide 
containing 51 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 5808 amu. The A-chain is composed 
of 21 amino acids and the B-chain is composed of 30 amino acids. Insulin lispro is identical in structure to 
human insulin, only differing in amino acid sequence at positions 28 and 29 of the B chain. Human insulin 
is Pro(B28), Lys(B29), whereas insulin lispro is Lys(B28), Pro(B29). As in human insulin, insulin lispro 
contains two interchain disulfide bonds and one intrachain disulfide bond. A representation of the primary 
structure of insulin lispro is shown in the Figure 1.  
Figure 1. Insulin Lispro Primary Structure 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance manufacturing process consists of a fermentation process stage and a purification 
process stage. The fermentation broth is harvested, homogenized, and the gene product is isolated.  
The purification process for insulin lispro is divided into several processing steps of initial purification, 
enzymatic transformation, final purification, and crystallization.  
The active substance manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail and supported by flow 
charts. The critical process parameters (CPPs) and intermediate specifications for the purification and 
fermentation processes are clearly indicated and are acceptable. Information regarding composition of 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 13/177 
 
 
 
 
 
media, materials and equipment used, column/membrane regeneration/cleaning procedures and column 
lifetime is considered sufficient.  
Manufacturing process development, control strategy and process validation 
The control strategy for the insulin lispro process is based on a planned set of controls to ensure active 
substance product quality. Based upon risk assessments, process characterization and development, 
studies were performed to investigate parameters within, and beyond, ranges specified in the 
commercial-scale manufacturing batch records. The general approach to process development and 
determination of the overall control strategy is considered acceptable. Based on the development results 
presented, the proposed proven acceptable ranges (PAR) for the CPPs are considered supported and 
justified. 
Process validation (PV) batches are manufactured using the registered process at the intended 
manufacturing scale and using qualified equipment. The fermentation, isolation and purification process 
steps are validated including several batches. The results obtained were within the established specified 
limits for all applicable critical process parameters, intermediate specifications, and active substance 
specifications. Furthermore, removal of process related impurities was validated. Data from several 
active substance process validation batches were collected and all parameters met the established 
comparability limits. The overall validation data are clearly presented and acceptable. It can be concluded 
that the active substance manufacturing process is consistent and operates within the established 
parameters. 
Control of materials and cell banking system 
Raw materials used during the active substance manufacturing are considered satisfactory for use in the 
commercial active substance manufacturing process.  
The MCB and first WCB were cryopreserved. The requirements of the cell banks were accepted in the MAA 
of Humalog in 1996 and the insulin lispro has been produced using these cell banks ever since. A protocol 
is in place for generating future working cell banks. 
Characterisation 
Insulin lispro is a compendial active substance with a well-known structure. The structural elucidation 
work was performed and was repeated when the active substance purification process was changed. In 
addition, several independent in vitro assays were conducted to analyse the functional activity of the 
active substance. These assays also showed that biological activity of the active substance was not 
altered upon introducing some changes to the purification process. The characterisation studies 
presented are considered acceptable. Furthermore, purity and impurities were also addressed in 
compliance with the requirements of Ph. Eur. monograph no. 2085 “insulin lispro”. Particular attention 
was made to identification and removal of AS-like variants and process-related impurities (potentially) 
introduced during the active substance manufacturing process. These impurities are shown to be reduced 
to acceptable low levels. 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, 
and container closure 
Specification  
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 14/177 
 
 
 
 
 
The specification of insulin lispro active substance has been established based on its respective Ph. Eur. 
monograph no. 2085 “insulin lispro” and relevant ICH guidelines, quality of the active substance used in 
toxicological and clinical testing, active substance stability, and analytical method variability. 
The proposed tests and acceptance criteria for routine active substance release are acceptable. 
Analytical procedures 
Adequate descriptions of analytical methods, including their system suitability criteria and evaluation 
have been provided. All non-compendial analytical methods are described in sufficient detail and properly 
validated according to ICH Q2 guideline. All analytical methods are considered suitable for the control of 
the active substance. 
Batch analysis 
Results from several full-scale process validation batches of insulin lispro active substance have been 
provided in the dossier. All proposed specifications were met. Batch-to-batch consistency is also 
demonstrated across all batches.  
Reference standards 
The Applicant uses a two-tier system and has provided sufficiently detailed information on the standards 
used up to date. Each lot of Reference Standard was qualified according to a subset of release tests as well 
as additional characterisation tests. The results presented are considered satisfactory. 
Container closure system 
Insulin lispro AS is stored in Ph. Eur. Type I amber glass vials with screw-cap lids having a liner of 
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-coated silicone. Sufficient information including the description of the 
material of each component, technical drawings and compatibility have been provided.   
Stability 
The stability studies cover those attributes from the active substance specifications that are susceptible to 
change during storage and are likely to influence quality, safety and/or efficacy.  
Insulin lispro active substance should be stored frozen in tightly capped containers, which are protected 
from direct light. The analytical procedures used to test the stability-indicating parameters are the same 
as those used for batch release. The acceptance criteria for stability are the same as described in the 
active substance release specifications.  
Several process validation batches of active substance were placed on long term stability. In addition, 
accelerated stability data were generated. All long-term stability studies meet the specification limits 
through the proposed shelf life. Accelerated stability results indicate slight increases in total related 
substances. A post-approval stability protocol at long-term storage conditions is given. As no trends in the 
stability of insulin lispro is observed during the long-term stability studies, the claimed shelf-life can be 
accepted. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 15/177 
 
 
 
 
 
Liumjev finished product is a sterile finished product that is composed of insulin lispro (active substance) 
with treprostinil sodium, sodium citrate dihydrate, zinc oxide, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 
metacresol, glycerol, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) and water for 
injections (WFI). The excipients have been justified based on formulation development studies and are in 
compliance with Ph. Eur. and USP, except treprostinil which has no compendial monograph. No novel 
excipients were used. 
Liumjev is available in two concentrations 100 units/mL (U-100) and 200 units/mL (U-200). The 100 
units/mL dosage strength will be dispensed in 10 mL vials and 3 mL cartridges for assembly into prefilled 
pen injectors or packaged into blister for use with re-useable insulin pen devices. The 200 units/mL 
dosage strength will be dispensed in 3 mL cartridges for assembly into the prefilled pen injectors only.  
The product is presented as: 
•  3 mL cartridge of 3 mL nominal volume of finished product solution which is irreversibly 
assembled into a disposable pen. The KwikPen disposable injector is a multi-use fully mechanical 
device intended to deliver a dosage range between 1 and 60 U in increments of 1 unit and doses 
from 0.5 to 30 units in increments of 0.5 units. The cartridge is composed of Ph. Eur. glass type 
I closed with a halobutyl rubber plunger stopper and a sealing disk of halobutyl rubber in 
compliance with Ph. Eur.  
•  3 mL cartridge of 3 mL nominal volume of finished product solution which is to be used with 
marketed reusable Lilly pen injectors.  
•  10 mL vial containing 10 mL nominal volume of finished product solution to be administered by 
use of a syringe, a pump device or to be diluted in an infusion bag. The Ph. Eur. type I glass vials 
are closed using halobutyl elastomeric closures (stopper). The closures are secured in place using 
an aluminum/polypropylene, flip-top seal.  
Liumjev finished product involves the use of a micro-dose of treprostinil (delivered as treprostinil sodium) 
as an excipient to enhance the absorption of insulin lispro by local vasodilation, rather than an active 
pharmaceutical ingredient to elicit a systemic effect. The microdose concentration (1 μg/mL in the 
Liumjev formulation) of treprostinil is consistent in both the 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL strengths. 
Formulation development 
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) along with the critical quality attributes (CQAs) were used to 
guide the formulation stability. The formulation development strategy was to develop the Liumjev 
finished product formulation with faster insulin lispro action than Humalog Injection and with a finished 
product stability profile similar to Humalog.  
All inactive ingredients (excipients) meet compendial requirements with the exception of treprostinil 
sodium.  The choice of excipients as well as their concentrations are considered justified from a quality 
point of view. 
Manufacturing process development and comparability assessment 
Elemental impurities are monitored as required in ICH Q3D guideline. A summary of the risk assessment 
was provided. The manufacturing process development section is considered satisfactorily described. 
The Liumjev finished product critical quality attributes (CQAs) were defined early during the development 
process. Several moderate and high-risk unit operations were identified.  
Filtration and filling operations have been sufficiently presented.   
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 16/177 
 
 
 
 
 
The manufacturing process has been validated at the proposed commercial scale. 
Container closure system 
The choice of the packaging components as described above is considered justified. All primary packaging 
components comply with the relevant Ph. Eur. monographs – the dimethicone used for siliconization 
complies with the Ph. Eur. monograph on Silicone oil used as a lubricant.  
The Liumjev KwikPen 100 units/mL, Liumjev KwikPen 200 units/mL and Liumjev Junior KwikPen 100 
units/mL are dial-and-dose pen injectors, intended for SC (self-) administration of the insulin lispro 
formulation. They are all based on existing (Junior) KwikPen platforms. The KwikPen delivers 1 – 60 units 
in steps of 1 unit in a single injection, whereas the Liumjev Junior KwikPen delivers 0.5 – 30 units in steps 
of 0.5 units in a single injection. The latter is thus suitable for patients who may benefit from finer insulin 
dose adjustments. Since the Liumjev pre-filled pens are single-use, multi-dose delivery devices, there is 
no assessment by a Notified Body for CE mark.  
Sufficient design verification testing, human factors and risk assessment were performed to ensure 
proper functioning of the pre-filled pen injector device. The cartridge presentation, which is only available 
for the 100 units/mL dosage strength, is for use with Lilly re-usable pens. The dosing accuracy of the 
re-usable pens has been appropriately demonstrated.  
Microbiological attributes have been appropriately addressed in order to sustain the finished product 
sterile. Container closure integrity test for cartridge and vial has been appropriately demonstrated. 
Furthermore, metacresol is added to the formulations to inhibit microbial growth in accordance with Ph. 
Eur. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The concentrations and presentations are the same as those currently approved for Humalog in the EU. 
The Liumjev 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL concentrations development was done concurrently. The 
only differences in the concentrations are the amount of insulin lispro and zinc, all other excipient 
concentrations are the same. The vials and cartridges are manufactured in the same facilities as those 
used for Humalog and the manufacturing processes are aligned to the Lilly insulin platform. 
Batch formula has been presented for the proposed commercial scale.  
The manufacturing process description/flow chart has been sufficiently presented, describing the main 
processing steps; finished product solution preparation, bioburden reduction filtration, sterilizing filtration 
and aseptic filling in cartridges and vials. 
Process controls 
Acceptance criteria for controls are provided for the parameters/controls that have been determined to be 
critical to ensure that the CQAs are met. The criticality assessment is performed carefully during 
pharmaceutical development studies and definitions for process parameters and process controls are 
given. The microbiological control of the finished product manufacturing process has been appropriately 
addressed.  
Process validation 
The process validation (PV) was performed with several commercial scale batches and includes process 
validation, sterilisation process validation and shipping validation. PV data have been presented. 
Sufficient validation data on the pre-filled pen assembly has been provided.

Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
Specification  
Commercial specifications for insulin lispro finished product are established based on historical knowledge 
from Humalog family of products, clinical batches, formulation development, and potential risk of impact 
on CQAs with regards to patient safety, and stability of finished product.  
The specification for the finished product includes identity, potency, purity, sterility, bacterial endotoxins. 
The proposed tests and acceptance criteria are acceptable.  
The proposed specifications are considered justified and acceptable.  
Analytical procedures 
The analytical methods are validated successfully in accordance with ICH Q2 guideline. The validation 
results were acceptable and showed that the analytical methods are suitable for their intended use and 
valid for the new formulation. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analyses results of several commercial scale batches, were presented showing consistent results. 
Additional results from primary stability and clinical batches demonstrate consistency between the 
manufactured batches. 
Reference standards 
The same reference standard is used as for the analysis of the active substance. This is acceptable. 
Container closure system 
The Liumjev finished product is supplied in Type I glass cartridges and vials and prefilled pen. The 
cartridge is sealed at the bottom with an elastomeric plunger and at the top with a disc seal consisting of 
a bilayer elastomeric disc and an aluminium shell. The vials are closed with a halobutyl elastomeric 
stopper secured with an aluminum flip-top seal. 
The Liumjev pre-filled pens and Humalog pens are functionally the same. The device constituent 
components of the two pens differ only by external component colours; all internal parts are shared. The 
different components of the primary packaging comply with the corresponding Ph. Eur. requirements. In 
addition, the used elastomeric components are latex free. 
Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 24 months for the finished product is proposed. Liumjev finished product should be stored 
in a refrigerator between +2 °C and +8 °C, protected from light. After first use, it can be stored at room 
temperature protected from light for up to 28 days.  
The stability studies are conducted according to the relevant stability guidelines, ICH Q5C, ICH Q1A and 
ICH Q1B.  
Real time data is available for clinical scale batches as well as for process validation batches that are 
representative of the commercial process. The acceptable shelf life has been assessed based on the data 
presented for the primary stability batches and process validation batches given that comparability has 
been demonstrated between primary stability and process validation batches.  
Primary stability studies used a commercially representative manufacturing process.  
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 18/177 
 
 
 
In-use stability testing is performed with batches at multiple time points during the real-time storage. The 
data supports the storage of the in-use finished product (after the disc seal has been punctured) 
unrefrigerated for up to 28 days at a maximum temperature of 30°C for pen injectors and 9 days in a 
pump reservoir.  
In photostability testing, the product was demonstrated to be light sensitive and hence the product should 
be protected from light. The secondary packaging was proven sufficient to protect the product from light. 
At the recommended storage (real-time) condition of 2°C to 8°C, all available results have remained 
within the proposed shelf life acceptance criteria. Based on the primary stability data, as well as the 
supporting stability studies, the claimed shelf life of 24 months is acceptable for the cartridge and vial 
presentations. The claimed after first use shelf life of up to 28 days when stored at room temperature and 
protected from light is also acceptable. 
Chemical, physical in-use stability after dilution with dextrose 50 mg/ml or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml 
solutions for the vial presentation has been demonstrated for 14 days at 2–8 °C and 28 hours at 20-25 °C 
when protected from light. From a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used 
immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the 
responsibility of the user and would not normally be longer than 24 hours at 2-8 °C, unless dilution has 
taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. For pump devices it is recommended to change 
the Liumjev U-100 in the pump reservoir at least every 9 days. 
Medical device  
The 3 mL cartridges are assembled in prefilled pen injectors (U-100 with 1-unit and 0.5-unit increments; 
U-200 with 1-unit increments) using the same injector device platform as the finished products Humalog 
and Basaglar. A detailed description of the pens and device constituents has been provided. The device 
constituent components were developed and evaluated according to procedures that comply with the 
design control principles required by EN ISO 13485:2016 (“Medical devices – Quality Management 
Systems – Requirements for regulatory purposes”). 
Device performance and compliance to ISO 11608-1:2014 (“Needle-based injection systems for medical 
use – Requirements and test methods – Part 1: Needle-based injection systems”) was assessed for 
system designation C. 
Sufficient biocompatibility testing, design verification testing (including design differentiation), risk 
management and human factors evaluation were performed according to the relevant ISO norms to 
ensure proper functioning of the device. 
Adventitious agents 
Considering that the manufacturing takes place in E. coli, no formal viral clearance studies are needed. 
A TSE Declaration has been provided stating that no materials of animal origin are utilized in the insulin 
lispro active substance manufacturing process or in the manufacture of the finished product. 
The adventitious agents safety evaluation is considered satisfactory. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Liumjev finished product supplied in 10 mL vials and 3 mL cartridges is intended for SC and IV 
administration. The formulation differs from Humalog with the functional active excipients. The excipients 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 19/177 
 
 
 
 
meet the requirements of Ph. Eur., USP and NF except for treprostinil, which has been described more 
carefully and in adequate detail. The cartridges are used in combination with a disposable pen (integrated 
drug-device combination) or in combination with reusable pen injectors. Vials may be used for continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion with insulin pumps. For infusion administration, vials can be diluted in 
dextrose 50 mg/mL or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL solutions. 
The overall quality documentation provided for Liumjev in the marketing authorisation application is of 
adequate quality. No major objections were identified during the assessment. There is a good control 
strategy in place to guarantee consistent quality of the finished product. The overall quality of Liumjev is 
considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In conclusion, based on the review of the data provided, marketing authorisation application for Liumjev 
is considered approvable from a quality point of view. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended some points for further investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacology data of insulin lispro available as a part of the development of Humalog is used to 
bridge  the  pharmacology  data  of  LY900014.  The  concentration  of  active  substance  is  identical  to 
Humalog, with the addition of two excipients, sodium citrate and treprostinil, which aim at accelerating 
the  absorption  at  the  site  of  injection  by  increasing  blood  vessel  permeability  (sodium  citrate)  and 
vasodilatation (treprostinil). LY900014 contains 1 µg/ml treprostinil and 15 mM sodium citrate, as well as 
5 mM MgCl2, the other excipients are similar between Humalog and LY900014 (with the exception of 
Dibasic sodium phosphate heptahydrate present only in Humalog). All non-clinical studies conducted with 
insulin lispro alone (prior to 1996) have been previously reviewed during the initial marketing application 
for Humalog. No separate pharmacology studies have been conducted with LY900014, but the effects on 
plasma glucose levels in comparison to that of Humalog was measured as part of a PK/PD study in diabetic 
swine model. 
New  pharmacology  data  included  the  primary  pharmacodynamics  studies  of  the  effects  of  citrate 
(transendothelial cell transport and vascular permeability) and treprostinil (local changes in blood flow) 
alone or in combination with insulin lispro (evaluation of the accelerated time of action of the glucose 
lowering effect), and safety pharmacology studies with treprostinil alone. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The bioavailability, bioeffectiveness, and mechanisms of action of insulin lispro were assessed as part of 
development of Humalog in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. The total glucodynamic effects of 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 20/177 
 
 
 
insulin lispro were indistinguishable from human insulin after subcutaneous administration in rats, dogs, 
rabbits and pigs. The pharmacodynamics of insulin lispro is well known and is same in LY900014, only the 
onset of the effects are expected be different due to the new formulation. 
LY900014 includes two excipients treprostinil and sodium citrate (henceforth ‘citrate’), with independent 
mechanisms to accelerate the absorption of insulin lispro resulting in a faster insulin time-action profile 
when  compared  to  Humalog.  Treprostinil  is  a  prostacyclin  analogue  that  increases  blood  flow  at  the 
injection/infusion site through local vasodilation. Citrate promotes vascular permeability. The effects of 
citrate  were  assessed  in  vitro  in  the  transendothelial  cell  transport  assay  and  in  vivo  in  the  vascular 
permeability assay in rats. Transport of insulin lispro across the human dermal microvascular endothelial 
cell layer was increased in the presence of citrate alone (15 mM, 25 mM or 35 mM) or citrate (25 mM or 
35 mM) and 5 mM MgCl2 together in comparison to the PBS buffer control. The increase in transport was 
1.9-fold with 35 mM citrate. In in vivo rat vascular permeability assay (Miles assay) it was demonstrated 
that 25 mM citrate significantly enhanced vascular permeability. Local changes in blood flow due to SC 
injection of treprostinil were assessed in rats using dermal Laser Doppler Imaging. In this assay, it was 
demonstrated that 0.1 ng - 40 µg treprostinil induced local vasodilatation. 
The  proof  of  concept  of  function  of  sodium  citrate  and  treprostinil  excipients  to  facilitate  the  faster 
lowering of plasma glucose levels was demonstrated in the studies in diabetic miniature Yucatan swine. 
Due  to  similarities  of  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue of  miniature  swine  and  humans,  diabetic  (alloxan 
treated-insulin  deficient)  miniature  Yucatan  swine  is  considered  a  representative  model  to  determine 
efficacy,  potency,  and  time  of  action  for  subcutaneously  delivered  insulin  molecules/mixtures.  Study 
DBT253  was  conducted  with  the  final  commercial  formulation  of  LY900014  (Figure  2  and  Table  1). 
Lowering  of  the  serum  glucose  levels  was  rapid  after  the  SC  administration  of  LY900014.  LY900014 
lowered the plasma glucose levels significantly faster at early time points i.e. 10 and 15 minutes, with 
p=0.0001  and  p=5.76E10-05,  respectively,  compared  to  Humalog.  After  30  minutes,  the  effects  of 
LY900014 and Humalog on lowering of the glucose levels were similar.

following SC dosing); comparative study with insulin lispro and LY900014.

Table 1. Average serum glucose change from baseline of diabetic swine treated with Humalog or 
LY900014. 
The additional in vivo data in swine treated with insulin lispro with various concentrations of sodium 
citrate with/without treprostinil was in line supporting the hypothesis of faster glucose lowering effect of 
the novel formulation components in comparison to Humalog.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamics studies were not conducted with LY900014. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology studies including cardiovascular, respiratory, renal and central nervous system 
effects for insulin lispro were conducted as part of Humalog’s non-clinical development. The observed 
effects were comparable to those produced by human insulin. No safety pharmacology studies have been 
performed with LY900014. 
The  safety  pharmacology  studies  of  treprostinil  excipient  included  GLP  compliant  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
studies.  In  vitro  hERG  and  in  vivo  cardiovascular  safety  pharmacology  studies  caused  QT/QTc 
prolongation in dogs. These results are in line with previously reported findings in dogs and humans, and 
are not due to blockade of hERG but an artefact of the rapidly changing heart rate that occurs in response 
to decreased blood pressure from treprostinil (Tyvaso, 2017). The NOEL for cardiovascular effects in the 
dog studies was 4 µg/kg (49.4x the Cmax of the highest tested treprostinil dose of 1500 ng in human 
subjects). The cardiovascular effects at the higher doses (≥0.015 mg/kg) noted in the dog studies is 
unlikely cause for a safety concern for patients with diabetes; the microdoses of treprostinil is used in 
LY900014 (≤5 ng/kg, 3 times daily). The CNS/neurobehavioral safety profile of treprostinil was assessed 
in rats as part of the 3 months repeated dose toxicity study. Neurological (CNS/behavioural evaluation 
and body temperature measurements) and respiratory examinations following a single SC injection of 
treprostinil  did  not  show  any  important  changes  in  CNS  or  respiratory  function  (investigated  by 
plethysmography) at doses up to 0.1 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. In the Functional Observation 
Battery (FOB) tests, treprostinil did not induce neurobehavioural effects. The NOELs for respiratory and 
CNS endpoints were 0.1 and 0.03 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
Assessment report

From the non-clinical perspective, no further action is necessary with respect to safety pharmacology. The 
potential for adverse safety pharmacological events at clinical treprostinil doses is considered unlikely. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were not conducted with LY900014. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
As part of the Humalog submission, a series of studies to analyse the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro 
was performed. The pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro were studied in both rats and dogs. These studies 
are not re-evaluated in this data review. Insulin lispro’s pharmacokinetics is well known; it is rapidly 
absorbed  and  degraded  to  small  peptide  fragments  and  amino  acids.  After  absorption,  the  active 
substance insulin lispro behaves in the same way as with Humalog. New pharmacokinetic studies include 
combined  PD/PK  study  evaluating  effects  of  various  fast  acting  LY900014  formulations  in  diabetic 
Yucatan  miniature  swine,  and  the  ADME  and  toxicokinetic  studies  with  treprostinil  as  part  of  the 
repeated-dose  and  embryofetal  developmental  toxicity  studies  in  rat,  dog  and  rabbit.  The  ADME 
characteristics  of  other  excipients  citrate  and  magnesium  chloride  were  not  evaluated,  as  these  are 
approved pharmaceutical excipients. 
Validated  bioanalytical  LC-MS/MS  methods  were  used  to  measure  treprostinil  in  toxicokinetic 
evaluations. Qualified “fit for purpose” radioimmunoassay method was used to quantify total insulin in 
plasma of diabetic swine. 
Absorption 
The proof of concept of a more rapid absorption of insulin lispro in LY900014 in comparison to Humalog 
was shown in vivo in miniature Yucatan diabetic swine in the PD/PK single dose studies. Subcutaneous 
delivery of LY900014 commercial formulation resulted in faster absorption of insulin lispro in diabetic 
swine  in  comparison  to  Humalog.  The  mean  early  50%  tmax  decreased  from  29.7  minutes  (Humalog 
group) to 12.9 minutes (LY900014 group), with a p-value of 0.0002. The mean late 50% tmax decreased 
from  169  minutes  (Humalog  group)  to  129  minutes  (LY900014  group),  with  a  p-value  of  0.011. 
Consistent with faster absorption of insulin lispro, a more rapid decrease in plasma glucose levels (within 
5 - 15 minutes) with LY900014 was demonstrated. 
Absorption of treprostinil was analysed in rats after a single 0.4 mg/kg SC and 0.2 mg/kg IV dose of 
[14C]treprostinil. [14C]treprostinil was rapidly absorbed with a tmax of 0.25 hours. The mean systemic 
exposure  of  treprostinil  accounted  for  37%  of  the  circulating  radioactivity  after  both  SC  and  IV 
administrations. The half-life (t1/2) for treprostinil was less than 2 hours after SC dosing. 
Distribution 
The tissue distribution of LY900014 or insulin lispro in the novel formulation including treprostinil and 
sodium citrate, was not studied. It is expected that the presence of the excipients treprostinil and sodium 
citrate would not change the rapid clearance of insulin lispro by the liver and kidney, or affect the overall 
tissue  distribution  of that known  for  Humalog.  No  studies  were  conducted  to  address  plasma protein 
binding and placental transfer of insulin lispro, LY900014 or treprostinil, and are not required. 
Treprostinil was widely distributed in tissues and organs in male pigmented and non-pigmented rats. 
Highest amounts of treprostinil-related radioactivity were detected at the dosing site, plasma and the 
clearing  tissues  liver  and  kidney.  This  distribution  pattern  is  not  considered  to  change  the  LY900014 
distribution  in  comparison  to  Humalog.  Treprostinil  does  not  bind  to  melanin.  Elimination  was  near 
complete by 48 hours post dose. High treprostinil exposure was achieved in rats, rabbits, and dogs with 
Assessment report

high margin of safety for clinical microdoses (NOAELs 462-fold to 1121-fold in rats and dogs, 1452-fold 
in rabbits). Exposure increased dose proportionally. No accumulation was observed. 
Metabolism 
The metabolic pathways are known for LY900014’s active ingredient insulin lispro, which is a biological 
pharmaceutical and is degraded to small peptides and amino acids. No further studies are required with 
LY900014 alone. The earlier data of metabolic profiling of treprostinil (Remodulin) was investigated in 
bile collected from rats given single, oral and IV 200 μg/kg doses of [3H]-treprostinil. The chemical data 
and  the  in  vivo  data  from  the  rat,  dog  and  human  confirmed  that  treprostinil  is  a  chirally  pure  drug 
substance and does not undergo chiral inversion in vivo, and undergoes extensive metabolism to more 
polar compounds. 
Metabolite  profiling  was  conducted  in  rat  and  human  hepatocytes  in  vitro  following  incubation  with 
[14C]treprostinil  for  up  to  4  hours,  and  in  vivo  in  rats  following  a  single  SC  0.4  mg/kg  dose  of 
[14C]treprostinil. The major treprostinil metabolism pathways involved oxidation at various sites on the 
molecule, including a combination of hydroxylation and dehydrogenation. Treprostinil was extensively 
metabolised;  26  metabolites  were  detected  in  vitro  and  22  in  vivo.  The  major  in  vivo  metabolism 
pathways for treprostinil in rats were similar to those observed in vitro. All metabolites found in human 
hepatocytes were identified in rat hepatocytes. In human hepatocytes, the major metabolites were M7, 
M18 and M2 (16%, 9%, and 9%, respectively). The major metabolites were M18 and M17 (49% and 
10%, respectively) in vitro in rat hepatocytes and M18 (18%), M10 (12%), M3 (10%), M21 (7%) and 
M15 (5%) in vivo (rats). Although the metabolism was studied only in rats and no data were presented 
from the other toxicity species i.e. rabbits and dogs, the data provided are considered sufficient due to 
the existing knowledge of the inter-species comparative metabolism. 
Although  not  examined  in  these  experiments,  treprostinil  has  been  shown  be  a  major  substrate  for 
CYP2C8 and to a minor extent CYP2C9 in vitro. 
Excretion 
No  new  excretion  studies  were  conducted  with  LY900014  or  insulin  lispro.  Insulin  lispro  undergoes 
extensive proteolysis into small peptide fragments and amino acids. In rats, the majorityof the insulin 
lispro was eliminated via the urine (78.7%), with a minor amount eliminated via the faeces (3.77%). The 
major route of treprostinil excretion was hepatobiliary/faecal elimination of metabolites. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions  
Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were not conducted. Studies are not warranted for recombinant 
proteins  per  ICH  S6(R1).  No  interactions  are  expected  with  treprostinil  due  to  its  low  plasma 
concentrations, and hence no pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies are warranted. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
A  full  nonclinical  safety  programme  was  conducted  for  insulin  lispro  to  support  the  marketing 
authorisation  for  Humalog  (in  1996).  Findings  were  related  to  the  mode  of  action  or  exaggerated 
pharmacology of insulin, and no findings of toxicological concern were observed. 
New toxicology studies with insulin lispro evaluated the injection site tolerability of Humalog (insulin lispro 
solution,  injection)  and  Remodulin  (treprostinil  injection,  solution),  alone  or  in  combination  (a 
representative Phase 1 formulation) by SC injection to rats. Other new toxicity studies are focused on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020

evaluation of the safety of treprostinil excipient alone and include repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats 
and dogs, fertility studies in rats, embryo-foetal studies in rats and rabbits, and a pre- and postnatal 
development study in rats. 
LY900014 includes treprostinil, sodium citrate and magnesium chloride as excipients. Sodium citrate and 
magnesium chloride are common excipients and require no further safety studies in amounts used in the 
LY900014 formulation. Treprostinil’s safety was assessed extensively in the preclinical species. 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were conducted for LY900014 or treprostinil. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
No specific repeated dose toxicity studies have been conducted with LY900014, as studies have been 
conducted with Humalog. In chronic toxicity studies with insulin lispro, lowering of blood glucose was 
accompanied by changes in serum lipids and body weight gain. The repeat-dose toxicity of treprostinil 
was evaluated in 13-week subchronic toxicity studies in pharmacologically relevant species: the rat, dog, 
and in pregnant rabbits. Treprostinil was administered daily by subcutaneous injection to match the route 
of administration in the clinical program. 
Treprostinil was well tolerated in 6 months repeated dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs. The main 
clinical observations with treprostinil treatment were related to transient vasodilatory pharmacological 
effects in both of the species. There was no indication of direct target organ toxicity in either rats or dogs. 
In  contrast  to  the  Applicant’s  conclusions  that  there  was  no  evidence  of  injection-site  reactions  to 
treprostinil, injection site reactions were reported. Injection site reactions included minimal to moderate 
vascular  degeneration/necrosis,  minimal  to  slight  degeneration/necrosis  of  the  panniculus  carnosus 
muscle,  slight  to  moderate  subcutaneous  haemorrhage,  and  minimal  inflammation.  Other  effects 
included  transient  reddening  of  skin  and pinna,  transient  decreased  systolic  and  pulse pressures  with 
increases of heart rate and trend of a shorter QT interval on Day 85 or 177 of dosing in dogs, body weight 
decreases and changes in platelets, white blood cells reticulocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte counts in 
rats (determined as mild). The skin and cardiac effects were resolved within 1 hour in rats, and 1.5 hours 
in dogs post-dosing. These findings are consistent with the main effects observed after continuous SC or 
IV delivery of treprostinil in toxicity studies previously included in the Remodulin dossier (swelling at the 
infusion site, redness of skin, decreases in body weight and haematological changes). 
The maximum tolerated dose was exceeded in pilot studies; in rats, the MTD was 0.6 mg/kg/d, which 
resulted in cardiac lesions and hypoactivity and in dogs 0.28 mg/kg/d, which resulted in hypoactivity, and 
clinical signs of pronounced vasodilatation at 30 - 45 min post-dose (salivation, pale mucous membranes, 
increased capillary refill, bradycardia) and vomiting. 
NOAEL in rats was 0.1 mg/kg/day and in dogs 0.07 mg/kg/day providing the high safety margins i.e. 
1121x (rats) and 565x (dogs) relative to the maximum expected daily dose of treprostinil in 1.5 U/kg/day 
of LY900014 in patients with T2D. At these NOAELs the exposure multiples greatly exceed the ICHM3(R2) 
threshold of 50x max human exposure. 
Genotoxicity 
Insulin  lispro  was  negative  in  a  full  range  of  standard  tests  of  genotoxicity,  which  included  bacterial 
mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian systems. No specific studies have been conducted with 
LY900014. Treprostinil was not genotoxic according to standard battery of genotoxic tests, in Ames assay 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 25/177 
 
 
 
(up to dose of 5000 µg/plate), chromosome aberration test in CHO cells and in in vivo in rat bone marrow 
cells micronucleus assay. These results are in line with the previous studies of treprostinil indicating lack 
of  genotoxic  potential  (Remodulin  EPAR:  treprostinil  has  not  been  genotoxic  in  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
assays). 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with insulin lispro, LY900014 or treprostinil. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Insulin  lispro  demonstrated  no  teratogenic  or  reproductive  effects.  Reproductive  and  developmental 
toxicity  studies  have  not  been  conducted  with  LY900014.  Reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity 
studies with treprostinil included fertility studies in rats, embryo-foetal studies in rats and rabbits, and a 
pre- and postnatal development study in rats. No unexpected findings were noted in these studies. 
Clinical  signs  in  reproductive  and  development  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  rabbits  were  limited  to 
transient,  dose-related  flushing  of  the  extremities  secondary  to  the  vasodilatory  pharmacology  of 
treprostinil and irregular respiration and hypoactivity in rats at 0.1 mg/kg/ day doses. 
Fertility and early embryonic development studies with treprostinil were conducted in rats. Treprostinil 
had no effects on the fertility. There were no adverse effects of treprostinil on sperm morphology, oestrus 
cyclicity,  mating,  fertility,  conception,  implantation,  and  embryonic  survival  at  doses  up  to  0.1 
mg/kg/day.  NOAEL  for  male  fertility  and  paternal  toxicity  was  0.1  mg/kg/day  (746x  relative  to  the 
maximum expected daily dose of treprostinil in 1.5 U/kg/day of LY900014 in patients with T2D). NOAEL 
for female fertility and maternal toxicity was 0.1 mg/kg/day (528x exposure margins in comparison to 
maximum human AUC). 
Embryo-foetal development studies indicated that treprostinil was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 
0.1  mg/kg/day  (NOAEL,  736x  the  maximum  anticipated  human  AUC),  or  in  rabbits  at  doses  up  to 
0.4 mg/kg/day (NOAEL, 9136x the maximum anticipated human AUC). NOAEL for rat maternal toxicity 
was  0.1  mg/kg/day  and  rabbit  0.05  mg/kg/day  corresponding  to  726x  and  1452x  the  maximum 
anticipated human AUC, respectively. 
In the prenatal and postnatal development study in rats, there was no evidence of F0 maternal toxicity or 
adverse effects on F1 offspring growth, behaviour, and reproduction at doses up to 0.1 mg/kg/day (462x 
the maximum anticipated human AUC). The only noted effects were decrease in body weight gain and 
food  consumption  in  rats  at  the  highest  dose  tested  i.e.  0.1  mg/kg/day,  and  a  slight  increase  of  the 
duration of gestation (22.9 days vs 22.5 days in the control group). This had no effect- on the viability of 
the rat foetuses or foetus weights, or other postnatal development endpoints. These results are in line 
with the earlier peri-/postnatal development study results with treprostinil administered by continuous SC 
infusion via osmotic pump (at 450 ng/kg/min) to rats in support of the registration for Remodulin (in 
these studies, there were no alterations in gestational length, number of implantation site per litter, or 
number of lost post-implantation, and no development and growth variations observed). 
Previous  pregnant  rabbit  studies  at  maternal  toxic  doses  of  treprostinil  revealed  some  evidence  of 
increased foetal skeletal variations. There were no treprostinil-related foetal skeletal variations noted in 
the new studies conducted with high excess of the treprostinil doses compared to those in LY900014. In 
the dose-range finding study in rabbits with high dose of treprostinil, tendency for a slight increase in 
early  resorptions  (post-implantation  loss)  was  noted.  These  findings  in  rats  and  rabbits  collectively 
indicated, that the use of minute quantities of treprostinil in LY900014 is not of a toxicological concern 
during pregnancy.

The reproductive and developmental toxicity study findings have been stated as follows in the Humalog 
EPAR section 4.6 Fertility: ‘Insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment in animal studies (see section 
5.3)’ and section 5.3: ’Insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity 
in  animal  studies.’  The  same  text  is  included  in  the  proposed  SmPC  sections  4.6/fertility  and 
5.3/preclinical safety data of LY900014 and is deemed adequate. 
Juvenile toxicity studies were not conducted with LY900014. Juvenile toxicity studies were not required 
for insulin lispro. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The plasma TK of treprostinil was determined in male and female rats administered with daily SC doses of 
0.01, 0.03, 0.10 mg/kg of treprostinil as the sodium salt for 3 months and daily SC doses of 0.01 and 0.10 
mg/kg of treprostinil as the sodium salt for 6 months. The plasma TK of treprostinil was determined in 
male and female dogs administered with daily SC doses of 0.004, 0.015, and 0.070 mg/kg of treprostinil 
as the sodium salt for 3 months, and daily SC doses of 0.004 and 0.070 mg/kg of treprostinil as the 
sodium salt for 6 months. Toxicokinetic parameters were calculated after dosing on Days 1, 90, and 180 
in the 6-month study in both species. In the reproductive and developmental rat toxicity studies, similar 
toxicokinetic profile of treprostinil were generally observed in the 3 months and 6 months rat studies. For 
the toxicokinetic profiling of treprostinil on GD 7 and 19 in pregnant rabbits, treprostinil was administered 
daily with SC doses of 0.05, 0.14, and 0.4 mg/kg. 
Adequate treprostinil exposures were obtained in repeated dose toxicity studies in all species (rat, dog 
and rabbit). Toxicokinetics was similar in both genders. The exposures (AUC0-24h and Cmax) were roughly 
dose proportional in rats and dogs. The exposure differences between males and females were less than 
2-fold. After SC injection, treprostinil exhibited a tmax value of 0.5 hour for rats and dogs and 0.5 - 
1.1 hours for pregnant rabbits. 
The margin of safety for clinical microdoses of the excipient treprostinil at the toxicological NOAELs for 
treprostinil ranged from 462-fold to 1121-fold in rats and dogs, and was 1452-fold in rabbits. 
Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance studies were conducted with LY900014 commercial formulation. Local tolerance was 
evaluated  as  part  of  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  with  insulin  lispro  to  support  the  marketing 
authorisation of Humalog. Injection site inflammation with insulin lispro was observed only in the 1-year 
rat study in high dose excess of those used clinically, 20 and 200 U/kg/day. 
Humalog  and  treprostinil  (Remodulin)  where  administered  alone  or  in  combination  (a  representative 
Phase  1  formulation)  by  SC  injection  to  male  rats  once  daily  for  14  days.  Up  to  SC  dose  of  2160  ng 
Remodulin/kg with or without up to 201 U Humalog/kg once daily for 14 days was well tolerated. No 
compound-related  irritation  was  observed  in  this  study  at  the  injection  sites  as  measured  by  Draize 
dermal  irritation  scoring  or  during  a  macroscopic  and  microscopic  pathology  examination  at  study 
termination. In the repeated dose toxicity studies with treprostinil in rats, injection site reactions were 
reported and were considered to be related to the pharmacology of treprostinil. These findings were in line 
with  the  previous  studies  with  SC  administration  of  treprostinil  to  dogs  conducted  to  support  the 
Remodulin marketing authorisation (treprostinil doses of 100 or 200 ng/kg/min induced lesions around 
the infusion site).

Other toxicity studies 
No other toxicity studies have been conducted with LY900014. The ocular and dermal irritation potential 
of  treprostinil  were  assessed.  In  these  studies,  treprostinil  had  the  potential  for  dermal  and  ocular 
irritation. Treprostinil is predicted to be a severe category I ocular irritant based on the bovine corneal 
opacity study and permeability assay. Treprostinil had potential for dermal irritation at a dose level of 
2140 mg/kg (adjusted for potency) in rats. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The use of LY900014 in humans is not expected to result in a risk to environmental organisms. LY900014 
is a novel formulation that contains the active ingredient, insulin lispro, with the prostacyclin analogue 
treprostinil  among  the  excipients.  Insulin  lispro  is  not  excreted  intact  from  humans  in  significant 
quantities and any protein that is excreted is subject to degradation during sewage treatment. Therefore, 
insulin lispro will not enter the environment. 
Since  treprostinil  is  an  active  ingredient  in  other  registered  drug  products,  the  environmental  risk 
assessment  (Phase  I)  was  estimated  for  treprostinil  and  its  use  as  an  active  ingredient  in  Remodulin 
followed by add-in value of use of treprostinil in the LY900014. The PECsurface water for treprostinil was 
estimated  as  0.000015  µg/L.  The  overall  predicted  environmental  concentration  of  treprostinil  was 
calculated 0.000022 µg/L. The concentration of treprostinil predicted to enter the environment is lower 
than the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. Therefore, is unlikely to be a risk for the environment following patient 
use. Neither insulin lispro nor treprostinil should be classified as persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. 
In conclusion, the active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration 
or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, LY900014 (insulin lispro) is not expected 
to pose a risk to the environment. In addition, LY900014 contains prostacyclin analogy treprostinil as an 
excipient, which is not expected to increase the environmental risk of LY900014. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
LY900014 contains the known active pharmaceutical ingredient insulin lispro, with an ultra-rapid-acting 
formulation including the excipients treprostinil and sodium citrate. Insulin lispro is the active ingredient 
in Humalog (Eli Lilly and Company). The majority of the studies with insulin lispro have been assessed 
during the Humalog marketing authorisation assessment (1996) and are used as bridging data for the 
LY900014 application. A comprehensive program of non-clinical studies including safety pharmacology, 
genetic toxicity, subchronic toxicity, chronic toxicity, and reproductive and developmental toxicity have 
been  conducted  to  demonstrate  the  safety  of  the  novel  excipient  treprostinil.  Treprostinil  is  an  active 
ingredient  in  other  medicinal  products  (such  as  Remodulin,  Tyvaso)  and  the  previous  pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology data with treprostinil exist. Microdoses of treprostinil will be given to 
patients. Systemic plasma exposure is expected to be minimal and, the margins of safety were large in 
chronic  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  dogs  (993x  and  565x,  respectively).  Other  excipients  i.e.  sodium 
citrate  and  magnesium  chloride  in  the  final  commercial  formulation  are  known  excipients  and  were 
components of the vehicle control in the in vivo nonclinical safety studies. In the new studies, there were 
no  unexpected  safety  risks  identified  of  the  use  of  treprostinil  as  an  excipient  in  the  formulation  of 
LY900014.  Consequently,  no  safety  concerns  were  raised.  The  findings  were  in  line  with  the  earlier 
published treprostinil toxicology study findings. 
The  proof  of  concept  studies  to  demonstrate  the  faster  glucose  lowering  effect  of  the  development 
formulations (including various concentrations of treprostinil and citrate) were conducted in a miniature 
Yucatan  diabetic  swine.  One  of  the  studies  (study  DBT253)  was  conducted  with  the  final  commercial 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 28/177 
 
 
 
formulation  of  LY900014,  which  can  be  considered  pivotal  for  demonstrating  the  nonclinical  mode  of 
action. Several other concerns were raised as part of the D120 LoQ related to this study and the rationale 
for selection of the final commercial solution. It was clarified that the non-clinical studies and the only 
experiment  with  LY900014  (study  DBT253)  was  conducted  in  parallel  with  the  Phase  1  studies.  The 
combination of sodium citrate and treprostinil at the doses used in the commercial formulation was tested 
in ITRE at the same time/before the last porcine study.  
Whilst the pharmacological effect (vasodilation and increased vascular permeability) of both excipients on 
their own was clearly shown, the rationale for combining them with insulin lispro at the proposed doses in 
the  commercial  formulation  LY900014  appeared  not  entirely  clear.  On  request,  the  Applicant  further 
elaborated  the  pharmacological  rationale  for  the  combination  of  treprostinil  and  sodium  citrate  with 
insulin  lispro.  It  could  be  concluded  that  the  commercial  formulation  and  one  of  the  formulations 
containing similar doses of excipients (15 mM citrate and 0.5 µg/ml treprostinil) enhanced PK properties 
in regards to increase in exposure, earlier Tmax and faster glucose lowering in comparison with insulin 
lispro on its own. The Applicant was asked to further elaborate the rationale for the addition of MgCl2 (5 
mM) as an excipient in the LY900014 commercial solution. MgCl2 is not present in the formulation of 
Humalog. The Applicant clarified, that the rationale for the addition of MgCl2 was to increase stability of 
insulin lispro hexamers, to counteract the effect of sodium citrate (on reducing the physical stability of 
insulin lispro hexamers). 
In study DBT253, lowering of the serum glucose levels was rapid after the SC administration of LY900014 
(within 20 minutes of the meal). Significantly faster lowering of plasma glucose levels was noted at early 
time  points  i.e.  10  and  15  minutes,  with  p=0.0001  and  p=5.76E10-05,  respectively,  compared  to 
Humalog. However, only the box-plot and curves on glucose changes over the time with the statistical 
significance were provided by the Applicant in initial submission. Average serum glucose concentrations 
(mg/dl  or  mmol/L)  and  the  change  from  the  baseline  with  the  variability  range  were  subsequently 
submitted in accordance with the D120 LoQ. The conclusion (of faster glucose lowering effect of LY900014 
in comparison to Humalog) remains. Further, the Applicant was asked to clarify the identical p-values of 
changes in glucose levels in comparison of various formulations in Studies DBT232 and DBT233. It was 
clarified, that identical p-values between the treatment groups are not the result of repetition of data but 
represent the false discovery rate -adjusted p-values. Thus, the conclusions of the statistical differences 
between the formulations at early time points in the studies DBT232 and DBT233 are valid. 
A summary of method qualification was requested for the “fit for purpose” method used to quantify the 
total insulin in minipig plasma in the studies DBT 231, 232, 233, 253. It was clarified, that the method 
(commercial RIA kit repurposed to quantify insulin in pig serum) was qualified as part of study DBT231 
and the range of quantification was 20 or 39 to 5000 pM. Most measures obtained were within this range. 
Although the inter-study quality controls did not cover the whole range of quantification, especially, the 
upper limit, the assay was considered sufficiently fit for the purpose. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The new non-clinical data demonstrated the faster lowering of the blood glucose levels (within 15 minutes) 
and faster absorption of insulin lispro after the SC administration of LY900014 in diabetic swine, and the 
use of treprostinil at safe concentrations as an excipient. Overall, no non-clinical major objections were 
identified for LY900014, and no open issues remain. The non-clinical data package is deemed adequate.

The primary objective of this 
study was to test the 
hypothesis that LY900014 
was noninferior to Humalog 
on glycaemic control 
(noninferiority margin [NIM] 
= 0.4% for HbA1c) in 
patients with T1D (ITRM) 
and T2D (ITRN), when 
administered as prandial 
insulin (0 to 2 minutes prior 
to the meal), in combination 
with basal insulin glargine or 
insulin degludec for 26 
weeks. 
A NIM of 0.3% was also 
tested.

Objectives: 
ITRM:  To test the 
hypothesis that LY900014 
was noninferior to Humalog 
on improving glycaemic 
control (NIM=0.4% for 
HbA1c) when administered 
20 minutes after the start of 
a meal (LY900014+20) 
(H5). 
A NIM of 0.3% was also 
tested. 
ITRM and ITRN: 
To test the hypothesis that  
LY900014 was superior to 
Humalog:  
-in controlling 1-hour PPG 
excursions (H2) (MMTT), 
when administered as 
prandial insulin at Week 26 
- in controlling 2-hour PPG 
excursions (MMTT), when 
administered as prandial 
insulin at Week 26 (H3) 
-was superior to Humalog on 
improving glycaemic control 
when administered as 
prandial insulin (change 
from baseline to Week 26 in 
HbA1c) (H4).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
LY900014  is  a new  formulation  of  insulin  lispro that  utilizes two  enabling excipients  -  treprostinil  and 
sodium citrate - with independent mechanisms to accelerate the absorption of insulin lispro from the site 
of injection. A microdose of treprostinil, a prostacyclin analogue approved for treatment of pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH), induces local vasodilation to enhance the absorption of insulin lispro. The 
addition of citrate in LY900014 enhances the local vascular permeability to speed insulin absorption. The 
active pharmaceutical ingredient, insulin lispro, is identical in LY900014 and Humalog. Therefore, once 
systemically absorbed, the disposition pharmacokinetics and drug interaction potential are assumed to be 
similar between LY900014 and Humalog. 
LY900014  is  intended  for  subcutaneous  (SC)  use  and  for  intravenous  (IV)  use  to  improve  glycaemic 
control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). LY900014 is 
available in 2 dosage strengths: 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL. 
The  clinical  pharmacology  studies  evaluated  LY900014  following  different  routes  of  administration, 
including SC and IV injections and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Comparisons were 
made  to  Humalog  throughout  the  development.  Of  the  22  clinical  pharmacology  studies  performed, 
1 study  evaluated  sodium  citrate,  3  studies  evaluated  treprostinil,  7  studies  were  conducted  with 
development  formulations  of  LY900014,  and  11  studies  were  conducted  with  the  final  commercial 
formulation (Table 3). No bioequivalence study was performed between the development formulations 
and the final commercial LY900014 formulation since the latter one was used in all of the Phase 3 studies 
and in the clinical pharmacology studies that support product labelling. The final commercial formulation 
was used in all clinical studies presented in this report. 
Bioanalytical methods 
The  Applicant  used 
the 
following  analytical  methods:  1.  a 
liquid  chromatographic-mass 
spectrometry/mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS)  to  analyse  the  amount  of  treprostinil  in  human  plasma 
samples,  2.  to  measure  free  LY275585  in  human  serum,  three  different  assays  were  used;  i) 
radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used in one clinical study, ii) in three subsequent studies an ELISA was 
performed, and iii) in all other instances, another ELISA assay with two subsequent iterations was used, 
and 3. for detection and characterisation of anti-drug antibodies to LY275585, a radioligand binding assay 
(RBA) was performed.  
To analyse the amount of treprostinil a LC-MS/MS was performed. A sufficient description of the method 
and the method validation have been provided. Compliance of the assay with respect to accuracy and 
precision,  determination  of  matrix  effects,  range,  selectivity,  and  stability  are  shown.  In  addition, 
carryover  and  reproducibility  of  the  reinjections  were  analysed.  Appropriate  calibration  curve  for  the 
acceptance criteria are set. Calibration curve standards (STD) are prepared separately from the quality 
control  (QC)  samples.  Robustness  of  the  analytical  method  was  not  evaluated.  The  Applicant  uses 
treprostinil-13C2D as an internal standard (IS) for the assay. Stability for two years is stated. For each 
clinical trial, the method qualification runs were performed prior to the studies. The method performance 
of the assay in the study met the defined criteria. The required criteria were met and the reproducibility 
of the bioanalytical method is therefore shown. 
The  amount  of  LY275585  in  human  serum  was  determined  with  two  different  methods: 
radioimmunoassay (RIA) and two different ELISAs. Sufficient validation data from the RIA method was 
included. The method is validated between 0.2 to 30 ng/mL. Precision and accuracy, dilution linearity, and 
method  selectivity  as  well  as  stability  (freeze-thaw,  RT,  +2-8°,  and  long  term)  were  assessed.  The 
method’s selectivity was amended to include method sensitivity. System suitability criteria for calibration

curve were set. In addition, acceptance criteria for quality control are provided. Quantization of LY275585 
in the samples was achieved by interpolation from the standard calibration curve. Some minor issues with 
the method validation was observed e.g. information about the positive control and matrix is missing and 
robustness of the method was not evaluated. However, since the clinical trial ITAO was performed in the 
earlier stages of the drug development and no pivotal data to support the MAA is collected in this trial, no 
further information is requested. 
For ELISA 3400139, a sufficient description of the method including all the method validation have been 
provided. Validation of the method in human serum included: selectivity, dilution linearity, evaluation of 
the  prozone  effect,  working  calibration  range,  inter  and  intra-assay  precision and  accuracy  (including 
LLOQ and ULOQ assessments). In addition, the stability of validation samples was assessed. Validation 
data also demonstrated that hemolysis of up to 5% has no impact on the assay. For each clinical trial 
(F3Z-FW-ITCA, I8B-FW-ITRA, and I8B-FW-ITRE), the method qualification runs were performed prior to 
the studies. The method performance of the assay in the study met the defined criteria. In general, it can 
be agreed that the method is appropriately validated, however, specificity was not evaluated as required 
in  the  bioanalytical  method  validation  guideline.  According  to  the  Applicant,  the  quantification  of 
LY275585 was not affected by the presence of human insulin (10 ng/mL). Specificity was evaluated in 
lipemic serum, haemolysed serum, and human serum with endogenous insulin.  
Sufficient description of the ELISA methods 3400449, 3400620, and 3400690 including all the method 
validation have been provided and is considered acceptable. Validation of the method in human serum 
included: selectivity, dilution linearity, evaluation of the prozone effect, working calibration range, inter 
and intra-assay precision and accuracy (including LLOQ and ULOQ assessments). In addition, the stability 
of validation samples was assessed. Method 3400449 was used in seven clinical trials (ITRK, ITRF, ITRL, 
ITSC, ITRJ, ITRG, and ITRP). Method 3400620 was used in trial ITRH, and method 3400690 in trials ITSH, 
ITRU, ITRR, ITRT, ITRQ, ITRV, ITRW, ITRZ, and ITSS. Method qualification runs were performed prior to 
the  studies.  Method  performance  of  the  assays  in  the  study  met the defined  criteria.  In  addition,  the 
Applicant  has  provided  acceptable  cross-validation  studies  for  RIA  and  ELISA  3400139  as  well  as  for 
ELISA 3400139 and ELISA 3400690.  
Some general consideration is made for all validated ELISAs for detection of insulin in human serum. 
Acceptance criteria for accuracy and precision are higher (the mean back-calculated concentrations had 
to  be  within  ±  20%  relative  error  (±  25%  relative  error  at  the  LLOQ  and  ULOQ)  than  stated  in  the 
bioanalytical method validation guideline for non-ligand binding assays where ± 15% and ± 20% REs are 
recommended  for  the  mean  concentrations  and  LLOQ/ULOQ,  respectively.  However,  as  for  all  the 
methods,  the  validation  results  are  considered  appropriate;  the  proposed  acceptance  criteria  can  be 
accepted.  As  part  of  the  D181  responses,  the  Applicant  has  provided  satisfactory  evidence  on  the 
robustness of the bioanalytical methods.  
For quantification of anti-drug antibodies, a semi-quantitative method is used, thus the results are not 
presented as ADA titers. Patient samples are considered as ADA positive when the assay result (∆%B/T 
value) is over the assay cut point. As described by the Applicant the ∆%B/T value is a difference between 
%B/T radioactivity measurements of set A and set B samples. Set A contains the diluted sample extract 
in the buffer while set B contains excess LY275585 competing with the bound radiolabeled tracker. Due to 
the  excess  LY275585  competition  the  radioactivity  is  reduced  and  thus  the  binding  is  confirmed. 
Evaluation  of  immunogenicity  was  based  on  data  from  three  Phase  3  and  10  clinical  pharmacology 
studies. 
The  Applicant  will  use  a  2-tiered  approach  to  detect  and  characterize  anti-insulin  lispro  antibodies  in 
serum samples from clinical trials. The clinical study samples were assessed in Tier 1 (screening) for the 
presence of ADA against insulin lispro. If a serum sample assessed in Tier 1 is found to produce a sign 
greater than or equal to the Tier 1 assay cut point, it is evaluated in Tier 2, which assesses whether the

anti-insulin lispro antibodies are cross-reactive to native insulin (competition with excess unlabeled native 
insulin instead of excess unlabeled insulin lispro). In general, the Applicant has shown a compliance of the 
assay  with  respect  to  minimal  required  dilution  (MRD),  specificity  and  assay  cut  points,  precision, 
sensitivity,  drug  and  insulin  tolerance,  determination  of  matrix  effects,  stability  and  robustness. 
Validation acceptance criteria for intra and inter assay precision (± 25% CV) and for matrix effect (± 
30%) are higher than stated in the EMA bioanalytical method validation guideline, however, based on the 
provided validation data, the limits can be accepted. Guinea pig anti-insulin antibody serum was used as 
a positive control and the antibody was appropriately characterised. 
Absorption  
Study ITRT was an absolute and relative bioavailability study conducted as an open-label, randomized, 
4-period crossover, 10-hour euglycaemic clamp study in healthy subjects to compare the insulin lispro 
pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  glucodynamic  (GD)  profiles  following  a  15  units  (U)  dose  of  LY900014 
administered IV and SC into the thigh, deltoid, or abdomen. One subject in study ITRT had extremely low 
insulin  lispro  exposure  following  IV  administration  of  LY900014,  possibly  due  to  incomplete  drug 
administration and/or incomplete flushing of the cannula. The subject was excluded from PK analyses, 
which was considered to be acceptable. 
Absolute bioavailability of insulin lispro was approximately 65% following SC injection of LY900014 at 
each site. The insulin lispro concentration-versus-time profiles following SC injection into the abdomen 
and deltoid were superimposable, whereas the Cmax was lower and the concentration vs time curve was 
broader following injection into the thigh in comparison to both the abdomen and deltoid (Figure 3). To 
justify  injection  into  the  thigh,  the  Applicant  performed  indirect  comparison  of  the  PK  parameters 
obtained  after  SC  injection  of  LY900014  in  the  abdomen,  deltoid  and  thigh  (study  ITRT)  with  those 
obtained after SC injection of Humalog in the abdomen (studies ITSH and ITRL). Although early exposure 
was lower after injection of LY900014 in the thigh compared to other injection sites, absorption was still 
significantly  accelerated  compared  to  Humalog  (Figure  4).  The  results  of  relative  bioavailability 
comparison are summarised in Table 4.

Bioequivalence 
The first bioequivalence study, ITRQ, failed due to inadequately priming of the LY900014 U-200 insulin 
pens.  However,  bioequivalence  between  U-100  and  U-200  formulation  was  shown  in  the  repeat 
bioequivalence study ITSS. 
Comparable  pharmacokinetics  for  the  concentrated  form  (200  units/mL)  of  LY900014  relative  to 
LY900014  100  units/mL  following  SC  administration  was  demonstrated  in  a  2-sequence,  4-period, 
randomized,  replicated-crossover  study  in  healthy  subjects  (study  ITSS).  Statistical  analysis  for  the 
pre-defined  primary  PK  parameters  AUC(0-tlast),  AUC(0-∞),  and  Cmax  demonstrated  comparable 
pharmacokinetics for the 200 units/mL and the 100 units/mL formulations (Table 5). Partial AUCs for 
secondary  PK  parameters  reflecting  early  insulin  lispro  exposure  [AUC(0-15min)  and  AUC(0-30min)] 
were  slightly  lower  for  the  U-200  formulation,  but  within  the  conventional  limits  (0.80,  1.25)  of 
bioequivalence. The ratio (90% CI) of U-200/U-100 were 0.882 (0.836, 0.931) and 0.863 (0.828, 0.900) 
for AUC[0-15min] and AUC[0-30min], respectively, for subjects who completed all periods.

Distribution 
Geometric mean (range) of volume of distribution (Vz) following IV injection of a 15 U dose of LY900014 
was 34 L (16 to 53 L), calculated using conventional non-compartmental analysis. 
Elimination 
Geometric mean (range) of clearance following IV injection of a 15 U dose of LY900014 was 32.3 L/h 
(23.3 to 49.5 L/h), calculated using conventional non-compartmental analysis. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Study  ITSH  was  a  randomised,  subject-  and  investigator-blind,  6-period  complete  crossover  study  in 
healthy subjects to evaluate the PK and glucodynamic characteristics of LY900014 compared to Humalog 
across a range of doses (single SC doses of 7, 15, and 30 U).

The insulin lispro concentration time profile increased with LY900014 dose as shown in the Figure below. 
The resulting insulin lispro exposure (AUC[0-∞] and Cmax) following administration of LY900014 shows 
an increase by dose. 
The  degree  of  dose  proportionality  for  insulin  lispro  was  assessed  by  fitting  the  power  model  to 
AUC[0-10h], AUC[0-∞] and Cmax versus dose for each dose level of LY900014. When dose proportionality 
exists, the exponent on dose in the equation should be close to 1. The exponents for the insulin lispro 
Cmax, AUC(0-10h), and AUC(0-∞) across the dose range of 7 to 30 U were 0.959 (95% CI: 0.910 to 1.01), 
1.08  (95%  CI:  1.05  to  1.10),  and  1.08  (95%  CI:  1.05  to  1.10),  respectively.  The  ratios  of 
dose-normalised geometric LS means for the insulin lispro Cmax, AUC(0-10h), and AUC(0-∞) across the 
dose range of 7 to 30 U were 0.942 (95% CI: 0.877 to 1.01), 1.12 (95% CI: 1.08 to 1.16), and 1.12 (95% 
CI: 1.08 to 1.16), respectively. This indicated that increase in Cmax was dose proportional and increases 
in AUC(0-10h) and AUC(0-∞) were approximately dose proportional.

Variability 
Intra- and inter-individual variability for Cmax and AUC(0-∞) observed in patients with T1D, T2D, and in 
healthy subjects in representative 4-period cross-over studies ITRV, ITRW and ITSS is summarised in 
Table 6 through Table 7. Note that the dose was individualised in studies ITRV and ITRW, which increases 
the inter-individual variability of Cmax and AUC. 
Results of the population PK analysis indicated that inter-individual variability is small (6.2 to 24.6%) for 
disposition parameters following IV injection, moderate (31.4%) for bioavailability, and large (42.2 to 
78.7%) for absorption rate parameters following SC injection.

Pharmacokinetics of LY900014 vs Humalog: SC injection 
Study ITRL was a randomized, subject- and investigator-blind, 2-treatment, 2-period, crossover study in 
healthy subjects. It compared the PK and GD of insulin lispro following a single 15 U SC dose of LY900014 
with the PK and GD of a single 15 U SC dose of Humalog. 
The mean insulin lispro exposure following administration of single 15 U doses of LY900014 and insulin 
lispro  (Humalog)  is  presented  in  the  Figure  below.  LY900014  showed  a  faster,  earlier  insulin  lispro 
absorption  compared  to  Humalog  as  indicated  by  left  shifting  of  the  concentration-time  curve  and 
statistically significant (p<0.0001) changes in the early 50% tmax, AUC(0-15min), AUC(0-30min), and 
AUC(0-1h). Similarly, the late insulin lispro exposure [AUC(2-8h)] was reduced with LY900014 compared 
to Humalog (p<0.0001). This faster absorption of insulin lispro resulted in 1.28-fold higher Cmax following 
LY900014 compared to Humalog (p<0.0001). However, the overall insulin exposure [AUC(0-∞)] was not 
significantly different between LY900014 and Humalog (ratio of geometric LSM 1.03; 90% CI 0.99-1.08).

In  study  ITSH in  healthy  subjects,  LY900014  showed  an  accelerated  lispro  absorption  compared  with 
Humalog, seen as left shifting of the concentration-time curve at each dose level (Figure 8). Statistically 
significant  difference  between  LY900014  and  Humalog  was  shown  for  early  exposure  PK  parameters 
onset of appearance, early 50% tmax, AUC(0-15min), AUC(0-30min), and AUC(0-1h) (p<0.0001 for each 
parameter  at  each  dose  level).  A  reduction  in  late  insulin  exposure  and  a  shorter  exposure  duration 
compared  to  Humalog  was  also  shown  across  all  3  dose  levels.  The  tmax  or  overall  insulin  exposure 
(AUC[0-∞]) was not significantly different between LY900014 and Humalog, but the average Cmax was 
12% to 19% higher following LY900014 injection (p<0.0001 to p=0.0026).

pharmacodynamic objectives of the study and was maintained over the study periods for each treatment. 
The average dose was 12.4 U (0.155 U/kg) for the dose range of 6 to 34 U (0.0764 to 0.38 U/kg).

exposure was reduced with LY900014 compared to Humalog. Additionally, the duration of exposure was 
shorter with LY900014 compared to Humalog.   The overall insulin exposure AUC(0-∞) and tmax were not 
significantly different between LY900014 and Humalog (p=0.0676 and p=0.1002, respectively).

Study ITRW was a patient- and investigator-blind, randomized, 2-treatment, 4-period crossover study in 
patients with T2D. The primary objective was to evaluate the PK of insulin lispro following a single SC 
injection of LY900014 and Humalog in patients with T2D. The insulin dose was individualized by patient 
for investigation of the pharmacodynamic objectives of the study and was maintained over the study 
periods for each treatment. The average dose was 14.3 U (0.15 U/kg) for the dose range of 5 to 40 U 
(0.0587 to 0.365 U/kg) of LY900014 and Humalog. 
The  mean  insulin  lispro  exposure  following  administration  of  LY900014  and  Humalog  is  presented  in

Meta-analysis of pharmacokinetics: LY900014 vs Humalog 
The Applicant conducted a meta-analysis to summarize the pharmacokinetics after SC injection of a single 
dose  of  either  a  7,  15  or  30  units  (U)  LY900014  compared  to  Humalog.  Studies  included  in  the  PK 
meta-analysis  (ITRL,  ITRU,  ITRR,  ITSH)  used  the  final  commercial  formulation  of  LY900014,  included 
Humalog as the comparator, collected PK data in a cross over study design, used similar timing for PK 
collection, and conducted comparisons between LY900014 and Humalog using the same dose level. 
Forest plots presented below include the individual study 95% CIs using the analysis models used in the 
studies.  The  primary  protocol-specified  PK  endpoints  in  studies  ITRL,  ITRU,  ITRR  and  ITSH  were 
AUC(0-30min)  and  time  to  half  maximal  drug  concentration  (early  50%  tmax),  which  reflect  the  early 
insulin exposure. 
The  accelerated  absorption  resulted  in  greater  early  insulin  lispro  exposure  with  LY900014  than  with 
Humalog. The largest increase was observed in the first 15 minutes after injection. The treatment ratio 
between LY900014 and Humalog for AUC(0-15min) was 7.51 in the meta-analysis. Significant increases 
in  exposure  were  also  demonstrated  at  30  minutes  and  1  hour  after  injection.  The  treatment  ratio 
between  LY900014  and  Humalog  for  the  AUC(0-30min)  and  for  the  AUC(0-1h)  were  2.97  and  1.52, 
respectively,  in  the  meta-analysis  (Figure  14).  Overall,  the  results  indicate  that  LY900014  provided 
approximately  8 times,  3 times,  and  1.5 times  more  insulin lispro  exposure  after  administration than 
Humalog for the first 15, 30 and 60 minutes, respectively.

LY900014  reduced  the  late  insulin  lispro  exposure  characterised  using  the  duration  of  insulin  lispro 
exposure in the serum, the timing of the late 50% tmax, and the insulin lispro exposure from two hours to 
the  end  of  PK  sampling  period  (AUC[2h-Xh]),  and  three  hours  to  the  end  of  PK  sampling  period 
(AUC[3h-Xh]). A statistically significant reduction was consistently shown in the insulin lispro exposure 
after 3 hours where the treatment ratio between LY900014 and Humalog was 0.57 in the meta-analysis 
(Figure  15).  This  indicates  that  LY900014  had  43%  less  insulin  lispro  exposure  after  3  hours  than 
observed following Humalog administration.

Pharmacokinetics of LY900014 vs Humalog: Continuous SC insulin infusion  
Study ITSC was a 4-period, patient- and investigator-blind, randomized, crossover study in patients with 
T1D to evaluate the insulin lispro PK and GD characteristics of LY900014 over 3 days with continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusions (CSII) compared with that of Humalog using a Medtronic MiniMed 640G 
pump.  The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  difference  in  insulin  lispro  PK  when  LY900014  and 
Humalog  are  administered  as  different  test  bolus  doses  using  an  insulin  pump  to  patients  with  T1DM 
during a breakfast mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). 
Each patient was randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences comprising CSII of LY900014 or Humalog, 
with different combinations of the modes of administration of the bolus doses relative to the breakfast, 
lunch, and dinner meals using an insulin pump. The bolus dose of insulin lispro (LY900014 or Humalog) 
was individualized per patient to cover the carbohydrate content of the meals and was maintained over 
the study periods for each treatment. The modes of administration were as follows: 
•  Mode 1: bolus dose was administered as a standard dual-wave (SD) bolus (50% immediate bolus 
delivery [speed = 1.5 U/minute] and 50% as a square wave over 3 hours) 
•  Mode  2:  bolus  dose  was  administered  as  a  standard  single-wave  (SS)  bolus  (speed  = 
1.5 U/minute) 
•  Mode 3: bolus dose was administered as a rapid single-wave (RS) bolus (speed = 15 U/minute)

•  Mode 4: bolus dose was administered as a rapid dual-wave (RD) bolus (50% immediate bolus 
delivery [speed = 15 U/minute] and 50% as a square wave over 3 hours) 
The mean insulin lispro exposure over time on Days 1 and 3 after LY900014 and Humalog administration 
using  a  SS  bolus  or  a  SD  bolus  during  the  breakfast  MMTT  is  presented  in  Figure  17  and  Figure  18, 
respectively. 
Following a SS bolus, LY900014 reduced the early 50% tmax by approximately 8.5 minutes (37%) on Day 
1 (p <0.0001) and by approximately 5.3 minutes (32%) on Day 3 (p <0.0001) compared to Humalog, 
and statistically significantly (p<0.05) higher AUC(0-15min) and AUC(0-30min) values on Day 1 and Day 
3  were  observed  following  LY900014  administration compared  to  Humalog.  There  was  no  statistically 
significant  difference  in  tmax,  Cmax,  AUC(0-1h),  AUC(0-5h),  AUC(0-tlast],  change  from  baseline  (CFB) 
AUC(0-5h), and late 50% tmax between LY900014 and Humalog for either Day 1 or 3. 
Following a SD bolus, LY900014 reduced the early 50% tmax by approximately 7.5 minutes (39%) on Day 
1 (p=0.0011) and by approximately 3.2 minutes (26%) on Day 3 (p=0.0422) compared to Humalog, and 
statistically significantly (p<0.05) higher AUC(0-15min) and AUC(0-30min) values on Day 1 and Day 3 
were  observed  following  LY900014  administration  compared  to  Humalog.  There  was  no  statistically 
significant difference in tmax, Cmax, AUC(0-1h), AUC(0-5h), CFB AUC(0-5h), and late 50% tmax between 
LY900014 and Humalog for either Day 1 or 3.

Special populations 
The  evaluation  whether  the  difference  between  LY900014  and  Humalog  in  PK  and  pharmacodynamic 
parameters is similar between elderly (≥65 years) and younger adults (18 to 45 years) with T1D was an 
exploratory  objective  of  study  ITRR  (see  above).  There  were  no  statistically  significant  age 
group-by-treatment interactions, indicating that the treatment effect between LY900014 and Humalog 
was similar for elderly and younger adults.  
Overall 64 subjects aged 65 to 74 and one subject aged 75 to 84 years, none ≥85 years, were included 
in the clinical pharmacology studies.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Insulin  lispro  is  a  well-known  rapid-acting  insulin  analogue.  LY900014  is  a  new  formulation  of  insulin 
lispro for subcutaneous (SC) use and for intravenous (IV) use to improve glycaemic control in patients 
with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).

The  Applicant  holds  two  duplicate  licences  for  insulin  lispro:  Humalog  (EU/1/96/007/)  and  Liprolog 
(EU/1/01/195/001) approved in 1996 and 2001 respectively. Lispro insulin used in LY900014 is the same 
active  ingredient  used  in  Humalog  and  Liprolog.  Two  excipients  in  LY900014  enable  by  independent 
mechanisms  acceleration  of  the  absorption  of  insulin  lispro  from  the  site  of  subcutaneous  injection 
resulting in a faster insulin time-action profile: 
• 
• 
Enhanced absorption of insulin lispro through increased local vasodilation, due to the addition 
of a microdose of treprostinil as an excipient in the formulation. 
Speeding  absorption  of  insulin  through  enhanced  local  vascular  permeability,  which  is 
achieved by addition of the excipient sodium citrate in the formulation. 
The primary activity of insulin and insulin analogues is the regulation of glucose metabolism. They exert 
their action through binding to insulin receptors. Receptor-bound insulin lowers blood glucose (BG) level 
by  stimulating  peripheral  glucose  uptake  by  skeletal  muscle  cells  and  adipocytes,  and  by  inhibiting 
hepatic  glucose  production.  Other  actions  of  insulin  include  inhibition  of  lipolysis  and  proteolysis,  and 
regulation of gene expression. 
Once  insulin  lispro  in  LY900014  is  absorbed  into  the  systemic  circulation,  it  is  assumed  that  the 
pharmacodynamic action is the same as of insulin lispro in Humalog and Liprolog. 
Treprostinil is a prostacyclin analogue that has been separately approved in several EU countries as a 
drug for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Systemic exposure to treprostinil in clinical 
pharmacology studies was negligible. Treprostinil concentrations slightly above the LLOQ (0.0100 ng/mL) 
were observed at 2.5 and 5 minutes following IV bolus injection of a 15U dose of LY900014, but not at 10 
minutes and later. Treprostinil levels were below the LLOQ following SC administration. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The effect of LY900014 on blood glucose levels were investigated and compared to Humalog in healthy 
subjects and patients with T1D and T2D. The methods included the glucose clamp technique, which is the 
preferred method to assess the time-action profile of insulins, and a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT), 
which enables to investigate the glucose-lowering properties of insulins in a clinically relevant but still 
standardised  setting.  Investigation  of  pharmacokinetics  was  the  primary  objective  of  the  studies; 
investigation of glucodynamics (GD) was a secondary objective. All studies were conducted as cross-over 
studies; see Table 8 and section 3.3.1 Pharmacokinetics above. The key glucodynamic parameters for the 
clamp studies are summarised in Table 9.

Effect of formulation strength on glucodynamics 
Glucodynamic effects of LY900014 200 U/mL formulation and LY900014 100 U/mL formulation during 
euglycaemic clamp were investigated in healthy subjects in study ITSS. 
SC injection of 15 U dose of LY900014 200 U/mL and LY900014 100 U/mL resulted in comparable glucose 
infusion rate (GIR) versus time profiles (Figure 19). The primary GD parameters Gtot and Rmax were 
comparable: the ratio of geometric LS means (90% CI) was 1.06 (1.01, 1.11) and 1.03 (1.00, 1.07) for 
Gtot and Rmax, respectively. Results for exploratory GD parameters also supported the conclusion that 
glucodynamic effect is similar following SC injection of LY900014 200 U/mL and LY900014 100 U/mL 
formulations.

LY900014 (Study ITSS). 
Impact of injection site on glucodynamics 
The  effect  of  SC  injection  site  (abdomen,  deltoid,  thigh)  of  LY900014  on  glucodynamics  during 
euglycaemic clamp was investigated in study ITRT. The primary GD parameters were Gtot and Rmax. 
The mean LOESS-fitted GIR profiles following injection of 15 U of LY900014 into the abdomen (N=25), 
deltoid (N=26), and thigh (N=26) are shown in in Figure 20. Following SC injection into the thigh, the GIR 
curve was slightly shifted to the right, in line with the observed slightly slower absorption from the thigh. 
Geometric means of Gtot (1630 vs 1490 mg/kg) and Rmax (6.71 vs 6.36 mg/kg/min) were comparable 
for injection into deltoid vs abdomen. The median time of Rmax was also comparable between deltoid and 
abdomen  (median  of  differences  of  tRmax  6.0  min;  p=0.23).  This  is  in  line  with  the  comparable 
concentration-time curves following injection into deltoid and abdomen. 
Geometric means of Rmax (6.71 vs 6.36 mg/kg/min) were comparable for injection into the thigh vs 
abdomen, but the median time of Rmax was later following injection into the thigh (median of differences 
of tRmax 54.0 min; p=0.0003). This is in line with the slower absorption following injection into the thigh. 
Geometric mean of Gtot was 16% higher following injection into the thigh compared to abdomen (1730 vs 
1490 mg/kg). 
In statistical analyses for subjects that completed the study (i.e. had data for all injection sites; N=25) the 
ratio (90% CI) of geometric LS means for comparisons between deltoid vs abdomen were 1.09 (0.99, 
1.20)  and  1.05  (0.96,  1.15)  for  Gtot  and  Rmax,  respectively.  For  comparisons  between  the  thigh  vs 
abdomen the ratio (90% CI) of GLS means were 1.14 (1.04, 1.25) and 1.03 (0.94, 1.13) for Gtot and 
Rmax, respectively.

Glucodynamics of LY900014 vs Humalog: euglycaemic glucose clamp 
Glucodynamics of LY900014 vs Humalog in healthy subjects were investigated in study ITRL. Mean locally 
weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) fits of glucose infusion rate (GIR) versus time comparing a 15 U 
dose of LY900014 to 15 U Humalog are presented in Figure 21. Left shifting of the GIR curve can be seen, 
demonstrating earlier effect for LY900014 compared with Humalog. 
The  primary  GD  endpoints  were  early  50%  tRmax,  Gtot(0-30min),  Gtot(0-1h),  and  Tonset,  which 
describe  early  insulin  action.  LY900014  demonstrated  an  earlier  glucose-lowering  effect  compared  to 
Humalog  these  GD  endpoints  (p<0.001  for  each).  The    geometric  LS  means  of  Gtot(0-30min)  and 
Gtot(0-1h)  for  LY900014  vs  Humalog  were  53.63  vs  8.75  mg/kg  and  85.39  vs  188.31  mg/kg, 
respectively. The medians of early 50% tRmax, and Tonset for LY900014 vs Humalog were 25.6 vs 49.4 
min and 19.8 vs 34.8 min, respectively. The late 50% tRmax was reduced with LY90014 compared to 
Humalog. No difference between LY900014 and Humalog was observed for the Rmax. The total glucose 
infused over the clamp (Gtot) was slightly lower for LY900014 compared to Humalog (ratio of geometric 
LS means 0.92; 90% CI 0.85-0.99) but the 90% CI of the ratio was within the conventional equivalence 
range of 0.8 to 1.25.

Time (Hours)
Glucodynamics of LY900014 vs Humalog in elderly and young adult patients with T1D was investigated in 
study ITRR. The primary GD endpoints were early 50% tRmax, Gtot(0-30min), Gtot(0-1h), and Tonset, 
which describe early insulin action. 
Mean LOESS fits of GIR vs time comparing a 15 U dose of LY900014 to 15 U Humalog are presented in 
Figure 22. Left shifting of the GIR curve of LY900014 compared with Humalog was observed in younger 
adults and in the elderly. 
In younger adults, LY900014 demonstrated an earlier glucose-lowering effect compared to Humalog for 
each primary GD endpoint (p<0.001 for each; completers analysis, N=38). The least squares means of 
Gtot(0-30min),  Gtot(0-1h),  early  50%  tRmax  and  Tonset  for  LY900014  vs  Humalog  were  40.78  vs 
14.01 mg/kg, 198.75 vs 106.38 mg/kg, 33.35 vs 47.49 min, and 20.16 vs 31.38 min, respectively. 
In the elderly, LY900014 demonstrated an earlier glucose-lowering effect compared to Humalog for each 
primary  GD  endpoint  (p<0.0156  for  each;  completers  analysis,  N=35).  The  least  squares  means  of 
Gtot(0-30min), Gtot(0-1h), early 50% tRmax and Tonset for LY900014 vs Humalog were 43.28 vs 13.64 
mg/kg, 186.31 vs 110.23 mg/kg, 37.12 vs 46.84 min, and 18.56 vs 30.78 min, respectively. 
LY900014 significantly reduced the late insulin action and shortened the duration of action compared to 
Humalog in younger adult and elderly patients with T1D. 
In addition, the Rmax was slightly, but statistically significantly, higher following LY900014 compared to 
Humalog administration in both populations. The ratio (95% CI) of geometric LS means was 1.14 (1.04, 
1.25) and 1.14 (1.03, 1.26) in younger adults and the elderly, respectively. The total amount of glucose 
infused during the clamp was comparable between Humalog and LY900014, however.

Glucodynamics of LY900014 vs Humalog in Japanese adult patients with T1D were investigated in study 
ITRZ. The primary GD endpoints were early 50% tRmax, Gtot(0-30min), Gtot(0-1h), and Tonset, which 
describe early insulin action. 
Mean LOESS fits of GIR vs time comparing a 15 U dose of LY900014 to 15 U Humalog are presented in

with Humalog. 
LY900014 demonstrated an earlier glucose-lowering effect compared to Humalog for each primary GD 
endpoint (p<0.0006 for each; completers analysis, N=30). The least squares means of Gtot(0-30min), 
early 50% tRmax and Tonset and geometric least squares mean Gtot(0-1h), for LY900014 vs Humalog 
were 41.24 vs 19.25 mg/kg, 30.05 vs 40.57 min, 17.04 vs 23.20 min and 187.46 vs 120.72 mg/kg, 
respectively. LY900014 significantly reduced the late insulin action, and shortened the duration of action 
compared to Humalog. In addition, the Rmax was slightly, but statistically significantly, higher following 
injection of LY900014 compared to Humalog. The ratio (95% CI) of geometric LS means for Rmax was

1.14  (1.01,  1.28).  The  total  amount  of  glucose  infused  during  the  clamp  was  comparable  between 
Humalog and LY900014, however.

Glucodynamics  of  LY900014  vs  Humalog  in  patients  with  T2D  were  investigated  in  study  ITRU.  The 
primary GD endpoints were early 50% tRmax, Gtot(0-30min) and tonset, which describe early insulin 
action.

LY900014 demonstrated an earlier glucose-lowering effect compared to Humalog for Gtot(0-30min) and 
tonset (p<0.0001 for each; completers analysis, N=37). The geometric LS means of Gtot(0-30min) and 
Tonset  for  LY900014  vs  Humalog  were  11.96  vs  2.82  mg/kg  and  32.10  vs  44.99  min,  respectively. 
However, the early 50% tRmax was comparable for LY900014 and Humalog: 53.78 min and 55.94 min, 
respectively. 
Gtot(0-1h), which was a secondary GD parameter in study ITRU, supported the conclusion of increased 
early insulin action of LY900014: the geometric LS mean of Gtot(0-1h) was 73.35 and 41.95 mg/kg for 
LY900014 and Humalog, respectively. In addition, the late insulin action as measured as the amount of 
glucose infused from 4 hours to the end of the clamp was reduced by 19% with LY900014 compared to 
Humalog.   
The ratio (95% CI) of GLS means of LY900014 and Humalog for Rmax and Gtot was 1.27 (1.11, 1.44) and 
1.12 (1.00, 1.26), respectively.

Meta-analysis of glucodynamics in glucose clamp studies: LY900014 vs Humalog 
A meta-analysis was conducted by the Applicant to summarize the glucodynamics during an euglycaemic 
clamp after SC administration of a single dose of either a 7, 15 or 30 U LY900014 compared to Humalog. 
The meta-analysis included clinical pharmacology studies conducted in healthy subjects, patients with 
T1D  and  T2D.  Studies  included  in  the  GD  meta-analysis  (ITRL,  ITRU,  ITRR,  ITSH)  used  the  final 
commercial formulation of LY900014, included Humalog as the comparator, collected GD data in a cross 
over study design, used similar timing for GD collection, and conducted comparisons between LY900014 
and Humalog using the same dose level. 
Forest plots were created that include the individual study 95% CIs using the analysis models presented 
in the clinical study reports. For the meta-analysis, GD parameters were compared between LY900014 
and Humalog using a mixed effects model with treatment and study as fixed effects and subject as a 
random effect. 
The  early  insulin  action  after  LY900014  compared  to  Humalog  was  characterized  using:  the  onset  of 
insulin  action,  the  early  50%  tRmax,  and  the  amount  of  glucose  infused  during  the  first  30  minutes 
[Gtot(0-30min)]  and  the  first  hour  [Gtot(0-1h)]  after  injection.  A  consistent  faster  insulin  action  with 
LY900014 compared to Humalog was observed across these parameters for all study populations in the 
clinical pharmacology studies (Figure 25). The onset of action (Tonset) was 10.33 minutes earlier and the 
early  50%  tRmax  was  reduced  by  12.31  minutes  with  LY900014  compared  to  Humalog  in  the 
meta-analysis. This faster onset of insulin action resulted in greater amount of glucose infused during the 
early part of the clamp with LY900014 than with Humalog. The largest increase was observed in the first 
30 minutes after injection. The treatment ratio between LY900014 and Humalog for Gtot(0-30min) was 
between  2.43  and  6.13  in  the  individual  studies  and  3.07  in  the  meta-analysis.  This  indicates  that 
LY900014 provided approximately 3 times more insulin action in the first 30 minutes after administration 
than  Humalog.  Significant  increases  in  early  insulin  action  was  also  demonstrated  at  1  hour  after 
injection. The treatment ratio between LY900014 and Humalog for the Gtot(0-1h) was between 1.56 and 
2.21 in the individual studies and 1.73 in the meta-analysis.

Figure  25.  Mean  treatment  difference  or  ratio  and  95%  CI  for  the  early  insulin  action  glucodynamic 
parameters in adults in individual studies and in the meta-analysis. 
The late insulin action after LY900014 compared to Humalog was characterized using: the duration of 
insulin  action,  the  timing of  the  late  50%  tRmax,  and  the  amount  of  glucose  infused  after two  hours 
[Gtot(2h-End)],  three  hours  to  the  end  of  clamp  [Gtot(3h-End)],  and  4  hours  to  the  end  of  clamp 
[Gtot(4h-End)]. The euglycaemic clamp was conducted over an 8-hour duration in Study ITRL, and over 
a 10-hour duration for all other studies in the meta-analysis. 
LY900014 reduced the late insulin action compared to Humalog across these parameters for all study 
populations (Figure 26). The most consistent reduction was shown in the Gtot(4h- End), which had a 
significant reduction in all of the individual studies. The treatment ratio between LY900014 and Humalog 
was between 0.46 and 0.84 in the individual studies and 0.65 in the meta-analysis. This indicates that 
LY900014 had 35% less insulin action after 4 hours than observed following Humalog administration.

The  overall  insulin  action  (Gtot)  was  similar  between  LY900014  and  Humalog,  both  in  the  individual 
studies  and  in  the  meta-analysis  (Figure 27).  The  faster  insulin  action  and  shorter duration  of insulin 
action following LY900014 administration resulted in a slightly higher Rmax compared to Humalog, which 
was a 12% increase from the meta-analysis.

Glucodynamics of LY900014 vs Humalog: mixed meal tolerance test 
A secondary objective of study ITRV was to evaluate the effect of injection-to-meal timings (SC injection 
immediately before the start of meal, and 20 minutes following the start of the meal) on the GD response 
to LY900014 compared to Humalog in patients with T1D. 
The primary GD endpoints were the area under the baseline subtracted glucose concentration vs time 
curve from time 0 to 2hr [ΔAUC(0-2h)] and area under the baseline subtracted glucose concentration vs 
time curve from time 0 to 5hr post meal [ΔAUC(0-5h)]. Baseline was defined as the average of glucose 
concentration at 30, 15, and 0 minutes prior to the start of the meal. A liquid mixed meal with 100 g 
carbohydrates was used in the study. The dose of insulin lispro (LY900014 or Humalog) was individualized 
per patient to cover the carbohydrate content of the test meal and was maintained over the study periods 
for each treatment. 
When the insulins were administered immediately before the start of the meal, LY900014 significantly 
reduced  the  early  postprandial  glucose  excursions  compared  with  Humalog,  and  a  trend  for  reduced 
overall  glucose  excursion  over  5-hour  postprandial  period  was  observed  (Figure  28).  The  LSM  of 
ΔAUC(0-2h)  and  ΔAUC(0-5h)  for  LY900014  vs  Humalog  were  2.55  vs  4.77  mmol∙h∙L-1  and  7.99  vs 
11.74 mmol∙h∙L-1,  respectively.  The  change  from  baseline  in  blood  glucose  at  1h  and  2h  post-meal 
(LY900014 vs Humalog) was 1.63 mmol/L vs 3.15 mmol/L and 1.81 vs 3.07 mmol/L, respectively. When 
the insulins were administered at 20 minutes following the start of the meal, LY900014 showed a trend 
towards a lower postprandial glucose excursion compared to Humalog (not clinically meaningful).

A secondary objective of study ITRW was to evaluate the effect of injection-to-meal timings (SC injection 
immediately before the start of meal, and 20 minutes following the start of the meal) on the GD response 
to LY900014 compared to Humalog in patients with T2D. 
The primary GD endpoints were the area under the baseline subtracted glucose concentration vs time 
curve from time 0 to 2hr [ΔAUC(0-2h)] and area under the baseline subtracted glucose concentration vs 
time curve from time 0 to 5hr post meal [ΔAUC(0-5h)]. Baseline was defined as the average of glucose 
concentration at 30, 15, and 0 minutes prior to the start of the meal. A liquid mixed meal with 100 g 
carbohydrates was used in the study. The dose of insulin lispro (LY900014 or Humalog) was individualized 
per patient to cover the carbohydrate content of the test meal and was maintained over the study periods 
for each treatment. 
LY900014 showed a trend towards a lower postprandial glucose excursion compared to Humalog at both 
of  the  meal-to-dose  timing  intervals  (immediately  before  the  start  of  the  test  meal  and  20  minutes 
following the start of the test meal) (Figure 29). However, this did not reach statistical significance for the 
primary GD endpoints ΔAUC(0-2h) and ΔAUC(0-5h).

A secondary objective of study ITSC was to evaluate the difference in GD response when LY900014 and 
Humalog were administered as different test bolus doses with an insulin pump to patients with T1D during 
a breakfast meal test, and to compare the durability of GD response over 3 days when LY900014 and 
Humalog are administered as different test bolus doses with an insulin pump to patients with T1D during 
a breakfast meal test. LY900014 and Humalog bolus doses were given immediately before the breakfast 
test meal; see section 3.3.1 of this assessment report for further information on the bolus doses used in 
study ITSC. 
The primary GD endpoints were the area under the baseline subtracted glucose concentration vs time 
curve from time 0 to 1h, 0 to 2h and 0 to 5h post breakfast [ΔAUC(0-1h), ΔAUC(0-2h) and ΔAUC(0-5h), 
respectively]. Baseline was defined as the average of glucose concentration at 30, 15, and 0 minutes prior 
to the start of the breakfast. 
Mean postprandial glucose concentrations after LY900014 and Humalog with a standard single-wave (SS) 
bolus dose on Day 1 and Day 3 are presented in Figure 30. On Day 1, the ratio (90% CI) of LS means 
(LY900014:Humalog) was 0.55 (0.27, 0.83), 0.38 (0.03, 0.70) and 0.72 (0.30, 1.34) for ΔAUC(0-1h), 
ΔAUC(0-2h) and ΔAUC(0-5h), respectively, and on Day 3, the ratio (90% CI) of LS means was 0.60 (0.32, 
0.82), 0.67 (0.31, 0.94), and 1.11 (0.82, 1.47). Data post intervention for hypo- or hyperglycaemia is

Dose-response relationship 
Glucodynamics  following  7  U,  15  U  and  30  U  SC  injection  of  LY900014  was  investigated  in  healthy 
subjects  and  compared  to  GD  of  Humalog  in  a  randomised,  subject-  and  investigator-blind,  6-period 
complete crossover euglycaemic clamp study ITSH.

level.  The  mean  LOESS  GIR  profile  increased  per  dose  level  following  administration  of  LY900014, 
indicating greater insulin action with increasing dose. The increase in Rmax and Gtot was less than dose 
proportional  (Figure  33),  however,  indicating  that  the  higher  doses  approached  the  top  of  the 
dose-response curve in the study population of healthy, presumably insulin-sensitive subjects. Notably,

at each dose level, the total amount of glucose infused over the duration of the clamp was similar for 
LY900014 and Humalog, and left shifting of the GIR curve was observed (Figure 34).

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioanalytical methods used in the clinical studies were, overall, appropriate.  
Overall, the design of clinical pharmacology studies was adequate. Clinical study reports do not indicate 
any  misconduct.  Pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  of  the  commercial  LY900014  100  U/mL

formulation were thoroughly investigated in healthy subjects and in the target population (patients with 
T1D  and  T2D).  Study  reports  of  several  clinical  pharmacology  trials  conducted  with  developmental 
formulations were provided by the Applicant, which is acknowledged. Results of these studies are not 
essential for the benefit/risk assessment of the final formulation, however, and they are not described in 
this assessment report. 
Comparable  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  between  LY900014  200  U/mL  and  LY900014 
100 U/mL  formulations  was  demonstrated  in  a  euglycaemic  glucose  clamp  study  in  healthy  subjects. 
Benefit/risk conclusions on the LY900014 100 U/mL formulation used in the pivotal phase 3 studies can be 
extrapolated to the LY900014 200 U/mL formulation. Of note, according to the proposed SmPC, the 200 
U/mL formulation should not be administered intravenously or using a continuous subcutaneous insulin 
infusion pump. This is endorsed, to avoid medication errors.  
Absolute  bioavailability  of  LY900014  following  SC  injection  into  the  abdomen,  deltoid,  and  thigh,  was 
approximately 65%. Pharmacokinetics and glucodynamic effects are similar following SC injection into 
the abdomen and deltoid. Following SC injection into the thigh, the average Cmax was approximately 
17% lower compared with injection into the abdomen, but the absorbed total amount was the same. The 
maximal glucose-lowering effect was observed slightly later following injection into the thigh compared 
with  injection  into  the  abdomen.  It  is  known  that  the  site  of  injection  affects  the  absorption  rate  of 
insulins.  In  section  4.2  of  the  proposed  SmPC,  it  is  stated  that  LY900014  can  be  injected  into  the 
abdomen,  upper  arm,  thigh  or  buttocks.  Buttocks  were  not  used  as  injection  site  in  the  clinical 
pharmacology program of LY900014. Buttocks may have been used for injection by patients in the Phase 
3 studies, but no records thereof exist. However, considering the historical use of buttocks as an injection 
site for Humalog, the same injection sites can be approved for LY900014, since a cross-reference is added 
to section 5.2, reporting the absence of data for this injection site. As with other insulins, intravenous 
administration  can  be  appropriate  in  hospital  settings  under  special  circumstances  (e.g.  during 
ketoacidosis). 
Administration of LY900014 using a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pump resulted in 
slightly faster absorption and slightly lower or comparable postprandial blood glucose levels compared 
with Humalog. The results support administration of LY900014 100 U/mL formulation using a CSII pump. 
The  pharmacokinetic  results  of  euglycaemic  clamp  studies  robustly  support  the  conclusion  that  the 
absorption rate of insulin lispro following SC injection of LY900014 is increased compared with Humalog. 
The studies were conducted in presumably insulin-sensitive healthy subjects and in the target population 
of T1D and T2D patients, and very similar results were observed in each population. Left shifting of the 
concentration-time curve was constantly observed for LY900014 compared with Humalog. Statistically 
significant  difference  between  LY900014  and  Humalog  was  shown  for  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of 
early  insulin  exposure  [AUC(0-15min),  AUC(0-30min),  AUC(0-1h),  time  to  early  half  maximal  drug 
concentration (early 50% tmax), and onset of appearance] in each study. Results of the meta-analysis 
indicated that approximately 8 times, 3 times, and 1.5 times more insulin lispro exposure was provided 
after SC injection of LY900014 than of Humalog for the first 15, 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. In the 
meta-analysis  of  studies  in  healthy  subjects  and  T1D  and  T2D  patients,  the  faster  absorption  was 
associated with a slightly higher Cmax for LY900014 compared with Humalog (1.14-fold Cmax; upper limit 
of 95% CI approximately 1.20). The slightly higher Cmax is not expected to be clinically relevant for most 
subjects, although patients that are very insulin-sensitive might have increased risk for hypoglycaemia if 
they switch from Humalog to LY900014. This is addressed in section 4.4 of the proposed SmPC. Total 
insulin  exposure  [AUC(0-∞]  was  comparable  following  administration  of  LY900014  and  Humalog, 
supporting  the  statement  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC  that  change  from  another  mealtime  insulin  to 
LY900014 can be done on unit-to-unit basis. Late exposure to insulin lispro (e.g. AUC from 3h to end of 
PK sampling) was reduced for LY900014 compared with Humalog, which can be expected because the 
overall exposure was comparable and the early exposure was increased. 
Assessment report

Likewise,  the  pharmacodynamic  results  of  euglycaemic  clamp  studies  robustly  support  the  conclusion 
that the glucose-lowering effect of insulin lispro following SC injection of LY900014 takes place faster 
compared with Humalog, in line with the faster absorption of insulin lispro. Results of the meta-analysis 
demonstrated  that  the  time  of  onset  was  approximately  10  minutes  earlier  and  that  approximately  3 
times and 1.73 times more glucose was needed to be infused to maintain euglycaemia over the first 30 
minutes and 60 minutes, respectively, following administration of LY900014 than of Humalog. Differences 
in other glucodynamic parameters were in line with the observed pharmacokinetic differences as well. The 
total glucose infused in the clamp was comparable between LY900014 and Humalog, maximum glucose 
infusion rate was approximately 12% higher for LY900014, and lower amount of glucose was needed to 
be infused to maintain euglycaemia in the late stage (after 3 to 4 hours after the start) of the clamp. 
The effect of timing of the injection (immediately before the meal or 20 minutes after the start of the 
meal)  on  postprandial  glucose  excursion  was  investigated  in  patients  with  T1D  and  T2D  using  a 
standardised  liquid  mixed  meal  tolerance  test.  It  was  demonstrated  in  both  patient  groups  at  both 
injection times that the efficacy of LY900014 to control the postprandial increase of blood glucose was at 
least comparable with that of Humalog, and for some glucodynamic endpoints statistically significantly 
and clinically relevant better efficacy of LY900014 was observed. In addition, it was clearly demonstrated 
that  the  efficacy  of  both  LY900014  and  Humalog  is  better  when  they  are  injected  before  the  meal 
compared  with  injection  20 minutes  after  the  start  of  the  meal.  The  SmPC  states  that  “Liumjev  is  a 
mealtime insulin for subcutaneous injection and should be administered zero to two minutes before the 
start of the meal, with the option to administer up to 20 minutes after starting the meal (see section 5.1)”. 
It is known that the efficacy of mealtime insulins is reduced if they are administered after the meal. It is 
acknowledged, however, that sometimes the patient cannot or simply forgets to administer the mealtime 
insulin before the meal. In such situations, it is preferable to administer the insulin after the start of the 
meal rather than not take mealtime insulin at all. The time limit of 20 minutes after starting a meal in the 
proposed SmPC has been investigated and is acceptable from clinical pharmacology perspective. 
The absorption and the glucose-lowering effect following SC injection of LY900014 was similarly faster 
compared with Humalog in younger adults (18 to 45 years) and in elderly subjects (≥65 years). 
Pharmacokinetic data in paediatric population is not yet available. The proposed therapeutic indication is 
for adults, and lack of paediatric data is sufficiently addressed in the product information. 
After  absorption  of  insulin  lispro  into  the  systemic  circulation,  the  overall  exposure  (AUC0-∞)  is 
comparable,  and  it  is  expected  that  distribution,  elimination,  and  drug  interactions  are  the  same  for 
LY900014 and Humalog. It was agreed in the scientific advice given by the CHMP in 2016 that, therefore, 
pharmacokinetic studies in subjects with impaired renal and hepatic function and drug-drug interaction 
studies would not be required for LY900014 and referring to studies conducted previously with Humalog 
is acceptable. The wording on subjects with impaired renal and hepatic function and drug interactions in 
the proposed product information is in line with the product information of Humalog, which is acceptable. 
To avoid any potential impact of local vasodilation by treprostinil on absorption of another insulin injected 
at the same time with LY900014, some wording has been added to the SmPC and PL to instruct patients 
to use a different injection site in these situations.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  of  LY900014  have  been  investigated  in  sufficient  detail. 
Overall, the results of the clinical pharmacology studies support the conclusion that the absorption rate of 
insulin lispro following SC injection of LY900014 is increased compared with Humalog, which is associated 
with faster glucose-lowering effect.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No  dose-finding  studies  were  performed.  The  pharmacology  program  shows  that  even  though  the 
time-action curve is shifted left with LY900014 in comparison with Humalog, the overall glucose lowering 
effect  of  LY900014  is  comparable  to  that  of  Humalog.  Hence,  overall,  one  unit  of  LY90000014 
corresponds to one unit of Humalog. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The efficacy data supporting this marketing authorization application are based on three pivotal Phase 3 
studies: 
• 
Two multiple daily injection studies: ITRM (T1D) and ITRN (T2D) 
•  A continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion study: ITSI (T1D) 
A  total  of  421  healthy  subjects  and  342  patients  with  T1D  or  T2D  were  exposed  to  LY900014  in  the 
22 completed clinical pharmacology trials. Altogether 1944 patients with T1D or T2D received study drug 
(LY900014 or the active comparator Humalog) in the Phase 3 studies, of which 1165 received LY900014. 
The proportion of EU-patients in the Phase 3 studies were in the ITRM, 667/1316 (50.7%); in the ITRN, 
234/750 (31.2%) and in ITSI 31/49 (63.3%). 
The  overall  development plan  including  the  three  studies  was  accepted  by  the  CHMP  during  scientific 
advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/400498/2016) to be sufficient for an indication in adults T1D and T2D subjects. 
For the reader: Throughout the AR, %-units have been used for reporting HbA1c and mmol/L for glucose 
concentrations.  If  conversion  between  SI-  and  non-SI  units  for  HbA1c  and  glucose  concentration  is 
needed, conversion tables can be found on the following websites:

Methods 
Studies ITRM and ITRN evaluated the safety and efficacy of LY900014 when administered as a prandial 
insulin as part of a multiple daily injection (MDI) regimen in adult patients with T1D and T2D, respectively. 
Studies ITRM and ITRN both included an 8-week lead-in period; a 12-week intensive titration period; and 
a 26-week controlled period assessing non-inferiority based on change in HbA1c of LY900014 compared 
with Humalog (primary objective). 
ITRM was a Phase 3 prospective, randomized, outpatient, multinational, multicentre, 3-treatment group, 
parallel, active-controlled study conducted in patients with T1D currently using an MDI regimen. In 2 of 
the treatment groups, LY900014 and Humalog were administered immediately (0-2 minutes) prior to 
each meal in a double-blind manner. A third treatment group consisted of LY900014 administered 20 
minutes after the start of a meal (LY900014+20) open-label, as it was not possible to blind this treatment 
group with different injection timing. (Figure 35). 
In  ITRM,  patients  in  the  2  blinded  treatment  groups  continued  with  double-blind  treatment  for  an 
additional  26  weeks,  for  a  total  of  52  weeks.  This  was  followed  by  a  4-week  safety  follow-up  period. 
Patients  who  completed  the  4-week  safety  follow-up  visit  (Visit  801)  and  had  treatment-emergent 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020

anti-insulin lispro antibodies that had not returned to prespecified baseline range (Visit 2) were asked to 
participate in follow-up to monitor antibody levels. The assessment of immunogenicity included analyses 
of  treatment-emergent  anti-insulin  lispro  antibody  up  to  Visit  801  and  analyses  of  anti-insulin  lispro 
antibody return to baseline during the insulin lispro antibody safety follow-up period. 
Figure 35. Study design, ITRM (T1DM) 
An Addendum (ITRM CGM substudy) to the study compared LY900014 and Humalog with respect to 
the incremental AUC0-2hours after breakfast obtained from up to 14 days of CGM use at Week 26. Blinded 
CGM was planned to be offered to a subgroup of up to 315 patients (105 per treatment group) at selected 
sites in Study ITRM. 
ITRN  was  a  Phase  3,  prospective,  double-blind,  randomized,  outpatient,  multinational,  multicenter, 
2-group,  parallel,  active-controlled  study  conducted  in  patients  with  T2D  currently  treated  with  basal 
insulin in combination with at least 1 prandial insulin injection or premixed insulin with at least 2 injections 
daily (figure 36)

Figure 36. Study design, ITRN (T2D) 
Study  ITRM  (T1D)  was  stratified  by  country,  HbA1c  at  entry,  type  of  basal  insulin  during  the  lead-in 
period, and prandial insulin dosing plan at randomization. Study ITRN was stratified by country, HbA1c at 
entry, type of basal insulin during the lead-in period, and number of prandial insulin doses at entry. 
At Week 0 after completion of the MMTT, patients in: 
•  Study  ITRM  were  randomized  (4:4:3)  to  either  LY900014  (blinded)  at  mealtime  or  Humalog 
(blinded) at mealtime, or LY900014+20 (open-label) post-meal 
•  Study  ITRN  were  randomized  (1:1)  to  either  LY900014  (blinded)  at  mealtime  or  Humalog 
(blinded) at mealtime. 
A  treat-to-target  approach  to  diabetes  management  was  implemented  in  both  studies.  The  protocols 
provided prespecified glycaemic targets and recommended basal and prandial insulin dose algorithms for 
guidance.  The  prescribed  basal  and  prandial  insulin  dose  was  however  determined  by,  and  the 
responsibility of the investigator. The treat-to-target approach was used in 3 different periods: 
• 
• 
• 
basal insulin titration during the 8-week lead-in period (optimization of basal insulin) 
prandial insulin titration during the 12-week intensive titration period 
basal  and  prandial  insulin  adjustments  during  the  14-week  maintenance  period  to  address 
hypoglycaemia or unacceptable hyperglycaemia. 
Prandial insulin was individually determined by either: 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 75/177 
 
 
 
 
• 
Pattern adjustment: The patient was prescribed a fixed dose or dose range of insulin for each 
meal. The fixed dose or dose range of insulin may have been individualized for each meal.  
or 
•  Carbohydrate  counting:  If  the  patient  performed  carbohydrate  counting  for  prandial  insulin 
dosing (insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio plan) prior to study enrolment, this plan may have been 
continued  during  the  study.  The  prandial  insulin  dose  was  based  on  the  patient  estimated 
carbohydrate content of the meal (as unit insulin per grams carbohydrate). 
Protocol deviations occurred in 9.2% (112/1222) of patients in the ITRM (T1D) and 16.2% (109/673) in 
the ITRN. As the deviations were scattered across the three study arms, they are not considered to have 
relevant effect on the results of the analyses.  
Table 10 presents key inclusion and exclusion criteria, study treatments, glycaemic targets, stratification 
factors and participating countries for studies ITRM and ITRN. ITRM was conducted at 166 study centres 
in 18 countries, and ITRN at 131 study centres in 15 countries.

Table 11. Phase 3 MDI studies in T1D (ITRM) and T2D (ITRN) (continued)
Mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) 
In both studies, patients were to arrive at the investigative site with a fasting BG in the range of 3.9 to 
10.0 mmol/L). Insulin doses used during the MMTT were individualized based on a patient’s ICR or dosing 
recommendations provided in the protocol. Patients were asked to: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
inject basal insulin according to their usual schedule 
avoid major changes in dietary intake or physical activity during the 3 days 
avoid administering correction doses with study insulins within 4 hours prior of the start of the 
MMTT 
consume the liquid test meal (~100 grams of carbohydrate and ~700 kcal) within 15 minutes 
ITSI  was  a  2-treatment,  2-period  (6-week  treatment  each)  crossover  design  trial  that  evaluated  the 
safety and compatibility of LY900014 in the treatment of patients with T1D when administered via CSII. 
The  study  was  designed  to  compare  LY900014  and  Humalog  with  respect  to  the  rate 
(events/patient/30 days) of infusion set failures that led to premature infusion set changes due to a pump 
occlusion alarm OR due to unexplained hyperglycaemia with blood glucose (SMBG >13.9 mmol/L) that 
did not decrease within 1 hour following a correction bolus delivered via the pump. The study included a 
1-week screening period and a 2-week lead-in period followed by a 2-period crossover and a 4-week 
post-treatment safety follow-up. Each period of the crossover consisted of 6 weeks of treatment with no 
washout between periods (Figure 37).

Patients currently treated with a rapid-acting insulin analogue via CSII were eligible for inclusion in the 
trial. All patients were transferred to Humalog at Visit 2 so that all patients were using Humalog during the 
lead-in period. Patients were required to have been using the MiniMed 530G, MiniMed 630G (US) or 640G 
(EU) insulin pump. The bolus delivery speed for all pumps was set to standard speed (1.5 U/minute) for 
the duration of the lead-in and treatment phases of the study. The purpose of the lead-in period (prior to 
randomization) was to obtain preliminary diagnostic tests, determine baseline hypoglycaemia rate, and 
evaluate pump basal rates and bolus calculator settings (carbohydrate ratio [CR], insulin sensitivity factor 
[ISF],  and  active  insulin  time  [AIT]  for  calculating  mealtime  and  correction  bolus  doses)  for 
appropriateness.

Study Participants  
Please refer to the information presented in the section below (Treatments). 
Treatments 
ITRM (T1D) and ITRN (T2D) 
Basal insulin options were limited to insulin glargine (once or twice daily) or insulin degludec. Patients 
were asked to maintain basal insulin dose timing and frequency throughout the study. 
Mealtime insulin: All patients using insulin aspart, insulin glulisine, regular insulin, or premixed insulin 
were transferred to Humalog at Visit 2 (screening) so that all patients were receiving Humalog throughout 
the lead-in period. At visit 8, patients were randomized to either preprandial LY900014 or preprandial 
Humalog  at  each  meal  in  both  ITRM  and  ITRN.  ITRM  also  contained  a  third  arm,  open-label,  with 
postprandially injected LY900014 up to Week 26. During the long-term maintenance period (weeks from 
26  to  52)  of  ITRM,  only  the  double-blind  arms  of  ITRM  were  continued  (except  in  Japan,  where  the 
treatment period ended after 52 weeks). (Figures 3.3.5.1 and 3.3.5.2, Tables 3.3.1 and 3.3.5.1) 
Study  medication:  Study  insulins  (LY900014  and  Humalog)  were  provided  in  blinded  prefilled  pens 
containing  a  concentration  of  100  U/mL  in  3-mL  cartridges  of  either  LY900014  or  Humalog.  The 
open-label prefilled pens in ITRM contained a concentration of 100 U/mL of LY900014. In both ITRM and 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020

ITRN, LY900014 and Humalog was injected 0-2 minutes prior to meal. In ITRM, the postprandial injection 
of LY900014 was instructed to be injected 20 minutes post-meal. 
ITSI (T1D, CSII) 
All patients were transferred from their pre-trial prandial insulin to use Humalog during the lead-in period. 
Dexcom G5 was used by all patients in real-time mode beginning at Visit 2 and continuing throughout the 
treatment phase of the study. At Visit 3 (Randomization Visit), patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 
the  2  treatment  sequences  of  double-blind  LY900014  and  Humalog.  During  the  study,  patients  were 
expected to use the pump’s bolus calculator to determine mealtime and correction bolus doses. 
Objectives 
The efficacy objectives of ITRM and ITRN are presented in table 12, and of ITSI, in table 13.

Table 13. Efficacy objectives of of ITSI (T1D, CSII) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The outcomes/ endpoints are given in the section above on Objectives. 
Sample size 
In ITRM and ITRN, following assumptions for the primary endpoint, the change from baseline to 26 weeks 
in  HbA1c,  were  made  in  the  sample  size  calculations:  a  NIM  of  0.4%,  no  true  difference  between 
treatment arms, a SD of 1.1%, and a 15% dropout rate for 26 weeks. 
In ITRM 371 completers were aimed in each double-blind treatment group, and in ITRN 284 completers 
in each group. This leads to at least 99% power to show non-inferiority between LY900014 and Humalog. 
If a lower NIM 0.3% was used, in ITRM 95% power was reached and in ITRN 90%. 
In  ITRM  with  4:4:3  randomization  ratio  (LY900014,  Humalog,  and  LY900014+20),  approximately 
1199 patients  needed  to  be  randomized,  and  in  ITRN  approximately  670  patients  needed  to  be 
randomized. 
The ITSI study did not state any statistical hypothesis, and thus was not statistically powered. 
Randomisation 
Patients who met all criteria for enrollment were randomized to double-blind treatment at Visit 8 in ITRM 
and ITRN. 
In  ITRM  patients  were  randomized  to  double-blind  LY900014,  double-blind  Humalog,  or  open-label 
LY900014+20 in a 4:4:3 ratio. Stratification was by country, HbA1c stratum (≤7.5%, >7.5% at Visit 7), 
type of basal insulin during the lead-in period (glargine U-100 or degludec U-100), and prandial insulin 
dosing plan at randomization (carbohydrate counting, pattern adjustment). 
In ITRN patients were randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups in 1:1 ratio (double-blind LY900014 
administered  at  mealtime  or  double-blind  Humalog  administered  at  mealtime).  Stratification  was  by 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 80/177 
 
 
 
 
country,  HbA1c  stratum  (≤8.0%,  >8.0%  at  Visit  7),  type  of  basal  insulin  received  during  the  lead-in 
period (insulin glargine U-100 or insulin degludec [U-100 or U-200]), and number of prandial doses at 
study entry (<3, ≥3). 
In ITSI, patients who completed the lead-in period were randomized to double-blind treatment at Visit 3. 
Patients were randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment sequences in a 1:1 ratio: Sequence A: LY900014 → 
Humalog or Sequence B: Humalog →  LY900014. 
Stratification  was  by  region  (US,  outside  of  the  US  [OUS]),  historical  use  of  SmartGuard/Threshold 
Suspend (Yes, No), and HbA1c stratum (≤7.3%, >7.3% at Visit 1). 
Assignment  to  treatment  groups  (Studies  ITRM  and  ITRN)  or  treatment  sequences  (Study  ITSI)  was 
performed as a permuted block randomisation within each combination of stratification factors. 
Blinding (masking) 
In  ITRM  and  ITRN,  the  treatment  groups,  LY900014  and  Humalog,  were  administered  immediately 
(0-2 minutes)  prior  to  each  meal  in  a  double-blind  manner.  The  blinded  prefilled  pens  contained  a 
concentration of 100 U/mL in 3-mL cartridges of either LY900014 or Humalog. Investigators, patients, 
and  study  site  personnel  were  blinded  to  assigned  dosing  regimens,  throughout  the  study.  A  third 
open-label treatment group in ITRM consisted of LY900014 administered 20 minutes after the start of a 
meal (LY900014+20). 
In ITSI study both treatment groups, LY900014 and Humalog, had basal rates and bolus doses given via 
CSII.  Investigators,  patients,  and  study  site  personnel  were  blinded  to  assigned  dosing  regimens 
throughout the study. 
To preserve the blinding of the studies, the Applicant study teams were blinded to double-blind treatment 
assignments until after the primary endpoint database lock, and no changes were made to the database 
after unblinding. 
Statistical methods 
In all studies, the primary patient population was called randomized and defined as all patients who were 
randomly assigned to study treatment or treatment sequence. Treatment group was defined on the basis 
of the randomization. 
In ITRM and ITRN the analyses for the primary and multiplicity adjusted objectives were performed for 
the intention-to-treat (ITT) estimand (including all data collected through Week 26, regardless of IP use) 
and the efficacy estimand (including data collected prior to discontinuation of IP through Week 26). 
For the analysis of HbA1c using the ITT estimand, imputation of missing data at week 26 utilized the 
patient-level observed baseline value plus noise. For the efficacy estimand, missing data were addressed 
by using a mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis for continuous longitudinal variables. 
The model for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HbA1c included the 
fixed class effects of treatment, strata (pooled country, type of basal insulin, and number of prandial 
doses at study entry), visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates 
of baseline value. 
An ANCOVA model with strata and treatment as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate was used to 
analyze  the  1-hour  and  2-hour  PPG  excursions  for  both  the  efficacy  and  ITT  estimands.  As  the  PPG 
excursions were only measured twice: at baseline and week 26, the subjects who did not have data either 
at baseline or at week 26 were excluded from the analysis, and as a consequence the estimated treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 81/177 
 
 
 
effect for ITT estimand was rather efficacy estimand than ITT, which is eventually deemed to be negligible 
as far as the treatment effect was concerned.  
The  applicant  conducted  several  pre-planned  subgroup  analysis  for  the  primary  endpoint  using  the 
efficacy estimand.  
As there were no hypothesis stated in ITSI trial, all statistical analyses are descriptive in nature.

A total of 34 patients (Humalog, 18 patients [5.3%]; LY900014, 16 patients [4.8%]) discontinued the 
study  early  during  the  randomization  to  safety  follow-up  period.  The  most  common  reason  for  study 
discontinuation in each group was withdrawal by subject. There were no statistically significant treatment 
differences in number of patients discontinued or in the reasons for discontinuation. The death in the 
Humalog  treatment  group  was  reported  as  study  discontinuation  due  to  death  and  treatment 
discontinuation due to an AE (sudden death). The 2 deaths in the LY900014 group were reported as study 
and treatment discontinuation due to death.

Recruitment 
ITRN: First patient visit occurred on 14 July 2017 and first patient was randomised on 19 September 
2017. Of a total of 750 patients entered to the study, 234 were from the EU (Czech Republic, Germany, 
Hungary, Italy, Slovakia, and Spain). The non-EU sites were situated in the US, Argentina, Australia, 
India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, and Taiwan. 
ITRM: First patient’s visit for ITRM and for the CGM Addendum occurred on 17 July 2017 and first patient 
was randomised on 12 September 2017 for both. Altogether 667/1316 patients were entered from the EU 
(Austria, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, and Sweden); the non-EU sites were 
situated in the US, Argentina, Australia, India, Japan, Russia, and Taiwan. 
ITSI: Five principal investigators (endocrinologists specializing in diabetes) conducted the study: three in 
the US (26 entered patients) and two in Spain (31 entered patients). First patient visit occurred on 21 
February 2018; first patient was randomised on 14 March 2018. 
Conduct of the study 
The overall conduct of the studies is acceptable. Protocol deviations were not deemed to have affected 
study results.

arms. As expectable for a small study, some differences in characteristics between study arms are seen, 
which however are not regarded as relevant for interpretation of the obtained results (Table 16).

Numbers analysed 
Efficacy analyses were conducted for all randomized patients according to treatment assignment. The 
analyses for the primary and multiplicity adjusted objectives were performed for the efficacy estimand 
(including data collected prior to permanent discontinuation of IP) and for the ITT estimand (including all 
data collected, regardless of IP use). 
Compliance of the timing of prandial insulin administration relative to time of meal in study ITRM was not 
optimal, especially for post-meal dosing. When all postbaseline visits for the morning meal were included, 
the  respective  proportions  were  as  follows:  LY900014,  n=179  (90.9%);  Humalog,  n=174  (84.1%);

LY900014+20, n=96 (64.9%). At Week 26, as well as for the overall mean at the midday and evening 
meals, the proportions of patients with average dose times within the protocol-specified time window 
were similar to the proportions at the morning meal. The mean dosing time in LY900014+20 group was 
15.3-15.4  minutes,  depending  on  meal  (morning,  midday,  evening).  However,  it  is  assuring  for 
interpretation  of  study  results  that  the  median  administration  time  in  the  LY900014+20  group  was 
between 19.2 to 19.4 minutes; hence, most patients injected the insulin according to protocol. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The summary of efficacy endpoint for ITRM (T1D) and ITRN (T2D) is shown for the efficacy estimand 
results (table 17).

the Graphical Approach (Efficacy Estimand) (in mmol/mol and mmol/L) 
Summary of Primary and Multiplicity Adjusted Efficacy Results for Phase 3 MDI Studies Using the 
Graphical Approach (Efficacy Estimand) (in % and mg/dL)  
In both Studies ITRM and ITRN, the primary objective was achieved; mealtime LY900014 was confirmed 
to be noninferior to Humalog for glycaemic control as measured by change in HbA1c at both NIMs of 0.4% 
and 0.3%. 
Multiplicity-adjusted  objectives  (H2  and  H3)  were  achieved;  mealtime  LY900014  was  superior  to 
Humalog in controlling 1-hour and 2-hour PPG excursions in the efficacy estimand. 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020

Multiplicity-adjusted objective (H4) was not achieved; mealtime LY900014 was not superior to Humalog 
for glycaemic control as measured by change in HbA1c with the efficacy estimand. Similar results were 
observed in the ITT estimand. However, one difference between efficacy estimand and ITT analyses in the 
MDI studies was seen in ITRM. In T1D patients in ITRM, mealtime LY900014 was superior to Humalog for 
glycaemic control (H4) for the ITT estimand, though the efficacy estimand did not show superiority. 
The sensitivity analyses for the efficacy and ITT estimands support the findings of the primary analyses in 
both T1D patients (ITRM) and T2D patients (ITRN). 
The HbA1c results are given below for the ITT estimand: 
ITRM (T1D): 
From a similar baseline HbA1c level (7.33 %, 7.34 %, and 7.36 %), the change in HbA1c at week 26 was 
−0.00,  −0.18  and  +0.05  %-units  for  Humalog,  LY900014,  and  LY900014+20,  respectively  (ITT 
estimand). 
The LSM difference results for HbA1c (%) in the ITT estimand calculations for the different comparisons 
were as follows (95% CI), p-value, at week 26: 
• 
• 
• 
LY900014 vs. Humalog: -0.08 (-0.161,-0.003), p=0.041 
LY900014+20 vs. Humalog: 0.14 (0.053, 0.226), p=0.002 
LY900014+20 versus LY900014: 0.22 (0.136,0.307), p<0.001 
ITRN (T2D): 
From a similar baseline HbA1c level (Humalog 7.31 %, LY900014 7.28 %), the change in HbA1c at week 
26 was −0.46 and −0.43 %-units for Humalog and LY900014 respectively (ITT estimand). 
The LSM difference for HbA1c (%) in the ITT estimand calculation was as follows (95% CI), p-value, at 
week 26: 
• 
LY900014 vs. Humalog: 0.03 (−0.08,0.13), p=0.624 
Evolution of glycaemic control during the study 
As  the  studies  were  conducted  according  to  the  treat-to-target  principle,  there  was  a  marked 
improvement  in  glycaemic  control  in  all  study  arms  in  T1D  (ITRM)  and  T2D  (ITRN).  Most  of  the 
improvement already occurred during the lead-in period, when basal insulin was titrated to be optimal, 
and  all  patients  were  administered  Humalog  as  prandial  insulin.  Some  further  improvement  occurred 
during the intensive titration phase, when prandial insulins were titrated to optimal (figure 41).

In both MDI studies, LY900014 was superior to Humalog in controlling 1- and 2-hour PPG excursions 
following the MMTT, when both were administered 0-2 minutes prior to meal. The results for ITRM are

The results on the ITT analysis are concordant with the efficacy estimand analysis. 
The first (H2) and second (H3) multiplicity adjusted objectives were achieved. 
LY900014 was statistically superior to Humalog in controlling 1-hour and 2-hour PPG excursions in both 
T1D and T2D. 
In T1D (ITRM), 
•  At 1 hour, the LSM difference was −1.53 mmol/L (p<0.001; ITT estimand) 
•  At 2 hours, the LSM difference was −1.69 mmol/L (p<0.001; ITT estimand) 
In T2D (ITRN),  
•  At 1 hour, the LSM difference was −0.67 mmol/L (p<0.001; ITT estimand) 
•  At 2 hours, the LSM difference was −0.98 mmol/L (p<0.001; ITT estimand) 
The PPG excursions were significantly lower in the LY900014 group vs. Humalog group from the time 
point of 15 minutes after the test meal up to 4 hours post-meal in T1D and from 30 minutes after the test 
meal up to 4 hours post-meal in T2D (Figure 3.3.5.5). 
Mean PPG excursions in T1D patients (ITRM) according to the ITT estimand at Week 26 were as follows in 
the different study arms: 
LY900014 versus Humalog: 
• 
statistically significantly lower at all time points from 15 minutes to 4 hours 
LY900014+20 versus Humalog:

Incremental  areas  under  the  serum  glucose  concentration-time  curve  (iAUC)  were  determined  in  the 
ITRM (T1D) based on samples collected in the MMTT from 0 to 30 minutes, 0 to 1 hour, 0 to 2 hours, 0 to 
3 hours, and 0 to 4 hours after a meal. Maximum serum glucose after a meal was collected, and glucose 
variability measured by the coefficient of variation and standard deviation (SD). The results for the time

periods 0−30 min, 0−60 min, 0−120 min, 0−180 min, and 0−240 min are separately tabulated in the 
interim CSR for baseline and 26 weeks (in units [mg*min/dL], data not included in this AR). 
At Week 26, the iAUC during MMTT was: 
• 
statistically significantly lower in LY900014 versus Humalog at all time intervals (0-30 minutes, 
0-1 hour, 0-2 hours, 0-3 hours, and 0-4 hours) 
• 
statistically significantly higher in LY900014+20 versus Humalog at 0-30 minutes and 0-1 hour, 
but similar at 0-2 hours, 0-3 hours, and 0-4 hours 
• 
statistically  significantly  higher  in  LY900014+20  versus  LY900014  at  all  time  intervals 
(0-30 minutes, 0-1 hour, 0-2 hours, 0-3 hours, and 0-4 hours). 
The  iAUC  results  from  ITRM  are  concordant  with  the  primary  and  multiplicity-adjusted  secondary 
endpoints.  
In  ITRM,  glucose  variability  was  derived  from  the  glucose  values  collected  during  MMTT.  A  small 
difference was seen in the standard deviation (SD) of blood glucose during in favour of LY900014 vs. 
Humalog: the difference in SD was 0.43 mmol/L (2.97 versus 3.40 mmol/L, p<0.001). There was no 
difference  between  LY900014+20  vs.  Humalog.  However,  SD  was  higher  when  LY900014  was  given 
postprandially vs. preprandially: difference in SD 0.23 mmol/L (3.21 versus 2.97 mmol/L, p=0.027). The 
other  measure  of  variability,  coefficient  for  variation  (CV)  demonstrated  no  differences  between  the 
products over the time of MMTT. These minor differences are not considered clinically relevant. 
Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) substudy in ITRM (T1D) 
A total of 269 patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and wore the CGM device during 
at least 1 collection period (either baseline or postbaseline) (LY900014, 97; Humalog, 99; LY900014+20, 
73) were included in the CGM analyses. 
Incremental Glucose AUC 
LY900014 statistically significantly reduced the postprandial glucose iAUC0-2hrs after breakfast at Week 26 
when  compared  to  Humalog  (approximately  51%  reduction).  These  reductions  were  also  statistically 
significant for comparisons of iAUC0-3hrs (approximately 70% reduction) and iAUC0-4hrs (approximately 
87% reduction) (Figure 43). 
The  iAUC  for  mealtime  LY900014  was  also  statistically  significantly  lower  than  Humalog  for  all  time 
intervals tested when all meals were combined. 
LY900014+20  was  not  statistically  significantly  different  in  postprandial  glucose  iAUC  for  any  time 
interval  for  breakfast  or  for  all  meals  combined  versus  Humalog.  LY900014+20  was  statistically 
significantly higher than LY900014 in postprandial glucose iAUC at 2 and 3 hours for all meals combined 
(Figure 44).

better  in  the  LY900014  group  compared  to  the  Humalog  group.  At  Week  26,  LY900014+20  was  less 
effective in managing PPG compared to mealtime LY900014 at all meals throughout the day and was less 
effective compared to Humalog primarily during lunch.(Figure 45).

The  24-hour  glucose  profile  in  each  treatment  group  from  CGM  was  examined.  This  analysis  was 
discussed and approved by CHMP during scientific advice (2016). Statistically significantly lower glucose 
levels were observed for LY900014 compared to Humalog during the daytime hours. Average glucose 
between  02:00  and  05:00  AM  was  statistically  significantly  higher  in  LY900014+20  compared  to 
Humalog. Significance and hourly averages are illustrated in Figure 46.

In ITRM (T1D), no statistically significant treatment differences were seen between the LY900014 and 
Humalog groups in the percentages of patients achieving HbA1c targets (≤6.5% and <7%) at Week 26. 
However, postprandial administration of LY90014 (group LY900014+20) was less effective than Humalog 
and preprandial LY90014 in terms of achieving these target levels. 
In ITRN (T2D), no statistically significant differences were seen in the proportions of patients achieving 
HbA1c targets at any time point.

ITRM (T1D) 
Daily mean BG excursions from pre-meal to 1- and  2-hours post-meal were significantly lower in the 
LY900014 group than in the Humalog group. Significant differences in favour of LY900014 were seen also 
after lunch and after dinner. However, the mean and pre-meal daily mean glucose levels did not differ 
between LY900014 and Humalog.  
Postprandial administration of LY900014 (LY900014+20) produced similar daily mean and pre-meal daily 
mean glucose levels in comparison with Humalog. However, SMBG values were significantly higher at 
1 hour  following  lunch  and  dinner  in  the  LY900014+20  arm  vs.  Humalog  arm,  but  not  statistically 
significantly in any other time point. The higher post-lunch and post-dinner values were also reflected in 
a significantly higher mean 1-hour post-meal glucose and daily mean excursion from evening pre-meal to 
1-hour post-meal and daily mean pre-meal to 1-hour post-meal (Figure 47). 
In  comparison  with  LY900014,  LY900014+20  produced  similar  pre-meal  daily  mean  glucose  levels; 
however, the overall daily mean glucose was statistically significantly higher, in favour or preprandial

administration  of  LY900014.  This  was  caused  by  significantly  higher  daily  mean  BG  excursions  from 
pre-meal to 1- and 2-hour postmeal levels compared to LY900014 (Figure 48). 
ITRN (T2D) 
LY900014 exhibited statistically significantly lower daily mean blood glucose excursions from pre-meal to 
1- and 2-hour post-meal compared to Humalog. LY900014 also statistically significantly decreased SMBG 
at  1  and  2-hour  post  morning  meal  compared  to  Humalog  with  no  statistically  significant  treatment 
differences at any other 10-point SMBG time point. Overall, the glucose fluctuations between LY900014 
and Humalog are more similar in T2D subjects than in T1D subjects (Figure 49).

ITRN,T2D 
Upon  request,  the  Applicant  conducted  simulations  on  what  would  happen  if  the  patient  injected 
LY900014  or  Humalog  and  would not  eat  thereafter,  using the  PK/PD  model parameters.  Simulations 
were conducted by controlling variables affecting glycaemic response (dose of insulin, glucose level, etc.) 
Simulations for patients with T1D and T2D were conducted using the corresponding population PK/PD 
model. Based on PK/PD modelling, the Applicant demonstrated that onset of hypoglycaemia is slightly 
faster for Liumjev compared to Humalog in the T1D but not the T2D population. The proportion of patients 
that is predicted to reach the hypoglycaemia threshold, both in the T1D and the T2D population, is similar 
in Humalog and Liumjev treated groups. 
Insulin dose 
In ITRM (T1D), at week 26, there were no statistically significant differences between treatments in basal, 
prandial, and total daily insulin doses. The prandial to total insulin ratio at week 26 ranged from 51.3% to 
52.1% in the different study arms.  
In ITRN (T2D), at Week 26, the basal insulin dose was not statistically significantly different between 
treatments.  The  LY900014  prandial  and  total  insulin  doses  were  higher  at  Week  26  than  Humalog; 
however once adjusted for weight no statistically significant differences were present. The prandial to 
total insulin ratio at Week 26 was also similar: Humalog: 48.5%, LY900014: 49.7%. 
In all study arms, insulin doses increased during the study, more markedly in T2D patients (Figure 49).

were statistically significantly higher in LY900014 (5.04 mg/dL) versus Humalog (4.64 mg/dL, p=0.003) 
and versus LY900014+20 (4.48 mg/dL, p<0.001).

1,5 AG levels increased (improved) to a similar extent during treatment with Humalog and LY900014 
(LSM change at Week 26: Humalog, 2.15 mg/dL; LY900014, 1.99 mg/dL; p=0.600). As the test 1,5-AG 
is not yet a standard test, the clinical relevance of the change that was seen in study ITRM is not clear. 
Furthermore, there was no difference in 1,5 AG levels in ITRN (T2D), although a difference was seen in 
postprandial control. The Applicant discussed that there were more confounding factors in T2D patients, 
including  concomitant  oral  antihyperglycaemic  agents,  especially  SGLT2  inhibitors,  which  cause 
glucosuria  and  may  according  to  literature  decrease  1,5  AG  levels.  Furthermore,  the  difference  in 
postprandial glycaemic control between Humalog and LY900014 was smaller in T2D than in T1D. Overall, 
the clinical relevance of the 1,5-AG results in the well-controlled study participants of ITRM and ITRN is 
not clear; and this measure is not widely used in clinical practice.

Efficacy results of ITSI 
The study was not powered to show statistical differences between study arms; hence, the results are 
descriptive. 
There was no difference between study arms in insulin dose (basal, bolus, total daily dose). 
All patients entered Study ITSI under good glycaemic control, which was further improved in the first 
6 weeks (Period I) and maintained throughout Period II. In Period I, both treatments showed statistically 
significant reductions from baseline. The LY900014-treated patients had a numerically greater reduction 
in mean HbA1c, even though the baseline was lower (data not shown for brevity). 
In  ITSI,  a  trend  for  better  glycaemic  control  post-breakfast  and  other  indices  of  improved  glycaemic 
control  were  consistently  observed  for  LY900014  compared  to  Humalog  as  shown  in  the  ambulatory 
glucose profile, postmeal iAUCs and time with glucose in target ranges (Figures 3.3.5.13−3.3.5.15). The 
study was not powered to show statistically significant difference in efficacy measures.

Interstitial glucose reduction rate from hyperglycaemia to recovery (≤10mmol/l) was assessed for the 
following threshold of hyperglycaemia throughout each 6 week period: >10.0 mmol/L, > 10.0 mmol/L 
and ≤13.9 mmol/L,>13.9 mmol/L and ≤16.7 mmol/L, and >16.7 mmol/L. The LSM rate of interstitial 
glucose  reduction  to  recovery  was  statistically  significantly  faster  for  LY900014  treatment  (0.03 
mmol/L/min)  compared  to  Humalog  treatment  (0.01  mmol/L/min)  for  Weeks  0  to  6.  For  the  other 
thresholds no significant differences were observed. 
Health outcomes analyses 
The Insulin Treatment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) was collected as secondary endpoint in the 
MDI  studies.  ITSQ  includes  the  domains  inconvenience,  lifestyle,  hypoglycaemic  control,  glycaemic 
control, and delivery system, and an overall transformed score. In ITRN, there was a difference in one of 
the individual domains, the insulin delivery device treatment satisfaction transformed score, that was 
higher in the Humalog group (88.4) than in the LY900014 group (77.6) (LSM change: 1.0 versus -1.5; 
p=0.021) at LOCF endpoint. No statistically significant treatment differences were seen in any other ITSQ

domain transformed score or overall transformed score at baseline or Week 26. This is regarded as a 
chance finding, since similar blinded prefilled pens were used in both study arms. 
The EQ-5D-5, VAS score, and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) were 
tertiary/exploratory  endpoints  in  ITRM  (T1D)  and  ITRN  (T2D).  No  statistically  significant  treatment 
differences were observed either in the EQ-5D-5L health state index scores or the VAS score. 
The  WPAI  includes  the  following  domains:  overall  work  impairment,  absenteeism,  presenteeism,  and 
outside of work activity impairment. The only difference in one of the domains was noted at baseline 
(outside of work activity impairment), however, during the treatment phase and at the end no differences 
evolved between study arms. 
It is obvious that none of the health outcome (HO) measures was designed to capture patients’ wellbeing 
in the postprandial state or symptoms of hyperglycaemia, such as postprandial alertness/sleepiness or 
mood  changes.  Hence,  it  is  not  surprising  that  no  relevant  differences  were  observed  in  these  HO 
measures. 
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the primary endpoint (change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26) 
and  secondary  endpoint  (1h  and  2h  glucose  excursions  during  MMTT)  in  ITRM  and  ITRN. 
Missing-at-random (MAR) analyses were conducted. Primary analysis model was also repeated using the 
per protocol and completer populations. The sensitivity analyses supported non-inferiority of LY900014 
vs. Humalog on overall glycaemic control as measured by HbA1c level and superiority of LY900014 to 
Humalog in controlling 1-hour and 2-hour PPG excursions during mixed meal tolerance test (data not 
included in this AR). 
Subgroup analyses were performed in ITRM and ITRN from baseline to endpoint. The change in HbA1c 
from baseline to the primary endpoint (Week 26) for various subgroups was analysed using an MMRM 
model that includes the same fixed effects given for the primary analysis model plus factors of subgroup, 
2-way  interaction  of  subgroup  and  treatment,  2-way  interaction  of  subgroup  and  visit,  and  3-way 
interaction of treatment, visit, and subgroup. The interaction of subgroup and treatment at the primary 
endpoint (Week 26) was evaluated to assess the treatment by subgroup interaction. 
The analysed subgroups are listed in Table 21. 
One statistically significant (p=0.084) treatment-by-subgroup interaction was observed in the subgroup 
analyses of ITRM (T1D): Subgroup of baseline 2-hour PPG at baseline ≤10/mmol/L and 10/mmol/L. The 
95% CIs for both PPG subgroups led to the same conclusion in noninferiority. 
In the subgroup analyses of ITRN (T2D), there was a statistically significant difference in treatment by 
subgroup interaction at Week 26 based on MMRM for the subgroup of baseline HbA1c (≤8.0% and 8.0%). 
The magnitude of treatment difference at Week 26 was smaller in the baseline HbA1c ≤8.0% category 
than  in  the  baseline  HbA1c  >8.0%  category  although  the  95%  CIs  for both  categories included  zero. 
There was also a significant difference in the treatment by subgroup interaction for the subgroup of body 
mass index (BMI<35 kg/m2 vs.≥35 kg/m2). The treatment difference showed an increase in HbA1c in the 
baseline  BMI  <35  kg/m2  category,  but  showed  a  decrease  in  the  baseline  BMI  ≥35  kg/m2  category. 
Although the directions of LSM difference were different, the 95% CI for both BMI categories led to the 
same conclusion in noninferiority.  
As  a  conclusion  on  subgroup  analyses,  consistent  treatment  effects  across  subgroup  analyses  were 
observed  in  comparison  of  LY900014  with  Humalog  based  on  patient  characteristics,  diabetes 
characteristics and geographic areas, with the three exceptions described by the Applicant. Statistically

significant  differences  in  glycaemic  response  were  seen  in  T1D  subjects  (in  the  subgroup  divided  by 
baseline 2-hour PPG at baseline ≤10 mmol/L vs. >10 mmol/L) and in T2D subjects (in the subgroup of 
baseline HbA1c at ≤ 8.0% and >8.0% and the subgroup of BMI at <35 kg/m2 and ≥35 kg/m2); at the 
significance  level  of  0.1.  The  noted  treatment-by-subgroup  interactions  are  not  considered  clinically 
relevant.

Long-term maintenance results for efficacy (ITRM, 52 weeks)  
With  their  D121  response,  the  Applicant  submitted  the  final  ITRM  CSR  with  results  of  the  long-term 
maintenance period (26-52 weeks) and safety follow-up period (4 week period after week 52) comparing 
in a double-blind manner the safety and efficacy of prandial LY900014 vs. prandial Humalog, and safety 
results for the LY900014+20 group for the 4-week safety follow-up (weeks 26-30) and the remaining 
safety results for ITRN. 
Approximately 92% of patients completed the ITRM study and the treatment. All randomized patients in 
the double-blind treatment groups (LY900014, n=451; Humalog, n=442) were included in the efficacy 
analyses. The demographic and other baseline characteristics were balanced between the groups. 
In  both  double-blind  treatment  groups,  HbA1c  similarly  improved  during  the  lead-in  and  intensive 
titration  period  (Weeks  0  to  12),  remained  stable  during  the  maintenance  period  (Week  12  to  26), 
increased marginally during the long-term maintenance period (Weeks 26 to 52), and was not statistically 
significantly different between treatments at the 52-week endpoint.  
The proportions of patients meeting HbA1c targets were similar in the double-blind treatment groups. At 
week 52 (defined by LOCF using endpoints prior to discontinuation of IP) the proportions of patients with 
HbA1c ≤6.5% in the Humalog and LY900014 groups were 12.0% and 11.6%; HbA1c <7% 26.2% and 
25.6%; HbA1c ≤8.0 74.2% and 78.9%, and ≤9.0% 94.8% and 96.2%, respectively. Evolution of mean 
HbA1c was similar between groups over the course of the study (Figure 53).

LY900014 was overall associated with improved postprandial control compared to Humalog. At Week 52, 
mean daily post-meal glucose excursions were lower for LY900014 than Humalog

• 
from premeal to 1 hour postmeal: LSMean difference -0.79 mmol/L (95% CI -1.11, -0.48, 
p<0.001); and  
from premeal to 2 hours postmeal: LSMean difference -0.46 (95% CI -0.78, -0.15, p=0.004).  
No significant treatment differences between the double-blind treatment groups were seen at week 52 in 
measures of between- or within-day glucose variability, insulin dose (basal, bolus, total, bolus/total ratio) 
or health outcomes assessments. 1,5-AG levels decreased (worsened) in both treatment groups from 
Week 26 to Week 52, however, at Week 52, 1,5-AG levels were still statistically significantly higher 
(better) in the LY900014 group compared to the Humalog group, reflecting better postprandial glucose 
control in the LY900014 group.

Lead-In Period:  
At the beginning of the lead-in period, patients were switched to an allowed study basal 
insulin regimen. Basal insulin was titrated during the lead-in period using a titration 
algorithm to allow the patient to reach the target fasting blood glucose level by the end 
of this period.  All patients were treated with Humalog prior to each meal. 
Insulin glargine 100 units/mL, once or twice daily, or 
Insulin degludec 100 units/mL, once daily 
26 weeks for eligible patients (ongoing) 
Design 
Treatment Period:  
At the end of the lead-in period, patients were randomized (4:4:3) to double-blind 
LY900014 and Humalog, administered 0-2 minutes prior to the start of each meal 
(mealtime) or open-label LY900014+20 (administered 20 minutes after the start of each 
meal).   
During the initial 12 weeks after randomization (intensive titration period), prandial 
insulin doses were titrated as necessary to meet the target SMBG levels.  Basal insulin 
could be titrated as needed to facilitate optimal prandial dosing or for safety reasons such 
as hypoglycaemia or unacceptable hyperglycaemia.   
Thereafter, during the maintenance period (Weeks 12-52 of treatment), it was expected 
that adjustments to prandial and basal insulin doses would be made to maintain 
glycaemic control or for safety reasons such as hypoglycaemia or unacceptable 
hyperglycaemia.

Description 
Primary Efficacy Analysis and Multiplicity-Adjusted Secondary Objectives The 
efficacy estimand included data collected prior to permanent discontinuation of study 
treatment.  The intention-to-treat (ITT) estimand included all data collected regardless 
of on or off study treatment. The efficacy estimand was the primary estimand for the EU 
submission. 
HbA1c: Change from baseline to Week 26; PPG: Week 26 
Graphical Approach: A graphical approach for multiple comparisons (Bretz et al. 2011) 
was used to strongly control the overall Type I error (2-sided alpha level of 0.05) for 
testing the treatment effect for the primary and multiplicity-adjusted secondary 
objectives. 
Analysis 
Description 
Primary Efficacy Analyses:  A mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of 
data from all randomized patients, collected prior to permanent discontinuation of 
investigational product (IP) (efficacy estimand), was used to analyze the primary 
efficacy measure, change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c.  The model included the 
fixed class effects of treatment, strata, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well 
as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline value.  An unstructured covariance 
structure was used to model the within-patient errors.  Sensitivity analyses, including a 
per-protocol analysis and multiple imputation methods were also conducted.   
Multiplicity-Adjusted Secondary Objectives included:   
(H5) noninferiority of LY900014+20 to Humalog for change from baseline in HbA1c  
(H2) superiority of LY900014 to Humalog for 1 hour MMTT PPG excursion

There was a clinically significant improvement in HbA1c in all treatment groups during 
the lead-in period designed to optimize basal insulin therapy.  From screening to the end 
of the lead-in period, mean HbA1c decreased from 8.03% (64.27 mmol/mol) to 7.34% 
(56.74 mmol/mol). 
From Baseline to Week 26 
Mealtime LY900014 compared to Mealtime Humalog: HbA1c decreased from 
baseline in both treatment groups. Noninferiority was confirmed for HbA1c change from 
baseline with LY900014 compared to Humalog. 
LY900014+20 compared to Mealtime Humalog: In the multiplicity-adjusted 
objective H5 (change from baseline in HbA1c), LY900014+20 was non-inferior compared 
to Humalog. There was an increase in HbA1c within the LY900014+20 treatment group; 
HbA1c at 26 weeks was modestly but statistically significantly better in the Humalog 
group. 
LY900014+20 compared to Mealtime LY900014: HbA1c at 26 weeks was modestly

Description 
All patients in this CGM substudy who were randomized to one of the study treatments, 
received at least 1 dose of study treatment, and had CGM data from at least 1 collection 
period (either baseline or endpoint) were included in the analyses of this addendum. 
The primary outcome measurement was the iAUC0-2hours after the start of breakfast at 
Week 26 
For postprandial glucose (PPG)-related variables, a constrained longitudinal data analysis 
was performed with type of basal insulin, HbA1c stratum, prandial insulin dosing plan, and 
treatment as fixed effects, baseline (Visit 8) as a covariate.  An unstructured 
variance-covariance structure was used to model the within-patient errors.    
For other CGM variables, including time in range, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model with strata and treatment as fixed effects and baseline (Visit 8) as a covariate was 
used. 
Primary Objective:  There was a statistically significant treatment difference for 
iAUC0-2hours after breakfast demonstrating that LY900014 administered immediately 
before meals was superior in reducing the iAUC0-2hours (relative reduction ~51%) when 
compared to Humalog, and these reductions persisted in comparisons of the iAUC0-3hours 
(relative reduction ~70%) and

(metformin and/or a sodium glucose cotransporter 2

periods. 
Design 
Treatment Periods:  
Lead-In Period:  
At the beginning of the lead-in period, patients were switched to an allowed study basal 
insulin regimen. Basal insulin was titrated during the lead-in period using a titration 
algorithm to allow the patient to reach the target fasting blood glucose level by the end of 
this period.  All patients were treated with Humalog prior to each meal. 
Treatment Period:  
At the end of the lead-in period, patients were randomized (1:1) to double-blind treatment 
with either LY900014 or Humalog (mealtime; 0-2 minutes prior to the start of each meal).   
During the initial 12 weeks after randomization (intensive titration period), prandial insulin 
doses were titrated as necessary to meet the target SMBG levels.  Basal insulin could be 
titrated as needed to facilitate optimal prandial dosing or for safety reasons such as 
hypoglycaemia or unacceptable hyperglycaemia.   
Thereafter, during the maintenance period (Weeks 12-26 of treatment), it was expected 
that adjustments to prandial and basal insulin doses would be made to maintain glycaemic 
control or for safety reasons such as hypoglycaemia or unacceptable hyperglycaemia. 
The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that LY900014 is noninferior 
to Humalog on glycaemic control (noninferiority margin [NIM]=0.4% for HbA1c) in 
patients with T2D, when administered as prandial insulin (0 to 2 minutes prior to the meal) 
in combination with basal insulin glargine or insulin degludec for 26 weeks.  A NIM of 0.3% 
was also tested.

Primary Efficacy Analysis and Multiplicity-Adjusted Secondary Objectives  
The efficacy estimand included data collected prior to permanent discontinuation of study 
treatment, and intention-to-treat (ITT) estimand included all data collected regardless of 
on or off study treatment. The efficacy estimand was the primary estimand for the EU 
submission. 
HbA1c: Change from baseline to Week 26; PPG: Week 26 
Graphical Approach: A graphical approach for multiple comparisons (Bretz et al. 2011) 
was used to strongly control the overall Type I error (2-sided alpha level of 0.05) for 
testing the treatment effect for the primary and multiplicity adjusted objectives. 
Analysis 
Description 
Primary Efficacy Analyses:  A mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of 
data from all randomized patients, collected prior to permanent discontinuation of 
investigational product (IP) (efficacy estimand), was used to analyze the primary efficacy 
measure, change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c.  The model included the fixed class 
effects of treatment, strata, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the 
continuous, fixed covariates of baseline value.  An unstructured covariance structure was 
used to model the within-patient errors.  Sensitivity analyses, including a per-protocol 
analysis and multiple imputation methods were also conducted. 
Multiplicity-adjusted secondary objectives included: 
• 
• 
• 
(H2) superiority of LY900014 to Humalog for 1 hour MMTT PPG excursion  
(H3) superiority of LY900014 to Humalog for 2-hour MMTT PPG excursion

Analysis 
Description 
HbA1c reflects patients’ blood glucose control over the past 2-3 months and therefore 
there may be potential carryover effect from Period I to Period II.  For this reason, only 
Period I results are discussed for treatment comparisons, to assess the observed trend in 
HbA1c. 
CGM analyses were conducted on the CGM Population that included all randomized 
patients who received at least 1 dose of the randomly assigned IP and had CGM data 
from at least 1 collection period (lead-in, Period I and Period II). 
For the CGM-related endpoints, treatment comparisons were based upon the derived 
outcome variables using the CGM data collected for 4-6 weeks. 
Efficacy and CGM Analysis 
Treatment comparisons for the primary objective were performed using the Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test at the full significance level of 0.05, with patients who were dosed in 
both treatment periods. No multiplicity adjustment was made for secondary and tertiary 
objectives. 
A restricted maximum likelihood based, mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) 
analysis was used to analyze continuous longitudinal CGM variables.  The model included 
the fixed class effects of treatment, period, sequence, strata, and the continuous, fixed 
covariate of baseline value.

Summary of Efficacy for the Pivotal Trial (I8B-MC-ITSI) 
HbA1c 
All patients entered the study under good glycaemic control, which was further improved in 
Period I (first 6 weeks of study treatment) and was maintained throughout Period II. 
In Period I, both treatments showed statistically significant reductions from baseline.  The 
LY900014 treatment had a numerically greater reduction in mean HbA1c, even though 
LY900014 started with a lower baseline (Baseline, % [mmol/mol]: LY900014: 6.97 
[52.68]; Humalog: 7.17 [54.89]).  
Period I Mean Change from baseline, % [mmol/mol]: 
LY900014: -0.39 [-4.23], 95% CI: (-0.55, -0.22 [-6.03,-2.43]) 
Humalog: -0.25% [-2.78], 95% CI: (-0.42, -0.09 [-4.55,-1.00]) 
CGM: Incremental Post breakfast AUC (iAUC) CGM Population, Weeks 4-6 
There was a trend toward better glycaemic control post-breakfast (lower iAUC0-1hour and

CGM:  Time with Glucose in Hyperglycaemic Ranges 
There were no statistically significant treatment differences in the mean duration of time 
in any of the hyperglycaemic ranges for daytime, nighttime, and 24-hour period for 
Weeks 4 to 6, but there were trends towards less time with glucose in hyperglycaemic 
ranges for LY900014-treated patients during daytime and 24-hour period, but not during 
nighttime. 
Pump Factors 
The changes from baseline to Week 6 for pump factors of breakfast carbohydrate ratio, 
active insulin time, breakfast insulin sensitivity factor, and frequency of use of 
non-normal bolus type were small, and similar between treatments; actual values at 
Week 6 were also similar between treatments. 
Insulin Dose 
There were no statistically significant treatment differences for basal, bolus, or total 
insulin dose, at Week 6.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the primary endpoint (change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26) 
and  secondary  endpoint  (1h  and  2h  glucose  excursions  during  MMTT)  in  ITRM  and  ITRN. 
Missing-at-random (MAR) analyses were conducted. Primary analysis model was also repeated using the 
per protocol and completer populations. The sensitivity analyses supported non-inferiority of LY900014 
vs. Humalog on overall glycaemic control as measured by HbA1c level and superiority of LY900014 to 
Humalog in controlling 1-hour and 2-hour PPG excursions during mixed meal tolerance test (data not 
included in this AR). 
Subgroup analyses were performed in ITRM and ITRN from baseline to endpoint. The change in HbA1c 
from baseline to the primary endpoint (Week 26) for various subgroups was analysed using an MMRM 
model that includes the same fixed effects given for the primary analysis model plus factors of subgroup, 
2-way  interaction  of  subgroup  and  treatment,  2-way  interaction  of  subgroup  and  visit,  and  3-way 
interaction of treatment, visit, and subgroup. The interaction of subgroup and treatment at the primary 
endpoint (Week 26) was evaluated to assess the treatment by subgroup interaction. 
The analysed subgroups are listed in Table 26. 
One statistically significant (p=0.084) treatment-by-subgroup interaction was observed in the subgroup 
analyses of ITRM (T1D): Subgroup of baseline 2-hour PPG at baseline ≤10/mmol/L and 10/mmol/L. The 
95% CIs for both PPG subgroups led to the same conclusion in non-inferiority. 
In the subgroup analyses of ITRN (T2D), there was a statistically significant difference in treatment by 
subgroup interaction at Week 26 based on MMRM for the subgroup of baseline HbA1c (≤8.0% and 8.0%). 
The magnitude of treatment difference at Week 26 was smaller in the baseline HbA1c ≤8.0% category 
than  in  the  baseline  HbA1c  >8.0%  category  although  the  95%  CIs  for both  categories included  zero. 
There was also a significant difference in the treatment by subgroup interaction for the subgroup of body 
mass index (BMI<35 kg/m2 vs.≥35 kg/m2). The treatment difference showed an increase in HbA1c in the 
baseline  BMI  <35  kg/m2  category  but  showed  a  decrease  in  the  baseline  BMI  ≥35  kg/m2  category.

Although the directions of LSM difference were different, the 95% CI for both BMI categories led to the 
same conclusion in non-inferiority.  
As  a  conclusion  on  subgroup  analyses,  consistent  treatment  effects  across  subgroup  analyses  were 
observed  in  comparison  of  LY900014  with  Humalog  based  on  patient  characteristics,  diabetes 
characteristics and geographic areas, with the three exceptions described by the Applicant. Statistically 
significant  differences  in  glycaemic  response  were  seen  in  T1D  subjects  (in  the  subgroup  divided  by 
baseline 2-hour PPG at baseline ≤10 mmol/L vs. >10 mmol/L) and in T2D subjects (in the subgroup of 
baseline HbA1c at ≤ 8.0% and >8.0% and the subgroup of BMI at <35 kg/m2 and ≥35 kg/m2); at the 
significance  level  of  0.1.  The  noted  treatment-by-subgroup  interactions  are  not  considered  clinically 
relevant.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Efficacy results were not pooled. Pooling of T1D and T2D studies for efficacy analyses would not have 
been appropriate due to quite distinct nature of T1D and T2D. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The Applicant has not conducted PK studies on LY900014 in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment. 
This approach was accepted in the EMA scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/400498/2016). It was agreed 
with  the  Applicant  that  no  systemic  effect  by  treprostinil  was  expected  due  to  very  low  systemic 
concentrations, and lispro insulin per se is a well-known substance. 
A  paediatric  patient  PK/PD  (I8B-MC-ITSA)  comparing  Humalog  versus  LY900014  in  children  and 
adolescents (6 to <18 years) with T1D is ongoing. A Phase 3 trial (I8BMC-ITSB) is planned for 2019. The 
Applicant states that an indication for children will be submitted once both trials are completed.

The Applicant submitted upon request tabulated data for confirmation of consistency of the treatment 
effect and safety profile included in clinical studies during development of LY90014. The summary tables 
by age group (<65, ≥65 to <75, ≥75 to <85 and ≥85) were provided separately for studies ITRM and 
ITRN (tables not included here for brevity). As there were only 3/49 randomised patients aged above 65 
years in ITSI, these patients were not included in the analyses. No patients above the age of 85 were 
included in the Phase 3 studies, and the number of patients aged above 75 years was very low. 
Of all randomised patients, there were 407 subjects aged <65, 30 subjects aged ≥65 to <75, 5 subjects 
aged ≥75 to<85 years and none ≥85 years of age.  
In Study ITRM, there were fewer patients ≥65 years of age (n=98 [8%]) than patients <65 years of age 
(n=1124 [92%]). HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment was similar between age groups above and below 
65 years of age (Humalog: 7.3%; LY900014: 7.2%); but numerically higher in patients ≥75 years of age 
(Humalog:  7.7%;  LY900014:  7.5%).  The  1-  and  2-  hour  PPG  response  was  similar  between  the  age 
groups of LY900014 treated patients, but larger PPG excursions were noted among patients >65 to 75 
years of age treated with Humalog. All documented hypoglycaemia <3.0 mmol/L was similar between age 
groups above and below 65 years of age for Humalog treated patients (~13.3 events per patient/year 
[EPY]); however, the rate in LY900014 treated patients was numerically higher in patients ≤65 years of 
age (13.1 EPY) than in LY900014 treated patients >65 to 75 years of age (5.5 EPY) or ≥75 years of age 
(3.6 EPY). Due to the imbalance in sample size between patients above and below 65 years of age, these 
observations should be interpreted with some caution since higher HbA1c and reduced hypoglycaemia 
risk  observed  in  older  patients  may  also  be  influenced  by  a  more  conservative  approach  to  diabetes 
management.    
In Study ITRN, there were 194 subjects <65, 133 subjects ≥65 to <75, and 10 subjects ≥75 to <85 years 
of  age.    Over  26  weeks  of  treatment,  mean  HbA1c  was  reflected  good  average  glycaemic  control  in 
subjects aged <65, ≥65 to <75, and ≥75 years with LY900014 (6.9%, 6.8% and 6.6%, respectively) and 
Humalog (7.0%, 6.8%, and 7.1%, respectively). The PPG excursions at 1 hour after meal were in the age 
groups <65, ≥65 to <75, and ≥75 years 3.9, 3.7, and 2.6 mmol/L in the Humalog and 4.0, 4.0, and 4.0 
mmol/L  in  the  LY900014  group,  respectively.  At  2  hours,  the  PPG  excursions  were  5.2,  5.2  and  4.1 
mmol/L in the Humalog group, and 3.3, 3.1, and 3.4 mmol/L in the LY900014 group in age groups <65, 
≥65 to <75, and  ≥75 years, respectively. Hence, the numerical improvement in PPG excursions with 
LY900014 vs. Humalog was seen only at 2 hours post-meal in T2D patients; without any effect on overall 
glycaemic control. However, the variation in the PPG results was large in older age groups. 
Documented  hypoglycaemia  <3.0  mmol/L  rates  were  overall  were  similar  between  treatments  and 
tended to be lower or similar in older patients compared with patients < 65 year of age.  
Supportive study(ies) 
The LY900014 KwikPen internal mechanisms and industrial design are based on existing KwikPen 
platforms and thus, the human factors development programme focused on the design for differentiation 
(KwikPen and carton design). During development of the LY900014 pre-filled KwikPens, the Applicant 
conducted two formative human evaluation studies and subsequent human factor (HF) validation study. 
The two formative human evaluation studies (HF study 3/2017, HF study 6/2017) included a total of 
48 participants and based on the study results, a single LY900014 label strategy was chosen. All in all, the 
studies did not reveal potential differentiation problems among representative users. No changes to the 
colour pattern of the pen or carton were needed based on the formative studies. 
The purpose of the human factor validation study was to demonstrate that the intended users can 
differentiate the LY900014 KwikPens when presented in a group of products similar in appearance and

function. The human factor validation study was conducted in simulating conditions of actual use and 
consisted of 66 participants (17 paediatric, 8 adult patients, 7 adult caregivers, 15 nurses, 15 pharmacists, 
and 4 colour-blind consumers without diabetes). The products (pens or cartons) used as distractors in the 
differentiation scenarios included five currently authorized meal-time insulins and five basal insulins. 
Based on the results, in 192 out of 198 scenarios, participants successfully completed all 3 differentiation 
scenarios with no use errors or problems. There was a total of 6 instances (from 5 participants, all aged 
from 10 to 13 years) in which participants did not successfully complete a scenario. The five paediatric 
participants experienced difficulties to distinguish the pens, especially to differentiate the three LY900014 
KwikPen variants. In general, the LY900014 100 units/mL KwikPen and LY900014 200 units/mL KwikPen 
have quite similar appearance (same pen body colour and shape, blue-white label etc.). As highlighted in 
the guideline “Risk minimisation strategy for high-strength and fixed-combination insulin products” the 
potential mix-up between the insulin pens is an important aspect that should be thoroughly assessed 
during the product development. In the end, also children should be able to distinguish between the pens 
since paediatric development is ongoing for LY900014. However, it is not expected that a child would have 
access to different kinds of bolus insulin. The important issue is to distinguish between bolus and basal 
insulin and in this regard, no errors occurred even among children. None of the adults made any errors, 
including nurses and pharmacists that might handle insulin pens of different patients. It is acknowledged 
that as the pens yield units (instead of volumes), mixing pens with the two different strengths would not 
affect the actually given insulin dose. Therefore, the similarity of the colour scheme of the LY900014 
KwikPens with 100 and 200 U/mL is not expected to cause unacceptable hazard. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
LY900014  has  been  developed  as  a  faster-acting  prandial  insulin  for  subcutaneous  (SC)  use  and  for 
intravenous (IV) use to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) or type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Currently the application is intended for use in adults; however, paediatric 
development is ongoing. The aim has been to provide a faster glucose-lowering effect, which mimics more 
closely the physiological mealtime  insulin  response  than the  currently  available  insulin  lispro  with the 
global trade names Humalog and Liprolog (duplicate licence), without compromising the safety. On the 
EU market there is also Insulin lispro Sanofi, a biosimilar lispro insulin. Humalog was approved in the EU 
in 1996. 
Faster insulin time-action profile and earlier glucose lowering effect has been attained by two excipients 
with independent mechanisms to accelerate the absorption of insulin lispro from the site of injection or 
infusion: treprostinil and sodium citrate. A microdose of treprostinil enhances absorption of insulin lispro 
through increased local vasodilatation, however with negligible systemic exposure. Sodium citrate speeds 
absorption of insulin by enhancing local vascular permeability. 
One purpose with LY900014 has been to develop a prandial insulin that would allow for post-meal dosing 
in situations when dosing immediately before the meal is not suitable or possible, in addition to dosing 
prior to meal ingestion. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Scientific advice has been obtained for the overall development plan (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/400498/2016) 
and the Applicant has followed the advice. As the active substance insulin lispro has been on market since 
1996, omission of Phase 2 studies can be accepted. The PK/PD studies have confirmed that the overall 
hypoglycaemic effect of LY900014 is similar to Humalog regardless of the faster onset of glucose-lowering 
action of LY900014. The CHMP also agreed on omission of separate studies on patients with hepatic or 
renal  insufficiency  and  interaction  studies.  Patients  with  moderate  to  severe  renal  insufficiency  or 
Assessment report

significant hepatic impairment were excluded from the Phase 3 studies, and very few subjects with any 
renal or hepatic impairment were enrolled. No relevant difference in treatment response was observed 
between subjects below and above 65 years of age; however, few subjects were above age 75 years and 
none above 85 years in the Phase 3 studies. 
The  efficacy  evaluation  of  LY900014  is  based  on  three  Phase  3  studies  comparing  LY900014  with 
Humalog. Studies ITRM (T1D) and ITRN (T2D) were randomized, parallel-design, double-blind, active 
controlled, treat-to-target trials that evaluated the safety and efficacy of LY900014 when administered as 
a prandial insulin as part of a MDI regimen in adult patients with T1D and T2D, respectively. Study ITSI 
was a 2-treatment, 2-period (6-week treatment each) crossover design trial that evaluated the safety and 
compatibility of LY900014 in the treatment of patients with T1D when administered via CSII compared 
with Humalog. 
The  choice  of  Humalog  as  comparator  was  supported  by  the  CHMP  during  SA  and  is  considered 
appropriate.  As  LY90014  is  a  new  faster-acting  formulation  of  lispro  insulin  by  the  MAH  of  Humalog, 
demonstrating significant differences in safety and efficacy of LY900014 compared with Humalog is the 
best approach to assess any benefit of LY900014 in addition to the insulin products already on market. 
A  total  of  421  healthy  subjects  and  342  patients  with  T1D  or  T2D  were  exposed  to  LY900014  in  the 
22 completed clinical pharmacology trials. Altogether 1944 patients with T1D or T2D received study drug 
(LY900014 or the active comparator Humalog) in the Phase 3 studies, of which 1165 received LY900014. 
The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  of  the  Phase  3  studies  are  considered  acceptable.  Patients  were 
excluded if there were safety issues (with labile diabetes control such as frequent hypoglycaemic events 
or  ketoacidosis  requiring  emergency  treatment,  and  of  patients  with  hypoglycaemia  unawareness)  or 
inappropriate  combination  of  medications  in  T2D  patients  (GLP1  receptor  agonists,  pramlintide  or 
thiazolidinediones).  The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  allowed  for  participation  of  typical  diabetes 
patients representative of the target patient population. 
Both ITRM (T1D) and ITRN (T2D) trials included an 8-week lead-in period; a 12-week intensive titration 
period; and a 26-week controlled period assessing non-inferiority based on change in HbA1c of LY900014 
compared  with  Humalog  (primary  objective).  ITRM  was  conducted  with  three  arms:  LY900014  and 
Humalog administered immediately (0-2 minutes) prior to each meal in a double-blind manner, and as 
third treatment group LY900014 was administered 20 minutes after the start of a meal (LY900014+20) 
open-label,  as  it  was  not  possible  to  blind  this  treatment  group  with  different  injection  timing.  The 
non-inferiority  margin  (NIM)  was  0.4  according  to  FDA’s  requirements,  however,  for  the  EU,  also 
non-inferiority  with  the  NIM  0.3  has  been  calculated  as  part  of  primary  endpoint.  ITRM  included  a 
long-term  maintenance  period  of  26  weeks  (up  to  52  weeks  from  initiation  of  treatment  period),  in 
addition  to  the  lead-in  period  (8  weeks)  and  controlled  treatment  period  (26  weeks).  Results  were 
originally submitted for up to the end of the controlled treatment period up to 26 weeks. The 52-week 
efficacy data submitted with the D121 responses confirmed the 26-week findings. No difference was seen 
in overall glycaemic control reflected by HbA1c between Humalog and LY900014. However, lower glucose 
excursions  from  premeal  to  1  hour  and  2  hour  post-meal  time  points  at  Week  52  for  LY900014  than 
Humalog, and larger decrease from baseline to Week 52 in glucose excursions from premeal to 1-hour 
and 2-hour time points post-meal was observed for the LY900014 group compared with the Humalog 
group. 
ITRM (T1D) also contained a continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring (CGM) blinded substudy with 
269 patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and wore the CGM device during at least 
1 collection period (either baseline or post baseline) (LY900014, 97; Humalog, 99; LY900014+20, 73) 
that has been finalised.

ITRN (T2D) compared LY900014 and Humalog, both administered immediately prior to meal. The ITRN 
study on T2D patients contained no long-term maintenance period. 
The primary endpoint of studies ITRM(T1D) and ITRN(T2D) was non-inferiority of LY900014 vs. Humalog 
in achieving glycaemic control as measured by HbA1c. This endpoint was assessed at 26 weeks, which 
included  12-week  intensive  titration  period  followed  by  a  maintenance  period.  At  the  initiation  of  the 
8-week  lead-in  period  in  these  studies  (visit  2),  patients  treated  with  insulin  aspart,  insulin  glulisine, 
regular insulin, or premixed insulin were transferred to Humalog. At Visit 2, patients treated with a basal 
insulin  regimen  other  than  insulin  glargine  100  units/mL  or  insulin  degludec  were  transferred  to  an 
allowed study basal regimen of insulin glargine 100 units/mL once or twice daily or insulin degludec 100 
units/mL or 200 units/mL once daily. At Visit 8, initiation of the controlled treatment period, patients were 
randomized  to  either  mealtime  (0-2  minutes  before  the  start  of  the  meal)  Humalog  or  mealtime 
LY900014 and continued their basal insulin regimen. 
Notably the studies were treat-to-target studies with intensive titration algorithms for achieving good 
glycaemic control. Consequently, there was a marked improvement in glycaemic control in both studies 
already during the lead-in period (the so-called “trial effect”). In this kind of setting superiority is difficult 
to show as insulin can always be individually titrated to achieve desired glucose levels. Furthermore, if the 
insulin regimen causes e.g. hypoglycaemic events between meals, this can be controlled by optimised 
snacking. Hence, non-inferiority is an appropriate goal for the primary endpoint, which was glycaemic 
control. The choice of the primary endpoint is in accordance with the Guideline on clinical investigation of 
medicinal  products 
in  the  treatment  or  prevention  of  diabetes  mellitus  (14  May  2012. 
CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 1). 
However, as the difference between LY900014 and Humalog is in postprandial control, the clinically most 
important efficacy endpoints are the multiple measures of postprandial control collected as secondary or 
tertiary endpoints. The methods for collection of postprandial and diurnal glucose fluctuations included 
4-hour  standardized  mixed-meal  tolerance  tests  (MMTT)  at  baseline  and  at  26  weeks  of  treatment, 
self-monitoring  of  blood  glucose  (SMBG),  samples  for  fasting  glucose,  and  additionally  in  the  ITRM 
substudy  and  ITSI,  continuous  glucose  monitoring  (CGM)  and  flash  glucose  monitoring  (FGM). 
1,5-anhydroglucitol  (1,5-AG)  was  determined  as  a  measure  of  postprandial  glycaemia  that  has  been 
implicated to be associated with diabetic complications. 
The primary endpoint of the ITRM CGM Substudy was to compare double-blind LY900014 and Humalog 
with respect to the iAUC0-2hrs after breakfast obtained from up to 14 days of CGM use at Week 26. Multiple 
other measures of glucose variability were assessed as secondary and tertiary endpoints. 
The ITSI study on patients with T1D using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via external 
insulin pump was primarily designed to confirm safety and compatibility of LY900014 for use in an insulin 
pump. The study was not powered to demonstrate non-inferiority or superiority for efficacy. However, 
multiple endpoints were collected also for assessment of efficacy. 
The phase 3 clinical trials were overall conducted in an acceptable way. In studies ITRM (T1D) and ITRN 
(T2D),  the  PPG  excursions  were  measured  from  randomisation  to  primary  endpoint  at  26  weeks  only 
twice: at baseline and week 26. Based on the description, only subjects with data on both time points are 
included in the analysis, thus both estimates estimate rather efficacy estimand than ITT estimand. As the 
primary  aim  of  the  analysis  of  PPG  excursion  was  to  demonstrate  superiority,  the  ITT  estimand  is  of 
primary  interest.  Further  to  CHMP  request,  the  Applicant  conducted  a  new  analysis  using  multiple 
imputation with baseline as a reference to provide a more conservative estimate of the treatment effect 
at week 26 for both PPG excursion endpoints, and results of this analysis were comparable with original 
results.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In  all  phase  3  studies,  the  study  populations  were  representative  for  the  target  population  and  well 
balanced between study groups with regards to demographic and disease characteristics. The proportion 
of EU-patients vs. non-EU-patients in the Phase 3 studies were adequate: in the ITRM (T1D), 667/1316 
(50.7%); in the ITRN (T2D), 234/750 (31.2%) and in ITSI (T1D, CSII) 31/49 (63.3%). 
Of patients who were entered in the lead-in period, 94/1316 discontinued the study before randomisation 
in  the  ITRM  (T1D)  and  213/963  in  the  ITRN  (T2D);  most  commonly  due  to  withdrawal  by  subject, 
physician  decision  or  lost-to-follow-up.  After  randomisation,  drop-out  rates  were  overall  small  and 
balanced between study arms. In ITRM, 18/442 subjects in the Humalog arm, 8/451 in the LY900014 arm 
and 11/329 in the LY900014+20 arm of the study discontinued before entering in the safety follow-up 
period or long-term maintenance period. In the ITRN (T2D), 18/337 in the Humalog and 16/336 in the 
LY900014 arm discontinued after randomisation. In the ITSI (T1D, CSII), 3/49 discontinued: one due to 
protocol violation, 2 due to withdrawal by patient. 
At the beginning of the 8-week lead-in periods of ITRM (T1D) and ITRN (T2D) all patients were changed 
to  use  Humalog  as  prandial  insulin  and  either  insulin  glargine  or  insulin  degludec  as  basal  insulin.  A 
marked improvement in overall glycaemic control achieved by optimisation of the multiple-dose regimen 
was  seen  in  both  studies  during  the  lead  in-period:  In  ITRM  (T1D),  the  mean  HbA1c  decreased  from 
8.03%  to  7.34%  and  in  ITRN  (T2D)  from  8.3%  to  7.3%.  Consequently,  most  patients  started  the 
randomised treatment period already in good glycaemic control. 
Results on HbA1c 
The  primary  endpoint  in  both  multiple  daily  injection  studies,  ITRM  in  T1D  subjects  and  ITRN  in  T2D 
subjects, was to test the hypothesis that LY900014 was noninferior to Humalog on glycaemic control, 
when administered as prandial insulin (0 to 2 minutes prior to the meal), in combination with basal insulin 
glargine  or  insulin  degludec.  Glycaemic  control  was  measured  by  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to 
26 weeks using a noninferiority margin (NIM) of 0.4%. Additionally, a NIM of 0.3 as calculated to fulfil the 
EU requirements.  Both LY900014 and Humalog were injected at the start of a meal (mealtime; 0 to 
2 minutes prior to the start of the meal). Efficacy results were calculated as efficacy estimand including 
data  collected  prior  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  IP  and  for  the  ITT  estimand  including  all  data 
collected, regardless of IP use. Post-meal dosing was included in Study ITRM (T1D) as an open-label arm 
(LY900014+20) to support a post-meal dosing indication. 
Secondary multiplicity adjusted objectives included the following objective regarding HbA1c: testing the 
hypothesis  that  LY900014  is  at  26  weeks  superior  to  Humalog  in  improving  glycaemic  control,  when 
administered  as  prandial  insulin,  and  noninferior  to  Humalog  in  improving  glycaemic  control,  when 
administered 20 minutes after the start of a meal. 
The  primary  endpoint  was  met  in  both  ITRM  (T1D)  and  ITRN  (T2D):  LY900014  was  noninferior  to 
Humalog on glycaemic control, when administered as prandial insulin, for both the NIM of 0.4% and NIM 
of 0.3%. For the assessment of non-inferiority, results on analyses according to ITT estimand (including 
all  data  collected  through  Week  26,  regardless  of  IP  use)  and  the  efficacy  estimand  (including  data 
collected prior to discontinuation of IP through Week 26) are considered important. In ITRM (T1D), from 
a  similar  baseline  HbA1c  level,  the  change  in  HbA1c  at  week  26  was  −0.05  and  −0.13  %-units  for 
Humalog  and  LY900014,  respectively  (efficacy  estimand);  corresponding  figures  for  the  ITT  estimand 
were −0.09and −0.18 %-units for Humalog and LY900014, respectively. In ITRN (T2D), the LSM change 
in HbA1c was −0.43% in the Humalog group and −0.38% in the LY900014 group; LY900014 vs. Humalog 
LSM Difference (95% CI) was 0.06 (-0.05, 0.16) (efficacy estimand). The corresponding figures for the 
ITT estimand of the LSM change in HbA1c in ITRN (T2D) were −0.46% in the Humalog group, −0.43% in 
the LY900014 group; p=0.624. There were no statistically significant treatment differences at any time

point during the lead-in and treatment periods. The sensitivity analyses (tipping point and per protocol 
analyses)  for  the  efficacy  and  ITT  estimands  supported  the  findings  of  the  primary  analyses  in  both 
studies. 
Multiplicity-adjusted secondary endpoints on HbA1c included superiority of LY900014 to Humalog (ITRM, 
T1D,  ITRN,  T2D)  and  noninferiority  of  LY900014+20  to  Humalog  (ITRM,  T1D).  Non-inferiority  of 
LY900014+20 to Humalog in terms of change in HbA1c was met in ITRM (T1D) with LSM difference in 
HbA1c of 0.14% with a two-sided 95% CI of 0.053% to 0.226 (ITT estimand). The secondary endpoint of 
superiority  of  prandial  LY900014  vs.  prandial  Humalog  for  improving  glycaemic  control  (change  from 
baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c) was met for the efficacy estimand but not for the ITT estimand in the ITRM 
study.  In  ITRN  (T2D),  neither  the  efficacy  nor  the  ITT  estimand  showed  superiority  of  LY900014  vs. 
Humalog.  It  is  of  importance  for  interpretation  of  these  results  that  both  ITRM  and  ITRN  were 
treat-to-target  studies  with  intensive  titration  algorithms  for  achieving  good  glycaemic  control. 
Consequently,  a  marked  improvement  in  HbA1c  occurred  in  both  studies  already  during  the  lead-in 
period, and the controlled treatment periods of the study started already in good glycaemic control. In 
this kind of setting superiority is difficult to show as the insulin doses are individually and meticulously 
titrated  to  achieve  desired  glucose  levels.  Furthermore,  if  the  insulin  regimen  causes  hypoglycaemic 
events between meals, this can be controlled by optimised snacking. Hence, non-inferiority on glycaemic 
control was an appropriate goal for the primary endpoint. The choice of the primary endpoint is also in 
accordance  with  the  “Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  in  the  treatment  or 
prevention  of  diabetes  mellitus”  (14  May  2012.  CPMP/EWP/1080/00  Rev.  1).  Postprandial  glycaemia 
accounts for only about 50% of overall diurnal glycaemia while the rest is from fasting glycaemia. Hence, 
the lowering of PPG excursions by even a clinically relevant amount as was seen in ITRM and ITRN is only 
a fraction of postprandial excursion and even a smaller fraction of overall glycaemia. 
The proportions of T1D patients achieving the HbA1c targets ≤6.5 % and <7 % in the LY900014 and 
Humalog  groups  at  Week  26  were  similar  in  ITRM,  at  ~16%  and  ~35%,  respectively.  In  the 
LY900014+20  group,  the  proportions  achieving  these  HbA1c  targets  were  lower:  ~10%  and  ~26%, 
respectively. In ITRN in T2D, the proportions of patients achieving the HbA1c targets ≤6.5% and <7.0% 
at Week 26 were similar for LY900014 and Humalog, at approximately 37% and approximately 55%, 
respectively.  These  results  support  injecting  LY900014  prior  to  meal  instead  of  post-meal,  whenever 
possible. Nevertheless, the results on noninferiority of LY900014+20 to Humalog (Humalog thus given 
prior  to  meal)  in  terms  of  change  in  HbA1c  in  ITRM  support  including  the  possibility  of  postprandial 
administration in the indication, similar to the indication of Humalog. The Phase 3 program includes no 
comparison of post-meal LY900014 and post-meal Humalog, which might have favoured LY900014 more 
in  comparison  with  Humalog.  On  the  other  hand,  there  was  no  comparison  in  the  Phase  3  studies  of 
LY900014  with  Humalog  that  would  have  been  injected  15  minutes  prior  to  meal,  which  is 
recommendable if feasible. Such a comparison might have attenuated the benefit achieved by LY900014. 
Results on glucose variability 
The major difference between LY900014 and Humalog is seen in postprandial control, hence, the clinically 
most  important  efficacy  endpoints  are  the  multiple  measures  of  postprandial  control  collected  as 
secondary  or  tertiary  endpoints.  The  methods  for  collection  of  postprandial  and  diurnal  glucose 
fluctuations  included  4-hour  standardized  mixed-meal  tolerance  tests  (MMTT)  at  baseline  and  at  26 
weeks  of  treatment,  self-monitoring  of  blood  glucose  (SMBG),  samples  for  fasting  glucose,  and 
additionally in the ITRM (T1D) substudy and ITSI, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and flash glucose 
monitoring (FGM). 1,5-anhydroglucitol (AIG) was determined as a measure of postprandial glycaemia 
that has been implicated to be associated with diabetic complications.

The  primary  endpoint  of  the  ITRM  (T1D)  CGM  Substudy  was  to  compare  double-blind  LY900014  and 
Humalog with respect to the iAUC0-2hrs after breakfast obtained from up to 14 days of CGM use at Week 
26. Multiple other measures of glucose variability were assessed as secondary and tertiary endpoints. The 
ITSI study on patients with T1D using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via external insulin 
pump was primarily designed to confirm safety and compatibility of LY900014 for use in an insulin pump. 
The study was not powered to demonstrate non-inferiority or superiority for efficacy. However, multiple 
endpoints were collected also for assessment of efficacy.  
Of note, ITT results on glycaemic control are especially important for estimating the effect of the product 
on overall glycaemic control as a risk factor for long-term complications of diabetes. For the efficacy table 
and  especially  for  the  product  information,  results  based  on  efficacy  estimand  are  more  relevant,  as 
treating physicians and patients need to know the effects of LY900014 after injection during therapy. ITT 
results that are diluted by patients who discontinued treatment are not relevant in the clinical setting 
when insulin is used for replacement of endogenous insulin secretion. 
The multiplicity adjusted efficacy endpoints of superiority of LY900014 to Humalog in controlling 1-hour 
and 2-hour PPG excursions were met, when administered as prandial insulin in the MMTT at Week 26. In 
ITRM (T1D), the observed differences in mean PPG excursions, (ITT estimand) were 1.53 mmol/L (95% 
CI [−1.94, −1.13], p<0.001) less at 1 hour and 1.69 mmol/L (95% CI [−2.24, −1.14], p<0.001) less at 
2 hours after meal in the LY900014 arm in comparison with the Humalog arm of the study. The respective 
mean  differences  in  PPG  excursions  based  on  efficacy  estimand  were  1.55  mmol/L  (95%  CI  [−1.96, 
−1.14], p<0.001) less at 1 hour and 1.73 mmol/L (95% CI [−2.28, −1.18], p<0.001) less at 2 hours 
after meal. For T2D subjects in the ITRN (T2D), the respective LSM differences for 1 hour and 2-hour PPG 
excursions were −0.67 (95% CI [−1.01, −0.32, p<0.001) mmol/L and −0.98 mmol/L (95% CI [−1.41, 
−0.54],  p<0.001)  (ITT  estimand)  and  −0.66  (95%  CI  [−1.01,  −0.30],  p<0.001)  mmol/L  and  −0.96 
mmol/L (95% CI [−1.41, −0.52], p<0.001) (efficacy estimand). The observed differences in the 1-hour 
and  2-hour  PPG  excursions  were  in  both  studies  highly  statistically  significant  (p<0.001  for  all 
comparisons). As T1D patients have total insulin deficiency and are more insulin-sensitive and leaner than 
T2D patients are, it is not surprising that the improvement in PPG was larger in ITRM (T1D) than in ITRN 
(T2D).  In  T2D,  remaining  endogenous  insulin  secretion  reacts  to  circulating  glucose  levels,  which 
attenuates  glycaemic  fluctuations.  Furthermore,  thicker  subcutaneous  tissue  is  expected  to  delay 
absorption  of  LY900014,  whereas  insulin  resistance  impairs  glucose  uptake  in  muscles  and  enhances 
hepatic glucose production. Therefore, the achieved hypoglycaemic effect by the ultra-rapid LY900014 in 
comparison with Humalog is larger in T1D than T2D. Nevertheless, in T2D patients, the lowering of PPG 
was  almost  1  mmol/L  at  2  hours  post-meal,  which  could  be  considered  clinically  relevant,  too.  The 
reduction of 1.69 mmol/L in the 2-hour PPG in T1D is deemed clinically highly relevant. In conclusion, a 
significant difference in efficacy between LY900014 and Humalog has been demonstrated, in the context 
of falling outside of the scope of Article 82 (1) of Regulation EC No 726/2004 (duplicate MA); this has been 
a prerequisite for a separate stand-alone MA for LY900014, as it has the same active substance (insulin 
lispro) as within Humalog. Health outcome analyses showed no difference between treatment arms and 
clinical outcome endpoints were not investigated. The applicant was requested to discuss which patients 
with T1D and T2D are expected to benefit from LY900014 given its faster onset of action compared with 
currently marketed insulin lispro products. The applicant provided more data on the effects of LY900014 
on  postprandial  glycaemic  control  in  comparison  with  other  mealtime  insulins  and  concluded  that 
LY900014 has a favourable benefit/risk profile in patients with T1D and T2D. In clinical practice, however, 
it is expected that LY900014 would preferentially be used for patients who cannot reach their individual 
glycaemic goals due to inadequately controlled glucose excursions after meals. 
Post-meal  dosing  was  not  tested  in  Study  ITRN  (T2D)  but  was  tested  in  T2D  patients  in  two  clinical 
pharmacology  studies  (Studies  ITRH  and  ITRW).  In  ITRH,  each  T2D  patient  was  randomized  to  1  of 
6 treatment  sequences  comprising  single  SC  doses  of  LY900014  and  lispro  insulin  (a  reference

formulation  prepared  by  diluting  commercially  available  Humalog  with  sterile  diluent  for  Humalog  to 
adjust the concentration of insulin lispro to 95 IU/mL, thereby matching the concentration of insulin lispro 
in LY900014)  administered at different times (−15 minutes, 0 minutes [immediately before meal], and 
+15 minutes) relative to the start of a test meal. LY900014 reduced the PPG excursion during the MMTT 
compared with the reference formulation of lispro insulin for each of the meal-to-dose timing intervals. In 
ITRW,  LY900014  showed  a  trend  towards  an  earlier  glucose-lowering  effect  and  a  lower  postprandial 
glucose excursion over the complete 5-hour MMTT compared to Humalog at both of the meal-to-dose 
timing intervals (immediately before the start of the test meal and 20 minutes following the start of the 
test  meal).  Consequently,  studies  ITRH  and  ITRW  support  extrapolation  of  the  beneficial  effects  of 
LY900014 also when given after the meal on post-meal glucose levels to T2D patients in addition to T1D 
patients. 
In ITRM (T1D), fasting glucose (FG) median (LS Mean) values at week 26 in the MMTT were 7.20 (7.41), 
6.58 (6.98), and 6.40 (7.02) mmol/L in the Humalog, LY900014, and LY900014+20 groups, respectively. 
In pairwise comparison, the LSM difference between LY900014 vs. Humalog was −0.43 mmol/L (95% CI 
[−0.75,  −0.12]  p=0.007) and  between  LY900014+20  and  Humalog,  −0.39  mmol/L  ([−0.74,  −0.04], 
p=0.029). These differences in FG at Week 26 in favour of LY900014 vs. Humalog and LY900014+20 vs. 
Humalog were not expected, as the duration effect of the prandial insulin prior to evening snack does not 
extend to following morning. The finding might be speculated to be due to lower postprandial excursion 
after  evening  snack  in  the  previous  evening  that  is  still  reflected  in  the  morning  glucose  level.  No 
difference in FG was observed between LY900014 and Humalog groups in T2D patients (ITRN). 
Incremental  Area  Under  the  Serum  Glucose  Concentration  Time  Curve  (iAUC)  during  MMTT  was 
determined in both ITRM (T1D) and ITRN (T2D) based on samples collected in the MMTT up to 2 hours 
post-meal. In both studies, iAUC was statistically significantly lower with LY900014 than with Humalog 
during the 4-hour test at Week 26. In ITRM, iAUC was statistically significantly higher in LY900014+20 
versus LY900014 during the 4-hour test at Week 26. 
The  primary  objective  of  the  ITRM  (T1D)  CGM  substudy  was  to  compare  double-blind  LY900014  and 
Humalog with respect to the iAUC0-2hrs after breakfast obtained from up to 14 days of CGM use at Week 
26.  In  the  substudy,  LY900014  significantly  reduced  the  iAUC0-2hrs  after  breakfast  at  Week  26  when 
compared to Humalog (relative reduction ~51%) and significant reductions continued for comparisons of 
iAUC0-3hrs (relative reduction ~70%) and iAUC0-4hrs (relative reduction ~87%). The ambulatory glucose 
profiles obtained in the ITRM CGM substudy show similar improvement in PPG control after lunch and 
dinner.  In  ITSI  (T1D,  CSII),  similar  trend  for  lower  iAUC  for  LY900014-treated  patients  was  seen, 
however ITSI was not powered to show statistical differences in efficacy endpoints. The results on iAUC 
are considered to highlight the clinical importance of achieved improvement in postprandial control more 
robustly than point measures at 1 and 2 hours post-meal.  
The ITSI (T1D, CSII) contained a summary and analysis of duration of time (percentage and minutes) in 
glucose  target  ranges  for  daytime,  night  time,  post-breakfast,  and  24-hour  periods.  Target  ranges 
analysed were 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L, 3.9 to 7.8 mmol/L, and ≤10.0 mmol/L. No statistically significant 
treatment differences in the mean duration of time in any of the target ranges for daytime, night time, 
and 24-hour period were seen; only a trend towards more time with glucose in the target ranges during 
the daytime and 24-hour periods for LY900014-treated patients. However, in the better-powered ITRM 
(T1D) substudy, time in range [3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L] at week 26 was 43.6 minutes more and in range 
[3.9 to  7.8  mmol/L]  40.8  minutes  more  during  daytime  in  the  LY900014  group  vs.  Humalog.  No 
statistically significant differences were seen between LY90014+20 vs. Humalog. However, patients in 
the LY900014+20 group were significantly less time in range than patients in the LY900014 group. Time 
in hyperglycaemia (>10 mmol/L) was not different between LY900014 and Humalog. The LY900014+20 
group had ~20 minutes longer time in hyperglycaemia during night time in comparison with Humalog; 
and  furthermore,  ~63  minutes  more  time  in  hyperglycaemia  during  daytime  and  ~75  minutes  more

during the 24-hour period in comparison with LY900014 group. These results strengthen the conclusion 
that injecting LY900014 post-meal may be an alternative to Humalog premeal (and Humalog post-meal), 
but the best option is to inject LY900014 premeal, if feasible. 
Samples were collected in all three Phase 3 studies for determination of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) 
levels in plasma, a marker of short-term glucose control and treatment response, especially postprandial 
hyperglycaemia. Low levels of circulating 1,5-AG have been implicated to be useful as predictor for micro- 
and macrovascular events and even mortality of diabetic patients (Selvin et al 2014, Selvin et al 2016, 
Shiga et al). However, the data are mostly from retrospective databases, and no long-term trial data are 
available on this matter. In the ITRM (T1D), 1,5-AG levels improved (increased) in the LY900014 group 
and  decreased  in  the  Humalog  and  LY900014+20  groups,  and  at  Week  26  the  LSM  difference  was 
statistically significant in favour of LY900014 vs. both other groups. In the ITNR (T2D) and ITSI (T1D, 
CSII), however, no difference was seen between study arms. The Applicant discussed that several factors 
might  have  confounded  the  results  on  1,5-AG  in  the  ITRN  study,  including  variable  dietary  intake,  a 
potential non-linear relationship between glycaemia and 1,5-AG, especially near the renal threshold, the 
biological variability in renal threshold for glucose reabsorption, potential confounding by SGLT2 inhibitor 
use in ITRN, and the different degrees of glycaemic control achieved between studies. At Week 52, the 
HbA1c  values  and  proportions  of  subjects  meeting  HbA1c  targets  were  similar  in  the  LY900014  and 
Humalog groups. Postprandial glucose excursions were significantly lower with LY900014 than Humalog 
through-out the study and also at 52 weeks. 
Health outcome measures in the ITRM (T1D) and ITRN (T2D) showed no clinically relevant differences 
between groups.  
Subgroup analyses were conducted in studies ITRM (T1D) and ITRN (T2) for multiple demographic and 
disease characteristics. In study ITSI, there were no subgroup analyses for HbA1c because efficacy was 
not a primary objective.  
Subgroup  analyses  demonstrate  consistent  treatment  effects  across  all  subgroup  analyses  with  three 
exceptions. Statistically significant differences in glycaemic response were seen in one subgroup of T1D 
subjects, divided by baseline 2-hour PPG at baseline ≤10 mmol/L vs. >10 mmol/L (p= 0.084). The 95% 
CIs for both PPG subgroups led to the same conclusion in noninferiority. In T2D subjects, two subgroups 
had  a  statistically  significant  treatment-by-subgroup  interaction  based  on  MMRM:  the  subgroup  of 
baseline HbA1c at ≤8.0% and >8.0% (p=0.017) and the subgroup of BMI at <35 kg/m2 and ≥35 kg/m2 
(p=0.058). The number of patients in the HbA1c >8.0% subgroup (LY, n=46; Humalog, n=44) was small 
compared to the HbA1c ≤8.0% subgroup (LY900014, n=270; Humalog, n=276). The 95% CIs for both 
BMI  categories  led  to  the  same  conclusion  in  noninferiority.  These  findings  are  not  unexpected.  In 
patients with worse glycaemic control, there is more room for improvement, which may explain the larger 
difference in efficacy achieved by LY900014 vs. Humalog in patients with higher HbA1c. In more obese 
patients, on the other hand, the relative benefit by enhanced absorption of LY900014 vs. Humalog could 
be  reduced due to the  thicker  subcutaneous tissue that does not  allow  speedy  absorption.  The  noted 
treatment-by-subgroup interactions are not considered clinically relevant. Results of all other subgroup 
analyses were consistent with the primary analysis.  
Human factor (HF) studies were performed by the Applicant. The first tested two proposed label patterns 
and two proposed colour palettes. No differentiation failures were noted. The second study was conducted 
to evaluate the three pen designs (KwikPen 100 units/mL, KwikPen 200 units/mL, and Junior KwikPen) for 
differentiation  against  themselves  and  other  insulin  pen  products  in  order  to  determine  readiness  to 
proceed  to  HF  validation  testing.  No  errors  were  made  by  the  61  adult  participants  (adult 
patient/caregiver,  nurse,  pharmacist,  or  colour-blind  consumer).  However,  five  paediatric  participants 
aged 10 to 13 experienced difficulties in distinguishing the pens, especially in differentiation of the three 
LY900014  KwikPen  variants.  The  Applicant  was  asked  to  justify  the  colours  of  the  prefilled  pens  and

packages. The Applicant referred to low reporting rates of medication errors in the EU across all Humalog 
KwikPen  types/strengths,  ranging  from  0.01%  to  0.02%.  In  the  end,  also  children  should  be  able  to 
distinguish between the pens since paediatric development is ongoing for LY900014. It is, however, not 
expected that a child with diabetes would have access to different kinds of bolus insulins. Furthermore, as 
the pens yield units (instead of volumes), mixing pens with the two different strengths would not affect 
the  insulin  dose  actually  given.  As  a  conclusion,  the  similarity  of  the  colour  scheme  of  the  LY900014 
KwikPens with 100 and 200 U/mL and KwikPen Junior is not expected to cause unacceptable hazard.  
The Applicant was requested to justify the KwikPen Junior presentation in this application that concerns 
only adults. It is noted that the Junior KwikPen is suitable for also adult patients who may benefit from 
finer insulin dose adjustment by steps of 0.5 units. The Applicant proposes a new design for the Liumjev 
100 units/mL Junior KwikPen outer carton and label mock-ups, which is less likely to give the impression 
that the pen was intended to be used for paediatric patients. The new design is deemed acceptable. The 
Applicant also proposes to add on the carton of the pen the sentence “For adults use only” to decrease the 
possible risk of off-label use in children and adolescents. This sentence is not considered efficient in the 
prevention of prescribing errors; this could have promotional connotations and moreover, the inclusion of 
additional non-statutory text may impair the readability of other important elements of the packaging. 
Therefore, the sentence is requested to be omitted from the carton.  
The  Applicant  also  submitted  preliminary,  scarce  data  from  ongoing  paediatric  studies  on  LY900014: 
ITSA,  a  PK/PD  study,  and  ITSB,  a  clinical  efficacy/safety  trial.  The  initial  results  show  a  faster  PK/PD 
profile in children and adolescents administered LY9000014 than Humalog.  
The Applicant prefers to keep the name Liumjev KwikPen Junior to retain consistency between the names 
of the Liumjev and Humalog pens. The Humalog KwikPen Junior also yields insulin in increments of 0.5 
units, and it might create confusion if adult subjects using Humalog KwikPen Junior were transitioned to 
using  Liumjev  KwikPen  Junior,  if  the  latter  was  named  differently.  This  appears  reasonable  and  is 
acknowledged.  Based  on  the  preliminary  information  submitted  by  the  Applicant,  the  incidence  and 
timing of hypoglycaemia in paediatric patients is not yet available. Some differences in at least timing of 
hypoglycaemia  are  expected  in  paediatric  vs.  adult  patients.  Since  larger  difference  in  postprandial 
glucose lowering between Lumjev and Humalog have been showed in children than in adults, it is possible 
that paediatric patients may experience more incidences of hypoglycaemia.  
As all aforementioned may still have an impact on medication errors, as well as on the safety of paediatric 
patients, the MAH is requested to monitor, analyse and report potential for medication errors and off-label 
use in the paediatric population linked to adverse reactions for Liumjev as part of the upcoming PSUSA for 
insulin lispro (covering all formulations for Humalog, Liprolog and (soon) Liumjev). Based on the analysis 
of  the  reported  data  as  part  of  the  upcoming  PSUSA,  the  MAH  should  also  discuss/propose  whether 
further risk minimisation measure(s) are considered necessary at this stage. 
The  results  on  HbA1c  and  post-meal  glucose  excursions  are  given  according  to  the  efficacy  estimand 
analyses in the proposed Product Information. This is considered acceptable, as for the treating physician 
and for the patient it is important to know what is expected when LY900014 is injected – hence, the result 
on only patients using the product, without those who discontinued, is valuable for treatment decisions. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Non-inferiority of LY900014 vs. Humalog in overall glycaemia (HbA1c) was demonstrated in T1D and T2D. 
The data from the clinical trials show that the shorter time-action profile of LY900014 in comparison with 
Humalog translates into statistically and clinically relevant differences in postprandial glycaemic control. 
The difference is larger in T1DM, but is considered to be clinically relevant also in T2D. Furthermore, 
analyses on time-in-range and incremental AUC of postprandial glucose concentration strongly support 
Assessment report

Page 134/177 
 
 
 
the  clinically  relevant  difference  between  LY900014  and  Humalog  on  postprandial  control.  Taking  in 
account  that  the  Phase  3  trials  ITRM  in  T1D  and  ITRN  in  T2D  were  conducted  according  to  the 
treat-to-target principle, no marked differences in overall glycaemic control were expected. However, in 
T1D, the achieved HbA1c was slightly (but not clinically relevantly) better with LY900014 than Humalog 
at  Week  26.  During  the  long-term  maintenance  period  of  ITRM,  the  difference  in  HbA1c  between 
LY900014 and Humalog decreased and was no more significant at week 52. 
The  results  obtained  by  several  different  methods  measuring  glucose  fluctuations  during  mixed-meal 
tolerance  test,  self-monitoring  of  glucose,  and  continuous  and  flash  glucose  monitoring  indicate  that 
LY900014 should optimally be injected prior to meal to achieve improvement in postprandial glycaemia 
compared with Humalog. However, if dosing prior to meal is not feasible, post-meal dosing is possible and 
results in comparable glycaemic excursions as achieved with premeal Humalog. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The active substance insulin lispro is known for more than 20 years. The present MAA concerns use in 
adults only. Paediatric development is, however, ongoing for LY900014. 
A  new  excipient,  treprostinil,  is  present  in  the  product.  Treprostinil  (a  prostacyclin  analogue)  has  a 
marketing authorisation for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in some EU member states. 
In  comparison  with  treprostinil  concentrations  in  PAH  patients,  both  the  Cmax  as  the  AUC(0-24h) 
obtained  after  SC  or  IV  administration  of  LY900014  were  more  than  1000-fold  lower  (after  IV 
administration of a 15U dose of LY900014, mean treprostinil Cmax was ~0.0275 ng/ml and AUC(0-tlast) 
was 0.0017 ng*h/ml – even when an anticipated maximum IV dose of 40U or a continuous IV infusion of 
30  U/h  is  administrated,  treprostinil  concentrations  would  be  either  non-detectable  or  transient 
detectable up to 10 minutes post-injection).  In addition, the clinical treprostinil AUC(0-24h) exposure in 
LY900014 is 460-fold to 9100-fold lower than the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) AUC(0-24h) 
exposure  of  treprostinil  in  the  rat,  rabbit,  or  dog  toxicology  studies.  Therefore,  no  clinically  relevant 
systemic exposure is expected of treprostinil following SC or IV administration of LY900014 doses used in 
clinical practice. Due to the negligible systemic exposure following SC and IV administration of LY900014, 
the safety of treprostinil per se has not been included in the safety assessment. 
No integrated safety database including both clinical pharmacology trials and Phase 3 trials was included 
in the submission. The Applicant integrated safety data from the Phase 3 MDI studies ITRM (T1D) and 
ITRN (T2D) except for hypoglycaemia and immunogenicity. Data from LY900014 and LY900014+20 were 
pooled as one treatment group (All LY) for comparison with Humalog. The integrated database includes 
data from the 26-week treatment period of the MDI studies. The 52-week safety data from ITRM and part 
of  4-week  safety  extension  data  from  ITRN  were  submitted  with  the  D121  response.  In  addition,  the 
safety and compatibility of LY900014 and Humalog administered via CSII was assessed based on the 
Phase 3 Study ITSI. Due to differences in the method of administration and design, data from Study ITSI 
was not integrated with the Phase 3 MDI studies. 
For the integrated MDI studies, two sets of analyses were conducted for many safety parameters (TEAEs, 
serious adverse events [SAEs], vital signs, subgroup analyses):1) analyses with available data regardless 
of treatment status and 2) analyses with data while the patient was on study drug. 
The  Applicant  also  submitted  integrated  safety  data  from  clinical  pharmacology  studies.  In  total,  the 
Applicant had performed 22 clinical pharmacology studies (in addition to 3 phase 3 studies). Of these, 
6 studies did not contribute to the integrated safety data: ITRA (treprostinil with insulin lispro vs Humalog 
in 28 heathy), ITRJ (LY900014 formulation vs Humalog in 24 healthy), ITRE (LY900014 vs Humalog in 
23 healthy), ITRH (LY900014 vs Humalog in 30 T2D), ITRG (LY900014 vs Humalog in 30 T1D), and ITRP 
Assessment report

(LY900014 in 24 healthy).  The Applicant adequately clarified the selection criteria of studies in the pooled 
analyses and provided safety data for several individual pharmacology studies upon request. 
Currently  the  combined  data  from  the  integrated  clinical  pharmacology  studies  evaluating  exposure, 
demographics,  disposition,  adverse  events,  hypoglycaemic  events, 
injection  site  reactions, 
immunogenicity,  clinical  laboratory  evaluations,  and  cardiovascular  safety  are  integrated  only  from 
7 studies that used the final LY900014 commercial formulation and included Humalog as the comparator. 
In clinical pharmacology studies, the results of patients with T1D and T2D were combined. The Applicant 
was requested to present the results for the T1D and T2D patients separately as e.g. for hypoglycaemia 
and immunology the events are dependent on diabetes type. The additional analyses performed by the 
Applicant yielded results consistent with the results of the Phase 3 studies. 
Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  safety  data,  different  statistical  methods  have  been  applied  in  the 
analyses. The methods as such are acceptable, however, the statistical analysis of the safety data is not 
controlled for type I error rate, nor are the studies powered for demonstration of differences, thus the low 
p-values  can  be  only  considered  as  indicative  of  potential  treatment  difference,  and  similarly  higher 
p-value may indicate no difference or lack of power to detect difference. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 1165 patients received LY900014 in the three Phase 3 studies: ITRM, ITRN and ITSI. Of these 
patients,  921  received  LY900014  as  multiple  daily  injections  for  at  least  180  days,  and  33  received 
LY900014  via  pump  for  at  least  42  days.  In  clinical  pharmacology  studies,  a  total  of  294  subjects 
(74 healthy subjects and 220 patients with T1D or T2D) received at least 1 dose of study drug (either 
LY900014 or Humalog). 
A  total  of  431.6  patient-years  (PY)  was  gathered  for  preprandial  LY900014  and  182.5  PY  for 
postprandially administered LY900014 in the ITRM study (T1D, MDI regimen, 52-week CSR). For CSII 
treatment, 5.6 PY were gathered in the ITSI study (T1D). In the ITRN study (T2D, MDI regimen), 164.0 
PY were gathered for preprandial LY900014.  
Differences in characteristics between T1D and T2D patients were typical (this could be assessed in phase 
III studies). 
Of the three pivotal studies, The ITSI study was the only study primarily for safety. It was designed to 
compare LY900014 and Humalog with respect to the rate of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion 
(CSII) set failures that led to premature infusion set changes due to a pump occlusion alarm or due to 
unexplained hyperglycaemia. 
Adverse events 
Table  27  presents  an  overview  on  the  AEs  in  the  Phase  3  MDI  studies.  In  the  Phase  3  MDI  studies 
(integrated safety database), the proportion of subjects with TEAEs was 57.3% in the Humalog group and 
58.1% in the LY900014 group. TEAEs reported in at least 5% of patients were nasopharyngitis and upper 
respiratory tract infection, reported at similar frequencies between treatment groups.

Table 27. Overview of AEs, integrated safety population, studies ITRM and ITRN 
In the integrated clinical pharmacology studies, TEAEs of all causalities (all subjects) occurred in 68/290 
(23.4%) in the LY900014 group and 64/289 (22.1%) in the Humalog group. The proportions of subjects 
with  TEAEs  between  LY900014  and  Humalog  were  in  the  same  order  of  magnitude  also  in  the 
subpopulations comprising healthy (41.1% vs. 38.4%) and diabetic (17.5% vs. 16.7%) subjects.

Study ITSI  
The ITSI study was primarily intended to support use of LY900014 for continuous subcutaneous insulin 
infusion (insulin pump) for T1D patients (N=49). The primary objective was comparison of LY900014 and 
Humalog with respect to the rate of infusion set failures that led to premature infusion set changes due to 
a pump occlusion alarm or due to unexplained hyperglycaemia with blood glucose (SMBG >13.9 mmol/L 
that did not decrease within 1 hour following a correction bolus delivered via the pump). No difference was 
seen between study arms, as 2 subjects in the LY900014 arm had two infusion set failures and 4 subjects 
in the Humalog arm had 4 infusion set failures. 
In ITSI, the TEAEs (all and related to study drug) were more than twice as common in the LY900014 arm 
than in the Humalog arm. This difference was driven by infusion site reactions (see separate chapter 
regarding injection and infusion site reactions). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In  Study  ITSI,  the  overall  incidence  of  SAEs  was  low.  Two  patients  (LY900014,  1  [2.0%];  Humalog, 
1 [2.1%]) reported SAEs, both were events of hypoglycaemia. No deaths occurred in ITSI. 
There  were  ten  death  events  in  studies  ITRM  (T1D)  and  ITRN  (T2D).  Five  deaths  occurred  from 
randomization  to  safety  follow-up  and  prior  to  database  lock  (All  LY,  3;  Humalog,  2).  Five  additional 
deaths (All LY, 4; Humalog, 1) were reported in Studies ITRM and ITRN as of 31 December 2018, including 
4 deaths (All LY, 3; Humalog, 1) reported after the safety follow-up visit and after the database lock, and 
1 death reported after the primary endpoint cut-off in Study ITRM (LY900014+20). There were no deaths 
in Study ITSI (T1D, CSII). 
None of the 10 deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. 
The most common SAEs in ITRM, ITRN and ITSI were hypoglycaemia SAEs. 
In  ITRM  T1D  patients,  no  differences  in  severe  hypoglycaemic  events  were  seen  between  the  study 
groups. The narrow MedDRA preferred term search, or survey of rate and incidence of severe post-meal 
hypoglycaemia  at  different  time  points  did  not  change  the  result  (See  also  Section  “Hypoglycaemic 
events”). 
During the 26 weeks in ITRN, no difference in hypoglycaemia SAEs in T2D at any time points was seen. 
With  regard  to  the  potential  severe  hypoglycaemia  events,  only  one  patient  had  reported  to  have 
hypoglycaemic shock (See also Section “Hypoglycaemic events”). 
In  ITSI  study  in  T1D  patients,  there  was  one  hypoglycaemia  SAE  in  both  groups  and  severe 
hypoglycaemia rates and incidences were similar in both study arms. 
In  Study  ITRR,  a  patient  experienced  a  SAE  of  hypoglycaemia  approximately  6  days  after  LY900014 
administration, which resulted in study discontinuation. The patient had switched to pre-study therapy 
(insulin aspart administered by CSII) 6 days prior to the event.  
Two SAEs of severe hypoglycaemia events were reported in studies evaluating insulin pump safety. The 
events were considered not related to study treatment. 
Even though the reporting rates of hypoglycaemic events as SAE were not different between LY900014 
and  Humalog,  differences  in  incidence,  rates,  and  timing  of  hypoglycaemic  events  were  seen  in  the 
collected  results  from  MMTTs,  CGM,  and  SMBG,  as  described  below  under  subtitle  “Hypoglycaemic 
events”. 
Injection and infusion site reactions and hypersensitivity 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 138/177 
 
 
 
In phase 3 studies, injection/infusion site reaction TEAEs (pain, itching, induration, erythema, oedema) 
were remarkably more common in the LY900014 group compared to the Humalog group: 30 (2.7%) vs 
1(0.1%) in ITRM and ITRN, and 19(38.8%) vs 6 (12.5%) in ITSI, respectively. 
In the integrated clinical pharmacology studies, injection site reactions occurred in 20/290 (6.9%) in the 
LY900014 group and 7/289 (2.4%) in the LY900014 group. 
Further, for ITSI the Applicant reported that infusion site reaction evaluation showed that “Most events of 
infusion site pain and infusion site induration were reported by a single Spanish site (50/62 for pain; 
18/20 for induration).” The Applicant explained that in the Spanish sites, the same infusion site reactions 
were reported by multiple channels: either spontaneous adverse event reporting or via the eDiary as the 
reason for an unplanned infusion set change, but as a unique AE, a practice that differs from standard AE 
reporting. Furthermore, the same infusion site reactions from different anatomical sites of infusion were 
counted as separate events. In all, 58 events of infusion site pain and 19 events of infusion site induration 
were reported by both Spanish sites. 
No between-group differences in other treatment-emergent hypersensitivity reactions were seen in Phase 
3  studies.  In  clinical  pharmacology  studies,  only  few  patients  reported  pain,  and  the  events  and  the 
magnitude were equally divided between the study groups. 
According to injection site assessments in studies evaluating treprostinil, treprostinil concentration did 
not  appear  to  be  in  relation  to  injection  site  reactions,  nor  did  sodium  citrate.  There  were,  however, 
between-group differences highlighting injection site reactions in subjects/patients both in PK and phase 
3 studies. The Applicant discussed that both local vasodilation by treprostinil and enhanced permeability 
by citrate, together with irritation caused by these excipients per se may be behind this difference. All 
injection site reactions were mild or moderate and resolved without sequalae. 
From long-term safety data of the ITRM study, over the course of the study from randomisation to safety 
follow-up,  more  patients  in  the  LY900014  (3.3%)  and  LY900014+20  (2.4%)  groups  experienced  ≥1 
injection  site  reaction  TEAEs  compared  to  the  Humalog  group  (0.9%).  The  mechanism  behind  the 
increased incidence of injection site reactions with LY900014 in comparison with Humalog is not known 
for certain. The Applicant discusses that the local vasodilatation by treprostinil and enhanced permeability 
by sodium citrate could both be partly responsible for this difference; or these compounds could per se 
cause the irritation. Treprostinil is known to cause injection site reactions when administered in higher 
doses as a vasodilatory drug; and citrate has been associated with injection site pain in other injectable 
products. Nevertheless, the injection site reactions were mild or moderate in severity, resolved without 
sequalae and did not lead to treatment discontinuation through Week 52. 
Hypoglycaemic events 
To  be  noted,  the  Applicant  has  applied  different  statistical  comparisons  in  the  safety  analysis.  The 
methods as such are acceptable, however, the statistical analysis of the safety data is not controlled for 
type I error rate, nor are the studies powered for demonstration of differences, thus the low p-values can 
be  only  considered  as  indicative  of  potential  treatment  difference,  and  similarly  higher  p-value  may 
indicate no difference or lack of power to detect difference.

T1D 
Study ITRM (T1D, MDI) 
There were 65 subjects with severe hypoglycaemic events in the 26-week period of ITRM: LY900014, 
n=25 (5.5%), Humalog, n=25 (5.7%), LY900014+20, n=15 (4.6%). The narrow MedDRA preferred term 
search, or survey of rate and incidence of severe post-meal hypoglycaemia at different time points did not 
change the result. 
The  rate  and  incidence  of  all  documented  hypoglycaemia  was  similar  in  the  Humalog  group  and  the 
LY900014+20  group,  and  slightly  lower  in  the  LY900014  group  than  in  the  other  groups  (incidence 
presented in Table 28). The incidence and rate of non-nocturnal hypoglycaemic events was slightly higher 
(both with BG <3.0 mmol/L and <3.9 mmol/L) when LY900014 was injected postprandially instead of 
preprandially (i.e., in the LY900014+20 group vs. the LY900014 group).

Table 28. Incidence of hypoglycaemia from randomization to week 26 prior to discontinuation of study 
drug (ITRM safety population)  
Long-term safety data (ITRM 52-week maintenance) 
From baseline to Week 52, the overall incidence and rate of severe hypoglycaemia were similar between 
the  double-blind  treatment  groups.  From  baseline  to  Week  52,  there  were  no  significant  treatment 
differences  between  the  double-blind  treatment  groups  in  the  rate  or  incidence  of  nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia,  non-nocturnal  hypoglycaemia,  all  documented  hypoglycaemia,  and  documented 
symptomatic hypoglycaemia with either glucose threshold (≤3.9 mmol/L [70 mg/dL] or < 3.0 mmol/L [54 
mg/dL]). The overall incidence of hypoglycaemic events decreased in the latter part of the study, as an 
obvious consequence of slight increase in overall glycaemia (HbA1c) from Week 26 to Week 52 in both 
study arms (Figure 55).

The rate and incidence of postprandial hypoglycaemia was different for the two products. At >4 hours 
post-meal  at  both  blood  glucose  (BG)  thresholds,  the  rate  of  documented  symptomatic  and  of 
documented symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia were statistically significantly lower in the 
LY900014 versus Humalog group. At ≤1 hour post-meal (BG <3.0 mmol/L [54 mg/dL]), the incidence of 
documented  symptomatic  hypoglycaemia  and  of  documented  symptomatic  and  asymptomatic 
hypoglycaemia were statistically significantly higher in the LY900014 versus Humalog group (Figures 56 
and 57).

Study ITSI (T1D, CSII) 
There was one episode of severe hypoglycaemia in both Humalog and LY900014 groups during study 
ITSI, and one case of potential severe hypoglycaemia in both groups, too. 
The rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia, all document hypoglycaemia, and 
non-nocturnal hypoglycaemia rate were higher in the LY900014 group compared to the Humalog group

whether using the BG <3.9 mmol/L threshold or BG <3.0 mmol/L threshold (see Table 29, data given for 
the last 2 weeks of the 6-week period). This trend was also seen in the incidence of hypoglycaemic events 
and  with  BG  <3.0  mmol/L.  During  0-6  weeks,  the  documented  symptomatic  hypoglycaemia  rate  was 
higher in the LY900014 group compared to the Humalog group with BG <3.0 mmol/L in ITSI T1D patients 
(aggregate rate/year 5.81 vs 3.25 respectively; data not shown in Table 29). 
Additionally, the incidence of nocturnal hypoglycaemia <3.0mmol/L in the LY900014 group was higher 
(5 vs. 2 events). When using the BG<3.9 mmol/L threshold, the rate (12.54 vs. 13.92 per year) and 
incidence (27.7 % vs. 31.9 %) of nocturnal hypoglycaemic events were in the same order of magnitude 
in the LY900014 group compared with Humalog group (table 30).

Post-meal hypoglycaemia (T1D) 
The rate and incidence of documented symptomatic and asymptomatic post-meal hypoglycaemia (with 
BG<3.0  mmol/L  and  <3.9  mmol/L)  was  smaller  in  the  LY900014  group  (premeal  administration) 
compared to Humalog group at >4 hours in T1D patients (Tables 3.3.8.4 and 3.3.8.5). 
On  the  other  hand,  the  incidence  and  rate  of  documented  symptomatic  hypoglycaemia  was  overall 
slightly higher at most time points during the first 4 hours after start of the meal in the LY900014 group 
than in the Humalog group (Tables 3.3.8.4 and 3.3.8.5). 
The  postprandial  administration  of  LY900014  (LY900014+20)  caused  slightly  more  post-meal 
hypoglycaemia  than  premeal  administration  of  LY900014.  Overall,  the  differences  in  rates  of 
hypoglycaemic events between the three groups were small.

Time with glucose in hypoglycaemic ranges (T1D) 
Continuous glucose monitoring was used in the ITSI study (T1D, CSII) and in the ITRM CGM substudy 
(T1D). 
In  ITSI,  duration  of  time  (percentage  and  minutes)  in  hypoglycaemia  was  analysed  for  daytime, 
night-time, and 24-hour periods, by infusion set wear day for each 6-week treatment period. The results 
are presented in Figure 3.3.8.1 (Weeks 4 to 6 of the 6-week treatment period). 
•  On Day 1 of infusion set wear, in the LY900014 group, shorter mean duration of time with glucose 
<2.8 mmol/L, <3.3 mmol/L and ≤3.9 mmol/L during the 24-hour period was observed compared 
to Humalog: 
o  <2.8 mmol/L (LSM): LY900014, 9.55 minutes; Humalog, 17.97 minutes 
o  <3.3 mmol/L (LSM): LY900014, 28.74 minutes; Humalog, 42.87 minutes 
o  ≤3.9 mmol/L (LSM): LY900014, 69.18 minutes; Humalog, 95.35 minutes 
•  On Days 2 and 3 of infusion set wear, more time in hypoglycaemia with glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L was 
observed for LY900014-treated patients vs. Humalog.

that LY900014 was associated with somewhat less time in hypoglycaemia in comparison with Humalog.

The CGM-based follow-up indicates that there would be slightly less hypoglycaemia in T1D patients when 
using  LY900014  instead  of  Humalog.  In  the  ITRM  study  overall,  there  were  no  statistical  differences 
between LY900014 and Humalog in hypoglycaemia incidence overall. However, in the ITSI study, there 
were  non-significantly  more  hypoglycaemias  in  the  LY900014  group  within  4  hours  after  meal  as 
measured by SMBG. The SMBG measurements and CGM results are, however, not comparable, as the 
latter method gives data from more time points, including asymptomatic hypoglycaemia; whereas the 
SMBG  results  are  not  only  routine  measurements,  but  also  contain  measurements  performed  due  to 
hypoglycaemic symptoms.

During  the  26  weeks  in  ITRN  (T2D),  the  incidence  of  severe  hypoglycaemia  was  7  episodes/337 
subjects in the Humalog groups and 4 episodes/336 subjects in the LY900014 group; and the aggregate 
rate/100 years was 4.19 vs. 2.44 in the Humalog and LY90014 groups, respectively. 
In ITRN T2D patients, higher documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia rate (with BG <3.0 mmol/L) 
was observed in the LY900014 group compared to the Humalog group. Also, higher rate and incidence of 
non-nocturnal hypoglycaemia (with BG ≤3.9 mmol/L) was observed in the LY900014 group compared 
to the Humalog group (see Table 32).

to discontinuation of study drug (ITRN safety population)  
Post-meal hypoglycaemia (T2D) 
In  T2D  patients  the  rate  of  both  symptomatic  as  well  as  symptomatic  and  asymptomatic  post-meal 
hypoglycaemia was higher with BG <3.9 mmol/L in the LY900014 group compared to the Humalog group 
at all hourly time intervals up to 4 hours post-meal. Only after 4 hours from meal, rates of hypoglycaemic 
events between Humalog and LY900014 were overall similar. When combining documented symptomatic 
and  asymptomatic  post-meal  hypoglycaemic  events,  the  rate  was  higher  in  the  Humalog  group  after 
4 hours. (See Figures 3.3.8.3−3.3.8.6.)

 Laboratory findings 
No concern arose about elevated liver enzymes or bilirubin. No between-group differences were seen in 
other laboratory parameters either. These conclusions are based on ITRM and ITRN studies only, as in 
ITSI no post-baseline measurements were taken.  
No concern arose about laboratory findings in clinical pharmacology studies.

Safety in special populations 
Differences were seen in BMI sub-groups in relation to nasopharyngitis, but the results were contrary to 
the  treatment  groups  in  different  high  BMI  categories,  which  leads  to  the  conclusion  that  the  clinical 
importance might be scarce. 
The  Applicant  presented  upon  request  hypoglycaemia  events  from  studies  ITRM,  ITRN  and  ITSI 
(separately) in age categories <65, ≥65 years and filled out a table on adverse reactions for each age 
group. Severe hypoglycaemic events occurred in very few subjects above the age of 65, and no obvious 
difference was seen between study arms in severe hypoglycaemia. The rates of hypoglycaemia were not 
statistically different in subjects below 65 years of age and ≥65 years of age. However, as the numbers 
of subjects ≥65 years of age were relatively low, the comparison lacks statistical power. Numerically, the 
rate of all documented hypoglycaemic events and for documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic events 
(events/patient/year)  decreased  by  age  in  both  Humalog  and  LY90014  groups,  whether  using  the 
threshold  of  <3.0  mmol/L  or  <3.9  mmol/L.  The  rate  of  hypoglycaemic  events  was  overall  similar  in 
Humalog and LY900014+20 (post-meal administration) groups in the ITRM study; and slightly lower in 
the prandial LY900014 group. 
The obvious explanation for lower rates of hypoglycaemia in subjects above 65 years is that the glycaemic 
control was not as strict in the elderly subjects as in younger patients (see assessment of Question 85), 
which is also in line with treatment guidelines. 
The incidence of TEAE was comparable between Humalog and LY900014 in all age groups. There are no 
consistent differences in occurrence of any AE class, although there were some differences that can be 
interpreted as chance differences among a large number of comparisons (data not included for brevity). 
Four pregnancies were reasons for study discontinuation in Study ITRM in women receiving LY900014. 
Three pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortion and one was an empty sac. All cases were considered 
to be not related to study drug by investigator.  
Immunological events 
In the population PK analysis, baseline ADA status was a significant covariate on insulin lispro clearance. 
Of  all  patients  in  the  Phase  3  and  clinical  pharmacology  studies,  42.5%  (918  of  2160)  of  were  ADA 
positive at baseline. There was a small decrease in clearance (16.5%) in ADA-positive vs. ADA-negative 
subjects. Regardless of this, the baseline ADA status did not impact either the PK and glucodynamic faster 
time-action profile or safety of LY900014 compared to Humalog. 
Both MDI studies (ITRM in T1D and ITRN in T2D) provide immunogenicity data from a 26-week controlled, 
parallel-group period, including evaluation of potential effect of immunogenicity on efficacy endpoints, 
insulin dose, and safety. The T1DM study ITRM had additionally a 6-month safety extension period that 
was ongoing at the time of the dossier cut-off date for data inclusion. The Week 52 data up to end of 
safety period of ITRM were submitted in the D120 response and the final immunogenicity data from the 
ADA follow-up period with the D150 response. ADA were also measured in the ITSI study comparing in a 
cross-over setting LY900014 and Humalog when used as CSII. 
ITRM (T1D): ADA and TEADA 
In  Study  ITRM  (T1D),  similar  proportions  of  patients  in  each  treatment  group  had  detectable  ADA  at 
baseline,  i.e.  at  the  beginning  of  double-blind  period:  LY900014,  47.8%;  LY900014+20,  49.8%; 
Humalog, 44.2%. Hence, there were more ADA-positive subjects in the LY900014 arms already before 
exposure to LY900014, since all subjects had received Humalog during the lead-in period. Overall, from 
Week  0  to  Week  26,  there  were  similar  proportions  of  patients  in  each  treatment  group  with 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 151/177 
 
 
 
treatment-emergent anti-insulin lispro antibodies (TEADA) (table 33). At end of long-term maintenance 
period i.e. Week 52, the proportions of patients with TEADA had decreased and was significantly different 
in the Humalog and LY900014 groups: 11.8 % and 15.6 %, respectively. The LY900014+20 group was 
not continued after Week 26.  
Table 33. Immunogenicity results in T1D (ITRN) and T2D (ITRM) 
Patients with TEADA who had not returned to baseline were further entered in the ADA follow-up period, 
where they were followed at approximately 3-month intervals for a maximum of 6 months or until insulin 
lispro antibodies of the subject returned to baseline range, whichever occurred sooner. Of all randomized 
patients in ITRM, 147 (12%) met the criteria to enter the ADA follow-up period: 45, 55, and 47 in the 
Humalog, LY900014, and LY900014 postmeal groups, respectively. Of these, 131 (89.1%) completed the 
period.  
Throughout  the  lead-in,  treatment  and  safety  follow-up  periods  of  ITRM,  the  mean  anti-insulin  lispro 
levels (percent binding) were low. In patients with TEADA, the ADA percent binding was slightly higher in 
the Humalog group than in the LY900014 group (Figure 63). This difference in ADA levels between study 
arms was no more seen during the ADA follow-up period. The number of patients with TEADA decreased 
during the period: from 147 patients at visit 801 to 75 patients at visit 802, and 46 patients at visit 803.

ITRN (T2D): ADA and TEADA 
In Study ITRN (T2D), similar proportions of patients in each treatment group had detectable ADA at the 
beginning of the double-blind treatment period (LY900014, 34.6%; Humalog, 34.4% ).  
From  week  0  to  26,  more  patients  in  the  LY900014  group  (30.7%)  had  TEADA  compared  with  the 
Humalog  group  (23.7%).  However,  the  numbers of  subjects  with  TEADA  decreased  during  the  safety 
follow-up, and the difference was no more significant at the safety follow-up visit at Week 30 (proportion 
of TEADA-positive subjects 12.3% and 15.7 % in the in the Humalog and LY000014 groups, respectively). 
Over the course of Study INTR (T2D), most patients who developed TEADA had low % binding values and 
were cross reactive to native insulin. However, similar to T1D patients in ITRM, there was a trend for 
higher ADA percent binding levels in TEADA-positive subjects in the Humalog group than in the LY900014 
group (figure 64).

Figure 64. ADA (mean % binding) from lead-in to safety follow-up period for patients with TEADA, ITRN 
A  total  of  89  patients  (13%  of  randomized  patients  in  study  ITRN;  39  in  the  Humalog  and  50  in  the 
LY900014 group) met the criteria for the antibody follow-up period, of whom 82 completed the antibody 
follow-up  period.  During  the  ADA  follow-up,  the  number  of  patients  with  TEADA  decreased  from  89 
patients at visit 801 to 28 patients at visit 803. Also, the percent binding levels of TEADA in these patients 
decreased already during the safety follow-up period (figure 3.3.8.10) and were comparable during the 
ADA follow-up period (data not shown).  ADA levels did not correlate with HbA1c results or insulin doses 
in T2D subjects. 
In  ITSI,  26  patients  (53.1%)  had  TEADA,  with  12  (24.5%)  having  treatment-induced  ADA,  and  14 
(28.6%) having treatment-boosted ADA. 24 (92.31%) of the 26 patients with TEADA were positive for 
antibodies cross-reactive with native insulin. 9 (34.62%) of the 26 patients with TEADA had antibody 
levels (% binding) return to baseline at the last postbaseline visit. As all patients in ITSI were exposed to 
both LY90014 and Humalog, no comparison between treatments was performed. 
Impact of TEADA on clinical effects: 
Glycaemic control 
Throughout studies ITRM and ITRN, there were no treatment-by-TEADA interactions in overall glycaemic 
control (as measured by HbA1c) or basal, prandial, or total insulin doses.   
However,  T1D  patients  with  positive  TEADA  status  treated  with  LY900014  had  a  significantly  lower 
bolus:total insulin ratio than patients treated with Humalog (p=0.024) in the ITRM study. There was also 
a significant treatment-by-TEADA interaction for the 1-hour PPG excursion (p=0.039), but not for the 
2-hour PPG excursion, during the treatment period of 0 to 26 weeks in the ITRM study. Hence, some but 
Assessment report

not all of the benefit on early PPG excursion by using LY900014 vs. Humalog was lost in TEADA-positive 
T1D subjects without effect on overall glycaemic control.  
In ITRN, there was no treatment-by-TEADA interaction on PPG excursions. 
No differential treatment effect was seen on overall hypoglycaemia rates in Studies ITRM and ITRN for 
patients with or without TEADA. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In Study ITRM (T1D), a higher percentage of LY900014-treated patients with TEADA (LY900014, n=6 
[3.9%];  LY900014+20,  n=5  [4.9%])  reported  potential  systemic  hypersensitivity  reactions  (narrow 
MedDRA search terms) compared to patients without TEADA (LY900014, n=6 [2.0%]; LY900014+20, 
n=4 [1.8%]). On the contrary, in the Humalog group, potential systemic hypersensitivity reactions were 
more frequent in patients without TEADA (n=8 [2.7%]) than in patients with TEADA (n=0). 
In  T2D  patients  in  Study  ITRN,  similar  percentages  of  LY900014-  and  Humalog-treated  patients  with 
TEADA (LY900014, 2 [1.7%]; Humalog, 2 [2.2%]) and without TEADA (LY900014, n=4 [1.8%]; Humalog, 
n=6 [n=2.4%]) reported potential systemic hypersensitivity reactions (narrow MedDRA search terms). 
There  were 
too 
few 
treatment-emergent  systemic  hypersensitivity 
reactions 
to  analyse 
treatment-by-TEADA interaction. 
In both T1D and T2D, treatment-emergent injection site reactions occurred similarly in patients with and 
without  TEADA.  The  proportions  of  patients  with  injection  site  reaction  related  events,  study  arms 
combined, were as follows: 
− 
− 
ITRM: patients without TEADA (2.2%) and patients with TEADA (1.9%).  
ITRN: patients without TEADA (2.1%) and patients with TEADA (1.3%). 
As a conclusion, about half of T1D patients and one third of T2D patients were ADA-positive at baseline of 
the studies ITRN and ITRM, with high prevalence of cross-reactivity to native insulin. The proportion of 
subjects with TEADA was similar across study arms in ITRM (T1D). In T2D patients, evolution of TEADA 
was more frequent in patients administered LY900014 than Humalog during the treatment period of the 
study. On the other hand, ADA percent binding levels in TEADA-positive subjects were slightly higher in 
the Humalog arm in both T1D and T2D subjects. However, the difference in ADA levels decreased during 
the safety follow-up and was no more present during the ADA follow-up period of either ITRM or ITRN.  
ADA-positivity  did  not  affect  overall  efficacy  or  hypoglycaemic  events  in  either  T1D  or  T2D  subjects. 
TEADA affected slightly antihyperglycaemic effect at 1 hour in T1D, but not in T2D subjects; no effect on 
overall glycaemia was observed in either T1D or T2D subjects. Local hypersensitivity reactions were not 
consistently  associated  with  TEADA.  Systemic  hypersensitivity  reactions  were  scarce.  The  10-fold 
increased frequency of local hypersensitivity reactions at injection site in patients administered LY900014 
vs. Humalog is not explained by immunogenicity. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No structured DDI studies were conducted for LY900014; this approach was agreed by CHMP during SA 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/400498/2016). 
In ITRN, the patients were allowed to continue the use of up to 2 OAMs: metformin (70.6% at baseline) 
and SGLT2 inhibitor (17.7% at baseline) during the lead-in and treatment periods. In ITRM and ITRN 
Assessment report

overall, the All LY and Humalog groups were generally balanced with respect to concomitant medications, 
with 88.3% of patients using ≥1 concomitant medication. The most frequently used concomitant drugs 
were lipid modifying agents (45.6%), antithrombotic agents (25.1%), and analgesics and antipyretics 
(23.4%). Statistically significant treatment differences were observed for clopidogrel (All LY, 2.4%; 
Humalog, 1.4%; p=0.017), thyroid preparations (All LY, 13.7%; Humalog, 17.7%; p=0.006), and 
levothyroxine (All LY, 4.4%; Humalog, 6.8%; p=0.022). 
In ITSI, the most frequently used medications by category were lipid modifying agents (14 patients 
[28.6%]) and thyroid preparations (10 patients [20.4%]). The most frequently reported medications 
were levothyroxine sodium (9 patients [18.4%]) and fish oil (5 patients [10.2%]). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the Phase 3 MDI studies (integrated safety database), the frequency of patients with at least one AE 
leading to discontinuation of study drug was low and similar between the All LY (17/1895 [1.5%]) and 
Humalog (8/779 [1.0%]) treatment groups. Maternal exposure before pregnancy was the most common 
AE leading to treatment discontinuation in ITRM and ITRN. One patient receiving LY900014 discontinued 
the study due to a TEAE of injection site oedema. 
There were no discontinuations due to an AE during Study ITSI. 
In the integrated clinical pharmacology studies, five subjects were discontinued due to AE: two subjects 
in the LY900014 group (1 nasopharyngitis, 1 moderate hypoglycaemia) and two in the Humalog group 
(1 moderate  hypotension  and  1  mild  hyperglycaemia),  and  one  prior  to  receiving  study  treatment 
(increased systolic blood pressure). In addition to these 5 events, 1 patient decided to withdraw due to 
concern  about  study  procedures  (perceived  risks),  and  1  patient  was  withdrawn  due  to  physician 
decision: safety risk due to multiple hypoglycaemic events.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The active substance insulin lispro is known for more than 20 years. The present MAA concerns use in 
adults only. A new excipient, treprostinil, is present in the product. 
In total, the Applicant had performed 22 clinical pharmacology studies (in addition to 3 phase 3 studies).  
A total of 1165 patients received LY900014 in the three Phase 3 studies a.k.a. ITRM, ITRN and ITSI. Of 
these patients, 921 received LY900014 as multiple daily injections for at least 180 days, and 33 received 
LY900014 via pump for at least 42 days. In clinical pharmacology studies, a total of 294 subjects (74 
healthy subjects and 220 patients with T1D or T2D) received at least 1 dose of study drug (either 
LY900014 or Humalog). 
For safety analyses, the Applicant pooled safety results from the Phase 3 MDI studies ITRM and ITRN 
(except for immunogenicity and hypoglycaemic events) up to the 26-week follow-up. Data from 
LY900014 and LY900014+20 are pooled as 1 treatment group (All LY) for comparison with Humalog. 
Safety results from the long-term maintenance period of ITRM (T1D) were submitted in by the Applicant 
with the D121 responses. 
Assessment report

Depending on the nature of the safety data, different statistical methods have been applied in the analysis 
of  it.  The  methods  as  such  are  acceptable,  however,  the  statistical  analysis  of  the  safety  data  is  not 
controlled for type I error rate, nor the studies are powered for demonstration of differences, thus the low 
p-values  can  be  only  considered  as  indicative  of  potential  treatment  difference,  and  similarly  higher 
p-value may indicate no difference or lack of power to detect difference. 
Common AE 
In ITRM and ITRN, no differences in AEs in general were seen between the study groups in pooled data, 
but in ITSI, the TEAEs (all and related to study drug) were more than twice as common in the LY900014 
arm than in the Humalog arm. Also in the clinical pharmacology studies, TEAEs were more common in 
healthy  subjects  receiving  LY900014  than  in  healthy  subjects  receiving  Humalog,  and  this  was 
highlighted in TEAEs related to study treatment. The difference in TEAE frequency in ITSI and clinical 
pharmacology studies was driven by a higher incidence of injection and infusion site reactions in subjects 
administered  LY900014.  In  all  patients,  the  most  common  TEAEs  related  to  study  drug  were 
hypoglycaemia, headache and injection site reaction. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In the Phase 3 MDI studies (integrated safety data base), the percentage of patients reporting at least 
1 SAE was similar in the All LY and Humalog groups (7.7% and 8.5%, respectively). The most frequently 
(≥3 All LY patients) reported SAEs were hypoglycaemia, pneumonia, cellulitis, and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary  disease.  No  relevant  treatment  differences  and  no  clinically  important  differences  were 
observed between patients in the All LY and Humalog groups with respect to SAEs. 
In  Study  ITSI,  the  overall  incidence  of  SAEs  was  low.  Two  patients  (LY900014,  1  [2.0%];  Humalog, 
1 [2.1%]) reported SAEs, both were events of hypoglycaemia. 
There were ten death events in studies ITRM (T1D) and ITRN (T2D), none of which were considered by the 
investigator to be related to study drug. No deaths occurred in Study ITSI (T1D, CSII) or in the clinical 
pharmacology studies. 
Hypoglycaemia 
In the three Phase 3 studies, the rate and incidence of severe hypoglycaemia were overall low. In T1D, 
the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia in the ITRM study was for LY900014, n=25 (5.5%), Humalog, 
n=25 (5.7%), and LY900014+20, n=15 (4.6%). In the CSII study ITSI, there was one episode of severe 
hypoglycaemia  and  one  episode  of  potential  severe  hypoglycaemia  in  both  Humalog  and  LY900014 
groups (in total, 4). In the T2D study ITRN, there were 6/337 reports of severe hypoglycaemia in the 
Humalog group and 3/336 in the LY900014 group. Neither observed severe hypoglycaemic event rates 
nor  SAE  reports  on  hypoglycaemia  differed  overall  between  study  groups  in  any  of  the  analysed 
populations. 
In the hypoglycaemia event surveillance during MMTT in study ITRM (T1D), the rate and incidence of all 
documented hypoglycaemia was similar in the Humalog group and the LY900014+20 group, and slightly 
lower in the LY900014 group than in the other groups. Slightly more non-nocturnal hypoglycaemias (both 
with  BG  <3.0  mmol/L  and  <3.9  mmol/L)  were  seen  in  LY900014+20/LY900014  comparison  in  T1D 
patients in ITRM. The rate and incidence of both documented symptomatic and documented symptomatic 
and  asymptomatic  post-meal  hypoglycaemia  were  smaller  in  LY900014  group  compared  to  Humalog 
group at >4 hours. On the other hand, the incidence and rate of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia 
during the early post-meal period was higher in the LY900014 group than in the Humalog group. The 
postprandial administration of LY900014 (LY900014+20) caused slightly more post-meal hypoglycaemia 
than premeal administration of LY900014. Overall, hypoglycaemia caused by post-meal administration of 
LY900014 was in the same range as for Humalog. However, it is recommended that only if necessary in

certain situations, e.g. when there is uncertainty about the meal intake, Liumjev can be administered up 
to 20 minutes after starting the meal. 
In ITRN T2D patients, higher documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia rate (with BG <3.0 mmol/L) was 
observed  in  the  LY900014  group  compared  to  the  Humalog  group:  event  rate/year  (LSM  [SE])  was 
2.21[0.32] vs. 1.34[0.16] for LY900014 and Humalog, respectively. Also higher rate and incidence of 
non-nocturnal hypoglycaemia (with BG ≤3.9 mmol/L) was observed in the LY900014 group compared to 
the  Humalog  group  during  the  first  4  hours  post-meal.  Only  after  4  hours  post-meal,  higher  rates  of 
symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia were observed in the Humalog than in LY90014 group. 
The observed pattern of post-meal hypoglycaemia rates and incidence in the T2D patient population are 
suggestive  of  a  trend  towards  earlier  hypoglycaemic  events  with  LY900014  and  later  hypoglycaemic 
events with Humalog. This reflects the time-action profile of the insulin formulation as has been noted 
with  other  insulin  formulations  as  well.  As  the  patient  needs  to  be  aware  of  the  timing  of  potential 
hypoglycaemic episodes, information is included in the planned prescribing information, in both the SmPC 
and the PIL, with a warning in PL currently reading as follows: “Liumjev starts to lower blood sugar faster 
than  some  other  mealtime  insulins.  If  hypoglycaemia  occurs,  you  may  experience  it  earlier  after  an 
injection of Liumjev. If you often have hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this 
with your doctor.” 
In ITSI (T1D, CSII), the rate and incidence of all documented hypoglycaemia, documented symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia, and non-nocturnal hypoglycaemia were higher in the LY900014 group compared to the 
Humalog  group.  Documented  symptomatic  post-meal  hypoglycaemia  rate  was  also  higher  in  the 
LY900014  group  compared  to  the  Humalog  group.  Based  on  continuous  glucose  monitoring  (CGM), 
however, contradictory data regarding hypoglycaemia was retrieved in T1D patients. During CSII in ITSI, 
the time spent overall in hypoglycaemia was markedly shorter in subjects belonging to the LY900014 
group  instead  of  Humalog  group.  During  the  24-hour  period  the  differences,  during  the  first  day  of 
infusion set wear, were the following: <2.8 mmol/L (LSM): LY900014, 9.55 minutes; Humalog, 17.97 
minutes; <3.3 mmol/L (LSM): LY900014, 28.74 minutes; Humalog, 42.87 minutes, and ≤3.9 mmol/L 
(LSM): LY900014, 69.18 minutes; Humalog, 95.35 minutes. Similarly, in the ITRM CGM substudy, the 
results  on  the  analyses  of  time  in  hypoglycaemia  demonstrated  that  LY900014  was  associated  with 
somewhat less time in hypoglycaemia in comparison with Humalog.  
As  an  overall  conclusion  on  hypoglycaemic  events,  the  rates  of  severe  hypoglycaemia  or  nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia  did  not  differ  between  LY90014  and  Humalog.  Overall  incidence  and  rate  of 
hypoglycaemic  events  was  similar  in  T1D  patients  administered  Humalog  or  LY900014;  premeal 
administration of LY90014 was more beneficial in terms of hypoglycaemia than post-meal administration. 
In T2D, the incidence and rate of documented hypoglycaemia was slightly higher with LY90014. In both 
T1D  and  T2D,  the  timing  of  hypoglycaemic  events  followed  the  time-action-profile  of  LY900014  and 
Humalog: in the early post-meal period, more hypoglycaemia was noted with LY900014, and in the late 
(>4  hour)  post-meal  period,  more  hypoglycaemia  occurred  with  Humalog.  In  contradiction  with 
hypoglycaemia  results  obtained  by  SMBG  in  the  ITSI  study  (T1D  patients  using  insulin  pump),  CGM 
results indicate less hypoglycaemic events with LY90014 administered preprandially vs. Humalog. It is 
acknowledged that CGM yields more comprehensive data than SMBG. However, the clinical relevance of 
this finding is not known. 
Unit-to-unit interchangeability  of  LY900014  and  Humalog is  supported  by  the  AUC  of  lispro  with both 
products. Nevertheless, the time-action profile of LY900014 results in more rapid onset of action and 
slightly higher peak concentration of insulin than seen for Humalog, which should also be taken in account 
when switching from other mealtime insulin to LY900014, with individual monitoring and surveillance by 
the treating physician.  
Immunogenicity

Close to half of T1D patients had detectable ADA at the beginning of the 8-week lead-in period of ITRM 
(LY900014,  47.8%;  LY900014+20,  49.8%;  Humalog,  44.2%).  The  proportion  of  subjects  with 
treatment-emergent anti-insulin lispro antibodies (TEADA) at any time point from Week 0 to Week 26 was 
similar  across  study  arms:  LY900014,  33.8%;  LY900014+20,  31.5%;  Humalog,  32.0%.  At  Week  52, 
however,  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  TEADA  was  11.8%  in  the  Humalog group  and  15.6%  in  the 
LY900014 group due to higher proportion of subjects with treatment-induced ADA. At safety follow-up 
visit, the difference had decreased: proportion of TEADA-positive subjects was 10.9% in the Humalog and 
13.2% in the LY900014 group. 
26/49 of T1D patients in ITSI (CSII study) had TEADA, however, in 9 patients antibodies returned to 
baseline level at the last postbaseline visit. 
In Study ITRN (T2D), about one third of subjects had detectable ADA at the beginning of the 8-week 
lead-in period (LY900014, 34.6%; Humalog, 34.4%). Overall, at any time during the study (including the 
safety follow-up visit), the proportion of patients with TEADA was higher in the LY900014 group compared 
with the Humalog group (LY900014, 34.6%; Humalog, 27.0%; p=0.037). However, the groups did not 
relevantly  differ  any  more  at  safety  follow-up  visit,  as  in  part  of  the  subjects,  elevation  of  ADA  was 
transient. 
Most  patients  who  developed  TEADA  had  low  percent  binding  values  and  about  90%  of  ADA-positive 
patients in all Phase 3 studies were cross reactive to native insulin. The ADA percent binding levels were 
slightly  higher  in  the  Humalog  group  at  earlier  post  randomization  timepoints  in  both  T1D  and  T2D 
patients. During the long-term follow-up, this difference in ADA levels in patients with TEADA disappeared. 
In ITRM (T1D), a slight decrease in efficacy was noted at 1 hour in TEADA-positive vs. TEADA-negative 
subjects without effect on overall glycaemic control. There was also a small difference in prandial/total 
insulin dose ratio between TEADA positive and TEADA negative subjects in the LY900014 arm of ITRM. In 
T2D, no effect on glycaemic control by TEADA was observed. Long-term follow-up of immunogenicity in 
T1D patients did not reveal any relevant effect of immunogenicity on efficacy or safety.  
The most common SAEs in ITRM, ITRN and ITSI were hypoglycaemia SAEs. No differences in serious 
hypoglycaemia events were seen between the study groups in ITRM, ITRN and ITSI. 
Two SAEs of severe hypoglycaemia events were reported in studies evaluating insulin pump safety. The 
events were considered not related to study treatment 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In  Study  ITRM  (T1D)  overall,  69  patients  (5.6%)  experienced  ≥1  treatment-emergent  systemic 
hypersensitivity reaction by broad search terms and 30 patients (2.5%) by narrow search terms. By Week 
26,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  potential  systemic  hypersensitivity  reactions    was  higher  in 
LY900014-treated patients with TEADA, but lower in Humalog-treated patients with TEADA (LY900014, 
n=6  [3.9%];  LY900014+20,  n=5  [4.9%];  Humalog,  n=0)  compared  to  patients  without  TEADA 
(LY900014,  n=6  [2.0%];  LY900014+20,  n=4  [1.8%];  Humalog,  n=8  [2.7%])  by  Week  26.  From 
randomisation  to  Week  52,  the  number  of  subjects  with  potential  treatment-emergent  systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions was evenly distributed (total 36, 18 subjects in both Humalog and LY900014 
groups, narrow definition of MedDRA search terms). Of these, 14 and 9 were TEADA-negative and 2 and 
8  TEADA-positive  in  the  Humalog  and  LY900014  arms,  respectively.  In  Study  ITRN  (T2D),  similar 
percentages of LY900014- and Humalog-treated patients with TEADA (LY900014, 2 [1.7%]; Humalog, 2 
[2.2%])  and  without  TEADA  (LY900014,  4  [1.8%];  Humalog,  6  [2.4%])  reported  potential  systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions. The events were too scarce for statistical comparison. 
In phase 3 studies, injection site reaction TEAEs were remarkably more common in the LY900014 groups 
compared to the Humalog groups: in ITRM and ITRN, 30 (2.7%) vs 1(0.1%) (p<0.0001) for LY90014 and 
Humalog,  respectively.  None  of  these  events  were  reported  as  SAEs.  In  Study  ITSI,  the  incidence  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 159/177 
 
 
 
potential  treatment-emergent  infusion  site  reactions  (composite  term)  was  markedly  higher  for 
LY900014  compared  with  Humalog  (LY900014,  19  patients  [38.8%];  Humalog,  6  patients  [12.5%]; 
p=0.006). All events were mild (98.2%) or moderate (1.8%) in severity, none led to discontinuation, and 
all resolved during the study with no change to dosing of study drug.  
Also in clinical pharmacology studies, erythema was reported almost 10-fold as often after LY900014 SC 
doses as after Humalog SC doses. Erythema events were, however, very mild. According to injection site 
assessments in studies evaluating treprostinil, the concentration of treprostinil did not appear to be in 
relation to injection site reactions, nor did that of sodium citrate. There were, however, between-group 
differences highlighting erythema in subjects/patients both in PK and phase 3 studies. 
No  consistent  association  was  observed  between  local  hypersensitivity  reactions  and  TEADA,  hence, 
immunogenicity does not explain the 10-fold difference in injection/infusion site reactions with LY900014 
compared to Humalog. 
Systemic hypersensitivity reactions were too scarce for statistical analysis of comparative frequency. 
No concern arose about laboratory parameters, vital signs or ECG findings. As a vasodilator, treprostinil 
might lower blood pressure and cause tachycardia, but even in the PK study evaluating treprostinil, no 
such effects were seen. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The Applicant has provided a detailed and careful assessment of hypoglycaemic episodes. In both T1D 
and  T2D  patients,  the  hypoglycaemia  events  occurred  more  rapidly  with  LY900014  after  the  meals 
compared to Humalog; in Humalog groups, the hypoglycaemia events occurred closer to 4 h post-meal 
and in LY900014 groups starting right after the meals. This is in line with the nature of the new fast-acting 
product. In T2D, the incidence and rate of documented hypoglycaemia was slightly higher with LY900014. 
The rate of severe hypoglycaemia did not differ between LY900014 and Humalog. Overall incidence and 
rate of hypoglycaemic events was similar in T1D patients administered Humalog or LY900014 as MDI 
regimen; less with premeal administration of LY900014 vs. post-meal administration of LY900014. Early 
post-meal  hypoglycaemia  was  more  frequent  with  LY900014  and  late  post-meal  hypoglycaemia  with 
Humalog. There was a very small difference in diurnal timing in the MDI study with T1D subjects (ITRM): 
slightly  more  nocturnal  hypoglycaemia  with  Humalog  and  slightly  more  non-nocturnal  hypoglycaemia 
with LY900014. In the CSII study ITSI, slightly more hypoglycaemia was observed with LY900014 vs. 
Humalog,  except  for  the  CGM  results  in  T1D  patients  that  indicated  less  hypoglycaemic  events  with 
LY900014 administered preprandially. The decrease in especially glucose levels <2.8 mmol/L could help 
in preservation of adrenergic alert symptoms of hypoglycaemia if the CGM results are considered more 
reliable than hypoglycaemia results collected by other means. 
Some severe hypoglycaemia events - categorised as SAEs - were seen in the data, with no difference 
between study groups. The number of other SAEs was low. 
Erythema  was  reported  remarkably  more  often  in  the  LY900014  groups  than  in  the  Humalog  groups 
throughout the studies, but the number of events was, however, low, and the cases were generally very 
mild. Based on the safety data from PK studies, treprostinil or citrate did not appear to be in relation to 
injection site reactions. No obvious relation was seen between TEADA and local hypersensitivity reactions. 
Systemic hypersensitivity reactions were too scarce for statistical comparison between TEADA-positive 
and –negative subjects. 
At baseline, close to half of T1D subjects and one third of T2D had ADA. Most of the ADA-positive patients 
were cross-reactive to native insulin. Evolution of treatment-emergent ADA (TEADA) was closely similar 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 160/177 
 
 
 
in T1D patients in Humalog and LY900014 groups; however, at Week 52 there were more subjects with 
TEADA in the LY900014 group. In T2D patients, more subjects developed TEADA in the LY900014 group 
(34.6%) than in the Humalog group (27.0%). 
On the other hand, the ADA percent binding levels, though overall low, were slightly but significantly 
higher in the Humalog group at early time points in both T1D and T2D subjects. Since part of the elevation 
in ADA levels was transient, the difference between the Humalog and LY90014 groups decreased during 
the safety follow-up and was no more observed during the ADA follow-up period of either ITRM (T1D) or 
ITRN (T2D) studies.   
There was a statistically significant treatment-by-TEADA status interaction for bolus: total insulin dose 
ratio in T1D subjects, and further review showed that patients with positive TEADA status treated with 
LY900014 had a slightly but statistically significantly lower bolus: total insulin ratio than patients treated 
with  Humalog.  TEADA-positive  T1D  subjects  also  had  a  slightly  attenuated  effect  of  LY900014  on 
postprandial  glucose  at  one  hour  but  no  more  at  2  hours.  These  small  differences,  seen  only  in  T1D 
subjects, are not deemed clinically relevant. TEADA did not affect HbA1c levels or total daily insulin doses 
in either T1D or T2D subjects. Development of TEADA was not related to safety outcomes.  
The CHMP considers the safety profile acceptable.

requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
However, based on the difference in the pattern of hypoglycaemias between the new lispro formulation 
and the already approved formulations, the CHMP is of the opinion that the already existing entry in the 
EURD list for insulin lispro needs to be amended as follows (upon authorisation of Liumjev): the PSUR 
cycle for the medicinal product should follow a yearly cycle. The next data lock point will be 2020-04-30. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Liumjev (insulin lispro) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is a biological product authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
2.10.  Assessment for the purpose of Art 82(1) of Regulation EC No 
726/2006 (duplicates) 
Background for full stand-alone MA for Liumjev 
The Applicant claimed that there are distinct and clinically relevant differences between the two 
formulations (i.e. Humalog and Liumjev) which mandate different prescribing information and trade 
name for Liumjev and that therefore these two products would not fall within the scope of Article 82(1) of 
Regulation EC No 726/2004and that these differences include: 
With regards to the efficacy 
The data provided on Liumjev show that, compared to Humalog, there is a shift in the PK/PD profile 
resulting in an earlier onset of the glucose-lowering effect while the total glucose-lowering effect is 
similar. In the pivotal phase 3 studies, statistically significant lowering of the post-prandial glucose (PPG) 
increment with Liumjev compared to Humalog in patients with T1D and T2D was documented after 
26 weeks. The magnitude of this effect was highly significant and clinically relevant in TD1 (−1.55 
mmol/L at 1 hour and −1.73 mmol/L at 2 hours post-meal), with less pronounced but still clinically 
relevant effect in T2D (−0.67 mmol/L at 1 hour and -0.98 at 2 hours post-meal. This improved 
post-prandial control with LY900014 compared with Humalog was maintained up to 52 weeks in T1D 
subjects. The mean daily post-meal glucose excursions from premeal to 1 hour post-meal at Week 52 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 162/177 
 
 
 
were the following: LSMean difference −0.79 mmol/L (95% CI −1.11, −0.48, p<0.001); and from 
premeal to 2 hours post-meal: LSMean difference −0.46 (95% CI −0.78, −0.15, p=0.004).The difference 
in PPG lowering effect is reflected in the SmPC., 
Literature supports that increased PPG is important for glycaemic control overall and the relative impact 
of post-prandial glycaemia increases when HbA1c decreases. Potential independent role of PPG in the 
development of macrovascular and microvascular complications is still under debate, as long-term 
controlled data on PPG is scarce, and the hypothesis of importance of PPG is supported by epidemiological 
data mostly. Therapeutic guidelines recommend lowering of PPG in T1D as part of compensation for lack 
of physiological postprandial insulin secretion spikes. In T2D, post-prandial glycaemia should be targeted 
at least in patients unable to reach desired glycaemic control only by targeting fasting glucose. 
The MDI studies ITRM (TID) and ITRN (T2D) were conducted as treat-to-target studies. As expected, 
there was no statistically significant difference in HbA1c at week 26 in either study. Both studies met the 
primary endpoint of non-inferiority to Humalog in glycaemic control. 
Thus, it is agreed that Liumjev has shown statistically and clinically significant in 1h and 2h post-meal 
effect on lowering of PPG due to the two different excipients and can be considered as having significant 
difference regarding efficacy, compared to Humalog, and falls consequently outside of the scope of Article 
82 (1) of Regulation EC No 726/2004 (i.e duplicate MA). 
With respect to safety,  
There was a difference in the pattern of hypoglycaemic episodes in T2D (ITRN study). There was a 
significantly higher rate of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (BG <3.0 mmol/L) in the LY900014 
group than in the Humalog group overall (LSM Mean 2.21 versus 1.34 events/year; ratio [95% CI] =1.64 
[1.14, 2.38]); ≤2hours post-meal (1.23 vs. 0.66, RR=1.86 [1.08, 3.20]); ≤4hours post-meal (1.77 vs. 
0.98, ratio=1.81 [1.19, 2.74]); and >2 to ≤4hours post-meal (0.54 vs. 0.33, ratio=1.71 [1.09, 2.69]) for 
Liumjev compared to Humalog. 
In T1D (ITRM), on the other hand, after 4 hours post-meal the incidence of hypoglycaemic events was 
significantly larger in Humalog group compared to Liumjev from randomisation to week 26: rate/year(SE) 
for Humalog: 26.00(1.94), LY90014: 19.89(1.38), ratio [95% CI] 0.76 [0.63, 0.93].  
Over the controlled treatment period from randomisation to end of the 56-week controlled period, rate 
(events/patient/year, LSM (SE)) and incidence (%) of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (BG≤3.9 
mmol/L) was closely similar as observed for the 26-week period. The rate at >4 hours from meal was in 
the Humalog group significantly higher than in the LY900014 group: 22.02/year, 77.2% vs. 16.75/year 
(RR 0.76, p= 0.0009). The incidence of hypoglycaemia at >4 hours postmeal was 77.2% in the Humalog 
group vs. 75.6% in the LY900014 group. Results were similar when using the more stringent threshold of 
3.0 mmol/l for hypoglycaemia: incidence 43.4% and 40.1% in Humalog and LY900014 groups 
respectively, and rate 2.20 vs. 1.52, respectively (RR 0.69, p=0.023) at >4 hours post-meal. Using the 
3.0 mmol/L threshold, there was additionally a statistically significant difference in early post-meal 
hypoglycaemia at ≤1 hour post-meal (from randomisation to week 56) with higher rate and incidence in 
the LY900014 group: rate 0.77 vs. 0.63 and incidence 29.7 % vs. 21.7 % (RR 1.22, p = 0.007) in the 
LY900014 vs. Humalog group. However, the overall rate and severity of events was comparable between 
treatments. It has been reflected in the SmPC that hypoglycaemia may occur earlier after an 
injection/infusion of Liumjev compared to other mealtime insulins. 
In the insulin pump study ITSI (T1D, there was a higher rate of non-nocturnal hypoglycaemia 
(BG<3.9 mmol/L) in the LY900014 than in the Humalog group (weeks 4-6 of the 6-week period): mean 
(SD): 42.9(57.66) for LY900014 versus 66.85(82.24) for Humalog. 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020

Therefore, it is agreed, that the difference in timing of hypoglycaemic episodes due to the different 
excipients can be considered a significant difference in safety between Liumjev and Humalog, and 
consequently Liumjev falls outside of the scope of Article 82 (1) of Regulation EC No 726/2004 (duplicate 
MA). 
As a conclusion, regarding the Applicant’s claim of significant differences in safety or efficacy in Liumjev 
vs Humalog for the purpose of Art 82(1) of Reg (EC) No 726/2004 and in view of the EC note on Handling 
of Duplicate Marketing Authorisation Applications Ares(2011)1044649, CHMP considers that Liumjev 
shows significant differences in terms of safety and efficacy due to different excipients versus Humalog in 
view of the difference in the timing of hypoglycaemia and significantly improved PPG (associated with 
differences in PK/PD).

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The target indication of LY900014 is treatment of diabetes in adults. 
The product is intended for use as mealtime insulin or for CSII. 
In LY900014, addition of two excipients has rendered the insulin time-action profile to shift to the left 
when compared with Humalog: enhanced absorption of insulin lispro through increased local vasodilation, 
due  to  the  addition  of  a  microdose  of  treprostinil  as  an  excipient  in  the  formulation;  and  speeding 
absorption of insulin through enhanced local vascular permeability, which is achieved by addition of the 
excipient  sodium  citrate  in  the  formulation.  The  quicker  time-action  profile  is  intended  to  help 
postprandial  glycaemic  control  in  patients  who  cannot  for  various  reasons  inject  prandial  insulin  in 
advance of the meal or cannot predict the amount of insulin needed for the meal beforehand. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Mealtime  insulin  or prandial  insulin  are  used  for  subcutaneous  bolus injection at  meals  for  controlling 
postprandial  glucose  excursions.  They  can  also  be  used  in  external  insulin  pump  for  continuous 
subcutaneous  insulin  infusion  to  cover  both  basal  and  bolus  insulin.  If  needed,  they  can  be  used 
intravenously,  too,  as  the  faster  time-action  profile  is  linked  to  faster  absorption;  however,  one  in 
circulation, they act similarly to human insulin. 
Rapid-acting  insulin  analogues,  first  of  which  was  insulin  lispro,  were  developed  to  enable  efficient 
postprandial glucose control. Compared to regular human insulin, insulin lispro has a more rapid onset, 
higher  peak  and  shorter  duration  of  action,  which  better  fits  for  controlling  postprandial  glucose 
excursions. The daily insulin regimen is adjusted individually for every patient. Prandial insulin boluses 
are  titrated  based  on  glucose  monitoring  and  carbohydrate  content  of  the  meal  to  achieve  glycaemic 
targets.  Even  with  rapid-acting  insulin  analogues,  efficient  control  of  postprandial  glucose  elevation 
requires preprandial administration of insulin, optimally 15 to 20 minutes before the start of a meal, so 
that the peak insulin concentration occurs concomitantly with postprandial glucose elevation. In many 
instances,  appropriate timing is  not  feasible; e.g.  if  the patient  cannot  anticipate  the time of  meal or 
amount  of  ingested  carbohydrates.  Sometimes  faster  cessation  of  action  is  also  beneficial,  e.g.  if  the 
patient needs to exercise a few hours after injecting insulin. 
In clinical practice situations, when prandial insulin needs to be injected during or after the meal instead 
of  before  meal,  are  common.  Hence,  there  is  need  for  more  rapid  insulin  formulations  than  current 
rapid-acting  analogue  insulins  such  as  lispro  (Humalog,  Liprolog,  Insulin  lispro  Sanofi),  aspart 
(NovoRapid), or glulisine insulin (Apidra). There already is on the market one ultra-rapid mealtime insulin 
product,  Fiasp-insulin:  insulin  aspart  formulation  in  which  the  addition  of  nicotinamide  (vitamin  B3) 
results in a faster initial absorption of insulin. 
The purpose of the development of LY900014 has been to provide a faster glucose-lowering effect that 
mimics more closely the physiological carbohydrate absorption profile and mealtime insulin response than 
the currently available insulin lispro products.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
In addition to 22 clinical pharmacology PD/PK-studies, two Phase 3, prospective, randomized, outpatient, 
multinational, multicentre, parallel, active-controlled studies with a multiple daily injection (MDI) regimen 
were conducted to establish the efficacy of LY900014 to improve glycaemic control: Study I8B-MC-ITRM 
(ITRM) in patients with T1D, and Study I8B-MC-ITRN (ITRN) in patients with T2D. A third Phase 3 study, 
Study  I8B-MC-ITSI  (ITSI),  a  prospective,  randomized,  double-blind,  crossover  comparison  evaluating 
compatibility  and  safety  of  LY900014  and  Humalog  with  an  external  continuous  subcutaneous  insulin 
infusion (CSII) system in adult patients with T1D. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Pharmacodynamic data show an earlier onset of action with LY900014 compared to Humalog. The total 
exposure  to  insulin  lispro  (AUC0-∞)  is  similar  between  LY900014  and  Humalog.  Due  to  more  rapid 
absorption, Cmax is slightly higher for LY900014 compared with Humalog following a SC injection. A 14% 
increase in  Cmax  was  estimated  in  a  meta-analysis of  four  clinical  studies.  This  small  difference  is not 
expected to have clinical consequences.

100 U/mL formulations was demonstrated in a euglycaemic glucose clamp study in healthy subjects. 
In  the  two  Phase  3  multiple-daily-injection  regimen  studies  in  TD1  and  TD2  patients  LY900014  was 
non-inferior compared to Humalog for change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26. The changes were for 
ITRM, T1D patients, [-0.08 (-0.16, 0.00)] and ITRN, T2D patients, [-0.08 (-0.16, 0.00)]. Non-inferiority 
was confirmed by analyses according to efficacy and ITT estimands. 
LY900014 treatment demonstrated consistently better PPG control compared to Humalog. Studies in both 
T1D and T2D met 2 prespecified multiplicity objectives; when administered prior to the start of the meal, 
LY900014 was superior to Humalog in controlling 1-hour and 2-hour PPG excursions during mixed meal 
tolerance test. Results from the 10-point SMBG profile data support improved PPG control in T1D patients 
(IRMN) with LY900014 (ITT estimand). ITRM, 1-hour difference: -1.55 mmol/L (-1.96, -1.14) and 2-hour 
difference:  -1.73  mmol/L  (-2.28,  -1.18).  The  respective  results  for  T2D  were  at  1  hour:  -0.66 
(-1.01, -0.30) mmol/L (ITRN). Closely similar results were obtained in the efficacy estimand analyses. 
Additionally,  PPG  lowering  was  statistically  significantly  better  with  LY900014  compared  to  Humalog 
during the entire 4-hour MMTT (iAUC0-4 hours) in T1D patients and in T2D patients. Improved postprandial 
control with LY900014 in comparison with Humalog was maintained up to 52 weeks in T1D subjects. 
In  Study  ITRM(T1D),  post-meal  LY900014+20  was  noninferior  to  Humalog  for  glycaemic  control  as 
measured by change in HbA1c, but change in HbA1c was statistically significantly higher in LY900014+20. 
In T2D patients, no difference in HbA1c between study groups was seen. 
Support for differential effect on glucose excursions and variability were obtained by SMBG, continuous 
glucose  monitoring,  assessment  of  incremental  iAUC  during  MMTT  and  by  measuring  fasting  glucose. 
iAUC was in T1D patients (ITRM) statistically significantly lower in LY900014 versus Humalog at all time 
intervals  during  MMTT  (0-30  minutes,  0-1  hour,  0-2  hours,  0-3  hours,  and  0-4  hours);  statistically 
significantly higher in LY900014+20 group versus Humalog at 0-30 minutes and 0-1 hour, but similar at 
0-2  hours,  0-3  hours,  and  0-4  hours;  and  statistically  significantly  higher  in  LY900014+20  versus 
LY900014 at all time intervals (0-30 minutes, 0-1 hour, 0-2 hours, 0-3 hours, and 0-4 hours). 
In ITRM (T1D), fasting glucose (FG) values at week 26 in the MMTT were significantly lower in patients 
administered LY900014 either premeal (6.58 mmol/L) or post-meal (6.40 mmol/L) in comparison with 
Assessment report

Page 166/177 
 
 
 
 
Humalog (7.20 mmol/L). No difference in FG was observed between LY900014 and Humalog groups in 
T2D patients (ITRN). 
1,5-anhydroglucitol  (1,5-AG)  was  measured  in  the  Phase  3  studies  as  a  marker  of  postprandial 
glycaemia, which has been implicated as risk factor for diabetic micro- and macrovascular complications. 
1,5-AG levels increased (improved) from baseline to week 26 in T1D patients treated for 26 weeks with 
mealtime  LY900014  and  decreased  in  Humalog  and  LY900014+20  groups  (study  ITRM).  However, 
regardless of lowering of PPG excursions, no similar improvement was observed in T2D patients or in the 
CSII study ITSI on T1D patients. 
No difference was seen in the ITRM study (T1D) in the mean SMBG values (from all time points of day) at 
week  26  between  preprandial  LY900014  compared  to  Humalog.  However,  when  postprandial  and 
preprandial administration of LY90014 was compared, mean BG was statistically significantly lower in the 
LY900014 arm (8.93 mmol/L) versus LY900014+20 arm (9.27 mmol/L), p=0.011. Also in T2D (ITRN) 
mean  PPG  excursions  during  MMTT,  were  at  week  26  statistically  significantly  lower  with  LY900014 
compared  to  Humalog,  at  all  time  points  from  30  minutes  to  4  hours.  SMBG  demonstrated  that  PPG 
excursions  from  premeal  to  1  and  2  hours  post-meal  daily  mean  was  statistically  significantly  lower 
LY900014 compared to Humalog, at both time points. 
Basal,  bolus  and  total  insulin  doses  were  similar  between  study  arms  in  both  MDI  studies.  A  similar 
increase in insulin doses was seen in both studies and all study arms. 
The ITRM substudy with continuous glucose monitoring demonstrated that in T1D patients, time in target 
range [3.9 to 7.8 mmol/L] could be markedly different depending on prandial insulin formulation and 
timing of injection. At Week 26: LY900014 group was 40.8 minutes more time in range (p=0.015) during 
daytime  with  no  other  differences  noted  for  night-time  or  24-hour  periods  versus  Humalog.  No 
statistically  significant  treatment  differences  were  seen  in  comparison  between  LY900014+20  versus 
Humalog. However, in comparison with preprandially injected LY900014, patients who injected LY900014 
postprandially  (LY900014+20),  were  57.0  minutes  less  time  in  range  (p=0.001)  during  daytime  and 
67.7 minutes less time in range (p=0.004) during the 24-hour period. 
Similar results were obtained from CGM in the ITSI study (T1D, CSII). Patients treated with LY900014 
spent more time with glucose in the target ranges on both Day 1 and Day 3 of infusion set wear when 
compared  to  patients  treated  with  Humalog;  however,  ITSI  was  not  powered  to  show  statistical 
differences in efficacy endpoints. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In  T2D,  the  benefits  achieved  by  using  LY900015  preprandially  vs.  Humalog  preprandially  are  not  as 
strong as in T1D. Whereas the 2-hour glucose excursion decreases ~1.7 mmol/L in T1D patients, the 
corresponding  decrease  in  T2D  patients is  only  -0.96  mmol/L.  In  T2D  the  mean  improvement  in  PPG 
control did not reflect to overall glycaemic control, either. 
All other measures of glycaemic variability show more moderate effect difference between Humalog and 
LY900014 arms, too. E.g., the SMBG curve obtained in ITRM only differs in the values after morning meal, 
not after lunch of dinner. No reason for this diurnal phenomenon is given in the dossier. 
The health outcome measures used in the Phase 3 trials did not demonstrate any difference between 
study arms. It is known that high glucose values may cause tiredness and mood changes in addition to 
thirst,  increased  urination  etc.  Obviously,  the used methods  are  not  sensitive  in  capturing  feelings  of 
wellbeing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/86760/2020  
Page 167/177 
 
 
 
The instructions on administering glucose in the Phase 3 studies included immediately premeal injections 
of  Humalog  and  Ly900014.  Patients  in  the  LY900014+20  group  were  instructed  to  take  the  insulin 
20 minutes after the meal. Hence, there was no comparison to Humalog administered 15 minutes prior, 
which would be the optimal dose regarding the time-action profile of Humalog. In addition, no comparison 
is available for Humalog administered post-meal (apart from one PD-study). 
There was a slight difference in HbA1c in favour of LY900014 in the ITRM study, however, the secondary 
endpoint of superiority in terms of HbA1c was not met. In T2D patients, HbA1c was also similar in both 
groups. These results might be interpreted as an argument against the importance of postprandial control 
to overall glycaemic burden. However, no marked changes in HbA1c can be expected in treat-to-target 
studies. Individual optimisation of insulin treatment, snacking, exercise, etc. affect al study arms and 
attenuate the differences between groups. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
There was no overall difference in the risk of hypoglycaemic events between Humalog and LY900014. 
However, clinically significant differences were seen in the pattern of timing of hypoglycaemic events. 
In T1D (ITRM, MDI regimen), documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (<3.0 mmol/L) rates, adjusted 
per  year,  were  overall  numerically  slightly  higher  for  Humalog  than  LY900014,  whereas  the  rate  was 
overall similar between LY900014+20 and Humalog. The rates for Humalog, LY900014 and LY900014+20 
from randomisation to week 26 (LS Mean) were 7.35, 6.71, and 7.75; all documented hypoglycaemia 
13.48,  12.46,  and  14.24;  non-nocturnal  hypoglycaemia  8.88,  8.13,  and  9.85;  and  nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia 1.75, 1.25, and 1.24, respectively. No difference in overall hypoglycaemia ranges were 
seen with the threshold of ≤3.9 mmol/L, either. 
There were some differences noted in the timing of hypoglycaemic events. In T1D (ITRM), documented 
symptomatic hypoglycaemia rate from baseline to Week 26 (BG<3 mmol/L, adjusted for 1 year, LS Mean) 
in the late post-meal period >4 hours post-meal was lower in the LY900014 group (19.89) compared to 
Humalog  (26.00),  with  ratio  [95%CI]  0.76[0.63,  0.93].  Rates  were  higher  with  the  LY900014+20 
compared to  Humalog  from  2  to  4 hours  post-meal  for  BG  3.0  mmol/L  and lower  with  LY900014+20 
compared to LY900014 during the postprandial period from 1 to 2 hours after meals for BG ≤3.9 mmol/L. 
Overall,  slightly  more  hypoglycaemia  occurred  when  LY900014  was  administered  post-meal  than 
premeal. As a consequence, post-meal administration of LY900014 should not be used routinely, but only 
when necessary e.g. if the carbohydrate consumption during the meal cannot be anticipated. 
In T2D (ITRN), the respective hypoglycaemia (<3.0 mmol/L) rates for Humalog and LY900014 (LS Mean) 
were the following: documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia 1.34 and 2.21, ratio 1.64 [95% CI 1.14, 
2.38]; all documented hypoglycaemia 7.43 and 7.57; non-nocturnal hypoglycaemia 3.20 and 3.92; and 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia 0.53 and 0.68, respectively. Furthermore, hypoglycaemic (<3.9 mmol/L) rates 
(from baseline to Week 26, adjusted for 1 year) were higher with mealtime LY900014 than Humalog in 
the postprandial periods ≤1 (4.71 vs. 2.78, ratio 1.75 [1.09, 2.83]);  ≤2 (7.90 vs. 4.34, ratio 1.82 [1.31, 
2.54]), ≤4 (12.91 vs. 8.39, ratio 1.54 [1.19, 1.99]), and >1 to ≤2 (3.21 vs.1.56, ratio 2.06 [1.37, 3.09]) 
hours  post-meal.  The  difference  in  documented  symptomatic  hypoglycaemic  events  (<3.0  mmol/L) 
results  were  driven  by  hypoglycaemic  events  in  the  postprandial  period.  The  observed  pattern  of 
post-meal  hypoglycaemia  rates  and  incidence,  especially  increase  in  early  post-meal  hypoglycaemia, 
reflects the time-action profile of LY900014 vs. Humalog. A warning is included in the SmPC and PL of the 
faster  action  of  the  insulin  and  consequent  risk  of  earlier  hypoglycaemia  with  LY900014.  It  is 
recommended in the PL that a patient who has often hypoglycaemia or difficulty recognising it should 
discuss this with the doctor.

No  difference  among  treatments  was  seen  in  severe  hypoglycaemia  rates  in  the  MDI  studies.  In  T1D 
(ITRM), the mean rate of severe hypoglycaemia from baseline to Week 26 was 18.48, 17.04, and 21.15 
in the Humalog, LY900014, and LY900014+20 arms, respectively. Incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes 
was 25/442 (5.66%), 25/4521 (5.54%), and 15/329 (4.56%), respectively. In T2D, the mean rate of 
severe hypoglycaemia in Humalog and LY900014 groups was 4.15 and 2.37 and incidence 6/336 (1.78%) 
and 3/336(0.89%), respectively. 
There were more than tenfold more patients in the All LY group, compared with the Humalog group, with 
at least 1 potential treatment-emergent injection site reaction AE using the customized MedDRA search 
(30 [2.7%] and 1 [0.1%]; p<0.0001). None of the events were reported as SAEs. 
The most frequently (≥3 All LY patients) reported SAEs were hypoglycaemia, pneumonia, cellulitis, and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No statistically significant treatment differences were observed, 
and no clinically important differences were observed between patients in the All LY and Humalog groups 
with respect to SAEs. 
The most frequently reported events, and also reported at a statistically significantly higher incidence in 
the  All  LY  group  were:  injection  site  pain  (All  LY,  13  [1.2%],  17  events;  Humalog,  0);  Injection  site 
reaction (All LY, 12 [1.1%], 20 events; Humalog, 1 [0.1%], 1 event). All events were mild or moderate in 
severity. 
At  week  26  in  study  ITRN,  the  double-blind  TEADA-positivity  increased  more  in  T2D  patients  in  the 
LY900014 than in the Humalog arm. This phenomenon was not seen in T1D; on the other hand, a larger 
proportion of T1D patients were ADA positive already at baseline. The proportions of subjects with ADA 
decreased during follow-up. In T1D patients at Week 52, there were more subjects with TEADA in the 
LY900014  group  than  in  the  Humalog  group.  This  difference  disappeared  during  the  safety  follow-up 
period. There were slightly higher levels of antibodies (% binding) in the Humalog arm in T1D and T2D 
patients; the difference was statistically significant in earlier phases of the studies ITRM and ITRN and no 
more present at end of ADA follow-up period of either study.   
ADA positivity may have been linked with local and systemic hypersensitivity reactions, as most of these 
reactions  occurred to  ADA  positive  subjects.  However,  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  ADA  was  not 
important for these reactions, since the overall numbers of patients with ≥1 potential treatment-emergent 
systemic  hypersensitivity  reactions  or  injection  site  reactions  was  similar  in  TEADA-negative  and 
TEADA-positive T1D and T2D patients. However, the great majority of ADA positive patients did not have 
any local irritation. 
In study ITSI, there was no difference between study arms in the primary endpoint, the rate or incidence 
of infusion set failures during the 6-week treatment period. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The  mechanism  behind  the  increased  rate  of  injection  and  infusion  site  reactions  with  LY900014  vs. 
Humalog is not known for certain. The Applicant suggests that the local vasodilatation by treprostinil and 
enhanced permeability by citrate could both be partly responsible for this difference; or these compounds 
could per se cause the irritation. Treprostinil is the active substance in Remodulin that is known to cause 
injection  site  reactions;  and  citrate  has  been  associated  with  injection  site  pain  in  other  injectable 
products.  Overall,  the  injection  site  reactions  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  resolved  without 
sequalae, and only one patient in the Phase 3 studies discontinued study medication due to injection site 
reaction. 
In  contradiction  with  hypoglycaemia  results  obtained  by  SMBG  in  the  ITSI  study  (T1D  patients  using 
insulin pump), CGM results indicated not only lower glycaemic variability but also less hypoglycaemic 
Assessment report

Page 169/177 
 
 
 
events  with  LY90014  administered  preprandially  vs.  Humalog.  Similar  results  were  seen  in  the  CGM 
substudy  of  the  ITRM  (MDI  regimen,  T1D  patients).  If  true,  the  lowering  of  hypoglycaemic  events 
(especially  BG<2.8  mmol/L)  could  be  important  for  T1D  patients  e.g.  in  regard  to  preservation  of 
adrenergic alert symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Even though CGM is a more comprehensive and hence a 
more reliable method for surveillance than SMBG, the clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain. 
No  data  are  available  for  diabetic  subjects  with  advanced  autonomic  neuropathy,  especially 
gastroparesis.  Gastroparesis  is  defined  as  delayed  or  disordered  gastric  emptying  in  the  absence  of 
mechanical  obstruction  (Krishnasamy  et  al  2018).  For  patients  with  delayed  gastric  emptying  a  less 
fast-acting mealtime insulin or later administration of mealtime insulin would probably be advisable to 
avoid early postprandial hypoglycaemia. The Applicant was requested to consider adding a warning on 
this in the SmPC. However, the same risk concerns all mealtime insulins and gastroparesis is not caused 
by insulin. Hence, it is agreed with the Applicant that this warning is not absolutely necessary. 
It is uncertain if the name of the Liumjev KwikPen Junior presentation carries a risk for off-label use in 
paediatric population, since “Junior” might be associated with paediatric patients. The potential risk of 
increased hypoglycaemia in children that may accompany off-label use cannot yet be determined, since 
paediatric  development  is  still  underway  and  only  preliminary  results  are  available.  Therefore,  the 
Applicant has confirmed their commitment on the following:  
The potential for medication errors and off-label use in the paediatric population linked to adverse 
reactions for Liumjev should be monitored, analysed and reported as part of the upcoming PSUSA 
for insulin lispro (covering all formulations for Humalog, Liprolog and (soon) Liumjev). Based on 
the  analysis  of  the  reported  data  as  part  of  the  upcoming  PSUSA,  the  MAH  should  also 
discuss/propose whether further risk minimisation measure(s) are considered necessary at this 
stage. 
3.6.  Effects Table 
The efficacy results in the Effects table are given according to the efficacy estimand analyses, similarly to 
the proposed Product Information. For clinical decisions on insulin doses for the individual patient the 
expected results when the product is in use are most important, i.e., efficacy estimand results instead of 
ITT estimand results, as the latter include also patients who discontinued treatment.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Benefits of LY900045 in the treatment of T1D and T2D were robustly demonstrated as non-inferiority to 
Humalog in the change in HbA1c at 26 weeks was shown. 
Assessment report

The major difference of LY900014 in comparison with Humalog is the time-action profile, which is shifted 
to the left; hence, the glucodynamic effect starts earlier and ends earlier. The other difference observed 
in the trials is increased number of local irritation at injection and infusion sites. 
In T1D patients, a marked improvement in postprandial glycaemia is seen when LY900045 is injected 
prior to meal. In study ITRM, the mean decrease in 2-hour glucose value postprandially was 1.69 mmol/l, 
which can be considered clinically highly relevant. In T2D subjects, the reduction in postprandial 2-hour 
glucose  was  just  below  1  mmol/L.  What  is  the  relevance  of  such  a  decrease  in  postprandial  glucose 
excursion  to  an  individual  patient?  Discrepant  data  are  available  on  the  importance  of  postprandial 
hyperglycaemia as risk factor for diabetic micro- and macrovascular complications. Current treatment 
guidelines from the EASD and ADA recommend targeting postprandial glucose in patients who cannot 
achieve  adequate  overall  glycaemic  control  otherwise.  The  clinical  relevance  of  the  improvement  in 
postprandial  control  in  T2D  is  less  obvious  than  in  T1D.  The  Applicant  was  requested  to  discuss  the 
observed differences in glycaemic control as regards onset of action and duration of action compared to 
Humalog;  however,  the  Applicant  could  not  define  which  patients  with  T1D  and  T2D  are  expected  to 
specifically benefit from the faster onset of action of LY900014 compared with the currently marketed 
insulin  lispro.  In  clinical  practice,  it  is  expected  that  patients  chosen  to  use  LY900014  would  be  the 
individuals with uncontrolled post-meal glucose excursions. 
In ITRM (T1D), fasting glucose (FG) values at week 26 in the MMTT were significantly lower in patients 
administered LY900014 either premeal (6.58 mmol/L) or post-meal (6.40 mmol/L) in comparison with 
Humalog (7.20 mmol/L). These differences in FG were not expected, as the duration effect of the prandial 
insulin prior to evening snack does not extend to following morning. The finding might be speculated to be 
due to lower postprandial excursion after evening snack in the previous evening that is still reflected in the 
morning glucose level. No difference in FG was observed between LY900014 and Humalog groups in T2D 
patients (ITRN). 
One of the measures of glucose variability in the Phase 3 studies was 1,5-AG, which is a known marker of 
postprandial glycaemia. Retrospective analyses from healthcare databases have implicated that 1,5-AG 
could be a predictor of cardiovascular disease and microvascular complications. In T1D patients there was 
a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  1,5AG  in  study  ITRM  in  patients  administered  mealtime 
LY900015  vs.  Humalog;  no  difference  was  noted  in  studies  ITRN  and  ITSI.  However,  the  issue  if 
postprandial glycaemia is an independent risk factor or just part of the risk posed by overall glycaemic 
burden is currently unresolved. According to current treatment guidelines, the main target in treatment of 
hyperglycaemia is to achieve adequate glycaemic control without risk of serious hypoglycaemic events. 
On the other hand, in T1D patients, flattening of glycaemic fluctuation in the way that was demonstrated 
in the ITRM CGM substudy and the ITSI study is expected to increase wellbeing, with less symptoms of 
hyperglycaemia, such as postprandial alertness/ sleepiness, thirst, increased urination or mood changes. 
However,  none  of  the  health  outcome  measures  implemented  in  the  Phase  3  studies  showed  any 
difference  between  treatments;  it  is  clear  that  these  measures  were  not  designed  to  capture  these 
symptoms.  The  ambulatory  glucose  profiles  for  PPG  control  at  baseline  and  at  Week  26  are  very 
convincing evidence of improved and flattened glucose fluctuation curves in type 1 diabetic patients using 
LY900014 preprandially in comparison with Humalog and with postprandial administration of LY900014. 
Preprandial  administration  increased  significantly  the  time  in  target  glucose  and  decreased  time  in 
hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetic subjects. 
Especially T1D patients are in general insulin sensitive, hence, even small differences in insulin action 
may have clinical relevance. Eating habits vary from large amounts of fast carbohydrates to people who 
try to avoid carbohydrates as much as possible. Some patients exercise and cannot wait for several hours 
after  injection  before  they  can  exercise  again.  There  are  several  potential  situations,  where  the 
Assessment report

faster-acting bolus insulin would be more practical for the patient. Hence, LY900014 could be a good 
addition to the insulin treatment armamentarium. 
According to the results, LY900014 should optimally be injected just before meal, and not 20 minutes 
after,  as  part  of  the  antihyperglycaemic  effect  is  lost  when  insulin  is  injected  after  the  postprandial 
glucose  levels  have  already  peaked.  Postprandial  administration  may  additionally  slightly  increase 
hypoglycaemic  events.  Nevertheless,  the  effect  of  LY900015  taken  just  after  meal  resembles  that  of 
Humalog  taken  just  before  meal.  Hence,  LY900014  can  occasionally  be  injected  also  after  meal,  if 
necessary. 
The overall rate of hypoglycaemic events was similar with both insulins in T1D. However, the different 
timing of antihyperglycaemic effect of LY900014 and Humalog caused different timing of hypoglycaemia: 
LY900014 was more prone to increase hypoglycaemia early in postprandial phase and Humalog later on 
in  relation  to  meal.  During  the  CSII  study  ITSI,  more  hypoglycaemic  events  were  observed  in  the 
LY900014 than Humalog arm, except for the continuous glucose monitoring results that showed less time 
in hypoglycaemic range for patients administered LY900014. The CGM results are more comprehensive 
than SMBG results. It is, however, uncertain if the finding of decreased time in hypoglycaemic range with 
LY900014 is clinically relevant.  
In  T2D  patients,  however,  higher  documented  symptomatic  hypoglycaemia  rate  was  observed  in  the 
LY900014  group  compared  to  the  Humalog  group.  The  long-term  clinical  relevance  of  a  faster  acting 
insulin is that the patient needs to be aware of the timing of potential hypoglycaemic episodes. Therefore, 
the  information  is  included  in  the  planned  prescribing  information,  and  patients  with  frequent 
hypoglycaemic events or hypoglycaemia unawareness are encouraged to discuss this with their treating 
physician. 
The observed difference in the timing of hypoglycaemia did not affect the rate of severe hypoglycaemia or 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia in either T1D or T2D patients.  
The  frequency  of  local  reactions  at  injection  and  infusion  site  increased  markedly,  about  10-fold  in 
patients administered LY900014 vs. Humalog. On the other hand, most reactions were mild to moderate 
and  transient,  and  only  one  patient  in  Phase  3  studies  discontinued  treatment  due  to  injection  site 
reaction. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Non-inferiority  of  LY900014  in  overall  glycaemic  control  (as  measured  by  HbA1c)  in  comparison  with 
Humalog  was  demonstrated  in  both  T1D  and  T2D  patients.  The  PK/PD-profile,  efficacy  and  safety  of 
LY900014 has been well characterised, and the benefit-risk is considered currently to be positive. The 
achieved improvement in glycaemic control in the postprandial phase is statistically significant in both 
type 1 and type 2 patients, and has been confirmed by various methods in the clinical trials. The observed 
improvement in post-meal glucose excursion is more prominent in type 1 diabetic subjects; however, the 
decrease in glucose peaks is considered clinically relevant also in at least some type 2 diabetic patients. 
The overall improvement in glycaemia is better defined by continuous glucose monitoring, which has been 
performed for T1D patients and demonstrates a marked improvement in the incremental AUC of glucose 
concentration. The Applicant was requested to discuss the observed differences in glycaemic control as 
regards onset of action and duration of action compared to Humalog: which patients with T1D and T2D 
are  expected  to  specifically  benefit  from  LY900014  given  its  faster  onset  of  action  compared  to  the 
currently approved insulin lispro. The Applicant concluded that the benefit-to-risk is positive in T1D and 
T2D in general. However, it is expected that patients with uncontrolled post-meal hyperglycaemia with 
their current treatment would be candidates for LY900014 in clinical practice.

The  main  target  group  for  this  product  are  T1D  patients,  who  need  insulin  substitution  to  cover  the 
missing basal and postprandial insulin secretion. Most T2D patients have multiple other treatment options 
for postprandial glucose control. As patients needing MDI regimen are a minority among T2D patients, 
LY900014 obviously is not necessary for most T2D patients. However, there are lean T2D patients who 
are not very insulin resistant, and the concepts of T1D and T2D are often overlapping. Furthermore, with 
increasing duration of diabetes, type 2 diabetic patients gradually lose insulin secretion and may need 
multiple-dose insulin regimens. At that stage, LY900014 may be optimal for some T2D patients, too. 
Due  to  different  time-action  profile  of  LY900014  in  comparison  with  Humalog,  more  hypoglycaemic 
events  within  4  hours  from  meal  are  seen  in  some  of  the  trials.  In  T2D,  the  increase  in  postprandial 
hypoglycaemia  with  LY900014  in  comparison  with  Humalog  was  discussed  further  by  the  Applicant. 
Overall the changes in hypoglycaemic patterns caused by LY900014 are mild to moderate and do not pose 
the  patient  in  risk  more  than  other  treatments  with  bolus  insulins.  However,  the  different  timing  of 
maximum effects of LY900014 should be taken in account when a patient is prescribed a faster-acting 
formulation  of  bolus  insulin,  as  the  change  in  insulin  formulation  may  affect  e.g.  need  for  snacking 
between meals, timing of exercise, etc. Local irritation at injection or infusion sites occurred in about 2% 
of patients, which may require the patient to change from one bolus insulin formulation to another in real 
life.  However,  only  one  patient  discontinued  LY900014  in  the  Phase  3  studies  due  to  injection  site 
reaction. 
The 200 U/ml formulation should not be used in insulin pumps or intravenously, due to a risk of dosing 
errors and inadvertent overdose. 
Dosing of LY900014 should occur prior to meal if feasible, as postprandial glucose control and rate of 
hypoglycaemia are more beneficial in preprandial vs. postprandial administration. If preprandial dosing is 
not possible, LY900014 can be injected up to 20 minutes after the meal. 
The Applicant stated a wish to keep the name “Liumjev KwikPen Junior” in accordance with the Humalog 
KwikPen Junior, which also yields insulin in 0.5 unit steps, to avoid confusion in patients switched from 
Humalog  KwikPen  Junior  to  Liumjev  KwikPen  Junior.  Upon  request,  the  Applicant  improved  the 
appearance of the carton and pen device, which was initially not considered compatible with marketing 
authorisation for adults only. It is clearly stated also in the posology of Humalog Junior KwikPen SmPC (as 
within  the  Liumjev  SmPC),  that  “it  is  suitable  for  patients  who  may  benefit  from  finer  insulin  dose 
adjustments”.  In  other  words,  Humalog  KwikPen  junior  is  also  not  specifically  targeted  for  pediatric 
patients, but to all those benefiting from finer dose adjustments. Based on the preliminary data from the 
ongoing  paediatric  development  of  Liumjev,  the  time-action  profile  of  Liumjev  seems  even  faster  in 
children  than  adults.  It  is  so  far  unknown  how  much  and  in  which  way  this  may  affect  incidence  of 
hypoglycaemic events in children. The name “Junior” is deemed to carry a risk of off-label use in the 
paediatric  population  regardless  of  the  proposed  improvements  in  the  carton  design.  Therefore,  the 
Applicant has confirmed their commitment on the following: 
The potential for medication errors and off-label use in the paediatric population linked to adverse 
reactions for Liumjev should be monitored, analysed and reported as part of the upcoming PSUSA 
for insulin lispro (covering all formulations for Humalog, Liprolog and (soon) Liumjev). Based on 
the  analysis  of  the  reported  data  as  part  of  the  upcoming  PSUSA,  the  MAH  should  also 
discuss/propose whether further risk minimisation measure(s) are considered necessary at this 
stage. 
The benefit to risk ratio of Liumjev is considered positive.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Solution for injection (injection)  
Clear dark blue solution with a pH value between 3.0 and 4.5 
Osmolality is usually between 10 and 15 mOsm/kg.  
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Acute symptomatic treatment of medicinal and chemical products-induced methaemoglobinaemia.  
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is indicated in adults, children and adolescents (aged 0 to 
17 years old). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is for administration by a healthcare professional.   
Posology 
Adults  
The usual dose is 1 to 2 mg per kg body weight, i.e. 0.2-0.4 ml per kg body weight, given over a 
period of 5 minutes.  
A repeat dose (1 to 2 mg/kg body weight, i.e. 0.2-0.4 ml/kg body weight) may be given one hour after 
the first dose in cases of persistent or recurrent symptoms or if methaemoglobin levels remain 
significantly higher than the normal clinical range. 
Treatment does not usually exceed one day. 
The maximum recommended cumulative dose for the course of treatment is 7 mg/kg and should not be 
exceeded, since Methylthioninium chloride administered above the maximum dose may cause 
methaemoglobinaemia in susceptible patients.  
In the case of aniline- or dapsone-induced methaemaglobinaemia, the maximum recommended 
cumulative dose for the course of treatment is 4 mg/kg (see section 4.4).  
Too limited data are available to support a continuous infusion dose recommendation.

Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is necessary. 
Renal impairment 
In infants above 3 months, children and adolescents and in adults, the recommended dosage in patient 
with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m2) is 1-2 mg/kg per body weight. If a 1 
mg/kg dose is given, a repeat dose of 1 mg/kg may be given one hour after the first dose in cases of 
persistent or recurrent symptoms or if methaemoglobin levels remain significantly higher than the 
normal clinical range. The maximum recommended cumulative dose for the course of treatment is 
2 mg/kg (see section 5.2). 
In infants above 3 months, children and adolescents and in adults, the recommended dosage in patient 
with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-29 ml/min/1.73 m2) is a single dose of 1 mg/kg per body 
weight. The maximum recommended cumulative dose for the course of treatment is 1 mg/kg. 
Methylthioninium chloride should be used with caution in infants 3 months old or younger and 
newborn infants with moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-59 ml/min/1.73 m2) since there 
is no data available and methylthioninium chloride is predominantly renally eliminated. Lower 
maximum cumulative doses (<0.5 mg/kg body weight) may be considered. 
No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60-89 ml/min/1.73 
m2). 
The safety and efficacy of methylthioninium chloride in patients with end stage renal disease with and 
without dialysis has not yet been established. No data are available. 
Hepatic impairment 
The safety and efficacy of methylthioninium chloride in patients with hepatic impairment has not yet 
been established. 
No data are available. 
Paediatric population 
Infants above 3 months, children and adolescents:  
Same posology as for adults.  
Infants 3 months old or younger and newborn infants:  
The recommended dose is 0.3-0.5 mg/kg body weight, i.e. 0.06 to 0.1 ml/kg body weight, given over a 
period of 5 minutes. 
A repeat dose (0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg body weight, i.e. 0.06-0.1 ml/kg body weight) may be given one hour 
after the first dose in cases of persistent or recurrent symptoms or if methaemoglobin levels remain 
significantly higher than the normal clinical range (see section 4.4 for important safety information). 
Treatment does not usually exceed one day. 
Method of administration  
For intravenous use. 
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is hypotonic and may be diluted in 50 ml glucose 50 mg/ml 
(5%) solution for injection to avoid local pain, in particular in paediatric population. 
It must be injected very slowly over a period of 5 minutes. 
It must not be administered by subcutaneous or intrathecal injection.

For instructions on handling and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 
6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any other thiazine dyes 
Patients with Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) due to the risk of 
haemolytic anaemia 
Patients with nitrite-induced methaemoglobinaemia during treatment of cyanide poisoning 
Patients with methaemoglobinaemia due to chlorate poisoning 
Deficiency in NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) reductase. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue must be injected very slowly over a period of 5 minutes to 
prevent high local concentrations of the compound from producing additional methaemoglobin.  
It imparts a blue-green colour to urine, faeces and a blue colour to skin which may hinder a diagnosis 
of cyanosis. 
In patients with aniline-induced methaemoglobinaemia, repeated doses of methylthioninium chloride 
may be required. Caution should be exercised in the course of treatment with methylthioninium 
chloride as this may exacerbate Heinz body formation and haemolytic anaemia. Lower doses should 
therefore be considered and total cumulative dose should not exceed 4 mg/kg. 
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue can exacerbate dapsone-induced haemolytic anemia because of 
the formation of the dapsone reactive metabolite hydroxylamine which oxidises haemoglobin. It is 
recommended not to exceed a cumulative dose for the course of treatment of 4 mg/kg in patients with 
dapsone-induced methaemoglobinaemia. 
In cases of suspected methaemoglobinaemia, it is advisable to check the oxygen saturation by co-
oximetry when available since pulse oximetry may provide a false estimation of oxygen saturation 
during administration of methylthioninium chloride. 
Anaesthesiologists should be vigilant for methaemoglobinaemia in patients receiving dapsone therapy 
and for BIS (Bispectral Index) interference with Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue administration.  
Electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure should be monitored during and after treatment with 
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue as hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia are potential adverse 
reactions (see section 4.8). 
Failure to respond to methylthioninium chloride suggests cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency, 
glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or sulfhaemoglobinemia. Alternative treatment 
options should be considered. 
Methylthioninium chloride may cause serious or fatal serotonergic syndrome when used in 
combination with serotonergic drugs. Avoid concomitant use of methylthioninium chloride with 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors 
(SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors and opioids (see section 4.5). 
Patients treated with methylthioninium chloride in combination with serotonergic drugs should be 
monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, 
discontinue use of methylthioninium chloride, and initiate supportive treatment. 
Patients with hyperglycaemia or diabetes mellitus  
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If diluted in glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection, methylthioninium chloride must be used 
with caution in patients with hyperglycaemia or diabetes mellitus, as these conditions may be 
exacerbated by the glucose solution. 
Paediatric population 
Extreme caution should be exercised when administering to newborns and infants below the age of 
3 months due to lower concentrations of NADPH-methaemoglobin reductase necessary for reducing 
methaemoglobin to haemoglobin, making these infants more susceptible to methaemoglobinaemia 
produced by high doses of methylthioninium chloride. 
Photosensitivity 
Methylthioninium chloride may cause a cutaneous photosensitivity reaction when exposed to strong 
light sources, such as phototherapy, those found in operating theatres or locally from illuminating 
devices such as pulse oximeters. 
Advise patients to take protective measures against exposure to light, because photosensitivity may 
occur after administration of methylthioninium chloride. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Methylthioninium chloride should be avoided in patients receiving medicinal products that enhance 
serotonergic transmission because of the potential for serious CNS reactions, including potentially 
fatal serotonin syndrome. These include SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), bupropion, 
buspirone, clomipramine, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine. Opioids, for example, tramadol, fentanyl, 
pethidine, and dextromethorphan, may also increase the risk of developing serotonin syndrome, when 
used in combination with methylthioninium chloride. If the intravenous use of methylthioninium 
chloride cannot be avoided in patients treated with serotonergic medicinal products, the lowest 
possible dose should be chosen and the patient observed closely for central nervous system (CNS) 
effects for up to 4 hours after administration (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Methylthioninium chloride is a potent reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (see section 4.4). 
Methylthioninium chloride is an in vitro inducer of CYP1A2. This interaction is not considered 
clinically relevant, since treatment with Methylthioninium chloride does not usually exceed one day. 
In a drug interaction study, a single IV dose of 2 mg/kg Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue did not 
have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (CYP3A4), caffeine 
(CYP1A2), omeprazole (CYP2C19), warfarin (CYP2C9), and dextromethorphan (CYP2D6). 
Methylthioninium chloride is a potent inhibitor of the transporters OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K. 
The clinical consequences of the inhibition are not known. The administration of methylthioninium 
chloride Proveblue has the potential to transiently increase the exposure of drugs primarily cleared by 
renal transport involving the OCT2/MATE pathway, including cimetidine, metformin and acyclovir.  
Methylthioninium chloride is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The clinical consequences are 
considered likely to be minimal due to the transient and single dose use that normally occurs in the 
emergency setting. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of methylthioninium chloride in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, 
e.g. in life-threatening methaemoglobinaemia.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether methylthioninium chloride is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of 
methylthioninium chloride in milk has not been studied in animals. A risk to the suckling child cannot 
be excluded. Based on kinetic data, breast-feeding should be discontinued for up to 8 days after 
treatment with Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue. 
Fertility 
In vitro, methylthioninium chloride has been shown to reduce motility of human sperm in a dose 
dependant manner. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Methylthioninium chloride has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Indeed, 
driving can be affected due to confusional state, dizziness and possibly eye disturbances. 
However, the risk is limited as the medicinal product is intended for acute administration only in 
emergency situations at hospital. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions observed during clinical trials are dizziness, 
paraesthesia, dysgeusia, nausea, skin discoloration, chromaturia, sweating, injection site pain and pain 
in extremity. 
Intravenous injection of methylthioninium chloride has occasionally caused hypotension and cardiac 
arrhythmias, and such disorders might prove fatal on rare occasions. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions listed in the table below occur in adults, children and adolescents (aged 0 to 
17 years old) after intravenous administration. The frequencies are not known (cannot be estimated 
from the available data). When indicated, the frequency is based on a very small sample size.

Adverse reactions are the same as in adults (except hyperbilirubinaemia, reported in infants only). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Individuals without methaemoglobinaemia 
The administration of large intravenous doses (≥ 7 mg/kg) of Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue to 
individuals without methaemoglobinaemia induces nausea and vomiting, chest tightness, chest pain, 
tachycardia, apprehension, severe sweating, tremor, mydriasis, blue-green staining of the urine, blue 
staining of the skin and mucous membranes, abdominal pain, dizziness, paraesthesia, headache, 
confusion, hypertension, mild methaemoglobinaemia (up to 7%) and electrocardiogram changes 
(T wave flattening or inversion). These features resolve generally within 2-12 hours of the injection. 
Individuals with methaemoglobinaemia 
Cumulative doses of Methylthioninium chloride may lead to dyspnoea and tachypnoea, presumably 
related to reduced oxygen availability caused by methaemoglobinaemia, chest pain, tremor, cyanosis 
and haemolytic anaemia. 
Haemolytic anaemia has also been reported in case of severe overdose (20-30 mg/kg) in infants and 
adults with methaemoglobinaemia caused by aniline or chlorates. Haemodialysis may be used in 
patients with severe haemolysis. 
Paediatric population 
Hyperbilirubinaemia has been observed in infants after administration of 20 mg/kg methylthioninium 
chloride. 
Death occurred in 2 infants after administration of 20 mg/kg methylthioninium chloride. Both infants 
had complex medical circumstances and methylthioninium chloride was only partially responsible.  
The patient should be maintained under observation, the methaemoglobin level should be monitored 
and appropriate supportive measures taken as necessary.  
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: All other therapeutic products, antidotes, ATC code: V03AB17 
In vivo, in low concentration, methylthioninium chloride speeds up the conversion of methaemoglobin 
to haemoglobin. 
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue has been observed to stain tissues selectively. Its use in 
parathyroid surgery (not indicated) has induced adverse CNS effects when administered concomitantly 
with serotonergic medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy of methylthioninium chloride for the treatment of methaemoglobinaemia in peadiatric 
population was demonstrated in two retrospective studies and one open randomised clinical trial. Case 
reports of efficacy are also available in literature. 
Please refer to section 4.4 for important safety information.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
After intravenous administration Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is rapidly taken up by the 
tissues. It is also well absorbed by the oral route. The majority of the dose is excreted in the urine, 
usually in the form of leucomethylthioninium chloride. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The mean (SD) terminal half-life of methylthioninium chloride after intravenous administration is 24.7 
(7.2) h.  
After a single 1 mg/kg dose of methylthioninium chloride, AUC0-96h increased by 52%, 116%, and 
192% in subjects with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 60 – 89 ml/min/1.73 m2), 
moderate (eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73m2), and severe (eGFR 15-29 ml/min/1.73m2) renal impairment, 
respectively. Cmax increased by 42%, 34%, and 15% in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe 
renal impairment respectively. The half-life was unchanged in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment. A longer mean half-life of 33 h were reported in subjects with severe renal impairment. 
The AUC0-96h of Azure B after a single 1 mg/kg dose increased by 29%, 94%, and 339% in subjects 
with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 60 – 89 ml/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR 30-
59 ml/min/1.73m2), and severe (eGFR 15-29 ml/min/1.73m2) renal impairment, respectively. Cmax 
increased by 23%, 13%, and 65% in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment 
respectively. 
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is an in vitro inhibitor of P-gp. 
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is not an in vitro substrate for BCRP or OCT2 and is not an in 
vitro inhibitor of BCRP, OAT1 or OAT3. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeated dose toxicity 
One-month repeated dose toxicity in dogs showed no macroscopic toxic effects.  
Adverse reactions, seen at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with possible 
relevance to clinical use were moderate regenerative anaemia associated with increased mean platelet 
count and fibrinogen levels, a minimal increase in mean total bilirubin blood values and an increased 
incidence of moderate urine bilirubin levels. 
Genotoxicity 
Methylthioninium chloride was mutagenic in gene mutation assays in bacteria and mouse lymphoma 
cells but not in vivo mouse micronucleus assay when administered intravenously at 62 mg/kg.  
Carcinogenicity 
Some evidence of carcinogenic activity of methylthioninium chloride has been shown in male mice and 
male rats. An equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity was observed in female mice. No evidence of 
carcinogenic activity was observed in female rats. 
Reproductive Toxicology 
In  vitro,  methylthioninium  chloride  has  been  shown  to  reduce  motility  of  human  sperm  in  a  dose 
dependant manner. It has also been shown to inhibit the growth of cultured two-cell mouse embryos and 
the production of progesterone in cultured human luteal cells. 
In rats and rabbits, teratogenic effects have been reported, with foetal and maternal toxicity. In rats, 
increased resorption rates have been observed.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is and what it is used for  
Methylthioninium chloride (also called methylene blue) belongs to a group of medicines called 
antidotes. 
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue will be given to you or your child (0-17 years old) to treat 
problems with your blood resulting from exposure to some medicines or chemicals that can cause a 
disease called methaemoglobinaemia. 
In methaemoglobinaemia, your blood contains too much methaemoglobin (an abnormal form of 
haemoglobin that is not able to transport oxygen around your body effectively). This medicine will 
help your haemoglobin return to normal and restore the transport of oxygen in the blood. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue     
You must not be given Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue   
- 
- 
if you are allergic to methylthioninium chloride or other thiazine dyes 
if your body does not produce enough of the enzyme G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase)  
if your body does not produce enough of the enzyme NADPH (nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate) reductase 
if your blood disorder has been caused by nitrite during treatment of cyanide poisoning 
if your blood disorder has been caused by chlorate poisoning. 
-  
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue 
- 
if you have moderate or severe renal disease; lower single dose (1 to 2 mg/kg maximum) is 
needed  
if your blood disorder has been caused by a chemical called aniline, which is contained in dyes; 
lower doses may be needed and total cumulative dose should not exceed 4 mg/kg (see section 3 
of this package leaflet) 
if your blood disorder has been caused by a medicine called dapsone (used to treat leprosy and 
other skin conditions); lower doses may be needed and total cumulative dose should not exceed 
4 mg/kg (see section 3) 
- 
- 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
-  
if you suffer from hyperglycaemia or diabetes mellitus, as these conditions may be worsened by 
the glucose solution used for the dilution of the medicine 
your urine and stools may turn a blue-green colour; and skin may possibly turn a blue colour 
when you are treated with Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue. This discolouration is 
expected and will disappear after the treatment has ended  
If any of the above applies to you, please consult your doctor. 
Photosensitivity 
Methylthioninium chloride may cause a photosensitivity reaction in the skin (sunburn-like reaction) 
when exposed to strong light sources, such as light therapy, lights in operating rooms and pulse 
oximeters. 
Protective measures against exposure to light should be taken. 
Monitoring tests 
You will undergo monitoring tests during and after treatment with Methylthioninium chloride 
Proveblue. 
Children 
Special care must be taken with Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue:   
- 
in newborns and infants 3 months old or younger, lower doses are recommended (see section 3 
of this package leaflet). 
Other medicines and Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  
You should not be given methylthioninium chloride at the same time you are taking certain medicines 
to treat depression or anxiety which affect a brain chemical called serotonin. When used in 
combination with these medicines methylthioninium chloride may cause serotonin syndrome, which 
can be potentially life-threatening. Such medicines include: 
• 
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, 
fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline and zimelidine 
bupropion 
buspirone 
clomipramine 
mirtazapine  
venlafaxine  
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Opioids, for example, tramadol, fentanyl, pethidine, and dextromethorphan, may also increase the risk 
of developing serotonin syndrome, when used in combination with methylthioninium chloride. 
However, if the intravenous use of methylthioninium chloride cannot be avoided, you should be 
administered the lowest possible dose and observed closely for up to 4 hours after administration. 
If you have any doubts about whether this medicine should be given to you, consult your doctor. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. 
The use of Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue during pregnancy is not recommended unless it is 
clearly necessary, for example in a life-threatening situation. 
Due to a lack of available data on whether methylthioninium chloride passes into human breast milk, 
breast-feeding should be discontinued for up to 8 days after treatment with this medicine.  
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use any tools or machines as methylthioninium chloride has moderate influence on the 
ability to drive and use machines.  
3. 
How Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is given     
Your doctor will inject this medicine into a vein (intravenously) slowly over a period of 5 minutes.  
Adults, children above 3 months and elderly 
The usual dose is 1 to 2 mg per kilogram of your body weight, i.e. 0.2 to 0.4 ml per kilogram given 
over a period of 5 minutes. A second dose may be given after one hour if required.  
The maximum recommended cumulative dose for the course of treatment is 7 mg/kg.  
If your blood disorder has been caused by aniline or dapsone, total cumulative dose should not exceed 
4 mg/kg (see section 2). 
Usually, treatment should not exceed one day. 
Renal Impairment 
In infants above 3 months, children and adolescents and in adults, the recommended dosage in patient 
with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m2) is 1-2 mg/kg per body weight. If a 
1 mg/kg dose is given, a repeat dose of 1 mg/kg may be given one hour after the first dose in cases of 
persistent or recurrent symptoms or if methaemoglobin levels remain significantly higher than the 
normal clinical range. The maximum recommended cumulative dose for the course of treatment is 
2 mg/kg. 
In infants above 3 months, children and adolescents and in adults, the recommended dosage in patient 
with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-29 ml/min/1.73 m2) is a single dose of 1 mg/kg per body 
weight. The maximum recommended cumulative dose for the course of treatment is 1 mg/kg. 
Methylthioninium chloride should be used with caution in infants 3 months old or younger and 
newborn infants with moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-59 ml/min/1.73 m2) since there 
is no data available and methylthioninium chloride is predominantly renally eliminated. Lower 
maximum cumulative doses (<0.5 mg/kg body weight) may be considered. 
No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60-89 ml/min/1.73 
m2). 
Infants 3 months old or younger  
The recommended dose is 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg body weight, i.e. 0.06 to 0.1 ml/kg, over a period of 
5 minutes.  
A repeat dose (0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg body weight, i.e. 0.06-0.1 ml/kg) may be given after one hour in case 
of persistence or recurrence of symptoms. Usually, treatment should not exceed one day. 
This medicine may be diluted in 50 ml glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection to avoid local 
pain, in particular in children. 
If you are given more Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue than you should

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Preparation for intravenous administration 
Use immediately on opening. Inject very slowly over a period of 5 minutes. 
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is hypotonic and may be diluted in 50 ml glucose 50 mg/ml 
(5%) solution for injection to avoid local pain, in particular in paediatric population. 
It must not be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection because it has been 
demonstrated that chloride reduces the solubility of methylthioninium chloride. 
Additional information on how Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue can be given is provided in 
section 3 of the Package Leaflet. 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

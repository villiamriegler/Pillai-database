Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/44/2010 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/44/2010 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This variation application evaluates the efficacy and safety of Tresiba (insulin degludec [IDeg,]) in 
combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists in subjects with T2DM, inadequately controlled on either OADs 
± basal insulin or OADs ± GLP-1 receptor agonists.  
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) also proposed to update the Risk Management Plan (RMP) to 
remove co-administration of IDeg and GLP-1 receptor agonist as missing information and proposed to 
update the product information accordingly.  
Tresiba (IDeg) is basal insulin developed to cover basal insulin requirements in patients with diabetes 
mellitus from early to late stages of the disease. On 21 January 2013, the European Commission 
approved Tresiba 100 units (U)/mL and 200 U/mL for treatment of adult patients with diabetes mellitus 
(T1DM or T2DM) by once-daily (OD) subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. IDeg has a duration of action 
beyond 42 hours and is characterised by a flat pharmacodynamic action profile. In patients with T2DM, 
IDeg can be administered alone, or in combination with prandial insulin and/or OADs according to the 
approved label. Until now, information on the use of IDeg in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists 
has been missing. 
Victoza (liraglutide) is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, approved in 2009 for treatment of adults with T2DM by 
OD s.c. administration at doses up to 1.8 mg/day. Like other GLP-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide 
stimulates insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and inhibits glucagon secretion when plasma 
glucose (PG) levels are above normal. Liraglutide also reduces body weight and body fat mass through 
mechanisms involving reduced hunger and lowered energy intake. Treatment with liraglutide has been 
shown to be at least as effective as other marketed GLP-1 receptor agonists. 
IDegLira is a new fixed dose combination (FDC) product containing IDeg and liraglutide in a fixed ratio of 
100 U/3.6 mg per mL administered in increments of 1 dose step containing 1 unit of insulin degludec and 
0.036 mg of liraglutide. IDegLira combines the properties of IDeg and liraglutide and is intended for 
improvement of glycaemic control in adults with T2DM via OD s.c. injection. The marketing authorisation 
application (MAA) for IDegLira is currently under assessment. Data from the clinical development 
programme for IDegLira are used as supportive data in this variation application. 
No specific scientific advice has been provided for this submission. 
Data is submitted in order to support a labelling update for the use of Tresiba in combination with GLP-1 
receptor agonists, as well as a parallel labelling update for the use of Victoza in combination with basal 
insulin (EMEA/H/C/1026/II/23). This data consists in a pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction study, between 
degludec and liragutide and 4 phase 3 randomised controlled clinical trials.

2.2.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects  
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
A pharmacokinetic phase 1 interaction study, between degludec (IDeg) and liragutide (Lira), has been 
performed (NN9068-3632). The study was included in the MAA of IDegLira. It was a 4-way randomized 
single-dose cross-over trial in healthy men, comparing the PK of both IDeg and Lira following 
administration of IDeg and Lira separately, simultaneous administration of IDeg and Lira as well as 
administration of IDegLira. The dose tested was 17 U and 0.6 mg for IDeg and Lira, respectively. All 
doses were administered s.c. in the thigh. A 24 hour euglycaemic clamp was applied, and blood sampling 
for PK assessment was performed for 72h for Lira and 96H for IDeg. 
The study included 24 healthy male volunteers aged 22-55 years, who all completed the trial and were 
included in the PK analysis. 
2.2.2.  Results 
Figure 1 shows the plasma concentration-time profiles of IDeg following s.c. administration of just IDeg, 
of simultaneous administration of IDeg and Lira and administration of IDegLira. 
Figure 1 Mean plasma concentration of IDeg versus time following s.c. administration of 17 U 
as just IDeg, as simultaneous administration of IDeg and Lira (17U+0.6 mg) and as IDegLira 
(17U/0.6 mg) 
The relative bioavailability for IDeg following simultaneous administration of IDeg+Lira compared to 
administration of just IDeg was 1.05 (90% CI 1.01-1.09) with respect to AUC and 1.08 (90% CI 0.95-
1.22) for Cmax. 
Figure 2 shows the plasma concentration-time profiles of Lira following s.c. administration of just Lira, of 
simultaneous administration of IDeg and Lira and administration of IDegLira 
The relative bioavailability for Lira following simultaneous administration of IDeg+Lira compared to 
administration of just Lira was 0.99 (90% CI 0.92-1.07) with respect to AUC and 1.03 (90% CI 0.91-
1.16) (Figure 2).

2.2.3.  Discussion 
The study was included in the MAA of IDegLira and has been assessed in the evaluation of IDeg/Lira. It 
was designed as a 4-way, randomized, single-dose, cross-over study. The design and conduct of the 
study are considered adequate. 
The focus of the current Type II variation is generated in three of the study arms, by running a 
comparison of the exposure following simultaneous injection of the two components with the exposure 
following injection of each of the components administered separately. 
No differences were seen in the systemic exposure of IDeg or of Lira if administered as simultaneous 
injections of the two components compared to standalone s.c. injections of the drugs. The 90% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratios, simultaneous injection/standalone injection, of total exposure 
as well as of maximum plasma concentrations, for both IDeg and Lira, were within the intervals 
defined for bioequivalence 0.80-1.25. 
2.3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects

Figure 3 Overview of treatment combinations across trials 
All 4 trials were conducted in subjects with T2DM using a treat-to-target regimen for adjustment of basal 
insulin with the primary objective to evaluate the effect on glycaemic control of combined treatment with 
basal insulin (IDeg or IDet) and liraglutide based on the change in HbA1c from baseline to 26 weeks of 
treatment.

2.3.2.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Pivotal study, Trial 3948 
Trial 3948 was a 26-week, randomised, controlled, open label, multicentre, multinational, parallel, treat-
to-target trial comparing the efficacy and safety of adding liraglutide versus adding IAsp OD with the 
largest meal, to treatment with IDeg + metformin, in subjects with T2DM using a 1:1 randomisation. 
Subjects randomised into Trial 3948 had completed approximately 52+52 weeks of treatment with IDeg 
+ metformin in Trial 3579 and its extension (Trial 3643), with an end of treatment HbA1c ≥ 7.0%, thus 
qualifying for treatment intensification; see Figure 4. Subjects in Trial 3643 were invited to participate in 
Trial 3948 and signed a new informed consent.  
Subjects with an HbA1c <7% at end of Trial 3643 continued treatment with IDeg + metformin (in the 
following referred to as the non-randomised arm) and were followed for another 26 weeks to evaluate 
long-term efficacy and safety of IDeg. No comparisons to the randomised arms were made, and results 
for these subjects are not discussed in detail in this document. 
The trial design for Trial 3948 is shown in Figure 4 below. At the screening visit (V1, which was the same 
day as the follow-up visit for Trial 3643); subjects discontinued treatment with NPH insulin, which was 
administered for basal insulin coverage during the follow-up period for NN1250-3643 in order to reduce 
interference with antibody measurements. During the week between screening and randomisation, 
subjects resumed treatment with IDeg OD + metformin at the doses taken at end of the active treatment 
period in Trial 3643. 
In the liraglutide arm only, the IDeg dose was reduced by 20% at randomisation and was not to be 
increased during the first 6 weeks of the trial, during which the dose of liraglutide was escalated. Subjects 
in the IDeg + IAsp arm initiated treatment with IAsp OD at a dose of 4 U/day at the largest meal. In both 
treatment arms, the IDeg dose was adjusted once weekly using a treat-to-target regimen aimed to 
achieve a pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) value of 4.0−5.0 mmol/L (72−90 mg/dL).

Choice of comparator 
IAsp administered OD with the largest meal was added in the comparator arm, thus enabling a direct 
comparison of two clinically relevant options for treatment intensification (i.e., addition of either GLP-1 or 
bolus insulin). The comparator treatment reflects a common approach in which bolus insulin is added in a 
stepwise fashion to OD basal insulin by one extra injection per day. IAsp was chosen as it is a commonly 
used rapid-acting insulin analogue with a well-known safety and efficacy profile. Metformin was continued 
at stable pre-trial doses in both treatment arms. 
Randomisation and blinding 
Subjects were randomised 1:1 to add either liraglutide or IAsp OD (with the largest meal) to treatment 
with IDeg + metformin. Since the comparator trial products, pen injectors, and treatment regimens were 
inherently different, a double-blind design was not feasible, and the trial was consequently open-labelled. 
Supportive data, Trials 3697, 3912 and 1842 
Design of Trial 3697 
Trial 3697 was a 26-week randomised, controlled, parallel three-arm, open-label, multinational, multi-
centre, treat-to-target trial in subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled [HbA1c level of 7.0−10.0% 
(both inclusive)] with 1−2 OADs (metformin or metformin + pioglitazone); see Figure 5. The trial 
investigated the efficacy and safety of the IDegLira combination product compared to the 
monocomponents IDeg and liraglutide.  
Figure 5 Design of Trial NN9068-3697 
Eligible subjects were randomised in a 2:1:1 manner to receive one of three parallel treatments 
consisting of once daily IDegLira, IDeg or liraglutide, all in combination with metformin or metformin + 
pioglitazone. The starting dose of IDegLira and IDeg was 10 dose steps (10 units IDeg and 0.36 mg 
liraglutide) and 10 units, respectively, followed by a treat-to-target approach with adjustment of doses to 
achieve pre-breakfast SMPG targets of 4.0−5.0 mmol/L (72−90 mg/dL). The maximum dose of IDegLira 
was 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg and 1.8 mg liraglutide). Liraglutide treatment was started at 0.6 
mg/day and subsequently increased by 0.6 mg in weekly dose escalation steps to a maximum dose of 1.8 
mg/day. The trial was followed by a 26-week extension trial to provide evidence of persistence of efficacy 
and safety during long-term exposure. During the extension period subjects continued on the same 
treatment at unchanged dose (liraglutide arm) or dosing regimen (IDeg and IDegLira arms) as in the 
main trial.

Design of Trial 3912 
Trial 3912 was a 26-week parallel two-arm, (1:1) randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, multinational, 
treat-to-target trial in subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled (HbA1c of 7.5-10.0% [both inclusive]) 
on 20-40 units/day of basal insulin and 1-2 OADs (metformin ± sulfonylurea or glinides). Randomisation 
of subjects was stratified by current background treatment: basal insulin + one OAD (metformin) or basal 
insulin + two OADs (metformin + SU or metformin + glinide), to ensure equal distribution of background 
treatment in each of the two arms. 
As the maximum dose of IDegLira and IDeg was similar and the trial products were visually identical, a 
double-blind design was used. 
Use of basal insulin and sulfonylurea/glinides were discontinued at randomisation, and the trial 
investigated the efficacy and safety of the combination product IDegLira compared to IDeg, both added to 
metformin. The starting dose of IDegLira and IDeg was 16 dose steps (16 units IDeg and 0.6 mg 
liraglutide) and 16 units, respectively, and the dose was adjusted using a treat-to-target regimen aiming 
for a pre-breakfast SMPG target of 4.0−5.0 mmol/L (72−90 mg/dL). The maximum allowed dose of IDeg 
was 50 units and hence identical to the maximum dose of IDegLira, enabling an evaluation of the effect of 
the liraglutide component in the combination product; see Figure 6. 
Figure 6 Trial design Trial NN9068-3912 
Supportive liraglutide + IDet combination, Trial 1842 
Design of Trial 1842 
Trial 1842 was a 26-week, randomised, open-label, two-armed, parallel group, multi-centre, multinational 
trial comparing the efficacy of IDet in combination with liraglutide versus liraglutide (both in combination 
with metformin) in subjects with T2DM. The trial included a 12-week run-in period before which 
sulphonylurea treatment was discontinued and during which liraglutide was escalated from 0.6 to 1.8 
mg/day in all subjects.  
Subjects with an HbA1c ≥ 7.0% after the end of the run-in period were randomised in a 1:1 manner to 
continued treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day + metformin only or to add IDet at a dose of 10 U/day, 
followed by once weekly titration to achieve a pre-breakfast target of 4.0-6.0 mmol/L (72-108 mg/dL). 
The randomisation was stratified by sub-study participation (meal-test), previous treatment with 
metformin and metformin + pioglitazone, and baseline HbA1c (≤  8.3% and > 8.3%). 
The trial was followed by a 26-week extension period to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety. 
Intensification of treatment with IDet was offered at Weeks 26 and 38 for subjects with an HbA1c ≥ 8.0% 
in the randomised and non-randomised liraglutide treatment groups. For more details; see Figure 7.

Selection criteria 
IDeg + liraglutide combination, Trial 3948 
Subjects in Trial 3948 were originally found eligible to participate in Trial 3579, which included insulin-
naïve male or female subjects aged ≥ 18 years, with T2DM ≥  6 months, HbA1c 7.0-10.0% (both 
inclusive), body mass index (BMI) ≤ 40.0 kg/m2 and who were treated on metformin monotherapy (1500 
mg/day or maximum tolerated dose [at least 1000 mg/day] according to local label) or metformin in any 
combination with an insulin secretagogue (SU or glinide), dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor, α-
glucosidase-inhibitor (acarbose) with unchanged dosing for at least 3 months prior to screening. All OADs 
other than metformin and DPP IV inhibitors were discontinued at the start of Trial 3579. 
Subjects who completed the first 52 weeks of treatment in the main trial (Trial 3579) were eligible to 
participate in the 52-week extension trial (Trial 3643). 
Subjects treated with IDeg + metformin at completion of Trial 3643 were eligible for participation in Trial 
3948. Subjects with an HbA1c < 7% continued treatment with IDeg + metformin in a nonrandomised 
arm to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of IDeg and are not discussed in detail in this report.

Supportive IDegLira Trials 3697 and 3912 
Trial 3697 included subjects with an HbA1c of 7-10.0% (both inclusive) and a BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2. All 
subjects were naïve to insulin and GLP-1 receptor agonists and continued on their baseline OAD 
treatment (metformin ± pioglitazone) throughout the trial.  
Trial 3912 included subjects on stable basal insulin treatment (20-40 units) and metformin ± one 
additional OAD (SU or glinides) with an HbA1c of 7.5–10.0% (both inclusive) and a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2. 
Basal insulin treatment and all OADs except metformin were discontinued at baseline.

Withdrawal Criteria 
The key withdrawal criteria were set to ensure subject safety and to ensure that subjects were not 
exposed to ineffective therapy for an unacceptable period of time. If the investigator suspected acute 
pancreatitis, all drugs suspected to relate to this condition should be discontinued until confirmatory tests 
had been conducted and appropriate treatment initiated; see Table 5. 
Table 5 Key  withdrawal criteria across trials 
Further rescue criteria were generally not considered relevant, as the vast majority of subjects were 
expected to benefit from intensified treatment. In Trial 3948, subjects inadequately treated on IDeg 
metformin in Trial 3643 added IAsp OD at the main meal to ensure adequate glycaemia control in the 
comparator arm. In Trial 1842, subjects randomised to liraglutide + metformin had the option to intensify 
treatment with IDet during the 26 week extension trial if HbA1c ≥ 8.0%. 
Trial objectives 
Primary objective 
IDeg + liraglutide combination, Trial 3948 
The primary objective of Trial 3948 was to compare the efficacy of adding liraglutide versus IAsp to the 
largest meal to treatment with IDeg + metformin in controlling glycaemia as measured by change from 
baseline in HbA1c. This was done by comparing the difference in change from baseline in HbA1c at end of 
treatment between IDeg + liraglutide and IDeg+IAsp OD, both in combination with metformin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 16/82 
 
  
  
 
 
Supportive Trials 
The primary objective of Trial 3697 was to confirm the efficacy of IDegLira in controlling glycaemia in 
subjects with T2DM by determining whether the effect (change in HbA1c) of IDegLira was non-inferior to 
that of IDeg and superior to that of liraglutide after 26 weeks of treatment. 
The primary objective of Trial 3912 was to confirm superiority of IDegLira vs. IDeg in controlling 
glycaemia in subjects with T2DM. In Trial 3912, the insulin dose in the IDeg treatment arm was limited to 
50 units (i.e., equivalent to the insulin dose administered with the proposed maximum dose of IDegLira) 
in order to specifically assess the contribution of the liraglutide component to glycaemic control with 
IDegLira. 
The primary objective of Trial 1842 was to confirm the efficacy of IDet in combination with liraglutide and 
metformin in controlling glycaemia in subjects with T2DM by determining whether the effect (change in 
HbA1c) of IDet + liraglutide was superior to that of liraglutide, both in combination with metformin, after 
26 weeks of treatment. 
Secondary objectives 
The secondary objectives varied slightly between the trials, but were generally to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of IDeg + liraglutide, IDegLira, or IDet + liraglutide with that of the respective active 
comparators.  
Primary and secondary endpoints 
Primary as well as secondary endpoints for the four trials are listed in Table 6. Overall, the endpoints 
were very similar between the trials. 
Trials 3697 and 1842 both included a 26 week extension period, and a number of efficacy assessments 
and endpoints were repeated after 52 weeks of treatment.

Safety endpoints as part of efficacy evaluation 
Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes 
Episodes of hypoglycaemia were self-reported based on the subjects’ SMPG recordings and symptoms, 
reflecting common clinical practice. 
The categorisation and analyses of hypoglycaemia used in Trial 3948 were identical to those used in the 
clinical phase 3a development programme for IDeg. Statistical analyses were based on treatment 
emergent episodes of confirmed hypoglycaemia (i.e. episodes that were either severe (requiring 
assistance from another person) or where plasma glucose was biochemically confirmed to be <3.1 
mmol/L (56 mg/dL), with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. The two supportive 
IDegLira trials used the same definition for statistical analyses. 
The MAH has historically used the cut-off level of <3.1 mmol/L to define hypoglycaemia rather than the 
American Diabetes Association (ADA) criterion of ≤3.9 mmol/L, because glucose levels below 3.1 mmol/L 
is typically where counter-regulatory mechanisms set in and patients report clinical symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia. Furthermore, a cut-off of < 3.1 mmol/L is sufficiently below the FPG target of 4-5 mmol/L 
used in the IDeg and IDegLira development programmes (and the target of 4-6 mmol/L used in Trial 
NN2211-1842) to avoid a high incidence of borderline hypoglycaemic episodes with plasma glucose 
values marginally below the target. 
In Trial 1842, hypoglycaemic episodes were classified as ‘major’ (identical to severe) and ‘minor’ 
(episodes of hypoglycaemia with or without symptoms with a plasma glucose measurement <3.1 
mmol/L). In Trial 1842, these two categories were not collapsed to represent ‘confirmed hypoglycaemia’ 
but were analysed separately. 
In Trials 3948, 3697 and 3912, hypoglycaemic episodes were considered treatment emergent if the onset 
of the episode was on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than 7 days 
after the last day of randomised treatment. In Trial 1842, events were considered as treatment emergent 
if occurring on or after the first day of treatment and no later than the last day of treatment. 
Hypoglycaemic episodes with an onset between 00:01 and 05:59 (both inclusive) were considered 
nocturnal except in Trial 1842 where no nocturnal period was prespecified. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The following analysis sets were defined in Trial 3948 in accordance with the ICH-E9 guidance. 
Corresponding definitions of FAS and SAS were used in the three supportive trials. 
 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): all randomised subjects. The subjects contributed to the evaluation “as 
randomised”. (In Trial 1842 only subjects with at least one efficacy value after the randomisation visit 
were included in the FAS) 
  Safety Analysis Set (SAS): All subjects that received at least one dose of the investigational product 
or its comparator. Subjects in the safety set contributed to the evaluation “as treated”. 
In all four trials, descriptive statistics and inferential statistics of all efficacy endpoints as well as analyses 
of hypoglycaemia (except for Trial 1842), body weight, and insulin dose were based on the FAS. All 
descriptive statistics of hypoglycaemia and insulin dose were based on the SAS. The robustness of the 
results for the primary endpoint was explored by additional sensitivity analyses including analysis on all 
completers.

General considerations 
Handling of missing data was prespecified in the protocols, and unless otherwise specified missing values 
(including intermittent missing values) were imputed using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) 
method. In previous treat-to-target trials with insulin degludec, LOCF has generally provided results 
similar to those obtained from alternative methods applicable for handling of missing data, such as 
repeated measures models. 
Statistical Methods: 
The continuous endpoints (primary endpoint of change in HbA1c and secondary endpoints pertaining to 
FPG, prandial increment and body weight) were analysed using a pre-specified linear normal model. The 
included factors and covariates varied slightly between trials but as a minimum included treatment, all 
stratification factors and country/region as fixed effects and the relevant baseline values of the response 
as covariates.  
Trial 3948 investigated whether the change in HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment was statistically 
significantly different with IDeg + liraglutide relative to IDeg + IAsp OD at a 5% level. In Trials 3697 and 
3912, non-inferiority and superiority were formulated and tested as one-sided hypotheses at a 2.5% level 
of significance with two-sided 95% confidence intervals. Non-inferiority of IDegLira compared to IDeg was 
confirmed when the 95% confidence interval for the treatment differences for change in HbA1c was 
entirely below 0.3%. Superiority of IDegLira compared to liraglutide was confirmed when the 95% 
confidence interval for the treatment difference for change in HbA1c was entirely below 0%. In Trial 
1842, superiority of IDet + liraglutide was confirmed if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval was 
below 0%. 
As a sensitivity analysis, the primary endpoint was analysed with a linear mixed model where all observed 
HbA1c measurements available post baseline where included. There were minor differences between the 
implementation of this model for the four trials, but as a minimum the model included the factors and 
covariates included in the primary analysis as well as time and treatment by time interaction as fixed 
factors and subject as a random factor. 
Responders (subjects reaching HbA1c < 7% with or without hypoglycaemia and/or weight gain) were 
analysed using a logistic regression model. As for the continuous endpoints the included covariates varied 
slightly between trials, but as a minimum treatment, all stratification factors and region/country were 
included as fixed factors and the corresponding baseline values as covariates. 
Number of hypoglycaemic episodes were analysed using a pre-specified negative binomial regression 
model with a log-link function and the logarithm of the relevant exposure time as offset. 
Also here, the included covariates varied slightly between trials, but as a minimum treatment, all 
stratification factors and region/country were included as fixed factors. For this particular analysis, in Trial 
1842 the model could only be fitted with treatment as factor and the logarithm to the exposure time as 
offset. 
The minor differences in included covariates are unlikely to affect any of the conclusions from the 
different trials. 
In Trial 3697, four confirmatory secondary endpoints were pre-specified in addition to the primary 
endpoint. In order to test superiority of IDegLira vs. IDeg while controlling the Type-1 error rate,the 
Holm-Bonferroni method was used.

2.3.3.  Results 
Subject disposition 
The subject disposition in the four trials is shown in Table 7. The specified reasons for withdrawal 
differed slightly between trials. Thus, in Trial 1842 some subjects were withdrawn due to ‘protocol 
deviation’ or ‘lost to follow-up’, while in the three remaining trials these reasons were included under 
some of the other withdrawal criteria. If a subject chose to withdraw from the trial without any further 
explanation it was recorded as ‘meeting a withdrawal criteria’.  
IDeg + liraglutide combination, Trial 3948 
In total, 419 subjects completing Trial 3643 were screened, and 413 subjects entered Trial 3948. A total 
of 88 and 89 subjects were randomised to IDeg + liraglutide and IDeg + IAsp, respectively, and 236 
(57%) subjects continued treatment with IDeg + metformin in a non-randomised arm. Six (6) subjects 
were considered randomisation failures and were not exposed to liraglutide or IAsp, and another four (4) 
randomised subjects withdrew their informed consent before exposure to liraglutide (N=1) or IAsp (N=3). 
In general, the subject withdrawals occurred evenly throughout the trial period, with no apparent 
clustering of withdrawals at any specific time point during the trial. 
The most common reason for withdrawal in both randomised groups was meeting one or more withdrawal 
criteria: 11 subjects were randomised in error as they did not fulfil the selection criteria, 5 subjects 
withdrew consent, and 1 subject was withdrawn by the investigator. Six (6) randomised subjects were 
withdrawn due to adverse events.

Supportive IDegLira Trials 3697 and 3912 
In Trial 3697, the withdrawal pattern was similar in the IDegLira and IDeg treatment groups, whereas 
more adverse event withdrawals were noted in the liraglutide group. More subjects treated with 
liraglutide withdrew during the first weeks of the trial (Week 1−6) than subjects treated with IDegLira or 
IDeg, reflecting the known (primarily transient) gastrointestinal side effects of liraglutide.  
Assessment report

The main reason for withdrawal in all three groups was meeting one or more withdrawal criteria: 73 
subjects chose to withdraw without providing any further explanation, 56 withdrew due to incompliance 
or safety concerns, and 13 subjects were withdrawn due to continuously high SMPG levels (9 in the 
liraglutide arm). Furthermore, 30 subjects were withdrawn due to ‘other reasons’. This included 17 
subjects randomised in error and 8 subjects withdrawn due to trial site closure. Of the latter, 3 subjects 
from one site were not included in any analysis sets as the resigning investigator did not sign off on the 
patient case books, rendering the data invalid for inclusion in analyses.  
The withdrawal pattern in Trial 3912 was similar between the IDegLira and IDeg treatment groups. The 
most frequent reason for withdrawal in both groups was meeting one or more withdrawal criteria. Of 
these, more subjects in the IDeg group withdrew due to continuous high SMPG compared to the IDegLira 
treatment group. Furthermore, 30 subjects were withdrawn due to ‘other reasons’. This included 15 
subjects withdrawn due to closure of a trial site (excluded from the full analysis set due to compromised 
data integrity) and 15 subjects randomised in error who violated some of the selection criteria (most 
often related to pretrial treatment regimens).  
Supportive liraglutide + IDet combination, Trial 1842 
A total of 60.7% of subjects (N=498) who completed the 12-week run-in phase on liraglutide 1.8 mg/day 
+ metformin achieved adequate glycaemic control (HbA1c < 7%) and continued the trial in the non-
randomised treatment arm. The remaining 39.3% of subjects were randomised to IDet+liraglutide or 
liraglutide 1.8 mg/day (162 and 161 subjects, respectively), both in combination with metformin. 
The withdrawal rate differed between treatments. A higher proportion of subjects were withdrawn in the 
liraglutide arm (21.1%) than in the IDet + liraglutide arm (11.1%). The higher withdrawal rate in the 
liraglutide arm was primarily due to subjects meeting a withdrawal criterion or due to ineffective therapy. 
Demographics and diabetes characteristics 
IDeg + liraglutide combination, Trial 3948 
Subjects in Trial 3948 had all been treated with IDeg + metformin for a period of two years. The 
population consisted of male and female subjects with a mean age of 61.0 years (ranging from 35.5 to 
81.3 years), a mean HbA1c of 7.7% and a mean BMI of 32.2 kg/m2. Approximately one third of subjects 
in both treatment arms were >65 years of age, and 58.2% had a diabetes duration ≥10 years. 
Furthermore, subjects had a BMI ranging from 19.5 to 48.8 kg/m2.  
The trial included subjects from Europe and United States (32.8%), and the majority were White (91.5%) 
and of non-Hispanic/Latino origin (80.2%). The demographics and baseline characteristics were similar 
between the treatment groups apart from a lower proportion of female subjects in the IDeg + liraglutide 
group (28.4% vs. 40.4%), which was also reflected in a higher mean body weight in this treatment arm 
(95.4 kg vs. 91.3 kg). BMI was similar between the two treatment groups. 
Subjects in the IDeg + liraglutide-group also had a slightly longer duration of diabetes (12.9 years) than 
subjects in the IDeg + IAsp group (11.8 years). The demographic, baseline, and diabetes characteristics 
of all subjects in the FAS are summarised descriptively in Table 8 and Table 9. 
The proportion of subjects with diabetes complications at baseline was 29.5% in the IDeg + liraglutide 
group and 25.8% in the IDeg + IAsp group. 
The type and frequency of diabetic complications reported at screening appeared similar between 
treatment groups, with the most frequently reported complications being diabetic neuropathy and diabetic 
retinopathy. In general, the pattern of concomitant illnesses and concomitant medication was 
representative for a population with T2DM, and there were no apparent differences between treatment

groups. Mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment was observed in 18%, 1%, and 0% of subjects, 
respectively. 
All subjects were optimised on metformin prior to entry into Trial 3948, and the mean dose was 
comparable between treatments at 2003 mg/day in the IDeg + liraglutide arm and 2005 mg/day in the 
IDeg + IAsp arm.

Supportive IDegLira Trials 3697 and 3912 
Subjects in Trial 3697 were representative of insulin-naïve subjects with T2DM, with respect to both 
demographic characteristics and other key baseline characteristics; see Table 8 and Table 9. The racial 
distribution reflected the international trial conduct, with 61.9% of subjects being White, 21.7% being 
Asian Indian and 7.4% being Black or African American. A total of 15.1% of subjects were of Hispanic or 
Latino origin. Diabetic neuropathy was reported in 14.3% of subjects at baseline and was the most 
prevalent diabetes complication, while close to 7% had diabetic retinopathy. Mild and moderate renal

function was observed in 14.9% and 1.4% of subjects, respectively. All subjects were on metformin 
therapy at screening, with 17.3% of subjects receiving pioglitazone concomitantly. 
In Trial 3912, the majority of subjects (77.4%) were White, and 16.3% were Asian Indians. A total of 
10.1% were of Hispanic or Latino origin. Baseline characteristics were indicative of a relatively more 
advanced stage of T2DM compared to subjects in Trial 3697 (greater BMI, higher HbA1c and FPG and a 
longer duration of diabetes). Basal insulin dose at screening were equally distributed between treatment 
groups with a mean daily dose varying from 28.1–32.5 units for the IDegLira group and from 28.1–31.3 
units for the IDeg group. The most frequent diabetic complications were neuropathy (reported in 43.7% 
of subjects) and retinopathy (reported by 16.1%). The overall prevalence of complications was 
comparable between treatment groups. Mild and moderate renal function was observed in 10.3% and 
0.5% of subjects, respectively. The proportion of subjects receiving OADs was equally distributed 
between subjects receiving metformin (48.5%) and subjects receiving metformin + SU (49.5%). Only a 
minor proportion of subjects received metformin + glinides (1.5%) or metformin with sulphonylurea or 
glinides (0.5%). 
Supportive liraglutide + IDet combination, Trial 1842 
All subjects were insulin-naïve, and glycaemic control at randomisation, following the 12-week run-in 
period, was similar to that observed in Trial 3948 (Table 8). The majority of subjects were White 
(88.2%), while 4.9% in the IDet+liraglutide arm were Black or African America compared to 10.6% in the 
liraglutide arm. About 15% of subjects were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The most frequent diabetic 
complications were neuropathy and retinopathy (reported by 15.5% and 9.3% of randomised subjects, 
respectively), and the overall prevalence of complications were comparable across treatment groups. 
Approximately 50% of subjects in both treatment arms had been treated with metformin mono-therapy 
prior to the trial, while the other 50% had been treated with metformin in combination with SUs. 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Change in HbA1c 
In Trial 3948, addition of liraglutide to IDeg + metformin resulted in a greater reduction in HbA1c 
compared to addition of IAsp with the largest meal to IDeg + metformin, and addition of liraglutide was 
therefore more effective in improving glycaemic control. This was supported by the results of Trials 3697 
and 3912, where IDegLira resulted in a greater improvement in HbA1c as compared to IDeg or liraglutide 
alone, and by Trial 1842 where addition of IDet to liraglutide resulted in superior glycaemic control 
compared to liraglutide alone. 
The observed mean HbA1c at baseline and end of trial as well as the observed change in mean HbA1c are 
shown in Table 10. Mean baseline HbA1c differed between trials and was lowest in Trial 3948 where 
subjects had been treated for two years on IDeg + metformin and in Trial 1842 where subjects had been 
optimised on liraglutide during a 12 week run-in period (during this period HbA1c decreased from 8.3% at 
screening to 7.6% at randomisation). Importantly, HbA1c at baseline was similar between the active 
treatment group and the comparator group in all four trials.

§Change from baseline (randomisation) to end of treatment (Week 26) based on LOCF 
HbA1c over time is shown for the four trials in Figure 8 below. HbA1c decreased over time in all four 
trials, and the most pronounced reduction was observed within the first 12 weeks of treatment where 
most of the dose adjustments were performed; see Figure 8.

Trial 3948: Screening values are from end of treatment in Trial 3643, while baseline values are from blood samples 
draws at randomisation in Trial 3948. 
The observed mean reduction in HbA1c was larger with IDeg + liraglutide than with IDeg + IAsp in Trial 
3948, larger with IDegLira than with IDeg or liraglutide in Trials 3697 and 3912, and larger with IDet + 
liraglutide than with liraglutide in Trial 1842; see Table 10. These differences were statistically significant 
for all comparisons; see

Table 11. This was supported by the pre-planned sensitivity analyses in the individual trials. Thus, the 
greater reduction in HbA1c observed with IDeg + liraglutide in Trial 3948 was supported by the results 
from the three supportive trials. Based on the non-inferiority and superiority criteria defined for the 
individual trials, treatment with IDegLira was confirmed to be non-inferior to IDeg and superior to 
liraglutide in Trial 3697 and superior to IDeg in Trial 3912. Furthermore, IDet + liraglutide was confirmed 
to be superior to liraglutide in Trial 1842.

The statistically significant improvements in HbA1c observed with IDegLira and IDet + liraglutide after 26 
weeks in Trials 3697 and 1842 were maintained at 52 weeks of treatment; see Section 5 for further 
details. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Subjects reaching HbA1c with or without hypoglycaemia and/or weight gain 
In Trial 3948, the proportion of subjects who achieved the ADA defined HbA1c target of <7% was 
numerically higher with IDeg + liraglutide than with IDeg + IAsp (see 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 26/82 
 
  
  
 
 
Table 12), albeit these proportions were not statistically significant different between the treatment 
arms; see Table 13. 
In Trials 3697 and 3912, which included a considerably larger number of subjects than Trial 3948, the 
proportion of subjects reaching the ADA defined target of <7% was consistently greater with IDegLira 
than with comparator treatments, and a similar pattern was observed for the HbA1c target of ≤ 6.5%. 
Logistic regression analysis showed that the estimated odds of achieving these HbA1c targets after 26 
weeks of treatment were statistically significantly greater for subjects treated with IDegLira than for 
subjects treated with either IDeg or liraglutide (Table 13). 
In line with this, Trial 1842 demonstrated that combined use of IDet and liraglutide could get more 
subjects to target than treatment with liraglutide alone (Table 13). 
Data from Trial 3948 show that the combined use of IDeg and liraglutide can get more subjects to target 
without the unwanted side effects of hypoglycaemia and weight gain compared to treatment with IDeg + 
IAsp OD; see 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 27/82 
 
  
  
Table 12. These findings were supported by the results from the three supportive trials. In Trials 3697 
and 3912, treatment with IDegLira resulted in consistently higher proportions of subjects achieving the 
target HbA1c without hypoglycaemia, without weight gain, and without both hypoglycaemia and weight 
gain, as compared to treatment with IDeg alone. 
A similar consistent benefit on responder endpoints was not observed when comparing IDegLira with 
liraglutide alone in Trial 3697, which reflects the low risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain with 
liraglutide. In trial 1842, more subjects treated with IDet + liraglutide than with liraglutide alone achieved 
an HbA1c < 7% without hypoglycaemia and weight gain; see Table 13.

Responder rates were higher for the combination of IDeg and liraglutide when compared to either IDeg 
and bolus insulin or liraglutide although not statistically significant. Larger differences were observed in 
the supportive studies where the combination was compared to each of the components (basal insulin or 
liraglutide). The difference increased when hypoglycaemias and weight gain was included in the analysis. 
Fasting plasma glucose, FPG  
In Trial 3948, mean FPG was relatively low at baseline compared to the other trials as subjects had been 
treated with IDeg for a period of two years prior to the trial using a treat-to-target regimen. Therefore, 
only marginal additional reductions in FPG were observed in both treatment groups at similar mean daily 
doses of IDeg. This is in line with the results from the pre-breakfast SMPG measurements used for 
adjustment of basal insulin doses, which were similar between treatment arms in Trial 3948. 
Similar results were observed in Trial 3697, where treatment with IDegLira and IDeg resulted in similar 
reductions in FPG, albeit at lower doses of insulin in the IDegLira arm than in the IDeg arm. As expected, 
combined use of basal insulin and liraglutide had a greater effect on FPG than liraglutide alone as shown 
in Trials 3697 and Trial 1842. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 29/82 
 
  
  
 
In general, baseline FPG values were lowest in Trial 3948 where subjects had been treated with IDeg + 
metformin for an extended period of time in the preceding Trials 3579 and 3643 using a treat-to-target 
regimen. In Trial 1842, subjects had been optimised on liraglutide during a 12-week run-in period, while 
subjects in Trial 3697 were insulin-naïve and subjects in Trial 3912 had been treated with basal insulin, 
albeit not in a clinical trial setting. For the trial populations having a relatively high baseline FPG, the most 
pronounced decrease in FPG was observed within the first 12 weeks of treatment. 
The change from baseline in FPG were not statistically significantly different with IDeg + liraglutide and 
IDeg + IAsp OD in Trial 3948, and the same was the case when comparing treatment with IDegLira and 
IDeg in Trial 3697; see Table 14. In contrast, reductions in mean FPG were statistically significantly 
greater with IDegLira and with IDet + liraglutide than with liraglutide alone in Trial 3697 and Trial 1842, 
respectively. Trial 3912 showed the added effect of the liraglutide component on FPG at similar doses of 
IDeg.

9-point SMPG profiles and prandial increments 
IDeg + liraglutide combination, Trial 3948 
No difference in prandial increments or in mean postprandial glucose levels was observed in Trial 3948 
where treatment with IDeg + liraglutide was compared to IDeg + IAsp. The 9-point SMPG profiles were 
similar between the two treatment groups at baseline and decreased in both groups during the course of 
the trial. Nearly all of the subjects treated with IAsp administered bolus insulin before lunch (47.3%) or 
before the main evening meal (47.3%), and this was reflected by a modestly lower SMPG value 90 
minutes post-lunch, post-evening meal and at bedtime in the IDeg + IAsp group as compared to the IDeg 
+ liraglutide group. Consequently, the observed mean prandial increments were slightly higher in the 
IDeg + liraglutide group than in the IDeg + IAsp group at lunch, evening meal, and across all meals. No 
statistically significant differences were observed between treatment groups at specific meals or across all 
meals.  
Supportive IDegLira Trials 3697 and 3912 
In Trial 3697, change in prandial glucose increment was a confirmatory secondary endpoint and was 
included to specifically evaluate to what extent the meal-related glucose levels are reduced by treatment 
intervention. The prandial glucose increment (iAUC0-4h) at baseline and at week 26 was calculated for a 
pre-specified population of 260 subjects undergoing a meal test. The results demonstrated that the 
liraglutide component of IDegLira contributed significantly to postprandial glycaemic control. With very 
similar mean baseline iAUC0-4h across treatment groups (IDegLira: 4.11 mmol/L, IDeg: 4.12 mmol/L, 
and liraglutide: 4.12 mmol/L), iAUC0-4h after 26 weeks of treatment had decreased by 0.87 mmol/L with 
IDegLira, by 0.17 mmol/L with IDeg and by 0.78 mmol/L with liraglutide. The reduction in prandial 
glucose increment was statistically significantly greater with IDegLira than with IDeg (estimated mean 
treatment difference: -0.71 mmol/L [-1.17; -0.26]95% CI), thus confirming superiority for this 
confirmatory secondary endpoint. Results were similar for IDegLira and liraglutide (estimated mean 
Assessment report

Page 30/82 
 
  
  
 
 
treatment difference: -0.09 mmol/L [-0.56; 0.37]95% CI), which provides support for the preserved 
contribution of liraglutide to postprandial glycaemic control when combined with exogenous insulin. 
The results from the meal test corresponded with the results from the 9-point SMPG profiles for the full 
trial population. These indicated improved overall postprandial glycaemic control across all meals with 
IDegLira relative to IDeg after 26 weeks.  
In Trial 3912, the mean prandial increment across all meals based on 9-point SMPG measurements was 
lower with IDegLira (2.2 mmol/L [39.6 mg/dL]) than with IDeg (2.4 mmol/L [43.2 mg/dL]) after 26 
weeks of treatment. This difference was statistically significant, with an estimated treatment difference of 
-0.37 mmol/L [-0.69;-0.04]95%CI. 
Supportive liraglutide + IDet combination, Trial 1842 
Treatment with both IDet + liraglutide and liraglutide alone led to mean decreases in post-prandial 
glucose at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with the greatest decrease consistently observed with IDet + 
liraglutide. The estimated mean decrease in post-prandial glucose was statistically significantly greater 
with IDet+liraglutide compared to liraglutide alone for all meal times (estimated treatment differences of 
-1.12 mmol/L, -0.60 mmol/L and -0.70 mmol/L for breakfast, lunch and dinner, respectively). 
As expected, no statistically significant difference between IDet + liraglutide and liraglutide was observed 
for change in prandial increments at breakfast, lunch or dinner. 
Safety endpoints as part of efficacy evaluation 
Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes 
In Trial 3948 treatment with IDeg + liraglutide resulted in a lower rate of both confirmed and nocturnal 
confirmed hypoglycaemia compared to treatment with IDeg + IAsp OD at the main meal. In Trial 3697, 
IDegLira was also associated with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia compared to IDeg; see Table 15. 
No episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were reported in Trials 3948 and 1842, while a total of four severe 
hypoglycaemic episodes were reported in Trial 3697 (two with IDegLira and two with IDeg) and one 
severe episode was reported with IDegLira in Trial 3912.

#Trial 1842 excluding outlier 
In Trial 3948, both the percentage of subjects who experienced confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes as 
well as the rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes was lower with IDeg + liraglutide than with IDeg + 
IAsp OD; see Table 15. The estimated rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes was statistically 
significantly lower (by 87%) with IDeg + liraglutide compared to IDeg + IAsp OD; see Table 16. This 
finding was supported by the results from Trial 3697 showing a statistically significant 32% relative

reduction in the rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes with IDegLira relative to IDeg. In Trial 3912, 
the rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia was numerically, albeit not statistically significantly, lower with 
IDegLira compared to IDeg (given at a maximum dose of 50 units).  
A statistically significantly lower rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia with liraglutide compared to IDet + 
liraglutide in Trial 1842 was observed; see Table 16. One subject in the liraglutide arm reported a total of 
25 minor hypoglycaemic episodes during the trial and was considered an outlier prior to database lock. 
The statistical analyses were prepared with and without this outlier. When the outlier was included in the 
above analyses, no differences were observed between the treatment groups. 
In Trial 3948, only few episodes of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia were reported with IDeg + 
liraglutide (7) compared to IDeg + IAsp (45), and the benefit of IDeg + liraglutide was also reflected in a 
statistically significant 86% lower estimated rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes (Table 
16). In Trials 3697 and 3912, the rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes was similar 
between IDegLira and IDeg with no statistically significant differences (Table 16).

Figure 9 (evaluation not available for Trial 1842). For Trial 3948, the number of confirmed hypoglycaemic 
episodes per subject appeared similar with IDeg + liraglutide and IDeg + IAsp OD during the first two 
weeks of Trial 3948, while a lower number of episodes were observed with IDeg + liraglutide in the 
remaining part of the trial. A similar pattern was observed for episodes of nocturnal confirmed 
hypoglycaemia. 
Similar results were obtained in Trials 3697 and 3912, i.e., the number of confirmed hypoglycaemic 
episodes was similar between treatment arms during the first weeks of treatment after which the rate 
was reduced with IDegLira relative to IDeg (

Body weight 
The results from Trial 3948 demonstrated that treatment with IDeg + liraglutide resulted in a weight 
reduction of 2.8 kg, while IDeg + IAsp OD was associated with a weight gain of about 1 kg; see Table 17. 
A decrease in weight was also observed with IDegLira compared to IDeg in the supportive Trials 3697 and 
3912. In contrast, the observed reduction in body weight was less with IDegLira compared to liraglutide 
alone in Trial 3697 and with IDet + liraglutide compared to liraglutide in Trial 1842. All of these 
differences were statistically significant as shown in Table 18.

Mean body weight at baseline differed between the treatment arms in Trials 3948 and 3912, while it was 
similar between treatment arms in Trials 3697 and 1842; see Figure 10. The mean body weight 
decreased with IDeg + liraglutide, IDegLira and IDet+ liraglutide in all four trials, with the reduction 
ranging between 0.3 and 2.8 kg. In Trial 3948, the main decrease in the IDeg + liraglutide group was 
observed during the initial part of the trial where the dose of liraglutide was uptitrated. In Trial 1842, a 
mean reduction in body weight of about 3.5 kg was observed during the 12-week run-in prior to 
randomisation.

Dose of insulin and liraglutide 
A ‘treat-to-target’ concept was applied in all four trials, adjusting the dose for each individual subject with 
the aim of achieving identical glycaemic targets between the treatment arms. When comparing the end-of 
trial doses in the four trials it should be kept in mind that subjects in Trials 3948 and 3912 were 
previously insulin-treated, while subjects in Trials 1842 and 3697 were insulin-naïve. This is reflected in 
both the starting doses and the doses at end of treatment.

IDeg + liraglutide combination, Trial 3948 
Metformin dose 
The mean daily dose of metformin was similar between the two treatment arms, being 2003 mg/day in 
the IDeg + liraglutide arm both at baseline and after 26 weeks of treatment compared to 2005 mg/day at 
both time points in the IDeg + IAsp group.  
Insulin dose 
After 26 weeks of treatment, the mean daily dose of IDeg was 62 U (0.65 U/kg) in the IDeg + liraglutide 
arm and 61 U (0.64 U/kg) in the IDeg + IAsp arm with a mean daily dose ratio close to one. 
When considering changes from baseline, the mean daily dose of IDeg in the IDeg + liraglutide group 
after 26 weeks was lower than the dose at randomisation (0.62 versus 0.69 U/kg); see left panel of 
Figure 11. The mean daily dose of IDeg remained relatively stable over 26 weeks of treatment with IDeg 
+ IAsp at around 60-62 units.  
The mean daily dose of IAsp at week 1 was 4 units (0.05 U/kg), which increased gradually to a mean of 
19 units (0.21 U/kg) at Week 26. The distribution of IAsp across meals remained relatively constant 
during the trial. At Week 25, 5.4% of subjects injected IAsp before breakfast, 47.3% before lunch, and 
47.3% before the main evening meal. 
While the mean daily total insulin dose increased slightly over time in the IDeg + liraglutide group, a 
more substantial increase in daily total insulin dose was observed in the IDeg + IAsp OD group. In the 
liraglutide arm only, the IDeg dose was reduced by 20% at randomisation and was not to be increased 
during the first 6 weeks of the trial, during which the dose of liraglutide was escalated. 
This is as expected due to the use of both basal and bolus insulin in the IDeg + IAsp OD group (right 
panel of Figure 11). After 26 weeks of treatment, the mean total daily insulin dose was 62 units (0.65 
U/kg) in the IDeg + liraglutide arm and 79 units (0.84 U/kg) in the IDeg + IAsp arm.

There was a good correspondence between the IDeg dose specified in the titration algorithm, the dose 
prescribed by the investigator, and the actual dose taken by the subject throughout the trial, which 
indicates close adherence to the titration algorithm in both treatment groups. 
Liraglutide dose 
In Trial 3948, liraglutide was initiated at a dose of 0.6 mg/day at randomisation and titrated to 1.2 
mg/day or 1.8 mg/day during the first six weeks of the trial at the discretion of the investigator based on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 37/82 
 
  
  
 
 
pre-breakfast SMPG recordings. Approximately 97% of subjects remained on 1.2 mg/day until Week 6, at 
which point about half of the subjects taking 1.2 mg were transferred to 1.8 mg/day.  
Liraglutide doses remained relatively stable from week 8 and onwards, and after 26 weeks of treatment, 
2 (2.3%) subjects were taking liraglutide 0.6 mg/day, 28 (32.2%) were taking 1.2 mg/day, and 57 
(65.5%) were taking 1.8 mg/day. 
Supportive IDegLira Trials 3697 and 3912 
In Trial 3697, the insulin dose increased steadily during the first part of the trial and levelled off after 
8−12 weeks in both treatment groups. Hereafter, the insulin dose in the IDegLira treatment group 
remained relatively stable, whereas the insulin dose continued to increase in the IDeg treatment group. 
After 26 weeks, the mean daily insulin dose was 38 units with IDegLira and 53 units with IDeg. This 
corresponds to a 28% lower basal insulin dose with IDegLira compared to IDeg. 
The actual daily dose of liraglutide was 1.4 mg/day in the IDegLira group and 1.8 mg/day in the 
liraglutide group after 26 weeks of treatment. 
As expected, the dose distribution in Trial 3912 was skewed towards higher doses at baseline, reflecting 
the trial population of previous basal insulin users. After 26 weeks, the mean daily insulin dose was 45 
units with both IDegLira and IDeg, consistent with the fact that the maximum dose of IDeg in the IDeg 
treatment arm was set to 50 units, i.e., equivalent to the maximum dose of the IDeg component with 
IDegLira. The mean daily dose of 45 units of IDegLira corresponds to 1.62 mg liraglutide. 
Supportive liraglutide + IDet combination, Trial 1842 
In Trial 1842, the mean prescribed daily dose of IDet after 26 weeks was 39.5 units in combination with 
1.8 mg/day of liraglutide. 
Comparison of results in sub-populations 
IDeg + liraglutide combination, Trial 3948 
The potential impact of age and duration of diabetes on the observed treatment differences in HbA1c, 
body weight, and confirmed hypoglycaemia were evaluated in Trial 3948. Overall only small differences 
were observed in Trial 3948 as described below. 
Change in HbA1c was similar in subjects treated with IDeg + liraglutide irrespective of age and duration 
of diabetes. In subjects treated with IDeg + IAsp, subjects >65 years as well as subjects with a duration 
of diabetes ≥ 10 years appeared to have a slightly higher change in HbA1c compared to subjects aged 
18-65 years and subjects with a duration of diabetes <10 years. 
No differences were observed with respect to change in weight between subjects aged ≤  65 and > 65 
years or subjects with a duration of diabetes <10 years and ≥10 years. 
The observed rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia was lower in adult subjects aged 18-65 years than in 
elderly subjects > 65 years (66.8 vs. 157.5 episodes per 100 PYE), and this pattern was observed in both 
treatment arms. In contrast, no difference was observed in the rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia between 
subjects with a diabetes duration < 10 years and ≥ 10 years. The small number of nocturnal confirmed 
hypoglycaemic episodes did not allow a relevant comparison in these sub-populations. 
Supportive IDegLira Trials 3697 and 3912 
The efficacy of IDegLira in sub-populations was assessed through statistical analysis of interaction 
between treatment effect (measured as change from baseline in HbA1c) and a large number of 
intrinsic/extrinsic factors. The analyses were based on individual data from each of the two therapeutic 
confirmatory trials. No consistent and clinically relevant interactions were demonstrated between these 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 38/82 
 
  
  
factors and HbA1c. Specifically, no treatment-by-age or treatment by disease duration interactions was 
observed for IDegLira in relation to HbA1c. 
Furthermore, no such interactions were observed with respect to confirmed hypoglycaemia. No 
interaction analyses were made in relation to body weight. 
Supportive liraglutide + IDet combination, Trial 1842 
The impact of age and diabetes duration on these parameters was not investigated in Trial 1842. 
Analysis of results for dosing 
The doses of IDeg, IAsp and liraglutide used across the clinical trials were in alignment with the dosing 
information in the SmPCs for the marketed products. All trials used a treat-to-target concept. 
Starting dose of IDeg when added to liraglutide 
According to the approved SmPC for Tresiba, subjects with T2DM should initiate treatment with IDeg at a 
dose of 10 units per day followed by individual dosage adjustments. A starting dose of 10 units per day 
was also used in Trial 3697 with IDegLira and in Trial 1842 with IDet. 
So far, no clinical trial has been performed to specifically investigate addition of IDeg to liraglutide, but 
there is no reason to believe that addition of IDeg to liraglutide should be less efficacious or safe than 
addition of IDet as investigated in Trial 1842.  
Dose adjustment of IDeg when adding liraglutide 
In Trial 3948, the dose of IDeg was reduced by 20% at initiation of liraglutide. In this trial, it was not 
recommended to increase the IDeg dose during the first 6 weeks after randomisation where the dose of 
liraglutide was escalated, as it is common medical practice only to change one product dose at any given 
time.  
Initiation and dose escalation of liraglutide 
Treatment with liraglutide may be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. These side effects are 
mostly transient and can be limited if liraglutide is initiated at the lowest dose of 0.6 mg/day according to 
the approved label for Victoza®. After at least one week of treatment, the dose of liraglutide should be 
increased to 1.2 mg/day, which is the approved minimum effective dose. Following at least one week of 
treatment, the dose may be further escalated to 1.8 mg/day if needed. 
In Trial 3948, subjects were only to increase the dose to 1.8 mg/day if mean pre-breakfast SMPG values 
were ≥  5.0 mmol/L (90 mg/dL). 
In Trial 1842, the dose of liraglutide was titrated from 0.6 mg/day to 1.8 mg/day according to the 
approved label during a 12-week run-in phase. During the trial the liraglutide dose was maintained at 1.8 
mg/day in all subjects. 
Persistence of efficacy and/or tolerance effects 
In Trial 3948, HbA1c decreased within the initial 12 weeks and remained stable thereafter; see Figure 8. 
The IDeg dose was reduced by 20% in the IDeg + liraglutide arm at randomisation and was only to be 
increased after 6 weeks of treatment. This was reflected in an increase in the IDeg dose from Week 6 to 
around Week 20, after which the dose stabilised and were identical to the IDeg dose used in the 
IDeg+IAsp arm after 26 weeks; Figure 11. 
A retrospective plot (Figure 12) was made for subjects in the three treatment arms of Trial 3948, showing 
HbA1c development over time during the preceding Trials 3579 and 3643 (weeks 0-52 and 52-104, 
respectively) and during Trial 3948 (weeks 104-134). The total decrease in HbA1c over the total period of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013

134 weeks was approximately -1.4%-points for subjects randomised to IDeg+ liraglutide in Trial 3948 
and -1.04%-points for subjects randomised to IDeg + IAsp. The results show that additional 
improvements in HbA1c can be gained by adding liraglutide to IDeg also when using a sequential 
treatment concept.

randomised Analysis Set 
LOCF imputed data. Error bars ± standard error (mean) 
Trial 3697 including the 26-week extension period provides evidence for persistence of efficacy during 
extended treatment with IDeg and liraglutide, both administered as IDegLira. Sustained good glycaemic 
control as reflected by HbA1c was demonstrated with IDegLira as shown in Figure 13. 
Figure 13 HbA1c (%) by treatment week – FAS (left) and Actual daily insulin dose (U) by 
treatment week – SAS (right) including the 26-week extension period – mean plot - Trial 3697 
Hence, the improvement in overall glycaemic control relative to comparator treatment after the main 26-
week trial period was maintained during extended exposure, with mean HbA1c well below the target level 
of 7%; see Figure 13. This was achieved with stable doses of insulin (mean of 38 U) and liraglutide (1.4 
mg/day); see Figure 13.  
Similarly for the remaining key secondary endpoints of the trial, the treatment benefit of IDegLira relative 
to comparators was maintained during extended exposure for up to 52 weeks. Specifically, the estimated 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 40/82 
 
  
  
  
  
rate ratio of confirmed hypoglycaemia for IDegLira relative to IDeg was 0.63[0.50; 0.79]95% CI for the 
full 52-week trial period versus 0.68 [0.53; 0.87]95% CI for the 26-week period. Results for the 
estimated treatment contrast (IDegLira – IDeg) for change from baseline in body weight was -2.80 kg [-
3.34;-2.27]95% CI for the full 52-week period versus -2.22 kg [-2.64 ; -1.80]95% CI for the 26-week 
period. 
In Trial 1842, the observed mean HbA1c also remained stable with liraglutide + IDet at around 7.2%up 
to 52 weeks of treatment. The mean prescribed dose of IDet was also fairly stable over time and was 
39.5 U at Week 26 and 42 U at Week 52. 
Antibodies 
Insulin antibodies 
While antibodies were not measured in Trial 3948, antibody development has been thoroughly 
investigated as part of the IDeg development programme. The immunogenic response to treatment with 
IDeg was low and did not result in reduced efficacy or a need for increased doses to maintain glycaemic 
control. 
In Trials 3697 and 3912, there was no clinically relevant IDeg-specific antibody development during 
treatment with IDeg or IDegLira for up to 52 weeks (Trial 3697) or 26 weeks (Trial 3912). 
Only very few subjects in either treatment arm (IDeg and IDegLira) developed antibodies cross-reacting 
with human insulin. There was no correlation in either the IDegLira or the IDeg group between antibodies 
cross-reacting to human insulin and HbA1c, change from baseline in HbA1c or total insulin dose at Week 
52. 
Antibody development has been observed with the use of IDet. However, this does not appear to have 
any impact on glycaemic control. In Trial 1842, there was no correlation between change in IDet-specific 
antibody titres and change in HbA1c for subjects treated with IDet + liraglutide, and no correlation was 
observed for cross-reacting antibodies versus change in HbA1c. 
Liraglutide antibodies 
Clinical studies have shown that less than 10% of subjects treated with liraglutide develop antibodies, 
and antibody formation has not been associated with reduced efficacy of liraglutide. 
Anti-liraglutide antibody development was very limited in Trials 3697 and 3912 (< 3%), and none of 
these subjects developed antibodies with cross-reactivity towards native GLP-1. A positive result for in 
vitro neutralising antibodies was found in about 0.5% of the subjects. The effect on HbA1c did not appear 
to be adversely affected in any of the anti-liraglutide antibody positive subjects. 
In Trial 1842, 4 (3.7%) subjects treated with IDet + liraglutide and 2 (2.1%) subjects treated with 
liraglutide were positive for liraglutide antibodies after 52 weeks of treatment. No correlation between 
presence of liraglutide antibodies and change in HbA1c was observed. Furthermore, there was no 
correlation between change in liraglutide antibody titres and change in HbA1c in either of the two 
randomised treatment groups. 
2.3.4.  Discussion 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In support of the current application, the MAH has submitted one pivotal study (3948) and three 
supportive studies (3697, 3912 and 1842). Trials 3697 and 3912 are further the two pivotal studies in 
the MAA for  IDegLira. Trial 1842, where the combination of IDet and liraglutide was investigated, was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013

part of the liraglutide phase 3b programme. This trial has been included as supportive data, as it 
investigated the combined use of basal insulin (IDet) and liraglutide treatment, in the reverse add-on 
sequence (IDet added to Lira) compared to Trial 3948 (Lira added to IDeg). The study is considered to 
mainly contribute with proof-of-concept and safety data for the combination of IDeg and GLP-1 
analogue. Trial 3948 was also included in the MAA for IDegLira as supportive data. 
Data from a clinical phase 1 trial showed no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetic 
properties of IDeg or liraglutide when administered as IDegLira (100 units/3.6 mg per mL) or as free 
IDeg and liraglutide mono-components which justifies the use of studies 3697 and 3912 as supportive 
data in the current application. 
The pivotal study 3948 was generally of adequate design and enrolled patients with T2DM who were in 
need of intensified treatment, i.e. HbA1c > 7 in spite of treatment with IDeg and metformin in the 
context of a two-year treat-to-target study. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate to 
recruit T2DM patients that would be expected to benefit from intensified treatment. Subjects with 
significant concomitant illnesses were excluded. The required pre-trial oral antidiabetic (OAD) dose 
levels were adequate in order to ensure that inadequate glycaemic control at baseline was not caused 
by suboptimal OAD dosing. 
The choice of comparator (insulin aspart, IAsp) per se is acceptable since the addition of bolus insulin 
is an adequate measure if intensified treatment is needed. The MAH has, however, chosen a OD insulin 
aspart regimen in order to add the same number of injections in both groups. This may not be optimal 
since dose escalation can only be made with one meal of the day thereby limiting the possibility to 
exhaust this treatment option. Dose increases will be hindered by the occurrence of (post-prandial) 
hypoglycaemias that could have been avoided by instead adding doses of IAsp to other meals. The 
comparator is acceptable when it comes to a scientific comparison of the outcomes; however, a OD 
bolus insulin regimen may not truly reflect how bolus insulin would be used in the clinic. The 
justification for performing an open label study is accepted by the CHMP. 
Trial 3697 studied the combination of IDeg and liraglutide compared to the two mono-components in 
patients who were naïve to both insulin and GLP-1 analogues. Due to the fixed ratio between the two 
mono-components in IDegLira, the liraglutide doses at start of treatment are lower than when used in 
the free combination. The study design is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Trial 3912 studied the combination of IDeg and liraglutide compared to IDeg in patients on a 
combination of basal insulin and a metformin based OAD therapy. The study was designed to 
investigate the contribution of liraglutide to the effect of the  combination; therefore the IDeg dose was 
not to exceed 50 units. Since the patients included were already on basal insulin, a higher dose of 
IDegLira was given at study start resulting in a liraglutide dose comparable to the starting dose in 
study 3948. The study design is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Trial 1842 studied the efficacy and safety of adding basal insulin IDet to liraglutide plus metformin 
compared to liraglutide and metformin. The overall study design was adequate. Treatments were 
administered open-label and the justification is accepted by the CHMP. 
All studies applied withdrawal criteria to ensure patient safety. Rescue medications were not allowed in 
any of the studies. The objectives of the studies were adequate. The study endpoints were adequate 
and well established. Adequate statistical methods were applied. 
In study 3948, hypoglycaemia was included as a secondary efficacy endpoint. Throughout the studies, 
a cut-off of <3.1 mmol/L was used for the definition of confirmed hypoglycaemia. This is not entirely in 
line with the current EMA Guideline on the development of medicinal products for the treatment of 
diabetes (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev.1) where the ADA  (American Diabetes Association) criteria are 
preferred, however as the same criteria was applied across the studies the definition used is

EMA/CHMP/805141/2013

considered acceptable.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Withdrawal rates were generally low across the four studies. In study 3948, more patients dropped-out 
due to adverse events in the IDeg+Lira group compared to IDeg + IAsp but overall the withdrawal 
rates were balanced. In study 3697 a higher drop-out rate due to AEs was observed in the study arm 
treated with liraglutide. In study 1842 a higher withdrawal rate was observed in the liraglutide treated 
group, mainly related to lack of efficacy.   
The study populations in the pivotal study were not entirely balanced with regards to gender 
distribution and proportion of patients with diabetes duration < 10 years/> 10 years. This may be due 
to the small sample size. However, other baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. The 
study populations in the supportive studies were generally well balanced.  
Differences in baseline characteristics observed between studies can be explained by the different 
populations included, i.e. insulin naïve patients or patients with multiple treatments at inclusion. 
In study 3948, the addition of liraglutide resulted in a clinically relevant reduction of HbA1c of - 0.74 % 
compared to -0.39 % in the IDeg + IAsp arm. Superiority for liraglutide when added to IDeg compared 
to IAsp was shown with a statistically significant difference in HbA1c reduction of -0.32 % (95 % CI; -
0.53, -0.12). Although the primary endpoint was met, the once daily dosing of the comparator IAsp is 
considered suboptimal and thus the difference in treatment effect between the combination IDeg and 
liraglutide versus IDeg and bolus insulin may be somewhat overestimated. The data support the 
addition of GLP-1 analogues to basal insulin as an efficient treatment option. The proportion of patients 
achieving a HbA1c < 7 % was higher for the combination of IDeg and liraglutide (58 %) when 
compared to IDeg and bolus insulin (45 %) although the difference was not statistically significant. The 
difference increased when hypoglycaemias and weight gain was included in the analysis. Furthermore 
the treatment effect on HbA1c is achieved in conjunction with a low risk of hypoglycaemias. A decrease 
in body weight (-2.8 kg) was also observed in the IDeg + liraglutide arm. 
These observations were supported by the findings from studies 3697, 3912 and 1842, where 
comparable reductions in HbA1c in the order of 0.5-1 % were observed with combination therapy 
compared to monotherapy with either basal insulin or liraglutide. Differences in effect size between 
studies can be explained by the populations included in the studies and restrictions laid on the 
possibility to titrate the basal insulin or liraglutide. Responder rates were higher for the combination of 
IDeg and liraglutide when compared to either IDeg or liraglutide. The differences in responder rates 
were larger in the supportive studies where the combination was compared to each of the components 
(basal insulin or liraglutide) than in the pivotal study. In addition, hypoglycaemia rates were 
consistently lower with the combination therapy compared to monotherapy with basal insulin. 
Reduction in body weight was also consistently shown in the combination therapy arms, although not 
as large as in monotherapy with liraglutide. 
The effect on FPG varied across the studies due to the differences in previous treatment and diabetes 
history at inclusion. The data indicate that basal insulin has the most prominent effect on FPG whereas 
liraglutide contributes somewhat less. 
In the pivotal study, no difference in prandial increments or in mean postprandial glucose levels was 
observed. In the supportive studies, a significant effect of liraglutide on these parameters was shown. 
When compared to liraglutide alone, the weight reduction is less prominent with the combination of 
liraglutide and insulin, whereas the combination results in relevant weight reductions compared to 
insulin based therapies. 
The lowest hypoglycaemic rates were observed in the treatment arms where only liraglutide was given.

When liraglutide was given in combination with basal insulin the hypoglycaemia rates increased but 
were still lower than observed in treatment arms with basal or bolus/basal insulin. The difference was 
most prominent in the pivotal study. Even though there is overall no indication of an increased risk of 
hypoglycaemia with IDeg+liraglutide compared to IDeg, there were 3 hypoglycaemia SAEs reported in 
trial 3697(2) and 3912(1). Analysis of these cases did not show any common features in terms of 
medication errors, subject demographics, treatment duration or other parameters that could 
potentially lead to severe hypoglycaemia. 
Subgroup analyses were performed, however, due to the size of the studies these analyses have to be 
interpreted with caution. The only relevant finding was a higher rate of confirmed hypoglycaemias in 
older subjects (> 65 years) in the pivotal study. 
With study 3948, 2.5 year data for patients treated with IDeg is provided. When retrospectively 
regrouped in patients either being responders (HbA1c < 7) or non-responders (HbA1c > 7) at two 
years, it can be seen that the subgroup not able to achieve target starts to deteriorate after about one 
year (also in this controlled clinical trial setting) and that improvement of HbA1c is possible when 
adding either GLP-1 analogues or bolus insulin. 
Data from study 3967 show a maintained effect with stable doses of IDegLira for up to one year, 
whereas insulin doses continued to slowly increase in order to maintain HbA1c. 
The development of antibodies with the respective mono-components has been thoroughly assessed 
within the MAAs of the respective products. Antibody development was not assessed in the pivotal 
study. This is acceptable. There appears to be no increase in liraglutide antibody development when 
used concomitantly with IDeg. 
When liraglutide was given in combination with IDeg, the insulin doses were generally lower than in 
the IDeg treated arms at the end of trial, while achieving lower HbA1c. In the pivotal study, the insulin 
dose was reduced by 20 % as liraglutide therapy was started and the insulin dose was then again 
uptitrated. The insulin dose, however, did not increase to the basal level. In spite of the differences in 
treatment regimens (free combination vs.  combination) the liraglutide doses were comparable in all 
studies at end of trial. 
The data from the pivotal and supportive studies provide strong evidence for the proposed combination 
therapy, when a GLP-1 analogue is added to IDeg. Trial 1842 lend support to the proposed posology 
when adding basal insulin in patients already on liraglutide. In this study, basal insulin IDet was 
administered according to SmPC instructions when introduced in insulin naïve patients already on 
liraglutide treatment. Although this study was performed with at different basal insulin, the 
characteristics of the two insulins are deemed sufficiently similar to allow extrapolation of these data 
from IDet to IDeg.

In addition to the above trial data, blinded safety data from 5 ongoing Novo Nordisk trials combining 
basal insulin with GLP-1 receptor agonists (Table 19) are included.

2.4.2.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Data from Trial NN9068-3632 (a PK phase 1 trial) showed no clinically relevant differences in 
pharmacokinetic properties of IDeg or liraglutide when administered as IDegLira (100 units/3.6 mg per 
mL) or as free IDeg and liraglutide mono-components. This substantiates the use of the data from the 
IDegLira trials 3697 and 3912 as supportive data. Because of the inherent differences in trial design, trial 
populations and objectives between these two IDegLira trials compared to the IDeg Trial 3948, no pooling 
of safety data has been performed across the IDeg and IDegLira trials.

Liraglutide Trial 1842 investigated the efficacy and safety of adding basal insulin (insulin detemir; IDet) 
treatment to liraglutide treatment. This trial has been included as supportive data, as it investigated the 
combined use of basal insulin (IDet) and liraglutide treatment, in the reverse add-on sequence (IDet 
added to Lira) compared to Trial 3948 (Lira added to IDeg). 
Key and supportive trials 
Safety data from the 4 trials included in this report are primarily presented trial-by-trial, however for 
selected events of special interest the 2 IDegLira Trials 3697 and 3912 are pooled. The safety evaluation 
of Trials 3697 and 1842 is based on the full trial period of 52 weeks (26 weeks main trial period + 26 
weeks extension period). These data are only denoted ‘ext’ in the cross-references and in the table and 
figure captions. 
Definitions of safety populations and cut-off dates 
This summary is based on 4 trials for which final clinical trial reports (CTRs) exist; hence, no further cut-
offs for data inclusion was specified in this regard. The cut-off date for the serious adverse events (SAEs) 
from ongoing trials was 15 January 2013. 
Analysis sets 
Two analysis sets will be used for the safety evaluation, as defined below: 
  Safety analysis set (SAS): includes subjects receiving at least one dose of the investigational 
medicinal product or comparators. Subjects in the safety analysis set will contribute to the evaluation 
‘as treated’. 
 
Full analysis set (FAS): all randomised subjects in the trial. The statistical evaluation of the FAS 
followed the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle and subjects contributed to the evaluation “as 
randomised”. In Trial 1842 only subjects with at least one efficacy value after the randomisation visit 
were included in the FAS. 
The descriptive safety data are based on the safety analysis set, although subject disposition and analysis 
of all withdrawals is based on FAS. The statistical analyses of hypoglycaemia are based on the full 
analysis set and are discussed in the Efficacy section of this report. 
Overall extent of exposure 
Exposure 
Completed trials 
IDeg + liraglutide, Trial 3948 
The overall extent of exposure was similar in the IDeg + liraglutide group and in the IDeg + IAsp OD 
group (40.04 vs. 40.50 exposure years; SAS), consistent with the 1:1 randomisation ratio in the trial ( 
Table 20), and the majority of all randomised subjects (approximately 87%) were exposed for 25–28 
weeks. More male subjects (114) than female subjects (59) were randomised; accordingly, greater 
exposure to trial products occurred in male than in female subjects in both randomised treatment groups. 
The exposure by race and ethnicity was approximately equal in the two treatment groups; the majority of 
exposure occurred in White and in non-Hispanic subjects. The proportion of adult (18-65 years) and 
elderly (>65 years) subjects exposed to the trial products was similar between the randomised groups. In 
the IDeg + liraglutide group more subjects had a duration of diabetes of more than 10 years (55) than 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013

less than 10 years (32); in the IDeg +IAsp treatment group the number of subjects with a duration of 
diabetes of more than 10 years and less than 10 years was similar (40 and 46, respectively). The 
exposure to trial products in subjects with a duration of diabetes of more or less than 10 years reflected 
this. The proportion of subjects with a BMI from 25 kg/m2 to >35 kg/m2 was similar between treatment 
groups, and the exposure of subjects with BMI ranging from 25 to >35 kg/m2 was evenly distributed.

= Number of Subjects, SD = Standard Deviation 
Supportive Trials 3697, 3912 and 1842 
In the 2 IDegLira Trials 3697 and 3912, 1024 subjects were exposed to IDegLira, 611 subjects were 
exposed to IDeg and 412 subjects were exposed to liraglutide (Table 21). The number of subjects 
exposed as well as the patient years of exposure (PYE) reflected the duration as well as the 
randomisation in the individual trials. Table 21 shows both the exposure in the main part (first 26 weeks) 
and the main + extension part (52 weeks) of Trial 3697 (randomisation 2:1:1), as well as exposure in 
Trial 3912 (26 weeks, randomisation 1:1). 
The total exposure in PYE to IDegLira was almost 2 times greater than the exposure to IDeg and 
approximately 2.5 times greater than the exposure to liraglutide (liraglutide was only used as comparator 
in Trial 3697).

N = number of subjects; PYE = patient years of exposure (1 PYE = 365.25 days). 
A total of 914 subjects (89.3%) were exposed to IDegLira for at least 6 months (both Trials 3697 and 
3912) and 623 subjects (60.8%) were exposed to IDegLira for at least 12 months (Trial 3697 only). The 
proportion of subjects exposed to trial products was similar across the 3 treatment groups up to 6

months, where after the proportion of subjects decreased and differed across the groups due to the lack 
of exposure from Trial 3912 after 6 months. 
In Trial 1842, 162 subjects were exposed to IDet + liraglutide and 142 subjects exposed to liraglutide in 
the randomised treatment groups (Table 22). The total exposure in PYE was 144.5 PYE in the IDet + 
liraglutide group and 143.6 PYE to liraglutide in the randomised liraglutide treatment group. All subjects 
treated with IDet also received liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin. 
For the 2 randomised treatment groups, the mean duration of treatment was 364 days for liraglutide + 
IDet and 369 days for liraglutide (Table 22).

2.4.3.  Results 
Adverse events 
Summary of adverse events 
The proportion of subjects with AEs with the concomitant treatment of IDeg and liraglutide was higher 
than with the concomitant treatment of IDeg and IAsp, but not different from treatment with liraglutide. 
The combined use of IDeg with liraglutide in Trial 3948 led to a higher rate of adverse events compared 
to IDeg used with IAsp. This was mainly caused by more gastrointestinal AEs (nausea, diarrhoea, 
vomiting) as expected from liraglutide and was also observed in the IDegLira Trials 3697 and 3912 and in 
Trial 1842 (IDet + liraglutide). 
No new types of adverse events were reported for the combined use of IDeg + liraglutide. There was no 
difference in seriousness and severity of AEs between the different groups (

Analysis of adverse events 
The safety evaluation focuses on the data from the 2 randomised groups of Trial 3948 and is supported 
by the safety data from Trials 3697, 3912 and the 2 randomised groups of Trial 1842. Due to differences 
in trial drug, trial designs and regimens, the AE data from the trials have not been pooled across IMPs, 
except for the selected AEs of interest where data have been pooled for the two IDegLira trials. 
Common adverse events 
IDeg + liraglutide, Trial 3948 
In total, 62.4% of all subjects reported 318 events. The observed rate of AEs was 517.0 events per 100 
PYE in the IDeg + liraglutide group and 274.1 events per 100 PYE in the IDeg + IAsp group (
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 50/82 
 
  
  
 
Table 23). 
The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity and were assessed as unlikely related to IDeg, 
liraglutide, IAsp or the device by the investigator. Approximately 29% of AEs in the IDeg + liraglutide 
group were considered possibly or probably related to liraglutide by the investigator. The majority of AEs 
had recovered by the end of the trial. 
The most frequently reported AEs in the IDeg + liraglutide treatment group were nausea (reported by 
20.7% of the subjects), diarrhoea (10.3% of the subjects) and nasopharyngitis (10.3% of the subjects). 
The most frequently reported AE in the IDeg + IAsp treatment group was nasopharyngitis, reported by 
12.8% of the subjects (Table 24). The observed rate of AEs was generally similar between the IDeg + 
liraglutide and IDeg + IAsp treatment groups for most SOCs and PTs, apart from more gastrointestinal 
disorders with IDeg + liraglutide. Differences in rates were also seen in the following system organ 
classes (SOCs) as presented below; however, the differences in rates should be interpreted with caution 
given the low number of events: 
  Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: The observed rate of AEs was 57 events per 100 PYE 
in the IDeg + liraglutide group compared with 32 events per 100 PYE in the IDeg + IAsp treatment 
group (23 versus 13 events, respectively). The most common AEs within this SOC were ‘Pain in 
extremity’ (5 and 1 event reported in IDeg + liraglutide and IDeg + IAsp groups, respectively). 
  General disorders: The observed rate of AEs was 27 events per 100 PYE in the IDeg + liraglutide 
group compared with 7 events per 100 PYE in the IDeg + IAsp treatment group (11 versus 3 events, 
respectively). Injection site reactions were reported in the IDeg + liraglutide group (2 events), both 
were possibly/probably related to liraglutide, whereas no injection site reactions were reported in the 
IDeg + IAsp group. 
  Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: The observed rate of AEs was 25 events per 100 PYE in the 
IDeg + liraglutide group compared with 7 events per 100 PYE in the IDeg + IAsp treatment group (10 
versus 3 events, respectively). Only 1–2 events of the same type were reported in each group, thus 
no clustering was seen within any type of AEs in this SOC. 
 
Investigations: The observed rate of AEs was 40 events per 100 PYE in the IDeg + liraglutide group 
(16 events) compared with 2 events per 100 PYE in the IDeg + IAsp treatment group (1 event). This 
difference is mainly due to a higher number of reports of increased lipase and amylase in the IDeg + 
liraglutide group (7 and 4 reports respectively)

Supportive Trials 3697, 3912 and 1842 
The safety profile for subjects treated with IDeglira or liraglutide + IDet in the supportive Trials 3697, 
3912 and 1842 was similar to the safety profile for the IDeg + liraglutide treatment group of Trial 3948. 
The proportion of subjects with AEs for subjects treated with IDegLira or liraglutide + IDet were within 
the same range as the proportions of subjects with AEs in the IDeg + liraglutide group in Trial 3948: 
70.1% in Trial 3948; 71.2% in Trial 3697; 57.8% in Trial 3912 and 81.0 % in Trial 1842 (

Table 23). The majority of AEs were mild and unlikely related to trial products, but subjects treated with 
a liraglutide component generally had a higher rate of gastrointestinal events than subjects not treated 
with liraglutide. The differences between the trials are described below and are mostly attributed to 
differences between trial designs and populations (primarily stage of diabetes). 
Trial 3697 
In Trial 3697, the rate of AEs with IDegLira (407.9 events per 100 PYE) was similar to IDeg (383.3 events 
per 100 PYE) and lower than with liraglutide (507.3 events per 100 PYE). Most AEs were mild in all 3 
treatment groups and the rate of severe AEs in the IDegLira group (8.4 events per 100 PYE) was similar 
to the IDeg group (7.7 events per 100 PYE) and lower than with the liraglutide (12.9 events per 100 PYE) 
group (
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 53/82 
 
  
  
Table 23). Most AEs were assessed as unlikely to be related to trial product by the investigator in all 3 
treatment groups. The rates of AEs assessed as probably or possibly related to trial product by the 
investigator were higher with IDegLira than with IDeg but lower than with liraglutide in this open-label 
trial. 
AEs reported for at least 5% of subjects during the 52-week treatment period are shown in Table 25. For 
the events ‘nasopharyngitis’ and ’upper respiratory tract infection’, the event rate in the IDegLira group 
was similar to the rates in the IDeg and the liraglutide groups. For all events in the gastrointestinal SOC, 
’lipase increased’ and ‘decreased appetite’, the rate with IDegLira was higher than with IDeg and lower 
than with liraglutide.

Trial 3912 
In Trial 3912, the percentage of subjects reporting AEs was similar for IDegLira (57.8%) and IDeg 
(61.3%) (

Table 23). The rate of AEs in the IDegLira group (398.1 events per 100 PYE) was similar to the rate in 
the IDeg group (355.5 events per 100 PYE). Most AEs were mild or moderate in both treatment groups 
and the rate of severe AEs in the IDegLira group (7.6 events per 100 PYE) was similar to the rate in the 
IDeg group (8.9 events per 100 PYE) (

Table 23). Most AEs were assessed as unlikely to be related to trial product by the investigator in both 
treatment groups. The rates of AEs considered probably or possibly related to trial product by the 
investigator in the IDegLira group were higher than the rates in the IDeg group. 
AEs reported for at least 5% of subjects (in any of the treatment groups) are shown in (Table 26). The 
rate of events of ‘nasopharyngitis’ were lower with IDegLira than IDeg, whereas rates of ‘diarrhoea’, 
‘nausea’, ‘lipase increased’ and ‘headache’ were higher with IDegLira than with IDeg. 
Table 26 Adverse events in >=5% of subjects by system organ class and preferred term -

Trial 1842 
In Trial 1842, the percentage of subjects reporting AEs during the entire trial (run-in to end of trial) was 
similar for the liraglutide group (78.0%) and the IDet + liraglutide group (81.0%) (

Table 23). Most AEs were mild or moderate in both treatment groups and the percentage of subjects 
having severe AEs in the liraglutide group (8.8%) was similar to the IDet + liraglutide group (10.4%). 
Most AEs were assessed as unlikely related to trial product by the investigator in both treatment groups 
with no difference between the treatment groups. 
The most commonly reported adverse events for the entire trial period (including run-in and extension) 
were within the system organ classes ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’ (reported by 46.5% and 47.2% of 
subjects in the liraglutide and IDet + liraglutide group, respectively) and ‘Infections and infestations’ 
(reported by 46.5% and 44.2% of subjects in the liraglutide and IDet + liraglutide group, respectively). 
The most common events in these two SOCs were ‘nasopharyngitis’, ‘nausea’, and ‘diarrhoea’ (

Table 27). No overall treatment group difference with respect to type or frequency of adverse events by 
system organ class was noted for subjects during the trial. Most of the gastrointestinal AEs, including 
those that occurred within the IDet + liraglutide group, are typical of those seen in liraglutide trials.

Deaths 
IDeg + liraglutide, Trial 3948 
No deaths were reported in Trial 3948. 
Supportive Trials 3697, 3912 and 1842 
A total of 4 deaths were reported in the randomised treatment groups of the supportive trials: 2 
treatment-emergent and 1 non treatment-emergent deaths in Trial 3697; all subjects were treated with 
IDegLira, and 1 treatment-emergent death in Trial 1842; the subject was treated with liraglutide. No 
deaths were reported in Trial 3912. A brief description of the 4 deaths is given below. 
  A 49-year-old woman (Trial 3697) in the IDegLira group died due to unknown causes 66 days after 
initiation of the trial product. Medical history included hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and

T2DM. The investigator considered this event unlikely to be related to trial product. The death was 
adjudicated and classified as a cardiovascular death. 
  A 66-year-old woman (Trial 3697) in the IDegLira group was hospitalised 182 days after initiation of 
trial product due to fever, chills, and confusion. Medical history included hypertension, 
hyperlipidaemia, aortic stenosis, prosthetic valve placement, congestive heart failure, and 
hypercholesterolemia. The subject was a smoker. Diagnosis at admission to hospital was urinary tract 
infection with sepsis and mild congestive heart failure (medical history). The patient died of 
cardiopulmonary arrest the day after admission. Both ‘sepsis’ and ‘urinary tract infection’ were severe 
events but considered unlikely related to trial product by the investigator. The death was adjudicated 
and classified as a cardiovascular death. 
  A 47-year-old woman (Trial 3697) in the IDegLira group was fatally wounded in a gunshot attack 295 
days after initiation of trial product and died the same day. The death was adjudicated and not 
confirmed as a cardiovascular death. 
  A 58-year-old man (Trial 1842) treated with liraglutide 1.8 mg, died of metastases to the central 
nervous system and pulmonary mass, approximately 6 months after initiation of trial drug. Medical 
history included hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. No death certificate or autopsy report was 
available. 
In addition, 1 death in Trial 1842 in the non-randomised treatment group was reported: 
  A 79-year-old woman (Trial 1842) died from adenocarcinoma of the gall bladder with liver metastasis. 
The subject was treated with non-randomised liraglutide 1.8 mg.

No deaths were reported in the ongoing Trial 3944 (IDeg), Trial 3917 (liraglutide), Trial 3925 (liraglutide) 
and Trial 3851 (IDegLira) as of 15 January 2013. 
One death was reported in the ongoing IDegLira Trial 3951, as of 15 January 2013. The death is briefly 
described below. 
  A 77-year-old man treated with blinded trial product IDegLira vs. placebo for T2DM, with no medical 
history of neoplasms (e.g., benign neoplasm disease or cancer), but a previous smoker and a history 
of working with asbestos, was hospitalised with dyspnoea. A CT of thorax showed suspicion of left 
pleural mesothelioma with lymph nodules and infiltration of pericardium. No autopsy was performed. 
The ‘malignant pleural mesothelioma’ was confirmed as the cause of death. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs)  
IDeg + liraglutide, Trial 3948 
There were 9 SAEs in the randomised groups of Trial 3948: 4 in the IDeg + liraglutide group and 5 in the 
IDeg + IAsp group, corresponding to a rate of 10 and 12 events per 100 PYE, respectively. All 9 SAEs 
were assessed as unlikely related to trial products and device; 6 SAEs had the outcome ‘recovered’ or 
‘recovered with sequelae’ by the end of the trial, while 3 SAEs had the outcome ‘not recovered’. No 
pattern was observed in the SAEs reported.

Relationship according to investigator tabulated. 
F: female; M: male; N: no; NA: not applicable; Y: yes 
In addition to the 9 SAEs, one non-treatment-emergent SAE (prostate cancer; IDeg + IAsp) was reported 
 a 
40 days after ended treatment.  
Supportive Trials 3697, 3912 and 1842 
The percentage of subjects with SAEs was low for all supportive trials and in the same range as in Trial 
3948. No pattern or clustering of events was observed during the trials, and no preferred terms were 
reported for more than 1% of the subjects. The most frequently reported SAEs were represented in the 
SOCs ‘cardiac disorders’, ‘infections and infestations’ and ‘nervous system disorders’. 
Trial 3697 
In total, 109 SAEs were reported by 84 subjects. The percentage of subjects reporting SAEs during the 
52-week treatment period was 4.6% in the IDegLira group, 5.3% in the IDeg group and 5.8% in the 
liraglutide group. The rate of SAEs with IDegLira (6.7 events per 100 PYE) was similar to the IDeg (8.9 
events per 100 PYE) and the liraglutide (9.3 events per 100 PYE) groups. The rate of SAEs assessed as 
severe were similar between the IDegLira group and the IDeg and liraglutide groups. 
The most frequently reported SAEs in all treatment groups were represented in the SOCs ‘cardiac 
disorders’ (16 events), ‘infections and infestations’ (13 events) and ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ (10 
events). No clustering of types of SAEs was observed, except for events in the SOC ‘gastrointestinal 
disorders’, where all events were reported in the IDegLira and liraglutide groups. No SAE preferred term 
was reported for more than 1% of the subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 61/82 
 
  
  
Most SAEs were considered unlikely related to trial product by the investigator in all 3 treatment groups, 
while 10 events (4 in the IDegLira group, 1 in the IDeg group and 5 in the liraglutide group) were 
considered possibly or probably related to trial product by the investigator in this open-label trial. 
Trial 3912 
In total, 24 SAEs were reported by 18 subjects during this trial. The percentage of subjects reporting 
SAEs was 3.5% in the IDegLira group and 5.5% in the IDeg group, while the rate of SAEs was 12.0 
events per 100 PYE with IDegLira and 14.4 events per 100 PYE with IDeg with no major differences 
between treatment groups. Most of the SAEs in the IDegLira group were of moderate severity and 2 
events were severe, while most of the SAEs in the IDeg group were severe. 
The most frequently reported SAEs in all treatment groups were presented in the SOCs ‘nervous system 
disorders’ (5 events) and ‘cardiac disorders’ (5 events). No clustering could be detected with the low 
number of events. No SAE was reported for more than 1% of subjects. The only preferred terms reported 
for more than 1 subject were ‘acute myocardial infarction’ and ‘pneumonia’; both for 1 subject in each 
group. 
Most SAEs in both treatment groups were assessed as unlikely related to trial product by the investigator, 
while 1 event in each treatment group were considered possibly or probably related to trial product by the 
investigator. 
Trial 1842  
In total, 37 SAEs were reported by 28 subjects in the 2 randomised treatment groups across the entire 
treatment period. The percentage of subjects reporting SAEs was 6.9% in the liraglutide group and 
10.4% in the IDet + liraglutide group. Most SAEs in both treatment groups were assessed as unlikely 
related to trial product by the investigator, while 4 events in the liraglutide group were considered 
possibly or probably related to trial product by the investigator. 
The most frequently reported SAEs in all treatment groups were presented in the SOCs ‘neoplasms 
benign, malignant and unspecified’ (5 events), ‘injury, poisoning and procedural complications’ (4 events) 
and ‘cardiac disorder’ (4 events). No SAE was reported for more than 1% of subjects and with the low 
numbers of events no clustering could be detected, except for events in the SOCs ‘neoplasms benign, 
malignant and unspecified’ and ‘injury, poisoning and procedural complications’ which occurred more 
frequently in the IDet + liraglutide treatment group. 
Ongoing trials 
In the ongoing Trial 3944 with the add-on of IDeg to liraglutide, no treatment-emergent SAEs were 
reported as of 15 January 2013. However, 9 SAEs were reported by 6 subjects either before first trial 
drug or in the run-in period. 
In the ongoing trials with IDegLira (Trials 3851 and 3951), a total of 13 SAEs were reported for 11 
(1.4%) subjects as of 15 January 2013. No PT was reported for more than 1 subject. 
In the ongoing double-blind liraglutide Trial 3917, 5 SAEs were reported for 4 subjects as of 15 January 
2013. One subject was involved in a car accident and had 3 events reported in relation to this, 1 subject 
experienced hyperglycaemia and 1 subject reported a non-treatment-emergent event of ‘arrhythmia’ at 
screening. 
In the ongoing double-blind liraglutide Trial 3925, 11 SAEs were reported for 10 subjects as of 15 January 
2013. Of these, 9 SAEs for 8 (3.1%) subjects were treatment-emergent.

Other significant adverse events 
This section describes AEs leading to withdrawal and AEs leading to dose reduction. 
IDeg + liraglutide, Trial 3948 
Adverse events leading to withdrawal 
A total of 6 (3.5%) subjects in the randomised treatment groups withdrew from the trial due to an AE: 5 
(5.7%) in the IDeg + liraglutide group and 1 (1.2%) in the IDeg + IAsp group (Table 29). 
Five of the 6 AEs that led to withdrawal were classified by the investigator as possibly or probably related 
to treatment. The events (‘vomiting’, ‘lipase increased’, ‘constipation’ and ‘injection site rash’) assessed 
as probably related to liraglutide are known adverse drug reactions of the liraglutide monocomponent. 
The remaining AE which was assessed as unlikely related to trial products by the investigator was 
reported as ‘cellulitis’ (chronic condition) for a subject in the IDeg + liraglutide group.  
Table 29 Adverse events leading to discontinuation by system organ class and preferred term 
– Trial 3948 - safety analysis set 
Adverse events leading to dose reduction in investigational product 
A total of 6 subjects reported AEs leading to a dose reduction during the trial: 5 (5.7%) subjects in the 
IDeg + liraglutide group (7 events) and 1 (1.2%) subject in the IDeg + IAsp group (1 event). The rate of 
AEs leading to dose reduction during the trial was 17 and 2 events per 100 PYE with IDeg + liraglutide 
and IDeg + IAsp, respectively. 
Note, that liraglutide was initiated at 0.6 mg/day and then increased to 1.2 mg/day after 1 week. The 
liraglutide dose was to be maintained at 1.2 mg until Week 5. Then the dose could be increased to 1.8 
mg/day depending on glycaemic control and tolerability. After 26 weeks of treatment, 2 (2.3%) subjects 
were taking liraglutide 0.6 mg/day, 28 (32.2%) were taking 1.2 mg/day and 57 (65.5%) were taking 1.8 
mg/day. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 63/82 
 
  
  
 
In the IDeg + liraglutide group, the following AEs were reported and liraglutide dose was reduced in 
response: ‘diarrhoea’ (both subjects recovered), ‘nausea’ (one subject recovered and one subject not 
recovered), ‘goitre’ (subject not recovered), ‘eructation’ (subject recovered) and ‘dizziness’ (subject 
recovered). 
In the IDeg + IAsp group, one subject reported ‘viral gastroenteritis’ (recovered) and IDeg dose was 
reduced in response. 
In 2 cases where trial product was temporarily withdrawn, the AE was considered possibly or probably 
related to trial product by the investigator: 
 
one subject (IDeg + liraglutide): liraglutide temporarily withdrawn due to injection site reaction 
(‘pruritis’ and ‘rash’) considered by the investigator to have probable relation to liraglutide 
 
one subject (IDeg + liraglutide): liraglutide temporarily withdrawn due to elevated amylase and lipase 
Supportive Trials 3697, 3912 and 1842 
Adverse events leading to withdrawal 
The number and type of adverse events leading to withdrawal in the 3 supportive trials resembled the 
findings from Trial 3948. Up to approximately 5% of subjects in the 3 trials were withdrawn due to AEs. 
Apart from ‘gastrointestinal disorders’, no clustering in type of adverse event withdrawals was observed 
and no treatment group difference was apparent with respect to number of subject withdrawals due to 
adverse events. For ‘gastrointestinal disorders’, the event rate was lowest with IDeg, higher with IDeg or 
IDet + liraglutide and IDegLira, and highest with liraglutide. The subjects recovered from the majority of 
the AEs that led to withdrawal. 
In Trial 3697, a total of 51 (3.1%) subjects out of 1663 randomised subjects were withdrawn due to AEs 
during the entire 52-week trial period: 14 (1.7%) in the IDegLira group, 9 (2.2%) in the IDeg group and 
26 (6.3%) in the liraglutide group. Two (2) of these events were non-treatment-emergent and are not 
included in the table showing treatment-emergent AEs leading to withdrawal (

Table 30 Adverse events leading to withdrawal by system organ class – treatment-emergent - 
Trial 3697 (52 weeks) – safety analysis set 
In Trial 3912, a total of 4 (1.0%) subjects out of 398 randomised subjects were withdrawn from the trial 
due to AEs: 1 (0.5%) subject in the IDegLira group and 3 (1.5%) subjects in the IDeg group (Table 31). 
All AEs leading to withdrawal were considered unlikely related to trial product. 
Table 31 Adverse Events leading to withdrawal by system organ class and preferred term – 
treatment-emergent - Trial 3912 - safety analysis set 
In Trial 1842, 16 subjects withdrew in the trial entire period due to adverse events: 9 (5.7%) subjects in 
the liraglutide group; and 7 (4.3%) subjects treated with IDet + liraglutide (Table 32). Most withdrawals

due to AEs (about 50%) occurred during the 12-week run-in period of the trial where liraglutide was 
titrated - these were mostly due to gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and vomiting). The proportion of 
subjects withdrawing from both the 26-week main period (3.1% across groups) and the 26-week 
extension period (1.2%–1.9%) were relatively low and no treatment group difference was observed. 
Table 32 Adverse events leading to withdrawal by system organ class – treatment-emergent - 
Trial 1842 – safety analysis set 
Adverse events leading to dose reduction 
As in Trial 3948, a small percentage of AEs led to dose reduction in Trials 3697 and 3912 (2.2% and 1.8 
%, respectively). This endpoint was not assessed in Trial 1842. There was a similar pattern of AEs related 
to ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ leading to dose reduction in Trial 3697 as in Trial 3948. In Trial 3912, there 
was no apparent clustering or pattern in the AEs leading to dose reduction, and no apparent difference 
between treatment groups. 
Ongoing trials 
Adverse events leading to withdrawal 
In the ongoing trials, 3 subjects were withdrawn due to SAEs as of 15 January 2013. 
In Trial 3944, 1 subject reported ‘gastroenteritis’ during the run-in period and was withdrawn. 
In Trial 3925, 1 subject reporting ‘acute myocardial infarction’ could not be contacted by the trial staff 
and was withdrawn permanently from the trial. One subject reported ‘brain stem thrombosis’, recovered 
with sequelae and was withdrawn permanently from the trial. 
Analysis of adverse events by organ system or syndrome 
Cardiovascular events 
In all 4 trials, the numbers of MACEs were low and with no apparent difference in the rate of MACE 
reported by subjects treated with the combined used of IDeg and Lira (as a free or  combination) 
compared to subjects treated with IDeg + IAsp or with the IDeg or Lira monocomponents. However, the 
numbers are very small and should be interpreted with caution.

Pancreatitis or suspicion of pancreatitis 
In Trial 3948, 1 SAE of pancreatitis was identified (IDeg +IAsp group) and 6 subjects in the IDeg + 
liraglutide group had reports of elevated amylase and/or lipase levels. In the IDegLira trials, events of 
pancreatitis as confirmed by the event adjudicating committee (EAC) comprised 1 event of acute 
pancreatitis with IDeg (reported 2 months after treatment-emergent period) and 2 events of acute 
pancreatitis with liraglutide (of which one was identified based on increased lipase levels). In Trial 1842, 2 
events of pancreatitis (1 acute and 1 chronic, both SAEs) were reported in the randomised treatment 
groups; both events were in the liraglutide group. 
No events of pancreatitis were identified for subjects receiving IDeg + liraglutide, IDegLira or IDet + 
liraglutide, and it is concluded that there is no evidence pointing to any increased risk of pancreatitis with 
the combined use of IDeg and liraglutide relative to liraglutide. 
Thyroid disease 
In Trial 3948, 3 non-serious thyroid-related AEs for 3 subjects were identified in the IDeg + liraglutide 
group. Two of these events were assessed as unlikely related to IDeg and probably related to liraglutide 
by the investigator, and both of these subjects also had elevated calcitonin levels. None of these events 
were related to thyroid cancer. 
In the IDegLira Trials 3697 and 3912, the rate of thyroid events with IDegLira was low and similar to the 
rate with IDeg and liraglutide. All thyroid events were mild or moderate in severity and were assessed by 
the investigator as unlikely related to trial product. Three events of ‘thyroid neoplasm’ (2 with IDegLira 
and 1 with liraglutide) were sent for adjudication (as neoplasms); none of the events were confirmed as 
neoplasms by the EAC. A single thyroid event of goitre leading to thyroidectomy in the liraglutide group 
was adjudicated as a non-neoplasm event. No medullary thyroid cancer events were reported. In Trial 
1842, no events of thyroid cancer or thyroid neoplasm were reported in the randomised treatment 
groups. 
The results from these trials do not suggest an increased risk of thyroid disease compared to liraglutide or 
IDeg when administering IDeg in combination with liraglutide. 
Neoplasms 
The overall rates of neoplasms reported in the IDeg + liraglutide and IDegLira treatment groups were low 
and similar to those reported in the comparator groups. The rates of malignant neoplasms were similar 
between IDeg + liraglutide and IDeg + IAsp and between IDegLira and IDeg. In Trial 1842, there was no 
clinically relevant difference between the proportion of subjects reporting neoplasm events in the IDet + 
liraglutide group (4.9%) and the pooled liraglutide groups (randomised and non-randomised) (3.2%). 
Allergic reactions 
Few events of allergic reactions were reported for the main Trial 3948 and the supportive Trials 3697 and 
3912, and there was no difference among treatment groups. The majority of the events were not related 
to the trial products. 
Gastrointestinal events 
In Trial 3948, the rates of gastrointestinal events were higher with IDeg + liraglutide than with IDeg + 
IAsp OD. A similar pattern was seen for the IDegLira trials, with higher rates of gastrointestinal AEs with 
IDegLira than with IDeg. In Trial 1842, a similar percentage of subjects reported gastrointestinal 
disorders in the IDet + liraglutide group and the liraglutide group in the entire trial period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 68/82 
 
  
  
In all 4 trials, most gastrointestinal events were mild or moderate in severity and, as expected, the most 
frequently reported gastrointestinal events were ‘nausea’, ‘diarrhoea’ and ‘vomiting’. Most gastrointestinal 
events occurred shortly after initiation of liraglutide, were transient and diminished over time. 
Medication errors 
Few AEs of medication errors were reported in all 4 clinical trials. All events were of mild or moderate 
severity, none were severe and all subjects recovered. 
Hypoglycaemic Episodes 
No episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were reported in Trial 3948 and no episodes of major 
hypoglycaemia were reported in Trial 1842. A total of 8 episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were reported 
in the two IDegLira trials. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations   
Most subjects had normal haematology, biochemistry, lipid, and other laboratory value (including 
amylase, lipase, calcitonin and calcium) levels during the trials. Very few subjects had changes from 
normal to high or low values during the trials.  
Vital signs 
Completed trials 
IDeg + liraglutide, Trial 3948 
Vital signs were similar between the IDeg + liraglutide and IDeg + IAsp treatment groups at baseline 
(Week 0) and after 26 weeks of treatment. In the IDeg + liraglutide group, mean blood pressure 
(SBP/DBP) and pulse were 133/78 mmHg and 73 beats/min at baseline, and 130/78 mmHg and 76 
beats/min after 26 weeks of treatment. In the IDeg + IAsp group, mean blood pressure (SBP/DBP) and 
pulse were 129/77 mmHg and 74 beats/min at baseline, and 130/78 mmHg and 74 beats/min after 26 
weeks of treatment.  
The small increase in pulse from baseline to end of trial in the IDeg + liraglutide group was similar to 
what has been observed with IDegLira and IDet + liraglutide. 
Analyses of DBP and SBP after 26 weeks of treatment demonstrated that there was no observed 
difference between treatment groups. A similar proportion of subjects in both treatment groups has DBP 
< 80 mmHg and SBP < 130 mmHg at the end of the trial.  
Supportive Trials 3697, 3912 and 1842 
Both in Trials 3697ext and 3912, there was a statistically significantly greater reduction in systolic blood 
pressure with IDegLira compared to IDeg. The estimated treatment difference was -1.54 in Trial 3697ext 
and -3.71 in Trial 3912. There was no difference in diastolic blood pressure between treatment groups. 
Also in Trials 3697 and 3912, an increase in pulse of approximately 2.5−3.0 beats/min was noted with 
IDegLira and liraglutide (only Trial 3697) after 26 weeks of treatment. The increase had diminished to 
approximately 1.5−2.0 beats/min above the baseline level after 52 weeks of treatment and is considered 
of minor clinical relevance. A slight increase in pulse is a known effect with liraglutide. Similarly, in Trial 
3912, there was an statistically significant increase in pulse with IDegLira (mean change 2.5 beats/min) 
from baseline to Week 26, whereas the pulse did not seem to change from baseline to Week 26 with 
IDeg. 
In Trial 1842ext, mean pulse increased from approximately 73 beats pr. min at the run-in period, to 
approximately 79 beats pr. min at randomisation in both randomised treatment groups, but decreased to 
approximately 76 beats pr. min thereafter. No change was observed from Week 26 to Week 52 for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 69/82 
 
  
  
two randomised treatment groups. Blood pressure was assessed in Trial 1842 as an efficacy parameter. 
The estimated mean changes in systolic blood pressure from randomisation to Week 52 were +0.16 
mmHg for subjects treated in the randomised IDet + liraglutide group and -0.74 for subjects treated in 
the randomised liraglutide group. Similarly, estimated mean change in diastolic blood pressure from 
randomisation to Week 52 were +0.05 mmHg for subjects treated with IDet + liraglutide and -0.74 for 
subjects treated with liraglutide. There was no difference between the 2 treatment groups for either 
systolic or diastolic blood pressure and the results did not indicate any safety concerns. 
Safety in special groups and situations 
Adverse events by intrinsic factors 
Adverse events by age 
IDeg + liraglutide, Trial 3948 
About one third of the subjects included in the trial were elderly subjects (> 65 years): 36.8% of the 
subjects in the IDeg + liraglutide group and 33.7% in the IDeg + IAsp OD group (Table 33). There was 
no indication of a higher rate of AEs in elderly subjects compared to adult subjects treated with IDeg + 
liraglutide. The rate of AEs seemed higher for adult subjects, although the number of elderly subjects was 
low and hence a direct comparison between the age groups should be done with caution. Among the 
elderly subjects, the proportion of subjects with AEs was similar for the IDeg + liraglutide and IDeg + 
IAsp OD treatment groups, but the rates was slightly higher in the IDeg + liraglutide treatment group 
(Table 33). 
The difference between treatment groups in the adult group was mainly driven by an increased number of 
gastrointestinal disorders, and AEs of increased lipase and amylase. Also in the elderly group, the rate 
and proportions of subjects with gastrointestinal disorders was higher for subjects treated with IDeg + 
liraglutide than for subjects treated in the IDeg + IAsp OD group. 
A review of the reported AEs did not identify any clinically relevant differences across the different age 
groups treated with IDeg + liraglutide and it was concluded that there was no clinically relevant 
treatment-by-age interactions for IDeg + liraglutide.

The potential impact of age on the rate of AEs was investigated in Trials 3697 and 3912. As in Trial 3948, 
no impact of age on adverse event rates was apparent. The percentages of subjects reporting AEs was 
similar for adults (18–65 years) and elderly (> 65 years) subjects in both trials. 
No information is available for Trial 1842. 
Post-Marketing Data 
Summary 
Based on the spontaneous AEs reported with the combined use of liraglutide (Victoza) and insulin 
products, there is no apparent change in the AE profile for Victoza when used in combination with insulin 
compared to using the products separately. 
Tresiba 
Tresiba (insulin degludec) received the first marketing authorisation in Japan on 28 September 2012. The 
Mexican approval was issued on 18 December 2012. Furthermore, Tresiba was approved for use in 
Europe on 21 Jan 2013 and became commercially available in United Kingdom the 28 January 2013, in 
Denmark the 4 March 2013 and in Japan the 7 March 2013. Therefore limited post-market data exists. 
The first Tresiba Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) was submitted in June 2013. 
The clinical trial safety data for Tresiba remain in accordance with the cumulative experience as described 
in the current safety reference information (Investigator’s brochure (IB)). No new significant safety 
concerns have been identified in connection with the administration of Tresiba in clinical trials. Tresiba 
however has only recently been introduced on the market and only limited data are available. 
Victoza 
The GLP-1 receptor agonist Victoza was approved for use in Europe in June 2009 and became 
commercially available in Europe in July 2009. 
A crude estimate of the total exposure during the reporting period 31 December 2011 – June 2012 was 
469,694 patient years of exposure (PYE). The cumulative exposure since June 2009 to 30 December 2012 
was 1,296,080 PYE11. 
In the post-marketing period the MAH has received 18,592 adverse reaction reports containing 38,614 
events. These were reports from all sources other than interventional clinical trials. Therefore it contains 
reports from spontaneous sources, literature, health authorities and patient support programs. A majority 
of the reports are related to the MedDRA SOC ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ (36%) followed by ‘general 
disorders and administration site conditions’ (20%) and ‘investigations’ (14%). 
Since the approval of Victoza and based on post-marketing experience, Section 4.8 of the Company Core 
Data Sheet (CCDS) has been up-dated with the following terms: ‘urticaria’, ‘dehydration’, ‘renal failure 
acute’, ‘renal impairment’, ‘malaise’, ‘pruritus’, ‘rash’, ‘anaphylactic reactions’ and ‘increased heart rate’. 
As an overall assessment, the MAH evaluates that the benefit-to-risk balance of Victoza remains 
favourable. 
Spontaneous adverse events reported with Victoza in combination with insulin 
There is no data available on the post-marketed use of Victoza combined with Tresiba, as Tresiba was 
approved recently. In October 2011, the European Commission approved to include data to the EU 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for the add-on of once-daily Levemir to treatment with 
Victoza and metformin in subjects not achieving adequate glycaemic control with Victoza and metformin 
alone. The use of Victoza in combination with basal insulin is currently not in the Victoza label. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 71/82 
 
  
  
The following section describes spontaneous adverse events with Victoza in concomitant use with insulin 
for the period from 31 December 2011 to 30 June 2012. 
A total of 349 reports (717 events) were reported in the period when Victoza was co-administered with 
insulin product including insulin analogues. A total of 158 reports (290 events) were medically confirmed 
and 94 reports (160 events) of the medically confirmed reports were serious. 
The pattern of adverse events reported in subjects where Victoza is used in combination with insulin does 
not differ from the overall pattern of adverse events reported in subjects only being treated with Victoza. 
The MAH does not consider these events to raise any new safety concerns and no change to the CCDS is 
warranted. 
In addition, in recent years, several publications have described the clinical benefits of combining GLP-1 
analogues and basal insulin analogues in the treatment of T2DM, reflecting the wide use of this 
combination in clinical practice without increased risk of hypoglycaemia. 
2.4.4.  Discussion 
With the current application, safety data from four clinical studies investigating the combination of IDeg 
and liraglutide and including 2 220 patients has been submitted. In total 1 111 patients have been 
treated with either the free combination (87 patients) or the  combination (1024 patients) for up to one 
year. Thus the safety database is of adequate size to allow assessment of the safety profile of the 
combination. 
Overall exposure was balanced between treatment groups, however, there were more males than females 
included in the studies. The exposure to the free combination was rather limited. 
Studies 3697 and 3912 contribute with a substantial exposure to the  combination of IDeg and liraglutide. 
This is acceptable from a safety perspective, although the slower uptitration of liraglutide with the 
liraglutide component may have implications on the safety profile. 
In study 3948, the overall reporting of AEs was higher per 100 PYE in the group treated with IDeg + Lira 
(517 events/100 PYE) compared to IDeg + IAsp (274 events/100 PYE), which was also reflected in a 
slightly higher withdrawal rate due to AEs. Severe events were balanced between groups (10 vs 12 
events/100 PYE) and the event rate was low. In the supportive studies, the rate of AEs was more 
balanced between groups. Imbalances in the reporting of adverse events between treatment groups were 
due to a higher reporting rate of gastrointestinal events (nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting) in groups 
treated with IDeg + liraglutide or liraglutide alone. Injection site reactions were uncommon but more 
frequently reported in IDeg + liraglutide group in the pivotal study. Thus in the groups treated with a 
combination of liraglutide and basal insulin, the AEs reported mainly reflect the known safety profile of 
liraglutide. The reporting rates were somewhat lower in the groups treated with the  combination, which 
may reflect the slower uptitration of liraglutide in these groups. 
There were few deaths reported (3 cases in study 3697 and 1 case in study 1842) and none of the cases 
appear to be related to the medication but rather to underlying disease. 
In the analysis of adverse events of special interest, no new safety concerns are evoked. Only 40 of the 
216 cardiovascular events in trial 3697 and 3912 identified by search qualified for adjudication and were 
sent to the event adjudication committee (EAC). This has been partly clarified by the fact that the search 
to identify cardiovascular events was very broad. The majority of events that did not qualify for 
adjudication were arrhythmias. Furthermore, the cardiovascular safety profile of IDeg and liraglutide are 
currently being further investigated in dedicated, large, prospective cardiovascular outcomes trials 
(DEVOTE and LEADER®, respectively).

A small increase in pulse rate was observed in the IDeg + liraglutide as has previously been described for 
liraglutide. Otherwise no differences in vital signs were observed between groups. Comparable findings 
with regards to blood pressure and pulse rate were observed across the supportive studies. 
No new safety concerns arise from the clinical laboratory evaluations. There were no indications of a 
change in the immunogenicity profile when IDeg and liraglutide were used in combination and the rate of 
antibody development was low.  
The subgroup analyses were performed but have to be interpreted with caution due to the small sample 
sizes. No clinically relevant interactions between age and the reporting of AEs were observed.   
Post-marketing data was provided. Tresiba has only recently been introduced on the market and only 
limited data are yet available. Post-marketing data concerning the concomitant use of liraglutide in 
combination with insulin does not evoke any safety concerns 
The safety data submitted does not indicate any change in the known safety profiles of either IDeg or 
liraglutide when used in combination.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s).  
The RMP has been updated in all relevant sections and these changes are endorsed by the PRAC with 
some minor comments: 
 
The RMP has been amended with exposure data from study 3948 (assessed within the ongoing type 
II variation). These data have been presented separately from the currently available Tresiba data. 
The rationale for this is questioned since the summary data for Tresiba presented in tables 2-10, 2-
12, 2-14 and 2-16 includes patients treated both with monotherapy and combinations with other 
antihyperglycaemic agents. It may therefore be considered to include the data from study 3948 in the 
summary tables. Further to this it should be considered to include information on the exposure to the  
combination since these data provides relevant information for important safety considerations on the 
combination. 
  Section 4.1 in the RMP has been amended with a discussion on efficacy in the target population. The 
amendment is endorsed although the final wording is pending the outcome of the ongoing type II 
variation. 
 
The entire section 6 in the RMP has been amended in the current version of the RMP. This is in 
general endorsed. Table 6-1 should be updated as indicated in double strike through since “co-
administration with GLP-1” is no longer missing information.  
The comments made should be taken into consideration with the next scheduled update of the RMP. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.6.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed:  
Section 4.2 of the SmPC 
[…] 
In  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus,  Tresiba  can  be  administered  alone,  or  in  any  combination 
with oral anti-diabetic medicinal products, GLP-1 receptor agonists as well as in combination with and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 76/82 
 
  
  
 
bolus insulin (see section 5.1). 
[…] 
Use of Tresiba in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
When  adding  Tresiba  to  GLP-1  receptor  agonists,  the  recommended  daily  starting  dose  is  10 units 
followed by individual dosage adjustments. 
When adding GLP-1 receptor agonists to Tresiba, it is recommended to reduce the dose of Tresiba by 
20% to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. Subsequently, dosage should be adjusted individually. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC 
[…] 
In  a  104-week  clinical  trial,  57%  of  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  treated  with  Tresiba  (insulin 
degludec) in combination with metformin achieved a target HbA1c < 7.0% and the remaining patients 
continued  in  a  26-week  open  label  trial  and  were  randomised  to  add  liraglutide  or  a  single  dose  of 
insulin aspart (with the largest meal). In the  insulin degludec + liraglutide  arm,  the insulin  dose  was 
reduced  by  20%  in  order  to  minimise  the  risk  of  hypoglycaemia.  Addition  of  liraglutide  resulted  in  a 
statistically significantly greater reduction of HbA1c  (-0.73% for liraglutide  vs  -0.40% for comparator, 
estimated  means)  and  body  weight  (-3.03  vs  0.72 kg,  estimated  means).  The  rate of  hypoglycaemic 
episodes  (per  patient  year  of  exposure)  was  statistically  significantly  lower  when  adding  liraglutide 
compared to adding a single dose of insulin aspart (1.0 vs 8.15; ratio: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.21). 
Section 1 of the Package Leaflet 
1.  What Tresiba is and what it is used for 
Tresiba  is  a  long-acting  basal  insulin  called  insulin  degludec.  It  is  used  to  treat  diabetes  mellitus  in 
adults.  Tresiba  helps  your  body  reduce  your  blood  sugar  level.  It  is  used  for  once-daily  dosing.  On 
occasions  when  you  cannot  follow  your  regular  dosing  schedule  you  can  change  the  time  of  dosing 
because  Tresiba has a long blood-sugar-lowering effect  (see  section  3  for  ‘Flexibility  in dosing time’). 
In  type  2  diabetes  mellitus,  Tresiba  may  be  used  in  combination  with  tablets  for  diabetes  or  with 
injectable anti-diabetic products, other than insulin. Tresiba can  also  be used with meal-related rapid 
acting insulin products. 
In type 1 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba must always be used in combination with meal-related rapid acting 
insulin products. 
Editorial changes have been made to the PI which is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Changes  were  also  made  to  the  PI  to  bring  it  in  line  with  the  current  Agency/QRD  template,  which 
were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.  Significance of paediatric studies 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/44/2010 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/44/2010 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Benefits 
The purpose of the current variations application is to propose a labelling update for the use of insulin 
degludec (IDeg) in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists. 
Beneficial effects 
In support of the current application, the MAH has submitted one pivotal study (3948) and three 
supportive studies (3697, 3912 and 1842). Data have been provided showing that there are no clinically 
relevant differences in pharmacokinetic properties of IDeg or liraglutide when administered as IDegLira 
(100 units/3.6 mg per mL) or as free IDeg and liraglutide mono-components which justifies the use of 
studies 3697 and 3912 as supportive data in the current application. 
The pivotal study included 177 patients with T2DM who were in need of intensified treatment, i.e. HbA1c 
> 7 in spite of treatment with IDeg and metformin in the context of a two-year treat-to-target study. 
After 26 weeks a clinically relevant HbA1c reduction of -0.74 % was observed in patients treated with 
IDeg + liraglutide as compared to -0.39 % in the group treated with IDeg + IAsp. The treatment 
difference was statistically significant (- 0.32%-point [-0.53;-0.12]95%CI).  
This finding was supported by the data from studies 3697 and 3912 where the difference in HbA1c 
reduction between  IDegLira and the mono-components ranged between -0.47 and -1.05 % depending on 
the study design and population included. Maintenance of the efficacy of the combination up to one year 
has been shown. 
In addition, data from study 1842 has shown that a comparable effect on HbA1c reduction is observed 
when basal insulin IDet is added to liraglutide. 
The overall hypoglycaemia rates were comparable across the studies in the groups treated with the 
combination of IDeg and liraglutide (range: 100 - 180 events per 100 PYE) and lower compared IDeg 
alone (range: 257 – 263 events per 100 PYE). The highest hypoglycaemia rate was observed in patients 
treated with IDeg + IAsp (815 events per 100 PYE) and the lowest rate was seen in patients on liraglutide 
monotherapy (22 events per 100 PYE). 
Across the studies, combination therapy resulted in a change in body weight ranging from -0.5 kg to 
-2.8 kg. 
The data from the pivotal and supportive studies support the posology proposed for the combination 
therapy, when a GLP-1 analogue is added to IDeg. Trial 1842 lend support to the proposed posology 
when adding basal insulin in patients already on liraglutide. Although this study was performed with at 
different basal insulin, the characteristics of the two insulins are deemed sufficiently similar to allow 
extrapolation of these data from IDet to IDeg. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The choice to administer the comparator (IAsp) OD in the pivotal study 3948 is questioned. This was 
done in order to add the same number of injections in both groups. This regimen is however not 
considered optimal since dose escalation can only be made with one meal of the day thereby limiting the 
possibility to exhaust this treatment option. Dose increases will be hindered by the occurrence of (post-
prandial) hypoglycaemias that could have been avoided by instead adding doses of IAsp to other meals.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 78/82 
 
  
  
Therefore the once daily dosing of the comparator IAsp is suboptimal and thus the difference in treatment 
effect between the combination IDeg and liraglutide versus IDeg and bolus insulin may be somewhat 
overestimated. The overall data however support that the addition of liraglutide to IDeg is an efficient 
treatment option.  
Administering bolus insulin once daily may indeed provoke hypoglycaemias; however, the currently 
proposed description of hypoglycaemia data in the SmPC is considered acceptable. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
With the current application, safety data from four clinical studies investigating the combination of IDeg 
and liraglutide and including 2 220 patients has been submitted. In total 1 111 patients has been treated 
with either the free combination (87 patients) or the  combination (1024 patients) for up to one year. 
Thus the safety database is of adequate size to allow assessment of the safety profile of the combination. 
The most commonly reported adverse events in patients treated with the combination across the studies 
were gastrointestinal events (i.e. nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting) which are known to occur with 
liraglutide treatment. 
There were no indications of a change in the immunogenicity profile when IDeg and liraglutide were used 
in combination and the rate of antibody development was low. 
The safety data submitted does not indicate any change in the safety profiles of either IDeg or liraglutide 
when used in combination. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There are no new uncertainties or safety concerns evoked in relation to the combination therapy. 
Balance 
Importance of the favourable and unfavourable effects 
The addition of liraglutide to IDeg treatment has been shown to result in clinically relevant (additional) 
reductions of HbA1c. This reduction was achieved at a relatively low risk of hypoglycaemia. Although the 
comparison in the pivotal study is not entirely accepted, the totality of data indicates that the risk of 
hypoglycaemia is lower with this approach than with intensified insulin therapy. Furthermore, 
improvement of metabolic control was achieved concomitantly with a reduction of body weight. 
The effects on HbA1c, risk of hypoglycaemia and body weight are all considered of benefit in a T2DM 
population in need of intensified treatment. 
The safety data provided does not indicate any changes in the safety profiles for IDeg or liraglutide when 
administered in combination. The adverse events known to occur with liraglutide predominated the 
adverse event reporting. These events are well known and are considered manageable.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The data provided is considered sufficient to conclude that combination treatment with IDeg and 
liraglutide is efficient and that no new safety concerns have been evoked by the presented data.  
The clinical trials included with this variation application all evaluate use of basal insulin (IDeg or IDet) in 
combination with liraglutide. The MAH argues that liraglutide has been shown to be as least as effective 
as Byetta, Bydureon, and Lyxumia with regard to improvements in HbA1c. This is supported by published 
data (Buse JB, et al. Lancet 2009; 374:39-47 [Byetta]; Buse JB, et al. Lancet. 2013; 12;381(9861):117-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805141/2013 
Page 79/82 
 
  
  
24 [Bydureon]; Kapitza C, et al. Diabetes Obes Metab. 2013; 15(7):642-9) [Lyxumia]). The comparative 
data includes both short-acting and long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. It is therefore accepted that the 
data obtained with liraglutide can be extrapolated to achieve a general claim of IDeg in combination with 
GLP-1 receptor agonists from an efficacy point of view. Considering the similarities in safety profile within 
the class of GLP-1 receptor agonists, no difference in the safety profile is expected if IDeg is combined 
with other GLP-1 receptor agonists than liraglutide. The recommendation to reduce the IDeg dose when 
initiating GLP-1 receptor agonist is deemed adequate in order to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia.  
Conclusion 
The benefit risk balance for the use of insulin degludec (Tresiba) in combination with GLP-1 receptor 
agonists is considered positive. The overall benefit risk balance for Tresiba remains positive.

  Additional risk minimisation measures  
The MAH shall provide an educational pack prior to launch targeting all physicians and nurses who are 
expected to be involved in the treatment and management of diabetic patients and all pharmacists 
who are expected to dispense Tresiba. 
The educational pack is aimed at increasing awareness about the introduction of a new strength of 
insulin in the European market and describing key differences in the design of the packages and the 
prefilled pen devices to minimise the risk of medication errors and mix up between the two different 
strengths of Tresiba. 
The educational pack should contain: 
– Direct Healthcare Professional Communication letter as described below;  
– Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet; 
– Poster for display in pharmacies/diabetic units 
– Patient Brochures. 
The MAH shall ensure that healthcare professionals are informed that all patients who have been 
prescribed Tresiba should be provided with a patient brochure and be trained on the correct use of the 
prefilled pen before prescribing or dispensing Tresiba. 
The Poster for pharmacies/diabetic units shall contain the following key elements: 
– That Tresiba is available in 2 strengths; 
– Key differences in the design of the packages and the prefilled pen devices; 
– When prescribing to make sure that the correct strength is mentioned in the prescription slip; 
– Always check the insulin label before dispensing to make sure the correct strength is delivered to the 
patient; 
– Always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental mix-ups between the two 
different strengths of Tresiba; 
– Do not use outside of the prefilled pen device (e.g. syringes); 
– Reporting of medication errors or any side effects. 
The patient brochure shall contain the following key elements: 
– That Tresiba is available in 2 strengths; 
– Key differences in the design of the packages and the prefilled pen devices; 
– Always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental mix-ups between the two 
different strengths of Tresiba; 
– Patients who are blind or have poor vision must be instructed always to get help/assistance from 
another person who has good vision and is trained in using the insulin device; 
– Always use the dose recommended by your healthcare provider;

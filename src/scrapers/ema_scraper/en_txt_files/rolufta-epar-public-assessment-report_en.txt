1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant GlaxoSmithKline Trading Services Limited submitted on 27 October 2016 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Rolufta, through the centralised procedure 
under Article 3 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed 
upon by the EMA/CHMP on 18 October 2012.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in 
adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC – relating to informed consent from a marketing authorisation holder for 
an authorised medicinal product. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, quality, non-clinical and clinical data with 
a letter from GlaxoSmithKline Trading Services Limited allowing the cross reference to relevant quality, 
non-clinical and/or clinical data. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Not applicable 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the 
proposed indication. 
This application is submitted as a multiple of Incruse authorised on 18 April 2014 in accordance with Article 82.1 
of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

The Rapporteurs’ updated Joint Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP and PRAC members on 16 
January 2017. 
During the meeting on 26 January 2017, the CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the 
scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a Marketing authorisation 
to Rolufta. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Rolufta (umeclidinium bromide) inhalation powder predispensed, 55 micrograms has been submitted as an 
informed consent application in accordance with the Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The initial marketing authorisation application (MAA) for umeclidinium bromide was approved on 28th April 
2014 under the trademark Incruse (EMEA/H/C/002809). The application for Rolufta concerns the strength of 55 
micrograms inhalation powder predispensed and consists only of Module 1 information. 
As a consequence, quality, efficacy and safety of Rolufta medicinal product are identical to the up-to-date 
quality, efficacy and safety profile of Incruse. 
The Rolufta informed consent application concerns the following presentations: 
• 
• 
Inhaler containing 7 doses (the inhaler contains one aluminium foil laminate blister of 7 doses) 
Inhaler containing 30 doses (the inhaler contains one aluminium foil laminate blister of 30 doses) 
•  Multipack of 3 inhalers containing 30 doses each. 
The benefit-risk of Rolufta is considered to be positive, as it is a duplicate of Incruse, in the following indication: 
•  Rolufta is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients 
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
Umeclidinium bromide is a long acting muscarinic receptor antagonist administrated by inhalation. It is 
competitively inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine with muscarinic cholinergic receptors on airway smooth 
muscle, exerting a bronchodilatory activity. Therefore, Rolufta is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator 
treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients with COPD. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Incruse application, the quality data in support of the Rolufta 
application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Incruse dossier, which have been assessed and 
approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

EMA/CHMP/148961/2017 
Page 5/12 
 
  
  
 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Since Rolufta application is an informed consent of Incruse application, the non-clinical data in support of the 
Rolufta application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of Incruse dossier, which have been assessed 
and authorised (including all post-marketing procedures).  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Umeclidinium PECsurfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L and is not a persistent, 
bioaccummulative, and toxic (PBT) substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore umeclidinium is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. Some environmental effects studies were additionally conducted 
with umeclidinium and the results and associated study reports were provided in the non-clinical dossier of 
Incruse. For this application no additional studies, neither for the Activated Sludge, Respiration Inhibition Test 
(OECD 209) are required. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted since this application is an informed consent of the Incruse 
application. 
Umeclidinium is exempt from a full ERA as the PEC SURFACEWATER does not exceed the action limit of 0.01 µg/L; 
therefore, the Activated Sludge, Respiration Inhibition Test (OECD 209) is not required.  
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered there were no non-clinical objections to the granting of the authorisation of this informed 
consent application for Rolufta. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
Since Rolufta application is an informed consent of Incruse application, the clinical data in support of the Rolufta 
application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of Incruse dossier, which have been assessed and 
authorised (including all post-marketing procedures).

Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of umeclidinium bromide in 
pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect 
harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. 
Umeclidinium bromide should be used during pregnancy only if 
the expected benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to 
the fetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether umeclidinium bromide is excreted in 
human milk. A risk to breastfed newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
or to discontinue INCRUSE/ Rolufta therapy taking into account 
the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman.”

“4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment. INCRUSE/ Rolufta has not been 
studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and should be 
used with caution. 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Hepatic impairment 
Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) 
showed no evidence of an increase in systemic exposure to 
umeclidinium bromide (Cmax and AUC), and no evidence of 
altered protein binding between subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment and healthy volunteers. Umeclidinium bromide has 
not been evaluated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment.” 
Conclusion 
The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 7 above described has been revised as 
recommended by the PRAC to take in account the changes requested in the PSUSA procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010263/201604 and is acceptable.

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:  
The MAH has included the results from the Relvar Ellipta and Anoro Ellipta user testing process as well as 
providing a User Bridging Report for the originator product. There are no significant changes for the proposed 
patient leaflet. 
Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Rolufta (Umeclidinium) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as a Post Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) has been imposed at the time of authorisation for 
Incruse (Umeclidinium) furthermore it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
Rolufta is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC. The CHMP has 
previously reviewed data on quality, safety and efficacy of the original dossier (Incruse) and considered the 
benefit / risk balance favourable.  
The benefit-risk of Rolufta is considered to be positive, as it is a duplicate of Incruse, in the following indication: 
•  Rolufta is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients 
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

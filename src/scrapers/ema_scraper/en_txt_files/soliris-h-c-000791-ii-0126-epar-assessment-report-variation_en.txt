2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The purpose of this application is to extend the generalized myasthenia gravis indication for eculizumab to 
include  paediatric  patients  with  refractory  AChR-Ab+  gMG.  The  initially  proposed  indication  was  the 
following:  
“Soliris  is  indicated  in  adults  and  children  for  the  treatment  of  refractory  generalized  myasthenia  gravis 
(gMG) in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive.” 
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder involving the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in which 
there is fatigue of the skeletal musculature, which is potentially life threatening. Weakness of the muscles 
tends to fluctuate.3,4  
Subtypes  of  childhood  myasthenia  gravis  are  neonatal  MG,  which  is  transient,  owing  to  maternal 
autoantibodies  transferred  to  foetal  circulation;  congenital  myasthenia  syndromes,  which  are  a  group of 
syndromes  due  to  genetic  nonimmune-mediated  causes;  or  juvenile  myasthenia  gravis  (JMG),  which  is 
acquired MG not related to structural disorders, occurring in childhood or adolescence (i.e. <18 years of 
age)1. JMG patients are subdivided according to the occurrence of the first symptoms as prepubertal (first 
symptoms before the age of 12 years) and post pubertal (first symptoms after the age of 12 years).2  
Epidemiology  
Two systematic reviews of population based epidemiological studies in MG published in 2010 reported an 
estimated incidence rate of 5.3 per million person-years (C.I.:4.4, 6.1), range: 1.7 to 21.33  and between 
3.0 and 30.0 per million person-years4, respectively. The estimated prevalence rate was 77.7 cases per 
million.6 The prevalence of MG in the European Union is estimated at 3.7 in 10,000, equivalent to a total of 
around 191,000 people5 . The prevalence and incidence of MG varied substantially across geographies.  
In the paediatric population the incidence is estimated to be between 1.0 and 5.0 cases per million person 
years.3 A recent population based study found the incidence of juvenile myasthenia gravis to be 1.2 per

million person years.7 It is estimated that between 10% and 15% of all cases of myasthenia occur in the 
paediatric population.8 This proportion may be higher in Asian populations.9,10   
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
MG is caused by pathogenic autoantibodies that interfere with synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular 
junction  and  impair  or  prevent  muscle  contraction 6 , 7 , 8 .  In  approximately  85%  of  cases,  circulating 
antibodies  target  the  AChR  itself.  In  the  remaining  15%,  approximately  half  have  antibodies  against 
muscle-specific  tyrosine  kinase  (MuSK),  while  the  other  half  may  be  positive  for  autoantibodies  against 
lipoprotein-related  protein  receptor 4  (LRP4)  or  other  antigens  associated  with  the  neuromuscular 
junction9,10. 
The  pathogenic  actions  of  IgG  autoantibodies  include  functional  blockade  of  AChR,  accelerated 
internalization  and  degradation  of  AChR,  and  activation  of  the  complement  system.  These  pathogenic 
actions  result  in  reduced  density  of  functional  AChR  and  simplification  of  the  NMJ,  leading  to  failure  of 
neuromuscular  transmission.  Anti-AChR  autoantibodies  are  of  the  IgG1  and  IgG3  subtypes.  Anti-MuSK 
autoantibodies are IgG4 subtype and do not activate the complement pathway11.  
AChR antibodies are less frequent in prepubertal patients than in adolescent and adult patients. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness with varying degrees and fatigability that worsens with exertion, and 
improves with rest are the main presenting symptoms of JMG. The first symptoms may develop as early as 
in the first year of life.  
In most cases, initial symptoms are ocular and include ptosis and diplopia, but within 2 to 3 years of onset, 
the disease usually worsens, and other muscles become affected; this is referred to as gMG12. Additional 
symptoms  typically  include  difficulty  chewing,  dysphagia,  dysarthria,  hypophonia,  dyspnea,  difficulty 
holding the head upright, and fatigue, marked reductions in the ability to perform activities of daily living 
and extreme fatigue. Children are at risk of choking or aspiration and are at increased risk of chest infection 
and episodes of pulmonary failure requiring mechanical ventilation13 14. 
Ocular  JMG  is  associated  with  younger  age  at  onset  with  higher  rates  seen  in  pre-pubertal  children, 
regardless of race. Post-pubertal JMG more closely mirrors adult MG with a greater proportion of generalized 
onset and lower rates of spontaneous remission15,16. 
Hospitalizations  for  gMG  exacerbations  are  common,  with  the  need  for  respiratory  support,  including 
mechanical ventilation secondary to respiratory failure (e.g., myasthenic crisis). 
The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Clinical Classification categorizes patients according 
to clinical evaluation, which in increasing severity can be: ocular MG; mild, moderate, severe generalized 
symptoms of MG; MG that requires intubation17.

The  diagnosis  of  myasthenia  gravis  is  confirmed  by  the  combination  of  relevant  symptoms  and  signs,  a 
positive test for specific autoantibodies and a positive neurophysiological examination, including repetitive 
nerve  stimulation  or  single-fiber  electromyography,  and  symptomatic  improvement  following  treatment 
with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. 
Children with JMG exhibit higher rates of remission than adults. This includes spontaneous remission and 
remission following a period of drug therapy. Remission rates also appear to be influenced by ethnic origin. 
Peri- or postpubertal patients presenting with JMG share more similarities with adult-onset MG. Prepubertal 
children have the highest rates of spontaneous remission18. 
Management 
Treatment  of  JMG  is  similar  to  adult  myasthenia  gravis.  Treatment  commonly  includes  usage  of 
symptomatic  medications  [anticholinesterases  (mainly  pyridostigmine)],  immune-suppressive  therapies 
(IST)  (as  azathioprine  or  corticosteroids  with  or  without  steroid-sparing  agents),  immune-modulating 
agents, plasma exchange (PE), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and thymectomy3.  
At the time of this application, the complement inhibitor eculizumab (Soliris) and ravulizumab (Ultomiris), 
efgartigimod alfa (Vyvgart) and azathioprine (Jayempi) have received regulatory approval for the treatment 
of gMG in adults.  
Children are at particular risk of steroid side effects. Long-term treatment with corticosteroids should use 
the lowest effective dose to minimize side effects. Maintenance PLEX or IVIg are alternatives to IS drugs in 
JMG.  Thymectomy  should  be  considered  in  children  with  generalized  AChR  antibody–positive  MG  if  the 
response to pyridostigmine and IS therapy is unsatisfactory; or in order to avoid potential complications of 
IS therapy.20 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Eculizumab  (Soliris®)  is  a  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  directed  against  the  human  complement 
component  5  (C5),  inhibiting  C5  enzymatic  cleavage  and  thereby  preventing  the  generation  of  the 
proinflammatory/prothrombotic  complement  activation  products  C5a  and 
the  cytolytic  and 
proinflammatory/prothrombotic membrane attack complex C5b-9 that are responsible for the inflammatory 
consequences of terminal complement activation19.  
Eculizumab  is  approved  for  use  in  4  complement-mediated  diseases,  namely  paroxysmal  nocturnal 
hemoglobinuria  (PNH),  atypical  hemolytic  uremic  syndrome  (aHUS),  generalized  MG  (gMG)  and 
Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).  
The  purpose  of  this  application  is  to  extend  the  generalized  myasthenia  gravis  (gMG)  indication  for 
eculizumab to include paediatric patients with refractory AChR-Ab + gMG. The finally approved indication 
was as follows:  
“Soliris  is  indicated  in  adults  and  children  for  the  treatment  of  refractory  generalized  myasthenia  gravis 
(gMG) in patients aged 6 years and above who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive.”

in the treatment of myasthenia gravis including the following measures:  
-  Study 1: open-label, multicentre study to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, and effect of eculizumab 
in paediatric patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age with refractory AChR-Ab positive generalized 
myasthenia gravis and to confirm the selected paediatric dosing in the modelling and simulation study 
(ECU-MG-303). 
-  Study 2: Modelling and simulation study to evaluate the use and support dosing regimen of eculizumab 
in paediatric patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age with refractory AChR-Ab positive generalized 
myasthenia gravis. 
-  Study 3: Extrapolation study to evaluate efficacy, pharmacokinetics(PK)/pharmacodynamics(PD), and 
safety of eculizumab in paediatric patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age with AChR-Ab positive 
generalized myasthenia gravis. 
No quality-related or non-clinical measures were required. 
The first PIP was adopted by EMA on 26 Feb 2016. The latest request for modification was approved by 
EMA on 11 Mar 2022 (EMEA-000876-PIP05-15-M05). 
The MAH did not seek protocol assistance at the CHMP. 
No CHMP Guideline on the treatment of Myasthenia Gravis is currently available. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
According to the MAH all clinical studies have been conducted in accordance with the International Council 
for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical Practices. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  CHMP  guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00)  with  effective  date  of  December  2006,  states  that  vitamins,  electrolytes, 
amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted of environmental risk assessment 
because,  due  to  their  nature  they  are  unlikely  to  result  in  significant  risk  to  the  environment.  Since 
eculizumab  is  a  monoclonal  antibody  and  thus  a  protein,  no  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  has  been 
provided with this Type II variation which is acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The eculizumab clinical development program in paediatric population with refractory gMG includes three 
studies as indicated in the above section.

adult population, thereby addressing study 2 of the PIP. 
The specific objectives of this analysis were to: 
• 
Perform an exploratory assessment of eculizumab exposure in paediatric subjects with refractory 
gMG and overlay with data from adults. 
•  Update  the  previously  developed  eculizumab  population  PK  (Pop-PK)  model  based  on  data  from 
studies C08-001, ECU-MG-301 and ECU-MG-302 in adult subjects with refractory gMG, with new 
data from Study ECU-MG-303 in paediatric subjects with refractory MG and evaluate concordance 
of pharmacokinetics and eculizumab exposure between the paediatric and adult patient population. 
• 
Perform an exploratory assessment of free C5 and haemolysis response in paediatric subjects with 
refractory gMG and overlay with data from adults.

Study ECU-MG-303 
This is an open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, and PD of IV eculizumab in 
paediatric patients 6 to < 18 years of age with AChR antibody positive refractory gMG. 
The study design is shown in Figure 1. There were 4 periods in this study: screening Period (2-4 weeks), 
primary Evaluation treatment Period (26 weeks), extension Period (up to an additional 208 weeks), follow-
up Period (8 weeks) 
Figure 1: Study Design of ECU-MG-303 
The noncompartmental analysis will be performed using PK data collected during the primary evaluation 
treatment period 
Paediatric subjects were treated according to a bodyweight based dosing regimen as shown in Table 2. For 
subjects who enter the study on maintenance IVIg treatment, a series of supplemental doses of eculizumab 
were  administered  to  account  for  the  anticipated  approximately  50%  increase  in  eculizumab  clearance 
according to Table 3.

Prior Pop-PK Modelling 
A pop-PK model was previously developed, using data from Phase 2 (C08-001) and Phase 3 (ECU-MG-301 
and ECU-MG-302) studies for eculizumab in adults. 
The eculizumab PK data were well-described by a 2-compartment model with 1st-order elimination. Random 
effects were included on the clearance (CL) and on the central volume of distribution (V1) and a correlation 
term  was  estimated.  A  combined  error  model  (additive  +proportional)  adequately  described  residual 
variability of Study C08-001 data, whereas a proportional error was sufficient to describe residual variability 
of Study ECU-MG-301 and Study ECU-MG-302 data. 
A  non-linear  assay  conversion  factor  was  estimated  to  scale  Study  C08-001  exposures  to  the  levels 
observed in Studies ECU-MG-301 and ECU-MG-302. All PK parameters were allometrically scaled by body 
weight, allowing describing interindividual differences in the population of interest; in addition, PE events 
were modelled to account for a temporary increase in eculizumab clearance during the PE period. No other 
available covariates were found to influence eculizumab exposure. 
The  analysis  dataset  constituted  of  135  adult  eculizumab  treated  subjects  covering  a  bodyweight  range 
between 37 and 174 kg.

Update of the Pop-PK Model 
The prior pop-PK model was refitted to the combined adult and paediatric analysis dataset. PK parameters 
as well as bodyweight effects were re-estimated, and consistency of PK parameters across paediatric and 
adult subjects was evaluated. Differences in PK between paediatric and adult which could not be addressed 
by  the  incorporated  bodyweight  effects,  were  addressed  by  introducing  age  group  specific  terms  in  the 
model. No further model development or assessment of covariate effects was performed. 
Data Summary 
The analysis dataset for the pop-PK analysis of eculizumab comprised of 135 adult subjects from Studies 
08-001, ECU-MG-301 and ECU-MG-302 (Previous Pop-PK Model Table 6) and 11 paediatric subjects from 
Study ECU-MG-303 for which evaluable PK observations were available (Table 7 and Table 8).

The  prior  pop-PK  model  was  refitted  to  the  combined  adult  and  paediatric  PK  data  (run105).  Parameter 
estimates were similar to the estimates obtained from the fit using the adult data only (Table 5) from the 
prior analysis. ETA plots for CL and V1 were compared between adult and paediatric subjects and indicated 
that  ETA  V1  distributions  were  similar  and  overlapping,  but  ETA  CL  values  indicated  that  CL  appeared 
somewhat higher for paediatric subjects compared to adults. The increased CL for paediatric subjects was 
included and quantified in run106, which was defined the updated pop-Pk model. 
The first-order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCE INTER) method as implemented in NONMEM 
was used for model fitting. Key model development steps of the pop-PK model are summarized in Table 9.

Eculizumab Pharmacokinetic Simulations 
Two sets of simulations were conducted, utilizing the updated pop-PK model.  
• 
• 
The objective of the first simulation exercise was to illustrate the similarity between the observed 
paediatric and model-predicted adult exposure. 
The second simulation aimed to illustrate the adequacy of the proposed bodyweight-based dosing 
regimen for each of the bodyweight classes to achieve similar exposures compared to adults. 
Observed  eculizumab  concentrations  for  the  paediatric  subjects  are  overlaid  on  the  simulated 
concentration-time  profile.  The  simulated  dosing  regimen  for  adults  included  an  induction  phase  of  four 
weekly 900 mg eculizumab doses followed by a dose of 1200 mg one week later. The maintenance phase 
then starts two weeks later using a 1200 mg every two weeks dose regimen.

Supplementary PK and PD Data for the Extrapolation Exercise 
This section summarizes the Pop-PK and PD analyses of eculizumab in paediatric patients with a diagnosis 
of aHUS or PNH and in adult patients with a diagnosis of refractory gMG, for the purpose of confirming the 
paediatric dose regimen for the refractory gMG indication.  
The objectives of the Pop-PK and PD analyses were to: 
• 
• 
• 
describe the sources of variability in PK and PD parameters within a modelling framework using the 
available data from the adult and paediatric patients with aHUS, PNH paediatric patients, and adult 
refractory acetylcholine receptor antibody positive gMG (refractory gMG) patients 
conduct  simulations  to  confirm  PK  and  PD  bridging  between  the  aHUS  and  refractory  gMG 
indications and ultimately support dose regimens for paediatric refractory gMG patients.

Myasthenia Gravis Population Pharmacokinetic Models to Extrapolate Atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome 
Paediatric Dosing Regimens of Eculizumab to Refractory Generalized Myasthenia Gravis Paediatric Patients 
Since this simulation study focuses on proposing paediatric dose regimens, body weight is an important 
covariate. For both aHUS and refractory gMG Pop-PK models, body weight is linked to predicting eculizumab 
exposure,  and  therefore  categorical  body-weight-based  dosing  is  recommended  in  the  paediatric 
population. The empirical body weight exponents estimated from the aHUS Pop-PK model were used, rather 
than the empirical body weight exponents estimated from the refractory gMG adult Pop-PK model. This is 
because  the  aHUS  Pop-PK  model  included  a  wider  range  of  body  weight  data  spanning  paediatric, 
adolescent, and adult patients weighing 4.4 to 127 kg (aHUS/PNH (referred to as aHUS) Pop-PK model), 
whereas the refractory gMG Pop-PK model used data with a much higher body weight range and an adult-
only population (37 to 174 kg, ECU-MG-Adult PK-PD Modeling Report). 
Three different simulation scenarios for the proposed dose regimens are conducted in this report: 
1) Simulations to support paediatric dose regimens in refractory gMG patients 
2) Simulations to support supplemental doses in the event of PE in refractory gMG patients 
3) Simulations to support supplemental doses in the event of IVIg treatment in refractory gMG patients

The PK bridging used the clinical trial simulation, as the observed eculizumab data between gMG and aHUS 
adult patients cannot be directly compared due to the following reasons: 
1) PK assays used for the aHUS studies were different than the PK assay used for the refractory gMG Study 
ECU-MG-301 
2) Body weight range was different between the 2 indications; and body weight is known to significantly 
affect eculizumab PK. 
PK/Exposure Bridging Between Adult Refractory gMG and aHUS Patients 
The  predicted  concentration-time  profiles  in  Figure  11  show  a  comparison  between  simulated  PK  levels 
using the aHUS Pop-PK model and the refractory gMG Pop-PK model. The refractory gMG PK levels were 
scaled using the inverse of the assay conversion Factor. This scaling allows a direct comparison between 
the aHUS and refractory gMG PK profiles.

Simulation of Supplemental Eculizumab Dose Following Plasma Exchange Intervention 
When  PE  intervention  is  needed,  eculizumab  concentrations  fall  because  drug  is  removed  during  the 
process.  To  maintain  eculizumab  concentrations  within  a  range  that  provides  complete  and  sustained 
complement  inhibition,  a  supplemental  dose  of  eculizumab  is  administered  to  compensate  for  the 
eculizumab removed from the body during PE intervention. 
The  supplemental  eculizumab  dose  needs  to  be  administered  within  1  to  2  hours  following  each  PE 
intervention (Table 17).

Because  PE  intervention  is  a  ‘transient’  event  that  alters  PK,  simulations  are  conducted  comparing  the 
concentration-time profile without (Figure 14 left panels) and with (Figure 14 right panels) a supplemental 
dose following PE intervention.

Simulation of Supplemental Dosing Regimens of Eculizumab Following IVIg Treatment 
Simulations  with  and  without  the  proposed  supplemental  eculizumab  dose  regimens  (Table  18)  were 
conducted. When IVIg was given after eculizumab treatment initiation, it was assumed that the effect of 
IVIg on eculizumab CL would immediately reach maximum (50% increase). This represented a worst-case 
scenario.

Notes:  If  a  patient  receives  IVIg  treatment  within  4  weeks  prior  to  receiving  the  first  dose  of  eculizumab,  a  supplemental  dose  of 
eculizumab will be administered at the same time the first dose of eculizumab is administered (the total dose is supplemental dose plus 
regular dose). If a patient continues to receive IVIg at a dose interval up to every 4 weeks during eculizumab treatment, a supplemental 
dose will be administered at the same time each regular dose of ecu is administered. If a patient receives IVIg treatment at a dose interval 
greater than every 4 weeks during eculizumab treatment, a supplemental dose will be administered following the last dose of IVIg infusion 
cycle at the next scheduled regular eculizumab dose

Immunogenicity 
No treatment-emergent ADA responses were observed following eculizumab treatment as of data cut-off 
date. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the human terminal complement 
component  C5,  inhibiting  C5  enzymatic  cleavage  and  thereby  preventing  the  generation  of  the 
proinflammatory/prothrombotic  complement  activation  products  C5a  and 
the  cytolytic  and 
proinflammatory/prothrombotic  MAC  C5b-9  that  are  responsible  for  the  inflammatory  consequences  of 
terminal complement activation. Given that terminal complement-mediated cell damage and inflammation 
at the neuromuscular junction play a central role in the pathophysiology of autoimmune-mediated MG, the 
mechanism of action of eculizumab as a terminal complement inhibitor supports its use in the management 
of refractory gMG mediated by complement-activating antibodies directed against the NMJ.

2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
Exploratory Analysis of PK-PD relationship for Free C5 and Haemolysis 
To exploratory assess the similarity of the relation of free C5 and haemolytic activity versus eculizumab 
concentrations in paediatric and adult subjects with refractory gMG, scatter plots were generated showing 
free C5 and haemolysis observations versus time-matched eculizumab concentrations colour coded by age 
group. 
Data Summary 
The analysis dataset for the PK-PD free C5 analysis of eculizumab comprised of 122 adult subjects from 
Studies  ECU-MG-301  and  ECU-MG-302  and  11  paediatric  subjects  from  Study  ECU-MG-303  for  which 
evaluable free C5 with time-matched observations of eculizumab were available. 
The analysis dataset for the PK-PD haemolysis analysis of eculizumab comprised of 135 adult subjects from 
Studies C08-001, ECU-MG-301 and ECU-MG-302 and 11 paediatric subjects from Study ECU-MG-303 for 
which evaluable haemolysis with time-matched observations of eculizumab were available.

PD/Response Bridging Between aHUS and gMG Patients 
Figure 21 establishes a threshold eculizumab concentration range using PK and PD data from aHUS, PNH, 
and refractory gMG patients. An analysis of haemolytic activity versus eculizumab concentration determined 
that  a  concentration  range  of  50  to  100  μg/mL  resulted  in  complete  inhibition  of  haemolysis  (<  20%) 
regardless of indication.

Note: Predose eculizumab concentrations below the lower limit of quantitation were set to 0 μg/mL. Post-dose eculizumab concentrations 
below the lower limit of quantitation were set to 5 μg/mL. For gMG study, ECU-MG-301, eculizumab concentrations were scaled by the 
assay conversion factor ie, Scaled=Cecu (1/1.07), where Cecu is the eculizumab concentration. Abbreviations: aHUS = atypical haemolytic 
uremic syndrome, gMG = generalized myasthenia gravis, PNH = paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
Figure 22 shows the free C5-concentration time profile from Study ECU-MG-301 in adult refractory gMG 
patients.  Treatment  with  eculizumab  produced  inhibition  of  the  PD  endpoint,  free  C5,  as  demonstrated 
using a highly reliable and accurate free C5 assay. Simulation using the free C5 model developed with the 
Study ECU-MG-301 data determined that a 116 μg/mL eculizumab concentration provides immediate and 
complete inhibition of free C5. When applying the inverse of the ACF, this value is 85 μg/mL. Free C5 data 
were not compared between PNH, aHUS and refractory gMG patients since free C5 was not measured in 
PNH studies and the aHUS studies (C08-002 and C08-003) used an earlier and more variable version of 
the assay.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Eculizumab for refractory gMG treatment in children was evaluated in the pivotal Phase 3 study ECU-MG-
303. Eleven patients were included and treated in the study with eculizumab. The dosing regimens studied 
were  those  previously  approved  for  paediatric  patients  with  aHUS  and  PNH.  However,  the  study  did not 
include patients younger than 12 years old and there was only 1 patient in the body weight range 30 to 40 
kg and 10 patients in the weight cohort ≥ 40 kg, which indicates that 10 out of 11 subjects received the 
dosing regimen for adult patients. 
The pop-PK analysis was based on a pooled dataset from 4 studies, which includes data of eculizumab from 
studies in adult patients with refractory gMG (C08-001, ECU-MG-301, ECU-MG-302) and from the pivotal 
phase  3  study  ECU-MG-303  in  children.  The  final  dataset  for  the  current  Pop-PK  model  development 
included 2674 observation records (133 BLQ) from 135 adult patients and 107 (11 BLQ) records from 11 
children patients. PK samples of eculizumab below the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) were low and were 
excluded from the analysis. M1 method for handling BLQ-data is considered acceptable. 
A  pop-PK  model  update  was  conducted  incorporating  paediatric  data  from  Study  ECU-MG-303  with  11 
paediatric subjects to the adult dataset, which comprised 135 adult subjects (Studies 08-001, ECU-MG-301 
and ECU-MG-302). The exploratory analysis suggests an adequate correspondence between exposure levels 
of  eculizumab  in  adult  and  paediatric  patients  with  gMG.  The  re-estimation  analysis  of  the  pop-PK 
parameters shows very similar PK values and an adequate model performance of the experimental data. 
Model evaluation was conducted through (i) graphical assessment of the prediction intervals of the updated 
pop-PK  model  and  the  experimental  paediatric  data  and  (ii)  a  bootstrap  analysis  of  the  PK  parameter 
estimates.  Both  analyses  demonstrate  the  adequacy  of  the  updated  pop-PK  model  to  capture  the 
longitudinal PK data of eculizumab in paediatric gMG patients from 12 years of age and adult gMG patients 
although  the  model  seems  to  slightly  under-predict  the  median  PK  trend  of  eculizumab  in  paediatric 
patients.  This  could  be  explained  by  the  unbalanced  distribution  of  adult  and  paediatric  patients,  which 
could affect the estimated value of the allometric exponents on CL/Q (1.11) and V1/V2 (0.609) since both 
are not even close to the reference/standard values (0.75 and 1, respectively).  
The  experimental  PD  evidence  collected  in  paediatric  patients  with  gMG  regarding  the  free-C5  and 
haemolysis suggests a similar PK/PD relationship between both populations. The efficacy threshold of 116 
micrograms/mL is endorsed.  
Then, a model-based extrapolation analysis was conducted using the estimates from the updated pop-PK 
model  (gMG  adult  and  paediatric  patients)  to  evaluate  the  eculizumab  concentration-time  profiles  in 
different sub-population of paediatric patients with different body weight ranges (5-<10 kg, 10-<20 kg, 
20-<30 kg, 30-<40 kg,  >=40 kg). Although simulated exposure with the proposed dosing regimens for 
each  sub-group  of  paediatric  patients  predicted  eculizumab  levels  at  steady-state  within  the  therapeutic 
range, a relevant increase in the exposure (1.5-2 fold) in paediatric patients from 5 to 10 kg is observed 
with the proposed dosing regimen.  
A parallel analysis was provided evaluating the PK bridging of the pop-PK model developed in aHUS/PNH 
paediatric and adult patients. This latter model incorporates a wider body weight range (4.4-127 kg), which 
could be relevant for PK prediction in patients with very low body weight. Simulated eculizumab exposure 
in adult patients ≥40 kg using the pop-PK model in paediatric/adult aHUS/PNH patients demonstrates a 
30-50% increase in the exposure in gMG adult patients compared to aHUS patients. Therefore, there is no 
clear similarity in predicted exposure between the indications. Furthermore, the correspondence of 1.3-1.5-
fold increase in exposure in adults is not directly transferable to the different weight groups of the paediatric 
population. In this sense, the selection of dosing regimens in the paediatric population should be established 
using the predictions made with the pop-PK model developed in adults with gMG.

EMA/319068/2023

In  order  to  characterize  the  PK  properties  of  eculizumab  in  paediatric  patients,  taking  into  account  that 
model predictions are highly dependent on allometric exponents values, but very little information (n=11) 
was available to fully characterize the relationship between body weight and disposition parameters (CL/Q 
and  V1/V2)  in  paediatric  patients  with  gMG,  the  Applicant  was  requested  to  provide  a  simulation-based 
analysis of the exposure at steady state across the different body-weight subgroups of paediatric patients 
using  the  pop-PK  model  in  gMG  patients  and  the  allometric  exponents  obtained  in  the  pop-PK  model  in 
aHUS/PNH,  showing  the  proportion  of  patients  below  the  efficacy  threshold  for  each  subgroup  of  body 
weight.  The  simulated  exposure  with  the  proposed  dosing  regimens  for  each  sub-group  of  paediatric 
patients  predicted  eculizumab  levels  at  steady-state  within  the  therapeutic  range.  Thus,  this  issue  was 
considered solved.  
The  Applicant  has  justified  the  absence  of  exposure  safety  analysis  indicating  that  the  exposure  safety 
analysis performed in adults did not show any exposure-response relationship and the low small sample 
size of paediatric patients did not allow a proper analysis. A preliminary exposure safety assessment has 
been performed using data from ECU-MG-303. Any TEAE occurring in 3 or more patients was studied, the 
simulated exposure was calculated based on post hoc estimates for each patient and data was divided by 
two different exposure groups (94000 to 126000 μg.h/mL, and 126000 to 267000 μg.h/mL). It is agreed 
that no new trends have been detected. However, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from this analysis. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology properties of eculizumab in paediatric patients with gMG have been characterized 
using a previously developed pop-PK model in adult gMG patients and updating pop-PK parameters with 
the  experimental  evidence  collected  in  study  ECU-MG-303.  The  data  analysis,  model  development  and 
model evaluation are endorsed. Then, a simulation analysis has been conducted in paediatric gMG patients 
below 37 kg, which supports the dose recommendation in this sub-group of patients.

The primary evaluation treatment period of 26 weeks defines the time period for the assessment of the 
study  endpoints.  There  is  also  a  screening  period  of  2  to  4  weeks  and  an  extension  period  of  up  to  an 
additional 208 weeks still ongoing. 
In case of withdrawal or discontinuation from the study or eculizumab treatment at any time, the patient 
is required to complete an Early Termination Visit at the time of withdrawal and a Follow-up Visit 8 weeks 
after the last dose of eculizumab. The overall study duration for an individual patient is estimated to be up 
to 246 weeks (from Screening through the end of the Safety Follow-up).

Treatments 
Eculizumab  was  initiated  with  a  weekly  weight-based  induction  regimen.  Thereafter,  patients  are  dosed 
every 2 weeks. Dosing was initiated with a weekly weight-based induction regimen; thereafter, patients 
are dosed every 2 weeks. The dosage regimen was based on the paediatric patient’s body weight: 
Table 18: Dosage regimen 
a Dosage regimen is based on the current visit’s recorded body weight. If site/institution policies prohibit study drug to be prepared on 
the day of visit, the weight from the most recent study visit is to be used.  
b During the initial Induction Phase, if a patient’s weight increased or decreased resulting in a change in weight cohort, the Alexion Medical 
Monitor had to be contacted prior to dosing.  
c Induction and Maintenance Phase dosage regimens are identical to that of approved dosing 
For  patients  who  enter  the  study  on  maintenance  IVIg  treatment,  a  series  of  supplemental  doses  of 
eculizumab were administered to account for the anticipated approximately 50% increase in eculizumab 
clearance:

Notes: The timing of supplemental eculizumab dosing varied by IVIg frequency and is provided below: 
• If a patient continues to receive IVIg treatment at a dose cycle interval equal to or more frequent than every 4 weeks during eculizumab treatment, a 
supplemental dose is to be administered at the same time that each scheduled dose of eculizumab is administered. 
• If a patient receives IVIg treatment at a dose cycle interval less frequent than every 4 weeks during eculizumab treatment, a supplemental dose is to 
be administered following the last dose of the IVIg infusion cycle at the next scheduled eculizumab dose. 
•  If  a  patient  receives  IVIg  treatment  within  4  weeks  prior  to  receiving  the  first  dose  of  eculizumab,  a  supplemental  dose  of  eculizumab  is  to  be 
administered at the same time that the first dose of eculizumab is administered (ie, the total dose is the supplemental dose plus the first scheduled dose). 
a Dosage regimen is based on the current visit’s recorded body weight. If site/institution policies prohibit study drug to be prepared on the day of visit, 
the weight from the most recent study visit is to be used. 
b During the initial Induction Phase, if a patient’s weight increased or decreased resulting in a change in weight cohort, the Alexion Medical Monitor 
had to be contacted prior to dosing. 
c Only patients in 15 – 20 kg weight category are to be included in this group.

(12  to  <  18  years  of  age)  only  and  was  used  for  analyses  of  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints 
during the 26-week Primary Evaluation Treatment Period. 
The  PK  analyses  Set  is  the  population  on  which  all  PK  analyses  were  performed  and  consists  of  all 
patients how have PK data assessments during the study. 
The extension analysis set consists of all patients who received at least 1 dose of eculizumab during 
the extension period. 
Efficacy Analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the QMG total score over time regardless of 
rescue treatment, using the mFAS Population. A repeated measures model was used to analyse observed 
change in QMG with baseline QMG score and visits as covariates. The least-squares (LS) mean at week 12 
was used to test the primary hypothesis (2-sided) at a significance level of 5%. The least-squares mean at 
Week 26 was used to test the PDCO-specific primary hypothesis at a significance level of 5%. The p-value, 
standard error of the mean, and 95% confidence interval (CI) were produced. 
As for QMG responders measured as secondary efficacy endpoints the proportion of patients with a ≥ 5-
point reduction in the QMG total score from baseline with no rescue therapy prior to the given visits as well 
as  without  regard  to  rescue  therapy  were  summarized  by  visit.  Exact  (Clopper-Pearson)  CIs  for  true 
proportion and p-values were presented by visit. 
The  following  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  that  involve  changes  from  baseline  regardless  of  rescue 
treatment during the primary 26-week treatment period were summarized and analysed in a similar way 
as  was  described  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint QMG  using  the  mFAS  Population: Myasthenia  Gravis 
Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) total score, Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) total score, European 
Quality of Life 5-Dimension Youth version (EQ-5D-Y) and Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-
QoL) Paediatric Fatigue 
Also, the proportion of patients with a ≥ 3-point reduction in the MG-ADL total score from baseline with no 
rescue therapy prior to the given visits as well as without regard to rescue therapy were summarized by 
visit. CIs and p-values were presented by visit. 
MGFA post-interventional status during the first 26 weeks was summarized. 
The  number  and  percentage  of  patients  with  at  least  1  on-study  clinical  deterioration  and/or  MG  crisis 
during  the  first  26  weeks  were  summarized.  Use  of  rescue  therapy  during  the  first  26  weeks  was  also 
summarized.

For  the  analysis  of  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints,  summary  statistics  were  provided  of 
actual results and changes from baseline results at each visit by the status of maintenance IVIg at study 
entry [yes, no], and overall patients in the mFAS. 
For  the  summary  efficacy  analyses,  there  were  no  planned  imputation  of  missing  or  partially  missing 
baseline or post-baseline assessments, regardless of the efficacy endpoint analysed. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  16  patients  were  screened,  and  12  (75.0%)  patients  were  enrolled  in  the  study.  Four  (25%)

Clinical Deteriorations, Myasthenia Crises, and Use of Rescue Therapy 
Per protocol, clinical deterioration requiring the use of on-study rescue therapy is defined as: 
• Patients who experience an MG crisis, which is defined as weakness due to MG that is severe enough to 
necessitate intubation or to delay extubation following surgery; or, 
• Significant symptomatic worsening that requires rescue medication in the opinion of the Investigator; or, 
• Patients for whom the Investigator believes that the patients’ health is in jeopardy if rescue therapy is 
not given. 
One (9.1%) patient experienced clinical deterioration (MG crisis) during the primary evaluation treatment 
period. The patient was treated with plasmapheresis/PE that was administered between the week 22 and 
week 24 study visits.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The evidence of the efficacy of Soliris (eculizumab) in the treatment of paediatric patients with refractory 
generalised Myasthenia Gravis and AChR-Ab (+) is provided by one phase 3 clinical trial (Study ECU-MG-
303), still ongoing. 
The use of eculizumab (an anti-C5 mAb) in this population is based on the approved use in adult patients 
and  the  claimed  similarity  of  the  condition  in  both  populations.  The  majority  of  patients  with  MG  have 
antibodies against AChR. These antibodies bind complement and initiate the complement cascade producing 
a complement-mediated lysis of the neuromuscular junction via formation of membrane attack complexes. 
Eculizumab  targets  the  complement  protein  C5,  inhibiting  its  cleavage  into  C5a  and  C5b  and  ultimately 
preventing the formation of terminal complement complex.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This  submission  is  based  on  data  from  Study  ECU-MG-303,  a  Phase  3,  multicentre,  open-label  study  to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of eculizumab for the treatment of paediatric patients aged 6 to < 18 years 
with  refractory  gMG  AChR-Ab+.  Data  from  the  26-week  initial  phase  (the  primary  evaluation  treatment 
period) have been submitted; the extension phase (extension period) is still ongoing and no efficacy results 
from this phase have been presented. The study was conducted in Japan and USA.  
Patient population 
Paediatric patients 6 to <18 years of age with confirmed gMG who were positive for AChR antibodies were 
eligible  for  the  study.  The  study  enrolled  symptomatic  patients  (QMG  total  score  ≥  12)  who  have  an 
insufficient clinical response to ongoing, stable standard of care therapy.   
Eculizumab is approved in adult patients with refractory condition. Adult patients included in study ECU-
MG-301  were  required  to  have  failed  to  at  least  2  previous  treatments  according  the  international 
consensus 20.  This  is  not  exactly  the  criteria  applied  to  paediatric  patients  who  were  required  to  have 
refractory condition defined as having failed treatment ≥1 year with at least 1 immunosuppressive therapies 
or requiring PE or IVIg to control symptoms, or having a significant functional burden despite current MG 
treatment. The MAH has explained that a clear definition of refractoriness in MG in pediatric patients is not 
currently  available.  Considering  the  characteristics  of  the  patients  included  in  the  study  with  respect  to 
failure to previous treatments and the symptomatic condition in spite of the concomitant treatment received 
during the study (see below), it could be justified to consider pediatric patients in Study ECU-MG-303 as 
meeting the definition of refractory. This is accepted.  
Patients could have been treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, IVIg, and ISTs during the study at 
stable doses. Patients having received recent treatment with rituximab or PE were excluded as well as those 
who had been previously treated with eculizumab. 
A total of 16 patients were screened and 12 (75.0%) patients were enrolled in the study. One patient in 
the age group < 12 years withdrew from the study before study drug administration. In total, 11 patients 
received  the  study  drug.  As  of  the  data  cut-off  date  (06  Jan  2022),  a  total  of  10  patients  entered  the 
extension period. One patient has not completed the primary evaluation treatment period yet. The patient 
did not respond to treatment and experienced a clinical deterioration a month before their Week 26 visit. 
Rescue therapy was administered. By their week 26 visit (delayed), the patient contracted COVID-19 and 
did not continue into the extension period which is still ongoing. 
The clinical outcome in childhood MG varies with age of onset, race, and sex21. Remission rates also appear 
to be influenced by ethnic origin.22 African American children show lower remission rates than Caucasian 
children.  In Asian population more than 70% of cases are restricted to ocular symptoms and benign course 
is common. White children with prepubertal onset have the best prognosis. The spontaneous remission rate 
is 44 percent in these children, and they respond well to early thymectomy.26 
Most of the patients included in the study were female (81.8%). Only 18.2% of the recruited patients were 
White, being Black or African American (45.5%) followed by Asian (27.3%) patients the most represented 
groups.  No  EU  patients  were  recruited.  Mean  age  was  14.8  years  (ranging  from  12  to  17  years).  The 
majority of patients (90.9%) were ≥40 kg. Thus, it was questioned whether the studied patients could be 
considered as representative of the intended population, that is, EU paediatric patients.

With regards to the ethnicity, the MAH has explained that no significant impact on exposure and terminal 
complement inhibition has been observed  in a Pop-PK analysis in adult gMG patients by ethnicity and no 
relevant  differences  in    the  treatment  effect  of  eculizumab  in  adults  has  been  reported  in  the  literature 
when  ethnic  differences  were  explored.  It  can,  therefore,  be  expected  that  the  response  in  the  target 
population would not be dissimilar to that observed in Study ECU-MG-303. This justification could be agreed.  
No children less than 12 years of age participated in the study. Although limited (low patient availability), 
some data on PK, efficacy and safety were expected in this subset. Main differences in the disease between 
younger patients compared with adults are a less severe disease, often with an ocular phenotype and a 
better prognosis, with more frequent spontaneous remission.  The diagnosis is difficult to be done in the 
very young age group. Positive acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibodies are present only in 41% of cases 
presenting with ocular symptoms alone and 72% of those with generalized symptoms23. As the requested 
indication includes a subgroup of the broad paediatric MG population, - namely those with AChR Ab positive, 
treatment  refractory,  generalised  MG-,  patients  without  AChR  antibodies,  patients  not  converting  from 
ocular to generalised MG, patients with mild disease that responds to already established treatments, and 
spontaneous  remissions  have  already  been  excluded,  regardless  of  age.  With  these  restrictions  already 
included in the indication, the differences between age populations might be reduced and it can be agreed 
that based on a similar pathophysiology and phenotype, extrapolation of efficacy to children aged ≥6 years 
is adequate. Of note, regarding the PIP, a waiver was granted in the paediatric population from birth to less 
than 6 years of age for the condition treatment of myasthenia gravis on the grounds that clinical studies 
with the specific medicinal product cannot be expected to be of significant therapeutic benefit to or fulfil a 
therapeutic need of the specified paediatric subset. This explain the chosen cut-off. 
The most common presenting type in the recruited patients was gMG (90.9%) with a mean duration of the 
condition of 4 years from diagnosis. Most of patients had a mild to moderate weakness affecting muscles 
other than the ocular muscles (45.5% MGFA Class II) and 27% presented a severe generalized MG (MGFA 
Class  IV).  A  relevant  percentage  has  had  an  exacerbation  (63.6%)  or  had  required  ventilatory  support 
(72.7%) in the past. Half of the patient underwent thymectomy (54.5%), which is expected since it is a 
recommended  treatment  in  case  of  generalized  weakness 24 .  Acetylcholinesterase  inhibitors  (82%), 
corticosteroids  (82%)  and  chronic  IVIg  (63.6%)  were  the  most  widely  used  MG  treatments  prior  to  the 
study. Two (18.2%) patients had not used any ISTs (including corticosteroids). Three (27.3%) patients had 
used only 1 IST and 6 (54.5%) patients had used 2 ISTs. Tacrolimus was the most frequently IST (different 
from corticosteroids) used followed by mycophenolate mofetil (27.3% and 18.2%, respectively).  
At baseline, the mean (SD) MG-ADL total score was 5.0 (5.25), and the mean (SD) QMG total score was 
16.7 (5.64) showing a relevant disease burden. During the study patients were concomitantly treated with 
cholinesterase inhibitors (81.8%), long-term IVIg (54.5%) and ISTs [4 (36.4%) 1 IST and 5 (45.5%) 2 
ISTs]:  corticosteroids  (72.7%),  tacrolimus  (27.3%),  mycophenolate  mofetil  (18.2%),  and  azathioprine 
(9.1%). 
Treatment regimen 
No  specific  dose-response  studies  have  been  conducted  for  this  indication.  Patients  received  a  weekly 
weight-based  induction  regimen.  The  selected  dosing  regimens  were  those  previously  approved  for 
paediatric patients with aHUS and PNH based on the patient’s body weight. Since the study did not include 
patients younger than 12 years of age and there was only 1 patient in the body weight range 30 to 40 kg, 
10 out of 11 subjects received the dosing regimen for adult patients. Nevertheless, an acceptable estimation 
of  the  dose  by  weight  for  children,  covering  the  weight  of  6–12-year-olds  could  be  agreed  (see 
pharmacological section)

Endpoints 
Efficacy was based on the effect of eculizumab on the gMG signs and symptoms assessed by the physician 
(QMG scale; primary endpoint) and the patient (MG-ADL; secondary variable).  
These endpoints and the rest of the selected efficacy variables are validated and widely used scales in the 
clinical development of medicinal product for the treatment of MG in adults. They are also used in clinical 
investigation in paediatric patients although with a limited experience (EudraCT Numbers: 2021-002460-
46; 2021-002479-20).  
Statistical analysis 
A sample size of 12 patients older than 12 years of age was estimated. No predefined number of younger 
patients (6 to <12 years of age) was established. The sample size was defined by the low availability of 
patients given the rarity of the condition, which is acknowledged.  
The primary analysis was based on the change from baseline in the QMG total score at 26 weeks regardless 
of whether patients received rescue therapy. A repeated measures model was used to analyse the observed 
change  in  QMG  with  baseline  QMG  score  and  visits  as  covariates.  According  to  the  MAH,  the  mFAS 
Population (including patients 12 to < 18 years of age who received at least 1 dose of eculizumab) was 
used for the analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints, whereas the FAS Population (including all 
patients  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  eculizumab)  was  used  for  all  other  efficacy  results  summaries. 
Both analysis populations (FAS and mFAS) were identical.  
The small number of subjects included in Study ECU-MG-303, the lack of a control arm and the observed 
variability  as  well  as  the  fluctuating  nature  of  the  condition  add  uncertainty  to  the  estimation  of  the 
magnitude of the effect with a potential of overestimating the effect.  
IVIg  treatment  is  likely  to  increase  eculizumab  clearance  50%,  resulting  in  lowered  trough  eculizumab 
concentrations.  For  this  reason,  patients  receiving  maintenance  IVIg  receiving  supplemental  doses  of 
eculizumab. However, patients who received maintenance IVIg therapy were shown to have higher mean 
eculizumab exposures than patients who did not receive maintenance IVIg therapy. The influence of the 
chronic treatment with IVIg was also analysed.  
An  extrapolation  study  (study  3)  has  been  conducted  by  the  MAH  comparing  the  results  obtained  in 
eculizumab  studies  in  adult  patients  with  gMG  (ECU-MG-301)  and  the  data  from  Study  ECU-MG-303  in 
paediatric gMG patients. The approach is based on the similarity in the dosage regimen administered in 
both  studies  and  the  efficacy  variables  measured.  Given  the  differences  between  studies  in  population 
included,  design  of  the  studies  and  sample  size  only  a  qualitative  comparison  is  performed,  which  is 
acceptable as supportive information.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The evaluation of efficacy mainly relies on the assessment of the gMG signs and symptoms by the physician 
(QMG; primary endpoint) and the patient (MG-ADL; secondary endpoint).  
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the QMG total score reported by the physician. At 
Week 26 a 5.8-point reduction was observed in comparison with baseline score (95% CI: -8.40, -3.13; p 
= 0.0004) (mFAS).  
The  effect  of  eculizumab  was  also  assessed  by  the  patient  as  a  secondary  endpoint.  At  Week  26  an 
improvement was observed in MG-ADL total score of -2.3 ([CI: -3.6, -1.03]; p=0.0017) (mFAS). 
A relevant percentage of patients showed control of the disease: 70% of patients showed ≥ 5 point reduction 
in the QMG total score and 50% of patients showed ≥ 3 point reduction in the MG-ADL total score. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319068/2023 
Page 64/85 
 
 
 
 
MGC Scale results are in line with those observed for MG-ADL and QMG total scores. At Week 26 patients 
experienced a 8.8-point reduction with respect to baseline ([95% CI: -12.9, -4.69; p=0.0007) (mFAS).   
This improvement was also observed when the effect of eculizumab on health status (EQ-5D-Y VAS) and 
fatigue (Neuro-QoL Paediatric Fatigue) was measured. 
One of the patients suffered a MG crisis during the primary evaluation treatment period and was treated 
with plasmapheresis/PE between the week 22 and week 24 study visits. It is said that the patient remained 
ongoing in the primary evaluation treatment period of the study as of the data cut-off date. A total of 4 
patients (14 events) required hospitalization during this period, 3 of them (12 events) being considered 
MG-related, not due to study treatment. 
The main effect was reached at Week 4 followed by a plateau phase maintained throughout the 26-week 
Primary  Evaluation  Treatment  Period  without  further  benefit.  No  efficacy  data  are  available  beyond  this 
point so that the maintenance of the effect in this population is unknown. The study is still ongoing and 
results up to additional 208 Weeks are expected.  
When the effect is analysed by the use or not of maintenance IVIg, it seems to be of lower magnitude in 
those patients chronically treated with IVIg. However, not all the efficacy results point in the same direction 
and the reduced number of patients prevents from drawing a conclusion on whether the efficacy may vary 
depending  on  the  use  of  IVIg  as  maintenance  IST.  Of  note,  the  reported  PK  data  in  patients  receiving 
maintenance IVIg therapy and Soliris supplemental doses show an increased exposure of eculizumab (see 
clinical pharmacology section). The MAH has justified the need of supplemental doses of eculizumab when 
IVIg therapy is concomitantly administered, based on faster mAb clearance. Further, the MAH provided a 
new  analysis  for  PK  /  PD  modelling  in  which  it  can  be  agreed  that  the  distribution  of  the  Exposure  of 
Eculizumab  (PK)  vs.  inhibition  of  terminal  complement    (free  C5  <  0.5  µg/mL)  (PD)  overlaps  for  those 
children using standard dose regimen (no IVIg-treatment) and standard dose regimen plus supplemental 
dosing  (IVIg-treated  patients).  Whether  the  apparently  reduced  efficacy  observed  in  those  patients 
compared to those not receiving concomitant IVIg therapy can be (solely) explained from the PK perspective 
remains unclear. This information has been added to the SmPC.  
The  extrapolation  study  (study  3)  conducted  to  supplement efficacy  data  from  the use  of  eculizumab  in 
adult patients with gMG (Study ECU-MG-301) suggests a similar trend in the efficacy results measured in 
the populations included in both studies. Further, as noted above, with these restrictions already included 
in the indication, the differences between age populations are sufficiently reduced and it can be agreed that 
based on a similar pathophysiology and phenotype, extrapolation of efficacy to children aged ≥6 years is 
adequate.

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of eculizumab on the treatment of gMG in paediatric patients has been established in a single 
open label study (Study ECU-MG-303) including a total of 11 patients > 12 years of age. However, taken 
into account the target indication including paediatric patients with refractory gMG and anti-AChR antibodies 
positive, it can be agreed that based on a similar pathophysiology and phenotype, and the estimation of 
the dose recommendation in this sub-group of patients, the extrapolation of efficacy to children aged ≥6 
years is adequate in light of the provided efficacy data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319068/2023

Eculizumab has shown an effect on the control of symptoms assessed by the physician (QMG score; primary 
endpoint) and by the patient (MG-ADL score, secondary endpoint) in the studied patients after 26 weeks 
of treatment with respect to baseline values. However, the small number of subjects, the lack of a control 
arm,  the  observed  variability  as  well  as  the  fluctuating  nature  of  the  condition  add  uncertainty  to  the 
estimation of the magnitude of the effect with a potential of overestimating the effect. Further, long-term 
efficacy in paediatric gMG population is based on the effect of eculizumab during the extension period of 
the study, still ongoing. No efficacy results have been provided beyond the 26 Week time point.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety of eculizumab in paediatric patients with AChR-Ab + refractory gMG is based on data from Study 
ECU-MG-303  and  supplementary  data  from  other  studies  with  eculizumab  that  were  conducted  in  adult 
patients with refractory gMG, paediatric patients with PNH, and paediatric and adult patients with aHUS. 
As for the data from Study ECU-MG-303 the MAH has submitted the safety analysis results from the 26-
week  primary  evaluation  treatment  period  and  extension  period  up  to  the  data  cut-off  date  (safety  and 
immunogenicity analyses) for all patients who were enrolled in the study. 
Patient exposure 
•  Study ECU-MG-303: As of 06 Jan 2022 (data cut-off date for the interim clinical study report), a total 
of  11  patients  aged  12  to  <  18  years  were  enrolled  and  treated,  including  6  patients  who  were  on 
maintenance IVIg treatment at baseline (for at least 12 months and on a stable dose ≥ 3 months prior 
to  Screening).  Ten  patients  completed  the  primary  evaluation  treatment  period  and  were  ongoing 
during the extension period. 
The median treatment duration of the primary evaluation treatment period was 24.1 weeks (range 23.9 
to  26.4  weeks).  The  median  treatment  duration of  the  primary  evaluation  treatment  period  and  the 
extension period up to the data cut-off date (06 Jan 2022) was 95.1 weeks. 
One patient missed 1 scheduled maintenance dose at Week 8 during the primary evaluation treatment 
period due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure. Another patient missed 2 maintenance 
doses at Weeks 28 and 30 during the extension period due to COVID-19. 
•  Supplementary  Safety  Data  from  Eculizumab  Studies  in  Adult  Patients  with  Refractory  gMG, 
Paediatric Patients with PNH, and Paediatric and Adult Patients with aHUS.

AEs of special interest 
AEs of special interest for eculizumab include meningococcal infections, Aspergillus spp infections, sepsis, 
other  serious  infections,  and  infusion  reactions.  No  events  of  sepsis,  meningococcal,  or  Aspergillus  spp 
infections were reported.  
During  the  primary  evaluation  treatment  period,  1  patient  experienced  4  events  of  eczema.  During  the 
extension period (as of the data cutoff date), this same patient experienced 3 additional events of eczema 
and 1 event each of rash and urticaria. According to the medical history, this patient experienced recurrent 
rash due to IVIg. One patient experienced a serious infection (TESAE) during the Extension Period. 
Adverse Events in Studies Providing Supplementary Safety Data 
Paediatric and adult refractory gMG TEAE or TESAE data are similar to that from paediatric patients with 
PNH and paediatric and adult patients with aHUS. Overall, most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity 
and assessed as unrelated to the study drug by the Investigator.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No TESAEs were reported during the primary evaluation treatment period.  
During the extension period (as of the data cut-off date), 6 TESAEs were reported by 3 (27.3%) patients. 
Two  patients  had  TESAEs  that  were  related  to  MG.  One  patient  experienced  MG  crisis  and  1  patient 
experienced  3  episodes  of  MG  worsening  together  with  pyrexia  during  the  first  episode.  One  patient 
experienced a serious infection , which was assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator. None of 
the TESAEs resulted in a change in study drug dose or study drug discontinuation. 
No patients died due to TEAEs in the paediatric and adult studies in refractory gMG, the paediatric study in 
PNH, and in 2 of the 4 paediatric and adult studies in aHUS (Studies C08-002A/B and C10-003). One (5%) 
adult patient with aHUS died in Study C08-003A/B, and 2 (6.7%) patients, (1 adult and 1 paediatric patient) 
with aHUS died in Study C09-001r (Table 40). Patients who discontinued from the study due to TEAEs were 
reported in Study ECU-MG-301 (adult patients with refractory gMG) (4 [6.5%] patients) and in 1 patient in 
Study C08-002A/B (paediatric and adult patients with aHUS) (1 [5.9%] patient). 
Laboratory findings 
As of the data cut-off date for the interim analysis, no clinically significant changes in clinical chemistry and 
haematology  were  observed.  Shifts  in  laboratory  parameters  were  infrequent,  and  none  of  the  patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/319068/2023

experienced abnormalities that were moderate or severe in severity. Only mild laboratory-related TEAEs 
were reported during the study. 
There were no clinically meaningful mean changes from Baseline in temperature, heart rate, respiratory 
rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure at each postbaseline visit. The change from baseline in mean 
body weight values at any postbaseline visit was not clinically. 
There were no relevant changes from baseline in ECGs for all parameters tested. Abnormalities in corrected 
QT  interval  (QTc),  corrected  QT  interval  by  Bazett’s  formula  (QTcB),  and  corrected  QT  interval  by 
Fredericia’s formula (QTcF) were infrequent. At week 12, changes from Baseline in QTc, QTcB, and QTcF of 
> 30 milliseconds to ≤ 60 milliseconds were recorded for 1 (9.1%) patient (QTc) and 2 (22.2%) patients 
(QTcB and QTcF) at week 12 and for 2 (20.0%) patients (QTc) at week 26. No patients had a change from 
Baseline in QTc, QTcB, and QTcF of > 60 milliseconds. 
There were no clinically significant abnormal physical examination findings observed for any patient. 
No treatment-emergent ADA responses were observed following eculizumab treatment. 
Safety in special populations 
No  analysis  of  safety  data  by  subgroups  or  situations  (e.g.  drug  abuse,  overdose,  drug  interactions)  in 
Study ECU-MG-303 was performed due to the small sample size 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  drug  interaction  analyses  with  eculizumab  were  conducted  in  the  eculizumab  clinical  development 
program. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
During primary evaluation treatment period, no patients died or discontinued the study due to a TEAE. 
During the extension period (as of the data cut-off date), none of the TESAEs resulted in a change in study 
drug dose or study drug discontinuation. 
Post marketing experience 
Overall, the estimated postmarketing exposure to eculizumab since the first Marketing Authorization (16 
Mar 2007) through 30 Sep 2021 was 70678.8 patient-years for all indications. 
The MAH closely monitors the following risks for eculizumab in the postmarketing setting: 
• Important identified risk: meningococcal infections, serious infections (including sepsis), Aspergillus spp 
infection, severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications due to drug discontinuation in aHUS patients, 
and infusion reactions 
• Important potential risk: serious hemolysis after drug discontinuation in PNH patients, malignancies and 
hematologic  abnormalities  in  PNH  patients,  immunogenicity,  and  serious  infection  in  neonates  after 
maternal exposure to eculizumab 
• Missing information: none 
Meningococcal Infection 
Assessment report  
EMA/319068/2023 
Page 73/85 
 
 
 
 
As of 01 Oct 2021, the cumulative postmarketing reporting rate for meningococcal infection has remained 
stable  at  0.25  per  100  patient-years  (181  cases  per  70678.8  patient-years).  Of  the  181  postmarketing 
cases, 16.6% (30 cases) of the meningococcal cases were reported in paediatric patients (age < 18 years). 
Serious Infections (Including Sepsis) 
As of 01 Oct 2021, the cumulative postmarketing rate of serious infections is approximately 9.83 per 100 
patient-years (6945 cases per 70678.8 patient-years). Of the 6945 postmarketing cases, 8.6% (599 cases) 
of serious infections were reported in paediatric patients (age < 18 years). 
Aspergillus spp Infection 
As of 01 Oct 2021, the cumulative postmarketing rate of Aspergillus spp infection is approximately 0.10 
per 100 patient-years (72 cases per 70678.8 patient-years). Of the 72 postmarketing cases, 15.3% (11 
cases) of the Aspergillus spp infection cases were reported in paediatric patients (age < 18 years). 
Infusion Reactions 
As of 01 Oct 2021, the cumulative postmarketing rate of infusion reactions is approximately 0.73 per 100 
patient-years (517 cases per 70678.8 patient-years). Of the 517 postmarketing cases, 19.9% (103 cases) 
of the infusion reactions were reported in paediatric patients (age < 18 years). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Eculizumab is currently approved for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with PNH and aHUS and 
for the treatment of adults with gMG and NMOSD. The first marketing authorization was granted on 20 Jun 
2007. The safety profile of eculizumab is reasonably established.  
The safety of eculizumab in paediatric patients with gMG has been evaluated in one phase 3 study (study 
ECU-MG-303) which includes a 26-week treatment period and an extension period still ongoing. The safety 
data are available up to the data cut-off date of 06 June 2022 (median study duration of 96 weeks). 
A  total  of  11  patients  aged  ≥  12  to  <  18  years  were  exposed  to  eculizumab  in  the p rimary  evaluation 
treatment period of Study ECU-MG-303. It represents a very limited safety database  
These  11  patients  have  been  exposed  to  eculizumab  a  median  treatment  duration  of  95.1  weeks.  The 
patients received a mean of 14.9 infusions per patient in this period. A total of 122 supplemental infusions 
were administered. As of the data cut-off date treatment compliance was 100% for 9 (81.8%) patients and 
≥ 90% to < 100% for 2 (18.2%) patients.  
As for the demographic and disease baseline characteristics, 81.8% of patients were women and the mean 
age was 14.8 years. All the patients treated in the study were > 12 years of age. The study was conducted 
in USA and Japan. Only 18.2% of the patients were White, being Black or African American (45.5%) followed 
by  Asian  (27.3%)  patients  the  most  represented  groups.  According  to  the  MAH  no  differences  in 
eculizumab’s safety profile due to age, gender, race and ethnicity have been observed across the entirety 
of eculizumab clinical development program. This could be agreed. 
In  order  to  complete  the  safety  profile  in  the  paediatric  population  and  provide  some  reference  for 
comparison,  supplementary  data  from  eculizumab  studies  in  adults  with  gMG  and  other  paediatric 
indications (PNH, aHUS) have been also submitted. In paediatric patients with refractory gMG (aged 12 to 
less than 18 years) included in Study ECU MG 303, the safety profile appeared similar to that observed in 
adult patients with refractory gMG, based on an extrapolation study (study 3). 
The safety database includes 20 adolescents (12 to 18 years of age) and 34 children (<12 years of age) 
with  PNH/aHUS.  This  supportive  safety  population  shows  other  demographic  differences  with  respect  to 
Assessment report  
EMA/319068/2023 
Page 74/85 
 
 
 
 
that included in the Study ECU-MG-303, such as higher proportion of males and the predominance of White 
or Caucasian patients. In addition, paediatric PNH patients weighing >40 kg received lower induction and 
maintenance  doses  than  patients  in  study  ECU-MG-303.  According  to  the  MAH,  there  is  no  evidence 
suggesting a different safety profile in pediatric patients with refractory gMG. This could be agreed. 
During the 26-week primary evaluation treatment period of Study ECU-MG-303, 40 TEAEs were experienced 
by 10 (90.9%) patients.  
As of the data cut-off date, 127 TEAEs were reported by 11 (100%) patients. A total of 4 (36.4%) patients 
during primary evaluation treatment period of the study and 5 (45.5%) patients as of the data cut-off date 
reported a TEAE assessed to be related to study drug, 
During the study the most frequently reported TEAEs were headache (4 [36.4%] patients), nasopharyngitis 
(4 [36.4%] patients), pyrexia (3 [27.3%] patients), and pain in extremity (3 [27.3%] patients). All these 
AEs are already included in the SmPC of Soliris.  
During the initial period of treatment (first 12 weeks) none of the AEs was reported in more than 1 patient. 
The limited number of patients exposed prevent from an adequate characterisation of the safety profile in 
this population. The safety profile reported in the other paediatric indications (with a total database still 
limited even for frequent AEs) is deemed to be similar to that observed in adult patients.  
No TESAEs were reported during the primary evaluation treatment period. During the extension period (as 
of the data cutoff date), 3 (27.3%) patients reported 6 TESAEs: 1 patient experienced MG crisis, 1 patient 
experienced 3 episodes of MG worsening (one of them with pyrexia). All these TESAEs were related to MG. 
One  patient  experienced  a  serious  infection,  which  was  assessed  as  related  to  study  drug  by  the 
Investigator. None of the TESAEs resulted in a change in study drug dose or study drug discontinuation. 
No events of sepsis, meningococcal, or Aspergillus spp infections (considered as adverse events of special 
interest) were reported. No patients died or discontinued the study due to a TEAE. No clinically significant 
changes in clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs or ECG were observed. No ADA response was detected 
following eculizumab treatment.  
One of the gMG patients reported several events of eczema, not currently included in the SmPC (MedRA 
Organ System Class of Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders). However, eczema was reported as AEs in 
paediatric aHUS patients25.   
The postmarketing data do not seem to show any new safety concern.   
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
See above 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety database of eculizumab in the applied indication is considered very limited. Although the small 
size of the safety database is not unexpected considering the rarity of the condition, the limited number of 
patients included in the study ECU-MG-303 prevents from completely characterising the safety profile of 
eculizumab  in  this  population.  However,  the  limited  safety  database  in  paediatric  gMG  patients  can  be 
considered supported by safety data of eculizumab in paediatric patients with other conditions and safety 
data  in  adult  patients  with  refractory  gMG.  In  this  regard,  the  safety  data  from  paediatric  patients  with 
refractory gMG are consistent with the known safety profile of eculizumab in adult patients with refractory

gMG, paediatric patients with PNH, and paediatric and adult patients with aHUS. No new AEs have been 
reported in this new population. Further, the extension phase of the study is ongoing. The MAH is expected 
to submit the results when available in order to complete the long-term safety assessment.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH has taken the opportunity to update section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to update the 
frequency of the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) based on cumulative safety data, to update the ATC 
code as per the new WHO guidelines and to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI.  
In  addition,  the list  of  local  representatives  in  the  PL  has  been  revised  to  amend  contact  details  for the 
representative(s) of all MS as this was missing in the PL.   
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
• The content and format of information related to the paediatric population with refractory gMG are very 
similar to that of refractory gMG indication in the adult patient population, except for the additional efficacy 
results information related to the paediatric portion of refractory gMG indication; 
• There were no specific or new risk added concerning the paediatric population with refractory gMG.  
• The medicinal product is already approved for other paediatric indications (PNH, aHUS). 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
gMG  is  an  autoimmune  disorder  characterized  by  skeletal  muscle  weakness  and  fatigability  caused  by 
autoantibody-induced neurotransmission dysfunction at the neuromuscular junction.  
Assessment report  
EMA/319068/2023 
Page 78/85 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric MG is rare, representing about 10–15% of total cases of MG. JMG is acquired MG not related to 
structural disorders, occurring in childhood or adolescence (i.e. <18 years of age)26. 
The purpose of this application is to extend the generalized myasthenia gravis indication for eculizumab to 
include paediatric patients with refractory AChR-Ab + gMG. The proposed indication is the following:  
“Soliris  is  indicated  in  adults and  children  for  the  treatment  of  refractory  generalized  myasthenia  gravis 
(gMG) in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive.” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment of JMG is similar to adult myasthenia gravis and typically involves a combination of symptomatic 
(anticholinesterase  inhibitors),  IST  (steroids  and  other  immunosuppressants),  with  thymectomy  in 
appropriate cases. Maintenance PLEX or IVIg are alternatives to IST in JMG. Most of the current practice 
on  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  JMG  in  children  is  extrapolated  from  adult  trials  and  experience  on  the 
treatment of gMG. None of the available therapies are specifically approved for paediatric MG. 
The condition may be life threatening due to swallowing and breathing muscle weakness. Over the longer 
term, it may be associated with significant disability and morbidity together with the AEs associated with 
the  steroids  and  immunosuppressants  use,  in  particular  concerning  growth  and  immune-system 
development in young children. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The eculizumab clinical development program in paediatric population with refractory gMG includes:  
•  Study ECU-MG-303: A Phase 3 open label, uncontrolled, multicentre study to evaluate efficacy, safety 
and PK/PD of eculizumab in paediatric patients from 6 to < 18 years of age with refractory AChR-Ab + 
gMG (ongoing). 
•  A modelling and simulation study to evaluate the use and support dosage regimen of eculizumab in 
paediatric patients from 6 to < 18 years of age with refractory AChRAb+ gMG. 
•  An extrapolation study to evaluate the efficacy, PK/PD, and safety of eculizumab in paediatric patients 
from 6 to < 18 years of age with refractory AChR-Ab+ gMG.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Efficacy was based on the effect of eculizumab on the gMG signs and symptoms assessed by the physician 
(QMG  scale;  primary  endpoint)  and  the  patient  (MG-ADL;  secondary  variable).  At  week  26  a  5.8-point 
reduction in the QMG total score reported by the physician was observed in comparison with baseline score 
(95%  CI:  -8.40,  -3.13;  p  =  0.0004).  When  the  effect  was  assessed  from  the  patient  perspective,  an 
improvement was observed in MG-ADL total score of -2.3 ([95% CI: -3.6, -1.03]; p=0.0017). MGC Scale 
results are in line with those observed for MG-ADL and QMG total scores. At week 26 patients experienced 
an 8.8-point reduction with respect to baseline ([95% CI: -12.9, -4.69; p=0.0007) (mFAS).  
A relevant percentage of patients showed control of the disease: 70% of patients showed ≥ 5 point reduction 
in the QMG total score and 50% of patients showed ≥ 3 point reduction in the MG-ADL total score. 
This improvement was also observed when the effect of eculizumab on health status (EQ-5D-Y VAS) and 
fatigue (Neuro-QoL Paediatric Fatigue) was measured.

Similar to what was observed in adult gMG patients, the main effect was reached at Week 4 followed by a 
plateau phase maintained throughout the 26-week primary evaluation treatment period.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Globally, the small number of subjects included in Study ECU-MG-303, the lack of a control arm and the 
observed variability as well as the fluctuating nature of the condition add uncertainty to the estimation of 
the magnitude of the effect with a potential of overestimating the effect.  
The Study ECU-MG-03 was conducted in Japan and US. Most of the patients included were Black or African 
American  (45.5%)  followed  by  Asian  (27.3%)  patients.  Only  18.2%  were  White.  No  EU  patients  were 
recruited.  At  request,  the  MAH  has  explained  that  no  significant  impact  on  exposure  and  terminal 
complement inhibition has been observed in a Pop-PK analysis in adult gMG patients by ethnicity and no 
relevant differences in the treatment effect of eculizumab in adults has been reported in the literature when 
ethnic differences were explored. It can, therefore, be expected that the response in the target population 
would not be dissimilar to that observed in Study ECU-MG-303. This can be agreed.  
No children less than 12 years of age participated in the study. Mean age was 14.8 years (ranging from 12 
to 17 years).  Although limited (due to a low patient availability), some data on PK, efficacy and safety was 
expected in this young subset. While MG in adults and children have differences, it can be agreed that the 
paediatric target population including children with refractory gMG with anti-AChR antibodies is similar to 
the already approved adult population. Based on this similarity, the estimation of the dose recommendation 
in this sub-group of patients and the available efficacy results, extrapolation of efficacy to children aged ≥6 
years can be agreed.   
The majority of patients in study ECU-MG-303 (90%) were ≥40 kg. There was only 1 patient in the body 
weight range 30 to 40 kg and 10 patients in the weight cohort ≥ 40 kg, which indicates that 10 out of 11 
subjects  received  the  dosing  regimen  for  adult  gMG  patients.  Upon  request,  the  Applicant  presented  a 
simulation-based analysis of the exposure at steady state across the different body-weight subgroups of 
paediatric patients using the pop-PK model in gMG patients and the allometric exponents obtained in the 
pop-PK model in aHUS/PNH that supports the dose recommendation in paediatric gMG patients below 37 
kg. 
Eculizumab is approved in adult patients with refractory gMG. Adult patients included in study ECU-MG-301 
were required to have failed to at least 2 previous treatments according the international consensus27. In 
study ECU-MG-303, patients were required to have refractory condition defined as having failed treatment 
≥1 year with at least 1 immunosuppressive therapies or requiring PE or IVIg to control symptoms or having 
a significant functional burden despite current MG treatment. The MAH has explained that a clear definition 
of refractoriness in MG in paediatric patients is not currently available. Considering the characteristics of 
the  patients  included  in  the  study  with  respect  to  failure  to  previous  treatments  and  the  symptomatic 
condition in spite of the concomitant treatment received during the study, it could be justified to consider 
paediatric patients in Study ECU-MG-303 as meeting the definition of refractory.  
When the effect is analysed by the use or not of maintenance IVIg, it seems to be of lower magnitude in 
those patients chronically treated with IVIg. However, not all the efficacy results point in the same direction 
and the reduced number of patients prevents from drawing a conclusion on whether the efficacy may vary 
depending  on  the  use  of  IVIg  as  maintenance  IST.  Of  note,  the  reported  PK  data  in  patients  receiving 
maintenance IVIg therapy and Soliris supplemental doses show an increased exposure of eculizumab. The 
MAH  has  justified  the  need  of  supplemental  doses  of  eculizumab  when  IVIg  therapy  is  concomitantly 
administered,  based  on  faster  mAb  clearance.  Further,  the  MAH  provided  a  new  analysis  for  PK  /  PD

modelling in which it can be agreed that the distribution of the Exposure of Eculizumab (PK) vs. inhibition 
of  terminal  complement    (free  C5  <  0.5  µg/mL)  (PD)  overlaps  for  those  children  using  standard  dose 
regimen (no IVIg-treatment) and standard dose regimen plus supplemental dosing (IVIg-treated patients). 
Whether  the  apparently  reduced  efficacy  observed  in  those  patients  compared  to  those  not  receiving 
concomitant  IVIg  therapy  can  be  (solely)  explained  from  the  PK  perspective  remains  unclear.  This 
information has been added to the SmPC. 
No efficacy data are available beyond week 26 so that the maintenance of the effect in this population is 
unknown. The study is still ongoing and results up to additional 208 Weeks are expected to be submitted, 
when available.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, headache (36.4%), nasopharyngitis (36.4%), pyrexia (27.3%) and pain in extremity (27.3%) were 
the most frequently reported during the 26-week primary evaluation treatment period of Study ECU-MG-
303. All these AEs are already included in the SmPC of the product. 
No TESAEs were reported during the primary evaluation treatment period. During the extension period (as 
of the data cutoff date), 3 (27.3%) patients reported 6 TESAEs: 1 patient experienced MG crisis, 1 patient 
experienced 3 episodes of MG worsening (one of them with pyrexia). All these TSAEs were related to MG. 
One  patient  experienced  a  serious  infection,  which  was  assessed  as  related  to  study  drug  by  the 
Investigator. None of the TESAEs resulted in a change in study drug dose or study drug discontinuation. 
No events of sepsis, meningococcal, or Aspergillus spp infections (considered as adverse events of special 
interest) were reported. No patients died or discontinued the study due to a TEAE. No clinically significant 
changes in clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs or ECG were observed. No ADA response was detected 
following eculizumab treatment.  
One of the gMG patients reported several events of eczema, not currently included in the SmPC. However, 
eczema was reported as AE in paediatric aHUS patients28.   
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database of eculizumab in the applied indication is considered very limited. A total of 11 patients 
aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years were exposed to eculizumab in the primary evaluation treatment period ECU-MG-
303.  A  total  of  10  patients  are  being  treated  during  the  Extension  period.  The  small  size  of  the  safety 
database is not unexpected considering the rarity of the condition. The limited safety database in paediatric 
gMG patients can be considered supported by safety data of eculizumab in paediatric patients with other 
conditions. 
The study was conducted in USA and Japan. Only 18.2% of the patients were White, being Black or African 
American  (45.5%)  followed  by  Asian  (27.3%)  patients  the  most  represented  groups.  There  are  no  gMG 
patients <12 years treated with eculizumab. 
Supplementary  data  from  eculizumab  studies  in  adults  with  gMG  and  other  paediatric  indications  (PNH, 
aHUS) have been also submitted in order to complete the safety profile in the paediatric population. The 
safety database includes 34 children (<12 years of age) and 20 adolescents (12 to 18 years of age) with 
PNH/aHUS.  This  supportive  safety  population  shows  other  demographic  differences  with  respect  to  that 
included in the study ECU-MG-303 such as higher proportion of males and the predominance of White or 
Caucasian  patients.  In  addition,  paediatric  PNH  patients  weighing  >40  kg  received  lower  induction  and

maintenance  doses  than  patients  in  study  ECU-MG-303.  The  safety  profile  reported  in  these  paediatric 
indications (with a total database still limited even for frequent adverse events) is deemed to be similar to 
that observed in adult patients. There is no evidence from this study suggesting a different safety profile in 
pediatric patients with refractory gMG. The extension phase of the study is ongoing. The MAH is expected 
to submit the results when available in order to complete the long-term safety assessment.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The efficacy of eculizumab on the treatment of gMG in paediatric patients has been established in a single 
open label study (study ECU-MG-303) that included a total of 11 patients > 12 years of age.  
Overall, although the data suggest an effect of eculizumab in the studied population the available evidence 
is scarce. The rarity of the condition is acknowledged and these circumstances are more relevant in the 
paediatric  population..  However,  the  study  in  adults  may  contribute  to  provide  some  reassurance, 
particularly  due  to  the  similarity  of  the  phenotype  and  pathophysiology  of  the  adult  and  paediatric 
population  diagnosed  as  refractory  gMG  with  anti-AChR  antibodies  positive.  Additionally,  an  adequate 
estimation of the dose by weight for children covering the weight 6-12-year old is also supportive. 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed on the inclusion of paediatric patients 6 years and above in the indication. The 
cut-off point is derived from the study 1 in the PIP, since a waiver was granted in the paediatric population 
from birth to less than 6 years of age. 
The safety database of eculizumab in the applied indication is considered very limited which prevents from 
fully  characterising  the  safety  profile  of  eculizumab  in  this  population.  However,  the  safety  data  from 
paediatric patients with refractory gMG are consistent with the known safety profile of eculizumab in adult 
patients with refractory gMG, paediatric patients with PNH, and paediatric and adult patients with aHUS. 
There  is  no  evidence  from  this  study  suggesting  a  different  safety  profile  in  paediatric  patients  with 
refractory  gMG.  Long-term  efficacy  and  safety  in  paediatric  gMG  population  is  based  on  the  effect  of 
eculizumab during the extension period of the study, still ongoing. Results from this extension phase should 
be provided.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Although the small number of subjects, the lack of a control arm, the observed variability as well as the 
fluctuating nature of the condition add uncertainty to the estimation of the magnitude of the effect with a 
potential of overestimating the effect, the CHMP noted that Eculizumab has shown an effect on the control 
of symptoms assessed by the physician (QMG score; primary endpoint) and by the patient (MG-ADL score, 
secondary endpoint) in the studied patients after 26 weeks of treatment, with respect to baseline values. 
The safety data are consistent with the known safety profile of eculizumab in adult patients with refractory 
gMG,  and  paediatric  PNH  and  aHUS  patients.  The  reduced  safety  database  is  the  main  limitation.  The 
extension phase of the study is ongoing. The MAH is expected to submit the results when available in order 
to complete the long-term efficacy and safety assessment.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  review  of  the  submitted  data,  the  CHMP  considers  the  following  variation  acceptable  and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning 
the following change: 
Variation accepted

approved one  
Extension of indication to include treatment of paediatric patients with refractory generalised myasthenia 
gravis  (gMG)  for  Soliris,  based  on  interim  results  from  study  ECU-MG-303;  this  is  an  open-label, 
multicenter, phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
intravenous (IV) eculizumab in paediatric patients aged 6 to less than 18 years with acetylcholine receptor-
antibody (AChR-Ab) positive (+) refractory gMG. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 
and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 20.3 of the RMP 
has been agreed. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to 
update the frequency of the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) based on cumulative safety data and to 
introduce  minor  editorial  changes  to  the  PI.  In  addition,  in  line  with  the  new  WHO  level  alteration,  the 
Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the ATC code in the SmPC section 
5.1. The list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet has been updated. 
The  variation  leads  to  amendments  to  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Labelling  and  Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, IIIA and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/00074/2022 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Soliris is not similar to Vyvgart within the meaning of Article 
3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

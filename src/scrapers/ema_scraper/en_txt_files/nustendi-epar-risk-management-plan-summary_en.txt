Summary of risk management plan for Nustendi (Bempedoic 
acid/Ezetimibe) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Nustendi.  The RMP details important 
risks of Nustendi, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Nustendi's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Nustendi's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Nustendi should be used.   
This summary of the RMP for Nustendi should be read in the context of all this information, 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Nustendi's 
RMP. 
I.   
The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
Nustendi is authorized for treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia in adults, as an adjunct to 
diet (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains bempedoic acid as the active substance and it 
is given by mouth. 
Further information about the evaluation of Nustendi’s benefits can be found in Nustendi’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage  https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/nustendi 
II.   
Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or 
Further Characterize the Risks 
Important risks of Nustendi, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Nustendi's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
•  The authorized pack size—the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly 
•  The medicine’s legal status—the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with 
or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including PBRER assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Nustendi is not yet available, it is listed 
under “missing information” below. 
II.A 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Nustendi are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken.  Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Nustendi.  Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Serious muscle toxicity risk has been associated with coadministration of statins with 
drugs that raise statin plasma concentrations, especially when either multiple pathways of 
statin elimination are affected, eg, inhibition of CYP3A or CYP2C8 (eg, atorvastatin, 
cerivastatin) and/or transporters (eg, simvastatin acid and atorvastatin) are impacted. 
Bempedoic acid interacts weakly with simvastatin lactone (parent compound), 
rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and pravastatin, with 1.2- to 1.5-fold increases in statin AUC 
when coadministered with steady-state bempedoic acid at a dose of 180 mg QD 
(Module 2.7.2, Section 4.5).  Simvastatin hydroxyl acid (metabolite) was increased 
approximately 2-fold.  PK alterations that increase simvastatin systemic exposure are one 
of the significant identified risk factors (Moßhammer et al, 2014).   
The magnitude of bempedoic acid effects on each statin studied are small relative to the 
theoretical maximum fold increase for each statin through its major mechanisms of 
elimination and with exposures from disposition factors associated with statin risk of 
myopathy.  Therefore, the risk of statin-induced myopathy as a result of a PK interaction 
from bempedoic acid, with the exception of simvastatin at doses ≥40 mg, is considered to 
be low.  The lack of significant effects on rates of myalgia, muscle weakness, and CK 
elevation in the bempedoic acid development program is consistent with the lack of a 
clinically significant PK interaction between bempedoic acid and statins. 
Simvastatin ≥40 mg in combination with bempedoic acid was not fully studied in the 
long-term Phase 3 studies.  Therefore, an impact on increase in the risk of myopathy with 
the combination with simvastatin in that dose range cannot be ruled out.  Based on the 
potential exposure differences, simvastatin dose-proportional PK, and the safety issues 
present with the simvastatin 80 mg daily dose, coadministration of bempedoic acid with 
simvastatin doses >40 mg/day is contraindicated in the SmPC; the maximum 
recommended dose regimen for simvastatin is 20 mg daily (or 40 mg daily for patients 
with severe hypercholesterolemia and high risk for CV complications, who have not 
achieved their treatment goals on lower doses and when the benefits are expected to 
outweigh the potential risks) when administered with bempedoic acid.   
Patients with hypercholesterolemia and taking statins for reduction of LDL-C would be at 
risk.  Risk factors also include concomitant therapies that are independently associated 
with myopathy or those that increase statin exposure, such as female sex, diabetes, and 
age > 80 years. 
An observational survey of patients taking high-dose statin therapy found that the 
strongest predictors for muscular symptoms were personal history of muscle pain during 
lipid-lowering therapy (OR 10.12, 95% CI 8.23, 12.45; p <0.0001), unexplained cramps 
(OR 4.14; 95% CI 3.46, 4.95; p <0.0001), and history of CK elevation (OR 2.04, 95% CI 
1.55, 2.68; p <0.0001) (Bruckert et al, 2005).

Risk factors and risk

Risk minimization 
measures 
Mean increases in serum uric acid were observed in bempedoic acid clinical studies.  
Uric acid increased is considered an adverse reaction of bempedoic acid that appears to 
be causally associated with shift in levels due to OAT2 inhibition.  It is unclear whether 
the increased uric acid puts patients at increased risk for gout; however, its association 
with potential risk of gout or worsening of gout cannot be ruled out.  Thus, gout is 
considered an important potential risk of bempedoic acid.

Important Potential Risk: Drug Interactions With Substrates of OAT2 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
In general, the evidence for a substantial clinical drug-drug interaction based on OAT2 
inhibition is weak.  No adverse effects due to OAT2 drug-drug interactions have been 
reported in the literature, with the possible exception of an interaction between 
theophylline and erythromycin, for which an OAT2 inhibitory mechanism is 
hypothesized but not demonstrated (Prince, et al, 1981).  In in vitro studies of 
transporter-mediated uptake (RR 1002-500-071 and RR 1002-500-075), bempedoic acid 
inhibited OAT2 transport of uric acid and creatinine at clinically relevant concentrations 
and inhibited cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) at concentrations well above 
clinical relevance; thus, OAT inhibition by bempedoic acid is substrate dependent.

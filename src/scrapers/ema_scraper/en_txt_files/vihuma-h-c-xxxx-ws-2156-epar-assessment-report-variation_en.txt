2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Simoctocog alfa is a fourth-generation recombinant human factor VIII product indicated for the 
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in  paediatric and adult patients  with haemophilia A and co-
marketed as Nuwiq and as Vihuma (MAH:  Octapharma AB). For initial  MA (Nuwiq: 22/07/2014),  135 
patients had been enrolled in pre-authorisation clinical studies. Although relevant information on 
general safety aspects were available and efficacy (restoration of factor VIII levels and stopping or 
prevention of bleeding) was demonstrated, data were insufficient to estimate all clinical aspects of 
therapy, in particular immunogenicity. In order to  meet the post-authorisation  requirements of the 
FVIII Guideline (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009),  the  MAH has now submitted  the final report from 
study GENA-99, a prospective, multinational,  non-interventional post-authorisation  study to document 
the long-term immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of simoctocog alfa in patients  with haemophilia A 
treated in routine clinical practice. The goal of this study was to collect data in 200 PTPs, however, it 
was completed in 2021  with  data obtained from 78 patients. In agreement with  EMA the MAH  had 
proposed that  other post-authorisation studies could be in support to meet regulatory standards. 
Therefore, an integrated analysis report of interventional studies GENA-13, GENA-15,  GENA-21, GENA-
21b and non-interventional studies GENA-99  and GENA-100  has also been submitted.  No amendments 
of the product information are proposed. 
As noted, only 78  HA patients (68 with  severe HA) were treated almost exclusively prophylactically 
with  Nuwiq  in GENA-99 study. 61 patients  in GENA-99 had ≥100  exposure days (EDs) and FVIII 
consumption was in line with  the SmPC. Mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) for all bleeds was 4.09 
(SD 6.47,  median 2.39 with  IQR 0-4.87  and full range of 0-38.7)  and consistent with  the ABR in the  6 
months prior to the study: median of 2.0 (IQR: 0-6, full range 0-36, mean 4.3, SD 6.82).  On-demand 
treatment success was 88.2%  and evaluated from 246  bleeding episodes (BE) in  48 prophylactically 
treated patients. A mean of 1.78  (SD 2.02)  infusions (median 1.0, IQR: 1.00,  2.00; range: 1-24)  was 
required for bleeding control with  a median dose of 35.65  IU/kg per infusion per BE (IQR: 27.78, 
42.64;  range: 14.0-76.1).  This is in  line with data from the pivotal studies. Three patients each had 
one bleeding episode for which treatment  efficacy was assessed as none. Individual reasons for the 
none-effective ratings (one BE was sub-optimally treated and two cases were target joint bleeds) are

acknowledged and additional data indicated that these patients  generally responded to Nuwiq 
treatment.  
In the GENA-pool analysis, 216 HA  patients (208 with  severe HA), prophylactically treated with  Nuwiq 
for ≥100 EDs, have been evaluated for efficacy (prophylactic efficacy, on-demand treatment of 
breakthrough bleeds, surgical prophylaxis) and safety to  meet the  requirements of the  EMA FVIII 
Guideline. Patient characteristics were balanced among age, body weight,  race/ethnicity, and 
geographical location of study sites. Treatment success rates for BEs occurring under prophylactic 
treatment were 92.1% for minor, 78.7% for moderate to major, and 57.5%  for major to life-
threatening bleeds (overall treatment success was 84.3%). These data partly align with  those reported 
in the Nuwiq  EPAR (EMA/CHMP/279301/2014).  E.g.  among the  pivotal studies,  treatment success (i.e. 
those with  an ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ rating) for minor bleeds was 98.6% in  GENA-01, 100% in  GENA-08, 
and 98.4% in  GENA-03 study. For moderate to major bleeds, success rates were 91.7%  (GENA-01), 
100%  (GENA-08), and 60.9%  (GENA-03, paediatric study). No valid comparison can be made with 
regard to major to  life threatening  bleeds for which treatment success was 66.7%  according to the 
EPAR, but  this numbers was based on three bleeds only (for comparison: integrated analysis 57.5% 
treatment success for major to life threatening bleeds with N=23).  Therefore, treatment efficacy at 
least for moderate to  major bleeds was lower in the integrated GENA-pool analysis. However, it  was 
clarified that  deviations in  the reported treatment success rates of the integrated analysis when 
compared to individual studies reported in the  EPAR result from different age distributions, i.e. in  the 
integrated analysis a larger proportion of paediatric patients <12  years of age was present and which 
had slightly lower success rates. Accordingly, age-staggered data of the integrated analysis 
demonstrate consistency with  success rates of other relevant studies. 
For surgical prophylaxis in the GENA-pool, treatment success intraoperative (n=24)  was 75% (25% 
unknown), and postoperative 74.2-86.1%  (unknown  13.9-25.0%).  There was no procedure rated non-
successful. The mean total number of injections (preoperative, at surgery day, intraoperative, 
postoperative) was 13 injections (and 8.3 EDs), the majority was administered postoperatively. It is 
noted that  large heterogeneity among routine protocols was present at different study sites. Thus, 
some concerns aroused from the maximum number of postoperatively administered injections (max: 
75.0,  median 9.5,  Q3: 14) with  a maximum of 53 EDs, i.e. in 25% of the surgical procedures 14-75 
injections have been administered postoperatively. Additional details on the major surgeries that 
required >30  post-surgical prophylactic infusions and underlying reasons for the high number of post-
operative infusions were provided to  rule out  concerns related to surgical efficacy. Taking into  account 
the variability of routine use of surgical prophylaxis among different study sites as well as 
heterogeneity of success evaluations, the data for surgical prophylaxis are considered acceptable.   
In summary, efficacy data of GENA-99  and the integrated analysis are consistent with  the established 
efficacy profile of Nuwiq. 
With  regards to safety of FVIII products in general, hypersensitivity reactions and immunogenicity, in 
particular occurrence of FVIII inhibitory  antibodies, are clinically relevant safety concerns. For Nuwiq, 
occurrence of hypersensitivity reaction is a common adverse drug reaction, as described in the SmPC. 
FVIII inhibition  is described with  very common frequency in previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 
uncommon frequency in previously treated patients  (PTPs) according to  the Guideline on core SmPC 
for human plasma derived and recombinant coagulation factor VIII products rev. 3. 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/1619/1999  rev. 3). As part of the post-authorisation investigation,  typically 200 
PTPs with  balanced age distribution  should be evaluated for 100 EDs especially to cover 
immunogenicity aspects, implying that  in case inhibitors  occur at an incidence of 1.5%  or higher, there 
is at least 95% probability to observe antibodies in one or more patients.  The required study size was 
not achieved in GENA-99  but 216  HA patients treated prophylactically for ≥100  EDs (208 patients  had 
severe HA) and with  balanced age distribution  were included in the integrated GENA-pool analysis in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/120573/2022  
Page 5/46 
 
 
 
order to meet regulatory standards. In GENA-99 as well as in the  GENA-pool data, study procedures 
for FVIII inhibitor testing  just partly align with  the recommendations made in the  EMA FVIII guideline 
which foresees that i)  a recovery and inhibitor  test in a central laboratory should confirm that  the 
patient is inhibitor  negative at study  entry and ii) inhibitor  and recovery testing at ED 10-15,  ED50-75, 
and at ED~100. Of the 216  subjects included in  the GENA-Pool, FVIII inhibitor testing  was not done for 
53 patients  at screening, 62 patients  between screening and completion, and 65  patients at study 
completion. Only a minority of the subjects have been tested consequently for inhibitors, in particular 
at the recommended time points of ED 10-15 (N=25/216;  11%)  and ED 50-75  (N=78/216;  36%). This 
is essentially because the majority of the  patients were in  the non-interventional studies GENA-99 and 
GENA-100 in  which FVIII inhibitor  testing at  set time points was not required. The MAH  confirmed that 
a majority of patients (N=191/216;  88%) has been tested at other time points between screening and 
before accumulating ≥100  EDs. Additionally, it  was clarified that  for study GENA-99 inhibitor  testing  at 
study completion (only 26.9% of patients were tested) was hampered by the  pandemic situation  in 
2020  (Last Patient Out was 20-Aug-2020).  In conclusion, no patient in  the GENA-Pool was tested 
positive for FVIII inhibitors  or had clinical symptoms suspicious of inhibitor  formation. As there is no 
overall indication of an increased immunogenicity risk for Nuwiq,  this  issue is not  further pursued. 
Overall,  despite these identified issues, it is considered that  the data presented  are 
sufficient and confirm the favourable benefit-risk  balance  of Nuwiq/Vihuma.

Annex: Rapporteur’s assessment comments on the type II 
variation 
5.  Introduction 
Simoctocog alfa is a fourth-generation recombinant human factor VIII (rhFVIII) concentrate, indicated 
for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in paediatric and adult patients with  haemophilia A (HA, 
congenital factor VIII deficiency). It is co-marketed as Nuwiq  by Octapharma and as Vihuma by 
Biotest, Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH)  for both  products is Octapharma AB. Markteting 
authorisation (MA)  for Nuwiq  and Vihuma was issued on 22/07/2014  and on 13/02/2017,  respectively. 
The number of patients enrolled in the pre-authorisation clinical studies with  rhFVIII Nuwiq  was 135, 
which was considered adequate to provide relevant information on general safety aspects and to 
demonstrate the efficacy of rhFVIII in terms of its ability  to restore factor VIII levels and stop or 
prevent bleeding. However, data from pre-authorisation studies were insufficient to  estimate all 
aspects of therapy with FVIII products, especially with respect to immunogenicity. 
The MAH submitted  the final report from study GENA-99, a prospective, multinational,  non-
interventional post-authorisation study to  document the long-term immunogenicity, safety, and 
efficacy of simoctocog alfa in patients with  haemophilia A treated in routine clinical practice. 
Specifically, the study was designed to  meet the  requirements for post-authorisation  studies as 
outlined in  'Guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor 
VIII products' (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009).   
In addition, the MAH  submitted  an integrated analysis report of studies GENA-99, GENA-13,  GENA-15, 
GENA-21, GENA-21b  and GENA-100. 
According to the  Guideline (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009),  the number of patients  typically needed 
in a post-authorisation study with  FVIII to  cover immunogenicity aspects is 200. In agreement with 
EMA in 2018,  patient  data from other post-authorisation studies contribute  to the goal of documenting 
the long-term safety of treatment  with simoctocog alfa in 200  previously treated patients  (PTPs). Data 
from other Nuwiq  studies whose patients met the requirement of 100 days of exposure and complied 
with  the inclusion criteria of the  GENA-99 study have been combined with  data from GENA-99  in a 
pooled analysis to count towards the required 200  patients. Therefore, data from the interventional 
clinical studies GENA-13, GENA-15,  GENA-21, GENA-21b completed post-authorisation were pooled 
with  the data from the  non-interventional post-authorisation studies GENA-99 and GENA-100.   
6.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
GENA-99 
This was a prospective, multinational,  non-interventional post-authorisation  study to document the 
long-term immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of rhFVIII in patients  with HA treated in routine clinical 
practice. The study period was from 21/01/2016  (First  Patient In) until  20/08/2020  (Last  Patient Out) 
and 80 patients were enrolled in 32  study centres in Argentina, Belarus, Czech Republic, Ecuador, 
France, Guatemala, Italy, Lithuania,  Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, United Kingdom, and United States.

Inclusion Criteria: 
‒  HA (FVIII:C ≤2%)  based on medical history; at  least 100  patients should have severe HA (FVIII:C 
<1%) 
‒  Male patients of any age 
‒  Previous treatment with  a FVIII concentrate for more than  150 exposure days (EDs) 
‒  Availability of detailed documentation (patient  diary) covering either the last 50 EDs or the last 2 
years per patient  to confirm treatment  modality (i.e.,  prophylaxis, on-demand, recent surgery, or 
immune tolerance induction) 
‒ 
‒ 
Inhibitor negative (<0.6 BU) at study entry as confirmed by a recovery test with previous FVIII 
product and inhibitor test 
Immunocompetence (CD4+ count >200/μL),  HIV-negative, or having a viral load <200 
particles/μL or <400,000  copies/mL 
‒  Decision to prescribe Nuwiq  before enrolment into the study 
‒  Written  informed consent by the patient or the patient’s parent or legal guardian 
Exclusion Criteria: 
‒  Patients treated with  any investigational medicinal product (IMP) except FVIII IMP within  30 days 
prior to  the Screening Visit or patients planning to undergo treatment with  any IMP other than 
Nuwiq  were not eligible for enrolment into  the study. 
Nuwiq  i.v. was administered as bolus. The treatment regimen (i.e., prophylactic treatment,  on-demand 
treatment, ITI, or surgical prophylaxis) as well as the doses, dosing intervals, or dose adjustments 
were to  be determined at the discretion of the treating physician following the common clinical practice 
and were to be recorded in the case report form (CRF).  If deemed appropriate by the treating 
physician for the respective patient,  options for individual adjustment of the prophylaxis regimen could 
be calculated from the results of a pharmacokinetics (PK) assessment. 
Prophylactic Treatment: For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with  severe HA, the 
usual doses are20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. In some cases, 
especially in younger patients,  shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may have been necessary.  
On-Demand Treatment and surgical prophylaxis: The following tables could have been used to guide 
dosing. 
The objectives of this  study were: 
•  To assess the long-term safety (including  immunogenicity) of Nuwiq  in treating  or preventing 
bleeding episodes (BEs) in patients with  HA 
• 
To assess the long-term efficacy of Nuwiq  in treating  or preventing BEs in  patients with  HA

Integrated  Analysis across studies 
The goal of study GENA-99 was to collect data on 200 previously treated male patients  of any age with 
HA (FVIII:C ≤2%).  The study was completed in 2021,  with  data obtained from 78 patients.  In 
agreement with  EMA in 2018,  patient data from other post-authorisation studies will  contribute to the 
goal of documenting  the long-term safety of treatment with  Nuwiq  in 200 PTPs. Therefore, data from 
other Nuwiq  studies whose patients  meet the  requirement of 100 days of exposure and comply with 
the inclusion criteria of the GENA-99 study have been combined with  data from GENA-99  to count 
towards the required 200  patients.  
The integrated analysis concerns studies GENA-99, GENA-13,  GENA-15, GENA-21,  GENA-21b, and 
GENA-100 (patients  with  ≥100 exposures days (ED)). The overall objective was to investigate the 
long-term safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of prophylactic Nuwiq  treatment in previously treated 
paediatric and adult  patients with  HA and to ensure consistency in the long-term between the outcome 
from pre-authorisation clinical studies (5 studies with  135  previously treated paediatric and adult 
patients) and routine clinical practice. Paediatric and adult patients  with moderate (1% < FVIII:C 
≤2%)  or severe (FVIII:C < 1%) HA who  were under prophylactic treatment with  Nuwiq  for at least 
100 EDs were included.  
Data from the prospective, multinational,  non-interventional post-authorisation  study GENA-99 were 
pooled with  data from interventional clinical studies that  were completed following market 
authorisation in the  EU (GENA-13, GENA-15,  GENA-21 and GENA-21b) as well as with data from 
another non-interventional study on routine clinical practice (GENA-100).  Study GENA-21b was 
ongoing at data base lock for this  analysis, with  a few patients  ongoing in the sub-study extension in 
Japan, and GENA-100 is still  ongoing; for these studies, only data as per pre-defined cut-off dates 
were included in pooled analysis. The cut-off date for study GENA-21b  data was set to  31-05-19,  for 
study GENA-100 data to  07-01-2021.  For GENA-99 subjects who participated in previous GENA-studies 
(i.e. GENA-13 and GENA-15),  the date of completion of the previous study was included into  pooled

data to calculate the time between completion of previous study and GENA-99  screening. GENA-13 and 
GENA-15 are extension studies of GENA-03 and GENA-05, respectively. Inhibitor results obtained 
during the preceding studies were used to determine inhibitor  history in the pooled analysis.

A total of 78 patients received Nuwiq  in this study and were included in the analyses (safety and full 
analysis sets).  
Assessor’s comment: The goal of the study was to collect data in 200 PTPs with HA  (FVIII:C ≤2%). 
The study was completed in 2021,  with  data obtained from 78 patients.  The MAH  has stated that in 
agreement with  EMA in 2018,  patient data from other post-authorisation studies will contribute to the 
goal of documenting  the long-term safety of treatment with  Nuwiq  in 200 PTPs. However, no reference 
regarding this  agreement has been made. The MAH  is asked for clarification. 
40 patients  (51.3%) were aged <12  years, 12 (15.4%)  were 12–<18  years, and 26 (33.3%)  were ≥18 
years. 10 patients (12.8%)  had moderate haemophilia and 68 patients (87.2%)  had severe 
haemophilia. 61 patients (78.2%)  were White,  7 (9.0%)  were American Indian or Alaska Native, 1 
(1.3%)  was Black or African American, and 9 (11.5%)  had race documented as “other”.  25 patients 
(32.1%)  identified as Hispanic or Latino.  Overall, 47 (60.3%)  patients had a family history of 
haemophilia and the most  common FVIII gene defect was intron  22 inversion (17 patients  [21.8%]).  A 
total of 10 patients  (12.8%)  had a history of FVIII inhibitors.  Mean BMI was 20.9  kg/m2. All but  2 
patients were on prophylactic treatment in  the 6 months before screening. The median ABR in the 6 
months before screening was 2 (range: 0-36),  mean ABR was 4.3 (SD 6.82).  Of note, mean ABR was 
notable higher in patients with  moderate haemophilia (mean 9.0,  SD 13.57)  than in patients  with 
severe haemophilia (mean 3.6,  SD 4.96).   
A total of 77 patients received prophylactic treatment  (mean duration 42.7  weeks with  a mean number 
of 113.6 infusions, for any reason). 2 patients received on-demand treatment during  the study, one of 
whom switched between prophylactic and on-demand treatment regimen and is counted under both 
treatment classes.

21 patients  were excluded from the PP population  (N=57)  because of major deviations (most common 
major deviation was patient completion/discontinuation  with  less than 100  EDs for 17 patients).  A total 
of 64 patients completed the study, 61 patients  with  at least 100 EDs and 3  patients with  less than 
100 EDs.

Efficacy Results -  Gena-99 
Prophylaxis: The most commonly planned treatment  regimen were three-times per week (32 [41.0%] 
patients),  every other-day (18 [23.1%]  patients), and two-times  per week (17  [21.8%] patients).  The 
planned treatment regimen at screening was on-demand for 2 (2.6%) patients.  A total  of 61 patients 
completed the study with  at least 100 EDs.  
A total of 252 BEs occurred in 74 patients  with at  least 3 months  under prophylactic regimen (FAS). 
The median (IQR) ABRs in this  study for patients with  at least 3 months  under prophylaxis (N=74) 
were 2.39  (0, 4.87)  for all BEs, 0.00 (0,  2.47) for spontaneous BEs, and 0.00  (0, 1.93)  for traumatic 
BEs. The median total  ABR was slightly  higher in adolescents (3.34  [1.17, 4.66])  compared to younger 
children (1.95 [0,  5.46]) and adults (1.52  [0, 4.35]),  but  the sample size was small in adolescents 
(N=12).  When BEs were analyzed by disease severity, the median total  ABR was 3.85 (range 0-6.04, 
mean 5.02,  SD 6.08)  for moderate haemophilia (N=10  patients)  and 2.21  (range 0-4.41,  mean 3.94, 
SD 6.56)  for severe haemophilia (N=64).  It  is noted that there were only 10 patients  with moderate 
haemophilia and these patients received on average ~ 35%  lower amounts of Nuwiq  per month.  The 
median total ABR observed on-study in patients with  at least 3 months under prophylaxis was 
consistent with  the ABR in  the 6 months prior to the study: 2.0  (0,6.00).

Assessor’s comment: As noted, the  mean and median ABR in the 6 months before screening was 4.3 
(SD 6.82)  and 2 (range: 0-36), respectively. These data align with  the prophylactic ABR results of 
study GENA-99. Of note, the  ABR measure lacks sensitivity when it comes to  the comparison of 
bleeding frequencies in the low-digit  range. Overall, the presented data reflect usual exposure during 
prophylactic treatment,  and a typically low bleeding frequency with high  dispersion. 
Treatment of bleeding episodes: Of the 77  patients in the FAS population who received prophylaxis 
with  Nuwiq,  49 patients experienced a total  of 255 treatment-emergent BEs; 28 (36.4%)  patients had 
no treatment emergent BEs. No major or life-threatening BEs occurred; 161 (63.1%)  of the treatment-
emergent BEs were minor and 94 (36.9%)  were moderate to major. The severity of treatment-
emergent BEs was also presented by site of bleeding and type of BE. The majority of moderate to 
major bleeds, i.e. 62/94 bleeds (53%)  were joint  bleeds, throughout  all age classes. 
246 treatment-emergent BEs in 48 patients  occurred under prophylactic regimen and were treated 
with  Nuwiq  (133 spontaneous, 105 traumatic, 1  postoperative, 5 ‘other’, 2 had missing type; 117 
occurred in joints, 128  were non-joint,  and 1 had unknown  site). The median number of infusions per 
BE was 1.0 (IQR: 1.00,  2.00;  range: 1-24),  and the median dose per infusion per BE/kg body weight 
was 35.65 IU/kg (IQR: 27.78, 42.64;  range: 14.0-76.1).

Most  BEs that occurred under prophylaxis (210 [85.4%])  were resolved with  1 (168 BEs) or 2 (42 BEs) 
infusions of Nuwiq.  One patient  had a BE with  duration of 18 days with  efficacy rated as “none” (see 
below). 
The efficacy assessment of bleeding episodes at end of a BE was evaluated on a 4-point scale by the 
patient/legal guardian (together with  the Investigator in case of on-site treatment).   
Assessment report

The majority of BEs were rated as having excellent (67.9%)  or good (20.3%)  treatment efficacy, 
giving a success rate of 88.2%.  Treatment efficacy was rated as moderate for 26 (10.6%)  BEs and as 
none for 3 (1.2%)  BEs. Of the treated spontaneous BEs (N=133),  the majority were rated as having 
excellent (71.4%)  or good (21.8%)  treatment efficacy, giving a success rate of 93.2%.  Treatment 
efficacy was rated as moderate for 6  (4.5%) spontaneous BEs and as none for 3 (2.3%)  spontaneous 
BEs. For comparison, the MAH  stated that  treatment success rate in interventional studies averaged at 
85% (93.2%  for spontaneous BEs). 
The 3 spontaneous BEs with  efficacy rated as none were described as follows: 
•  A moderate to major spontaneous BE in the left knee of one patient  that  was treated with  24 
infusions of Nuwiq  (11 with  65.6 IU/kg, 8 with  32.8, 2  with 49.13,  2 with  16.4,  and 1  with 
24.6).  The BE lasted 18 days and he tested negative for FVIII inhibitors  at the end of this BE. 
This patient discontinued  the trial prematurely at his own request following this BE, with  a 
total of 34 EDs. 
•  A moderate to major spontaneous BE in the left elbow in one patient that  was treated with  10 
infusions of Nuwiq.  The BE lasted 7 days. Subsequent BEs in this patient  were treated with 
excellent, good or moderate efficacy. This patient completed the study according to protocol 
with  182 EDs and he tested  negative for FVIII inhibitors at study completion. 
•  A moderate to major spontaneous BE in the left knee of one patient  that  was treated with  4 
infusions of Nuwiq  and was ongoing at end of study. This patient completed the study 
according to  protocol, with  183 EDs. There was no suspicion of inhibitor formation. 
Assessor’s comment: The MAH  is requested to further clarify the  numerical high range of injections 
per treatment-emergent bleeding episode (1-24)  and EDs (1-17).  A detailed narrative of the  three 
non-responding patients, in particular of the patient treated with  24 infusions, should be provided 
along with  a critical expert statement. 
On-demand: 2 patients were treated on-demand during the study. One patient switched  between on-
demand and prophylactic. He was treated on-demand for 21.7 months,  during which he experienced 
22 BEs. These BEs were treated with  a total of 26 infusions of Nuwiq  on 26  EDs, with  a mean dose of 
29.9  IU/kg per infusion, 1 with  moderate, 4 with  good and 17  with excellent efficacy. Another patient 
received only on-demand treatment and was treated for 11.8 months,  during which he experienced 33 
BEs. These BEs were treated with  a total  of 40 infusions of Nuwiq on 38 EDs, with  a mean dose of 
21.8  IU/kg per infusion, all with  excellent efficacy.

Surgical prophylaxis: A total of 4 patients  had 6  surgeries that were treated with  Nuwiq.  Two of these 
surgeries were minor and 4 were major. Five surgeries had an overall efficacy assessment performed 
jointly by the hematologist and surgeon, all rated as having excellent efficacy. One of the six surgeries 
was treated pre-op with  Advate and post-op with  Nuwiq and therefore no efficacy assessment of Nuwiq 
efficacy could be performed. One patient had 1 surgery that  was not treated with Nuwiq. 
Table 18:  Surgeries: description, total  dose and outcome of surgical procedures 
1 Performed jointly by hematologist and surgeon 
Assessor’s comment: Additional explanation is requested for the surgical efficacy ratings. For 3/5 
rated procedures data for actual vs. expected blood loss are not available. Two rated procedures where 
a minor surgery of port removal, one with reinsertion with  post-op 9 infusions whereas the other 
patient received only 2 infusion post-op. Additionally, one patient  with  right knee synovectomy (major 
surgery) with  actual blood loss of 5 ml had 11 infusion of Nuwiq  post-op.  
It is thus unclear on which basis excellent ratings could have been achieved.  
Integrated  analysis 
A total of 216 patients  were under prophylaxis with Nuwiq  for at least 100 EDs and were included in 
the POOL set (GENA-13, N=49;  GENA-15,  N=39,  GENA-21, N=25,  GENA-21b,  N=25,  GENA-99, N=61; 
GENA-100,  N=17).  Of the  216 patients in  the GENA-POOL, 123 (56.9%)  were aged <12 years, 17 
(7.9%)  were aged 12–<18  years, and 76 (35.2%)  were aged ≥18  years. Age at screening in  the 
GENA-POOL ranged from 1 to 71 years, with  a median of 8 years. Eight (3.7%)  patients  had moderate 
haemophilia A and 208 (96.3%)  had severe haemophilia A. A total  of 183  (84.7%)  patients were 
White,  19 (8.8%) were Asian, 5 (2.3%)  were American Indian or Alaska Native, 1 (0.5%) was Black or 
African American, and 8 (3.7%)  had race documented as “other”. Twenty patients  (9.3%) identified as 
Hispanic or Latino. Overall, 69  (31.9%) patients  had a family history of haemophilia and 9 (4.2%) 
patients had a family history of FVIII inhibitors.  A total  of 15 (6.9%) patients  had a history of FVIII 
inhibitors. It  was concluded that  the GENA-POOL patient population met the  requirements outlined in 
Guideline EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009  as it  included 208 patients  with severe haemophilia A, 123

patients aged <12 years and 17 aged 12-<18 years, and 6.9%  patients had a history of FVIII 
inhibitors. 
In GENA-POOL patients had a mean of 18.7 months under treatment with  Nuwiq  and received a mean 
of 233.6 infusions with  a mean dose of 38.3  IU/kg per infusion (for any reason). 
Efficacy Results -  Integrated  analysis  
The most commonly employed prophylactic treatment  regimen in the GENA-POOL (each patient could 
have had multiple prophylactic treatment regimens while  on the  study) were three-times-per-week 
(109  [39.9%] patients),  every-other-day (61 [22.3%]  patients),  and two-times-per-week (57 
[20.9%]).  The mean duration of prophylactic treatment in the GENA-POOL was 18.7 months,  ranging 
from 5.9  to 55.1  months. The mean dose (±SD) per kg per infusion for prophylaxis was 38.2  ± 12.9 
IU/kg (median: 35.4  IU/kg; range, 13.5–101.9),  with  higher average doses in patients aged <12 
years, in line with  the Nuwiq  SPC which recommends a dose range of 20–40  IU/kg, with  the regimen 
to be adjusted based on patient response and higher dosages to be considered in younger patients.

Assessor’s comment: For the complete GENA-pool including  all age groups (N=216),  median 
prophylactic dosing per injection was 35.41 IU/kg (third  quartile Q3:  43.41 IU/kg, max: 101.9  IU/kg) 
and per ED 35.41  IU/kg (Q3:  43.52 IU/kg, max: 103  IU/kg). For the age class ≥ 18 years (N=76), 
median prophylactic dosing per injection was 35.17  IU/kg (Q3: 42.55 IU/kg; max: 85.4 IU/kg). For the 
age class <12 years (N=123),  median prophylactic dosing per injection was 36.33 IU/kg (Q3: 44.12 
IU/kg; max: 101.9  IU/kg). Data are derived from Table 14.2.3.1-1.  It appears that a considerable 
portion, i.e. about a quarter of the patients  (adults as well as paediatrics), received higher than the 
recommended usual prophylactic dosing (20 to 40  IU/kg) with  maximum 2-fold of the  recommended 
prophylactic dosing. A detailed clarification is requested. 
Annualised Bleeding Rates During Prophylactic Treatment: Of the 216  patients in the GENA-POOL, 160 
(74.1%)  patients experienced a total  of 1111  treatment-emergent BEs; 56 (25.9%)  patients had no 
treatment-emergent BEs. Of the  1111 treatment-emergent BEs, 572 (51.5%)  were minor, 492 
(44.3%)  were moderate to  major, 41 (3.7%)  were major to life-threatening,  and 6 (0.5%) were of 
unknown severity. The mean (SD) and median (IQR) ABRs in the GENA-POOL were 3.92  (8.42)  and 
1.78  (0, 4.24) for all BEs, 1.89 (4.7)  and 0.11  (0, 1.45)  for spontaneous BEs, and 1.80 (4.73)  and 
0.50  (0, 1.95) for traumatic BEs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/120573/2022  
Page 20/46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When BEs were analysed by disease severity, the mean (SD) and median (range) total ABR in the 
GENA-POOL was 5.59 (6.61)  and 3.85 (0, 9.69)  for moderate HA, and 3.86 (8.5)  and 1.73 (0, 4.18) 
for severe HA. It is argued that  only 8 patients with  moderate haemophilia A were included (all in 
GENA-99) and these patients received lower amounts of Nuwiq  per month  on average (322.6 vs 464.8 
IU/kg/month). 
Assessor’s comment: The MAH  has noted that caution  is required when comparing ABR data 
between different studies, but the ABRs in  each study indicate good bleeding control with  Nuwiq 
prophylaxis when compared to the median ABR of 54.5 observed with  on-demand Nuwiq  treatment in 
study GENA-01. It  is endorsed that  ABR estimates generally lack sensitivity when it  come to the 
comparison of prophylactically treated patients. Nevertheless, among the individual studies in the 
GENA-pool, the GENA-21b study showed notable higher ABR frequencies. The MAH is asked to provide 
a possible explanation for this  observation.  
Analysis of the efficacy of treatment of bleeding episodes that  occurred under prophylaxis: A total  of 
1011  treatment-emergent BEs in 152  patients in the GENA-POOL were treated with  Nuwiq;  410 were

spontaneous, 532 were traumatic,  7 were postoperative, 29  were ‘other’, and 33 had missing type. 
507 BEs occurred in joints, 497  were non-joint,  and 7 had unknown site. The mean and median 
number of Nuwiq  infusions per BE was 1.7  (SD 1.6) and 1.0  (IQR: 1.00,  2.00; range: 1-16).  The mean 
and median dose per infusion per BE/kg body weight was 39.9  IU/kg (SD 15.8) and 35.97  IU/kg (IQR: 
30.30,  45.45;  range: 12.6-118).   
The median duration of treated BEs in the GENA-POOL was 1.0  day (range: 1-14 days). Most BEs (860 
[85.1%])  were resolved with  1 (710 BEs) or 2 (150 BEs) infusions of Nuwiq.  Efficacy was assessed 
using a 4-point  scale. The majority of BEs in the  GENA-POOL were rated as having excellent (54.2%) 
or good (30.1%)  treatment efficacy, giving a success rate of 84.3%.  Treatment efficacy was rated as 
moderate for 123 (12.2%)  BEs and as none for 15 (1.5%)  BEs. The success rate for spontaneous BEs 
was 83.4%.

Assessor’s comments: Treatment success rates for BE occurring under prophylactic treatment were 
92.1%  for minor, 78.7%  for moderate to major, and 57.5% for major to life-threatening bleeds 
(overall treatment success was 84.3%).  These data just partly align with  those reported in the Nuwiq 
EPAR (EMA/CHMP/279301/2014).  E.g.  for moderate to major bleeds among the pivotal studies 
treatment success rates were 91.7%  (GENA-01), 100%  (GENA-08),  and 60.9%  (GENA-03).  Thus, 
treatment efficacy for moderate to major bleeds appears to be somewhat lower in the integrated 
GENA-pool analysis. The MAH should comment on the clinical significance of this  observation. 
Surgical prophylaxis: In the GENA-POOL, a total of 31 patients  had 51 surgeries that were treated with 
Nuwiq.  15 of these surgeries were minor, 21 were major, and 15  had unknown severity (severity was 
not collected in study GENA-100).  45/51 surgeries were planned and 6/51  were emergency. 
The median total  dose of Nuwiq  administered for surgery in the GENA-POOL was 399.99  IU/kg with  a 
median of 9 infusions (range: 1-76)  and a median of 36.06  IU/kg (max: 96.5  IU/kg) Nuwiq per 
infusion.  
Assessor’s comments: For the  51 surgeries, there was a mean total (preoperative, at surgery day, 
intraoperative, postoperative) number of 13 injections and 8.3 EDs, with  the majority in the 
postoperative stage. The maximum number of postoperative injections was 75.0  (median 9.5,  Q3: 14) 
with  a maximum of 53 EDs (median: 6.00,  Q3: 9.00).  I.e. in 25%  of the surgical procedures 14-75 
injections have been administered postoperatively. This range appears unusual high  and the  MAH is 
requested for clarification.

The median actual blood loss of 7.5  mL (IQR: 0,  32.5) was lower than the median expected average 
blood loss of 10.0  mL (IQR: 5, 50.0).  For study GENA-100,  blood loss was assessed based on 
expectedness categories; 5 surgeries had blood loss that  was as expected, with  10 surgeries having no 
blood loss. No  surgical procedure was assessed as having non-successful Nuwiq  treatment. Of note, 
treatment success was unknown in 14-25%  of the procedures.

6.3.  Discussion 
GENA-99: Overall, no major concerns arise from the study data. 78  HA patients (10  moderate, 68 
severe) were treated with Nuwiq  (median age at enrolment was 10 years, 10 patients  had a history of 
FVIII inhibitor).  Of note, the study was planned to collect data on 200 PTPs. 77  patients received 
prophylactic treatment,  1 patients received on-demand only, and one patient switched between 
treatment regimens. Mean prophylactic treatment duration was 42.7  weeks (median 24.3  weeks) and 
patients received a mean of 113.6 infusions for any reason (median 110  infusions). Of 64 patients who 
completed the study, 61 patients had ≥ 100  EDs. Average dose exposure was 39.5 IU/kg per ED or 
38.7  IU/kg per infusion.  
Prophylactic efficacy was tested on the basis of bleeding frequencies, i.e. ABR. 252  BEs occurred in 74 
patients with  at least 3 months prophylactic treatment. Mean ABR for all bleeds was 4.09  (SD 6.47, 
median 2.39 with  IQR 0-4.87  and full range of 0-38.7).  Mean ABR for spontaneous bleeds was 2.09 
(SD 4.17,  median 0 with IQR 0-2.47  and full  range of 0-21). Split  by disease severity, the mean total 
ABR was 5.02 (SD 6.08, median 3.85,  range 0-6.04)  for moderate haemophilia (N=10  patients),  and 
mean total  ABR was 3.94 (SD 6.56, median 2.21,  range 0-4.41)  for severe haemophilia (N=64).  The 
MAH  has noted that  the number of patients with  moderate haemophilia was overall low and these 
patients received on average ~ 35%  lower amounts of Nuwiq  per month.  The range of observed 
bleeding frequencies for patients under prophylactic treatment (up to 38.5  total annualised bleeds and 
up to 21  annualised spontaneous bleeds) generally appears high. However, the median total  ABR 
observed on-study in patients with  at least 3 months under prophylaxis was consistent with  the ABR in 
the 6 months  prior to the study:  2.0 (IQR: 0-6, full range 0-36, mean 4.3, SD 6.82).  It is 
acknowledged that  ABR measures show notable variability and lack significance in particular in the 
comparison of prophylactically treated patients.  
Efficacy in the  on-demand treatment was rated for 246  BEs in  48 prophylactically treated patients. Of 
these, 217 (88.2%)  were treated successfully (i.e. achieved an ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ efficacy rating 
using a four point rating scale). 26 BEs (10.6 %) and 3 BEs (1.2%) achieved an efficacy rating of 
‘moderate’ or ‘none’ summing up to 29 non-successfully treated BEs (11.8%).  Mean and median 
number of infusions per BE was 1.78  (SD 2.02)  and 1.0 (IQR: 1.00, 2.00;  range: 1-24),  respectively. 
Median dose per infusion per BE was 35.65  IU/kg (IQR: 27.78,  42.64;  range: 14.0-76.1).  In sum, on-
demand efficacy data do not raise major concerns and generally align with  initial  MA data of Nuwiq. 
However, there were three non-responding patients (one patient that was treated with 24  infusions) 
and reasons for the numerical high range of injections per bleeding episode (1-24)  and EDs (1-17) 
remain unclear.  
Efficacy in GENA-99  was also evaluated during surgical prophylaxis. These data raise some concerns 
on which basis the excellent efficacy ratings have been achieved. 3 out of 5 rated procedures are 
missing data for actual vs. expected blood loss. Two rated procedures where a minor surgery of port 
removal, one with  reinsertion with  post-op 9 infusions whereas in the other procedure only 2  post-op 
infusion were administered. Additionally, one patient with  major surgery (right knee synovectomy) 
with  only subtle  actual blood loss of 5ml had 11 Nuwiq  infusions post-op.  
Integrated analysis: Treatment success rates for BE occurring under prophylactic treatment were 
92.1%  for minor, 78.7%  for moderate to major, and 57.5% for major to life-threatening bleeds 
(overall treatment success was 84.3%).  These data partly align with  those reported in the Nuwiq  EPAR 
(EMA/CHMP/279301/2014).  E.g. among the pivotal studies, treatment success (i.e. those with  an 
‘excellent’ or ‘good’ rating) for minor bleeds was 98.6%  in GENA-01, 100%  in GENA-08,  and 98.4%  in 
GENA-03 study. For moderate to major bleeds, success rates were 91.7%  (GENA-01),  100% (GENA-
08), and 60.9%  (GENA-03).  GENA-03 was a paediatric study in patients ≤12  years where 50% 
achieved an ‘excellent’ rating, and 10.9%  a ‘good’ rating. No  valid comparison can be made with

regard to major to  life threatening  bleeds for which treatment success was 66.7%  according to the 
EPAR, but  this numbers was based on three bleeds only (for comparison: integrated analysis 57.5% 
treatment success for major to life threatening bleeds with N=23).  Therefore, treatment efficacy at 
least for moderate to  major bleeds appears to be somewhat lower in the  integrated GENA-pool 
analysis, however, clinical significance is unclear. For surgical prophylaxis in the GENA-pool, 31 
patients underwent  51 surgeries that were treated with Nuwiq.  21 surgeries were major, 15 minor, 
and 15 had unknown severity. Actual range of blood loss was 0.0-260.0  mL (median: 7.5  mL, Q3: 
32.50  mL, data available for n=25  procedures, mean blood loss was 35.13  mL with  n=24).  Treatment 
success was unknown for 5-8 procedures (depending on the rating  procedure, i.e. surgeon 
intraoperative, surgeon postoperative, haematologist postoperative). Treatment success intraoperative 
(n=24)  was 75% (25% unknown),  and postoperative 74.2-86.1%  (unknown 13.9-25.0%).   There was 
no procedure rated non-successful. The mean total  number of injections (preoperative, at surgery day, 
intraoperative, postoperative) was 13 injections (and 8.3  EDs), with  the majority administered 
postoperatively. Taking into  account the heterogeneity in surgical procedures, dosing & consumption 
data, and success evaluations, the  data for surgical prophylaxis are considered acceptable. However, 
there are some concerns on the maximum number of postoperatively administered injections (max: 
75.0,  median 9.5,  Q3: 14) with  a maximum of 53 EDs, i.e. in 25% of the surgical procedures 14-75 
injections have been administered postoperatively.  
Overall, a total of 216 HA patients  (208 with  severe HA), prophylactically treated with Nuwiq  for ≥100 
EDs, have been evaluated for efficacy (prophylactic efficacy, on-demand treatment of breakthrough 
bleeds, surgical prophylaxis) and safety to meet the requirements of the EMA  FVIII Guideline. Patient 
characteristics are balanced among age, body weight,  race/ethnicity, and geographical location of 
study sites. No major concerns arise from the submitted  efficacy data yet a substantial  number of 
issues has been identified in almost all domains of the efficacy evaluation. In GENA-99  study, there 
was a numerical high range of injections per BEs with  up to 24  injections or 17 EDs. As for the total 
GENA-pool, it appears that  a considerable portion of adult  as well as paediatric subjects received 
higher than the recommended usual prophylactic dosing. Patients in  one study showed notable higher 
annualized bleeding rates (GENA-21b) when compared to  other studies included in  the integrated 
analysis and treatment success for BE, in particular for major to life-threatening  bleeds, falls short on 
the data currently reported in the Nuwiq  EPAR. To rule out or minimise uncertainties about low 
efficacy, additional information have to be submitted.

Immunogenicity and Safety  Results -  Gena-99 
In this study, testing  for FVIII inhibitors could be carried out at any time at the physician’s discretion. 
Furthermore, at each visit, patients were checked for clinical symptoms suggesting FVIII inhibitor 
development and any suspicion of inhibitor  formation was to be investigated by FVIII inhibitor testing. 
Before patient inclusion into  the study, and as recommended in the Guideline 
EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009,  there was to be no clinical suspicion of FVIII inhibitors.  A recovery 
and inhibitor test  could have been performed to confirm that the  patient was negative at  study entry. 
In the event of a positive test, it  was recommended to test  a second separately drawn sample. 
FVIII inhibitor  status testing  was performed for 40 patients (51.3%)  at baseline, for 44  patients 
(56.4%)  between screening and completion, and 21  patients (26.9%)  at study completion. No FVIII 
inhibitors were detected and no clinical symptoms led to  suspicion of inhibitor  formation in  any patient 
treated. It should be noted that around one third of patients completed the study during the COVID-19 
pandemic and many of these patients  had remote visits with  no testing  for FVIII inhibitors at study 
completion. 
Assessor’s comment: The inhibitor  testing  procedures appear not to  be in  line with  the 
EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009  guideline. For post-marketing investigation, a recovery and inhibitor 
test in  a central laboratory should confirm that  the patient  is inhibitor negative at study entry. The

inhibitor  testing schedule foresees inhibitor and recovery testing at ED10-15,  ED50-75, and at 
ED~100. It  remains unclear why not  all subjects have been tested accordingly (taken into account 
those who could not be tested due to COVID-19 pandemic). Apparently only half of the patients  have 
been tested  at entry and during the  study, and only a quarter at  study end. A detailed explanation is 
requested by the MAH.  The MAH should also provide an outline  or graphical presentation detailing time 
points and frequency of testing for individual patients.  
No hypersensitivity reactions or thromboembolic events occurred during the  study. No ADRs were 
observed during the study. 
One death was recorded in the study.  The patient  was reported as having died due to a possible 
intentional/unintentional  overdose of anti-depressant prescribed medications. The investigator 
reported no suspected relationship between Nuwiq  and the death of the patient  and the  event was 
deemed unrelated to Nuwiq.    
Long-term Safety  and Immunogenicity – Integrated  Analysis 
A total of 12 ADRs were experienced by 8  patients, giving a subject-related incidence of 3.7%  and an 
incidence rate per year of 0.036.  The ADRs were 5 events of pyrexia in 4 patients  (incidence 1.85%),  3 
events of dizziness in 2 patients (incidence 0.93%),  and single events of dyspnoea, headache, malaise, 
and chest pain (incidence 0.46%  for each). Only 1 ADR (mild pyrexia requiring hospitalisation)  was 
assessed as serious; none led to death or discontinuation.  No hypersensitivity reactions or 
thromboembolic events occurred. 
Assessor’s comments:  
- Apparently, one patient experienced a total  of 5 ADRs (3x dizziness, 1x malaise, 1x chest pain). The 
MAH  is asked to  provide additional clarification for this accumulation of ADRs and to comment on any 
potential predisposing medical history.  
- Tightness of the chest is described SmPC and the package leaflet as possible side effect (Sections 
4.4. and 4.8  of Annex I, Section 4 of Annex III). As from the integrated analysis, the ADR of chest pain 
(possible causality, mild severity, outcome: recovered/resolved) is not included in the tabulated  list of 
adverse reactions if the current SmPC. Clarification is requested. 
No patient  in the GENA-POOL tested positive for FVIII inhibitors,  and no clinical symptoms led to 
suspicion of inhibitor formation in any patient  in the GENA-POOL. FVIII inhibitor  testing  was not  done 
for 53 patients at screening, 62 patients between screening and completion, and 65 patients  at study 
completion; the majority of these patients were in the non-interventional studies GENA-99  and GENA-
100 (48,  35, 60 patients,  respectively) in which FVIII inhibitor  testing  at set timepoints was not 
required. 
Assessor’s comment: The MAH  is requested to outline,  how many subjects finally had been 
scheduled for inhibitor testing  and how many finally have been tested according to the  schedule 
outlined in  the clinical FVIII Guideline.

7.3.  Discussion 
In the GENA-99 study, FVIII inhibitor status  testing was performed for 40  patients (51.3%)  at 
baseline, for 44 patients  (56.4%) between screening and completion, and 21 patients  (26.9%) at 
study completion. No FVIII inhibitors  were detected and no clinical symptoms led to suspicion of 
inhibitor  formation in any patient treated. It was noted that  around one third  of patients  completed the 
study during the COVID-19 pandemic and many of these patients had remote visits with  no testing  for 
FVIII inhibitors  at study completion. No ADRs including hypersensitivity reactions and thromboembolic 
events were observed during the  study. One death was recorded during the study which  was 
considered unrelated to Nuwiq  treatment but was suspected to overdose of multiple medications on 
the medical background of an ongoing post-traumatic  stress disorder and depression. Although these 
safety results do not raise concerns, there are concerns related to the  study procedures. Among 78 
patients, inhibitor  testing  was not  done for 38 (48.7%)  at screening, 34  (43.6%) between screening 
and completion, and 57 (73.1%)  at completion. While it is acknowledged that  inhibitor testing  at study 
completion could have been hampered (only 26.9%  of patients  was tested) by the  pandemic situation 
in 2020  (Last Patient Out:  20-Aug-2020),  it remains generally unclear why the inhibitor  testing 
procedures were not in  line with  the FVIII guideline and whether inconsistent testing  procedures may 
have affected immunogenicity results.  
From the integrated analysis, overall no safety signals have been identified. However, the description 
of inhibitor testing  procedures lacks clarity (i.e. it  is described for how many patients inhibitor  testing 
was not done at distinct  time point/periods) and it is unknown how many patients have been tested in 
accordance with the  testing scheme outlined  in the FVIII Guideline. In addition, there is a lack of 
description regarding the accumulation of 5 ADRs in a single subject. 
Overall, no safety signals are identified but  presented data are compromised by inhibitor testing 
procedures appearing not aligned with  the FVIII guideline. Further  information accompanied by an 
appropriate expert statement  on data validity are requested.

9.  Request for supplementary information 
9.1.  Major objections 
None. 
9.2.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
1)  The goal of study GENA-99 was to collect data in 200  PTPs with  HA (FVIII:C ≤2%).  The study was 
completed in 2021, with  data obtained from 78  patients. The MAH has stated that  in agreement 
with  EMA in 2018,  patient data from other post-authorisation studies will contribute  to the goal of 
documenting the long-term safety of treatment  with  Nuwiq in 200  PTPs. However, no reference 
regarding this  agreement has been made. The MAH  is asked for clarification. 
2)  The MAH is requested to  further clarify the numerical high  range of injections per treatment-
emergent bleeding episode (1-24)  and EDs (1-17)  in study GENA-99.  A detailed narrative of the 
three non-responding patients,  in particular of the  patient treated with  24 infusions, should be 
provided along with  a critical expert statement. 
3)  Additional explanation is requested for the  surgical efficacy ratings in study GENA-99. For  3/5 
rated procedures data for actual vs. expected blood loss are not available. Two rated procedures 
where a minor surgery of port removal, one with  reinsertion with  post-op 9 infusions whereas the 
other patient received only 2  infusion post-op. Additionally, one patient  with  right knee 
synovectomy (a major surgery) with  actual blood loss of 5 ml had 11  infusions of Nuwiq  post-op. It 
is thus unclear on which basis excellent ratings could have been achieved. 
4)  The inhibitor testing  procedures in study GENA-99 appear not to  be in line with  the 
EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009  guideline. For post-marketing investigation, a recovery and 
inhibitor  test in a central laboratory should confirm that  the patient is inhibitor  negative at study 
entry. The inhibitor  testing  schedule foresees inhibitor and recovery testing at ED10-15,  ED50-75, 
and at ED~100. It  remains unclear why not all subjects have been tested accordingly (taken into 
account those who could not be tested due to COVID-19 pandemic). Apparently only half of the 
patients have been tested at entry and during the study, and only a quarter at study end. A 
detailed explanation is requested by the MAH.  The MAH should also provide an outline or graphical 
presentation detailing time points and frequency of testing  for individual patients and it  should be 
highlighted  how many patients  have been tested in  accordance with the guideline. 
5)  For the complete GENA-pool including all age groups (N=216),  median prophylactic dosing per 
injection was 35.41 IU/kg (third  quartile Q3: 43.41 IU/kg, max: 101.9 IU/kg) and per ED 35.41 
IU/kg (Q3: 43.52  IU/kg, max: 103 IU/kg). For the age class ≥ 18  years (N=76), median 
prophylactic dosing per injection was 35.17 IU/kg (Q3: 42.55  IU/kg; max: 85.4  IU/kg). For  the 
age class <12 years (N=123),  median prophylactic dosing per injection was 36.33 IU/kg (Q3: 
44.12  IU/kg; max: 101.9  IU/kg). Data are derived from Table 14.2.3.1-1  of the study report. It 
appears that  a considerable portion, i.e. about a quarter of the patients  (adults as well as 
paediatrics), received higher than the recommended usual prophylactic dosing (20  to 40 IU/kg) 
with  maximum 2-fold of the recommended prophylactic dosing. A detailed clarification is 
requested. 
6)  Although ABR estimates generally lack sensitivity when  it comes to the  comparison of 
prophylactically treated patients, among the individual studies in the GENA-pool, the  GENA-21b 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/120573/2022  
Page 30/46 
 
 
 
study showed notable higher ABR frequencies. The MAH  is asked to provide a possible explanation 
for this observation. 
7)  In the integrated analysis, treatment  success rates for BE occurring under prophylactic treatment 
were 92.1%  for minor, 78.7%  for moderate to major, and 57.5%  for major to life-threatening 
bleeds (overall treatment  success was 84.3%).  These data just  partly align with  those reported in 
the Nuwiq  EPAR (EMA/CHMP/279301/2014).  E.g.  for moderate to major bleeds among the pivotal 
studies treatment success rates were 91.7%  (GENA-01), 100%  (GENA-08),  and 60.9%  (GENA-
03). Thus,  treatment efficacy for moderate to major bleeds appears to be somewhat lower in the 
integrated GENA-pool analysis. The MAH should comment on the clinical significance of this 
observation. 
8)  For the 51  surgeries in the integrated analysis, there was a mean total (preoperative, at surgery 
day, intraoperative, postoperative) number of 13  injections and 8.3  EDs, with  the majority in the 
postoperative stage. The maximum number of postoperative injections was 75.0  (median 9.5,  Q3: 
14) with  a maximum of 53 EDs (median: 6.00, Q3: 9.00).  I.e. in 25% of the surgical procedures 
14-75  injections have been administered postoperatively. This range appears unusual high and the 
MAH  is requested for clarification. 
9)  Integrated Safety Analysis 
a.  Apparently, one patient (GENA-21/  GENA-21B) experienced a total  of 5 ADRs (3x 
dizziness, 1x malaise, 1x chest pain). The MAH  is asked to provide additional 
clarification for this  accumulation of ADRs and to comment on any potential 
predisposing medical history.  
b.  Tightness of the chest is described SmPC and the package leaflet as possible side effect 
(Sections 4.4. and 4.8 of Annex I, Section 4 of Annex III). As from the integrated 
analysis, the ADR of chest pain (possible causality, mild severity, outcome: 
recovered/resolved) is not included in the tabulated  list of adverse reactions of the 
current SmPC. Clarification is requested. 
c.  Study procedures for FVIII inhibitor  testing appear to  be decoupled from the 
requirements set out  in the FVIII guideline. The MAH is requested to outline how many 
subjects had been scheduled for inhibitor testing  and how many finally have been 
tested according to  the schedule outlined  in the FVIII Guideline. Clarifications should 
be accompanied by an expert statement  on data validity.

10.  Assessment of the responses to the request for 
supplementary information 
10.1.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
Question 1 
The goal of study GENA-99 was to collect data in 200  PTPs with  HA (FVIII:C ≤2%).  The study was 
completed in 2021, with  data obtained from 78  patients. The MAH has stated that  in agreement with 
EMA in 2018,  patient  data from other post-authorisation studies will  contribute to the goal of 
documenting the long-term safety of treatment  with  Nuwiq in 200  PTPs. However, no reference 
regarding this  agreement has been made. The MAH  is asked for clarification. 
Summary of the WSA’s response 
In the Final Assessment Report for the Post-Authorisation Measure Vihuma 004.1,  Nuwiq 004.2,  dated 
23 March 2018  (in the report which was attached to the responses), the assessor commented: “It is 
considered acceptable to include data from patients participating in  post-marketing interventional 
studies, providing that the  protocol for the GENA-99 is followed with  regards to eligibility criteria and 
outcome parameters, and maintaining  the proportions of patients  as specified in  the protocol with 
regards to age distribution and severity of disease”. 
This was confirmed again by the  assessor in the Final  Assessment Report for the Post-Authorisation 
Measure MEA  004.3 and 004.2  dated 28 August 2018  (in the report which was attached to the 
responses). 
Assessment of the WSA’s response 
As from the referenced documents, the  MAH was requested to  discuss the low inclusion  rate of study 
GENA-99. It  was stated by the MAH  that  the low inclusion rate was due to strong competition  in the 
haemophilia A market and difficulties to  recruit participating  centres due to reluctance to participate in 
post-marketing studies as well as regulatory difficulties on a national level. CHMP  accepted to include 
data from patients  participating in post-marketing interventional studies, provided that  the protocol for 
the GENA -99 would  be adhered to  with regards to  eligibility criteria and outcome parameters.  
The MAH's submissions are therefore considered acceptable in respect to data compensation 
subsequent the low recruitment rate of the GENA-99 study. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved. 
Question 2 
The MAH is requested to  further clarify the numerical high  range of injections per treatment-emergent 
bleeding episode (1-24)  and EDs (1-17)  in study GENA-99. A detailed narrative of the three non-
responding patients, in particular of one patient  treated with  24 infusions,  should be provided along 
with  a critical expert statement. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/120573/2022  
Page 32/46 
 
 
 
Summary of the WSA’s response 
The MAH would like to clarify that  there were not “three non-responding patients”  but three bleeding 
episodes (BE) in three patients for which treatment efficacy was assessed as “none”. 
Overall, the percentage of “none” assessments in GENA-99 was 1.2%  and thus was comparable to 
adults undergoing prophylactic treatment  with  Nuwiq: GENA-08  (0.0%),  GENA-21 (1.7%),  GENA-21b 
(1.4%). 
The 3 patients in study GENA-99  that received a numerical high number of infusions and where 3 BEs 
were rated as none are discussed below. 
Patient 1 
This patient was on Nuwiq  for 3  years and was enrolled in GENA-99.  He experienced in total  5 BEs of 
moderate to major intensity and only one efficacy assessment was rated none, for an elbow bleed 
which required 10 infusions (9 with  25.97 IU/kg and 1 with  51.95  IU/kg) and lasted 7 days. The dose 
to treat this  BE may have been sub-optimal to treat a moderate to major BE (30-60  IU/kg are 
recommended in SmPC). All other moderate to major BEs were rated with  either good or moderate 
efficacy and were treated with  higher doses according to the SmPC (38.46-51.28  IU/kg). The efficacy 
of the left elbow bleed was originally assessed as “good” by the  patient/investigator but following  a 
query from the MAH  it was changed to  “none” based on the bleeding efficacy criteria in the patient 
diary. It should be noted that  the efficacy of two other moderate to major BEs which were treated with 
3 infusions (and lasted 3 days) was initially assessed as “good” and subsequently changed to 
“moderate” following  a query by the MAH  as per the definition  of the  efficacy assessment criterion for 
moderate. He completed the study according to  protocol with  182 EDs with  no suspicion of inhibitor 
while he was on the study. 
Patient 2 
This patient with  moderate haemophilia was on Nuwiq for 4 years and was enrolled in GENA-99. He 
experienced a total  of 19  BEs during the course of the  study, all spontaneous bleeds in  his left knee 
(indicating  a target joint).  Twelve of the BEs were of moderate to major intensity,  10 of which were 
treated with  1 or 2 infusions and the efficacy was rated as excellent (n=6) and good (n=4). 
The last moderate to major BE was treated with 4  infusions of Nuwiq,  was ongoing at the time of the 
completion visit and treatment was rated as “none”. The site informed the MAH that  the patient 
treated the bleeding until1  day after study completion and resumed his prophylaxis with  Nuwiq  4 days 
later.. The patient completed the study according to protocol, with  183 EDs with  no suspicion of 
inhibitor  formation. 
Patient 3 
This patient participated in  study GENA-21, thereafter continued  prophylaxis with Nuwiq  and was 
enrolled in GENA-99  2 years later. In GENA-21  he experienced one moderate to  major BE which 
required 1 infusion and the efficacy was rated as excellent. 
In the GENA-99 study the  patient experienced 2 BEs. The moderate to major spontaneous BE in the 
left knee was treated with  24 infusions of Nuwiq (11  with  65.6 IU/kg, 8 with  32.8 IU/kg, 2 with  49.13 
IU/kg, 2 with  16.4 IU/kg, and 1 with  24.6 IU/kg). The site reported: “It  was a target joint left  knee 
where he had sub clinical bleed. It needed 14 doses of Nuwiq  to treat to improve the  bleed, but  he 
continued to bleed into the  joint on the slightest exertion.” The patient tested negative for FVIII

Page 33/46 
 
 
 
 
inhibitors at  the end of this  BE. He discontinued the study prematurely at his own request with  a total 
of 34 EDs. 
Assessment of the WSA’s response 
The MAH provided additional information for three patients which each had one bleeding episodes for 
which treatment  efficacy was assessed as none. Individual reasons for the none-effective ratings (one 
BE was sub-optimally treated and two  cases were target joint bleeds) are acknowledged and data 
indicate that  these patients  generally responded to Nuwiq  treatment of other bleeding episodes. 
Therefore, it is endorsed that  these cases are consistent with  the favourable efficacy profile of Nuwiq. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved. 
Question 3 
Additional explanation is requested for the  surgical efficacy ratings in study GENA-99. For  3/5 rated 
procedures data for actual vs. expected blood loss are not  available. Two rated procedures where a 
minor surgery of port removal, one with  reinsertion with  post-op 9 infusions whereas the other patient 
received only 2 infusions post-op. Additionally, one patient with  right  knee synovectomy a major 
surgery with  actual blood loss of 5 ml had 11 infusions of Nuwiq post-op.  It is thus unclear on which 
basis excellent ratings could have been achieved. 
Summary of the WSA’s response 
Surgical efficacy ratings in GENA-99  were done by the surgeon/haematologist based on their clinical 
judgement, which took into account the  blood loss during and after surgery as well as the occurrence 
of post-surgical bleeding. 
The number of post-operative infusions or the duration of post-operative treatment were not taken 
into consideration for the  efficacy assessment. The decision as to  how long patients were to  be treated 
post-surgery was up to a sites’ standard of care and the clinical disposition of the patient. 
As per SmPC, for major surgery the treatment recommendation is as follow: Repeat infusion  every 8–
24 hours until  adequate wound healing (Factor VIII activity required 80–100%  [pre- and 
postoperative]), then  therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 
60% (IU/dL).  Considering the  treatment recommendations in the SmPC, the postoperative treatment 
in the surgeries in GENA-99  study did not deviate from those recommendations. 
In one patient  the port removal and reinsertion, which  was classified as minor, required 9 post-surgical 
infusions due to an infected port potentially delaying wound healing. 
As per communication with  the site the following was confirmed: “only a couple of additional days of 
treatment may be needed while  for a more complex port removal and reinsertion (e.g. an infected 
port, the usual treatment  is 3  days of 3-4  doses per day, then decreasing to 2  days of 2 doses per day 
then daily until  patients return to regular prophylaxis”.

No actual versus expected blood loss data were provided for 3 surgeries in  3 patients which are 
described in more detail below: 
Two of those procedures were port removal and port insertion procedures in2 patients,  with post-
operative treatment of 0 infusions and 2 infusions, respectively. In both  cases no bleeding was 
reported after surgery. One patient  resumed routine prophylactic infusions after the surgery and the 
other patient resumed prophylaxis after 2 post-surgery infusions. 
In comparison, port insertion and port removal procedures also occurred in studies GENA-03 and 
GENA-05. In these studies, the expected average blood loss was between 0 and 50 mL and actual 
blood loss was between 0 and 30 mL, with  the number of post-operative infusions to prevent bleeding 
ranging from 3 to  30. The majority of these procedures were rated as excellent and were considered to 
be successful. 
The 3rd procedure for which data on expected average and actual blood loss were not available is a hip 
prosthesis  the  patient was treated with  11 infusions / 8 EDs post-surgery to prevent bleeding. This 
treatment is also in line with  the SmPC. No bleeding during or after surgery was reported. 
Similar surgeries were performed both in pivotal study GENA-08 (expected blood loss 500  mL, actual 
blood loss 0 mL,  15 post-operative infusions) and in interventional study GENA-21b (expected blood 
loss 400 mL, actual blood loss 260 mL, 20 post-operative infusions). The efficacy assessment for both 
surgeries was excellent. 
In conclusion, prevention of post-surgical bleeding and not the  number of post-surgical infusions is the 
decisive factor in successful peri-operative prophylaxis in haemophilia patients. In study GENA-99,  no 
complications during surgery and no post-operative bleedings were reported for these 3 patients, 
justifying the excellent rating by the  investigators in this  study. 
Assessment of the WSA’s response 
The MAH further clarified the  assessment of the  surgical efficacy ratings, in particular that  number of 
post-operative infusions and the duration of post-operative treatment  were not accounted for. It  is 
acknowledged that  the surgical procedures have been treated in  line with SmPC recommendations and 
that  the efficacy assessment was based on individual clinical judgement rather than predefined criteria. 
Further details on the procedures and comparative efficacy data of other Nuwiq  studies suggest that 
surgical efficacy in GENA-99  study was at least in accordance with preceding results. The MAH's 
submissions on this  matter are therefore accepted. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved. 
Question 4 
The inhibitor testing  procedures in study GENA-99 appear not to  be in line with  the 
EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009  guideline. For post-marketing investigation, a recovery and inhibitor 
test in  a central laboratory should confirm that  the patient  is inhibitor negative at study entry. The 
inhibitor  testing schedule foresees inhibitor and recovery testing at ED10-15,  ED50-75, and at 
ED~100. It  remains unclear why not  all subjects have been tested accordingly (taken into account 
those who could not be tested due to COVID-19 pandemic). Apparently only half of the patients  have 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/120573/2022  
Page 35/46 
 
 
 
 
been tested  at entry and during the  study, and only a quarter at  study end. A detailed explanation is 
requested by the MAH.  The MAH should also provide an outline  or graphical presentation detailing time 
points and frequency of testing for individual patients and it  should be highlighted  how many patients 
have been tested in accordance with the guideline. 
Summary of the WSA’s response 
The MAH is aware of the EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009  guideline and implemented a testing schedule 
for inhibitors (using a central lab) and in-vivo-recovery into the  GENA-99 protocol. However, this 
schedule differs significantly from routine clinical practice, and thus the testing  schedule could not  be 
enforced but only recommended in GENA-99, which  was designed as a non-interventional study. In 
routine clinical practice inhibitor  testing  is performed less frequently [1] and testing  was done 
according to  the local standard of care. Inhibitor testing  is usually infrequent for previously treated 
patients (PTPs) if there are no clinical symptoms that  indicate inhibitory activity, such as frequent 
bleeds under prophylaxis or ineffective treatment of BEs. The World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) 
for example recommends inhibitor testing in PTPs to be performed once every 12 months  [2], using 
local laboratories. In addition,  the study design which included the use of a central laboratory posed 
problems for a non-interventional  study. The MAH  reported the difficulties  in implementing the above-
mentioned guidelines to EMA in 2018;  (Responses to List  of Questions in final AR dated 14 December 
2017  (PAM MEA 004/004.01),  Nuwiq  sequence 63/  Vihuma sequence 12)  this was submitted on 01 
February 2018  and was acknowledged by the assessor in their response. In fact, in order to conduct 
study GENA-99 in  France, the MAH  had to issue an amended protocol to  remove all interventional 
aspects of the study in  order to receive approval from the authorities. 
The MAH would like to point  out that,  according to the protocol, the outcome parameter for assessing 
immunogenicity of Nuwiq was the incidence of FVIII inhibitors with  the diagnosis based on clinical 
observation and confirmed by FVIII inhibitor  testing in the  laboratory. No clinical symptoms led to 
suspicion of inhibitor formation in any patient  treated with Nuwiq  in the  study GENA-99 which would  in 
turn justify inhibitor  testing in  the routine care of the patients enrolled in this study. Whether or not a 
suspicion of inhibitor formation is present was actively asked for each patient visit and recorded in the 
CRF. 
In total 122  inhibitor tests were performed in study GENA-99, in 62/78  patients. The total  number of 
inhibitor  tests performed per time point are presented in Table 4. 
Of note, out of 16 patients  who did not have any inhibitor testing  while on the study, 14  were from EU 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/120573/2022  
Page 36/46 
 
 
 
 
member states. The reason why the inhibitor  test could not be performed is listed  in List 16.2.8-3  for 
each visit.  Covid-19 affected inhibitor testing  for 7 patients  that  were scheduled to  be tested between 
ED50-75 and 4 patients  at ED~100 (List  16.2.8-3).  These tests  could not be performed. 
In conclusion, the guideline deviates from standard practice and mandated blood draws at  defined 
timepoints with  central laboratory testing posed obstacles for ethics committee approvals in France 
and the UK, both member states of EMA  at the time (see also Responses to List of Questions in final 
AR dated 14  December 2017 (PAM  MEA 004/004.01),  Nuwiq  sequence 63/  Vihuma sequence 12).  In 
order for the study to be approved by ethics committees, inhibitor testing  had to be performed per the 
sites standard practice. Clinical symptoms for inhibitory activity were monitored during the  study. 
Furthermore, the MAH  has provided data showing the  safety of Nuwiq.  As neither suspicion of inhibitor 
nor other ADRs such as hypersensitivity reactions or thromboembolic events were reported during the 
observational period, the  favourable safety profile of Nuwiq as previously shown in pivotal studies was 
confirmed. Please also refer to the critical expert statement  attached in section 2.5.

One-Pager: Chapter 8_Recommendations_Inhibitors to Clotting  Factor (wfh.org) 
Assessment of the WSA’s response 
It is acknowledged that  due to  the non-interventional study design and definition of the safety 
outcome the inhibitor testing  procedures in GENA-99 study deviate from recommendations made in the 
EMA FVIII Guideline. Consequently, only a minority of patients have been tested for FVIII inhibitory 
antibodies at any time  point. This compromises the validity of the  submitted immunogenicity data.  
As from the critical expert statement,  the MAH  confirmed that  “all patients were monitored for clinical 
symptoms leading to suspicion of inhibitor formation, with  the investigator documenting yes or no for 
the presence of such symptoms at each visit. Any patients  with such symptoms were to be followed-up 
with  laboratory tests for inhibitor  formation. No patient  in study GENA-99 presented with  clinical 
symptoms that  led to suspicion of inhibitor formation according to the  investigators”.  
Considering the  study design and the primary outcome definition,  it is acknowledged that  study results 
generally could reflect an expectable low inhibitor  incidence in PTPs.  
Conclusion  
Issue not  further pursued.

Question 5 
For the complete GENA-pool including all age groups (N=216),  median prophylactic dosing per 
injection was 35.41 IU/kg (third  quartile Q3: 43.41 IU/kg, max: 101.9 IU/kg) and per ED 35.41  IU/kg 
(Q3: 43.52  IU/kg, max: 103 IU/kg). For the  age class ≥  18 years (N=76),  median prophylactic dosing 
per injection  was 35.17  IU/kg (Q3: 42.55  IU/kg; max: 85.4 IU/kg). For the age class <12  years 
(N=123),  median prophylactic dosing per injection was 36.33 IU/kg (Q3: 44.12  IU/kg; max: 101.9 
IU/kg). Data are derived from Table 14.2.3.1-1  of the study report. It  appears that a considerable 
portion, i.e. about a quarter of the patients  (adults as well as paediatrics), received higher than the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/120573/2022  
Page 37/46 
 
 
 
 
recommended usual prophylactic dosing (20 to 40  IU/kg) with  maximum 2-fold of the  recommended 
prophylactic dosing. A detailed clarification is requested. 
Summary of the WSA’s response 
Appendix 2 submitted  as part of the response shows that  61 patients (28.2%)  of the 216  patients from 
the GENA-pool received an average prophylactic dose of more than  41 IU/kg. These 61 patients 
participated in studies GENA-15, GENA-21,  GENA-21b, and GENA-100. 
The majority of these patients (N=42)  fall into the age class <12  years (study GENA-15, GENA-13, 
GENA-99, and GENA-100).  Twenty-eight of those patients under the age of 12  received a dose 
between 41 and 50 IU/kg and 14 received a dose ≥50 IU/kg. Deviations from the  recommended dose 
range were generally due to  the low body weight  of some patients and the instruction  to use entire vial 
contents in interventional studies. 
In studies GENA-21 and GENA-21b, which  enrolled patients ≥  18 years, the allowed dose range was 
up to 80  IU/kg and up to 65  IU/kg, respectively. The goal of these studies was to optimize the dosing 
based on PK-guided (personalized) prophylaxis. 
Single patients in GENA-99 and GENA-100  received higher doses due medical reasons. For example, 
one patient who underwent synovectomy during the study, had a history of right  knee synovitis, a pre-
condition that  may warrant the treating  physician to dose higher, as recommended in the prescribing 
information. 
In study GENA-100, 4  out of 7 patients who were dosed above 41 IU/kg, both children and adults, had 
several target joints (2-10)  requiring treatment with  higher doses. One patient had a history of 
intracranial bleeding that  may have necessitated prescription of higher doses. 
Of note, the recommendations for long-term prophylaxis in the SmPC indicate that  “In some cases, 
especially in younger patients,  shorter dosage intervals and higher doses may be necessary”, which is 
due to the shorter half-life and faster clearance of FVIII in  children. It  should also be considered that 
the dosing recommendations for routine prophylaxis with Nuwiq  for children differ between countries. 
For example, while the European SmPC recommends a usual dose of 20-40  IU/kg, the US Prescribing 
Information recommends a dose of 30 to  50 IU/kg for children between 2 to 11 years.  
In conclusion, patients may be prescribed higher doses for various reasons in routine clinical practice. 
Assessment of the WSA’s response 
The MAH admits that  there were a large number of patients receiving higher than recommended 
prophylactic doses. A large proportion of these patients were paediatric which is why higher dosing 
regimen were applied, with  altered PK as the most common underlying reason. Further  reasons for 
higher prophylactic dosing were personalised (PK-based) prophylaxis in adults  as well, or individual 
medical history reasons including presence of target joints, bleedings, or scheduled surgery.  
Although the  number and extent of higher prophylactic doses are considered noticeable, the MAH's 
comments on this matter can be accepted. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved.

Question 6 
Although ABR estimates generally lack sensitivity when  it come to the  comparison of prophylactically 
treated patients, among the individual studies in the GENA-pool, the GENA-21b  study showed notable 
higher ABR frequencies. The MAH is asked to provide a possible explanation for this  observation. 
Summary of the WSA’s response 
Figure 1 shows the total  ABR of the studies included in the GENA-pool. 
The ABRs appear to be fairly comparable to each other. A post-hoc non-parametric analysis according 
to Kruskal-Wallis revealed that the  differences in the GENA-pool between GENA-21b  (study in adults) 
and paediatric studies GENA-13  and-15 are statistically significant  (p<0.05),  but there is no 
statistically significant  difference between GENA-21b  and the other studies (GENA-21, GENA-99, 
GENA-100)  that enrolled adult patients (see Table 5). However, this analysis is limited  as it  is not the 
outcome of a prospectively planned analysis, but of a post-hoc analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/120573/2022  
Page 39/46 
 
 
 
 
 
It is correct that  Table 12  of the  integrated study report indicates that  the median ABR of the  25 
patients from GENA-21b in the  GENA-99 integrated analysis was 4.41 (also shown in Table 5 above) 
and thus higher than  in the other studies; however, the median ABR of these 25  patients was also 
higher than the median ABR of 2.04 of all 56 patients  included in the entire GENA-21b study (GENA- 
21b Clinical Study Report). Of note, study GENA-21b enrolled Japanese patients  which were not 
included in any other studies with  Nuwiq.  The median ABR of the  10 Japanese patients was about 50% 
higher than those of the entire study population: 3.04  vs 2.04  (GENA-21b Clinical Study Report). The 
percentage of Japanese patients from GENA-21b included in the GENA-pool analysis was higher than in 
the entire study (10 of 25 =  40.0% vs 10 of 56 = 17.9%),  which may contribute to the relatively high 
ABR of the GENA-21b patients  in the GENA-99-pool analysis. Based on the  data available from the 
Japanese patients in GENA-21b  and the full clinical development program, the  Japanese authority 
(PMDA) granted marketing authorisation for Nuwiq  in January 2021. 
Lastly, when looking at competitor studies with  prophylactic treatment, the  mean ABR ranged for 
example from 1.6  (inter quartile range: 0.0,  4.7) for Eloctate [1] to 3.7  (±4.7)  for the overall 
population and 4.0 (±3.4)  for the Japanese subpopulation for Adynovate [2]. 
Considering the  range of ABRs reported and median ABRs, the variability of the data, and differing 
patient populations,  the ABRs observed in pivotal study GENA-21b  can be considered to be within  the 
range of those reported for other products when  used prophylactically. The higher ABRs compared to 
the other GENA studies can be considered to reflect expected inter-study variability, which has also 
been observed with  other products.

Assessment of the WSA’s response 
Post-hoc one-way ANOVA results indicated higher ABRs in adult  study GENA-21b when compared to 
paediatric studies GENA-13  and-15. However, no statistical  significance was observed in comparison to 
ABRs of other studies that enrolled adult patients. The non-significantly higher ABRs in study GENA-
21B can be at least partly explained by a differences in the study  population. The argumentation can 
be followed and is acceptable.

Conclusion 
Issue resolved. 
Question 7 
In the integrated analysis, treatment success rates for BE occurring under prophylactic treatment were 
92.1%  for minor, 78.7%  for moderate to major, and 57.5% for major to life-threatening bleeds 
(overall treatment success was 84.3%).  These data just partly align with  those reported in the Nuwiq 
EPAR (EMA/CHMP/279301/2014).  E.g.  for moderate to major bleeds among the pivotal studies 
treatment success rates were 91.7%  (GENA-01), 100%  (GENA-08),  and 60.9%  (GENA-03).  Thus, 
treatment efficacy for moderate to major bleeds appears to be somewhat lower in the integrated 
GENA-pool analysis. The MAH should comment on the clinical significance of this  observation.  
Summary of the WSA’s response 
The MAH has reviewed the success rate for BEs by age class. Whereas the  age distribution  in the 
individual pivotal studies was more homogeneous, the age distribution in  the integrated analysis was 
more diverse with  56.9% of the patients  under the  age of 12 and an age range between 1 and 71 
years. 
When comparing efficacy success among the same age class, success rates are aligned between the 
integrated analysis and the pivotal studies as shown below and are slightly higher in children in the 
integrated analysis as compared to GENA-03 (Table 6). 
In conclusion, the success rate of the  treatment of moderate to major BEs as well as for all severities 
was comparable between the  pivotal studies GENA-01,  GENA-03 and GENA-08 and the integrated 
analysis, and does not  fall short when comparison is made among the same age groups. 
Assessment of the WSA’s response 
The MAH clarified that deviations in the reported treatment  success rates of the integrated GENA-pool 
analysis when compared to individual studies reported in the EPAR result from different age 
distributions,  i.e. in the integrated analysis a larger proportion of paediatric patients <12  years of age 
was present and which  had slightly  lower success rates. Age-staggered efficacy data of the integrated 
Assessment report

analysis demonstrate that these are in  line with  success rates of other relevant studies.  
Conclusion 
Issue resolved. 
Question 8 
For the 51  surgeries in the integrated analysis, there was a mean total (preoperative, at surgery day, 
intraoperative, postoperative) number of 13 injections and 8.3 EDs, with  the majority in the 
postoperative stage. The maximum number of postoperative injections was 75.0  (median 9.5,  Q3: 14) 
with  a maximum of 53 EDs (median: 6.00,  Q3: 9.00).  I.e. in 25%  of the surgical procedures 14-75 
injections have been administered postoperatively. This range appears unusual high  and the  MAH is 
requested for clarification. 
Summary of the WSA’s response 
The peri-operative practice in treating Hemophilia A patients’ is to infuse prior to the surgery 
(generally 1 and sometimes 2 infusions) to  maintain haemostasis during the surgery. Intra-operative 
infusions will be given in some cases, if needed. The majority of the infusions are typically given post-
surgically (post-surgical prophylaxis) starting  after the last suture with  the goal to prevent bleeding. 
The duration and number of infusions of the post-surgical treatment depends on the  type and severity 
of the surgery, and a patient’s  clinical situation. 
Per the SmPC, for major surgery the  recommendation is as follows: Repeat infusion  every 8–24 hours 
until  adequate wound healing (Factor  VIII activity required 80–100%  (pre- and postoperative)), then 
therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30%  to 60% (IU/dL). 
Considering the  treatment recommendations in the SmPC, the perioperative treatment in GENA studies 
did not deviate from those recommendations. 
Surgeries that required a higher number of post-surgical prophylactic infusions were major surgeries (
≥20  infusions) and clinical practice may differ from institute  to  institute  and country to  country (see 
Table 7).

Table 7:  Surgeries with ≥14  post-operative Nuwiq  infusions 
For example, 5 surgeries requiring more than 30  post-surgical prophylactic infusions were looked into 
in more detail and are described below: 
In study GENA-21: 
•  One major surgery required 75 post-operative infusions (53  EDs): one patient  experienced 
appendicitis. He was hospitalised for an emergency appendectomy and subsequently 
experienced postoperative wound infection which required extensive treatment.  Actual blood 
loss was 20  mL (10 mL more than the average expected). No wound hematomas were 
observed. No post-operative bleeding was documented. 
•  One major surgery required 42 post-operative infusions (21  EDs): one patient  underwent plate 
Osteosynthesis of left distal Tibia. The actual blood loss was 80 mL less than the  average 
expected blood loss. No  wound hematomas were observed. No post-operative bleeding was 
documented. 
In study GENA-21b: 
•  One major surgery required 45 post-operative infusions (36  EDs): one Patient underwent  total 
knee replacement. The average expected and actual blood loss did  not differ (Difference=0). 
One post-surgical bleeding was reported 18 days after the surgery that  lasted 4 days and 
Assessment report

required 7 infusions. 
•  One major surgery required 38 post-operative infusions (32  EDs): one patient  underwent 
Synovectomia anterior articulatio tallocruralis lateralis dexter. The average expected and actual 
blood loss did not  differ (Difference=0). No  wound hematomas were observed. No post-
operative bleeding was documented. 
In study GENA-13: 
•  One major surgery required 36 post-operative infusions (23  EDs): one patient  underwent 
emergency Evacuation Hemarthrosis of the  left knee by puncture (Installation of splint) 
following intensive physical activity. Information on blood loss were not  available. No wound 
hematomas were observed post-operatively. No post-operative bleeding was documented. 
Considering the  heterogeneity in the surgical procedures and local routine protocols for post-surgical 
prophylaxis to prevent post-surgical bleeding in different hospitals, the number of post-surgical 
infusions may vary and do not reflect successful peri-operative prophylaxis in haemophilia patients. 
The higher number of infusions for some surgeries can be considered to reflect expected variability in 
routine post-surgical prophylaxis and may not be unusually high. In addition, several of the procedures 
were orthopaedic procedures that may require additional coverage during physical therapy when 
regaining mobility. 
Assessment of the WSA’s response 
The MAH clarified that large heterogeneity among routine  protocols for surgical prophylaxis was 
present at different study sites. Moreover, the  MAH detailed 5 major surgeries that  required >30 post-
surgical prophylactic infusions. These procedures included the following: i)  emergency appendectomy 
with  post-operative wound infection (75  post-op. infusion, 53 EDs), ii) plate osteosynthesis of distal 
Tibia (42 post-op. infusions, 21  EDs), iii)  total knee replacement with  post-surgical bleeding (45 post-
op. infusions, 36 EDs), iv) synovectomy upper ankle joint  (38 post-op. infusions, 32 EDs), v) 
evacuation haemarthrosis (36  post-op. infusions, 23 EDs).  
Provided details on the major surgeries and underlying reasons for the high number of post-op. 
infusions are acknowledged. It is further acknowledged that  routine practice for surgical prophylaxis 
can vary markedly in this  respect among local study sites. 
It should be noted in conclusion that presented data for prophylaxis of major surgeries in the 
integrated GENA-analysis do not well align with  data presented in  the Nuwiq EPAR, but  rather reflect 
variability of routine use. 
Conclusion 
Issue not  further pursued. 
Question 9 
Integrated Safety Analysis 
a.  Apparently, one patient (GENA-21/  GENA-21B) experienced a total  of 5 ADRs (3x 
dizziness, 1x malaise, 1x chest pain). The MAH  is asked to provide additional 
clarification for this  accumulation of ADRs and to comment on any potential 
predisposing medical history.  
b.  Tightness of the chest is described SmPC and the package leaflet as possible side effect 
(Sections 4.4. and 4.8 of Annex I, Section 4 of Annex III). As from the integrated 
analysis, the ADR of chest pain (possible causality, mild severity, outcome: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/120573/2022  
Page 44/46 
 
 
 
recovered/resolved) is not included in the tabulated  list of adverse reactions of the 
current SmPC. Clarification is requested. 
c.  Study procedures for FVIII inhibitor  testing appear to  be decoupled from the 
requirements set out  in the FVIII guideline. The MAH is requested to outline how many 
subjects had been scheduled for inhibitor testing  and how many finally have been 
tested according to  the schedule outlined  in the FVIII Guideline. Clarifications should 
be accompanied by an expert statement  on data validity. 
Summary of the WSA’s response 
a.  The MAH would like to clarify that  there was no accumulation of ADRs in a single patient, the 
two patients  noted from GENA-21  and GENA-21b  study are two different study subjects: 
  Malaise and dizziness in one patient in study GENA-21  were considered temporally 
associated with  Nuwiq  administration, were nonserious, and resolved. 
  Chest pain and dizziness (2 events) in one patient in study GENA-21b  were considered 
temporally associated with  Nuwiq  administration by the investigator, and occurred 12.3 
hrs, 19.5 hrs and 37.3 hrs following an infusion of Nuwiq,  respectively. The ADRs were 
mild, non-serious, and resolved. 
b.  The MAH has committed to update the  SmPC to include the ADRs from GENA-21b study by 
March 2022. 
c.  Appendix 3 submitted  as part of the response, showed the number of inhibitor tests per patient 
and per visit schedule according to EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009  guideline. The total 
number of inhibitor  tests performed per time point  are presented in  Table 8.

Assessment of the WSA’s response 
For the integrated safety analysis, the MAH  clarified that  there was no accumulation of ADRs in a single 
patient.  In addition,  it was committed to update the  SmPC in order to include the ADR of chest pain 
(GENA-21b study)  in March 2022. As stated above for the  GENA-99 study (see Question 4)  the 
inhibitor  testing procedures underlying the  integrated analysis deviate from recommendation made in 
the EMA FVIII Guideline. There is no consistent  testing schedule which foresees that i) a recovery and 
inhibitor  test in a central laboratory should confirm that  the patient is inhibitor  negative at study entry 
and ii) inhibitor  and recovery testing at ED10-15,  ED50-75, and at ED~100  (as recommended in the 
EMA Guideline). Of the GENA-Pool including N=216  subjects, only a minority of the subjects have been 
tested consequently for inhibitors,  in particular at  the recommended time points  of ED10-15 
(N=25/216;  11%) and ED 50-75 (N=78/216;  36%).  However, it was confirmed that a majority of 
patients (N=191/216;  88%)  has been tested at other time points between screening and before 
accumulating ≥100  EDs. No  patient in the GENA-Pool was tested positive for FVIII inhibitors  or had 
clinical symptoms suspicious of inhibitor formation. As there is no overall evidence of an increased 
immunogenicity risk for Nuwiq,  this issue is not further pursued. 
Conclusion 
Issues resolved or not  further pursued. 
 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly. 
Of Note:  An Article 46 procedure has not  been submitted  and evaluated for the  GENA-99-Study.

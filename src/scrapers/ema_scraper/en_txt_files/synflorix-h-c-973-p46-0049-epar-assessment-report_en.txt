Immunogenicity 
• 
Evaluation of the immune responses to the components of the investigational vaccine, 
one month post-vaccination. 
•  Concentrations  of  antibodies  against  pneumococcal serotypes  1,  4,  5,  6A,  6B,  7F,  9V, 
14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F. 
•  Concentrations of antibodies against protein D. 
•  Statistical Methods 
Analyses were performed as per protocol. 
Demography: 
•  Demographic  characteristics  (age  in  months,  gender,  geographic  ancestry)  were 
tabulated per group. 
The  mean  age  (plus  range  and  standard  deviation)  of  the  enrolled  subjects  was 
calculated. 
The distribution of subjects enrolled among the study centres was tabulated. 
• 
• 
Analysis of safety: 
• 
• 
The percentage of subjects with at least one local AE (solicited and unsolicited), with at 
least one general AE (solicited and unsolicited) and with any AE during the 31-day (Day 
0-Day  30)  follow-up  period  after  vaccination  was  tabulated  for  each  group  with  exact 
95%  Confidence  Interval  (CI).  The  same  calculations  were  performed  for  symptoms 
rated as grade 3 and general symptoms with causal relationship to vaccination. 
The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  each  individual  solicited  local  and  general  AE 
during  the  7-day  (Day  0-Day  6)  solicited  follow-up  period  after  vaccination  was

• 
The same tabulation was performed for grade 3 solicited AEs and for solicited AEs with 
causal relationship to vaccination. For redness and swelling, grade 2 or 3 AEs were also 
tabulated. Occurrence of fever was reported per 0.5°C cumulative increments. 
•  All  the  above  tabulations  for  each  individual  solicited  AE  were  also  performed  for  the 
• 
• 
• 
first 4 days after vaccination (Day 0-Day 3). 
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  at  least  one  report  of  unsolicited  AE  classified  by  the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and reported up to 30 days after 
vaccination was tabulated with exact 95% CI for each group. The same tabulation was 
performed  for  grade  3  unsolicited  AEs  and  for  unsolicited  AEs  with  a  relationship  to 
vaccination. 
The proportion of AEs resulting in a medically attended visit was also tabulated. 
The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  who  took  concomitant  medication/antipyretic 
at  least  once  during  the  7-day  (Day  0-Day  6)  solicited  follow-up  period  after 
vaccination were tabulated for each group with exact 95% CI. The above tabulation for 
concomitant  medication/antipyretic  was  also  performed  for  the  first  4  days  after 
vaccination (Day 0-Day 3). 
•  SAEs,  large  swelling  reactions  and  withdrawal(s)  due  to  SAE(s)  were  described  in 
detail.  
Analysis of immunogenicity: 
•  Geometric  mean  concentrations  (GMCs)  and  seropositivity  rates  with  95%  CIs  were 
tabulated for each group  and for each serotype/antigen, prior to and one month after 
vaccination. 
The distribution of antibody concentrations/titres for each appropriate serotype/antigen 
was displayed using tables and/or reverse cumulative distribution curves. 
• 
  Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A  total  of  61  subjects  were  enrolled  in  this  study:  31  subjects  in  the  12Pn_T  group  and  30 
subjects in the 10Pn_T group. 
•  Baseline data 
The cohort used for the analysis of the primary objective is the Total vaccinated cohort. 
In this cohort, the mean age of subjects at the time of vaccination was 15.0 months, 
55.7%  of  subjects  were  female  and  98.4%  of  subjects  were  of  White  Caucasian/European 
heritage. 
• 
Immunogenicity results 
Prior  to  vaccination,  for  each  of  the  10  common  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes,  at  least 
63.3%  of  subjects  in  the  12Pn_T  group  and  at  least  41.7 %  of  subjects  in  the  10Pn_T  group 
had  antibody  concentrations  ≥0.2  µg/mL.  For  serotypes  6A  and  19A,  this  percentage  was 
36.7% and 66.7%, respectively in the 12Pn_T group and 20.0% and 36.0% respectively in the 
10Pn_T group. 
One month post-vaccination, for each of the 10 common vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, all 
subjects  in  both  groups  had  antibody  concentrations  ≥0.2  µg/mL.  For  serotypes  6A  and  19A, 
this  percentage  was  100%  for  both  serotypes  in  the  12Pn_T  group  and  84.6%  and  96.3%, 
respectively in the 10Pn_T group. 
For  each  of  the  pneumococcal  serotypes,  an  increase  was  observed  in  antibody  GMCs  one 
month post-vaccination compared to GMCs observed prior to vaccination in both groups.

Solicited local adverse events 
The incidence of each solicited local AE during the 7-day (Day 0-Day 6) postvaccination period 
is shown in table 30. During the 7-day post-vaccination period: 
Grade 3 solicited local AEs were reported for: 
•  2 subjects (6.5%) (redness) and 3 subjects (9.7%) (swelling) out of 31 subjects in the 
12Pn_T group and,  
•  1 subject (3.4%) (swelling), out of 29 subjects in the 10Pn_T group. 
As  per  protocol,  all  grade  3  solicited  local  AEs  were  considered  to  be  causally  related  to 
vaccination. 
Redness  at  injection  site  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  local  AE  in  both  groups 
(64.5% subjects in the 12Pn_T group and 65.5% subjects in the 10Pn_T group). 
Table  30  Incidence  of  solicited  local  symptoms  reported  during  the  7-day  (Days  0-6)  post-
vaccination period (Total vaccinated cohort) 
Solicited general adverse events 
The  incidence  of  each  solicited  general  AE  during  the  7-day  (Day  0-Day  6)  postvaccination 
period is shown in table 32 .  
During the 7-day post-vaccination period: 
•  Grade 3 solicited general AEs were reported for: 
o  1 subject (3.2%) (fever) out of 31 subjects in the 12Pn_T group and, 
o  1 subject (3.4%) (irritability/fussiness) and 1 subject (3.4%) (fever) out of 29 
in the 10Pn_T group. 
• 
• 
The grade 3 solicited general AE reported in the 12Pn_T group was not considered by 
the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to  vaccination.  In  the  10Pn_T  group,  the  two 
reported  grade  3  solicited  general  AEs  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be 
causally related to vaccination. 
Irritability/fussiness  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  AE  during  the 
7-day  post-vaccination  period  (48.4%  subjects  in  the  12Pn_T  group  and  48.3% 
subjects in the 10Pn_T group).

Table  32  Incidence  of  solicited  general  symptoms  reported  during  the  7-day  (Days  0-6) 
post-vaccination period (Total vaccinated cohort) 
Unsolicited adverse events 
At least one unsolicited AE was reported for 58.1% of subjects in the 12Pn_T group and 50.0% 
of  subjects  in  the  10Pn_T  group  during  the  31-day  post-vaccination  period.  Rhinitis  was  the 
most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  AE  in  the  12Pn_T  group  [4  subjects  (12.9%)]  while 
diarrhea, bronchitis, otitis externa, rhinitis and viral infection were most frequently reported in 
the 10Pn_T group [2 subjects (6.7%)]. 
No  grade  3  unsolicited  AEs  or  grade  3  unsolicited  AEs  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be 
causally related to vaccination were reported in both groups.  
Serious adverse events 
No fatal or non-fatal SAEs were reported during the study. No subject was withdrawn from the 
study due to an AE or SAE.  
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  immunogenicity  data  from  this  study  generally  confirm  what  is  known  from  other  studies  using 
Synflorix.  Likewise,  the  safety  data  do  not  add  any  new  safety  concerns  for  Synflorix,  and  the 
reactogenicity  profile  is  similar  to  that  seen  in  other  studies.  Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  no 
further regulatory action is needed.

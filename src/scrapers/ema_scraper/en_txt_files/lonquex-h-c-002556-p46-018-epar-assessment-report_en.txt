1.  Introduction 
On  19/10/2018,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Lonquex  (lipegfilgrastim),  in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  states  that  study  XM22-08  is  part  of  the  company  overall  paediatric  clinical  development 
program.  A  forthcoming  variation  application,  consisting  of  the  full  paediatric  relevant  data  package 
(i.e. containing several studies) is expected to be submitted. A line listing of all the concerned studies 
is annexed. 
Lonquex  (lipegfilgrastim)  has  been  developed  for  the  prevention  and  management  of  chemotherapy-
induced  neutropenia.  It  was  approved  for  use  in  adults  by  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  in 
2013  with  the  therapeutic  indications:  Lonquex  is  indicated  in  adults  for  reduction  in  the  duration  of 
neutropenia  and  the  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  in  patients  treated  with  cytotoxic  chemotherapy 
for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes). 
The  Applicant  agreed  on  paediatric  investigation  plan  (PIP)  in  2011  and  the  subsequent  PIP 
modifications were agreed in September 2017 (EMEA-001019-PIP01-10-M04).  
The primary objective of the PIP Phase 1 Study XM22-07 was to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) 
of 
lipegfilgrastim,  with  assessment  of  pharmacodynamics,  efficacy,  safety,  tolerability,  and 
immunogenicity as secondary objectives.  
The  primary  objective  of  the  PIP  Phase  2  Study  XM22-08,  was  to  investigate  in  paediatric  patients 
diagnosed with Ewing Family of Tumours or Rhabdomyosarcoma receiving chemotherapy, the efficacy 
of  multiple  doses  of  lipegfilgrastim  (administered  once  per  cycle)  compared  with  filgrastim 
(administered  several  times  per  cycle)  (Lipegfilgrastim  100  μg/kg  body  weight  in  comparison  to 
Filgrastim 5 μg/kg body weight); secondary objectives were to assess pharmacodynamics, PK, safety, 
tolerability,  and  immunogenicity.  The  efficacy  data  obtained  from  the  Phase  1  and  2  studies  will  be 
extrapolated to the children less than 2 years of age.  
The  current  submission  is  (in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006)  the 
addendum (follow-up period) to the clinical study report XM22-08 (already assessed in the procedure 
EMA/H/C/002556/P46/017, with UK acting as the Rapporteur for the procedure). The last patient last 
visit  of  the  follow  up  period  for  study  XM22-08  was  8  January  2019.  The  current  addendum  report 
contains the follow up data on survival, cancer status, growth (height and weight), concomitant G-CSF, 
serious adverse events (SAEs), and immunogenicity. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Lonquex  (lipegfilgrastim)  is  a  glyco-polyethylene  glycol  (PEG)ylated  formulation  of  a  recombinant  N-
methionyl  human  granulocyte-colony  stimulating  factor  (r-metHuG-CSF)  that  has  been  developed  for 
the  prevention  of  CTX-induced  neutropenia.  In  Study  XM22-08,  lipegfilgrastim  was  supplied  in  glass 
vials containing 1 mL sterile, clear, colourless to pale yellow, preservative-free solution for sc injection

consisting  of  lipegfilgrastim  at  a  concentration  of  10  mg/mL  as  well  as  excipients  (acidic  sodium 
acetate  buffer,  sorbitol  [E420],  polysorbate  20,  and  water  for  injection),  especially  developed  for  the 
lipegfilgrastim  paediatric  studies.  The  maximum  dose  was  to  be  6  mg,  as  this  is  the  fixed  dose  for 
adults. Injection of lipegfilgrastim was to be made using a fine graded syringe (grading mark 0.01 mL). 
After  the  syringe  was  filled  with  lipegfilgrastim,  the  needle  was  to  be  changed.  Injection  was  to  be 
made with a new 27G x½-inch injection needle. The abdomen was the preferred location for injection. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  MAH  has  submitted  an  addendum  report  of  Study  XM22-08  containing  data  from  the  follow  up 
period. The final report from study XM22-08 was assessed by the UK (EMA/H/C/002556/P46/017).

Study XM22-08 
Description 
Methods 
The methods of the study below were described in the Rapporteurs (UK) assessment report (below in 
italics)  dated  21st  of  March,  2019  (EMEA/H/C/002556/P46/017).  The  current  report  concerns  the 
follow-up  data  collected  on  Day  180  (±2  weeks)  and  Day  365  (±2  weeks)  including  survival,  cancer 
status,  growth  (height  and  weight),  concomitant  G-CSF,  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  and 
immunogenicity. 
Objectives (primary study) 
Primary  Objective:  Assess  the  efficacy  of  a  single  sc  dose  of  100  μg/kg  body  weight  (BW)  of 
lipegfilgrastim  per  cycle  compared  to  daily  sc  doses  of  5  μg/kg  BW  of  filgrastim  in  children  receiving 
CTX. 
Secondary  Objective:  Assess  pharmacodynamics,  pharmacokinetics,  safety,  tolerability,  and 
immunogenicity  of  a  single  sc  dose  of  100  μg/kg  BW  of  lipegfilgrastim  per  cycle  compared  to  daily  5 
μg/kg BW of filgrastim doses. 
Study design 
A  Phase  2,  multicenter,  open-label,  randomized,  active-controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy,  PK, 
pharmacodynamics,  safety,  tolerability,  and  immunogenicity of  lipegfilgrastim at  a  dose of  100  μg/kg 
body  weight  (BW)  in  comparison  with  filgrastim  at  daily  doses  of  5  μg/kg  BW  in  paediatric  patients 
diagnosed  with  the  Ewing  family  of  tumours  or  rhabdomyosarcoma  receiving  cytotoxic  chemotherapy 
(CTX).  
Screening  period  of  up  to  2  weeks  with  a  treatment  period  for  a  maximum  of  18  weeks,  which 
consisted  of  4  cycles  of  CTX  of  21  days  each  with  an  allowance  of  14-day  delay  between  each  CTX 
cycle;  and  a  follow-up  period  of  up  to  365  days  from  first  investigational  medicinal  product  (IMP) 
administration. An end of study (EOS)/or early termination (ET) visit was performed 4 weeks after the 
start of the last CTX [±3 days]). Follow-up visits were performed on days 180 (±2 weeks) and 365 (±2 
weeks) after the first IMP administration.

Figure 1: Overall study scheme 
Study population /Sample size 
For the primary study three groups of patients stratified by age (2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 
to  <18  years)  were  enrolled.  Recruitment  of  the  youngest  age  group  began  only  after  results  of  the 
absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC)  and  safety  data  of  3  patients  from  the  middle  age  group,  who  had 
completed  the  treatment  phase  with  lipegfilgrastim,  had  been  reviewed  by  the  Data  Monitoring 
Committee  and  no  significant  safety  signals  for  lipegfilgrastim  that  could  prevent  recruitment  in  the 
youngest age stratum had been detected. 
Table 1: Composition of the study population 
Treatments 
In each of the treatment cycles of CTX, lipegfilgrastim or filgrastim were administered sc on day 1 of a 
cycle approximately 24 hours (+6 hours) after the end of the last CTX administration in week 1 of the 
specific  regimen.  The  corresponding  study  day  1  in  different  CTX  regimens  was  calculated  as  shown 
below: 
• 
• 
ifosfamide plus vincristine plus actinomycin D (IVA): CTX-day 2+1 
vincristine  plus  actinomycin  D  plus  cyclophosphamide  (VAC):  CTX-day  1+1,  CTX-day  2+1, 
CTX-day  3+1,  or  CTX-day  5+1  (depending  on  the  actinomycin  schedule  and  the  number  of 
days cyclophosphamide was given)

In  addition,  the  effects  of  treatment  on  mortality  due  to  infections  and  overall  mortality  until  end  of 
follow-up period were examined. First patient first visit was on 08 September 2015 and last patient last 
visit of the treatment period was 18 April 2018. A few of the patients are still in the follow-up phase of 
the study. 
Statistical Methods 
Documentation of statistical methods used in this study is provided in Statistical Analyses Plan in the 
submitted  data  for  the  original  P46  application.  The  sample  size  of  42  patients  (21  patients  per 
treatment  group)  has  been  chosen  primarily  on  practical  grounds  and  feasibility  (expected  low 
recruitment rate in the population under investigation).  
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set included all randomized patients. Treatment was assigned based 
on the treatment to which patients were randomized, regardless of which treatment they received. 
Safety  Analysis  Set included all randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of IMP. Treatment 
was  assigned  based  upon  the  treatment  patients  received,  regardless  of  the treatment  to  which  they 
were assigned. 
Per-Protocol  (PP)  Analysis  Set included all patients for whom no protocol violations were reported 
that may have impacted the efficacy of the IMP. For the purpose of the exclusion of a patient data from 
PP Analysis Set the following criteria were used: 
a. violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria 
b. intake of the prohibited concomitant medications 
c. received <75% of the intended study medication dose 
d. received non-randomized study medication 
e. violation of the GCP criteria resulting in the exclusion of the patient data from the study 
f. no treatment with randomized study medication in cycle 1 
g. insufficient ANC data for efficacy evaluation, specifically, at least 5 ANC assessments were required 
between day 2 to day 15 
The  above  criteria  only  applied  to  CTX  cycle  1  of  the  treatment  phase.  Of  note,  only  those  violations 
falling into categories “a” to “g” lead to exclusions if they influenced the interpretability of the efficacy 
study  results.  Determination  of  the  exclusions  from  the  PP  Analysis  Set  was  completed  and 
documented prior to the database lock. The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set included all patients from the 
safety  population  who  received  lipegfilgrastim  in  cycle  1  and  had  at  least  1  pharmacokinetic 
assessment available for evaluation. 
In  total,  15  patients  had  protocol  violations  during  the  follow-up  period.  The  most  common  protocol 
violations were related to study-specific requirements for SAE reporting. According to the Applicant the 
protocol violations did not impact the outcome of the study or the interpretation of study results.

Results (follow-up period) 
The current assessment relates to the Study XM22-08 follow-up period only. 
The results of the primary study were included in the final report dated 21st of March 2019 (Procedure 
no.: EMEA/H/C/002556/P46/017).  
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Altogether  40  patients  completed  Day  180  follow-up,  21  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  and  19  in  the 
filgrastim  group.  Out  of  these,  37  patients  completed  Day  365  follow-up,  20  in  the  lipegfilgrastim 
group  and  17  in  the  filgrastim  group.  Two  patients  died  during  the  follow-up  period,  both  in  the 
filgrastim  group.  One  patient  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  died  shortly  after  Day  365  follow-up 
completion. 
The  mean  duration  of  follow-up  was  269.1  days  (SD=9.85,  range:  247  to  288).  This  duration  was 
similar  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  mean  duration  of  follow-up  was  also  similar  across  all  age 
groups. The mean duration of study and follow-up was 369.7 days (SD=6.68, range: 353 to 384).

Deaths in the Follow-up Period 
Two  patients  died  during  the  follow-up  period,  both  in  the  filgrastim  group.  One  patient  in  the 
lipegfilgrastim  group  died  shortly  after  Day  365  follow-up  completion.  By  the  Applicant  all  3  deaths 
occurred due to disease progression.  
Table 4: Death by Treatment Group (ITT Population) 
Rapporteur’s comments: 
The  number  of  deaths  during  the  follow  up  period  were  related  to  the  disease  progression  and  no 
significant imbalance or trend in the number of events of disease progression or death was identified to 
be associated with the lipegfilgrastim treatment comparing to the filgrastim treatment.

Survival and Cancer Status in the Follow-up Period 
Kaplan  Meier  estimates  for  25%,  50%  and  75%  survival  time  were  non-estimable  due  to  the  low 
number of death cases. All the deaths were reported after Day 180 of the follow-up.

The  grade  of  rhabdomyosarcoma  was  3  or  4  in  all  evaluated  patients  (lipegfilgrastim  and  filgrastim 
group)  except  one  patient  in  filgrastim  group  (grade  2)  in  both  D180  and  D365  time  points.  No 
significant difference in cancer status by T-, N-, M-classification was seen between the D180 and D365 
time points were seen in either treatment groups. Neither the disease stage of rhabdomyosarcoma or 
Ewing Family of tumors patients changed between the follow up time points. Only difference in figures 
was  the  lower  number  of  missing  evaluations  at  the  D365  visit.  Furthermore,  the  groups  were 
comparable in stage and grade of the cancer. 
Rapporteur’s comments: 
The statistical evaluation of the survival was not possible due to the low number of events. Based on 
the  provided  descriptive  data  no  clear  difference  in  survival  during  the  follow  up  period  was  seen  in 
different age groups or treatments. 
No significant differences between treatments (lipegfilgratim vs. filgrastim) were seen in progression of 
cancer by the data from D180 and D365 follow up visits, in either treatment group. Furthermore, the 
groups  were  balanced  by  the  cancer  status.  However,  the  reliable  evaluation  of  the  impact  of  the 
treatment on cancer progression is impossible to perform based on the data due to the low number of 
subjects and other confounding factors (other treatments).

Weight and Height Values and Changes from Baseline in the Follow up Period 
The  mean  increase  in  weight  from  baseline  to  end  of  follow-up  was  3.17  kg  (SD=5.64)  in  the 
lipegfilgrastim group and 3.22 kg (SD=3.66) in the filgrastim group. 
The  mean  increase  in  height  from  baseline  to  end  of  follow-up  was  3.5  cm  (SD=2.7)  in  the 
lipegfilgrastim group and 4.1 cm (SD=2.6) in the filgrastim group. 
Rapporteur’s comments: 
No significant differences between the treatments (lipegfilgrastim vs. filgrastim) were seen in weight or 
height  development.  However,  the  reliable  evaluation  of  the  impact  of  treatment  on  development  is  
not  possible  to  perform    due  to  the  low  number  of  subjects  and  other  confounding  factors  (general 
condition and other treatments). 
Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor Therapy in the Follow-up Period 
The majority of patients (30 out of 40 who entered follow-up) received granulocyte-colony stimulating 
factor (G-CSF) therapy during the follow-up period (Table 6). 13 of 21 (62%) patients in the filgrastim 
group and 17 of 21 (81%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group. The frequency of G-CSF treatment by 
background chemotherapy was also similar between groups. 
Table  6:  G-CSF  Therapy  by  Therapeutic  Class,  Preferred  Term,  Treatment  Group  and  Age 
Group in Follow-up (Safety Population) 
Rapporteur’s comments: 
Larger  percentage  of  patients  received  G-CSF  therapy  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  comparing  to  the 
filgrastim group (81% vs. 62%). The relatively higher frequency of G-CSF treatment in the follow up 
period  in  lipegfilgrastim  group  did  not  have  an  impact  on  efficacy  and  safety  of  between  groups. 
However, any firm conclusions cannot be made based on the data due to the low number of patients 
and confounding factors.  
Safety results 
Serious Adverse Events in the Follow-up Period 
A  total  of  18  patients  had  at  least  1  SAE  during  the  follow-up  period  (Table  7).  SAEs  were  most 
commonly  Grade  4  in  severity,  11/21  and  4/21  in  lipegfilgrastim  and  filgrastim  groups,  respectively. 
The  corresponding  frequencies  of  Grade  3  SAEs  were  2/21  and  1/21.  Additionally  in  filgrastim  group 
one Grade 1 SAE was seen. 3 Grade 5 SAEs (deaths) were seen, 1 in lipegfilgrastim and 2 in filgrastim 
groups.  The  most  common  SAEs  belonged  to  the  SOC  of  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders,  in 
particular thrombocytopenia (7 patients, 5 in lipegfilgrastim and 2 in filgrastim group), lymphopenia (6 
patients altogether), and  neutropenia (2 patients altogether). Other SAEs that occurred in more than

one  patient  were  lymphocyte  count  decreased  and  platelet  count  decreased  (3  patients  altogether 
each).  The  SAE  profile  was  similar  across  all  age  groups  with  4  (57%),  7  (88%)  and  2  (33%)  of 
patients having at least one SAE in three respective age groups (2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, 12 to 
<18  years)  in  patients  receiving  lipegfilgrastim  (100  μg/kg).  The  corresponding  numbers  in  patients 
receiving filgrastim (5 μg/kg) were 2 (29%) 1 (17%) 2 (25%), respectively.  
Three patients had SAEs (one of these patients died shortly after Day 365 follow-up completion) after 
database lock for the Study XM22-08 CSR (04 June 2018).  
The first of these patients had Ewing family of tumors  experienced a total of 3 serious adverse events, 
2 events of lymphopenia and an event of peripheral primitive neuroectodermal bone tumour, which led 
to  death.  In  the  opinion  of  the  investigator  and  the  sponsor,  the  serious  adverse  events  of 
lymphopenia  were  not  related  to  lipegfilgrastim  but  related  to  the  concomitant  chemotherapy 
medication  (vincristine,  doxorubicin,  cyclophosphamide,  ifosfamide,  etoposide,  plus  sodium  2-
mercaptoethane sulfonate [MESNA]). 
The  second  patient  had  rhabdomyosarcoma.  The  patient  experienced  a  total  of  14  serious  adverse 
events,  including  13  events  of  lymphocyte  count  decreased  and  1  event  of  platelet  count  decreased. 
The event resolved with sequelae on Study Day 205. The patient completed the 365-day follow-up visit 
on. In the opinion of the investigator and the sponsor, the serious adverse events of lymphocyte count 
decreased  and  platelet  count  decreased  were  not  related  to  filgrastim  but  related  to  the  concomitant 
chemotherapy  medication  (ifosfamide,  vincristine,  Actinomycin  D,  doxorubicin  plus  sodium  2-
mercaptoethane sulfonate [MESNA], etoposide, idarubicin, and trofosfamide). 
The  third  patient  had      rhabdomyosarcoma  .  The  patient  experienced  a  serious  adverse  event  of 
rhabdomyosarcoma. The outcome of the event was not resolved. The patient was lost to follow-up and 
she  did  not  complete the  365-day  follow-up  visit.  In  the  opinion  of  the  investigator  and  the  sponsor, 
the serious adverse event of rhabdomyosarcoma was not related to lipegfilgrastim.

Table  7:  Serious  Adverse  Events  by  System  Organ  Class,  Preferred  Term,  and  Treatment 
Group in Follow-up (Safety Population) 
Rapporteur’s comments: 
Higher  number  of  patients  with  at  least  one  SAEs  was  seen  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  compared  to 
the filgrastim group (62% vs 24%). The frequency of patients experiencing SAE was on the same level 
in  lipegfilgrastim  group  (~60%  in  both  treatment  groups)  as  in  short  term  in  the  primary  study.  The 
respective percentage of patients in filgrastim groups was, however, significantly lower in the follow up 
period 24% vs. 60%). Regarding the single adverse reactions, the difference in the frequency of blood 
and lymphatic system disorders was higher in lipegfilgrastim group (43% vs. 14%). The similar trend 
of  higher  number  of  events  of  thrombocytopenia  and  leucopenia  in  lipegfilgrastim  group  was  already 
seen  short  term  during  the  primary  study,  but  these  events  were  considered  not  to  be  treatment 
related in lipegfilgrastim group. There were also relatively high difference in SAEs by age groups and 
their  concomitant  treatments.  Age-dependent  difference  in  SAEs  is  though  again  difficult  to  evaluate 
due to the small number of patients per age group.

Immunogenicity 
a)  Anti-Drug Antibody Analysis 
A total of 98 samples from 21 patients in the lipegfilgrastim group were collected during this study. For 
1  patient,  samples  were  available  until  the  end  of  study  (EOS)/early  termination  (ET)  visit;  for  1 
patient until Day 180, and for 19 patients until Day 365. 
A total of 7 samples from 4 patients were confirmed positive for the presence of ADA. Three of these 
patients had positive samples at baseline and were considered to have pre-existing ADA not related to 
the treatment with lipegfilgrastim. One patient was negative at baseline, had an ADA response at Cycle 
2 CTX Day 1 and at the EOS/ET visit; however, the Day 180 and Day 365 samples were negative. One 
patient  with  a  confirmed positive  sample  at  baseline  also  had  a  confirmed  positive  sample  at  Cycle 2 
cytotoxic chemotherapy (CTX) Day 1 and at EOS/ET visit with a low concentration of antibodies (titer 
<1) (Table 9). The Day 365 sample was negative for the detection of ADA (Table 9). 
Table  8:  Patients  with  At  Least  One  Confirmed  Positive  Anti-Drug  Antibody  Result 
(Lipegfilgrastim patients, ITT Population) 
b)  Sample Analysis for Characterization and Neutralizing Antibodies 
Characterization and titer assays were performed on the 7 samples (Table 9) confirmed for 
ADA presence (Table 8).  
•  3 samples from patient  had specific binding to XM21 and/or G-CSF 
•  3 samples from 3 different patients had exclusive specific binding to cPEG 
•  1 sample (EOS/ET) from Patient did not present specific binding to cPEG 
• 
Titers of the 7 samples confirmed positive for ADAs were low, and ranged between 0.0 and 
0.8. 
Two samples were positive for neutralization of XM22 activity. Since both samples with neutralizing 
activity were from baseline time points, detected NAbs were not considered to be treatment related.

Table 9: Anti-Drug Antibody Characterization Assay Results for Samples with ADA Presence 
Rapporteur’s comments: 
The frequency of patients developing ADAs was low in lipegfilgrastim group during the follow up period 
with  four  positive  patients  altogether,  but  only  one  patient  who  had  no  ADAs  towards  G-CSF  at 
baseline.  Two  patients  ADA  positive  at  the  end  of  the  study  turned  negative  during  the  follow  up 
period. All these patients were ADA negative at FU/D365 time point. In the neutralization assay three 
patients had positive binding against PEG moiety, but only one of these was shown to be neutralizing. 
One  patient  had  ADA  positivity  against  G-CSF  showing  neutralizing  capacity  at  baseline,  but  turned 
negative  at  the  end  of  the  study.  Altogether,  two  patients  showed  neutralizing  antibodies,  but  since 
they were observed already at the baseline they were not related to the current treatment. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
MAH’s position on benefits and risks 
Study  XM22-08  was  the  second  paediatric  study  in  the  Company’s  lipegfilgrastim  paediatric 
development  programme.  Both  studies  were  performed  in  paediatric  patients  2  to  <18  years  of  age 
with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma receiving CTX. 
The  first  study  (XM22-07)  was  an  open-label,  non-controlled  study  performed  to  assess  the  PK, 
pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single, sc dose of 100 μg/kg 
BW lipegfilgrastim in 21 children.  
The  second  study  XM22-08  was  an  open-label,  active-controlled  study  performed  to  assess  the 
efficacy, PK, pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of lipegfilgrastim 100 μg/kg 
BW in comparison to daily filgrastim 5 μg/kg BW in 42 children. 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a single sc dose of 100 μg/kg BW of 
lipegfilgrastim  per  cycle  compared  to  daily  sc  doses  of  5  μg/kg  BW  of  filgrastim  in  children  receiving

CTX.  Note  that  no  formal  hypothesis  testing  was  performed  as  the  study  was  not  powered  for  it; 
conclusions were limited to providing estimates of the means of treatments and their differences. 
The difference in the DSN in Cycle 1 between the 2 treatment groups was not meaningful. The mean 
(SD)  DSN  in  Cycle  1  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  was  2.7  (2.25)  days  and  in  the  filgrastim  group  2.5 
(2.09) days (PP Analysis Set). A Poisson regression analysis with factors of treatment and age cohort, 
and  baseline  (before  IMP  administration)  ANC  value  as  covariate  was  fitted.  The  least  squares  mean 
difference  (lipegfilgrastim  minus  filgrastim)  was  1.0  (95%  CI:  –0.21,  2.26;  P  =  0.102)  in  the  PP 
Analysis Set and 0.4 (95% CI: –0.92, 1.72; P = 0.543) in the ITT Analysis Set. In addition, there were 
no  notable  differences  in  the  DSN  in  Cycle  1  between  the  corresponding  age  cohorts  across  the 
treatment groups. These results were consistent with the results obtained in Study XM22-07. In Study 
XM22-07, the mean (SD) DSN was 0.7 (1.2) days in the 2 to <6 years age cohort, 2.4 (1.9) days in 
the 6 to <12 years age cohort, and 3.1 (1.9) days in the 12 to <18 years age cohort. In the current 
Study XM22-08, the mean (SD) DSN in the lipegfilgrastim group (PP Analysis Set) was 2.0 (1.55) days 
in the 2 to <6 years age cohort, 2.8 (2.31) days in the 6 to <12 years age cohort, and 3.3 (2.88) days 
in the 12 to <18 years age cohort. Similar results for DSN were seen in the filgrastim group. 
In addition, in both treatment groups, the mean DSN in patients who received doxorubicin-based CTX 
VDC/IE  and  VIDE  in  Cycle  1  was  longer  compared  to  the  patients  who  received  other  CTX  regimens 
(IVA  or  VAC).  Of  the  2  most  frequent  CTX  regimens  administered  in  the  study  (IVA  and  VIDE),  the 
mean  (SD)  DSN  was  shorter  for  patients  who  received  IVA  compared  to  VIDE  (lipegfilgrastim:  0.4 
[0.53] days vs 4.1 [1.54] days; filgrastim: 0.4 [0.79] days vs 3.9 [1.13] days; PP Analysis Set). This 
could  be  attributed  to  the  higher  myelotoxicity  expected  with  doxorubicin-based  CTX  regimens, 
particularly  for  the  older  paediatric  patients  (6  to  <12  years  and  12  to  <18  years)  who  received  a 
higher proportion of the VIDE CTX regimen as compared to other CTX regimens. In summary, as the 
type  of  CTX  regimen  administered  was  different  across  the  age  cohorts,  no  clear  conclusion  can  be 
drawn regarding a relationship between DSN and the age of the patients. 
The  results  of  the  secondary  endpoints  of  the  study  were  supportive of  the  primary  endpoint  results. 
There were no meaningful differences between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups with 
respect  to  the  incidence  of  severe  neutropenia  (85%  vs  84%),  febrile  neutropenia  (35%  vs  42%), 
hospitalization due to febrile neutropenia (5% in each treatment group), DSN in Cycles 2 to 4 (~2 days 
in  both  groups),  and  DVSN  (~1  day  in  both  groups).  Also  no  relevant  differences  between  the 
corresponding age cohorts were found. 
As in Study XM22-07, a trend of higher incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients who received VIDE 
CTX compared to other CTX regimens was observed also in this study. 
This  is  in  line  with  published  data  in  paediatric  patients  with  Ewing  sarcoma,  in  which  patients 
developed  febrile  neutropenia  after  78%  of  VIDE  cycles  with  pegfilgrastim  administration  and  after 
56% VIDE cycles with filgrastim. After less myelosuppressive IVA and VAC CTX, the incidence of febrile 
neutropenia  was  0%  with  pegfilgrastim  and  5%  with  filgrastim  administration  (Wendelin  et  al  2005). 
André  et  al.  reported  febrile  neutropenia  in  47%  of  pegfilgrastim-treated  paediatric  cancer  patients 
after VIDE, 4% after VAC, and 33% (2 of 6 cases) after IVA (André et al 2007). 
However, when the results of Study XM22-08 were stratified by CTX regimen in Cycle 1, there were no 
differences  in  the  overall  likelihood  of  experiencing  febrile  neutropenia  between  any  of  the 
corresponding age cohorts of the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups. Similarly, there was 
no  difference  in  the  overall  likelihood  of  experiencing  febrile  neutropenia  irrespective  of  concomitant 
prophylactic systemic antibiotics use between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups. 
The pharmacodynamic results in this study provided additional evidence supporting similar efficacy of 
lipegfilgrastim  as  compared  to  filgrastim.  The  geometric  mean  AUCANC  until  day  15  in  the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

lipegfilgrastim group was higher compared to the filgrastim group (104.9473 × 109/L*days vs 84.2795 
× 109/L*days; PP Analysis Set). When the results were stratified by age cohorts and the CTX regimen 
administered  in  Cycle  1,  there  were  no  meaningful  differences  in  the  mean  AUCANC  values  between 
the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups and between the corresponding age strata/cohorts. 
Also,  there  were  no  meaningful  differences  between  the  2  treatment  groups  in  the  mean  AUCANC 
values in Cycle 1, mean ANC  nadir values in Cycles  1 to 4, mean time to ANC nadir in  Cycles 1 to 4 
from start of  CTX or  IMP  administration, and mean  times to ANC recovery thresholds of ANC  >1.0 × 
109/L and ANC >2.0 × 109/L in Cycles 1 to 4. 
The  study  treatment  duration  was  similar  between  treatment  groups  (mean:  100.8  days  in  the 
lipegfilgrastim group and 95.0 days in the filgrastim group). Overall, lipegfilgrastim was administered 4 
times  (mean  value;  once  per  cycle  for  4  cycles),  and  filgrastim  was  administered  31.7  times  (mean 
value)  over  4  cycles.  Lipegfilgrastim  could  be  advantageous  over  filgrastim  owing  to  its  lesser 
frequency  of  administration  (once  per  cycle)  and  increased  compliance  compared  to  daily 
administration of filgrastim. 
No  concerns  about  the  safety  of  lipegfilgrastim  were  raised  by  the  TEAEs  reported  in  the  study.  All 
enrolled patients experienced at least 1 TEAE during the treatment period of the study. There were no 
notable differences in the incidences of various categories of TEAEs between the 2 treatment groups. 
The numerical differences in the reporting of PTs between the groups were considered due to chance. 
The most common (≥30% patients in both the treatment groups) system organ classes included blood 
and  lymphatic  system  disorders,  gastrointestinal  disorders,  general  disorders  and  administration  site 
conditions,  investigations,  and  infections  and  infestations.  Anaemia,  common  in  cancer  patients 
undergoing CTX, was reported for approximately 80% of patients in each treatment group. The other 
most common (≥50% patients) PTs were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and vomiting. 
Treatment-related  TEAEs  were  rare  and  reported  in  19%  of  patients  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  and 
10% of patients in the filgrastim group, and were mild or moderate in severity (Grade 1 or 2). 
Any Grade 3 TEAEs were reported in 76% of patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 62% of patients 
in  the  filgrastim  group.  The  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3  TEAE  at  PT  level  was  anemia  (52%  of 
patients  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  and  38%  of  patients  in  the  filgrastim  group).  All  other  Grade  3 
TEAEs were reported in 0 to 5 (24%) patients per treatment group. Any Grade 4 TEAEs were reported 
in  76%  of  patients  in  each  of  the  treatment  groups.  The  most  frequently  reported  Grade  4  TEAEs  (≥
30% of patients in any group) were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and leukopenia. All 
other Grade 4 TEAEs were reported in 0 to 4 (19%) patients per treatment group. Approximately 60% 
of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  experienced  SAEs  during  the  treatment  period  of  the  study. 
Among  all  SAEs,  only  1  SAE  was  considered  treatment-related  and  occurred  in  the  filgrastim  group 
(Grade 1 pyrexia). Adverse events leading to study discontinuation were uncommon and reported only 
for 2 patients, both in the filgrastim group and in the age cohort of 12 to <18 years. The events were 
leukopenia and neutropenia in 1 patient and drug-induced liver injury in the other patient. The events 
were considered related to CTX but not to filgrastim treatment by the investigator. 
There were no unexpected clinically meaningful trends observed in the mean changes from baseline for 
any  of  the  serum  chemistry  or  hematology  parameters  during  the  study.  The  assessment  of  the 
ventricular  repolarization  risk  based  on  the  change  from  baseline  QT  interval  corrected  by  Fridericia 
correction  formula  did  not  indicate  that  a  single  dose  of  lipegfilgrastim  of  100  μg/kg  per  cycle  holds 
any  QTc  liability.  Evaluation  of  other  ECG  time  intervals  demonstrated  the  absence  of  potential 
meaningful drug-induced change in heart rate, prolongation of PR or QRS duration, as well as clinically 
relevant abnormalities following lipegfilgrastim administration.

The  mean  duration  of  follow-up  was  269.1  days  (SD=9.85,  range:  247  to  288).  This  duration  was 
similar in both treatment groups and across all age groups. The mean duration of study and follow-up 
was 369.7 days (SD=6.68, range: 353 to 384). 
In  all,  18  out  of  40  patients  had  SAEs  during  follow-up.  The  most  common  SAEs  were 
thrombocytopenia  (7  patients),  lymphopenia  (6  patients),  and  neutropenia  (2  patients).  Other  SAEs 
that occurred in more than one patient were lymphocyte count decreased and platelet count decreased 
(3 patients each). This SAE profile was similar across all age groups. 
Two  patients  died  during  the  follow-up  period,  both  in  the  filgrastim  group.  One  patient  in  the 
lipegfilgrastim  group  died  shortly  after  day  365  follow-up  completion.  All  3  deaths  occurred  due  to 
disease progression. 
Seven  samples  from  4  patients  had  positive  results  for  the presence  of  ADA.  Three  of  these  patients 
had  positive  samples  already  at  baseline  and,  for  this  reason,  were  considered  to  have  pre-existing 
ADA not lipegfilgrastim treatment–related. 
The  safety  results  in  this  study  were  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  lipegfilgrastim  and 
were  similar  to  the  safety  profile  of  filgrastim  indicating  its  safe  use  in  children  with  Ewing  family  of 
tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma receiving CTX. 
MAH’s position on limitations of the XM22-08 Study Design 
The XM22-08 study was designed as the second of 2 paediatric studies required as measures of a PIP, 
with  the  primary  objective  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  a  single  dose  of  lipegfilgrastim  100  μg/kg  BW  in 
comparison  to  approved  standard  treatment  with  filgrastim  in  the  paediatric  population.  As  such,  an 
open-label, active-controlled study was considered appropriate to support the primary objective of this 
study. 
The  sample  size  of  42  patients  (21  patients  per  treatment  group)  was  selected  based  on  practicality 
and feasibility (expected low recruitment rate in the population under investigation). A sample size of 
21 patients per treatment group was expected to allow the estimation of mean DSN in Cycle 1. 
Study  XM22-08  investigated  4  cycles  of  lipegfilgrastim  treatment,  which  reflects  a  typical  clinical 
setting.  To  facilitate  recruitment  of  cancer  patients  from  the  age  of  2  to  <18  years,  5  different  CTX 
regimens were permissible in Study XM22-08. As the myelosuppressive effect of CTX varies across CTX 
regimen, the comparison of results across age groups can be complicated when the CTX regimens are 
not  equally  distributed  by  age  group.  This  was  indeed  the  case  in  the  XM22-08  study,  but  was 
addressed by appropriate analysis of the study data by type of CTX in addition to age group. 
MAH’s overall benefit-risk assessment of lipegfilgrastim in paediatric patients 
Studies  XM22-07  and  XM22-08  investigated  21  and  42  paediatric  patients,  respectively,  with  Ewing 
family of tumors or rhabdomyosarcoma who received a single sc injection of lipegfilgrastim 100 μg/kg 
BW per CTX cycle. 
In  Study  XM22-08  it  was  shown  that  there  were  no  notable  differences  in  the  DSN  in  Cycle  1  across 
the treatment groups and between the corresponding age cohorts, and the results raised no concerns 
regarding the PK, safety, or immunogenicity profile of lipegfilgrastim. 
In the PK Study XM22-07, maximum mean serum lipegfilgrastim concentration (Cmax) was reached at 
(tmax) 50.3 hours (292 ±178 ng/mL) in the 2 to <6 years group, 45.4 hours (303 ±144 ng/mL) in the 
6  to  <12  years  group,  and  82.2  hours  (341  ±381  ng/mL)  in  the  12  to  <18  years  group.  Analysis  of 
covariance revealed no detectable difference in PK parameters of interest (Cmax, area under the serum 
concentration-time  curve,  apparent  volume  of  distribution  during  the  terminal  phase  after  non-

intravenous administration, and apparent clearance) among age groups. More importantly, the average 
Cmax values and Cmax variability were comparable across the age groups, supporting the use of a BW-
adjusted dose to achieve comparable initial peak exposure levels of lipegfilgrastim. 
Key efficacy endpoints in clinical studies with G-CSFs are the incidence of febrile neutropenia and the 
DSN.  Results  for  these  endpoints  in  the  non-controlled  Study  XM22-07  as  well  as  in  the  active-
controlled  Study  XM22-08  (comparing  lipegfilgrastim  with  filgrastim,  which  is  approved  for  use  in 
paediatric  cancer  patients)  are  consistent  with  those  previously  observed  with  pegfilgrastim  and 
filgrastim  and  appear  to  be  associated  with  the  type  of  CTX  administered  rather  than  the  age  of  the 
patients.  As  the type  of  CTX  administered differed  across  the  age groups,  no clear  conclusion  can  be 
drawn regarding a relationship between efficacy and the age of the patients. Similar trends were seen 
with  the  pharmacodynamic  results.  Safety  endpoints  in  these  trials  included  adverse  events,  clinical 
laboratory  results,  ECG  results,  spleen  sonography,  injection  site  reactions,  and  immunogenicity. 
Survival  in  the  follow-up  period  was  assessed  in  Study  XM22-07.  The  evaluations  indicated  a  safety 
profile consistent with that seen in adult trials with lipegfilgrastim. 
The  death  of  1  child  with  rhabdomyosarcoma  during  the  follow-up  period  in  Study  XM22-07  was 
attributed to disease progression and was  not regarded as lipegfilgrastim-related. In Study XM22-08, 
the  2  deaths  observed  in  the  filgrastim  group  during  the  follow-up  period  (1  patient  with 
rhabdomyosarcoma and 1 patient with Ewing sarcoma) and the 1 death observed in the lipegfilgrastim 
group shortly after day 365 follow-up completion, were also attributed to disease progression and not 
considered treatment-related. 
Regarding the immunogenicity in Study XM22-07, 1 patient developed a low titer ADA response in this 
study post-treatment with lipegfilgrastim and several doses of commercial filgrastim. The patient had a 
positive  sample  at  day  180  only.  This  sample  was  not  neutralizing  and  only  specific  for  the  cPEG-
moiety. Four other patients were considered to have pre-existing ADA towards lipegfilgrastim (specific 
for cPEG or both G-CSF and cPEG moieties), but there was no treatment-related ADA response. 
In  Study  XM22-08,  immunogenicity  data  were  obtained  only  for  patients  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group 
and  7  samples  from  4  patients  were  identified  with confirmed  presence of  ADAs,  including  3  patients 
with pre-existing ADAs (ie, positive baseline samples). A single patient was baseline negative and had 
ADA positive samples at Cycle 2 CTX-day 1 and at the EOS/ET visit, but negative samples on day 180 
and day 365.The 2 positive samples, at Cycle 2 CTX-day 1 and at  EOS/ET, had a low titer (<1). The 
Cycle  2  sample  for  this  patient  had  a  titer  of  0.5  for  anticPEG  but  no  anti-G-CSF  specific  antibodies 
were  detected.  In  the  EOS/ET  sample,  no  ADA  titer  could  be  measured  (0.0)  due  to  very  low  ADA 
concentration.  The  Cycle  2  sample  was  non-neutralizing  and  the  EOS/ET  sample  result  was  not 
available. 
In  conclusion  for  these  2  studies,  no  patient  developed  a  persistent  ADA  response,  and  all  positive 
samples had low titers and were not neutralizing. 
Overall,  the  safety,  PK,  efficacy,  and  pharmacodynamic  data  reviewed  in  these  2  trials  support  a 
continued positive benefit-risk assessment for lipegfilgrastim in the paediatric population. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The final report for the assessment of the paediatric study for Lonquex (lipegfilgrastim) XM22-08 was 
provided  on  the  21st  of  March,  2019.  The  current  assessment  relates  to  the  addendum  of  this  study, 
data    from  the  follow  up  period  of  the    study  collected  on  Day  180  (±2  weeks)  and  Day  365  (±2 
weeks); and includes data on survival, cancer status, growth (height and weight), concomitant G-CSF, 
serious adverse events (SAEs), and immunogenicity.

In  general,  the  data  provided  has  inherent  limitations  as  it  was  not  powered  for  proper  statistical 
evaluation of the data. Also, the number of patients in different age subcategories was too low to make 
any firm conclusions. 
Altogether  3  patients  of  42  patients  continuing  the  study  died  during  the  follow  up  period  with  1 
patient from the lipegfilgrastim group. No trends on increased progression of the underlying disease or 
mortality was seen associated with lipegfilgrastim in comparison to filgrastim group. Nevertheless, the 
evaluation  of  the  impact  of  the  treatment  on  mortality  or  disease  progression  is  limited  due  to  low 
number  of  study  subjects  and  confounding  factors.  Based  on  the  data  provided  no  clear  difference 
between lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim was seen in survival or cancer progression. 
The percentage of patients with SAE’s was higher in lipegfilgrastim group to filgrastim group (62% vs. 
24%)  relating  mainly  to  differences  in  haematological  changes  (thrombocytopenia  and  leukopenia), 
which  though  might  also  be  caused  by  the  underlying  disease.  However,  the  percentage  of  patients 
experiencing  SAE’s  in  lipegfilgrastim  group  did  not  differ  from  the  data  obtained  from  the  primary 
study  period  demonstrating  the  same  trend  of  increased  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  in 
lipegfilgrastim. These events were not though considered to be treatment-related. 
Immunogenicity  analysis  did  not  indicate  any  significant  importance  for  the  efficacy  or  safety  of  the 
lipegfilgrastim since any neutralizing antibodies not already present at the baseline were observed. The 
development  of  ADA’s  was  altogether  low  with  only  4  patients  affected  of  whom  3  were  positive 
already at baseline indicating no relationship of these events with the Lonquex. 
Overall,  the  current  data  provided  did  not  reveal  any  additional  issues  not  already  brought  up  in  the 
previous assessment of the article 46 commitment (Procedure No: EMEA/H/C/002556/P46/017). Thus, 
the recommendations presented in the final report regarding the update of the product information are 
valid and should be followed, and the MAH has agreed to submit a paediatric extension of the current 
MA of Lonquex once the totality of paediatric data is available (planned for 07/2020), so the totality of 
the paediatric data can be assessed for a paediatric indication and a suitable paediatric formulation and 
paediatric dosage form. 
  Fulfilled: 
In  view  of  the  available  data  regarding  Lonquex,  the  MAH  should  submit  an  extension  of  the  current 
MA of Lonquex in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. This should be 
provided as planned by the Company once the totality of paediatric data is available , so the totality of 
the paediatric data can be assessed for a paediatric indication and a suitable paediatric formulation and 
paediatric dosage form.

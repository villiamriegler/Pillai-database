2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication for the granule formulation is treatment of Clostridium difficile infections 
(CDI), also known as C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD), in paediatric patients from birth to < 18 
years of age.  
In addition, the existing indication for the film-coated tablet formulation is proposed to be modified, to 
include paediatric patients with a body weight of at least 12.5 kg. 
Clostridium difficile has recently been re-classified and the organism officially renamed as Clostridioides 
difficile, which should be used in the indication. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
CDAD is one of the leading courses of nosocomial infections, accounting for approximately 15-35% of 
cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and 95% of cases of antibiotic-associated 
pseudomembraneous colitis. A potential cost of CDI per year in the EU of €3 billion has been 
estimated, assuming an EU population of 457 million. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
C. difficile is a spore-forming, anaerobic, gram-positive rod that produces toxins that cause 
inflammation of the colon with severe diarrhoea and, in the most serious cases, pseudomembranous 
colitis, toxic megacolon, perforations of the colon, sepsis and even death. 
CDAD is caused by an overgrowth of C. difficile in the colon and is the leading cause of infectious 
nosocomial diarrhoea in industrialized countries.  The disease accounts for approximately 20% of cases 
of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, and for the majority of cases of antibiotic-associated 
pseudomembranous colitis (Blanckaert et al, 2008; Calfee, 2008; Monaghan et al, 2008; Mylonakis et 
al, 2001).  Antibiotics commonly linked to CDAD include cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, 
ampicillin, and amoxicillin, but almost any antibiotic can cause CDAD.  In addition to antibiotics, a 
number of other risk factors have been identified for CDAD in the paediatric population, including solid 
organ transplant, gastrostomy tube placement, chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease/motility 
disorders, cystic fibrosis, immunosuppression and previous C. difficile infection (Cooperstock, 2013; 
Sandora et al, 2011). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
CDAD has historically been considered a disease of adults and not a clinical problem in the paediatric 
population. The disease has been recognized to be increasing in children and younger adults with a 
growing proportion of these cases exhibiting the onset of symptoms in the community. 
It is unclear whether typical CDAD occurs in children <24 months of age. Infants and young children 
may harbour and tolerate the presence of C. difficile whilst remaining clinically asymptomatic, and may 
not develop CDAD (Sammons et al, 2013; Khalaf et al, 2012; Jangi & Lamont, 2010; Cerquetti et al, 
1995). In neonates the occurrence of positive cultures varies widely, from 4% in Sweden, 11% in 
France, 25% in the Netherlands, 31% in the United States, 67% in Belgium and 71% in the United 
Kingdom, with no direct correlation to the presence of diarrhoea (Penders et al, 2006; Enad et al, 
1997; Collignon et al, 1993; Delmee et al, 1988; Al-Jumaili et al, 1984; Holst et al, 1981). 
As a possible scientific rationale for the differences in colonization and incidence of CDAD seen in 
young children compared with adults, it has been suggested that neonates and infants do not respond 
to clostridial toxins in the same way as adults do (Tullus et al, 1989). Though the mechanism for this 
difference is unclear, hypotheses include the inability of immature receptors to bind or respond to the 
toxins, transference of protective maternal antibodies and the inability of the infant’s immune system 
to mount an effective immune response. 
In older children, CDAD is associated with variable diarrheal symptoms.  Studies to determine the 
culture rates of C. difficile in faeces in paediatric patients with and without diarrhoea have detected C. 
difficile in up to 27.3% of hospitalized children (Kader et al, 1998), but no apparent association 
between a positive culture and clinical diagnosis has been established. 
Diagnosis of CDAD requires both, clinical signs and symptoms and the detection of C. difficile toxin A 
and/or B in faeces. The definitive diagnosis of CDAD in paediatric patients, in particular young children 
and infants who are more likely to carry the organism with symptoms, may be complicated by 
physiological differences in normal stool habit and a high frequency of diarrheal illnesses caused by 
other pathogens, e.g. rotavirus, which can be incorrectly attributed to C. difficile infection. Nor can 
CDAD diagnosis in the paediatric population be confirmed as correct on the basis of response to 
treatment, as illness caused by many of these other pathogens will often spontaneously resolve within 
the same timeframe as the treatment course for CDAD. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Mild cases of CDI may recover after stopping the causative antibiotic therapy, although this approach 
is often not sufficient for more severe cases.  
Oral vancomycin and metronidazole are both approved for the treatment of CDAD in adult and 
paediatric patients in the EU by oral administration. Both are available in liquid formulations. Orally 
administered metronidazole is almost completely absorbed, and systemic exposure is associated with 
adverse effects. Meanwhile, there is growing concern over emerging resistance to vancomycin among 
other important target pathogens, such as MRSA, with increasing clinical use. The current 
recommendations for CDAD treatment, endorsed by the recent guidelines of the European Society of 
Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of 
America and the Infectious Disease Society of America (SHEA-IDSA) state that vancomycin, but not 
metronidazole, should be used to treat severe cases of CDAD. 
C. difficile can persist as spores in the stools leading to frequent recurrences after successful initial 
treatment in 20-50% of patients. 
 
 
 
Fidaxomicin 200 mg tablet PO BD was authorised in the EU for the treatment of CDAD in adults in 
2011 (EMEA/H/C/002087). The 200-mg tablet formulation demonstrated non-inferiority to vancomycin 
in clinical response and superiority in recurrence and sustained clinical response and a similar safety 
profile to vancomycin in adult Phase 3 studies. 
About the product 
•  A07AA12 Antidiarrheals, intestinal antiinflammatory/antiinfective agents, antibiotics. 
Fidaxomicin is a macrocyclic (macrolide) antibacterial with narrow-spectrum bactericidal activity 
against Clostridioides difficile. Fidaxomicin is bactericidal and acts via inhibition of RNA synthesis 
by bacterial RNA polymerase at a distinct site from that of other RNA polymerase inhibitors. After 
oral administration, it is poorly absorbed systemically and therefore exerts its activity in the 
gastrointestinal tract, which is an advantage in the treatment of CDAD. 
This submission provides data supporting extension of the approved indication to the paediatric 
population <18 years of age, and extension of the MAA to add a new age-appropriate 
pharmaceutical form and strength (granules for oral suspension, 40 mg/ml) for use in paediatric 
patients. The tablet formulation can also be administered to adolescents and older children able to 
tolerate tablets. 
• 
Proposed indication: 
DIFICLIR granules for oral suspension is indicated for the treatment of Clostridium difficile 
infections (CDI) also known as C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) in paediatric patients from 
birth to < 18 years of age. 
• 
Proposed posology: Paediatric population 
For appropriate dosing in the paediatric population, DIFICLIR granules for oral suspension or 
DIFICLIR film-coated tablets may be used. 
The recommended dose in paediatric patients weighing at least 12.5 kg is 200 mg (one tablet or 5 
ml oral suspension) administered twice daily (once every 12 hours) for 10 days.  
The recommended dose of the oral suspension in paediatric patients, by body weight, to be 
administered twice daily (once every 12 hours) for 10 days, is presented in the table below.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as granules for oral suspension containing 40 mg/ml of fidaxomicin 
as active substance.  
Other ingredients are as follows: cellulose, microcrystalline, sodium starch glycollate, xanthan gum, 
citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium benzoate (E211), sucralose, and mixed berry flavour 
The product is available in an amber glass bottle with a polypropylene child-resistant cap in an 
aluminium pouch as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Fidaxomicin is a fermentation product produced by the organism Dactylosporangium aurantiacum, 
along with other related substances. The major chemical component is an unsaturated 18-membered 
macrocycle.  
The active substance fidaxomicin has already been assessed in connection with the marketing 
authorization of Dificlir 200 mg tablets in the centralised procedure (EU/1/11/733/003). The active 
substance information provided in this application is identical to that approved for Dificlir 200 mg 
tablets.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
The finished product is formulated as white to yellowish white granules and is supplied in a 150 mL 
amber glass bottle with a polypropylene child resistant cap. Each bottle is filled with 7.7 g of the 
granule formulation that contains 4.4 g of the active ingredient. 
The content of the bottle will be reconstituted with 105 mL of water for injection to obtain an oral 
suspension of 200 mg/5 mL fidaxomicin. The total volume of suspension in the bottle after 
reconstitution with water for injection is 110 mL. This provides a sufficient volume of the suspension 
for the period of 10 days of dosing at 200 mg fidaxomicin twice a day with one-day additional dosing.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The finished product is developed as a granule formulation.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards except mixed berry flavour which complies with an in-house specification. There are no 
novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Regarding the finished product, the critical quality attributes (CQAs) were established based on the 
target product profile. A criterion was set for each CQA as a basis for evaluation for the impact of the 
attributes of each formulation component on the pharmaceutical properties of the fidaxomicin 
granules.  
A risk assessment was carried out using failure mode effects analysis (FMEA), applying subject matter 
expertise and prior knowledge to identify potential failure modes for each component in the proposed 
formulation. In the FMEA, the risks of each component quantity on product CQAs were analysed and 
evaluated.  
This product is an immediate release oral suspension dosage form and a dissolution test method has 
been developed. As the product is an oral suspension formulation, the basket method (apparatus 1) is 
not applicable. Therefore, paddle method (apparatus 2), which is commonly used for evaluating 
dissolution of oral dosage forms, is selected. The dissolution profile is achieved a complete dissolution. 
Based on the results, the selected paddle method (apparatus 2) is considered suitable for the 
dissolution test of fidaxomicin oral suspension. The method has been confirmed to have a sufficient 
discriminatory power regarding different granulation conditions of the finished product. In conclusion, 
the developed method is deemed suitable for quality control for fidaxomicin oral suspension.  
The finished product is manufactured using the unit operations of sizing, granulation, wet sizing, 
drying, dry sizing and blending.  The manufacturing process for the finished is developed to ensure 
that granules meet the quality specifications and consequently can be manufactured reproducibly and 
consistently. 
A risk analysis based on manufacturing experience was performed using Failure Mode and Effect 
Analysis (FMEA) to systematically identify processing parameters and their interrelations that could 
potentially impact with CQAs. 
Extensive manufacturing process development studies have indicated that process parameters may 
impact the CQAs based on risk assessment.  It was confirmed that CQAs can be within product 
specification. 
The  primary  packaging  is  amber  glass  bottle  with  a  polypropylene  child-resistant  cap.  The  material 
complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
The feasibility of administering through an enteral feeding tube was investigated according to the 
Quality of medicines questions and answers: Part 2 presented by the European Medicines Agency. This 
study addressed ease of administration, tube blocking, dose recovery, flush volumes and 
physicochemical compatibility. The study showed positive results by using 4-8 Fr tubes with flush 
volumes of 1-4 mL purified water. This study was performed using tubes made of PVC (DEHP free) or 
PUR and each material showed sufficient physicochemical compatibility. It was concluded that 
administration of the oral suspension through an enteral feeding tube is feasible 
 
 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 7 main steps: sizing, granulation, wet sizing, drying, dry sizing, 
blending, and bottle filling. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
A process validation scheme has been provided and considered satisfactory. All the relevant 
manufacturing steps will be validated before commercial launch. The in-process controls are adequate 
for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product will be delivered in a bottle with the granules, which will be suspended before use 
with purified water to an oral suspension.  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form:  Granules:  appearance  (visual),  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  related  substances  (HPLC),  microbial 
limit  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  of  fidaxomicin  (HPLC).  Suspension:  appearance  (visual),  resuspension  time 
(visual), pH (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), assay of sodium benzoate (HPLC), and uniformity of dosage 
units. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. As the result of the risk 
assessment, additional controls are not required for elemental impurities for this finished product. In 
addition, total mass of elemental impurities calculated from typical value of active substance and 
excipients is sufficiently below the 30% of option 1 limits. Therefore, an elemental impurity 
specification and associated limit are not proposed. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. No additional reference standards are used for analysis of finished 
product beyond those described for the active substance. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 2 commercial scale batches in the proposed manufacturing site, 
these batches have equivalent quality as the batches manufactured at other manufacturing site for 
clinical study and for primary stability studies. Therefore, it is confirmed the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 pilot scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for characteristics granules, characteristics suspension, assay of fidaxomicin, assay 
of  sodium  benzoate,  related  substances,  dissolution,  water  content,  pH,  viscosity,  dose  uniformity  of 
suspension, and microbial limits. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant changes were observed in any of 
the  monitored  parameters  through  36  months  and  6  months  of  storage  at  25°C/60%RH  and 
40°C/75%RH, respectively, compared to the initial values. 
 
 
 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  The  results  demonstrated  that  the  finished  product  without  the 
primary packaging configuration did not meet the acceptance criteria after light exposure.  Therefore, a 
light protective package is proposed. 
A bulk holding study was conducted using one batch of pilot scale final blend.  The results 
demonstrated no significant change. 
Three primary stability batches were used for an in-use stability study.  The in-use stability testing was 
conducted  using  the  oral  suspension  dispersed  with  water  after  the  storage  of  the  primary  stability 
studies.  The in-use stability study was conducted according to the guideline, “In-use Stability Testing of 
Human  Medicinal  Products”  (CPMP/QWP/2934/99).    The  results  demonstrated  that  the  suspension 
prepared from the fidaxomicin granules (which are stored for 36 months at long term condition) is stable 
for at least 12 days when the suspension is stored in refrigerator. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without any special temperature 
storage conditions and stored in the original package in order to protect from light, as stated in the 
SmPC (section 6.3), are acceptable. The reconstituted suspension is stable for 12 days in a refrigerator 
(2°C – 8°C). 
Adventitious agents 
 No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its 
manufacturing process.  However, no design space were claimed for the manufacturing process of the 
finished product 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
No applicable 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Only three non-clinical toxicology studies (using the oral suspension formulation) have been submitted 
for this application.  These are addressed in the toxicological section. An overview of additional non-
 
 
 
clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data generated for oral capsule administration 
in adults is derived from the EPAR for Dificlir (original procedure EMEA/H/C/2087 from 2011). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Fidaxomicin (FXM) is a small molecular weight molecule that has been developed for the treatment of 
Gram-positive bacteria; in particular C. difficile infections. The mode of action is bactericidal and both 
parent compound and the major metabolite, OP-1118 have antimicrobial activity. FXM is an inhibitor of 
the enzyme RNA polymerase. The site of action is different from that of rifamycins.  
Primary and secondary pharmacodynamic studies  
Two primary pharmacodynamics studies were reported for Hamster. In the first of these studies, 
BIO070503A, hamsters were infected with C. difficile ATCC 43255 (passaged once through a mouse 
host), and mortality was compared between animals treated for 7 days with three dose levels of FXM 
(0.3, 0.8, and 2.5 mg/kg/day), vancomycin (5 mg/kg) or metronidazole (100 mg/kg). In order to 
avoid cross-contamination, animals were housed singly in microisolator cages. The 50% protective 
dose was lower than the lowest dose tested, 0.3 mg/kg (the animal that died due to non-C. difficile 
related causes is excluded from the ED50 calculation), and no animals died during the treatment phase 
in any of the other groups excluding control. As expected from this model, in which hamsters can 
redevelop infection following treatment removal, some animals (1 per group) died after treatment 
withdrawal. A second study, BIO120203A, investigated the impact of different formulations of FXM on 
efficacy in the hamster model. In this study, hamsters were infected with a clinical isolate of C. difficile 
(TTU614) and the relative efficacies of FXM suspended in water, xanthan gum, lecithin, and Labrasol 
were compared. The efficacies appeared similar, with 0/6 animals surviving in the untreated controls, 
and 1-2 animals dying in each of the treated groups, more often in the weeks following the end of 
treatment (as is common for this model, in which some animals will redevelop C. difficile infection.) 
This study therefore showed that the formulation is relatively unimportant to the efficacy of the 
compound. 
Pharmacological effects outside of the primary target have not been identified, and thus no mechanistic 
studies of this nature have been conducted. 
In summary, preclinical in vivo studies using clindamycin sensitised hamsters showed that FXM was 
effective in protecting animals from lethal infections with an ED50 of less than 0.3 mg/kg. Overall, the 
non-clinical pharmacology of FXM has been acceptably characterised and is consistent with expected 
clinical activity. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
A total of five safety pharmacology studies (four in-vivo studies and one in-vitro hERG study) were 
conducted. The in-vivo studies were conducted in rat (two studies for respiration and FOB-CNS effects 
using iv administration) and dog (two studies for cardiovascular effects). In the hERG study, there 
were no significant effects on hERG current (IC50 greater than max conc. FXM 7.85μg/mL, OP-1118 
8.37μg/mL). In an oral cardiovascular dog study, there were no effects on blood pressure, body temp, 
PR interval QRS complex, QTc interval (max dose 9600mg/kg). Lower pulse pressure was measured 
but with a small magnitude of change. In an intravenous route study in dog, the study was terminated 
at 1mg/kg due to tolerability problems (monitored up to 20 hours post dose). Transient pronounced 
drop in blood pressure and transient histamine like effects (red eyes, skin discoloration, salivation, 
prostration, twitching of paws) were observed. The excipient for the iv administration (solutol HS15) 
was likely the cause of the hypotension finding. In the oral cardiovascular dog study, where systemic 
 
 
levels more than those observed in the intravenous cardiovascular study were reached, no similar 
effects were seen. In the respiratory and CNS rat studies, there we no adverse effects (NOEL 7.5mg/kg 
for both studies). No specific safety pharmacology studies on the renal/urinary system or the 
gastrointestinal system were conducted but data from toxicity studies in dog showed that high doses 
(9600 mg/kg) may produce gastrointestinal effects such as emesis and diarrhoea. Overall, the non-
clinical pharmacology and safety pharmacology of FXM have been acceptably characterised and has not 
revealed any unexpected effects.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic and/or toxicokinetic studies with fidaxomicin (FXM) have been performed in rat, rabbit 
and dog and monkey using validated bioanalytical methods for plasma (rat, rabbit, dog, monkey) and 
faeces (dog). FXM has poor aqueous solubility, especially at low pH. This is likely linked to the overall 
low systemic bioavailability in all species observed after oral capsule administration. The rat seems to 
have a rapid intestinal metabolism of FXM, as little FXM was detected in colon and caecum (< 
0.01mg/g). This indicates that the rat is less suitable to use in oral toxicology studies. Following oral 
administration of FXM in dog, measurable plasma concentrations were achieved. A 3-month repeated 
dose study in beagle dogs, using the clinical tablet formulation and oral dose levels of 0, 1, 3.2, and 
9.6g/day showed that the extent of exposure for both FXM and OP-1118 increased with increasing 
dose, in a nonlinear fashion: AUC0-tlast increased greater than proportionally across the dosing range, 
while Cmax increased greater than proportionally between the 1 g and 3.2g doses and usually 
proportionally between the 3.2g and 9.6g doses. A large inter-animal variability was found, possibly 
due to differences in local gut pH. Depending on vehicle used, bioavailability was at the most 3%. Male 
and female cynomolgus monkeys were dosed for 28 days with 0, 10, 30, and 90mg/kg/day of FXM. 
Plasma levels (Cmax and AUC) increased approximately proportionately between the doses. Overall, 
exposure in monkey after oral doses was lower than in dog, supporting the choice of dog as the best 
animal model (compared to rat and monkey) to use in toxicity studies.  
A greater than proportional increase in plasma levels with dose was recorded in rat and dog given 
intravenous doses and the metabolite OP-1118 exhibited similar greater than proportional increases 
with dose, except in dog where saturation was seen at high doses. Exposure to the metabolite OP-
1118 appeared saturated at 4mg/kg (iv.) and no further increase was seen with the high dose of 
7.5mg/kg (iv.). 
The volume of distribution was generally less than total body water, indicating that the small amount 
of drug absorbed is not preferentially partitioned out of total body water and that the ng/mL plasma 
concentrations observed are an appropriate measure of systemic exposure. Studies on protein binding 
in plasma from rats, rabbits, dogs, and humans showed no large differences between species. For FXM, 
the plasma protein binding in rats, rabbits, dogs, and humans was 96.8%, 98.5%, 97.5%, and 97.8%, 
and for OP-1118, 93.5%, 97.7%, 92.0%, and 96.1%, respectively, over the concentration ranges 
tested (0.1-100 μg/mL). 
FXM was hydrolysed to the active major metabolite OP-1118 (desisobutyryl fidaxomicin) in rat, dog, 
monkey and human (not studied in vivo in monkey). OP-1118 was the major species produced in 
rabbit (molar AUC ratio 6.55-10.75) but was detected at modest levels in rat (data from pregnant 
animals) and dog (molar AUC ratios of 0.28-0.41 in rat and 0.09-0.33 in dog). The transformation was 
not CYP or NADPH dependent and is likely to be catalysed via an esterase. Other minor pathways 
identified in vitro include monohydroxylation, sulphation, and glucuronidation. Among these 
metabolites, only acyl migration and hydrolysis products were detected in plasma, urine, and faeces 
from dogs. The half-life for both parent compound and major metabolite was less than one hour in rat 
and rabbit and somewhat longer in dog. 
 
 
A study with radiolabelled compound in dogs was conducted in which dogs were orally administered 
(gavage) 6.47 mg/kg of [3H]-FXM, to deliver 245.6μCi/dog. Total recovery of radioactivity was 87%; of 
this, over 99% was recovered in the faeces, while < 1% was recovered in the urine. In bile duct 
cannulated Beagle dogs administered FXM (400mg/kg as tablets) less than 1% of the administered 
drug was recovered in the bile as either FXM or OP-1118. The overall recovery in faeces and bile for 
FXM and OP-1118 was 92.1% ± 9.32% in male and 92.3% ± 11.7% in female dogs. Based upon the 
observation that a second concentration peak was observed in the plasma of some dogs following oral 
administration, hepatic recirculation is possible, although the extent is likely to be low. 
FXM has demonstrated mild inhibition of certain CYP enzymes at levels (10μg/mL) near the solubility 
limit at physiological pH. OP-1118 is, however, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, at concentrations achievable in 
the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the potential for inhibition of gut CYP3A4 cannot be ruled out. Both 
FXM and OP-1118 are substrates for efflux pumps, and this efflux is inhibited by cyclosporine A and 
ketoconazole, inhibitors of P-glycoprotein. FXM is also an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, with an IC50 of 
2.59μM (2.74μg/mL), while OP-1118 is a much weaker inhibitor (IC50 > 125μM, or 123μg/mL). The 
inhibitory effect of FXM and OP-1118 on other intestinal transporters has not been investigated. 
In summary, based on pharmacokinetic considerations, the best toxicological animal model for FXM of 
those tested is the dog. FXM has low systemic availability after oral administration and the distribution 
after uptake seems to mainly be in the gastrointestinal tract. FXM has one main metabolite OP-1118 
which is also present in humans. The excretion of FXM is mainly via the faeces.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Three new non-clinical toxicology studies in Beagle dog using the oral suspension formulation (one 
adult repeat-dose toxicity study and two juvenile toxicity studies) have been submitted in order to fulfil 
PIP requirements (last modification EMEA/000636/PIP01-09-M07). The toxicological assessment for 
this Paediatric Line Extension will primarily concern itself with the novel non-clinical submitted studies 
with the focus being on the oral suspension usage in juvenile animals. Toxicological data from the 
already conducted non-clinical assessment of oral capsules will be mentioned depending on their 
relevance to the new studies.  
Choice of animal models 
FXM has a low bioavailability, partly due to a low solubility, in all its tested oral formulations (see 
below). Among tested animal models (rat, dog, cynomolgus, rabbit), and based on pharmacokinetic 
considerations, the dog was considered the best toxicological animal model for oral administration 
(only dog was used for long term 3-month repeat-dose toxicity assessment; monkey was only used in 
a single 28d study - high plasma exposure levels were not possible to reach despite repeated dosing). 
FXM has one major metabolite with antibiotic activity, OP-1118, that is present in rats, dog, 
cynomolgus and human. The newly submitted non-clinical studies in the present procedure are all in 
Beagle dog. 
Single dose toxicity 
No acute toxicity was seen in Beagle dog after a single oral dose of up to 120mg/kg. If FXM is given in 
a single iv. dose to dog, gastrointestinal problems are seen at 1mg/kg and clinical signs (e.g. 
decreased activity, tremor, difficulty breathing) are seen at 4 and 7.5mg/kg.  
 
 
 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Dogs were exposed to FXM for 14d or 3-months. In the 14d-studies (n=2-3 animals per dose and sex), 
doses up to 6400mg/dog did not generate toxicity and 9600mg/dog gave some gastrointestinal 
problems (pale faeces, soft faeces and yellow faeces observed). In the pivotal 3-month + 28d recovery 
dog study (n=4-7 animals per dose and sex; 1000 to 9600mg/day corresponding to 101 to 942mg/kg 
in males, 121 to 1190mg/kg in females), there were no test-article related effects on body weights, 
food consumption, clinical or anatomic pathology parameters, ECG or any ophthalmic lesions. The main 
effects of FXM administration were limited to the GI-system, as evidenced by clinical signs of 
pale/yellow faeces and white emesis. The GI-effects were considered to be a localized effect caused by 
the high number of tablets administered per day to the dogs (total administered drug product was 
equivalent to approximately 5-7% of the daily food intake) rather than an indicator of test article-
related toxicity. The NOEL was defined as 5 tablets/day (1000 mg/animal/day) and the NOAEL as 48 
tablets/day (9600 mg/animal/day, corresponding to 942 mg/kg/day in males and 1190mg/kg/day in 
females, based on average body weights), the highest dose administered. At the NOAEL dose, the 
lowest average Cmax values measured at either time point (day 0 or day 86) for either sex was 
3010ng/mL for FXM and 361ng/mL for the metabolite OP-1118, which are ~100-fold and ~4-fold 
higher than peak concentrations seen in CDI patients. The lowest average AUC0-tlast values measured 
at either time point for either sex were 8160ngxhr/mL for FXM and 945ngxhr/mL for OP-1118, which 
are ~20-fold and ~0.6-fold, respectively, compared to what might be seen in patients at the 
therapeutic dose. 
In an 7d repeat-dose toxicity dog study for oral formulation comparison (oral capsule vs. oral 
suspension; dose: 200mg/kg; n=2-4 animals per group), there was no observed toxicity and the mean 
exposure to FXM and OP-1118 in plasma and faeces was generally higher with oral capsule compared 
to oral suspension (inter-animal variability was generally high and precluded rigorous comparisons 
between genders, dosage forms or other studies). This would indicate that there is even less 
bioavailability for the oral suspension. 
Genotoxicity 
Neither FXM nor OP-1118 were mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay, while an increased 
frequency of cells with chromosomal aberrations was observed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells 
after treatment with FXM in absence of metabolic activation at concentrations ≥100 ug/mL. In order to 
reflect the high concentrations of FXM in the GI-tract as opposed to low systemic exposure and to 
evaluate the possible local clastogenic effect of this drug an in vivo comet analysis of liver and 
duodenal cells has been performed. Rats were treated with oral capsule FXM up to 2000mg/kg/day 
(~150-fold over the human daily dose when scaled by small intestinal surface area) for two days and 
the comet analysis showed no difference in liver cells while a dose dependent trend in decreased Tail 
DNA was shown in duodenal cells. However, there was no significant difference in Tail DNA between 
treated and control (vehicle treated) rats at any of the doses used and no significant effect on Tail 
Migration or Tail Moment. In addition, only two animals had a Tail DNA % outside the historical vehicle 
control range (2.00-9.25%), 1 out of 6 rats in each of the 1000 and 2000mg/kg/day dose groups, 
1.60% and 1.19%, respectively. Overall, the biological relevance of the decreased trend in %Tail DNA 
is considered highly questionable.  
Carcinogenicity 
Considering the established and proposed short treatment period (10d for adults and children), 
carcinogenicity studies were not conducted with FXM in the original application and no new 
carcinogenicity studies have been submitted for the paediatric extension. 
 
 
Local tolerance  
No local tolerance studies have been performed.  
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
FXM is unlikely to be phototoxic as it has very low absorbance in the 290-700 nM range, combined with 
the low bioavailability and low expected systemic exposure. 
Impurities 
Based on a rat Comet assay study (2000mg/kg), the exposure margins for a total of 11 specified 
impurities in the oral suspension have been estimated (and adjusted for average small intestine 
surface area in rat and human) for the specification. This gave a margin estimate range between 12x 
and 90x which is considered acceptable considering the short treatment period (10d). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Fidaxomicin (CAS #873857-62-6) is a macrolide antibiotic that has formula C52H74Cl2O18 and a 
molecular weight of 1058.04g/mol. It has a log Kow of 4.4 at pH7. A default estimate of surface water 
predicted environmental concentration (PECSW) gives 2ug/L (400mg dose, Fpen 1%; triggering a Phase 
II assessment) and a 10d adjusted treatment regime gives 0.055ug/L. The present extension that 
extends the indication to the 0-18year age group, is estimated to generate a maximum environmental 
exposure increase of 2.4%. FXM has a moderate potential for binding to soils/sludges and rapidly 
moves from surface waters to sediments with a water DT50 2.8-3.4d and sediment DT50 26.9-63.3d at 
20◦C and 57.1-134 at 12◦C. As such, FXM can be considered persistent in sediment (>120d). 
FXM degrades into several transformation products (TPs) whereof three being major TPs (>10% 
applied radioactivity in sediment). Out of those TPs, one was OP-1118 (‘component 17’; also seen in 
animals and humans) and another (‘component 15’) was an isomer of OP-1118. Considering that OP-
1118 is an active metabolite to FXM, this would indicate that these TPs also have antibiotic activity to 
some, likely lesser, extent. In an aquatic toxicity assessment, cyanobacteria (Anabaena) were found to 
be the most sensitive model organism with a growth rate NOEC of 5.82mg/L and a biomass NOEC of 
1.62mg/L (EC10 of 2.7mg/L). Sludge bacteria were second most sensitive at a NOEC of 5.9mg/L 
(similar in sensitivity to algae based on growth rate and less sensitive based on biomass endpoint). No 
effects were seen in Daphnia, developing fathead minnow (P. promelas) or developing harlequin fly (C. 
riparus). None of the effects gave rise to a risk quotient (RQ) over 1 (or 0.1 for microorganisms based 
on cyanobacteria or sludge bacteria).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH for Dificlir has submitted three non-clinical toxicology studies (using the oral suspension 
formulation), thereby fulfilling the PIP requirements for this paediatric line extension. All TK 
measurements conducted came with uncertainties due to low levels of target in samples (often <LOQ) 
and high inter-animal variation in combination with a relatively limited group size (common in dog 
studies). No exact quantification was possible between the oral capsule and oral suspension uptake in 
adult dogs, but the data indicates that the already low bioavailability with oral capsules is even lower 
with the oral suspension and that the uptake in very early life in dog (PND4) is greater than when older 
(PND31).  
Beside a more general assessment, the juvenile toxicity studies were conducted to investigate if FXM 
would affect gastrointestinal properties and/or development if given at a very early age. While the 
dose-range finding study observed some minor clinical GI-signs (i.e. liquid/yellow material in faeces) at 
the high dose (200mg/kg), no such effects were detected in the pivotal study (also max dose of 
200mg/kg). Both studies started at PND4 (the dose-range finding study ending exposure at PND17 and 
the pivotal study ending at PND31). As such, there are no clear signs that FXM has any GI-toxicity at 
an early age in dog. 
As the log Kow is > 3 for FXM, an OECD TG305 bioaccumulation study is generally required but the 
physicochemical properties of 2.4nm diameter and a molecular weight of nearly 1100g/mol 
(1058g/mol) indicates that the likelihood for bioaccumulation is reduced (considered lowered at 
>1.7nm average diameter and >1100g/mol), making it less likely that an OECD TG305 study data is 
necessary. Overall, with regard to the ERA for FXM, while FMX is persistent in sediment, there are no 
indications that FXM is an environmental risk or a PBT substance.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the toxicological program for the oral suspension formulation did not reveal any fidaxomicin 
hazards to consider. There are no objections to an approval of the Paediatric line extension of Dificlir 
from a non-clinical point of view.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The product is intended for local action in the GI-tract. The pharmacokinetics is therefore mainly of 
interest for systemic safety evaluations. Efficacy conclusions based on PK data are not valid given that 
the site of action is prior to plasma. 
Different oral suspension formulations were used in the two studies. A powder formulation was 
investigated for reconstitution in OPT-80-206 and a granule formulation in SUNSHINE. The granule 
formulation used in SUNSHINE is the to-be-marketed-formulation. 
The plasma and faecal concentrations of fidaxomicin and its main metabolite, OP-1118, were measured 
in both studies. The plasma sampling time points were selected based on the expected time of 
maximal concentration in adults, which is typically between 1 and 5 hours post-dose at steady state at 
day 5 for both fidaxomicin and OP-1118. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study OPT-80-206 
Plasma samples were collected 0 to 2 hours pre-dose and at 1 to 2 hours and 3 to 5 hours post-dose 
on any day between days 5 and 10. Faecal samples were collected within 24 hours post-dose on 
day 10 (or at the end of therapy, if sooner than day 10). In total, 36 patients were included in the 
plasma pharmacokinetic analysis set and 30 patients in the faecal pharmacokinetic analysis set. The 
mean plasma concentrations of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 are shown in table 3 below. 
Table 3. Summary of observed plasma levels of fidaxomicin (OPT-080) and OP-1118 
The overall mean concentration of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 in faecal samples were 3228 and 865 
μg/g, respectively.  
SUNSHINE 
Plasma samples were collected within 30 minutes pre-dose and 1 to 5 hours post-dose on any day 
between days 5 and 10 but not necessarily on the same day.  Faecal samples were collected within 
24 hours post-dose on any day between days 5 and 10. The mean plasma concentrations for 
fidaxomicin and its main metabolite OP-1118 approximately doubled post-dose relative to pre-dose. 
The mean plasma concentration of fidaxomicin in the paediatric population is shown in table 4 below.

Source: SUNSHINE, Table 12.4.1.1; Table 12.4.1.2; Table 12.4.1.4 and Table 12.4.1.5 
The mean (SD) fecal concentration of fidaxomicin was 2685.56 (2476.92) μg/g and 889.23 (817.83) 
μg/g for OP-1118.  
Pre- and post-dose plasma concentration values were higher for tablets as compared to oral 
suspension for both fidaxomicin and its metabolite OP-1118, see table 5 below. The mean (SD) post-
dose faecal concentrations for oral suspension (2969.87 [ 2713.58]) were higher compared to tablets 
(2190.63 [1948.68]); however, for its metabolite OP-1118, post-dose faecal concentrations for oral 
suspension (789.15 [728.58]) were lower as compared to tablets (1059.73 [941.04]).

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The primary pharmacology of fidaxomicin was previously described and discussed in detail in the 
original marketing authorisation application for the adult indication in 2011 (EMEA/H/C/002087). No 
new data are presented in this application.  No clinically significant differences in pharmacodynamics 
are expected between adult and paediatric subjects with CDAD, given the similarity of the 
pathophysiology of the disease. 
Preclinical studies and adult clinical studies with fidaxomicin do not indicate any signals on cardiac 
safety, as discussed in the original marketing authorisation application in 2011 (EMEA/H/C/002087). 
Given poor absorption from the GI tract, a thorough QT study in healthy volunteers exposed for high 
doses of the study drug was not considered feasible as part of the clinical development programme, 
and this was previously accepted by CHMP considering the absence of preclinical signal.  
In the paediatric studies OPT-80-206 and SUNSHINE, no safety signal was observed relating to an 
effect of fidaxomicin on QTc. 
 
 
 
 
 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
There are limited pharmacokinetic data available for the paediatric population. Of the two submitted 
studies only OPT-80-206 had investigation of PK as an objective, but due to sparse PK sampling limited 
pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained. In SUNSHINE the PK sampling was even more sparse. No 
modelling of plasma concentrations to obtain PK parameters (maximum plasma drug concentration, 
area under the time-concentration curve, etc) was planned for either study. Descriptive statistics were 
presented for all summarized data. In SUNSHINE one subject below 6 months of age was included, 
however there is only one post-dose concentration available for this subject (no pre-dose or faecal 
concentration). In OPT-80-206 the youngest subject enrolled was 11 months. There is thus in practice 
no PK-data for the youngest population (< 6 months). 
From the studies in adults it was concluded that the systemic absorption of fidaxomicin is low. 
Although there is no estimate of absolute bioavailability in humans it was determined in several 
nonclinical dog studies, using different formulations with various solubility enhancers, with estimates 
around 0.2- 3%.  
From the submitted studies systemic absorption appears low also in the paediatric population. 
Systemic exposure is relevant to the assessment of clinical safety. From the presented data no clear 
correlation of systemic exposure to age could be observed in either paediatric study. 
In the SUNSHINE study, the actual administered dose (of oral suspension) varied from < 15 
mg/kg/day to ≥ 30 mg/kg/day. An analysis of the plasma concentration of fidaxomicin by planned 
dosing groups was performed revealing no relevant difference in fidaxomicin concentration between 
the groups. 
The MAH has provided a comparison of the paediatric and adult plasma PK-data for both fidaxomicin 
and OP-1118. The analysis is limited by the small subset of the data from the SUNSHINE study 
available for the cross-study comparison (12 of 81 post-dose measurements were used). Overall there 
is however no indication that the plasma concentrations of fidaxomicin or the metabolite OP-1118 are 
higher in the paediatric patients than in the adult patients. The MAH states that they have not been 
able to develop a stable population PK model due to the low systemic concentrations of fidaxomicin. 
This limits the possibilities for further analysis of the data. In summary the systemic concentrations of 
fidaxomicin and OP-1118 are low and appear in general to be similar between the adult and paediatric 
population. 
It is conceivable that altered systemic exposure might arise due to disrupted intestinal mucosa in the 
most severely unwell subjects. The MAH has discussed the impact of severity of disease on the 
systemic exposure of fidaxomicin. The median plasma concentration values for fidaxomicin were 
different for the two groups of paediatric patients (with non-severe or severe disease) indicating that 
higher plasma concentrations are possibly achieved for the patients with severe disease compared to 
those with non-severe disease. However, the difference was not large and most patients’ plasma 
concentrations, irrespective of severity of the disease, were below 50 ng/ml. 
The faecal fidaxomicin concentrations appear somewhat higher in the paediatric population compared 
to the adult population although the variability was high. There is a trend of higher mean 
concentrations in the youngest age group. According to the Applicant these samples would typically be 
collected from diapers, which may dehydrate the sample and contribute a positive bias to the 
concentration measured. Faecal concentrations of fidaxomicin were well over the MIC of the organism 
across the weight/age range in the paediatric population. 
 
 
Comparisons between the fidaxomicin oral suspension and tablets indicate that the systemic 
absorption is lower for the oral suspension compared to the tablets (both pre- and post-dose plasma 
concentrations are lower). The same trend is seen in non-clinical studies in dogs (see separate non-
clinical AR). High inter-subject variability precludes rigorous comparisons between dosage forms in 
both human and animal data.  
Pharmacodynamics 
The primary pharmacology of fidaxomicin was previously described and discussed in detail in the 
original marketing authorisation application for the adult indication in 2011 (EMEA/H/C/002087). No 
new data are presented in this application.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Several of the cross-study comparisons of the plasma PK-data are limited by the fact that a different 
sampling schedule was used in the SUNSHINE study resulting in only a small subset of all PK-data 
being available for the comparisons. The lack of a population PK-model limits the possibilities of further 
analysis of the data. Fidaxomicin is locally acting and the PK-data thus only relevant for assessing the 
safety. Overall, there is no indication that the systemic exposures of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 are 
higher in the paediatric population compared to the adult population. 
The Applicant has provided acceptable responses to all pharmacokinetic issues. There are no objections 
to an approval of the Paediatric line extension of Dificlir from a pharmacokinetic point of view. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose-response studies were performed with paediatric subjects. The approach to paediatric dosing 
was agreed with PDCO and is captured in the Key Binding Elements of the PIP.  
The adult fidaxomicin dose of 400 mg/day was selected from a Phase 2 study of 100, 200 and 400 
mg/day, in which the highest dose was associated with the most favourable response (no primary 
failures, shortest time to diarrhoea resolution, highest proportion of subjects entirely free of CDI 
symptoms at EOT). 
The paediatric weight-based dosing regimen for fidaxomicin, used in the paediatric studies, was 
selected by scaling from the vancomycin dose authorised in children for CDAD. The standard dose of 
vancomycin in adults is 500 mg/day, while that for fidaxomicin is 20% lower at 400 mg/day. 
Therefore, the total daily dose of fidaxomicin for paediatric subjects was chosen to be 20% lower 
(32 mg/kg) than the standard daily dose of vancomycin (40 mg/kg). Correspondingly, above a weight 
cut-off of ≥12.5 kg, the adult dose of 200 mg q12h (administered either as tablet or oral suspension) 
can be used. Scaling against vancomycin was considered appropriate by the MAH because neither drug 
is significantly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  
A 10-day treatment duration was selected for the paediatric population, as for adults, because clinical 
cure rates of 85.7% to 88.2% for fidaxomicin were seen in adult phase 3 studies with a 10-day 
treatment period. 
 
 
 
 
 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The single arm Phase 2 study OPT-80-206 used a different formulation than the to-be-marketed 
granules for suspension. Therefore, the main support for efficacy in the paediatric population comes 
from the randomised, single-blind, active comparator SUNSHINE study. 
Study OPT-80-206 
A Phase 2A, Multicentre, Open-label, Uncontrolled Study to Determine the Safety, 
Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Fidaxomicin Oral Suspension or Tablets in 
Paediatric Subjects with Clostridium difficile–associated Diarrhoea 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The study was conducted at 11 sites in the US and Canada. 
Key inclusion criteria: 
1)  Male or female subjects 6 months to < 18 years of age diagnosed with CDAD, which was defined 
by a positive stool C. difficile toxin A and/or toxin B assay result within 48 hours of enrolment and: 
a)  Subjects 6 to 23 months: >3 episodes of watery diarrhoea in the 24 hours prior to enrolment. 
b)  Subjects 2 years to < 18 years: A change in bowel habits, with >3 unformed bowel 
movements (UBMs) in the 24 hours prior to enrolment. 
Key exclusion criteria: 
1)  Need for concurrent use of oral vancomycin, metronidazole, or any other effective treatments for 
CDAD during therapy with fidaxomicin. 
2)  Fulminant colitis. 
3)  A history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease). 
4)  Need for concurrent use of the following P-glycoprotein inhibitors during therapy with fidaxomicin: 
cyclosporine, itraconazole, and ketoconazole; erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin; 
verapamil, dronedarone and amiodarone, captopril, carvedilol, conivaptan, diltiazem, felodipine, 
lopinavir and ritonavir, quercetin, quinidine, and ranolazine. Topical ointments were not excluded, 
nor were administration of any P-glycoprotein inhibitors during the follow up period. 
No other antibacterials potentially effective against CDAD were permitted during the study unless 
specifically given because of primary treatment failure or recurrence. Anti-diarrhoeal medicines and 
drugs affecting peristalsis were to be avoided. 
Treatments 
Subjects aged 6 months to <6 years received weight-based doses of fidaxomicin oral suspension 32 
mg/kg/day (maximum 400 mg/day), divided into 2 doses taken q12h. The amount of oral suspension 
was calculated based on the subject’s weight and was calculated at enrollment and remained 
consistent throughout the treatment period. There was no further adjustment for changes in weight 
during the treatment period. 
 
 
 
Subjects aged 6 years to <18 years received fidaxomicin 200 mg tablets, PO q12h. 
The protocol was amended to allow a subject aged 6 years and older who could not swallow a tablet to 
receive a crushed tablet (if the oral suspension was not available), and to allow a subject to receive the 
full adult dose of 400 mg/day (either as oral suspension or tablets) if the weight requirement 
(≥ 12.5 kg) was met.  
During the treatment period, a change of formulation or change in dosing was not allowed. 
The subject received study medication administered orally with or without food each day for 10 days 
(20 doses; q12h regimen).  
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK of fidaxomicin 
oral suspension or tablets in paediatric subjects, with CDAD, following the administration of doses 
given every 12 hours (q12h) for 10 consecutive days. 
The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical outcome (clinical response at EOT and 
sustained clinical response through EOT + 28 days).  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy Variables included: 
• 
Initial clinical response (ICR) rate at End of Treatment (EOT). 
In subjects <2 years, positive clinical response was defined as absence of watery diarrhoea for two 
consecutive days with no requirement of further CDAD therapy within 2 days after completion of study 
drug.  
In subjects between 2 and < 18 years, positive clinical response was defined as ≤3 unformed bowel 
movements (UBM) for two consecutive days with no requirement of further CDAD therapy during 
treatment and subjects remain well until the time of study drug discontinuation. 
Clinical response was assessed at Day 10 or the last day of dosing if a positive clinical response was 
achieved before Day 10. Confirmation of a positive clinical response was assessed 2 to 3 days after the 
end of therapy. 
Treatment failures were not evaluated further for clinical efficacy beyond the point of failure. Only 
subjects who achieved positive ICR were monitored for SCR and recurrence.  
•  Sustained clinical response (defined as no recurrence between EOT and EOT +28 days). 
•  Recurrence and time to recurrence (defined between EOT and EOT +28 days). 
• 
Time to resolution of diarrhoea (defined from first study drug dose to last UBM before 2 
consecutive days of ≤ 3 UBMs). 
•  Stool sample microbiology at pre-enrolment (Day 1), EOT, early termination and any 
unscheduled visit for recurrence, including susceptibility of screening isolates to reference 
antibiotics (fidaxomicin, vancomycin, metronidazole, rifaximin). 
Safety Variables included: 
Adverse Events, Vital signs, Laboratory parameters. 
 
 
Toxin A/B testing was repeated at early termination visit for subjects who did not have a clinical 
response and at any unscheduled visit for recurrence, but not otherwise routinely after Day 1.  
Sample size 
The sample size was based on clinical and practical considerations, not on formal statistical power 
calculation. Up to 35 subjects were planned to be enrolled, stratified by age at enrolment:  
•  6–23 months;  
•  2 years to <6 years;  
•  6 years to <12 years; 
•  12 years to <18 years. 
Statistical methods 
Descriptive statistics were presented for all summarized data. Analyses of clinical outcome (except for 
recurrence) were performed using the mITT and PP populations. 
The safety population included all subjects with any evaluable safety data who had received at least 
one dose of fidaxomicin. This population was the primary analysis set used in all safety summaries. 
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population included all subjects with CDAD confirmed by a 
positive toxin assay within 24 hours before enrolment who received at least one dose of study 
medication. This population was one analysis set used in efficacy summaries. 
The per-protocol (PP) population was another analysis set used in efficacy summaries. It consisted of 
subjects in the mITT population who met the following criteria: 
•  Met all of the inclusion criteria and met none of the exclusion criteria (unless deviations to 
either of these were documented and approved by the sponsor). 
•  Were exposed to a sufficient course of therapy: subjects required at least 3 complete days (6 
active doses of fidaxomicin) to be considered treatment failures and 8 complete days (16 
active doses of fidaxomicin) to be considered as having a positive clinical response. 
•  Had an end-of-therapy clinical evaluation. 
•  Did not have significant protocol violations, including use of concomitant CDAD therapy or 
other drugs that could have confounded the assessment of efficacy. 
The mITT population for recurrence and the PP population for recurrence included subjects in the mITT 
and PP populations, respectively, who achieved a positive clinical response. 
Subjects with the investigator’s assessment of clinical response missing, as well as those who died 
before investigator assessed clinical response, were treated as clinical failures. Missing values in the 
investigator’s classification of recurrence prior to EOT + 28 days were treated as recurrence. Missing 
dates and times were imputed. 
For clinical response rate, recurrence, and sustained response, 2-sided 95% CIs were summarized for 
each age group and for all age groups combined. For time to recurrence, the survival function (in 
days) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. For TTROD, subjects were censored at time of 
discontinuation, except for those subjects who completed the end-of-therapy visit and did not have 
resolution of diarrhoea, who were censored at 240 hours. 
 
 
 
 
 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 38 subjects were enrolled. 
Table 6.  Subject Disposition, All Enrolled Subjects (SUNSHINE) 
Most subjects completed EOT and few were withdrawn during the treatment period, but only two-thirds 
of subjects completed the entire study. During the follow-up period (EOT to EOT + 28 days), the major 
reason for withdrawals was recurrence, occurring in almost a quarter of the subjects (n=9, 24 %). The 
lowest EOT and study completion rates were seen amongst subjects aged ≥2 to <6 years, 
unfortunately the age sub-group that also started with the smallest number of enrolled subjects.  
Baseline data 
Baseline disease severity categories were defined as follows: 
•  Mild: 4 to 5 UBMs/day or WBC count ≤12,000/mm³. 
•  Moderate: 6 to 9 UBMs/day or WBC count 12,001/mm3 to 15,000/mm³. 
•  Severe: ≥10 UBMs/day or WBC count ≥15,001/mm³. 
 
 
 
 
 
Either of the defining characteristics (UBMs/day or WBC count) assigned a subject to a category, with a 
default to the more severe category when signs/symptoms overlapped.

Medical history 
Conditions reported by >10% of subjects at baseline included, as expected, gastrointestinal disorders 
(abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, nausea, and vomiting) and 
gastrointestinal-related infections and infestations (clostridial infection and C. difficile colitis), but also 
anaemia, gastrostomy tube insertion, pyrexia, otitis media, thrombocytopenia, failure to thrive, 
dehydration, esophagogastric fundoplasty, cerebral palsy, hypertension, sepsis, sinusitis, and 
tachycardia.  
Overall, 23.7% of subjects had a history of neoplasms (benign, malignant, and unspecified).  
Prior and concomitant medications 
 
 
 
 
Prior to the study 36.8% of subjects had taken metronidazole and 23.7% had received oral 
vancomycin as an antidiarrheal/anti-inflammatory. Prior use of antidiarrheal and intestinal anti-
inflammatory drugs was reported by 39.5% of subjects. Prior use of systemic antibiotics (not including 
those effective in the treatment of CDAD) was reported by 26.3% of subjects, including cephalosporins 
(13.2%), clindamycin (5.3%), and fluoroquinolones (2.6%), which have historically been considered to 
put adults at high risk for CDAD. 
Overall, 18.4% of subjects received systemic antibiotics concomitantly with study medication, ranging 
from 11.1% to 25.0% across age groups. Piperacillin/tazobactam was the most frequently used 
concomitant antibiotic (13.2% of subjects). Metronidazole and vancomycin were each used 
concomitantly by 5.3% of subjects.  
During the follow-up period, 26.3% of subjects received systemic antibiotics (not including those 
effective in the treatment of CDAD). Piperacillin/tazobactam was the most frequently used antibiotic 
(10.5% of subjects) during this period. 
Compliance 
A 100.0% compliance rate was reported for 84.2% of all subjects (Safety analysis set). All subjects 
with a compliance <100.0% were in the ≥2 to <6 years age category (4 subjects achieving between 
<20% and 80-<100% compliance).

Source: Adapted from OPT-80-206, Table 14.2.1; Table 14.2.2; and Table 14.2.3. 
Numerically lower clinical response (75%) and sustained clinical response (50%) rates were observed 
in the ≥2 to <6 years age group vs other age groups, but small sub-groups make this difficult to 
interpret. Lower compliance and lower EOT and study completion rates in this age group, which was 
already the smallest in size at study start, may be partly responsible for this finding. 
The denominator used for SCR appears to be the mITT population rather than only the sub-group of 
subjects with clinical response at EOT (this differs from SUNSHINE). This is despite the fact the 
protocol states that only subjects who achieved positive ICR were monitored for SCR and recurrence, 
whereas treatment failures were not evaluated further for clinical efficacy beyond the point of failure. 
When the number of positive clinical responses is instead used as denominator, the overall SCR 
amongst responding subjects is 71.4%. 
The median time to resolution of diarrhoea varied considerably between age groups. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Time to Recurrence of CDAD, All Age Groups, mITT (OPT-80-206) 
The overall recurrence rate (28.6%) was consistent across the age sub-groups and is notably higher 
than that observed for fidaxomicin in SUNSHINE (11.8%), and also higher that that observed in Phase 
3 studies of fidaxomicin in adults (14% pooled fidaxomicin subjects, mITT population). As seen in adult 
subjects, recurrence rate on fidaxomicin was approximately stable throughout the four weeks following 
EOT. Of the 10 paediatric subjects with recurrence, 9 subjects had one or more prior episode of CDAD 
or prior treatment for CDAD.  
Microbiology 
Table 10. Susceptibility of Screening Isolates by Clinical Response and 
Antibiotic, mITT (OPT-80-206) 
The MIC values of screening isolates associated with clinical failure were actually lower (MIC90 0.5 
μg/mL) than those associated with clinical cure (MIC90 1 μg/mL). This suggests that clinical failure was 
not due to lack of susceptibility to fidaxomicin, and other factors such as concurrent infection with 
other GI pathogens, and tolerability and compliance of the treatment, may be involved. 
 
 
 
 
 
Study 2819-CL-0202 (“SUNSHINE”) 
A phase 3, multicentre, investigator-blind, randomised, parallel-group study to 
investigate the safety and efficacy of a 10-day course of fidaxomicin oral 
suspension or tablets taken every q12h as compared to vancomycin oral liquid or 
capsules taken every q6h for 10 days in paediatric subjects with Clostridium 
difficile-associated diarrhoea. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The study was conducted in North America (23 sites) and Europe (Poland (9 sites), France (7 sites), 
Germany (7 sites), Romania (6 sites), Hungary (5 sites), Spain (5 sites), Italy (4 sites), Belgium (3 
sites), Canada (3 sites) and Slovakia (2 sites). 
Key inclusion criteria: 
1.  Male and female subjects from birth to < 18 years of age (US-only: aged ≥ 6 months to < 18 
years) diagnosed with CDAD according to local diagnostic criteria. As a minimum there was to 
be positive detection, within 72 hours prior to randomization, of either toxin A and/or toxin B in 
stool or positive detection of toxigenic C. difficile in stool and: 
a.  Subject from birth to < 2 years of age: watery diarrhoea in the 24 hours prior to 
screening  
b.  Subject ≥ 2 years to < 18 years of age: > 3 UBMs in the 24 hours prior to screening 
2.  For subjects < 5 years of age: negative rotavirus test (a pre-consent SOC test within 3 days of 
randomisation and after onset of diarrhoea was accepted). 
The following Exclusion criteria applied: 
1.  Concurrent use of metronidazole, oral vancomycin or any other antibiotic treatments for CDAD. 
If the investigator felt the clinical imperative to begin treatment before knowing the laboratory 
result for toxigenic C. difficile, up to 4 doses but no more than 24 hours of treatment with 
metronidazole, oral vancomycin or any other effective treatment for CDAD were allowed. 
2.  Pseudomembranous colitis, fulminant colitis, toxic megacolon or ileus. 
3.  History of inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease). 
4.  Diarrhoea caused by an agent other than C. difficile (e.g., infections, infestations, drugs). 
5.  Known hypersensitivity to fidaxomicin, vancomycin or their excipients or to teicoplanin. 
6.  Subject had received an investigational therapy within 28 days, prior to screening, with the 
exception of studies with primary treatment for cancer without novel investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) and which do not affect the assessment of diarrhoea. 
7.  Subject had a condition which, in the investigator's opinion, made the subject unsuitable for 
study participation. 
8.  France only: subject had a weight of < 2.5 kg (Amendment 4). 
 
 
 
 
Treatments 
Eligible subjects were randomised 2:1 to fidaxomicin or vancomycin groups. Subjects aged <6 years 
received oral liquid, while subjects ≥6 years received tablets. During the treatment period, a change of 
formulation or change in dosing was not allowed. 
The subject received study medication administered orally with or without food each day for 10 days 
(20 doses; q12h regimen).

If a subject aged ≥6 years could not swallow tablets or capsules, fidaxomicin oral suspension or 
vancomycin oral liquid could be given as per the subject's treatment allocation. During the treatment 
period, a change of formulation or change in dosing was not allowed. 
Antimicrobial agents potentially useful in the treatment of CDAD (e.g., metronidazole, oral 
vancomycin, oral bacitracin, fusidic acid, rifaximin, nitazoxanide) or faecal transplantation were not 
permitted during the study, unless they were specifically given because of a primary treatment failure 
or suspected CDAD recurrence after a positive initial response. There were a number of drugs that 
were to be avoided during the study e.g. drugs which could affect peristalsis, loperamide. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to investigate the clinical response to fidaxomicin granules for 
oral suspension or tablets and vancomycin oral liquid or capsules of paediatric subjects with CDAD. 
The secondary objectives of this study were to investigate the recurrence/sustained clinical response to 
and safety of fidaxomicin and vancomycin in paediatric subjects with CDAD, as well as palatability of 
the fidaxomicin oral suspension formulation. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy variable 
Confirmed Clinical Response (CCR) based on the assessment by the investigator at end of treatment 
(EOT) + 2 days in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population, in subjects with a documented positive Initial 
Clinical Response (ICR). Subjects with no ICR were expected to have no CCR. 
In subjects <2 years, CCR was defined as absence of watery diarrhoea for two consecutive days with 
no requirement of further CDAD therapy within 2 days after completion of study drug.  
 
 
 
 
 
In subjects between 2 and < 18 years, CCR was defined as <3 unformed bowel movements (UBM) for 
two consecutive days with no requirement of further CDAD therapy during treatment. 
Subjects who did not achieve positive ICR with CCR at EOT + 2 days were contacted again only at End 
of Study (EOS) for safety follow-up. 
Secondary efficacy variables included: 
Initial clinical response (EOT). 
• 
•  Sustained clinical response (defined as no recurrence at EOT + 9, 16, 23 and 30 days in a 
subject with CCR at EOT + 2 days). 
•  Global cure (defined as no recurrence at EOT + 9, 16, 23 and 30 days in a subject regardless 
of outcome at EOT + 2 days). 
• 
Time to resolution of diarrhoea (defined from first study drug dose to last UBM before 
resolution of diarrhoea). 
•  Recurrence and time to recurrence (defined between EOT+2 days and EOT + 9, 16, 23 and 30 
days), with recurrence of diarrhoea defined as reestablishment of diarrhoea to an extent that 
was greater than note on the last day of study drug. 
•  Stool sample microbiology at pre-enrolment (Day 1), EOT, early termination and any 
unscheduled visit for recurrence, including positivity for other pathogens, and susceptibility of 
screening C. difficile isolates to reference antibiotics (fidaxomicin, vancomycin, metronidazole, 
rifaximin). 
• 
Palatability (subjects receiving the fidaxomicin oral suspension) on a 5-point rating svale 
(awful, poor, fair, good, excellent) on Day 1 and Day 7 ±1 of treatment. 
Safety Variables included: 
Adverse Events, Vital signs, Laboratory parameters. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) were pre-defined: 
•  Development of microbial resistance to fidaxomicin 
•  Hypersensitivity to fidaxomicin 
•  Gastrointestinal haemorrhage 
•  Haematological AEs: decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts 
•  Hepatic laboratory value abnormalities 
•  Renal laboratory value abnormalities 
•  QT interval prolongation 
• 
Lack of efficacy/lack of effect/treatment failure 
Toxin A/B testing was repeated at EOT, early termination visit for subjects who did not have a clinical 
response and at any unscheduled visit for recurrence, but not otherwise routinely after Day 1.  
Sample size 
The sample size was for this study was agreed on with the Paediatric Development Committee (PDCO) 
as part of the PIP and was based on clinical and practical considerations, as the prevalence of the 
target disease amongst paediatric subjects is low. The study was not powered for hypothesis testing. 
A total of 144 eligible subjects were planned to be randomised to either fidaxomicin or vancomycin in a 
2:1 ratio (96 randomised to fidaxomicin and 48 to vancomycin), stratified by age at screening with at 
least 24 subjects in each age group: 
 
 
 
From birth to < 24 months (2 years) of age (6 months to < 24 months at US sites), 
• 
•  ≥ 2 to < 6 years of age, 
•  ≥ 6 to < 12 years of age, and 
•  ≥ 12 to < 18 years of age. 
Randomisation 
Randomization 2:1, stratified by age group. 
Blinding (masking) 
The content of medication was unblinded to caregivers and delegated site staff members.  
Statistical methods 
The full analysis set (FAS), was the primary analysis population, consisting of all randomised subjects 
who received at least 1 dose of study drug. This population was the analysis set used in demographic, 
baseline disease characteristic and efficacy summaries. 
The safety analysis set (SAF) consists of all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of 
study drug (fidaxomicin or vancomycin). This population was the analysis set used in safety 
summaries. 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set consists of all randomised subjects, irrespective of a subject 
having received a study drug (fidaxomicin or vancomycin) or not. In the ITT analysis set, subjects 
were allocated to the treatment group corresponding to the study medication they were randomised to 
(treatment allocation as randomised). This population was the analysis set used for sensitivity analysis 
of the efficacy summaries. 
The pharmacokinetics analysis set (PKAS) consists of all subjects randomised to fidaxomicin, having 
received at least 1 dose of fidaxomicin and having at least 1 valid measurement of plasma 
concentration or faecal concentration of fidaxomicin or its main metabolite OP-1118. 
Within each treatment group, the proportion of subjects with confirmed clinical response (CCR=Yes) at 
EOT+2 days was calculated based on the entire number of FAS subjects, and also based on subjects 
with non-missing CCR (Yes/No). The corresponding two-sided 95% CI was calculated based on an 
exact binomial distribution for each treatment group. The unadjusted difference of proportions (FID - 
VAN) was to be calculated as well. 
Analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints were based on both the FAS and ITT analysis sets, except 
for SCR (positive CCR subjects only), recurrence of CDAD (positive CCR subjects only) and palatability 
(subjects receiving oral liquid formulation of either study drug). Sustained clinical response, recurrence 
of CDAD and Global cure were analysed using the same statistical methods as outlined for the primary 
analysis. 
For TTROD and Time to recurrence, the survival functions in both treatment groups were estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method and displayed graphically. Comparison of the survival curves of the 2 
treatment groups were done using log-rank test. Quartile estimates (25th, 50th [median], and 75th) 
along with 80th and 90th percentile estimates for the time to event and corresponding 2-sided 95% 
 
 
 
 
 
CIs were computed for both treatment groups. For subjects in the ITT analysis set who did not receive 
any study drug (possibly received another drug for diarrhoea), day 10 was used as EOT date for the 
TTROD analysis. Subjects with CCR at EOT + 2 days who completed the follow-up period but did not 
experience a recurrence of CDAD were censored at EOT + day 30. 
Summary tables for acceptability and palatability categories day 1 vs day 7 were presented for each 
treatment group for the total population as well as by age group. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The rate of study completion was good, at 97% for fidaxomicin, 91.3% for vancomycin, 95% overall. 
Conduct of the study 
A total of 4 amendments were made to the study protocol. The most clinically important are 
summarised below: 
Amendment 2 (21-11-14): change to the study population to enrol paediatric subjects from birth; 
removal of visit/physical examination from EOS timepoint; change in timeframe for positive detection 
of CDAD from within 48 hours prior to randomisation to within 72 prior to randomisation.

There was only one subject included below the age of 6 months (fidaxomicin group, enrolled in Italy). 
The lowest bodyweight enrolled was 4.3 kg.  
Two subjects received a single dose of metronidazole day one of the study treatment period most likely 
prior to the start of study drug. Two subjects received intravenous vancomycin which is not considered 
effective against CDI, one subject for a single day (day 12) and one subject for approximately 4 days, 
prior and concomitant to study medication. The administration of metronidazole and vancomycin in 
these subjects did likely not have an impact on the outcome of the CDI episodes. 
At screening only 31 (36.5%) subjects randomised to fidaxomicin and 19 (48.7%) subjects randomised 
to vancomycin were tested positive for C. difficile toxin by the central laboratory ELISA, while all 
subjects were positive according to local laboratory. The differences noted may be attributable to 
differences between techniques. In addition, the lack of positive testing at the central laboratory may 
be that the cause of GI symptoms was not C. difficile in all cases but other GI organisms or non-
infectious causes of diarrhoea, given the uncertainties regarding the definitive diagnosis of CDAD 
especially in the youngest children, who may carry C. difficile without apparent disease, and who also 
commonly suffer diarrheal illnesses secondary to other pathogens. 
A substantial proportion of subjects (43.9% fidaxomicin, 50% vancomycin) tested positive at 
Screening for GI organisms other than C. difficile. The toxins detected in the study population were a 
mix of bacterial and viral, and several subjects had more than 1 pathogen. 
Medical history 
Risk factors that contributed to the current episode of C. difficile infection were recorded for 79.6% 
subjects overall, most importantly the use of antibiotics in 51.0% subjects in the fidaxomicin group 
and 65.9% subjects in the vancomycin group.  Cancer as a risk factor was recorded in around 40% of 
subjects overall, with a similar percentage of subjects affected in both treatment groups. (Around a 
third of adult subjects in the Phase 3b/4 adult clinical study also had a medical history of neoplasm).   
In the 3 months prior to screening, 40% had experienced prior diarrhoea episodes (treated with 
antibacterial medications in 25%) and 27% had had prior diarrhoea episodes with confirmed CDAD 
(treated with antibiotics in 22%).  All these characteristics of diarrhoea history were found in a greater 
proportion of subjects in the fidaxomicin group compared with those in the vancomycin group, e.g., 
prior diarrhoea episodes in 43% and 34% subjects, respectively. Multiple previous CDAD recurrences 
were also reported in some subjects in the previous 3 months; 2 episodes in around 5% of subjects 
and ≥3 episodes in around 2% of subjects (similar between treatment groups).  
Most subjects (61%) had mild CDAD, as defined by 4 to 5 unformed bowel movements (UBMs) per day 
or a white blood cell count ≤ 12000/mm3. All subjects except one (result missing) were positive at 
screening for one or both C. difficile toxins A and B, and all subjects except one (not tested) <5 years 
of age had a negative rotavirus test. 
Prior and concomitant medications 
Previous medications were used by 98.6% subjects, most frequently antibacterials for systemic use 
(88.7%) and ophthalmological medicines (75.4%). Of note, a greater proportion of subjects in the 
fidaxomicin group compared with the vancomycin group had previously taken antidiarrhoeals, 
intestinal antiinflammatory/ antiinfective agents (69.4% vs 56.8%), antiemetics and antinauseants 
(43.9% vs 31.8%), mineral supplements (33.7 vs 18.2%) and drugs for constipation (34.7% vs 
13.6%). Notably, 39.4% of subjects had received vancomycin and 40.8% metronidazole as previous 
medications.  
The most frequently recorded concomitant medications (by therapeutic subgroup) were antibacterials 
for systemic use (71.1%) and ophthalmological medicines (71.1%), antidiarrheals, intestinal anti-

inflammatory /anti-infective agents (62.0% subjects), stomatological preparations (59.2% subjects), 
drugs for acid related disorders (51.4% subjects) and analgesics (56.3% subjects). Low and similar 
proportions of subjects in both treatment groups took prohibited medications during the study (6.1% 
vs 4.5%).  
A difference between the treatment groups was reported in the use of the following relevant 
concomitant medications: antidiarrhoeals, intestinal anti-inflammatory/anti-infective agents (67.3% in 
the fidaxomicin group versus 50.0% in the vancomycin group), drugs for constipation (34.7% versus 
22.7%) and mineral supplements (31.6% versus 22.7%). 
Compliance 
The total volume of liquid dosing administered for fidaxomicin (mean 88.4 g, median 96.1 g) was 
approximately half that for vancomycin (mean 177.2 g, median 186.7 g). Meanwhile the total number 
of tablets/capsules administered for fidaxomicin (mean 19.9, median 20) was approximately half that 
for vancomycin (mean 38.1, median 40). This may impact the tolerability in paediatric subjects. 
Compliance was similar between tablets/capsules and granules for oral suspension/oral liquid, with 
both treatments.  
Treatment compliance calculated as the actual amount of drug received as percentage of planned 
amount of drug was high, with a mean of 98.0% in the fidaxomicin group and 95.8% in the 
vancomycin group. A lower percentage of subjects in the fidaxomicin group had a compliance of <80% 
than in the vancomycin group (4.4% versus 12.9%), which the Applicant notes could have contributed 
to the numerically lower efficacy of vancomycin.  
The median duration of treatment was 11.0 days in both treatment groups and mean (SD) duration 
10.6 (1.0) days for fidaxomicin and 10.5 (1.1) days for vancomycin.

Table 14. Protocol deviations (SUNSHINE) 
The rate of protocol deviations in the vancomycin group was nearly double that in the fidaxomicin 
group. The nature of the protocol deviations is relevant given the imbalance between treatment groups 
and the small overall size of the study was discussed by the MAH during the procedure.

The overall rate of CCR (77.6% fidaxomicin, 70.5% vancomycin) is lower than that observed in Phase 
3 studies of fidaxomicin in adults (88% pooled fidaxomicin subjects, 86% pooled vancomycin subjects, 
mITT population) and also lower than the rate of clinical response at EOT observed in OPT-80-206 
(92%).  
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (CCR) using the ITT population was consistent with primary 
analysis: 76.0% vs 64.6%, adjusted difference 11.3% (95% CI: -4.0%, 27.3%). 
Sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (CCR) excluding 2 subjects (both fidaxomicin) 
from site 10014, following early termination of the study at the site due to procedural non-compliance, 
was also consistent with primary analysis.   
A numerically lower CCR rate was observed for fidaxomicin in the <2 years age group (65.0% vs 
90.0%), but small sub-group size makes this difficult to interpret.  The Applicant states that efficacy of 
fidaxomicin may have been impacted by the deaths of 3 subjects in this treatment group due to 
complications of prior disease. However, 2 subjects in the vancomycin group also died due to 
complications of prior disease. Furthermore, all deaths reported in the study occurred during the 
follow-up period, after CCR had already been determined.

Numerically lower initial clinical response and global cure rates were observed with fidaxomicin in the 
<2 years age group vs other age groups. However, the rate of SCR was comparable across age sub-
groups and consistently higher for fidaxomicin than vancomycin, indicating that subjects with 
successful CCR from fidaxomicin at EOT + 2 days tended to remain clinically cured rather than 
experience recurrence, regardless of age group. Note that the denominator used for SCR is the sub-
group of subjects who demonstrated positive CCR (this differs from OPT-80-206). 
The overall recurrence rate amongst fidaxomicin subjects (11.8%) was comparable to that observed in 
Phase 3 studies of fidaxomicin in adults (14% pooled fidaxomicin subjects, mITT population), while the 
recurrence rate amongst vancomycin subjects was higher than for fidaxomicin subjects (29%), which 
is also consistent with that observed in adults (26% pooled vancomycin subjects, mITT population). 
Most recurrences on vancomycin (7/9) had occurred by EOT + 9 days, whereas recurrences on 
fidaxomicin occurred at a more stable rate during three weeks after EOT. All reported recurrences in 
both treatment groups had occurred by EOT + 23 days. This pattern reflects what was observed in the 
adult clinical programme, where the effect of fidaxomicin on recurrence rates was most pronounced in 
the initial two weeks after completing therapy.  
Microbiology 
While 69% of fidaxomicin and 79.5% of vancomycin subjects were confirmed positive for C. difficile on 
Screening culture, just 1.2% and 6.1%, respectively, remained positive at EOT. Interestingly, only 
33.3% of clinical recurrences on fidaxomicin and 50% on vancomycin were positive again for C. difficile 
on culture at the time of recurrence. 
Fidaxomicin MIC90 for C. difficile was ≤0.25 µg/mL for Screening, EOT and Recurrence isolates. The 
geometric mean fidaxomicin MIC was 0.1 µg/mL for recurrences. This suggests that recurrence was 
not due to lack of susceptibility to fidaxomicin.  
Palatability  
For FAS subjects receiving fidaxomicin granules for oral suspension (n=67), the palatability was 
assessed as "good" in 19/55 (34.5%) subjects and "excellent" in 13/55 (23.6%) subjects on day 1 and 
as "good" in 21/52 (40.4%) subjects and "excellent" in 16/52 (30.8%) subjects on day 7. These 
results were numerically slightly better than for FAS subjects receiving vancomycin oral liquid at both 
time points (28% and 16% Day 1, 36% and 12% Day 7). Assessments were missing for fidaxomicin in 
12/67 (18%) and 15/67 (22%) at Day 1 and 7, respectively, and for vancomycin in 5/30 (17%) at 
both timepoints.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The paediatric clinical studies were designed in accordance with the agreed Paediatric Investigation 
Plan. Although not powered for statistical testing, the objectives, definitions (disease, cure, failure, 
recurrence), inclusion and exclusion criteria, comparator (for SUNSHINE) and clinical endpoints 
generally reflected those applied in the adult clinical development programme. The clinical data 
generated is therefore intended to support extrapolation of the previously established positive B/R 
balance for fidaxomicin tablets in adults. 
OPT-80-206 enrolled paediatric subjects in N. America, while SUNSHINE was representative of 
paediatric subjects from both Europe and N. America. 
As for the adult clinical programme, subjects with life-threatening disease and requiring surgery were 
not enrolled in the paediatric studies, and this is already reflected in the SmPC, which states that, due 
to limited clinical data, fidaxomicin should be used with caution in subjects with pseudomembranous 
colitis, fulminant or life-threatening CDI. 
Subjects in the paediatric studies tended to have mild CDAD, whereas approximately one-third of 
subjects in the adult clinical programme had moderate disease, and one-third severe disease.  
In SUNSHINE, in the 3 months prior to screening, 27% of subjects had had prior diarrhoea episodes 
with confirmed CDAD. Multiple previous CDAD recurrences in the previous 3 months were reported in 
some subjects; 2 previous episodes in around 5% of subjects and ≥3 previous episodes in around 2% 
of subjects (similar between treatment groups). The Applicant states that over half of the OPT-80-206 
study population also had prior episodes of documented C. difficile infection in their medical history, 
but this could not be confirmed from tabulated data in the CSR. The Applicant has clarified that in most 
cases the number of individual prior CDI episodes cannot be counted, since recurrent CDI was most 
frequently captured as “recurrent CDI” over the duration of the recurrent episodes, without individual 
episodes listed.  
While prior use of vancomycin or metronidazole was permitted in OPT-80-206, in SUNSHINE (as in the 
adult clinical studies) this was limited to no more than 1 days’ prior therapy. Detection of C. difficile A 
or B toxin was required within 48 hours of randomisation for OPT-80-206, as for the adult clinical 
programme, but 72 hours for SUNSHINE. Two subjects in OPT-80-206 received a single dose of 
metronidazole day one of the study treatment period most likely prior to the start of study drug. Two 
subjects received intravenous vancomycin which is not considered effective against CDI, one subject 
for a single day (day 12) and one subject for approximately 4 days, prior and concomitant to study 
medication. The administration of metronidazole and vancomycin in these subjects did likely not have 
an impact on the outcome of the CDI episodes. 
The paediatric studies used different formulations. OPT-80-206 used a powder for oral suspension, 
which was then further improved to produce the to-be-marketed granules for oral suspension used in 
SUNSHINE. While in OPT-80-206 the amount of oral suspension was calculated based directly on the 
subject’s weight (32 mg/kg/d, max 400 mg/d) at enrolment, in SUNSHINE an amount in whole mL was 
determined by the weight bracket an enrolment (delivering in practice between 20 and 32 mg/kg/d to 
those receiving less than adult dose). Furthermore, an amendment to OPT-80-206 allowed subjects 
who could not tolerate tablets to receive a crushed tablet if the oral suspension “was not available”. 
The study population for OPT-80-206 was slightly older (mean and median age 8 years) than the 
SUNSHINE study population (median age 5 years, mean age 6.7 years). Subjects were stratified by 
age in both studies. OPT-80-206 enrolled subjects 6 months and older. Although SUNSHINE was in 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation

principle open to the entire paediatric population from birth, only 1 subject <6 months of age were 
actually enrolled in the entire paediatric programme (SUNSHINE study, fidaxomicin group, enrolled in 
Italy). Across both studies, no subject was enrolled in the lowest weight category of the proposed 
paediatric dosing regimen.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The key efficacy endpoints for this application are initial/ confirmed clinical response and recurrence. 
The clinical response rate to fidaxomicin was high in both paediatric studies. The point estimates for 
rates of CCR and recurrence, as well as other secondary efficacy endpoints, were comparable between 
fidaxomicin and vancomycin groups in SUNSHINE, albeit with wide confidence intervals as expected for 
this small sized study, which was not powered for statistically testing. 
The rate of clinical response at EOT was higher for fidaxomicin in OPT-80-206 (92%) than the rate of 
CCR at EOT + 2 days in SUNSHINE (77.6% fidaxomicin, 70.5% vancomycin). For comparison, the rate 
of CCR observed in Phase 3 studies of fidaxomicin in adults was 88% for pooled fidaxomicin subjects 
and 86% for pooled vancomycin subjects (mITT population).  
Numerically lower response rates were observed in the ≥2 to <6 years age group in OPT-80-206, and 
in the <2 years age group in SUNSHINE, but small sub-groups make these findings difficult to 
interpret. When the studies are compared, no clear efficacy trends can be observed across age groups. 
The overall recurrence rate for fidaxomicin in OPT-80-206 (28.6%) was consistent across the age sub-
groups and is higher than that observed for fidaxomicin in SUNSHINE (11.8%), and also higher that 
that observed in Phase 3 studies of fidaxomicin in adults (14% pooled fidaxomicin subjects, mITT 
population). Meanwhile, the recurrence rate amongst vancomycin subjects (29%) in SUNSHINE was 
consistent with that observed in adult studies (26% pooled vancomycin subjects, mITT population). As 
seen in adult studies, recurrence rate on fidaxomicin was approximately stable throughout the four 
weeks following EOT in both OPT-80-206 and SUNSHINE, while vancomycin recurrences tended to 
occur within the first two weeks.  
The differences between rates observed across the paediatric and adult studies may reflect differences 
between the study populations in terms of patient characteristics including immune response, 
geographic distribution, difficulty diagnosing CDAD in paediatric subjects, the nature and severity of 
subjects’ underlying conditions, and the burden and contribution of other GI pathogens. Furthermore, 
subjects with multiple occurrences of CDI (defined as more than 1 prior occurrence within the past 3 
months and known to be a risk factor for recurrence following successful initial treatment) were 
excluded from the adult clinical studies, but not from the paediatric studies. 
Microbiology data obtained from the paediatric studies is consistent with that observed in the adult 
clinical programme and the established wild-type MIC distribution for C. difficile. There does not appear 
to be a relationship between MIC and clinical outcome. 
The palatability of fidaxomicin appears to be acceptable on the basis of the presented data. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The paediatric clinical programme is not independently powered to demonstrate efficacy in CDAD 
across the paediatric population from birth to <18 years, but instead is designed to support 
extrapolation of the previously established positive benefit-risk balance for fidaxomicin tablets in 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/4852/2020 
Page 53/73 
 
  
  
 
 
adults. The overall results support, at least descriptively, both cure and recurrence rates with 
fidaxomicin that are comparable to those achieved with an authorised comparator, vancomycin, and 
comparable to those seen in adult studies. 
The CHMP concluded that studies provided sufficient efficacy support for an extended indication, for 
use of Dificlir in paediatric patients, indicated for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections 
(CDI).   
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety of fidaxomicin tablets and granules for oral suspension in the paediatric population is 
supported by safety data from the two paediatric clinical studies described in detail. Overall, the 
paediatric clinical programme treated 136 paediatric subjects with CDAD with fidaxomicin, and 44 
paediatric subjects with CDAD with vancomycin.  
Patient exposure 
In OPT-80-206, the safety analysis set comprised all 38 subjects enrolled in the study (including 
2 subjects who did not receive any dose fidaxomicin).  In SUNSHINE, the safety analysis set comprised 
98 subjects in the fidaxomicin group and 44 subjects in the vancomycin group.  
The follow-up period was 28 days in Study OPT 80 206 and 30 days in SUNSHINE. Long term data are 
not available. 
The two studies used different formulations (powder vs granules) for the oral suspension, therefore the 
data are not fully integrated, but are presented side-by-side where possible to enable comparison.

Adverse events 
Treatment-emergent adverse events 
The treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in OPT-80-206 were coded according to the 
MedDRA Version 15.0 and in SUNSHINE according to Version 17.0. 
At least one TEAE was reported for >70% of subjects in all treatment groups (fidaxomicin in 
OPT-80-206, fidaxomicin in SUNSHINE and vancomycin in SUNSHINE). The proportion of subjects 
experiencing a TEAE was not considerably different between age sub-groups.

Numerical differences in the incidence of PTs between the treatment groups in SUNSHINE must be 
interpreted with caution given the small sample size.  
The TEAEs most frequently reported across the paediatric studies were pyrexia and vomiting. These 
overlap with the most frequent PTs in the pooled adult analysis (nausea, hypokalaemia, vomiting, 
abdominal pain and headache), and are consistent with signs and symptoms of the underlying disease.

Severity of TEAEs 
The majority of TEAEs were mild (44.7% of subjects, 76/102 events) or moderate (21.1% of subjects, 
20/102 events) in severity.  
Only 3 subjects (7.9%) in OPT-80-206 experienced severe TEAEs: 1 subject each in the 6 to 23 
months, 2 years to <6 years, and the 12 years to <18 years age groups. The rate of severe TEAEs was 
similar between fidaxomicin and vancomycin in SUNSHINE. 
The incidences of severe AEs were similar with Fidaxomicin and control, and the events not likely ADRs 
of the study product, but are linked to severe background disease and co-medicines for these diseases.  
Drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events 
A drug-related TEAE was defined as a TEAE considered by the investigator to be definitely or possibly 
related to fidaxomicin in OPT-80-206 and probably or possibly related to fidaxomicin or vancomycin in 
SUNSHINE.  
Overall, 13.2% of subjects (14/102 events) had TEAEs considered possibly related to study medication 
and only 1 subject (2.6%) (2 years to <6 years age group) had a TEAE considered definitely related to 
study medication.

Table 26. Treatment-emergent Adverse Events of Special Interest, 
Safety Analysis Set (SUNSHINE) 
One subject (3400210008) in the fidaxomicin group experienced a TEAE of anaphylactic reaction. The 
serious TEAE was reported to start on day 28 and resolved on the following day. In the investigator's 
opinion, the event was assessed as not related to study drug. 
A trend for low WBC, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, were more prevalent in the fidaxomicin group 
in the phase 3 study and this was discussed during the procedure. While lymphopenia was slightly 
more common with fidaxomicin than with control (25.3% vs. 20.5%), the opposite was in fact true for 
low values of leukocytes and neutrophils. Of note, the fidaxomicin arm had a higher incidence of pre-
existing blood and lymphatic system disorders (40.8% versus 29.5% respectively) and more 
fidaxomicin subjects anti-neoplastic/immunomodulating agents (43.9% vs. 36.4%, respectively). 
Further, there are no pre-clinical data to support a negative impact on lymphocytes or other 
haematology, even at very high exposures and the systemic exposure in the both adults and children 
is rather minimal. In summary, lymphopenia is not considered an ADR of fidaxomicin. 
ALT increases were numerically more common in the fidaxomicin group, where ALT increase is listed as 
an ADR in section 4.8 on the basis of prior studies in adults.  The issue of ALT increase and causality 
was discussed during the procedure, re-addressing the findings in adults and those reported in the 
paediatric studies.  Also, in the adult studies, ALT increases were only numerically different from that 
seen with control. As mentioned, the frequency of severe background disease and associated co-
medicines (with great potential for ALT increases) were not balanced between fidaxomicin arms and 
control, favouring control in both the adult and paediatric studies. When looking at ALT increases in 
shift table analysis, there was no relevant difference in ALT increases by treatment arm, Table below. 
For cases of clinically significant ALT values reported in the SUNSHINE study (n=8 for fidaxomicin, 3 
for vancomycin), there was 1 single case (2 events) reported as related to fidaxomicin by the 
investigator. That conclusion was not supported by the applicant and is not supported by the 
Rapporteur either.  The two events occurred in an 11-year old girl undergoing heavy chemotherapy for 
a medulloblastoma, where the second event (more pronounced) occurred some 10 days after end of 
fidaxomicin treatment.

In summary, when re-addressing ALT increases as a potential ADR of fidaxomicin, it is very clear that 
the evidence for causality is very weak. Of note, non-clinical studies indicated no effect on liver 
function, even at very high oral doses (9600 mg) delivered to dogs for 3 months. Further, the systemic 
exposure in humans treated with the approved dose is minimal. The CHMP therefore suggests that ALT 
increases should no longer be considered an ADR of fidaxomycin. 
Three (3.1%) subjects in the fidaxomicin group experienced acute renal failure of moderate intensity 
(SAE in 2 of those subjects), and 1 (2.3%) subject in the vancomycin group developed renal failure of 
severe intensity, an SAE. None of the renal events observed in 6 subjects were assessed as related to 
study drug. 
One SAE of moderate rectal haemorrhage was reported on day 11 in a subject in the fidaxomicin group 
and was not considered to be drug-related. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
At least one serious TEAE was reported in approximately 25% of subjects in all treatment groups 
(fidaxomicin in OPT-80-206, fidaxomicin in SUNSHINE and vancomycin in SUNSHINE). None of the 
SAEs reported in the paediatric studies were known adverse drug reactions of fidaxomicin based on 
adult data. According to the investigator, none of the serious TEAEs were related to study drug.

Most of the SAEs were in the SOC Infections and infestations, which is not unexpected given the 
underlying comorbidities in the study population. Three of the 9 SAEs reported in OPT-80-206, and two 
of the 59 SAEs reported in SUNSHINE, relate to persistence or recurrence of CDAD despite study drug 
treatment, which were considered not drug-related by the Investigator but may represent failure of the 
treatment.  
Deaths 
One subject died in OPT-80-206 and 5 subjects in SUNSHINE (3 allocated to fidaxomicin, 2 allocated to 
Vancomycin), all during the follow up period (non-related).  The 3 deaths in the children treated with 
fidaxomicin (all < 2 years of age) concerned Klebsiella sepsis following stem cell transplant, worsening 
of AML and suspected metabolic encephalopathy (Leigh Syndrome).  All 3 had fulfilled the 10 days 
treatment with fidaxomicin.

Laboratory findings 
OPT-80-206 
Few subjects shifted from normal baseline values to abnormal values for any haematology, chemistry 
or urinalysis parameters over the course of the study. TEAEs related to the isolated abnormalities were 
reported for 1 subject each (total 11). 
TEAEs of increased blood pressure and tachycardia were reported for 1 subject each; 1 subject had a 
TEAE of increased body temperature, 2 subjects had hypertension, and 4 subjects experienced TEAEs 
of pyrexia. 
No relevant changes in urinalysis results were reported in OPT 80 206. 
Three subjects had a change in QTcB interval from baseline of >30 msec. Two subjects had a QTcB 
interval >450 msec at the end of therapy. None of the subjects had QTcB intervals that met the higher 
thresholds, and none of the changes were recorded as AEs. 
SUNSHINE 
Haematology 
Slight decreases in mean neutrophils from baseline to EOT in both groups were noted, likely consistent 
with a positive response to CDAD treatment. None of the changes from baseline to EOT in both studies 
and the differences between fidaxomicin and vancomycin in SUNSHINE were considered clinically 
relevant in this population, many subjects had a medical history of neoplasms and were being treated 
with antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents during the study.

ALT increases are discussed in section 3.3.8.2 (Adverse events events).   
Vital Signs 
There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs from baseline to EOT in either study and there 
were no relevant differences between fidaxomicin and vancomycin in SUNSHINE. 
Urinalysis 
The proportion of subjects in the fidaxomicin group who tested positive for occult blood increased from 
11.8% to 13.2%, for urine glucose from 1.2% to 3.9% and for urine protein from 8.2% to 11.7%. In 
the vancomycin group, there was a decrease in positive test results for occult blood from 11.4% to 
8.3% and an increase for urine protein from 8.6% to 13.9%. 
Electrocardiograms 
ECG results were assessed by the investigator as clinically significantly abnormal in 1 (1.0%) 
fidaxomicin subject during the treatment period (day 9: right ventricular hypertrophy related to organ 
failure due to Leigh syndrome).  
Prolonged QTc interval was observed in 11 subjects of the fidaxomicin group (baseline: 11.6%, day 5 
to 10: 11.8%) and 6 subjects in the vancomycin group (baseline: 14.0%, day 5 to 10: 14.3%). No QTc 
interval was above 500 ms.  None of the changes were recorded as TEAEs. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Potential drug interactions are described in the prescribing information.  No drug-drug interaction 
studies have been performed in the paediatric population. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
OPT-80-206 
Overall, 4 TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug and withdrawal from the study 
were reported in 3 (8%) subjects: drug-related moderate urticaria on day 3; mild flatulence (not 
drug-related) on day 6; and possibly drug-related mild tachycardia (100 bpm) with mild increased 
body temperature on day 2. 
SUNSHINE 
TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were reported for 2 (1.4%) subjects: 
notably moderate colitis in a subject treated with fidaxomicin and severe vomiting in a subject 
receiving vancomycin. Both TEAEs were assessed by the investigator as not related to study drug. Both 
subjects were in the age group ≥ 2 to < 6 years. 
Post marketing experience 
Ten Periodic Safety Update Reports are available.  Approximately 248,320 patient courses of therapy

26 May 2018, and approximately 1529 subjects received fidaxomicin in clinical studies sponsored by 
the Marketing Authorization Holder. 
During the reporting interval of the latest Periodic Safety Update Report (covering the period from 27 
May 2017 to 26 May 2018), warnings and special precautions for subjects with moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, inflammatory bowel disease, and pseudomembranous 
colitis were removed from the Company Core Data Sheet based on the results of completed post-
approval safety studies.  No new safety concerns or a substantial change in the identified (and 
potential) risks were identified and no significant actions related to safety were taken. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The paediatric studies were conducted in accordance with the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan. 
The safety profile in paediatric subject is based on data from 136 paediatric subjects exposed to 
fidaxomicin. Using the “Rule of 3”, only ADRs with a frequency of greater than 1 in 45.3 could be 
detected from this safety database. There are data available on the safety of a treatment duration 
greater than 10 days in paediatric subjects (mean exposure 9.6 days in OPT-80-206 and 10.6 days in 
SUNSHINE, range 1 – 12 days). Additionally, follow up in these studies was limited to 30 days after the 
end of therapy.  
Although fidaxomicin is intended for treatment only up to 10 days’ duration, some subjects experience 
recurrence of CDAD requiring further treatment, and the safety of repeated courses of fidaxomicin in 
paediatric subjects is not known. A post-marketing safety study of repeated use in adults was initially 
agreed with CHMP following the original authorisation in adults, however it was later accepted that the 
availability of published data indicating a low rate of recurrence following fidaxomicin treatment and 
the availability and use of alternative treatments made such a study unfeasible, and as such Repeated 
fidaxomicin treatment courses was removed from RMP v7 as Missing Information in 2017. It seems 
reasonable that the safety of repeated treatment courses should not differ between paediatric and 
adult subjects.  
Only subjects in SUNSHINE were exposed to the to-be-marketed granules for oral suspension 
formulation. Only one subject <6 months old (fidaxomicin group, SUNSHINE), and no subject in the 
lowest bodyweight category of the paediatric dosing regimen proposed in the SmPC for the granules 
for suspension, were included in the paediatric clinical programme.  
Neither OPT-80-206 nor SUNSHINE explicitly excluded subjects with renal or hepatic dysfunction at 
screening, or multiple recurrences of CDAD in the previous 3 months, as the adult Phase 3 studies did. 
The currently authorised SmPC includes warnings in section 4.4 regarding the lack of data in such 
subjects.  
Fidaxomicin was generally well tolerated by paediatric subjects, in line with the low systemic exposure 
of this orally administered drug. The safety profile was generally similar between the fidaxomicin and 
vancomycin groups in SUNSHINE, and the most commonly reported TEAEs reflect the underlying 
disease. The TEAEs most frequently reported across the paediatric studies were pyrexia (10.5% OPT-
80-206, 13.3% SUNSHINE) and vomiting (10.5% OPT-80-206, 7.1% SUNSHINE). The only 
drug-related TEAEs by PT reported for ≥3 subjects across all the treatment groups were constipation 
and vomiting.  
No clear patterns are seen when comparing overall TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs or AESIs between the 
different age categories in OPT-80-206 and SUNSHINE. All deaths occurred in the <24 months age 
category and, correspondingly, there were also slightly more SAEs in this category. Deaths, un-related

to study treatment in all cases, occurred during follow-up, in children with other severe disease 
conditions. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The data generated are reassuring. The paediatric clinical programme is not extensive enough to 
provide a complete safety dataset for the paediatric population from birth to <18 years, but instead is 
designed to support extrapolation of the previously established positive BR balance for fidaxomicin 
tablets in adults. This is fully in line with the CHMP Guidance for Industry, where it is stated that both 
efficacy and safety may be based on study results obtained in adults, provided similar exposure. In the 
case of fidaxomicin, the systemic exposure is minimal in both adults and children, side effects linked to 
systemic exposure are in fact very unlikely. Using the same dose in children as in adults, which is the 
case here, would likely yield a higher local intestinal exposure and there is no reason to expect a lower 
efficacy on true C. difficile infections.  The frequency and to some extent type of GI side effects, 
generated by the local exposure, may likely differ in children and adults, also with the same local 
exposure, where for example vomiting is frequently more often reported in paediatric studies. 
However, the overall GI AE profile was similar to that seen in adults, and also similar or slightly more 
favourable than with control (Vancomycin) in the phase 3 study.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
C. difficile is a spore-forming, anaerobic, gram-positive rod that produces toxins that cause 
inflammation of the colon with severe diarrhoea and, in the most serious cases, pseudomembranous 
colitis, toxic megacolon, perforations of the colon, sepsis and even death. 
CDAD is caused by an overgrowth of C. difficile in the colon and is the leading cause of infectious 
nosocomial diarrhoea in industrialized countries.  The disease accounts for approximately 20% of cases 
of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, and for the majority of cases of antibiotic-associated 
pseudomembranous colitis (Blanckaert et al, 2008; Calfee, 2008; Monaghan et al, 2008; Mylonakis et 
al, 2001).  Antibiotics commonly linked to CDAD include cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, 
ampicillin, and amoxicillin, but almost any antibiotic can cause CDAD.   In addition to antibiotics, a 
number of other risk factors have been identified for CDAD in the paediatric population, including solid 
organ transplant, gastrostomy tube placement, chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease/motility 
disorders, cystic fibrosis, immunosuppression and previous C. difficile infection (Cooperstock, 2013; 
Sandora et al, 2011). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Oral vancomycin and metronidazole are both approved for the treatment of CDAD in adult and 
paediatric patients in the EU by oral administration. Both are available in liquid formulations. Orally 
administered metronidazole is almost completely absorbed, and systemic exposure is associated with 
adverse effects. Meanwhile, there is growing concern over emerging resistance to vancomycin among 
other important target pathogens, such as MRSA, with increasing clinical use. 
CDAD has historically been considered a disease of adults, and not a significant problem amongst the 
paediatric population. A clear link between carriage of the organism and development of symptoms has 
not been established. The definitive diagnosis of CDAD in paediatric patients, in particular young 
children and infants who are more likely to carry the organism without symptoms, may also be 
complicated by physiological differences in normal stool habit and a high frequency of diarrheal

illnesses caused by other pathogens, e.g. rotavirus, which can be incorrectly attributed to C. difficile 
infection. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is supported by data from two paediatric studies agreed as part of the Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (P/0062/2018). 
Study OPT-80-206 was an open-label, single-arm, Phase 2 study of 10 days’ 32 mg/kg/d oral 
fidaxomicin tablets or powder for oral suspension (not the final formulation) in paediatric subjects 
(n=38) in N. America from 6 months to <18 years old with CDAD. 
Study 2819-CL-0202 (SUNSHINE) was a randomised, single-blind, active-comparator controlled Phase 
3 study of 10 days’ weight-based oral fidaxomicin tablets or granules for oral suspension (the final 
formulation) in paediatric subjects (n=148) in N. America and Europe from birth to <18 years old with 
CDAD. 
Although not powered for statistical testing, the objectives, definitions (disease, cure, failure, 
recurrence), inclusion and exclusion criteria, comparator (for SUNSHINE) and clinical endpoints 
generally reflected those applied in the adult clinical development programme.  
Subjects in the paediatric studies tended to have mild CDAD, and subjects with life-threatening disease 
and requiring surgery were excluded. Unlike in the adult clinical programme, subjects with multiple 
recurrences of CDAD in the previous 3 months could enrol. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary efficacy endpoint, the rate of CCR at EOT + 2 days, in SUNSHINE was comparable 
between treatment arms (77.6% fidaxomicin, 70.5% vancomycin, adjusted difference = 7.5, 95%CI [-
7.4 to 23.9]). For comparison, the rate of CCR observed in Phase 3 studies of fidaxomicin in adults was 
88% for pooled fidaxomicin subjects and 86% for pooled vancomycin subjects (mITT population). The 
rate of clinical response at EOT was higher in OPT-80-206 (92%, 95%CI 83.5 to 100). 
The recurrence rate for the fidaxomicin group in SUNSHINE was lower than that for the vancomycin 
group (11.8% vs 29%, adjusted difference -15.8, 95%CI -34.5, 0.5), and this was comparable to 
Phase 3 studies of fidaxomicin in adults (14% pooled fidaxomicin subjects, 26% pooled vancomycin 
subjects, mITT population). The recurrence rate for fidaxomicin was higher in OPT-80-206 (28.6%, 
95%CI 13.6 to 43.5). As seen in adult studies, recurrence rate on fidaxomicin was approximately 
stable throughout the four weeks following EOT in both OPT-80-206 and SUNSHINE, while vancomycin 
recurrences tended to occur within the first two weeks.  
Microbiology data obtained from the paediatric studies is consistent with that observed in the adult 
clinical programme and the established wild-type MIC distribution for C. difficile. There does not appear 
to be a relationship between MIC and clinical outcome. 
The palatability of fidaxomicin appears to be acceptable in the paediatric population and compliance 
was generally high across all the formulations.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Only SUNSHINE used the final, to-be-marketed formulation. 
The confidence intervals for the point estimates of the key efficacy endpoints are wide in both studies, 
as is to be expected given the small study sizes. 
Numerically lower response rates were observed in the ≥2 to <6 years age group in OPT-80-206, and 
in the <2 years age group in SUNSHINE, but small sub-groups make these findings difficult to 
interpret. When the studies are compared, no clear efficacy trends can be observed across age groups. 
The numerical differences between rates observed across the paediatric and adult studies may reflect 
differences between the study populations in terms of patient characteristics including immune 
response, geographic distribution, difficulty diagnosing CDAD in paediatric subjects, the nature and 
severity of subjects’ underlying conditions, and the burden and contribution of other GI pathogens. 
Furthermore, subjects with multiple occurrences of CDI (defined as more than 1 prior occurrence 
within the past 3 months and known to be a risk factor for recurrence following successful initial 
treatment) were excluded from the adult clinical studies, but not from the paediatric studies.  
Difficulty in definitively diagnosing CDAD in the paediatric population means it is likely these studies 
enrolled a less homogenous target population than the adult clinical programme. A substantial 
proportion of subjects (43.9% fidaxomicin, 50% vancomycin) tested positive at Screening for GI 
organisms other than C. difficile. The toxins detected in the study population were a mix of bacterial 
and viral, and several subjects had more than 1 pathogen. It is likely that a proportion of enrolled 
subjects were treated for diarrhoea incorrectly attributed to C. difficile. The qualifying diagnosis cannot 
be confirmed as correct on the basis of successful clinical cure, as many of these other causes of 
diarrheal illness spontaneously resolve within the same time frame as the study treatment. However, 
this is considered to be representative of the “real life” population expected to be treated with 
fidaxomicin.  
Due to the nature of fidaxomicin, an antibiotic with very little systemic absorption intended to act 
locally in the gastrointestinal lumen; it is not possible to provide PK/PD support for efficacy of the 
proposed dose in the usual way. The faecal PK parameters appear somewhat higher for children 
compared to adults although with high inter-subject variability. The down scaling of dose is based on 
that approved for vancomycin, also an antibiotic with next to none systemic uptake; the approach is 
considered reasonable.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile was generally similar between the fidaxomicin and vancomycin groups in SUNSHINE, 
and the most commonly reported TEAEs reflect the underlying disease. The TEAEs most frequently 
reported across the paediatric studies were pyrexia (10.5% OPT-80-206, 13.3% SUNSHINE) and 
vomiting (10.5% OPT-80-206, 7.1% SUNSHINE). The only drug-related TEAEs by PT reported for 
≥3 subjects across all the treatment groups were constipation and vomiting. 
The majority of TEAEs were mild (44.7% of subjects, 76/102 events) or moderate (21.1% of subjects, 
20/102 events) in severity. 
At least one serious TEAE was reported in approximately 25% of subjects in all treatment groups 
(fidaxomicin in OPT 80 206, fidaxomicin in SUNSHINE and vancomycin in SUNSHINE). According to the 
investigator, none of the serious TEAEs were related to study drug. Most of the SAEs were in the SOC 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/4852/2020 
Page 69/73 
 
  
  
 
Infections and infestations, which is not unexpected given the underlying comorbidities in the study 
population. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety profile in paediatric subject is based on data from 136 paediatric subjects exposed to 
fidaxomicin. Using the “Rule of 3”, only ADRs with a frequency of greater than 1 in 45.3 could be 
detected from this safety database. However, there are data available on the safety of a treatment 
duration greater than 10 days in paediatric subjects. Additionally, follow up in these studies was 
limited to 30 days after the end of therapy.  
Only 1 subject <6 months of age (SUNSHINE study, fidaxomicin group), and no subject in the lowest 
weight category of the proposed paediatric dosing regimen, were enrolled in the entire paediatric 
programme. Of note, CDAD is a very infrequent disease in the youngest. 
Trends in decreased haematological parameters and increased hepatic parameters, although not 
dramatic, mirror those seen in the adult development programme. In both the adult and paediatric 
studies, alternative aetiologies related to background disease and concomitant medications are 
deemed a more likely cause of these effects, which are not considered to be ADRs.  
Systemic exposure is relevant to the assessment of clinical safety. There are very limited 
pharmacokinetic data available for the paediatric population. No modelling of plasma concentrations to 
obtain PK parameters (maximum plasma drug concentration, area under the time-concentration curve, 
etc) was planned for either study.  Only limited data on systemic exposures from the paediatric 
patients can be compared to levels obtained in adults (i.e. where drug levels were tested within the 
same time frames from intake).  The exposures are similar or lower, with a couple of outliers. When 
discussing these uncertainties of systemic exposures (outliers included) one should notice that pre-
clinical toxicology studies were in practice free from any findings (rats, dogs, monkeys); that includes 
14 days studies in beagle dogs, where the exposures were fairly extreme. Hence, in fact there is no 
safety margin to discuss, but rather exposure margins (to no findings). It should also be remembered 
that this concerns a treatment of 10 days, not chronic medication. The uncertainties are therefore 
considered acceptable and results re-assuring.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The paediatric clinical programme is not independently powered to demonstrate efficacy in CDAD 
across the paediatric population from birth to <18 years, but instead is designed to support 
extrapolation of the previously established positive BR balance for fidaxomicin tablets in adults. The 
overall results support, at least descriptively, clinically meaningful cure and recurrence rates with 
fidaxomicin, which are comparable to those achieved with an authorised comparator, vancomycin, and 
comparable to those seen in adult studies. 
The data generated are generally reassuring that fidaxomicin is well tolerated in paediatric subjects, in 
line with results in adults and similar to that seen with the control agent vancomycin, with an 
acceptable side effect profile considering the seriousness of the target condition.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy has been established in adults, where efficacy with fidaxomicin is similar to that with 
vancomycin. Results are in line with that have now been shown in paediatric patients. 
Efficacy has been established in adults, where efficacy with fidaxomicin is similar to that with 
vancomycin. Results in line with that have now been shown in paediatric patients. 
The safety of fidaxomicin in adults was shown to be favourable, in line with that of vancomycin. Again, 
with current extension application, likewise observation is made for use of Dificlir in paediatric patients. 
At present no relevant risks have been identified, apart from rash/urticaria (infrequent) which is 
common to all antibiotics. 
The favourable efficacy results outweigh the risks. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considered that the oral suspension has not been evaluated in adults and no bioequivalence 
study has been performed.  However, the absorption of fidaxomicin is minimal, and therefore the 
omission of such a study could be considered acceptable.  Hence, following discussion, CHMP 
recommended that the adult population be included in the indication of Dificlir Granules for oral 
suspension, with choice of formulation be differentiated under Posology, section 4.2. 
A statement to this effect is introduced in section 4.2 of the film-coated tablet formulation that Dificlir 
oral suspension may be an alternative for adult patients with difficulties to swallow; likewise, the same 
section of SmPC states that for paediatric patients with a body weight of less than 12.5 kg, reduced 
doses are recommended, referring to use of Dificlir 40 mg/ml granules for oral suspension.   
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of fidaxomicin in the paediatric population is positive, and a line extension (Dificlir 
granules for oral suspension 40mg /ml) can be recommended. In addition, for this formulation, the 
indication is broadened to allow use in adult population.  Further on, the extension of the existing 
indication for Tablet formulation includes the paediatric population with a body weight of at least 
12.5 kg.    
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Dificlir 40 mg/ml granules for oral suspension and of the 
already approved Dificlir presentations is favourable in the following indications: 
DIFICLIR film-coated tablets is indicated for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) 
also known as C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) in adult and paediatric patients with a body

weight of at least 12.5 kg (see section 4.2 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidelines on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
DIFICLIR granules for oral suspension is indicated for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Breast cancer is the most common form of malignancy in women, with an estimated 1.67 million new 
cases  diagnosed  in  2012  in  the  world.  Breast  cancer  ranks  as  the  fifth  cause  of  death  from  cancer 
overall (522,000 deaths worldwide, 143,000 deaths in Europe) (Globocan, 2012).  
Most breast cancers in the Western world (around 94%-95% of breast cancer patients in the US and 
Europe) are diagnosed when the cancer is still confined to the breast, with or without loco-regional 
lymph node spread (Howlader et al, 2011; Sant et al, 2003), and referred to as early breast cancer 
(EBC). At this stage, the disease is usually operable and can be treated surgically with curative intent. 
However, the disease can also be inoperable. Primary inoperable breast cancer includes locally 
advanced and inflammatory breast cancer. 
Locally  advanced  breast  cancer  (LABC)  describes  a  subset  of  invasive  breast  cancer  where  the  initial 
clinical  and  radiographic  evaluation  documents  advanced  disease  confined  to  the  breast  and  regional 
lymph nodes. LABC occurs at first presentation in about one-fifth of breast cancer patients worldwide, 
with lower incidence in countries with established screening programmes but as high as 60% in some 
other  countries  (El  Saghir  NS  et  al,  2011).  Usually,  the  definition  of  LABC  includes  large  ‘operable’ 
primary  breast  tumours  (stage  IIB,  IIIA)  and/or  those  involving  the  skin  or  chest  wall  and/or  those 
with extensive lymphadenopathies (stage IIIB, IIIC) (Macdonald SM et al., 2011). 
Inoperable LABC is a heterogeneous designation encompassing a range of clinical situations from 
neglected low-grade Estrogen Receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers to rapidly progressing usually ER-
negative disease (ESO-ESMO 2nd international consensus guidelines for advanced breast cancer 
(ABC2), 2014). A more homogenous form of LABC is inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) which has a 
distinct clinical and pathological course. IBC is a subtype characterised by erythema and oedema of a 
third or more of the skin of the breast with a palpable border, and an aggressive clinical course 
(European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Recommendations, 2013). Inflammatory 
breast cancer is always considered stage T4 disease (T4d) (Tumour-node-metastases (TNM) staging 
system). Patients with IBC have an even worse prognosis than women with LABC. Median survival for 
women with IBC at diagnosis is around 2.9 years, compared with 6.4 years for women with LABC and 
> 10 years for patients with other non-T4 breast cancers (Hance et al, 2005). Inflammatory breast 
cancers are more frequently human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive than other 
breast cancer types (Charafe-Jauffret et al, 2004; Zell et al, 2009). 
HER2 is involved in regulating cell growth, survival and differentiation (Sundaresan et al, 1999). 
Amplification and/or overexpression of HER2 occurs in around 15% to 20% of breast cancers (Wolff et 
al, 2007; Chia et al, 2008; Ross et al, 2009) and is a marker of the HER2-positive and luminal-B 
intrinsic sub-types of breast cancer (Sorlie et al, 2004). HER2 overexpression/amplification (‘HER2-
positivity’) is associated with increased tumour aggressiveness, higher rates of recurrence, and 
increased mortality (Borg et al, 1990; Ross et al, 1998; Menard et al, 2001; Brown et al, 2008; 
Curigliano et al, 2009; Ross et al, 2009).  
Surgery is the main modality of local treatment for breast cancer, and surgery and/or radiotherapy can 
control loco-regional disease in the majority of patients. Conventionally, adjuvant systemic therapy is 
given after loco-regional therapy to eradicate micrometastatic disease and reduce the chances of

distant (and local) relapse (European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Recommendations, 
2013). 
Neoadjuvant therapy is given prior to surgery and has become a treatment option for patients with 
newly diagnosed breast cancer. Although originally developed for patients with large and/or inoperable 
tumours to enable definitive surgery to be performed, neoadjuvant therapy may also be used in 
patients with operable early breast cancer to try to avoid a mastectomy and enable breast-conserving 
surgery (BCS) to take place. Neoadjuvant therapy is also the primary modality of therapy for patients 
with inflammatory breast cancer, regardless of tumour size (Dawood et al, 2011). According to the US 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines and ESMO Clinical Recommendations the 
treatment modalities (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy) used in adjuvant treatment 
may also be used pre-operatively.  
Neoadjuvant treatment of HER2 positive early breast cancer include trastuzumab which is indicated in 
combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant trastuzumab therapy, for locally 
advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter (EPAR Herceptin). 
About the product 
Pertuzumab  (Perjeta)  is  a  recombinant,  humanized,  immunoglobulin  (Ig)G1κ  monoclonal  antibody, 
which  targets  the  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2  (HER2,  also  known  as  c-erbB-2),  a 
transmembrane glycoprotein with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity.  
By  binding  to  the  subdomain  2  epitope  of  the  extracellular  domain  of  HER2,  Pertuzumab  prevents 
hetero-dimerization  of  HER2  with  other  members  of  the  HER  family  (HER1,  HER3  and  HER4).  As  a 
result,  ligand-activated  downstream  signalling  is  blocked  by  pertuzumab.  Pertuzumab  is  also  capable 
of  activating  antibody-dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity  (ADCC).  When  combined  with 
trastuzumab,  pertuzumab  provides  a  more  complete  blockade  of  the  HER  pathway  resulting  in 
augmented anti-cancer activity in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. 
Pertuzumab was authorised on 4 March 2013 in the following indication: 
Perjeta is indicated for use in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel in adult patients with HER2-
positive  metastatic  or  locally  recurrent  unresectable  breast  cancer,  who  have  not  received  previous 
anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. 
The present application is to extend the use of Perjeta for the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with 
HER2-positive breast cancer. 
The applied indication was: 
Perjeta  is  indicated  in  combination  with  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel  for  the  neoadjuvant  treatment  of 
patients  with  HER2-positive,  locally  advanced,  inflammatory,  or  early  stage  breast  cancer  (>  2  cm in 
diameter) as part of the treatment for early breast cancer. 
The recommended indication is: 
Perjeta  is  indicated  for  use  in  combination  with  trastuzumab  and  chemotherapy  for  the  neoadjuvant 
treatment  of  adult  patients  with  HER2-positive,  locally  advanced,  inflammatory,  or  early  stage breast 
cancer at high risk of recurrence (see section 5.1.).  
The recommended initial loading dose of Perjeta is 840 mg administered as a 60 minute intravenous 
infusion, followed every 3 weeks thereafter by a maintenance dose of 420 mg administered over a 
period of 30 to 60 minutes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/285991/2015 
Page 9/95 
 
 
 
 
 
When administered with Perjeta the recommended initial loading dose of trastuzumab is 8 mg/kg body 
weight administered as an intravenous infusion followed every 3 weeks thereafter by a maintenance 
dose of 6 mg/kg body weight. 
When administered with Perjeta the recommended initial dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2, administered 
thereafter on a 3 weekly schedule. The dose of docetaxel may be escalated to 100 mg/m2 on 
subsequent cycles if the initial dose is well tolerated (the docetaxel dose should not be escalated when 
used in combination with carboplatin, trastuzumab and Perjeta).  
The medicinal products should be administered sequentially and not mixed in the same infusion bag. 
Perjeta and trastuzumab can be given in any order. When the patient is receiving docetaxel, this 
should be administered after Perjeta and trastuzumab. An observation period of 30 to 60 minutes is 
recommended after each Perjeta infusion and before commencement of any subsequent infusion of 
trastuzumab or docetaxel (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Perjeta should be administered for 3 to 6 cycles in combination with neoadjuvant trastuzumab and 
chemotherapy, as part of a treatment regimen for early breast cancer. Following surgery, patients 
should be treated with adjuvant trastuzumab to complete 1 year of treatment (see SmPC sections 4.2 
and 5.1). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment was submitted for pertuzumab in accordance with the "Guideline on 
the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use" (EMEA, 2006). Proteins and 
peptides are exempted from the need to provide an environmental risk assessment, because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction

In addition to the above studies there are two additional studies ongoing: 
APHINITY (BO25126/TOC4939g/BIG-4-11): 
This is an ongoing, randomized, two-arm Phase III study of adjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy 
plus  pertuzumab  or  placebo  in  patients  with  primary  operable  breast  cancer.  Recruitment  into  the 
study  is  complete  (4805  patients)  and  the  Independent  Data  Monitoring  Committees  (IDMC)  have 
reported  no  unexpected  safety  signals  as  of  December  2013.  A  CHMP  Scientific  Advice  for  the 
APHINITY trial was sought in October 2010. The primary analysis is expected to take place in 2016 and 
final clinical study report in May 2017. 
BERENICE (WO29217): 
This is a non-randomized, open label, phase II study designed to evaluate pertuzumab in combination 
with  trastuzumab  and  two  different  neoadjuvant  anthracycline-based  chemotherapy  regimens  in 
patients  with  HER2-positive,  locally  advanced,  inflammatory  or  early  stage  breast  cancer.  The  study 
will enrol a similar patient population to that enrolled in the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies. The 
primary endpoint of the study is cardiac safety of pertuzumab in combination with two commonly used 
neoadjuvant regimens. Secondary endpoints include overall safety and pCR rate. The study is planned 
to  enrol  approximately  400  patients  (200  patients  in  each  cohort).  Safety  and  efficacy  data  from  the 
neoadjuvant period are anticipated in May 2017. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The MAH presented PK data from the NEOSPHERE study. In this study, optional biomarker sample 
repository (BSR) blood samples were collected from consented patients in order to better 
understand/predict pertuzumab/trastuzumab efficacy, dose responses, safety, 
pertuzumab/trastuzumab mode of action, progression of breast cancer, and associated diseases.  
Pertuzumab was administered as a loading dose of 840 mg intravenous (IV) followed by 420 mg IV 
q3w. Trastuzumab was administered as a loading dose of 8 mg/kg IV followed by 6 mg/kg IV q3w. 
Docetaxel was administered at an initial dose of 75 mg/m2 escalating to 100 mg/m2 q3w. During the 
entire pre- and post-surgical period, all patients received appropriate chemotherapy as per standard of 
care, as well as any surgery and/or radiotherapy as required.  
Pertuzumab serum concentrations were measured in BSR blood samples obtained on days 14-21 post-
dose of Cycles 2 and 4 (two samples per patient were planned). Samples were obtained from 139 
patients:  Arm B, n=49; Arm C, n=45; and Arm D, n=45. 
Trastuzumab serum concentrations were measured in BSR blood samples obtained on Days 14-21 
post-dose of Cycles 2 and 4. Samples were obtained from 135 patients: Arm A, n=41; Arm B, n=49; 
and Arm C, n=45. 
A new PK ELISA using a monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody against trastuzumab was developed and 
validated to measure trastuzumab in the presence of pertuzumab to enable PK evaluation for clinical 
trials in which both trastuzumab and pertuzumab are administered.

PK results collected in NEOSPHERE were compared with the prediction of previously developed 
population PK (popPK) models for pertuzumab and trastuzumab, developed with 481 and 595 patients 
respectively. The popPK model for pertuzumab was based on 12 clinical trials in patients with solid 
tumours, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. Lean body 
weight and serum albumin concentration were identified as significant covariates for pertuzumab PK in 
that model. 
No immunogenicity data (anti-therapeutic antibodies) were collected in NEOSPHERE. 
Results 
Pertuzumab 
With a loading dose of 840 mg and a 420 mg maintenance dose every 3 weeks (q3w), the steady-
state concentrations of pertuzumab were reached after the first maintenance dose. In previously 
submitted studies with the same dosage schedule pertuzumab demonstrated linear PK at a dose range 
of 2-25 mg/kg with respect to dose proportionality and time-independence. 
NEOSPHERE patients had a slightly lower median lean body weight (LBW) (44.6 kg versus 49.2 kg) 
and a higher median albumin (ALBU) (4.4 g/dL versus 3.9 g/dL) compared with the previous 
pertuzumab popPK model population but after correcting for baseline differences in weight and ALBU 
the popPK model predictions matched the observed pertuzumab serum concentrations. Pertuzumab 
Cycle 2 observed serum trough serum concentrations had a mean of 70 f.lQ/mL, and 98% (130 of 
133) of patients in Arms B, C, and D had a serum trough serum concentration >20 f.lQ/mL. For the 
model-predicted trough serum concentrations at Cycle 2, the mean was 60 f.lQ/mL and 97% (130 of 
134) of the patients had a predicted trough serum concentration >20 f.lQ/mL.  
The median CL of the NEOSPHERE patient was 0.204 L/day, which was slightly lower than the typical 
CL of 0.235 L/day estimated in the prior popPK model. 
Trastuzumab 
Patients in NEOSPHERE had a slightly lower median body weight (64 kg versus 67.5 kg) and a slightly 
lower median serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) levels (18 IU/L versus 19 IU/L) compared 
with the previous trastuzumab popPK model population.  
The trastuzumab PK results were similar across the three arms in NEOSPHERE. The modelled PK 
profiles over-predicted the observed trastuzumab serum concentrations, even after correcting for 
baseline covariates: measured trastuzumab trough concentration at Cycle 2 was 32.4% lower than the 
model-predicted value. Trastuzumab Cycle 2 observed trough serum concentrations had a mean of 34 
µg/mL, and 64% (83 of 129) of patients in Arms A, B, and C had a trough serum concentration >20 
µg/mL. For the individual model-predicted trough serum concentrations, the mean was 36 µg/mL, and 
98% (127 of 129) of the patients had a predicted trough >20 µg/mL. 
The clearance in NEOSPHERE patients was higher than the values from the popPK model, even after 
correcting for the difference in covariates. However trastuzumab CL values were similar between 
patients with or without pertuzumab (p=0.103, comparing Arms A and B) and patients with or without 
docetaxel (p= 0.160, comparing Arms B and C). 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  analysis  of  pertuzumab  PK  in  NEOSPHERE  showed  that  patients  had  lower  lean  body  weight  and 
higher  serum  albumin  concentrations  than  patients  in  the  pertuzumab  pop  PK  model,  resulting  in  a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/285991/2015

lower observed clearance in NEOSPHERE patients. After correcting for baseline differences, the pop PK 
model  represented  well  the  pertuzumab  PK  observed  in  NEOSPHERE  patients  indicating  that 
pertuzumab  PK  is  similar  between  neo-adjuvant  and  MBC  patients.  Further,  pertuzumab  PK  did  not 
appear to vary between study treatment arms, suggesting it was not affected by the presence of co-
administered trastuzumab, docetaxel, or both. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PK results presented suggested that the previous popPK pertuzumab model adequately 
described the distribution of the NEOSPHERE pertuzumab PK serum concentrations. The observed 
trough concentrations appeared similar across treatment groups. Therefore, drug-drug interactions are 
not expected between pertuzumab and trastuzumab or between pertuzumab and docetaxel. The PK 
results of pertuzumab in the NEOSPHERE study are consistent with the predictions from the previous 
population PK model (see SmPC section 5.2). 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No formal dose-response studies were conducted for this indication, which was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP. The proposed dose of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting is the same as the dose 
used in the metastatic setting. 
2.4.2.  Main studies

Treatments 
Study treatment in this study was defined as neoadjuvant (pre-operative) and adjuvant (post-
operative surgery) treatment. Throughout the study, the investigational medicinal products were 
pertuzumab and trastuzumab; docetaxel, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide were 
administered in accordance with their Summary of Product Characteristics and/or standard practice 
and are therefore not regarded as Investigational Medicinal Products. 
Figure 1: Overall study design 
Neoadjuvant (Pre-Operative) Treatment 
Study treatment was administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, as follows, prior to breast surgery: 
• Arm A: Trastuzumab IV + docetaxel IV (T+D) 
A loading dose of 8 mg/kg of trastuzumab was required on Day 1, Cycle 1, and a maintenance dose of 
6 mg/kg thereafter. The starting dose for docetaxel was 75 mg/m2 for Cycle 1 then 100 mg/m2 for 
Cycles 2-4, if no dose limiting toxicity occurred. 
• Arm B: Trastuzumab IV + pertuzumab IV + docetaxel IV (Ptz+T+D) 
A loading dose of 8 mg/kg of trastuzumab and 840 mg of pertuzumab was required on Day 1 Cycle 1; 
thereafter, maintenance doses of 6 mg/kg and 420 mg, respectively, were required from Cycle 2 
onward. The starting dose for docetaxel was 75 mg/m2 for Cycle 1, then 100 mg/m2 for Cycles 2−4, if 
no dose-limiting toxicity occurred. 
• Arm C: Trastuzumab IV + pertuzumab IV (Ptz+T) 
Assessment report

A loading dose of 8 mg/kg of trastuzumab and 840 mg pertuzumab was required on Day 1 Cycle 1; 
thereafter, a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg and 420 mg, respectively, were required from Cycle 2 
onward. 
• Arm D: Pertuzumab IV + docetaxel IV (Ptz+D) 
A loading dose of 840 mg of pertuzumab was required on Day 1 Cycle 1; thereafter, a maintenance 
dose of 420 mg was required from Cycle 2 onward. The starting dose for docetaxel was 75 mg/m2 for 
Cycle 1, then 100 mg/m2 for Cycles 2-4, if no dose-limiting toxicity occurred. 
Adjuvant (Post-Operative) Treatment 
• Arms A, B, and D: 
Patients in Arms A, B, and D received trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV followed by FEC (5-fluorouracil 600 
mg/m2 IV, epirubicin 90 mg/m2 IV, then cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV) on Day 1 and every 3 
weeks thereafter for three cycles (i.e., Cycles 5 − 7), with each cycle lasting 21 days. Cycle 5 
administration was not to occur until 2 weeks after surgery. Thereafter, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV was 
to be given every 3 weeks from Cycle 8 continuing until Cycle 17 for patients in Arms A and B and until 
Cycle 21 for patients in Arm D. 
• Arm C: 
Patients in Arm C received trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV followed by docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV for Cycle 5. 
From Cycle 6, docetaxel was escalated to 100 mg/m2 for three cycles (i.e., Cycles 6 − 8) if no dose-
limiting toxicity occurred. For Cycles 9 to 11, patients received trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV followed by 
FEC (5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 IV, epirubicin 90 mg/m2 IV, then cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV) on 
Day 1 and every 3 weeks thereafter for three cycles (each cycle lasting 21 days). From Cycle 12 until 
Cycle 17, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV was continued.

• 
To make a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment of pertuzumab and

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: Post-surgery pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in the breast 
The primary endpoint was post-surgery pCR rate in the breast, evaluated after patients had received 4 
cycles of treatment and surgery or had withdrawn from the study, whichever occurred first.  
Definition of pCR: pCR is defined as absence of invasive neoplastic cells in the breast at microscopic 
examination of the tumor remnants after surgery following primary systemic therapy.  
Absence of residual in situ disease was not required for a pCR in these studies. This definition is 
abbreviated to bpCR (pathological complete response in the breast) and corresponds to the definition, 
ypT0/is, according to the TNM classification.  
Two other more stringent definitions of pCR are in common use: tpCR (total pCR) and GBG pCR 
(German Breast Group pCR). Differences among these definitions are reported in the Table below.

Note: The MAH justified the choice of the bpCR definition as that preferred by Michelangelo Foundation (a scientific non-profit 
organization dedicated to the advancement of cancer research and involved in EBC research) at the time of study design. However, 
in view of the uncertainty surrounding the most appropriate definition of pCR to use, and to enable cross-trial comparisons, data 
were prospectively collected in both NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA to allow assessment of pCR by all three definitions. Pathological 
complete response rates according to the tpCR and GBG pCR definitions are considered exploratory endpoints for both studies (see 
section on Comparison across trials, pCR by definition). 
The pCR rate is the proportion of the intent-to-treat (ITT) population that achieve a pCR. 
Assessment of tumour specimens by the pathologist was done according to institutional standards for 
processing and interpretation of pathologic specimens was maintained as per local practice. There was 
no centralised review of the pathology specimens.  
Secondary endpoints: 
Clinical response rate: Clinical response was defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), 
stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD). Clinical response rate was defined as the proportion 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/285991/2015

of  patients  who  achieved  a  clinical  response  (CR  or  PR)  during  Cycles  1-4  (pre-surgery).  Clinical 
response was to be assessed at each cycle, between Days 15-21 or on study Day 1 of the next cycle. 
The clinical response during neo-adjuvant period or the clinical response at the last assessment was to 
be determined based on the tumour measurements by the MAH in combination with the tumour 
response assessment (PD or No-PD) by the investigator. Tumour response was assessed using clinical 
breast examination (CBE) of the breast, axilla and supraclavicular fossa and/or mammography or other 
conventional methods prior to each cycle of therapy, as per local medical practice. CBE and 
mammography were required at baseline and after completion of Cycle 4, prior to surgery.  
Baseline  breast  tumour  assessments  measured  by  mammogram  and  CBE  were  mandatory,  but  any 
additional assessments employing conventional methods, (ultrasound, CT scan, X-rays, MRI) were also 
collected. During the neoadjuvant treatment phase and after completion of all pre-operative treatment 
cycles,  tumour  response  assessment  could  be  performed  using  any  of  the  conventional  methods, 
provided that the same techniques were used for evaluating the target lesion.  
Tumour assessments were made based upon the RECIST 1.0 criteria with some modifications that 
were required due to the study design and eCRF pages used to capture tumour assessment data. 
The best tumour response was defined separately for the primary, secondary breast lesions, all breast 
tumours, axillary nodes, ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes and for all nodes examined as being the best 
tumour response (CR>PR>SD>PD) a patient achieved during the neoadjuvant period. 
The overall best tumour response was derived, based on the best tumour response for all lesions 
(breast and nodes). 
Time to clinical response: This is defined as the time to clinical response, i.e. the time from the date of 
first dose received to the first date of assessment of clinical response. 
Breast conserving surgery (BCS) rate: This is defined as the proportion of patients with T2-T3 disease 
for whom a mastectomy was planned at study entry, and who subsequently underwent BCS. Patients 
with  inflammatory  breast  cancer  were  excluded  from  this  analysis  since  these  patients  underwent 
mastectomy irrespective of their response to neo-adjuvant treatment. 
Disease-free survival (DFS): This is defined as the time from the first date of no disease (i.e. date of 
surgery) to the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death. Evidence of contralateral in 
situ disease was not to be considered PD. 
Progression-free survival (PFS): This is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first 
documentation  of  progressive  disease  or  death  from  any  cause.  Patients  without  post-baseline 
assessments but known to be alive were censored at the time of randomization. 
Evaluation  of  biomarkers:  Tumour  samples  from  the  primary  tumour  (biopsy)  were  collected  and 
tested  in  a  central  pathology  laboratory  for  HER2  status  and  tumour  tissue  biomarkers  for 
pertuzumab/trastuzumab response prediction. 
For eligible patients, the following biomarkers, that may be predictive of response to 
pertuzumab/trastuzumab and/or prognostic for breast cancer, were assessed in tumour tissue: 
– expression of HER-family receptors or related receptor-tyrosine kinases e.g., IGF1-R, EGFR, HER2, 
HER3, assessed by qRT-PCR and/or IHC 
– HER ligands (amphiregulin and betacellulin) assessed by qRT-PCR 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/285991/2015 
Page 19/95 
 
 
 
 
 
– Markers/components of the HER signal transduction or alternative signalling pathways (pAKT and 
PTEN protein expression assessed by IHC; c-myc, gene amplification assessed by FISH, mutational 
status of PIK3CA assessed by a PCR based assay)  
Sample size 
400  patients  were  planned  to  be  randomized  into  the  study.  With  400  patients  and  an  overall  alpha 
level  of  0.2  the  study  would  have  80%  power  to  detect  an  absolute  percentage  increase  of  15% 
between each of the three primary comparisons. 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomly  assigned,  by  a  central  randomization  centre  using  dynamic  allocation  in  the 
order  in  which  they  were  enrolled,  to  Arm  A,  B,  C  or  D  and  stratified  by  operable  (T2-3,  N0-1,  M0), 
locally  advanced  (T2-3,  N2  or  N3,  M0;  T4a-c,  any  N,  M0)  and  inflammatory  (T4d,  any  N,  M0)  breast 
cancer and oestrogen and/or progesterone positivity. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label. Pathologists were not formally blinded as to treatment allocation.  
Statistical methods 
A pCR rate of 25% was expected in arm A (trastuzumab and docetaxel) and arm D (pertuzumab and 
docetaxel).  A  pCR  rate  of  40%  in  arm  B  (trastuzumab,  pertuzumab  and  docetaxel)  or  arm  C 
(trastuzumab and pertuzumab) was to be considered of clinical interest. The following three individual 
hypotheses were tested using a two-sided Cochrane Mantel-Haenszel test at an alpha level of 0.2. 
Arm A versus arm B 
• Null hypothesis: pCR A rate = pCR B rate 
• Alternative hypothesis: pCR A rate ≠ pCR B rate 
Arm A versus arm C 
• Null hypothesis: pCR A rate = pCR C rate 
• Alternative hypothesis: pCR A rate ≠ pCR C rate 
Arm D versus arm B 
• Null hypothesis: pCR D rate = pCR B rate 
• Alternative hypothesis: pCR D rate ≠ pCR B rate 
As  there  were  three  individual  comparisons  a  Simes  multiplicity  adjustment  was  applied  to  the 
individual p-values obtained at the end of the study to maintain the overall false positive risk at 0.2. 
The ITT population includes all randomized patients, regardless of whether they received any study 
medication. All efficacy outputs were produced for the ITT population. The per protocol (PP) 
population, is a subset of the ITT population. It excludes patients who were deemed to have any major 
protocol violations prior to the adjuvant phase of the study. The PP population includes patients who 
received ≥ 3 cycles (and not > 4 cycles) of their randomized study medication in the neoadjuvant 
setting. The PP analysis was to occur only if this population differs in total number of patients by ≥ 
10% of the ITT population.  
Assessment report

The safety population includes patients who received at least one dose of study medication and at least 
one safety assessment performed at baseline. Patients were assigned to treatment groups according to 
treatment actually received. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Note: Withdrawal indicates withdrawal from study treatment. Patients withdrawing from treatment could still 
undergo primary surgery and could still be ongoing in the post-treatment follow-up period. Withdrawal at any time 
up to the first adjuvant trial treatment cycle was counted as withdrawal from the neoadjuvant phase.

Recruitment 
Recruitment occurred between 17 December 2007 and 22 December 2009. All enrolled patients had 
completed treatment and were either in follow-up or had withdrawn from the study as of 15 February 
2011. Patients were recruited across 59 centres in 16 countries (Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, 
Italy, Mexico, Peru, Poland, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, 
Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol Amendments 
Version B (dated 4th December, 2007) introduced the following changes: 
•  Addition of a fourth treatment arm (arm D), in order to evaluate the efficacy of pertuzumab, in 
the absence of trastuzumab, in the neoadjuvant setting, with corresponding update of schedule 
of assessment and dosing information. There was a total of 29 patients who had been recruited 
on the original protocol prior to introduction of this arm. 
• 
Increase  in  the  number  of  patients  participating  in  the  study  from  180  to  400,  and 
corresponding increase in the number of centers, from 45-55 to 100. 
•  Amendment of efficacy endpoints, hypothesis testing and analyses to reflect addition of arm D 
and increased patient numbers. 
•  Addition of an exclusion criterion, to exclude patients with insulin-dependent diabetes from the 
study. 
•  Clarification of the offset dosing schedule. 
Version C (11th December 2008) made the following change: 
Correction  of  the  tumour-node-metastasis  (TNM)  classes  used  to  classify  patients’  disease  for  the 
stratification groups operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory cancer for this study. 
Version D (27th June 2009) made the following significant changes: 
• Updates to: the definition of post-menopausal women, the contraceptive requirements for women of 
child bearing potential in accordance with the ICH M3 guideline, and the pregnancy testing scheduling. 
• Clarification of clinical response definition. 
Protocol Deviations 
The  majority  of  protocol  deviations  reported  were  minor  and  did  not  exclude  patients  from  the  Per 
Protocol (PP) population. Across the treatment arms between 8 and 11 patients (7.5-10.3%) per arm 
reported at least one inclusion criteria violation, of which the majority was due to a positive or missing 
baseline pregnancy test result. Between 7 and 14 patients (6.5-13.1%) reported at least one exclusion 
criteria violation, the most common of which  was missing data for, or impaired liver function. Five to 
11 patients (4.7-10.3%) recorded a protocol deviation whilst on study, for various reasons. 
One  patient  had  a  pulmonary  lesion  that  was  confirmed  as  metastases,  which  violated  exclusion 
criteria. The patient was withdrawn from the study after receiving 2 cycles of treatment. Two patients 
had  missing  screening  values  and  were  reported  as  having  a  violation  of  primary  tumour  measuring 
less than 2 cm. However, both patients had cycle 1 tumour measurement values > 2 cm.

Secondary endpoints 
Clinical Response Rate 
Clinical  response  analyses  are  presented  by  assessment  modality.  The  majority  of  patients  were 
assessed  by  mammography/X-ray  or  CBE.  Since  CBE  was  assessed  at  each  neoadjuvant  cycle,  while 
mammogram/X-ray was only required to be assessed at baseline and cycle 4 as per protocol, CBE was 
deemed the most sensitive method of assessing tumour progression. 
CR rate was highest in arm B (31%) and lowest in arm C (17%) in patients where CBE was used to 
assess the primary lesion. Correspondingly SD was lowest in arm B and highest in arm C. Disease 
progression was low in all arms.

Table 6: Summary of best tumour response during neoadjuvant treatment 
The majority of patients achieved an unconfirmed clinical response (i.e., CR or PR) in the primary 
lesion, as assessed by CBE (Table 6). The highest rate was reported in arm B (88.1%), followed by 
arm A (79.8%) then arm D (71.4%), and the lowest was in arm C (67.6%).

Breast Conserving Surgery 
Just over half the patients on study were originally planned to undergo a mastectomy. The majority of 
these went on to have mastectomy and/or axilliary surgical resection; however between 18-32% 
across the treatment arms were able to have BCS (defined as quadrantectomy or lumpectomy). The 
proportion of patients achieving BCS was lowest in arm C and highest in arm D.

Evaluation of Biomarkers 
Baseline Biomarker Levels 
The levels of all biomarkers were assessed at baseline, for the overall study population as well as per 
study arm.  All biomarker baseline levels were well balanced per arm, as judged by the median level, 
with  no  notable  imbalances  between  any  of  the  four  study  arms.  The  number  of  samples  analysed 
varied  by  biomarker,  either  for  technical  reasons  or  due  to  tumour  tissue  availability  being  a  limiting 
factor (65.9% - 99.8% of patients had samples analysed across the various biomarkers). However, in 
general, the number of samples analysed per biomarker was well balanced across the arms and overall 
a high rate of sample coverage was reached for the biomarker analyses.   
PIK3CA  mutation  status  was  assessed  in  65.5%  of  the  study  patients.  Within  the  overall  PIK3CA 
biomarker  population,  32%  of  samples  were  identified  as  carrying  a  PIK3CA  mutation.  This  was  also 
balanced  across  the  treatment  arms.  For  the  betacellulin  and  amphiregulin  PCR  assays,  whilst  mRNA 
levels  were  above  the  specified  limit  of  detection,  the  quantities  detected  were  very  small  in  the 
majority  of  patients.  The  median  levels  of  betacellulin  and  amphiregulin  mRNA  across  the  treatment 
arms were very low, and were less than the limits of variability for these assays. 
Samples  from  399  patients  were  tested  for  Fc  gamma  receptor  polymorphisms.  Incidences  of  the 
phenotypes  of  interest  were  broadly  balanced  across  the  treatment  arms;  however  numbers  of 
patients with certain phenotypes were too low to allow further meaningful analyses. 
A  treatment  interaction  test  using  logistic  regression  was  carried  out  to  explore  whether  there  was  a 
relationship between biomarker levels and pCR rate. Using this test, a significant association with the 
treatment  benefit  seen  in  arm  B  compared  to  arm  A  was  observed  only  for  HER2  membrane  protein 
levels,  as  assessed by  IHC  (odds  ratio  =  3.91;  p  =  0.0236).  17  significance tests  were  performed  at 
the alpha=0.2 level, with no adjustment for multiplicity. 
Ancillary analyses 
For  the  primary  endpoint,  three  pre-specified  hypotheses  were  tested,  and  a  Simes  multiplicity 
adjustment was applied to these comparisons (of arm A versus arm B, arm A versus arm C and arm D 
versus  arm  B)  accordingly.  Since  the  pCR  rate  in  arm  D  indicated  that  pertuzumab  given  as  a  single 
antibody  with  docetaxel  has  noteworthy  activity,  an  additional  post-hoc,  exploratory  analysis  was 
carried  out,  to  test  the  difference  in  pCR  rates  between  arms  A  and  D.  This  analysis  showed  no 
statistically significant difference between the arms (p=0.3263). This comparison was not pre-specified 
and hence was not powered to allow any firm conclusions.

Figure 4: Overview of the dosing schedule 
Neoadjuvant 
Study  treatment  is  defined  as  neoadjuvant  (pre-surgery)  and  adjuvant  (post-operative  surgery) 
treatment.  The  investigational  medicinal  products  (IMPs)  were  pertuzumab  and  trastuzumab.  FEC, 
carboplatin and docetaxel were administered in accordance with their local prescribing information and 
were not regarded as IMPs. 
Trastuzumab was administered on Day 1 of Cycle 1 for patients in Arms A and C and Day 1 of Cycle 4 
for patients in Arm B. 
Pertuzumab was administered on Day 1 of Cycle 1 for Arm A and C patients and Day 1 of Cycle 4 for 
Arm B patients. 
Docetaxel  was  administered  at  75  mg/m2  as  an  IV  infusion  over  60  (±10)  minutes,  after  the 
pertuzumab  infusion  observation  period.  From  Day  22  onwards  (three  weeks  after  the  first  dose), 
docetaxel  was  escalated  in  the  subsequent  cycle(s)  to  100  mg/m2  (except  for  patients  in  the 
pertuzumab  +TCH  arm  [Arm  C]  where  there  was  no  escalation  of  the  docetaxel  dose)  if  no  limiting 
toxicity was observed. 
Neoadjuvant FEC was administered as an IV bolus or as an infusion (in accordance with local policy) on 
Day 1 of treatment in Arms A and B. FEC was given every three weeks for three cycles, as follows: 
• 5-Fluorouracil was given as a dose of at 500 mg/m2, with dose capping at 1200 mg 
• Epirubicin was given as a dose of 100 mg/m2 
• Cyclophosphamide was administered at 600 mg/m2, with dose capping at 1200 mg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/285991/2015 
Page 32/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Carboplatin was given every three weeks for six cycles to patients in Arm C. The Calvert formula was 
used to calculate the dose (given in mg, not mg/m2) of carboplatin: Dose (mg) = target AUC (mg/mL x 
min) x [GFR mL/min + 25]. Dose (mg) = 6 x [GFR mL/min + 25]. 
Adjuvant 
Adjuvant  trastuzumab  was  given  at  a  dose  of  6  mg/kg  IV,  every  three  weeks  (q3w)  from  Cycle  7 
onwards (which had to occur at least 2 weeks after surgery). If the interval between Cycle 6 Day 1 and 
Cycle  7  Day  1  was  more  than  four  weeks  a  reloading  dose  of  8  mg/kg  was  required  for  Cycle  7. 
Trastuzumab was to be continued for a maximum of one year in total (i.e., until Cycle 17 for Arms A 
and C patients and until Cycle 20 for Arm B patients). 
Additional  radiotherapy,  hormonal  therapy  and  chemotherapy  post-surgery  and  during  adjuvant 
trastuzumab  treatment  was  to  be  allowed,  if  considered  necessary  by  the  investigator.  For  those 
patients  who  received  anthracycline-based  neoadjuvant  therapy  and  who  are  deemed  by  the  
investigator  to  require  further  chemotherapy  post-surgery,  the  combination  of  cyclophosphamide, 
methotrexate  and  fluorouracil  (CMF)  was  to  be  suggested.  For  those  patients  who  have  received 
carboplatin-based  neoadjuvant  therapy  and  who  are  deemed  by  the  Investigator  to  require  further 
chemotherapy postsurgery, the regimen fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC) was to be 
suggested. 
Rationale for dosage selection 
Based  on  pharmacokinetic  and  clinical  data,  an  IV  dosing interval of  three  weeks  was  determined  for 
pertuzumab (half-life of approximately 17 days). A loading dose of 840 mg (followed by 420 mg q3w), 
was capable of attaining steady-state trough and peak concentrations by the second cycle. The half-life 
of trastuzumab is approximately 28.5 days, which supports a dosing of every three weeks.  
The  intravenous  chemotherapy  regimens  used  for  docetaxel,  FEC  and  carboplatin  are  based  on 
published  data  and  routine  clinical  usage.  Intravenous  docetaxel  was  used  at  the  starting  dose  of  75 
mg/m2  and  was  escalated  up  to  100  mg/m2  according  to  individual  tolerability.  Higher  doses  of 
epirubicin  were  shown  to  be  superior  to  lower  doses  of  epirubicin  (60  mg/m2)  in  the  treatment  of 
breast  cancer,  and  so  the  dose  of  epirubicin  used  in  this  study  was  100  mg/m2.  The  use  of  5- 
fluorouracil  (500  mg/m2  IV)  in  combination  with  an  anthracycline  (epirubicin  in  this  protocol)  and 
cyclophosphamide was considered a standard regimen. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  make  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the  tolerability  of  neoadjuvant 
treatment with one of the studied treatment regimens. The primary objective was evaluated when all 
patients had received six cycles of neoadjuvant treatment, had their surgery and all necessary samples 
taken, or withdrew from the study whichever was earlier. 
The secondary objectives were: 
• To make a preliminary assessment of the activity associated with each regimen as indicated by the 
rate  of  pathological  complete  response  (pCR;  defined  as  the  absence  of  invasive  neoplastic  cells  at 
microscopic examination of the tumor remnants after surgery, following primary systemic therapy) in 
the breast. 
• To evaluate the safety profiles of each treatment regimen, including pre-operative (neoadjuvant) and 
post-operative (adjuvant) treatment (i.e., trastuzumab). 
•  To  investigate  the  overall  survival  (OS),  the  time  to  clinical  response  (CR),  time-to-response, 
disease-free survival (DFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for each treatment arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/285991/2015

• To investigate the biomarkers that may be associated with primary and secondary efficacy endpoints 
in accordance with each treatment arm. 
•  To  investigate  the  rate  of  breast  conserving  surgery  for  all  patients  with  T2-3  tumours  for  whom 
mastectomy was planned at diagnosis. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
Cardiac safety: 
• 
Incidence of symptomatic cardiac events as assessed by the Investigator (Grade 3, 4 or 5 
symptomatic LVSD) 
•  Clinically significant LVEF declines over the course of the neoadjuvant period (LVEF decline 
of ≥10% from baseline and to a value of <50%) 
Secondary endpoints: 
pCR (key secondary endpoint): The main efficacy endpoint was pCR rate in the breast, evaluated after 
six cycles of treatment and surgery or following withdrawal from the study, whichever occurred sooner. 
pCR  was  defined  at  the  time  of  surgery  and  the  rate  is  the  proportion  of  the  ITT  population  that 
achieved a pCR. A 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated around the observed pCR rate for each 
treatment  arm in  order to  show  the  variability  associated  with the  point  estimate.  A  pCR  assessment 
was considered invalid if response to ‘Microscopic assessment of primary tumor’ is related to invasive 
carcinoma only (i.e., 'Associated with invasive carcinoma' or 'Distant from invasive carcinoma' ticked). 
Clinical  response  rate:  Tumour  response  was  defined  as  complete  response  (CR),  partial  response 
(PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) and was identified as per local practice. Clinical 
response  rate  was  defined  as  the  proportion  of  patients  who  achieve  a  response  of  CR  or  PR  at  any 
time pre-surgery. Tumour response was assessed at each cycle, between Days 15-21 or on Study Day 
1 of the next cycle. 
Time to clinical response: Time to clinical response was the time from the date of first dose received to 
the first date of assessment of clinical response. 
Breast  conserving  surgery  rate:  This  was  defined  as  the  proportion  of  patients  who  achieved  breast 
conserving  surgery  out  of  the  ITT  population  without  inflammatory  breast  cancer  (these  patients 
received mastectomy irrespective of their response to neoadjuvant treatment). 
Overall survival (OS): This was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any 
cause. Patients who were alive or lost to follow-up were censored at the last known alive date. Patients 
with no post-baseline information were censored at the date of randomization plus one day. 
Disease-free survival (DFS): This was defined as the time from the first date of no disease (i.e., date 
of surgery) to the first documentation of PD or death. Any evidence of contralateral disease in situ was 
not considered as PD. DFS was described separately in patients who achieved a pCR  from those who 
did not. DFS was also described for the overall ITT population. Patients who were withdrawn from the 
study without documented PD were censored at the date of the last assessment when the patient was 
known to be disease-free. 
Progression-free  survival  (PFS):  This  was  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the 
first documentation of PD or death. Patients who were withdrawn from the study without documented 
PD were censored at the date of the last assessment when the patient was known to be free from PD.

Patients  without  post-baseline  assessments  but  known  to  be  alive  were  censored  at  the  time  of 
randomization plus one day. 
Secondary safety endpoints: 
o  Incidence of symptomatic cardiac events and asymptomatic LVEF events 
o  LVEF measures over the course of the study 
o  Incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs 
o  Laboratory test abnormalities. 
Explorative endpoints: Evaluation of biomarkers 
Sample size 
The sample size was based on the primary (safety) endpoint. Approximately 75 patients per arm were 
planned to be recruited into the study (225 in all).  
Randomisation 
Eligible  patients  were  randomized  via  interactive  voice  response  system  (IVRS)  at  a  central 
randomization center. Patients were randomly assigned using dynamic allocation to Arm A, B or C, and 
stratified by: 
a) Breast cancer type: operable (T2-3, N0-1, M0), locally advanced (T2-3, N2 or N3, M0; T4a-
c, any N, M0) and inflammatory (T4d, any N, M0) breast cancer 
b)  Hormonal  receptor  status:  hormone  receptor  positive  (ER+  and/  or  PR+)  versus  negative 
(ER- and PR-). 
Treatment was started within five working days after randomization. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The safety population included patients who received any amount of study medication. Patients were 
assigned to treatment groups as treated. 
Intent  to  Treat  (ITT)  Population  consisted  in  all  patients  randomized,  regardless  of  whether  they 
received  any  study  medication,  were  included  in  in  the  ITT  population.  Patients  were  assigned  to 
treatment groups as randomized for analysis purposes. All efficacy outputs were produced for the ITT 
population. 
Formal  hypothesis  testing  was  not  planned.  For  pCR  (the  main  efficacy  endpoint)  the  approximate 
expected pCR rates were: Arm A: 50%, Arm B: 45% and Arm C: 40%. With the planned sample size, 
if  these  response  rates  were  observed,  the  minimum  true  efficacy  (lower  bound  of  exact  95% 
confidence interval) of the estimates would be approximately A: 38.9% B: 33.8% C: 28.9%.  
For the assessment of incidence of symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), if the true 
underlying incidence was  3%, the probability of observing more than five such events in a treatment 
arm was 0.025. 
Secondary endpoints were calculated and summarized for descriptive purposes only. Clinical response 
rate and the proportion achieving BCS in each treatment arm were tabulated, together with their 
associated 95% CIs. The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate median time to clinical response

for each treatment arm. The Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by, operable, locally advanced, 
inflammatory breast cancer and oestrogen and or progesterone receptor positivity was used to 
estimate the Hazard Ratio (HR, i.e., the magnitude of treatment effect) and its 95% CI, for descriptive 
purposes only.

Recruitment 
Patients  were  recruited  at  44  centres  across  19  countries  (Bahamas,  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina,  Brazil, 
Canada,  Croatia,  Germany,  Great  Britain,  Italy,  Mexico,  New  Zealand,  Portugal,  Republic  of  China, 
Republic of Korea, Republic of Serbia, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland). The period 
of trial was 26 November 2009 to 21 June 2011 (Clinical cut off). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendment 
The protocol was amended once for the following reasons:  
• 
Protocol requirement for a mammogram between Study Day -14 and start of treatment: 
Extension of the window for the mammogram to be performed in screening period (from 14 
days prior start of treatment to up to 42 days prior to the start of treatment) has been made 
to remove the need for a second ‘study’ mammogram if patient has recently received a 
mammogram as part of standard practice. In addition, centres were able to use MRI in place of 
mammography according to local practice. 
• 
To provide information on the ‘Emergency Medical Call Centre Help Desk’ for medical 
emergencies outside regular business hours.

• 
• 
• 
To clarify schedule of ECG assessments in treatment period of study 
To provide information on Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) 
reporting. 
To clarify need for clinical breast exam and mammogram at end of Cycle 6 and prior to 
surgery. 
•  Clarification of CBC assessment schedule by treatment arm in neoadjuvant period of study. 
•  Clarification that Steering Committee will also look at key safety outputs from the neoadjuvant 
portion of the study. 
• 
To clarify that investigators may adjust dose of study medications based upon small changes in 
body weight or body surface area. 
•  Clarification of modifications of dosing of non-investigational medicinal products (IMPs; i.e., 
docetaxel, carboplatin, 5-Fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) 
Protocol Deviations 
Major Violations 
More patients in Arm A reported an inclusion criteria violation (14%, vs 5% in Arm B and 7% in Arm 
C),  all  of  which  were  designated  as  major  violations.  The  most  commonly  reported  inclusion  criteria 
violation  was  a  missing  pregnancy  test  result  (there  were  no  positive  pregnancy  test  results);  all  of 
these  patients  did  have  a  baseline  pregnancy  test  performed,  but  this  was  done  outside  the  allowed 
time  window.  Other  inclusion  violations  occurred  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  with  no  notable  difference 
across arms for any individual reason. Three patients in Arm A entered the study with a primary tumor 
< 2 cm in diameter. One patient in Arm A entered the study and received the first cycle of treatment, 
despite  not  having  confirmed  HER2-positive  breast  cancer;  this  patient’s  tumor  was  IHC  0/1+,  and 
HER2-positivity  was  not  determined  by  FISH.  The  patient  (who  remained  in  the  study  at  the 
investigator’s discretion, until surgery was complete) was subsequently withdrawn on Study Day 191, 
for this reason. In addition, one patient in Arm C did not have the eCRF page filled in for FFPE tissue 
availability, and so was reported as not having tissue available for HER2 testing; however, this patient 
was  tested  and  was  found  to  be  IHC  3+  and  HER2-positive  by  FISH.  One  patient  in  Arm  B  and  two 
patients in Arm C entered the study with a baseline LVEF reading of < 55%. 
One  patient  in  Arm  B  violated  the  criterion  excluding  patients  with  metastatic  disease  or  bilateral 
breast  cancer,  since  they  were  determined  to  have  inflammatory  metastatic  breast  cancer,  and  had 
presented with lung metastasis during screening. This patient was withdrawn on Study Day 24 for this 
reason.  Approximately  one  quarter  of  patients  in  each  treatment  arm  reported  at  least  one  on  study 
protocol violation. The most common on-study violation was “patient safety compromised”, reported in 
15%, 20% and 12 % of patients across Arms A, B and C, respectively. This category included patients 
for whom tumor assessments/CBE, LVEF measurement, or hematology evaluations were omitted for at 
least  one  scheduled  assessment,  as  well  as  patients  who  received  an  incorrect  dose  of  study 
treatment. 
Minor violations 
More patients in Arm A reported an exclusion criteria violation (12%, vs 5% in Arm B and 8% in Arm 
C):  all  but  the  above  noted  case  of  metastatic  disease,  were  minor  violations.  The  majority  of  these 
were due to impaired liver function, as indicated by laboratory assessments.

The  great  majority  of  patients  in  both  studies  were  <65  years  of  age.  Despite  the  small  patient 
numbers in the age group > 65 years and regardless of the pCR definition used, consistent trends are 
seen  for  patients  in  both age  groups  compared  with  the  overall  population,  i.e.,  a  higher  pCR  rate  in 
the Ptz+T+D arm compared with the T+D arm of the NEOSPHERE study.

pCR by region 
Table 26: pCR by region: NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA 
Clinical responses 
Clinical responses were evaluated slightly differently in the NEOSPHERE and  TRYPHAENA studies (see 
methods). To assist comparison between the studies, overall assessment of response (i.e., for breast 
and  lymph  nodes)  based  on  CBE  is  provided  for  the  two  studies.  Evaluation  based  on  CBE  is  shown 
since  this  was  scheduled  at  every  cycle  and  in  all  patients in  both  studies  and  because  CBE  includes 
assessment of lymph nodes as well as the breast. In both studies the majority of patients achieved a 
clinical  response  (CR  or  PR)  during  the  neoadjuvant  period.  Very  few  patients  in  either  study 
experienced disease progression (PD) as their best response to neoadjuvant. However, some patients 
in  the  NEOSPHERE  study  (mainly  patients  in  the  Ptz+T  arm)  experienced  disease  progression  during 
the  neoadjuvant  period  after  initially  appearing  to  have  stable  disease.  Only  one  patient  in  the 
TRYPHAENA  study  experienced  disease  progression  during  the  neoadjuvant  period.  This  patient,  with 
LABC, was randomized to receive FEC/Ptz+T+D and experienced PD after one cycle of FEC (before any 
pertuzumab or trastuzumab had been given). Overall, clinical response rates and clinical CR rates were 
consistent with the pCR findings in the two studies, with numerically higher pCR rates occurring in the 
TRYPHAENA study and, within the NEOSPHERE study, the highest pCR rates occurring in the Ptz+T+D 
arm and the lowest in the Ptz+T arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/285991/2015

Overall clinical response and clinical CR rates were also higher in the Ptz+T+D arm compared with the 
T+D  arm  of  the  NEOSPHERE  study.  Patients  in  the  FEC/Ptz+T+D  arm  of  the  TRYPHAENA  study  were 
less  likely  to  achieve  a  clinical  CR  than  patients  in  the  other  two  arms  of  this  study.  Patients  in  this 
treatment  arm  received  less  neoadjuvant  pertuzumab  and  trastuzumab  (three  doses/cycles)  than 
patients  in  the  other  two  arms  of  the  study  (six  doses/cycles),  and  these  patients  also  started 
pertuzumab  and  trastuzumab  later  (Cycle  4,  compared  with  Cycle  1  in  the  other  two  arms  of  the 
TRYPHAENA study).

Breast Conserving Surgery 
Excluding  patients  with  IBC  (who  according  to  current  guidelines  undergo  mastectomy  regardless  of 
response to neoadjuvant therapy) the majority of patients in both studies had a mastectomy: 25.0%-
33.0%  of  patients  underwent  BCS  in  the  NEOSPHERE  study  and  32.9%-33.3%  of  patients  in  the 
TRYPHAENA  study  underwent  BCS,  regardless  of  original  intent.  Overall  rates  of  BCS  were  similar  in 
the NEOSPHERE study, although patients in the Ptz+D arm were slightly more likely to undergo BCS. 
Overall rates of BCS were similar in the three arms of the TRYPHAENA study. 
Of  the  patients  with  T2-T3  disease  for  whom  a  mastectomy  was  planned  in  the  NEOSPHERE  study, 
18.0%-31.7%  actually  underwent  BCS.  In  the  TRYPHAENA  study,  patients  with  T2-T3  disease  for 
whom a mastectomy was planned were less likely to undergo BCS in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm compared 
with the Ptz+T+FEC/Pt+T+D and Ptz+TCH arms of the study.  
For the NEOSPHERE study, full details of the planned versus actual surgical procedures are provided, 
for  the  overall  patient  population,  and  split  by  treatment  group.  For  TRYPHAENA,  a  listing  of  the 
planned and actual surgery for breast cancer is provided.

2.4.3.  Supportive study 
A summary of efficacy data from the CLEOPATRA study, which was the pivotal trial for the approval of 
pertuzumab in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC), was included in present application. 
In metastatic breast cancer, the approval was based on a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial (CLEOPATRA) in 808 patients with HER2-positive MBC. Patients were randomly 
allocated (1:1) to receive pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel or placebo in 
combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel.  
The improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in the pertuzumab arm was statistically significant 
[HR, 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.51–0.75; p< 0.0001, log-rank test]. Moreover, a 
statistically significant improvement in OS of 15.7 months was observed with a HR of 0.68 (95% CI, 
0.56-0.84; p=0.0002). The median OS was 56.5 months in the pertuzumab+trastuzumab+docetaxel 
arm versus 40.8 months in the placebo+trastuzumab+docetaxel arm. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH provided data from two open-label phase II studies (studies NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA), 
randomised and multi-centre. Both studies had similar patient populations, but differed slightly with 
regard to treatment regimens and main objectives. Nonetheless, several of the endpoints were 
identical.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria define the target population as female patients >18 years with 
early breast cancer that are HER2-postive (HER2+), where the primary tumour is > 2 cm with no 
metastasis. The study population is considered to reflect future patients that could benefit from 
pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting and the MAH has adequately reflected the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria in the SmPC (see SmPC section 5.1). 
The choice of treatments and doses reflect current clinical practice and are as such acceptable. With 
regards to the NEOSPHERE study, it is however noted that the treatment regimens included 
Fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC) in the adjuvant regimens only. The neoadjuvant 
regiments consisted in HER2-therapy (trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab) in combination with a taxane 
(docetaxel). In operable cases, the timing of treatment (pre- versus post-operative) has no effect on 
long-term outcomes (Mieog et al, 2007). Due to the well-known cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab, it is not 
be administrated concomitantly with anthracyclines (see SmPC trastuzumab (Herceptin)), while the 
combination of trastuzumab and a taxane is safer in terms of cardiotoxicity (Senkus et al. Annals of 
Oncology, 2013). However, in order to increase the chances of pCR, the CHMP noted that it would 
have been preferable to add, e.g. FEC or TCH in the neoadjuvant setting in the NEOSPHERE study. The 
MAH argued that the study was designed so FEC chemotherapy was given after surgery in order to 
isolate the effect of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting which is a reasonable argument.  
The results from the TRYPHAENA study showed that the pCR rates were higher (compared with the 
NEOSPHERE study) and comparable across all three treatment arms. However, there was no control 
arm in the TRYPHAENA study, which was designed with safety measures as primary objective and 
efficacy measures as secondary objectives. One would expect higher pCR rates if the anthracycline 
component of the NEOSPHERE regimen was brought forward, and there is no scientific reason to 
expect that the additional benefit of pertuzumab would be lost, if FEC was given in the neoadjuvant 
setting. Overall, and also taking into consideration the solid evidence from the CLEOPATRA study (see 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/285991/2015 
Page 55/95 
 
 
 
 
 
section on supportive data) and the expected confirmatory results from the APHINITY study (see 
further below), the design of the NEOSPHERE study is considered acceptable from a scientific point of 
view to support the applied extension of indication.  
The MAH was also requested to compare and discuss the TRYPHAENA study with similar neoadjuvant 
trials published in the literature. Despite the limitations of cross-trial comparison, it was observed that 
the tpCR rates are consistently higher in the TRYPHAENA study. Thus, there is no reason to suspect 
that the addition of FEC in the neoadjuvant setting would dilute the effect of pertuzumab, or in other 
words, there seems to be an added benefit of combining FEC+trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the 
neoadjuvant setting.  
Docetaxel dose escalation was not permitted in Arm C of study TRYPHAENA, consistent with standard 
practice for the TCH regimen. The rationale is endorsed. When administered with Perjeta the 
recommended initial dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2, administered thereafter on a 3 weekly schedule. 
The docetaxel dose should not be escalated when used in combination with carboplatin, trastuzumab 
and Perjeta (see SmPC section 4.2). 
The pCR was defined as ypT0/is and the MAH has also provided results based on the different 
definitions of pCR. To fulfil the definition of tpCR (ypT0/is ypN0) as referred to in the Draft Guidance on 
The role of the pathological Complete Response as an 4 endpoint in neoadjuvant breast cancer studies 
(EMA/CHMP/151853/2014) adequate data on staging and management of axillary lymph nodes would 
be needed. In both NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies, sentinel node biopsy at study entry was not 
prospectively collected. However, 5 and 10 patients were identified by the MAH. Of the 5 patients 
enrolled in NEOSPHERE, 2 were sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive and 3 SLN-negative, none was 
enrolled in the D+T+Ptz arm. In the TRYPHAENA, the number of retrieved sentinel node biopsies was 
10 of whom 5 achieved a bpCR and tpCR. None had any further axillary sampling or axillary surgery 
reported and the axillary nodal status at primary surgery was based on baseline SLN biopsy result. 
Hence, the low number of patients for whom the SLN status is available together with the lack of 
further axillary evaluation did not allow any conclusion on the potential impact of nodal status on 
bp/tpCR. 
The Applicant has used dynamic allocation in the NEOSPHERE study due to the likelihood of small 
strata. Although less preferred since such deterministic schemes should be avoided as discussed in the 
CHMP guideline (EMA/295050/2013), it was considered acceptable.  To support the dynamic allocation, 
the p-values were supplemented with randomisation test that supported the primary analysis.  
Both studies were open-label. Blinded review of the specimens and central review of pathology slides 
was requested but not provided as many sites are now closed since the NEOSPHERE study is complete 
and the TRYPHAENA study has been running for several years. Nevertheless, efficacy outcomes (PFS 
and DFS) at 5 years in the NEOSPHERE showed HRs in favour of Arm B (pertuzumab containing arm). 
Although the NEOSPHERE study was not designed to detect a difference in terms of PFS/DFS/OS 
between the different treatment arms, it is still encouraging to see these results in favour of the 
pertuzumab arm. Also, recent data from the GEPAR-SEPTO trial (comparison of two forms of 
paclitaxel) support the findings in the TRYPHAENA study (Untch M et al., Abstract S2-07, 2014 San 
Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium). Thus, the likelihood of biased reviews of pathology 
slides/specimens in the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies is considered to be very low. 
The MAH noted that in general the pathologists were not informed of patients’ treatment allocation. 
According to the results of a survey performed by the MAH, pathologists were only aware of treatment 
arm in 4.6% (19 patients) in NEOSPHERE and 9.8% (22 patients) in TRYPHAENA. Thus, assuming that 
these results were all biased, it would still not change the overall results. Furthermore, an analysis of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/285991/2015 
Page 56/95 
 
 
 
 
 
pCR status by region shows that pCR trends in the different regions are consistent with the overall 
results. 
The Applicant claimed that studies NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA were conducted in accordance with 
the principles of GCP. Several inspections were conducted by other national competent authorities. 
Only one inspection found critical and major issues in one centre participating in the TRYPHAENA 
study. These findings are not considered to have an impact on the overall benefit-risk balance of 
pertuzumab. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
There was a clear and statistically significant difference in bpCR of 16.8% in favour of the Ptz+T+D 
arm in NEOSPHERE study, where a bpCR rate of 45.8% was achieved, compared to 29% in the T+D. 
Ptz+T and Ptz+D had lower bpCR rates compared to T+D.  The tpCR (ypT0/is N0) rates showed the 
same pattern with a 17.8% difference in favour of the Ptz+T+D arm compared to the Ptz+T arm. 
Regardless of treatment arm, the pCR rates achieved in the TRYPHAENA study were consistently high 
and similar across all treatment groups. In general, the pCR rates were higher compared to the 
Ptz+T+D arm in the NEOSPHERE study. The higher rate of pCR in the TRYPHAENA study reflects the 
higher number cycles of treatment in the neoadjuvant setting, and the use of the combination of 
pertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy in all 3 treatment arms.  
Clinical responses were evaluated differently in the two studies. In the NEOSPHERE it was based on 
clinical breast examination (CBE) and imaging, while in the TRYPHAENA study it was only based on 
CBE. Hence, cross-comparison of data may only be partially justified. There were high and similar 
overall response (CR+PR) rates in the Ptz+T+D arm in the NEOSPHERE study and in all three arms of 
the TRYPHAENA study. Time to clinical response was around 6-7 weeks in all arms in the NEOSPHERE 
study. In the TRYPHAENA study, time to clinical response was 3.6 weeks in Arm A compared to 6.3 
weeks and 4.9 weeks in Arm B and C respectively.  
The number of planned mastectomies that underwent breast conserving surgery (BCS) was highest 
(31.7%) in the Ptz+D arm in the NEOSPHERE study. However, this group of patients did not achieve 
the highest pCR rate. The BCS rates were similar between the three treatment arms in the TRYPHAENA 
study and comparable with the T+D and Ptz+T+D arms in the NEOSPHERE study. The NEOSPHERE 
and TRYPHAENA studies were not designed to show a difference in BCS and the reasons for choosing 
mastectomy or BCS were not collected. Thus, despite the higher pCR rate in arm T+D and Ptz+T+D, 
no firm conclusions can be drawn on the BCS.   
There were very few patients over 65 years in the submitted studies. Limited data are available on the 
safety and efficacy of Perjeta in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see SmPC section 4.2).  
Pertuzumab has not been investigated in a paediatric patient population or in patients with hepatic 
impairment (see SmPC section 4.2). 
The enrolled population was overall representative of the target patient population in both studies. 
However, a high percentage of tumours in both studies were classified unknown as histological grade 
(35% in NEOSPHERE and 20.4% in TRYPHAENA). There are no obvious reasons for “unknown grade” in 
this group of patients, but it seems to be site-specific and not by geographic region. Furthermore, 
tumour grade is not required for treatment decision. However, recent publications show a clear link 
between pCR rates in low-grade vs. high-grade disease. A meta-analysis of neoadjuvant studies has 
shown that pCR rates were lower in patients with low-grade, hormone receptor-positive (HR+) 
tumours, and higher in the following tumour subtypes in increasing order: high-grade HR+, 
HR+/HER2+, triple negative, and hormone receptor-negative (HR–)/HER2+. In addition, patients with 
Assessment report

Page 57/95 
 
 
 
 
 
more aggressive tumour subtypes who achieved pCR seemed to have greater EFS benefit compared to 
patients who did not achieve pCR (Cortazar et al., Lancet 2014).  An analysis of pCR, excluding 
patients with tumours of “unknown grade” showed that bpCR and tpCR were comparable with the 
findings in the ITT analysis (data not shown) which is reassuring. Thus, it seems that the overall 
estimate is not influenced by the population of patients with “unknown tumour grade”. 
tpCR is, as expected highest in the ptz+T+D arm in the NEOSPHERE study and comparable between 
Arms A-C in the TRYPHAENA study with regard to patients with high-grade disease (poorly 
differentiated). Very few patients had low grade disease (well differentiated), and a meaningful 
comparison is not possible.  
A comparison of high-grade HR+ disease with HR+ in general showed higher rate of tpCR in the 
Ptz+T+D arm in the NEOSPHERE study. This is in line with the findings in the meta-analysis by 
Cortazar et al, Lancet 2014. The same comparison in the TRYPHAENA study showed comparable effect 
in both groups. However, the subgroups are small and no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
In the overall patient population of both studies, efficacy results are considered clinically relevant.  
In both studies pCR rates and magnitude of improvement with pertuzumab were lower in the subgroup 
of patients with hormone-receptor-positive tumours compared to patients with hormone receptor-
negative tumours. In particular, in NEOSPHERE (study including non pertuzumab-containing control 
arm) subgroup analyses, patients with hormone receptor-positive disease had lower bpCR rates (5.9% 
- 26%, across treatment arms [highest in Ptz+T+D arm]) than patients with hormone receptor-
negative disease (27.3% - 63.2%, across treatment arms [highest in Ptz+T+D arm]).  
The poor response in HR-positive disease in NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies is biologically 
plausible and consistent with the majority of data reported in the literature. However, the importance 
of HER2-targeted therapy in HR+ disease should not be neglected and hormone therapy alone has 
shown very low efficacy in patients with HR+/HER2+ disease in a number of trials (TAnDEM (Kaufman 
B et al. 2009, J Clin Oncol.); study eLEcTRA (Huober J, et al. 2009, Cancer Res.), study CALGB-40302 
(Burstein HJ et al. 2014, J Clin Oncol). In addition, the published meta-analyses driven by the FDA 
(Cortazar et al. 2014, Lancet), which included individual patient data from approximately 12.000 
patients, showed that there is a clear advantage in terms of long-term outcomes in patients with 
HER2+ disease, who achieve a pCR, irrespective of hormone receptor (HR) status. Moreover, the 
CLEOPATRA study clearly showed a Hazard Ratio for OS of 0.71 (0.51, 0.96) in patients with HR+ 
disease, compared with 0.61 (0.47, 0.81) in patients with HR-negative disease. Thus, the CHMP 
concluded that there is solid evidence for a statistically significant and clinically relevant effect of 
pertuzumab in HER2+ breast cancer in the metastatic setting, regardless of hormone receptor status. 
In the context of the totality of data and the above discussion, it is reasonable to expect that this 
should also be the case in the neoadjuvant setting. 
Regarding pCR data by disease stage/type, tpCR by disease stage/type seems to in line with the 
overall estimate. In both studies, pCR rates were similar in patients with operable versus locally 
advanced disease (see SmPC section 5.1). Regarding the tumour stage it is noted that a low 
percentage of IBC was included. However, baseline demographic and disease characteristics were 
sufficiently consistent with expectations for such a population. In the NEOSPHERE study, there were 
too few patients with inflammatory breast cancer to draw any firm conclusions, but the pCR rate was 
higher in patients who received Perjeta plus trastuzumab and docetaxel. In the TRYPHAENA study, 
there were also too few patients with inflammatory breast cancer to draw any firm conclusions. This 
has been reflected in the SmPC (see SmPC section 5.1).

The DFS, PFS and OS data are not mature yet for the TRYPHAENA study. DFS and PFS data were 
provided for the NEOSPHERE study. The long term outcome data (PSF, DFS, PFS pCR versus non-pCR) 
in the overall population of the NEOSPHERE study, although not statistically powered and with wide 
CIs, showed HRs consistent with the observed pCR increase. However, none of the two studies 
(NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA) were powered to detect a difference. Efficacy data that should permit 
confirmation of the positive results seen in the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies are expected from 
the much larger phase III study (APHINITY) of adjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy plus 
pertuzumab or placebo in patients with primary operable breast cancer. 
The SAG Oncology was consulted and discussed whether the difference in tpCR rate of 17.8% between 
Arm  A  and  B  in  the  NEOSPHERE  study  is  sufficiently  large  enough  to  translate  into  a  significant 
difference with regard to DFS and OS. Given the existing uncertainty about pCR as a surrogate for DFS 
and  OS,  the  SAG  concluded  that  a  difference  of  18%  does  not  allow  to  automatically  conclude  a 
significant difference with regard to long-term benefit. In addition NEOSPHERE design was not optimal 
to address this question of surrogacy (not all major treatments were given in the neoadjuvant setting, 
e.g., anthracyclines, and this may lead to overestimating the treatment effect of the experimental drug 
pertuzumab). However, the SAG agreed that in the context of the totality of the data, in particular, the 
strong biological rationale for the combination, the compelling efficacy results in the metastatic setting, 
the  acceptable  toxicity  profile  (see  clinical  safety),  and  the  observed  effect  in  terms  of  pCR,  it  is 
reasonably likely that neoadjuvant treatment with pertuzumab is associated with a benefit in terms of 
DFS and OS. A precise estimation of the expected long-term benefit is currently not possible based on 
the  available  data.  Although  based  on  a  small  number  of  events  (18%  and  16%  for  the  control  and 
pertuzumab  group,  respectively,  cut-off  20  October  2014),  exploration  of  the  event-free  survival  by 
treatment showed a HR of 0.69 (95% CI [0.34, 1.40]), which is encouraging.  
Importantly,  the  trial  in  the  adjuvant  setting  (APHINITY)  has  completed  its  recruitment.  The  final 
analysis  of  invasive  disease-free  survival  (IDFS)  from  the  APHINITY  study  (phase  III)  should  permit 
confirmation  of  the  clinical  benefit  of  pertuzumab  observed  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  from  the 
NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies (see Annex II).  
The  MAH  has  also  initiated  the  BERENICE  study,  which  will  enrol  a  similar  patient  population  to  that 
enrolled  in  the  NEOSPHERE  and  TRYPHAENA  studies.  The  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  is  cardiac 
safety  of  pertuzumab  in  combination  with  two  commonly  used  neoadjuvant  regimens.  Secondary 
endpoints  include  overall  safety  and  pCR  rate.  The  study  is  planned  to  enrol  approximately  400 
patients  (200  patients  in  each  cohort).  Safety  and  efficacy  data  from  the  neoadjuvant  period  are 
anticipated in 2017. Thus, this study will also provide valuable information with regard to efficacy and 
safety on the use of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting (see Annex II).  
The SAG Oncology also discussed the data in the HR-positive population and noted that the lower pCR 
rates observed in patients with HR+ tumours adds to the uncertainty with regard to long-term benefit. 
However, the subgroup analysis is based on very limited data and it is difficult to rule out the play of 
chance. Although the observed effect was lower in patients with HR+ tumours, in the context of the 
totality of the data (see above), the effect is still considered to be reasonably likely associated with a 
benefit in terms of long-term outcomes. Further understanding about the long-term effects in this 
subgroup of patients is expected on the basis of the ongoing adjuvant trial (APHINITY). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, in the context of the totality of the data, in particular, the strong biological rationale for 
the combination, the compelling efficacy results in the metastatic setting, the acceptable toxicity 
Assessment report

profile, and the observed effect in terms of pCR, the efficacy is considered established. Although not 
statistically significant, efficacy outcome data (DFS and OS) from the NEOSPHERE study shows a trend 
in favour of pertuzumab. This should also be seen in light of the survival benefit of adding pertuzumab 
to trastuzumab in the metastatic setting. 
Confirmatory study data in terms of DFS and OS are considered necessary to address long term 
efficacy of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting. Study APHINITY has been included as a condition in 
the Annex II as post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES). Further efficacy data are also expected from 
the post-authorisation safety study BERENICE. 
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): 
May 2017 
In order to provide long-term efficacy data in terms of DFS and OS, the MAH should 
submit the results of study BO25126 (APHINITY), a randomized multicenter, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of chemotherapy plus trastuzumab 
plus placebo versus chemotherapy plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab as adjuvant 
therapy in patients with operable HER2-positive primary breast cancer 
Post-authorisation safety study (PASS): 
May 2017 
In order to evaluate cardiac safety and provide further efficacy data in the 
neoadjuvant setting, the MAH should submit the results of study WO29217 
(BERENICE), a multicentre, multinational, Phase II study to evaluate pertuzumab in 
combination with trastuzumab and standard neoadjuvant anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, or 
early-stage breast cancer. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The evaluation of clinical safety included safety data from the two neoadjuvant studies, NEOSPHERE 
(WO20697) and TRYPHAENA (BO22280), and a supporting study, CLEOPATRA (WO20698/TOC4129g) 
in patients with metastatic breast cancer.  
Overall, the two neoadjuvant studies provided safety data for 532 patients treated with pertuzumab in 
combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy (e.g., docetaxel, FEC or TCH) in the neoadjuvant 
setting. This included safety data from 309 patients in the NEOSPHERE study and 223 patients in the 
TRYPHAENA study.  
The supporting study CLEOPATRA provided safety data from 408 patients with metastatic breast 
cancer, who were exposed to pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel, i.e., the 
same regimen used during the neoadjuvant phase in the Ptz+T+D arm of the NEOSPHERE study and 
part of the neoadjuvant regimen used in two of the treatment arms in the TRYPHAENA study 
(Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D and FEC/Ptz+T+D).  
As NEOSPHERE, TRYPHAENA and CLEOPATRA evaluated different combination regimens in different 
patient populations (LABC/IBC/EBC vs. metastatic breast cancer), safety data from the three trials 
were presented as stand-alone tables.

In  the  CLEOPATRA  study,  patients  received  placebo+T+D  or  Ptz+T+D  every  three  weeks  until 
progression of disease, withdrawal or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were exposed to pertuzumab for a 
much  longer  time  compared  with  patients  in  the  NEOSPHERE  and  TRYPHAENA  studies.  On  average, 
25.4 cycles of Ptz+T+D have been administrated. Patients received a median of 8 cycles of Ptz+T+D. 
Because Ptz+T could be given after discontinuation of docetaxel, they also received a median 24 cycles 
of Ptz+T, including the cycles given with docetaxel. Some patients received up to 42 cycles of all three 
agents (Ptz+T+D).

Adverse Events – all grades 
Study NEOSPHERE 
During the neoadjuvant period, the most common SOCs affected (i.e., occurring in ≥ 25% of patients 
across all treatment arms) were Gastrointestinal Disorders (of which diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and 
stomatitis were the most common [occurring in > 10% of patients in any arm]) and General Disorders 
and Administration Site Conditions (most commonly fatigue, mucosal inflammation, asthenia, pyrexia, 
and peripheral oedema). 
In the Ptz+T+D arm, there was a higher incidence of Cardiac Disorders (11.2%, vs. 4.7%, 5.6%, and 
3.2% in the T+D, Ptz+T, and Ptz+D arms, respectively). Between the T+D and Ptz+T+D arms, the 
incidence of AEs was comparable in most SOCs, with the exception of Gastrointestinal Disorders (more 
events in the Ptz+T+D arm compared with the T+D arm), Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders 
(more events in the T+D arm compared with the Ptz+T+D arm), and Infections and Infestations (more 
events in the T+D arm compared with the Ptz+T+D arm).

In the neoadjuvant period, the most frequently occurring AEs (i.e., reported in ≥ 25% of patients in 
any arm) were alopecia, neutropenia, diarrhoea, nausea, fatigue, rash and mucosal inflammation (see 
Table below).  
Table 35: Summary of adverse events with an incidence rate of at least 5% in NEOSPHERE 
(neoadjuvant period) 
In the adjuvant period, the most common AEs reported (i.e., those reported in ≥ 25% of patients in 
any treatment arm) were similar to those reported for the neoadjuvant period (e.g., nausea, 
neutropenia, fatigue, diarrhea and alopecia) with the exception of radiation skin injury, which occurred 
in similar proportions of patients across treatment arms (20.4% in the T+D arm, 18.6% in the 
Ptz+T+D arm, 23.4% in the Ptz+T arm, and 27.3% in the Ptz+D arm). 
As of the third clinical cutoff date (12 July 2013), of the 378 patients who entered the post-treatment 
follow-up period, 7 patients (6.5%) in the T+D arm, 9 patients (8.4%) in the Ptz+T+D arm, 7 patients 
Assessment report

(6.5%) in the Ptz+T arm, and 7 patients (7.4%) in the Ptz+D arm experienced AEs. Most of these 
occurred in the early post-treatment follow-up period (i.e., before the second clinical cutoff, 09 March 
2012). LVD was reported in 3 patients (2.8%) in the Ptz+T+D arm and in 2 patients (2.1%) in the 
Ptz+D arm. Other common events included musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders such as 
myalgia and arthralgia (experienced by 3 patients in the T+D arm and 2 patients in the Ptz+T+D arm) 
and gastrointestinal disorders (experienced by 4 patients in total: 1 patient in the T+D arm, 2 patients 
in the Ptz+T+D arm and 1 patient in the Ptz+T arm). Five AEs were reported between the second (9 
March 2012) and third clinical cutoff date (12 July 2013) and all were considered unrelated to study 
treatment. 
Study TRYPHAENA 
In the neoadjuvant period, the most common SOCs affected (i.e., occurring in ≥ 25% across all 
treatment arms) were: Gastrointestinal Disorders, Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders, Blood and 
Lymphatic System Disorders, General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions, Infections and 
Infestations, Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders, Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal 
Disorders.  
The incidence of AEs was highest in the Ptz+TCH arm (> 10% difference compared with both of the 
other two treatment arms) in the following SOC: General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions 
(61% in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 65% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 78% in the Ptz+TCH arm); 
Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders (24% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 16% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 
34% in the Ptz+TCH arm); Investigations (19% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 13% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D 
arm and 33% in the Ptz+TCH arm). 
The incidence of patients with Cardiac Disorders was lowest in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm compared with 
the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and Ptz+TCH arm (5.3%, vs. 11.1% and 10.5%, respectively).  LVD was 
the most frequently reported event (4 patients [5.6%] in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 3 patients 
[4.0%] in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 2 patients [2.6%] in the Ptz+TCH arm). 
The majority of patients who entered the adjuvant period experienced at least one AE (57/68 [84%] in 
the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 60/65 [92%] in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 53/67 [79%] in the 
Ptz+TCH arm). The most common SOCs affected (i.e., in ≥25% of patients across all 3 treatment 
arms) were Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (33.8% in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm 
vs. 40.0% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm vs. 32.8% in the Ptz+TCH arm), and Skin and Subcutaneous 
Tissue Disorders (26.5% in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm vs. 36.9% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm vs. 
32.8% in the Ptz+TCH arm). Across treatment arms, the most common AE was radiation skin injury 
(11/68 [16.2%] in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 14/65 [21.5%] in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 7/67 
[10.4%] in the Ptz+TCH arm). 
In general, the most common SOCs affected and most frequently occurring AEs in the overall 
treatment period were similar to those reported for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant periods. In the 
overall treatment period, the incidence of patients with Cardiac Disorders was comparable between the 
Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm (15.3% vs. 16.0%), with a slightly higher 
frequency reported in the Ptz+TCH arm (21.1%). The most frequently reported AEs occurring in the 
SOC, Cardiac Disorders were LVD, palpitations and tachycardia. 
In the post-treatment follow-up period, 6 patients (8.3%) in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 9 patients 
(12.0%) in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 5 patients (6.6%) in the Ptz+TCH arm experienced AEs. During 
this period, the most common AE (occurring in more than 2% of patients in any treatment arm) was 
LVD (1.4% of patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 4.0% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, and 2.6% in 
the Ptz+TCH arm). All other events occurred in single patients.

Study CLEOPATRA 
As of the clinical cutoff date of 14 May 2012, the overall incidence of AEs was balanced between the 
treatment arms (98.7% of patients in the Pla+T+D arm vs. 100% of patients in the Ptz+T+D arm), 
although the total number of AEs reported in the Ptz+T+D arm (6521 AEs) was higher than in the 
Pla+T+D arm (5535 AEs). The majority of AEs in both treatment arms were Grade 1-2 in severity: 
4890 of 5535 AEs (88.3%) in the Pla+T+D arm and 5773 of 6521 AEs (88.5%) in the Ptz+T+D arm. 
In both treatment arms, the most common AEs (i.e., occurring in ≥ 25% of patients in either arm) 
included alopecia, diarrhoea, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, rash, asthenia, decreased appetite, 
vomiting, peripheral edema and mucosal inflammation. 
The incidence of diarrhoea, rash, mucosal inflammation, pruritus, febrile neutropenia and dry skin was 
higher (≥ 5% difference) in the Ptz+T+D arm compared with the Pla+T+D arm, whereas the incidence 
of  peripheral  edema  and  constipation  was  higher  (≥  5%  difference)  in  the  Pla+T+D  arm  compared 
with the Ptz+T+D arm. 
Overall,  17.4%  of  patients  in  the  Pla+T+D  arm  (69  patients)  and  15.4%  of  patients  in  the  Ptz+T+D 
arm (63 patients) experienced Cardiac Disorders. The most frequently reported cardiac-related AE was 
LVD (8.6% of patients in the Pla+T+D arm vs. 5.4% of patients in the Ptz+T+D arm). 
The  majority  of  patients  in  both  treatment  arms  experienced  at  least  one  AE  considered  by  the 
Investigator to have a reasonable suspected causal relationship to study treatment (96.2% of patients 
in  the  Pla+T+D  arm  and  97.3%  of  patients  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm).  The  most  commonly  reported  AEs 
that were considered related to study treatment by the Investigator were alopecia, diarrhoea, nausea, 
neutropenia,  fatigue,  rash,  asthenia,  mucosal  inflammation,  decreased  appetite,  nail  disorder  and 
myalgia. 
The  post-treatment  follow-up  period  in  the  CLEOPATRA  study  was  defined  as  starting  more  than  42 
days after discontinuation of study medication. During the post-treatment follow-up period, 12 patients 
(3.0%) and 10 patients (2.5%) reported a total of 14 and 19 AEs in the Pla+T+D and Ptz+T+D arms, 
respectively.  One  event,  Prinzmetal  angina  in  a  patient  in  the  Pla+T+D  arm,  was  considered  serious 
and  related  to  study  treatment.  All  other  AEs  reported  during  this  period  were  non-serious,  and  no 
notable difference in incidence of AEs was observed between the treatment arms. 
Adverse events grade ≥ 3  
Study NEOSPHERE 
During the neoadjuvant period, the majority of patients (62.6%-72.9%) in the docetaxel-containing 
treatment arms (i.e., T+D, Ptz+T+D, and Ptz+D arms) experienced at least one AE of Grade ≥ 3 
severity compared with 6.5% in the Ptz+T arm. The majority of Grade ≥ 3 AEs were Blood and 
Lymphatic System Disorders (mainly neutropenia and leukopenia), and these were reported by fewer 
patients in the Ptz+T+D arm compared with the T+D or Ptz+D arms. 
As expected, during the adjuvant period, the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs was highest in the Ptz+T arm 
(67.0%, compared with 35.9% in the T+D arm, 35.3% in the Ptz+T+D arm and 38.6% in the Ptz+D 
arm, which was likely due to the administration of 3 cycles of docetaxel (in addition to 3 cycles of FEC) 
during the adjuvant period in this arm (all other arms received docetaxel in the neoadjuvant period 
only). The most common Grade ≥ 3 AEs (i.e., those reported in > 5% of patients in any treatment arm) 
were haematological toxicities: neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and granulocytopenia. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/285991/2015

During adjuvant trastuzumab treatment following the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, 8 patients 
(7.8%) in the T+D arm, 8 patients (7.8%) in Ptz+T+D arm, 10 patients (10.6%) in the Ptz+T arm and 
8 patients (9.1%) in the Ptz+D arm experienced Grade ≥  3 AEs. 
During the overall treatment period, Grade ≥ 3 AEs were generally balanced across treatment arms 
during the study, with the lowest incidence occurring in the Ptz+T arm (60.2%, compared with 81.3% 
in the T+D arm, 72.9% in the Ptz+T+D arm and 78.7% in the Ptz+D arm). 
The most common Grade ≥ 3 AEs (i.e., those reported in ≥ 5% of patients in any treatment arm) were 
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, irregular menstruation and diarrhea. Of note, in the 
Ptz+T arm, although the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia was lowest (4.6%) compared with 
the other treatment arms, the incidence of Grade ≥3 granulocytopenia was highest (4.6%). 
Three Grade 3 events (no Grade 4 or 5 events) were reported in the post-treatment follow-up period: 
one event of abdominal distention in a patient in the T+D arm (which was considered unrelated to 
study treatment and remained unresolved at the time of the clinical cutoff date); one event of 
myeloproliferative disorder in a patient in the Ptz+D arm; and one event of  ‘breast prosthesis 
removal’ in a patient in the Ptz+D arm. 
Study TRYPHAENA 
During the neoadjuvant period, the proportion of patients experiencing an AE of Grade ≥ 3 severity was 
69% in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 60% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 74% in the Ptz+TCH arm. 
Grade ≥ 3 AEs were predominately Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders, with neutropenia the most 
commonly reported event (43%−47% of patients across treatment arms), followed by febrile 
neutropenia (18.1% of patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 9.0% of patients in the FEC/Ptz+T+D 
arm and 17.1% of patients in the Ptz+TCH arm). Grade ≥ 3 Infection and Infestation AEs occurred in 
4%−8% of patients across treatment arms, with no single event predominating. Grade ≥ 3 neutropenic 
infection occurred in 2 patients (1 each in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and the Ptz+TCH arm), and Grade ≥ 3 
neutropenic sepsis occurred in one patient (in the Ptz+TCH arm). Grade ≥ 3 anemia was notably higher 
in the Ptz+TCH arm (17%) than in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D and FEC/Ptz+T+D arms (1% and 3%, 
respectively). Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia also occurred exclusively in patients in the Ptz+TCH arm 
(11.8% of patients), which led to dose modification of study treatment in some patients. Grade ≥ 3 
LVD occurred in only two patients (2.7%), both in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm.  
Of the patients who entered the adjuvant period, a total of 9 patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 
10 patients in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 8 patients in the Ptz+TCH arms experienced a Grade ≥ 3 AE 
in the adjuvant period. One fatal event was reported (“metastatic neoplasm”, which appeared to be 
due to relapse of the patient’s underlying breast cancer), and occurred in a patient in the 
Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm. All other events were Grade 3 and occurred in single patients, with the 
exception of erythema (2 patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm), pneumonia (2 patients in the 
Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm) and neutropenia (2 patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 3 in the 
FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 1 in the Ptz+TCH arm). 
In the overall treatment period, the proportion of patients experiencing an AE of Grade ≥ 3 was similar 
to that seen during the neoadjuvant period (73.6% in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 61.3% in the 
FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 73.7% in the Ptz+TCH arm).  
Two Grade ≥ 3 events were reported in the post-treatment follow-up period, both in the FEC/Ptz+T+D 
arm: one patient experienced NYHA Class II symptomatic LVSD (NCI-CTCAE Grade 3), which later 
improved, and one patient (who received docetaxel in the post-treatment follow-up period) 
experienced a Grade 4 event of neutropenic infection, which resolved without sequelae.

Study CLEOPATRA 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
Cardiac dysfunction 
Reporting of cardiac safety was similar but not identical in the three studies. Although Investigators 
were to report left ventricular dysfunction events as asymptomatic or symptomatic LVSD in the 
TRYPHAENA and CLEOPATRA studies, these events were both coded to ‘left ventricular dysfunction’ 
(LVD), according to MedDRA. Symptomatic LVD is distinguishable from asymptomatic LVD in these 
studies by NCICTCAE grading (symptomatic events are Grade 3 or greater). In the NEOSPHERE study, 
symptomatic LVSD was reportable as ‘congestive heart failure’ (CHF), which coded to the term, ‘heart 
failure, congestive’ according to MedDRA. In all three studies, asymptomatic declines in LVEF were 
only reportable as AEs (using the term, ‘left ventricular systolic dysfunction’ [LVSD]) if they met 
certain criteria. However, if an event met any criteria for seriousness (e.g., hospitalization), this was 
reportable as an SAE. 
When analyzing the data, SAEs considered suggestive of CHF were defined as SAEs coded to a 
preferred term (PT) in the standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) ‘Cardiac Failure (wide).’ This included 
symptomatic events reported as SAEs under the term LVSD (MedDRA PT LVD), as well as other events 
reported as SAEs (such as pulmonary edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, etc). 
Study NEOSPHERE 
To  ensure  that  differences  in  cardiac  safety  profile  in  the  four  arms  of  the  study  were  not  due  to 
imbalances  in  potential  risk  factors  at  baseline,  these  were  compared  and  no  major  imbalances 
between the treatment arms were apparent. 
Cardiac events 
In the Neoadjuvant Period, there were slightly more cardiac disorders in Arm B (Ptz+T+D), but these 
were  mostly  palpitations  in  relation  with  infusions.  5  patients  (4.7%)  in  the  T+D  arm,  12  patients 
(11.2%) in the Ptz+T+D arm, 6 patients (5.6%) in the Ptz+T arm and 3 patients (3.2%) in the Ptz+D 
arms  experienced  at  least  one  AE  in  the  SOC,  Cardiac  Disorders.  Many  of  these  events  were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/285991/2015 
Page 69/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
palpitations  or  tachycardia,  and  some  of  these  occurred  on  the  day  of  a  study  treatment  infusion, 
suggesting they were infusion-related events. There were 3 cases of left ventricular dysfunction.  
In the Adjuvant Period, the proportion of patients with AEs in the SOC, Cardiac Disorders was highest 
in the Ptz+T+D arm (12.7%) and lowest in the T+D arm (3.9%). The most common cardiac AEs were 
LVD and palpitations, each reported in 11 patients. Of the 11 patients with LVD in the adjuvant period 
(1  in  the  T+D  arm,  5  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm,  0  in  the  Ptz+T  arm  and  5  in  the  Ptz+D  arm),  all  events 
resolved without sequelae, with the exception of one patient in the Ptz+D arm, for whom palpitations 
remained  unresolved.  Overall,  there  were  also  more  cardiac  disorders  in  Arm  B,  with  5  cases  of  left 
ventricular  dysfunction.  In  contrast  to  the  neoadjuvant  period,  the  risk  of  LVD  seemed  to  be  slightly 
increased in Arm D (Ptz+D) in the adjuvant setting.  
During the overall treatment period, the incidence of LVD was higher in the pertuzumab, trastuzumab 
and docetaxel-treated group (7.5%) compared to the trastuzumab and docetaxel-treated group 
(1.9%). There was one case of symptomatic LVD in the Perjeta and trastuzumab-treated group. Only 
two patients had a Grade ≥3 LVD; one patient in each of Arm B (Ptz+T+D) and Arm C (Ptz+T). 
Similarly, only two patients experienced a LVD leading to withdrawal from study treatment. 
Looking at potential risk factors, several of the patients had a history of hypertension and 
hypercholesterolemia/dyslipidemia, and were being treated with antihypertensiva and statins. The 
majority of the events were asymptomatic.  
There were few cases of LVD in the follow-up period. Those few cases that occurred were not serious 
and resolved without sequelae.  
In conclusion, there were more cases of LVD in the Ptz+T+D arm, but these were only Grade 3, 
asymptomatic and in some cases seen in patients with cardiac risk factors.   
Changes in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction during the NEOSPHERE Study 
To  enter  the  study,  patients  had  to  have  an  LVEF  of  ≥55%.  Patients  in  all  four  treatment  arms  had 
mean  and  median  LVEF  values  of  about  65%  at  baseline  (individual  patient  values  range  from  53%-
81%).  The  majority  of  patients  (~60%-70%)  in  all  four  treatment  arms  had  no  change  in  LVEF  over 
the overall treatment period.  
The  greatest  decline  in  LVEF  was  around  7-8%,  and  most  of  the  patients  remained  above  50%  in 
LVEF.  About  20  patients  experienced  a  decline  more  than  10%.  Of  these, 9  patients  had  a  decline in 
LVEF on two consecutive LVEF measurements.  LVEF decline seemed to be small and only a fraction of 
the patients experience more than 10% on two consecutive measurements. 
Study TRYPHAENA 
Cardiac events 
In the neoadjuvant period, 8 patients (11.1%) in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 4 patients (5.3%) in 
the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 8 patients (10.5%) in the Ptz+TCH arm, experienced at least one AE in the 
SOC,  Cardiac  Disorders.  As  seen  in  the  NEOSPHERE  study,  the  most  common  cardiac  AEs  were  LVD 
and palpitations, with all other events occurring in two patients or fewer. Overall, there were less AEs 
in Arm B, but the number of LVD is more or less comparable between the three arms. 
In the adjuvant period, a total of 27 patients (5 [7.4%] in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 10 patients 
[15.4%] in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 12 patients [17.9%] in the Ptz+TCH arm) experienced at least 
one AE in the SOC, Cardiac Disorders. Of these, 4 patients (5.9%) in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 5 
patients (7.7%) in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 3 patients (4.5%) in the Ptz+TCH arm experienced LVD, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/285991/2015 
Page 70/95 
 
 
 
 
 
including one patient in the Ptz+TCH arm who experienced symptomatic LVSD (assessed by 
Investigator as being NYHA Class II; NCI-CTCAE Grade 3).  
During the overall treatment period, the incidence of LVD (during the overall treatment period) was 
8.3% in the group treated with Perjeta plus trastuzumab and FEC (followed by Perjeta plus 
trastuzumab and docetaxel); 9.3% in the group treated with Perjeta plus trastuzumab and docetaxel 
following FEC; and 6.6% in the group treated with Perjeta in combination with TCH. The incidence of 
symptomatic LVD (congestive heart failure) was 1.3% in the group treated with Perjeta plus 
trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC (this excludes a patient who experienced symptomatic LVD 
during FEC treatment prior to receiving Perjeta plus trastuzumab and docetaxel) and also 1.3% in the 
group treated with Perjeta in combination with TCH. No patients in the group treated with Perjeta plus 
trastuzumab and FEC followed by Perjeta plus trastuzumab and docetaxel experienced symptomatic 
LVD (see SmPC section 4.8). 
The primary endpoints of study TRYPHAENA were: 
-  Incidence  of  symptomatic  cardiac  events  as  assessed  by  the  Investigator  (Grade  3,  4  or  5 
symptomatic LVSD) 
- Clinically significant LVEF declines over the course of the neoadjuvant period (LVEF decline of ≥10% 
from baseline and to a value of <50%) 
Following exposure to the study treatment, three patients (none in Arm A (Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D), 2 in 
Arm B (FEC/Ptz+T+D) and 1 in Arm C (Ptz+TCH)) experienced symptomatic LVSD. Only one of these 
events  occurred  in  the  neoadjuvant  treatment  period  (Arm  B)  during  FEC  treatment  and  prior  to 
pertuzumab,  and  a  single  event  presented  in  the  adjuvant  period  (Arm  C)  and  in  the  post-treatment 
follow-up period (Arm B). 
The majority of patients who experienced LVEF declines of at least 10%-points from baseline to below 
50% were observed on local readings (5 patients in Arm A, 9 patients in Arm B and 7 patients in Arm 
C). The central LVEF readings identified 4 patients (3 in Arm B and 1 in Arm C) with significant LVEF 
declines that were not identified on local readings. 
Nine  patients  (2  in  Arm  A,  5  in  Arm  B  and  2  in  Arm  C)  had  declines  in  LVEF  of  at  least  10%-points 
from  baseline to  below  50%,  during  the  post-treatment  follow-up  period.  One  of  these  9  patients  (in 
Arm  B)  had  experienced  an  LVEF  decline  during  the  adjuvant  treatment  period,  which  continued  into 
the  post-treatment  follow-up  period;  3  of  these  9  patients  (2  in  Arm  A  and  1  in  Arm  B)  had 
experienced a previous LVEF decline with recovery to ≥ 50% during study treatment.  
Mean  LVEF  dropped  to  below  baseline  during  treatment  in  all  three  treatment  arms,  however,  mean 
decreases were less than 5%-points in all cases, for values based on local readings and no more than 
8%-points  for  values  based  on  central  readings.  The  profile  for  mean  change  in  LVEF  from  baseline 
was similar in the three treatment arms. In general, the decline was greatest at Cycle 6.

Table 36: Total cardiac events during neoadjuvant, adjuvant and post treatment follow-up periods 
Overall, there were only very few cases of symptomatic LVSD, and no sign of any difference between 
the treatment arms.  There were slightly more patients with LVEF decline in Arm B (FEC/Ptz+T+D) and 
C (Ptz+TCH). 
Study CLEOPATRA 
Cardiac Events 
At  the  time  of  the  clinical  cutoff  of  14  May  2012,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  had  AEs  during  the 
study  treatment  period  in  the  SOC,  Cardiac  Disorders  was  comparable  between  treatment  arms 
(17.4%  of  patients  in  the  Pla+T+D  arm  vs.  15.4%  of  patients  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm),  despite  longer 
time on study treatment in the Ptz+T+D arm. LVD was the most common cardiac AE reported, with 34 
patients  (8.6%)  experiencing  LVD  AEs  in  the  Pla+T+D  arm,  and  22  patients  (5.4%)  in  the  Ptz+T+D 
arm. As seen in the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies, palpitations and tachycardia were the most 
frequently  reported  cardiac  AEs,  other  than  LVD.  The  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  Grade  ≥  3 
LVD (13 patients [3.3%] vs. 5 patients [1.2%]) was higher in the Pla+T+D arm vs. the Ptz+T+D arm, 
although  symptomatic  LVD  and  LVD  reported  as  an  SAE  was  balanced  between  the  two  treatment 
arms. The proportion of patients who experienced cardiac SAEs overall was also higher in the Pla+T+D 
arm (3.5% of patients) than in the Ptz+T+D arm (1.7% of patients). 
Overall, there were equal numbers of cardiac disorders in the two arms. However, the incidence of LVD 
during  study  treatment  was  higher  in  the  placebo-treated  group  than  in  the  Perjeta-treated  group 
(8.6%  and  5.4%,  respectively).  The  incidence  of  symptomatic  LVD  was  also  lower  in  the  Perjeta 
treated group (1.8% in the placebo-treated group vs. 1.2% in the Perjeta-treated group) (see section 
4.8).

TRYPHAENA and CLEOPATRA studies 
Infusion-related Reactions 
Study  NEOSPHERE:  The  overall  incidence  and  pattern  of  infusion-related  reactions  were  comparable 
between the pertuzumab containing arms. There were very few Grade 3 or 4 AEs. 
Study TRYPHAENA: More AEs were observed in Arm C (Ptz+TCH), but the number of Grade 3 or 4 AEs 
was comparable between the three arms.  
Study  CLEOPATRA:  The  overall  incidence  was  slightly  higher  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm,  and  only  1  Grade 
3/4  AE  was  observed  in  each  arm.  However,  the  incidence  of  infusion-related  reactions  was 
considerable higher in the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA compared to the CLEOPATRA study.

In the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA trials in the neoadjuvant setting, Perjeta was administered on the 
same day as the other study treatment drugs in all cycles. Overall, infusion reactions were consistent 
with those observed in CLEOPATRA at the cycles when Perjeta was given on the same day as 
trastuzumab and docetaxel, with a majority of reactions being mild or moderate (see SmPC section 
4.8). 
Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity 
Study NEOSPHERE: There were few cases of anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity. The majority of the AEs 
were Grade 1-2. Only three patients experienced a Grade 3 AE (2 AEs were attributed to docetaxel).  
Study  TRYPHAENA:  Only  1  AE  was  observed 
in  Arm  B 
(FEC/Ptz+T+D). 
In  Arm  A 
(Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D)  and  C  (Ptz+TCH)  comparable  numbers  were  observed  (7  (9.7%)  vs.  10 
(13.2%).  Patients  in  Arm  B  received  only  three  doses  of  pertuzumab  and  trastuzumab,  which  may 
explain the incidence rate.  
Study CLEOPATRA: The incidence was comparable between the two treatment arms, and the majority 
of cases were mild.  
In NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA trials in the neoadjuvant setting, hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis events 
were consistent with those observed in CLEOPATRA. In NEOSPHERE, two patients in the Perjeta and 
docetaxel-treated group experienced anaphylaxis. In TRYPHAENA, the overall frequency of 
hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis was highest in the Perjeta and TCH treated group (13.2%), of which 2.6% 
were NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 3-4 (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Leukopenia and Leukopenic Infection Events 
Study NEOSPHERE:  
The  overall  incidence  rate  of  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  was  comparable  between  Arm  A 
(T+D) and D (Ptz+D). The incidence rate was slightly lower in Arm B. There was only one event in Arm 
C (Ptz+T), which reflects the fact that these AEs are associated with chemotherapy. Only one patient, 
in  Arm  D,  discontinued  treatment.  Febrile  neutropenia  rates  were  similar  across  Arm  A  (T+D),  B 
(Ptz+T+  D)  and  D  (Ptz+D).  8.4%  of  patients  treated  with  neoadjuvant  Perjeta,  trastuzumab  and 
docetaxel  experienced  febrile  neutropenia  compared  with  7.5%  of  patients  treated  with  trastuzumab 
and docetaxel. There were few events of infections. 
As in the CLEOPATRA study, a higher incidence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia was observed 
among Asian patients compared with other patients in both neoadjuvant trials. In NEOSPHERE, 8.3% 
of Asian patients treated with neoadjuvant Perjeta, trastuzumab and docetaxel experienced febrile 
neutropenia compared with 4.0% of Asian patients treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab and 
docetaxel (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Study  TRYPHAENA:  The  overall  incidence  was  slightly  lower  in  Arm  B  (FEC/Ptz+T+D);  However,  the 
rate  of  neutropenia  was  comparable  across  the  three  arms.  Febrile  neutropenia  occurred  less 
frequently  in  Arm  B.  Febrile  neutropenia  occurred  in  17.1%  of  patients  treated  with  neoadjuvant 
Perjeta  +  TCH,  and  9.3%  of  patients  treated  with  neoadjuvant  Perjeta,  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel 
following  FEC.  The  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  was  higher  in  patients  who  received  six  cycles  of 
Perjeta compared with patients who received three cycles of Perjeta, independent of the chemotherapy 
given (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Study CLEOPATRA:  
The overall incidence was comparable between the two arms and the incidence of neutropenia and 
febrile neutropenia in the Ptz+T+D arm were comparable to the Ptz+T+D arm in the NEOSPHERE 
Assessment report

study. In conclusion, there is no indication of any excess cases of neutropenia or febrile neutropenia by 
adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting. 
Diarrhoea 
Study NEOSPHERE: In the neoadjuvant period, the incidence of diarrhoea was higher in the Ptz+T+D 
arm (85 episodes in 49 patients [45.8%]) and the Ptz+D arm (72 episodes in 51 patients [54.3%]) 
than in the T+D and Ptz+T arms (49 and 48 episodes in 36 patients [33.6%]) and 30 patients 
[27.8%], respectively. Overall, 51.4% of the patients in Arm B experienced diarrhoea. In Arm A and C 
the incidences were lower. Most events were mild to moderate in severity. The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 
AEs was low and comparable across treatment arms. 
Study TRYPHAENA: Diarrhoea was most common Arm C (Ptz+TCH) and in the neoadjuvant period, and 
less common in the adjuvant period. Diarrhoea occurred in 72.3% of patients treated with neoadjuvant 
Perjeta+TCH and 61.4% of patients treated with neoadjuvant Perjeta, trastuzumab and docetaxel 
following FEC. Most events were mild to moderate in severity (see SmPC section 4.8).  
Study CLEOPATRA: The incidence of diarrhoea was highest in the experimental (68.1%) arm and was 
often observed in the first cycle.  
In conclusion, the overall incidence rate of diarrhoea was lower in Arm B (Ptz+T+D) in the NEOSPHERE 
study compared to the experimental arm in the CLEOPATRA study, which is reassuring. 
Rash 
In the NEOSPHERE trial, rash occurred in 40.2% of patients treated with neoadjuvant Perjeta, 
trastuzumab and docetaxel compared with 29.0% of patients treated with trastuzumab and docetaxel. 
The overall incidence rate of Grade ≥ 3 AEs was low and comparable between the Arms A (T+D), B 
(Ptz+T+D) and D (Ptz+D), while it was even lower in Arm C (Ptz+T).  
In the TRYPHAENA trial, rash occurred in 36.8% of patients treated with neoadjuvant Perjeta + TCH 
and 20.0% of patients treated with neoadjuvant Perjeta, trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC. 
The incidence of rash was higher in patients who received six cycles of Perjeta compared with patients 
who received three cycles of Perjeta, independent of the chemotherapy given. 
These results were comparable with the experimental arm in the CLEOPATRA  study, which suggested 
that there is no increased risk of adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting. 
Mucositis 
In  NEOSPHERE,  mucositis  was  common  during  the  neoadjuvant  and  adjuvant  treatment  periods 
(33.6%  and  24.3%  of  patients  in  the  T+D  arm,  45.8%  and  30.4%  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm,  9.3%  and 
39.4%  in  the  Ptz+T  arm  and  43.6%  and  25.0%  in  the  Ptz+D  arm  respectively).  Only  2  patients 
experienced Grade ≥ 3 mucositis (1 in the Ptz+T+D arm and 1 in the Ptz+D arm). 
Overall, 46.7% of patients in the T+D arm, 54.2% in the Ptz+T+D arm, 38.9% in the Ptz+T arm and 
50.0% in the Ptz+D arm experienced mucositis, but only 4 patients experienced Grade > 3 mucositis 
at any time (3 in the Ptz+T+D arm and 1 in the Ptz+D arm). 
During the neoadjuvant period, 45.8% of patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 41.3% of patients 
in  the  FEC/Ptz+T+D  arm  and  34.2%  of  patients  in  the  Ptz+TCH  arm  experienced  mucositis 
(t_ae15_muc_neo). Most of these were Grade 1-2 in severity. Only 1, 2  and  1 patient experienced a 
Grade  3  mucositis  event  in  the  Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D,  FEC/Ptz+T+D  and  Ptz+TCH  arms,  respectively. 
Assessment report

As in the NEOSPHERE study, mucosal inflammation and stomatitis were the most frequently reported 
events 
Mucositis is a common AESI, and most frequently observed in the experimental arm of the CLEOPATRA 
study,  when  comparing  all  three  studies.  This  AE  occurred  much  less  frequently  in  the  Ptz+T  arm  of 
the NEOSPHERE study, thus indicating that it is closely associated with chemotherapy.  
Interstitial Lung Disease 
Very few and sporadic cases were observed. No firm conclusions can be drawn.  
Hepatic Disorders 
Very  few  cases  were  observed  in  the  NEOSPHERE  and  TRYPHAENA  studies.  One  patient  in  the 
TRYPHAENA  study  withdrew  from  treatment  due  to  Grade  2  ASAT,  Grade  3  ALAT  and  Grade  3  GGT 
abnormalities. Event rates were low and comparable in the CLEOPATRA study. However, one event of 
fulminant  hepatitis  had  a  fatal  outcome  (please  see  under  “Deaths”).    It  is  difficult  to  draw  any 
conclusions, but pertuzumab does not seem to have hepatotoxic effects when added to trastuzumab in 
the neoadjuvant setting. 
Venous Thromboembolic Events 
As of the clinical cutoff date of 12 July 2013 in the NEOSPHERE study, 4 patients (1.0%) experienced 
VTEs during the study overall: 2 in the Ptz+T+D arm (1.9% of patients) and 2 in the Ptz+D arm (2.1% 
of patients), one of which was Grade > 3. Two of these events were reported in the neoadjuvant 
period and 2 in the adjuvant period.  
In the TRYPHAENA study, overall, 4 patients (1.8%) experienced VTEs in the TRYPHAENA study; 3 
patients in the neoadjuvant period (2 patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 1 patient in the 
Ptz+TCH arm) and 1 patient in the adjuvant period (in the FEC/Ptz+T+D). 
VTE occurred more frequently in the experimental arm in the CLEOPATRA study. However, only very 
few cases have been observed in the two neoadjuvant studies to draw any conclusions. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
In  the  neoadjuvant  period  one  patient  died  (NEOSPHERE)  of  fulminant  hepatitis.  This  patient  had  a 
history  of  obesity,  diabetes  and  hypertension,  and  was  being  treated  for  these  conditions.  However, 
the patient was admitted to a local hospital and no liver biopsy nor hepatitis serology were performed. 
Also,  no  autopsy  was  performed.  Furthermore,  there  are  also  uncertainties  with  regard  to  the 
treatment received at the local hospital. Hepatic failure was not observed in the experimental arm of 
the CLEOPATRA study.  
The  other  two  deaths  in  the  neoadjuvant  period  in  the  NEOSPHERE  study  were  due  to  PD  and 
metastases. 
There were no non-PD deaths in the TRYPHAENA study and 6 non-PD deaths in the NEOSPHERE study. 
Four cases had “unknown” reason and two cases were due to primary colorectal cancer. 
In  the  post-treatment  follow-up  period,  25  (NEOSPHERE)  and  12  (TRYPHAENA)  deaths  occurred.  The 
majority  of  deaths  were  assessed  as  unrelated  or  “not  known”  in  relation  to  trial  treatment.  In  the 
NEOSPHERE  follow  up  treatment  period the  MAH  did  not  report the  cause of death  for 4  patients  but 
classified the events as not related to study treatment.

Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
Study NEOSPHERE 
During the neoadjuvant period, the incidence of SAEs was broadly comparable in the T+D arm, 
Ptz+T+D arm and the Ptz+D arm (15-20 SAEs per arm in 10%-17% of patients), and lowest in the 
Ptz+T arm (4 SAEs, 4% of patients). The most frequently reported SAEs in the T+D arm, Ptz+T+D 
arm and the Ptz+D arm were neutropenia and febrile neutropenia; however SAEs occurred across 
multiple body systems, with no marked difference in incidence between any of these arms. One patient 
in the Ptz+T+D arm experienced an SAE of fulminant hepatitis that was fatal. One patient in the Ptz+T 
arm experienced an SAE of congestive cardiac failure in the neoadjuvant. 
During the adjuvant period, the incidence of SAEs was highest in the Ptz+T arm (18.1%). Most of the 
SAEs in the Ptz+T arm were events known to be associated with docetaxel (neutropenia, febrile 
neutropenia and neutropenic infection); therefore, the higher incidence in the Ptz+T arm was likely 
due to the administration of docetaxel during the adjuvant period in this arm (all other arms received 
docetaxel in the neoadjuvant period only). SAEs that occurred in > 1 patient in any treatment arm 
included febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, pyrexia and LVD. 
Following completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, a total of 10 patients experienced SAEs during 
adjuvant trastuzumab (4 [3.9%] in the Ptz+T+D arm, 5 [5.3%] in the Ptz+T arm and 1 [1.1%] in the 
Ptz+D arm), all of which resolved with no sequelae. 
During  the  post-treatment  follow-up  period,  1  patient  in  the  Ptz+D  arm  experienced  an  SAE  of 
myeloproliferative  disorder.  The  event  was  considered  possibly  related  to  study  treatment  (epirubicin 
and cyclophosphamide), and remained unresolved at the time of the clinical cutoff date. 
Study TRYPHAENA 
The incidence of SAEs during the neoadjuvant period was highest in the Ptz+TCH arm (36%), followed 
by the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm (28%) and then the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm (20%). The most common 
SAE was febrile neutropenia, and this was lower in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm (5%) than in the 
Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and Ptz+TCH arm (14% and 15%, respectively). Diarrhea SAEs were 
reported in 1%, 4% and 5% of patients, and neutropenia in 3%, 4% and 1% of patients, in the 
Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D, FEC/Ptz+T+D and Ptz+TCH arms, respectively. All other events occurred in only 
one or two patients in any arm. 
A total of 5 patients experienced cardiac disorder SAEs. These included: 3 reports of LVD (1 in the 
Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm; 2 in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm) and one report each of cardiovascular disorder 
and conduction disorder in the Ptz+TCH arm.   
In the adjuvant period, 5 patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm (7.4%), 4 patients in the 
FEC/Ptz+T+D arm (6.2%) and 6 patients (9.0%) in the Ptz+TCH arm experienced at least one SAE. 
Apart from pneumonia, which occurred in two patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, all events 
occurred in single patients. There was one cardiac disorder: symptomatic LVSD NYHA Class I reported 
one patient in the Ptz+TCH arm. 
Two  patients,  both  in  the  FEC/Ptz+T+D  arm,  experienced  SAEs  assessed  as  treatment-related  in  the 
post-treatment  follow-up  period  at  the  time  of  the  clinical  cutoff  of  22  July  2013.  One  patient 
experienced  NYHA  Class  II  symptomatic  LVSD  (NCI-CTCAE  Grade  3)  which  later  improved  and  one 
patient,  who  received  docetaxel  in  the  post-treatment  follow-up  period,  experienced  Grade  4 
neutropenia (this event lasted 3 days, and had resolved at the last assessment). 
Study CLEOPATRA 
Assessment report

The incidence of SAEs was higher in the Ptz+T+D arm (36.3%) than in the Pla+T+D arm (29.0%). 
Serious adverse events in the SOC, Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders were the most frequently 
reported SAEs in both treatment arms; these occurred more frequently in the Ptz+T+D arm than in 
the Pla+T+D arm (15.9% vs. 10.6%, respectively). The difference between the two treatment arms 
was mainly due to a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia in the Ptz+T+D arm (11.3% of patients) 
compared with the Pla+T+D arm (5.1% of patients). 
The next most frequently reported SOC was Infections and Infestations. Events in this class were also 
more common in the Ptz+T+D arm (11.8% of patients) than in the Pla+T+D arm (8.6% of patients). 
However, no single event accounted for the difference in incidence between the two arms. 
Although the incidence of Gastrointestinal Disorder SAEs was balanced between the two treatment 
arms, SAEs of diarrhea were more common in the Ptz+T+D arm (3.2% of patients) than in the 
Pla+T+D arm (1.3% of patients). General Disorders and Administration Site SAEs were more frequent 
in the Ptz+T+D arm (3.4% of patients) compared with the Pla+T+D arm (2.3% of patients). 
Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders were also more frequent in the Ptz+T+D arm (3.2% 
of patients) compared with the Pla+T+D arm (2.3% of patients). However, the difference between the 
arms was small (< 2.0%) in both cases, and no clear difference in any individual event was observed. 
The proportion of patients who experienced Cardiac Disorder SAEs was higher in the Pla+T+D arm 
(3.5% of patients) than in the Ptz+T+D arm (1.7% of patients). 
Laboratory findings 
Study NEOSPHERE 
Overall,  the  most  common  laboratory  abnormalities  were  decreased  neutrophil,  total  WBC  and 
lymphocytes.  Grade  3-4  neutropenia  was  more  common  in  Arms  A  (T+D)  and  C  (Ptz+T),  while 
occurring with a slightly lower frequency in Arm B (Ptz+T+D). The incidence of NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 
3-4  neutropenia  was  74.5%  in  patients  treated  with  neoadjuvant  Perjeta,  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel 
compared with 84.5% in patients treated with trastuzumab and docetaxel, including 50.9% and 60.2% 
Grade 4 neutropenia, respectively (see SmPC section 4.8). The addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab 
in the neoadjuvant period did not lead to an unexpected increase in laboratory abnormalities. 
With regard to biochemistry (ASAT, LDH, ALP, ALAT, bilirubin and creatinine) the pattern in shifts was 
comparable between the arms that included docetaxel. Most of the shifts were Grade 1-2. There were 
some shifts in calcium levels from Grade 0 to Grade 4 (mostly decreased calcium) and increased uric 
acid, which are some of the indicators for increased cell turnover. This could cause acute renal failure, 
but there was no indication of that, when looking at the creatinine levels or the overall AE profile.  
There was one patient who fulfilled Hy’s law but no firm conclusion can be drawn. 
Study TRYPHAENA 
The  most  common  AEs  were  decreased  neutrophil and total WBC counts. Grade 3-4 neutropenia was 
most frequently observed in Arm A (Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D). The incidence of NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 3-4 
neutropenia  was  85.3%  in  patients  treated  with  neoadjuvant  Perjeta  +  TCH  and  77.0%  in  patients 
treated  with  neoadjuvant  Perjeta,  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel  following  FEC,  including  66.7%  and 
59.5% Grade 4 neutropenia, respectively. 
Balanced  shift  were  observed  across  treatment  arms  with  regard  to  the  biochemistry  data.  Also 
increased uric acid levels were observed, indicating increased cell turnover.

Vital signs 
There were no unexpected findings in the two neoadjuvant trials. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors 
Age 
The  number  of  patients  over  65  years  in  the  two  neoadjuvant  trials  was  too  small  to  draw  any 
meaningful conclusion.  
Race 
NEOSPHERE 
The  only  reasonable  comparison  was  between  white  and  Asian  patients.  Asian  patients  had 
(independent  of  treatment  arm)  a  higher  incidence  of  Grade  ≥  3  AEs,  SAEs,  AEs  leading  to  dose 
interruption/modification, leukopenia, diarrhoea, rash and mucositis. 
TRYPHAENA 
Asian  patients  had  also  in  this  study  a  higher  incidence  of  Grade  ≥  3  AEs,  leukopenia,  diarrhea  and 
rash. The most apparent difference is seen leukopenia; 87.5% (Asian) vs. 54.4% (white). 
Extrinsic factors 
Region 
NEOSPHERE:  Since  the  only  reasonable  comparison  was  between  Europe  and  Asia,  the  same  AE 
pattern as in the assessment of AEs based on “race” is observed.  
TRYPHAENA:  There  were  too  few  non-Europeans  to  make  any  reasonable  comparison  between 
different regions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study NEOSPHERE 
During the neoadjuvant period, 7 patients (0 in the T+D arm, 2 [1.9%] in Ptz+T+D arm, 3 [2.8%] in 
the Ptz+T arm and 2 [2.1%] in the Ptz+D arm) discontinued from any study treatment because of 
AEs. Two patients discontinued docetaxel due to drug hypersensitivity (one in the Ptz+T+D arm and 
one in the Ptz+T arm). In the Ptz+T arm, one patient withdrew from all medication due to CHF and 
one patient withdrew from all medication due to pregnancy. In the Ptz+D arm, one withdrew from 
pertuzumab and docetaxel due to neutropenia, and one patient who discontinued due to ulcerative 
colitis, had received all cycles of pertuzumab and all 21 cycles of trastuzumab but had not started any 
cycles of FEC. All AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were considered possibly related to 
treatment, with the exception of the ulcerative colitis, which was assessed as unrelated by the 
investigators. 
During the adjuvant period, a total of 10 patients (0 in the T+D arm, 3 in the Ptz+T+D arm, 5 in the 
Ptz+T arm and 2 in the Ptz+D arm) discontinued from any study treatment because of AEs during the 
adjuvant period. The AEs leading to discontinuation of study medication included: LVD (2 patients) and 
abdominal strangulated hernia in the Ptz+T+D arm; asthenia, chest discomfort, drug hypersensitivity 
(2 patients) and septic shock in the Ptz+T arm; and LVD (2 patients) in the Ptz+T arm. Four patients 
(2 in the Ptz+T+D arm and 2 in the Ptz+D arm) discontinued from a study treatment during adjuvant 
trastuzumab treatment after adjuvant chemotherapy.

Study TRYPHAENA 
Both  in  the  neoadjuvant  and  adjuvant  period  very  few  patients  discontinued  treatment  (4  patients 
[5.6%],  5  patients  [6.7%]  and  6  patients  [7.9%]  in  the  Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D,  FEC/Ptz+T+D  and 
Ptz+TCH  arms,  respectively  in  the  neadjuvant  period).  Pertuzumab  seemed  to  be  well-tolerated 
irrespective of backbone chemotherapy (antracycline vs. non-antracycline). 
Adverse Events That Led to Dose Modification or Interruption 
Study NEOSPHERE 
During the neoadjuvant period, the number of patients who experienced an AE that required treatment 
interruption or modification was highest in the Ptz+D arm (43.6%) and lowest in the Ptz+T arm 
(14.8%) and was comparable between the T+D arm and Ptz+T+D arm (34.6% and 32.7% 
respectively). The most frequently reported AEs (in at least 5 patients in each arm) requiring dose 
modification were: neutropenia (in 9.3%, 5.6%, 0.9% and 16% of patients in the T+D, Ptz+T+D, 
Ptz+T and Ptz+D arms, respectively); infusion-associated reaction (in 4.7%, 3.7%, 2.8% and 4.3% of 
patients in the T+D, Ptz+T+D, Ptz+T and Ptz+D arms, respectively); diarrhea (in 0.9%, 7.5%, 0% 
and 4.3% of patients in the T+D, Ptz+T+D, Ptz+T, and Ptz+D arms, respectively); febrile neutropenia 
(in 6.5%, 3.7%, 0% and 4.3% of patients in the T+D, Ptz+T+D, Ptz+T and Ptz+D arms, respectively); 
and drug hypersensitivity (in 0.9%, 1.9%, 4.6% and 4.3% of patients in the T+D, Ptz+T+D, Ptz+T 
and Ptz+D arms, respectively). 
Three patients in the Ptz+T+D arm experienced LVD leading to dose modification during the 
neoadjuvant period. All 3 events were assessed as possibly related to study treatment, and resolved 
without sequelae. 
During the adjuvant period, the incidence of AEs leading to dose interruption or modification of any 
study treatment was slightly higher in the Ptz+T arm compared with the other treatment arms (32.0% 
in the T+D arm, 34.3% in the Ptz+T+D arm, 43.6% in the Ptz+T arm and 37.5% in the Ptz+D arm), 
as would be expected since patients in this treatment arm received 3 cycles of docetaxel (in addition to 
3 cycles of FEC) during the adjuvant period (all other arms received docetaxel in the neoadjuvant 
period only). The most frequently reported AEs leading to dose interruption or modification were 
similar to those reported in the neoadjuvant period. 
Study TRYPHAENA 
During the neoadjuvant period, a total of 36.1% patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 29.3% of 
patients in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, and 50.0% of patients in the Ptz+TCH arm experienced an AE that 
required treatment modification or interruption in the neoadjuvant period. Dose modifications were 
common in all treatment arms, and were primarily performed in order  to manage Blood and 
Lymphatic System Disorders. Neutropenia was the single most reported event leading to dose 
modification (between 14%-15% of patients). In the Ptz+TCH arm, anemia (21% of patients) and 
thrombocytopenia (16%) were also common AEs leading to dose modification. Investigations (for 
laboratory abnormalities) also led to dose modification in 11% of patients in the Ptz+TCH arm. 
Compared with the neoadjuvant period, fewer patients experienced AEs leading to dose modification (8 
patients [11.8%] in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 11 patients [16.9%] in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 
4 patients [6.0%] in the Ptz+TCH arm) in the adjuvant period. This is to be expected since most 
patients received only adjuvant trastuzumab during this period and dose reductions were not 
permitted.

Study CLEOPATRA 
As of the clinical data cutoff (14 May 2012), the incidence of AEs leading to interruption or dose 
modification of any of the three study medications was higher in the Ptz+T+D arm (252 patients 
[61.8%]) compared with the Pla+T+D arm (215 patients [54.3%]). The difference in overall incidence 
between treatment arms was due to a range of events in different body systems. There were more AEs 
of febrile neutropenia (20 patients in the Pla+T+D arm [5.1%] vs. 31 patients in the Ptz+T+D arm 
[7.6%]), hypersensitivity (9 patients Pla+T+D [2.3%] vs. 18 patients Ptz+T+D [4.4%]) and diarrhea 
(7 patients Pla+T+D [1.8%] vs. 23 patients Ptz+T+D [5.6%]) that led to dose modification in the 
Ptz+T+D arm compared with the Pla+T+D arm. Conversely, there were more AEs of LVD leading to 
interruption or dose modification in the Pla+T+D arm (11 patients [2.8%]) compared with the 
Ptz+T+D arm (5 patients [1.2%]). 
Adverse drug reactions 
The integrated safety database has been updated to include data from the TRYPHAENA study and 
updated data from the NEOSPHERE and CLEOPATRA studies. The integrated safety database now 
contains data for 1631 patients exposed to pertuzumab in 15 studies. Updated analyses based on 
these pooled data were provided and results of these analyses were consistent with the previous 
pooled analyses and with the NEOSPHERE, TRYPHAENA and CLEOPATRA safety data reported in above, 
with no new or unexpected findings. No new ADRs have been identified from the NEOSPHERE or 
TRYPHAENA studies. Pooled data from the overall treatment period in CLEOPATRA (data cutoff 11 
February 2014; median number of cycles of Perjeta was 24); and from the neoadjuvant treatment 
period in NEOSPHERE (median number of cycles of Perjeta was 4, across all treatment arms) and 
TRYPHAENA (median number of cycles of Perjeta was 3 – 6 across treatment arms) have been 
provided. On this basis, the frequencies of the following ADRs have been revised from very common to 
common: Peripheral sensory neuropathy, Dizziness, Lacrimation increased, Dyspnoea, Pruritus and Dry 
skin (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Post marketing experience 
Pertuzumab (Perjeta) in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the first-line treatment of 
patients with HER2-positive MBC was first approved in the US on 08 June 2012. Subsequently, it was 
approved in the EU and many other countries for the treatment of MBC, and in the US, Chile and Peru 
for the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with earlier stages of disease. 
This section summarizes the post-marketing experience with pertuzumab on the basis of safety data 
contained in the second Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER), which covers the reporting 
interval 8 June 2013 to 7 December 2013. The estimated total cumulative exposure to pertuzumab via 
company-sponsored or development partner-sponsored studies or through commercially available 
product since the Development International Birth Date (DIBD; 11 September 2001) until the Data 
Lock Point (DLP) for the second PBRER (7 December 2013) was 17,077 patients worldwide, including 
approximately 11,346 patients exposed to commercially obtained drug.

2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  of  Perjeta  has  been  evaluated  in  more  than  1,600  patients  in  the  randomized  trials 
CLEOPATRA  (n=808),  NEOSPHERE  (n=417)  and  TRYPHAENA  (n=225)  and  in  phase  I  and  II  trials 
conducted in patients with various malignancies and predominantly treated with Perjeta in combination 
with other antineoplastic agents. 
The duration of the exposure of patients in the two neoadjuvant studies is limited, while patients in the 
CLEOPATRA  study  have  a  much  higher  exposure.  Although  the  patient  population  enrolled  in  the 
CLEOPATRA  study  had  more  advanced  disease  than  patients  in  the  NEOSPHERE  and  TRYPHAENA 
studies,  protocol  entry  criteria  were  otherwise  very  similar  between  the  three  studies.  Importantly, 
most patients in the CLEOPATRA study received much more treatment with pertuzumab in combination 
with trastuzumab and docetaxel than would be given in the neoadjuvant setting. Thus, the CLEOPATRA 
study  is  more  likely  to  have  revealed  any  safety  issues  with  this  combination  regimen  than  the  two 
neoadjuvant  studies,  in  which  treatment  duration  was  relatively  short.  With  a  median  time  on  study 
(including follow-up) greater than two years for patients in the CLEOPATRA study, there has also been 
sufficient follow-up for any delayed and/or cumulative toxicity to have emerged.  
There  is  no  safety  data  available  on  the  continued  use  of  Perjeta  for  more  than  6  cycles  in  the 
neoadjuvant setting (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Overall, the safety of Perjeta in Phase I and II studies was generally consistent with that observed in 
the  CLEOPATRA,  NEOSPHERE  and  TRYPHAENA  trials,  although  the  incidence  and  most  common 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) varied depending on whether perjeta was administered as monotherapy 
or with concomitant anti-neoplastic agents (see SmPC section 4.8). 
In general, in all three studies, the most common adverse events were leukopenia, rash and diarrhoea.  
In the NEOSPHERE study, it is observed that AEs are more likely in Arm B (Ptz+T+D). These AEs were 
mostly  related  to  gastrointestinal,  skin  and  subcutaneous,  blood  and  lymphatic  and  musculoskeletal 
disorders.  The  interesting  comparison  is  between  Arm  A  (T+D)  and  Arm  B  (Ptz+T+D),  and  the  only 
major difference was seen in gastrointestinal disorders, 61.7% vs. 79.4%. 
The most frequent AEs reported in Study NEOSPHERE were neutropenia, diarrhoea, alopecia and rash. 
In  Arm  C  (T+Ptz)  there  were  only  two  cases  of  alopecia  and  neutropenia.  When  comparing  Arm  A 
(T+D) with Arm D (Ptz+D) almost an identical safety profile was observed, except for diarrhoea, which 
was more common in Arm D. Thus, pertuzumab by itself may lead to a higher risk of diarrhoea, which 
is manageable in the clinical setting.  
Overall, there were no unacceptable additional toxicities by adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab in the 
neoadjuvant  setting.  The  safety  profile  was  slightly  altered  in  the  adjuvant  setting  compared  to  the 
neoadjuvant  setting.  Nausea,  neutropenia,  vomiting,  fatigue  and  diarrhoea  were  the  most  frequent 
AEs.  Alopecia  was  almost  absent  in  Arm  A  (T+D),  B  (Ptz+T+D)  and  D  (Ptz+D),  while  59.6%  of  the 
patients  in  Arm  C  (T+Ptz)  experienced  it.  The  safety  profile  of  Arm  B  (Ptz+T+D)  is  considered 
manageable. 
The majority of Grade ≥ 3 AEs occurred in the blood and lymphatic system, with more AEs in Arms A 
and D in the NEOSPHERE study, but the risk of febrile neutropenia seems to be similar in all treatment 
arms.  Neutropenia  is  a  well-known  and  well-characterised  Adverse  Events  of  Special  Interest  (AESI) 
already addressed in the SmPC. 
In  the  TRYPHAENA  study,  the  most  frequent  AEs  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  in  Arm  A 
(Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D)  and  B  (FEC/Ptz+T+D)  were  similar  to  the  safety  profile  in  adjuvant  setting  in

the  NEOSPHERE  study,  which  is  not  surprising  since  FEC  was  administered  to  the  patients.  In  Arm  C 
(Ptz+TCH), 
where 
patients 
received 
the 
non-anthracycline 
regimen 
(docetaxel+carboplatin+trastuzumab +pertuzumab) patients experienced more myelotoxic related AEs 
(anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, etc.), due to the toxic effects of carboplatin and docetaxel 
on  the  bone  marrow.  However,  all these  AEs  are  clinically  manageable  and  do  not lead to  any  major 
concerns. 
All patients received trastuzumab up to 1 year in the adjuvant setting. AEs occurred less frequently in 
the  non-anthracycline  arm 
(Arm  C).  There  were  slight  differences  between  Arm  A 
(Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D)  and  B  (FEC/Ptz+T+D),  except  for  a  relevant  difference  in  upper  respiratory 
tract  infections  (2  (2.9%)  vs.  8  (12.3%).  However,  all  events  were  mild  to  moderate  and  they  all 
resolved. 
Overall, there seemed to be fewer Grade ≥ 3 AEs in Arm B (FEC/Ptz+T+D) in the TRYPHAENA study, 
but the incidence of AEs was more or less comparable. The predominant AEs were within the blood and 
lymphatic system. There were slightly more Grade 4 AEs in Arm C (Ptz+TCH), mostly in the “blood and 
lymphatic  system  disorders”  SOC  with  predominantly  neutropenia.  This  is  a  well-known  risk  of 
chemotherapy and it is clinically manageable. There were no Grade 5 AEs. 
In the CLEOPATRA study, the AE profile of Ptz+T+D in the metastatic breast cancer (MBC) resembled 
the profile of Arm B (Ptz+T+D) in the neoadjuvant setting in early breast cancer. However, patients in 
the MBC setting received 6 cycles of docetaxel, while patients in the NEOSPHERE study received only 4 
cycles, which may explain some of the differences. Patients in the MBC setting were also heavily pre-
treated  compared  to  the  treatment  naïve  patients  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting.  The  only  major 
difference was diarrhoea, which occurred more often in the MBC setting. Overall, the safety profile of 
pertuzumab is comparable between the neoadjuvant and MBC setting. 
With regard to AESI, there were slightly more cardiac disorders in Arm B (Ptz+T+D) in the 
NEOSPHERE study. Overall, the incidence of LVD was higher in the pertuzumab–treated groups than in 
those who did not receive pertuzumab in the NEOSPHERE study (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Although there were more cases of LVD in the Ptz+T+D arm, these were only Grade 3, asymptomatic 
and in some cases seen in patients with cardiac risk factors. An increased incidence of LVEF declines 
was also observed in patients treated with pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and 
docetaxel. LVEF recovered to ≥50% in all patients (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). LVEF should be 
assessed prior to initiation of pertuzumab and during treatment with Perjeta (every 3 cycles in the 
metastatic setting and every 2 cycles in the neoadjuvant setting) to ensure that LVEF is within the 
institution’s normal limits (see SmPC section 4.4). 
The primary safety endpoint in the TRYPHAENA study concerned cardiac safety. There were only very 
few cases of symptomatic LVSD, and there was no sign of any difference between the treatment arms.  
There  were  slightly  more  patients  with  LVEF  decline  in  Arm  B  (FEC/Ptz+T+D)  and  C  (Ptz+TCH).  One 
patient  had  a  prior  history  of  myocardial  ischemia,  which  may  have  contributed  to  the  LVSD  during 
administration  of  pertuzumab  in  the  neoadjuvant  period.  There  were  too  few  events  to  draw  any 
conclusions. Very few patients discontinued treatment due to cardiac events. 
A direct comparison may not be appropriate since the patient populations differ, etc., but nonetheless 
the frequency of LVSD, Grade ≥ 3 LVSD, LVEF decline and CHF, seemed to be comparable between the 
Ptz+T+D arm in the NEOSPHERE study and the experimental arm Ptz+T+D in the CLEOPATRA study, 
with  only  slight  differences.  Thus,  the  use  of  pertuzumab  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  did  not  lead  to 
excess of cardiac toxicity. This is also supported by results from the TRYPHAENA study.

Left  ventricular  dysfunction  is  a  well-known  risk  that  is  clearly  described  in  the  SmPC  for  the  use  of 
pertuzumab in the metastatic setting, and is clinically manageable. Nevertheless, the long-term cardiac 
safety  of  pertuzumab  in  the  neoadjuvant  phase  is  considered  incompletely  characterized  at  present. 
The study APHINITY, BERENICE and the final analysis of TRYPHAENA should provide further evidence 
with regard to this safety concern (see RMP).   
With regard to the remaining AESI, the incidence of infusion-related reactions was considerable higher 
in  the  NEOSPHERE  and  TRYPHAENA  compared  to  the  CLEOPATRA  study.  However,  Infusion  reactions 
were consistent with those observed in CLEOPATRA at the cycles when Perjeta was given on the same 
day  as  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel,  with  a  majority  of  reactions  being  mild  or  moderate  (see  SmPC 
section 4.8). 
Rash  rates  were  higher  in  pertuzumab  containing  arms  in  the  NEOSPHERE  study  and  an  additional 
effect was noted with Docetaxel. In the TRYPHAENA study, Ptz and TCH had the worst effect on rash 
rates (see SmPC section 4.8). Regarding leukopenia, a similar rate of leukopenia events was reported 
in  chemotherapy  containing  regimens  with  a  lower  incidence  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm  in  the  NEOSPHERE 
study.  A  slightly  higher  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  was  observed  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm  however 
very  few  infections  were  reported  indicating  that  the  episodes  were  clinically  manageable.  In  the 
TRYPHAENA  study  a  lower  rate  of  leukopenic  events  and  in  particular  of  febrile  neutropenia  was 
reported in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm when compared with the same regimen given longer or to TCH (see 
SmPC section 4.8). 
Diarrhoea  was  confirmed  as  one  of  the  most  common  AE  reported  in  Ptz  containing  regimens.  In 
particular the rate was higher in the Ptz+T+D arm of the NEOSPHERE study and in the TCH+Ptz arm of 
the  TRYPHAENA  study.  However,  only  a  minority  of  episodes  were  of  severe  grade  and  none  lead  to 
treatment discontinuation (see SmPC section 4.8).  
Overall,  there  is  no  indication  of  any  excess  cases  of  diarrhoea,  rash,  mucositis,  interstitial  lung 
disease,  hepatic  disorders,  VTEs,  neutropenia  or  febrile  neutropenia  by  adding  pertuzumab  to 
trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting.  
In  the  NEOSPHERE  study,  most  SAEs  occurred  in  Arm  A  (T+D)  and  D  (Ptz+D)  in  the  neoadjuvant 
period.  Most  frequent  SAEs  in  all  treatment  arms  were  neutropenia  and  febrile  neutropenia.  The 
pattern of SAE was comparable to the experimental arm in the CLEOPATRA study. In the neoadjuvant 
period  the  TRYPHAENA  study,  most  SAEs  occurred  in  the  non-anthracycline  arm  (Arm  C  (Ptz+TCH)). 
Across all three arms, diarrhoea, neutropenia and gastrointestinal disorders occurred most frequently. 
All are reflected in the SmPC (see SmPC section 4.8).  Very few SAEs were observed in the adjuvant 
and post-treatment follow-up period in the TRYPHAENA study. 
Overall,  the  addition  of  pertuzumab  to  trastuzumab  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  did  not  lead  to  any 
unexpected  safety  findings  in  the  NEOSPHERE  study.  This  is  supported  by  the  results  of  the 
TRYPHAENA  study  and  the  CLEOPATRA  study.  The  TRYPHAENA  study  also  provided  evidence  with 
regard to cardiac toxicity. There is currently no indication of any concerning differences in tolerability 
by adding pertuzumab + trastuzumab to anthracyclines or carboplatin in the neoadjuvant period.  
However, cardiac risk should be carefully considered and balanced against the medical need of the 
individual patient before use of Perjeta with an anthracycline. There are limited safety data available 
from the TRYPHAENA study concerning sequential or concomitant administration of Perjeta with 
epirubicin, as part of the FEC regimen (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). There are no safety data available 
concerning use of Perjeta with doxorubicin. 
Assessment report

Based on the pharmacological actions of pertuzumab and anthracyclines an increased risk of cardiac 
toxicity might be expected from concomitant use of these agents compared with sequential, although 
not seen in the TRYPHAENA study. In this study, only chemotherapy-naive subjects, not receiving 
additional chemotherapy after surgery, were treated with low cumulative dose of epirubicin, i.e. up to 
300 mg/m2 (see SmPC section 4.4). 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall,  the  observed  adverse  events  are  well-characterised,  clinically  manageable  and  adequately 
reflected  in  the  SmPC.  However,  long-term  cardiac  toxicity  is  incompletely  characterized  at  present 
and  requires  follow-up.  Thus,  the  following  post-authorisation  safety  study  has  been  included  as 
condition in Annex II: 
Post-authorisation safety study (PASS): 
May 2017 
In order to evaluate cardiac safety and provide further efficacy data in the 
neoadjuvant setting, the MAH should submit the results of study WO29217 
(BERENICE), a multicentre, multinational, Phase II study to evaluate pertuzumab in 
combination with trastuzumab and standard neoadjuvant anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, or 
early-stage breast cancer. 
In addition, safety data from the study APHINITY and the final analysis of TRYPHAENA are expected to 
provide further evidence with regard to this safety concern as reflected in the Risk Management Plan. 
2.5.6.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 3.3 could be acceptable if the applicant

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, changes are proposed to sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 
5.2 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make a correction in sections 2 and 6.6 of the SmPC 
regarding the dose contained in 1 ml of solution after dilution. 14 ml  of Perjeta concentrate should be 
withdrawn from the vial and diluted into a 250 ml PVC or non-PVC polyolefin infusion bag of sodium

chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. After dilution, one ml of solution should contain 
approximately 3.02 mg of pertuzumab (840 mg/278 ml) for the initial dose where two vials are 
required and approximately 1.59 mg of pertuzumab (420 mg/264 ml) for the maintenance dose where 
one vial is required.  
This change was accepted by the CHMP. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The NEOSPHERE study showed a statistically significant and clinically relevant result with regard to 
pCR rate. The bpCR rate was 29% versus 45.8% in T+D arm and Ptz+T+D arm respectively. The tpCR 
(ypT0/is N0) rates showed the same pattern with a 17.8% difference in favour of the Ptz+T+D arm 
(39.3%) compared to the Ptz+T arm (21.5%). 
These results are supported by the findings in the TRYPHAENA study, where pCR was a secondary 
endpoint. In this study, the reported pCR rates were 61.6%, 57.3%, 66.2% in the 
Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, FEC/Ptz+T+F arm and Ptz+TCH arm respectively. 
Supportive evidence of efficacy is provided by the CLEOPATRA study in the metastatic setting. In this 
study, the improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in the pertuzumab arm was statistically 
significant [HR, 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.51–0.75; p< 0.0001, log-rank test]. Moreover, a 
statistically significant improvement in OS of 15.7 months was observed in the 
pertuzumab+trastuzumab+docetaxel arm versus the placebo+trastuzumab+docetaxel arm with a HR 
of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.56-0.84; p=0.0002). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  magnitude  of  the  effect  in  terms  of  DFS/OS  cannot  be  estimated  from  the  observed  pCR  effect. 
However, the observed difference in tpCR rate of 17.8% between arm A (T+D) and B (Ptz+T+D) in the 
NEOSPHERE  study  is  considered  sufficiently  large  to  be  associated  with  a  clinically  meaningful 
improvement in long-term outcomes in the context of the totality of the data. Although not statistically 
significant, efficacy outcome data (DFS and OS) from the NEOSPHERE study showed a trend in favour 
of  pertuzumab.  This  should  also  be  seen  in  light  of  the  survival  benefit  of  adding  pertuzumab  to 
trastuzumab in the metastatic setting.  
In both studies pCR rates and magnitude of improvement with pertuzumab were lower in the subgroup 
of patients with hormone-receptor-positive tumours compared to patients with hormone receptor-
negative tumours. In the NEOSPHERE study, patients with hormone receptor-positive disease had 
lower bpCR rates (5.9% - 26%, across treatment arms [highest in Ptz+T+D arm]) than patients with 
hormone receptor-negative disease (27.3% - 63.2%, across treatment arms [highest in Ptz+T+D 
arm]). This observation is consistent with lower pCR rate observed in HR+ patients in the literature. 
However, a recently published meta-analyses (Cortazar et al. 2014, Lancet), which included individual 
patient data from approximately 12,000 patients, showed that there is a statistically significant and 
clinically relevant advantage in terms of long-term outcomes in patients with HER2+ disease, who 
achieve a pCR, irrespective of hormone receptor status. In addition, there solid evidence from the 
CLEOPATRA study for a statistically significant and clinically meaningful advantage of the effect of 
pertuzumab in HER2+ breast cancer in the metastatic setting, regardless of hormone receptor status. 
In this study, a Hazard Ratio for OS of 0.71 (0.51, 0.96) in patients with HR+ disease, compared with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/285991/2015 
Page 91/95 
 
 
 
 
 
0.61 (0.47, 0.81) in patients with HR-negative disease was observed. Thus, it is reasonable to expect 
that this will also the case in the neoadjuvant setting. 
The  APHINITY  study  will  provide  confirmatory  efficacy  data  both  in  the  overall  population  and  in  the 
HER2+/HR+  subpopulation  (see  Annex  II  conditions).  In  addition,  study  BERENICE  will  also  provide 
valuable efficacy data in the neoadjuvant setting. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In  the  neoadjuvant  trial  NEOSPHERE,  the  most  common  ADRs  (≥ 50%)  seen  with  Perjeta  in 
combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel were alopecia and neutropenia. The most common NCI-
CTCAE v.3 Grade 3-4 ADR (≥ 10%) was neutropenia.  
In  the  TRYPHAENA  study,  when  Perjeta  was  administered  in  combination  with  trastuzumab  and  FEC 
(5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) for 3 cycles followed by 3 cycles of Perjeta, trastuzumab 
and  docetaxel,  the  most  common  ADRs  (≥50%)  were  neutropenia,  diarrhoea  and  nausea.  The  most 
common  NCI-CTCAE  v.3  Grade  3-4  ADRs  (≥10%)  were  neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia  and 
leucopenia.  When  Perjeta  was  administered  in  combination  with  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel  for  3 
cycles following 3 cycles of FEC (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide), the most common ADRs 
(≥ 50%)  were  diarrhoea,  nausea  and  alopecia.  The  most  common  NCI-CTCAE  v.3  Grade  3-4  ADRs 
(≥ 10%)  were  neutropenia  and  leucopenia.  Similarly,  when  Perjeta  was  administered  in  combination 
with TCH (docetaxel, carboplatin and trastuzumab) for 6 cycles, the most common ADRs (≥ 50%) were 
diarrhoea and alopecia. The most common NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 3-4 ADRs (≥ 10%) were neutropenia, 
febrile neutropenia, anaemia, leucopenia and diarrhoea. 
In  general,  there  were  slightly  more  AEs  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm  of  the  NEOSPHERE  study,  which  is 
expected.  Comparing  Arm  A  (T+D)  with  Arm  D  (Ptz+D)  almost  an  identical  safety  profile  was 
observed, except for diarrhoea, which was more common in Arm D. Thus, pertuzumab by itself seems 
to impose a higher risk of diarrhoea, which is manageable in the clinical setting. 
In the NEOSPHERE study, the incidence of LVD was higher in the pertuzumab–treated groups than in 
those who did not receive pertuzumab. An increased incidence of LVEF declines was also observed in 
patients  treated  with  pertuzumab  in  combination  with  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel.  LVEF  recovered  to 
≥ 50% in all patients. 
In  the  NEOSPHERE  study,  SAEs  occurred  more  frequently  in  Arms  A  (T+D)  and  D  (Ptz+D)  in  the 
neoadjuvant  period.  Most  frequent  SAEs  in  all  treatment  arms  were  neutropenia  and  febrile 
neutropenia. The pattern of SAE was comparable to the experimental arm in the CLEOPATRA study.  In 
the  neoadjuvant  period  in  the  TRYPHAENA  study,  SAEs  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  non-
anthracycline  arm  (Arm  C).  Across  all  three  arms,  diarrhoea,  neutropenia  and  gastrointestinal 
disorders occurred most frequently. All are reflected in the SmPC. Very few SAEs were observed in the 
adjuvant and post-treatment follow-up period in the TRYPHAENA study. 
Overall,  there  was  no  indication  of  any  unexpected  excess  of  cases  of  diarrhoea,  rash,  mucositis, 
interstitial  lung  disease,  hepatic  disorders,  VTEs,  neutropenia  or  febrile  neutropenia  by  adding 
pertuzumab to trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  safety  of  Perjeta  administered  for  more  than  6  cycles  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  has  not  been 
established (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/285991/2015 
Page 92/95 
 
 
 
 
 
With  regard  to  LVEF/LVSD,  there  were  too  few  events  to  draw  any  conclusions.  Very  few  patients 
discontinued  treatment  due  to  cardiac  events.  There  are  limited  safety  data  available  from  the 
TRYPHAENA  study  concerning  sequential  as  well  as  concomitant  administration  of  Perjeta  with 
epirubicin,  as  part  of  the  FEC  regimen  and  there  are  no  safety  data  available  to  support  use  of 
doxorubicin  with  pertuzumab.  Therefore,  cardiac  risk  should  be  carefully  considered  and  balanced 
against  the  medical  need  of  the  individual  patient  before  use  of  pertuzumab  with  an  anthracycline. 
Based  on  the  pharmacological  actions  of  pertuzumab  and  anthracyclines  an  increased  risk  of  cardiac 
toxicity might be expected from concomitant compared with sequential use of these agents, although 
not seen in the TRYPHAENA study (see SmPC section 4.4 and 5.1). 
Although the safety database in the claimed indication is considered sufficient for a characterization of 
the  safety  profile,  longer  follow-up  and  monitor  of  some  AEs,  including  cardiac  toxicity,  is  still 
considered necessary (see Annex II and RMP). 
Patients older than 65 years are scarcely represented (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1 and RMP). 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Treatment  effect  measured  as  pCR  in  the  overall  patient  population  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  is 
considered  clinically  relevant  and  likely  to  be  associated  with  a  benefit  on  long-term  outcomes  (DFS 
and  OS).  The  final  analysis  from  the  APHINITY  study  (phase  III)  should  permit  confirmation  of  the 
clinical  benefit  of  pertuzumab  observed  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  from  the  NEOSPHERE  and 
TRYPHAENA studies. 
The  safety  profile  does  not  differ  significantly  from  that  already  observed  in  the  metastatic  setting, 
although  an  increase  in  a  number  of  AEs  has  been  observed  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  with  the 
number of treatment cycles, including neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and diarrhoea. Most of AEs are 
manageable  in  the  clinical  setting.  Overall,  the  add-on  changes  in  toxicity  are  acceptable.  Long-term 
cardiac  toxicity  will  be  further  characterised  in  the  ongoing  APHINITY  and  BERENICE  studies  (see 
Annex II and RMP). 
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, based on the results from studies NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA and in the context of the 
totality of data, the robust biological rationale for the combination, compelling efficacy results from the 
metastatic setting, the acceptable safety profile, the reasonable likelihood that the observed treatment 
effect with pertuzumab is associated with a benefit in long-term outcome (DFS and OS), the benefit-
risk balance  of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the neoadjuvant 
treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, or early stage breast 
cancer at high risk of recurrence is positive.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Considering  the greater  medical  need  in  patients  at high  risk  of recurrence  and  the  available  efficacy 
data from the two neo-adjuvant studies, the CHMP considered the uncertainties with regard to safety 
can  be  accepted  in  patients  who  are  at  high  risk  of  recurrence.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  that 
the  neoadjuvant  indication  should  be  restricted  to  this  high  risk  patient  population.  Locally  advanced 
and inflammatory breast cancers are considered as high-risk irrespective of hormone receptor status in 
the  neoadjuvant  setting.  In  early  stage  breast  cancer,  tumour  size,  grade,  hormone  receptor  status 
and  lymph  node  metastases  should  be  taken  into  account  in  the  risk  assessment  (see  SmPC  section 
5.1).

All available data make it sufficiently likely that pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab will 
increase the pCR rate as add-on to chemotherapy regimens. Specifically, an increase in pCR rates has 
been shown when pertuzumab is added to T+D (39 % versus 22 %; NEOSPHERE Study). Standard 
practice guidelines recommend pertuzumab as part of treatment regimens including an anthracycline 
(e.g. epirubicin as in FEC) and a taxane (e.g. docetaxel) (NCCN guideline). When Perjeta was added to 
T+D+FEC or TCH based regimens in the TRYPHAENA study, pCR was 55-64%. Furthermore, the 
overall amount of evidence available to date, do not demonstrate a meaningful increase in cardiac 
toxicity. Acknowledging that a longer follow-up is needed to be further reassured, in this high-risk 
population, it is in the best interest of patients allowing the possibility to use pertuzumab not only in 
combination with docetaxel as backbone chemotherapy regimen but also with other chemotherapy 
regimens and at least with TCH (i.e. docetaxel, carboplatin and trastuzumab, Arm C of TRYPHAENA), 
which did not raise concerns with regard to cardiac toxicity. As a result the CHMP considers that the 
indication should not be restricted to combination with docetaxel as chemotherapy backbone only and 
recommended the use of perjeta in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy.

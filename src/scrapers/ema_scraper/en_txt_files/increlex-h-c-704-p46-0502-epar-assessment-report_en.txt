mecasermin 
Ipsen Pharma 
For the long-term treatment of growth failure in 
children and adolescents with severe primary insulin-
like growth factor 1 deficiency (Primary IGFD). 
Severe Primary IGFD is defined by: 
- height standard deviation score   -3.0 and 
- basal IGF 1 levels below the 2.5th percentile for age 
and gender and 
- GH sufficiency. 
- Exclusion of secondary forms of IGF-1 deficiency, 
such as malnutrition, hypothyroidism, or chronic 
treatment with pharmacologic doses of anti-
inflammatory steroids. 
Severe Primary IGFD includes patients with mutations 
in the GH receptor (GHR), post-GHR signaling 
pathway, and IGF-1 gene defects; they are not GH 
deficient, and therefore, they cannot be expected to 
respond adequately to exogenous GH treatment. It is 
recommended to confirm the diagnosis by conducting 
an IGF-1 generation test.

Introduction 
On  18th  December  2012  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  (MS316)  for  Increlex,  in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Increlex and 
that no consequential regulatory action is required. 
Scientific discussion 
Information on the development program 
The MAH states that Study MS316 is a stand alone study.

Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
•  Study MS316; Recombinant Human Growth Hormone (rhGH) and Recombinant Human Insulin-like 
Growth Factor-1 (rhIGF-1) Combination Therapy in Children with Short Stature Associated with IGF-1 
Deficiency:  A  Six-year,  Randomized,  Multi-Center,  Open-Label,  Parallel-Group,  Active  Treatment 
Controlled, Dose Selection Trial. 
The study was carried out as a “proof of principle”- study in children with short stature associated with 
less  severe  IGF-1  deficiency  than  in  the  current  EU-SPC  for  Increlex  and  in  combination  with  rhGH. 
Hence  the  studied  indication  and  treatment  regimen  (combination  with  rhGH)  are  outside  of  the 
current EU-indication for mecasermin.  
The FDA has approved rhGH treatment in the pediatric population with idiopathic short stature in 2003. 
Similar approval does not exist in Europe.

Clinical study 
Study  MS316:  Recombinant  Human  Growth  Hormone  (rhGH)  and  Recombinant  Human 
Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (rhIGF-1) Combination Therapy in Children with Short Stature 
Associated  with  IGF-1  Deficiency:  A  Six-year,  Randomized,  Multi-Center,  Open-Label, 
Parallel-Group, Active Treatment Controlled, Dose Selection Trial 
Description 
Low IGF-1 is common to both growth hormone (GH) resistance and growth hormone deficiency (GHD) 
and may be the best marker of a defect of the GH:IGF-1 axis. The rationale for testing the combination 
of  hGH  and  rhIGF-1  therapy  for  short  stature  children  with  low  IGF-1  was  based  on  evidence  of 
independent and complementary actions of GH and IGF-1 to promote growth and the prevalence of GH 
insensitivity  and  low  serum  IGF-1  levels  in  children  with  idiopathic  short  stature.  The  combination 
therapy  could  also  potentially  limit  adverse  effects  related  to  the  use  of  each  agent  individually.  The 
MS316 study examined the potential superiority of combination hGH + rhIGF-1 compared to hGH alone 
in GH sufficient children with short stature and low IGF-1 (defined as SDS≤-1).  
Methods 
•  Objective(s) 
The primary objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of three combinations of rhGH and rhIGF-1 
compared to that of rhGH alone in the treatment of short stature associated with IGFD. 
The secondary objectives of the study were to: 
o  Assess changes that occur in serum concentrations of GH and IGF-1 and their binding proteins 
o  Assess  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  pharmacodynamics  (PD)  of  GH  and  IGF-1  during  chronic 
administration 
o  Assess the rate of skeletal maturation during treatment 
o  Explore total changes in body mass index (BMI) 
•  Study design 
This was a phase II, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, active treatment controlled, 
dose selection study conducted at 27 centers in the US. 
Screening  took  place  to  achieve  a  targeted  population  of  100  prepubertal  children,  aged  5  years  or 
older, with short stature associated with low IGF-1 and normal stimulated GH response. 
A  parallel-group  design  was  selected  since  childhood  growth-spurts  are  unpredictable  in  timing  and 
duration;  a  cross-over  design  may  not  have  been  able  to  distinguish  between  growth  spurts  and 
treatment response within the broad age range of this population.  
Similarly, a long-term study was required to effectively capture any differences in growth rate between 
subjects. 
The  randomization  was  stratified  according  to  whether  the  subject’s  age  was  ≤9  years,  and  whether 
the subject’s IGF-1 SDS was ≤-2, at screening. This procedure was intended to minimize any possible 
interference attributable to inter-subject variability in these factors. 
The  planned  treatment  duration  for  each  subject  was  6  years  (increased  from  3  years  by  protocol 
Amendment 2, which was finalized after all subjects had completed 1 year of).  
However,  the  study  was  prematurely  terminated  by  the  Sponsor  after  the  last  subject  attended  14 
visits (completed Year 3) due to strategic reasons.

Study drugs were administered by daily subcutaneous (s.c.) injections, commenced by the Investigator 
at  Day  1,  Visit  2.  Subsequent  injections  were  made  at  home  by  the  subject  or  the  subjects'  parents 
and/or guardians, following appropriate training. 
Monitoring for adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications began at Visit 2. 
Subject  Diaries  were  used  to  record  any  missed  administrations  and  preserve  study  drug 
accountability. Assessment for efficacy and safety were performed at the study visits.  
Premature Termination of the Study 
In  2011,  Ipsen  undertook  a  complete  review  of  its  commercial  and  development  strategies.  The 
decision  was  made  to  focus  resources  on  other  areas  which  led  to  a  change  in  the  strategy  for  the 
growth franchise.  As a result, the MS316 study  was ended at the time the last subject completed 14 
visits. 
•  Study population /Sample size 
106 subjects entered in study 316. Subject disposition is presented in Figure 1.

6 months of Screening); 
•  GH  sufficiency,  defined  as  a  maximal  stimulated  GH  response  of  ≥10  ng/mL  (The  GH  stimulation 
test was scheduled at Visit 1 to occur prior to Visit 2, unless the Medical Monitor approved the use of a 
prior stimulation test result to satisfy this requirement); 
•  Prepubertal  status:  Girls  were  at  less  than  Tanner  stage  2  breast  development  and  boys  had

Exclusion criteria were as follows: 
Subjects were excluded from entering the study for the following reasons: 
•  Severe Primary IGFD (height and IGF-1 SDS ≤-3, and stimulated GH response ≥10 ng/mL a  
Visit 1); 
•  Any previous therapeutic use of IGF-1, GH, gonadotropin agonists (e.g., Lupron®), sex steroids or 
aromatase  inhibitors.  A  short-term  (7  days  or  fewer)  exposure  to  GH  for  a  diagnostic  test  was 
permitted;

illness, 
including:  diabetes  mellitus; 
•  Chronic 
inborn  errors  of  metabolism;  osteo-  or 
chondrodystrophies; disease of the genitourinary, cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, or central nervous 
system. The Medical Monitor was to be consulted on the inclusion of subjects whose chronic condition 
or medication for such condition did not, in the opinion of the investigator, potentially increase risk to 
the subject or to the integrity of the study; 
•  Chromosomal aneuploidy (for example, Down syndrome or other trisomies, Turner syndrome); 
•  Syndromes with known predisposition to develop malignant tumors (for example, Bloom syndrome,

•  Any current or previous exposure to therapeutic spinal irradiation; 
•  Evidence of clinical malnutrition or growth deficit attributable to emotional deprivation; 
•  Evidence of any active malignancy or intracranial tumors; 
•  Evidence for organic hypopituitarism; 
•  Use of investigational medication(s) within the last month; 
•  Any other social or medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would be detrimental 
to either the subject or the study (for example, subjects whose families were planning to relocate, or 
subjects with suspected but not yet proven chromosomal abnormalities, were not to be included) 
Sample size determination 
Dunnett’s  test  for  multiple  comparisons  was  used  in  the  primary  analysis,  but  for  the  purposes  of 
computing approximate power, alpha=0.0173 was used in each of three tests.  
While  25  subjects  were  planned  in  each  group,  for  the  purpose  of  estimating  power  it  was  assumed 
that only 23 subjects per group would complete the first year of the study. It was also assumed that 
there  is  a  mean  difference  of  2.0  cm/year  (y)  between  rhGH  monotherapy  and  combination  therapy, 
and  that  the  common  within  treatment  arm  standard  deviation  (SD)  was  1.6  cm/y.  Under  these 
assumptions, the power was predicted at 96%. 
•  Treatments 
Eligible subjects were randomized to one of four treatment groups, stratified by age ≤9 years and IGF 
1 SDS ≤-2 at Screening, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio: 
• 45 μg/kg/day rhGH; 
• 45 μg/kg/day rhGH + 50 μg/kg/day rhIGF-1 (approximately 1:1.1); 
• 45 μg/kg/day rhGH + 100 μg/kg/day rhIGF-1 (approximately 1:2.2); 
• 45 μg/kg/day rhGH + 150 μg/kg/day rhIGF-1 (approximately 1:3.3). 
In the US, many of the subjects in this study population could be prescribed somatropin for a diagnosis 
of  ISS.  Therefore,  the  active  comparator  for  this  study  was  rhGH  at  a  dose  similar  to  that 
recommended in this group: 45 μg/kg/day. 
The  optimal  ratio  for  rhGH  to  rhIGF-1  was  unknown,  so  a  range  of  drug  ratios  (approximately  1:1.1, 
1:2.2 and 1:3.3) was selected for the study. These ratios correspond to rhIGF-1 doses of 50, 100, and 
150  μg/kg/day  once  per  day  (QD),  and  were  chosen  to  be  below  the  equivalent  total  daily  dose  of 
rhIGF-1  (160-240  μg/kg)  currently  approved  for  the  treatment  of  children  with  short  stature  due  to 
severe Primary IGFD (80-120 μg/kg twice per day [BID]). 
Prior studies were used to make estimates of the serum IGF-1 levels that would be expected to occur 
during combination of rhGH and rhIGF-1 treatment.  
Dose Titrations 
Subjects commenced treatment on Day 1 (Visit 2) at 50% of their assigned dose. 
Full doses commenced on the day immediately following Day 15 (Visit 3). 
Dose Reductions 
Subjects  experiencing  significant  AEs  with  their  assigned  rhGH  or  rhIGF-1  dose  could  be  moved 
temporarily  to  a  lower  dose  at  the  same  rhGH  to  rhIGF-1  ratio;  or,  if  already  on  a  lowered  dose, 
removed  from  study  drug  on  a  case-by-case  basis  at  the  discretion  of  the  Medical  Monitor  and  the 
Investigator. 
In cases where sustained serum IGF-1 SDSs above +4 were observed a dose reduction may have been 
used at the discretion of the Medical Monitor and Investigator.

Dose Omissions 
IGF-1  has insulin-like activity and the potential for hypoglycemic events is heightened during fasting. 
Parents/guardians of subjects receiving rhIGF-1 were instructed not to administer either study drug on 
days where breakfast was missed (for example, due to illness or planned dental work). 
Whether  a  dose  omission  was  intentional  or  otherwise,  it  was  emphasized  that  no  attempt  should  be 
made  to  'catch-up'  on  a  missed  dose  by  administering  the  study  drugs  later  in  the  day  or  by 
administering a double dose the following day. 
The time and reason for the omitted dose was to be recorded in the Subject Diary. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint was height velocity during the first year of treatment. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
o  Height velocity during the second, third and fourth year of treatment

Labile Subunit (ALS), and GH Binding Proteins (GHBP) 
Safety endpoints were: 
o  Adverse Events 
o  Laboratory data including haematology, biochemistry, non-fasting capillary 
o  blood glucose and urinalysis 
o  Vital signs 
o  Onset of puberty 
Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow Chart 
The  timing  of  safety  and  efficacy  evaluations  performed  during  the  first  three  years  of  the  study  are 
specified in the study protocol (Amendment 1). 
•  Statistical Methods 
Statistical analysis strategy 
The  statistical  analyses  will  be  performed  in  accordance  with  ICH  E9  guidelines  and  will  be  based  on 
the pooled data from the individual study sites, unless otherwise stated. 
Ipsen  will  perform  the  statistical  analysis  of  the  efficacy,  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetic  an 
antibodies data. 
Multiplicity 
A two-sided test will be performed for each of the 3 combination treatment (COM) groups versus the 
group with GH alone. 
Formally, the null hypothesis for each combination group is: 
H0: Height Velocitycom = Height Velocity GH 
and the alternative hypothesis is: 
Ha: Height Velocity com ≠ Height Velocity GH 
Dunnett’s test will be used.

Page 9/34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the statistical tests will be two-sided at 1.73 % level of significance 
for the comparisons of each combo arm with GH alone. 
Primary efficacy analysis 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  will  use  a  modified  intent-to-treat  population.  A  two-sided  test  will  be 
performed  for  each  of  the  3  combination  treatment  (COM)  groups  versus  the  group  with  GH  alone 
using  analysis  of  covariance  with  the  Year  1  height  velocity  as  the  dependent  variable  and  with 
randomization strata defined by baseline age and IGF-1 SDS as covariates. 
Exploratory sensitivity analysis of the height velocity within the population of patients who completed 
the first year will be performed using pubertal status, bone age and presence or absence of anti-IGF-1 
antibodies as additional covariates along with the covariates specified in the primary analysis. 
Secondary efficacy analysis 
a) 
Height velocity during the second, third and fourth year 
A two-sided test will be performed using the modified intention-to-treat population by comparing pairs 
of COM groups using analysis of covariance as above. Formally the null hypothesis for the comparison 
of each pair of combination groups is: 
H0: Height Velocity COM 2 = Height Velocity COM 1 
and the alternative hypothesis is: 
Ha: Height Velocity COM 2 > Height Velocity COM 1 
where the IGF-1 dose for COM 2 > the dose for COM 1. 
Similar analysis will also be performed using a subgroup of subjects who completed the first, second, 
third and fourth year of the study. 
Missing  end-of-study  height  velocities  will  be  imputed  where  necessary  for  the  intention-to-treat 
population as described below. 
b) 
Change in height SDS during the first, second, third and fourth year 
Height  SDS  scores  will  be  calculated  using  the  National  Center  for  Health  Statistics  2000  data  as 
provided  by  the  Center  for  Disease  Control  (Kuczmarski,  Ogden  et  al.  2002).  Change  in  height  SD 
score will be analysed using the modified ITT population by comparing pairs of groups using analysis of 
covariance. 
Similar analysis will also be performed using a subgroup of subjects who completed the first, second, 
third and fourth year of the study. 
Similar analysis will also be performed using a subgroup of pubertal subjects who completed the first, 
second, third and fourth year of the study. 
c) 
Change in predicted adult height during the first, second, third and fourth year 
The  Roche-Wainer-Thissen  predicted  adult  height  and  adjusted  for  growth  after  age  18  for  pre-
treatment, Year one, two, three and four will be summarized by treatment arm for subjects completing 
the year based on baseline height SD score and mid-parental target height SD score.  
The  mid-parental  target  height  SD  score  will  be  computed  as  0.4  *  (Mother’s  Height  SDS  +  Father’s 
Height SDS)  
The  predicted  adult  height  will  also  be  presented  in  cm  and  summarized  by  treatment  arm  for  pre-
treatment, Year one, two, three and four. 
d) 
Total change in height 
Total change in height will be summarized by treatment arm.

Total change in height SDS will be summarized by treatment arm. 
f) 
Total change in predicted adult height divided by total change in chronological age 
Total change in predicted adult height divided by total age in chronological age will be summarized by 
treatment arm. 
g) 
labile subunit (ALS), and GH binding proteins (GHBP) 
Changes in serum concentrations of GH, IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor binding proteins acid 
The  change  in  serum  concentrations  between  baseline  and  each  visit  will  be  presented  by  treatment 
arm. 
h) 
Skeletal maturation 
The height age of a patient is defined as the age at which the median height of the general population 
of the same sex is equal to the height of the patient in question. For example, if a girl has a height of 
132.7 cm, then her height age is 9 years old because the median height for 9-year-old girls is 132.7 
cm. If the age of the girl is 11, then her height age would be two years behind her chronological age. 
Bone and height age are summarized by treatment arm at baseline, Year 1, 2, 3, 4 and at the End Of 
Study.  The  change  from  baseline  to  each  of  the  endpoints  and  the  change  between  two  consecutive 
years  will  also  be  presented  for  bone  and  height  age.  In  addition,  the  change  between  chronological 
age and bone age will be summarized by treatment arm at baseline, Year 1, 2, 3, 4 and at the End of 
Study. 
i) 
Total change in BMI SDS 
The change in BMI SDS between baseline and last value available will be presented by treatment arm. 
Safety 
All  safety  data  will  be  included  in  the  data  listings  and  summary  tables  will  be  based  on  the  safety 
population.  The  safety  analysis  will  focus  on  the  safety  of  GH/IGF-1  combination  therapy  with  GH 
monotherapy  as  a  comparator.  Additionally,  events  known  to  be  associated  with  IGF-1  will  be 
evaluated for any change in incidence during combination therapy. 
Missing data 
The intention-to-treat principle will be used in the analysis of height velocity and change in height SD 
score.  Missing  end-of-year-one  height  SD  scores  will  be  imputed  using  the  last  observation  carried 
forward  (LOCF),  i.e.,  if  the  height  at  Week  52  is  missing  for  a  given  subject,  then  the  last  observed 
height SD score for that subject is used as the Week 52 (1 year) height SD score. Height velocities will 
be imputed assuming no change in height SD score after the last height measurement. 
Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The  study  patients  were  recruited  from  27  centers  in  the  US.  The  first  subject  was  randomized  in 
January 2008. The study was prematurely terminated once the last subject had completed three years 
of treatment which happened in March 2012. 
Data Sets Analysed 
First year height velocity is the primary efficacy endpoint of this 6-year study. However, the study was 
prematurely  terminated.  At  the  termination  of  this  study,  79  subjects  had  completed  3  years  of 
treatment and 17 subjects had completed 4 years of.

The  primary  efficacy  analysis  for  this  report  was  based  on  the  Modified  ITT  population  (MITT).  The 
assessment  of  PK  was  based  on  the  PK  population  and  the  assessment  of  safety  and  tolerability  was 
based on the Safety population. Table 5 (below) summarizes the populations defined for the report. 
Treatment  compliance  was  evaluated  by  the  number  and  the  percent  of  missed  injections  for  each 
subject  using  the  subject  diary.  All  subjects  missed  at  least  one  injection  of  rhGH  and  rhIGF-1.  For 
both  the  rhGH  and  the  rhIGF-1  injections,  in  all  treatment  groups,  75%  of  subjects  missed less  than 
13% of their doses. 
Subjects who had a dose withheld temporarily due to an AE or because of a planned procedure which 
limited food intake were not considered to be non-compliant. In addition, the Sponsor mandated dose 
reductions, due to high near-peak rhIGF-1 SDS. In those incidences, subjects were instructed to take a 
lower  dose  at  the  same  rhGH  to  rhIGF-1  ratio.  Up  to  two  dose  reductions  were  allowed  and  if 
necessary a subject could be removed from study drug on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the 
Medical Monitor and the Investigator. No subject was removed from the study for this reason. 
There were no dose reductions in the rhGH alone treatment group. The number of subjects with dose 
reductions  were  2,  10  and  14  in  the  45  rhGH+50  rhIGF-1,  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  and  45  rhGH+150 
rhIGF-1 treatment groups, respectively. Some of the subjects had more than one dose reduction.  
•  Baseline data 
A total of 106 subjects with low IGF-1 and short-stature were randomized to treatment. The population 
demographics are summarized in Table 6.

The majority of subjects, 85/106 (80.2%), were male and gender composition was similar across the 
four treatment groups, except for a slightly higher proportion of females in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 
group. A total of 79/106 (74.5%) subjects were white, and while subjects of other ethnic origins were 
distributed  across  all  four  treatment  groups,  a  slight  disparity  exists  between  the  proportion  of  white 
subjects in the 45 rhGH group (17/26 subjects; 65.4%) and the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group (23/26 
subjects; 88.5%). 
Randomization to one of the four treatment groups was stratified by age ≤9 years and IGF-1 SDS ≤-2. 
Evaluations  at  Visit  2  formed  the  baseline  against  which  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints 
were assessed. These baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 7.

•  Efficacy results 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Height Velocity During the First Year of Treatment 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  on  the  MITT  population.  This  population  included  all 
subjects  and  used  LOCF  data  imputation  for  subjects  withdrawn  prior  to  completing  1  year  of 
treatment. 
A  two-sided  ANCOVA  was  performed  for  each  of  the  three  combination  treatment  groups  versus  the 
rhGH  alone  group,  using  Year  1  height  velocity  as  the  dependent  variable  and  with  randomization 
strata defined by baseline age and IGF-1 SDS as covariates. The results are reported in Table 9. 
The  difference  between  45  rhGH  alone  and  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  was  statistically  significant  with 
p=0.001 (adjusted by Dunnett's procedure for multiple comparison) and 95% confidence interval (CI) 
of 0.90 to 3.01 cm/y. 
The results with without imputation for subjects who did not complete Year 1 are in line with MITT with 
imputation (table 10). 
The difference between 45 rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 was statistically significant with 
p<0.001 and 95% CI of 1.11 to 3.00 cm/y.

A  total  of  22  subjects  were  deemed  to  have  entered  puberty  (breast/testes  stage  2)  during  the  first 
year of the study. Only one subject reached stage 3, a male in the GH monotherapy group at age 12.8 
years. 
Exploratory sensitivity analyses of the height velocity ANCOVA, within this population of subjects who 
completed the  first  year,  were  performed  with  pubertal  status,  bone  age  and  presence  or  absence of 
anti-IGF-1 as additional covariates. Neither pubertal status nor bone age or the presence or absence of 
anti-IGF-1 affected the statistical significance observed in the primary analysis. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Height Velocity during the Second, Third and Fourth Year of Treatment 
As  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis,  the  secondary  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  on  the  MITT 
population. This population included all subjects and used LOCF data imputation for subjects withdrawn 
prior to completing the second, third or fourth year of treatment. Imputation for each year is used for 
any  subject  that  had  one  or  more  height  measurement  documented  during  that  year.  Subjects  who 
withdrew prior to the collection of a height measurement in that year were excluded from the analysis. 
A  two-sided  ANCOVA  was  performed  for  each  of  the  three  combination  treatment  groups  versus  the 
rhGH  alone  group,  using  Year  2  height  velocity  as  the  dependent  variable  and  with  randomization 
strata defined by baseline age and IGF-1 SDS as covariates. The results are reported in Table 11. 
The  difference  between  45  rhGH  alone  and  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  was  statistically  significant  with 
p<0.001 and 95% CI of 0.84 to 2.52 cm/y. 
The  results  without  imputation  for  subjects  who  did  not  complete  Year  2  are  in  line  with  MITT  with 
imputation:  the  difference  between  45  rhGH  alone  and  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  was  statistically 
significant with p<0.001. Additionally, the difference between 45 rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-
1 was also statistically significant (p=0.008). 
The  analysis  of  subjects  completing  2  years  showed  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  45 
rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 (p=0.008) that was not observed in the corresponding analysis 
of the MITT population (p=0.081). 
The  results  without  imputation  for  subjects  who  did  not  complete  Year  3  are  in  line  with  the  results 
observed with the results observed with second year height velocity:  
1.  With subjects with imputation who did not complete Year 3 the difference between 45 rhGH alone 
and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 was statistically significant with p=0.005. The difference between 45 rhGH 
alone and 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 was also statistically significant with p=0.038.

2.  With  subjects  without  imputation  who  did  not  complete  Year  3  the  difference  between  45  rhGH 
alone and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 was statistically significant with p=0.019. The difference between 45 
rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 was also statistically significant with p=0.034. 
The number of subjects with data from Year 4 was very low. Therefore, no statistical conclusions could 
be reached. 
Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoint:  Cumulative  Change  in  Height  SDS  during  the  First,  Second,  Third  and 
Fourth Year of Treatment 
A statistically significant difference was observed for the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group with a 95% CI of 
0.13 to 0.48 (p=0.003) in the first year height SDS (subjects with imputation).  
In the second year height SDS (subjects with imputation) the difference was statistically significant for 
the  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  group  (p=0.021)  and  the  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  (p<0.001),  but  not 
significant for the 45 rhGH+50 rhIGF-1 group. A parallel analysis considering only those subjects who 
completed the second year of treatment was performed and showed similar results. 
In  the  third  year  height  SDS  (subjects  with  imputation)  the  difference  was  statistically  significant  for 
the  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  group  (p=0.008)  and  the  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  (p=0.001),  but  not 
significant for the 45 rhGH+50 rhIGF-1 group. A parallel analysis considering only those subjects who 
completed the third year of treatment was performed and showed similar results. 
The number of subjects with data from Year 4 was very low. Therefore, no statistical conclusions could 
be reached. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Predicted Adult Height 
All four treatment groups demonstrated an improvement in RWT predicted adult height SDS during the 
first year of treatment, but the change was higher in the three combination groups. 
Mean±SD  change  in  RWT  PAH  SDS  was  0.53±0.36  in  the  45  rhGH  (n=24),  0.63±0.21  in  the  45 
rhGH+50  rhIGF-1  group  (n=25),  0.67±0.37  in  the  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  group  (n=22),  and 
0.76±0.31 in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group (n=25). 
This improvement was sustained during the second and third year of treatment and remained higher in 
the three combination groups. 
There is more  variability in the RWT predicted adult height than in the mid-parental target height, in 
particular in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 treatment group. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Total Change in BMI SDS 
Baseline BMI SDS is not as low as height SDS, indicating that subjects have more of a deficit in height 
than  in  body  mass.  A  Student  t-test  was  performed  to  analyse  whether  there  was  a  change  in  BMI 
between baseline and the end of study. 
The results demonstrate a shift toward normalization of BMI SDS at the End of Study as compared to 
Baseline in all four treatment groups (p<0.005 in all four groups). The effect seems more pronounced 
in  the  three  combination  groups  (the  mean  change  from  Baseline  to  the  end  of  the  study  was  0.45; 
0.42  and  0.64  in  the  45  rhGH+50  rhIGF-1;  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  and  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  group 
respectively compared to 0.34 in the 45 rhGH alone treatment group) 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Skeletal Maturation 
As expected, bone age at Baseline was delayed in relation to chronological age in all treatment groups. 
Bone age increased in all  treatment groups. The mean increase was in the same range of magnitude 
between the rhGH alone group and the combination groups at Year 1. 
There was a trend for a slightly higher advancement in bone age at Year 3 in the combination groups 
compared  to  rhGH  alone  (4.0  versus  3.8).  These  data  indicate  that  increased  growth  was  not 
accompanied by undue skeletal maturation.

The anthropometric data collected were not consistent due to the lack of practice of the site staff that 
performed  this  measurement.  Therefore;  these  data  were  considered  unreliable  and  could  not  be 
interpreted.  
Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoint:  Changes  in  Serum  Concentrations  of  GH,  IGF-1,  Insulin-like  Growth 
Factor Binding Proteins, Acid-Labile Subunit (ALS), and GH Binding Proteins (GHBP) 
Trough  serum  GH  values  are  highly  variable  in  all  the  treatment  groups.  There  is  a  trend  for  slight 
reduction of trough serum GH and GHBP in the combination groups. 
As  expected  mean  IGF-1  trough  levels  increased  on  therapy  with  a  more  important  increase  in  the 
combination groups than in the rhGH alone group, without evidence of a clear dose effect. For the IGF-
1 and IGF-1 SDS near peak values, there was an increase between the values at Week 39 and at Week 
120  for  all  groups.  However,  in  the  combination  groups,  these  values  decreased  between  Week  120 
and Week 173, which may be due to mandated dose reductions.  
The  mean  near  peak  IGF-1  SD  was  at  least  2.5  SD  between  Week  39  and  Week  120  in  the  45 
rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 and in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 groups. 
The mean trough IGF-1 SDS remained within the normal range at Year 1 and Year 3 in all groups. At 
Year 2, it was slightly higher than 2 SD (+2.26) in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 group and close to +2 SD 
(+1.85) in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group. 
Other  IGF  related  proteins  changed  on  therapy:  IGFBP-3  increased  in  all  groups,  within  the  same 
magnitude,  remaining  within  normal  ranges;  IGFBP-1  levels  decreased  within  the  same  magnitude  in 
all treatment groups. 
Drug Dose, Drug Concentration, and Relationships to Response 
Mini-PK/PD multiple-sampling data for GH, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 at a single visit are presented here. 
There  is  a  complex  interaction  between  GH,  IGF-1  and  their  associated  binding  proteins  -  most 
significantly IGFBP-3. While not strictly speaking a PK variable, IGFBP-3 is the most abundant of IGF-1 
binding  proteins.  And  since  unbound  IGF-1  has  more  rapid  clearance  than  bound  IGF-1,  increased 
IGFBP-3  is  correlated  with  increased  serum  IGF-1.  This  relationship  is  complicated  by  negative 
feedback whereby GH-stimulated up regulation of IGFBP-3 (via ALS) is inhibited by 
increased IGF-1 inhibiting GH release. 
The results of the mini PK analysis are intended to be used in the preparation of a model designed to 
elucidate  the  PK/PD  behaviour  resulting  from  GH/IGF-1  co-administration,  and  also  to  inform  future 
dose-reduction strategies. 
Blood samples for mini-PK analysis of GH and IGF-1 were drawn at T0 (pre-dose), T+2 hours and T+4 
hours at Visit 4.  
The mini PK results for GH are in line with what might be expected given that all subjects received a 
flat dose of 45 μg/kg rhGH, and thus demonstrate that there was no influence of the increasing doses 
of rhIGF-1 on the PK of GH in these subjects. 
At Week 4, peak concentrations occurred at T+2 hours in all groups. 
The mini PK results for IGF-1 are in line with expectations. Note that the smaller peak at Week 2 is due 
to  subjects  receiving  a  half  dose  for  the  first  two  weeks  of  treatment  before  being  increased  to  their 
full dose. At Week 4, peak concentrations occurred at T+2  hours in the 45 rhGH+50 rhIGF-1 and 45 
rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 groups and at T+4 hours in the 45 rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 groups, 
but the difference in IGF-1 level between these two time points was small in all groups. 
Mean±SD  serum  IGF-1  concentration  peaked  at  197.9±78.0  ng/mL  in  the  45  rhGH  group  (n=25), 
397.9±113.7  ng/mL  in  the  45  rhGH+50  rhIGF-1  group  (n=26),  430.3±118.7  ng/mL  in  the  45 
rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  group  (n=26),  and  510.9±135.9  ng/mL  in  the  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  group 
(n=25). No difference in mean trough IGF-1 level between treatment groups is apparent at Week 4. 
The complex interactions between GH, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 are illustrated by the IGFBP-3 profiles of the 
three  combination  groups,  which  cannot  be  readily  related  to  the  IGF-1  dose.  Note  that  the  smaller 
peak  at  Week  2  is  due  to  subjects  receiving  a  half  dose  for  the  first  two  weeks  of  treatment  before 
being increased to their full dose. 
At  Week  4,  mean±SD  peak  IGFBP-3  concentrations  occurred  at  T+2  hours  in  the  45  rhGH  group 
(2704.0±474.8  ng/mL;  n=25),  T+2  hours  in  the  45  rhGH+50  rhIGF-1  group  (2623.1±551.6  ng/mL;

n=26), T+4 hours in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 group (2561.5±399.1 ng/mL; n=26), and T+4 hours in 
the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group (2661.5±1107.5 ng/mL; n=26). 
Efficacy Conclusions 
First  year  height  velocity  within  the  MITT  population  showed  significant  difference  between  the  45 
rhGH alone group and the 45 rhGH + 150 rhIGF-1 group p=0.001 and 95% CI of 0.90 to3.01 cm/y. 
First year height velocity within the MITT population, with imputation for early withdrawals (Table 9), 
was  9.3±1.7  cm/y  in  the  45  rhGH  group,  10.1±1.3  cm/y  in  the  45  rhGH+50  IGF-1  group,  9.7±2.5 
cm/y in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 group and 11.2±2.1 cm/y in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF- 1 group. 
The differences between 45 rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+50 rhIGF-1 and 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 were not 
statistically significant. 
When repeating the primary analysis using only subjects who completed 1 year of treatment (n=96), 
statistical significance remained the same as in the MITT analysis. 
In  addition,  3  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  using  pubertal  status,  bone  age  or  presence  or 
absence of anti-IGF-1 antibodies as covariates. The results support the findings in the primary efficacy 
analysis. 
Height  velocity  observed  during  the  first  year  of  treatment  was  expected  to  decrease  in  subsequent 
years in all groups. The effect of the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group compared to the 45 rhGH alone on 
height  velocity  was  sustained  during  the  second  and  the  third  year  of  treatment  in  both  MITT  and 
completers  population.  The  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  group  showed  significantly  increased  efficacy 
compared  to  45  rhGH  alone  during  the  second  year  in  completers  and  during  the  third  year  in  both 
populations. 
The first year change in height SDS within the MITT population showed significant difference between 
the 45 rhGH alone group and the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group (p=0.003.) 
group.  The  effect  seen  in  the  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  group  on  cumulative  change  in  height  SDS 
compared  to  the  45  rhGH  alone  group  is  sustained  during  the  second  and  third  year  of  treatment  in 
both MITT and completers. After 3 years of treatment the cumulative height SDS gain is 1.9 in the 45 
rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group.  
All  four  treatment  groups  demonstrated  an  improvement  in  RWT  PAH  SDS  during  the  first  year  of 
treatment. The change was higher in the three combination groups. The most important increase was 
observed  during  the  first  year  which  is  in  line  with  the  catch-up  in  height  observed  during  the  first 
year. 
There was no influence of the increasing doses of IGF-1 on the PK of GH in these subjects. There was 
an increase in GH from trough (Baseline) to T+2 and T+4 hours at Week 4 in all treatment groups.  
No difference in mean trough  IGF-1 level between treatment groups was apparent at Week 4. In the 
45 rhGH monotherapy group  IGF-1 trough level at  Week 4  had a mean of 207.9. This was similar to 
the observations in the combination therapy groups which were 206.5, 205.3 and 213.3 
in the 45 rhGH+50 rhIGF-1, 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 groups, respectively.  
Overall, these efficacy results demonstrate that combination therapy elicits accelerated statural growth 
without an excessive increase in skeletal maturation or undue increase in BMI.  
•  Safety results 
The total exposure for subjects in each treatment group is summarized in Table 37.

Exposure to treatment during the study was 76 years in the 45 rhGH group (n=26), and 223 years for 
all combination therapy subjects (n=80). 
Adverse Events 
A  total  of  1716  AEs  were  reported  in  the  study  and  1685  of  these  events  were  treatment  emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs). All subjects experienced at least one TEAE.  
The number of occurrences of any AEs were 381, 416, 401 and 518 in the 45 rhGH alone, 45rhGH+50 
rhIGF-1, 45rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 treatment group. 
The  number  of  occurrences  of  TEAEs  were  374,  406,  392  and  513  in  the  corresponding  treatment 
groups (above). 
Subjects that experienced one or more TEAEs are summarized in Table 38. 
A  smaller  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  rhGH  monotherapy  group  experienced  at  least  one  treatment 
related TEAE than in any of the three combination groups. There were 11/26 subjects (42.3%) in the 
monotherapy  group,  17/27  subjects  (63.0%)  in  the  45  rhGH+50  rhIGF-1  group;  20/27  subjects

(74.1%) in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 group and 20/26 subjects (76.9%) in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 
group. This effect may be expected since rhGH and rhIGF-1 have distinct AE profiles.  
The  difference  between  rhGH  monotherapy  and  combination  therapy  is  seen  mostly  in  mild  and 
moderate related TEAEs. Proportions of severe related events are similar across all groups. 
Four  out  of  five  subjects  who  experienced  Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAEs)  were  in  the  combination 
groups.  Only  two  SAEs  were  considered  related  to  treatment:  Papilledema  in  a  subject  in  the  45 
rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  group  and  intracranial  hypertension  in  a  subject  in  the  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1 
group. 
The TEAE  headache was reported with the highest incidence (63 subjects with 172 occurrences). The 
number of subjects reporting headache was 14/26 (54%), 14/27 (52%), 17/27 (63%), 18/26 (69%) in 
the  rhGH,  45  rhGH+50  rhIGF-1,  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  and  45  rhGH  +  150  rhIGF-1  groups 
respectively.  A  slight  increase  in  the  incidence  of  headache  is  noted  as  the  dose  in  the  combination 
group increased.  
Upper respiratory tract infection had the second highest incidence (42 subjects with 110 occurrences). 
The  number  of  subjects  reporting  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  was  10/26  (39%),  10/27  (37%), 
9/27 (33%) and 13/26 (50%) in the corresponding treatment groups (above). 
Pyrexia  had  the  third  highest  incidence  (41  subjects  with  85  occurrences).  The  number  of  subjects 
reporting pyrexia was 9/26 (35%), 15/27 (56%), 4/27 (15%) and 13/26 (50%) in the corresponding 
treatment groups (above). 
Related TEAEs reported in ≥5% subjects receiving rhGH alone or receiving combination therapy 
The treatment related TEAE of headache was reported with the highest incidence (28 subjects with 61 
occurrences). The number of subjects reporting headache was 4/26 (15%), 4/27 (15%), 10/27 (37%), 
10/26 (39%) in the in the corresponding treatment groups (above). 
Injection  site  hypertrophy  (15  subjects  with  24  occurrences)  had  the  next  highest  incidence.  The 
number of subjects reporting injection site hypertrophy was 0/26 (0%), 6/27 (22%), 7/27 (26%) and 
2/26 (8%) in the corresponding treatment groups (above). 
TEAEs of Special Interest 
TEAEs of special interest, either present in the mecasermin labelling or linked to rhIGF-1 treatment in 
the  published  literature  are  summarized  in  Table  41.  In  this  table  PTs  are  ordered  by  percent  of 
subjects in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF group. 
Hypoglycemia was observed in the rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group only.

There  are  two  special  interest  events  occurring  with  >10%  difference  in  incidence  between  all 
combination groups and rhGH monotherapy subjects.  
Lipohypertrophy was seen at >10% difference in the combination group versus the rhGH alone group 
(16/80 (20%) versus 0/26 (0%)). Tonsillar or adenoid hypertrophy reported frequencies were greater 
in the rhGH alone group ((4/26 (15%) compared to the combination groups (4/80 (5%)). 
The  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  combination  group  had  the  highest  incidence  of  the  following  TEAEs  of 
special interest: headache, otitis media, vomiting and hypoglycemia. 
Related  TEAEs  were  all  of  expected  types  and  did  not  occur  in  greater  frequency  than  has  been 
previously  observed.  Three  subjects  experienced  severe  and  related  events:  headache  in  one  rhGH 
monotherapy  and  one  combination  therapy  subject,  and  one  injection  site  hypertrophy  in  a  separate 
combination  therapy  subject.  There  was  no  evidence  of  TEAE  that  was  new  or  unexpected  based  on 
the known safety profiles of rhGH and rhIGF-1. The observed safety data was analysed for any change 
in incidence or severity among subjects receiving combination therapy. 
Hypoglycemia  
Eleven hypoglycemia occurrences have been reported in nine subjects during the present study: 2/26 
(8%)  subjects  in  the  45  rhGH  monotherapy  group  and  7/80  (9%)  in  the  combination  groups.  All  of 
these events occurred within the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group.  
All  hypoglycemic  events  were  mild  except  one  which  was  of  moderate  intensity.  In  three  subjects 
hypoglycemia  was  resolved  spontaneously  while  in  three  other  subjects  it  resolved  following 
unspecified  treatment  (most  likely  food  and/or  juice).  For  the  other  three  subjects  no  information  on 
treatment was reported. No subject had a dose reduction for a hypoglycaemia TEAE.

One  TEAE  of  intracranial  hypertension  has  been  reported  (serious,  moderate,  related)  in  the  45 
GH+100  IGF-1  group  and  one  TEAE  of  papilledema  (serious,  moderate,  related)  in  the  45  GH+150 
IGF-1 group, both of which were recorded as resolved. 
Headache 
Time to event analysis for headache are presented in Figure 21 and Table 42. 
For those subjects who reported headaches, the Kaplan-Meier results demonstrate that headache was 
reported  earlier  by  subjects  treated  with  combination  therapy  (median=19  days;  n=80)  than  with 
rhGH monotherapy (median=73 days; n=26). 
There  seems  to  be  a  trend  between  the  dose  and  the  percentage  of  subjects  experiencing  a  first 
headache in the earlier stage of the study (i.e. at month 8: 38%, 44%, 48% and 62% of the subject in 
the 45 rhGH alone, 45 rhGH+50 rhIGF-1, 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 treatment 
groups had experienced their first headache). However, this trend seems to fade in later phases of the 
study  (after  month  16).  All  subjects  began  treatment  at  half  the  assigned  dose  and  increased  to  full 
assigned dose at Week 2.

Allergic reactions and other immunopathological effects 
As with all cell-derived proteins, allergic reactions and other immunopathological effects are a potential 
risk  with  rhGH  and  rhIGF-1.  In  the  current  study,  nine  subjects  experienced  TEAEs  of  urticaria,  2/26 
(8%)  of  subjects  in  the  rhGH  monotherapy  group  and  7/80  (9%)  of  subjects  in  the  combination 
groups.  
All  nine  subjects  who  experienced  urticaria  were  negative  for  anti-IGF-1  antibodies  on  Day  1.  At  the 
Year 1 sampling, the two subjects in the GH monotherapy group remained negative. Three subjects in 
the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 had missing values due to withdrawal prior to the Year 1 
antibody sampling.  
Two of the subjects in the combination groups experienced AEs of moderate intensity that led to their 
withdrawal  from  treatment.  In  both  cases  an  allergist  confirmed  allergy  to  rhGH  by  skin  prick  test. 
Both events were recorded as resolved following cessation of treatment. 
One subject in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group was anti-IGF-1 antibody negative and three subjects in 
this group were anti-IGF-1 antibody positive. 
The  subjects  that  tested  positive  continued  on  treatment  with  combination  therapy  with  no  further 
incidents of urticaria. 
Considering  the  safety  of  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  in  comparison  with  rhIGF-1  monotherapy,  no 
additional concerns are evident. Notably, the percentage of subjects experiencing hypoglycemia in the 
45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group was lower than the 42% reported in the label for the approved indication 
of rhIGF-1 monotherapy. 
Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events and Other Significant Adverse Events 
No deaths have been reported. SAEs are summarised in Table 43. 
Five  subjects  experienced  SAEs  during  the  study.  Two  of  these  five  subjects  experienced  SAEs 
considered related to treatment by the Investigator: intracranial hypertension and papilledema.  
AEs leading to withdrawal 
A  total  of  ten  subjects  had  AEWDs;  characterized  by  a  reported  disposition  of  withdrawn  due  to  AE 
(table 44.) Six out of ten were considered related to the treatment of which two were in the 45 rhGH 
alone group.

Anti-IGF-1 Antibodies 
The  anti-GH  antibody  assay  was  not  available  at  the  time  of  this  report.  Anti-IGF-1  analysis  results 
were  not  available  for  all  subjects  at  the  time  of  this  report,  but  those  available  are  summarized  in 
Table 49.  
Safety Conclusions 
The  difference  between  rhGH  monotherapy  and  combination  therapy  is  seen  mostly  in  mild  and 
moderate related TEAEs. Proportions of severe related events are similar across all groups.  
Three  subjects  experienced  severe  and  related  events:  headache  in  one  rhGH  monotherapy  subject 
and one combination therapy subject, and injection site hypertrophy in a separate combination therapy 
subject.

There was no evidence of any TEAE that was new or unexpected, based on the known safety profiles of 
rhGH and rhIGF-1. 
Incidence of TEAEs of special interest: hypoglycemia, headache, vomiting and otitis media was higher 
in the 45 rhGH+rh150 IGF-1 group than in all other groups. 
Headache, whether treatment related or not, was reported in more subjects overall than any other PT 
(63/106  subjects).  For  those  subjects  who  experienced  a  headache,  a  Kaplan-Meier  analysis 
demonstrated  that  headache  was  reached  more  quickly  among  subjects  in  the  combination  groups 
(median  time  to  headache  onset=19  days;  n=80)  than  those  in  the  rhGH  monotherapy  group 
(median=73 days; n=26). 
The  PT  with  the  second  highest  incidence  of  treatment  related  TEAEs  was  injection  site  hypertrophy 
(15 subjects, 24 occurrences). All subjects with these events were in the combination groups, as might 
be expected given that combination therapy requires two separate injections. 
Nine  subjects  experienced  TEAEs  of  urticaria,  2/26  (8%)  of  subjects  in  the  rhGH  monotherapy  group 
and 7/80 (9%) of subjects in the combination groups. Two of the subjects in the combination groups 
experienced urticaria of moderate intensity that led to their withdrawal from treatment. 
The  only  treatment  related  SAEs  were  intracranial  hypertension  and  papilledema  in  two  separate 
subjects  receiving  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  and  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1.  Both  events  were  reported  to 
have  resolved  following  dose-interruption.  After  increasing  back  to  the  original  dose,  one  subject 
remained on study. 
Rapporteur’s discussion on clinical aspects 
Currently  mecasermin  is  indicated  for  the  long-term  treatment  of  growth  failure  in  children  and 
adolescents  from  2  to  18  years  with  severe  primary  insulin-like  growth  factor  1  deficiency  (Primary 
IGFD).  
Severe Primary IGFD is defined by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
chronic treatment with pharmacologic doses of anti-inflammatory steroids. 
height standard deviation score ≤–3.0 and 
basal IGF 1 levels below the 2.5th percentile for age and gender and 
GH sufficiency. 
Exclusion  of  secondary  forms  of  IGF  1  deficiency,  such  as  malnutrition,  hypothyroidism,  or 
The dose should be individualised for each patient. The recommended starting dose of mecasermin is 
0.04  mg/kg  of  body  weight  twice  daily  by  subcutaneous  injection.  If  no  significant  adverse  reactions 
occur  for  at  least  one  week,  the  dose  may  be  raised  in  increments  of  0.04  mg/kg  to  the  maximum 
dose of 0.12 mg/kg given twice daily. 
The  current  study,  which  has  been  submitted  to  EMA  in  accordance  with  the  Article  46  of  the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended, was carried out as a “proof of principle”- study in children 
with short stature associated with less severe IGF-1 deficiency (IGF-1 SDS of ≤-1.0, height SDS of ≤-
2.0)  and  in  combination  with  hGH.  Hence  this  indication  and  treatment  combination  are  outside  the 
current  EU-indication  of  mecasermin.  Children  were  treated  with  either  of  rhGH  alone  or  rhGH 
combined  with  50,  100  or  150  μg/kg  mecasermin  daily.  Thus  the  amount  of  a  single  dose  of 
mecasermin  could  be  more  than  for  currently  approved  indication  (120  μg/kg).  The  rationale  for 
testing the combination of hGH and rhIGF-1 therapy for short stature children with low IGF-1 seemed 
logical and the selected treatment combinations seemed to be appropriately chosen.  
This study was prematurely terminated by the sponsor due to company’s strategic reasons. However, 
the original (before amendment to increase the duration to 6 years) three year treatment duration was 
achieved.  
106  subjects  were  recruited  for  this  study.  Actually,  one  subject  was  subsequently  found  to  be  GH 
deficient  and  therefore  excluded  from  the  MITT  population.  The  population  selected  to  MITT  and  the 
statistical methods chosen for the primary and secondary endpoints and sample size seemed adequate. 
Subject characteristics at enrollment were quite well balanced except for a slightly higher proportion of 
females in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 group.

96  out  of  105  subjects  completed  1  year  treatment  with  6  withdrawals  due  to  AE.  The  drop-out  rate 
due  to  AE  was  low  (10)  with  withdrawal  due  mecasermin  related  AE  in  4  subjects.  Altogether  79 
subjects completed the planned 3 year treatment. 
For  some  patients  the  starting  dose  was  too  high  reflecting  dose  reductions  which  were  guided  by 
frequent  IGF-1  level  measurements  guided  by  the  protocol.  4  subjects  in  the  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1 
group and 5 subjects in the 45 rhGH+160 rhIGF-1 group required dose reductions during year 1.  
Anti-IGF-1  analysis  results  were  not  available  for  all  subjects  at  the  time  of  this  report.  However,  in 
subjects with mecasermin treatment 53.8 to 59.3% of the subjects were Anti-IGF-1 antibody positive 
on  year  1  with  ca.  25%  of  the  results  missing.  The  meaning  of  this  antibody  positivity  has  not  been 
discussed  by  the  MAH;  instead,  the  MAH  states  in  their  Clinical  Overview  that  “A  low  and  clinically 
insignificant percentage of anti-IGF-1 antibodies was reported.” This statement is not agreed. The MAH 
should provide the final data (those missing 25% of the analyses, or an explanation why they were not 
reported) and discuss the meaning of it.  
Further, so far, the MAH has not been able to develop an assay for neutralising antibodies. Therefore, 
the MAH is, again, strongly encouraged to finalise the development of that assay and provide analysis 
of clinical samples (primarily of those patients where mecasermin has been used within the approved 
indication;  analysis  of  the  samples  of  the  current  study  could  also  provide  some  further  valuable 
information on the issue), in order to gain understanding of the frequency and clinical relevance of the 
neutralising antibodies against mecasermin. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  the  study  was  height  velocity  during  the  first  year  of  treatment.  It 
was  found  that  the  difference  between  45  rhGH  alone  and  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  was  statistically 
significant with p=0.001. This finding was similar whether subjects who did not complete year 1 were 
imputated  or  not.  In  the  exploratory  sensitivity  analyses  neither  pubertal  status  nor  bone  age  or  the 
presence or absence of anti-IGF-1 affected this statistical significance. 
The  results  for  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  (height  velocity  during  the  second  and  third  year  of 
treatment) were in line with the primary efficacy endpoint. The combination of 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 
was statistically significantly better than 45 rhGH alone for all these endpoints. While some statistically 
significant results were also observed in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 group, the effect of 45 rhGH+150 
rhIGF-1 was more constant. 
For  the  other  secondary  endpoints,  the  first  year  change  in  height  SDS  showed  significant  difference 
between the 45 rhGH alone group and the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group (p=0.003.) All four treatment 
groups demonstrated an improvement in RWT PAH SDS during the first year of treatment. The change 
was higher in the three combination groups. 
The  efficacy  results  demonstrate  that  combination  therapy  with  45  rhGH+150  mecasermin  was 
beneficial with accelerated statural growth in subjects with less severe IGF-1 deficiency than with the 
currently approved indication. 
Regarding  safety,  no  new  safety  concerns  were  found.  More  mild  and  moderate  AEs  were  found  with 
the  combination  therapy  groups  than  in  the  rhGH  alone  group.  Incidence  of  TEAEs  of  special  interest 
such  as  hypoglycemia,  headache,  vomiting  and  otitis  media  was  higher  in  the  45  rhGH+rh150  IGF-1 
group than in all other groups.  
However,  the  incidence  of  hypoglycaemia  (8%  in  the  45  rhGH  alone  group  and  27%  in  the  45 
rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  group)  was  less  than  with  the  already  approved  indication  (47%,  Increlex  SPC). 
The  PT  with  the  second  highest  incidence  of  treatment  related  TEAEs  was  injection  site  hypertrophy 
(15  subjects,  24  occurrences).  The  incidence  of  injection  site  hypertrophy  is  similar  than  previously 
reported (i.e. Study 306, 14%).  
Two of the subjects in the combination groups experienced urticaria of moderate intensity that led to 
their withdrawal from treatment; urticarial is mentioned in the Increlex-SPC. 
The  only  treatment  related  SAEs  were  intracranial  hypertension  and  papilledema  in  two  separate 
subjects  receiving  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  and  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1.  Both  events  were  reported  to 
have  resolved  following  dose-interruption.  After  increasing  back  to  the  original  dose,  one  subject 
remained on study. Also these ADRs are mentioned in the Increlex-SPC.

In general, there were no unexpected TEAEs.  
Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
MAH conclusion 
The  MAH  concludes  that  with  the  new  therapeutic  modality,  namely  the  co-administration  of  two 
recombinant  growth-promoting  hormones  (hGH  45  μg/kg/day  +  rhIGF-1  150  μg/kg/day)  in  children 
with  significant  short  stature  greater  height  velocity  and  change  in  height  SDS  during  three  years  of 
continuous therapy was induced compared to hGH 45 μg/kg/day alone. 
It is also important to note that childhood short stature, and particularly the type represented in this 
study, is not a life-threatening disorder. It may be associated with some psychological stress, although 
this is generally thought to be mild. However there is no proven morbidity associated with its lack of 
treatment.  This  consideration  places  the  safety  aspects  of  the  MS316  study  at  the  forefront  of 
discussion relating to the future of this combination therapy. The most efficacious dose, ie rhIGF-1 150 
μg/kg/day, was associated with more adverse events and abnormally elevated serum IGF-1 levels than 
hGH alone.  
Nevertheless, based on MS 316 study results, the risk benefit of the combination of hGH + rhIGF-1 is 
favourable in the population of children with idiopathic short stature and low IGF 1 levels. 
No regulatory action is deemed necessary as a consequence of these study results.

Rapporteur's conclusion 
The  MAH  has  submitted  the  current  MS316  study  to  EMA  in  accordance  with  the  Article  46  of  the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. The study was carried out as a “proof of principle”- study 
in children with short stature associated with less severe IGF-1 deficiency than in the current EU-SPC 
for  Increlex  and  in  combination  with  hGH.  Hence  the  studied  indication  and  treatment  regimen 
(combination  with  hGH)  are  outside  of  the  current  EU-indication  for  mecasermin.  Further,  it  is 
noteworthy that this studied non-life threatening indication is slightly controversial.  
Children were treated with either of rhGH alone or rhGH combined with different doses of mecasermin. 
The  rationale  for  testing  the  combination  of  hGH  and  rhIGF-1  therapy  for  short  stature  children  with 
low  IGF-1  was  based  on  evidence  of  independent  and  complementary  actions  of  GH  and  IGF-1  to 
promote  growth  and  the  prevalence  of  GH  insensitivity  and  low  serum  IGF-1  levels  in  children  with 
idiopathic short stature. The combination therapy could also potentially limit adverse effects related to 
the use of each agent individually.  
The results of the MS316 study showed that the combination therapy of 45 μg/kg/day hGH + rhIGF-1 
150 μg/kg/day induced larger height velocity and change in height SDS during three years compared 
to  hGH  45ug/kg/day  alone.  The  study  did  not  reveal  any  significant  new  safety  signals.  However,   
occurrence of different adverse events was more frequent in this “high-dose group”.  
This study does not have any impact on the benefit-risk balance of Increlex in its current approved EU-
indication. Thus, the benefit-risk balance of Increlex in the treatment of  “For the long-term treatment 
of growth failure in children and adolescents with severe primary insulin-like growth factor 1 deficiency 
(Primary IGFD). 
Severe Primary IGFD is defined by: 
- height standard deviation score   -3.0 and 
- basal IGF 1 levels below the 2.5th percentile for age and gender and 
- GH sufficiency. 
- Exclusion of secondary forms of IGF-1 deficiency, such as malnutrition, hypothyroidism, or chronic 
treatment with pharmacologic doses of anti-inflammatory steroids. 
Severe Primary IGFD includes patients with mutations in the GH receptor (GHR), post-GHR signaling 
pathway, and IGF-1 gene defects; they are not GH deficient, and therefore, they cannot be expected 
to respond adequately to exogenous GH treatment. It is recommended to confirm the diagnosis by 
conducting an IGF-1 generation test”, 
remains positive.   
Finally,  Anti-IGF-1  analysis  results  were  not  available  for  all  subjects  in  the  study  at  the  time  of  this 
report. In subjects with mecasermin treatment 53.8 to 59.3% of the subjects were Anti-IGF-1 antibody 
positive on year 1 with ca. 25% of the results missing. The meaning of this antibody positivity has not 
been  discussed  by  the  MAH.  The  MAH  should  provide  the  final  data  (those  missing  25%  of  the 
analyses,  or  an  explanation  why  they  were  not  reported)  and  discuss  the  clinical  relevance  of  these 
findings.  
Recommendation  
  Not fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide additional clarifications related to Anti-IGF-1 
antibody findings in the study as part of this procedure Submission of study in accordance with Article 
46, EMEA/H/C/704/P46 (see section “Additional clarifications requested”).

Additional clarifications requested 
1.  Anti-IGF-1 analysis results were not available for all subjects in the study at the time of this report. 
In  subjects  with  mecasermin  treatment  53.8  to  59.3%  of  the  subjects  were  Anti-IGF-1  antibody 
positive on year 1 with ca. 25% of the results missing. The meaning of this antibody positivity has not 
been  discussed  by  the  MAH.  The  MAH  should  provide  the  final  data  (those  missing  25%  of  the 
analyses,  or  an  explanation  why  they  were  not  reported)  and  discuss  the  clinical  relevance  of  these 
findings.  
MAH`s reply to the additional clarifications: 
The MAH has provided Final Bioanalytical Report on the determination of Antibody Response to rhIGF-1 
in  Human  Pediatric  Serum  Samples  of  Clinical  Study  MS316  by  using  a  bridging  electro-
chemoluminescence method. 
In total, 523 including 2 backup samples were derived from 105 subjects over 8 different time-points. 
Each  individual  sample  was  assessed  in  a  confirmatory  assay.  Titer  was  determined  for  96  positive 
samples containing anti-IGF antibodies.  
From the 521 analyzed samples, 96 samples (18.4 %) were found positive after the ECLA confirmatory 
assay.  These  positive  samples  were  obtained  from  40  different  patients.  Thus,  40  out  of  80  patients 
assigned  to  one  of  the  three  treatment  groups  receiving  rhIGF-1  (50  %)  had  at  least  one  positive 
sample for the presence of anti-rhIGF-1 antibodies. 
The last sample of this study period, collected on Visit 14, was obtained from 64 different patients. In 9 
out of these 64 patients (14.1 %), this last sample was found positive for the presence of anti-rhIGF-1 
antibodies. 
Binding anti-rhIGF-1 antibody (ADA) development is a common finding during rhIGF-1 treatment and 
is detected in approximately half of patients during the first year; but it appears to have no effect on 
response.  In  Ipsen  clinical  studies  MS301,  MS306  and  MS308,  the  percentage  of  patients  who 
developed  binding  ADA  ranged  between  46%  and  87%.  In  this  study  percentage  of  patients  with  at 
least one positive sample for the presence of anti rhIGF-1 antibodies (50 %) was similar to what has 
been previously observed. In addition only in 9 out of the 64 patients from whom the last visit sample 
was  available  this  was  found  positive  showing  that,  in  the  vast  majority  of  the  cases,  antibodies 
positivity  was  transient.  In  these  patients  the  observed  growth  rate  at  year  1  was  not  different  from 
the  one  observed  in  the  entire  efficacy  population,  further  confirming  a  lack  of  clinical  significance  of 
ADA development on IGF-1 effectiveness. 
Among  the  five  patients  who  experienced  a  related  SAE,  one  in  the  rhGH  +  IGF-1  100  μg  group 
showed also a single sample positive for anti rhIGF-1 antibodies even if the nature of SAE (Intracranial 
pressure  increased)  does  not  have  any  relation  with  the  antibodies  development.  Another  patient  in 
the same group of treatment, who experienced a related drug hypersensitivity AE that led to patient’s 
withdrawn  from  the  study,  showed  one  single  sample  positive  for  anti  rhIGF-1  antibodies.  No  lack  of 
efficacy has been reported. 
The MAH concludes that: 
- The proportion of patients with at least one positive sample for anti rhIGF-1 antibodies 
is in the same range of other previously submitted Ipsen studies (MS301, MS306, 
MS308) and of the published literature mentioned above 
- The majority of patients presented transient positivity of anti rhIGF-1 antibodies 
- No evidence of relationship between positive results and occurrence of SAEs could be 
concluded 
- No lack of efficacy was reported 
- Clinical relevance of development of anti rhIGF-1 seems to be limited and not to have 
significant impact on efficacy and safety of rhIGF-1 treatment

Rapporteur’s comment on MAH’s reply 
The  Electrochemiluminiscence  (ECL)  bridging  assay  was  developed  for  detection  of  anti-rhIGF-1  in 
blood samples of pediatric patients. Briefly, during incubation period of the assay potential anti-rhIGF-
1  antibodies  bind  both  to  the  SulfoTAG  labeled  rhIGF-1  (reporter)  and  biotinylated-rhIGF-1.  The 
complexes of anti-rhIGF-1/SulfoTAG-rhIGF-1/biotinylated-rhIGF-1 are captured on streptavidin coated 
microtiter  plates.  After  washing  the  unbound  biotinylated-rhIGF-1  and  SulfoTAG-rhIGF-1  the 
chemiluminescence  signal  emitted  by  SulfoTag  in  the  anti-rhIGF-1/SulfoTAG-rhIGF-1/biotinylated-
rhIGF-1  complexes  is  measured.  The  signal  is  proportional  to  the  quantity  of  anti-rhIGF-1  antibodies 
present  in  the  samples.  The  plan  for  analytical  testing  of  anti-IGF-1  antibodies  in  paediatric  human 
serum  samples  using  the  bridging  assay  (screening  method,  confirmatory  assay  and  titration)  was 
described  and  endorsed  in  EMEA/H/C/000704  report  dated  21.01.2010.  The  validation  data  provided 
for  the  assay  was  considered  to  demonstrate  its  specificity,  appropriate  sensitivity,  repeatability, 
precision  and  accuracy.  MAH  had  also  evaluated  all  possibilities  for  assay  interference  providing 
convincing data.  
The modified intent-to-treat population of the study MS316 comprised 105 subjects. According to the 
original study protocol, anti-IGF-1 antibodies were measured 8 times during this study.  However, the 
study  was  prematurely  terminated  after  the  last  subject  attended  Visit  14  (completed  Year  3). 
Therefore  the  last  assessment  was  made  on  Visit  14  and  according  to  the  study  protocol  anti-IGF-1 
antibodies were measured 5 times during this study (not 8 times as MAH states). The MAH is asked to 
comment on this discrepancy.  
The MAH previously presented baseline and Year 1 anti-IGF-1 antibody data from the safety population 
(106  subjects)  with  ca.  25%  of  the  results  missing.  Now  the  MAH  states  that  521  samples  were 
derived  from  105  subjects  over  8  different  time-points.  The  MAH  has  not  provided  exact  details 
informing how many samples were evaluated at 5 (8?) different time points (Visit 2, 5, 8, 11 and 14). 
Therefore it is impossible to draw any conclusions on whether the results from 521 samples evaluated 
are really informative regarding the anti-IGF-1 antibody data of the study MS316 or not.  
The MAH should provide exact details on how many samples were evaluated on different time points. 
At  the  moment  it  is  impossible  to  know  the  amount  of  missing  anti-IGF-1  antibody  data  at  different 
time points. 
From the 521 analyzed samples, 96 samples (18.4 %) were found positive from 40 different patients. 
The  MAH  states  that  40  out  of  80  patients  assigned  to  one  of  the  three  treatment  groups  receiving 
rhIGF-1  (50  %)  had  at  least  one  positive  sample  for  the  presence  of  anti-rhIGF-1  antibodies.  This 
finding is in in line with previous data on anti-IGF-1 antibodies. Importantly, it seems that majority of 
patients  has  transient  positivity  of  anti-IGF-1  antibodies  and  there  were  no  relationship  between 
antibody  positivity  and  occurrence  of  SAE.  In  addition  no  lack  of  efficacy  relating  to  the  antibody 
positivity was found. 
In  conclusion,  the  MAH  has  provided  anti-IGF-1  antibody  data  from  521  samples  analysed  from  105 
subjects  over  8  different  time-points.  However,  the  study  was  prematurely  terminated  and  according 
to  the  study  protocol  anti-IGF-1  antibodies  were  measured  5  times  during  this  study  (not  8  times  as 
MAH  states).  In  addition,  the  MAH  has  not  provided  exact  details  informing  how  many  samples  were 
evaluated at 5 (8?) different time points.  
It seems that the results of anti-IGF-1 antibodies do not influence the benefit risk balance of Increlex. 
However,  the  full  analysis  of  these  results  is  not  possible  due  to  multiple  discrepancies  found  in  the 
response provided by the MAH. 
The following issues should be clarified: 
1)  According  to  the  original  study  protocol,  anti-IGF-1  antibodies  were  measured  8  times  during  this 
study.    However,  the  study  was  prematurely  terminated  after  the  last  subject  attended  Visit  14 
(completed  Year  3).  Therefore  the  last  assessment  was  made  on  Visit  14  and  according  to  the  study 
protocol anti-IGF-1 antibodies were measured 5 times during this study (not 8 times as MAH states). 
The MAH is asked to comment on this discrepancy. 
2)  The  MAH  has  not  provided  exact  details  informing  how  many  samples  were  evaluated  at  5  (8?) 
different  time  points  (Visit  2,  5,  8,  11  and  14)  and  the  MAH  should  provide  these  details.    At  the

MAH’s reply to the second list of outstanding issues/ Additional clarifications requested 
Question 1 - Summary of the MAH’s response 
In the original study protocol, study duration was 3 years and IGF-1 antibody assays were scheduled 
at visits 2, 5, 8, 11 and 14. 
In the Protocol amendment 2 the study was extended to 6 years to provide safety and efficacy data on 
longer-term use of combination GH and IGF-1 and additional IGF-1 antibody assays were scheduled at 
visits 17, 20 and 23. 
The  study  was  prematurely  terminated  by  the  sponsor,  following  a  review  of  company’s  strategies, 
when the last subject completed visit 14 as foreseen in the original protocol. 
Therefore  anti-IGF-1  Antibodies  assays  were  performed  5  times  according  to  the  original  Schedule  of 
Assessment. Consequently, only two samples were collected at visit 17. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH states that due to premature termination of the study (last subject completed visit 14) anti-
IGF-1 Antibodies assays were performed 5 times according to the original Schedule of Assessment.  
The MAH`s clarification is acceptable. 
Conclusion 
Point is solved. 
Question 2 - Summary of the MAH’s response

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The  MAH  has  clarified  the  number  of  samples  analysed  for  the  presence  of  antibodies  to  rhIGF-1  at 
different  time  points  according  to  the  study  protocol.  However,  the  MAH  has  not  provided  direct 
information regarding of number of subjects at each visit vs. number of samples analysed at each visit. 
Nevertheless,  according  to  the  study  report  and  MAH`s  clarification  the  number  of  subjects  and 
analyses at different time points is presented below: 
1.  At visit 2, 106 subjects were randomized (98 samples measured) 
2.  At visit 8, 96 subjects completed 1 year (90 samples measured) 
3.  At visit 11, 85 subjects completed 2 years (81 samples measured) 
4.  At visit 14, 79 subjects completed 3 years (63 samples measured) 
5.  Early termination (Amendment 2), 57 subjects (53 samples) 
It  seems  that  the  number  of  missing  analyses  is  low  despite  of  visit  14  time  point  (16  missing 
samples). 
It can be concluded that the number of missing samples is not considered to diminish the value of the 
anti-IGF-1 antibody data from the study MS316. 
Conclusion 
Point is solved. 
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
No further action required.

Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Xultophy 
insulin degludec / liraglutide 
On 21 May 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion 
recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Xultophy. The 
marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Novo Nordisk A/S. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows2:  
“Xultophy is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control 
in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products when these alone or combined with a GLP-1 
receptor agonist or combined with basal insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 
4.4 and 5.1 for available data on the different combinations).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 days 
from adoption of the opinion

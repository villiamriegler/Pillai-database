final results from study D7220C00001; this is a 
phase 2/3 partially double-blinded, randomised, 
multinational, active-controlled study in both 
previously vaccinated and unvaccinated adults to 
determine the safety and immunogenicity of 
AZD2816, a vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 
caused by variant strains of SARS-CoV-2. The RMP 
version 8 succession number 3 was submitted to 
consolidate the updates made in RMP as part of two 
parallel procedures (EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0096 and

The interim analysis results for the Boost Cohort of Study 
D7220C00001 were submitted previously based on a data 
lock point of 11 October 2021. These data were assessed 
within the procedure EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0052, and 
consequently, the product information was updated 
including the possibility of administering Vaxzevria as a 
homologous or heterologous booster (in subjects who 
previously had received an mRNA vaccine).  
In this procedure, the final study results have been 
submitted. The results from the final analysis are consistent 
with those provided with the interim analysis. No new 
safety concern has been identified. Minor labelling updates, 
such as, for example, update of the percentages of adverse 
drug reactions, neutralising antibody titres and GMT ratio, 
have been implemented in Sections 4.8 and 5.1.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
The MAH has submitted the final pooled analysis of the 
safety, durability of efficacy, and immunogenicity of 
primary vaccination with AZD1222, based on data collected 
for up to 12 months after the first dose in studies COV001, 
COV002, COV003 and COV005 with a data cut-off (DCO) of 
31 December 2021. In addition, the MAH provided the 
individual clinical study reports (CSRs) for COV001, 
COV002, COV003 and COV005 that summarise durability of 
efficacy results and cumulative immunogenicity and safety 
results. 
Overall, the final pooled vaccine efficacy (VE) results 
demonstrate an estimated durability of VE consistent with 
the previously submitted primary pooled analysis estimates 
of VE against SARS-CoV-2 virologically confirmed 
symptomatic illness, severe disease and death. 
The final pooled immunogenicity analysis provided similar 
results to those obtained at the time of the initial 
conditional marketing authorisation, both in terms of GMTs 
and seroconversion rates reached after first and second 
dose regardless of the humoral immunological assay used.  
The safety evaluation based on the results presented from 
the updated pooled analysis does not differ substantially 
from those submitted at the time of the conditional 
marketing authorisation. A higher reactogenicity (both local 
and systemic events) was observed in participants in the in 
AZD1222 group compared to those in the control group. 
These events were reported less frequently and milder after 
the second dose than after the first dose. Similarly, 
unsolicited adverse events (AE) were reported more 
frequently in AZD1222 group than in control group. The 
majority were mild to moderate in severity and were 
Page 4/31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reported less frequently after the second dose in both 
AZD1222 and the comparator. Overall frequencies of either 
solicited local and systemic AEs and unsolicited AEs remain 
barely unchanged to those initially provided, except for 
“dizziness” and “abdominal pain” which frequency has 
increased from uncommon to common and “fever” which 
frequency has increased from common to very common.

II, Labelling 
The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on 
and PL 
the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and 
having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product continue to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated. Furthermore, the CHMP 
considered that, as all Specific Obligations have been 
fulfilled or reclassified as Recommendations or Category 3 
studies in the RMP, there are no remaining grounds for the 
marketing authorisations to remain conditional and 
therefore recommends the granting of the MA no subject to 
Specific Obligations for Vaxzevria.

follow-up analysis from study D8110C00001 listed as 
a specific obligation in the Annex II; this is a phase 
III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter study in adults to determine the safety, 
efficacy and immunogenicity of Vaxzevria. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement 
other administrative updates in the product 
information.  The RMP version 5.2 has also been 
submitted. The MAH removed the important 
identified risk of anaphylaxis from the list of safety 
concerns, updated the routine and additional 
pharmacovigilance activities section and took the 
opportunity to implement other administrative 
updates. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo 
controlled follow up, representing up to 6 months follow-up 
data (data cut-off date: 30 July 2021).  
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint for the 
double-blind period included 325 adjudicated events 
occurring at least 15 days post second dose of study 
vaccine. There were 141 events in the AZD1222 group and 
184 events in the placebo group, with a vaccine efficacy 
(VE) estimate of 66.98% and a lower bound of the 95% CI 
of 58.87%.  
In participants between 18 to and 65 years of age, a VE 
estimate of 64.76% and a lower bound of the 95% CI of 
55.73%. In participants older than 65 years of age, a VE 
estimate of 86.35% and a lower bound of the 95% CI of 
65.79%.  The SmPC section 5.1 has been updated with a 
summary of these results.  
Four secondary endpoints were analysed for events at least 
15 days post second dose of study intervention, and all 4 
results were generally consistent with the primary analysis. 
In participants with or without evidence of prior infection, 
the VE was 66.96%. VE against severe or critical 
symptomatic COVID-19 was 95.69%. In relation to the 
incidence of COVID-19 related emergency departments 
visits, a VE of 94.17% was shown. The incidence of the first 
post treatment response for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid 
antibodies occurring at least 15 days after the second dose 
of study intervention, regardless of symptoms, resulted in a 
VE estimate of 61.01%.   
The safety data reported from the 6-months follow-up did 
not reveal new safety concerns for AZD1222.  The most 
common adverse drug reactions (ADR) were consistent 
with the adverse reactions commonly observed following

Protein Interaction with Platelet Factor 4 (PF4)” 
which is the first report requested within the required 
studies for "in vitro interaction of AZD1222 or spike 
protein with PF4 and/or platelets" as reflected in the 
RMP; and the study report for 520447 "Investigative 
Vaccine Study in the Mouse" to evaluate spike 
protein levels and haematology parameters. 
C.I.11.b - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the 
obligations and conditions of a marketing 
authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of 
change(s) which require to be further substantiated 
by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH 
where significant assessment is required 
under Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities in the EU Risk 
Management Plan (RMP) for Vaxzevria.  This in vitro assay 
was conducted to determine the release of spike protein 
from transduced cells. The study results show that spike 
protein is produced by AZD1222-transduced cells, which is 
cleaved and released from the cell surface. The lack of full-
length spike protein detection in the supernatant and the 
fact that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels did not rise 
with multiplicities of infection (MOI) suggests that the 
presence of shed spike protein was not responsible of cell 
death. 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, the above 
mentioned obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore it is 
recommended that it is deleted from the Annex II.

The MAH has provided the primary analysis of study

II and PL 
D8110C00001. This is a randomised, double-blinded, 
data 
placebo-controlled phase III study conducted in the United 
States, Peru and Chile aimed to assess the efficacy, safety 
and immunogenicity of Vaxzevria. The vaccine efficacy (VE) 
results against COVID-19 symptomatic disease was 74.0% 
(95%CI: 65.3 – 80.5). The VE estimate was also 
determined in participants ≥65 years of age [VE: 83.5% 
(95%CI:  54.2 – 94.1)]. Severe or critical symptomatic 
COVID-19 disease was also evaluated. No cases of severe 
or critical symptomatic COVID-19 were reported in the 
vaccine group compared with 8 cases reported in the 
placebo group. Overall, the observed safety profile is in line 
with the results included in the product information. The 
study results led to the addition of the following adverse 
drug reactions (with their respective frequencies) in the 
product information: facial paralysis (rare) and muscle 
spasms (uncommon).

I/II), COV002 (Phase II/III), COV003 (Phase II/III) and 
COV005 (Phase I/II). These trials were the basis of 
granting the conditional marketing authorisation.  
At the time of analysis, participants that received 1 dose of 
Vaxzevria was extended from 12,021 to 12,282 and from 
8,266 to 10,448 those who received 2 doses of Vaxzevria. 
With 7,158 participants completing >2 months follow-up 
post-dose 2. Due to the modest extend of both the size and 
long-term exposure of the safety database, the overall 
frequencies of adverse events remain barely unchanged to 
those initially approved. 
The updated safety data has resulted in the addition of the 
following adverse drug reactions (with their respective 
frequencies) in the product information: urticaria 
(uncommon), abdominal pain (uncommon), pain in 
extremity (common), influenza-like illness (common), 
asthenia (common) and lethargy (uncommon). The MAH 
also took the opportunity to add angioedema with 
frequency not known, as requested within procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005675/LEG/036.1.  
The vaccine efficacy estimates in the product information 
remained unchanged. 
The product information wording in relation to shelf-life for

events were assessed within the signal procedure on 
embolic and thrombotic events with Vaxzevria (EPITT 
19683). The signal evaluation lead to the update of the 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to reflect 
thrombocytopenia as an adverse reaction, with a frequency 
of common, based on data from clinical trials and to include 
thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia with 
frequency of very rare.  
Following an update to the Company Core Data Sheet 
(CCDS) in relation to thromboembolism with 
thrombocytopenia, the marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) presented a dataset including thromboembolic 
events with thrombocytopenia, along with proposals to 
contraindicate the vaccine to patients who have 
experienced major venous and/or arterial thrombosis in 
combination with thrombocytopenia following vaccination 
with any COVID-19 vaccine, to update the warnings on 
thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders and include 
the frequency thrombosis with thrombocytopenia of "less 
than 1/100,000".  
No new unexpected safety findings regarding the events of 
thrombosis with thrombocytopenia were identified based on 
the submitted data (cut-off date of 08 April 2021).  
Based on a thorough review of this latest information, the 
product information has been updated to introduce a 
contraindication to individuals who have experienced 
thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) 
following vaccination with Vaxzevria, and warnings for 
Healthcare professionals to check for signs of thrombosis in 
any person who has thrombocytopenia within 3 weeks of 
vaccination with Vaxzevria, and similarly, for signs of 
thrombocytopenia in any person who has thrombosis within 
Page 28/31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 weeks of vaccination. It was also highlighted that any 
symptoms suggestive of thrombosis and/or 
thrombocytopenia should trigger immediate medical 
attention.   
The package leaflet was updated accordingly.

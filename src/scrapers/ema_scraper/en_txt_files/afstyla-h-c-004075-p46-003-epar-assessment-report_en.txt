2.1.  Information on the development program 
Afstyla was evaluated within three clinical studies: 
CSL627_1001: This was a completed pivotal Phase I/III, prospective, multicenter, open label study to 
evaluate the PK, efficacy (on-demand, routine prophylaxis, surgical prophylaxis), and safety in 175 
adolescents and adult subjects (aged 12 to 65 years) with severe haemophilia A. 
CSL627_3002: This was a completed Phase III, prospective, multicenter, open label, paediatric study 
to evaluate the PK, efficacy (on-demand and routine prophylaxis), and safety in 85 children aged less 
than 12 years with severe haemophilia A. 
CSL627_3001: This was a completed Phase III, prospective, multicenter, open label, extension study 
to evaluate the safety (long-term safety and inhibitor development) and efficacy (on-demand, routine 
prophylaxis, surgery, Immune tolerance induction (ITI) substudy) in previously treated patients (PTPs) 
and previously untreated patients (PUPs). The extension study 3001 was conducted to fulfill the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) postmarketing requirement of at least 200 PTPs with at least 100 
exposure days (EDs) as stipulated in the EMA “Guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant 
and human plasma-derived factor VIII products”, adopted 21 July 2011. 
comment:  
A line listing of all the concerned studies is requested (RSI). 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Afstyla (Recombinant Single-Chain Factor VIII or rVIII-SingleChain) is used for the treatment and 
prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A as replacement therapy. The active substance, 
lonoctocog alfa, is expressed and secreted by Chinese hamster ovary cells. It is a B-domain truncated 
variant of human factor VIII defined by covalently bonded FVIII heavy and light chains within a single 
polypeptide structure. It is formulated as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, preservative-free, lyophilized, 
powder for intravenous administration provided in a single-use vial. Each single-use vial contains 
nominally 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU or 3000 IU (International Units) of rVIII-SingleChain for 
reconstitution with sterile water for injection (2.5 ml sWFI: 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU; 5.0 ml sWFI: 
2000 IU, 3000 IU).

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report from PUPs of the Study CSL627_3001 (Arm 2). This study was 
completed for PUPs (last subject visit) in January 2021, the completed Clinical Study Report (CSR) 
dated June 2021. 
A summary of the final results from PTPs in this study (Arms 1 and 3, completed for PTPs in December 
2018) was submitted to EMA in January 2020 (eCTD sequence 68 / procedure reference 
EMEA/H/C/004075/MEA/002.1). The final report for PTPs dated 28 November 2019.  
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number and title 
CSL 627_3001 - A Phase 3 Open-Label, Multicenter, Extension Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy 
of Recombinant Coagulation Factor VIII (rVIII-SingleChain, CSL627) in Subjects with Severe 
Hemophilia A. 
Description 
Study 3001 was a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, multiple-arm, phase 3 extension study to 
investigate the safety and efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain in PTPs and PUPs with severe hemophilia A 
(FVIII activity levels < 1%). The study aimed to evaluate routine prophylaxis and on-demand 
treatment of bleeding episodes in at least 200 PTPs who achieved at least 100 EDs to rVIII-SingleChain 
(Study Arms 1 and 3) as well as in PUPs who achieved at least 50 EDs (Study Arm 2). 
A main objective of this study was to collect information on inhibitor formation in PUPs 0 to < 18 years 
of age. In this regard, the EMA guideline in effect in 2011 stated that approval of the indication in PUPs 
will be based on a clinical trial in a minimum of 50 PUPs evaluated for efficacy and safety during at 
least 50 EDs. Thus, in line with the guideline in effect at time of study planning and implementation of 
Study Amendment 3, this extension study was planned to a) fulfill the EMA requirements for a 
postmarketing investigation to attain 100 EDs in at least 200 PTPs (completed) and b) acquire efficacy 
and safety data in at least 50 PUPs attaining at least 50 EDs to rVIII-SingleChain. Per Protocol 
Amendment 4, the number of PUPs was reduced to at least 24, with each PUP remained in the study 
until they achieved at least 75 EDs (Study Amendment 5). 
A surgical substudy (open to subjects from all study arms) investigated the use of rVIII-SingleChain in 
surgery. Additionally, an immune tolerance induction (ITI) substudy in PUPs was implemented to 
investigate the use of rVIII-SingleChain as ITI therapy in PUPs who develop an inhibitor to rVIII-
SingleChain in the main study. 
Study Period (for PUPs): 
- First Subject Visit: 26 August 2015 
- Last Subject Visit: 19 January 2021 
- Clinical Study Report (for PUPs; Arm 2) Version 1.0 dated 25 June 2021

• 
• 
• 
To further characterize the safety profile of rVIII-SingleChain with respect to inhibitor 
development. 
To characterize the safety profile of rVIII-SingleChain with respect to antibodies against rVIII-
SingleChain and antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) proteins. 
To collect and evaluate the number of rVIII-SingleChain injections required for the treatment 
of bleeding episodes.

4-point efficacy evaluation of surgical treatment scale. 
To assess the occurrence of clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs after rVIII-
SingleChain administration. 
Exploratory Objectives (PUPs [Arm 2]): 
• 
• 
To characterize the relationship between inhibitor development and exposure to rVIII-
SingleChain in PUPs. 
Immune tolerance induction (ITI) substudy: to investigate the use of rVIII-SingleChain in ITI in 
PUPs who develop an inhibitor to rVIII-SingleChain. 
Study design 
The study was a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, multiple-arm extension study. It was 
performed at study sites in 7 countries (Italy, Lebanon, Malaysia, Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, 
United States). Eligible subjects were males diagnosed with severe hemophilia A (FVIII activity levels 
< 1%). Subjects in Arm 1 were PTPs who had participated in a previous CSL-sponsored clinical study 
with rVIII-SingleChain. Subjects in Arm 3 were PTPs who had not participated in a previous CSL-
sponsored clinical study with rVIII-SingleChain. Subjects in Arm 2 were PUPs who had not participated 
in any clinical study with rVIII-SingleChain and had no other prior exposure to any FVIII product.

Study population /Sample size 
For study Arm 2, eligible subjects aged 0 to < 18 years with severe congenital hemophilia A (FVIII 
activity < 1%) with no prior exposure to any FVIII product (with the exception of short-term use of 
blood products). Exclusion criteria include family history of FVIII inhibitors, known other coagulations 
disorder, receiving non-permitted therapy, prior evidence of thrombosis, hypersensitivity to rVIII-
SingleChain or any excipients or CHO proteins, low platelet count at screening, HIV-positive subjects 
(exceptions possible).  
For the ITI substudy, eligible PUPs of Arm 2 had to show an inhibitor titer ≥ 0.6 BU/mL (confirmed by 
repeat testing at the central laboratory). PTPs, subjects with evidence of thrombosis or planned 
immunosuppressive therapy or inhibitor relapse (2 consecutive inhibitor samples with an inhibitor titer 
≥ 0.6 BU/mL, analyzed by the central laboratory after a successful first ITI attempt) were not to be 
enrolled. 
As per Protocol Amendment 4, dated 01 October 2019, this study was planned to enroll a total of at 
least 200 PTPs with at least 100 EDs (Arms 1 and 3) and at least 24 PUPs (Arm 2). Any subject 
requiring surgery during the course of the study could participate in the surgery substudy, with the 
exception of inhibitor positive PUPs as the surgical procedure should be covered by a bypassing agent 
and not by rVIII-SingleChain.  
Treatments 
In Arm 2 (PUPs), the investigator determined the rVIII-SingleChain dose and dosing schedule at their 
discretion, taking into consideration the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) guidelines (2012), 
subject age, and other disease characteristics (eg, bleeding phenotype). In the event of a bleeding 
episode, subjects were treated at a dose predetermined by the investigator based on the type and 
severity of the bleeding episode. The desired FVIII level for the treatment of a bleeding episode (on-
demand treatment) was based on the WFH guidelines (2012).  
Inhibitor negative subjects remained in the study until they achieved 75 EDs with rVIII-SingleChain. 
For ITI therapy, the timepoint of initiation was determined by the investigator based on the inhibitor 
titer and taking into account the criteria outlined below. At the investigator’s discretion, the following 
subjects could have an optional waiting period of up to 6 months prior ITI therapy (inhibitor titer of > 
10 BU/mL and to allow the inhibitor titer to decrease to ≤ 10 BU/mL, need for a central venous access 
device for ITI therapy). During the waiting period, the subject must not receive any dose of rVIII-
SingleChain, and bleeding episodes had to be treated with bypassing agents. Subjects eligible for ITI 
were to assign either low-dose regimen of 50 IU/kg 3 times weekly or intermediate-dose regimen of 
100 IU/kg daily, or High-dose regimen of 200 IU/kg daily (may be split into 2 doses of 100 IU/kg 
daily). A change to a less intense regimen if the subject’s inhibitor titer showed a decrease was 
permitted to avoid excessively high FVIII levels. ITI treatment was to continue until ITI success 
(inhibitor titer of < 0.6 BU/mL at 2 consecutive visits), ITI therapy failure (24 months of ITI therapy 
without achieving inhibitor eradication), or subject discontinuation, whichever occurred first.

Statistical Methods 
All safety and efficacy endpoints were summarized or listed as appropriate. Continuous data were 
summarized using descriptive statistics, and categorical data were summarized using frequency counts 
and percentages. No formal interim analyses were planned. 
Efficacy Analysis 
The PUP Efficacy Population comprised all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of rVIII-
SingleChain for either routine prophylaxis treatment or on-demand treatment during the study. The 
PUP Surgery Population comprised all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of rVIII-
SingleChain for surgical prophylaxis. The ITI Population included all PUPs who received at least 1 dose 
of rVIII-SingleChain to treat their inhibitor. The number of bleeds and the number of treated bleeds 
were presented. The investigator’s clinical assessment of hemostatic efficacy for the treatment of 
major bleeding episodes, based on the 4-point ordinal scale (“excellent”, “good”, “moderate”, “poor / 
no response”), was tabulated. The percentage of major bleeding episodes treated successfully (defined 
as ratings of “excellent” or “good”) was summarized and reported together with a 2-sided 95% CI. To 
estimate the proportion, the denominator included all treated bleeding episodes categorized as major. 
To account for within-subject correlation, generalized linear modeling using SAS’ GENMOD procedure 
was utilized. The model contained only the intercept term. The binomial distribution with logit link 
function was specified. The investigator’s clinical assessment of hemostatic efficacy for the treatment 
of nonmajor bleeding episodes was analyzed as described for major bleeding episodes above. ABR was 
presented for total, traumatic, unknown, and joint bleeds. A summary of ABR by inhibitor status was 
performed if the efficacy evaluation period was ≥ 8 weeks for the given inhibitor status. The AsBR was

summarized by regimen (on-demand or prophylaxis) using descriptive statistics. In addition, the 
number of spontaneous bleeding episodes per year and associated 95% CI was estimated based on a 
Poisson distribution. Generalized linear modeling using SAS’ GENMOD procedure was utilized. The 
Poisson distribution with log link function and log time offset was specified. The number and 
percentage of bleeding episodes requiring 1, 2, 3, or > 3 injections of rVIII-SingleChain to achieve 
hemostasis were summarized using frequency counts and percentages. The consumption of rVIII-
SingleChain, was derived and expressed in terms of IU/kg per month, IU/kg per year, total IU per 
injection, per month and per year. Consumption was summarized using descriptive statistics for on-
demand, prophylaxis, and surgery. 
Surgical Substudy 
The investigator’s overall clinical assessment of hemostatic efficacy for surgical prophylaxis based on 
the 4-point ordinal efficacy evaluation for surgical treatment scale (excellent, good, moderate, poor / 
no response) was tabulated overall and by type of surgery (ie, emergency surgeries, nonemergency 
surgeries). The treatment success rate, defined as the percentage of surgical hemostasis ratings of 
excellent or good, was presented. The following information was summarized using descriptive 
statistics, or presented qualitatively as appropriate: Predicted and estimated blood loss during surgery; 
predicted and actual transfusion requirements during surgery; change in hemoglobin levels between 
baseline, during surgery, and after surgery. 
ITI Population 
A summary of the consumption of rVIII-SingleChain for inhibitor treatment period was provided. 
Number and percentages of subjects achieving an eradication to ITI treatment with rVIII-SingleChain 
was presented with a 2-sided exact 95% CI. The percentage of subjects achieving an eradication was 
calculated based on the ITI Population. 
Other Efficacy Analyses 
The characteristics of bleeding episodes including the type of event (traumatic or spontaneous or 
unknown causality) and the location of bleeding (joint, muscle, mucosal or other) were summarized 
using frequency counts and percentages. 
Safety Analysis 
Safety analysis was based on Safety Population. The Safety Population comprised all the PUP Enrolled 
Population who received at least 1 dose of rVIII-SingleChain during the study for any reason (eg, 
surgery, routine prophylaxis, on-demand treatment). Incidence of transient inhibitors (negative results 
within 6 months after positive result) in PUPs was also provided. Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates were 
used to analyze the cumulative risk of occurrence overall, for subjects with low-titer (ie, inhibitor titer 
of ≤ 5 BU/mL) and high-titer (> 5 BU/mL) inhibitor formation over increasing exposure to rVIII-
SingleChain. The number of subjects at risk and the rate of both low-titer and high-titer occurrence 
were summarized. The number and percentage of subjects who experienced at least 1 adverse event 
(AE) and the number of events were summarized by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term 
(PT). Additional treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) summaries included all AEs (including TEAEs and AEs 
that were not treatment-emergent), related TEAEs, TEAEs by maximum severity, TEAEs leading to 
death, treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TE SAEs), related SAEs, and TEAEs leading to 
withdrawal. Laboratory parameters (hematology and biochemistry), noninhibitory antidrug antibodies 
(ADAs) screening test results, and test results for antibodies against CHO cells were summarized. All 
other safety data (cluster of differentiation 4 [CD4] lymphocyte count, virology, vital signs, physical 
examination, and incremental recovery [IR]) were summarized using descriptive statistics and were 
listed.

For subjects enrolled in the ITI substudy and included in the ITI Population, inhibitor titer over time 
was summarized. The historical peak titer (ie, the highest inhibitor titer before initiation of ITI 
treatment) and the peak titer during ITI treatment were identified for each subject and summarized 
separately. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Overall, Arm 2 of Study 3001 included 24 PUPs aged 0 to 5 years, of whom 21 subjects (87.5%) 
attained > 50 EDs. 
19 subjects completed the study, and 5 subjects discontinued the study. Three subjects discontinued 
the study as per physician’s decision, 1 subject discontinued because of an AE (high-titer inhibitor) 
before the ITI substudy was implemented, and 1 subject (4.2%) discontinued because of overseas 
relocation. Of the 24 PUPs, 12 were initially assigned to on-demand treatment. 11 on-demand subjects 
switched to a once-weekly prophylaxis regimen, and this switch occurred between 9 and 650 days 
(1.78 years) after receiving the initial on-demand treatment. 
Baseline data 
Only male subjects were enrolled into this study. Overall, the majority of subjects were White (62.5% 
of subjects); 29.2% of subjects were Black or African American and 8.3% were Asian. With regard to 
ethnicity, 4.2% of subjects were Hispanic or Latino and 95.8% of subjects were not Hispanic or Latino. 
The mean age was 1.4 years (range 0-5). Mean weight was 10.1 kg (range 3.8-20.0), mean height 
76.3 cm (range 54-110). 8 subjects were enrolled in South Africa, 2 in Malaysia, 1 in the United 
States, and 3 each the Lebanon, Netherlands, and Portugal. 
Two subjects in the Surgery Population (N=3) were Black or African American and 1 was White. The 
mean age was 1.7 years. The majority of subjects in the ITI Population (N=11) were White (9 
subjects) the remaining 2 subjects were Black or African American. The mean age of the subjects was 
1.2 years (range 0-3).  
In the 12 months before study entry, the incidence of bleeding episodes in the PUP Safety Population 
(N=24) was low (5 out of 24 (20.8%) had reported bleeding events at screening). The mean incidence 
of spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes in the last 12 months calculated for all (N=24) 
subjects before study entry was 0.2 and 0.4.

Efficacy results 
There were a total of 385 bleeding episodes during the study in PUPs. Of these, 315 bleeding episodes 
were treated with rVIII-SingleChain, of which 312 were treated with rVIII-SingleChain alone, and 3 
were treated with rVIII-SingleChain and bypassing agent; 50 bleeding events did not require any 
treatment, 20 were treated with bypassing agent alone. Of the 315 treated bleeding episodes, 1 was 
major and 60 were nonmajor. The majority of spontaneous bleeding episodes that required treatment 
were located in other locations (75 bleeding episodes), followed by muscle (65 bleeding episodes), and 
joint (57 bleeding episodes). 
Overall Haemostatic Efficacy 
92.1% (290 of 315) treated bleeding episodes had a response rated as “excellent” or “good” (95% CI: 
87.0 to 95.3). The percentage of bleeding events rated as “excellent” or “good” was similar on the on-
demand and prophylaxis regimens (91.2% and 92.2%, respectively). The results from the sensitivity 
analyses (ie, all missing data excluded, or all missing data counted as treatment success) were similar 
to the primary analysis results.

comment: 
A total of 315 bleeding events have been treated with Afstyla with a treatment succes rate of 92.4%. 1 
major bleeding episode occurred and was succesfully treated. 54 of 60 treated nonmajor bleeding 
episodes were succesfully treated. It is unclear why only a minority of bleeding episodes were classified 
according to severity (major and nonmajor). Also, occurrence of only 1 major bleeding episode among 
315 treated bleeds appears rather unusual. The Applicant is asked for clarification. 
Efficacy in inhibitor-positive subjects 
Of the 24 subjects who were enrolled to Arm 2 and exposed to rVIII-SingleChain, 12 subjects tested 
positive for inhibitors (6 had a high-titer range peak inhibitor, and 6 had a low-titer range peak 
inhibitor value). 73 bleeding events occurred in 9 inhibitor-positive subjects while their inhibitor status 
was positive. 19 bleeding events were treated with rVIII-SingleChain in 6 of 9 inhibitor-positive 
subjects while their inhibitor status was positive and were rated for hemostatic efficacy.  
Of the 19 treated bleeding events: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Three were rated as “poor / no response” (closest inhibitor titer result before the bleeding 
event) (proximal titers: 2.55, 28.5, and 5.90 BU/mL). 
Three were rated as “moderate” (proximal titers: 1.35, 4.02, and 1.82 BU/mL). 
Three were rated as “good” (proximal titers: 1.78, 1.78, and 1.30 BU/mL). 
Ten were rated as “excellent” (proximal titers: 0.66, 1.06, 1.49, 0.92, 0.71, 0.68, 4.0, 15.5, 
14.5, and 7.80 BU/mL). 
Treatment success by inhibitor status was 93.6% (95% CI: 89.1 to 96.3) while subjects were inhibitor 
negative and 68.4% (95% CI: 35.5 to 89.5) while subjects were inhibitor positive. 
Primary Endpoint - Treatment Success for Major Bleeding Episodes 
There was 1 major bleeding episode (spontaneous bleeding event in right knee) treated with rVIII-
SingleChain, which had a hemostatic efficacy rating of “excellent”. For this bleeding, no other 
medication was taken aside from Afstyla and 1 infusion was required to achieve haemostasis. 
Primary Endpoint - Annualized Spontaneous Bleeding Rate 
For spontaneous bleeding episodes, median (range) AsBR was 1.15 (0.0 to 5.6) in the on-demand 
treatment regimen and 0.88 (0.0 to 19.7) in the prophylaxis treatment regimen. Mean (SD) AsBR was 
1.90 (2.25) and 4.04 (6.37), respectively.

There was no apparent clinically relevant difference in AsBRs while the subjects were inhibitor positive 
compared with while they were inhibitor negative. Of note, 20 of the 73 bleeding events while inhibitor 
positive were treated with bypassing agents alone and 34 bleeding events did not require treatment. In 
addition, there was no apparent clinically relevant difference in AsBRs between subjects with 
noninhibitory antidrug antibodies (ADAs) and subjects without ADA.

Secondary Endpoint - Treatment Success for Nonmajor Bleeding Episodes  
90.0% (54 of 60) of treated nonmajor bleeding episodes had a response rated as “excellent” or 
“good”; the treatment success rate was 92.0% and 88.6% for the on-demand and prophylaxis 
treatment regimens, respectively. 
Secondary Endpoint - Number of Single Chain Recombinant Coagulation Factor VIII Injections to 
Achieve Hemostasis 
315 of 385 (81.8%) bleeding episodes were treated with rVIII-SingleChain (312 alone with rVIII-
SingleChain and 3 in combination with bypassing agents) during the study. In 88.9% of all treated 
bleeding episodes, 1 or 2 injections of rVIII-SingleChain were sufficient to achieve hemostasis. 8.9% of 
treated bleeding episodes required ≥ 3 injections of rVIII-SingleChain to achieve hemostasis. Of note, 
20 of 385 (5.2%) bleeding events were treated with only bypassing agents. 
Secondary Endpoint - Annualized Bleeding Rate 
For all bleeds, the median (range) ABR was 3.76 (0.0 to 17.1) for the on-demand treatment regimen 
and 1.84 (0.0 to 23.6) for the prophylaxis treatment regimen. There was no clinically relevant 
difference in ABRs while the subjects were inhibitor positive compared with while they were inhibitor

negative. There was no clinically relevant difference in ABRs between subjects with ADAs and subjects 
without ADAs (see tables 11-8 and 11-9 above). 
Secondary Endpoint - Consumption of rVIII-SingleChain 
The mean total dose administered per subject per week in the on-demand treatment regimen (N=12)  
was 9.64 IU/kg. On-demand treated subjects received a mean total dose per infusion per bleed of 
35.0 IU/kg (median 32.1) and received a mean of 1.23 infusions per subject per months. 
The mean dose per prophylactically infusion was 51.56 IU/kg among all treatment regimen (median 
50.00, range 18.2-429.6). The mean prophylaxis dose administered per subject week (year) in 
different treatment regimens was as follows: 
•  32.60 IU/kg (1701.23 IU/kg per year) in the 1 time per week regimen (N=22). 
•  71.23 IU/kg (3716.48 IU/kg per year) in the 2 times per week treatment regimen (N=15).  
•  161.04 IU/kg (8402.83 IU/kg per year) in the 3 times per week treatment regimen (N=12). 
•  283.60 IU/kg (14798.09 IU/kg per year) in the other treatment regimen (N=5). 
For all prophylactic treatment regimen (N=23) mean consumption was 4671.54 IU/kg per year 
(median 4029.99, range 1088.4-10202.5). 
The mean total dose administered per subject per week (year) in different treatment regimens was as 
follows: 
•  45.42 IU/kg (2369.83 IU/kg per year) in the 1 time per week regimen (N=22). 
•  87.84 IU/kg (4583.45 IU/kg per year) in the 2 times per week treatment regimen (N=15).  
•  166.62 IU/kg (8694.24 IU/kg per year) in the 3 times per week treatment regimen (N=12). 
•  317.38 IU/kg (16560.25 IU/kg per year) in the other treatment regimen (N=5). 
Total mean consumption for all prophylactically treated subjects (N=23) was 5346.86 IU/kg per year 
(median 4784.00, range 1383.2-12520.8). 
Total mean dose per infusion per bleed for all prophylactically treated subjects (N=23) was 79.8 IU/kg 
(median 49.63).  
Secondary Endpoint - Treatment success for surgery, using the 4-point efficacy evaluation of surgical 
treatment scale 
There were 3 surgeries in the PUPs during the study, 2 circumcisions and 1 port placement surgery (all 
nonemergency).  
The 2 circumcision surgeries required 13 injections (15,693 IU, assigned dose 100 IU/kg) and 4 
injections (5631 IU, assigned dose 100 IU/kg) of rVIII-SingleChain. The port replacement surgery 
required 8 injections (7330 IU, assigned dose 49 IU/kg) of rVIII-SingleChain. The treatment success 
rate of rVIII-SingleChain for the 3 nonemergency surgeries was 100% (i.e. haemostatic efficacy was 
rated excellent for all surgeries). The volume of blood loss during the surgical substudy (mean 3.3 mL) 
was higher than the predicted average levels (0.5 mL), no blood transfusion was given for any of the 
surgeries. During the surgical substudy, hemoglobin levels were maintained close to baseline levels, 
with a slight increase during the postoperative period.

comment:  
Taken into account the body weight at date at screening, the WHO child growth standards, and the 
date of surgery, the surgery dosing appears reasonable. According to the study protocol, any subject 
required to have surgery needed to suspend regular rVIII-SingleChain treatment. Subjects were to be 
treated with rVIII-SingleChain before, during, and after surgery, under the supervision of and as 
prescribed by the treating physician according to factor maintenance levels und treatment duration 
recommended by the WFH 2012 treatment guidelines.  
It is unclear, how the surgery ratings of excellent haemostatic efficacy were achieved. According to the 
rating scale, estimated blood loss should be not more than 20% higher than the estimated predicted 
blood loss to achieve an excellent rating. Apparently, this criterion was not met according to Table 
14.2.6.1 of the final CSR [predicted mean (SD) average blood loss 0.5 (0.71) mL, predicted mean (SD) 
maximum blood loss 1.0 (1.41) mL, observed mean (SD) blood loss 3.3 (5.77) mL. 
ITI - exploratory endpoint: Consumption of rVIII-SingleChain for Inhibitor Treatment 
The mean (SD) total ITI dose administered per subject per week was 183.84 IU/kg (102.385). The 
mean (range) number of injections administered during inhibitor treatment period was 124.6 (16 to 
287), the mean (range) number of EDs equally was 124.2 (16 to 287) EDs. 
ITI - exploratory endpoint: Inhibitor Eradication 
Time to inhibitor eradication was defined as the time between start of the first ITI dose (ie, first dose 
adjusted to treat the inhibitor, as defined by the investigator) to the complete response (ie, a 
confirmed inhibitor titer < 0.6 BU/mL at 2 consecutive visits, analyzed at the central laboratory).  
11 subjects were treated for their inhibitor (ITI population was defined as all subjects who received at 
least 1 dose of rVIII-SingleChain for the ITI substudy). Of these, 9 subjects had low-titer inhibitors and 
2 had high-titer inhibitors at the time they began treatment for their inhibitor. In the end, 6 peak low-
titer inhibitor subjects and 5 peak high-titer inhibitor subjects were treated for their inhibitor.

Nine of 11 subjects (81.8%; 95% CI: 0.482, 0.977) achieved inhibitor eradication with rVIII-
SingleChain (3/5 subjects with peak high-titer inhibitor and 6/6 subjects with peak low-titer inhibitor, 2 
subjects with initial high-titer inhibitor did not achieve inhibitor eradication). The median (range) EDs 
to inhibitor eradication was 37.00 (16.0 to 194.0) for the 9 subjects who had low-titer inhibitors at the 
time they began treatment for their inhibitor. The median (range) time to inhibitor eradication was 
14.29 (7.7 to 64.4) weeks for these subjects.  
Of note, six of the 11 subjects received ITI treatment with rVIII-SingleChain in the ITI substudy. Of 
these, 5 subjects received low-dose (50 IU/kg 3 times weekly) and 1 subject received a high-dose 
(200 IU/kg daily) ITI regimen with rVIII-SingleChain (see also extent of exposure in the safety 
results). 
comment: 
The ITI population was defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of rVIII-SingleChain for the 
ITI substudy. 11 subjects were included in the ITI population but 6 subjects received ITI treatment 
(N=5 low-dose and N=1 high-dose regimen). Overall, 9 subjects, all with initial low-titer inbhibitor, 
received inhibitor eradication. There is uncertainty regarding treatment regimen and treatment 
success. 
Safety results 
Extent of Exposure 
The mean (SD) number of EDs for 24 enrolled and treated PUPs was 245.5 (161.56) EDs; the median 
(interquartile range) number of EDs was 230 (142, 323) EDs. A total of 21 subjects (87.5%) attained 
> 50 EDs. The mean (SD) dose administered per infusion was 53.3 (26.34) IU/kg. The mean number 
of EDs in inhibitor-positive was 109.3 EDs and inhibitor-negative subjects was 190.8 EDs. Of note, 
preventive and additional doses of rVIII-SingleChain were permitted during the study (overall 10 
subjects in the on-demand group received a mean of 5 additional doses).

comment:  
The Applicant concluded that the mean number of EDs in inhibitor-positive and inhibitor-negative 
subjects was comparable. Given an almost 2-fold difference, this statement requires further 
explanation. 
In the ITI Population, 11 subjects received treatment with rVIII-SingleChain; 6 of the 11 subjects were 
enrolled in the ITI substudy: 5 subjects received a low-dose (50 IU/kg 3 times weekly) regimen and 1 
subject received high-dose (200 IU/kg daily) ITI regimen. The mean (SD) number of EDs was 124.2 
(98.79) EDs and 7 subjects (63.6%) attained > 50 EDs during their inhibitor treatment period. 
Primary Endpoint: Inhibitor against FVIII 
The primary safety endpoint was incidence of high-titer inhibitor formation to FVIII (ie, inhibitor titer of 
> 5 Bethesda unit [BU]/mL) in PUPs with at least 50 EDs of rVIII-SingleChain. 
Twenty-four subjects were enrolled and exposed to rVIII-SingleChain during the study, and 12 
subjects (50.0%) tested positive for inhibitors. Of these, 6 subjects (25.0% of total, primary safety 
endpoint) had a peak inhibitor value in the high-titer range, and 6 subjects (25.0% of total) had a 
peak inhibitor value in the low-titer range. The overall median EDs for initial inhibitor development was 
10 EDs (range 4 to 23 EDs). Median EDs for initial inhibitor development in high titer subjects was 9.0 
EDs (range 4 to 23 EDs) and in low titer subjects was 10 EDs (range 5 to 23 EDs). Of the 12 inhibitor-
positive subjects, 1 subject was withdrawn from the study because of protocol requirement as a result 
of high inhibitor titer at diagnosis (8.50 BU/mL); following this the protocol was amended to allow 
subjects diagnosed with inhibitor to continue participation in the study and enroll into the ITI substudy. 
1 subject was withdrawn after entering the ITI substudy (physician’s decision), and 1 subject had 
inhibitor-positive status at study end. 
Secondary Endpoint: Noninhibitory Antidrug Antibodies (ADAs) 
Twelve subjects (50.0%) developed noninhibitory ADAs during the study. Eight of the 12 subjects who 
developed noninhibitory ADAs were positive for inhibitors; 6 subjects had high-titer and 2 subjects had 
low-titer. Two of these 12 subjects (8.3%) were confirmed to be positive for noninhibitory ADAs by the 
EOS (1 subject had high-titer inhibitor and the other subject was not positive for inhibitor). 
Secondary Endpoint: Antibodies to Chinese Hamster Ovary Host Cell Proteins 
None of the subjects developed antibodies against CHO host cell proteins 
Adverse events 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs): All subjects in the PUP Safety Population experienced at 
least 1 TEAE. A total of 320 TEAEs were reported (12 severe, 93 moderate, 208 mild). The highest 
frequency of TEAEs were in the System Organ Class: Infections and Infestations (91.7%), General 
Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions (66.7%), Investigations (50.0%, N=12/24 of which were 
N=12 Inhibiting antibodies positive and N=6 Anti-factor VIII antibody positive), Injury, Poisoning and 
Procedural Complications (37.5%), Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders (33.3%), 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (33.3%), Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (33.3%), Skin 
and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (29.2%), Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (25.0%), 
Vascular Disorders (12.5%). Of the TEAEs reported in ≥ 10% of subjects in the overall PUP Safety 
Population, the most commonly reported TEAEs were Pyrexia (44 TEAEs) in 15 subjects, Upper 
respiratory Tract Infection (18) in 7 subjects, Nasopharyngitis (15) in 9 subjects, and Inhibitor 
Development (14 TEAEs; Inhibiting Antibodies Positive [7], Anti-factor VIII Antibody Positive [6], and 
Factor VIII Inhibition [1]) in 13 subjects.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 21/39 
 
 
  
 
Related TEAEs: Twelve subjects (50%) had a total of 17 TEAEs related to rVIII-SingleChain, the 
majority of which were Inhibitors Development (14 TEAEs, 82.4%). The other were fatigue (n=1), 
pyrexia (n=1), and haemorrhage (n=1). One severe TE SAE of Inhibiting Antibodies Positive (high 
titer) led to study discontinuation, which was related to rVIII-SingleChain and had not resolved at the 
end of study. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI): Potential events of hypersensitivity reactions were 
identified. Ten subjects (41.7%) experienced 15 TEAEs that could be considered as symptoms or 
manifestations of Hypersensitivity reactions. These TEAEs were eczema (n=3 in 3 subjects), rash (n=3 
in 3 subjects), bronchospasm (n=4 in 2 subjects), and conjunctivitis allergic, dermatitis allergic, eye 
swelling, rash erythematous, rhinitis allergic (each occurring once in a single subject). Upon medical 
review, none of these TEAEs of special interest were confirmed as hypersensitivity reactions. 
Local tolerability: 21 subjects reported at least 1 self-assessment. No local reactions were reported for 
99.7% of subject-assessed rVIII-SingleChain injections. A small proportion of injections were reported 
as being associated with very slight to moderate local reactions, and there were no injections 
associated with severe local reactions. The investigator’s assessment of erythema identified no reaction 
in any of the assessed injections. 
No deaths were reported in this study. No anaphylactic reactions or thromboembolic events were 
reported. There were no notable findings relating to clinical laboratory or vital signs parameters. 
Of note, two subjects who experienced unrelated TEAEs of Coronavirus test positive recovered. 
Other endpoint: Incremental Recovery 
Incremental recovery (IR) was assessed as a PK (and safety) parameter in 6 PUPs who participated in 
the ITI substudy to monitor inhibitor development. Incremental recovery was assessed in the 6 PUPs in 
the ITI substudy. As expected for subjects with inhibitors, all subjects had at least 1 post-dose FVIII 
activity level that was below the limit of quantification or much lower than normal. Three subjects had 
low IR values that increased over time as the inhibitor was eradicated. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Afstyla is a recombinant single-chain Factor VIII (rVIII-SingleChain, INN: lonoctocog alfa) indicated for 
the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients of all age groups with haemophilia A as 
replacement therapy. The active substance is a B-domain truncated variant of human factor VIII 
defined by covalently bonded FVIII heavy and light chains within a single polypeptide structure. 
Marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union was granted on 04 January 2017 on the 
basis of two main studies. The first study was conducted in previously treated adult/adolescent 
subjects with severe haemophilia A, the second study involved paediatric PTPs below 12 years of age. 
In accordance with the EMA requirements for the postmarketing investigation and the clinical guideline 
on FVIII products in effect in 2011, a third study, coded CSL 627_3001, was conducted to evaluate 
routine prophylaxis and on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes in at least 200 PTPs who achieved 
at least 100 EDs and in PUPs who achieved at least 50 EDs. The study was titled “A Phase 3 Open-
Label, Multicenter, Extension Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Recombinant Coagulation 
Factor VIII (rVIII-SingleChain, CSL627) in Subjects with Severe Hemophilia A”. A summary of the final 
results from PTPs in this study (Arms 1 and 3, completed for PTPs in December 2018) was already 
submitted to EMA in January 2020 (eCTD sequence 68 / procedure reference 
EMEA/H/C/004075/MEA/002.1). The final report for PTPs dated 28 November 2019.

Now, the MAH submitted a final report from PUPs of this study (Arm 2), in accordance with Article 46 
of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. The main goal of this study arm was to acquire efficacy and safety 
data in at least 50 PUPs treated at least for 50 EDs with rVIII-SingleChain. The number of PUPs was 
reduced to at least 24 per Protocol Amendment 4.  and the study was completed in January 2021 (last 
subject visit, CSR dated June 2021). It is noted that no change to product information is planned. 
Arm 2 of Study 3001 included 24 PUPs with a mean age of 1.4 years (range 0-5), 21 subjects (87.5%) 
achieved > 50 EDs. 11/12 initially on-demand treated subjects switched to prophylaxis regimen giving 
a total of N=23 subjects in the prophylaxis group. 19 subjects completed the study, 5 discontinued. Of 
note, not all pre-planned secondary or explorative analyses have been appropriately described in the 
final report. It should be noted that due to the early stop of enrolment, the significance of some 
endpoints is compromised anyway. There is no serious concern for study conduct, ten major protocol 
deviations were found (3x dosing, 2x visit/procedural, 2x laboratory noncompliance, 1x visit schedule, 
2x other), none led to study discontinuation. 
A primary efficacy endpoint was treatment success for major bleeding episodes. A total of 315 bleeding 
episodes were treated with rVIII-SingleChain (312 were treated with rVIII-SingleChain alone, 3 were 
additionally treated with bypassing agent). One bleeding episode was a major bleeding, i.e. a 
spontaneous bleeding in right knee, and this was successfully treated (“excellent” rating on a 4-point 
efficacy scale, no other medication was taken aside from Afstyla and 1 infusion was required to achieve 
haemostasis). 54 of 60 (90.0%) nonmajor classified bleeding episodes have been successfully treated. 
In total, 290 of 315 (92.1%) bleeding episodes had a response rated as “excellent” or “good”. In 
88.9% of all treated bleeding episodes 1-2 injections of Afstyla were sufficient to achieve hemostasis, 
8.9% of treated bleeding episodes required ≥ 3 injections to achieve hemostasis. In addition, 
haemostatic efficacy was evaluated by inhibitor status and treatment success was 93.6% in the 
absence and 68.4% in the presence of inhibitory antibodies. Annualized bleeding rates in the PUPs 
were further study objectives. The median ABR for the on-demand treatment regimen was 3.76 (range 
0.0-17.1, mean: 5.12) for all bleeds (spontaneous bleeds median ABR 1.15, range 0.0-5.6, mean ABR 
1.9). The median ABR for the prophylaxis treatment regimen was 1.84 (range 0.0-23.6, mean 5.94) 
for all bleeds (spontaneous bleeds median ABR 0.88, range 0.0-19.7, mean ABR 4.04).  
Treatment of inhibitor-positive subjects was an exploratory objective, and therefore does not 
necessarily has further implications for the product labelling. However, to briefly brief summarize this 
effort, consumption data during ITI are provided and inhibitor eradication is described. 9/11 subjects 
(81.8%) who were treated for their inhibitors achieved inhibtor eradication which was achieved at a 
median of 37 EDs (range 16-194) and median of 14 weeks (range 7.7-64.4). Of note, only 6/11 
subjects received a low-dose (50 IU/kg 3 times weekly, N=5) or high-dose (200 IU/kg daily, N=1) ITI 
regimen. Clarification is requested regarding the correlation of treatment regimen and treatment 
succes, and whether ITI could be reflected in the product information.  
Overall, favourable efficacy was demonstrated in the on-demand and prophylactic treatment of PUPs 
and the data are line with the benefits shown in other Afstyla studies. On-demand treatment of 
bleeding episodes was efficacious, the vast majority of treated bleedings was sufficiently controlled by 
1 or 2 injections of Afstyla. No concerns arise from consumption data, total consumption for all 
prophylactically treated subjects was 5346 IU/kg per year (median 4784, range 1383-12520) which is 
a common range for Haemophilia A subjects, including PUPs. No firm conclusion can be drawn from the 
ABR data due to the small sample size, yet the reported rates do not give cause for concern and 
commonly reflect typical ranges for the PUPs (Keipert, Müller-Olling et al. 2020; Yaish et al. 2020). 
Treatment success during surgery was evaluated in 3 cases (2x circumcision, 1x port placement). 
Further clarifications are requested regarding the surgery efficacy ratings, yet despite its small size 
data rather support a favourable profile.

The primary safety objective was to evaluate the development of FVIII inhibitory antibodies. In total, 
12/24 (50%) PUPs were positive for inhibitors. 6 Subjects each (25% of total) had inhibitor values in 
the high-titer and in the low-titer range, respectively. Initial all-titer inhibitor development was 
observed at a median of 10 EDs (range 4-23). For high-titer and low-titer development, initial 
occurrence was observed at median of 9 and 10 EDs, respectively. This is considered a typical time 
course for inhibitor development. In fact, most inhibitors develop within the first 50 EDs with 50% of 
inhibitor already presenting within the first 15 EDs (van den Berg et al. 2018; Keipert et al. 2018). Of 
note, the mean number of EDs for all PUPs was 245.5 (median 230, min-max range 5-639). 21 
subjects (87.5%) achieved at least 50 EDs, 2 subjects achieved <10 EDs and 1 subject >10 EDs. 
Further clarification is requested for inhibitor status in the 3 subjects not having achieved 50 EDs. 
In line with the EMA FVIII referral, it is acknowledged that the lack of direct comparative data is 
stressing the significance of reported inhibitor incidence rates and inhibitor frequency for PUPs is 
reported as ‘very common’ in the current SmPC of Afstyla. With further reference made to EMA 
Assessment report of the FVIII Referral (EMA/763977/2017), for most recombinant FVIII products all-
titer inhibitor frequencies range from 15 to 38% and high-titer inhibitors are in the range of 9-22.6%. 
A recent meta-analysis likewise showed that all-titer inhibitor rates are in the range of 26-40% for 
recombinant FVIII products, with an estimated frequency of 22% (95%CI: 18-27%) for high-titer 
inhibitors (Keipert et al. 2021). Therefore, it is considered that the rates estimated in this study for 
both all-titer and high-titer inhibtors are in the upper range or above the frequencies already 
described. The clinical relevance of this finding remains uncertain. 
Other safety endpoints referred to non-inhibitory ADAs and adverse events including the potential for 
hypersensitivity reaction. 12 subjects had noninhibitory ADAs with strong intra-subject overlap of also 
having inhibitory antibodies. Events potentially related to hypersensitivity reactions were identified, i.e. 
10 subjects experienced 15 such TEAEs including eczema, rash, and bronchospasm. These events were 
not confirmed as related after medical review; however, the applicant is requested to provide further 
details in this regard. No other important or new safety issues were identified. No deaths, no 
anaphylactic reactions, no thromboembolic events were reported. 
For regulatory consideration, the applicant has stated that the study objective was in accordance with 
the EMA guideline in effect at date of study initiation. Of note, the study period for PUPs was August 
2015 (first subject visit) until January 2021 (last subject visit). The guideline on the clinical 
investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor VIII products currently into effect, i.e. 
since 01 February 2019 (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 rev. 2), removed the obligation to perform 
clinical trials in PUPs and instead requests post-authorisation studies based on a set of core data 
elements to be collected in haemophilia registries. It is further stated that the applicant has reached an 
agreement with the EMA Paediatric Committee through a request for modification of the pediatric 
investigational plan (PIP) to stop enrolling subjects into Study CSL627_3001. Accordingly, the ITI 
substudy had been extended to sufficiently follow up all inhibitor-positive PUPs.  
Overall, post-authorisation PUP data were submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the paediatric 
regulation and support the favourable benefit-risk balance of Afstyla. Given the change of the 
regulatory landscape from conducting clinical trials in PUPs to collecting such data within haemophilia 
registries, the stop of this study and final report of PUP data is considered acceptable. The 
disadvantage, however, is that statistical significance of the submitted data is compromised. Additional 
minor clarifications are requested to address identified issues in the efficacy and safety assessments. 
Currently, it remains unclear whether ITI should be reflected in the product information. Clarification is 
requested in this regard as no change to the SmPC has been proposed.

3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall, post-authorisation PUP data, submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the paediatric 
regulation, support the favourable benefit-risk balance of Afstyla. Minor clarifications are requested on 
several aspects of the final analysis which need to be sufficiently addressed by the Applicant. However, 
it is acknowledged that regulatory changes during the study conduct, and subsequently a small 
number of PUPs included, compromise the significance of the final study results. 
 Not fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide description of the additional clarifications 
requested as part of this procedure. (see section “Additional clarification requested”)

4.  Additional clarification requested / RSI 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1)  Line listing of all the non-clinical and clinical studies included in the development program should 
be provided (refer to Annex). 
2)  Subjects eligible for study arm 2 were not allowed to have had prior exposure to any FVIII product, 
with the exception of short-term use of blood products. The Applicant should comment on any 
potential issues regarding prior use of blood products, in particular whether this might have 
resulted in any bias on the estimation of inhibitor development. 
3)  A total of 315 bleeding events have been treated with Afstyla with a treatment succes rate of 92% 
i.e. 290 of 315 bleeding episodes had a response rated as “excellent” or “good”. One major 
bleeding episode occurred and was succesfully treated. 54 of 60 treated nonmajor bleeding 
episodes were succesfully treated. It is unclear why only a minority of bleeding episodes were 
classified as major or nonmajor. Also, frequency of only 1 major bleeding episode among 315 
treated bleeds appears rather low. The Applicant is asked for clarification. 
4)  The mean dose per prophylactically infusion was 51.56 IU/kg among all treatment regimen 
(median 50.00, range 18.2-429.6). The Applicant is requested to comment on the upper range 
maximum of dosing up to 429 IU/kg for prophylactic infusion. 
5)  Subject exposure for inhibitor analysis: Of the 24 subjects included in the analysis, 2 subjects 
achieved <10 EDs and 1 subject >10 EDs. The Applicant should clarify whether these 3 subjects 
had already developed FVIII inhibitory antibodies. In case these did not, an additional inhibitor 
frequency analysis is requested (all-titer frequency, high-titer frequency, low-titer frequency) by 
only including subjects with at least 50 EDs. 
6)  It is unclear, how the surgery ratings of excellent haemostatic efficacy were achieved. According to 
the rating scale, estimated blood loss should be not more than 20% higher than the estimated 
predicted blood loss to achieve an excellent rating. Apparently, this criterion was not met according 
to Table 14.2.6.1 of the final CSR [predicted mean (SD) average blood loss 0.5 (0.71) mL, 
predicted mean (SD) maximum blood loss 1.0 (1.41) mL, observed mean (SD) blood loss 3.3 
(5.77) mL. Further clarification is requested. 
7)  ITI substudy: 11 subjects were included in the ITI population but only 6 subjects received ITI 
treatment (N=5 low-dose and N=1 high-dose regimen). Overall, 9 subjects, all with initial low-titer 
inbhibitor, received inhibitor eradication. There is uncertainty regarding treatment regimen and 
treatment success. Further explanation is requested in particular on the subjects not receiving ITI 
treatment. The Applicant is also asked, whether ITI data will be reflected in the SmPC according to 
the EMA Reflection paper on Immune Tolerance Induction in haemophilia A patients with inhibitors 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/153137/2011). 
8)  Events potentially related to hypersensitivity reactions were identified, i.e. 10 subjects experienced 
15 such TEAEs including eczema, rash, and bronchospasm. These events were not confirmed after 
medical review. The Applicant is requested to provide further details in this regard. 
9)  Aside from the 14 related TEAEs of inhibitor development, fatigue (n=1), pyrexia (n=1), and 
haemorrhage (n=1) have been reported. Pyrexia is already included in the tabulated list of adverse 
reactions of the Afstyla SmPC, however, fatigue and haemorrhage are not. Further clarification is 
requested.

10) Three subjects discontinued the study as per physician’s decision. The Applicant is asked to provide 
additional details for the underlying reason(s). 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

5.  MAH’s responses and assessment of the responses to the 
additional clarifications requested/RSI 
Question 1 
Line listing of all the non-clinical and clinical studies included in the development program should be 
provided (refer to Annex). 
MAH’s responses 
Please refer to Annex. Line listing of all the studies included in the development program 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
The requested information has been provided.  
Point clarified 
Question 2 
Subjects eligible for study arm 2 were not allowed to have had prior exposure to any FVIII product, 
with the exception of short-term use of blood products. The Applicant should comment on any 
potential issues regarding prior use of blood products, in particular whether this might have resulted in 
any bias on the estimation of inhibitor development. 
MAH’s responses 
CSL has checked the medications taken prior to the first dose with Afstyla. These data show that none 
of the subjects enrolled in the study have had prior exposure to any FVIII-containing blood products. 
Any possible bias on the development of an inhibitor can be excluded. Details regarding subjects who 
took any prior medications before the first Afstyla dose are provided in the table below. 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
Data provided for the subjects’ medications prior the first dose of Afstyla do not raise concerns 
regarding potential bias on the estimation of FVIII inhibitor development.  
Point clarified. 
Question 3 
A total of 315 bleeding events have been treated with Afstyla with a treatment succes rate of 92% i.e. 
290 of 315 bleeding episodes had a response rated as “excellent” or “good”. One major bleeding 
episode occurred and was succesfully treated. 54 of 60 treated nonmajor bleeding episodes were 
succesfully treated. It is unclear why only a minority of bleeding episodes were classified as major or 
nonmajor. Also, frequency of only 1 major bleeding episode among 315 treated bleeds appears rather 
low. The Applicant is asked for clarification. 
MAH’s responses 
The reason that only a minority of the bleeding episodes were classified as major or nonmajor by the 
investigators was because the classification was done as per the protocol. The protocol describes the 
classification as follow (CSR Section 9.5.1.2): Major bleeding episodes are defined as bleeding episodes 
for which a subject was required to seek treatment at the hemophilia center from the treating 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 29/39 
 
 
  
 
 
 
physician for any episode that threatened the subject’s life or a loss of limb. Examples of major 
bleeding episodes included intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and severe bleeding. All 
other bleeding episodes were classified as nonmajor unless the investigator assessment noted 
otherwise. 
Only 1 bleeding episode was considered as a major bleeding episode according to this definition and 
this subject was treated successfully by the investigator at the site. For treatment of minor bleeding 
episodes at home, the subjects or their caregivers recorded the information in the eDiary and 
discussed those bleeds at their next doctor appointment. In case of these minor bleeding episodes, the 
eDiary data were captured in the electronic study database without interference by the investigator. 
This explains why not all bleeding episodes were classified by the investigator in the electronic case 
report form (eCRF). 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
It is noted that a large number of home-treated minor bleeding episodes has not been classified by a 
study investigator.  
Point not further pursued. 
Question 4 
The mean dose per prophylactically infusion was 51.56 IU/kg among all treatment regimen (median 
50.00, range 18.2-429.6). The Applicant is requested to comment on the upper range maximum of 
dosing up to 429 IU/kg for prophylactic infusion. 
MAH’s responses 
The 429 IU/kg dose taken for routine prophylaxis may have resulted from a data entry error in the 
total dose by the caregiver, but it was not verified by CSL because it was an eDiary collected data. 
Please see below Background information for further details. 
Background 
In addition to the bleeding information, the actual Afstyla total dose given and specific reason for 
treatment were collected using eDiary. The actual dose was entered in a device by the caregiver, and 
the entered information are later linked to the electronic study database. All bleeding and dosing 
information entered in the eDiary were medically reviewed on a regular basis during the course of the 
study. Although most fields in the eDiary can be automatically queried based their fixed number of 
responses provided by the pull-down menus, other fields, like the total dose, were entered as a free 
text. No range check could be applied automatically to total dose because it is based on the reason for 
treatment. The Investigator could either administer an assigned dose for routine prophylaxis or a high 
bolus dose to treat a bleeding event. The challenge arises from verifying the total dose entered when 
there is no source documentation. Furthermore, if we were able to contact the caregiver, his/her 
anecdotal response could be inaccurate due to the amount of time since the total dose was entered. 
Therefore, the total dose and other free text fields entered in the eDiary remained unverified in our 
study database. 
Although CSL has initially considered to exclude the extreme values entered for total doses as possible 
data entry errors in the descriptive summary statistics, this was not done because it could lead to 
selection bias due to not fully understanding the nature and extent of inaccuracies in total doses. 
Therefore, CSL analyzed total doses as entered by the caregiver, and based any conclusions related to 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 30/39 
 
 
  
 
 
the total dose (e.g. consumption) on the median, which is less affected by extreme values, compared 
to the mean. 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
It is noted that the maximum dosing of 429 IU/kg for prophylactic infusion is likely to be an data entry 
error. Mean, median, and Q3 consumptions data generally do not give cause for concern.  
Point clarified. 
Question 5 
Subject exposure for inhibitor analysis: Of the 24 subjects included in the analysis, 2 subjects achieved 
<10 EDs and 1 subject >10 EDs. The Applicant should clarify whether these 3 subjects had already 
developed FVIII inhibitory antibodies. In case these did not, an additional inhibitor frequency analysis 
is requested (all-titer frequency, high-titer frequency, low-titer frequency) by only including subjects 
with at least 50 EDs. 
MAH’s responses 
1 subject < 10 EDs was inhibitor positive, the remaining two subjects (one < 10 EDs and one >10 
EDs) were inhibitor negative.  
In subjects with at least 50 EDs, 11 developed an inhibitor (see Table 14.1.8.3.1.1). 
In subjects with at least 50 EDs, 5 subjects developed a high titer inhibitor (see Table 14.1.8.3.1.2) 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 31/39 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In subjects with at least 50 EDs, 6 subjects developed a low titer inhibitor (see Table 14.1.8.3.1.3). 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
Information provided by the Applicant regarding subjects’ exposure for inhibitor analysis do not give 
cause for concern.  
Point clarified.

Question 6 
It is unclear, how the surgery ratings of excellent haemostatic efficacy were achieved. According to the 
rating scale, estimated blood loss should be not more than 20% higher than the estimated predicted 
blood loss to achieve an excellent rating. Apparently, this criterion was not met according to Table 
14.2.6.1 of the final CSR [predicted mean (SD) average blood loss 0.5 (0.71) mL, predicted mean (SD) 
maximum blood loss 1.0 (1.41) mL, observed mean (SD) blood loss 3.3 (5.77) mL. Further clarification 
is requested. 
MAH’s responses 
CSL acknowledges that the actual mean blood loss of surgeries was higher than 20% than the 
predicted blood loss (Table 14.2.6.1).  
According to this definition it should not have been rated as excellent. However, in 2 of the 3 surgeries, 
both the predicted and actual blood loss was 0mL and could be rated as excellent (Listing 16.2.9.3.3).  
The actual blood loss during the port placement in the third patient exceeded the predicted blood loss 
although the total loss was still a very small volume (10 mL, Listing 16.2.9.3.1 and 16.2.9.3.3). 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
The Applicant admits an erroneous assessment and the validity of these surgical efficacy data is thus in 
doubt. However, due to the very small number of cases, the data are not meaningful anyway.  
Issue not further pursued. 
Question 7 
ITI substudy: 11 subjects were included in the ITI population but only 6 subjects received ITI 
treatment (N=5 low-dose and N=1 high-dose regimen). Overall, 9 subjects, all with initial low-titer 
inbhibitor, received inhibitor eradication. There is uncertainty regarding treatment regimen and 
treatment success. Further explanation is requested in particular on the subjects not receiving ITI 
treatment. The Applicant is also asked, whether ITI data will be reflected in the SmPC according to the 
EMA Reflection paper on Immune Tolerance Induction in haemophilia A patients with inhibitors 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/153137/2011).

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 33/39 
 
 
  
 
 
 
MAH’s responses 
Given the flexibility in the dosing options in the main study investigators had the option to increase the 
dose of rVIII-SingleChain to attempt to treat the inhibitor and achieve eradication without formally 
enrolling the patient in the ITI study. 
The ITI sub study allowed the investigator to assign either a low dose (50 IU/kg, 3x weekly), 
intermediate dose (100 IU/kg daily), and high (200 IU/kg daily) regimen. The main study allowed the 
investigator to increase the subject’s regimen to treat the inhibitor. CSL decided to include all the 
subjects who had any dose adjustment as ITI population in order to evaluate the treatment response. 
Of the 11 subjects included in the ITI population, 5 were enrolled into the ITI sub-study on the low 
dose regimen (50IU/kg, 3 times a week) and 1 received a high dose regimen (200 IU/kg daily). The 
remaining 5 subjects remained in the main study; 4 received intensified prophylaxis regimens (3 
received low dose of ITI (50 IU/kg 3x weekly, 58 IU/kg 3x weekly, and 50 IU/kg 2x weekly and 1 42 
IU/kg 3x weekly) to treat the inhibitor and 1 subject continued on their current regimen without 
modification (30 IU/kg once weekly). The 5 subjects who remained in the main study had all achieved 
inhibitor eradication. 
Regarding the addition of the ITI information, CSL is committed to update the EU-SmPC in upcoming 
variation procedures (planned for December 2021) to include ITI information according to the EMA 
reflection paper on Immune Tolerance Indication in Haemophilia A patients with inhibitors 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/153137/2011). CSL also proposes to update the introductory paragraph in Section 
5.1 to include demographic information from study CSL627_3001. 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
Provided information sufficiently clarify treatment regimens for the 11 subjects included in the ITI 
population. A variation is planned to also include ITI related information in the EU SmPC.  
Point clarified. 
Question 8 
Events potentially related to hypersensitivity reactions were identified, i.e. 10 subjects experienced 15 
such TEAEs including eczema, rash, and bronchospasm. These events were not confirmed after medical 
review. The Applicant is requested to provide further details in this regard. 
MAH’s responses 
CSL acknowledges the assessor’s request to provide further clarification regarding the 15 TEAEs that 
could be considered as symptoms or manifestations of hypersensitivity reactions. 
A total of 15 TEAEs were identified using the SMQ* Hypersensitivity (narrow). Two subjects (8.3%) 
experienced a total of 4 events of Bronchospasm (1 subject had 3 events of Bronchospasm, 1 subject 
had 1 event), 3 subjects (12.5%) experienced 1 event each of Eczema and 3 subjects (12.5%) 
experienced 1 event each of Rash. The remaining 5 events were Conjunctivitis allergic Dermatitis 
allergic, Eye swelling, Rash erythematous and Rhinitis allergic; all reported in 1 subject each. All the 
events were non-serious and of either mild or moderate severity. rVIII-SingleChain dose was not 
changed following 12 of the events, while the action taken with the study treatment was reported as 
not applicable for the remaining 3 events. For the latter 3 events, concomitant medication was 
prescribed to treat them. The outcome was reported as recovered for all but one event (Rash). All the 
events were assessed as not related to rVIII-SingleChain by the investigator. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 34/39 
 
 
  
 
 
CSL would like to clarify that these were confirmed TEAEs. However, upon medical review, none of 
these TEAEs were confirmed as hypersensitivity reactions related to rVIII-SingleChain. 
*SMQ: Standardised MedDRA Query 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
The Applicant’s comments are acknowledged, the concerned TEAEs were assessed as not related by 
the study investigator. The potential for hypersensitivity reactions is flagged within the SmPC (Section 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use, Section 4.8 Undesirable effects - Summary of the safety 
profile) and these occur at common frequency (Section 4.8 Undesirable effects - Tabulated list of 
adverse reactions).  
Point clarified. 
Question 9 
Aside from the 14 related TEAEs of inhibitor development, fatigue (n=1), pyrexia (n=1), and 
haemorrhage (n=1) have been reported. Pyrexia is already included in the tabulated list of adverse 
reactions of the Afstyla SmPC, however, fatigue and haemorrhage are not. Further clarification is 
requested. 
MAH’s responses 
CSL acknowledges the assessor’s request and would like to provide further clarification. 
One subject experienced intermittent fatigue of mild severity assessed as nonserious and related to 
rVIII-SingleChain by the investigator. The dose of rVIII-SingleChain was not changed and no other 
action was taken. The outcome was reported as not recovered. A month prior to this event, the subject 
had experienced malaise and within the following month, he also experienced Pyrexia and Inhibitor 
development. Approximately 4 months later, the subject experienced Iron deficiency anaemia. Of note, 
the underlying haemophilia, development of FVIII inhibitors, and the difficulty in diagnosing fatigue in 
this 1-year-old subject, were considered as confounders. Furthermore, fatigue could be an early 
symptom of Iron deficiency anaemia that was later diagnosed. 
Throughout the clinical development program of rVIII-SingleChain, 1 additional event of Fatigue has 
been reported in a PTP. That was a non-serious event of mild severity that was assessed as not related 
to rVIII-SingleChain by the investigator. 
After medical review of this single event of Fatigue with plausible other root cause, an update of the 
SmPC was not deemed necessary. 
One subject experienced severe haemorrhage which was assessed as serious and related to 
rVIII
SingleChain by the investigator. Of note, the subject was tested positive for high titer FVIII 
inhibitors (5.90 BU/ml) one week before the occurrence of haemorrhage. rVIIISingleChain dose was 
‑
increased, rFVII (NovoSeven) was administered and the subject recovered from the event. CSL 
assessed this event as related to rVIII-SingleChain. The presence of FVIII inhibitors was likely the main 
cause of haemorrhage. Haemorrhage itself is a clinical sign that allows for early suspicion and testing 
for FVIII inhibitors, as described in section 4.4 of the EU-SmPC: 
Inhibitors 
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 35/39 
 
 
  
 
 
ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of 
the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 exposure 
days but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon. 
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
posing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. 
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. 
Therefore, after medical review of this single case of Haemorrhage in the context of FVIII inhibitors, an 
update of the Afstyla SmPC was not deemed necessary. 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
The Applicant’s explanations are acknowledged.  
Point not further pursued. 
Question 10 
Three subjects discontinued the study as per physician’s decision. The Applicant is asked to provide 
additional details for the underlying reason(s). 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
Additional information provided for subjects’ discontinuation per physician’s decision do not raise 
concerns.  
Point clarified.

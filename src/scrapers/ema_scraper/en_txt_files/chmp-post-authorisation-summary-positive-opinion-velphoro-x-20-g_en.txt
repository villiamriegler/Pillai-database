Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Velphoro 
mixture of polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide, sucrose and starches 
On 17 September 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Velphoro. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Vifor Fresenius Medical Care 
Renal Pharma France. 
The CHMP adopted a new pharmaceutical form and strength – powder for oral suspension 125 mg – 
together with a new indication in paediatric patients. 
For information, the full indications for Velphoro will be as follows:2 
Velphoro is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in adult chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) patients on haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). 
Velphoro is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in paediatric patients 
2 years of age and older with CKD stages 4-5 (defined by a glomerular filtration rate 
<30 mL/min/1.73 m²) or with CKD on dialysis. 
Velphoro should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could 
include calcium supplement, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 or one of its analogues, or calcimimetics 
to control the development of renal bone disease. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

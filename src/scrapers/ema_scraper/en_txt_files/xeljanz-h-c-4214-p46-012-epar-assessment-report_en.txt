1.  Introduction 
On  27/01/2020,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  tofacitinib  for  treatment  of 
polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
This submission is in fulfilment of the Article 46 requirement. Study A3921104 is a deferred study in the 
JIA  PIP  (Study  6)  with  a  completion  date  by  February  2020.  Study  A3921104  was  a  randomized 
withdrawal,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability  of 
tofacitinib  for  treatment  of  polyarticular  course  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (JIA)  in  children  and 
adolescent subjects. 
A consequential Type II variation to update the SmPC with the relevant results is planned for submission 
in June 2020.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Two formulations of tofacitinib have been used in study A3921104 to enable weight-based dosing and 
achieve comparable tofacitinib area under the curve (AUC) for all patients: 
• 
• 
Tofacitinib citrate IR film-coated 5 mg tablet 
Tofacitinib citrate 1 mg/mL oral solution

Study design 
All  eligible  subjects  enrolled  in  the  study  initially  received  open-label  tofacitinib  for  18  weeks  (run-in 
phase). At the end of the 18-week run-in phase, only subjects who achieved at least a JIA American 
College  of  Rheumatology  (ACR)  30  response  were  randomized  to the  26-week  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled  phase.  Subjects  who  did  not  achieve  a  JIA  ACR  30  response  at  this  time  point  were 
discontinued from the study. Subjects who experienced a single episode of disease flare (according to 
Pediatric  Rheumatology  Clinical  Study  Group/Pediatric  Rheumatology  International  Trials  Organization 
[PRCSG/PRINTO] Disease Flare criteria) at any time during the study (including the open-label run-in 
and double-blind phase) were also discontinued from the study. 
Subjects who were eligible for the 26-week double-blind phase were randomized (1:1 ratio) to either 
active tofacitinib or placebo.  
Study population /Sample size 
A total of 286 subjects enrolled in the study, 185 subjects completed the open-label run-in phase, with 
173 subjects being randomized into the double-blind phase (88 subjects to tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 85 
subjects to placebo). 
There  were  12  subjects  that  were  withdrawn  upon  completion  of  the  initial  treatment  phase  because 
they did not meet the criteria to be randomized into the double-blind phase (insufficient clinical response 
for 11 subjects and protocol deviation for 1 subject). Of these subjects, 10 were rolled over into Study 
A3921145  and  2  discontinued  (1  subject  was  not  eligible  for  Study  A3921145  and  1  subject  refused 
participation). 
A total of 99 subjects completed the double-blind phase (61 in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and 
38 in the placebo group). Of those subjects, 97 were rolled over into the A3921145 study and 2 were 
discontinued.  Since  flares  led  to  discontinuation  during  the  double-blind  phase,  insufficient  clinical 
response was the most common discontinuation reason for double-blind discontinuation in both arms, 
with a higher percentage in the placebo group.

Treatments 
Tofacitinib was provided as oral tablets (tofacitinib citrate 5 mg) and as an oral solution (CP-690,550-10 
[tofacitinib  citrate]  1  mg/mL)  by  the  Sponsor.  Open-label  bottles  of  tofacitinib  tablets  and  tofacitinib 
citrate oral solution were provided for the run-in phase of the study. Blinded-label bottles of tofacitinib 
tablets, tofacitinib citrate oral solution, and matching placebo, for oral administration, were provided for 
the double-blind phase of the study.  
Randomization: For subjects with PJIA, randomization was stratified by JIA category and baseline 
CRP. For subjects with PsA and ERA, randomization was stratified by JIA category. 
Dose The dose of tofacitinib in adolescents with body weight ≥40 kg was set to 5 mg BID. Oral solution 
(1 mg/mL) was used for subjects weighing <40 kg. The tofacitinib doses for the younger JIA subjects 
were selected to match the predicted steady state concentrations in JIA subjects with body weight ≥40 
kg after administration of a 5 mg BID dose.

responses, LOCF was used to impute the missing component(s) to derive these endpoints at the visits 
prior to study treatment discontinuation if any component was missing. The LOCF method was also used 
to impute the binary status of flare, JIA ACR 30, 50, 70, 90, 100 responses, JADAS minimum disease 
activity, JADAS inactive disease, and JIA ACR inactive disease at intermediate visits with missing values, 
preceding  study  treatment  discontinuation.  Flare,  JIA  ACR  30,  50,  70,  90,  100  responses,  and  other 
binary endpoints (JADAS minimum disease activity and inactive disease, JIA ACR inactive disease) were 
set  to  flare/non-responder/active  disease,  respectively,  for  observed  assessments  on  or  after  the 
treatment  discontinuation.  Visits  without  observed  assessments  after  study  treatment  discontinuation 
were not imputed. 
Analysis of the primary endpoint. Tofacitinib was to be considered superior to placebo in reducing 
flares if testing the difference between the proportion of subjects with flares by Week 44/end of study 
(Week 26 of the double-blind phase) would result in a two-sided p-value <0.05. The difference between 
flare  rates  in  the  double-blind  phase  by  Week  44  of  the  study  for  subjects  with  polyarticular  course 
(polyarthritis RF+/RF-, E Oligo, and sJIA with active arthritis but without active systemic features) JIA 
was  tested  using  the  normal  approximation  approach  for  binomial  populations.  Subjects  who 
discontinued from the study treatment for any reason were considered as having a disease flare, except 
subjects  who  discontinued  after  maintaining  JIA  ACR  inactive  disease  for  at  least  24  weeks.  These 
discontinuations 
were 
considered 
as 
non-disease 
flare. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were carried out in support of the primary analysis of flare 
as follows: 
• Using a general linear model with binary outcome (flare/no flare) as response, JIA 
category and open-label baseline CRP category as factors, 
• Using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel approach with stratification factors of JIA category 
and open-label run-in baseline CRP category, 
• Analysis where all discontinuations, including those of subjects in clinical remission (at 
least 24 weeks of inactive disease), were treated as flares, 
• Per protocol analysis 
Tipping point analyses using 2 model-based multiple imputation approaches (Weibull regression and 
binomial distribution) to assess the impact of drop-outs (for reasons other than flare) on the primary 
results. 
All secondary endpoints that were collected in the double-blind withdrawal phase were analyzed by 
treatment group. For the binary endpoints, the normal approximation approach for the binary 
populations, as used for the primary analysis, was performed. For the continuous secondary endpoints, 
a mixed effect model was applied. Time to event analyses used Kaplan-Meier methodology and the 
logrank test. 
Tipping point analyses were conducted for the type I error controlled secondary endpoints using 
model-based multiple imputation—binomial method for ACR 50, 30, 70 responses at Week 44 of the 
study and missing not at random (MNAR) multiple imputation for the change from baseline in the 
CHAQ disability index at Week 44 of the study. 
For subjects with ERA and subjects with PsA, efficacy endpoints were assessed separately using 
summary and descriptive statistics by treatment group at each time point in the double-blind phase. 
The taste acceptability assessment questionnaire was included in the CRF, and summary statistics 
were provided for each category of the taste acceptability by treatment and by time point.

Sample size Approximately 170 subjects (in the polyarticular course cohort) were to be enrolled in 
the open-label active treatment run-in phase to provide a power of approximately 90% or above to 
detect a difference in the rate of disease flares between tofacitinib versus placebo in the double-blind 
phase, assuming a 54% to 65% response rate of ACR Pedi 30 from the run-in active treatment phase, 
a 2-sided 5% Type I error, and a true difference of at least 31% in flare rates between tofacitinib and 
placebo, with a placebo flare rate of 57%. Sample sizes for the PJIA categories were determined from 
a combination of prevalence data and precedents in the literature. 
Biopharmaceutics 
Two formulations of tofacitinib have been used in study A3921104 to enable weight-based dosing and 
achieve comparable tofacitinib area under the curve (AUC) for all patients: 
• 
• 
Tofacitinib citrate IR film-coated 5 mg tablet 
Tofacitinib citrate 1 mg/mL oral solution 
The 5 mg tablet formulation has the same qualitative and quantitative composition as the commercial 5 
mg  tablet  formulation  and  differed  only  with  respect  to  debossing.  Details  of  tofacitinib  5  mg  tablet 
biopharmaceutics  can  be  found  in  the  Summary  of  Biopharmaceutic  Studies  (SBP)  in  the  regulatory 
submission for RA patients. The clinical oral solution formulation is bridged to the tablet formulation used 
in the pJIA program using a relative bioavailability study in healthy adults (A3921354). 
The composition of the oral solution and the tablet is listed in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. The 
resulting  tofacitinib  plasma  concentration  from  both  formulations  will  be  analysed  by  population 
pharmacokinetic (PK) approach and reported separately.

PK evaluations are as described in Appendix, to Protocol of clinical study A3921104 and 2 bioanalytical 
study reports for the determination of tofacitinib in human plasma were submitted one performed at PPD 
and one performed at Wuxi.  
Since there were 2 analytical labs (PPD and Wuxi) used to conduct tofacitinib sample analysis for this 
study, the applicant stated that a cross validation was conducted to ensure assay equivalency between 
the 2 labs. 
Plasma samples for PK analysis of tofacitinib were collected from all subjects enrolled in the study at 
various time points.  
Analytical methods 
PPD Project No. AKPG: THE DETERMINATION OF CP-690550 IN HUMAN PLASMA SAMPLES BY 
LC-MS/MS FROM PFIZER CLINICAL PROTOCOL A3921104. 
A  50-μL  matrix  aliquot  is  fortified  with  50  μL  of  10.0  ng/mL  PF-04994438  internal  standard  working 
solution. Analytes are isolated through solid phase extraction using Phenomenex Strata-X-C (10 mg, 33 
μm) 96-well SPE plates and eluted with 400 μL of ethanol/ammonium hydroxide (87:13, v/v). The eluate 
is evaporated under a nitrogen stream at approximately 50 °C, and the remaining residue is reconstituted 
with 100 μL of methanol/water (50:50, v/v). 
The  final  extract  is  analyzed  via  HPLC  and  MS/MS  detection  using  positive  ion  electrospray.  A  linear, 
1/concentration² weighted, least-squares regression algorithm is used to quantitate unknown samples. 
A summary of assay methodology is provided in the following table:

An Incurred Sample Reanalysis (ISR) assessment was conducted for this study as per Pfizer  WWPDM 
SOP  No.  25.  The  incurred  sample  reanalysis  was  performed  on  41  study  samples,  from  33  subjects. 
Samples were reanalyzed using the same analytical method and same dilution factors as used for the 
original reported results. The ISR assessment was conducted within freeze/thaw and LTS limits. 
Incurred sample repeats were considered acceptable if the original and re-assay values from two-thirds 
of the repeated samples had a relative percent difference of within ±20.0% for LC-MS/MS assays.  
Less than two-thirds of the repeated samples had a relative percent difference of within ±20.0% for LC-
MS/MS  assays  during  the  initial  ISR  assessment.  A  laboratory  investigation  to  evaluate  the  data  was 
initiated. The investigation resulted in reanalysis of sample runs 2AKPG, 4AKPG, and 5AKPG. After the 
investigation  and  reanalysis  of  runs  2AKPG,  4AKPG,  and  5AKPG,  the  results  of  the  incurred  sample 
repeats  met  the  ISR  acceptance  criteria.  The  original  analytical  results  will  be  reported  and  used  for 
pharmacokinetic assessments. Results of the ISR study will not be utilized as the reportable values of 
the samples used for PK analysis.

be reported and used for pharmacokinetic assessments. Results of the ISR study will not be utilized as 
the reportable values of the samples used for PK analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic Results 
The  result  of  the  population  PK  analysis  (a  pooling  analysis  of  data  from  study  A3921104  and  other 
previous studies)  will be reported separately in the Type II variation for pJIA. Moreover, the Applicant 
stated  that,  a  Phase  1  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  study  of  tofacitinib  in  JIA  subjects  (A3921103)  was 
completed  in  2015,  and  an  open-label,  non-comparative,  long-term  extension  study  (A3921145)  is 
ongoing,    as  part  of  this  paediatric  program.  Subjects  from  Study  A3921104  were  eligible  to  enter 
Study A3921145 to continue treatment with tofacitinib 5 mg BID IR tablets or weight equivalent dose of 
oral solution. 
Taste Acceptability 
Most  subjects  either  liked  the  taste  “very  much”  (34  [40.00%]  subjects)  or  “a  little”  (32  [37.65%] 
subjects). There were few subjects who disliked the taste “a little” (8 [9.41%] subjects) or “very much” 
(4 [4.71%] subjects) (A3921104 Study Report Section 11.1.1.3.11). 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
All 225 subjects that were assigned to treatment were included in the OLFAS. All 225 subjects in the 
OLFAS were analyzed for AEs. 
All 173 subjects that were treated in the double-blind phase were included in the DBFAS. A total of 142 
(82.1%) subjects were included in the double-blind polyarticular course JIA analysis set (DBJAS). 
There were 127 (73.4%), 16 (9.2%), and 15 (8.7%) subjects in the double-blind per protocol (DBJPP), 
double-blind ERA (DBERA) and double-blind PsA (DBPsA) analysis sets, respectively. The proportion of 
subjects excluded from the DBJPP analysis set was similar in both treatment groups. All 173 subjects 
in the DBFAS were analyzed for safety.

Baseline data 
OL 
Demographic: The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of subjects entering the open-label run-in phase 
was 11.9 (4.06) years, and the mean (SD) age when first diagnosed was 8.1 (4.66) years. There were 
more female (N=169) than male (N=56) subjects in the study, and most subjects in the open-label run-
in phase were White (196 [87.1%]). In total, there were 96 (42.7%) subjects from North America (United

Time to flare  
The Kaplan-Meier median time to event estimate was 155 days for the placebo group and could not be 
estimated for the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group because there were too few flare events and the 
probability of flare free was 70.8% (>50%) in this group. 
JIA ACR 50, 30, 70, 90, and 100 Responses 
ACR50: During the double-blind phase, a significant difference in the number of subjects achieving JIA 
ACR 50 response was first observed between subjects continuing tofacitinib 5 mg BID and subjects 
randomized to placebo at Week 24 (p=0.0034). Significantly more subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
group achieved a JIA ACR 50 response compared to the placebo group at each subsequent time point 
through Week 44 (p=0.0166). 
ACR30: A significant difference in the number of subjects achieving JIA ACR 30 response was first 
observed in the double-blind phase between subjects continuing tofacitinib 
5 mg BID and subjects randomized to placebo at Week 24 (p=0.0108). Compared to the placebo 
group, significantly more subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group achieved a JIA ACR 30 response at 
each subsequent time point through Week 44 (p=0.0031). 
ACR70: A significant difference in the number of subjects achieving JIA ACR 70 response was first 
observed in the double-blind phase between subjects continuing tofacitinib 5 mg BID and subjects 
randomized to placebo at Week 32 (p=0.0258). Significantly more subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
group achieved a JIA ACR 70 response compared to the placebo group at Weeks 36, 40, and 44 
(p=0.0149, p=0.0149, and p=0.0387, respectively).

AEs of special interest 
Drug induced liver injury There were 3 events adjudicated as possible or probable drug induced liver 
injury during the open-label run-in phase; 2 were mild and 1 was moderate. None met Hy's Law 
criteria. One subject was on paracetamol with a concurrent viral illness, which was considered a 
possible cause. This subject was also taking MTX at the time of the event. The second subject was also 
on paracetamol, when elevated AST and ALT occurred. This was considered moderate with probable 
relation. 
The third subject was not on paracetamol and had a finding consistent with mild hepatocellular effects 
that were deemed of probable relationship. All 3 events resolved. No drug induced liver injury events 
were adjudicated during the double-blind phase. 
Opportunistic infections and special interest infections, there were 2 cases of herpes zoster 
adjudicated during the open-label run-in phase and none during the double-blind phase. Both events 
were in a single dermatome, did not meet the criteria for being considered an opportunistic infection, 
and resolved. 
Four subjects had serious infections that occurred during the study. Three subjects during the open-
label run-in phase had serious infections: pneumonia, epidural empyema and sinusitis in a child with a 
history of craniosynostosis repair, and appendicitis. During the double-blind phase, there was 1 serious 
infectious event (appendicitis) in a subject being treated with placebo. One SAE/infection, pilonidal 
sinus repair, was coded to the SOC Surgical and medical procedures instead of Infections even though 
the subject was admitted to the hospital after surgery to treat a pilonidal cyst because of the infection, 
large incision site, and the need for wound vac placement. This event was inadvertently not captured 
in the programmed list of serious infection events. It was adjudicated as not meeting opportunistic 
infection criteria.

Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic Results 
Tofacitinib plasma concentrations for individual patients are listed in Appendix to clinical report for study 
A3921104. 
The  sparse  PK  sampling  design  precluded  non-compartmental  analysis  (NCA)  for  each  individual. 
Instead, the results this study will be pooled with other clinical studies to enable population PK analysis. 
The result of the population PK analysis will be reported separately in the Type II variation for pJIA. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects  
The MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for tofacitinib for treatment of polyarticular course 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as 
amended. 
This submission is in fulfilment of the Article 46 requirement. Study A3921104 is a deferred study in the 
JIA PIP (Study 6) with a completion date by February 2020.

A consequential Type II variation to update the SmPC with the relevant results is planned for submission 
in June 2020.  
Study design: Study A3921104 was a randomized withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of tofacitinib for treatment of polyarticular course juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children and adolescent subjects. Superiority of tofacitinib versus placebo was 
analysed. 
All  eligible  subjects  enrolled  in  the  study  initially  received  open-label  tofacitinib  for  18  weeks  (run-in 
phase). At the end of the 18-week run-in phase, only subjects who achieved at least a JIA American 
College  of  Rheumatology  (ACR)  30  response  were  randomized  to the  26-week  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled  phase.  Subjects  who  did  not  achieve  a  JIA  ACR  30  response  at  this  time  point  were 
discontinued  from  the  study.  Subjects  who  were  eligible  for  the  26-week  double-blind  phase  were 
randomized (1:1 ratio) to either active tofacitinib or placebo.  
Study  population:    185  subjects  completed  the  open-label  run-in  phase,  with  173  subjects  being 
randomized into the double-blind phase (88 subjects to tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 85 subjects to placebo). 
A total of 99 subjects completed the double-blind phase (61 in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and 38 in 
the  placebo  group).  Of  those  subjects,  97  were  rolled  over  into  the  A3921145  study  and  2  were 
discontinued.  Since  flares  led  to  discontinuation  during  the  double-blind  phase,  insufficient  clinical 
response was the most common discontinuation reason for double-blind discontinuation in both arms, 
with a higher percentage in the placebo group. 
Enrolled population reflects the International League Against Rheumatism (ILAR) JIA classification 
criteria. A minority of subjects were from EU countries 6 (2.7%). All age ranges were represented as 
follow: 12-18 y (61.8%), 6-≤12 y (28.4%) and 2-≤6 y(9.8%). Subjects had active JIA (mean number 
of joints with active arthritis (12.2 for OL) and number of joints with limitation of motion (mean 7.5 for 
OL).  
Results: Overall efficacy results were supportive of tofacitinib superiority as compared to placebo for 
the treatment of JIA subjects. Detailed assessment will be made within the variation the MAH will 
submit.  
Primary endpoint was the occurrence of disease flare from double-blind randomization through Week 
44 (type I Error Controlled) of study being significantly lower in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group 
compared to the placebo group (p-value=0.0031), with a difference of proportions (tofacitinib-placebo) 
of -23.69%, 95% CI (-39.41%, -7.97%).  
Efficacy was supported also by key secondary endpoints: i) JIA ACR 50, 30, and 70 responses (at Week 
44, Type I Error Controlled), a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with tofacitinib 5 mg 
BID achieved JIA ACR 50, 30, and 70 responses compared to subjects treated with placebo (p=0.0166, 
p=0.0031, and p=0.0387, respectively); ii) Change From Double-Blind Baseline in CHAQ Disability Index 
at Week 44 (Type I Error Controlled) the improvement was statistically greater in subjects treated with 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID than those treated with placebo, with a LS mean difference in the scores of -0.12, 
p-value=0.0292. 
Secondary endpoints results, although descriptive analysis was conducted, were generally supportive 
of better activity of tofacitinib as compared to placebo for different endpoints related to disease 
activity, however for endpoints more stringent the numerical difference was lower.  
Safety: In the OL phase, treatment-related TEAEs  were reported for 64 (28.4%) subjects during the 
open-label run-in phase. Most treatment-related TEAEs reported were mild to moderate in severity.

In the DB phase, treatment-related TEAEs were seen in 22 (25.0%) subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
group  and  33  (38.8%)  subjects in the  placebo group  during  the  double-blind phase.  Most  treatment-
related  TEAEs  reported  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity.  The  most  common  was  infections  and 
infestations occurring in 14.1% and 10.2% respectively in the OL and DB phase. Regarding severity in 
the OL phase only 1 case was classified as severe, in the DB phase no severe cases were reported in the 
tofacitinib arm and 1 case in the PLB arm. 
Regarding AEs of special interest, considering the entire tofacitinib exposure period, there were 3 cases 
of serious infections, 2 cases of zoster, no opportunistic infections, malignancies, deep vein thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolus, or arterial or venous thromboembolism. 
Overall the safety profile seems to not raise specific main safety concerns related to the paediatric age 
and  it  could  be  considered  generally  similar  to  that  of  the  already  approved  tofacitinib  indications. 
Detailed assessment of the data and potential SmPC changes will be done within the variation procedure 
the MAH will submit.  
Pharmacokinetic:  The  sparse  PK  sampling  design  precluded  non-compartmental  analysis  (NCA)  for 
each  individual.  Instead,  the  results  this  study  will  be  pooled  with  other  clinical  studies  to  enable 
population PK analysis. 
The result of the population PK analysis will be reported separately in the Type II variation for pJIA 
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
The MAH submitted a completed paediatric study (Study A3921104) for tofacitinib for treatment of 
polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended.

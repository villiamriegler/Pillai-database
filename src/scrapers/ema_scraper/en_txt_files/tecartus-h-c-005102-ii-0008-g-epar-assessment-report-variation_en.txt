2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a serious heterogeneous group of lymphoid disorders resulting 
from  the  clonal  proliferation  of  immature  precursor  B-  or  T-cell  lymphocytes  (blasts)  in  blood,  bone 
marrow, and other lymphatic (e.g. lymph nodes and spleen) and non-lymphatic organs (e.g. CNS, liver 
and bones). The disease occurs with a bimodal age distribution: 55% of cases diagnosed in patients < 
20  years  of  age,  and  28%  of  cases  diagnosed  in  adult  patients  ≥ 45 years  of  age  {National 
Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  2020}.  The  estimated  overall  incidence  of  ALL  in  the  EU  is  1.28 per 
100,000 individuals per year, with a higher incidence rate (1.45 per 100,000 individuals per year) among 
adults  aged  75 to 99 years  {Hoelzer  2016}.  Five-year  overall  survival  rates  for  children  are  89%, 
survival  rates  for  adults  remain  low  at  approximately  20%  to  40%  (approximately  20%  for  adults 
≥ 60 years of age), and the majority of ALL deaths are in adults {Siegel 2020}. 
ALL  can  be  classified  in  3  subtypes:  B-cell  precursor  ALL,  mature  B
cell  ALL,  and  T
cell  ALL.  B-ALL 
represents the most common form of ALL in adult patients. Further, 25% of adult patients with ALL have 
positive (Ph+) disease {National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2020}. Ph+ status confers a very 
Ph
‑
‑
poor  prognosis  with  5-year  OS  and  relapse-free  survival  (RFS)  rates  of  8%  and  0%,  respectively 
‑
{Pullarkat 2008}. 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 9/119 
 
  
 
 
 
The  pathogenic  causes  of  ALL  are  unknown.  However,  a  couple  of  endogenous  factors  as  defect 
congenital DNA repair mechanisms and exogenous factors (secondary neoplasia after radiotherapy or 
chemotherapy) are considered to contribute to the development of ALL. 
Biologic features 
CD19,  the  target  antigen  of  KTE-X19,  is  a  transmembrane  protein,  which  is  expressed  in  the  B-cell 
lineage. CD19 expression is maintained in most B-cell malignancies (CLL, a subset of multiple myeloma, 
subtypes of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma) and ALL.  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The  prognosis  for  r/r  B-ALL  after  failure  of  first  line  treatment  has  improved  by  the  bispecific  CD19-
directed  CD3  T-cell  engaging  agent  blinatumomab,  which  is  approved  in  the  EU  as  monotherapy  for 
treatment of adults with CD19 positive  r/r B-precursor ALL. Ph-positive patients should have received 
prior treatment with at least 2 TKIs. Blinatumomab is also indicated as monotherapy in paediatrics one 
year old or older with Ph-negative CD19-positiv B-precursor ALL, refractory or after at least two prior 
therapy regimens or after prior allogenic hSCT. The EU-approval of inotuzumab ozogamicin in 2017, a 
CD22-directd  antibody-drug  conjugate  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with  r/r  CD22-positive  B-precursor 
ALL  also  contributed  to  an  improvement  of  the  rates  for  overall  survival  for  patients  in  the 
refractory/relapsed situation.   
Unmet medical need 
With each subsequent relapse, the prognosis gets worse. A retrospective analysis of 1,706 adult subjects 
with Ph− r/r B-ALL found that the CR rate after first, second, and third or greater salvage therapy was 
40%, 21%, and 11%, respectively. Median OS decreased with each subsequent line of therapy; median 
OS after first, second, and third or greater salvage therapy was 5.8, 3.4, and 2.9 months, respectively 
{Gokbuget  2016b,  Kantarjian  2003,  O'Brien  2013}.  Patients  in  second  or  later  relapse  may  receive 
therapies utilized in the second line, such as allo- or auto-SCT. However, only few patients are eligible 
for SCT. Blinatumomab or inotuzumab may be evaluated also as third line treament if not previously 
used; however, outcomes with these treatments are typically not as favourable in patients being treated 
in the third line and beyond. Subjects receiving blinatumomab as a third or later line of therapy for B-
ALL had a median OS of 5.1 months compared with 11.1 months for those receiving blinatumomab as 
their second line {Dombret 2019}. The combined CR/CRi/CRh rate was also lower for subjects receiving 
blinatumomab  as  a  third  or  later  line  therapy  compared  with  those  receiving  blinatumomab  as  the 
second-line therapy (39.5% vs 51.0%, respectively). In the INO-VATE study, the CR/CRi rate was 77.8% 
for subjects receiving inotuzumab as the second line and 66.1% for those receiving inotuzumab as the 
third-line therapy {Kantarjian 2019}.  
Results of the TOWER study with a median DOR of 7.3 months among subjects achieving CR/Cri/CRh 
indicate that durability of response to blinatumomab was limited.  Twenty-four percent of subjects in the 
blinatumomab arm underwent a subsequent allo-SCT. Moreover, mortality rates following subsequent 
allo-SCT were high; among 38 subjects who achieved a CR/CRi/CRh to blinatumomab and underwent 
allo-SCT, 10 subjects (26%) died during a median follow-up period of 206 days. The importance of CR 
rates in oncological trials, especially in clinical trials of leukemia is acknowledged, as CR is associated with 
more durable response {Saygin 2016}, fewer infections and a reduced need for blood product support {U. 
S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) 2018}. In accordance to ESMO Guidelines patients 
in the refractory disease stage or in second or later relapse are recommended to participate in clinical 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 10/119 
 
  
 
 
trials for novel treatment, what per se supports the need for new therapy concepts. In addition to these 
efficacy limitations, there are concerns regarding safety. Binatumomab requires continuous intravenous 
(IV) infusion, and hospitalisation is recommended for a minimum of 9 days of the first cycle and the first 
2 days of the second cycle {BLINCYTO 2020}, while inotuzumab is associated with an increased risk of 
veno-occlusive hepatic disease, which could interfere with the potentially curative effects of allo-SCT. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Tecartus is a gene therapy medicinal product containing autologous T cells genetically modified 
whereby a patient’s own T cells are harvested and genetically modified ex vivo by retroviral 
transduction using an MSCV based gamma-retroviral vector to express a CAR comprising an anti-CD19 
single chain variable fragment (scFv) linked to CD28 co-stimulatory domains and CD3-zeta signalling 
domain . The transduced anti-CD19 CAR T cells are expanded ex vivo and infused back into the 
patient, where they can recognise and eliminate CD19 expressing target cells. Tecartus binds to CD19 
expressing cancer cells. Following anti-CD19 CAR T cell engagement with CD19 expressing target cells, 
the CD28 co-stimulatory domain and CD3-zeta signalling domain activate downstream signaling 
cascades that lead to T-cell activation, proliferation, acquisition of effector functions and secretion of 
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This sequence of events leads to apoptosis and necrosis of 
CD19 expressing target cells. 
2.1.3.  Scientific advice 
Scientific  advice  was  obtained  by 
the  SAWP 
in  May  2018 
(procedure  number: 
EMEA/H/SA/3117/6/2018/PA/ADT/III). The advice addressed the design of the phase 2 portion of the 
ZUMA-3  study,  specifically  the  inclusion  criteria  relating  to  prior  exposure  of  blinatumomab  and 
inotuzumab.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
The Quality change being proposed concerns the drug product dose when Tecartus is manufactured for 
the new B-ALL indication. 
When manufactured for the currently authorised MCL indication, Tecartus drug product is filled at a 
target dose of 2.0 × 10e6 cells per kg patient weight (maximum of 2.0 × 10e8 cells for patients >100 
kg). When manufactured for the proposed B-ALL indication, Tecartus drug product will be filled at a 
target dose of 1.0 × 10e6 cells per kg patient weight (maximum of 1.0 × 1e08 cells for patients >100 
kg) to align with clinical safety and efficacy data. 
The dose of KTE-X19 is a calculated value derived from patient body weight, measurements of viable 
cell concentration, and % Transduction. KTE-X19 is manufactured to a target dose of either 1.0 × 106 
anti-CD19 CAR-positive viable T cells per kg patient weight (maximum allowable dose: 1.0 × 108 anti-
CD19 CAR-positive viable T cells for a ≥ 100 kg patient) for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) 
patients, or 2.0 × 106 anti-CD19 CAR-positive viable T cells per kg patient weight (maximum allowable 
dose: 2.0 × 108 anti-CD19 CAR-positive viable T cells for a ≥ 100 kg patient) for Mantle Cell 
Lymphoma (MCL) patients. 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 11/119 
 
  
 
 
 
2.2.6  
Discussion on quality aspects 
Besides mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; authorised indication), patients with B-ALL are included to be 
treated with Tecartus. The manufacturing process is the same and also all DS/DP specifications are the 
same as for the initial indication of MCL. The only difference is the target dose of CAR-19 positive cells 
Here the specification on the DP levels is 1-2x10e6 cell/kg in MCL and 1x10e6 cells/kg in B-ALL. The 
respective inclusion of the additional specification of the dose (which is based on weight, viable cells 
and CAR-19 positive cells) is considered acceptable.   
The MAH did not provide any batch data of DS/DP batches manufactured from B-ALL patient material. 
The MAH was asked to provide a tabulated overview of all available clinical batch data on B-ALL.  This 
data should include the results of the IPC.  
Overall, the batch data for Tecartus indicate a certain variation which is donor dependent. A 
comparable variation is expected for B-ALL material. Therefore, it may not be possible to see whether 
there is a certain trending for one of the indications. A comparable range in terms of CD3+ purity is 
expected to be acceptable for B-ALL compared to MCL, but needs to be confirmed by data. 
The MAH was asked to provide a tabulated overview of all available clinical batch data that have been 
manufactured based on the starting material derived from B-ALL patients. This table should include the 
results for the in-process controls.  
The MAH provided the requested clinical batch data, including a tabulated overview on the results of the 
in-process controls. The MAA has been updated by including the batch data in section 3.2.P.5.4.1, 
respectively. The issue was considered resolved. 
2.2.7  
Conclusion on quality aspects 
The quality IB variation is considered approvable.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  KTE-X19  was  assessed  by  means  of  measuring  the  peak,  area-under- 
the-curve from Day 0 to Day 28 (AUC0-28; defined from baseline [Day 0] to Day 28), time-to-peak, and 
levels in blood over time for anti-CD19 CAR T cells at multiple time points after KTE-X19 infusion. The 
pharmacokinetic methods used in ZUMA-3 were developed and qualified internally by Kite Pharma, Inc. 
(REP-01261  and  REP-16761)  to  detect  and  quantify  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  in  blood  by  droplet  digital 
polymerase  chain  reaction  (ddPCR).  The  ddPCR  method  is  specific  for  the  anti-  CD19  CAR  transgene 
present  in  genomic  DNA  derived  from  cryopreserved  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells  (PBMCs)  of 
subjects who have received KTE-X19. As multiple gene copies can be integrated into a single human T 
cell, the ddPCR method is used to estimate anti-CD19 CAR transgene vector copy number (VCN). The 
ddPCR method quantifies the number of copies of the anti-CD19 CAR transgene and the housekeeping 
gene  adaptor-related  protein  complex  3  subunit  beta  1  (AP3B1)  in  DNA  using  specific  primers  and 
probes.

Results  
All phase I cohorts:  
Median  peak  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  levels  were  highest  in  subjects  treated  at  the  1e6  dose  level  with 
modified toxicity management (37.7 cells/μL), followed by subjects treated at the following dose levels 
(from the highest to the lowest): 1e6 cells/kg with original toxicity management (26.5 cells/μL); 0.5e6 
cells/kg (68 mL; 23.1 cells/μL); 2e6 cells/kg (8.6 cells/μL); and 0.5e6 cells/kg (40 mL; 4.7 cells/μL). 
Concerning the  median AUC0-28, median time-to-peak was 8 days for subjects treated either at 1e6 
cells/kg  with  modified  toxicity  management  or  0.5e6  cells/kg  (40  mL);  9  days  in  subjects  treated  at 
either 1e6 dose cells/kg with original toxicity management or 0.5e6 cells/kg (68 mL); and 15 days in 
subjects  treated  at  2e6  cells/kg.  Two  subjects  in  the  Phase  1  1e6  dose  cohort  (modified  toxicity 
management) had undetectable anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood at both Day 7 and Week 2: 1 subject 
achieved a CR and 1 subject relapsed per the investigators’ assessment. 
Combined phase 1 and phase 2 cohorts: 
Median  peak  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  levels  and  AUC0-28  for  subjects  in  Phase  2  (median  peak:  20.6 
cells/μL;  median  AUC0-28:  220.60  cells/μL•days)  were  similar  to  those  for  subjects  in  the  combined 
Phase  1  and  Phase  2  1e6  dose  cohorts  (median  peak:  24.3  cells/μL;  median  AUC0-28:  242.90 
cells/μL•days). The pattern of CAR T-cell expansion was similar in Phase 2 and in the combined Phase 1 
and Phase 2 1e6 dose cohorts. Median anti-CD19 CAR T-cell time-to-peak was 15 days for subjects in 
Phase 2 and for those in the combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 1e6 dose cohorts. By Month 6, levels of 
anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood declined to undetectable levels in 22 of 28 subjects (79%) with evaluable 
samples and by Month 12, levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood declined to undetectable levels in 18 
of  20  subjects  (90%)  with  evaluable  samples  (Listing  14.5.7.2).  Anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  levels  in  most 
Phase 2 subjects declined to undetectable levels at Month 6. Three subjects at Month 15 and one subject 
at Month 18 had low levels of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell that were marginally above the ddPCR assay detection 
limit. Peak levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells for these subjects were substantially higher relative to levels 
at Months 15 and/or 18. Detection of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood samples at Months 15 and/or 18 is 
likely attributable to assay sensitivity, with minor fluctuations in anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels over time 
above or below the assay LOD.

The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level for subjects in Phase 2 was 20.6 cells/μL, and the median 
time-to-peak was 15 days after the KTE-X19 infusion. The median area under-the-curve from Day 0 to 
Day 28 (AUC0-28) was 220.6 cells/μL•days. For subjects with evaluable samples, levels of anti-CD19 
CAR T cells in blood declined to undetectable levels in 22 of 28 subjects (79%) by Month 6 and in 18 of 
20 subjects (90%) by Month 12. 
Five subjects in Phase 2 had no detectable anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood at any time point evaluated. 
None of the 5 subjects had a CR or CRi based on best response by central assessment.

Results by subgroups 
Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels in blood (median peak and AUC0-28) were numerically lower in subjects < 
65 years of age compared with subjects ≥ 65 years of age. Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels were the highest 
in Asian subjects followed by (from the highest to the lowest) subjects who had missing race information, 
subjects who reported their race as other, and White subjects. It is noticeable that the number of subjects 
≥ 65 years of age and who were not White, was small. Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels (median peak and 
AUC0-28) were numerically lower in females than in males.

Results by use of tocilizumab/corticosteroids 
Median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels and AUC0-28 were higher in subjects who received tocilizumab 
alone or tocilizumab and corticosteroids than in subjects who received corticosteroids alone or who did 
not receive either of these medications. These results may be regarded to be attributed to the fact that 
higher anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels in blood could lead to more severe AEs, subsequently managed with 
tocilizumab alone or tocilizumab and corticosteroids.

Median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels and AUC0-28 were the highest in subjects who had achieved a 
CR, followed by (from the highest to the lowest) subjects who achieved a CRi, subjects who had blast-
free hypoplastic or aplastic bone marrow, and subjects who had no response to KTE-X19. Subjects with 
CR/CRi had higher median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels and AUC0-28 in blood relative to subjects 
who had non-CR (non-CR/CRi) (p < 0.001 for median peak and AUC0-28 values) (Figure 2). Three of 39 
subjects who achieved CR or CRi and 2 of 16 subjects who were non-CR/CRi had no anti-CD19 CAR T-
cell data at all postinfusion visits.

Results on association of PK of KTE-X19 and Safety Outcomes 
Peak and AUC0-28 of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels in blood were examined for associations with CRS and 
neurologic events in Phase 2. Among the 55 subjects in the Phase 2 safety analysis set, 13 subjects had 
worst Grade 3 or higher CRS and 42 subjects had worst Grade 2 or lower CRS. No associations were 
observed between anti-CD19 CAR T-cell peak and AUC0-28 with frequency of worst Grade 3 or higher 
CRS relative to worst Grade 2 or lower CRS. Median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels were numerically 
lower, but not statistically different, in subjects with worst Grade 3 or higher CRS versus subjects with 
worst  Grade  2  or  lower  CRS  (16.7  vs  22.8  cells/μL).  Similarly,  the  median  AUC0-28  was  numerically 
lower, but not statistically different, in subjects with worst Grade 3 or higher CRS versus subjects with 
worst Grade 2 or lower CRS (174.4 vs 240.8 cells/μL•days) 
Among subjects in the Phase 2 safety analysis set, 14 subjects had worst Grade 3 or higher neurologic 
AEs, and 41 subjects had worst Grade 2 or lower neurologic AEs. A potential association was observed 
between  median  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  peak  and  AUC0-28  with  frequency  of  worst  Grade  3  or  higher 
neurologic AEs versus worst Grade 2 or lower neurologic AEs. Median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels 
were 3.4-fold higher in subjects with worst Grade 3 or higher neurologic AEs versus subjects with worst 
Grade 2 or lower neurologic AEs (61.4 vs 17.9 cells/μL). Similarly, the median AUC0-28 was 3.6-fold 
higher in subjects with worst Grade 3 or higher neurologic AEs versus subjects with worst Grade 2 or 
lower neurologic AEs (670.2 vs 186.6 cells/μL•days).

Results on association of B-cell levels with PK of KTEX-19 and Efficacy Outcomes 
Associations between B-cell levels, anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels, and ongoing response based on central 
assessment  (ongoing  CR/CRi,  relapse,  and  lack  of  response  [no-CR/CRi])  were  evaluated  in  Phase  2 
subjects. At Day 28, 7 of 9 subjects (77.8%) who achieved ongoing CR/CRi and had evaluable samples 
and 9 of 11 subjects (81.8%) who relapsed and had evaluable samples had B-cell levels below the lower 
level of quantification (LLOQ). One of 4 non-responders (25.0%) who had evaluable samples had B-cell 
levels below LLOQ. For subjects who achieved ongoing CR/CRi and had evaluable samples at the time

points described, B-cell recovery was observed in 6 of 10 subjects (60.0%) at Month 3, in 8 of 10 subjects 
(80.0%)  at  Month  6,  and  in  10  of  10  subjects  (100%)  at  Month  12.  Fourteen  subjects  in  ongoing 
response, who either underwent allo-SCT (9 subjects) or started a new anticancer therapy (5 subjects), 
were not included in this analysis. 
Results on association of B-ALL CD19 Expression and PK of KTE-X19 
CD19 expression ranged from 47% to 100% across all subjects in Phase 2. High CD19 expression was 
defined as ≥ 95%, and low CD19 expression was defined as <95%. The range of CD19 expression was 
95% to 100% in the high group and 47% to 92% in the low group.  In Phase 2, 53 of 55 subjects had 
evaluable samples for CD19 expression at baseline, and 41 subjects had high CD19 expression and 12 
subjects had low CD19 expression. Samples from 2 subjects were unavailable for testing.  
According to table 4 there is an indication of lower anti-CD19 CAR-T cell expansion by peak and AUC0-
28 in subjects with high tumor CD19 expression (median peak = 13.1 cells/μL and median AUC0-28 = 
137.7 cells/μL•days) than in subjects with low tumor CD19 expression (median peak = 31.0 cells/μL and 
median AUC0-28 = 423.1 cells/μL•days). However, the number of subjects with low CD19 expression is 
quite small (N = 12).

Results on Association of Bridging Therapy and PK of KTE-X19 
Fifty-one of 55 subjects in Phase 2 received bridging therapy prior to lymphodepletion chemotherapy 
and infusion of KTE-X19. Results as presented in Table 5 indicate a numerically lower median anti-CD19 
CAR  T-cell  peak  levels  in  subjects  who  received  bridging  therapy  (median  peak  =  18.6  cells/μL  and 
median AUC0-28 = 209.2 cells/μL•days) than in subjects who did not receive bridging therapy (median 
peak = 56.1 cells/μL and median AUC0-28 = 546.0 cells/μL•days).

B-Cell Evaluation  
On-target/off-tumor effect of KTE-X19 on normal CD19-expressing B cells, the presence and percentage 
of CD19+, CD20+, or CD19+CD20+ B cells in cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
were evaluated by a flow cytometry assay leveraging pre- and post-treatment PBMC. B-cell levels were 
calculated  as  a  percentage  of  CD19+,  CD20+,  or  CD19+CD20+  B  cells  relative  to  viable  CD45+

leukocytes in a flow cytometry assay. It should be noted that this assay does not reliably distinguish 
between normal and leukemic CD19+CD20+cells present in PBMC, which is known. 
Other Analytes 
The MRD− rate (minimal residual disease) was defined as the incidence of an MRD− response, where 
MRD− was defined as MRD < 10-4 per the standard assessment by flow cytometry performed by the 
central laboratory. Subjects were considered MRD− overall, if they achieved an MRD− response at any 
prespecified postinfusion visit (ie, Day 28, Week 8, or Month 3); otherwise, subjects were considered 
MRD+ overall. Best overall MRD response was examined herein for exploratory associations with KTE-
X19 expansion kinetics. 
Bone marrow aspirates collected at in predefined intervals described in the ZUMA-3 protocol schedule of 
assessment at screening, Day −4 (only for subjects who received bridging), Day 28, Week 8, and Month 
3 after KTE-X19 infusion, were examined in Rolle, Switzerland for EU sites. In addition, peripheral blood 
was collected at screening or Day −4 for use as an assay calibration sample, if needed. The B-ALL MRD 
flow cytometry assay measures the following markers and is designed to identify and enumerate B-ALL 
blasts: CD3, CD9, CD10, CD13, CD19, CD20, CD33, CD34, CD38, CD45, CD58, and CD71. 
Results 
Selected Serum Analytes  
Among all evaluable subjects in Phase 2, the main observations were the following: 
Day 0 (after lymphodepleting chemotherapy): Median serum levels of homeostatic cytokines IL-7 and 
IL-15  increased  by  ≥  2-fold  and  median  serum  levels  of  perforin  decreased  by  ≥  2-fold  relative  to 
baseline. 
Day 3: Median IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-15, and interferon [IFN]-γ serum levels were elevated by ≥ 2-
fold relative to baseline in most subjects. The majority of the other 18 preselected serum analytes were 
comparable relative to baseline (< 2-fold change). 
Day  7:  Median  CRP,  C-X-C  motif  chemokine  (CXCL)10,  granzyme  B,  IFN-γ,  interleukin-1  receptor 
antagonist (IL-1RA), IL-2, interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R)α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-15 were elevated by 
≥  2-fold  relative  to  baseline  in  most  subjects.  Median  serum  levels  of  the  majority  of  the  18  other 
preselected serum analytes were comparable relative to baseline. 
TNF-alpha: 34 of 55 subjects (61.8%) demonstrated a 2-fold higher change in serum levels over baseline 
and they generally returned to baseline by week 4. 
Median time-to-peak for the 18 preselected serum analytes, except for ferritin and perforin, was between 
7  and  8 days  after  infusion  of  KTE-X19.  Median  time-to-peak  was  9  days  for  ferritin  and 15  days  for 
perforin. Most of the 18 preselected serum analytes were elevated by ≥ 2-fold at peak compared with 
baseline in ≥ 50% of subjects (exceptions: intracellular adhesion molecule, perforin, and vascular cell 
adhesion molecule). 
Week 4: Eleven of 18 preselected serum analytes returned to near or below baseline levels; 7 analytes 
remained elevated by ≥ 2-fold in ≥ 20% of subjects (CXCL10, IFN-γ, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, and IL-
15).

B-Cell Levels in Blood over the Time 
In  Phase  2,  at  baseline,  47  of  49  tested  subjects  (95.9%)  had  detectable  B  cells;  the  median  B-cell 
percentage in PBMC was 22.7% (range: 0.05% to 87.6%). At Day 28 (the first time point at which B 
cells were measured after KTE-X19 infusion), 9 of the 36 tested subjects (25.0%) had detectable B cells 
and the median B-cell percentage was 0.05% (range: 0.02% to 56.7%). At Month 12, all 22 subjects 
(100%) with evaluable samples had detectable B cells (median: 20.1% [range: 0.02% to 93.7%]). 
In the combined Phase 1 cohorts (Phase 1 subjects treated at all dose levels, N = 45), all subjects with 
evaluable baseline PBMC samples (n = 35) had detectable B cells. At Day 28, 13 of 25 subjects (52.0%) 
with evaluable samples had detectable B cells, and the median B-cell percentage was 0.40% (range: 
0.02% to 96.7%). At Month 12, all 12 subjects (100%) with evaluable PBMC samples had detectable B 
cells (median: 13.9% [range: 4.4% to 40.8%]).

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic,  pharmacodynamic  and  other  translational  medicine  analyses  presented  are  derived 
from data from n=55 subjects treated with KTE-X19 in the ZUMA-3 clinical trial with a data cutoff date 
of 09 September 2020 and a potential median study follow-up of 16.4 months. The assessments were 
based on current knowledge of mechanism of action of KTE-X19. Pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints were 
levels of cytokines in serum and levels of B-cells over the time; levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood 
was  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  endpoint  in  the  study.  Exploratory  endpoints  were  investigation  of 
associations among PD, PK, efficacy and safety outcomes. The median total number of anti-CD19 CAR T 
cells in KTE-X19 infusion products was 75.7 x 106 cells (range: 39.3 x 106 to 101.0 x 106 cells), and 
the median total number of T cells infused was 128.4 x 106 cells (range: 65.5 x 106 to 277.8 x 106 
cells). All but one of the 55 subjects (98%) received within 10% of the planned target dose.  The median 
time-to-peak of anti-CD19 CAR T cell levels in blood occurred at Day 15 after infusion of KTE-X19. Both 
median anti-CD19 CAR T cell levels and AUC0-28 were higher in patients who were in CR/CRi compared 
to  patients,  who  did  not  achieve  CR/CRi  and/or  relapsed,  in  patients  who  were  MRD  negative  versus 
patients who were MRD positive, in males versus females and in subjects with grade 2 or higher CRS.  
The 18 preselected serum analytes had their peak generally around Day 7-8 after administration of KTE-
X19 and decreased to baseline-levels by Week 4. The following key associations with grade 3 or higher 
CRS and/or neurotoxicity have been observed:  
• 
• 
• 
Positive association for Grade 3 or higher CRS and peak serum levels of ferritin, granzyme B, IL-
2Rα, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and GMCSF. 
Positive association for Grade 3 or higher neurologic AEs and peak serum levels of IL-1RA and IL-6. 
Positive association for Grade 2 or higher neurologic AEs and peak serum levels of IL-1RA, IL-2Rα, 
IL-10, and IFN-γ. 
These results can be considered consistent with the known mechanism of action of anti-CD19 CAR T cells 
in  general,  which  is  induction  of  cytokines  and  inflammatory  cytokines  after  lymphodepletion  and 
chemokines after CAR T-cell infusion.  
Results  on  association  of  KTE-X19  characteristics  with  PK,  efficacy  and  safety  outcomes  revealed  no 
potential  trend  by  median  peak  of  CAR  T  cells  or  AUC0-28.There  was  also  no  significant  relationship 
observed  between  product  characteristics  by  quartile  and  key  efficacy  (CR/CRi)  and  safety  outcomes 
(CRS and neurologic AEs). However, those observations are of limited value due to the small number of 
subjects in the respective subgroups.  
Notwithstanding,  some important  results  regarding possible  associations  of  product  characteristics  by 
quartile and adverse events could be identified: 
•  Higher incidence of Grade 3 or higher CRS in subjects who received products that produced lower 
IFN-γ in co-culture and in subjects who received a lower total number of anti-CD19 CAR T cells. 
•  Higher incidence of Grade 3 or higher neurologic AEs or serious Grade 3 or higher neurologic AEs in 
subjects who received products with higher levels of IFN-γ produced in co-culture, a higher total 
number of anti-CD19 CAR T cells, lower percentages of CD4+ T cells, higher percentages of CD8+ 
T cells, and a lower CD4:CD8 ratio. 
•  Higher  incidence  of  serious  infections  or  Grade  3  or  higher  serious  infections  in  subjects  who 
received products that had lower levels of IFN-γ produced in co-culture and in subjects who received 
products with a lower percentage of CD4+ T cells, a higher percentage of CD8+ T cells, and a lower 
CD4:CD8 ratio.

2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The results presented on clinical pharmacology for KTE-X19 in n=55 adult patients with r/r ALL (ZUMA-
3)  largely  are  comparable  with  those  provided  for  the  marketing  authorisation  of  Tecartus  in  the 
indication  mantle  cell  lymphoma  after  2  or  more  lines  of  systemic  therapy,  granted  on  14  December 
2020  as  a  conditional  approval.      However,  due  to  the  limited  number  of  patients,  results  on  the 
pharmacology of KTE-X19, particularly in specific clinically meaningful subgroup analyses such as Ph-
positive and/or negative patients, tumor burden at baseline etc., should be considered with caution. 
IFN-γ,  CD8+  cells  and  CD4+  cells  seem  to  be  clinically  important  in  view  of  both  analysis  on  their 
suitability  as  potential  surrogate  markers  for  CAR  T  cell  persistence  and  in  view  of  relation  to  the 
occurrence  of  adverse  events  ≥  grade  3.  According  to  the  literature  database,  investigations  on 
correlations between CAR T cells in blood IFN-γ- and further important IFN-levels in plasma as well as 
the role of CD8+ and CD4+ on efficacy and safety of CAR T cell therapy are ongoing; currently, however 
there  seems  to  be  no  final  conclusion  on  their  suitability  as  markers.  Further  investigations  on 
pharmacology parameters, subgroups considered, and possible relationships between KTE-X19 product 
specifics and occurrence of adverse events would be needed.  
The presented data is acceptable to support the clinical pharmacology of the new indication in ALL in the 
context of the CMA.

Treatments 
In ZUMA-3 Phase 1, 45 subjects were enrolled and treated at 0.5 x 106, 1 x 106, or 2 x 106 anti-CD19 
CAR T cells/kg. The dose of 1 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg showed the highest efficacy, a manageable 
safety profile, and the most favorable benefit-risk profile across the doses evaluated. Therefore, the dose 
of 1 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg (maximum dose of 1 x 108 anti-CD19 CAR T cells for subjects ≥ 100 
kg) was considered the recommended Phase 2 dose. 
In the Phase 2 portion of ZUMA-3, 55 subjects were treated with KTE-X19 at a dose of 1.0 x 106 anti-
CD19 CAR T cells/kg. The primary analysis was planned to occur when the overall study enrollment was 
complete and the last treated subject in Phase 2 modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set had had 
the opportunity to complete the Month 6 disease assessment. At the time of the data cutoff date for the 
primary analysis, all subjects in the mITT analysis set had had the opportunity to be followed for at least 
10 months after the KTE X19 infusion. This overview summarizes the results of the primary efficacy and 
safety analyses for subjects in ZUMA-3 Phase 2 with a data cutoff date of 09 September 2020. Subjects 
in Phase 1 were not part of the pivotal analysis. 
KTE-X19  was  administered  after  a  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy  regimen  (conditioning  therapy) 
consisting of fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day on Day −4, Day −3, and Day −2; and cyclophosphamide 900 
mg/m2/day administered IV on Day −2.

Sample size 
The planned enrollment to this study (phase 1 and 2) was 100 subjects. 
During Phase 2, approximately 50 subjects in the modified-intention to treat (mITT) set were planned 
to be assessed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KTE-X19. With this sample size the study was 
expected to have approximately 93% power to distinguish between an active therapy with a 65% true 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 33/119 
 
  
 
 
 
overall complete remission rate from a therapy with an overall complete remission rate of 40% or less 
with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.025. 
Of note in the original study protocol, a different calculation was presented, assuming with the same 
planned sample size of approximately n=50 a power of 86% to distinguish between an active therapy 
with a 40% true overall complete remission rate from a therapy with an overall complete remission 
rate of 20% or less with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.025. This planning included a futility assessment 
after n=20 patients. 
Randomisation 
This is a single arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
This is a single arm study, and therefore open-label. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis and covariates 
An exact binomial test was planned to be used to compare the observed response rate to the threshold 
of 40%. This is acceptable for a phase 2 exploratory study. However, there is concern that 
heterogeneity in patients’ prognosis might have an impact on results in this single arm study, thus 
limiting a confirmatory interpretation.  
Upon request, the applicant confirmed that CR rates are heterogeneous in the literature (an I^2 
estimate of 52% was observed for the results of the meta-analysis of CR rates). 
The applicant referred to literature stating that heterogeneous definitions of CR may be the reason for 
this observed heterogeneity. It is agreed that this may be an explanation, however, this does not 
resolve uncertainty on possible CR rates. Thus, uncertainty remains. 
Significance level and multiplicity 
The planned significance level of 0.025 (one-sided) is in principle acceptable. However, the phase 2 
part of the study is intended to be interpreted as a single pivotal study, implying that results should be 
compelling, also by means of statistical significance  
A hierarchical approach was chosen to test the secondary endpoint of minimum residual disease 
negative rate against the threshold of 30% upon rejection of the primary null hypothesis of complete 
remission ≤40%. A hierarchical approach is acceptable. The hierarchical testing was introduced in 
amendment 4 (10 March 2017). 
Interim analyses 
According to the latest version of the protocol, one interim analysis was planned for safety only. 
However there were several changes to interim analyses: 
Initially, two interim analyses were planned after 20 and 35 patients in phase 2 in the mITT set had 
the opportunity to be followed for 8 weeks or 28 days after infusion respectively, with assessments 
planned for futility and safety. This was subsequently changed several times during the course of the 
study: 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 34/119 
 
  
 
 
In amendment 3 (28 July 2016), the second interim analysis with 35 patients was planned to assess 
early demonstration of efficacy, and a Lan-DeMets alpha-spending function with O’Brian-Fleming type 
boundaries was planned for multiplicity control. 
Assessment of efficacy at interim analysis 2 was removed in amendment 4 (10 March 2017), but the 
interim analysis was kept for other purposes. 
Finally, in protocol amendment 6 (31 October 2018) the second interim analysis was removed. 
The timing of the interim analyses was amended several times throughout the study as well. 
Changes to the protocol 
As discussed above, there were several relevant changes to interim analyses, hypotheses and 
multiplicity. 
Although most of them were introduced before the first patient was enrolled to phase 2 (on 01 October 
2018), this may reflect that the study was initially planned as an exploratory trial with some 
uncertainty. Given the above discussion, the assessors conclude that not all uncertainty can be 
resolved, and a confirmatory interpretation remains difficult. However, given the circumstances, an ad-
hoc interpretation of results seems warranted. 
Historical control and meta-analyses of outcomes in r/r ALL 
The  rationale  for  a  prespecified  40%  OCR  historical  control  rate  was  informed  by  rates  observed  in 
published  studies  of  second-line  or  later  chemotherapy  and  SCT  regimens  and  in  pivotal  studies  of 
blinatumomab. The blinatumomab studies, which included patient populations similar to those enrolled 
in ZUMA-3, resulted in CR/CRh rates of approximately 42%; the CR rates were 32.4% in the Phase 2 
study  (Study  MT103-211)  and  33.6%  in the  Phase 3  TOWER  study.  By  comparison,  standard-of-care 
chemotherapy for subjects in the TOWER study yielded a CR rate of 15.7% and CR/CRh rate of 20.1% 
{BLINCYTO 2019, Kantarjian 2017}.  
In  order  to  allow  matched  subject  comparison,  a  prespecified,  retrospective,  matched-cohort  study 
derived from individual subject-level data sampled from historical clinical trials (HCTs) contained within 
the  Medidata  Enterprise  Data  Store  (MEDS)  database.  MEDS  is  a  collection  of  thousands  of  previous 
clinical  trials  with  subject-level  data  recorded  through  the  Medidata  electronic  data  capture  system, 
Rave.  This  companion  study,  referred  to  as  SCHOLAR-3,  was  matched  to  the  ZUMA-3  Phase  2  mITT 
analysis set and was intended to provide context for interpreting the ZUMA-3 results and confirm the 
prespecified control response rate. 
A total of 40 subjects previously naïve to blinatumomab and inotuzumab treatment were included in the 
study; 20 from ZUMA-3 matched to 20 from historical trials; this was referred to as synthetic control 
arm 1 (SCA-1). A further 49 blinatumomab or inotuzumab pretreated subjects were also included in the 
study; 29 from ZUMA-3 matched to 20 from historical trials; this was referred to as synthetic control 
arm 2 (SCA-2). Data for OCR and OS were available for SCA-1; only OS data were available for SCA-2. 
No appropriate matches from HCTs were found for 6 subjects from the ZUMA-3 mITT population; these 
subjects were thus excluded. 
Note  that  29  subjects  in  SCA-2  were  originally  matched  with  29  subjects  from  ZUMA-3;  however,  9 
subjects in SCA-2 were later excluded from the analysis since they did not have a documented relapse 
prior to starting a subsequent therapy. In a post hoc analysis, OCR rate and OS were compared between 
all  subjects  from  ZUMA-3,  irrespective  if  they  had  previously  been  pre-treated  with  blinatumomab  or 
EMA/683619/2022

inotuzumab,  versus  matched  subjects  from  HCTs  who  had  not  previously  been  treated  with 
blinatumomab or inotuzumab; this was referred to as synthetic control arm 3 (SCA-3).

Outcomes and estimation 
From Phase 2, mITT analysis set. 
Primary efficacy endpoint: OCR 
The OCR rate in the mITT analysis set was 70.9% (39 of 55 subjects, 95% CI: 57%, 82%), with a CR 
rate of 56.4% (31 of 55 subjects, 95% CI: 42%, 70%). Among the 39 subjects who achieved a CR or 
CRi, the median time to response was 1.1 months (range: 0.85 to 2.99 months).

There is also a combined analysis of OCR rate for all subjects treated at the 1e6 dose level in Phases 1 
and 2 provided. Results are as follows: Among the 78 subjects, treated, the OCR rate per investigator 
assessment was 74.4% (58 of 78 subjects, 95% CI: 63%, 84%), with a CR rate of 62.8% (49 of 78 
subjects, 95% CI: 51%, 74%).

Subgroup analyses 
OCR and CR in the mITT population per central assessment were investigated by demographics, baseline 
characteristics, and prior therapies.  
The lowest OCR rate in terms of the tumor stage was of 42% observed among subjects with the highest 
disease burden (> 75% to 100% blasts in bone marrow) at baseline (N = 19). OCR rates were 90% for 
subjects  with  only  1  prior  line  of  therapy  (n  =  10).  Results  per  prior  treatment  [note:  OCR  rate  for 
subjects with only 1 prior line of therapy (n = 10) was 80%]:  
-  60% for subjects who had received prior blinatumomab (n = 25)  
-  67% for subjects with prior inotuzumab (n = 12) 
-  70% for subjects with prior SCT (N = 23) 
-  67% for subjects with prior blinatumomab and inotuzumab (n = 6)  
-  73% for subjects with prior SCT and blinatumomab (n = 11) 
-  80% for subjects with prior SCT and inotuzumab (n = 5) and  
-  100% for subjects with prior SCT, blinatumomab, and inotuzumab (N = 2).

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
1.  MRD- rate in the mITT anlysis set 
The  overall  MRD−  rate  was  76%  (42  of  55  subjects;  95%  CI:  63%,  87%).  13  subjects  were  not 
considered MRD− overall, 9 subjects were non-responders, and 3 subjects were not evaluable for MRD-
disease response, and 1 subject with a CR did not have MRD assessments performed. Among subjects 
with CR or CRi, the MRD− rate was 97% (38 of 39 subjects; 95% CI: 87%, 100%). One subject who 
achieved a CR did not have samples sent to the central laboratory for MRD assessment.

3.  DOR by central assessment 
Among the 39 subjects in the mITT analysis set who achieved a CR or CRi, the KM median DOR was 12.8 
months (95% CI: 8.7 months, not estimable [NE]), while 26 subjects were censored:  
-  12 subjects in ongoing remission as of DCO,  
-  9 subjects had an allo-SCT, and  
-  5 subjects started new anticancer therapy.  
The KM median DOR was 14.6 months (95% CI: 9.6 months, NE) for subjects with CR and 8.7 months 
(95% CI: 1.0, 12.8 months) for subjects with CRi.

4.  Rate of Allo-SCT after treatment with KTE-X19 (mITT analysis set) 
Ten of 55 subjects (18%) were treated with allo-SCT while in remission after the initial KTE-X19 infusion; 
of these, 7 subjects had achieved a CR and 2 subjects had achieved a CRi to KTE-X19 treatment (based 
on  the  central  assessment).  One  subject  received  an  allo-SCT  after  achieving  a  CRi  per  investigator 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 52/119 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
assessment,  however,  was  considered  to have  a  best  response  of  BFBM  per  central  assessment.  The 
median time from KTE-X19 infusion to allo-SCT was 98 days (range: 60 to 207 days). Of the 10 subjects 
who received allo-SCT after KTE-X19 infusion, 1 subject (10%) died within 100 days after allo-SCT. The 
remaining 9 subjects (90%) were in ongoing remission 100 days after the transplant. 
5.  Overall Survival (OS) 
KM estimates of OS at Month 12 and Month 18 were 71.4% (95% CI: 57.0%, 81.7%) and 58.6% (95% 
CI: 41.8%, 72.1%), respectively. The KM median OS was 18.2 months (95% CI: 15.9 months, NE), with 
a reverse KM median follow-up time for OS of 15.5 months (95% CI: 13.1, 17.6 months). The KM median 
OS was not reached (95% CI: 16.2 months, NE) for subjects with CR or CRi and was 2.4 months (95% 
CI: 0.7 months, NE) for all other subjects in the mITT analysis set. The KM median OS was not reached 
(95% CI: 18.2 months, NE) for subjects with CR and was 9.0 months (95% CI: 3.2, 14.2 months) for 
subjects with CRi. With regard to patients who were MRD-, the KM median OS was not reached (95% 
CI: 16.2 months, NE) and was 9.5 months (95% CI: 2.2 months, NE) for subjects who were MRD+ and 
1.5 months (95% CI: 0.3, 2.7 months) for subjects with missing MRD assessments.

-  Subgroup analyses of OS at Month 12 (mITT analysis set)  
The KM estimate of OS at Month 12 in the mITT analysis set was examined in diverse clinical relevant 
subgroups  of  age,  race,  gender,  baseline  disease  characteristics,  prior  lines  of  therapy  etc.  (source: 
Figure 11, clinical efficacy report body). OS rates were comparable for subjects who had been previously 
treated with blinatumomab (53%, n = 25); inotuzumab (54%, n = 12); SCT (78%, n= 23); SCT and 
blinatumomab  (64%,  n=  11);  SCT  and  inotuzumab  (60%,  n  =  5);  and  SCT,  blinatumomab,  and 
inotuzumab (50%, n = 2). Moreover, OS rates were 100% among elderly subjects ≥ 65 years of age (n 
= 8), 50% among subjects with extramedullary disease at baseline (n = 6), and 93% among subjects 
who were Ph+ (n = 15). These rates were generally consistent with the KM estimate of OS at Month 12 
of 71.4% observed for the overall population.  
6.  RFS by central assessment (mITT analysis set) 
KM estimates of RFS rates at Month 6 and Mont 12 were 57.6% (95% CI: 42.6%, 69.9%) and 44.3% 
(95%  CI:  28.6%,  59.0%),  respectively.  The  KM  median  RFS  was  11.6  months  (95%  CI:  2.7,  15.5 
months), with a reverse KM median follow-up time for RFS of 11.7 months (95% CI: 3.2, 15.0 months). 
Twenty-six subjects were censored:  
-  12 subjects in ongoing remission as of the data cutoff date 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 54/119 
 
  
 
 
 
 
-  9 subjects had an allo-SCT, and  
-  5 subjects started new anticancer therapy. 
Twelve subjects relapsed, 1 subject died, and 16 subjects did not have a best response of CR or CRi. 
Among subjects with CR or CRi, the KM median RFS was 14.2 months (95% CI: 11.6 months, NE). The 
KM median RFS was 15.5  months (95% CI: 11.6 months, NE) for subjects with CR and 11.7 months 
(95% CI: 1.8, 14.2 months) for subjects with CRi. The KM median RFS was 12.3 months (95% CI: 10.3 
months, NE) for subjects who were MRD− and 0.0 months (95% CI: NE) for subjects who were MRD+ 
or had missing MRD assessments. Subgroup analysis of RFS had been conducted for Month 6 only and 
not for Month 12. Given the generally small number of patients in the respective subgroups, overall, the 
rates were generally consistent, observed for the overall population.

Efficacy in the Phase 2 full analysis set (FAS) 
The OCR rate was 54.9% (39 of 71 subjects, 95% CI: 43%, 67%), with a CR rate of 43.7% (31 of 71 
subjects, 95% CI: 32%, 56%). With regard to DOR, the results were identical to the results in the mITT 
analysis set, as DOR war defined only for subjects who achieved and OCR.

Concerning the OS rates, KM estimates at Month 12 and Month 18 were 62.3% (95% CI: 49.4%, 72.7%) 
and 51.8% (95% CI: 37.5%, 64.3%), respectively. The KM median OS was 19.2 months (95% CI: 10.4 
months,  NE),  with  a  reverse  KM  median  follow-up  time  for  OS  of  16.0  months  (95%  CI:  13.6,  18.3 
months). This compares largely to a KM median OS of 18.2 months in the mITT analysis set, and the 
difference is due to the calculation of OS from the time of enrollment (full analysis set) versus from the 
time of KTE-X19 infusion (mITT).

Additional analyses provided upon request per DCO 23 July 2021 
The additional analyses included the following: 1) an updated central assessment of 23 subjects from 
ZUMA-3 Phase 1 treated with the same pivotal dose as subjects from Phase 2, leading to an increased 
sample size of 78 treated subjects; 2) a 21-month follow-up analysis with a substantially longer median 
follow-up of 20.5 months (range: 0.3, 32.6 months, data cut off [DCO] 23 July 2021) over the primary 
analysis with a median follow-up of 12.4 months (range: 0.3, 22.1 months, DCO 09 September 2020); 
and 3) an update of the SCHOLAR-3 results with a full analysis set (FAS) analysis to include subjects 
who  did  not  receive  KTE-X19  infusion  in  ZUMA-3.  In  addition,  SCHOLAR-3  analyses  for  the  original 
modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set were repeated with a more recent date cutoff (DCO 23 July 
2021). 
Among the 78 subjects treated with the pivotal dose in the combined Phase 1 + Phase 2 analysis set, 
37%  had  previously  received  an  allo-SCT,  49%  had  received  prior  blinatumomab,  and  22%  of  the 
subjects had received prior inotuzumab therapy. The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range: 1 
to  8);  19%  had  received  1  line,  33%  had  received  2  lines,  24%  had  received  3 lines,  and  23%  had 
received ≥ 4 lines of prior therapy. A total of 31% of the subjects had primary refractory disease, 77% 
had r/r disease to ≥ 2 line of therapy, 38% had r/r disease after allo-SCT, and 28% had first relapse 
with first remission lasting ≤ 12 months. The median percentage of blasts in bone marrow at baseline 
was  63.0%  (range:  0%  to  98%);  12%  of  the  subjects  had  an  extramedullary  disease.  The  updated 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 60/119 
 
  
 
 
 
 
central  assessment  data  of  the  78 subjects  treated  with  the  pivotal  dose  in  the  combined  Phase  1  + 
Phase 2 analysis set continue to demonstrate a significant clinically meaningful benefit compared with 
currently  available  therapies.  Risks  associated  with  KTE-X19  treatment  in  ZUMA-3,  such  as  CRS  and 
neurologic events, mostly occurred in the first month after cell infusion and were largely reversible and 
manageable with medical intervention. 
The results of the 21-month follow-up analysis demonstrated that the efficacy outcomes obtained with 
KTE-X19 in the Phase 2 mITT analysis set and FAS continue to be better than reported outcomes obtained 
with current standard of care (SOC) therapies. Efficacy outcomes were numerically better in subjects 
who had received only 1 prior line of therapy compared with subjects who had received > 1 prior line of 
therapy  before  KTE-X19.  Furthermore,  subjects  who  had  received  an  allogeneic  stem  cell  transplant 
(allo-SCT) as well as SCT-naïve subjects greatly benefited from KTE-X19 irrespective of their previous 
transplant status, while the flexibility for treating physician remained should they consider a subsequent 
allo-SCT. Better efficacy outcomes were obtained with KTE-X19 in blinatumomab-naïve and inotuzumab-
naïve subjects, whereas a prior exposure to blinatumomab or inotuzumab suggests a potential reduction 
in  the  efficacy  of  KTE-X19.  However,  even  in  subjects  who  had  previously  been  treated  with 
blinatumomab or inotuzumab, KTE-X19 resulted in efficacy outcomes that were better than what have 
been reported for current SOC therapies. 
The updated SCHOLAR-3 analyses performed on the original ZUMA-3 mITT population and the expanded 
analyses  performed  on  the  FAS  were  consistent  with  the  outcomes  of  the  primary  analysis.  Clinically 
meaningful,  statistically  significant  improvements  in  overall  complete  remission  (OCR)  rate,  complete 
remission  (CR)  rate,  relapse-free  survival  (RFS),  and  overall  survival  (OS)  were  demonstrated  for 
KTE-X19  versus  subjects  receiving  SOC  therapies  in  historical  control  trials  matched  for  key  baseline

While CR rates in ZUMA-3 for subjects who had received > 1 prior line of therapy were lower than CR 
rates for subjects with only 1 prior line of therapy, CR rates of 51% in Phase 2 mITT analysis set, 38% 
in Phase 2 FAS, and 56% in the combined Phase 1 + Phase 2 analysis set for subjects who had received 
> 1 prior line of therapy were numerically higher than CR rate of 33.6% reported for blinatumomab in 
TOWER study and 35.8% reported for inotuzumab in INO-VATE study. 
In  addition,  the  data  also  suggest  superior  OS  for  subjects  who  received  KTE-X19  in  earlier  line  of 
therapy. The KM median OS was not reached among the 10 subjects in the mITT analysis set or among 
the 11 subjects in the FAS who had received only 1 line of prior therapy. Among the 45 subjects in the 
Phase 2  mITT  analysis  set  and  among  the  60 subjects  in  the  FAS  who  had  received  > 1  prior  line  of 
therapy,  the  KM  median  OS  was  25.4 months  (95% CI:  14.2 months,  NE)and  19.3 months  (95% CI: 
9.7 months,  NE)  respectively.  In  the  combined  Phase  1  +  Phase  2  analysis  set  comprising  a  total  of 
78 subjects who received the pivotal dose of 1.0 x 106 CAR T cells/kg body weight, the KM median OS 
was not reached (95% CI: 7.6 months, NE) among the 15 subjects who had received only 1 line of prior 
therapy;  among  the  63 subjects  who  had  received  > 1  prior  line  of  therapy,  the  KM  median  OS  was 
25.4 months (95% CI: 15.9 months, NE)  
The KM median OS values of 19 to 25 months obtained with KTE-X19 in ZUMA-3 among subjects who 
had received > 1 prior line of therapy are approximately 3-fold longer than the median OS of 7.7 months 
obtained with current SOC.

Out  of the  10  subjects  in Phase 2  mITT  analysis  set  who  had  received  only  1 prior line  of therapy,  4 
subjects had a primary refractory disease, 5 subjects had a first relapse with first remission lasting less 
than 12 months, and a total of 2 subjects had r/r disease after allo-SCT. After KTE-X19 infusion, 8 out 
of the 10 subjects achieved a CR, and 9 out of the 10 subjects achieved a CR/CRi. 
The data suggest that efficacy outcomes obtained with KTE-X19 in subjects who had received > 1 prior 
line  of  therapy  are  better  than  outcomes  obtained  with  current  SOC  therapies.  Furthermore,  efficacy 
outcomes were numerically better in subjects who had received only 1 prior line of therapy before KTE-
X19 infusion. Therefore, the applicant argues that subjects who have relapsed after only 1 treatment 
line should be included in KTE-X19 indication to provide the most optimal benefit-risk profile. This would 
be  consistent  with  the  subject  population  studied  in  ZUMA-3  where  18%  of  the  subjects  in  the  mITT 
analysis set, 15% in the FAS, and 19% in the combined Phase 1 + Phase 2 analysis set had received 
only 1 prior therapy. 
The ZUMA-3 results, demonstrating that subjects with fewer lines of therapy have better outcomes, are 
consistent  with  published  studies  reporting  that  with  each  relapse,  responses  to  subsequent  lines  of 
therapy deteriorate {Dombret 2019, Gokbuget 2016b, Kantarjian 2003, Kantarjian 2019, O'Brien 2013}. 
In order to provide further context for the relationship between efficacy outcomes and the number of 
prior  lines  of  therapy,  the  applicant  analyzed  baseline  characteristics  and  the  profile  of  treatment-
emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  between  these  2  subgroups  among  subjects  in  the  Phase 2  safety 
analysis set. 
Compared  with  the  subgroup  comprising  subjects  who  had  received  > 1  prior  line  of  therapy,  the 
subgroup  comprising  subjects  who  had  received  only  1  prior  line  of  therapy  had  more  subjects  with 
ECOG performance status of 0 (40% versus 27%); fewer subjects who had received prior blinatumomab, 
inotuzumab,  or  an  allo-SCT  (10%,  0%,  and  10%  versus  53%,  27%,  and  49%,  respectively);  fewer 
subjects with r/r disease after allo-SCT (20% versus 49%); more subjects with first remission lasting 
≤ 12 months (50% versus 24%); and subjects had a lower tumor burden (median percentage of blasts 
in bone marrow at baseline of 47.4% [range: 0, 73%] and no subject with an extramedullary disease at 
screening versus median percentage of blasts in bone marrow at baseline of 65.0% [range: 2, 98%] and 
13% of subjects with an extramedullary disease. Due to the imbalance regarding the number of subjects 
in these 2 subgroups (10 subjects who received 1 prior line versus 45 subjects who received > 1 prior 
line of therapy), these results should be interpreted with caution.

An  overall  summary  of  TEAEs  among  subjects  who  had  received  only  1  prior  line  of  therapy  versus 
subjects who had received > 1 prior line of therapy is presented for the Phase 2 safety analysis set in 
Table . The incidence of AEs and SAEs were generally similar (< 10% difference) between the subgroups. 
Due to the imbalance regarding the number of subjects in these 2 subgroups (10 subjects who received 
1 prior line versus 45 subjects who received > 1 prior line of therapy), these results should be interpreted

Responses in Subjects Who Received a Subsequent Allo-SCT After KTE-X19 Infusion 
The applicant would like to provide additional data to emphasize the importance of allowing both SCT-
naïve and subjects treated with a prior allo-SCT to receive KTE-X19. Prior exhaustion with an allo-SCT 
was not a mandatory inclusion criterion, and the majority of enrolled subjects in ZUMA-3 were allo-SCT-
naïve; only 39% of subjects in Phase 2 FAS and 42% of the treated subjects in Phase 2 mITT analysis 
set had received a prior allo-SCT. The percentage of subjects with prior allo-SCT in ZUMA-3 is similar to 
that of published studies in r/r ALL with blinatumomab and inotuzumab where 35% of the subjects in 
the TOWER study and 18% of the subjects in the INO-VATE study had prior allo-SCT (Error! Reference 
source not found.). 
Out of the 55 treated subjects, 11 (20%) in the ZUMA-3 mITT analysis set received an allo-SCT after 
KTE-X19 infusion; out of the 11 subjects, 10 (18%) had achieved a CR/CRi per central assessment. Out 
of  the  11 subjects  who  received  a  subsequent  allo-SCT,  1  subject  died  within  100  days,  and  the 
remaining subjects were in ongoing remission 100 days after allo-SCT. 
Among  the  10 subjects  who  achieved  a  CR/CRi  after  receiving  KTE-X19  infusion  and  who  received  a 
subsequent allo-SCT, KM median OS was not reached (95% CI: 7.6 months, NE), even with the longer 
follow-up than previously reported for the primary analysis. Among the 29 subjects in the mITT analysis 
set who achieved a CR/CRi after receiving KTE-X19 alone without subsequent allo-SCT, the KM median 
OS was 26.0 months (95% CI: 18.6 months, NE)

The percentage of subjects (20%) in ZUMA-3 who received KTE-X19 followed by a subsequent allo-SCT 
is  consistent  with  the  TOWER  study  where  24%  of  subjects  in  the  blinatumomab  arm  underwent  a 
subsequent allo-SCT. In contrast to the ZUMA-3 results, the mortality rate in the TOWER study was high 
following  blinatumomab  and  allo-SCT;  among  the  38  subjects  who  achieved  a  CR/CRi/CRh  to 
blinatumomab and underwent allo-SCT, 10 subjects (26%) died during a median follow-up period of 206 
days {Kantarjian 2017}. In the INO-VATE study, a substantially higher percentage of subjects proceeded 
to SCT after receiving inotuzumab; 48.2% of the subjects in the ITT population and 53.7% of subjects 
who achieved a CR/CRi. Among the subjects who proceeded to SCT after receiving inotuzumab, 67.1% 
of  the  subjects  died;  the  median  OS  for  subjects  treated  with  inotuzumab  followed  by  SCT  was  12.6 
months (95% CI: 9.3, 27.7 months) {Kantarjian 2019}. 
KTE-X19 Responses in SCT-naïve Versus SCT-pretreated Subjects

For subjects who had already received a prior allo-SCT versus SCT-naïve subjects, the current ZUMA-3 
data indicate that subjects greatly benefit from KTE-X19 irrespective of their previous transplant status. 
The already substantially improved outcomes achieved with KTE-X19 alone (median OS of 26.0 months) 
over current SOC (median OS of 7.7 months, can be further increased with a subsequent SCT (among 
subjects who achieved a CR/CRi after KTE-X19 infusion and received a subsequent allo-SCT, median OS 
was not reached.  
The results presented with the more mature data set and a longer median study follow-up of 20.5 months 
are consistent with the data previously reported for the primary analysis with a median study follow-up 
of 12.4 months. 
Thus, the applicant continues to recommend that subjects who are SCT naïve should also be eligible to 
receive KTE-X19. This is supported by ZUMA-3 data presented above and received by the applicant from 
healthcare providers representing real-world experience. Including allo-SCT naïve subjects in KTE-X19 
label would reflect the subject population studied in ZUMA-3 where 58% of the enrolled subjects had not 
received  a  prior  allo-SCT,  and  would  be  consistent  with  ZUMA-3  design,  which  allowed  the  use  of  a 
subsequent  allo-SCT  per  investigator’s  choice  for  the  studied  population,  as  outlined  in  the  ZUMA-3 
clinical  study  protocol  (Sections 7  and  10).  Restricting  the  indication  to  only  SCT-pretreated  subjects 
would limit the subsequent treatment options for those subjects who achieve a CR/CRi after KTE X19 
infusion; a second SCT, which is known to be associated with great risks and poor outcomes, if often not 
advised by current guidelines {Nagler 2019}. 
Regarding safety, overall summaries of TEAEs for SCT-naïve subjects and subjects who had received a 
prior allo-SCT are presented for the Phase 2 safety analysis set in Table  and for the combined Phase 
1 + Phase  2  safety  analysis  set,  comprising  subjects  treated  with  the  pivotal  dose,  in  Table 28.  The

Supportive study 
SCHOLAR-3 – A retrospective cohort study of adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-precursor 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia sampled from historical clinical trials (SCHOLAR-3) 
Design 
This is a non-interventional, retrospective cohort study utilizing data from the phase II ZUMA-3 
investigational trial into KTE-X19 and patient level data from historical clinical trials in relapsed or 
refractory adult B precursor ALL contained within the Medidata Enterprise Data Store (MEDS) 
database. 
Two matched cohorts were constructed to the ZUMA-3 trial, one in blin and ino naïve patients and one 
in blin experienced patients through the use of patient level data from trials selected from the 
Medidata MEDS database. 
Study selection 
Studies were selected through a literature search, with a search for all trials in the sub-indication of 
interest regardless of the availability of the trial to Medidata through data sharing agreements (Figure 
below). All trials in the indication and meeting basic project criteria were identified by searching across 
major trial repositories (NIH, clinicaltrials.gov, EudraCT and UMIN-CTR) and publication databases 
(PubMed, MEDLINE). 
Trials represented in the Figure below met the following basic requirements for this study: 
• 
• 
Targeted condition of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) 
Trial intervention contains therapies from one of the following comparator regimens: 
o  Blinatumomab 
o 
o  Standard of Care, defined here as HiDAC, FLAG, mitoxantrone, methotrexate or clofarabine 
Inotuzumab Ozogamicin 
regimens 
This search yielded 135 trials in the sub-indication of interest (Box A in Figure 1)  
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 74/119 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These studies were then narrowed according to the following scientific features of the trials or data 
that are required in order to address the research objective. (Box B) 
•  Relapsed / Refractory disease 
•  Adult population (enrolled patients aged >= 18 years) 
• 
And only studies were used in the end which were available through Medidata data sharding 
Trial intervention exact match to allowed comparator regimens 
agreement. 
Matching 
In order to create a matched cohort of patients to the phase II ZUMA-3 study a number of key 
considerations were made: 
• 
• 
• 
The ZUMA-3 trial contains patients who initiate therapy with KTE-X19 after various numbers of 
previous regimens. 
Patients in the ZUMA-3 trial are heterogeneous in terms of prognostic factors. 
The ZUMA-3 trial consists of patients who are both allogenic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) 
experienced and naïve. 
•  Some patients within the ZUMA-3 trial have been previously treated with the CD19 directed 
monoclonal antibody blinatumomab, prior to starting therapy with KTE-X19. 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 75/119 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
As there is evidence that prior treatment with blin may impact the efficacy of KTE-X19 due to CD19 
modulation (Taraseviciute et al, two matched comparator cohorts are proposed; one comprising of 
patients who have been previously naïve to blin and ino treatment, the second cohort will comprise 
only blin experienced patients. These cohorts were thought to emulate a “physicians’ choice” arm from 
a randomized trial with treatment exposures comprising of current standards of care (SOC).  
Firstly, for each cohort (blin experienced and naïve) patients from the superset of trials were 
characterized into the following treatment exposures to create a potential pool of matches for each 
patient in ZUMA-3: 
1. Patients who in the historical trial had previously failed an allo-SCT and been treated with either 
blin, ino or SOC chemotherapy; with or without a TKI dependent on Ph status. 
2. Patients who in the historical trial had not previously failed an allo-SCT and been treated with blin, 
ino or SOC chemotherapy; with or without a TKI dependent on Ph status. 
Each of these matching pools consisted of patients with varying previous lines of therapy, primary 
refractory status. age, sex, extra medullary disease status, Philadelphia chromosome status, ECOG 
performance status and varying percentage of bone marrow blasts. 
The phase II ZUMA-3 trial consists of 55 patients who were treated with KTEX19, a matching approach 
was applied to select controls. 
For the prognostic factors, line of therapy and prior allo-SCT, exact matching were used. For age, sex, 
ECOG performance status, Philadelphia chromosome status, percentage bone marrow blasts at 
baseline and extramedullary disease at baseline; propensity score matching was used. 
The propensity score was defined as the probability of patients being treated with KTE-X19 as a 
function of the above prognostic factors. It was derived using a multivariate model with a logit link 
function. 
The greedy nearest-neighbor matching without replacement algorithm was used with a fixed 1-to-1 
matching ratio which aligns with the commonly used 1:1 randomization ratio in clinical trials.  
Either 1:1 optimal matching or variable ratio matching, with a maximum of a 1:3 ratio was planned to 
be used. Patients were matched within a specified caliper distance of 0.25 and balance between the 
ZUMA-3 and matched study arms was assessed through standardized mean differences (SMD). 
Only baseline variables with limited or no missingness (e.g. < 15%) were included in the propensity 
score model. Missing values for baseline categorical variables were coded as an unknown category and 
can be used as a separate category or combined with one of the non-missing categories. Missing 
values for baseline continuous variables were imputed by a single regression imputation approach 
where the missing values were filled by predictions from regression models that are fitted using the 
mean and covariance matrix estimated by complete case analysis.

Analysis 
There is no formal hypothesis being tested as part of this study. Analyses were descriptive. 
The balance of prognostic factors was assessed through the use of standardized mean differences 
(SMD) between the two treatment arms. 
Fisher exact test was used to calculate rate difference, associated 95% confidence interval and p-
value. For the comparative analysis, logistic regression was used to estimate an odds ratio. 
The analysis was similar for other endpoints. 
Results 
Balance: 
Balance is presented by matched subcohort and in all matched patients. 
In SCA-2 9 patients were removed post-hoc, as it was discovered that they had protocol deviations.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This  application  for  extension  of  indication  of  Tecartus  to  include  adults  with  B-cell  precursor  acute 
lymphoblastic leucemia (ALL) is based on the ZUMA-3 trial, a single-arm open-label phase I/II clinical 
trial, and on a historical control (Scholar-3), a retrospective cohort study, sampled from 135 historical 
phase I to III clinical trials in r/r B-cell ALL (appr. 490 subjects), where patients have been treated with 
blinatumomab or inotuzumab as SOC.  
The pivotal part of the ZUMA-3 trial is the phase 2, where all subjects (n=55) had been treated with a 
target of 1 × 106 CAR-positive viable T cells per kg of body weight after completion of a conditioning 
chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2 on d-2, fludarabine 25 mg/m2 on d-4, d-3 and d-2).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The median age among the subjects in the pivotal phase 2 of the ZUMA-3 trial (mITT analysis set, n=55) 
was 40.0 years of age. The majority of patients had relapsed or refractory disease after 2 or more lines 
of therapy.  Subjects had a median of 2 lines of prior therapy (range: 1 to 8), 26 subjects (47%) had 
received 3 or more lines of prior therapy. Twenty-three subjects (42%) had previously received an allo-
SCT.  Twelve  subjects  (22%)  had  previously  received  inotuzumab,  twenty-five  subjects  (45%)  had 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 81/119 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
previously  received  blinatumomab.  Altogether  this  population  is  regarded  as  heterogenous  making 
subgroup analyses challenging and prone to spurious results. 
Per DCO, the median OCR (CR + CRi) rate per central assessment was 70.9% (n=39) for all patients 
followed for a median of 12.4 months. The CR rate was 56% (n=31), and the MRD- rate (assessed by 
central laboratory) was 76%. Among the 39 subjects who achieved CR or CRi, the KM median DOR was 
12.8 months. None of the additional sixteen subjects included in the full analysis set (FAS, n=71) had 
achieved CR or CRi at DCO, therefore, results of DOR in FAS and mITT were identical. With regard to 
DOR (median 14.6 months) it is noticeable that 14/34 patients have been censored due to allo-SCT or 
due to start of a new treatment.  
Overall the subgroup analyses for pertinent patient characteristics gave a consistent picture. The lowest 
response rates was observed in patients with the highest disease burden as defined by blast percentage 
in  the  bone  marrow.  Also  patients  with  prior  blinatumomab  therapy,  inotuzumab  therapy  or  both 
achieved relevant response rates albeit numerically lower than patients naïve to either or both of these 
treatments. 
Upon  request  additional  data  have  been  submitted  for  23  subjects  from  ZUMA-3  phase  1,  centrally 
assessed and treated with the pivotal dose of KTE-X19 with a recent DCO (23 July 2021), leading to a 
median follow-up of 20.5 months. Results for OCR (CR/CRi; 95% CI) in the updated analysis set Ph2 
+Ph1 pivotal dose (n=78) were 73.1%. The MRD negative overall rate among OCR (CR/CRi; 95% CI) 
was 79%. These results support the primary analyses.

The SAG-Oncology was consulted on 24 June 2022 to clarify the medical need for treatment options for 
adult patients, or subgroups of patients with r/r B-cell precursor ALL and to reflect on an appropriate 
positioning (if any) in the therapeutic armamentarium.  
The following questions were asked to the SAG: 
1. 
Is there a medical need for further treatment options in the indication relapsed/refractory B-
cell precursor ALL in adults?  
2. 
Can specific subgroups of patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor adult ALL be 
identified that are currently not sufficiently treated with available treatment options also considering 
disease characteristics (resistant mutations, genomic alterations etc.)? 
3. 
Besponsa and Blincyto are authorised in the indication relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor ALL 
in adults. Are there specific subgroups of patients where these authorized options are not appropriate 
for reasons such as the safety profile of the products or patient characteristics (e.g. co-morbidities)? 
4. 
Would Tecartus be a treatment alternative in relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor adult ALL 
considering the strength of the evidence for Tecartus (derived from SAT, ORR) and for other treatment 
options /derived from RCT, OS)? 
5. 
How would you judge the importance of Tecartus as a possible bridging to transplant and/or 
alternative to authorized products in the indication relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor adult ALL? 
6. 
What type of data would be required to further characterize the remaining uncertainties 
regarding efficacy in the 2L or 3L+ population, respectively? 
The outcome of the SAG is summarized below: 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 82/119 
 
  
 
 
1. Is there a medical need for further treatment options in the indication relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-
cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in adults?  
The SAG agreed unanimously that there is a high unmet medical need in r/r B-cell precursor ALL, 
since, despite available treatments (including monoclonal antibodies blinatumomab and inotuzumab) 
the prognosis is dismal, with high degree of relapse, non-responder patients and with low PFS and low 
survival rates. 
2. Can specific subgroups of patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor ALL be identified that 
are currently not sufficiently treated with available treatment options also considering disease 
characteristics (resistant mutations, genomic alterations etc.)? 
Due to the fact that the evidence presented for Tecartus in r/r B-cell precursor ALL is based on a small 
single arm phase 2 trial with a limited number of patients, the experts cannot identify any subgroups 
who are not sufficiently treated with available options.   
There aren’t any satisfactory treatments for R/R B-cell precursor ALL patients as a whole. Groups with 
the highest need include elderly patients, Philadelphia chromosome-negative (PH-), minimal residual 
disease positive (MRD+) and those ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) or those 
that have relapsed following alloSCT. The experts agreed that it is highly unlikely that these patients 
are salvaged by the current available treatments. Therefore, treating physicians need flexibility to 
select different optional treatments.  
3. Besponsa and Blincyto are authorised in the indication r/r B-cell precursor ALL in adults. Are there 
specific subgroups of patients where these authorized options are not appropriate for reasons such as 
the safety profile of the products or patient characteristics (e.g. co-morbidities)? 
The experts flagged that the landscape in ALL treatment is evolving, as Besponsa and Blincyto are 
moving forward in the line of treatment, leaving fewer alternatives in later lines of treatment.  
There are no specific criteria which would render patients ineligible to Besponsa and Blincyto even 
though treatment duration may be limited due to liver function or occurrence of veno-occlusive disease 
(VOD). There might be severe adverse events (AEs), such as liver toxicity with inotuzumab, or pre-
existing co-morbidities, in which cases certain treatments cannot be used and CAR-T cells might be 
preferred. However, the experts cannot define a treatment sequence for the different alternatives in 
ALL.  
The experts agreed that the indication for Tecartus in r/r B-cell precursor ALL should reflect the 
population of patients with a positive balance of benefits and risks with the CAR-T treatment and not 
the unsuitability to other treatments. A broad indication would maximise the ability of physicians and 
patients to consider for which patients this treatment would be preferred. In addition, a broad 
indication would allow to collect more extensive and meaningful real-world data (RWD).  
4. Would Tecartus be a treatment alternative in relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor ALL considering 
the strength of the evidence for Tecartus (derived from SAT, ORR) and for other treatment options 
(derived from RCT, OS)? 
The SAG agreed that, despite the limited data, Tecartus can be a treatment alternative in r/r B-cell 
precursor ALL. However, the experts found that there is not enough evidence to define any optimal 
sequence and in which subpopulation Tecartus would be preferred.  
5. How would you judge the importance of Tecartus as a possible bridge to transplant and/or as 
alternative to authorized products in the indication r/r B-cell precursor adult ALL? 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 83/119 
 
  
 
 
Based on the high responses and high MRD negativity achieved with Tecartus, it is reasonable to 
expect that it is a good candidate for bridging therapy to transplantation, taking into account all 
limitations (e.g. the trial’s small patient group). Tecartus can also be used as an alternative to 
authorized products in the same indication. 
6. What type of data would be required to further characterize the remaining uncertainties regarding 
efficacy in the 2L or 3L+ population, respectively? 
Data presented for Tecartus is sparse and lots of questions remain. The experts agreed that, ideally, a 
confirmatory RCT should be performed comparing Tecartus with actually available treatments. The 
experts acknowledge the difficulties to perform such a study, especially taking into account that the 
monoclonal antibodies are moving forward in the line of treatment in ALL. 
The experts agreed that patients should be included in a post-authorization registry to better 
characterize efficacy and safety aspects and patient reported outcomes (PROs).  
In particular, more data on the safety of Tecartus in this indication, more data in the elderly population 
who are not eligible to ASCT and on PH - patients and MRD - patients that cannot be transplanted 
would be very valuable. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
In order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in adult patients with r/r ALL, the 
MAH shall submit follow-up results of the ZUMA-3 clinical study (Part 1 and Part 2). 
In order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in adult patients with r/r ALL, the 
MAH should conduct and submit the results of a prospective, observational study based on data from a 
registry, according to an agreed protocol. 
These post authorisation studies should provide longer term data as well as further efficacy and safety 
information on important subgroups (age groups from 18 to 25 years of age and older than 60 years, 
status MRD+ and PH-, patients that have relapsed following allo-SCT), which are not fully represented 
in the pivotal study submitted for this procedure. The provision of this data post authorisation will 
complement the dossier in order to have a comprehensive understanding of efficacy and safety and to 
confirm the positive benefit risk balance of the product in the new indication. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based  on  the  submitted  data  and  the  recent  update  encompassing  78  patients,  efficacy  has  been 
demonstrated in the ZUMA-3 trial. The included patient population is small and heterogeneous, however, 
subgroup analyses give a fairly consistent picture regardless of prior therapies. There is an indication for 
lower efficacy in patients with high disease burden (high blast percentage in the bone marrow), requiring 
further investigation in registry studies as a part of the conditional approval.  
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The important identified risks and the potential risks identified for KTE-X19 are similar to the AEs 
identified for this product class. No further risks and AEs could be identified which would be specific for 
KTE-X19 or for the MCL indication to be treated with KTE-X19. The important identified risks are CRS, 
neurotoxicity, cytopenias, infections, hypogammaglobulinemia. 
The safety data for this extension to indication are based on the pivotal Phase 2 of ZUMA-3 trial, which 
is evaluating KTE-X19 for the treatment of adult subjects with r/r B-ALL. Additional safety data are 
provided from 4 studies of KTE-X19 in subjects with r/r MCL (ZUMA-2 and ZUMA-18, pooled as MCL), 
r/r pediatric and adolescent ALL (ZUMA-4), and r/r CLL (ZUMA-8). 
Patient exposure 
Exposure to Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy 
In the main, ZUMA-3 study 71 patients were leukapheresed, and 55 patients were treated. All 
55 subjects in Phase 2 safety analysis set received the planned total body-surface-area-adjusted dose 
of cyclophosphamide (900 mg/m2). Subjects received a median total body-surface-area-adjusted dose 
of fludarabine of 75 mg/m2 (range: 71 to 75 mg/m2); all 55 subjects received within 10% of the 
planned total dose.  
Table 35. Exposure to Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy in Study ZUMA-3 (Phase 2, Safety Analysis 
Set)
According to the MAH, six patients did not receive KTE-X19 due to manufacturing failure. Eight other 
patients were not treated, primarily due to AEs following leukapheresis. Two patients who underwent 
leukapheresis and received lymphodepleting chemotherapy were not treated with KTE-X19; one 
patient experienced bacteremia and neutropenic fever and the other patient did not meet eligibility 
criteria after lymphodepleting chemotherapy.  
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 85/119 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In Phase 2, a total of 71 subjects were enrolled (ie, underwent leukapheresis); of these, 57 subjects 
(80%) received lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Fourteen subjects received neither lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy nor KTE-X19 after leukapheresis: 
(I) Seven subjects were not treated due to AEs: 
- One subject experienced various AEs following leukapheresis, including tumor lysis syndrome, lung 
infection, urinary tract infection, and sepsis. The subject died of sepsis, which was considered related 
to bridging therapy, before they could be treated with KTE-X19. 
- One subject’s product was not successfully manufactured from the initial leukapheresis material. 
Following the second leukapheresis, the subject developed a lung infection and respiratory failure and 
died of PD before they could be treated with KTE-X19. 
- One subject’s product was not successfully manufactured from the initial leukapheresis material. The 
subject developed fungal pneumonia and sepsis shortly after leukapheresis and ultimately died of PD 
without undergoing a second leukapheresis. 
- One subject experienced an AE of deep vein thrombosis following leukapheresis, rendering this 
subject ineligible for the study. This subject was later determined to have had symptomatic deep vein 
thrombosis at the time of screening. 
- One subject experienced various AEs following leukapheresis, including splenic rupture, neutropenic 
sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, and encephalopathy. The subject then died of cardiac arrest before they 
could be treated with KTE-X19. 
- One subject experienced various AEs following leukapheresis, including Clostridium difficile infection, 
septic shock, colitis infection, and myositis. The subject was removed from study per the investigator’s 
decision. 
- One subject developed a hemiparesis due to air embolism following leukapheresis, rendering this 
subject ineligible for the study. The subject was subsequently treated under a compassionate use 
protocol. 
(II) Three subjects were identified as not meeting eligibility criteria after leukapheresis: 
- Two subjects were found to have CD19− blasts (both subjects had received prior blinatumomab). For 
1 of these subjects, product was not successfully manufactured from the initial leukapheresis material. 
- One subject was found to have < 5% blasts. 
(III) Four subjects were not treated due to manufacturing failures: 
- One subject’s product was not successfully manufactured from the initial leukapheresis material. The 
subject developed a lung infection after leukapheresis and consequently was unable to undergo a 
second leukapheresis (reported as “product not available”). 
- One subject’s product was not successfully manufactured from the initial leukapheresis material. 
Further leukapheresis attempts were delayed as the subject had developed febrile neutropenia after 
leukapheresis. The subject then partially withdrew consent from the study (which is the reason listed 
for this subject not having been treated) and died of febrile neutropenia in hospice care. 
- One subject’s product was not successfully manufactured from 3 sets of leukapheresis material. 
Further leukapheresis attempts were deferred indefinitely as the subject experienced clinical 
deterioration (reported as “other”) and subsequently died of PD. 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 86/119 
 
  
 
 
 
- One subject’s product was not successfully manufactured from the initial leukapheresis material. A 
second leukapheresis was not attempted per the primary oncologist’s decision that the subject was not 
clinically stable to proceed with CAR T-cell therapy (reported as “other”). 
Of the 57 subjects who received lymphodepleting chemotherapy, 55 subjects received KTE-X19. Two 
subjects were not treated with KTE-X19 after receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy: 1 subject 
experienced AEs of bacteremia and neutropenic fever that precluded further treatment, and 1 subject 
deteriorated after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and no longer met eligibility criteria (the subject 
experienced fulminant progression of extramedullary disease and spinal cord compression, leading to 
ECOG performance status > 1). 
Exposure to KTE-X19 
In Phase 2, the median weight-adjusted dose of KTE-X19 was 1.0 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg 
(range: 0.5 x 106 to 1.0 x 106 cells/kg). The median total number of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in the KTE-
X19 infusion was 75.7 x 106 cells (range: 39.3 x 106 to 101.0 x 106 cells), and the median total 
number of T cells infused was 128.4 x 106 cells (range: 65.5 x 106 to 277.8 x 106 cells).

Among the 55 subjects who received KTE-X19 in Phase 2, the median age was 40.0 years (range: 19 
to 84 years), and 8 subjects (15%) were ≥ 65 years of age. Thirty-three subjects (60%) were male, 
and the majority was White (37 subjects, 67%).

Table 38. Demographics in Study ZUMA-3 (Phase 2, Safety Analysis Set) 
Among the 55 subjects treated with KTE-X19 in Phase 2, 18 subjects (33%) had primary refractory 
disease, 43 subjects (78%) had r/r disease after 2 or more lines of therapy, and 16 subjects (29%) 
had first relapse with first remission ≤ 12 months. Subjects had a median of 2 prior lines of therapy 
(range: 1 to 8 prior lines), and 26 subjects (47%) had received 3 or more lines of therapy. Twenty-
three subjects (42%) had previously received an allo-SCT, and 12 subjects (22%) had previously 
received inotuzumab. Twenty-five subjects (45%) had previously received blinatumomab, and 12 
subjects (22%) had received blinatumomab as the last prior therapy. Fifteen subjects (27%) were Ph+. 
The median blast percentage in bone marrow at screening was 65.0% (range: 5.01% to 100%), and 
the median blast percentage at baseline (ie, the last assessment before lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy) was 60.0% (range: 0% to 98%). Forty subjects (73%) had a high disease burden 
(> 25% blasts) at baseline. Six subjects (11%) had extramedullary disease at screening

Adverse events 
TEAEs were defined as AEs with an onset on or after the infusion of KTE-X19. AEs that occurred after 
retreatment are not included in this summary. The severity of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs), 
with the exception of CRS, were graded by the investigator using the NCI CTCAE version 4.03. The 
severity of CRS was to be graded at the syndrome level according to a modification of the grading 
system proposed by Lee and colleagues {Lee 2014}. In the tables, CRS as a syndrome is not included 
as an AE preferred term (PT) and is reported separately. Also, CRS symptoms are presented twice, 
once in tables of AEs by PTs and once in tables of CRS and CRS symptoms. AEs were coded with the 
MedDRA version 23.0.  
Among the 55 subjects treated in Phase 2, all subjects had at least 1 AE, 52 subjects (95%) had worst 
Grade 3 or higher AEs, and 41 subjects (75%) had SAEs. A total of 49 subjects (89%) had CRS, and 
13 subjects (24%) had worst Grade 3 or higher CRS. No subject had Grade 5 CRS. Thirty-
three subjects (60%) had at least 1 neurologic AE; 14 subjects (25%) had worst Grade 3 or higher 
neurologic AEs, and 14 subjects (25%) had serious neurologic AEs. One subject had a Grade 5 
neurologic AE of brain herniation. As of the data cutoff date, 10 subjects (18%) in Phase 2 had died 
due to AEs, including 4 subjects (7%) who died due to disease progression within 3 months after the 
KTE-X19 infusion (reported as Grade 5 ALL) and 6 subjects (11%) who died due to AEs other than 
disease progression.

In Phase 2, the most common AEs by system organ class (SOC) were general disorders and 
administration site conditions (54 subjects, 98%), vascular disorders (42 subjects, 76%), and blood 
and lymphatic system disorders (41 subjects, 75%). The most common AEs by PT were pyrexia 
(52 subjects, 95%), hypotension (37 subjects, 67%), and anemia (29 subjects, 53%). The most 
common worst Grade 3 or higher AEs were anemia (27 subjects, 49%), pyrexia (20 subjects, 36%), 
and platelet count decreased (17 subjects, 31%).  
The most common KTE-X19-related AEs of any grade were pyrexia (46 subjects, 84%), hypotension 
(34 subjects, 62%), and sinus tachycardia (19 subjects, 35%). The most common KTE-X19-related 
AEs that were worst Grade 3 or higher were pyrexia (20 subjects, 36%), hypotension (16 subjects, 
29%), and hypoxia (11 subjects, 20%).  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
In Phase 2, the median potential follow-up time from the KTE-X19 infusion was 16.4 months (range: 
10.3 to 22.1). Twenty of 55 subjects (36%) had died as of the data cutoff date. Brief descriptions are 
as follows: 
Thirteen subjects died due to PD. 
Six subjects died due to AEs other than Grade 5 ALL:  
  One subject died on Day 8 due to a neurologic AE of brain herniation that was deemed related 
to KTE-X19. 
  One subject died on Day 18 due to septic shock that was deemed related to lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy and KTE-X19. 
  One subject died on Day 15 due to pneumonia that was deemed unrelated to KTE-X19. 
  One subject died on Day 46 due to fungal pneumonia that was deemed unrelated to KTE-X19. 
This subject relapsed on Day 4 and received another anticancer therapy (inotuzumab from Day 
10 to Day 39) prior to this fatal event. 
  One subject died on Day 72 due to sepsis that was deemed unrelated to KTE-X19. This subject 
did not respond to KTE-X19 as of Day 16 and started another anticancer therapy 
(hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating 
with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine from Day 22 to Day 32) prior to this fatal event. 
  One subject died on Day 491 due to respiratory failure that was deemed unrelated to KTE-X19. 
This subject relapsed on Day 314 after an initial response to KTE-X19 and had received 2 
subsequent lines of therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 
One subject died on Day 231 due to hemorrhagic shock secondary to a gastrointestinal bleed and 
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, which were deemed as related to the underlying B-ALL. The 
cause of death was reported as “other.” 
Of the 20 subjects in Phase 2 who died, 4 subjects died within 30 days after the KTE-X19 infusion, 
5 subjects died between 30 days and 3 months after the infusion, and 11 subjects died more than 
3 months after the infusion.

Table 41. Deaths, Including Cause of Death in Study ZUMA-3 (Phase 2, Safety Analysis Set)
Serious adverse events 
In Phase 2, the most common SAEs were hypotension (16 subjects, 29%), pyrexia (15 subjects, 
27%), and hypoxia (7 subjects, 13%). The most common worst Grade 3 or higher SAEs were 
hypotension (13 subjects, 24%), hypoxia (7 subjects, 13%), and pyrexia (6 subjects, 11%). 
SAEs that occurred in ≥ 2 subjects and were deemed related to KTE-X19: thirty-four subjects (62%) 
had at least 1 SAE related to KTE-X19, the most frequently reported of which were hypotension 
(16 subjects, 29%), pyrexia (14 subjects, 25%), and hypoxia (7 subjects, 13%). The most common 
worst Grade 3 or higher SAEs related to KTE-X19 were hypotension (13 subjects, 24%), hypoxia 
(7 subjects, 13%) and pyrexia (6 subjects, 11%). 
Important identified risks 
CRS 
In Phase 2, 49 subjects (89%) had CRS, and 13 subjects (24%) had CRS that was worst Grade 3 or 
higher. No subject had Grade 5 CRS. 
Table 42. Subject incidence of CRS in Study Zuma-3 (Phase 2, Safety Analysis Set, N=55) 
Among 49 subjects with CRS, the most common CRS symptoms of any grade were pyrexia 
(46 subjects, 94%), hypotension (33 subjects, 67%), and sinus tachycardia (18 subjects, 37%). The 
most common worst Grade 3 or higher CRS symptoms were pyrexia (19 subjects, 39%), hypotension 
(16 subjects, 33%), and hypoxia (11 subjects, 22%). Similarly, the most common serious CRS 
symptoms of any grade were hypotension (16 subjects, 29%), pyrexia (14 subjects, 25%), and 
hypoxia (7 subjects, 13%). 
Among subjects who had CRS, the median time to onset was 5.0 days (range: 1 to 12 days) after KTE-
X19 infusion. As of the data cutoff date, CRS had resolved in 46 of 49 subjects. For the remaining 
3 subjects, CRS was ongoing at the time of death due to PD on Day 21 in 1 subject, brain herniation 
on Day 8 in 1 subject, and pneumonia on Day 15 in 1 subject. For subjects whose CRS had resolved, 
the median duration of CRS was 7.5 days (range: 2 to 48 days). Two subjects had CRS with a total 
duration > 28 days: 1 subject had CRS for 30 days with a prolonged CRS symptom of Grade 2 
nonserious nausea for 30 days, and 1 subject had CRS for 48 days with a prolonged CRS symptom of 
Grade 1 nonserious increased C-reactive protein for 47.

Neurologic Adverse Events Including Cerebral Edema 
In Phase 2, 33 subjects (60%) had at least 1 neurologic AE of any grade, including 14 subjects (25%) 
with worst Grade 3 or higher neurologic AEs. One subject had a Grade 5 neurologic AE of brain 
herniation. The most common neurologic AEs of any grade were tremor (15 subjects, 27%), 
confusional state (14 subjects, 25%), and encephalopathy (12 subjects, 22%). The most common 
worst Grade 3 or higher neurologic AEs were aphasia (5 subjects, 9%), encephalopathy (4 subjects, 
7%), and confusional state, agitation, seizure, and paraparesis (2 subjects each, 4%). 
Fourteen subjects (25%) had serious neurologic AEs of any grade, including 11 subjects (20%) with 
worst Grade 3 or higher serious neurologic AEs. The most common serious neurologic AEs of any grade 
were encephalopathy (4 subjects, 7%) and aphasia, confusional state, and seizure (3 subjects each, 
5%). 
Among subjects who had neurologic AEs, the median time to onset was 9.0 days (range: 2 to 16 days) 
after KTE-X19 infusion. As of the cutoff date, neurologic AEs had resolved in 29 of 33 subjects.  
The duration of neurologic AEs for each subject was calculated as the last date of resolution for all 
qualifying neurologic AEs – the date of first onset of all qualifying neurologic AEs + 1. Among the 
29 subjects whose neurologic AEs had resolved, the median duration of neurologic AEs was 7.0 days 
(range: 1 to 75 days).  
Four subjects had unresolved neurologic AEs either at the data cutoff date or at the time of death: 
One subject had Grade 4 serious encephalopathy, Grade 3 nonserious agitation, and Grade 1 
nonserious confusion, which all started on Day 5; Grade 4 serious cerebral edema, which started on 
Day 6; and a fatal event of Grade 5 serious cerebral herniation on Day 8. All events were ongoing at 
the time of death and were deemed related to KTE-X19. 
One subject had Grade 3 serious paralysis of the lower extremity, which started on Day 10 and was 
ongoing at the time of death due to PD on Day 553. The event was deemed related to KTE-X19. 
One subject had Grade 3 serious paraparesis, which started on Day 9 and was ongoing at the time of 
death due to PD on Day 483. The event was deemed unrelated to KTE-X19. This subject had a history 
of bilateral lower extremity weakness, and spinal imaging performed after the onset of paraparesis 
demonstrated degenerative changes. 
One subject had Grade 1 nonserious finger numbness, which started on Day 29 and was ongoing as of 
the data cutoff date. The event was deemed unrelated to KTE-X19.

Cytopenias 
Twenty-seven subjects (49%) in Phase 2 had thrombocytopenia of any grade, including 24 subjects 
(44%) with worst Grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia. Twenty-seven subjects (49%) had 
neutropenia, all of which were worst Grade 3 or higher. Twenty-nine subjects (53%) had anemia of 
any grade, including 27 subjects (49%) with worst Grade 3 or higher anemia.

The number of subjects who had worst Grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or anemia 
that was present on or after Day 30 following the KTE-X19 infusion on Day 0 were 10 subjects (18%), 
14 subjects (25%), and 4 subjects (7%), respectively.  
Infections 
Within the SOC of infections and infestations, 22 subjects (40%) in Phase 2 had AEs of any grade, and 
14 subjects (25%) had AEs that were worst Grade 3 or higher. Four subjects (7%) had Grade 5 
infections.  The most common PT within this SOC was pneumonia (4 subjects, 7%); all other infections 
were reported in ≤ 2 subjects each.  
Six subjects (11%) had bacterial infections of any grade, including 2 subjects (4%) with worst Grade 3 
or higher bacterial infections. No subject had a Grade 5 bacterial infection. All bacterial infections were 
reported in 1 subject each.  
Two subjects (4%) had viral infections, both of which were worst Grade 3. Four subjects (7%) had 
opportunistic infections, all of which were worst Grade 3 or higher. One subject (2%) had Grade 5 
fungal pneumonia.  
Fifteen subjects (27%) had unspecified pathogen infections, including 11 subjects (20%) with worst 
Grade 3 or higher infections. Three subjects (5%) had Grade 5 events (1 subject each with 
pneumonia, sepsis, and septic shock). The most common infections of any grade in this category were 
pneumonia (4 subjects, 7%) and bacteremia, sepsis, septic shock, and upper respiratory tract infection 
(2 subjects each, 4%); the remaining infections were reported in 1 subject each.  
Hypogammaglobulinemia 
In Phase 2, 4 subjects (7%) had hypogammaglobulinemia, all of which were worst Grade 1 or worst 
Grade 2 (2 subjects each, 4%).  
Important Potential Risks 
Secondary malignancies 
The clinical database was reviewed for potential secondary malignancies by searching for AEs with 
MedDRA preferred terms in the SOC of neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified (including cysts 
and polyps).  No new malignancies attributable to KTE-X19 have been found.   Of particular note, prior 
chemotherapy confounded cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia 
(AML) where these have occurred. There is a significant latency between chemotherapy exposure and 
the appearance of treatment-related MDS or AML.  
Immunogenicity 
Subjects were tested for serum antibodies reactive to the anti-CD19 CAR. 
In Phase 2, based on the initial screening enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 3 subjects 
(5%) were antibody-positive at baseline, and 1 subject (2%) was antibody negative at baseline and 
antibody-positive at Day 28 after the KTE-X19 infusion. Samples from all 4 subjects were further 
assessed with a confirmatory cell-based flow cytometry assay. Results of the confirmatory assay 
demonstrated that all 4 subjects were antibody-negative at all time points tested. 
In addition, based on the initial screening ELISA, 1 subject had a positive antibody result at Day 24 
after retreatment with KTE-X19. Confirmatory results for this subject are not yet available. 
Replication- competent Retrovirus 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 97/119 
 
  
 
 
Of the 53 subjects in Phase 2 who had an evaluable sample for replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) 
testing at any time point, none were positive for RCR.  
Tumor lysis syndrome 
The clinical database was reviewed for cases of tumor lysis syndrome by using the MedDRA SMQ 
(narrow) for tumor lysis syndrome. 
One subject in Phase 2 had Grade 3 nonserious tumor lysis syndrome, which was assessed as related 
to KTE-X19. The event started on Day 9 and resolved on Day 36. The tumor lysis syndrome occurred 
concurrently with evolving Grade 1, 2, and 4 CRS, which started on Day 5 and resolved on Day 28. 
Aggravation of Graft-versus-host Disease 
One subject (2%) who had undergone allo-SCT prior to enrollment in ZUMA-3 experienced worst 
Grade 2 GVHD. This subject had nonserious graft-versus-host syndrome that was assessed as related 
to KTE-X19. The event started as Grade 1 GVHD on Day 39, worsened to Grade 2 on Day 47, and was 
ongoing as of the data cutoff date.

Neurologic adverse events including cerebral edema 
In the combined studies ZUMA-2 and ZUMA-18 (adult MCL), 70 subjects (68%) had at least 
1 neurologic AE of any grade, and 33 subjects (32%) had a worst Grade 3 or higher neurologic AE. 
Nine subjects (9%) had a neurologic AE of Grade 4 and none had a neurologic AE of Grade 5. The most 
common neurologic AE of any grade were tremor (35 subjects, 34%), confusional state (29 subjects, 
28%), and encephalopathy (28 subjects, 27%). The most common worst Grade 3 or higher neurologic 
AEs were encephalopathy (17 subjects, 17%), confusional state (12 subjects, 12%), and aphasia

1 to 262 days). Twelve subjects had unresolved neurologic AEs either at the data cutoff date or at the 
time of death.  
Among subjects for whom neurologic AEs resolved, the median event duration was 12 days (range: 1 
to 567 days, duration was calculated from the end date of the last event minus the onset date of the 
first event+1). The wide range was a result of a subject who experienced neurologic AEs starting on 
Study Day 5: Grade 3 serious aphasia and Grade 3 serious encephalopathy from Study Day 5 to 12, 
Grade 2 cognitive disorder from Study Day 13 to 16, Grade 1 confusional state from Study Day 17 to 
58, Grade 3 serious confusional state from Study Day 59 to 72, Grade 1 agitation from Study Day 60 
to 70, and memory impairment from Study Day 553 to 571. The last neurologic AE for this subject 
resolved on Study Day 572, but there were intermittent periods where no neurologic AE was recorded.  
A total of 33 subjects (32%) had a serious neurologic AE and 27 subjects (26%) had a worst Grade 3 
or higher neurologic AE. The most frequently reported serious neurologic AE as well as the worst Grade 
3 or higher serious neurologic AE was encephalopathy (17 subjects, 17% and 16 subjects, 16%, 
respectively ), confusional state (8 subjects, 8% and 7 subjects, 7%), and aphasia (4 subjects, 4% for 
both categories). 
In ZUMA-4 (adolescent/pediatric ALL), 23 subjects (64%) had at least 1 neurologic AE of any grade, 
and 7 subjects (19%) had a worst Grade 3 or higher neurologic AE. Three subjects (8%) had a

than 1 subject were encephalopathy (3 subjects, 8%) and brain oedema (2 subjects, 6%).  
Among the 23 subjects who had neurologic AEs, the median time to onset was 10 days (range: 
3 to 60 days). Two subjects had unresolved neurologic AEs (Grade 2 agitation, and Grade 2 dysphasia 
and encephalopathy) at the time of death. 
Among subjects for whom neurologic AEs resolved, the median event duration was 5 days (range: 1 to 
88 days).  
A total of 13 subjects (36%) had serious neurologic AEs and 7 subjects (19%) had a worst Grade 3 or 
higher neurologic AE. The most frequently reported serious neurologic AEs were encephalopathy and 
confusional state (each in 5 subjects, 14%), and seizure (3 subjects, 8%). The only worst Grade 3 or 
higher neurologic AEs that occurred in more than 1 subject were encephalopathy (3 subjects, 8%) and 
brain oedema (2 subjects, 6%). 
In ZUMA-8 (adult CLL), 7 subjects (78%) had at least 1 neurologic AE of any grade, and 
1 subject (11%) had a worst Grade 3 neurologic AE (confusional state). No subject had a neurologic 
AE of Grade 4 or Grade 5. The most common neurologic AE of any grade were confusional state 
(3 subjects, 33%) and tremor and cognitive disorder (both in 2 subjects, 22%). Only 1 subject had a 
worst Grade 3 or higher neurologic AE (one event of confusional state).

Among the 7 subjects who had neurologic AEs, the median time to onset was 14 days (range: 
3 to 28 days). One subject had an unresolved neurologic AE (Grade 1 amnesia) at the time of death.  
Among subjects for whom neurologic AEs resolved, the median event duration was 12 days (range: 3 
to 129 days).

Laboratory findings 
The most common increased laboratory values observed in Phase 2 were creatinine (48 subjects, 
87%), glucose (47 subjects, 85%), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (43 subjects, 78%). The 
most common worst Grade 3 or higher increased laboratory values were alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) (17 subjects, 31%), AST (14 subjects, 25%), and glucose (13 subjects, 24%). 
All 55 subjects in Phase 2 had decreases in hemoglobin, leukocytes, and calcium. The other most 
common decreased laboratory values were platelets (54 subjects, 98%), lymphocytes and neutrophils 
(53 subjects each, 96%), and albumin and phosphate (52 subjects each, 95%). The most common 
worst Grade 3 or higher decreased laboratory values were leukocytes (54 subjects, 98%), neutrophils 
(53 subjects, 96%), and lymphocytes (52 subjects, 95%). 
Thirteen subjects met initial laboratory criteria for potential cases of Hy’s law (6 subjects in Phase 2). 
Upon clinical review, however, an alternate explanation for the liver dysfunction was found for all 
13 subjects. Thus, no subject was considered to have met criteria for Hy’s law. 
Safety in special populations 
Age Category 
The majority of subjects were < 65 years old, which limits the interpretation of these results.  
Compared with subjects who were < 65 years old (N = 47), subjects who were ≥ 65 years old (N = 8) 
showed a numerically higher incidence of worst Grade 3 or higher KTE-X19-related AEs (100% versus 
87%), CRS (100% versus 87%), worst Grade 3 or higher CRS (38% versus 21%), neutropenia (75% 
versus 45%), and hypogammaglobulinemia (25% versus 4%). Subjects who were < 65 years old 
showed a numerically higher incidence of SAEs (77% versus 63%), worst Grade 3 or higher SAEs 
(74% versus 63%), serious neurologic AEs (28% versus 13%), thrombocytopenia (51% versus 38%), 
anemia (55% versus 38%), and infections (40% versus 13%). 
Sex 
In Phase 2, compared with males (N = 33), females (N = 22) showed a numerically higher incidence of 
worst Grade 3 or higher KTE-X19-related SAEs (64% vs 52%), thrombocytopenia (59% vs 42%), 
worst Grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia (50% vs 39%), anemia (59% vs 48%), and worst Grade 3 
or higher anemia (55% vs 45%).  
Males showed a numerically higher incidence of KTE-X19-related AEs (100% versus 82%), worst 
Grade 3 or higher KTE-X19-related AEs (94% versus 82%), CRS (94% versus 82%), serious 
neurologic AEs (30% versus 18%), worst Grade 3 or higher serious neurologic AEs (27% versus 9%), 
neutropenia (55% versus 41%), and worst Grade 3 or higher neutropenia (55% versus 41%). 
Association of blast percentage in bone marrow with key safety outcomes 
A numerically higher incidence of Grade 3 or higher CRS was observed among subjects in the highest 
interval of blast percentage (> 75% to 100% blasts) at screening (41%; 9 of 22 subjects) or baseline 
(37%; 7 of 19 subjects), compared with the incidence of 24% in the overall population. However, no 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 103/119 
 
  
 
 
monotonic relationship was observed between the incidence of Grade 3 or higher neurologic AEs and 
blast percentage at screening or baseline. 
Association of extramedullary disease with key safety outcomes 
Compared to subjects who did not have extramedullary disease at screening, subjects with 
extramedullary disease at screening had a numerically higher incidence of Grade 3 or higher CRS (33% 
[2 of 6 subjects] vs 22% [11 of 49 subjects]) and Grade 3 or higher neurologic AEs (33% [2 of 
6 subjects] vs 24% [12 of 49 subjects]). However, due to the small number of subjects with 
extramedullary disease at screening, these results should be interpreted with caution. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation  
There is no relevant clinical experience with KTE-X19 in pregnant women, and animal reproductive 
studies have not been performed. Once infused, CAR T cells may persist long-term, and women who 
plan a pregnancy should consult their physician. This therapy should not be administered to pregnant 
women. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment 
because of the potentially dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus. 
Contraception must be used during treatment and for 6 months after receiving lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy and KTE-X19.  
There is no clinical experience with KTE-X19 therapy in lactating women, and animal reproductive 
studies have not been performed. This therapy should not be administered to women who are 
breastfeeding.  
No pregnancies were reported.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database included 55 patients treated with KTE-X19 in the ZUMA-3 trial. For the patients 
included in this assessment, the median potential follow-up time from the KTE-X19 infusion was 16.4 
months (range: 10.3 to 22.1), which is rather short.  
Among the treated subjects, 95% had Grade 3 or higher AEs, 75% had SAEs. 
49 subjects (89%) had CRS, and 13 subjects (24%) had CRS that was worst Grade 3 or higher. 
No subject had Grade 5 CRS. Among subjects who had CRS, the median time to onset was 5.0 days 
(range: 1 to 12 days) after KTE-X19 infusion. As of the data cutoff date, CRS had resolved in 46 of 
49 subjects. For the remaining 3 subjects, CRS was ongoing at the time of death due to PD on Day 21 
in 1 subject, brain herniation on Day 8 in 1 subject, and pneumonia on Day 15 in 1 subject. 
33 subjects (60%) had at least 1 neurologic AE of any grade, including 14 subjects (25%) with worst 
Grade 3 or higher neurologic AEs. One subject had a Grade 5 neurologic AE of brain herniation. Among 
subjects who had neurologic AEs, the median time to onset was 9.0 days (range: 2 to 16 days) after 
KTE-X19 infusion. As of the cutoff date, neurologic AEs had resolved in 29 of 33 subjects. 
Important identified risks (CRS, neurologic events, cytopenias, infections, and 
hypogammaglobulinemia) were largely reversible and manageable with supportive care and medical 
interventions.  
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 104/119 
 
  
 
 
No secondary malignancies were attributed to KTE-X19, no confirmed cases of immunogenicity were 
identified in Phase 2, and none of the tested subjects were positive for RCR. One subject in Phase 2 
had Grade 3 nonserious tumor lysis syndrome assessed as related to KTE-X19. One subject in Phase 2 
had Grade 2 nonserious GVHD assessed as related to KTE-X19; the subjects had undergone allo-SCT 
prior to enrollment in ZUMA-3.  
No new safety signals were identified. Essentially, the AEs and risks are similar to what has been 
described for other CAR T cell therapies and for KTE-X19 in the MCL indication. No further risks and 
AEs could be identified which would be specific for KTE-X19 or for the indication to be treated with 
KTE-X19. The toxicity management plans are presented in the SmPC and are in line with the general 
management plans for this product class. 
The relatively high number (8) of patients not treated due to AEs following leukapheresis is surprizing. 
It could be probably explained by the poor condition of patients and the natural course of the disease.   
Upon request, additional safety data have been submitted with data cutoff July 23, 2021 regarding 
subgroup analysis for the SAS. There is no significant difference in TEAEs among subjects who had 
received only 1 prior line of therapy versus subjects who had received > 1 prior line of therapy, and 
the incidence of AEs and SAEs were generally similar (< 10% difference) between the subgroups.  
Similarly, no major differences were observed when comparing TEAEs for SCT-naïve subjects and 
subjects who had received a prior allo-SCT, when comparing age categories, or when comparing 
patients who received blinatumomab or inotuzumab versus their corresponding naïve subjects.  
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
In order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in adult patients with r/r ALL, the 
MAH shall submit follow-up results of the ZUMA-3 clinical study (Part 1 and Part 2). 
In order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in adult patients with r/r ALL, the 
MAH should conduct and submit the results of a prospective, observational study based on data from a 
registry, according to an agreed protocol. 
These post authorisation studies should provide longer term data as well as further efficacy and safety 
information on important subgroups (age groups from 18 to 25 years of age and older than 60 years, 
status MRD+ and PH-, patients that have relapsed following allo-SCT), which are not fully represented 
in the pivotal study submitted for this procedure. The provision of this data post authorisation will 
complement the dossier in order to have a comprehensive understanding of efficacy and safety and to 
confirm the positive benefit risk balance of the product in the new indication. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The important identified risks for KTE-X19 in this indication are CRS, neurotoxicity, cytopenias, 
infections, hypogammaglobulinemia. There are some potential risks linked to the use of this product: 
secondary malignancy, immunogenicity, RCR, tumor lysis syndrome, and aggravation of GvHD. 
No new safety signals were identified. Essentially, the AEs and risks are similar to what has been 
described for other CAR T cell therapies and for KTE-X19 in the MCL indication. No further risks and 
AEs could be identified which would be specific for KTE-X19 or for the indication to be treated with 
KTE-X19. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to safety:

Package leaflet has been updated with the proposed extension of an additional indication. As this does 
not lead to principle/significant changes relevant for user testing the MAH refers to the user testing in 
the context of the initial MAA. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applied indication is: Treatment of adult patients 26 years of age and above with relapsed or 
refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients in their second or later relapse may receive therapies typically utilized in the second line, such 
as allo- or auto-Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT). However, few patients in this setting are eligible for 
SCT. Novel therapies approved for the second line, such as blinatumomab or inotuzumab-ozogamicin, 
may also be utilized in the third line if not previously used, although outcomes with these treatments 
are typically not as favourable in patients being treated in the third line and beyond. Subjects receiving 
blinatumomab as a third or later line of therapy for B-ALL had a median OS of 5.1 months compared 
with 11.1 months for those receiving blinatumomab as their second line {Dombret 2019}. The 
combined CR/CRi/CRh rate was also lower for subjects receiving blinatumomab as a third or later line 
compared with those receiving blinatumomab as the second line (39.5% vs 51.0%, respectively). In 
the INO-VATE study, the CR/CRi rate was 77.8% for subjects receiving inotuzumab as the second line 
and 66.1% for those receiving inotuzumab as the third line {Kantarjian 2019}. Another study found 
that subjects who received inotuzumab combined with low-intensity chemotherapy as the third line or 
as a fourth or later line had 1-year OS rates of 26% and 39%, respectively, compared with a 57% 1-
year OS rate in subjects receiving this combination as the second line {Jabbour 2018b}. Because of 
these poor outcomes with third-line and higher therapies, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
and European Society for Medical Oncology recommend that patients seeking treatment for r/r B-ALL 
participate in clinical trials {Hoelzer 2016, National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2020}. 
Recently, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) was approved in the treatment of B-cell ALL that is refractory, in 
relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse in paediatrics and young adults up to and 
including 25 years of age.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study KTE-C19-103 (ZUMA-3), a phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of KTE-C19 in adult subjects with r/r B-ALL. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Per DCO 09 September 2020, the median OCR (CR + CRi) rate per central assessment was 70.9% 
(n=39) for all treated patients followed for a median of 12.4 months. The CR rate was 56% (n=31), 
and the MRD- rate (assessed by central laboratory) was 76%. Among the 39 subjects who achieved CR 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 112/119 
 
  
 
 
or CRi, the KM median DOR was 12.8 months. KM estimates of OS at Month 12 and Month 18 were 
71.4% (95% CI: 57.0%, 81.7%) and 56.6% (95% CI: 41.8%, 72.1%), respectively. None of the 
additional sixteen subjects included in the full analysis set (FAS, n=71) had achieved CR or CRi at 
DCO, therefore, results of DOR in FAS and mITT were identical.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Data are derived from a small trial without a concurrent randomised control. As with any other trials of 
this size in heterogeneous populations uncertainties are therefore related to the “true” estimate for 
efficacy and external validity. Most of the analyses are presented for the mITT population, i.e. the 
population that actually received study drug. This selection clearly biases the determined efficacy 
estimate.  
From a methodological point of view the typical sequence of exploration and confirmation is difficult to 
distinguish with certainty.  
The subgroup analyses for baseline population and disease characteristics generally give a fairly 
consistent picture. However, the small heterogeneous population and the multitudes of univariate 
analyses performed cannot exclude the possibility that subgroups are hidden that may not have the 
intended favourable effects. From subgroup analyses there is some indication that baseline 
characteristics related to higher disease burden are associated with a lower treatment response. Prior 
treatment with blinatumomab or inotuzumab ozogamicin is also associated with a lower response to 
the experimental treatment. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The unfavourable effects for patients treated with KTE-X19 do not only occur as a consequence of KTE-
X19 treatment, but the bridging therapy and conditioning chemotherapy may also induce such effects. 
Nonetheless, a list of unfavourable effects has crystallized which are expected and regarded as class 
effects for CAR-T cell based therapies. 
Important identified unfavourable effects (CRS, neurologic events, cytopenias, infections, and 
hypogammaglobulinemia) were largely reversible and manageable with supportive care and medical 
interventions. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The primary safety database included 55 patients treated with KTE-X19 in the ZUMA-3 trial, which is a 
rather low number. For the patients included in this assessment, the median potential follow-up time 
from the KTE-X19 infusion was 16.4 months (range: 10.3 to 22.1). While this period would be enough 
to identify the earlier and immediate AEs, there are certain potential risks for which conclusive data 
could not be obtained due to the limited follow-up time. Therefore, aspects regarding secondary 
malignancies, replication competent retrovirus analysis need to be appropriately assessed in the 
follow-up study.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The final benefit-risk evaluation considers the initial clinical data set (n=55 subjects in the phase 2 
portion of the ZUMA-3 study) and additional n=23 subjects from the phase 1 portion of the ZUMA-3 
study, centrally assessed and treated with the pivotal dose.   
Ultimately the benefit of a therapy in oncology is an improved survival. However, choosing OS as an 
endpoint requires a reliable comparison, preferably via a randomised control. For a number of reasons 
randomised controls are often not available in the later line setting in haemato-oncology generally and 
in the ATMP field specifically. Objective responses to therapy are accepted endpoints because they 
allow to estimate a favourable effect that is causally related to the therapy in a single arm trial. 
Consequently the demonstration of a high response rate (as determined by CR) to treatment with KTE-
X19 that is also associated with the disappearance of measurable disease is regarded as highly 
relevant. This is particularly true for a population that has received multiple previous therapies. Even 
when taking into account the uncertainties as regards the selection of the population and the concerns 
on methodology and analyses of data the obtained response rates achieved are regarded as relevant 
on their own. The applicant has attempted to put the achieved results into context but further analyses 
of these datasets are necessary to come to a conclusion. Achieving CR is usually regarded as a 
prerequisite for additional therapeutic interventions but the follow-up is currently too short to 
determine the exact role of KTE-X19 in the overall treatment paradigm. It is noted that some patients 
went on to SCT as a potentially curative option, that the favourable effects appear lesser in a 
population with worse prognostic baseline characteristics and that the trial population was quite 
heterogeneous.  As a second component to describe the favourable effects the duration of response is 
important to complement the results achieved for duration of response. The observed duration of 
response is in this case particularly remarkable, especially for individuals that achieved a complete 
response. 
The most important unfavourable effects of KTE-X19 as a CAR T cell product in general are CRS, 
neurotoxicity, cytopenias, infections and hypogammaglobulinaemia. Generally these unfavourable 
effects are either treatable or have a self-limiting course and are reversible. The potential serious 
consequences of CRS have been recognised and treatment algorithms have been developed that are 
still being refined according to further experience. Overall considering the life-threatening disease the 
safety profile of KTE-X19 seems to be acceptable for the target population. Since the unfavourable 
effects are in line with the experience made with this drug class, the identified uncertainties and 
limitations are of limited relevance. No new safety signals were identified. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Despite the described uncertainties on the favourable clinical effects, they appear to outweigh the 
identified unfavourable effects and limitations of the ZUMA-3 trial as a single arm trial with a small 
number of subjects treated.  The benefit is regarded as sufficiently robust to conclude on a favourable 
B/R in the overall population in the context of a CMA. 
The benefit risk balance of Tecartus in the treatment of adult patients 26 years of age and above with 
relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), is positive.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
EMA/683619/2022  
Page 115/119 
 
  
 
 
Tecartus was initially, and currently is, approved by a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA). As 
the underlying data supporting this new indication is regarded as not comprehensive and as it aims at 
the treatment of a life-threatening disease and is designated as an orphan condition, and in view of the 
foregoing, the legal requirements also apply for this extension of indication which falls within the scope 
of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
The CAT considers that the new indication also fulfils the requirements under a conditional marketing 
authorisation framework: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed above. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data:  
- Long-term follow-up data from ZUMA-3: In order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety 
of Tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL, the MAH will submit follow-up data 
from all treated patients with the pivotal dose in the ZUMA-3 trial Part 1 and Part 2.  
- A registry-based study: In order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in 
adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL, the MAH will submit the results of a prospective, 
observational study investigating efficacy and safety based on data from the same registry used 
to characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus, according to an agreed protocol.  
These post authorisation studies will provide longer term data as well as further efficacy and 
safety information on important subgroups (age groups from 18 to 25 years of age and older 
than 60 years, status MRD+ and PH-, patients that have relapsed following allo-SCT , which are 
not fully represented in the pivotal study submitted for this procedure. The provision of this data 
post authorisation will complement the dossier in order to have a comprehensive understanding 
of efficacy and safety and to confirm the positive benefit risk balance of the product in the new 
indication. 
• 
An unmet medical need will be addressed. With each subsequent relapse, the prognosis of adult 
patients with B-cell precursor ALL gets worse and there is a clear unmet medical need in this 
disease. Several medicinal products have been authorised in B-cell precursor ALL, most notably, 
blinatumumab and inotuzumab ozogamicin. When compared to blinatumomab and inotuzumab 
ozogamicin, the efficacy results in the ZUMA-3 trial indicate improved efficacy of Tecartus 
therefore offering a major therapeutic advantage over these two existing therapies. In addition, 
Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) was approved in the treatment of B-cell ALL that is refractory, in 
relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse in paediatrics and young adults up to and 
including 25 years of age. Tecartus therefore addresses an unmet medical need via-a-vis 
Kymriah in the adult patient population aged 26 years and above 
In summary, Tecartus provides a treatment option for which a clinically meaningful benefit was 
demonstrated with respect to complete response, overall response rate and duration of 
response. Thus, the availability of Tecartus represents a major therapeutic advantage vis-à-vis 
existing treatments for adult patients 26 years of age and above. 
•  The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent to the fact 
that additional data are still required. As benefit-risk balance on basis of the current data is 
regarded positive and in view of the medical need in the target population, an additional therapy 
option for for adult patients 26 years of age and above with relapsed or refractory B-cell 
precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is considered beneficial.

In addition, the CAT considers the following measures necessary to ensure the follow up of safety and 
efficacy: 
In order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in adult patients with r/r ALL, the 
MAH shall submit follow-up results of the ZUMA-3 clinical study (Part 1 and Part 2). 
In order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in adult patients with 
relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL the MAH shall conduct and submit the results of a 
prospective study based on data from a registry, according to an agreed protocol. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Tecartus for the treatment of treatment of adult patients 26 years of age and above 
with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), is positive subject to 
the specific obligations and conditions imposed in order to obtain further clinical data to generate a 
comprehensive clinical data set and inform the long-term efficacy and safety profile of the product in 
this new indication.

Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CAT by consensus is of the opinion that Tecartus is not similar to Kymriah, Besponsa, Iclusig and 
Blyncito within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CAT reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 2).

2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Introduction
Dabigatran etexilate (DE) is a potent, competitive, rapidly acting oral direct thrombin inhibitor. 
DE is the oral pro-drug of the active moiety dabigatran and does not possess anticoagulant activity. 
After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly absorbed and converted to dabigatran by 
esterase-catalysed hydrolysis in plasma and in the liver. 
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023 
Page 10/56
Since thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the coagulation 
cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of thrombus. Dabigatran inhibits free thrombin, fibrin-
bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.  
2.2.  Quality aspects
2.2.1.  Introduction

relative molecular mass of 723.86 g/mol and the following structure:
Figure 1: Active substance structure
The chemical structure of dabigatran etexilate mesilate was elucidated by a combination of Elemental 
Analysis, Ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV), Infrared spectroscopy (IR), 1H and 13C Nuclear Magnetic 
Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and Mass spectrometry (MS). The solid-state properties of the active 
substance were measured by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and thermal Analysis (TA). The active substance 
has a non-chiral molecular structure. The key physico-chemical properties relevant for the applied 
dosage form of the finished product are polymorphic form, particle size and stability of the active 
substance.
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023 
Page 11/56
Dabigatran etexilate mesilate is a yellow-white to yellow non-hygroscopic anhydrous crystalline 
powder, soluble in pH=1.2 aqueous media, but insoluble in aqueous media above pH=3.
Polymorphism has been observed for dabigatran etexilate mesilate. Form-I is the form that is 
consistently produced by the active substance manufacturer and it is routinely tested at release and 
shown to be the stable polymorphic form throughout the re-test period of the active substance.
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Dabigatran etexilate mesilate is synthesized in 5 stages of branched synthesis consisting of 9 main 
steps (8 synthetic and a final purification/salification step), using well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. 
The process comprises of standard chemical transformation steps. The synthesis of the active 
substance is adequately described. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The 
specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have 
been presented. The overall control strategy is considered adequate and yields an active substance of 
an acceptable quality. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin, demonstrating a good understanding of fate, purge and associated process controls in the 
process. 
During the assessment, a Major Objection was raised in order to request a risk evaluation concerning 
the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance, which was adequately resolved by the 
Applicant by submission of a risk assessment indicating no risk of nitrosamine formation from the 
active substance manufacturing process.
Dabigatran etexilate mesilate is packaged in triple low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags, the outer 
layer being black, blanketed with nitrogen at each stage and placed inside a triple laminated bag and 
finally into a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) drum. Silica gel packets are placed with each clear and 
black bag layer and between the black PE bag and the laminated bag. Suitable specifications and 
declarations are provided regarding compliance with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as 
amended, for each relevant packaging material component.
Specification
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, solubility (Ph. Eur.), identity (IR, 
HPLC), water content (KF), methane sulfonic acid content (titration), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), impurities 
(HPLC and LCMS), residual solvents (GC), assay (HPLC), polymorphism (XRD) and particle size 
distribution (PSD).
The proposed active substance specification includes relevant testing parameters. The specification was 
established taking into account applicable ICH and EU guidelines and compendial considerations, as 
well as manufacturing capability, batch analysis data and stability results. Control for impurities at 
intermediate stages with omission of tests at active substance level is acceptable based on carry over 
and purge analyses. The control strategy for residual solvents (including potential contaminants) is in 
line with ICH Q3C guideline. A risk assessment for the potential presence of elemental impurities at the 
active substance level was conducted according to ICH Q3D and the conclusion that no additional 
controls are necessary is considered acceptable.
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023 
Page 12/56
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.
Batch analysis data are provided for 4 commercial scale batches of which 1 was micronized were 
provided. Comparison of the micronized and non-micronised batches demonstrates that the 
polymorphic form remains the same and that there is no increase in the formation of impurities 
following micronisation. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.
Stability
Stability data from 3 micronised and 3 non-micronised active substance batches, from the proposed 
manufacturer, stored in the intended commercial package, for up to 48 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC/60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC/75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B 
was performed. Results from forced degradation studies under thermal, acidic, basic and oxidative 
stress were also provided.
The following parameters were tested: description, identification, water, related substances, assay and 
polymorphic form. The analytical methods used were the same as for release.
All tested parameters were within the specifications. Degradation products increased under accelerated 
conditions but remained within the specification limits. The photostability testing results show that no 
degradation was observed under the study conditions. The forced studies results demonstrate that 
assay and purity HLPC methods are stability indicating and that the active substance is sensitive in 
thermal treatment and extremely sensitive towards hydrolysis in acidic and basic media.
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months in the proposed 
container, with no special storage condition.
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development
The finished product is an immediate release hard capsule containing 75 mg, 110 mg or 150 mg 
dabigatran etexilate mesilate, described as follows: 

75 mg: Size “2” capsule with a white opaque cap imprinted “MD” and white opaque body imprinted 
“75” with black ink, containing a blend of white to light yellow-coloured pellets and a light-yellow 
coloured granulate.

110 mg: Size “1” capsule having white opaque cap imprinted “MD” and white opaque body 
imprinted “110” with black ink, containing a blend of white to light yellow-coloured pellets and a 
light-yellow coloured granulate.

150 mg: Size “0” capsule having white opaque cap imprinted “MD” and white opaque body 
imprinted “150” with black ink, containing a blend of white to light yellow-coloured pellets and a 
light-yellow coloured granulate.
The composition of the dabigatran etexilate mesilate finished product (including the composition of the 
hypromellose hard capsules and inscription ink) is adequately presented in the dossier. The 
compositions of the 75 mg, 110 mg and 150 mg hard capsules are dose proportional.
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023 
Page 13/56
The pharmaceutical development objective was to obtain a solid oral dosage form containing 
dabigatran etexilate mesilate 75 mg, 110 mg and 150 mg per unit, that could be easily manufactured, 
stable in the proposed container closure system and essentially similar to the originator product 
(Pradaxa® hard capsules 75 mg, 110 mg and 150 mg, Marketing Authorization Holder Boehringer 
Ingelheim international GmbH, Germany). 
All excipients used for dabigatran etexilate mesilate finished product manufacturing are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The chosen excipients are common for this type of 
dosage form and the selection was based on a study of the reference product inactive ingredients and 
also formulation development studies, along with excipient compatibility study. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.
The differences in terms of excipients used between the reference and the intended generic products 
were highlighted by the applicant. The selection of each excipient and the proposed level have been 
adequately discussed and justified. The compatibility between the active substance and excipients has 
been demonstrated based on the stability results. The differences in the composition of the test 
product compared to the reference product do not raise additional concerns with respect to safety 
and/or efficacy. 
Comparative dissolution profiles between the reference and test products were evaluated in 900 mL of 
0.01 N hydrochloric acid (pH 2.0), pH 4.5 acetate buffer and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer, using 
pharmacopoeial basket apparatus for 75 mg and 110 mg strengths and a modified basket apparatus 
for 150 mg strength, at 100 rpm. Adequate justification for performing the dissolution test at pH 2 
instead of the standard pH 1.2 has been provided, based on the fact that dabigatran etexilate is not 
stable in solution at pH 1.2. The selection of a slightly larger basket apparatus for dabigatran etexilate 
mesilate 150 mg capsules has been adequately justified by the applicant, based on the variable 
dissolution results that were observed due to slow disintegration caused by capsules not being able to 
move freely in the standard pharmacopoeial basket apparatus. 
Adequate bioequivalence studies (i.e. both under fasting and under conditions of pre-treatment with a 
proton pump inhibitor (PPI), in accordance with “Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence” 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1) and “Dabigatran etexilate hard capsule 75 mg, 110 mg and 150 mg 
product-specific bioequivalence guidance” (EMA/CHMP/805498/2016)) were performed for the 150 mg 
capsules. However, as the dissolution profiles in support of the use of biowaivers for the 75 mg and 
110 mg strengths did not show similarity under the studied conditions, results obtained in the 
conducted bioequivalence studies could not be extrapolated to the lower finished product strengths. 
During the assessment, a Major Objection was raised to request further dissolution and in vivo data. In 
response to this, the applicant provided an acceptable discussion on the reasons for the discrepancy 
between the results obtained in the in vitro dissolution studies, as well as additional supporting 
dissolution data using the same conditions (i.e. modified basket) for all strengths. Moreover, results 
from an additional bioequivalence study performed with the 75 mg capsules solely under fasting 
conditions were submitted, the applicant justifying that the study in fasted state in the presence of a 
proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is the least sensitive (i.e. the dissolution profiles that differ are those at 
acidic pH (2.0); at pH 4.5 and 6.8 dissolution profiles are similar). This justification was accepted. 
Based on the totality of available data and in accordance with the EMA “Guideline on the Investigation 
of Bioequivalence”, the Applicant has adequately justified the use of a bracketing approach and, in 
conclusion, bioequivalence between the test and reference products is considered demonstrated.
The proposed manufacturing process is considered standard, selected based on the physicochemical 
properties of the active substance and the choice of manufacturing process has been adequately 
justified. The applicant has demonstrated that the polymorphic form does not change during the 
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023 
Page 14/56
manufacturing process of the finished product and that finished product XRPD testing on release or 
during stability is not required. 
No overages are used in the manufacturing process of dabigatran etexilate mesilate capsules.
The development of the dissolution method has been described in details and the proposed method is 
found acceptable. The dissolution method can discriminate changes to formulation and material 
properties and relevant manufacturing process parameters.
The proposed packaging materials are OPA/Alu/desiccant PE-PET/Alu/PE blisters, OPA/Alu/desiccant 
PE-PET/Alu/PE perforated unit dose blisters or polypropylene bottles. The materials comply with Ph. 
Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure systems has been validated by stability 
data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls
The finished product is manufactured, filled, packaged and tested in accordance with GMP. 
The manufacturing process is regarded as a standard manufacturing process and consists of the 
following 4 major steps: preparation of seal coated tartaric acid pellets blend, preparation of 
dabigatran blend, capsule filling and packaging. A flow diagram and a narrative description of the 
manufacturing process and in-process controls are provided in the dossier. All finished product 
strengths are manufactured from the same common blend. Therefore, equipment, processes and 
proven acceptance ranges are applicable for all capsule strengths. 
The batch formula is given for the proposed commercial batch size for each strength. 
In-process controls during the finished product manufacture have been established based on the 
manufacturing process development studies and are considered adequate. Holding time periods have 
been adequately justified based on data generated using a bracketing approach.
The manufacturing process was validated with 3 commercial scale batches for each capsule strength.
The data adequately demonstrates that the proposed manufacturing process is capable of consistently 
producing batches which are in compliance with the finished product specifications.
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance (visual inspection), identification (UV, HPLC), identification of coloring agents (in house), 
average blend fill mass (Ph. Eur.), average mass of filled capsule (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units 
(mass variation, Ph. Eur.), water content (Karl Fischer/Ph. Eur.), disintegration time (Ph. Eur.), 
dissolution (HPLC/Ph. Eur.), assay and degradation products (HPLC/Ph. Eur.), N-nitroso dabigatran 
impurity (LC-MS/MS) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.).
The proposed specification tests are in line with ICH Q6A and Ph. Eur. requirements. The parameters 
included in the specification are found adequate to control the quality of the finished product at release 
and shelf-life. During the assessment, amendment of release and shelf-life acceptance criteria for 
appearance, disintegration, dissolution, related substances and shelf-life acceptance criteria for water 
content and total impurities was requested by CHMP and implemented by the applicant.
The impurities likely to be present in dabigatran etexilate mesilate finished product were adequately 
discussed by the applicant. The proposed limit for impurities in the specification are justified based on 
the level seen in the batch analysis and stability studies. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The risk assessment 
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023 
Page 15/56
and testing results by ICP-MS revealed that the impurity levels for the elements considered in the 
finished product are below the control threshold of 30% of the permitted daily exposure (PDE) and, 
therefore, routine elemental impurities release testing is not conducted. This conclusion is endorsed.
Solvents used during the manufacture of the finished product are tested in applicable steps throughout 
the manufacturing process, confirming compliance with ICH Q3C. Therefore, no additional residual 
solvent testing is required for the finished product release testing.
In response to a Major Objection raised during the assessment, a risk assessment concerning the 
potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product was performed considering all 
suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004 - Nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Considering that the active substance is itself a secondary 
alkylarylamine, it was concluded that there is a potential risk of formation of nitrosamine impurities in 
the finished product. Confirmatory testing was carried out using an appropriately validated and suitably 
sensitive LCMS-MS method and the active substance related nitrosamine (N-nitroso dabigatran) was 
detected in tested finished product batches. Therefore, a limit of NMT 0.03 ppm is included in the 
finished product specification, corresponding to the acceptable intake of 18 ng/day adopted by CHMP. 
In addition, to further ensure that the levels of this impurity do not exceed the specification limit in the 
finished product, an even lower limit of NMT 0.010 ppm for the N-nitroso dabigatran impurity has been 
added to the active substance specification. The applicant’s approach is endorsed. The applicant also 
provided, upon request, confirmatory testing of all materials in the route of synthesis (from starting 
material to the final active substance), which might contain possible secondary amines. Results 
provided indicate that the levels of these potential nitrosamine impurities are below the detection limit 
and, therefore, no specific control measures are deemed necessary. Nevertheless, one point needs to 
be clarified regarding suitability of the analytical methods used for confirmatory testing of the finished 
product batches. Although the risk assessment and provided results indicate that the potential 
nitrosamine impurities will not be present above 10% of the respective acceptable intake (AI) limits, 
validation of the methods should be carried out according to the protocol used to validate the N-nitroso 
dabigatran method. That protocol used placebo capsule solutions spiked with varying levels of the 
respective N-nitrosamine impurity and should be replicated to validate the other impurity methods for 
specificity (absence of interference), accuracy and precision. This point is put forward as 
recommendation for future quality development.
Description of the analytical methods used to control the finished product are adequately presented 
and, in general, appropriate validation of the non-compendial methods in accordance with EU/ICH 
validation guidelines has been performed. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.
Batch analysis results are presented for 10 commercial scale batches of each strength manufactured at 
the proposed manufacturing site. The results show that the finished product meets the proposed 
specification limits and confirm batch-to-batch consistency. The finished product is released on the 
market based on the release specifications, through traditional finished product release testing.
Stability of the product
Stability studies have been carried out on 3 production scale finished product batches of each strength 
in each packaging configuration (blister packs and bottles), manufactured at the proposed 
manufacturing site, in line with ICH guidance. Data for up to 36 months under long-term storage 
conditions (25 ºC/60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated storage conditions (40 ºC/75% 
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023 
Page 16/56
RH) were provided. In addition, 3 batches of a single strength per packaging configuration (150 mg 
strength for the blister pack configuration and 75 mg for the container pack configuration) were also 
stored under intermediate conditions (30 ºC/65% RH) for up to 12 months.
The following parameters were tested during stability studies: appearance, identification, average 
mass of filled capsule, water content, disintegration time, dissolution, assay and degradation products 
including N-nitroso dabigatran and microbial limits. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release. Forced degradation studies were performed for assay and related substances methods and it 
was confirmed that the methods are stability indicating.
Similar results are obtained for all capsule strengths and packaging configurations. At all tested 
conditions, an increase in total impurities and one specified impurity content was observed, however 
the recorded results remain within specification, except for the specified impurity for which results 
exceeded the proposed shelf-life limit and so the impacted batches were tested after storage under 
intermediate conditions. The results demonstrate compliance with the proposed specifications. 
A photostability study was carried out in accordance with the ICH Q1B guideline and it was concluded 
that the dabigatran etexilate mesilate finished product is not sensitive to light. Hence, no special storage 
conditions are required. 
In-use stability studies for up to 120 days were conducted for each finished product strength to 
evaluate the stability in the multi-dose bottle pack at controlled room temperature (25°C/60% RH). 
The results showed there is a sharp rise in one specified impurity content, although still within limits at 
the end of the study. Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, an in-use shelf-life of 60 days has 
been proposed by the applicant and is considered acceptable. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months and storage conditions of “store 
below 30°C” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable for the product packed in both 
OPA/Alu/desiccant PE-Alu/PE blister pack and polypropylene bottle pack.
Adventitious agents
No materials derived from animal and/or human origin are used in the manufacture of dabigatran 
etexilate mesilate 75 mg, 110 mg and 150 mg hard capsules. The corresponding TSE/BSE certificates 
for the active substance and excipients are provided in Module 3.2.R Regional information. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. 
During the procedure, 3 Major Objections were raised, concerning (1) insufficient in vitro and in vivo 
data in support of the biowaivers requested by the Applicant for demonstrating bioequivalence between 
the dabigatran etexilate mesilate finished product and the reference medicinal product for the 75 mg 
and 110 mg presentations; (2) incomplete risk evaluation for the presence of nitrosamine impurities in 
the active substance; (3) incomplete risk evaluation for the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the 
finished product. The Major Objections, as well as all the other concerns, have been satisfactorily 
resolved. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023 
Page 17/56
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to demonstration of suitability of the analytical methods 
used for confirmatory testing of N-nitrosamine impurities of the finished product batches. This point is 
put forward and agreed as recommendation for future quality development.
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development  
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following point for investigation:
1. The applicant should re-validate the N-nitrosamine impurity methods for selectivity, accuracy 
and precision using an equivalent protocol to that used to validate the N-nitroso dabigatran 
method.
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable. 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Dabigatran Etexilate Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare S.L.U. is considered 
unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all dabigatran etexilate 
containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is 
expected to be similar.
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
The pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of dabigatran etexilate (as 
mesilate) are well known. As dabigatran etexilate is a widely used, well-known active substance, the 
applicant has not provided additional non-clinical studies and CHMP considered that further studies are 
not required. The application contains an adequate review of published non-clinical data.
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
The non-clinical information provided in this application is considered acceptable by CHMP to support 
the use of Dabigatran Etexilate Accord in the approved indications.

2.4.  Clinical aspects
2.4.1.  Introduction
This is an application for hard capsules containing dabigatran etexilate. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted three bioequivalence studies with cross-over design 
under fasting conditions. 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical 
assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) in its 
current version is of particular relevance.
GCP aspect
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.
Exemption
In vitro dissolution tests in support of biowaiver of strengths
With the initial submission, for this application, a strength based biowaiver was applied, by the 
applicant, for the additional capsule strengths of 75 mg and 110 mg based on the in vivo results of 
capsule strength 150 mg.
The request for a strength based biowaiver was justified by the applicant as follows:
-
-
-
-
-
-
The strengths are manufactured to the same manufacturing process by the same 
manufacturer.
The strengths are immediate release formulated as capsule, hard.
The qualitative composition of the strengths is the same.
The composition of the strengths is quantitatively proportional.
The in vitro dissolution profiles of all strengths are similar since f2 is more than 50 in the 
physiological pH range.
The active substance exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 10 mg to 400 mg.
The qualitative and quantitative composition of the additional capsule strengths 75 mg, 110 mg and 
biobatch capsule strength 150 mg are the same.
The applicant employed a basket method with modified diameter for strength 150 mg and normal 
baskets for 110 mg and 75 mg. For the biowaiver of strengths conventional dissolution conditions (e.g. 
basket with normal diameter, 100 rpm, 900 mL, pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8, n=12) should be used.
The f2 values provided suggesting similarity for biowaiver of strengths were considered questionable 
by CHMP considering the tabular in vitro dissolution data. According to the Guideline on the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) the following criteria should be 
fulfilled for f2 calculation:
- A minimum of three time points (zero excluded).
- The time points should be the same for the two formulations.
- Twelve individual values for every time point for each formulation.
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023 
Page 19/56
- Not more than one mean value of >85% dissolved for any of the formulations.
- The relative standard deviation or coefficient of variation of any product should be less 
than 20% for the first time point and less than 10% from the second to last time point.
During the procedure major concerns were raised with respect to the comparison of in vitro dissolution 
within the drug product series as follows:
-the criteria for the f2 calculations (market in bold) were not fulfilled 
-the QC medium (pH 2.0) was chosen over pH 1.2 due to instability of dabigatran Etexilate. For 
biowaiver purpose the applicant was requested by CHMP to demonstrate that the active substance is 
similarly recovered within the drug product series i.e. among 75 mg (additional strength) vs. 150 mg 
(biobatch) and 110 mg (additional strength) vs. 150 mg (biobatch) in pH 1.2 using conventional 
dissolution conditions (e.g. basket with normal diameter, 100 rpm, 900 mL, pH 1.2, n=12).
To address the CHMP concerns, the applicant submitted a new bioequivalence study with the 75 mg 
strength, study no. 65321. This study was an addition to the two initially submitted bioequivalence 
studies with the 150 mg strength of applied product, with the aim to extrapolate the in vivo data of 75 
mg to the additional strength 110 mg and thus requesting the 150 mg strength to be a standalone.  
The new study submitted with 75 mg was considered acceptable and bioequivalence was shown 
appropriately between the test product and reference product in subjects under fasting conditions. 
However, bioequivalence demonstration with the 75 mg strength after pre-treatment of proton-pump 
inhibitors was still missing and a biowaiver request for the 110 mg strength based solely on the one 
study with the 75 mg strength was not considered acceptable by CHMP. The applicant was then 
requested to establish a comparable dissolution between the 150 mg strength and the additional 
strengths, 75 mg and 110 mg, under same conditions, in order for the biowaiver of strengths to be 
accepted. Furthermore, considering the submitted studies were conducted with the highest and lowest 
strengths and that the applied formulation is manufactured by the same manufacturing process, the 
qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same, the formulation is quantitatively 
proportional and Dabigatran exhibits liner pharmacokinetics, a bracketing approach could be 
considered. The applicant was therefore also asked to justify a bracketing approach and to address 
whether or not a waiver of the study with the 75 mg strength (pre-treatment with PPI under fasting 
conditions) could be applied based on available knowledge and/or PK data from the studies conducted 
at the strength tested under both conditions (under fasting and a multiple day pre-treatment with a 
PPI under fasting conditions).
The CHMP also requested an advice from the Pharmacokinetic working party on the suggested 
bracketing approach and whether the PPI study under fasting conditions with the additional strength 
(75 mg) might be waived. 
The applicant submitted additional comparative dissolution studies at pH 2.0, pH 4.5 and pH 6.8 
performed by using modified baskets for all strengths. Since dabigatran is claimed to be unstable at pH 
1.2, dissolution data at this pH were not performed. This approach was considered acceptable by 
CHMP. In addition, due to the high variability in the dissolution data the 90% CI of expected f2 was 
obtained by bootstrapping. These calculations were conducted with the software package PhEq.
The comparison between the biobatch high strength of 150 mg and the intermediate strength of 110 
mg shows similar dissolution profiles at pH 2.0, 4.5 and 6.8 since the lower boundary of the 90% CI of 
expected f2 is >50.
The comparison between the biobatch high strength of 150 mg and the low strength of 75 mg shows 
similar dissolution profiles at 4.5 and 6.8 since the lower boundary of the 90% CI of expected f2 is 
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023 
Page 20/56
>50. However, at pH 2.0 the lower boundary of the 90% CI of expected f2 is <50. Consequently, the 
applicant applied a bracketing approach. 
According to the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence, bracketing approach would include, 
in the present case, four studies: in fasted state and in fasted state with pre-treatment with a PPI for 
the two strengths most different in dissolution profiles, in this case the 75 mg and 150 mg strengths. 
However, the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence indicates that when 4 studies are needed 
in a bracketing approach, i.e. two strengths in fasted and fed state, one of the studies can be waived if 
justified: Waiver of either the fasting or the fed study at the other strength(s) may be justified based 
on previous knowledge and/or pharmacokinetic data from the study conducted at the strength tested 
in both fasted and fed state. The condition selected (fasting or fed) to test the other strength(s) should 
be the one which is most sensitive to detect a difference between products. 
Based on the submitted dissolution data, the extremes of the brackets (i.e. the high strength and the 
low strength) are the strengths differing most in dissolution rate. Furthermore, the applicant has 
justified that the study under fasting conditions is the most sensitive one as the dissolution profiles 
that differ the most are the ones under fasting conditions (pH 2.0). The bracketing approach is 
therefore considered acceptable by CHMP and a biowaiver for the study with 75 mg under fasting 
conditions with pre-treatment with PPI can be granted. 
Tabular overview of clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted three bioequivalence studies.

Since the drug product is formulated as an immediate release dosage form as capsule, hard, a single 
dose study of subjects in the fasting state was submitted for the demonstration of bioequivalence 
between the test and reference products (studies no. 605/19).
In accordance with the product-specific bioequivalence guidance (12/2018) for dabigatran etexilate 75 
mg, 110 mg, 150 mg, capsule, hard, the single dose study of subjects under fasting conditions is 
supplemented with an additional single dose study of subjects pre-treated with a proton pump inhibitor 
under fasting conditions (study 606/19).
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023 
Page 21/56
The alternative replicate study design is acceptable to demonstrate bioequivalence between the test 
product and reference product given the expected high intra-subject CV of Cmax of the latter providing 
the possibility of widening the acceptance criterion of Cmax.
The studies included with the initial submission (studies 605/19 and 606/19) were conducted with the 
highest strength in line with general guidance. Additionally, a new study (no. 65321) with the 75 mg 
strength was submitted during the procedure to address questions raised by CHMP on the biowaiver of 
strengths.

 Analytical methods
An analytical method was developed for the determination of dabigatran (free and total) in human 
plasma and can be summarised as follows: 
The study samples were analysed by an LC method with MS/MS detection after liquid-liquid extraction 
using dabigatran-D4 HCl as internal standard for the detection of free dabigatran and total dabigatran 
in line with bioanalytical procedures.
The method validation reports have been provided for the methods for free dabigatran and total 
dabigatran. Both methods were fully and partially validated and followed the same methodology. Minor 
differences between the methods concerned the calibration concentrations range and concentrations of 
QC samples as well as the various sample and solution stabilities. The method validations can be 
collectively summarised as follows:
Free dabigatran
Calibration range: 1.0057–303.03 ng/mL
QC concentrations: 1.0090 ng/mL (LLOQ QC), 2.9247 ng/mL (LQC), 20.032 ng/mL (AQC-II), 40.065 
ng/mL (AQC-I), 105.43 ng/mL (MQC), 228.21 ng/mL (HQC)
Total dabigatran
Calibration range: 1.0092–503.11 ng/mL
QC concentrations: 1.0156 ng/mL (LLOQ QC), 2.9352 ng/mL (LQC), 30.260 ng/mL (AQC-II), 75.650 
ng/mL (AQC-I), 175.93 ng/mL (MQC), 381.63 ng/mL (HQC)
Pre-study validation
Selectivity, absence of the contribution of interferring components of endogenous plasma components 
with respect to chromatographic interference with the analyte or internal standard was demonstrated 
in different lots of blank human plasma (6), haemolysed plasma (1) and lipemic plasma (1) at LLOQ. 
Selectivity was also demonstrated with respect to various potentially interferring drugs including 
paracetamol, diclofenac, ondansetron, nicotine, caffeine, ranitidine, norfloxacin, tinidazole, hyoscine 
butyl bromide, tranexamic acid, tramadol, hydrocortisone, pheniramine maleate, pantoprazole, 
dexamethasone.
Absence of matrix factor was shown in different lots of blank human plasma (6), haemolysed plasma 
(1) and lipemic plasma (1) spiked at LQC and HQC levels.

Linearity was shown within the calibration range for free dabigatran and total dabigatran.
Within run/intra batch and between run/inter batch precision and accuracy of QC samples (LLOQ QC, 
LQC, AQC-II, AQC-I, MQC, HQC) were demonstrated. Carry-over was adequately assessed immediately 
after the highest calibration standard in each validation run. The precision and accuracy of dilution 
integrity was shown 6 times at a concentration of two times the highest standard of the calibration 
curve diluted 1/3rd and 1/5th.
Stability of the analyte at LQC and HQC concentrations was established including long term and short 
term stability in biological matrix, long term stability in stock and working solutions, freeze-thaw 
stability (5 cycles), post-preparative stability, in-injector stability of the processed sample in 
autosampler and re-injection reproducibility. 
Within-study validation
The method performance during study sample analysis was demonstrated by acceptable mean 
precision and accuracy using QC samples (LLOQ QC, LQC, AQC-II, AQC-I, MQC, HQC) of all accepted 
runs. Back calculated concentrations of the calibration standards were determined to confirm goodness 
of fit to the calibration range and demonstrate consistent and reliable data for all subjects.
Reanalysis of samples (free dabigatran: 121/3379 samples: 3.6%, total dabigatran: 4/3379 samples: 
0.1%) was performed for analytical reasons including inconsistent internal standard response, 
incomplete analysis, rejected analytical run and above upper limit of quantification. 
Incurred sample reanalysis (230/3379 samples: 6.8%) was performed to confirm the reproducibility of 
the bioanalytical method.

 Analytical methods
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023 
Page 38/56
 
An analytical method was developed for the determination of dabigatran (free and total) in human 
plasma and can be summarised as follows: 
The study samples were analysed by an LC method with MS/MS detection after liquid-liquid extraction 
using dabigatran-D4 HCl as internal standard for the detection of free dabigatran and total dabigatran 
in line with bioanalytical procedures.
The method validation reports have been provided for the methods for free dabigatran and total 
dabigatran, respectively. Both methods were fully and partially validated and followed the same 
methodology. Minor differences between the methods concerned the calibration concentrations range 
and concentrations of QC samples as well as the various sample and solution stabilities. The method 
validations can be collectively summarised as follows:
Free dabigatran
Calibration range: 1.0057–303.03 ng/mL
QC concentrations: 1.0090 ng/mL (LLOQ QC), 2.9247 ng/mL (LQC), 20.032 ng/mL (AQC-II), 40.065 
ng/mL (AQC-I), 105.43 ng/mL (MQC), 228.21 ng/mL (HQC)
Total dabigatran
Calibration range: 1.0092–503.11 ng/mL
QC concentrations: 1.0156 ng/mL (LLOQ QC), 2.9352 ng/mL (LQC), 30.260 ng/mL (AQC-II), 75.650 
ng/mL (AQC-I), 175.93 ng/mL (MQC), 381.63 ng/mL (HQC)
Pre-study validation
Selectivity, absence of the contribution of interferring components of endogenous plasma components 
with respect to chromatographic interference with the analyte or internal standard was demonstrated 
in different lots of blank human plasma (6), haemolysed plasma (1) and lipemic plasma (1) at LLOQ. 
Selectivity was also demonstrated with respect to various potentially interferring drugs including 
paracetamol, diclofenac, ondansetron, nicotine, caffeine, ranitidine, norfloxacin, tinidazole, hyoscine 
butyl bromide, tranexamic acid, tramadol, hydrocortisone, pheniramine maleate, pantoprazole, 
dexamethasone.
Absence of matrix factor was shown in different lots of blank human plasma (6), haemolysed plasma 
(1) and lipemic plasma (1) spiked at LQC and HQC levels.
Linearity was shown within the calibration range for free dabigatran and total dabigatran.
Within run/intra batch and between run/inter batch precision and accuracy of QC samples (LLOQ QC, 
LQC, AQC-II, AQC-I, MQC, HQC) were demonstrated. Carry-over was adequately assessed immediately 
after the highest calibration standard in each validation run. The precision and accuracy of dilution 
integrity was shown 6 times at a concentration of two times the highest standard of the calibration 
curve diluted 1/3rd and 1/5th.
Stability of the analyte at LQC and HQC concentrations was established including long term and short 
term stability in biological matrix, long term stability in stock and working solutions, freeze-thaw 
stability (5 cycles), post-preparative stability, in-injector stability of the processed sample in 
autosampler and re-injection reproducibility. 
Within-study validation
No significant interferences were observed in the lots of human K2EDTA plasma used for the 
preparation of calibration standards and quality control samples. 
The method performance during study sample analysis was demonstrated by acceptable mean 
precision and accuracy using QC samples (LQC, AQC-II, AQC-I, MQC, HQC) of all accepted runs. Back 
calculated concentrations of the calibration standards were determined to confirm goodness of fit to 
the calibration range and demonstrate consistent and reliable data for all subjects.
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023 
Page 39/56
The QC samples are >5% of the number of study samples and are representative of the observed 
concentration.
For each subject, all periods were analyzed within the same analytical run.
Reanalysis of samples (free dabigatran: 7/3817 samples: 0.18%, total dabigatran: 199/3817 samples: 
5.2%) was performed for analytical reasons including inconsistent internal standard response, 
incomplete analysis  and rejected analytical run. 
Incurred sample reanalysis (249/3817 samples: 6.5% for free dabigatran and total dabigatran, 
respectively) was performed to confirm the reproducibility of the bioanalytical method. A total of 
99.6% (free dabigatran) and 98.4% (total dabigatran) of samples were found to be within a variation 
of 20% from the mean value, respectively.

The maximum sample storage period from the first blood draw to last analysis was 62 days at -
70±15°C (free dabigatran) and 60 days at -70±15°C (total dabigatran). The sample storage periods 
were supported by long term stability data of the analytes in the matrix (free dabigatran: 107 days at 
20±10°C and -70±15°C, total dabigatran: 101 days at 20±10°C and -70±15°C) at LQC and HQC 
concentrations.
Protocol deviations: No SOP deviations occured during method validation or subject sample analysis.
Laboratory investigation -Total dabigatran: In analytical runs 65321-AR002A (S1) and 65321-
AR003A (S2), Dabigatran Acyl Glucuronide peak was observed in all the subject samples which 
indicated glucuronide was not converted into Dabigatran. 
The samples of subject 3 were processed with the samples of subjects 1 and 2 but not analysed when 
the issue was discovered. A laboratory investigation was conducted to identfy the cause, which 
concluded that a solution preparation error had occured during the initial analysis of S1, S2 and S3. 
New solutions were prepared and the repeated results of the subjects did not reveal any glucuronide 
peak and the results were accepted.
QA authentication: QA statements and assurance for the bioanalytical reports and method validations 
report have been provided confirming compliance with FDA and EMA guidance, SOPs and applicable 
sections of GLP.
 Pharmacokinetic variables
The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using standard methods and a non-compartmental 
approach. AUCt was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. Actual sampling times were used for 
calculation of the PK parameters.
 Choice of primary variables and secondary PK variables:
The parameters calculated were AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, AUCt/AUC∞, Cmax, tmax, Kel, t½ el and residual area
Primary parameters: AUC0-t and Cmax
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023 
Page 40/56
 The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using Phoenix® WinNonlin® Software Version 8.3.
 Statistical methods
PROC GLM of SAS Studio 3.6 (Basic edition) was employed for statistical analysis. 
ANOVA was performed on the ln-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax of free dabigatran and total 
dabigatran.
The ANOVA model included treatment received, the period at which it was given along with the 
sequence in which each treatment being received and the subject effect (nested within the sequence). 
The treatment, period and sequence were set as fixed effects and tested at 5% level of significance.
The significance of the sequence effect at alpha 0.10 was calculated using the subject nested within 
the sequence as the error term.  
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence:
Bioequivalence between the test product and reference product is concluded if the 90% confidence 
intervals for geometric least square mean ratios of ln-transformed Cmax and AUCt of free dabigatran fall 
within the bioequivalence range. For AUC0-t acceptance range is 80.00-125.00%. Depending on the 
intra-subject variability for Cmax of the reference product, a widened acceptance range is applied for 
Cmax as follows:

2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application.>
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects
The design of the studies is considered acceptable by CHMP and in line with the general guidelines. 
A replicate design is acceptable to demonstrate bioequivalence between the test product and reference 
product given the expected high intra-subject CV of Cmax of the latter providing the possibility of 
widening the acceptance criterion of Cmax.
The sampling schedules included frequent sampling around the expected Cmax and were adequate to 
cover the absorption process of dabigatran. The wash out periods were adequate considering the 
elimination half-lives. 
Adequate information on the processing as well as handling of samples from the clinical site to the 
bioanalytical site have been presented.
The chosen test product is representative in terms of composition, manufacturer, manufacturing 
process and batch size. Production scale batch sizes are up to 150,000 capsules for each strength. The 
reference product Pradaxa, 150 mg, capsule, hard is considered adequate (EU reference product). 
Satisfactory certificates of analysis of the test and reference products have been presented since the 
assay of the test product does not differ more than 5% from that of the reference product.
The study populations are considered adequate by CHMP. The inclusion and exclusion criteria of the 
studies have been adequately described. Adequate information on the sample size calculations 
performed have been presented. Concomitant medication has not affected the outcome of the studies 
since the analytical methods have been demonstrated to be selective to the analytes.
The analytical methods for free dabigatran and total dabigatran have been adequately validated (pre-
study and within study). LLOQ was less than 5% of Cmax for the detection of any pre-dose 
concentration of free dabigatran and total dabigatran. The QC concentrations sufficiently covered the 
study sample concentration range of free dabigatran and total dabigatran. The reasons for the 
reanalysis of samples are acceptable. 20% of the chromatograms of the analysis of study samples 
have been provided.
The primary pharmacokinetic variables of free dabigatran and total dabigatran are adequate to 
conclude on bioequivalence. Standard methods were used.
The statistical methods have been adequately described by the applicant.
While the guidance does not specify that data of free and total dabigatran (sum of free and 
glucuronidated dabigatran) of the test and reference products be used for the assessment of 
bioequivalence, the sponsor opted for assessment of bioequivalence based on both analytes in initially 
submitted studies. For the additional study (65321) the assessment of bioequivalence was based on 
free dabigatran.
All studies confirmed high intra-subject variability of Cmax for the test and reference product for free 
dabigatran and total dabigatran. Widened acceptance criteria were not necessary as all results fell 
within the conventional acceptance criteria of 80.00-125.00% for Cmax.
The 90% CI of the ratio for geometric least square means of log-transformed data of AUC0-t and Cmax 
for free dabigatran and total dabigatran of the test product and reference product fell within the 
conventional acceptance criterion of 80.00-125.00% for subjects under fasted condition and under 
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023 
Page 46/56
conditions of pre-treatment with a PPI with the 150 mg strength. Furthermore, the 90% CI of the ratio 
for geometric least square means of log-transformed data of AUC0-t and Cmax for free dabigatran of 
the test product and reference product fell within the conventional acceptance criterion of 80.00-
125.00% for subjects under fasted conditions with the 75 mg strength.
CHMP concluded that bioequivalence has been demonstrated in all studies. 
The extrapolated AUC was below 20% for all subjects and treatments indicating that the blood 
sampling was adequately long with respect to free dabigatran and total dabigatran.
No pre-dose concentrations were detected. In study 605/19 no subjects reached tmax at the first 
sampling point (first point Cmax). For study 606/19 in 3 cases tmax was observed at the first sampling 
point with quantifiable analyte (regarded as first point Cmax). However, the sampling schedule 
includes frequent sampling around the expected Cmax to provide a reliable estimate of peak exposure 
since at least two quantifiable samples are obtained before tmax is reached in the overwhelming 
majority of cases. For study 65321 No pre-dose concentrations were detected, and no subjects 
reached tmax at the first sampling point (first point Cmax).
Regarding safety data collected from these studies, the adverse advents have been adequately 
analysed including incidence by treatment, relation with investigational medicinal product, intensity 
and time of onset and resolution.
The inspection history of the clinical and bioanalytical sites has been provided. The sites are familiar 
with inspections as they have been inspected regularly by various inspectorates for the past 10 years. 
The outcome of the MHRA inspection conducted in 2019 of the sites involved in the studies was 
provided during the procedure. There are no findings which raise concerns with regards to the integrity 
of the clinical, analytical and statistical aspects of the bioequivalence studies.
With regards to the biowaiver of strengths, in vitro dissolution among the biobatch of the highest 
strength (150 mg) and the additional strengths (110 mg and 75 mg) has been submitted in pH 2.0, 
4.5 and 6.8 performed under same conditions, i.e. modified baskets at 100 rpm. 
Due to degradation of the active substance, dabigatran, the applicant has justified that pH 1.2 is not a 
suitable condition for dissolution comparison. This is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Due to the high variability in the dissolution data the 90% CI of expected f2 was obtained by 
bootstrapping and the calculations were conducted with the software package PhEq.
The comparison between the biobatch high strength of 150 mg and the intermediate strength of 110 
mg shows similar dissolution profiles at pH 2.0, 4.5 and 6.8 since the lower boundary of the 90% CI of 
expected f2 is >50.
The comparison between the biobatch high strength of 150 mg and the low strength of 75 mg shows 
similar dissolution profiles at 4.5 and 6.8 since the lower boundary of the 90% CI of expected f2 is 
>50. However, at pH 2.0 the lower boundary of the 90% CI of expected f2 is <50. Consequently, the 
applicant applied a bracketing approach. 
According to the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence, bracketing approach would include, 
in the present case, four studies: in fasted state and in fasted state with pre-treatment with a PPI for 
the two strengths most different in dissolution profiles, in this case the 75 mg and 150 mg strengths. 
However, the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence indicates that when 4 studies are needed 
in a bracketing approach, i.e. two strengths in fasted and fed state, one of the studies can be waived if 
justified: Waiver of either the fasting or the fed study at the other strength(s) may be justified based 
on previous knowledge and/or pharmacokinetic data from the study conducted at the strength tested 
Assessment report 
EMA/182457/2023

in both fasted and fed state. The condition selected (fasting or fed) to test the other strength(s) should 
be the one which is most sensitive to detect a difference between products. 
Based on the submitted dissolution data, the extremes of the brackets (i.e. the high strength and the 
low strength) are the strengths differing most in dissolution rate. Furthermore, the applicant has 
justified that the study under fasting conditions is the most sensitive one as the dissolution profiles 
that differ the most are the ones under fasting conditions (pH 2.0). The bracketing approach is 
therefore considered acceptable by CHMP and a biowaiver for the study with 75 mg under fasting 
conditions with pre-treatment with PPI can be granted. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects
CHMP concluded that based on the presented bioequivalence studies Dabigatran Etexilate Accord is 
considered bioequivalent with Pradaxa.
The results of studies 605/19 and 606/19 with 150 mg formulation can be extrapolated to the middle 
strength (110 mg), according to conditions presented in the Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1, section 4.1.6. 
Furthermore, similarity was demonstrated between the 150 mg strength and 75 mg strength at pH 4.5 
and pH 6.8 but due to dissimilarity in dissolution rate between the 150 mg strength and 75 mg 
strength at pH 2.0 a bracketing approach was necessary. With the additional study conducted with 75 
mg strength under fasting condition (study no. 65321), bioequivalence was demonstrated between the 
test and reference products for the lowest strength under the most sensitive conditions. In addition, 
the extremes of the brackets (i.e. the high strength and the low strength) are the strengths differing 
most in dissolution rate, consequently, the bracketing approach is considered acceptable and a 
biowaiver for the study with 75 mg under fasting conditions with pre-treatment with PPI can be 
granted.

-
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation 
(NVAF), with one or more risk factors, such as prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA); 
age ≥ 75 years; heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ II); diabetes mellitus; hypertension.
-
-
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of 
recurrent DVT and PE in adults
Treatment of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) and prevention of recurrent VTE in 
paediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age.
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient.
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated with the 150 mg strength between the test product and 
reference product in subjects under fasting conditions (study 605/19) and in subjects pre-treated with 
a proton inhibitor under fasting conditions (study 606/19) in line with the product-specific 
bioequivalence guidance (12/2018) for dabigatran etexilate 75 mg, 110 mg, 150 mg, capsule, hard. 
Moreover, bioequivalence has been shown appropriately with 75 mg strength between the test product 
and reference product in subjects under fasting conditions (study 65321). Therefore, CHMP considered 
the bracketing approach acceptable and the biowaiver of strengths is granted.
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

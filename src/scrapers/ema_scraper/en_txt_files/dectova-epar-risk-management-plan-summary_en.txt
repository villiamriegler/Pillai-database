SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR DECTOVA 
(INTRAVENOUS ZANAMIVIR) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for DECTOVA. The RMP details 
important risks of DECTOVA, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about DECTOVA's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
DECTOVA's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package/patient information 
leaflet (PIL) give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how 
DECTOVA should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for DECTOVA should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
DECTOVA's RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Dectova is indicated for the treatment of complicated and potentially life-threatening 
influenza A or B virus infection in adult and paediatric patients (aged ≥6 months) when: 
•
The patient’s influenza virus is known or suspected to be resistant to anti-influenza
agents other than zanamivir, and/or
• Other anti-viral agents for treatment of influenza, including inhaled zanamivir, are not
suitable for the individual patient.
Dectova should be used in accordance with official guidance. 
Further information about the evaluation of DECTOVA’s benefits can be found in 
DECTOVA’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage:  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/summaries-opinion/dectova
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks 
Important risks of DECTOVA, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about DECTOVA's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•
•
•
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in
the PIL and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure
that the medicine is used correctly;
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment - so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of DECTOVA is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of DECTOVA are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of DECTOVA. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. 
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected.

II.B 
Summary of important risks 
Important potential risk – Cardiac reactions (cardiac arrhythmias) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The evidence for a causal association between IV zanamivir and cardiac 
arrhythmias is limited. There are in total 55 cases of arrhythmias 
reported, most reported in the CUP, but also three serious treatment-
related cases in Phase II and Phase III trials.  
“Cardiac arrhythmias” is an adverse drug reaction stated in the SmPC for 
oseltamivir (Tamiflu SmPC). However, the scientific evidence for this is 
not apparent in the published literature, and there is insufficient evidence 
to suggest a class effect. 
Persons of any age with chronic cardiac disease (e.g. congestive cardiac 
failure) are at risk of complicated influenza which can result in 
exacerbation of their underlying illness.  
Cardiovascular involvement in influenza can occur through direct effects 
of the virus on the myocardium presenting as myocardititis, with 
associated electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, or through exacerbation of 
existing cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular mortality is increased 
during influenza seasons in those patients with pre-existing coronary 
artery disease, and myocardial infarction rates have also been shown to 
increase during epidemics. 
Risk minimisation measures 
None 
Important potential risk - Severe cutaneous reactions 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Post-marketing  experience  with  the  inhaled  powder  formulation  of 
zanamivir  (RELENZA);  DECTOVA  clinical  trials;  zanamivir  aqueous 
solution Compassionate Use Programme (CUP). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Severe skin reactions associated with RELENZA have been reported in 
the post-marketing period. These included Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
(SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), erythema multiforme, bullous 
dermatitis and toxic skin eruption. 
Severe cutaneous reactions are known to be triggered by infectious 
agents. Therefore, patients with influenza and patients with concomitant 
infections may be at greater risk. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk communication: 
SmPC 4.4 and 4.8; PIL section 2 and 4 
 
 
 
 
Important potential risk - Hepatic failure 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Hepatic failure cases (N=5) have been reported in the CUP and 
assessed by the investigator as related to zanamivir. All cases were 
confounded by concomitant severe illness and concurrent medications. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Increased liver function tests were reported in subjects receiving 
DECTOVA zanamivir across Phase I, II and III studies.  
Hepatic events have been primarily associated with DECTOVA 
(intravenous zanamivir), which has high systemic availability relative to 
RELENZA (zanamivir inhalation powder). DECTOVA is indicated for 
critically-ill hospitalised patients with complicated influenza, who may be 
at greater risk of hepatic events due to serious co-morbidities. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk communication: SmPC section 4.8 and PIL section 4. 
Important potential risk - Neuropsychiatric events 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Spontaneous reports with RELENZA; Literature articles. 
Based on spontaneous reports with RELENZA, children and adolescents 
were identified as being at particular risk of neuropsychiatric events, 
particularly early in the influenza illness, and especially with concurrent 
pyrexia and/or influenza encephalopathy/encephalitis or underlying 
psychiatric disorder. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk communication: 
SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8; PIL section 2 and 4 
Important potential risk - Antiviral resistance 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Post-authorisation  RELENZA epidemiology study (OTH112321); clinical 
trials with DECTOVA; case studies in the medical literature for RELENZA 
and  zanamivir  aqueous  solution 
the  Compassionate  Use 
programme.  
from 
To date, selection of resistance substitutions is rare and there is no 
evidence of emergence of clinically relevant resistance. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Immunocompromised patients, off-label use. 
Risk minimisation measures

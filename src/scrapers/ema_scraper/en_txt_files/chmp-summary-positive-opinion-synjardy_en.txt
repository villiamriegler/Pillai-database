Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Synjardy 
empagliflozin / metformin 
On 26 March 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Synjardy, 
intended for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The applicant for this medicinal product is 
Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH. 
Synjardy will be available as 5 mg/850 mg, 5 mg/1000 mg, 12.5 mg/850 mg and 12.5 mg/1000 mg 
film-coated tablets.  
The active substances of Synjardy are empagliflozin and metformin, blood glucose-lowering agents 
(ATC code: A10BD20). Empagliflozin blocks a protein in the kidney, the sodium-glucose 
co-transporter-2 (SGLT2). This action reduces glucose re-absorption in the kidney, leading to glucose 
excretion in the urine and thereby lowering levels of glucose in the blood. Metformin works, among 
other ways, by suppressing glucose production by the liver. 
The benefits with Synjardy are its ability to improve glycaemic control. Metformin is considered  
first-line treatment, especially in overweight/obese patients. Empagliflozin added to metformin has 
been shown to confer an additional clinically relevant improvement in glycaemic control, thus 
justifying the combination of these substances. 
The most common side effects of metformin are gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite, as well as taste disturbance. The most common side 
effects of empagliflozin are hypoglycaemia (when used with sulphonylurea or insulin), genital and 
urinary tract infections, pruritus and increased urination. 
The full indication is: 
“Treatment of adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and 
exercise to improve glycaemic control

made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

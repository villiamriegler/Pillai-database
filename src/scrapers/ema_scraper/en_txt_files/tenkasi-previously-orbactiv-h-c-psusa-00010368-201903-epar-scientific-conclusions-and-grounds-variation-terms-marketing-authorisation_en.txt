Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for oritavancin, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Section 4.4 of the Oritavancin SmPC includes a warning concerning risk of hypersensitivity reactions, to 
monitor early symptoms of such reactions and to take appropriate actions if necessary. Hypersensitivity 
reactions are listed in the section 4.8. However, further SmPC and PL update is considered necessary to 
add information about the risk of anaphylactic reactions and anaphylactic shock. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for oritavancin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing oritavancin is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

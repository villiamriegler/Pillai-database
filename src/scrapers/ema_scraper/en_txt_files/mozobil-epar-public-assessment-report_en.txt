SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
3.1 
Introduction 
Haematopoietic Progenitor Stem Cell Transplantation in NHL and MM 
Patients  with  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL)  and  multiple  myeloma  (MM)  may  be  treated  with 
high-dose  chemotherapy,  which  is  myelosuppressive  or  myeloablative  and  requires  reinfusion  of 
HSCs to repopulate the bone marrow and regenerate trilineage blood cells (red blood cells, platelets, 
neutrophils). The HSCs used for reinfusion (transplantation) can be harvested from the bone marrow, 
cord blood or peripheral blood, and can be autologous (from the patient) or allogeneic (from a donor).  
A  number  of  factors  such  as  disease  type,  ability  to  harvest  cells  from  the  patient,  and  donor 
availability contribute to the decision of autologous versus allogeneic transplantation. Since the 1980s, 
autologous  transplantation  of  HSCs  has  become  a  widely  used  strategy  for  haematologic  and 
immunologic recovery subsequent to high-dose chemotherapy for haematological malignancies, with 
approximately 80% of autologous transplants for the indications of MM, NHL. 
In the case of autologous transplantation, the use of peripheral blood as a HSC source is preferred to 
bone marrow due to the ease of harvesting and less likelihood of tumour cell contamination (Lopez, 
1997, Blood; Gribben, 1994, Blood).  
During steady-state homeostasis the levels of HSCs in the peripheral circulation are low with a CD34+ 
cell count of ≤5 cells/µL representing <0.05% of white blood cells (WBCs).Therefore, the cells have 
to  be  “mobilized”  from  the  bone  marrow,  where  they  normally  reside,  into  the  peripheral  blood. 
Mobilization  of  cells  from  the  bone  marrow  into  the  peripheral  blood  can  be  accomplished  by 
treatment with chemotherapy, cytokines (usually G-CSF which is the most frequently used cytokine 
for  HSC  mobilization),  or  chemokines,  either  alone  or  in  combination.  The  minimum  number  of 
CD34+  cells  required  for  successful  autologous  transplantation  is  considered  to  be  2  ×  106  cells/kg 
(Gazitt,  1999,  J  Hematotherapy;  Tricot,  1995,  Blood;  Bender,  1992,  J  Hematotherapy),  although 
higher target cell counts of 5 × 106 cells/kg result in earlier cell engraftment than transplantation with 
lower cell doses (Shpall, 1998, Biol Blood Marrow Transplant). Peripheral blood CD34+ (PB CD34+) 
cell count has been shown to correlate positively with apheresis yield (Schwella, 1996, J Clin Oncol; 
Haas,  1994,  Blood).Timing  to  peak  mobilization  of  HSCs  into  the  peripheral  blood  depends  on  the 
mobilization  regimen  used.  Peak  mobilization  after  G-CSF  alone  usually  occurs  4  to  5  days  after 
initiation  of  G-CSF  (Körbling,  2004,  Clinical  Bone  Marrow  and  Blood  Stem  Cell  Transplantation), 
while  peak  mobilization  following  chemotherapy-based  regimens  is  more  variable  and  generally 
occurs 7 to 14 days after last dose of chemotherapy. Due to the difficulty in predicting accurately the 
peak response of chemotherapy-based mobilization, daily blood samples need to be taken to measure 
the PB CD34+ count, particularly if chemotherapy is used alone for mobilization, in order to assess 
whether apheresis should be performed. 
4/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A significant proportion of patients may not be able to mobilize a sufficient or target number of cells 
for  transplantation(s)  with  current  HSC  mobilization  regimens,  including  cytokines  with  or  without 
chemotherapy. These patients require multiple mobilizations, thus increasing associated costs and the 
potential of disease progression between the first and subsequent mobilization attempts. Furthermore, 
while  potentially  effective  for  HSC  mobilization  and  treatment  of  the  underlying  malignancy, 
chemotherapy  is  associated  with  multiple  risks  such  as  febrile  neutropenia,  infection,  and  bleeding 
which require treatment and may require hospitalization and could be avoided if another effective 
mobilization regimen were used (Filshie, 2002, Current Pharmaceutical Design). 
The Medicinal Product 
Plerixafor (Mozobil) is a small-molecule bicyclam derivative that reversibly antagonizes the CXCR4 
chemokine receptor and blocks binding of its cognate ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α, 
also  known  as  CXCL12).  The  mechanism  of  action  of  plerixafor  involves  interruption  of  the 
CXCR4/SDF-1α interaction resulting in mobilization of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) positive for 
cell surface glycoprotein CD34 (CD34+ cells) to the peripheral blood where they can be collected for 
HSC transplantation.  
Plerixafor is a bicyclam derivative, a selective reversible antagonist of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor 
and  blocks  binding  of  its  cognate  ligand,  stromal  cell-derived  factor-1α  (SDF-1α),  also  known  as 
CXCL12. Plerixafor-induced leukocytosis and elevations in circulating haematopoietic progenitor cell 
levels are thought to result from a disruption of CXCR4 binding to its cognate ligand, resulting in the 
appearance of both mature and pluripotent haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the systemic 
circulation. CD34+ cells mobilised by plerixafor are functional and capable of engraftment with long-
term repopulating capacity. The proposed indication for Mozobil is as follows Mozobil is indicated in 
combination with G-CSF to enhance mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood 
for  collection  and  subsequent  autologous  transplantation  in  patients  with  lymphoma  and  multiple 
myeloma  whose  cells  mobilise  poorly  (see  section  4.2).The  recommended  dose  of  Mozobil  is 
0.24 mg/kg body weight/day. It should be administered by subcutaneous injection 6 to 11 hours prior 
to  initiation  of  apheresis  following  4  day  pre-treatment  with  G-CSF.  In  clinical  trials,  Mozobil  has 
been  commonly  used  for  2  to  4  (and  up to  7)  consecutive  days.  Based  on increasing  exposure  with 
increasing body weight, the plerixafor dose should not exceed 40 mg/day.  In pivotal clinical studies 
supporting  the  use  of  Mozobil,  all  patients  received  daily  morning  doses  of  10 µg/kg  G-CSF  for  4 
consecutive days prior to the first dose of plerixafor and on each morning prior to apheresis.  
3.2  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Composition 
Mozobil  is  a  sterile,  preservative-free,  clear,  colourless  to  pale  yellow,  isotonic,  solution  for 
subcutaneous injection containing plerixafor as the active substance in a concentration of 20 mg/ml. 
Each  vial  is  filled  to  deliver  1.2  ml  of  solution  containing  24.0  mg  of  plerixafor.  The  vials  are 
overfilled with 0.25 ± 0.10 ml to a target volume of 1.45 ml in order to allow the withdrawal of the 
labelled volume, 1.2 ml.Other ingredients include sodium chloride, water for injections, hydrochloric 
acid and/or if needed for the pH adjustment also sodium hydroxide, if needed for pH adjustment. 
The product is packed in single-use, 2 ml, Type I clear glass vials, stoppered with grey chlorobutyl 
rubber stoppers and sealed with aluminium cap seals. 
Active Substance 
chemical 
1,1′-[1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)]bis-1,4,8,11-
The 
tetraazacyclotetradecane. It has eight basic amine functional groups, which show four pKa values in 
the 8.5 to 11.5 range and four pKa values at less than 2.4. The active substance is a white to off-white 
plerixafor 
name 
of 
is 
5/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
crystalline solid, slightly soluble in water and saline, freely soluble in alcohols, glycol, and aqueous 
solutions of less than pH 10. 
Plerixafor is  an  achiral  molecule, isolated  as  a  single  crystalline form,  which  is  highly  hygroscopic. 
The available data show that no stereo-isomers are found and no evidence of polymorphism has been 
observed by x-ray powder diffraction. 
The  chemical structure of plerixafor has been confirmed through a combination of elemental analysis, 
Fourier  transform  infrared  spectroscopy,  1H  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR),  13C  NMR, 
distortionless  enhancement  by  polarisation  transfer  NMR,  mass  spectroscopy  and  ultraviolet 
spectroscopy. In all cases the obtained spectra support the proposed structure of plerixafor.  
Manufacture 
• 
Plerixafor  is  synthesised  from  the  starting  materials  in  the  following  four  steps;  Cyclam  protection; 
alkylition,  where  protected  cyclam  units  are  linked  together;  de-protection  and  purification.  The 
synthetic  process  has  been  sufficiently  described,  the  critical  steps  have  been  identified  and 
appropriate in-process controls have been set. The analytical methods used for in-process testing are 
suitable  and  set  specifications  are  adequately  ensuring  the  quality  and  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process. 
There are four process related impurities  that result from undesired reactions during the manufacture 
of plerixafor. Another observed impurity is a by-product generated during the de-protection reaction. 
Based on the maximal daily plerixafor dose the impurity limits do not exceed the limits determined in 
the relevant guidelines (ICH Q3A, Q3C and EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4446/2000) and are supported by the 
results of toxicological studies. The solvents used have been shown to be efficiently removed during 
the purification and drying operations.    
Batch  analysis  data  from  multiple plerixafor  batches  (development,  stability  and  clinical)  have  been 
provided. The  data show  that in  all cases  all process  control parameters  were within  the  acceptance 
limits and that the synthetic process is robust and can reproducibly produce an active substance that 
will comply with the pre-defined specifications. 
Specification 
• 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  colour  of  solution  (Ph.Eur), 
identification (FTIR, HPLC),  related impurities (HPLC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur), heavy metals 
(Ph. Eur), water content (Karl-Fischer),  organic volatile impurities (GC), microbial limit test (Ph. Eur) 
and  bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur). 
Stability 
• 
Stability studies have been performed in accordance with ICH requirements. Samples from  multiple 
batches have been stored at long term conditions (25 ± 2°C / 60 ± 5% RH) for up to 36 months and at 
accelerated conditions (40 ± 2°C / 75 ± 5%RH) for up to 9 months. 
The  parameters  tested  were  appearance,  identification,  assay,  specified  and  unspecified  impurities,  , 
water content, bacterial endotoxins and microbiological counts. In all cases the data were within the 
predefined acceptance criteria. 
In  addition  forced  degradation  studies  were  performed  to  identify  potential  degradation  products  of 
plerixafor. The conditions studied included elevated temperature, elevated temperature and humidity, 
elevated temperature and strong acid, elevated temperature and strong base, oxidation, and light. Very 
minimal degradation was observed in most of the conditions studied. Increased levels of degradation 
have only been observed under severe stress conditions.  
The  results  from  photostability  studies  also  show  that  plerixafor  is  not  photosensitive  and  does  not 
require special protection against light exposure. However, the current packaging which is necessary 
as a moisture barrier also prevents exposure to light. 
6/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  conclusion,  the  stability  studies  results  provided  support  the  proposed  retest  period  and  storage 
conditions. 
Medicinal Product 
• 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Significant  changes  during  the  development  of  Mozobil  have  included:  change  in  route  of 
administration  (IV  to  subcutaneous  due  to  change  of  indication),  change  of  concentration  with 
concomitant changes in excipient concentrations as well as change to fill volume (due to finalization 
of dose), and change in container closure system from ampoule to vial. The manufacturing process and 
formulation of pivotal clinical batches and the intended product could be considered essentially similar 
The excipients and diluents used in formulation are commonly used compendial materials described in 
Ph. Eur. Their compatibility (chemical or physical)  with the active substance has been demonstrated 
with long-term stability studies. 
Plerixafor  injection  is  a  sterile  product,  terminally  sterilised  by  a  validated  moist  heat  sterilisation 
cycle  in  an  autoclave.  Since  the  product  is  intended  to  be  administered  in  a  single  dose  format  no 
preservative is added to the formulation. 
The effectiveness of the container closure system to provide an integral barrier that prevents microbial 
contamination  of  the  product,  has  been  demonstrated  with  container  closure  integrity  tests.  Also  a 
detailed evaluation of leachables/extractable testing has been provided that showed no major risk of 
leachables during the manufacture of the finished product. 
Manufacture of the Product 
• 
The  manufacturing  process  is a  standard  process for these  kinds  of  formulations  and consists  of the 
following steps: compounding; filtration; vial filling; terminal sterilisation and analysis.The process is 
operated under nitrogen atmosphere until just prior to the filtration step.  
The manufacturing process has been adequately validated according to relevant European guidelines. 
Process  validation  data  on  the  product  has  been  presented  for  three  full-scale  batches.  All  critical 
process parameters have been identified and controlled by appropriate in process controls. A validated 
maximum holding time limit between the end of bulk filtration and terminal sterilisation has been set. 
The  validation  report  demonstrates  that  the  process  is  reproducible  and  consistently  provides  a 
finished product that complies with the in-process and finished product specifications. 
Product Specification 
• 
The  specification  for  the  finished  product  at  release  and  shelf  life  includes  tests  for  appearance, 
identification (HPLC, FTIR), assay and degradation products (HPLC), pH (Ph. Eur.),  osmolality (Ph. 
Eur.),  volume  in  container  (Ph.  Eur.),  particulate  matter  (Ph.  Eur.),  sterility  (Ph.  Eur.)  and  bacterial 
endotoxins.  
All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated/qualified. Batch 
analysis  data  from  the  proposed  production  site  have  been  provided  on  multiple  full-scaled  batches 
demonstrating compliance with the release specification. 
Stability of the Product 
• 
Stability  studies  were  carried  out  on  multiple  production  scale  batches  according  to  the  ICH 
requirements. The batches were produced in accordance with the proposed manufacturing method and 
were  presented  in  the  proposed  commercial  packaging.  The  studies  were  ongoing,  but  data  were 
presented  for  samples    stored  at  25°C/60%  RH  for  12  months,  at  30°/65%  RH    for  9  months  and 
40°C/75% RH for 9 months.  
Supporting stability data were also available for multiple batches with a slightly larger fill volume (1.7 
ml) presented in the proposed commercial vial and stored for more than 24 months at 25°C/60% RH. 
7/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The parameters tested were clarity and colour (visual), identification, assay, impurities, pH, osmolality 
and particulate matter. In all cases the results were within the specifications. No degradation products 
or significant trends were observed. Therefore the stability studies results support the proposed shelf 
life for the commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SPC. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects. 
The quality of Mozobil is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical 
documentation has been submitted for marketing authorization. There are no major deviations from 
EU and ICH requirements. 
The  active  substance  is  well  characterised  and  documented.  The  excipients  are  commonly  used  in 
these  types  of  formulations  and  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  requirements.  The  packaging  material  is 
commonly used and well documented. The manufacturing process of the finished product is a terminal 
sterilisation process that fulfils the Ph.Eur. requirements. Stability tests indicate that the product under 
ICH guidelines conditions is chemically stable for the proposed shelf life. 
3.3 
Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The non-clinical  studies  submitted  by  the  applicant included  primary  pharmacodynamics,  secondary 
pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology programme, pharmacokinetics, single dose toxicity studies, 
repeat  dose  toxicity  studies,  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity,  reproductive  toxicity,  toxicokinetic  data, 
local tolerance and an ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment. 
Pharmacology 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
Both in vivo and in vitro primary pharmacology studies were submitted. In vitro pharmacology studies 
were designed to evaluate the activity of plerixafor as a selective inhibitor of the chemokine receptor 
CXCR4. In vivo primary pharmacodynamic studies were designed to identify whether plerixafor was 
capable of mobilising HSC and HPC cells in multiple species, and that those mobilised cells were able 
to re-engraft in the bone marrow leading to long-term, durable reconstitution of haematopoiesis.  
A series of in vitro studies showed the activity of plerixafor at the human CXCR4 receptor. Using the 
CCRF-CEM cell line which endogenously expresses CXCR4, plerixafor was shown to potently inhibit 
(i.e.,  nM  range)  SDF-1  α  ligand  binding  to  CXCR4,  and  SDF-1α-mediated  calcium  flux,  G-protein 
activation, and chemotaxis. 
Receptor selectivity was confirmed by demonstrating lack of inhibition of ligand-induced calcium flux 
and/or ligand binding for a series of chemokine receptors (CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR7, CCR1, 
CCR2b, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, BLT1) either in cells naturally expressing 
the receptors or in transfected cell lines expressing recombinant receptor. 
The molecular interactions of plerixafor with the CXCR4 chemokine receptor were investigated using 
receptor  site  directed  mutagenesis  studies.  Receptor  mutagenesis  identified  Asp171  and  Asp262  as 
being essential for the ability of plerixafor to block the binding of the receptor antibody, 125I-12G5 
anti-CXCR4, and SDF-1. 
The ability of plerixafor to mobilise haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) and HSC from the bone 
marrow to blood was shown in mice. The administration of a single SC injection of plerixafor induced 
a  rapid  and  dose-dependent  mobilisation  of  progenitor  cells  from  the  bone  marrow  with  peak 
8/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mobilisation  occurring  at  1  hour  post  dosing.  Repeat  daily  dosing  (3  days)  with  plerixafor  gave 
consistent HPC mobilisation after each dose, indicating that there was no desensitisation with repeated 
administration. Plerixafor was also shown to be a potent HPC mobiliser in strains where G-CSF is a 
poor  HPC  mobiliser.  Plerixafor  was  shown  to  augment  G-CSF-induced  mobilisation.  The  bone 
marrow was confirmed as the site of action of plerixafor in a study in mice in which the femoral bone 
marrow  was  directly  perfused  in  situ  with  plerixafor,  followed  by  quantification  of  stem  and 
progenitor cells in the perfusate. 
The repopulating potential of plerixafor-, G-CSF-, and plerixafor plus G-CSF-mobilised murine low 
density mononuclear cells (LDMC) obtained from C57BL/6 mice in lethally irradiated B6BoyJ mice 
and of human CD34+ cells in a myeloablated non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency 
disease (NOD/SCID) mouse repopulation assay, was shown.  
Furthermore,  the  ability  of  plerixafor  to  mobilise  CD34+  stem  cells  which, following  autologous  or 
allogeneic  transplantation,  result  in  timely  and  durable  engraftment  and  reconstitution  of  the  bone 
marrow has been shown in myeloablated dog and monkey models.  
In general, the primary pharmacodynamic data are considered sufficient to support the indication, but 
a question is asked on the comparability of the HSC and HPC mobilised by plerixafor combined with 
G-CSF, since some studies suggest that there may differences in characteristics of mobilised cells. 
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Several  exploratory  studies  were  conducted  to  investigate  the  effect  of  CXCR4  inhibition,  using 
plerixafor  as  a  CXCR4  antagonist,  in  models  of  disease  where  the  SDF  1/CXCR4  axis  has  been 
implicated  in  disease  pathogenesis,  different  from  the  indication  of  the  present  application.  These 
studies  provided  some  insight  in  potential  effects  of  plerixafor  in  CXCR4  related  diseases.  They 
included:  1)  antiviral  activity  against  T-tropic,  CXCR-4-using  strains  of  HIV,  2)  mobilisation  of 
pluripotent  stem  cells  to  sites  of  damage  to  induce  tissue  repair;  3)  the  anti-inflammatory  effect 
resulting  from  inhibition  of  the  chemo-attractant  effect  of  SDF-1;  and  4)  anticancer  activity.  The 
anticancer studies were conducted with plerixafor in various tumour  models: Plerixafor in vitro was 
shown  to  (a)  inhibit  SDF-1  induced  migration  or  (b)  have  antiproliferative  effects  in  a  number  of 
tumour cell lines. (c) Plerixafor was also shown to inhibit tumour growth in in vivo  models of non-
Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL),  glioblastoma  and  medulloblastoma.  (d)  Treatment  with  plerixafor 
enhanced  the  anti-tumour  effect  of  cytarabine  (AraC)  in  a  transgenic  mouse  model  of  acute 
promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) 
•  Safety pharmacology programme 
Central nervous system: Radioligand binding studies with a range of CNS receptors revealed evidence 
of  moderate  affinity  of  plerixafor  for  α1-  and  α2-adrenergic  and  D1-dopaminergic  receptors  (pKi 
values of 5.5-6.9). Based on these in vitro data, in vivo inhibition of noradrenergic and dopaminergic 
receptors cannot be excluded. Three behavioural/CNS primary observation tests were provided, one in 
mice and two in rats. All three studies indicate behavioural/CNS effects shortly after administration of 
doses in the range 5-20 mg/kg.  
Respiratory system: A single subcutaneous injection of plerixafor at doses of 2 - 20 mg/kg in male rats 
caused a dose related decrease of tidal volume and respiration rate.  
Cardiovascular  system:  In  vitro  data:  A  hERG  channel  assay  revealed  no  evidence  of  significant 
inhibition  of  Ikr.  In  an  enzyme  assay  testing  the  affinity  of  plerixafor  for  angiotensin  converting 
enzyme,  an  IC50  value  of  (probably)  2.5  µM  was  found,  which  is  only  little  above  the  reported 
therapeutic concentration in humans. Significant agonistic activity was found for neuropeptide Y2 and 
Y3 receptors at 6 and 18 µM and moderate agonistic activity for neuropeptide Y1 receptors at 18 µM. 
Dose  dependent  antagonism  of  angiotensin-II  induced  contractions  in  primary  rat  aortic  smooth 
muscle cell cultures was found at 2 – 20 µg/ml.  
9/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cardiovascular system. In vivo studies: In anesthetised rats, at 10 mg/kg i.v. a dramatic fall of arterial 
blood pressure, heart rate, +dP/dt, -dP/dt and cardiac output occurred, and systemic vascular resistance 
increased.  At  1  mg/kg  i.v.  smaller  effects  on  cardiovascular  parameters  occurred.  Subcutaneous 
administration  of  20  mg/kg  induced  moderate  decrease  of  mean  arterial  blood  pressure,  heart  rate, 
+dP/dt, -dP/dt and cardiac output. Visual inspection of the ECG showed that the P wave became flat, 
negative,  or  undetectable  in  4  of  5  animals  after  treatment.  Intravenous  infusion  of  5-10  mg/kg/hr 
plerixafor in dogs resulted in increased heart rates, possibly due to stress. No ECG changes were seen 
in dogs. 
Endocrine system:  In  a  subcutaneous  rat  study  increased levels  of  prolactin and  corticosterone  were 
found 1 hour post dose. 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No specific pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were provided.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of plerixafor have been evaluated in mouse, 
rat,  and  dog.  Nine  in  vitro  studies  and  ten  in  vivo  studies  were  completed  to  describe  the 
pharmacokinetics of plerixafor. Absorption studies of plerixafor were performed in mouse (SC only), 
rat  and  dog  following  SC,  IV  and  PO  administration.  In  vitro  plasma  protein  binding  and  red  cell 
partitioning  was  evaluated  for  rat,  dog  and  human.  Tissue  distribution  using  [14C]-plerixafor  was 
performed in rat after SC, PO and IV administration. The metabolism of plerixafor was evaluated in in 
vitro  studies  in  microsomes,  hepatocytes,  and  whole  blood.  In  vivo  metabolism  was  evaluated 
following  SC  and  IV  administration  to  rat  and  dog.  The  excretion  of  radioactivity  was  evaluated 
following SC and IV administration of [14C]-plerixafor to rat and dog. 
The  source  of  active  pharmaceutical  ingredient  used  in  these  studies  included  both  the  plerixafor 
octahydrochloride  salt  and  the  plerixafor  free  base.  After  pH  adjustment,  equivalent  formulated  test 
articles are produced from either the salt or the free base. All reported doses and concentrations were 
normalised to their free base equivalent.  
•  Methods of analysis 
Quantitation  of  plerixafor  in  plasma  was  performed  by  high  performance  liquid  chromatography 
(HPLC) coupled with various methods of detection including ultraviolet (HPLC-UV), electrochemical 
detection (HPLC-ECD), and mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). [14C]-plerixafor in plasma and urine was 
quantitated by HPLC coupled with detection by liquid scintillation counting (HPLC-LSC) or reverse 
isotope dilution (LC-RID). Radioactivity in plasma, urine, faeces, intestinal content, carcass, and cage 
washes  was  determined  by  liquid  scintillation  counting  (LSC),  and  radioactivity  in  tissues  was 
determined by quantitative whole body autoradiography (QWBA). Concentrations of [14C]-plerixafor 
or total radioactivity in fluids and tissues are expressed as ng-eq/ml or ng-eq/g, where ng-eq represents 
the equivalent quantity of plerixafor free base represented by the measured radioactivity in decays per 
minute.  
•  Absorption  
Plasma pharmacokinetics following single SC doses of plerixafor were consistent across mouse, rat, 
dog,  and  human.  Absorption  following  SC  administration  to  mouse,  rat  and  dog  was  rapid  and 
considered  to  be  complete  (F  =  1).  Plerixafor  exhibited  low  plasma  clearance  for  all  species 
investigated,  namely  564,  255-365,  and  114-144  ml/h/kg  in  mouse,  rat  and  dog  respectively.  The 
apparent  volume  of  distribution  of  plerixafor is  moderate  across all tested  species (0.3-0.6  l/kg)  and 
human. Consistent with scaling, the elimination t1/2 ranged from 0.75, 0.90-1.16, 1.56-1.93 hours in 
mouse,  rat  and  dog,  respectively,  to  4.83  hours  in  human.  Exposure  to  plerixafor  following  SC 
administration to rat and dog was dose proportional within the evaluated ranges 0.3 to 12.1 mg/kg for 
10/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rats and 0.25 to 4 mg/kg for dogs. No significant accumulation of plerixafor in plasma was observed 
following 7 once daily doses to rat. Plerixafor exhibited low oral bioavailability in rat (<1%). 
In  the  repeated  dose  studies  in  rat  and  dog,  the  Tmax  did  not  change  with  dose  or  duration  or 
administration. Overall, a dose-proportional increase in Cmax and AUC was observed with increasing 
dose. A less than proportional increase in AUC in male rats and a greater than proportional increase in 
Cmax  for  male  and  female  dogs  were  noted  in  the  4-week  studies  with  once  daily  dosing  schedule. 
There  were  apparent  gender  differences  noted  based  on  Cmax  and  AUC  of  plerixafor.  In  the  4-week 
once-daily  dose  studies,  the  mean  Cmax  was  slightly  higher  in  male  rats  than  females,  and  the  mean 
Cmax and AUC were slightly higher in female dogs than in males. No sex differences were observed in 
the 4-week twice-daily dose studies. The prolonged administration (4-weeks) of plerixafor on a once- 
or twice-daily dosing schedule produced increase in Cmax in rats over the 4 week period (~6–117 % 
increase)  with  the  once-  and  twice-daily  dosing.  An  increase  in  Cmax  was  seen  in  dogs  (~  6-76  % 
increase)  with  once-daily  dosing.  A  similar  increase  was  usually  also  seen  with  AUC;  with  the 
exception,  the  4-week  dog  study  with  twice-daily  dosing  actually  showed  a  decrease  in  these 
parameters  with  prolonged  dosing.  An  increase  in  t1/2,  considered  possibly  related  to  decreased 
clearance from plasma, was observed with prolonged daily dosing in the 4-week rat and dog studies 
with twice-daily dosing.  
•  Distribution 
Tissue  distribution  studies  conducted  in  rats  following  SC,  PO  and  IV  administration  showed  that 
plerixafor  distributed  readily  into  the  majority  of  tissues  evaluated,  with  the  exception  of  brain, 
muscle, pancreas, renal fat, salivary gland, spinal cord and testis.  The highest tissue concentrations of 
drug-derived  material  were  observed  between  0.5-4  hours  after  administration  in  kidney,  liver, 
cartilage, spleen and blood vessel walls. Elimination of plerixafor from most tissues occurred between 
4 and 24 hours, however retention of drug-derived material in bone marrow, cartilage, spleen, liver, 
and kidney tissues was noted at up to 144 hours post SC administration. After 168 hours following SC 
administration to rat and dog up to 30 % of drug-derived material remained in the body. Accumulation 
of  drug-derived  material  in  rat  was  observed  following  7  days  of  once  daily  1  mg/kg  SC  doses  in 
certain tissues (kidney, liver, cartilage, bone marrow and spleen), however no significant accumulation 
of plerixafor in plasma occurred, as measured by AUC or Cmax. Tissue distribution was similar in male 
and female rat following SC administration. 
Plasma protein binding 
Binding  of  plerixafor  to  plasma  proteins  was  moderate  for  rat,  dog,  and  human.  The  percentage  of 
plerixafor bound to protein ranged from 33% to 54% in rat plasma, from 34% to 46% in dog plasma, 
and from 37% to 58% in human plasma (see also Clinical Pharmacokinetics). 
Blood-to-plasma ratio 
An in vitro study (GT-249-PK-4) was conducted to assess the potential for plerixafor to partition into 
red blood cells. [14C]-plerixafor was incubated in rat, dog, and human whole blood for 2 hours after 
which the red blood cell partition coefficient was determined. Partition coefficients in human whole 
blood at an incubation concentration of 0.1 µM were 0.20 and 0.18, for male and female respectively. 
Partition  coefficients  at  an  incubation  concentration  of  1.0  µM  were  0.20  and  0.11,  for  male  and 
female respectively.. 
Placental transfer in rabbits 
The  mean  fetal  tissue  concentrations  in  a  rabbit  embryofoetal  developmental  dose  finding  study  (# 
6045k)  were  111,  510  and  1287  ng/g,  and  the  ratios  fetal  tissue  versus  maternal  plasma  levels  at  6 
hours after application were 0.62, 1.97 and 1.55 after administrations of 0.6, 1.8 and 6.1 mg/kg/day, 
respectively.  
•  Metabolism 
Plerixafor  was  metabolically  stable  and  not  subject  to  hepatic  metabolism  in  in  vitro  metabolism 
studies conducted with rat, dog and human liver microsomes and hepatocytes. Furthermore, plerixafor 
11/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was also found to be stable in rat, dog and human whole blood. In vivo studies conducted in rat and 
dog  showed  that  the  non-parent  radiolabelled  components  present  in  plasma  and  urine  were  Cu2+ 
complexes with plerixafor. The 1:1 and 2:1 ratios of Cu2+: plerixafor that were observed are consistent 
with plerixafor’s two potential chelating sites, the two cyclam rings.  
• 
Excretion 
The  primary  route  of  elimination  in  rat  and  dog  was  renal  excretion.  Following  SC  and  IV 
administration in rat and dog the majority of the radioactivity (63-72 % of the dose) was excreted in 
the urine within 48 hours. Elimination in the faeces accounted for < 12 % of total radioactivity in rat 
and  dog.  Radioactivity  remaining  in  the  carcass  after  7  days  after  SC  administration  accounted  for 
16.1-27.5%  and  27.4%  of  the  dose  for  rat  and  dog  respectively.  Excretion  into  breast  milk  was  not 
investigated. 
• 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Concentrations of plerixafor that inhibit enzyme activity by 50% (IC50) for all isozymes (CYP1A2, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP 2C8, and CYP2E1) were >100 
µM  with  and  without  preincubation,  indicating  that  plerixafor  is  neither  a  direct  nor  a  mechanism-
based  inhibitor  of  the  major  CYP  enzymes.  Plerixafor  did  not  exhibit  inhibitory  activity  in  vitro 
towards  the  major  drug  metabolizing  cytochrome  P450  (CYP450)  enzymes.  In  in  vitro  studies  with 
human hepatocytes, plerixafor doses did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 enzymes.  
•  Other pharmacokinetic studies 
No other pharmacokinetic studies were performed. 
Toxicology 
Two  different  forms  of  test  article  were  used  in  the  conduct  of  the  toxicity  studies,  plerixafor 
octahydrochloride salt and plerixafor free base.  Plerixafor octahydrochloride was used in the initial 
battery of toxicity studies, whereas plerixafor free base was used in later toxicity studies conducted in 
support  of  marketing  application as  well  as in clinical  trials.   The  vehicles  for the  plerixafor  dosing 
solutions  were  aqueous  phosphate  buffer  and  pH  adjusted  saline  for  studies  with  plerixafor 
octahydrochloride  and  plerixafor  free  base,  respectively.    At  the  neutral  pH  used  for  the  dosing 
formulations,  plerixafor  from  both  sources  would  be  protonated  to  the  +4  state.    Thus,  the  two 
different test article forms used in these studies are considered identical. 
•  Single dose toxicity 
Lethality  was  found  after  intravenous  doses  of  5  mg/kg  and  higher  in  both  species  and  after 
subcutaneous  doses  of  14  mg/kg  (mice)  or  40  mg/kg  (rats)  and  higher.  Clinical  signs  in  surviving 
animals  of  both  species  after  both  routes  of  administration  included  sedation,  spasms,  dyspnoea, 
ventral  recumbency.  These  signs  lasted  for  about  1  –  2  hours  post  dose.  In  one  rat study  blood  and 
urinary  chemistry  were  studied  at  30  min  –  4  hrs  post  dose.  Observed  significant  changes  were: 
decreased total protein and albumin (doses of 2-30 mg/kg), transient increase of blood magnesium and 
inorganic  phosphorus  and  decrease  of  blood  pH  at  30-40  mg/kg  and  decreased  urinary  sodium, 
potassium and pH at 30-40 mg/kg. A small decrease in plasma Ca was found which was considered 
biologically not relevant. These changes could not be related to the observed clinical signs.

Interspecies comparison 
All  preclinical  species  exhibited  linear  pharmacokinetics  with  dose-proportional  exposures  as 
measured by the Cmax and AUC values. After SC administration of plerixafor, Cmax in plasma occurred 
at 0.25-0.5 h in all preclinical species and at 0.65 h in human. The elimination half-life following SC 
administration  was  0.75  h in  mice,  0.90  h in rats,  1.58  h in dogs  and  4.83  h in humans.  The longer 
half-life in humans correlates with the lower clearance (59 ml/h/kg). Apparent volumes of distribution 
were moderate in all species (322-612 ml/kg).

Fertility and early embryonic development 
No  studies  have  been  conducted  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  plerixafor  treatment  on  male  or  female 
fertility in rats and dogs. A justification was provided to this effect. 
Embryo-Fœtal development 
Two studies in rats and one study in rabbits were conducted to evaluate the effects of plerixafor on 
embryo-fœtal development.  In one of the rat studies, no clinical signs were reported at ≤ 15 mg/kg. 
Clinical  signs  at  30  mg/kg  included,  but  were  not  limited  to:  decreased  activity  (5/6),  dehydration 
(5/6), eyes partly closed (5/6), tremors (5/6), chewing action (1/6), uncoordinated (5/6), abnormal gait 
(4/6),  lying  on  side  (3/6),  abnormal  breathing  sounds  (4/6),  laboured  breathing  (2/6)  and  weakness 
(2/6). The cause of the early deaths or the necessity for preterminal euthanasia could not be elucidated 
based on the gross pathological findings. 
In  the  second  rat  study,  the  most  prevalent  major  malformation  in  the  15  mg/kg  group  was 
hydrocephaly  (9/21  litters).  In  addition,  the  following  major  malformations  of  head,  eyes,  heart, 
abdomen,  limbs  and  tail  were  found:  anophthalmia,  microphthalmia,  cyst  at  parietal/frontal  bones, 
globular  heart,  dilatation  of  ascending  aorta,  interventricular  septal  defect,  dilatation  of  pulmonary 
truncus,  stenosis  of  descending  aorta,  ringed  aorta,  anal  atresia,  intestinal  stenosis,  acaudia, 
microcaudia, brachdactyly and omphalocele. One fetus in the 3 mg/kg group had omphalocele, fused 
17/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
kidneys,  anal  atresia,  microcaudia,  multiple  fusions  and  anomalies  in  the  thoracic  vertebrae,  and 
absence of lumbar vertebrae (centra and arches).  
The increased incidence of dark discoloration of adrenal glands was considered incidental, but occurred 
in 5 fetuses in 5 litters vs 0 in all other groups and was not described in historical control data. Fused 
kidneys, absence of lumbar vertebrae were not reported either in the historical control data.  
In the rabbit study, the number of assessable animals at the different dose levels was: 3, 6, 4 and 2 in 
the 0, 0.6, 1.8 and 6.1 mg/kg dose groups respectively. Clinical toxicity signs at 1.8 mg/kg/day were: 
weak  limbs,  lateral  position  and  slowed  breathing  about  1  hr  post  dose  on day  15  post  insemination 
(p.i.)  in  one  dam,  and  hyperactivity  15-30  min  post  dose  on  day  15  p.i.  in  another  dam.  At  6.1 
mg/kg/day, beginning from day p.i. on, clinical signs occurred in all dams between 10 min and 5 hrs 
post dose, mostly disappearing within 2 hrs: sedation, prone or lateral position, reduced muscle tone or 
muscle contractions, weak limbs, miosis, exophthalmus, negative cornea reflex, cyanosis and slowed 
or shallow breathing. In the 1.8 mg/kg/day group, 1 dam died, in the 6.1 mg/kg/day group 3 dams died.  
Head  malformations  at  6.1  mg/kg:  flatened  telencephalon,  aplasia  of  eye  anlagen,  jaw  dysplasia, 
flatened snout, aplasia of nasal pits. 
Head malformations at 1.8 mg/kg (in 2 fetuses in the same litter): flatened tel- and/or mesencephalon, 
rhombencepahlon bulged, dysplastic face (flatened, vesicular evagination), aplasia of eye anlagen, jaw 
dysplasia. A third fetus (not known whether this was from the same or a different litter) had aplasia of 
3 toes of one hindlimb. 
No  GLP  embryo-fetal  developmental  study  in  rabbits  was  conducted,  and  the  applicant  provided  a 
justification to this effect.  
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
No  studies  on  prenatal  and  postnatal  developmental  toxicity  of  plerixafor  were  submitted.  A 
justification was provided to this effect. 
Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated  
A  non-GLP single and repeated-dose range finding study was conducted in 5 juvenile male Yorkshire 
pigs, done to find a safe single dose and a safe dose for administration during 7 consecutive days, to 
characterise plasma kinetics, white blood cell mobilisation and to compare toxicity in pigs to human, 
rat and dog.  
Two of the animals received twice a single dose with a washout period of minimally 48 hrs between 
the  doses,  the  others  only  one  single  dose.  Tested  doses  were  2  and  8  mg/kg  (animal  A),  4  and  12 
mg/kg  (animal  B),  1  and  6  mg/kg  (in  2  different  pigs).  The  5th  animal  received  4.75  mg/kg  at  4 
consecutive days. The animal which received 12 mg/kg died about 20 min after the dose. Although no 
clear  cause  for  its  death  was  found,  it  was  considered  test  article  related.  Post-mortem  a  plasma 
concentration of 57 µM was found. The animal dosed 8 mg/kg showed clinical signs between 1 and 2 
hrs post-dose (lateral recumbence, “looked uncomfortable”), but recovered. At doses of 4 and 2 mg/kg 
observed clinical signs were loose feces, and slight shaking (but this might be related to temperature 
difference  due  to  separation  from  herd).  No  clinical  signs  were  found  at  1  and  6  mg/kg  or  after 
repeated administration of 4.75 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetics after doses of 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 mg/kg showed 
an  approximately  dose  proportional  increase  of  AUC0-24hr  of  10.15  –  75.40  hr.µM,  a  less  than  dose 
proportional increase of Cmax of 5.02 – 23.59 µM, a tmax of 0.5 hr, and an elimination half life in the 
range 3.51 – 4.41 hr. Two distinct phases of increase of white blood cell counts (WBC) were found, 
peaking  near  4  and  12  hrs  post-dose  respectively.  At  24  hrs  WBC  were  back  at  baseline.  No  clear 
difference in effect was found between 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg, or between 6 and 8 mg/kg. The effect (area 
under curve of WBC) of 6 and 8 mg/kg clearly exceeded that of the three lower doses. 
A final juvenile toxicity study designed specifically to evaluate the potential toxicity of plerixafor in 
juvenile animals was not conducted. A justification to this effect was provided.

•  Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data is presented in Table 1(see repeat dose studies). 
•  Local tolerance  
A  non-GLP  study  compared  the  irritation  caused  by  two  formulations  of  plerixafor  at  intradermal 
administration  in  the  New  Zealand  White  Rabbit.  Three  animals  were  used  for  the  test  of  each 
formulation. Formulation A (HCl base) was tested in 1 male and 2 females, at 6 concentrations in the 
range 1.5 – 50.1 mg/ml, all concentrations were injected at different sites in each animal. Formulation 
B  (Citric  acid  base),  was  planned  to  be  tested  at  1.5    -  124.7  mg/ml  in  1  males  and  2  females. 
However, after the first dose one female died due to toxicity, and  was replaced by a male.  Due to this 
mortality and severe clinical signs in the animals receiving formulation B, a ≥ 6 hr interval was kept 
between  the  first  dose  and  the  remainder  of  the  doses.  All  animals  received  in  addition  saline  and 
cottonseed oil injections at 6 other sites (as neg and pos control). The scoring system described in the 
ISO 10993 part 10 Test Guideline was followed 
With this system formulation A with a plerixafor concentration of 1.5 mg/ml was negligible irritant, 
and  this  formulation  with  plerixafor  concentrations  of  3  –  50.1  mg/ml  was  slightly  irritant. 
Formulation  B  with  plerixafor  concentrations  of  1.5  –  12  mg/ml  was  negligible  irritant,  and  this 
formulation  with  plerixafor  concentrations  of  25  – 124.7  mg/ml  was  slightly  irritant.  Formulation  B 
was  slightly  less irritant  than  formulation  A. The  degree  of  irritation  by  both  formulations  was  also 
positively correlated with the plerixafor concentration. 
•  Other toxicity studies 
A GLP study examined the effect of plerixafor on human whole blood haemolysis. No haemolytic or 
flocculating  effect  of  plerixafor  was  found  at  the  tested  concentration.  However,  the  tested 
concentration was below the observed human Cmax of ≈ 0.8 µg/ml.  
A non-GLP single dose haematology study was conducted in 9 male rats, all receiving a subcutaneous 
dose of 10 mg plerixafor/kg. Blood was sampled in 3 rats per time point at 9 time points ranging from 
0  up  to  24  hrs  post  dose.  No  clinical  abnormalities,  or  effects  on  body  weight  were  observed  after 
dosing.  
A  non-GLP  study  examined  effects  of  plerixafor  (octahydrochloride)  on  metal  homeostasis  during 
once  daily  subcutaneous  administration  of  4  female  Wistar  rats  with  15  mg  plerixafor 
octahydrochloride  corresponding  to  9.49  mg  plerixafor/kg  for  14  days,  because  of  known  metal 
binding characteristics of azamacrocycles. Urinary excretion of Cu and Zn was increased, However, 
Ca  levels    (far  above  those  of  plerixafor)  increased  and  continued  to  increase  during  the  treatment 
period to a level of about twice the initial level. This increase could not be explained by binding to 
plerixafor. Plasma levels of Zn, Cu and Fe were not affected by plerixafor administration, indicating 
that in the rat homeostasis is maintained in spite of increased excretion . Plasma levels of Ca and Mg 
decreased  with  31%  and  55%  respectively  after  repeated  plerixafor  administration,  but  reached  a 
steady level during steady state levels of plerixafor. The decrease in plasma Ca level did not mirror the 
increasing level in urine. Urinary Mg was not affected by plerixafor. No major toxicity was observed 
upon short term daily dosing. 
Immunotoxicity 
A non-GLP study examined the effect of subcutaneous administration of 0, 8 and 20 mg/kg plerixafor 
on  4  consecutive  days  on  the  in  vivo  antibody  response  to  sheep  erythrocytes  in  5  rats/dose  group. 
Plerixafor  did  not  affect  the  number  of  plaques  formed  per  spleen,  whilst  cyclosporin  completely 
inhibited  the  response.  A  justification  was  provided  for  not  conducting  additional  immunotoxicity 
studies, citing ICH S8 Immunotoxicity Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals, September 2005. 
Studies on Impurities. 
19/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No  pharmacology  or  toxicity  studies  with  individual  impurities  were  submitted.  All  specified  and 
unspecified  impurities  were  qualified  based  on  their  determined  levels  in  the  various  batches  of 
plerixafor and plerixafor octahydrochloride used in nonclinical safety studies. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  Applicant  submitted  an  expert  report,  based  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA) 
Guideline  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00).  The  applicant  calculated  PECsurfacewater  values  using  a 
refined  Fpen  based  on  the  number  of  autologous  transplantation  procedures  that  are  performed  per 
year.  The  PECsurfacewater  based  on  a  daily  dose  of  20.6  mg.inh-1.d-1  and  a  refined  Fpen  of 
0.0000251  is  0.00026  µg/L,  which  is  below  the  action  limit  of  0.01  µg/L.  Therefore  plerixafor  is 
unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients. The Phase I 
assessment was considered completed; a Phase II assessment did not need to be performed.  
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
In general, the primary pharmacodynamic data were considered sufficient to support the indication. A 
series of in vitro studies looked at the activity of plerixafor at the human CXCR4 receptor, whilst the 
ability  of  plerixafor  to  mobilise  haematopoietic  progenitor  cells  (HPC)  and  HSC  from  the  bone 
marrow  to  blood  was  shown  in  mice.  With  regards  to  secondary  pharmacodynamics,  studies  with 
plerixafor  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  CXCR4  inhibition  in  models  were  provided  for  a  number  of 
CXCR4-related diseases, different from the indication of the present application. Safety pharmacology 
studies in the central nervous system, respiratory system, cardiovascular system and endocrine system 
were also provided. Taking into account the affinity of plerixafor for NA and DA receptors, and the 
passage of the blood-brain barrier, it cannot be excluded that plerixafor directly induces CNS effects. 
No  data  on  pharmacodynamic  interactions  other  than  with  G-CSF  were  provided,  given  the 
administration  schedule  of  plerixafor.  The  pharmacokinetics  of  plerixafor  were  studied  adequately, 
especially the subcutaneous administration route in rat and dog. Five single dose studies in mice and 
rats were provided, one in each species using the intravenous route and one study in mice and two in 
rats  using  the  subcutaneous  route.  Repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  up  to  a  duration  of  4  weeks,  with 
recovery  phases,  were  carried  out  in  rats  and  dogs.  Safety  pharmacology  results  suggest  that  at  the 
systemic concentrations tested in the laboratory animals, also effects on noradrenergic, dopaminergic, 
5-HT  receptors  and  on  enzymes  and  receptors  involved  in  regulations  of  blood  pressure  may  be 
induced.  Effects  mediated  by  these  receptors  and  enzymes  might  play  a  role  in  the  acute  clinical 
toxicity of plerixafor, however this possibility was insufficiently investigated.  
A sufficient package of genotoxicity tests (bacterial gene mutation test, CHO chromosomal aberration 
test,  rat  micronucleus  test)  revealed  no  evidence  of  genotoxic  potential.  No  conventional 
carcinogenicity studies were submitted given that there is no evidence for genotoxicity of plerixafor, 
and  plerixafor  will  only  be  used  for  a  short  period.  A  dose-finding  and  a  full  embryo-foetal 
developmental  toxicity  study  were  done  in  rats  and  a  dose-finding  study  in  rabbits.  No  fertility  or 
pre/postnatal developmental toxicity studies were provided  in this indication and the known adverse 
effects  on  development.  Additional  immunotoxicity  studies  with  subcutaneous  doses  of  8  and  20 
mg/kg  plerixafor  did  not  significantly  affect  the  in  vivo  antibody  response  of  rats  to  sheep 
erythrocytes,  whilst  cyclosporin  (positive  control)  completely  inhibited  the  response.  The  Applicant 
provided  acceptable  justification  for  not  conducting  additional  immunotoxicity  studies.  Sufficient 
justification was also provided for specification limits regarding drug substance related impurities. 
An adequate environmental risk assessment was provided. The applicant calculated PECsurfacewater 
values  using  a  refined  Fpen  based  on  the  number  of  autologous  transplantation  procedures  that  are 
performed  per  year.  Plerixafor  is  unlikely  to  represent  a  risk  for  the  environment  following  its 
prescribed usage in patients , therefore a Phase II assessment does not need to be performed.  
During the assessment, the CHMP raised the following main concerns with regards to the non-clinical 
data submitted as part of this dossier. 
20/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. A general receptor screen testing the affinity of plerixafor for other receptors, unrelated to CXCR4 
was  not  carried  out  initially  by  the  Applicant.  Given  the  multiple  effects  of  plerixafor  found  in  the 
toxicity  and  safety  pharmacology  studies  and  the  existing  evidence  of  affinity  for  α1-  and  α2-
adrenergic and D1-dopaminergic receptors, inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme and agonistic 
actions on neuropeptide Y receptors, the CHMP considered it possible that a general receptor screen 
would reveal activity on other receptors and enzymes. The analysis of the results of a general receptor 
screen study  along with  any subsequent SPC update will be performed as a follow-up measure.  
2. Given that plerixafor is recommended to be combined with G-CSF., the CHMP noted that no safety 
studies had addressed this combination and requested that the Applicant discuss this issue further. The 
Applicant provided a discussion of the safety of the combination (plerixafor and G-CSF) based on 
clinical data from patients treated with both compounds (see Clinical Safety Discussion). 
3.  The CHMP noted that the potential phototoxicity of plerixafor had not been addressed.  Plerixafor 
is  given  by  sub-cutaneous injection  and  distribution  data  showed it  was retained  at  site  of injection.  
The Applicant conducted a scan of the light absorbance of plerixafor in the 290 to 700 nm range.  The 
visible spectrum (290 to 700 nm) of plerixafor injection was obtained and indicated that there is no 
significant absorbance in the visible range (data not shown).  This is consistent with the structure of 
plerixafor as it does not contain a strong chromophore.  In accordance with the Note for Guidance on 
Photosafety Testing (CPMP/SWP/398/02), the CHMP  therefore concluded that phototoxicity studies 
were not required. 
4.  The Applicant was asked to discuss to which extent acute toxicity signs reported may be due to 
effects on receptors other than CXCR4.  Although plerixafor does affect blood Ca and Mg levels, the 
changes  were  not  entirely  consistent  through  all  studies.  Therefore,  the  CHMP    questioned  that  the 
acute and short lasting clinical toxicity signs could be explained by these changes in blood chemistry.  
Instead, these effects  could be due to noradrenergic, dopaminergic, 5-HT receptors and enzymes and 
receptors involved in regulations of blood pressure.  The Applicant was asked to include the results 
from  the  general  receptor  screen  when  answering  this  question.  The  analysis  of  the  results  of  this 
screen along with  any subsequent SPC update will be performed as a follow-up measure 
5.  The CHMP raised concerns over the potential of short-term plerixafor treatment in stimulating the 
dissemination  of  tumours.  The  Applicant  provided  an  extensive  discussion  on  the  possible 
mobilisation of tumour cells by plerixafor. The review emphasized that tumour cell mobilisation and 
metastasizing of pre-existing tumours are complicated processes in which many factors are involved, 
and  therefore  difficult  to  predict  from  the  existing  data  However,  too  little  relevant  scientific  data 
exists be reassured that Mozobil could not potentially increase tumour cell mobilisation and thereby 
increase the risk of formation of new tumours. Therefore this uncertainty was considered in the final 
clinical assessment of the risk benefit balance for the patient.  
6 From the absence of studies submitted, the CHMP noted that the risk of plerixafor administration on 
fertility  remained  unknown.    The  Applicant  did  not  deem  conventional  fertility  studies  necessary, 
arguing that patients treated for the indication of plerixafor would also be exposed to other conditions 
with adverse effects on fertility after plerixafor treatment such as irradiation.  However, the data on 
elimination  of  plerixafor  showed  that  after  one  week  an  appreciable  quantity  of  this  very  stable 
compound is present in the body. Therefore, the Applicant  provided an assessment based on data of 
period  needed  to  eliminate  the  compound  completely  from  the  body.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  in 
clinical practice, no adverse effects on reproduction were expected from plerixafor, and did not deem 
it  necessary  to  ask  for  studies  on  the  potential  risk  of  adverse  effects  on  male  or  female  fertility  or 
embryo foetal development after completion of the treatment. 
7.    The  CHMP  raised  questions  with  regards  to  the  information  provided  in  the  environmental  risk 
assessment  as  the  phase  I  risk  assessment  could  not  be  completed.  The  Applicant  subsequently 
provided  all  data  neccessary  for  the  risk  assessment.  Based  on  the  result  of  the  Phase  I  and  PBT 
assessments,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  Mozobil  is  unlikely  to  represent  a  risk  for  the  environment 
following its prescribed usage in patients.  
21/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.  The  CHMP  requested  nonclinical  studies  to  evaluate  tumour  cell  mobilisation.  The  Applicant 
expressed  its  commitment  to  assess  available  tumour  cell  mobilization  lymphoma  and/or  multiple 
myeloma  animal  models  that  could  provide  meaningful  data  comparing  different  mobilisation 
regimens for tumour cell mobilization. Pending the completion of this assessment (by end of October 
2009),  the  Applicant  committed  to  provide  a  comprehensive  overview  of  the  currently  available 
multiple myeloma and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma animal models and discuss their relevance as a post-
approval  follow-up  measure.  The  CHMP  was  in  agreement  with  regards  to  the  importance  of 
discussing the relevance of these models, as animal studies may not always be applicable to the human 
situation. In addition, to provide more data about extensive immunophenotyping of the tumour cells 
mobilised  after  G-CSF  and  G-CSF  plus  Mozobil  and  functional  cell  studies  of  tumour  cells  after 
binding with Mozobil was considered helpful but not required. 
3.4   Clinical aspects 
Introduction

GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Pharmacokinetics 
•  Absorption  
The  pharmacokinetics  of  plerixafor  were  characterized  by  a  rapid  absorption,  with  the  time  to 
maximum plasma concentration (tmax) occurring at approximately 0.5 to 1 hour after SC administration 
(figure 1).  
Figure 1. Average plerixafor concentration-time curves following subcutaneous administration of four 
dose levels in 18 healthy volunteers in Study-1002. 
•  Bioavailability 
An  open-label,  single-arm,  single-dose,  dose-escalation  study  designed  to  determine  the  safety, 
pharmacokinetics,  bioavailability,  and  tolerability  of  single-dose  plerixafor  (IV,  SC,  and/or  PO)  in 
healthy  subjects  was  conducted.  The  results  from  this  study  led  to  selection  of  the  subcutaneous 
administration route for subsequent studies in healthy volunteers and the patient population. 
Exposures and half-lives at 40 and 80 µg/kg between IV and SC administration were comparable. Oral 
absorption  was  not  detectable  at  doses  up  to  160  µg/kg.  Based  on  similar  exposures  and  half  lives 
between the at 40 and 80 µg/kg between IV and SC administration and the greater convenience of SC 
dosing, SC injection was chosen as the route of administration for subsequent studies.

•  Bioequivalence 
Four different formulations of Mozobil were used in the clinical setting. Initial clinical trial material 
used in the Phase 1 as well as early Phase 2 trials was produced as a 10 mg/ml formulation supplied in 
1 ml or 5 ml (in study AMD3100-2001 only) ampoules.  For later Phase 2 and the Phase 3 trials, the 
formulation was 20 mg/ml formulation filled either to 1.7 or 1.2 ml in a 2 ml vial with slight variations 
in  the  amount  of  sodium  chloride  present  in  the  solution.    Four  studies  (AMD3100-2104,  -2106,  -
2108, and -C201) and the Compassionate Use Program (AMD3100-CUP001) used both the 10 mg/ml 
(1 ml ampoule) and 20 mg/ml formulations.  
No  human  bioequivalence  studies  have  been  performed  to  compare  the  10  mg/mL  versus  the  20 
mg/mL formulations.  
•  Distribution 
Binding  in  human  plasma  was  52%  at  1  µg/ml,  58%  at  3  µg/ml,  and    37%  10  µg/ml.  There  was  a 
decrease in the percentage of protein binding for plerixafor in all species at the highest concentration 
tested (10 µg/ml), indicative of saturation (study AOM0036). 
Partition into red blood cells was investigated (see non-clinical pharmacokinetics). 
The  apparent  volume  of  distribution  was  approximately  30L.  This  was  in  concordance  with  the 
distribution  volume  estimated  by  population  PK  analysis:  volume  of  distribution  for  central 
compartment was 4 L and for peripheral compartment 21L.  
•  Elimination 
No formal mass balance study was conducted in humans. In study 1101, the effects of impaired renal 
function on the pharmacokinetics of 240 µg/kg s.c. dose of plerixafor was assessed. In healthy subject 
with  normal  renal  function,  71%  of  the  applied  dose  was  excreted  as  intact  plerixafor  in  the  urine 
within 24 h of administration. The t½ following s.c. administration of plerixafor was approximately 3-5 
hours and apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) ranged from 3.7 to 5.7 L/h in healthy volunteers. Using 
popPK analysis  population estimate of CL/F was determined to be 4.4 L/h. Renal clearance in healthy 
subjects  was  3.1  L/h  indicating  that  ~25%  of  plerixafor  is  eliminated  by  another  (non-renal) 
elimination route 
•  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Pharmacokinetics of plerixafor were studied over the dosing range of 40 to 400 µg/kg after a single SC 
administration in normal healthy volunteers in two studies.. In patients with renal impaired function 
the mean elimination half-life was increased up to 16 hours and accumulation is likely to occur.  
Study  1002  also  determined  the  increase  in  CD34+  cell  counts  as  pharmacodynamic  response  to 
plerixafor. Single-dose administration of plerixafor injection produced increases in mean absolute PB 
CD34+  cell  counts  in  all  dose  groups  (40 µg/kg  N=3;  80 µg/kg  N=10;  160 µg/kg  N=5;  240 µg/kg 
N=5).  The changes from baseline were dose dependent (see below) not only for CD34+ cells, but also 
for  colony  forming  units,  total  WBC,  neutrophils,  lymphocytes,  monocytes  and  basophils.    Peak 
absolute  responses  were  observed  at  6  to  9  hours  post-dose  for  all  dose  levels  with  an  absolute 
maximal  PB  CD34+  cell  count of ~40  cells/µL. Values returned to  approximately  baseline levels  at 
24 hours post-dose, with the exception of the 240-µg/kg dose.

subcutaneous dose of plerixafor in study 1002.

A  further  comparison  was  performed  in  patients  treated  with  5 days  of  G-CSF  alone,  plerixafor 
160 µg/kg given with G-CSF on Day 5, and plerixafor 240 µg/kg given with G-CSF on Day 5.  The 
greatest  pharmacodynamic  response,  measured  by  either  mean  change  in  absolute  CD34+  levels  or 
fold-increase  in  PB  CD34+  cells  occurred  when  plerixafor  160 µg/kg  was  given  with  G-CSF  on 
Day 5. After a 4-day regimen of G-CSF, similar and mean fold-increases in CD34+ levels (see Figure 
below)  were  noted  when  160-µg/kg  and  240-µg/kg  plerixafor  were  administered  with  G-CSF  on 
Day 5.   The  peak  response  in  the  240-µg/kg  dose level  was from  10 to  14 hours  post-dose.    At this 
dose  level,  plerixafor  increased  absolute  PB  CD34+  cells  counts  (following  G-CSF  administration) 
from a baseline cell count of ~50 cells/µL to a peak cell count of 200 cells/µL .

No  studies  investigating  the  pharmacokinetics  of  plerixafor  following  repeated  dosing  have  been 
submitted. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
By using population PK analysis, an interindividual variability for Cl/F was estimated at 22%. 
Target population 
Pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of  plerixafor  were  consistent  across  healthy  subjects  and  oncology 
patients (i.e., NHL, MM, and HD).  
•  Special Populations 
The  effect of renal function  on  PK  of  plerixafor  was  examined in  subjects  with  mild,  moderate  and 
severe renal dysfunction. Plerixafor was rapidly absorbed in all subjects and mean Cmax values were 
not  affected  by  renal  impairment.  Plasma  clearance  of  plerixafor  decreased  with  decreasing  renal 
function, which resulted in higher exposure of 22%, 51% and 70% in mild, moderate and severe renal 
impaired  subjects  compared  to  the  control  group.  The  apparent  elimination  half-life  was  prolonged 
with  decreasing  renal  function;  the  mean  t1/2  in  the control,  mild,  moderate  and  severe  groups  was 
4.9, 7.8, 12.1, and 15.8 hours, respectively. Based on these results, patients with creatinine clearance 
20-50 ml/min should have their dose of plerixafor reduced by one-third to 0.16 mg/kg/day (see section 
5.2  of  the  SPC).  Clinical  data  with  this  dose  adjustment  are  limited.  There  is  insufficient  clinical 
experience  to  make  alternative  posology  recommendations  for  patients  with  a  creatinine  clearance 
<20 ml/min, as well as to make posology recommendations for patients on haemodialysis. Based on 
increasing  exposure  with  increasing  body  weight  the  dose  should  not  exceed  27 mg/day  if  the 
creatinine clearance is lower than 50 ml/min. 
In a population PK analysis, creatinine clearance was the most influential covariate on clearance. The 
second most influential covariate was total body weight on central volume of distribution. Age was a 
significant  covariate  on  peripheral  distribution  volume.  Gender  and  race  did  not  affect  the 
pharmacokinetics of plerixafor.  
The  experience  in  paediatric  patients  is  limited.  The  safety  and  efficacy  of  Mozobil  in  paediatric 
patients have not been established in controlled clinical studies. No dose modifications are necessary 
in  elderly  patients  with  normal  renal  function.    Dose  adjustment  in  elderly  patients  with  creatinine 
clearance ≤ 50 ml/min is recommended. In general, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly 
patients due to the greater frequency of decreased renal function with advanced age.   
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In clinical studies, plerixafor has primarily been investigated in conjunction with G-CSF 10 µg/kg as a 
first-line mobilization therapy regimen. PK of plerixafor appeared not to be different in presence of G-
CSF. No further drug-drug interaction studies were conducted. 
•  Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials  
No pharmacokinetic studies using human biomaterials were submitted.

The pharmacodynamic effect of plerixafor was studied both in healthy subjects and oncology patients, 
as single agent and as an additive mobilizing agent when administered with G-CSF.  
Primary pharmacology 
AMD3100-1002  
This was a phase 1 study of the safety, pharmacokinetic and haematological activity of one dose of 
plerixafor  administered  by  subcutaneous  injection  to  healthy  volunteers.  Twenty-three  subjects 
received  a  single  sc  dose  of  plerixafor  injection:  40  µg/kg  (3  subjects),  80  µg/kg  (10  subjects),  160 
µg/kg (5 subjects) and 240 µg/kg (5 subjects).  Three subjects received serial sc doses of 80 µg/kg for 
3 consecutive days; two of these subjects had previously received a single dose of 80 µg/kg. 
Single-dose  administration  of  plerixafor  injection  produced  dose-dependent  increases  in    circulating 
CD34+  cells,  CFUs,  total  WBCs,  neutrophils,  lymphocytes,  monocytes  and  basophils.  For  CD34+ 
cells,  peak  responses  were  observed  at  6  to  9  hours  post-dose  for  all  doses.  Values  returned  to 
approximately  baseline  levels  at  24  hours  post-dose  with  the  exception  of  the  240  µg/kg  dose.  A 
higher, later and broader peak of CD34+ cells was seen for plerixafor 240 µg/kg than for lower doses. 
CD34+  cell  increases  were  similar  each  day  when  80  µg/kg  plerixafor  was  given  for  3  consecutive 
days to 3 healthy volunteers, suggesting that CD34+ cells were able to re-home after each dose. 
AMD3100-1005  
This  was  a  phase  I  study  of  the  safety  and  hematological  activity  of  one  dose  of  plerixafor 
administered  by  subcutaneous  injection  at  a  dose  of  240  µg/kg  or  320  µg/kg  to  healthy  volunteers. 
Four subjects received 240 µg/kg, and six subjects received 320 µg/kg

27/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
         
 
Considering the efficacy results and the fact that subjects in the higher dose group experienced more 
AEs and AEs of greater intensity, the 320 µg/kg dose was not considered to provide an advantage over 
240 µg/kg plerixafor injection.  
Secondary pharmacology 
No interactions other than between plerixafor and G-CSF have been studied. Drug interactions have 
not been observed in clinical trials with plerixafor. In clinical studies of patients with Non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma, the addition of rituximab to a mobilisation regimen of Mozobil and G-CSF did not impact 
patient safety or CD34+ cell yield. 
AMD3100-1003  
The objective of this study was to  carry out an analysis of the effect of plerixafor when given alone or 
with G-CSF to mobilize progenitor cells after pre-treatment with G-CSF. The table below summarizes 
the different patient groups and treatment schedules.

In  all  groups  G-CSF  was  given  for  4  d  before  the  randomized  treatment  on  day  5  in  the  different 
groups A-E. Groups D and E were admitted to hospital for serial CD34+ measurements, group D for 
12  h  and  group  E  for  24  h.    Peak  response  concerning  CFU-GM  progenitors  occured  at  6  h  in  the 
group given plerixafor 160 µg/kg + G-CSF, thus earlier than the peak CD34+ response.

Injection of Plerixafor (160 µg/kg or 240 µg/kg) After 5 Days of G-CSF in Study 1003 
Subjects receiving G-CSF + 240 µg/kg plerixafor produced peak increases of CD34+ cells in PB at 10-
14 hours post-dose. In this study of the combination of G-CSF  + plerixafor peak increases of CD34+ 
cells were similar with plerixafor doses of 160 µg/kg and 240 µg/kg.

Progenitor  cell  mobilization  by  combined  10  µg/kg  G-CSF  and  160  µg/kg  plerixafor  injection  and 
treatment yielded approximately 5-fold, 3-fold and 3-fold mean relative increases in peripheral blood 
CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-GEMM, respectively, all at 6 hours post-dose. The increase in peripheral 
blood CFU-GM levels paralleled the increase in peripheral blood CD34+ levels.  
The difference between CD34+ cell numbers in patients treated with G-CSF  + plerixafor 160 µg/kg 
(AA) and the G-CSF treated patients (CC) was larger than the respective differences concerning CFU. 
Similar large increases in CFUs were observed for the G-CSF + plerixafor (AA) and the G-CSF alone 
(CC) groups.  
Study AMD3100-1004 
This was a phase 1 study carried out to evaluate the safety and effect on circulating CD34+ cells of a 
single  dose  of  160  µg/kg,  240  µg/kg,  or  320  µg/kg  of  plerixafor  administered  by  subcutaneous 
injection to patients with Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma or Multiple Myeloma 
A  single  dose  of  either  160  µg/kg  ,  240  µg/kg  or  320  µg/kg  plerixafor  gave  clear  increases  in  PB 
CD34+ cells/µl at 4 h and 6 h. There was no positive dose- response relationship for the median values 
in NHL patients. The patients receiving 320 µg/kg had frequent measurements of CD34+ cells in PB 
up to 24 h after dosing. In NHL and MM patients receiving 320 µg/kg plerixafor injection mean peak 
fold-increases  in  PB  CD34+  cells  of  9.3 and  12.3  respectively  were  observed  8-10  hours  post-dose. 
Mean peak fold-increases at 6 hours ranged from 4.4 to 9.4 across the 6 disease/dose groups studies. 
In the mobilization and apheresis part of the study where G-CSF was given for 4 d before plerixafor 
320 µg/kg and apheresis, 3 MM patients collected the target of  >5 x106 CD34+ cells /kg in 2 or fewer 
apheresis  days.  The  yields  for  the  3  NHL  patients  were  much  lower  and  and  2  of  3  were  poor 
mobilisers. Three MM patients and 2 NHL patients were transplanted with cells collected following 
plerixafor  and  showed  PMN  engraftment  generally  within  12  days  and  no  later  than  15  days  from 
transplantation. Graft durability was shown up to the last follow-up contact. 
Overall, the most common AEs reported were injection site erythema (12/21, 57.1 %), fatigue (7/21, 
33.3 %), paresthesia (5/21, 23.8 %) and bone pain (5/21, 23.8 %). Injection site erythema was most 
commonly reported for the 240 µg/kg plerixafor injection treated NHL patients (3/3, 100 %) and the 
320 µg/kg plerixafor injection treated MM patients (3/3, 100 %). The incidence of fatigue was highest 
for  the  320  µg/kg  plerixafor  injection  treated  NHL  patients  (3/5,  60.0  %)  and  the  incidence  of 
paresthesia was highest for the160 µg/kg plerixafor injection treated MM patients (2/3, 66.7 %). Bone 
pain was only reported for NHL (3/5, 60.0 %) and MM patients (2/3, 66.7 %) treated with 320 µg/kg 
plerixafor injection who were also treated with G-CSF which is commonly associated with bone pain 
Study AMD3100-1101 
This  was  a  phase  1  study  of  the  safety,  pharmacokinetics,  and  haematological  activity  of  plerixafor 
(240 µg/kg) in subjects with renal impairment. Twenty three subjects (17 with renal impairment and 6 
healthy controls) were enrolled in this study. Subjects were stratified into 4 cohorts:

The  delayed  excretion  and  thereby  increased  systemic  exposure  of  a  single  dose  of  plerixafor  240 
µg/kg  with higher degrees of renal impairment as described in the PK report, was associated with a 
delayed  peak  mobilization  of  CD34+  cells  as  seen  below.  In  the  patient  group  with  severe  renal 
impairment, the highest measurement for CD34+ cells was at 24 h, with an unknown peak before or 
after this timepoint.

Discussion on clinical pharmacology aspects 
The pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic profile of plerixafor were consistent, whether in healthy 
subjects given plerixafor alone or oncology patients given plerixafor plus G-CSF. No major objections 
regarding  the  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  of  plerixafor  were  raised.  However,  the 
following  issues  were  identified  by  the  CHMP  with  regards  to  the  clinical  pharmacokinetic  and 
pharmacodynamic studies submitted. 
1.  The  CHMP  requested  that  the  Applicant  indicate  whether  plerixafor  had  been  applied  at  other 
injection sites besides the abdominal area, and what effects this had had on the pharmacokinetics of 
the  medicinal  product.  Although  pharmacokinetics  upon  subcutaneous  injection  at  various  injection 
sites  was  not  compared,  the  Applicant  provided  data  which  indicated  that  PD  appears  similar  when 
given via the abdomen or upper arm.  
2.  The  Applicant  was  requested  to  discuss  dose  instructions  for  subjects  with  moderate  and  severe 
renal impairment with respect to dose, frequency of plerixafor administration and time to apheresis as 
pharmacodynamics were also affected by renal impairment. The CHMP considered that the proposed 
dose reduction of 1/3 in severe renal impairment needed to be further justified.   
From the Applicant’s responses, PK data and safety data were considered to support dose adjustment 
of 160 µg/kg in patients with renal impairment 20-50 ml/min. However, the PK data did not support 
dose adjustment of 160 µg/kg in patients with severe renal impairment <20 ml/min and there was only 
limited  efficacy  and  safety  data  in  this  population.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  no  dose 
recommendations  can  be  made  for  this  population.  In  line  with  these  conclusions,  the  SPC  was 
amended as follows: 
Proposal applicant 4.2 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Patients with creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min should have their dose of plerixafor reduced by one-
third to 0.16 mg/kg/day (see section 5.2). Clinical data with this dose adjustment are limited. There is 
insufficient  clinical  experience  to  make  alternative  posology  recommendations  for  patients  with  a 
30/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
creatinine  clearance  <20 mL/min,  as  well  as  to  make  posology  recommendations  for  patients  on 
haemodialysis. 
In  addition  to  this,  the  Applicant  proposed  to  use  the  Cockcroft-Gault  formula  to  estimate  the 
creatinine clearance in patients with severe renal dysfunction.  
3.  The  CHMP  considered  that  a  weight  cut-off  should  be  proposed  for  when  a  flat,  maximum  dose 
should be used. A maximal absolute dose of 40 mg/day was proposed by the applicant and in patients 
with  dose  adjustment  of  0.16  mg/kg  a  maximal  dose  of  27  mg/day  was  proposed.  These  dose 
adjustments  were  considered  adequate  by  the  CHMP.  Section  4.2  of  the  SPC  was  amended 
accordingly. 
Clinical efficacy  
There  were  two  phase  2  efficacy  and  safety  studies  with  plerixafor  in  conjunction  with  G-CSF 
(granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) in patients with non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple 
myeloma  (MM);  study  AMD3100-2101  and  AMD3100-2106.  In  addition,  there  were  two  phase  3 
placebo-controlled efficacy and safety studies with plerixafor in conjunction with G–CSF in patients 
with non Hodgkin lymphoma (AMD3100-3101) and in patients with multiple myeloma (AMD3100-
3102).  There  were  8  clinical  pharmacology  studies  and  10  supportive  studies  providing  additional 
safety, efficacy and clinical pharmacology data. 
•  Dose response study(ies) 
Six dose response studies were conducted, in  healthy subjects and oncology patients with NHL and 
MM  .  Based  on  the  safety  and  efficacy  observed  in  the  Phase 1  studies  and  one  Phase  2  study,  as 
described below, the 240-µg/kg dose was chosen as the dose to go forward in the clinical development 
programme for plerixafor.  Because in proof-of principle study (AMD 3100-2101), the CD34+ yield 
per aphaeresis was higher at the 240 µg/kg dose compared to the 160 µg/kg dose, the higher of the 
2 doses (240 µg/kg) was chosen. 
Protocol AMD3100-1004 
This was the first study conducted in cancer patients. A minimum of 12 patients and a maximum of 24 
were  to  be  entered.  There  were  2  groups  –  those  with  NHL  and  those  with  MM.  Each  group  was 
further divided into 2 cohorts – the first was to be treated with 160 µg/kg of AMD3100 and the second 
with 240 µg/kg of plerixafor. If 3 patients in a cohort were safely dosed, then 3 patients were entered 
into the second cohort. If both groups were safely dosed in each cohort, the study of 12 patients would 
be complete. The purpose of the study, other than safety, was to measure the change in CD34+ cell 
numbers at 0, 4, and 6 hours to determine if there was an increase in cell peak at times similar to what 
was seen in volunteers. The study  completed an enrolment of 13 patients (1 patient was replaced due 
to a technical error in cell processing). Seven patients received 240 µg/kg of plerixafor. There were no 
drug-related SAEs and no unusual or unexpected AEs. Efficacy data showed up to a 7-fold increase in 
circulating CD34+ cells. The study was amended to evaluate a 320 µg/kg dose . 
Protocol AMD3100-2101 
This  was  the  first  Phase  2  study  in  NHL  and  MM  patients.  Twenty-five    patients  were  entered.  In 
summary, patients underwent mobilization with one regimen of either (A) 5 days of 10 µg/kg of G-
CSF  or  (B)  5  days  of  10  µg/kg  of  G-CSF  plus  160  µg/kg  of  AMD3100  on  day  5.Patients  were 
apheresed one hour after the G-CSF alone dose or 6 hours after the morning G-CSF plus AMD3100 
dose for up to 4 days to achieve a target of 5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg. (G-CSF ± AMD3100 were given 
on  days  after  day  5  if  apheresis  proceeded  beyond  day  5.)  After  a  rest  period,  patients  received  the 
opposite  regimen  (A  after  B  or  B  after  A)  and  were  apheresed.  They  underwent  chemotherapy  and 
transplantation.  The  purpose  was  to  determine  safety,  apheresis  yields,  and  transplantation  success. 
The protocol was amended to dose the patients at 240 µg/kg of AMD3100. Eight were dosed at 160 
31/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
µg/kg and the rest at 240 µg/kg. The protocol was further amended such that the G-CSF alone regimen 
is always used first. There were no drug related SAEs or unexpected AEs.  
Protocol AMD3100-2102 
This study evaluated the benefit of plerixafor in poor mobilisers with MM and whether myeloma cells 
are mobilized. A dose of 240 µg/kg of plerixafor was added to their G-CSF mobilization regimen on 
the evening of Day 4 of G-CSF. Apheresis began on Day 5 after the morning dose of G-CSF. Eighteen 
patients entered this study and 7/10 mobilized enough cells for single or tandem transplants. Myeloma 
cells  were  not  mobilized  as  assessed  by  a  two  parameter  DNA  procedure  that  determines  the 
monoclonicity and level of elevation of immunoglobulin (Ig) chains in lymphoma cells. 
Protocol AMD3100-2103 
This study in NHL patients evaluated mobilization and whether NHL cells were mobilized. A dose of 
240 µg/kg of plerixafor was added to their G-CSF mobilization regimen on the evening of day 4 of G-
CSF. Thirteen patients entered this study. NHL cells were not mobilized. 
Protocol AMD3100-2104 
This study evaluated the effect of 240 µg/kg of plerixafor when added to a chemotherapy mobilizing 
regimen that included G-CSF. Eighteen patients entered the study. 
Protocol AMD3100-2105 
This  study  evaluated  the  effect  of  240  µg/kg  of  plerixafor  when  used  to  mobilize  MM  and  NHL 
patients  with  a  10:00  pm  study  drug  dosing  and  an  8:00  am  apheresis  schedule.  Forty-one  patients 
entered the study.

Patients  who  failed  to  mobilise  were  eligible  to  enter  an  open-label  rescue  procedure  where,  after  a 
minimum 7-day rest period, they received another treatment course of G-CSF followed by G-CSF + 
plerixafor and collection of cells.  
Objectives 
Primary 
Study 3101: The primary  objective is to determine if NHL patients mobilized with G-CSF plus 240 
µg/kg plerixafor are more likely to achieve a target number of ≥ 5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg in 4 or less 
days of apheresis than NHL patients mobilized with G-CSF plus placebo. 
Study  3102:  The  primary  objective  is  to  determine  if  MM  patients  mobilized  with  G-CSF  plus  240 
µg/kg plerixafor are more likely to achieve a target number of ≥ 6 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg in 2 or less 
apheresis days than MM patients mobilized with G-CSF plus placebo. 
Secondary 
1.  To  evaluate  the  safety  of  G-CSF  plus  plerixafor  (240µg/kg)  compared  to  G-CSF  plus  placebo  in 
NHL patients. 
2.  To  compare  NHL  patients  mobilized  with  G-CSF  plus  240  µg/kg  plerixafor  versus  patients 
mobilized with G-CSF plus placebo with respect to the number of patients who achieve a minimum of

3. To compare the 2 treatment arms with respect to the number of days of apheresis required to reach 
the target of ≥ 5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg (Study 3101). 
4. To determine if MM patients mobilized with G-CSF plus plerixafor (240 µg/kg) are more likely to 
achieve a target number of ≥ 6 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg in 4 or less apheresis days than MM patients 
mobilized with G-CSF plus placebo (Study 3102).

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
The  primary  endpoint  was  treatment  success,  i.e.  the  proportion  of  patients  achieving  the  target 
number of CD34+ cells within a predefined number of aphaeresis sessions as defined for each study.  
In trial 3101 the protocol-defined target was  ≥ 5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg within 4 days of apheresis.  In 
trial  3102:  The  protocol-defined  target  was  ≥  6  ×  106  CD34+  cells/kg  within  2  or  less  days  of 
apheresis.  
Secondary Endpoints 
A number of secondary endpoints were defined in the protocol:  
1. Percentage of patients achieving a minimum transplantable number of CD34+ cells 
(2 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg) in 4 or less days of apheresis 
2. Number of days of aphereses required to reach ≥ 5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg 
3. Number of days to PMN engraftment and to PLT engraftment 
4. Percentage of patients with durable engraftment at 100 days post-transplant 
An efficacy objective specific to EMEA was to determine if NHL patients mobilized with G-CSF + 
240 µg/kg plerixafor were more likely to achieve a target number CD34+ cells/kg in 4 or fewer days 
of apheresis and also have successful polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) and platelet (PLT) engraftments 
than NHL patients mobilized with G-CSF + placebo.Therefore, the CHMP considered that composite 
endpoints should be given more weight for the assessment of efficacy, in particular those taking into 
account both the target number of cells and successful engraftment. The following endpoints were thus 
defined for Study 3101 by CHMP as important secondary endpoints. 
1) Target number of cells ≥ 2 x 106 CD 34 + cells/kg in ≤ 4 days of aphaeresis and successful PMN 
and PLT engraftment; 
2) Target number of cells ≥ 5 x 106 CD 34 + cells/kg in ≤ 4 days of aphaeresis and successful PMN 
and PLT engraftment;  
3) PMN count ≥ 0.5 x 109/L for 3 consecutive days or  ≥ 1.0 x 109/L for 1 day and PLT count ≥ 20 x 
109/L for 7 consecutive days without patient receiving a transfusion in the prior 7 days.  
Similarly,  in  Study  3012,  an  efficacy  objective  specific  to  EMEA  was  to  determine  if  MM  patients 
mobilized with G-CSF + 240 µg/kg plerixafor were more likely to achieve a target number of CD34+ 
cells/kg in 2 or fewer days of apheresis and also have successful polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) and 
platelet  (PLT)  engraftments  than  MM  patients  mobilized  with  G-CSF  +  placebo.  Therefore,  the 
following endpoints were defined for Study 3102 by CHMP as important secondary endpoints. 
1) Target number of cells ≥ 6 x 106 CD 34 + cells/kg in ≤ 2 days of aphaeresis and successful PMN 
and PLT engraftment. 
2) PMN count ≥ 0.5 x 109/L for 3 consecutive days or ≥ 1.0 x 109/L for 1 day and PLT count ≥ 20 x 
109/L for 7 consecutive days without patient receiving a transfusion in the prior 7 days.  
Graft durability 
Graft durability was defined as maintenance of acceptable blood counts at 100 days, 6 months and 12 
months post-transplantation according to at least 2 of the 3 following criteria. 
1.  PLT count  > 50 x 109/L without transfusion for a least 2 weeks prior to the follow up visit 
35/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  Haemoglobin level ≥ 10 g /dL with no erythropoietin or transfusions for at least 1 month prior 
to follow up visit. 
3.  PMN > 1 x 109/L with no G-CSF for at least 1 week prior to the follow-up visit. 
Graft failure was defined as 1 or both of the following: 
1.  No  durable  graft  in  2  of  the  3  cell  lines  of  red  blood  cells,  leucocytes  and  platelets  (using 
definitions of durability above) at 100 days (and 6 and 12 months) post-transplantation 
2.  For  the  purposes  of  the  100-day  evaluation,  an  additional  criterion  was  applied.  If  100-day 
data were not available, and the patient’s absolute neutrophil count (ANC) did not rise above 
0.5 x 109/L by 28 days post-transplantation, the patient was considered not to have maintained 
a durable graft at the 100-days visit.  
PMN Engraftment 
Defined as PMN counts ≥ 0.5 x 109/L for 3 consecutive days or ≥ 1.0 x 109/L for 1 day. 
PLT Engraftment  
Defined as PLT counts ≥ 20 x 109/L for the first of 7 consecutive days without receiving a transfusion 
in the prior 7 days. 
Sample size 
Study  3101 was powered to show that the treatment success rate among the G + AMD3100 patients is 
at least 20 percentage points different from the treatment success rate among the G + Placebo patients. 
In AMD3100-2101, 10 of 15 (or 66.7%) of the patients reached a target of 5 × 106 CD34+ cells within 
4 days of apheresis after receiving G-CSF + plerixafor, while only 3 of 15 (or 20%) of the patients 
reached the target after receiving G-CSF alone. 
Study 3102 was powered to show that the treatment success rate among the G + AMD3100 patients is 
at least 20 percentage points different from the treatment success rate among the G + Placebo patients. 
In  Protocol  AMD3100-2101,  7  of  10  (or  70%)  of  the  patients  reached  a  target  of  6  ×  106  CD34+ 
cells/kg within 2 days of apheresis after receiving G-CSF plus plerixafor, while only 2 of 10 (or 20%) 
of the patients reached the target after receiving G-CSF alone.  
With a minimum of 93 patients per treatment group, and assuming that the treatment success rate for 
the  G-CSF  +  Placebo  patients  is  30%,  the  studies  will  be  able  to  declare  a  20-point  difference  in 
treatment success rates using a test for comparing 2 independent population proportions with a 2-sided 
α = 0.05 level of significance and a 1-β = 0.80 level of statistical power. The studies were powered for 
the Per-Protocol analysis to show a 20-point difference between treatment groups in the percentage of 
patients reaching the target of 5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg within 4 days of apheresis (Study 3101) and the 
target of 6 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg within 2 days of apheresis (Study 3102). 
The number of subjects that participated in the pivotal studies is summarised in the table below. The 
majority of the patients completed the study and were transplanted.

Additional data from study reports dated 28 October 2008 were provided on 15 December 2008. 
Randomisation 
In study 3101 patients determined to be eligible for the study were randomised prior to receiving the 
first  dose  of  G-CSF  in  a  1:1  ratio,  stratified  by  study  centre.  In  study  3102  eligible  patients  were 
stratified by study centre, platelet count (<0.2 x 106/dL versus ≥ 0.2 x 106/dL), and type of transplant 
planned (single or tandem) prior to randomisation. The study randomization schedules were  generated 
prior to enrolling the first patient into the study. Patient enrolment and patient treatment assignment 
were managed through a centralized patient randomization website. 
Patients randomized to receive plerixafor: 
The patient’s actual body weight was used to calculate the volume of plerixafor to be administered. 
The  patient’s  weight  had  to  be  obtained  within  7  days  prior  to  dosing.  The  volume  of  study  drug, 
plerixafor (240 mg/kg), to be given to patients was calculated as follows: 0.012 ´ patient’s actual body 
weight (in kg) = dose to be administered (in ml) 
Patients randomized to receive placebo: 
The volume of placebo  to be administered was determined using the same calculation as for plerixafor 
to ensure the same volume for injection.  
Blinding (masking) 
Studies  3101  and  3102  were  double-blind,  comparative  studies.  Each  study  center  was  assigned  a 
unique number. This number was used as part of the patient number assigned to each patient as they 
enrolled  in  each  of  the  studies.  Once  a  patient  had  been  screened  and  deemed  eligible  to  enter  the 
study, a patient number for that patient was assigned using centralized randomization. Patient numbers 
were assigned in sequential order of enrolment. A 5-digit number was assigned to the patient, with the 
first  2  digits  representing  the  study  center  and  the  last  3  digits  being  the  sequential  number  for  the 
patient.  
38/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients  who  met the  study  inclusion  and  exclusion criteria  were   randomized prior to receiving  the 
first  dose  of  G-CSF  for  mobilization.  The  pharmacist  responsible  for  dispensing  study  treatment 
logged  on  to  the  study  patient randomization  website  to  randomize  the  patient.   The  pharmacist  the 
drew up the appropriate treatment (plerixafor or placebo) into a syringe and attached a label with the 
patient number, patient initials, date, volume, and “AMD3100/Placebo” (the label will not identify the 
treatment  arm).  This  information  was  documented  in  the  drug  accountability  binder.  The 
administration of the study treatment was documented on the patient’s CRF at the time that the study 
treatment is administered to  the  patient.  Only  the  pharmacist  knew the  treatment  assignment  for the 
patient. The pharmacist had to ensure that the study investigator, study site personnel, sponsor, and the 
patient remained blinded to the actual treatment the patient received.  
Statistical methods 
The  percentage  of  patients  achieving  treatment  success  were  compared  between  the  two  treatment 
groups  using  Cochran/Mantel-Haenzel  chi-square,  stratified  by  investigator.  Categorical  data  was 
summarized using frequency tables, presenting the patient counts and the percentage of patients in that 
group  falling  into  the  category.  The  Cochran/Mantel-Haenzel  chi-square  was  used  for  analyzing 
contingency  tables  for  between-group  differences,  stratified  by  investigator  and  PLT  count  at  study 
entry.  McNemar’s  chi-square  was  used  to  assesswithin-subject  group  differences  in  a  bivariate 
response variable. 
All  demographic  and  analytical  between-group  differences  for  continuous  variables  were  analyzed 
parametrically  using  the  analysis-of-variance  and  non-parametrically  using  the  Wilcoxon  test  or  the 
analysis-of-variance  of  ranks.  Equivalent  methods  were  used  for  analyzing  within-subject  group 
differences. The paired t-test and the sign-rank test were used to test the null hypothesis that the mean 
within-subject measurement is equal to zero. The SAS system was used to perform all analyses. 
Time-to-Event  parameters  were  summarized  using  Kaplan-Meier  methods,  while  treatment  group 
differences in the resulting survival curves were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test and the Log-Rank 
test. If the event was not observed for a patient, then the patient was censored in the analysis on the 
last day he/she was evaluated for the event. 
A p-value of 0.05 or less was considered to be statistically significant. The p-values of all tests were 
reported without any correction for the multiplicity of tests performed. A final data analysis plan was 
developed  prior  to  locking  the  CRF  database  at  the  conclusion  of  the  study.  The  statistical  plan 
included mock-ups of all tables, listings, and figures to be included in a summary report, as well as 
documentation of all data derivations and statistical methods utilized. 
Intent-to-Treat Analysis 
All patients who enrol and were randomized in the study were included in the Intent-to-Treat analysis. 
Patients  were  analyzed  according  to  the  treatment  group  to  which  they  were  randomized.  The  total 
number of CD34+ cells collected at the time the patient completes their last apheresis, regardless of 
whether  or  not  the  patient  completes  4  aphereses,  was  used  to  determine  if  the  patient  could  be 
classified as a treatment success. The day of the last apheresis was used to derive each of the Days-to-
Reach-Target  parameters.  Patients  who  terminated  the  study  prior  to  engraftment  were  classified  as 
having not reached engraftment in the analyses. No other special data handling algorithms were used 
for  imputing  missing  data.  The  Intention-to-Treat  analysis  was  used  to  establish  the  efficacy  of 
plerixafor based on the primary endpoint (treatment success).  
Per-Protocol Analysis 
All patients completing 4 aphereses, who did not need to complete all 4 aphereses because they had 
reached the target of 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg, or who did not complete all 4 aphereses because they 
failed to collect 0.8 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg within 2 apheresis days were included in the Per-Protocol 
analysis. Patients were  analyzed according to the treatment that they received. No other special data 
handling  algorithms  were  used  for  imputing  missing  data.  The  Per-Protocol  analysis  was  used  as 
supportive in the assessment of efficacy of plerixafor. 
39/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Data Assumptions for Patients Not Completing Study 
Patients who did not complete the study according to the protocol.were included in the Intent-to-Treat 
analysis but excluded from the Per-Protocol analysis. The conventions and data assumptions described 
below were used for imputing missing data in the Intent-to-Treat analysis. 
Patients not completing G-CSF mobilization regimen 
These  patients  were  categorized  as  treatment  failures  in  the  Intent-to-Treat  analyses.  They  were  be 
excluded  from  the  Per-Protocol  analysis  and  from  the  Safety  analysis.  Any  patient  not  completing 
their  mobilization  regimen  of  G-CSF  fell  into  this  category.  Patients  did  not  complete  their 
mobilization  regimen  due  to  an  AE  or  death,  disease  progression,  G-CSF  administration  technical 
problems, or withdrawal of consent. 
Patients not getting study treatment (plerixafor  or placebo) 
These  patients  were  categorized  as  treatment  failures  in  the  Intent-to-Treat  analyses.  They  were 
excluded  from  the  Per-Protocol  analysis  and  from  the  Safety  analysis.  Any  patient  who  completed 
their  mobilization  regimen  of  G-CSF  but  did  not  receive  study  treatment  fell  into  this  category. 
Patients  did  not  get  their  study  treatment  (plerixafor  or  placebo)  due  to  an  AE  or  death,  disease 
progression, study treatment administration technical problems, or withdrawal of consent. 
Patients not completing 4 days of apheresis 
These  patients  were  categorized  as  treatment  failures  in  the  Intent-to-Treat  analyses.  They  were 
included in the Safety analysis, but were excluded from the Per-Protocol analysis if they receive their 
study  treatment  (pleixafor  or  placebo)  but  did  not  complete  their  apheresis  due  to  an  AE  or  death, 
disease  progression,  technical  problems  with  the  apheresis  product  or  procedure,  or  withdrawal  of 
consent. 
Patients with incomplete apheresis yield data 
These  patients  were  categorized  as  treatment  failures  in  the  Intent-to-Treat  analyses.  They  were 
excluded from the Per-Protocol analysis but were included in the Safety analysis. Any patient missing 
yield data from one or more aphereses fell into this category. Patients did not have apheresis yield data 
due to an AE, technical problems with the apheresis product or procedure, or withdrawal of consent. 
Patients with poor yield 
Patients with poor yield were defined as patients who do not collect ³ 0.8 ´ 106 CD34+ cells/kg after 2 
days of apheresis or patients who fail to collect at least 2 ´ 106 CD34+ cells/kg in 4 or less days of 
apheresis.  These  patients  were  categorized  as  treatment  failures  in  both  the  Intent-to-Treat  analyses 
and the Per-Protocol analyses. They were also included in the Safety analysis.  
Data Analysis 
Change-from-Baseline Parameters 
Within-subject  changes  from  pre-treatment  values  for  a  parameter  were  evaluated  using  “Change-
from-Baseline”  and  was  calculated  as:  Change-from-Baseline =  post-AMD3100  dosing  value  –  pre-
AMD3100 dosing value such that a positive value indicates an increase from the pre-AMD3100 value 
to the post-AMD3100 value, whereas a negative result indicated the opposite. Change-from-Baseline 
was calculated for each timepoint after the first dosing of plerixafor. 
Time-to-Event Parameters 
The following secondary efficacy parameters are time-to-event parameters: Days to Reach Target of 5 
x 106 CD34+ cells/kg, Days to Reach Target of 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg, Days to PMN engraftment, 
and Days to PLT engraftment. 
For the Days to Reach Target parameters, the number of days is calculated as: Number of Days = SAS 
Date of Event – SAS Date of First Apheresis 
For the Days to Engraftment parameters, the number of days is calculated as: Number of Days = SAS 
Date of Event – SAS Date of Last Transplant 
40/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the event was not observed for the patient, then the Number of Days were be calculated at the last 
day the patient was evaluated for the event.

Rescue procedure  
A total of 62 patients from the 3101 study(10/150 G-CSF + plerixafor and 52/148 G-CSF + placebo 
patients) who failed to collect 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg in the initial treatment/aphaeresis period entered 
the open-label rescue procedure, were they received another 4-day mobilisation regimen of G-CSF + 
plerixafor.  
An overview of these patients is given in the flow chart below. Seven patients (all placebo patients) in 
the  3102  failed  to  collect  2  x  106  CD34+  cells/kg  in  the  initial  treatment/aphaeresis  period  (‘poor 
mobilisers’)  and  entered  the  open-label  rescue  procedure.  They  received  another  4-day  mobilisation 
regimen of G-CSF + plerixafor.

Recruitment 
In the protocols for Studies 3101 and 3102, NHL and MM patients who were expected to be adequate 
to good mobilizers were entered. Given that the number of patients at risk of being poor mobilizers 
varies between 20% and 35%, the number of patients required to meet the target of ≥ 5 × 106 CD34+ 
cells/kg or achieving a minimum dose of ≥ 2 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg  was difficult to estimate. 
Study 3101: 
All  patients  with  NHL  (except  CLL)  who  have  completed  their  chemotherapy  regimen  prior  to  PB 
stem cell mobilization and autologous transplantation could be screened for entry into this study. Prior 
to  mobilization,  they  did  not  have  fever  or  signs  of  infection  and  did  not  have  worsening  of  their 
disease. Study period : 18 January 2005 – last patient’s 12-month visit: 20 December 2007.  
Study 3102: 
Patients with MM who had completed their chemotherapy regimen prior to peripheral blood (PB) stem 
cell  mobilization  and  autologous  transplantation  were  screened  for  entry  into  this  study.  Prior  to 
mobilization, they did not have fever or signs of infection and did not have worsening of their disease. 
Study period : 4 February 2005 – last patient’s 12-month visit: 22 January 2008.  
Conduct of the study 
Study 3101: 
There were 7 amendments Protocol Version 1.0 and 1 protocol clarification letter. There were also 2 
other  versions  of  the  protocol,  Protocol  Version  2.0  (incorporating  Amendments  1-6)  and  Protocol 
Version  3.0  (incorporating  Amendments  1-7).  All  of  the  protocol  amendments  were  instituted  after 
initiation of study enrollment. No protocol amendments were made to the study endpoints or efficacy 
analysis.  
Study 3102: 
There were 8 amendments to the original protocol, and 2 protocol clarification letters. There were also 
2 other versions of the protocol. Since Version 2.0, containing all changes from Amendments 1 – 7 
(dated  2  Sep  2005)  was  never  sent  to  sites,  a  corrected  version,  Version  3.0  (dated  16  Sep  2005) 
contained  all  changes  from  Amendments  1-8.  No  protocol  amendments  were  made  to  the  study 
endpoints or efficacy analysis.

Note: The primary endpoint data was provided in the Clinical Study Report dated 31 March 2008 at 
the time of MAA filing. The secondary endpoint data was based on the Clinical Study Report dated 16 
October 2008. 
0.4, 3.6 
Study 3101 
The  proportion  of  patients  maintaining  a  durable  graft  using  modified  platelet  criteria  for  graft 
durability (PLT ≥ 20 x 109/L without transfusions for at least 2 weeks prior to the visit) were similar in 
both groups at day 100, 6 months and 12 months. 
The measurement time period for fold increase was: from the morning of day 4 (just prior to G-CSF 
dose) to the morning of day 5 (prior to first aphaeresis). On Day 4 prior to the first dose of plerixafor 
or placebo the PB CD34+ cell count was similar in both arms. On day 5, 10-11 hours after the first 
dose,  the  mean  PB  CD34+  cell  count  was  significantly  higher  (p<0.001)  in  the  G-CSF  +  plerixafor 
group (53.5 cells/µL) compared to G-CSF + placebo (19.2 cells/µL).  The mean fold increase was also 
significantly higher (p<0.001) in the plerixafor group. 
In  addition,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  <10,  <15  and  <20  PB  CD34+  cells  were  higher  in  the 
placebo group. 
Overall  survival  was  an  exploratory  efficacy  endpoint  as  well,  no  difference  between  the  treatment 
arms  were  seen.  Overall  survival  (without  rescue  patients):  18  patients  died  and  132  alive  in  the 
plerixafor group versus 19 patients died and 148 alive in the placebo group.  
Study 3102 
The  proportion  of  patients  maintaining  a  durable  graft  using  modified  platelet  criteria  for  graft 
durability (PLT ≥ 20 x 109/L without transfusions for at least 2 weeks prior to the visit) were similar in 
both groups at day 100, 6 months and 12 months. 
The measurement time period for fold increase was: from the morning of day 4 (just prior to G-CSF 
dose) to the morning of day 5 (prior to first aphaeresis). On Day 4 prior to the first dose of plerixafor 
or placebo the PB CD34+ cell count was similar in both arms. On day 5, 10-11 hours after the first 
dose,  the  mean  PB  CD34+  cell  count  was  significantly  higher  (p<0.001)  in  the  G-CSF  +  plerixafor

group  (143.3  cells/µL)  compared  to  G-CSF  +  placebo  (67.3  cells/µL).  The  mean  fold  increase  was 
also significantly higher (p<0.001) in the plerixafor group. 
In  addition,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  <10,  <15  and  <20  PB  CD34+  cells  were  higher  in  the 
placebo group. 
Overall  survival  was  an  exploratory  efficacy  endpoint  as  well,  no  difference  between  the  treatment 
arms  were  seen.  Overall  survival:  7  patients  died  and  141  alive  in  the  plerixafor  group  versus  6 
patients died and 148 alive in the placebo group.  
Rescue procedure: Study 3101 
A total of 62 patients entered the rescue procedure: 10/150 (6.7%) of the patients in the G + plerixafor 
group and 52/148 (35.1%) of the patients in the G + placebo group. In the initial treatment/apheresis 
period, these patients failed to collect 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg (59 according to both central and local 
laboratory data; 3 patients [in the G + placebo group] collected ≥ 2 x 106 cells/kg according to central 
laboratory  data  but  not  according  to  local  laboratory  data).  After  entering  the  rescue  procedure,  37 
(59.7%) of the patients collected the minimum number of CD34+ cells required for transplantation (≥ 
2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) in 4 or fewer days of apheresis: 4/10 (40.0%) of the Rescue patients from the 
G  +  plerixafor  group  and  33/52  (63.5%)  of  the  Rescue  patients  from  the  G  +  placebo  group.  In 
addition,  7  of  the  patients who  collected ≥  2 x  106  CD34+  cells/kg  also  collected  ≥  5  x  106  CD34+ 
cells/kg in 4 or fewer days of apheresis (7/62, 11.3%; all from the G + placebo group). These results 
were based on the data provided in the Clinical Study Report dated 01 April 2008  at the time of MAA 
filing.  
Rescue Procedure: Study 3102 
The  Rescue  patients  were  patients  who  failed  mobilization  (i.e.,  who  did  not  collect  ≥  0.8  x  106 
CD34+ cells/kg after 2 days of apheresis, who did not collect at least 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg in 4 or 
fewer days of apheresis, or patients who were planned for tandem transplant and did not collect at least 
4  x  106  CD34+  cells/kg  in  4  or  fewer  apheresis  days)  and  chose  to  enter  the  open  label  rescue 
procedure.  Seven  patients  entered  the  rescue  procedure,  4  of  whom  did  not  collect  at  least  2  x  106 
CD34+ cells/kg (3 of these had been planned for tandem transplant), and 2 of whom were planned for 
tandem transplant and did not collect at least 4 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg according to the local laboratory 
(central  laboratory  values,  used  for  efficacy  parameters,  may  have  varied  from  these  results).  The 
seventh  rescue  patient  was  planned  for  a  tandem  transplant,  and  collected  exactly  4  x  106  CD34+ 
cells/kg according to the local laboratory, but collected fewer cells according to the central laboratory. 
All of these patients were initially treated with placebo in the randomized trial. 
During the rescue procedure, 7/7 (100%) of Rescue patients achieved a minimum target dose of ≥ 2 x 
106  cells/kg  in  4  or  fewer  apheresis  days,  while  2/7  (28.6%)  of  the  patients  achieved  the  primary 
endpoint of ≥ 6 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg in 2 or fewer apheresis days. Three of seven patients (42.9%) 
met the ≥ 6 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg in 4 or fewer apheresis days endpoint. Of the Rescue patients, 6/7 
were  initially  planned  to  receive  tandem  transplant,  and  in  the  rescue  procedure  4/6  of  these  (5/7 
overall). These results were based on the data provided in the Clinical Study Report dated 31 March 
2008  at the time of MAA filing. 
Rituximab patients 
A small number of patients could be enrolled in the study if they received rituximab (currently used in 
combination chemotherapy for NHL). There were 6 patients in the G-CSF + plerixafor and 7 patients 
in the G-CSF + placebo group. Nine of these 13 patients collected the minimum of CD34+ cells (≥ 2 x 
106 cells/kg) and 11 underwent transplantation. Durable grafts at 12 months were as follows: 4/4 in the 
G-CSF + plerixafor and 4/5 patients in the G-CSF + placebo group. These results were based on the 
data provided in the Clinical Study Report dated 28 October 2008.

- 1 Phase 2 study of plerixafor alone in patients with HIV 
- Compassionate Use Programme (CUP) of plerixafor in conjunction with G-CSF in oncology 
patients. 
- 6 ongoing clinical studies 
The following is a short summary of the results from these supportive studies. 
Study 2101 
This  was  a  multicentre,  crossover  study  in  25  patients  with  NHL  (n=15)  and  MM  (n=10).  Patients 
were randomly assigned to receive G-CSF + plerixafor or G-CSF alone as initial mobilising regimen, 
followed  by  a  2-week  washout  and  remobilisation  with  the  alternated  regimen.  After  8  patients  the 
dose from 160 µg/kg was raised to 240 µg/kg because equal or better CD34+ cell mobilisation was 
found with this dose in the healthy volunteer study and in 1 oncology study at that time. Additionally 
the start of plerixafor was changed from day 5 to day 4 and G-CSF run-in was changed from 3 to 4 
days. The initial study design was a randomised crossover study with patients randomised to either G-
CSF  +  plerixafor first  followed  by  G-CSF  alone  or  the  reverse.  After  12  patients  the  randomisation 
was removed and the remaining 13 patients received G-CSF alone in the mobilisation period.  
Primary objective 
To evaluate the difference in number of CD34+ cells/kg collected after mobilisation with G-CSF and 
plerixafor compared with that collected after mobilisation.

This was a single centre study to assess the efficacy and safety of G-CSF and plerixafor 240 µg/kg in 
patients with Hodgkin’s disease (n=22). The number of cells collected and the rate of failure to collect 
a minimum of  ≥ 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg were compared to historical controls that had mobilised with 
G-CSF alone.  
In- and exclusion criteria were similar to phase 3 studies (see above), with the exception of the waiting 
periods  for  chemotherapeutics  (at  least  1  week  from  last  dose  of  Velcade®  and  dexamethasone  in 
phase 3 studies) and the exclusion of the use of bone-seeking therapeutic radionuclides in the phase 3 
studies (not excluded in phase 2).  
Primary objective 
To  determine  the  proportion  of  HD  patients  who  had    ≥  5  x  106  CD  34+  cells/kg  after  HSC 
mobilisation with G-CSF and plerixafor. The number of PB HSCs collected and the rate of failure to 
collect ≥ 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg were compared to 2 sets of data generated from historical controls 
that had mobilised with G-CSF alone.

Study 2108 
In  this  study  9  patients  with  MM  were  mobilized  with  plerixafor  240  µg/kg  alone  for  up  to  4 
consecutive days. All patients achieved at least 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg and all were transplanted but 
only 6 were followed up 12 months after transplantation, all having durable grafts. Less than half of 
the patients achieved more than 4 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. Median times to PMN engraftment was 10.5 
days  and  the  median  time  to  PLT  engraftment  was  21  days  in  the  7  patients  (6  for  PLTs)  with 
engraftment data. The study was terminated early (originally 20 patients were planned for enrolment.  
Study 2105 
This open-label, single-arm, multi-center study evaluated the safety and efficacy of plerixafor injection 
240 µg/kg, used in addition to a standard 10 µg/kg G-CSF mobilization regimen, for the collection of 
peripheral blood stem cells for autologous transplantation. Enrolment ended when Phase 3 plerixafor 
trials were initiated. A total of 49 patients (23 NHL, 26MM) were enrolled and analyzed. The results 
are supportive of those for the studies 3101 and 3102 with identical treatment design.  
Study 2104  
This study assessed the safety and efficacy of plerixafor 240 µg/kg for HSC mobilization in patients 
with  MM  and  NHL  when  administered  at  least  6  days  following  a  regimen  of  mobilizing 
chemotherapy  and  G-CSF  10  µg/kg  daily.  40 (26  MM  and  14  NHL)  patients received a regimen  of 
mobilizing  chemotherapy  and  G-CSF,  following  which  1  apheresis  collection  was  performed  when 
CD34+  counts  of  ≥  20  cells/µL  were  measured  in  PB.  The  second  and  subsequent  apheresis 
collections  were  performed  following  plerixafor  treatment.  Mean  apheresis  yields  were  increased  in 
the  second  apheresis  (Day  2,  post-plerixafor),  when compared  with  the  first  (Day  1,  pre-plerixafor) 
apheresis, for both MM and NHL patient groups. Overall, 19 of 21 (90.5 %) patients with MM and 9 
of  13  (69.2  %)  patients  with  NHL  achieved  a  greater  apheresis  yield  on  Day  2.  In  a  subgroup  of 
patients the mean rate of increase of PB CD34+ cells was 4.75-fold greater following the first dose of 
plerixafor than the pre-plerixafor rate.

Study 2109  
Five  patients  with  MM  or  NHL  having  started  standard  G-CSF  mobilization  were  enrolled.  A  PB 
CD34+ cell count of 5 to 19 CD34+ cells/µL at Day 5 was required for study entry. If the patient’s PB 
CD34+ cell count on Day 5 was 5 to 7 cells/µL, then he/she was predicted to be a poor mobiliser. The 
patient did not undergo apheresis that day and received a dose of plerixafor 240 µg/kg in the evening. 
This process of an evening dosing with plerixafor followed by G-CSF and apheresis the next morning 
was repeated for up to a total of 3 days of apheresis or until ≥ 5 × 106 cells/kg were collected. The 
study was terminated early due to competing resources with the Phase 3 studies (planned enrolment 
was 15 patients) and no analyses of efficacy were made 
Study 2112 
In  this  ongoing  study,  40  patients  with  diagnoses  of  NHL  (27  patients),  MM  (5  patients),  HD  (6 
patients), AML (1 patient, before amendment), and desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DMRCT: 1 
patient)  were  enrolled  after  having  previously  failed  mobilization  (planned  enrolment  100  patients). 
Patients received G-CSF and plerixafor in the same posology as for the pivotal studies.  
Study 2102 
In this study, 10 patients with MM in Group A were required to have had a previous mobilization from 
which  they  were  unsuccessful  in  collecting  an  adequate  number  of  CD34+  cells  for  transplantation 
(usually ≥ 2 × 106 cells/kg). 10 patients enrolled in Group B were required to have received previous 
chemotherapy and G-CSF treatment as a mobilization regimen who, following recovery of their WBC 
count (> 2,000 cells/µL for at least 2 days), had a PB CD34+ count of 5 to 12 cells/µL. Or, patients in 
Group  B  were  required  to  have  received  extensive  prior  chemotherapy  and  a  pre-mobilization  PLT 
count of 100,000 to 150,000/µL (2 measurements obtained within 1 week). Patients in Group B were 
expected to yield total apheresis collections of < 1 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg, which would be insufficient 
for transplant. All 20 patients in group A and B received mobilizing treatment with daily G-CSF 10 
µg/kg  and  plerixafor  240  µg/kg.    Overall,  17  patients  received  either  1  or  2  transplants.  PMN 
engraftment was observed for all patients and PLT engraftment was observed for 16/17 patients (94.1 
%). No PLT engraftment data were recorded for 1 patient. All 12 patients assessed at 12 months post-
transplant were determined to have a durable graft.  
Study 2103 
In this study of safety and preliminary efficacy, 13 patients with NHL received plerixafor 240 µg/kg 
after 4 days of daily G-CSF 10-16 µg/kg, and were transplanted after apheresis with collection of  2-5 
x 106 CD34+ cells/kg.  
Study C201 
22 patients (8 NHL, 14 MM) in Canada were mobilized with G-CSF and plerixafor (same regimen as 
study 3101 and 3102), transplanted and followed. 
Study EU21  
35  patients  (4  NHL,  31  MM)  in  Germany  received  48  transplants  after  mobilization  with  G-CSF  + 
plerixafor  given  as  in  the  randomized  pivotal  studies  3101  and  3102.  Platement  engraftment  was 
achieved after a median of 11 days and PMN engraftment was achieved after a median of 14 days. In a 
laboratory  study,  G-CSF  +    plerixafor  mobilized  CD34+  PBPCs  from  3  patients  expressed 
significantly  higher  amounts  of  genes 
that  potentially  promote  superior  engraftment  after 
myeloablative  therapy  than  G-CSF  mobilized  CD34+  PBPCs  from  another  3  patients.  The  median 
number of PB CD34+ cells achieved as determined by the central lab was 7.4 x 106 cells/kg overall, 
8.3 x 106 cells/kg in patients with NHL, and 7.1 x 106 cells/kg in patients with MM. As determined by 
the central laboratory, 94% of patients reached the minimum target PB CD34+ cell collection of ≥ 2 x 
106 cells/kg. Two patients with MM did not meet the minimum target PB CD34+ cell collection; both 
patients were transplanted and successfully engrafted 
Study 2113 
In this study with planned enrolment of 30 patients, hitherto 20 patients with HD or NHL have been 
enrolled,  where  CD20+  lymphomas  have  received  rituximab  1  x  /  week  in  3  weeks  from  the  week 
53/79 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
before  starting  G-CSF  +  plerixafor  whereas  CD20-  lymphomas  have  received  only  G-CSF  + 
plerixafor.(data not shown). 
Study 2001 
This was a dose-escalating study in HIV patients investigating safety, pharmacokinetics  and antiviral 
activity of  intravenous plerixafor treatment up to doses 160 µg/kg/h for 10 consecutive days (data not 
shown). 
AMD3100-CUP (enrolment ongoing) 
The  compassionate  use  program  (CUP)  was  an  option  for  patients  who  had  failed  previous 
conventional therapies for stem cell collection or based upon a low PB CD34+ cell count following 
conventional therapy were not considered by the physician to have a reasonable chance of collecting 
enough cells  for autologous transplantation (data not shown). 
•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy  was  shown  by  2  randomized  placebo-controlled  studies  of  the  combination  of  G-CSF  + 
plerixafor  compared  to  G-CSF  +  placebo  in  NHL  and  MM  respectively  concerning  stem  cell 
mobilization and successful autologous transplantation. Consistent results were shown also in a study 
of  Hodgkin´s  disease.  In  addition,  the  combination  of  G-CSF  +  plerixafor  was  shown  to  be  more 
effective than G-CSF alone for harvest of CD34+ cells in all 25 patients in a cross-over study in NHL 
and MM. Several other studies support these findings of efficacy in combination with G-CSF.  
In  NHL,  70  (47.3%)  of  the  patients    being  treated  with  G-CSF  +  placebo  ,  collected  the  minimum 
number of CD34+ cells required for transplantation (≥ 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) in 4 or fewer days of 
apheresis during the first treatment phase. In contrast, for those poor mobilisers who did not reach the 
target  number  of  CD34+  cells  during  the  first  treatment  phase,    37  (59.7%)  of  them  collected  the 
minimum number of CD34+ cells required for transplantation  in 4 or fewer days of apheresis, after 
entering the rescue procedure. 
In  MM,  136  (88.3%)  of  the  patients    being  treated  with  G-CSF  +  placebo  ,  collected  the  minimum 
number of CD34+ cells required for transplantation (≥ 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) in 4 or fewer days of 
apheresis during the first treatment phase. In contrast, for those poor mobilisers who did not reach the 
target  number  of  CD34+  cells  during  the  first  treatment  phase,    7  (100%)  of  them  collected  the 
minimum  number  of  CD34+  cells  required  for  transplantation  in 4  or  fewer  days  of  apheresis,  after 
entering the rescue procedure. 
In contrast to the quantitative results of CD34+ cell numbers, engraftment data have not been shown 
advantageous for the combination of G-CSF + plerixafor compared to G-CSF alone. No dose-response 
relationship between plerixafor mobilized CD34+ cell numbers infused at transplantation and time to 
engraftment has been shown or evaluated although such a relationship was shown for both treatment 
arms when pooled together in studies 3101 and 3102.   
The following major objections were raised with regards to the clinical efficacy data submitted. 
1. The CHMP considered that a broad indication (patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma) was 
not approvable, mainly  because the possibility of tumour cell mobilization has not been sufficiently 
addressed  to  either  confirm  or  exclude  it.  Following  the  Applicant’s  responses,  tumour  cell 
mobilisation by plerixafor was only sought for in a limited number of patients. However, from these 
studies little or no mobilisation of tumour cells was detected, using the recommended dose.  
The mode of action of plerixafor, which is different from growth factors, is such that binding of the 
CXCR4  receptor,  which  is  present  also  on  tumour  cells,  may  enhance  mobilisation  of  tumour  cell. 
This effect may be dose dependent. If this effect is quantitative also the quantitative expression on the 
tumour  cell  may  play  a  role.  It  was  also  argued  that  growth  factors  like  G-CSF  may  also  mobilise 
54/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tumour cells, but it can equally  not be excluded that growth factors and plerixafor may mobilise stem 
cells  with  a  different  potential,  the  stem  cells  mobilised  by  plerixafor  being  in  part  the  cells  with 
malignant stem cell potential  
For  both  these  reasons  the  CHMP  warranted  caution  in  the  use  of  plerixafor  in  patients  with 
lymphoma and multiple myeloma, who are considered good mobilisers, even if these limited studies 
did not show a significant difference in the number of mobilised stem cells in both arms, determined 
with  markers  characteristic  for  mature  B  cells  or  plasma  cells.  An  overview  of  progression  free 
survival  in  the  pivotal  studies  presented  was  considered  necessary.    The  Applicant  committed  to 
extend  the  long-term  follow  (LTF)  up  for  our  two  controlled  Phase  3  studies  AMD3100-3101  and 
AMD3100-3102  to  5  years,  including  evaluation  of  relapse,  progression-free  survival  (PFS),  and 
overall survival. However, it should be noted that the original Phase 3 studies and the protocol for the 
long-term  follow-up  studies  were  not  designed  to  capture  PFS  (overall  survival  was  captured).  In 
addition  to  this,  special  warnings  for  the  potential  for  tumor  cell  mobilization  in  patients  with 
lymphoma  and  multiple  myeloma,  as  well  as  tumor  cell  mobilization  in  leukaemia  patients  were 
adequately reflected in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
For  patients  with  MM  and  lymphoma,  whose  cells  mobilise  poorly,,  treated  with  G-CSF  alone,  the 
CHMP considered that the risk benefit ratio was different to that of the overall population. Given that 
in  myeloma  and  in  relapsed  large  B  cell  lymphoma  the  chance  of  cure  is  greater  after  high  dose 
treatment,  it  was  considered  of    importance  to  make  an  effort  to  harvest  a  sufficient  transplant. 
However,  it  is  in  this  group  where  the  chance  of  mobilisation  of  tumour  cells  may  also  be  greater, 
because  poor  mobilisation  may  be  caused  by  infiltration  of  malignant  cells  in  the  bone  marrow. 
Therefore, the CHMP considered it important for the Applicant to obtain further data on tumour cell 
mobilisation  in the poor  mobilisor  group (compared with the  previous  mobilisation attempt  with  G-
CSF).  Hence,  tumour  cell  mobilisation  specifically  in  poor  mobilisers  will  be  addressed  by  the 
Applicant  by  evaluation  of  PFS  (as  well  as  other  long-term  outcomes)  by  use  of  a  registry,  in 
collaboration  with  EBMT.  To  this  effect,  the  Applicant  submitted  an  outline  of  the  design  of  the 
registry  (Proposed  Plan:  To  Demonstrate  The  Safety  Of  Mozobil  To  Mobilize  Stem  Cells  In  Poor 
Mobilisers With Lymphoma Or Multiple Myeloma). 
2.  The  CHMP  considered  that  it  remained  unclear  whether  Mozobil  could  induce  tumour  cell 
mobilization. Therefore, the Applicant was asked to present a review of the topics CXCR4 expression 
in myeloma and lymphoma (including Hodgkin´s disease) and to discuss whether CXCR4 should be 
considered  a  marker  for  tumour  stem  cells  in  these  malignant  disorders,  regarding  all  relevant  and 
modern  knowledge  from  the  literature  and  other  sources.  An  extensive  overview  was  given  on  the 
expression  of  the  CXCR4  receptor  expression  on  the  different  cells.  From  the  data  presented,    the 
CHMP noted that this receptor is also expressed on lymphoma and myeloma cells. The function of this 
receptor  and  the  effect  of  inhibition  remains  ill-understood  in  the  clinical  setting.  Therefore,  a 
mobilising  effect  on  lymphoma  and  myeloma  cells  was  neither  shown,  nor  excluded  in  the  data 
presented. Also a protective (e.g anti-apoptotic) effect on tumour cell elimination by chemotherapeutic 
agents  or  corticosteroids  was  suggested  in  cell  lines  and  not  excluded  in  the  therapeutic  setting.  In 
conclusion, the CHMP was of the opinion that these uncertainties underlined the precautions raised in 
the  first  major  objection  and  that  monitoring  not  only  of  cell  contamination  of  the  graft  but  also  of 
clinical  parameters  was  necessary.  To  this  effect,  the  Applicant  committed  to  extend  the  long-term 
follow  (LTF)  up  for  our  two  controlled  Phase  3  studies  AMD3100-3101  and  AMD3100-3102  to  5 
years,  including  evaluation  of  relapse,  progression-free  survival  (PFS),  and  overall  survival.  The 
Applicant  also  committed  to  assess  available  tumour  cell  mobilization  lymphoma  and/or  multiple 
myeloma  animal  models  that  could  provide  meaningful  data  comparing  different  mobilization 
regimens (See non-clinical discussion). 
3. The CHMP requested that the Applicant  justify the additional benefit of Mozobil over G-CSF alone 
in  the  broad  population.  The  Applicant  was  requested  to  discuss  the  apheresis  technique  and  its 
clinical  relevance  for  demonstrating  which  type  of  patients  may  benefit  from  plerixafor  therapy, 
considering the currently available therapeutic alternative of G-CSF.   In addition to this, the CHMP 
55/79 
 
 
 
 
 
requested the indication to include only poor mobilisers, as the clinical usefulness of plerixafor as add-
on therapy had been clearly shown for this subset of patients.  
In its responses, the Applicant clearly discussed the apheresis technique, which was deemed to be fully 
in  accordance  with the current international  guidelines.  However,  with regards  to  the  benefit/risk  of 
plerixafor for a broad population , the CHMP considered that no new information had been provided 
to modify their opinion to restrict the indication to poor mobilisers. Overall, addition of plerixafor may 
improve the success rate of mobilisation of enough haematological stem cells in some instances, but in 
all  other  aspects  (safety,  predictability  in  peak  CD34  content  or  number  of  aphereses)  G-CSF  was 
considered by CHMP to be reliable. In conclusion, the CHMP considered that an additional benefit of 
Mozobil in a broad indication was not substantiated. 
To address the risk of potential tumour cell mobilisation with plerixafor, the Applicant proposed the 
following measures to provide reassurance on the long-term safety of the drug: 
• 
• 
to extend the long- term follow-up (LTF) for the two controlled Phase 3 studies from 3 to 5 
years, including evaluation of relapse, progression-free survival, and overall survival. 
to develop with CHMP a long-term, post-approval transplant registry 
When consulted in this matter, the SAG-Oncology agreed that in an indication including patients with 
lymphoma and multiple myeloma without restrictions, more precise data about the risks of tumour cell 
mobilisation would be necessary in order to establish that the benefits outweigh the risks. However, in 
patients in whom mobilisation is, or can be expected to be, poor the risk was considered acceptable if 
there are no alternative treatment options for mobilisation. In this population careful long term follow-
up  was  recommended  in  order  to  rule  out  a  detriment  in  terms  of  PFS.  Any  available  safety  and 
efficacy  data  in  this  subgroup  alone  should  be  provided.    What  constitutes  “patients  in  whom 
mobilisation is, or can be expected to be, poor” was difficult to define although, generally, treatment 
with G-CSF alone should be given for at least 4 days before concluding that mobilisation is poor. In 
some situations, the previous treatment history may clearly indicate a high risk of poor mobilisation 
(e.g.,  multiple  treatments  with  fludarabine).  In  other  situations,  it  may  depend  on  the  planned 
treatment and how many cells one is aiming to mobilise. 
Based on this evidence, the CHMP agreed to restrict the indication to poor mobilisers, considered as 
patients who failed to reach enough CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood after stimulation with G-CSF 
+  chemotherapy  or  with  G-CSF  alone.  Given  that  the  number  of  CD34+  cells  needed  to  consider  a 
patients a poor mobiliser may vary in different transplant centres, the CHMP preferred not to define 
details on this subject and to leave the decision to the individual centres. 
4.  The  CHMP  requested  that  the  Applicant  clarify  the  apparently  low  efficacy  in  the  G-CSF  alone 
group. In its responses, the Applicant argued that differences in the definition of mobilisation failure, 
different  G-CSF  schedules  or  apheresis  techniques,  made  comparison  with  literature  data  difficult. 
However, these definitions were the same for the control arm and the study arm in the studies under 
evaluation.  The  doses  of  G-CSF  used  in  the  studies  (10mugr/kg  once  daily)  were  the  same  as 
recommended by the marketing authorisation holder for mobilisation after chemotherapy and mostly 
used in clinical practice.  
The CHMP noted that in general, one or two aphereses are sufficient to obtain the required amount of 
stem cells with this dose. A study, cited by the Applicant,  of Stiff et al. (2000) to confirm their data on 
the success rate in the G-CSF alone group, was performed in heavily pre-treated patients, not in the 
general population identified for autologous stem cell transplantation. In most protocols,  autologous 
stem cell transplantation is part of the first treatment (multiple myeloma) or is used in patients after 
induction  of  their  first  relapse  (chemosensitive  large  B  cell  lymphoma  patients).  In  the  survey  by 
Bensinger et al (2008) a failure rate was found between 5 and 30 %. Both studies underlined that in 
most  cases  mobilisation  with  G-CSF  is  successful,  which  makes  a  broad  indication  for  addition  of 
plerixafor not reasonable, as the use of this drug leads also to additional toxicity.  
56/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Several  characteristics  can  predict  failure,  such  as  pretreatment,  mobilising  chemotherapy  and 
(previous)  localisation  of  malignant  cells  in  the  bone  marrow.  The  best  indicator  for  mobilisation 
outcome is the estimation of CD34+ cells in the blood in advance of mobilisation. The CHMP noted 
that this was not scheduled in the studies under discussion: all patients proceeded to apheresis. This 
could also in part explain the relatively high failure rate. Overall, from the data given by the Applicant 
and from the cited literature, a sufficient explanation for the relative low mobilisation rate in the G-
CSF alone arm was not identified. 
When consulted on this matter, the SAG-Oncology stated it is difficult to speculate about the reasons 
for the observed results in the G-CSF alone arm. A number of important prognostic factors could have 
contributed to this observation, including definition of failure in published series, previous treatments, 
different  dose  and  G-CSF  regimens  with  or  without  chemotherapy,  indications  and  patient 
populations.  Overall, the  SAG  acknowledged  that  the  effect observed  for  GSF  alone  was  low  but  it 
was difficult to conclude on the significance of this result. In addition to this, the effect of Mozobil 
added  to  G-CSF  plus  chemotherapy  could  not  be  estimated  or  extrapolated  based  on  the  data 
submitted from the pivotal studies, which only concerned the addition of Mozobil to G-CSF alone. 
The following additional concerns were raised with regards to the clinical efficacy data submitted for 
this application. 
2.    The  CHMP  requested  that  the  Applicant  demonstrate  that  plerixafor  does  not  inhibit  CYP2A6, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2E1. The Applicant submitted results of such study and adapted the SPC 
accordingly: Plerixafor is not metabolized in vitro using human liver microsomes or human primary 
hepatocytes  and  does  not  exhibit  inhibitory  activity  in  vitro  towards  the  major  drug-metabolising 
CYP450 enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5) 
3. The CHMP  considered that the Applicant should attempt new ways of  analyzing and presenting 
data concerning the dose-response relationship between CD34+ cell numbers and time to engraftment, 
especially for the patients treated in the G-CSF + plerixafor arm of studies 3101 and 3102.  
According to the data submitted,  the median transplanted cell doses were thus 40% and 36% higher in 
the  plerixafor  treated  than  in  the  placebo  treated  groups  in  studies  3101  and  3102  respectively.  In 
addition  to  these  analyses,  some  further  descriptive  analyses  could  further  elucidate  the  actual 
relationships  between  cell  dose  and  haematodynamic  response.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  performed 
simple correlation plots for the plerixafor and placebo treatment arms separately showing relationships 
between transplanted cell doses and platelet (and other blood cell) counts as continuous variables for 
appropriately chosen time points.  
4.  The  Applicant  was  requested  to  discuss  the  impact  of  previous  treatments  (especially 
chemotherapies used before the mobilisation) on the effectiveness of plerixafor.  In the responses, the 
Applicant  concluded  that  the  use  of  prior  fludarabine  and  Revlimid  did  not  affect  CD34+  stem  cell 
mobilisation.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  although  the  number  of  patients  with  prior 
chemotherapywere  very  small,  the  data  provided  indicated  a  comparable  CD34+  stem  cell 
mobilisation in patients who had previously been treated with chemotherapy.

For poor mobilisers the mean (SD) cumulative dose of G-CSF / body weight was 82.6 µg/kg (± 41.7) 
and the mean number of administrations was 8.3. The mean cumulative dose of plerixafor was 906.0 
µg/kg / body weight (± 441.7) with an average of 3.8 administrations. 68.7 % of the poor mobilisers 
had  NHL,  25.2%  MM,  4.6%  HD  and  1.5%  other.  The  majority  had  stage  III  disease.  The  poor 
mobilisers  population  consisted  of  72  patients  from  phase  2  studies  and  59  patients  from  phase  3 
studies. 16/131 (11.9%) of the patients died. Twelve point two percent (12.2 %) of the poor mobilisers 
died.  All patients had prior chemotherapy and 35/131 (26.7%) had received prior radiotherapy  
Of  the  patients  in  all  oncology  studies,  all  patients  except  1  patient  in  the  G-CSF  +  placebo  had 
received  prior  chemotherapy,  27%  of  the  G-CSF  +  plerixafor  and  26%  of  the  G-CSF  +  placebo 
patients had received prior radiotherapy. Stage I and III disease were similar in both groups, however 
stage IV disease was greater in the G-CSF + plerixafor group (23%) compared to 17% of the G-CSF + 
placebo group.

the  pivotal  studies  3  patients  in  the  plerixafor  and  1  patient  in  the  placebo  arm  discontinued  due  to 
unacceptable AEs.

In the all oncology group, the most common reason for treatment period not completed was “other” 
which included: entry criteria not met, patient refusal to undergo additional aphaeresis, patient stopped 
aphaeresis due to poor collections and site error.  
•  Adverse events  
During  period  1  in  the  pivotal  phase  III  studies,  96.3%  of  G-CSF  +  plerixafor and  65.1%  G-CSF  + 
placebo  experienced  at  least  1  AE.  65.1%  of  G-CSF  +  plerixafor  and  42.7%  G-CSF  +  placebo 
experienced  an  AE  related  to  study  treatment.  An  overview  of  AEs  in  the  phase  III  studies  is

paraesthesia (mostly in > 10%), with diarrhoea, nausea and injection site reaction the most frequent in 
the plerixafor patients. Most AEs were mild-moderate. The incidence of AEs was generally lowest in 
HD patients; however this group was also the smallest.  
Thrombocytopenia was found more frequent in G-CSF + plerixafor in the oncology patients’ analysis 
compared to the phase 3 studies (2.2 versus 1.0%). Related AEs more frequently recorded in plerixafor 
during period 1 were: thrombocytopenia, injection site reaction, pyrexia, flatulence, vomiting, fatigue, 
peripheral oedema, catheter site pain, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, insomnia, diarrhoea, nausea 
and anxiety.  
For  poor  mobilisers  the  table  below  presents  the  incidence  of  AEs  and  SAEs.  During  period  1:  
126/131 (96.2%) of the poor mobiliser patients experienced at least 1 AE and 87/131 (66.4%) were 
considered to be related to study treatment.

The  most  frequently  occurring  side  effects  occurring  in  the  Phase  III  studies  are  summarised  in  the 
table  below,  and  were  nausea,  diarrhoea,  fatigue,  injection  site  reaction  (>5%)  and  were  mostly 
reported  in  period  1  when  plerixafor/placebo  and  G-CSF  was  administrated.  Diarrhoea,  nausea  and 
injection site reaction typically occurred more frequently in the plerixafor arm.  In addition, vomiting, 
oral  paraesthesia,  abdominal  pain  flatulence,  catheter  site  pain,  pyrexia,  peripheral  oedema,  and 
hypokalaemia  occurred  (5-10%).  Mucosal  inflammation  occurred  especially  in  period  2  and  can  be 
related to chemotherapy. The most common AEs in the poor mobilisers were comparable to the phase 
3 studies. In the oncology studies the most frequently occurring AEs in period 1 were also comparable 
to the phase 3 studies.

AEs occurring in >10% of patients in period 1 in either treatment group were: diarrhoea, nausea, bone 
pain,  fatigue,  injection  site  erythema,  headache,  paraesthesia,  back  pain,  hypokalaemia,  arthralgia, 
catheter  site  reaction  and  dizziness.  Bone  pain  is  a  common  adverse  event  of  G-CSF.  Diarrhoea, 
nausea, vomiting, flatulence, injection site erythema/pruritis and dizziness occurred more frequently in 
the G-CSF + plerixafor patients. The frequencies are presented in the table below.

•  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Phase 3 studies 
The proportion of patients with at least 1 SAE in Period 1 was low and was similar for the 2 treatment 
groups (4.0% for G-CSF + plerixafor compared with 5.8% for G-CSF + placebo).  The majority of the 
SAEs occurred in Periods 2 and 3, during which patients received ablative chemotherapy and were no 
longer  receiving  study  treatment  (plerixafor  or  placebo).  The  incidence  of  SAEs  was  (in  the  G  + 
plerixafor  versus  G  +  placebo  groups,  respectively):  22.3%  versus  20.3%  in  Period  2  and  16.2% 
versus 15.7% in Period 3.  Treatment discontinuation due to AEs was similar in G-CSF + plerixafor 
and G-CSF + placebo (both in 6 patients). 
Oncology studies 
In  Period  1,    SAEs  were  seen  in  3.9%  of  G-CSF  +  plerixafor  and  in  5.8%  of  G-CSF  +  placebo 
patients. The majority of SAEs occurred in Period 2 and 3: 18.4% and 15.8 resp in G-CSF + plerixafor 
versus  20.3  %  and  15.7%  resp.  in  G-CSF  +  placebo  patients.  Drug  hypersensitivity  occurred  in  2 
plerixafor patients versus none of the G-CSF placebo patients. Renal and urinary disorders occurred in 
7  plerixafor  patients  and  1  of  the  placebo  patients..  A  total  of  11  (2.0%)  of  the  patients  in  the  G  + 
plerixafor  group  and  6  (2.0%)  in  the  G  +  placebo  group  experienced  AEs  that  led  to  study 
discontinuation,  study  treatment  discontinuation,  or  treatment  modification.  54  Deaths  occurred  of 
whom 50 after transplantation (exception were 4 placebo patients which died before transplantation).  
Serious adverse events that were seen more frequently in plerixafor compared to placebo are presented 
in the table below.

There were 3 patients with SAEs in period 1 that were ascribed to study treatment; hypotension and 
dizziness (1 G-CSF + plerixafor patient), thrombocytopenia (1 G-CSF + plerixafor patient) and non- 
cardiac chest pain (1 G-CSF + placebo patient). 
Overall the incidence of patients with at least 1 SAEs was higher in plerixafor compared to placebo 
patients;  33.3%  versus  28.8%.  When  analysed  by  cancer  type;  the  MM  patients  had  the  highest 
incidences of vomiting, nausea and mucosal inflammation. There were 9 SAEs which were related to 
the study drug. Six patients experienced systemic reactions related to plerixafor with urticaria, anxiety, 
periorbital swelling, dyspnoea, hypoxia and hypotension and chest pain or tachycardia. 
Poor mobilisers 
Overall, the proportion of poor mobilisers with at least 1 serious adverse event was 35.9%, which was 
similar to that for the G+ plerixafor group in the Phase 3 studies (37.2%). 
Cardiovascular Disorders 
SAEs  as  cardiovascular  disorders  occurred  in  4/298  and  5/295  (resp  plerixafor  and  placebo)  of  the 
phase  3  studies,  deep  venous  thrombosis  4/298  and  1/295  and  hypotension  in  2/298  and  1/295  of 
plerixafor and placebo patients resp. In period 3 myocardial infarction (MI) was seen in 3 plerixafor (1 
death) and 1 placebo patient. Cardiac disorders were seen in 14/540 plerixafor patients in all oncology 
studies  versus  5/295  in  placebo  patients.  This  concerned  atrial  fibrillation  with  5  patients  in  both 
treatment  groups  and  the  rest  concerned  myocardial  infarction,  atrial  flutter,  cardiac  arrest,  cardiac 
congestive failure (in 9 plerixafor patients, mostly in period 3). In G-CSF + plerixafor in all periods 
cardiac disorders were seen in 10/131 patients and hypotension in 4/131 (poor mobilisers). A total of 7 
plerixafor-treated  patients had  myocardial  infarctions  (one  fatal),  occurring  14  days-10  months  after

the last  plerixafor  administration. Two  additional  patients had MI  in  the  CUP. Patients  with  cardiac 
arrhythmias were excluded from the phase 3 studies.  
Death or Treatment Discontinuation 
A  total of 108  patients died  in the  21 studies  and  compassionate  use  program;  88/1161  (7.6%)  who 
received plerixafor and 20/239 (8.4%) who received G-CSF + placebo. A total of 7/88 patients who 
died had received placebo and then entered the rescue procedure and received plerixafor.  
The incidence and causes of death were similar in G-CSF + placebo and G-CSF + plerixafor treated 
patients, with disease progression as the most common cause after transplantation (phase 3 studies, all 
oncology studies and poor mobilisers). It was stated that there were no noticeable differences between 
deaths in plerixafor or placebo patients.  
47  patients  experienced  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation,  or  study  treatment  discontinuation, 
interruption  or  modification;  38/1161  (3.3%)  who  ever  received  plerixafor  and  9/239  (3.8%)  who 
received placebo.  
Graft Failures 
There  were  two  graft  failures  (plerixafor  patients)  in  phase  3  studies;  which  were  stated  not  to  be 
related to the study treatment. One patient had MDS and the other had values defined as graft failure at 
day 100 but at 12 months there was no evaluable disease.  
Infections 
Infections:  were  seen  in  24.8%  in  the  plerixafor  and  21.1%  in  the  placebo  treated  patients. 
Staphylococcal infections were seen in 7 plerixafor patients and none of the placebo treated patients (4 
coagulase negative staphylococci). Other bacterial infections and lung infections were similar in both 
groups.  
Systemic Reactions 
In total, there were 6 plerixafor-treated patients with systemic (hypersensitivity) reactions including: 
urticaria (2), periorbital swelling (2), dyspnoea (1) hypoxia (1) and hypotension (1). In the phase III 
studies 7 placebo and 7 plerixafor treated patients experienced hypotension within 24 hours after drug 
administration. 
•  Laboratory findings 
Hypomagnesaemia  and  hypocalcaemia,  which  had  been  observed 
in  animal  studies  with 
supratherapeutic dose and also in some phase 2 studies, could not be detected in the pivotal clinical 
studies. Hypokalaemia was seen more frequently in plerixafor treated patients. 31.2% versus 23.0%. In 
addition, thrombocytopenia was more frequently seen in plerixafor 80.7% versus 71.9%.  
•  Safety in special populations 
No studies were conducted on plerixafor’s effect on the ability to drive. No specific studies evaluating 
the safety of plerixafor in elderly patients were conducted. However, a substantial number of  patients 
aged 65 years or more were evaluated in the pivotal trials.  The safety of plerixafor was evaluated in 8 
patients in CUP program, who were < 18 years, with NHL, medulloblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, brain 
tumour and oestrogenic sarcoma. The median age was 14 years. AEs reported were: nausea, vomiting, 
headache,  respiratory  failure,  progressive  encephalopathy,  citrate  toxicity,  coagulopathy,  catheter 
related complication, thrombocytopenia and injection site reaction.  
The  safety  of  plerixafor  in  patients  with  renal  failure  was  measured  in  an  open  label  phase  I  study. 
Patients  were  divided  into  3  cohorts:  creatinine  clearance  51-80  ml/min,  31-50  ml/min  and  <  31 
ml/min not requiring dialysis. Patients were followed for 48 hours after plerixafor administration. The 
primary objective was to assess effects of impaired renal function on the pharmacokinetics of single 
dose  of  240  µg  plerixafor  sc.  10/17  patients  with  renal  impairment  experienced  AEs  (58.5%);  none 
were severe. Most frequently reported AEs were: gastrointestinal (41.2%), nervous system disorders 
67/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(29.4%)  and  general  disorders  and  administration  site  reactions  (29.4%).  AEs  in  >  10%  of  patients: 
diarrhoea  (23.5%),  injection  site  erythema  (17.6%),  paraesthesia  (17.6)  and  injection  site  reaction 
(11.8%).  A  reduction  in  renal  clearance  of  plerixafor  was  observed  in  patients  with  creatinine 
clearance < 30 ml/min.  
•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  drug  interaction  studies  were  submitted,  given  that  there  are  no  critical  drug  interactions  to  be 
expected from the in vitro studies conducted. 
Tumour cell mobilisation 
Myeloma  cell  mobilisation  was  assessed  in  10  patients  with  MM  in  study  2101.  Determination  of 
aneuploid  myeloma  cells  was  made  by  flow  cytometry  which  measured  light  chain  cytoplasmic 
immunoglobulin content versus DNA content; the presence of 1% abnormal plasma cells in the bone 
marrow  or  peripheral  blood.  50  peripheral  blood  samples  were  analysed  in  10  patients.  One  patient 
had 2% kappa cells with DNA index of 1 and also contained 1% lambda cells with a DNA index of 1. 
The rest contained light chain restricted cells below 1%. No plasma cells with aneuploid DNA content 
were seen.  
Aphaeresis samples of 11 patients from study 3101 and 2101 were analysed with qBCL-2 assay, this 
can detect BCL-2 translocations down to 0.002% or 1/50.000 cells. No translocations were found in 
the  samples  of  plerixafor  treated  patients.  In  addition,  no  plerixafor  treated  patient  had  NHL  cells 
(assay sensitivity: 1 lymphoma cell in 10.000 cells).  
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall  47  patients  experienced  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation,  or  study  treatment  discontinuation, 
interruption  or  modification;  38/1161  (3.3%)  who  ever  received  plerixafor  and  9/239  (3.8%)  who 
received placebo. AEs that led to study discontinuation were similar in both treatment arms (2.0%) in 
the oncology studies (data not shown).   
•  Post marketing experience 
There is no postmarketing experience with plerixafor in the EU. 
•  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of plerixafor was considered established from the clinical studies submitted. 
A  total of 108  patients died  in the  21 studies  and  compassionate  use  program;  88/1161  (7.6%)  who 
ever received plerixafor and 20/239 (8.4%) who received G-CSF + placebo. A total of 7/88 patients 
who died had received placebo and then entered the rescue procedure and received plerixafor. Overall 
47  patients  experienced  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation,  or  study  treatment  discontinuation, 
interruption  or  modification;  38/1161  (3.3%)  who  ever  received  plerixafor  and  9/239  (3.8%)  who 
received placebo. The sample size of patients was considered limited for the detection of uncommon 
side effects.  
Most common AEs (> 10%) in the treatment period were: diarrhoea, nausea and injection site reaction; 
37.6%, 34.2% and 26.2% in the plerixafor + G-CSF versus 16.6%, 21.7% and 4.7% in the placebo + 
G-CSF  group.  Common  AEs  (≥1%  to  <10%)  were  headache,  dizziness,  flatulence,  abdominal  pain, 
vomiting,    abdominal  distension,    dry  mouth,    stomach  discomfort,  constipation,  dyspepsia, 
hypaesthesia  oral,  arthralgia,  hyperhidrosis,  erythema,  fatigue,  insomnia,  injection  site  reactions, 
malaise and injection site rash. 
AEs  that  were  related  to  study  medication  that  were  recorded  more  frequently  in  plerixafor  during 
period  1  were:  thrombocytopenia,  injection  site  reaction,  pyrexia,  flatulence,  vomiting,  fatigue, 
peripheral oedema, catheter site pain, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, insomnia and anxiety. Of the 
SAEs  hypotension,  cardiac  disorders,  deep  venous  thrombosis  and  the  systemic  reactions  seem  to 
occur more in plerixafor treated patients.  
68/79 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Importantly,  the  CHMP  consulted the  SAG-Oncology  with  regards  to the theoretical  risk  of  tumour 
cell  mobilisation  in  myeloma  and  lymphoma  patients.  Based  on  pharmacological  grounds,  SAG 
indicated that there is a risk of tumour cell mobilisation, and this is of additional concern as it may 
involve tumor cells that have become more resistant. Although the risk was considered a hypothesis at 
this  stage  (and  equally,  an  opposite  antitumour  effect  might  also  be  hypothesised  as  claimed  by  the 
applicant As there are  no relevant clinical or nonclinical data that provide reassurance about this risk 
of  tumour  cell  mobilisation,  he  SAG  recommended  that  data  from  adequate  non-clinical  models 
together with reliable PFS data with adequate follow-up (minimum follow-up in the order of 1-2 years 
for all  patients)  needed  to be  presented before this risk  could  be  considered  acceptable in the  broad 
population of patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma without further restrictions. 
In  its  responses,  the  Applicant  considered  that  the  best  approach  to  assess  the  clinical  relevance  of 
tumour  cell  contamination  would  be  to  assess  the  long-term  clinical  outcomes  of  patients  receiving 
transplanted haematopoietic stem cell products. Therefore, the Applicant has extended the long-term 
follow (LTF) up for our two controlled Phase 3 studies (AMD3100-3101 and AMD3100-3102) to 5 
years, including evaluation of relapse, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival. Tumour 
cell  mobilisation  specifically  in  poor  mobilisers  will  be  addressed  by  evaluation  of  PFS  (as  well  as 
other long-term outcomes) by use of a registry, in collaboration with EBMT.  The CHMP considered 
that  this  registry  should  include  patients  that  are  mobilised  with  1.  G-CSF  alone,  2.  G-CSF  plus 
chemotherapy, 3. G-CSF plus chemotherapy and Mozobil. Also patients with off label use should be 
examined.  In  addition,  the  CHMP  requested  that  the  Applicant  present  a  detailed  proposeal  for  the 
registry. 
Based on the clinical safety studies submitted, the following concerns were also identified: 
1.  The  CHMP  requested  that  the  Applicant  provide  more  detailed  information  of  all  patients 
experiencing systemic drug reactions in phase I, II, and III studies to assess the importance of systemic 
anaphylactic reactions, given that this is a major health concern, and underestimation of the problem 
could happen on the basis of the limited data provided thus far. Following the Applicant’s responses 
the CHMP concluded that the systemic reactions reported were generally mild to moderate and their 
incidence was very low (0.7%), making this adverse drug reaction acceptable. 
2.  The CHMP requested that the Applicant justify not restricting the indication to patients with proven 
CXCR4  negative  tumours  given  that  the  disruption  of  the  binding  between  CXCR4  and  SDF-1  by 
plerixafor  must  be  assumed  to  result  in  the  mobilisation  of  tumour  cells.    The  CHMP,  taking  into 
consideration the Applicant’s responses, concluded that the Applicant should provide additional data 
on  the  extent  to  which  plerixafor  could  induce  tumour  cell  mobilisation.  Given  that  this  is  a 
considerable  safety  concern  in  the  pharmacotherapeutic  class  of  growth  factors,  a  new  medicinal 
product such as plerixafor, with similarities in the mechanism of action, should require clinical data to 
exclude the possibility of tumour cell mobilisation.  Therefore, the Applicant conducted a review of 
CXCR4  expression  in  myeloma  and  lymphoma  patients,  and  discussed  whether  CXCR4  should  be 
considered a marker for tumour stem cells in these malignant disorders. 
3. The CHMP requested that the Applicant further discussed the incidence of cardiovascular disorders 
amongst the plerixafor + G-CSF treated patients and the placebo + G-CSF treated patients. Based on 
the  Applicant’s  responses,  which  included  a  QTc  study,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  incidence  of 
several cardiac disorders was not higher in patients treated with plerixafor compared to placebo except 
for  myocardial  infarction.  Therefore,  in  Section  4.8  of  the  SPC,  this  adverse  event  was  sufficiently 
reflected. 
Given  that  the  company  submitted  data  from  the  QT-study,  in  which  signs  and  symptoms  of 
hypotension  were  observed,  a  warning  on  manifestations  of  vasovagal  reactions  was  included  in 
sections 4.8 and 4.4  of the SPC. 
4. The CHMP requested that the Applicant discuss two graft failures in the phase III studies, which 
were  only  seen  in  patients  receiving  plerixafor.  From  the  total  safety  database  submitted  by  the 
69/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Applicant, 4 out of 1400 patients developed graft failure. The CHMP considered that an incidence of < 
0.3% graft failure is low, acceptable, and in line with the published literature. 
5. The Applicant was asked to discuss central nervous system adverse events observed in the clinical 
setting, given that plerixafor could potentially directly induce such effects. Based on the Applicant’s 
responses,  the  CHMP  noted  that  headache,  dizziness,  paraesthesias,  diarrhoea,  nausea  and  vomiting  
were duly included in Section 4.8 of the SPC. 
6. Hyperleukocytosis (WBC count above 100 x109/l) occurred in at least one patient given G-CSF + 
plerixafor  (study  3101).  The  Applicant  was  therefore  asked  to  provide  a  review  of  cases  with 
hyperleukocytosis with or without symptoms from all clinical studies / CUP and to make suggestions 
on  how  to  reduce  the  risks.  From  the  review  provided  by  the  Applicant,  the  CHMP  concluded  that 
hyperleukocytosis was indeed more frequent in Mozobil-treated patients. However, the occurrence of 
to  only  one  associated  manifestations,  i.e.  dyspnoea,  was  uncommon  and  temporary.  No  relevant 
thrombotic events related to hyperleukocytosis were observed. In summary, the data did not suggest 
that  plerixafor  conferred  an  increased  risk  of  adverse  events  associated  with  hyperleucocytosis 
syndrome.      To  this effect,    the  following  text special  precaution  was  included in  section  4.4  of the 
SPC:  Administration of Mozobil in conjunction with G-CSF increases circulating leukocytes as well 
as haematopoietic stem cell populations. White blood cell counts should be monitored during Mozobil 
therapy.  Clinical  judgment  should  be  exercised  when  administering  Mozobil  to  patients  with 
peripheral blood neutrophil counts above 50,000 cells/µl.  
7.  The  CHMP  noted  a  tendency  towards  more  infections  after  tandem  transplantation  in  G-CSF  + 
plerixafor mobilized patients than for the G-CSF + placebo tandem transplant group, implying vague 
questions regarding the quality of the stem cells after storage for the patients treated with plerixafor 
mobilization. Therefore, the  Applicant  was asked  to investigate  the  quality  of  stored harvested  stem 
cells  after  varying  durations  by  methods  including  CFU  enumerations,  comparing  this  between  the 
treatment  groups  and  generally  discussing  the  engraftment  quality  of  the  stem  cell  products  after 
storage.  
From the Applicant’s responses, the data indicate that the engraftment quality of the harvested stem 
cells  was  not  adversely  impacted  by  the  storage  conditions  utilized  in  the  plerixafor  clinical  trials.  
Identical storage conditions would be expected in the clinical use of the marketed product.  Therefore, 
the  Applicant  did  not  consider  an  additional  study  assessing  engraftment  quality  after  varying 
durations of storage to be necessary, and committed to monitor adverse events in tandem transplanted 
patients. The CHMP was in agreement with the Applicant with regards to this point. 
8.  Section  4.4  of  the  SPC  was  amended  to  include  the  amount  of  sodium  in  the  formulation  of 
plerixafor:  
Sodium 
Mozobil contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium- free’.

Potential for tumour cell mobilisation in 
patients with lymphoma and multiple 
myeloma 
The effect of potential re-infusion of 
tumour cells has not been adequately 
studied. 
When Mozobil is used in conjunction with 
G-CSF for haematopoietic stem cell 
mobilisation in patients with lymphoma or 
multiple myeloma‚ tumour cells may be 
released from the marrow and subsequently 
collected in the leukapheresis product. The 
clinical relevance of the theoretical risk of 
tumour cell mobilisation is not fully 
elucidated. In clinical studies of patients 
with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and 
multiple myeloma, mobilisation of tumour 
cells has not been observed with plerixafor.  
Tumour cell mobilisation in leukaemia 
patients 
In a compassionate use programme, 
Mozobil and G-CSF have been 
administered to patients with acute 
myelogenous leukaemia and plasma cell 
leukaemia.  In some instances, these 
patients experienced an increase in the 
number of circulating leukaemia cells. For 
the purpose of haematopoietic stem cell 
mobilisation, plerixafor may cause 
mobilisation of leukaemic cells and 
subsequent contamination of the apheresis 
product.  Therefore, plerixafor is not 
recommended for haematopoietic stem cell 
mobilisation and harvest in patients with 
leukaemia.

Splenomegaly 
In preclinical studies, higher absolute and

extramedullary haematopoiesis were 
observed following prolonged (2 to 4 
weeks) daily plerixafor subcutaneous 
administration in rats at doses 
approximately 4 fold higher than the 
recommended human dose. 
The effect of plerixafor on spleen size in 
patients has not been specifically evaluated 
in clinical studies. The possibility that 
plerixafor in conjunction with G-CSF can 
cause splenic enlargement cannot be 
excluded.  Due to the very rare occurrence 
of splenic rupture following G-CSF 
administration, individuals receiving 
Mozobil in conjunction with G-CSF who 
report left upper abdominal pain and/or 
scapular or shoulder pain should be 
evaluated for splenic integrity.

Posology and method of administration 
Section 4.2 
Renal impairment 
Patients with creatinine clearance 
20-50 ml/min should have their dose of 
plerixafor reduced by one-third to 
0.16 mg/kg/day (see section 5.2). Clinical 
data with this dose adjustment are limited. 
There is insufficient clinical experience to 
make alternative posology 
recommendations for patients with a 
creatinine clearance <20 ml/min, as well as 
to make posology recommendations for 
patients on haemodialysis. 
Based on increasing exposure with 
increasing body weight the dose should not 
exceed 27 mg/day if the creatinine 
clearance is lower than 50 ml/min.

3.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are 
no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology  
The  results  from  single  dose  subcutaneous  studies  in  rats  and  mice  showed  plerixafor  can  induce 
transient  but  severe  neuromuscular  (uncoordinated  movement),  sedative-like  effects  (hypoactivity), 
dyspnoea,  ventral  or  lateral  recumbency,  and/or  muscle  spasms.    Additional  effects  of  plerixafor 
consistently noted in repeated dose animal studies included increased levels of circulating white blood 
cells  and  increased  urinary  excretion  of  calcium  and  magnesium  in  rats  and  dogs,  slightly  higher 
spleen  weights  in  rats,  and  diarrhoea  and  tachycardia  in  dogs.  Histopathology  findings  of 
extramedullary haematopoiesis were observed in the liver and spleen of rats and/or dogs.  One or more 
of  these  findings  were  usually  observed  at  systemic  exposures  in  the  same  order  of  magnitude  or 
slightly higher as the human clinical exposure.  
Safety  pharmacology  studies  with  IV  administered  plerixafor in  rats  showed  respiratory  and  cardiac 
depressant  effects  at  systemic  exposure  slightly  above  the  human  clinical  exposure,  whilst  SC 
administration elicited respiratory and cardiovascular effects only at higher systemic levels. 
SDF-1α  and  CXCR4  play  major  roles  in  embryo-foetal  development.  Plerixafor  has  been  shown  to 
cause  increased  resorptions,  decreased  foetal  weights,  retarded  skeletal  development  and  increased 
foetal  abnormalities  in  rats  and  rabbits.  Data  from  animal  models  also  suggest  modulation  of  foetal 
haematopoiesis,  vascularisation,  and  cerebellar  development  by  SDF-1α  and  CXCR4.  Systemic 
exposure at No Observed Adverse Effect Level for teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits was of the 
same magnitude or lower as found at therapeutic doses in patients. This teratogenic potential is likely 
due to its pharmacodynamic mechanism of action. 
In  rat  distribution  studies  concentrations  of  radiolabelled  plerixafor  was  detected  in  reproductive 
organs  (testes,  ovaries,  uterus)  two  weeks  after  single  or  7 daily  repeated  doses  in  males  and  after 
7 daily repeated doses in females. The elimination rate from tissues was slow. 
The potential effects of plerixafor on male and female fertility and post-natal development have not 
been evaluated in non-clinical studies.  
Carcinogenicity studies with plerixafor have not been conducted. Plerixafor was not genotoxic in an 
adequate battery of genotoxicity tests. 
Plerixafor  inhibited  tumour  growth  in  in  vivo  models  of  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma,  glioblastoma, 
medulloblastoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia when dosed intermittently. An increase of non-
75/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma  growth  was  noted  after  a  continuous  administration  of  plerixafor for 28  days. 
The potential risk associated with this effect is expected to be low for the intended short term duration 
of dosing plerixafor in humans.  
Efficacy 
Plerixafor is a bicyclam derivative, a selective reversible antagonist of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor 
and  blocks  binding  of  its  cognate  ligand,  stromal  cell-derived  factor-1α  (SDF-1α),  also  known  as 
CXCL12. Plerixafor-induced leukocytosis and elevations in circulating haematopoietic progenitor cell 
levels are thought to result from a disruption of CXCR4 binding to its cognate ligand, resulting in the 
appearance of both mature and pluripotent cells in the systemic circulation. CD34+ cells mobilised by 
plerixafor are functional and capable of engraftment with long-term repopulating capacity. 
In  two  Phase  III  randomised-controlled  studies  patients  with  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  or  multiple 
myeloma  received  Mozobil  0.24 mg/kg  or  placebo  on  each  evening  prior  to  apheresis.  Patients 
received  daily  morning  doses  of  G-CSF  10 µg/kg  for  4 days  prior  to  the  first  dose  of  plerixafor  or 
placebo  and  on  each  morning  prior  to  apheresis.  Optimal  (5  or  6 x 106 cells/kg)  and  minimal 
(2 x 106 cells/kg) numbers of CD34+ cells/kg within a given number of days, as well as the primary 
composite  endpoints  which  incorporated  successful  engraftment  are  presented  in  the  SPC;  the 
proportion  of  patients  reaching  optimal  numbers  of  CD34+  cells/kg  by  apheresis  day  are  also 
presented. 
Rescue patients 
In study AMD3100-3101, 62 patients (10 in the Mozobil + G-CSF group and 52 in the placebo + G-
CSF  group),  who  could  not  mobilise  sufficient  numbers  of  CD34+  cells  and  thus  not  could  not 
proceed to transplantation, entered into an open-label Rescue procedure with Mozobil and G-CSF. Of 
these  patients,  55  %  (34  out  of  62)  mobilised  ≥ 2 x106/kg  CD34+  cells  and  had  successful 
engraftment. In study AMD3100-3102, 7 patients (all from the placebo + G-CSF group) entered the 
Rescue procedure. Of these patients, 100% (7 out of 7) mobilised ≥ 2 x106/kg CD34+ cells and had 
successful engraftment. 
The dose of haematopoietic stem cells used for each transplant was determined by the investigator and 
all  haematopoietic  stem  cells  that  were  collected  were  not  necessarily  transplanted.  For transplanted 
patients in the Phase III studies, median time to neutrophil engraftment (10-11 days), median time to 
platelet  engraftment  (18-20 days)  and  graft  durability  up  to  12  months  post-transplantation  were 
similar across the Mozobil and placebo groups. 
Mobilisation and engraftment data from supportive Phase II studies (plerixafor 0.24 mg/kg dosed on 
the  evening  or  morning  prior  to  apheresis)  in  patients  with  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma,  Hodgkin’s 
disease, or multiple myeloma were similar to those data for the Phase III studies. 
In  the  placebo-controlled  studies,  fold  increase  in  peripheral  blood  CD34+ cell  count  (cells/µl)  over 
the  24-hour  period  from  the  day  prior  to  the  first  apheresis  to  just  before  the  first  apheresis  was 
evaluated.  During  that  24-hour  period,  the  first  dose  of  plerixafor  0.24 mg/kg  or  placebo  was 
administered 10-11 hours prior to apheresis. 
In  pharmacodynamic  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  of  plerixafor  alone,  peak  mobilisation  of  CD34+ 
cells  was  observed  from  6  to  9 hours  after  administration.  In  pharmacodynamic  studies  in  healthy 
volunteers of plerixafor in conjunction with G-CSF administered at identical dose regimen to that in 
studies in patients, a sustained elevation in the peripheral blood CD34+ count was observed from 4 to 
18 hours after plerixafor administration with peak response between 10 and 14 hours. 
Safety 
Safety data for Mozobil in conjunction with G-CSF in patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma 
were  obtained  from  2  placebo-controlled  Phase  III  studies  and  10  uncontrolled  Phase  II  studies  in 
543 patients.  Patients  were  primarily  treated  with  daily  doses  of  0.24 mg/kg  plerixafor  by 
76/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subcutaneous injection. The exposure to Mozobil in these studies ranged from 1 to 7 consecutive days 
(median = 2 days). 
In the two Phase III studies in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and multiple myeloma patients (AMD3100--
3101  and  AMD3100-3102,  respectively),  a  total  of  301  patients  were  treated  in  the  Mozobil  and 
G-CSF group and 292 patients were treated in the placebo and G-CSF group. Patients received daily 
morning  doses of  G-CSF  10 µg/kg  for  4 days  prior to  the  first  dose  of  plerixafor  or  placebo and on 
each morning prior to apheresis. Adverse reactions that occurred more frequently with Mozobil and G-
CSF  than  placebo  and  G-CSF  and  were  reported  as  related  in  ≥1%  of  the  patients  who  received 
to 
Mozobil,  during  haematopoietic 
chemotherapy/ablative treatment in preparation for transplantation are listed in section 4.8 of the SPC.  
From  chemotherapy/ablative 
through  12 months 
post-transplantation,  no  significant  differences  in  the  incidence  of  adverse  reactions  were  observed 
across treatment groups.  
stem  cell  mobilisation  and  apheresis  and  prior

treatment 
The  adverse  reactions  reported  in  patients  with  lymphoma  and  multiple  myeloma  who  received 
Mozobil  in  the  controlled  Phase  III  studies  and  uncontrolled  studies,  including  a  Phase  II  study  of 
Mozobil  as  monotherapy  for  haematopoietic  stem  cell  mobilisation,  are  similar.  No  significant 
differences in the incidence of adverse reactions were observed for oncology patients by disease, age, 
or gender. 
Myocardial infarction 
In clinical studies, 7 of 676 oncology patients experienced myocardial infarctions after haematopoietic 
stem  cell  mobilisation  with  Mozobil  and  G-CSF.  All  events  occurred  at  least  14 days  after  last 
Mozobil  administration.  Additionally,  two  female  oncology  patients  in  the  compassionate  use 
programme  experienced  myocardial  infarction  following  haematopoietic  stem  cell  mobilisation  with 
Mozobil and G-CSF. One of these events occurred 4 days after last Mozobil administration. Lack of 
temporal  relationship  in  8 of 9 patients  coupled  with  the  risk  profile  of  patients  with  myocardial 
infarction does not suggest Mozobil confers an independent risk for myocardial infarction in patients 
who also receive G-CSF. 
Hyperleukocytosis 
White  blood  cell  counts  of  100 x 109/l  or  greater  were  observed,  on  the  day  prior  to  or  any  day  of 
apheresis,  in  7%  patients  receiving  plerixafor  and  in  1%  patients  receiving  placebo  in  the  Phase  III 
studies. No complications or clinical symptoms of hyperleukocytosis were observed. 
Vasovagal reactions 
In  Mozobil  oncology  and  healthy  volunteer  clinical  studies,  less  than  1%  of  subjects  experienced 
vasovagal  reactions  (orthostatic  hypotension  and/or  syncope)  following  subcutaneous  administration 
of  plerixafor  doses  ≤  0.24 mg/kg.  The  majority  of  these  events  occurred  within  1  hour  of  Mozobil 
administration.  
Gastrointestinal disorders 
In Mozobil clinical studies of oncology patients, there have been rare reports of severe gastrointestinal 
events, including diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. 
Paraesthesiae 
Paraesthesiae  are  commonly  observed  in  oncology  patients  undergoing  autologous  transplantation 
following multiple disease interventions. In the placebo-controlled Phase III studies, the incidence of 
paresthesiae was 20.6% and 21.2% in the Mozobil and placebo groups, respectively. 
Elderly patients 
In  the  two  placebo-controlled  clinical  studies  of  Mozobil,  24%  of  patients  were  ≥ 65  years  old.  No 
notable differences in the incidence of adverse reactions were observed in these elderly patients when 
compared with younger ones.

Risk-benefit assessment 
The composite secondary endpoint as requested by the scientific advice by the EMEA, consisted of a 
target number of CD34+ cells/kg and successful PMN and PLT engraftment. The results of both phase 
3  studies  showed   that  more  patients in the  plerixafor  +  G-CSF  group  reached the target  number  of 
CD34+  cells  (a  minimum  of  2  x  106  CD34+  cells/kg  and  preferable  5  x  106  CD34+  cells/kg)  and 
successful  engraftment    compared  to  the  patients  treated  with  G-CSF  alone.  Additionally,  G-CSF  + 
plerixafor mobilised the target CD34+ cells in fewer days of apheresis. These results were supported 
by the (limited) data of the phase 2 supportive studies. Importantly, clinical relevance of plerixafor has 
been shown in both phase 3 trials for a specific subgroup population (poor mobilisers). 
In study AMD3100-3101 I70 (47.3%) of the patients  being treated with G-CSF + placebo , collected 
the minimum number of CD34+ cells required for transplantation (≥ 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) in 4 or 
fewer days of apheresis during the first treatment phase. In contrast,  62 patients (10 in the Mozobil + 
G-CSF group and 52 in the placebo + G-CSF group), who could not mobilise sufficient numbers of 
CD34+  cells  and  thus  not  could  not  proceed  to  transplantation,  entered  into  an  open-label  Rescue 
procedure with Mozobil and G-CSF. Of these patients, 37 (59.7%) collected the minimum number of 
CD34+ cells required for transplantation after treatment with G-CSF + plerixafor in 4 or fewer days of 
apheresis. 34 (55%) patients mobilised ≥ 2 x106/kg CD34+ cells and had successful engraftment 
In study AMD3100-3102, 136 (88.3%) of the patients  being treated with G-CSF + placebo , collected 
the minimum number of CD34+ cells required for transplantation (≥ 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) in 4 or 
fewer days of apheresis during the first treatment phase. In contrast, 7 patients (all from the placebo + 
G-CSF  group)  entered  the  Rescue  procedure.  All  of  these  patients  (100%)  mobilised  ≥ 2 x106/kg 
CD34+ cells and had successful engraftment.  
However,  the  CHMP  noted  certain  risks  and  uncertainties  with  regard  to  this  medicinal  product. 
Frequently observed adverse events related to plerixafor during its administration and apheresis were: 
thrombocytopenia,  injection  site  reaction,  pyrexia,  flatulence,  vomiting,  fatigue,  peripheral  edema, 
catheter  site  pain,  hypokalaemia,  hypomagnesaemia,  insomnia  and  anxiety.  With  regard  to  
hypotension,  cardiac  disorders,  deep  venous 
thrombosis,  systemic  reactions,  hypokalaemia, 
thrombocytopenia,  hypomagnesaemia,  and  paraesthesia,  the  Applicant  provided  sufficient  additional 
information,  and  these  AE  issues  have  been  adequately  addressed  either  in  the  RMP  or  follow-up 
procedures.  In  particular,  the  SPC  contains  a  warning  concerning  myocardial  infarction  and 
manifestations  of  vasovagal  reactions  (including  orthostatic  hypotension  and/or  syncope).  From  the 
safety database including a recently performed phase 1 QT study, hypotension and manifestations of 
hypotension (vasovagal syncope/postural syncope) were observed. The QT-study showed no influence 
of Mozobil on the QT variables on the ECG. 
Clinical and preclinical concerns were raised regarding tumour mobilisation. As a result, the Applicant 
provided  data  addressing  to  what  extent  Mozobil  could  induce  tumor  cell  mobilisation  or  not 
depending  on  CXCR4  expression,  and  the  consequences  of  any  such  effects  for  the  long  term 
outcome. Additionally, the Applicant agreed to extend the long-term follow-up of for two controlled 
phase  III  studies  to  5  years,  including  evaluation  of  relapse,  progression-free  survival  and  overall 
survival.  Tumour  cell  mobilization  specifically  in  poor  mobilisers  will  be  addressed  as  a  follow-up 
measure  by  evaluation  of  long-term  outcomes  by  use  of  a  registry  in  collaboration  with  EBMT.  In

addition, the Applicant also committed to assess available tumor cell mobilization lymphoma and/or 
multiple  myeloma  animal  models,  comparing  different  mobilization  regimens  for  tumor  cell 
mobilization. 
Patients with renal clearance <30 ml/min showed a reduction in renal clearance of plerixafor. For the 
safe use of plerixafor in this patient population it was deemed necessary to know whether reduction of 
plerixafor dose was enough to reduce accumulation of plerixafor in this patient group or that reduction 
in frequency of administration was also required. To this effect, the following text was included in the 
SPC: Patients with creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min should have their dose of plerixafor reduced by 
one-third  to  0.16 mg/kg/day  (see  section  5.2).  Clinical  data  with  this  dose  adjustment  are  limited. 
There  is  insufficient  clinical  experience  to  make  alternative  posology  recommendations  for  patients 
with a creatinine clearance <20 mL/min, as well as to make posology recommendations for patients on 
haemodialysis. 
Furthermore, increased exposure in obese patients may result in increased AE in the very heavy, and 
probably a maximum dose needed to be indicated, to avoid high exposure in the very heavy. To this 
effect, the following text was included in the SPC: Based on increasing exposure with increasing body 
weight the dose should not exceed 27 mg/day if the creatinine clearance is lower than 50 ml/min. 
Therefore,  based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  balance  between 
efficacy and safety was not in favour of approving plerixafor for a broad indication. Although Mozobil 
demonstrated  efficacy  concerning  haematopoietic  stem  cell  mobilisation  and  no  negative  effect  on 
durable  engraftment,  there  was  no  additional  efficacy  of  plerixafor  on  the  engraftment  variables 
compared to G-CSF alone. The CHMP concluded that the efficacy on the population of MM and NHL 
patients as a whole had not been proven for plerixafor.  
In  contrast,  the  clinical  efficacy  of  plerixafor  +  G-CSF  has  been  observed  in  poor  mobilisers. 
Plerixafor shows clinical efficacy in NHL and MM patients that undergo mobilisation for autologous 
HSC transplantation and who have shown to be poor mobilisers after initial mobilisation with G-CSF 
alone  (first  line  treatment).  For  this  specific  population,  plerixafor  was  considered  approvable  as 
second line treatment.   
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
(cid:131)   routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
(cid:131)  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
Therefore,  the  overall  Benefit/Risk  ratio  of  Mozobil  is  positive  as  second  line  treatment  for  the 
specific population of patients whose cells mobilize poorly. 
There  is  no  universally  accepted  definition  of  “poor  mobilisers”  but  some  centres  would  regard  as 
poor  mobilisers  those  patients  that  after  adequate  dosage  of  G-CSF  do  not  reach   CD34+  cells > 
20 x 106/l  in  the  peripheral  blood  or  do  not  reach  within  4  days  of  apheresis  a  total  of  5  x  106/kg 
CD34+ cells in the harvest. 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Mozobil  in  combination  with  G-CSF  to  enhance 
mobilisation  of  haematopoietic  stem  cells  to  the  peripheral  blood  for  collection  and  subsequent 
autologous  transplantation  in  patients  with  lymphoma  and  multiple  myeloma  whose  cells  mobilise 
poorly as favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

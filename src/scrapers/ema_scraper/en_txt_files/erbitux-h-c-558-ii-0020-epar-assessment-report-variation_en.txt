1.  
Introduction 
Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody specifically directed against the epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR-signalling pathways are involved in the control of cell survival, cell-
cycle progression, angiogenesis, cell migration and cellular invasion (metastases). Cetuximab binds to 
EGFR with an affinity 5 to 10 times higher than that of endogenous ligands and blocks their binding 
resulting in inhibition of the function of the receptor. It further induces internalization and down-
regulation of EGFR. It also triggers antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
Erbitux is currently authorised for the indications:  
•  Erbitux in combination with irinotecan is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer after failure 
of irinotecan-including cytotoxic therapy. 
•  Erbitux in combination with radiation therapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
locally advanced squamous cell cancer of head and neck (SCCHN) 
On the basis of the data submitted by the Marketing Authorisation holder and additionally as requested 
by the CHMP, the indication related to colorectal cancer is revised as follows:  
Erbitux is indicated for the treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-
expressing, KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.  
• 
• 
in combination with chemotherapy 
as a single agent in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based therapy and who 
are intolerant to irinotecan 
2. 
Clinical aspects 
Clinical studies on cetuximab as single agent or in combination with irinotecan-based regimens 
included in the current submission for metastatic CRC are presented in Table 1.

NOTE: Studies EMR 62 202-018 and 021 were completed as of 31 July 2007. Study EMR 62 202-047 was completed for the primary 
efficacy analysis on this date. In the updated report submitted with this addendum the study was completed for all efficacy endpoints except 
survival. 
The 4-arm phase III study 80203 sponsored by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 
compared FOLFIRI and FOLFOX with or without cetuximab in previously untreated subjects had to 
be prematurely closed due to slow accrual. A confirmatory phase III study in this setting (COIN) 
sponsored by the Medical Research Council (UK) is still recruiting patients.  
A direct comparison of cetuximab with the VEGF targeting antibody bevacizumab is being 
investigated in a study in the USA. This randomized, controlled, 3-arm, phase III study 80405 is 
sponsored by the CALGB (Cancer and Leukemia Group B) and SWOG (South West Oncology 
Group) and compares FOLFOX or FOLFIRI (investigator’s choice) in combination with bevacizumab, 
cetuximab or a combination of bevacizumab and cetuximab.  
These studies are not discussed in this submission. because they are either not completed or not of 
relevance for the indication targeted in the current enlargement submission. 
2. 1.  Efficacy 
•  CA225025 (prior irinotecan, oxaliplatin, fluoropyrimidine: “last-line”) 
A Phase III Randomized Study of Cetuximab versus Best Supportive Care (BSC) in Patients with 
Pretreated Metastatic Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-Positive CRC – in 30 centres in 
Canada and 28 in centres in Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, initiated 28-Aug-2003, completed 
on 06-Mar-2006 
Methods 
This was a multicentre, open-label, randomized Phase 3 study. Subjects were randomized (1:1) to 
receive cetuximab+BSC or BSC. Stratification was by centre and performance status (PS). 
An initial dose of cetuximab 400 mg/m2 infused over 120 minutes was administered at Week 1. A 
maintenance dose of 250 mg/m2 was infused over 60 minutes each subsequent week. 
Response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed every 8 weeks and classified by the 
investigator using the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria.  
Survival (primary endpoint) was evaluated every 4 weeks post-progression. PFS was calculated from 
the day of randomization until the first observation of progression or death due to any cause.  
There were altogether 4 protocol amendments, none of them of relevance for the integrity of the study.  
Key inclusion Criteria 
Subjects who signed informed consent, had measurable or evaluable disease, and met all of the 
following disease criteria were eligible for the study: 
(cid:190) 
(cid:190) 
(cid:190) 
Histological proof of primary CRC that is metastatic 
EGFR expression of tumour tissue by immunohistochemistry 
Prior thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor (eg, 5-FU, capecitabine, 
raltitrexed, UFT) for adjuvant or metastatic disease

(cid:190) 
(cid:190) 
(cid:190) 
(cid:190) 
(cid:190) 
Received and failed irinotecan-containing regimen or have documented unsuitability for an 
irinotecan-containing regimen 
Received and failed an oxaliplatin-containing regimen or have documented unsuitability for an 
oxaliplatin-containing regimen 
The only remaining standard available therapy as recommended by the investigator is BSC 
ECOG PS of 0, 1, or 2 
Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal functions 
Randomization was performed centrally by the NCIC CTG (for the 30 Canadian sites) and by the 
AGITG (for the 28 Australian, New Zealand, and Singapore sites) using the NCIC’s randomization 
system. All sites in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore were considered one ‘site’ for the purpose 
of the randomization system. The randomization procedure dynamically minimized the imbalance 
between treatment groups within each stratification factor (centre and PS). 
The primary method used to compare OS between the 2 groups was a 2-sided log-rank test stratified 
by PS (ECOG 0-1 versus 2) at randomization. The HR of cetuximab+BSC over BSC and 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) were calculated based on a Coxregression model also stratified by PS (ECOG 
0-1 versus 2) at randomization.  
A stratified Cox regression model was fit to the data in order to assess the impact of treatment group 
on OS after adjusting for predefined prognostic factors at baseline (gender [male/female], age [< 
65/≥65], LDH [> UNL/≤UNL], alkaline phosphatase [> UNL/≤UNL], hemoglobin [CTC Grade 
≥1/CTC Grade 0], number of disease sites [> 2/≤2], number of previous chemotherapy drug classes [> 
2/≤2], primary tumour site [rectum only/colon], and presence of liver metastases [yes/no]).  
Analyses for PFS were similar to those for OS. 
Figure 1 : Patient enrolment into CA225025 
Major eligibility violations as defined by the NCIC were uncommon (0.7% across both groups). 
Major protocol deviations were based upon the following criteria: 
• Treatment with cetuximab after an episode of HSR > CTC Grade 2 
• Treatment with an other anti-cancer therapy while on study 
A total of 58 subjects (10.0%) met the criteria of major protocol violation, 13 (4.5%) in the cetuximab 
group and 45 (15.8%) in the BSC group.

Despite eligibility violations and protocol deviations, all subjects were included in all analyses. 
Previous CRC treatments were similar between groups with a total of 97.7% of subjects received prior 
oxaliplatin therapy and 96.2% received irinotecan therapy. All subjects received 5-FU or equivalent. 
Most (82.9%) subjects received 2 to 4 prior chemotherapy regimens regardless of line of therapy. Prior 
radiotherapy was received by 202 (35.3%) of the 572 randomized subjects; therapy was adjuvant in 
12.9%, palliative in 19.1%, and both in 3.3%.

•  Study CA225006 (prior oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine: “second line”, add-on to 
irinotecan) 
A Randomized, Open-Label, Multicenter Study of Irinotecan and Cetuximab vs. Irinotecan as Second-
Line Treatment in Patients with Metastatic, EGFR-Positive Colorectal Carcinoma in 221 study centres 
in 18 countries worldwide. Subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive cetuximab+irinotecan or 
irinotecan alone. Randomization was stratified by study site and ECOG performance status (PS) (0-1 
versus 2).  
The primary objective was to determine whether overall survival is prolonged in subjects treated with 
cetuximab in combination with irinotecan (cetuximab+irinotecan) compared with irinotecan alone as 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
second-line therapy following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin-based, non-irinotecan 
containing regimen.  
Key secondary objectives included comparison between treatment arms for progression-free survival 
(PFS), tumour response, quality of life (QOL), and assessment of safety. 
Key Inclusion Criteria 
(cid:190)  Histologically documented CRC that is metastatic 
(cid:190)  EGFR positivity of tumour tissue by immunohistochemical evidence of EGFR expression 
(cid:190)  Prior fluoropyrimidine-containing regimen (5-FU, capecitabine, or UFT), for firstline treatment of 
metastatic disease 
(cid:190)  Prior oxaliplatin administered for first-line treatment of mCRC 
(cid:190)  Failed an oxaliplatin regimen for metastatic disease. Failure was defined as either progression of 
disease (clinical or radiologic) within 6 months of the last dose of any agent of an oxaliplatin-
based regimen, or intolerance to an oxaliplatin regimen. Intolerance to an oxaliplatin regimen was 
defined as discontinuation due to any of the following: severe allergic reaction, persistent severe 
neurotoxicity, or delayed recovery from toxicity preventing retreatment. 
(cid:190)  Adequate recovery from recent surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy 
(cid:190)  ECOG PS of 0, 1, or 2 
An initial dose of cetuximab 400 mg/m2 infused over 120 minutes was administered at Week 1. A 
maintenance dose of 250 mg/m2 was infused over 60 minutes each subsequent week (licensed 
posology). 
The first dose of irinotecan was administered as a 90-minute infusion on Day 1. Subsequent doses 
were administered every 3 weeks at the same infusion rate. For subjects in the cetuximab+irinotecan 
arm, the irinotecan dose was given 60 minutes after completion of the cetuximab infusion. 
Irinotecan was administered at a dose of 350 mg/m2 for subjects < 70 years of age and 300 mg/m2 for 
subjects >70 years of age, or who had a PS score of 2, or had prior pelvic or abdominal irradiation. 
The primary analysis of survival was conducted by means of a two-sided, log-rank test stratified by PS 
(0-1 versus 2). Survival was also analyzed using estimates of confidence intervals for the hazard ratio 
and by Kaplan-Meier curves. Two different Cox models were employed to compute the hazard ratio, 
one in which treatment arm was the sole covariate and a second one in which the treatment effect was 
adjusted for age (< 65 years, = 65 years), number of involved disease sites (1, = 2) and liver 
metastases (yes, no). Both Cox models were stratified by level of PS at randomization (0-1, 2).  
The analyses of PFS and tumour response were based on the best response and date of progression 
provided by the investigator.  
There were altogether 8 protocol amendments, thereof 4 prior to the initiation of the study. Changes 
considered “major” are highlighted: 
Amendment 5 (5-Mar-2004) changed the starting dose for irinotecan in subjects older than 70 years, 
subjects who had received prior abdominal or pelvic radiationand subjects with a poor PS. 
Amendment 7 (02-Feb-2005) removed the requirement for an IRC to assess the tumour response and 
date of progression. 
Amendment 8 (02-Jun-2005) specified an interim analysis of survival on the first 800 randomized 
subjects followed for 6 weeks; and incorporated an early stopping rule into the protocol.

Altogether 47% of subjects in the irinotecan arm received cetuximab either alone or in combination 
with other agents as anticancer therapy during follow-up, potentially confounding the survival 
analysis. Different post hoc, exploratory analyses were conducted to address the confounding effect of 
additional post-protocol anticancer therapy during follow-up.

•  EMR 62 202-013 (first-line metastatic CRC as add-on to FOLFIRI) 
Randomized, open-label, multicenter, study comparing 5-FU/FA + irinotecan (FOLFIRI) + cetuximab 
compared to FOLFIRI alone in the first-line treatment of subjects with metastatic CRC having EGFR-
detectable tumours. Cetuximab was administered at 400 mg/m² for the first dose and 250 mg/m²/week 
for all subsequent doses.  
The FOLFIRI regimen comprised a 2-weekly regimen of irinotecan (180 mg/m² on day 1), 5-FU (400 
mg/m² bolus, followed by a 46-hour continuous infusion of 2400 mg/m² on day 1) and FA (400 mg/m² 
[racemic] or 200 mg/m² [L-form] on day 1). 
Treatment was continued until occurrence of PD or unacceptable toxicity. 
Tumour assessments were performed every 8 weeks. Tumour scans were evaluated by a blinded IRC.  
After the end of study treatment, information on further anticancer treatment and survival was 
collected every 3 months. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed safety 
after inclusion of 400 and all subjects. The sponsor was not privy to the information presented to the 
DSMB. QoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3.0) questionnaire at baseline and 
every 8 weeks after randomization. 
Primary endpoint: PFS 
Study subjects: 1198 subjects were randomized and treated (ITT population): 599 cetuximab + 
FOLFIRI and 599 FOLFIRI alone. Most subjects were from Western (44.7%) or Eastern Europe 
(34.0%). 
Randomization stratification factors: ECOG performance status (0–1 vs 2) and region (Western 
Europe, Eastern Europe, Other).

•  EMR 62 202-047(First-line metastatic, add-on to FOLFOX-4) 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  whether  the  rate  of  best  confirmed  response  was  superior  with 
infusional  5-FU/FA  plus  oxaliplatin  (FOLFOX-4)  plus  cetuximab  compared  to  FOLFOX-4  alone  in 
the first-line treatment of subjects with metastatic CRC having EGFR-detectable tumors. 
Cetuximab was administered at 400 mg/m² for the first dose and 250 mg/m²/week for all subsequent 
doses. The FOLFOX-4 regimen comprised a 2 weekly regimen of oxaliplatin (85 mg/m² on day 1), FA 
(200 mg/m² on days 1 and 2), and 5-FU (400 mg/m² bolus followed by a 22 h continuous infusion of 
600  mg/m²  on  days  1  and  2).  Treatment  was  continued  until  occurrence  of  PD  or  unacceptable 
toxicity.  Assessment  of  disease  was  performed  every  8  weeks.  Tumor  scans  were  evaluated  by  a 
blinded  Independent  Review  Committee  (IRC).  After  the  end  of  study  treatment,  information  on 
further anticancer treatment and survival was collected every 3 months. 
Inclusion criterion was the first occurrence of metastatic disease (not curatively resectable). 
Exclusion criteria were: Previous oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and previous chemotherapy for 
CRC except adjuvant treatment with PD documented >6 months after the end of adjuvant treatment. 
The study was stratified by  ECOG performance status 0 and 1 vs 2.

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Today  it  appears  clear  that  the  activity of  EGFR  targeting  compounds  in  the  treatment  of  CRC  to  a 
large extent is confined to patients with tumours expressing wild type KRAS,  a proto-oncogene with 
point  mutations  which  have  been  associated  to  various  cancers  (melanoma,  thyroid  carcinoma  acute 
myelogenous  and  lymphoblastic  leukaemia)  and  response  to  treatment.  With  respect  to  EGFR 
expression,  published  data  are  partly  conflicting  but  in  most  studies  no  relationship  has  been 
demonstrated  between  IHC  and/or  FISH  for  EGFR  expression  and  activity  of  EGFR  targeting 
compounds. In the submitted studies no relationship was demonstrated between activity of cetuximab 
and EGFR expression by IHC (percentage positive cells of intensity of staining). 
As  part  of  the  evaluation  of  this  variation  application  the  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  submit  any 
available FISH data for EGFR expression and to subgroup efficacy data per KRAS status.  
Based  on  the  overall  efficacy  data,  a  favourable  benefit  is  considered  proven  in  monotherapy  in  the 
“last line setting” (study CA225025). It could be argued that the percentage of patients with PS 2 is 
too  limited  (about  25%)  as  monotherapy  first  of  all is  reserved  for  patients  unlikely  to  benefit  from 
combination  therapy  irinotecan  +  cetuximab  (already  licensed  combination  as  “last-line”  therapy). 
Patients  included  in  study  CA225025  are  reasonably  representative  for  patients  likely  to  be  treated 
with cetuximab in monotherapy in clinical practice.  
Only  a  small  subset  of  patients  had  tumour  samples  where  KRAS  analyses  were  possible.  In  the 
KRAS  evaluable  population,  there  is  an  imbalance  with  respect  to  ECOG  PS  favouring  the 
experimental arm.  
Tumour  response  and  progression  were  assessed  by  the  investigator,  which  is  not  ideal  for  an  open 
label trial, but acceptable as survival was the primary endpoint. Survival data are considered mature 
(75 – 80% of events expected over long term) and robust. PFS data provide the support needed in the 
overall  assessment  of  efficacy.  The  PFS  curves  separate  first  around  the  median,  i.e.  data  are 
compatible with heterogeneity as regards the anti-tumour activity. Taking PFS data and panitumumab 
data  into  account,  it  is  found  fully  justified  to  conclude  that  benefit  is  restricted  to  patients  with 
tumours with wild type KRAS. As relevant benefit to the patient is considered established in the full 
study  population  it  is  also  concluded  that  this  is  the  case  in  the  wild  type  KRAS  population,  even 
though the small number of patients with tumours evaluable for KRAS status makes it hard to estimate 
the magnitude of patient benefit in terms of survival.   
The second line study (as add-on to irinotecan) study was conducted open label and tumour response 
and  progression  were  not  independently  adjudicated.  As  cross-over  to  cetuximab  became  possible 
during the study due to commercialisation of Erbitux, investigator bias in the assessment of PFS and 
response  rate  is  a  clear  possibility.  The  apparent  treatment  effect  in  terms  of  PFS  and  HR  is  0.7, 
corresponding to median difference of about 1½  months. Note that in contrast to studies  CA225025 
(last-line) and EMR 62 202-028, PFS curves appear to separate rather early.  
No effect was seen in terms of the primary endpoint, overall survival, HR 0.98. There is an obvious 
possibility that cross-over (too early in some cases) and other next line therapies confounded survival 
data as normally a PFS HR of 0.7 in CRC, second line  would be expected to translate to a survival 
benefit.  However,  PFS  data  were  not  independently  adjudicated  and  are  subject  to  possible  bias.  
Second-line  data  are  more  problematic.  Also  in  this  study,  only  a  minority  of  tumour  samples  were 
available  for  KRAS  analyses.  There  is  an  imbalance  with  respect  to  age  favouring  the  experimental 
arm  in  the  KRAS  evaluable  population.  Comparing  FAS  with  KRAS,  it  is  noticed  that  ECOG  PS 
tended to be poorer in the KRAS population, however, the difference is rather minor and probably not 
relevant.  
Efficacy  data  in  this  study  are  hard  to  interpret.  PFS  data  comparing  KRAS  wild  type  vs.  mutant 
behave as expected, but otherwise (tumour response, survival) results are inconsistent. Normally, the 
absence  of  activity  in  terms  of  improvement  in  PFS  in  the  KRAS  mutant  population  would  be 
regarded as indicating that there is no relevant bias in the assessment of PFS, but the number of KRAS 
evaluable  individuals  is  small,  especially  in  the  KRAS  mutant  group  of  patients  and  survival  data 
indicate  that  there  might  be  important  hidden  imbalances.  These  imbalances  would  normally  be 
expected to be reflected also in terms of PFS, i.e. a higher HR than 1 would be expected in the KRAS 
mutant population. Similarly, tumour response data are inconsistent. Altogether it is considered wise 
16 
 
to  view  data  as  inconclusive,  i.e.  that  a  PFS  bias  cannot  be  excluded.  There  are,  however,  no  good 
reasons  to  assume  that  cetuximab  would  be  inactive  as  add-on  to  irinotecan.  Actually,  it  has  been 
demonstrated previously that cetuximab as add-on reverses secondary resistance to irinotecan. Given 
the pharmacology of cetuximab, it is neither plausible that the fact that this second-line study recruited 
patients  after  failure  on  5FU  oxaliplatin  based  therapies  would  affect  the  activity  of  cetuximab. 
Altogether, this study should be viewed as a failed study, but the results should not negatively affect 
the overall conclusions drawn from the studies programme.  
First-line data in the overall population are compatible with a beneficial, but less robustly documented 
effect. In the “add-on to FOLFIRI” study the results are as expected. Activity is confined to wild type 
KRAS. The increase in response rate + 16%, an HR of 0.68 and a median PFS difference of about 2+ 
months is considered relevant. The increased percentage of patients undergoing surgery with curative 
intent provides supportive evidence of clinical relevance. Survival data are still immature and should 
be submitted as a FUM. In the small randomized study where Erbitux is add-on to FOLFOX, there is 
an apparent negative treatment effect in the KRAS mutant population. This is most likely due to 
baseline imbalances including better performance status in the control group. An HR of 0.6 and an 
increased response rate with 23% (absolute) is compatible with clinically relevant add-on activity.  
The assessment of efficacy, as based on data related to the activity in KRAS wild type patients, and an 
overall  assessment  taking  into  account  the  full  spectrum  of  studies  conducted  in  patients  with 
metastatic CRC give evidence of a positive risk –benefit ratio in the indication as specified in wild-
type KRAS patients.

Table 20: AEs with higher frequency in the cetuximab group vs control group of study 
CA225025, CA225006, or EMR 62 202-013 
“X” in the table above denotes that there was a higher frequency of the specified AE in the cetuximab 
group vs. the control group (difference between treatment groups: ≥10% subjects for CA225025; 
≥5% subjects for CA225006 and EMR 62 202-013). 
All of the AEs that were more common in the cetuximab groups than in the control groups of all 3 
randomized, controlled studies were known side effects of cetuximab (skin reactions, pyrexia, and 
stomatitis). 
Most of the AEs that were more common in the cetuximab groups of 2 studies were also known side 
effects of cetuximab (acne, conjunctivitis, dermatitis acneiform, exfoliative rash, mucosal 
inflammation, nail disorders, paronychia, and skin fissures). In addition, diarrhoea and fatigue were 
both more frequent in the cetuximab groups of studies CA225025 and CA225006. 
The following AEs that were more common in the cetuximab group of 1 study are also known to be 
associated with cetuximab: headache, various skin disorders, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia. 
Other AEs observed with a higher incidence in 1 study were abdominal pain, anorexia, asthenia, back 
pain, cough, epistaxis, infection without neutropenia, insomnia, neutropenia, “pain other”, palmar-
plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome, and weight decreased.

Special AE categories 
Acne-like rash and mucositis. Incidences and severities of acne-like rash and mucositis were in line 
with previous findings and consistent with the current product labeling. 
Infusion Related Reactions. Incidences of IRRs in the 2 MedDRA-coded studies were in line with 
previous findings.  Further analyses on first occurrence, intervention, outcome, and re-exposure were 
performed on cetuximab-treated subjects who experienced grade 3 or 4 IRRs (26/1238 [2.1%] subjects 
in studies CA225006 and EMR 62 202-013) or HSR/allergic reactions (13 [4.5%] subjects in study 
CA225025). Findings were as expected. 
In studies CA225006 and EMR 62 202-013, cetuximab therapy was discontinued permanently in 21 
subjects following a grade 3 or 4 IRR. Five subjects were re-exposed. One of these subjects 
experienced a second grade 3 IRR and was then permanently discontinued. The 4 remaining subjects 
continued cetuximab treatment without experiencing any subsequent IRRs. 
In study CA225025, 14 subjects experienced a grade 3 or 4 AE classified as HSR/allergic reaction. 
Cetuximab therapy was discontinued permanently in 2 subjects and treatment was continued in the 
remaining 12 subjects. Four of these subjects experienced a second HSR with a subsequent cetuximab 
infusion (1 grade 4, 3 grade 2) leading to permanent discontinuation of cetuximab treatment in 2 
subjects. 
Haemorrhage. The data from the 3 randomized, controlled studies indicate that cetuximab slightly 
increases the incidence of mild to moderate epistaxis which is a known symptom of mucositis. 
Cardiac events. Administration of cetuximab as a single agent with BSC in study CA225025 did not 
result in any medically relevant imbalances with respect to BSC in cardiac events.

Thromboembolic events: In study CA225025, the incidences of the NCI-CTC AE 
“thrombosis/embolism” were comparable in the cetuximab + BSC and BSC groups. 
Table 28: Number (%) of subjects with pulmonary embolism and thromboembolic events in 
studies CA225006 and EMR 62 202-013 
CVA / cerebral ischemia. There were no cases of CVA/cerebral ischemia in study CA225025. 
Overall incidences in the 2 other randomized, controlled studies were low with similar frequencies 
between treatment groups in study EMR 62 202-013 and a slightly higher incidence in the cetuximab 
+ irinotecan group of study CA225006.  
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eye disorders. The incidence of conjunctivitis with cetuximab as a single agent (3.8% in study 
CA225025) and in combination with irinotecan (7.7% in study CA225006) were close to the 
anticipated frequency of about 5% as described in the current product labeling. 
A slightly higher incidence of conjunctivitis was observed with cetuximab in combination with 
FOLFIRI (13.5% in study EMR 62 202-013). These data suggest that the incidence of conjunctivitis 
may increase with longer exposure of subjects to cetuximab.  
Time to event analysis of diarrhoea: The cumulative risk of developing diarrhoea under cetuximab + 
BSC in study CA225025 was significantly higher than under BSC (at 6 weeks 16.8 vs. 5.1%).  
In both studies in which cetuximab was given in combination with irinotecan-based regimens, results 
were in line with the hypothesis that cetuximab increased the risk of diarrhoea. However, results 
differed, with the highest risk for the 350 mg/m² irinotecan regimen every 3 weeks. In general, a 
plateau for the development of first-time diarrhoea grade ≥1 or grade ≥3 was reached within 3 to 6 
months. 
Laboratory findings 
•  Mild to moderate increases in liver enzymes (ALAT, ASAT and/or AP) are known to occur with 
cetuximab and were observed in all 3 randomized, controlled target indication studies.  
•  Decreases in the electrolytes magnesium, calcium, and potassium were also seen in all 3 studies. 
These decreases were very common and were generally of mild to moderate intensity. The most 
comprehensive data on serum magnesium are provided in study CA225025 which comprised 
routine serum magnesium measurements from the start of the study. In this study, serum 
magnesium decreases were observed in about 50% of subjects and were severe in 6% of 
subjects.  
Table 29: Number (%) subjects with grade 3 or 4 hypomagnesemia and any grade hypokalemia 
and /or hypocalcemia in studies CA225025 and CA225006 
•  A higher incidence of low serum albumin was observed in the cetuximab treatment groups in 
studies CA225006 and EMR 62 202-013. The relationship to cetuximab treatment is unclear. 
•  The frequency of low ANC grade 3 or 4 was higher in the cetuximab + irinotecan group 
compared to the irinotecan group in study CA225006 
Discussion on Clinical Safety:  
Cetuximab has a non-trivial safety profile including fatalities. Most reactions are related to the 
pharmacology of the compound and, e.g. the increased incidence of severe diarrhoea in irinotecan 
treated patients is a concern. The high incidence of IRR is also notable for this chimeric antibody.  
Infusion related reactions, sometimes severe, are problematic, but in essence there are no new 
findings.  
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On a qualitative level, reported events likely to be related to cetuximab therapy are in agreement with 
listed events in the SPC.   
The  incidence  and  pattern  of  Grade  3  and  4  AEs  differ  between  study  populations.  As  expected 
fatigue, dyspnea and pain are commonly observed in the BSC comparative study, but treatment with 
cetuximab appears to contribute.  
In the irinotecan add-on study, there is an increased incidence of febrile neutropenia, probably related 
to  an  increased  incidence  of  diarrhoea,  but  also  severe  neutropenia  seems  to  be  increased  in  the 
cetuximab arm. Whether this holds true also if only scheduled assessments of neutropenia are listed is 
unclear (non-trivial diarrhoea should trigger testing for neutropenia in clinical practice).  
Overall the adverse event pattern is what would be expected for cetuximab alone and in combination 
with chemotherapy. Comment: Except for rather few obvious cases, it is never easy to define whether 
the  cause  of  death  should  be  attributed  to  the  underlying  disease,  interaction  between  treatment  and 
disease,  or  therapy.  Data  are,  however,  compatible  with  an  increased  risk  for  death  in  patients 
administered cetuximab as add-on to chemotherapy. 
The increased incidence of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis is reflected in the SPC.

Overall Discussion and benefit- risk assessment 
This submission relies on four randomised trials, but the registration study for cetuximab (BOND) 
should also be taken into account in the overall assessment of the activity of cetuximab in patients 
with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (CRC). 
Extensive data now demonstrate that use of cetuximab should be restricted to patients with tumours 
not harbouring activating KRAS mutations.  
In the KRAS wild type population, clinically relevant add-on activity in terms of improved PFS has 
been demonstrated first-line and to the standard regimens FOLFIRI and FOLFOX4. The BOND study, 
comparing cetuximab + irinotecan with cetuximab alone in patients refractory to irinotecan, showed 
that cetuximab reversed secondary irinotecan resistance and it has now been demonstrated that 
cetuximab alone in this setting shows clinically relevant activity in terms of improved survival.  
The second-line study cetuximab + irinotecan vs. irinotecan alone is considered as a failed study due 
to inconsistent results. Given the totality of evidence there are no good reasons to put weight on these 
results in the overall assessment of cetuximab activity in the treatment of metastatic CRC.  
Survival data are yet not available for the first-line studies. Due to the availability of several active 
compounds, including commercialised cetuximab, for the treatment of CRC after first-line failure, a 
survival benefit is not expected to be possible to demonstrate. There are no signals and no 
pharmacological rationale to suspect that survival would be negatively affected by adding cetuximab 
to standard chemotherapy regimens. The CHMP therefore consider that it is acceptable to submit 
mature survival data as a follow-up measure. 
Whether the level of EGFR expression is of importance is currently unknown. Similarly it is unknown 
whether it is appropriate to continue cetuximab therapy in case of failure and to shift the cytotoxic 
backbone in patients suitable for further therapy.  
The toxicity of the add-on regimens is to a large extent determined by the cytotoxic backbone. For 
certain toxicities such as diarrhoea add-on toxicity is seen (irinotecan) and diarrhoea is indeed a 
clinically relevant adverse reaction, especially when associated with severe neutropenia. Similarly, 
skin reactions to 5FU administration are enhanced by cetuximab.  
Overall, however the toxicity profile of cetuximab, as discussed in the context of the extension, is in 
line with the already known adverse reaction profile, including skin-related reactions, pyrexia, 
stomatitis, headache, conjunctivitis, and hypomagnesaemia. 
In patients with metastatic CRC assumed to benefit from standard chemotherapy cetuximab as add on 
improves tumour control to a relevant degree and the add-on toxicity is manageable and considered 
acceptable. In patients not assumed to benefit from chemotherapy, cetuximab improves survival to a 
degree conventionally found relevant with adverse reactions found acceptable.  
Benefit – risk is thus found favourable for the proposed indications.

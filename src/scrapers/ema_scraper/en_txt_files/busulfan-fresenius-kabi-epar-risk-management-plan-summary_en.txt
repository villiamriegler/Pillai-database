Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan     
Summary of risk management plan for Busulfan 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Busulfan Kabi. The RMP details important 
risks  of  Busulfan  Kabi,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be 
obtained about Busulfan Kabi risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Busulfan Kabi SmPC and its PL give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients 
on how Busulfan Kabi should be used.  
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Busulfan Kabi is authorised for –  
Busulfan  followed  by  cyclophosphamide  (BuCy2)  is  indicated  as  conditioning  treatment  prior  to 
conventional  haematopoietic  progenitor  cell  transplantation  (HPCT)  in  adult  patients  when  the 
combination is considered the best available option. 
Busulfan following fludarabine (FB) is indicated as conditioning treatment prior to haematopoietic 
progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in adult patients who are candidates for a reduced-intensity 
conditioning (RIC) regimen. 
Busulfan followed by cyclophosphamide (BuCy4) or melphalan (BuMel) is indicated as conditioning 
treatment  prior  to  conventional  haematopoietic  progenitor  cell  transplantation  in  paediatric 
patients. 
It contains busulfan as the active substance. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Busulfan  Fresenius  Kabi  benefits  can  be  found  in 
Busilvex EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s. 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/busilvex 
II.  Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Busulfan Kabi, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Busulfan Kabi risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the  PL 
and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
• 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Busulfan Kabi is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Busulfan Kabi are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there  is sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Busulfan  Kabi.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for 
which  an  association  with  the  use  of  this medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is currently  missing  and  needs to  be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Routine  risk  minimisation  activities  recommending 
specific  clinical  measures  to  address  the  risk:  There  is 
limited  information  available  regarding  the  use  of 
busulfan in patients with kidney impairment, as studies 
have  not  been  conducted  in  this  group  of  patients.  As 
busulfan is only moderately excreted in the urine, dose 
 
 
modification  is  not  recommended  in  these  patients.

Routine  risk  minimisation  activities  recommending 
specific  clinical  measures to  address  the  risk:  Busulfan 
has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  liver  impairment 
so  there  is  limited  information  available  regarding  the 
use  of  busulfan  in  these  patients.  Since  busulfan  is 
mainly metabolised through the liver, caution should be 
exercised  when  busulfan  is  used  in  patients  with  pre-
existing impairment of liver function, especially in those 
with severe hepatic impairment. 
It  is  recommended  when  treating  these  patients  that 
liver  parameters  should  be  monitored  regularly  for  28 
days  following  transplant  for  early  detection  of  liver 
problems.

Routine  risk  minimisation  activities  recommending 
specific  clinical  measures  to  address  the  risk:  It  is 
unknown  whether  busulfan  and  DMA  are  excreted  in 
human milk. Because of the potential for tumorigenicity 
shown for busulfan in human and animal studies, breast 
 
 
 
feeding  should  be  discontinued  during  treatment  with 
busulfan.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
IMCIVREE is indicated for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with
genetically confirmed Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), loss-of-function biallelic pro-opiomelanocortin 
(POMC), including PCSK1, deficiency or biallelic leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency in adults and 
children 6 years of age and above.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
IMCIVREE should be prescribed and supervised by a physician with expertise in obesity with 
underlying genetic aetiology.
Posology
POMC, including PCSK1, deficiency and LEPR deficiency
Adult population and children more than 12 years of age
For adults and children 12 to 17 years of age, the starting dose is a 1 mg once daily subcutaneous
injection for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, if setmelanotide is well-tolerated (see section 4.4), the dose can
be increased to a 2 mg once daily subcutaneous injection (Table 1). If dose escalation is not tolerated,
patients may maintain administration of the 1 mg once daily dose.
If additional weight loss is desired in adult patients, the dose can be increased to a 2.5 mg once daily
subcutaneous injection. If the 2.5 mg once daily dose is well-tolerated, the dose can be increased to 
3 mg once daily (Table 1). 
2
In  patients aged 12 to 17 years, if weight remains above the 90th percentile with the 2 mg once daily 
subcutaneous injection and additional weight loss is desired, the dose may be increased to 2.5 mg with a 
maximum dose of 3 mg once daily (Table 1).

Paediatric population (children aged 6 to <12 years) 
For patients aged 6 to <12 years, the starting dose is a 0.5 mg once daily subcutaneous  injection for 
2 weeks. If tolerated after 2 weeks, the dose can be increased to 1 mg once daily. If dose escalation is 
not tolerated, paediatric patients may maintain administration of  the 0.5 mg once daily dose. If the 
1 mg dose is tolerated after 2 weeks, the dose can be increased to 2 mg once daily. If weight remains 
above the 90th percentile with the 2 mg once daily subcutaneous injection and additional weight loss is 
desired, the dose may be increased to 2.5 mg once daily  (Table 2).

The prescribing physician should periodically assess response to setmelanotide therapy. In growing 
children, the impact of weight loss on growth and maturation should be evaluated (see section 4.4). 
Weight loss and control of hunger associated with setmelanotide can be maintained as long as the 
therapy is continued uninterrupted. If treatment is discontinued, or if compliance to the dosing regimen 
is not maintained, symptoms of POMC and LEPR deficiency obesity will return. 
Bardet-Biedl Syndrome 
Adult population and children more than 16 years of age

Setmelanotide has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease.  Setmelanotide should not be 
administered to patients with end-stage renal disease (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Setmelanotide has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.   Setmelanotide should not be 
administered to patients with hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population (<6 years) 
The safety and efficacy of setmelanotide in children less than 6 years of age has not yet been 
established.  No data are available. 
Elderly 
Although no apparent age-related differences have been observed, data obtained from elderly patients 
is not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. There is no 
evidence indicating any special precautions are required for treating an elderly population (see 
section 5.2). 
Method of administration  
For subcutaneous use. 
Setmelanotide should be injected once daily, at the beginning of the day (to maximise hunger reduction 
during awake period), without regard to the timing of meals.  
Setmelanotide should be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, alternating the abdominal area each 
day.  
Prior to initiation of treatment, patients should be trained by their healthcare professional on proper 
injection technique, to reduce the risk of administration errors such as needle sticks and  incomplete 
dosing. Refer to the patient leaflet for complete administration instructions with  illustrations.  
Setmelanotide should be administered using the syringe volumes and needle sizes shown in Table 9.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Skin monitoring 
Setmelanotide may lead to generalised increased skin pigmentation and darkening of pre-existing nevi 
because of its pharmacologic effect (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Full body skin examinations should be 
conducted annually to monitor pre-existing and new skin pigmentary lesions before and during 
treatment with setmelanotide.  
Heart rate and blood pressure monitoring 
Heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored as part of standard clinical practice at each medical 
visit (at least every 6 months) for patients treated with setmelanotide. 
Prolonged penile erection 
Spontaneous penile erections have been  reported in clinical trials with setmelanotide (see section 4.8). 
Patients who have a penile erection lasting  longer than 4 hours should be instructed to seek emergency 
medical attention for potential treatment of priapism. 
Depression 
In clinical trials, depression has been reported in patients treated with setmelanotide (see section 4.8). 
Patients with depression should be monitored at each medical visit during treatment with IMCIVREE. 
Consideration should be  given to discontinuing IMCIVREE if patients experience suicidal thoughts or 
behaviours. 
Paediatric population 
The prescribing physician should periodically assess response to setmelanotide therapy. In growing 
children, the impact of weight loss on growth and maturation should be evaluated. The prescribing 
physician should monitor growth (height and weight) using age- and sex-appropriate growth curves. 
Excipients 
Benzyl alcohol 
This medicinal product contains 10 mg benzyl alcohol in each ml. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic 
reactions.  
Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding should be advised of the potential risk from the excipient 
benzyl alcohol, which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 
This medicinal product should be used with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, 
because of the potential risk from the excipient benzyl alcohol which might accumulate over time and 
cause metabolic acidosis (see also section 4.2).

Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free.” 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed.  
In vitro studies showed that setmelanotide has low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions related to 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) transporters and plasma protein binding. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy, and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of setmelanotide in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity.  However, 
administration of setmelanotide to pregnant rabbits resulted in decreased maternal food consumption 
leading to embryo-foetal effects (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, IMCIVREE should not be started during pregnancy or while attempting to 
get pregnant as weight loss during pregnancy may result in foetal harm.   
If a patient who is taking setmelanotide has reached a stable weight and becomes pregnant, 
consideration should be given to maintaining setmelanotide treatment as there was no proof of 
teratogenicity in the nonclinical data. If a patient who is taking setmelanotide and still losing weight 
gets pregnant, setmelanotide should either be discontinued, or the dose reduced while monitoring for 
the recommended weight gain during pregnancy. The treating physician should carefully monitor 
weight during pregnancy in a patient taking setmelanotide. 
Patients who are pregnant should be advised of the potential risk from the excipient benzyl alcohol (see 
section 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether setmelanotide is excreted in human milk. A nonclinical study showed that 
setmelanotide is excreted in the milk of nursing rats. No quantifiable setmelanotide concentrations 
were detected in plasma from nursing pups (see section 5.3). 
A risk to the newborn/infant cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breastfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from IMCIVREE therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the mother. 
Patients who are breastfeeding should be advised of the potential risk from the excipient benzyl alcohol 
(see section 4.4). 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of setmelanotide on fertility are available. Animal studies did not indicate 
harmful effects with respect to fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
IMCIVREE has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions occurred in 45% of patients treated with setmelanotide. The most common 
injection site reactions were injection site erythema (27%), injection site pruritus (21%), injection site 
induration (13%), and injection site pain (13%). These reactions were typically mild, of short duration, 
and did not progress or lead to discontinuation of therapy. Injection site reactions include injection 
site-associated events of erythema, pruritus, oedema, pain, induration, bruising, reaction, swelling, 
haemorrhage, hypersensitivity, haematoma, nodule, discolouration, erosion, inflammation, irritation, 
warmth, atrophy, discomfort, dryness, mass, hypertrophy, rash, scar, abscess and urticaria. 
Hyperpigmentation 
Skin darkening was observed in 56% of patients treated with setmelanotide. This generally occurred 
within 2 to 3 weeks of starting therapy, continued for the duration of treatment, and resolved upon 
discontinuation of treatment. This darkening of skin is mechanism based, resulting from stimulation of 
the  MC1 receptor. Hyperpigmentation disorders include skin hyperpigmentation, skin discolouration, 
ephelides, hair colour changes, lentigo, macule, nail discolouration, melanoderma, pigmentation 
disorder, skin hypopigmentation, solar lentigo, acanthosis nigricans, café au lait spots, melanocytic 
hyperplasia, melanocytic nevus, nail pigmentation, gingival discolouration, pigmentation lip, tongue 
discolouration, gingival hyperpigmentation, oral mucosa discolouration, and eye nevus. 
Gastrointestinal disturbance 
Nausea and vomiting were reported in 31% and 12% of patients, respectively, treated with 
setmelanotide. Nausea and vomiting generally occurred at initiation of therapy (within the first month), 
was mild and did not lead to discontinuation of therapy. These effects were transient and did not impact 
compliance with the recommended daily injections. 
Penile erections 
Spontaneous penile erection and erection increased were reported in 20% and 8% of male patients 
treated with setmelanotide, respectively; none of these patients reported prolonged erections (longer 
than 4 hours) requiring urgent medical evaluation (see section 4.4). This effect may be due to 
melanocortin 4 (MC4) receptor neural stimulation. 
Immunogenicity 
Due to the potentially immunogenic properties of medicinal products containing proteins or peptides, 
patients may develop antibodies following treatment with setmelanotide. There was no observation of 
a rapid decline in setmelanotide concentrations that would suggest the presence of anti-drug 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antibodies. In clinical trials (RM-493-012 and RM-493-015), the rate of adult and paediatric patients 
with POMC- or LEPR-deficiency who screened positive for antibody to setmelanotide was 68% (19 
out of 28), and 32 % screened negative. The 68% of patients who screened positive for antibodies to 
setmelanotide were inconclusive for antibodies to setmelanotide in the confirmatory assay. 
Approximately 13% of adult and paediatric patients with LEPR-deficiency (3 patients) confirmed 
positive for antibodies to alpha-MSH that were classified as low-titre and non-persistent. Of these 
3 patients (13%), 2 tested positive post-IMCIVREE treatment and 1 was positive pre-treatment. None 
of the patients with POMC-deficiency were confirmed to have antibodies to alpha-MSH. 
One paediatric patient with BBS aged ≥12 years confirmed positive to setmelanotide anti-drug 
antibodies with a very low titre. 
Paediatric population 
A total of 112 paediatric patients (n=26 aged 6 to <12 years, n=86 aged 12 to <18 years) have been 
exposed to setmelanotide, including 14 paediatric patients with POMC or LEPR deficiency obesity 
who participated in the pivotal clinical trials (n=6 aged 6 to <12 years, n=8 aged 12 to <18 years) and 
28 paediatric patients with BBS (n=8 aged 6 to <12 years, n=20 aged 12 to <18 years). The frequency, 
type and severity of adverse reactions were similar in the adult and paediatric populations. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The symptoms of setmelanotide overdose may include nausea and penile erection. In the event of 
overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient’s clinical signs 
and symptoms. In cases of overdose, blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored regularly over 
48 hours or as long as clinically relevant.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: not yet assigned, ATC code: A08AA12 
Mechanism of action 
Setmelanotide is a selective MC4 receptor agonist. MC4 receptors in the brain are involved in 
regulation of  hunger, satiety, and energy expenditure. In genetic forms of obesity associated with 
insufficient  activation of the MC4 receptor, setmelanotide is believed to re-establish MC4 receptor 
pathway activity to reduce hunger and promote weight loss through decreased caloric intake and 
increased energy expenditure.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Skin pigmentation 
Setmelanotide is a selective MC4 receptor agonist with less activity at the melanocortin 1 (MC1) 
receptor. The MC1 receptor is expressed on melanocytes, and activation of this receptor leads to 
accumulation of melanin and increased skin pigmentation independently of ultraviolet light (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.8).

Clinical efficacy and safety 
POMC, including PCSK1, deficiency and LEPR deficiency  
The safety and efficacy of setmelanotide for the treatment of POMC and LEPR deficiency obesity were 
established in 2 identically designed, 1-year open-label pivotal studies, each with a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled withdrawal period:  
• 
Study 1 (RM-493-012) enrolled patients aged 6 years and above with genetically confirmed 
POMC (including PCSK1) deficiency obesity. 
Study 2 (RM-493-015) enrolled patients aged 6 years and above with genetically confirmed 
LEPR deficiency obesity.  
• 
In both studies, adult patients had a body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m2. Weight in children was 
≥95th percentile using growth chart assessment. 
Dose titration occurred over a 2- to 12-week period, followed by a 10-week open-label treatment 
period. Patients who achieved at least a 5 kg weight loss (or at least 5% weight loss if baseline body 
weight was <100 kg) at the end of the open-label treatment period continued into a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, withdrawal period lasting 8 weeks (4-week placebo treatment and 4-week 
setmelanotide treatment).  Following the withdrawal sequence, patients re-initiated active treatment 
with setmelanotide at the therapeutic dose for up to 32 weeks. Twenty-one patients (10 in Study 1 and 
11 in Study 2) have been treated for at least 1 year and are included in the efficacy analyses. 
Additional supportive data were gathered in an investigator-led study and an ongoing extension study. 
Study 1 (RM-493-012) 
In Study 1, 80% of patients with POMC deficiency obesity met the primary endpoint, achieving a 
≥10% weight loss after 1 year of treatment with setmelanotide and 50% of patients with POMC 
deficiency obesity achieved a predefined clinically meaningful ≥25% improvement in hunger score 
from baseline at 1 year (Table 11). 
Statistically significant and clinically meaningful mean percent decreases from baseline for body weight 
of 25.6% were reported for Study 1. Changes in hunger were assessed using a patient and caregiver 
questionnaire completed daily for ‘most hunger over the last 24 hours’ at 1 year for patients ≥12 years 
of age. Statistically significant and  clinically meaningful mean percent decreases from baseline for 
hunger as a weekly average in the last 24 hours of 27.1% were reported for Study 1 (Table 12). 
When treatment with setmelanotide was withdrawn in patients who had lost weight during the 10-week 
open-label period, these patients gained weight (Figure 1) and the mean hunger scores increased over 
the 4 weeks of placebo treatment.

Study 3 (RM-493-023)
The safety and efficacy of IMCIVREE for the treatment of patients aged 6 years and older with 
obesity due to BBS were assessed in a 1-year clinical study with a 14-week placebo-controlled period 
(Study 3 [RM-493-023]). The study enrolled patients aged 6 years and above with obesity and BBS. 
Adult patients had a BMI of ≥30 kg/m2. Paediatric patients had a BMI ≥97th percentile for age and sex 
using growth chart assessments.
Eligible patients entered a 14-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period 
(Period 1) followed by a 38-week open-label treatment period (Period 2) in which all patients received 
setmelanotide. To maintain the blind through Period 2, dose titration to a fixed dose of 3 mg was done 
during the first 2 weeks of both Period 1 and Period 2. Thirty-two patients have been treated for at least 
1 year and are included in the efficacy analyses.
In Study 3, 35.7% of patients with BBS aged ≥12 years and 46.7% of patients with BBS aged 
≥18 years met the primary endpoint, achieving a ≥10% weight loss after 1 year of treatment with
setmelanotide (Table 15). The effect of IMCIVREE on body weight in patients assessed by the 
investigator as cognitively impaired was similar to patients who were not cognitively impaired.
In Study 3, ~52 weeks of treatment with setmelanotide resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in 
BMI Z-scores occurring in 100% of the BBS patients aged <12 years, with consistent results observed 
in patients ≥12 and <18 years of age. In patients aged <18 years, the mean reduction from baseline in 
BMI Z-score was 0.75 and the mean reduction from baseline in percent of the 95th percentile for BMI 
for age and sex was 17.3%.
Patients 12 years and older who were able to self-report their hunger, recorded their daily maximal 
hunger in a diary, which was then assessed by the Daily Hunger Questionnaire Item 2. Hunger was 
scored on an 11-point scale from 0 (“not hungry at all”) to 10 (“hungriest possible”). Statistically
15
 
 
 
 
significant and clinically meaningful mean percent decreases from baseline at 1 year for most/worst 
hunger of 30.5% were reported for Study 3 (Table 16).

Note: Baseline is the last assessment prior to initiation of setmelanotide in both studies.  
Note: The Daily Hunger Questionnaire is not administered to patients <12 years or to patients with cognitive impairment 
as assessed by the Investigator. 
Supportive of IMCIVREE’s effect on weight loss, there were general numeric improvements in 
cardiometabolic parameters, such as blood pressure, lipids, glycaemic parameters, and waist 
circumference. 
Paediatric population 
In clinical studies, 42 of the patients treated with setmelanotide were aged 6 to 17 years at  baseline 
(14 patients with POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency and 28 patients with BBS). Overall, efficacy and 
safety in these younger patients were similar to older patients studied.  Significant decreases in BMI 
were demonstrated. In patients who had not yet completed their growth, appropriate progression in 
pubertal development and increases in height were observed during the study  period. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
setmelanotide in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of appetite and general 
nutrition disorders (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The mean steady state setmelanotide Cmax,ss, AUCtau, and trough concentration for a 3 mg dose 
administered subcutaneously to otherwise healthy volunteers with obesity (N=6) once daily for 
12 weeks were 37.9 ng/mL, 495 h*ng/mL, and 6.77 ng/mL, respectively. Steady-state plasma 
concentrations of setmelanotide were achieved within 2 days with daily dosing of 1-3 mg 
setmelanotide. The accumulation of setmelanotide in the systemic circulation during once-daily dosing 
over 12 weeks was approximately 30%. Setmelanotide AUC and Cmax increased proportionally 
following multiple-dose subcutaneous administration in the proposed dose range (1-3 mg). 
A population PK model comprised of 120 subjects in 8 studies with otherwise healthy volunteers with 
obesity or patients with rare genetic diseases of obesity was conducted. The study population consisted 
of 51 males and 69 females with ages ranging from 10 to 65 years and weights ranging from 55.9 to 
209 kg. There were 4 children ages 10 to <12 years and 19 adolescents ages 12 to <17 years in the 
dataset. Studies enrolled 29 otherwise healthy volunteers with obesity and 91 patients with rare genetic 
diseases of obesity. 
Absorption 
After subcutaneous injection of setmelanotide, steady-state plasma concentrations of  setmelanotide 
increased slowly, reaching maximum concentrations at a median tmax of 8.0 hours after dosing. The 
absolute bioavailability following subcutaneous administration of setmelanotide has not been 
investigated in humans. Estimate of the inter-individual variability (CV%) from the population PK 
model was 28.7% (CL/F) and intraindividual variability was 27.6%. 
The PK of setmelanotide in patients with BBS was similar to that obtained in the population of 
patients with POMC, PCSK1, and LEPR deficiency, suggesting the disease state alone does not 
impact the PK of setmelanotide. 
Distribution 
The mean apparent volume of distribution of setmelanotide after subcutaneous administration of 
setmelanotide 3 mg once daily was estimated from the population PK model to be 48.7L. Setmelanotide 
binding to human plasma protein is 79.1%. 
In vitro experiments indicate that setmelanotide is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, 
OAT3, or OCT2. 
In vitro data indicate that setmelanotide is very unlikely a P-gp or BCRP substrate. 
Biotransformation 
Setmelanotide did not appear to be metabolised by rat, monkey, or human hepatic microsomes or 
hepatocytes, or kidney microsomes. 
Elimination 
The effective elimination half-life (t½) of setmelanotide was approximately 11 hours. The total 
apparent steady state clearance of setmelanotide following subcutaneous administration of 3 mg once 
daily was estimated from the population PK model to be 4.86 L/h. 
Approximately 39% of the administered setmelanotide dose was excreted unchanged in urine during 
the 24-hour dosing interval following subcutaneous administration of 3 mg once daily. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Setmelanotide AUC and Cmax increased approximately linearly with dose following multiple-dose 
subcutaneous administration in the proposed dose range (1-3 mg). 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
Setmelanotide has been evaluated in paediatric patients (aged 6 to 17 years). Simulations from the 
population PK analyses suggest slightly higher exposure in younger patients (who also have lower 
body weight) and provide support for the dosing regimen in patients 6 years and older. 
Elderly population 
Available data in a small sample of elderly patients suggest no marked changes in setmelanotide 
exposure with increased age. However, these data are too limited to draw definite conclusions. 
Renal impairment 
Pharmacokinetic analysis showed a 12%, 26%, and 49% lower clearance (CL/F) of setmelanotide in 
patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, as compared to patients with 
normal renal function.  
POMC, including PCSK1, deficiency and LEPR deficiency 
No dose adjustments for patients with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 
60-89 ml/min/1.73 m2) or moderate renal impairment (eGFR of 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m2) are needed. 
Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 
15-29 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.2). Setmelanotide should not be administered to patients with 
end-stage renal disease (eGFR <15 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.2). 
Bardet-Biedl Syndrome 
No dose adjustments for patients with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 
60-89 ml/min/1.73 m2) or moderate renal impairment (eGFR of 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m2) are needed. 
Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 
15-29 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.2). Setmelanotide should not be administered to patients with 
end-stage renal disease (eGFR <15 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Setmelanotide is stable in human, rat, and monkey hepatocytes; therefore, a study in patients with 
hepatic impairment was not conducted. IMCIVREE should not be used in patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
Body weight 
Setmelanotide CL/F varied with body weight according to a fixed allometric relationship. 
Gender 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of setmelanotide were observed based on 
sex. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, fertility, teratogenicity, or  postnatal development.  
A developmental reproduction study in rabbits revealed increases in embryo-foetal resorption and 
post-implantation loss in pregnant rabbits treated with setmelanotide.  These effects were attributed to 
extreme reductions in maternal food consumption related to the primary pharmacodynamic activity of 
setmelanotide.  Similar reductions in food consumption and related embryo-foetal loss were not 
observed in a developmental reproduction study in rats.  No teratogenic effects were observed in either 
species. 
Dose-related setmelanotide concentrations were observed in milk 2 hours after subcutaneous injection 
in the pre-weaning phase of a pre- and postnatal development study in rats.  No quantifiable 
setmelanotide concentrations were detected in plasma from nursing pups at any dose. 
In contrast to primates, variable cardiovascular effects, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, 
were observed in rats and minipigs. The reason underlying those species differences remains unclear. 
In rat, the dose-dependent effects of setmelanotide on heart rate and blood pressure were linked to an 
increase in sympathetic tone and they were found to progressively diminish upon repeated daily 
dosing. 
Minimal cytoplasmic vacuolation related to the excipient mPEG-DSPE was observed in the choroid 
plexus after chronic administration in adult rats and monkeys. Choroid plexus vacuolation was not 
observed in juvenile rats treated with setmelanotide/mPEG-DSPE from post-natal Days 7 to 55 at 
9.5-times the human dose of mPEG-DSPE from 3 mg of setmelanotide on a mg/m2/day basis. 
The available carcinogenicity data in Tg.rasH2 mice indicate that setmelanotide/mPEG-DSPE does 
not pose a carcinogenic risk to patients, with a safety margin of 17 for setmelanotide based on AUC 
and a dose margin of 16 for mPEG DSPE on a mg/m2/day basis, at the clinical dose of 3 mg/day. Due 
to the lack of pro-carcinogenic concern from the available non-clinical and clinical data on 
setmelanotide, a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats has not been performed.

1.
What IMCVIREE is and what it is used for
IMCIVREE contains the active substance setmelanotide. It is used in adults and children of 6 years and
above, to treat obesity caused by certain genetic conditions that affect how your brain controls feelings
of hunger.
The genetic conditions this medicine is used to treat are:
• Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS)
•
•
• LEPR (leptin receptor) deficiency obesity.
POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin) deficiency obesity
PCSK1 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1) deficiency obesity
People with these conditions lack certain natural substances involved in controlling appetite or these 
substances do not work properly. This increases hunger levels and leads to obesity. The medicine helps 
to restore control of appetite and reduces symptoms of the condition.
2.
What you need to know before you use IMCIVREE
Do not use IMCIVREE
-
if you are allergic to setmelanotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in
section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using IMCIVREE. 
Before you start and during treatment with this medicine your doctor should examine your skin for any 
markings or dark areas. Whilst you are using this medicine you may get more marks or dark patches on
30
your skin. A check before you start treatment will help you identify any new marks that appear once 
you have used this medicine. 
It is very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) for male patients to get spontaneous erections 
of the penis when using this medicine.  If an erection lasts more than 4  hours, please see a doctor 
urgently. Prolonged erections (priapism) can reduce your ability to get erections in the future if not 
treated. 
Children 
Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 6 years since there is no information on use in 
children below this age. 
Other medicines and IMCIVREE 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
It is not recommended to use IMCIVREE when pregnant or while trying to get pregnant, as it has not 
been studied in pregnant women.  Weight loss during pregnancy can harm the baby. 
Talk to your doctor before taking this medicine if you are breast-feeding. Your doctor will discuss with 
you the benefits and risks of taking IMCIVREE during this time. 
Driving and using machines 
This medicine should not have any effect on your ability to drive or use machines. 
IMCIVREE contains benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains 10 mg benzyl alcohol in each 1 ml which is equivalent to 1 mg for each mg of 
your dose. 
Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast‑feeding. This is because benzyl 
alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called “metabolic acidosis”). 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you have a liver or kidney disease. This is because benzyl 
alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called “metabolic acidosis”). 
IMCIVREE contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-
free”. 
3. 
How to use IMCIVREE 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
IMCIVREE is given as an injection under the skin, once a day, at the start of the day. The medicine is 
for long-term use. 
Your doctor will advise you on the right dose to inject.

How to inject IMCIVREE
IMCIVREE is injected into the fatty layer under the skin, in the stomach. Your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse will show you how to do this. Once you are comfortable injecting yourself or your child, you 
will be able to do this at home.
IMCIVREE should be injected at the start of your day to maximise hunger reduction when awake. 
IMCIVREE can be taken without regard to the timing of meals.
Before injecting IMCIVREE, please read the following instructions carefully.
Step 1. Prepare for the injection
-
Get the items you will need and place on a clean, flat surface.
You will need the following items that are supplied separately:
ALCOHOL WIPE
GAUZE PAD
-
-
Wash your hands with soap and warm water.
Open the 2 alcohol wipes and the gauze pad.
Step 2 Examine the vial
-
Check the expiry date on the vial label, this is shown after ‘EXP’: MM/YYYY.
34
-
-
The liquid should look clear to slightly yellow.
Do not use if:
-
-
-
-
-
the expiry date has passed
the liquid is cloudy
there are particles floating in the vial
the plastic cap on a new vial is broken or missing
the vial has been stored at temperatures greater than 30 °C.
Step 3. Prepare the vial
-
Before use, let the vial reach room temperature. This can be done by removing the vial from the
refrigerator 15 minutes before injection or by rolling the vial gently between the palms of your
hands for 60 seconds.
-
-
Do not use warm water, a microwave or other appliance to heat the vial
Do not shake the vial
-
If using a new vial, remove the plastic cap and throw it away in your household waste.
-
Clean the top of the grey vial stopper with an alcohol wipe. Throw away the used alcohol wipe in
your household waste.
-
Do not remove the vial stopper
35
Step 4. Prepare the syringe
-
For doses of 0.25 mg (0.025 ml or 2.5 units), use a 0.3 ml syringe with 0.5 (half) unit 
increments and a 29 to 31 gauge needle with a 6 to 13 mm needle length, suitable for injection 
under the skin.
0.25 mg dose = 0.025 mL or 2.5 units
-
-
-
-
For doses of 0.5 mg to 3 mg (0.05 ml to 0.3 ml), use a 1 ml syringe with 0.01 ml dosing 
increments and a 28 to 29 gauge needle with a 6 to 13 mm needle length, suitable for injection 
under the skin.
0.5 mg dose = 0.05 mL
1 mg dose = 0.1 mL
1 mg dose = 0.1 mL
2 mg dose = 0.2 mL
3 mg dose = 0.3 mL
Keep the protective needle cap on and pull back the plunger to fill the syringe with air equal to
the amount of the medicine to be used.
Remove the needle cap from the syringe. Pull the cap straight off and away from your body.
Place the vial upright on a flat surface. Hold the syringe and place it directly over the vial. Insert
the needle straight down into the centre of the grey vial stopper.
36
-
Push the plunger down to inject the air from the syringe into the vial.
- Without removing the needle, gently turn the vial upside down.
-
Make sure the tip of the needle is fully in the medicine liquid and not in the air above the
liquid
-
-
Slowly pull back the plunger to fill the syringe with the amount medicine needed for your dose.
When measuring your dose, be sure to read the units starting from the end closest to the black
rubber stopper.
Keep the needle in the vial and check for any large air bubbles in the syringe.
small 
air 
bubbles
large 
air 
bubbles
-
If you see air bubbles these will need to be removed from the syringe. To remove:
-
-
-
-
-
Gently tap the side of the syringe with your finger to move the air bubble to the top of the
syringe.
Empty the syringe back into the vial
Follow the above steps to fill your syringe again. Pull the plunger more slowly this time and
make sure the tip of the needle is always fully in the liquid in the vial to reduce the chance of
air bubbles.
Once there are no large air bubbles in the syringe, place the vial upright on a hard surface.
Hold the vial with one hand and the barrel of the syringe between the fingertips of your other
hand. Pull the needle straight up and out of the vial.
37
-
Place the syringe on the hard surface, make sure the needle does not touch the surface. Do not
recap the needle.
Step 5. Prepare the injection site
-
Choose the area on your stomach for the injection.
-
-
-
Change your injection site each day.
Make sure the injection site is at least 5 cm away from the belly button.
Do not inject an area that is red, swollen, or irritated.
5 cm
-
-
-
Clean your chosen injection site with your second alcohol wipe using a circular motion.
Allow the skin to dry for about 10 seconds.
Do not touch, fan, or blow on the cleaned area
Step 6. Injecting IMCIVREE
-
-
Place the syringe between your thumb and index finger of the hand you write with.
With your other hand, gently pinch about 5 cm of skin between your thumb and index finger.
Make sure you hold the skin fold until the injection is complete.
-
Hold the middle of the syringe at a 90º angle to your skin and push the needle straight into the
injection site, making sure the needle goes in all the way
38
-
Do not hold or push on the plunger while inserting the needle
-
Holding the barrel of the syringe between your thumb and middle finger, use your index finger to
slowly push the plunger to inject the medicine.
-
-
-
-
-
Count to 5 after injecting IMCIVREE to make sure all the medicine has left the syringe.
Let go of the pinched skin and pull the out the needle.
Use a gauze pad to gently apply pressure to the injection site, then throw gauze pad into your
household waste.
Place your used syringe in the sharps bin. Do not throw away in your household waste.
If you still have medicine left in your vial, place the vial back in the carton and store either in
your refrigerator or in a safe place at a temperature of less than 30 °C until it is time for your next
dose.
If you use more IMCIVREE than you should
If you or your child use more IMCIVREE than you should, contact your doctor.
If you forget to use IMCIVREE
If you forget to inject the medicine, skip the dose and inject your next dose at the usual time. Do not
use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop using IMCIVREE
If you stop using this medicine your hunger may return and your weight loss may stop.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The purpose of this variation is to propose an update of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
for Cervarix to allow for administration of the vaccine according to an alternative 2-dose schedule (0, 6 
months) in females aged 9-14 years old. 
The MAH has performed a first evaluation of the feasibility of a 2-dose schedule for Cervarix in the 
proof-of-concept study HPV-048. Immunogenicity results have shown that a 2-dose schedule of Cervarix 
administered at 0, 6 months in 9-14 years old females was non-inferior to the standard 3-dose schedule 
in females aged 15-25 years at all time-points evaluated up to Month 48. 
Since the conduct of new efficacy studies is not feasible in 9-14 years old girls for ethical and practical 
reasons, the MAH designed a pivotal phase III confirmatory immunobridging study (study HPV-070).  
In addition, these immunogenicity data were complemented by efficacy data in subjects receiving 
2-doses of Cervarix in 2 large phase III studies (studies HPV-008 and HPV-009). Effectiveness results 
(follow-up period of 4 years) on Cervarix obtained from the surveillance of HPV-specific infection after 
introduction of the National HPV Immunisation Program in the UK in girls aged 12-13 years as performed 
by the Health Protection Agency were part of the submission data package. 
2.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
2.2.1.1.  Pivotal study HPV-070 
Study HPV-070 is an ongoing phase IIIb, open-label, randomized, age-stratified, multi-centre trial 
(Canada, Germany, Italy, Taiwan and Thailand). The study design is shown in Figure 1.

Treatment groups: 3 parallel groups in 2 age strata (9-14 or 15-25 years of age) 
•  Group (0,6): females aged 9-14 years receiving 2 doses of Cervarix at Day 0 and at Month 6, 
respectively. 
•  Group (0,12): females 9-14 years receiving 2 doses of Cervarix at Day 0 and at Month 12, 
respectively. 
•  Group (0,1,6): females aged 15-25 years receiving 3 doses of Cervarix at Day 0, at Month 1 and at 
Month 6, respectively. 
To ensure equal distribution of the population, enrolment was stratified by age as follows: 
•  9-14 years: stratification into 9-11 years (~50%) and 12-14 years (~50%). 
•  15-25 years: stratification into 15-19 years (~50%) and 20-25 years (~50%). 
If non-inferiority of the 2-dose schedule (0, 6 months) versus the standard 3-dose schedule (0, 1, 6 
months) is not demonstrated 1 month after the last dose of study vaccine or at any further timepoint, a 
3rd vaccine dose will be offered to the subjects of Group (0,6) at the end of the study, according to local 
prescribing information. 
If non-inferiority of the 2-dose schedule (0, 12 months) versus the standard 3-dose schedule (0, 1, 6 
months) is not demonstrated 1 month after the last dose of study vaccine or at any further timepoint, a 
3rd vaccine dose will be offered to the subjects of Group (0, 12) at the end of the study, according to local 
prescribing information.

Study cohorts 
The primary analysis on immunogenicity was based on the according to protocol cohort (ATP) for analysis 
of immunogenicity. A second analysis based on the total vaccinated cohort (TVC) was performed to 
complement the ATP analysis.  
The ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects from the ATP cohort for 
safety: 
•  Who met all eligibility criteria 
•  Who complied with the procedures and intervals defined in the protocol 
•  Who were within the allowed interval as defined in the protocol 
•  Who did not meet any of the criteria for elimination from an ATP analysis during the study. 
•  Who did not present, during the study, with a condition that had the capability of altering their 
immune response (e.g. leukaemia or splenectomised child) or were confirmed to have an 
immunodeficiency condition (specific for Study HPV-070) 
• 
For whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were available. These included 
subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine 
antigen component after vaccination. 
The TVC-naïve included all vaccinated subjects (i.e., who received at least one dose) for whom data 
concerning efficacy endpoint measures were available and who had a normal cytology at Month 0. 
In addition, subjects were to be HPV DNA negative for all 14 oncogenic (high risk) HPV types (by PCR) at 
Month 0 and seronegative (by ELISA) at Month 0 for both anti-HPV- 16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies. 
For this cohort, the follow-up time for subjects started at the day after Dose 1. 
Statistical methods and sample size calculation 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that the immunogenicity (as determined by 
[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] ELISA) of HPV-16/18 vaccine administered according to a 2-dose 
schedule of 0,6 months in 9-14 year old females was non-inferior to that administered according to the 
standard 3-dose schedule of 0,1,6 months in 15-25 year old females, 1 month after the last dose of study 
vaccine.  
The following criteria for non-inferiority were assessed sequentially: 
− 
− 
Non-inferiority with respect to seroconversion was demonstrated if, 1 month after the last dose, 
for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18, the upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference (HPV 
[0,1,6] schedule minus HPV [0,6] schedule) was below 5%. 
Non-inferiority with respect to GMT was demonstrated if, 1 month after the last dose, for both 
anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18, the upper limit of 95% CI for the GMT ratio (HPV [0,1,6] schedule 
divided by HPV [0,6] schedule) was below 2.  
Sample size for the primary objective: 
The sample size of approximately 952 enrolled subjects (760 evaluable subjects) in HPV (0,6) schedule 
and HPV (0,1,6) schedule group was to rule out a difference of more than 5% in terms of seroconversion 
rates and more than two fold difference in terms of GMTs (HPV-16 and 18 ELISA titers) one month after 
last dose with 98% and 100% power, respectively (α = 0.025 for each HPV-16 and 18). 
Assessment report  
EMA/789820/2013  
Page 8/38 
 
 
 
 
The statistical test that was used to evaluate the difference in GMTs between the two groups was an 
ANOVA model on the log10 transformation of the titers. The ANOVA model includes the vaccine group as 
fixed effect.  
Within group assessment: PBNA (pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay) and ELISA. 
For each group at each time point for which a blood sample result was available, the following analyses 
were conducted: 
•  Seroconversion and seropositivity rates for each antigen (with exact 95% CI) per pre-vaccination 
status. 
•  GMTs with 95% CI and range of antibody titres were tabulated for antibodies for each antigen per 
pre-vaccination status. 
• 
The distribution of antibody titres for each antigen were displayed using reverse cumulative 
distribution curves for the sub-cohort of initially seronegative subjects. 
Between-group assessment: 
Between-group comparisons were performed in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity.  
Cellular mediated immunity 
CD4+/CD8+ T-cell response by ICS (Intracellular Cytokine Staining) 
This assay provides information on the frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells responding to the antigens 
(HPV-16 and HPV-18 and HPV-31 and HPV-45) and producing: 
at least CD40L and another cytokine (IFNγ, IL-2, TNFα) (d-CD40L); 
at least IL-2 and another cytokine (CD40L, TNFα, IFNγ) (d-IL-2); 
at least TNFα and another cytokine (CD40L, IL-2, IFNγ) (d-TNFα); 
at least IFNγ and another cytokine (IL-2, TNFα, CD40L) (d-IFNγ); 
at least two different cytokines (CD40L, IL-2, TNFα, IFNγ) (all doubles). 
The threshold for HPV-16/18/31/45-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses are presented in Table 4.

minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile, maximum and geometric mean (Gmean). Values of 0 were 
given an arbitrary value of 1 for the purpose of Gmean calculation. 
Primary objective 
The primary objective was to demonstrate that the immunogenicity (as determined by ELISA) of Cervarix 
administered according to a 2-dose schedule of 0,6 months in 9-14 year old females was non-inferior to 
that administered according to the standard 3-dose schedule of 0,1,6 months in 15-25 year old females, 
1 month after the last dose of study vaccine. 
Secondary objectives 
The secondary objectives of Study HPV-070 evaluated at Month 7, one month after the last dose in Group 
(0,6) and Group (0,1,6) were: 
• 
To demonstrate that the immunogenicity of Cervarix (as determined by ELISA if the primary objective 
is reached), administered according to a 2-dose schedule of 0 ,6 months in 9-14 year old females is

non-inferior to that administered according to the standard 3-dose schedule of 0,1,6 months in 15-25 
year old females, 6, 12, 18 and 30 months after the last dose of study vaccine. 
Criteria for non-inferiority 
• 
• 
To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the 0,12 months schedule in 9-14 years old girls versus the 
0,1,6 months schedule in 15-25 years old females  
To evaluate if the immunogenicity of Cervarix (as determined by ELISA) according to a 2-dose 
schedule of 0,12 months in 9-14 year old females is non-inferior to that administered according to a 
2-dose schedule of 0,6 months in 9-14 year old females, 1, 6 and 12 months after the last dose of 
study vaccine. 
The following criteria for non-inferiority will be assessed sequentially: 
Non-inferiority with respect to seroconversion will be shown if 1 month/ 6 months/ 12 months after the 
last dose for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 the upper limit of the 95% CI (confidence interval) for the 
difference (HPV [0,6] schedule minus HPV [0,12] schedule) is below 5%. 
Non-inferiority with respect to GMT will be shown if, 1 month/ 6 months/ 12 months after the last dose, 
for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18, the upper limit of 95% CI for the GMT ratio (HPV [0,6] schedule 
divided by HPV [0,12] schedule) is below 2. 
2.2.1.2.  Supportive study HPV-048 
Study HPV-048 is a phase I/II randomized, partially blind, multicentre, age-stratified, dose-range study 
to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an alternate dosing of the HPV-16/18 vaccine when 
administered according to a 2-dose schedule (0, 2 months or 0, 6 months) vs. the standard dosing 
schedule at 0, 1, 6 months up to Month 60. The study was conducted in 960 healthy females aged 9-25 
years in North America (Canada) and Europe (Germany). Subjects were allocated to 4 different treatment 
groups, receiving the HPV-16/18 vaccine at different dosages (20 μg or 40 μg of each HPV antigen), on 
different schedules (40 μg of each HPV antigen at 0, 2 months or 0, 6 months), or receiving the 
HPV-16/18 vaccine (20 μg of each HPV antigen) at 0, 1, 6 months. The study is ongoing and study results 
up to Month 48 were submitted. 
Primary immunogenicity objective To evaluate the immunogenicity of the HPV-16/18vaccine 
(hereafter referred to as HPV-16/18 vaccine) one month after the last dose when administered at 
different dosages (20 or 40 µg of each HPV antigen) and on different schedules (0,2- or 0,6-months) 
compared with the standard HPV-16/18 vaccine administered on a 3-dose schedule (0,1,6-months). 
Secondary Immunogenicity objectives 
The three following objectives were assessed sequentially: 
1.  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response to the 2-dose schedule of the HPV-16/18 
vaccine in the 9-14 year age stratum when administered at different dosages (20 or 40 μg of each 
HPV antigen) and on different schedules (0-2 and 0-6 months) as compared to the standard 3-dose 
schedule in subjects 15 - 25 years of age (the age group in which efficacy has been demonstrated), 
one month after the last dose of vaccine. 
Criterion: Non-inferiority was demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio between the standard 3-dose schedule of HPV-16/18 vaccine in 
subjects 15-25 years of age over the 2-dose schedules in the 9-14 year age stratum was below 2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/789820/2013  
Page 11/38 
 
 
 
 
2.  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response to the 2-dose schedule of the HPV-16/18 
vaccine in the 15-19 year age stratum when administered at different dosages (20 or 40 μg of each 
HPV antigen) and on different schedules (0,2- or 0,6- months) as compared to the standard 3-dose 
schedule in subjects 15-25 years of age, one month after the last dose of vaccine. 
Criterion: Non-inferiority was demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio between the 
standard 3-dose schedule of HPV-16/18 vaccine in subjects 15-25 years of age over the 2-dose schedules 
in the 15-19 year age stratum was below 2. 
3.  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response to the 2-dose schedule of the HPV-16/18 
vaccine in the 20-25 year age stratum when administered at different dosages (20 or 40 µg of each 
HPV antigen) and on different schedules (0,2- or 0,6- months) as compared to the standard 3-dose 
schedule in subjects 15-25 years of age, one month after the last dose of vaccine. 
Criterion: Non-inferiority was demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio between the 
standard 3-dose schedule of HPV-16/18 vaccine in subjects 15-25 years of age over the 2-dose schedules 
in the 20-25 year age stratum was below 2. 
If any of the above secondary objectives for immunogenicity were not demonstrated, the following 
objectives were to be evaluated: 
1.  To examine pair wise comparisons of the antibody response between each 2-dose schedule group and 
the standard 3-dose schedule, one month after the last dose of vaccine within each age stratum. 
2.  To evaluate the antibody response to all dose schedules and dosages of the HPV-16/18 vaccine in 
each age stratum during the extended follow-up period (at Month 12, Month 18, Month 24, Month 36, 
Month 48 and Month 60). 
2.2.1.3.  Supportive study HPV-008 
Study HPV-008 is a phase III, double-blind, randomised, and controlled multi-centre efficacy study in 
healthy females aged between 15 and 25 years. The study enrolled 18,729 healthy women 15-25 years 
of age in multiple regions of the world (North America, Latin America, Europe, Australia and Asia) and is 
completed and reported. Inclusion/exclusion criteria allowed the enrolment of a broad population of 
women, including women who were previously uninfected with HPV and women who were previously or 
currently infected with HPV, i.e., subjects enrolled in the study were vaccinated regardless of their 
baseline cytology and HPV serological and DNA status. A schematic of the study design is provided in 
Figure 2. The study had two parallel groups receiving either Cervarix or a Hepatitis A control vaccine 
(randomised according to a 1:1 ratio). Each subject was to receive three doses of vaccine or control 
according to a 0, 1, 6-month schedule.

The vaccine efficacy against incident infection and persistent infection (6-month definition) with 
HPV-16/18 in subjects who received only two doses of the study vaccine were evaluated as exploratory 
objectives. In this submission, the results in the Total Vaccinated cohort of HPV-naïve women, i.e., 
subjects who were DNA negative for all oncogenic HPV types, seronegative for HPV-16 and HPV-18 and 
normal cytology at baseline (TVC-naïve) at the end-of-study analysis (Month 48), are presented. This 
cohort is representative for the target population of this 2-dose schedule variation, i.e., girls aged 9-14 
years before their sexual debut. 
2.2.1.4.  Supportive study HPV-009 
Study HPV-009 was a phase III, double-blind, randomised, controlled study designed to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the HPV-16/18 vaccine in healthy women aged 18 to 25 years. 
This community-based study was conducted in a single centre with 7 satellite sites, all located in Costa 
Rica, Guanacaste Province and adjacent areas in collaboration with the US NCI. The MAH agreed to 
provide their HPV-16/18 vaccine under a clinical trial agreement (CTA) with NCI for the study and the NCI 
was responsible for the conduct of the trial. Subjects enrolled in the study were vaccinated regardless of 
their baseline cytology and HPV serological and DNA status. The population studied can be considered as 
representative of the sexually active female young adult population. A total of 24,467 women identified 
via a census were screened, of which 7,466 were enrolled and randomised (1:1) to one of the 2 parallel 
groups receiving either the HPV-16/18 vaccine (N=3,727) or a Hepatitis A control vaccine (same 
Havrix-based investigational formulation as in Study HPV-008; N=3,739). The median follow-up time at 
the end of Study HPV-009 was 4.2 years. 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the efficacy of Cervarix against CIN2+ associated 
with HPV-16 or HPV-18 post Dose 3 in subjects who were HPV DNA negative at Months 0 and 6 for the 
corresponding HPV type. No objectives were pre-specified for the endpoints that were evaluated in an

ancillary post-hoc analysis by the NCI. The objective of this proof-of-principle evaluation was to assess 
the efficacy of fewer than 3 doses of Cervarix administered in Study HPV-009. Vaccine efficacy was 
evaluated in each dosage group by determination, via HPV DNA testing, of the number of newly detected 
HPV-16 or HPV-18 infections that persisted in visits that were 10 or more months apart (12-month 
persistent infection definition) or 4 or more months apart (6-month persistent infection definition).

Immune response in 2-dose (0,6) group with flexibility around administration of the second dose 
According to the protocol-specified HPV-070 study design, some flexibility was allowed for the 
administration of the second dose of the vaccine. For Group (0,6), the maximum interval allowed for the 
administration of the second dose was [150-210] days after the first dose. In an additional post-hoc 
analysis, the anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibody response after the second dose as measured by 
ELISA was stratified according to the following intervals: [150-164], [165-194] and [195-210] days after 
the first dose. Seropositivity rates and GMTs for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibody titres as

In initially seronegative subjects, GMTs for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 neutralising antibodies were 
77625.4 ED50 and 23005.7 ED50 in Group (0,6) and 31206.4 ED50 and 13958.1 ED50 in Group (0,1,6), 
respectively, at Month 7. 
Anti-HPV-31 and anti-HPV-45 antibody response as measured by ELISA 
Anti-HPV-31 and anti-HPV-45 antibody response by ELISA were measured on a subset of ~100 subjects 
in each group. The subjects in this subset were the same subjects as in the sub-cohort for CMI testing. At 
Month 7, all initially seronegative subjects, except one subject in Group (0,1,6) seroconverted for 
anti-HPV-31 antibodies, respectively, and all subjects in both groups seroconverted for anti-HPV-45 
antibodies. 
In initially seronegative subjects, GMTs for anti-HPV-31 and anti-HPV-45 antibodies were 1680.9 EL.U/ml 
and 1798.0 EL.U/ml in Group (0,6) and 1224.9 EL.U/ml and 1073.0 EL.U/ml in Group (0,1,6), 
respectively, at Month 7. 
HPV-16/18/31/45 specific T-cell response 
In pre-selected sites, the first ~50 subjects in each age stratum (9-11 and 12-14 years and 15-19 and 
20-25 years) in each group were assigned to the CMI sub-cohort, in which the HPV-16/18/31/45 specific 
T-cell responses were assessed. 
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells specific to HPV-16 and HPV-18 (vaccine HPV types) and HPV- 31 and HPV-45 
(non-vaccine HPV types) were evaluated at baseline (Month 0) and at one month following the last dose 
of vaccine (Month 7) in Group (0,6) and Group (0,1,6) using a T-cell Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS).  
At one month after the last vaccination (Month 7), there was a substantial increase in median frequencies 
of HPV-16/18/31/45 specific CD4+ T-cells expressing two or more immune markers among the cytokines 
CD40L, IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ (all doubles) in both Group (0,6) and Group (0,1,6). No HPV-16/18/31/45 
specific CD8+ T-cell response was detected.  
HPV-16/18/31/45 specific T-cell response by pre-vaccination serostatus 
In Group (0,6), no clear trend was observed between initially seronegative and seropositive subjects in 
terms of median frequencies of HPV-16/18/31/45 specific CD4+ T-cells expressing two or more immune 
markers among the cytokines CD40L, IL-2,TNF-α, and IFN-γ (all doubles) at Month 7. In Group (0,1,6), 
median frequencies of HPV-16/18/31/45 specific CD4+ T-cells expressing two or more immune markers 
among the cytokines CD40L, IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ (all doubles) were higher in initially seronegative 
than in initially seropositive subjects at Month 7. 
HPV-16/18/31/45 specific memory B-cell response 
In pre-selected sites, the first ~50 subjects in each age stratum (9-11 and 12-14 years and 15-19 and 
20-25 years) in each group were assigned to the CMI sub-cohort, in which the HPV-16/18/31/45 specific 
memory B-cell responses were assessed. 
The HPV-16/18/31/45 specific memory B-cell responses were calculated as median frequency of 
HPV-16/18/31/45 specific memory B-cells at baseline and at Month 7. At one month after the last 
vaccination (Month 7), there was a substantial increase in median frequencies of HPV-16/18/31/45 
memory B-cells in both Group (0,6) and Group (0,1,6).

HPV-16/18/31/45 specific memory B-cell response by pre-vaccination status 
At pre-vaccination, median frequencies of HPV-16/18/31/45 specific memory B-cells were ≤ 1, except for 
HPV-16 specific memory B-cells in Group (0,1,6) and HPV-45 specific memory B-cells in both Group (0,6) 
and Group (0,1,6). 
In Group (0,6), median frequencies of HPV-16/18/31/45 specific memory B-cells were lower in initially 
seronegative than in initially seropositive subjects at Month 7. In Group (0,1,6), median frequencies of 
HPV-16/18/31/45 specific memory B-cells were higher in initially seronegative than in initially 
seropositive subjects at Month 7. 
2.2.2.2.  Supportive study HPV-048 
A total of 960 subjects were vaccinated in study HPV-048, i.e., 240 subjects in the 40/40 M0,2 group, 241 
subjects in the 40/40 M0,6 group, 240 subjects in the 20/20 M0,6 group and 239 subjects in the HPV 
group.  
Primary immunogenicity objective

The two-way ANOVA model that was applied using titers (log10) as response variable revealed that the 
group-by-age interaction was not statistically significant (p=0.195). The effect of group and age was 
significant (p<0.0001) (Table 12).

A two-way ANOVA has been used 
DF = degree of freedom, SS = sum of square, MS = mean square, F = Fisher-Snedecor, P = statistical probability. 
Pair wise comparisons were done between each 2-dose schedule group and the standard schedule using 
the Dunnett’s test. The standard schedule was to be considered superior to a 2-dose 
formulation/schedule if the lower limit of the 95%CI of the GMR was below 0.5 (2-fold difference). The 
standard HPV-16/18 vaccine was found superior to the 40/40 M0,2 but not to 40/40 M0,6 and 20/20 M0,6 
(Table 13).

Persistence of immune responses to 2 doses up to 48 Months after the first vaccination  
The persistence of antibodies against both HPV-16 and HPV-18 in the 40/40 M0,6 and 20/20 M0,6 vaccine 
groups followed a similar pattern as that observed in the standard HPV-16/18 vaccine group, i.e. after a 
peak response at Month 7, a gradual decline in antibody titres was observed until Month 24. Afterwards, 
GMTs reached a plateau between Month 24 and Month 48. In the 40/40 M0,2 group, GMTs had reached 
a peak response at Month 3 and evolved into a plateau from Month 18 up to Month 48. 
In the absence of a correlate of protection, the relevance of GMT levels for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 
antibodies at all time-points assessed during this study was evaluated considering the following two 
benchmarks: 
•  Antibody titres from subjects evaluated in study HPV-008 (aged 15-25 years at time of enrolment) 
who had acquired a natural infection and presumed to clear it prior to enrolment, i.e. subjects who 
were HPV DNA negative and seropositive at baseline. This is considered as the benchmark for the 
minimum level of antibodies that may be required for protection. Subjects who had cleared HPV-16 
infection had GMTs of 29.8 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 28.5-31.1] and subjects who had cleared HPV-18 
infection had GMTs of 22.7 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 21.7-23.7] in TVC (total vaccinated cohort). 
•  Antibody titres from subjects in study HPV-001/007 (aged 15-25 years at time of enrolment in 
HPV-001) at the plateau phase. The GMTs at the plateau level in study HPV-001/007 (Month 45-50 
time point in HPV-007) were 397.8 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 344.7-459.1] and 297.3 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 
258.2-342.2] for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies in the Total cohort, respectively. This 
second benchmark was defined based on the finding that the antibody levels reached at the Month 
45-50 plateau were associated with demonstrated protection against HPV-16 and HPV-18 infection 
and associated cytological and histopathological lesions. 
It is assumed that if a correlate of protection is identified, it will be between these two benchmarks. 
At Month 48 in initially seronegative subjects, GMTs for antibodies against HPV-16 were 21.6-, 43.5-, 
32.5- and 61.3-fold higher than those elicited by natural infection in study HPV-048 in the 40/40 M0,2, 
40/40 M0,6, 20/20 M0,6 and standard HPV-16/18 vaccine groups, respectively and GMTs for anti-HPV-18 
antibodies were 11.3-, 26.9-, 23.4- and 31.9-fold higher in the respective groups. When compared to the 
plateau level of study HPV-001/007 (Month 45-50), GMTs were 1.6- to 4.6-fold higher for anti-HPV-16 
antibodies. For anti-HPV-18 antibodies, GMTs were slightly below the plateau level in the 40/40 M0,2 
group (256.0 EL.U/mL) and 1.8- to 2.0-fold higher in the 40/40 M0,6, 20/20 M0,6 and standard 
HPV-16/18 vaccine groups. As observed at previous time points, the 40/40 M0,2 formulation and 
vaccination schedule appeared to result in lower anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibody titres at Month 48 
than the other formulations/schedules evaluated in this study.

The persistence of the antibody response in subjects aged 9-14 years in the 20/20 M0,6 group was 
consistent with that observed in subjects aged 15-25 years in the standard 3-dose HPV-16/18 vaccine 
group. GMTs for antibodies against HPV-16 were 44.2- and 47.6-fold higher than those elicited by natural 
infection in study HPV-008 in the 9-14 age stratum of the 20/20 M0,6 group and in subjects aged 15-25 
years in the HPV group, respectively. GMTs for anti- HPV-18 antibodies were 23.9- and 26.6-fold higher 
in the respective age ranges and vaccine groups. When compared to the plateau level of study 
HPV-001/007 (Month 45-50), GMTs were 3.3-and 3.6-fold higher for anti-HPV-16 antibodies and 1.8- and 
2.0-fold higher for anti-HPV-18 antibodies in the 9-14 age stratum of the 20/20 M0,6 group and in 
subjects aged 15-25 years in the HPV group, respectively.

Exploratory non-inferiority analysis of 2-doses in subjects 9-14 years vs. 3 doses in subjects 
15-25 years at Month 48 
At Month 48, the non-inferiority assessment for subjects aged 9-14 years receiving the HPV-16/18 
vaccine according to different 2 dose schedules and formulations vs. subjects aged 15-25 years receiving 
the standard 3-dose schedule of Cervarix as performed at Month 7 was repeated as an exploratory 
analysis, confirming previous results.  
Cross-reactive immune response to non-vaccine HPV types HPV-31 and HPV-45 
The responses to the non-vaccine types HPV-31 and HPV-45 across the 2-dose HPV-16/18 (20/20 M0,6) 
vaccine group aged 9-14 years and in the standard 3-dose HPV group aged 15-25 years appeared similar 
in terms of seroconversion and GMTs up to Month 48. 
At Month 48, the GMTs in initially seronegative subjects for anti-HPV-31 antibodies were 195.5 EL.U/mL 
in subjects aged 9-14 years in the 2-dose (20/20 M0,6) vaccine group and were 241.7 EL.U/mL in 
subjects aged 15-25 years in the standard 3-dose HPV vaccine group. The GMTs for anti-HPV-45 
antibodies were 156.6 EL.U/mL in subjects aged 9-14 years in the 2-dose (20/20 M0,6) vaccine group 
and were 147.2 EL.U/mL in subjects aged 15-25 years in the standard 3-dose HPV vaccine group. 
Statistical modelling up to Month 48 for predicting long-term persistence of HPV-16/18 
antibody response 
The statistical model was built using real life data from subjects aged 15-25 years who participated in 
study HPV-001/007 (the study was conducted in Brazil, Canada and United States). The study provided 
data with up to 6.4 years of follow-up after first vaccination. The model was applied on data from study 
HPV-048 at month 48 (78 subjects in the HPV-048 2-dose 20/20, M0,6 group in the 9-14 age stratum and 
157 subjects the HPV-048 standard 3-dose group in the 15-25 age stratum). The model estimated that 
vaccination of subjects aged 9-14 years with 2-dose of the vaccine would provide a similar duration of 
immune response to that of subjects aged 15-25 years vaccinated with the standard 3-dose schedule. 
To further substantiate the model, the MAH has plotted real life 9.4 years GMTs from study HPV-023 
(Brazilian cohort of the HPV-001/007 study where subjects were followed up with a mean of 8.9 years and 
a maximum of 9.4 years).  
For both HPV-16 and HPV-18, GMTs and the 95% confidence intervals observed in study HPV-023 fit well 
with the model. As observed in study HPV- 048, kinetics of the immune response with only 2-doses of the 
vaccine given at 0,6 month in subjects aged 9-14 years are similar to that of subjects aged 15-25 years 
receiving 3- doses of the vaccine (as in HPV-001/007/023).  
2.2.2.3.  Supportive study HPV-008 
The results presented are restricted to those from the analysis performed in initially HPV-naïve subjects 
(TVC-naïve).  
The majority (91.9%) of subjects received all 3 vaccine doses, only 5.2% (977 subjects) received 2 
doses.  
Due to either lack of follow-up information or unsuitability for inclusion in these exploratory efficacy 
analyses, only 258 subjects who received 2 doses could be evaluated for efficacy against incident 
infection and only 235 subjects for efficacy against 6-month persistent infection. At Month 48, vaccine

efficacy against HPV-16/18 incident infection was 84.5% [31.7, 98.3], and vaccine efficacy against 
6-month persistent infection was 100% [33.1, 100].  
2.2.2.4.  Supportive study HPV-009 
Of the 7,466 subjects included in the TVC, 313 subjects (155 in the HPV group and 158 in the HAV group) 
were excluded from the post-hoc analysis because they were HPV-16 and HPV-18 DNA positive at 
baseline or they had no post-vaccination visits. Of the 7,153 remaining subjects, 83.4% (82.7% HPV vs. 
84.1% HAV) of women received 3 vaccine doses, 11.2% (11.8% HPV vs. 10.6% HAV) women received 2 
doses, and 5.4% (5.5% HPV vs. 5.3% HAV) women received one dose 
Table 18 presents the vaccine efficacy against 12-month persistent infection with HPV-16/18 in subjects 
who received 3, 2 and 1 doses of the study vaccine in Study HPV-009.

HPV = HPV-16/18 vaccine; HAV = Hepatitis A vaccine 
* Human papillomavirus = HPV; 95% CI = 95% confidence interval. 
† The distribution of the time at diagnosis of the case patients in the HPV and control arms was qualitatively assessed 
to determine whether the protection afforded by two doses may be short lived compared with that of three doses. 
Twenty (80.0%) of 25 breakthrough 1-year persistent HPV infections in the vaccine arm were first detected in the first year of follow-up 
(suggesting missed prevalent infections at enrollment) compared with 40 (30.1%) of 133 infections detected in the control arm. Sixteen 
(64.0%) of 25 breakthrough infections occurred among women who were HPV16 seropositive at enrollment. 
‡ One of the three breakthrough infections was detected in each of the first 3 years of the study compared with 0%, 64.7%, 23.5%, and 
11.8% of the 17 infections in years 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the study, respectively. One (33.3%) of the three breakthrough infections occurred 
in a woman who was HPV16 seropositive at enrollment. 
§ No bootstrap confidence interval could be estimated due to the presence of zero events in the HPV arm after one dose of vaccine. 
In addition, vaccine efficacy was evaluated against 12-month persistent infection with HPV-31/33/45 
(combined endpoint), and although cross-protection was observed in subjects who received the standard 
3-dose regimen (VE=41.3% [18.9, 57.9], with 57 and 99 events in the HPV and HAV groups, 
respectively, there was no evidence of HPV-31/33/45 cross-protection in women who received only 2 
doses (VE=-25.9% [-334%, 61.1%], with 7 and 5 events in the HPV and HAV groups, respectively. The 
small number of total events (n=7) limited the ability to evaluate cross-protection against HPV-31/33/45 
among women who received only 1 dose. 
2.2.2.5.  Effectiveness results from Surveillance from the UK Health Protection Agency 
In September 2008, Cervarix was introduced into the routine immunisation schedule in England (and 
throughout the UK) and offered to girls aged 12-13 years. A catch-up programme also started in 2008 
with girls aged 17 years (born Sept 90-Aug 91) and was extended to all girls born since Sept 1991 in 
subsequent years. Opportunistic sources of residual vulvo-vaginal specimens are used to monitor the 
seroprevalence for vaccine induced antibodies and the prevalence of type-specific genital HPV infections 
among young women in England. 
Assessment report  
EMA/789820/2013  
Page 25/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Currently, the Phase 1 Report 1 is available, summarising the results on HPV type specific DNA prevalence 
in young women in the UK since HPV immunisation with Cervarix was introduced, based on data that were 
available up to the end of September 2012, i.e., after a follow-up period of 4 years. Phase 1 of the HPA 
surveillance study included 4 birth cohorts (born Sept 1995 to Aug 1999) from the routine immunisation 
and 5 birth cohorts (born Sept 1990 to Aug 1995) from the catch-up program. Coverage was around 80% 
in routine immunisation (86.8% in the 2011/2012 school year) and averaged 67% (40%-75%) for 1 or 
more dose across the catch-up cohorts. Note that HPA previously conducted surveillance for HPV 
type-specific DNA prevalence prior to introduction of HPV immunisation in 2008, which results are 
included in the HPA Phase 1 Report as reference. The results of this pre-immunisation surveillance have 
previously been published (Howell-Jones et al. Vaccine 2012; 30: 3867-3875). 
The mean age of the subjects included in the post-immunisation surveillance was 19.3±2.1 years 
compared to 19.2±2.4 years in the pre-immunisation survey. Reported data on sexual behaviour were 
similar between the two surveys with around a half of respondents to these questions reporting 2 or more 
sexual partners in the previous 12 months and at least one new sexual partner in the previous 3 months. 
The prevalence for HPV-16/18 infection in the pre-immunisation and post-immunisation surveillances by 
age (16-18 years, i.e., those with highest vaccination coverage [~65%] and youngest age at vaccination, 
19-21 years and 22-24 years) is presented in Figure 3.

2.2.3.  Discussion 
Pivotal study HPV-070 
The primary objective of non-inferiority in the pivotal study HPV-070 was met at Month 7 in the ATP 
cohort for immunogenicity, since at one month post the last vaccination (Month 7), all initially 
Assessment report  
EMA/789820/2013  
Page 26/38 
 
 
 
 
 
seronegative subjects in both Group (0,6) and Group (0,1,6) had seroconverted for anti-HPV-16 and 
anti-HPV-18 antibodies when measured by ELISA and PBNA (neutralizing antibodies). 
Similar immune responses in terms of GMTs for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies when measured 
by ELISA were observed in the [150-164], [165-194] and [195-210] days interval groups (overlapping 
95% CIs). Therefore, if flexibility in the vaccination schedule is necessary, the second dose can be 
administered between 5 and 7 months after the first dose. 
Additionally, one month post the last vaccination (at Month 7), all initially seronegative subjects in Group 
(0,6) had seroconverted for both anti-HPV-31 and anti-HPV-45 antibodies when measured by ELISA. In 
Group (0,1,6), all except one initially seronegative subject (98.9%) had seroconverted for anti-HPV-31 
antibodies and all initially seronegative subjects had seroconverted for anti-HPV-45 antibodies. At the 
same time point, a substantial increase in HPV-16/18/31/45-specific CD4+ T-cell responses and 
HPV-16/18/31/45-specific B-cell responses (in terms of median frequencies of HPV-16/18/31/45-specific 
B-cells per 106 B-cells) was observed in both Group (0,6) and Group (0,1,6). 
It was noted that in study HPV-070, Month 7, the subsample for detecting neutralizing antibodies against 
HPV-16/18 and ELISA antibodies against HPV-31/45 as well as for describing the cell-mediated immunity 
was not randomly selected, therefore during the procedure the MAH was requested to demonstrate that 
the subsample can be considered representative of the study population. The MAH investigated the 
difference in terms of immune response to the vaccine between subjects included in the subset and 
subjects not included in the subset. Based on descriptive statistics generated and reverse cumulative 
curves (RCCs) submitted, there was no evidence of a difference in the ELISA response following 
vaccination between the subset of subjects identified for further immune response evaluations and the 
rest of the studied population regardless of the group and the age strata. The CHMP considered that the 
titres of neutralizing antibodies against HPV-16 or HPV-18 in the subsample tested (not randomly 
selected) can be regarded as representative of the study population.  
Supportive study HPV-048 
One month after the last dose, the standard 3-dose schedule for subjects aged 15-25 years was not 
immunologically superior to the 2-dose schedule (2D) groups (20/20 M 0,6 group) for both HPV-16  and 
HPV-18 (lower limit of 95% CI GMR [2D/3D] >0.5). For both HPV-16 and HPV-18, the 2-dose schedules 
in girls aged 9-14 years were immunologically non-inferior to the 3-dose schedule in women aged 15-25 
years, i.e., the age group in which efficacy has been demonstrated one month after the last dose (upper 
limit of 95% CI for GMR [3D/2D] <2). 
These results indicate that the HPV-16/18 vaccine on a 2-dose M0,6 schedule is likely adequate for 
younger females aged 9-14 years. 
Supportive study HPV-008 
The efficacy against virological endpoints in initially HPV-naïve subjects who received 2 doses of vaccine 
in study HPV-008 as observed at Month 48 (end-of-study analysis) indicates that the HPV-16/18 vaccine 
also prevents HPV-16/18 infection in subjects who did not receive a complete 3-dose vaccination course. 
Supportive study HPV-009 
These results confirmed the data obtained with the other studies. However, the 2-dose regimen failed to 
demonstrate clinical cross-protection against persistent infection due to HPV-31/33/45 pooled in the 
post-hoc analysis. 
Supportive data from the Health Protection Agency in the United Kingdom (HPA HPV Report 
Phase 1, report 1)

The findings of the HPV surveillance in the UK demonstrate that Cervarix prevents successfully the 
transmission of HPV-16 and HPV-18.  
Concerning high risk types HPV-31, 33, 45 among girls 16-18 years of age (vaccine coverage, 65%), the 
prevalence was barely lower during the post-immunisation than during the pre-immunisation period 
(6.4% versus 8.6% respectively, HPA HPV Report Phase 1, report 1). The CHMP noted that in the 
post-hoc analysis of the Costa-Rica study (study HPV-009) (Kreimer A et al J Natl Cancer Inst 2011; 103: 
1444-51), no evidence of cross-protection against persistent infection (12 month definition) with 
HPV-31/33/45 (combined) among women who received two vaccine doses (VE - 25.9% [95% CI -334%; 
+ 61.1%]) was demonstrated, in contrast to women who received the standard three doses (VE 41.3% 
[95% CI 18.9%; 57.9%]. In addition, in the HPA HPV surveillance report from the UK (Phase 1, report 1 
dated 30 January 2013), the reduction of HPV-31/33/45 in the post-immunisation period (after the 
standard 3-dose schedule) was very poor or even not existent, in contrast to the strong effect against 
HPV-16 and HPV-18. The lack of clinical protection in the post-hoc analysis of the Costa Rica study may 
be due to the fact that the diagnostic tests used in the pre-immunisation period (2008) had a lower 
sensitivity than the tests used in the post-immunisation period (2012). The prevalence of grouped types 
(individual types other than HPV-16/18 were not assessed in the validation exercise) may be subject to 
measurement error. Another potential explanation is the phenomenon of unmasking (=diagnostic 
artefact making an assay unable to detect some types in lower concentrations when multiple types are 
present in the sample). Indeed, considering that Cervarix protects against HPV-16/18 infection, mixed 
infections in the post-vaccination period will be less frequent in vaccinated subjects in comparison with 
unvaccinated subjects. Unmasking will more frequently occur in the former group and lead to a higher 
detection of concomitant infections, resulting in decreased protection. 
Cervarix reduced the prevalence of non-vaccine types HPV-31, 33 and 45 in Scotland 1; however detailed 
information is currently not available. These data seem to disagree with the data included in the HPA 
Report Phase 1 (dated 30 January 2013), where no cross-protection was observed. The CHMP considered 
that it is too early to draw conclusions from the first HPA report as additional data are expected from the 
2nd HPA surveillance report due in March 2015.  
In order to provide a more complete view on the protection against these high risk HPV types after 2 
vaccine doses the MAH was requested to submit the cross-protection results for HPV-31/33/45 in study 
HPV-008 among subjects who received only two vaccine doses. 
The limited number of cases accrued with non-vaccine types HPV-31, HPV-33 and HPV-45 in subjects 
aged 15-25 years who received only 2 doses of the vaccine (with the less favourable 0,1 month schedule) 
did not allow drawing firm conclusions. Data from incident infection showed a vaccine efficacy of 83.0% 
(95% CI [23.8-98.2]) against HPV-31/33/45 and 100.0% (95% CI [13.5-100]) against HPV31, and a 
trend for a higher accrual of cases in the control groups for HPV-33 and HPV-45 in subjects who had 
received only two doses at the vaccine (0,1 month schedule). 
The clinical relevance of the statistical modelling in predicting antibody titres up to 20 years or beyond 
from the first vaccine dose remains unknown. However it was further substantiated with the plot of real 
life 9.4 years GMTs from study HPV-023 (Brazilian cohort of the HPV-001/007 study where subjects were 
followed up with a mean of 8.9 years and a maximum of 9.4 years). On the basis of the model there is no 
reason to believe that the simulation presented in the dossier under or over-estimates the immune 
responses elicited by 2 vaccine doses in 9-14 years old girls. The MAH committed to perform a new 
evaluation once the Month 60 data from study HPV-048 will be available. Additional modelling will be 
performed with data from study HPV-048 at Month 60 (5 years) and from study HPV-081 (up to 6.5 years

after initial vaccination, if sufficient data are available). These additional data will further document the 
value of the model with the 2-dose schedule. In addition, according to the robustness and validity of the 
modelling approach, the MAH was requested to propose feasibility options of an observational study to 
investigate waning of protection with the 2 dose schedule vs. the 3 dose schedule in girls aged 9 to 14 
years by June 2014. 
Furthermore, the MAH will extend study HPV-048 by another year for some study arms (HPV-081) to 
provide follow-up data up to 6.5 years after initial vaccination.  
The MAH submitted the ELISA results for HPV-33 obtained in study HPV-048. The HPV-33 ELISA was not 
routinely used in past studies. GMTs in the 2-dose schedule among subjects 9-14 years old and the 3 dose 
schedule among subjects 15-25 years old are very similar, although GMTs in the latter age group are 
slightly higher.  
The CHMP requested clarification for not studying the 0-6 month schedule in women 15 to 25 years old. 
The MAH provided data observed in early clinical trials in which the immunogenicity in young girls aged 
less than 15 years was twice as high as in women 15-25 years. GMTs for HPV-16 in subjects of the older 
age group who received the 2-dose schedule appeared to be lower than those observed in the younger 
age group with non-overlapping confidence intervals, while GMTs for HPV-18 appear to be similar 
between both groups. From these data, the feasibility of demonstrating non-inferiority of the immune 
response after 2-dose (0,6 month) vs. 3-dose (0,1,6 month) in subjects aged 15 -25 years appears 
unlikely. Therefore studies in this age group were not pursued.  
2.3.  Clinical Safety aspects 
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The safety analysis in studies HPV-070 and HPV-048 was performed on the TVC (primary analysis). The

During the 7-day post-vaccination period, solicited local symptoms were reported with similar incidence 
rates in both groups. Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom 
in both groups and was reported for 90.7% and 96.0% of subjects in Group (0,6) and Group (0,1,6), 
respectively, after 83.0% of doses in both groups. The incidence of Grade 3 solicited local symptom was 
low in both groups, i.e., in at most 9.1% of subjects after at most 5.2% of doses in Group (0,6) and in at 
most 11.0% of subjects after at most 4.7% of doses in Group (0,1,6). 
Solicited general symptoms 
The percentage of subjects reporting individual solicited general symptoms during the 7-day (Days 0-6) 
post-vaccination period after any vaccination is graphically presented in Figure 5.

During the 7-day post-vaccination period, the most common solicited general symptom was myalgia in 
Group (0, 6) and fatigue in Group (0,1,6). The most frequently reported solicited general symptoms (≥  
20% of subjects in any group, i.e., fatigue, myalgia, headache, gastro-intestinal disorders and arthralgia) 
were reported with a higher incidence rate (non-overlapping 95% CI, except for arthralgia) in Group 
(0,1,6) than in Group (0,6). Note that subjects in Group (0,1,6) are older and received one more dose of 
Cervarix.

The majority of the solicited general symptoms were considered potentially related to vaccination. The 
incidence Grade 3 solicited general symptoms was low in both groups, i.e., reported in at most 4.4% of 
subjects after at most 2.7% of doses in Group (0,6) and in at most 5.4% of subjects after at most 2.3% 
of doses in Group (0,1,6). 
Unsolicited adverse events 
During the 30 day post-vaccination follow-up period, the overall incidence of unsolicited AEs was higher 
(non-overlapping 95% CIs) in Group (0,1,6) than in Group (0,6), i.e., 34.2% of subjects after 14.6% of 
doses vs. 18.0% of subjects after 9.7% of doses, respectively. By Preferred Term, the most frequently 
reported unsolicited AEs (≥  2.0% of subjects in any group) were nasopharyngitis in Group (0,6) and 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, dysmenorrhoea, oropharyngeal pain and headache in 
Group (0,1,6). 
The incidence of Grade 3 unsolicited AEs was low in both groups, however, lower (non-overlapping 95% 
CIs) in Group (0,6) i.e., reported in 0.4% of subjects after 0.2% of doses than in Group (0,1,6), i.e., 
reported in 3.5% of subjects after 1.3% of doses. The incidence of unsolicited AEs considered by the 
investigator to have a possible causal relationship to vaccination was low, i.e., reported in 2.0% and 5.0% 
of subjects (overlapping 95% CIs) after 1.1% and 1.9% of doses in Group (0,6) and Group (0,1,6), 
respectively. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
No fatal SAEs were reported during the primary active epoch (Day 0 to Month 7) of Study HPV-070.  
During this period, 7 non-fatal SAEs were reported in 6 (1.1%) subjects in Group (0,6) and 12 non-fatal 
SAEs were reported for 11 (2.3%) subjects in Group (0,1,6). None of these SAEs were considered by the 
investigator to have a possible causal relationship to vaccination. 
Other significant adverse events 
Medically significant conditions (MSCs) 
During the primary active epoch (Day 0 to Month 7) of Study HPV-070, 107 MSCs were reported for 75 
(13.6%) subjects in Group (0,6) and 129 MSCs were reported for 96 (19.9%) subjects in Group (0,1,6). 
Except for bronchitis and cystitis, which were each reported in 5 (1.0%) subjects in Group (0,1,6), no 
MSCs occurred in more than 4 (<1%) subjects in any group. 
Potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) 
During the primary active epoch (Day 0 to Month 7) of Study HPV-070, 3 pIMDs (autoimmune thyroiditis, 
type 1 diabetes mellitus and Raynaud’s phenomenon) were reported for 2 (0.4%) subjects in Group (0,6) 
and 1 pIMD (VIIth nerve paralysis) was reported for 1 (0.2%) subject in Group (0,1,6). Autoimmune 
thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes mellitus reported in one subject of Group (0,6) were also reported as SAEs. 
VIIth nerve paralysis reported in one subject in Group (0,1,6) was considered by the investigator to have 
a possible causal relationship to vaccination. 
Pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes 
A total of 9 pregnancies were reported in Group (0,1,6) during the primary active epoch (Day 0 to Month 
7). Seven (77.8%) of these pregnancies were ongoing at the time of the Month 7 data lock point. One 
(11.1%) subject underwent an elective termination of the pregnancy and one (11.1%) subject had an 
ectopic pregnancy.

2.3.2.2.  Study HPV-048 
Solicited symptoms 
The incidence of individual solicited local and general symptoms (any and grade 3) in the 20/20 M0,6 
group and the HPV group receiving the vaccine according to the standard 0, 1, 6 month schedule was 
comparable and was similar to that observed in Group (0,6) and Group (0,1,6) in Study HPV-070.  
Unsolicited adverse events 
During the 30 day post-vaccination follow-up period, the overall incidence of unsolicited AEs was higher 
(non-overlapping 95% CIs in terms of proportion of subjects) in the group that received Cervarix 
according to the 0, 1, 6 schedule than in the 20/20 M0,6 group, i.e., 44.8% of subjects after 20.6% of 
doses vs. 31.7% of subjects after 19.3% of doses, respectively. By Preferred Term, the most frequently 
reported unsolicited AEs (≥  2.0% of subjects in any group) were nasopharyngitis, influenza like illness, 
urinary tract infection and headache in the 20/20 M0,6 group and nasopharyngitis, headache, 
pharyngolaryngeal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, injection site bruising and influenza like illness 
in the HPV group. 
The incidence of Grade 3 unsolicited AEs was similarly low in both groups, i.e., reported in 2.5% and 5.9% 
of subjects, after 1.3% and 2.1% of doses in the 20/20 M0,6 group and HPV group, respectively. Also the 
incidence of unsolicited AEs considered by the investigator to have a possible causal relationship to 
vaccination was similarly low, i.e., reported in 6.7% and 11.3% of subjects after 3.6% and 4.9% of doses 
in the 20/20 M0,6 group and the HPV group, respectively. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
During the entire follow-up period from Month 0 to Month 48, no fatal SAEs were reported. Subject no. 
258 in the 20/20 M0,6 group, underwent an elective pregnancy termination because of a congenital 
anomaly (spina bifida for the offspring resulting in a fatal outcome), which was considered by the 
investigator as not potentially related to vaccination. 
During the entire follow-up period from Month 0 to Month 48, 21 non-fatal SAEs were reported in 19 
(7.9%) subjects in the 20/20 M0,6 group and 19 non-fatal SAEs were reported for 13 (5.4%) subjects in 
the HPV group. In addition, one non-fatal SAE (foetal distress syndrome) was reported in a newborn 
infant of a study participant (Subject no. 99 in the 20/20 M0,6 group). None of these SAEs were 
considered as potentially related to vaccination according to the investigator.  
With the exception of appendicitis, which was reported in 4 (1.7%) subjects in the 20/20 M0,6 group (and 
1 [0.4%] subject in the HPV group), all individual SAEs by preferred term occurred in at most 2 subjects 
in either of both vaccine groups.  
Other significant adverse events 
Medically significant conditions (MSCs) 
During the entire follow-up period from Month 0 to Month 48, 152 MSCs were reported for 88 (36.7%) 
subjects in the 20/20 M0,6 group and 135 MSCs were reported for 82 (34.3%) subjects in the HPV group. 
Except for depression and abdominal pain, all individual MSCs by preferred term were reported for at 
most 5 subjects in either of both vaccine groups. Depression was reported in 8 (3.3%) and 5 (2.1%) 
Assessment report

subjects in the 20/20 M0,6 and HPV groups, respectively. Abdominal pain was reported in 2 (0.8%) and 
6 (2.5%) subjects in the 20/20 M0,6 and HPV groups, respectively 
New onset of chronic diseases (NOCDs) 
During the entire follow-up period from Month 0 to Month 48, 15 NOCDs were reported for 13 (5.4%) 
subjects in the 20/20 M0,6 group and 7 NOCDs were reported for 6 (2.5%) subjects in the HPV group. 
Except for hypothyroidism and dermatitis contact reported in 4 (1.7%) and 2 (0.8%) subjects in the 
20/20 M0,6 group, all individual NOCDs preferred terms were reported in at most one subject in either of 
both vaccine groups. 
New onset auto-immune diseases (NOADs) 
During the entire follow-up period from Month 0 to Month 48, 6 NOADs were reported for 5 (2.1%) 
subjects in the 20/20 M0,6 group and 4 NOADs were reported for 4 (1.7%) subjects in the HPV group. 
Except for hypothyroidism reported in 2 (0.8%) subjects in the 20/20 M0,6 group, all individual NOADs 
preferred terms were reported in at most one subject in either of both vaccine groups. 
Pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes 
24 pregnancies were reported in the 20/20 M0,6 group and 20 pregnancies in the HPV group. Most of the 
pregnancy outcomes in both groups were live infant with no apparent congenital anomaly, i.e., 15 
(62.5%) and 12 (60.0%) subjects in the 20/20 M0,6 group and HPV group, respectively. In addition, the 
following pregnancy outcomes were reported in the 20/20 M0,6 group and HPV group: 3 (12.5%) and 5 
(25.0%) cases of elective termination with no apparent congenital anomaly and 3 (12.5%) and 1 (5.0%) 
cases of spontaneous abortion with no apparent congenital anomaly, respectively. Finally, one subject in 
the 20/20 M0,6 group underwent an elective termination with congenital anomaly (spina bifida as child 
fatality). In each group, 2 pregnancies were still ongoing at the time of the Month 48 data lock point.  
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
The number and percentages of subjects outside the normal ranges for haematology and biochemistry at 
Month 7 were low and similar in both 20/20 M0,6 and the standard schedule group. There were no 
medically relevant alterations, especially no value corresponding to a grade 3 in toxicity according to the 
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) toxicity scale.  
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the safety aspects 
No new safety information was collected in studies HPV-070 and HPV-048, the occurrence of adverse 
reactions is in line with the current information in the SmPC.  
2.4.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to  which the Committee

The recommended vaccination consists of 3 separate 0.5 ml doses administered according to the 
schedule: 0, 1, 6 months.  
If flexibility in the vaccination schedule is necessary, the second dose can be administered between 
1 month and 2.5 months after the first dose and the third dose between 5 and 12 months after the 
first dose. 
If at any age the second vaccine dose is administered before the 5th month after the first dose, the 
third dose should always be administered. 
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Bridging the efficacy of Cervarix from young adult women to adolescents  
In a pooled analysis (HPV-029,-30 & -48), 99.7% and 100% of females aged 9 years seroconverted 
to HPV types 16 and 18, respectively after the third dose (at month 7) with GMTs at least 1.4-fold 
and 2.4-fold higher as compared to females aged 10-14 years and 15 to 25 years, respectively. 
In two clinical trials (HPV-012 & -013) performed in girls and adolescents aged 10 to 14 years, all 
subjects seroconverted to both HPV types 16 and 18 after the third dose (at month 7) with GMTs at 
least  2-fold  higher  as  compared  to  women  aged  15  to  25  years.On  the  basis  of  these 
immunogenicity data, the efficacy of Cervarix is inferred from 9 to 14 years of age. 
In ongoing clinical trials (HPV-070 and HPV-048) performed in girls aged 9 to 14 years receiving a 
2-dose schedule (0, 6 months) and young women aged 15-25 years receiving Cervarix according to 
the standard 0, 1,6 months schedule, all subjects seroconverted to both HPV types 16 and 18 after 
the second dose (at month 7). The immune response after 2 doses in females aged 9 to 14 years 
was non-inferior to the response after 3 doses in women aged 15 to 25 years. 
On the basis of these immunogenicity data, the efficacy of Cervarix is inferred from 9 to 14 years 
of age.

3.  How Cervarix is given  
How much the vaccine is given 
The doctor or nurse will give Cervarix as an injection into the muscle of the upper arm.  
How much is given 
Cervarix is intended for females from 9 years of age onwards. A total of three injections will be 
administered by your doctor or nurse according to the following schedule: 
First injection: at chosen date 
Second injection: 1 month after first injection 
Third injection: 6 months after first injection 
The total number of injections you will receive depends on your age at the time of the first injection:

EMA/789820/2013  
Page 35/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are between 9 and 14 years old, Cervarix can be administered by your doctor according to 
the following 2-dose schedule: 
First injection: at chosen date 
Second injection: 6 months after first injection 
If you are 15 years old or above, Cervarix can only be administered by your doctor according to the 
following 3-dose schedule: 
First injection: at chosen date 
Second injection: 1 month after first injection 
Third injection: 6 months after first injection 
If necessary, the vaccination schedule can be more flexible. Please speak to your doctor for more 
information. 
When Cervarix is given for the first dose, it is recommended that Cervarix (and not another vaccine 
against HPV) be given for the complete 3-dose vaccination course. 
Cervarix is not recommended for use in girls below 9 years of age. 
The vaccine should never be given into a vein. 
If you miss a dose 
It is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor or nurse regarding return visits. If you 
forget to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor for advice. 
If you do not finish the complete vaccination course (two or three injections depending on your age 
at  vaccination)of  three  injections,  you  may  not  get  the  best  response  and  protection  from  the 
vaccination. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The purpose of this variation is to update of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Cervarix 
with a reduced 2-dose schedule (0, 6 months) in females aged 9-14 years old. 
The acceptability of a 2-dose schedule for Cervarix was evaluated in the proof-of-concept study HPV-048. 
Immunogenicity results have shown that a 2-dose schedule of Cervarix administered at 0, 6 months in 
9-14 years old females was non-inferior to the standard 3-dose schedule in females aged 15-25 years at 
all time points tested up to Month 48. 
As new efficacy studies are not feasible in 9-14 years old girls for ethical and practical reasons, the MAH 
conducted study HPV-070, a phase III confirmatory immunobridging study. 
In addition, immunogenicity data from the pivotal phase III study were complemented by efficacy data in 
subjects receiving 2-doses of Cervarix in two large phase III studies (studies HPV-008 and HPV-009).  
Furthermore, effectiveness results for a follow-up period of 4 years on Cervarix obtained from the 
surveillance of HPV-specific infection after introduction of the National HPV Immunisation Program in the 
UK in girls aged 12-13 years were submitted as supportive evidence. 
The conclusions regarding similarity of the vaccine’s immunogenicity and safety when administered as a 
0, 6 months schedule to 9-14 years old girls in studies HPV-070 and HPV-48 vs. current 3-dose schedule 
were considered acceptable by the CHMP. The two-dose schedule using an interval of 5 to 7 months 
provides a suitable alternative to the three-dose schedule as it may improve the vaccine’s coverage.  
Assessment report  
EMA/789820/2013  
Page 36/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition to the data from studies HPV-070 and HPV-048, exploratory or post-hoc analyses of vaccine 
efficacy at Month 48 after the first vaccine dose among women aged 18-25 years who received only two 
doses in studies HPV-008 and HPV-009 demonstrate that two doses effectively protect against persistent 
infection due to HPV-16/18 combined (VE: 100 % [33.1%; 100] in study HPV-008 and 84.1% [50.2%; 
96.3%] in study HPV-009).  
Although there is no immunological correlate of protection, it is recognised (as demonstrated in animal 
models) that protection against oncogenic HPV infection in humans is mainly based on the presence of 
neutralizing antibodies as well as on cell-mediated immunity. Therefore as the immune responses are 
comparable between the reduced-dose schedule in the target population (9-14 years old girls) and the 
standard schedule in the population where clinical protection was demonstrated in previous clinical 
studies or in epidemiological surveillance, it is reasonable to conclude that Cervarix is expected to confer 
a clinical protection that is comparable with the standard schedule. 
Based on the available data, the CHMP endorsed the introduction of a 2-dose schedule (0, 6 months) in 
females aged 9-14 years old. The Risk/Benefit profile for Cervarix remains unchanged and favourable. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change(s):

opportunity to add Croatia to the list of representatives. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Update of sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Cervarix to include 
a reduced 2-dose schedule (0, 6 months) in females aged 9-14 years old. The MAH took the opportunity 
to add Croatia to the list of representatives. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
Summary 
Following the immunogenicity results in the proof-of-concept study HPV-048 showing that a 2-dose 
schedule of Cervarix administered at 0, 6 months in 9-14 years old females was non-inferior to the 
standard 3-dose schedule in females aged 15-25 years, the MAH conducted study HPV-070 as a phase III 
confirmatory immunobridging study. Efficacy data in subjects receiving 2-doses of Cervarix in 2 large 
phase III studies (studies HPV-008 and HPV-009) was provided as supportive evidence, along with data

obtained from the surveillance of HPV-specific infection after introduction of the National HPV 
Immunisation Program in the UK in girls aged 12-13 years. 
The overall immunogenicity and safety data provided demonstrate the non-inferiority of a 0, 6 months 
schedule in 9-14 years old girls vs. the standard 3-dose schedule. The 2-dose schedule using an interval 
of 5 to 7 months provides a suitable alternative to the 3-dose schedule as it may improve the vaccine’s 
coverage.

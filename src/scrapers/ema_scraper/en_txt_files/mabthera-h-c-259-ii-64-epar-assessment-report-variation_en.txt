1. 
Introduction 
Mabthera  contains  the  active  substance  rituximab  which  is  a  chimeric  murine/human  monoclonal 
antibody that binds CD20. CD20 is a hydrophobic transmembrane protein which is present on the cell 
surface  of  pre-B-  and  mature  B-lymphocytes.  In  contrast  the  protein  is  considered  absent  on 
hematopoietic stem cells, pro–B–cells, normal plasma cells as well as other tissues. 
CD20  is  also  present  on  malignant  B-cells  in  most  patients  with  mature  B-cell  lymphoma  or  B-cell 
leukemia.  The  binding  of  rituximab  to  CD20  on  lymphocytes  could  lead  to  the  elimination  of  these 
cells by means of several different mechanisms. The mechanisms include antibody dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and apoptosis. 
Mabthera was first authorised in 1998 in the European Union (EU/1/98/0067/002) and currently it is 
approved in the EU for the following indications: 
•  The  treatment  of  previously  untreated  patients  with  stage  III-IV  follicular  lymphoma  in 
combination with chemotherapy. 
•  The maintenance therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma responding 
to induction therapy with chemotherapy with or without MabThera. 
•  The  treatment  in  monotherapy  of  patients  with  stage  III-IV  follicular  lymphoma  who  are 
chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy.  
•  The treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 
combination  with  CHOP  (cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin,  vincristine,  prednisolone) 
chemotherapy.  
•  MabThera  in  combination  with  methotrexate  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients 
with severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to 
other  disease-modifying  anti-rheumatic  drugs  (DMARD)  including  one  or  more  tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapies. 
In 2008 the CHMP adopted a positive opinion on the indication for treatment of chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL): 
• 
“MabThera is indicated for first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(CLL) in combination with chemotherapy.” 
With  the  current  procedure  the  MAH  applies  for  extension  of  this  indication  in  CLL  via  a  type  2 
variation.  The  proposed  indication  for  CLL  is  “MabThera  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  is 
indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  previously  untreated  and  relapsed/refractory  chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia.”

Clinical aspects 
2. 1  Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In  study  BO17072,  in  a  subset  of  patients,  pharmacokinetics  of  rituximab,  fludarabine  and 
cyclophosphamide  was  determined.  It  appears  that  there  is  no  apparent  effect  of  fludarabine  and 
cyclophosphamide  on  the  PK  of  rituximab  and  co-administration  with  rituximab  did  not  appear  to 
affect the PK of fludarabine or cyclophosphamide in CLL patients. However, it should be taken into 
account  that  for  cyclophosphamide  a  high  variability  is  observed  in  the  pharmacokinetics  which 
hampers a straight forward conclusion.

2. 2. 
Clinical studies 
As stated the proposed indication for Mabthera is supported by the single pivotal study BO17072 and 
further by 8 additional phase II studies in which rituximab is combined with other chemotherapeutics.

Pivotal study (BO17072) 
Methodology 
Study BO17072 was an open-label, multicenter, 2 arm, 1:1 randomized, parallel group comparative, 
phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab plus fludarabine and cyclophosphamide 
(R-FC) versus fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone (FC) in previously treated patients with CD20 
positive  relapsed  B-cell  chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia  (CLL).  The  choice  of  FC  regimen  as 
comparator is acceptable. 
A  pre-planned  interim  efficacy  analysis  of  study  BO17072  was  performed  with  a  clinical  cut-off  of 
June 26, 2007, after two-thirds (190/284 planned, 205 actual) of the events (progression or deaths) had 
been reported. But because the Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessed PFS did not cross the 
pre-specified  threshold  at  that  time  (actual  result:  p=0.012)  and  because  all  patients  had  completed 
therapy,  the  DSMB  recommended  that  the  study  should  be  continued  until  the  final  analysis.  As  a 
consequence, only results from the final analysis (data cut-off July 23 2008) are submitted.  
The  study  was  performed  in  88  centers  in  17  countries.  The  study  design  and  the  choice  of  dose 
chosen for study BO17072 was similar with regards to treatment regimens, response assessments and 
inclusion/exclusion  criteria  to  the  large,  randomized  phase  III  study  in  817  patients  with  previously 
untreated CLL (ML17102) submitted to support the first line indication. 
Patients were planned to receive 6 treatment cycles of FC chemotherapy (fludarabine [25 mg/m2] and 
cyclophosphamide [250 mg/m2] i.v. on days 1, 2 and 3 of each cycle) q28d.  Patients randomized to 
the  R-FC  arm  received  FC  in  combination  with  rituximab  (375 mg/m2  i.v.  on  day 0  of  cycle  1, 
500 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 of cycles 2-6).

Endpoints 
Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). PFS is an acceptable primary endpoint in any 
CLL  trial  mainly  because  survival  benefit  is  rarely  observed  in  comparative  clinical  trials  in  this 
elderly  population  with  a  relatively  indolent  disease.  Moreover,  reduction  in  tumour  burden  often 
implies less constitutional symptoms and improvement in haemoglobin concentration, neutrophil and 
platelet counts.  
Secondary  endpoints  were  event  free  survival  (EFS),  disease  free  survival  (DFS)  in  CR  patients, 
duration of response (DR), overall response rate (CR, nPR, PR), overall survival (OS), proportion of 
patients with molecular remission. All secondary endpoints are conventional. 
Statistical analysis 
For  the  efficacy  assessment  a  2-sided,  non-stratified  Log-Rank  test,  Kaplan  Meier  curves,  Cox 
regression  analyses  (adjusted  and  non-adjusted)  were  performed  applying  the  Wald  test.  Response 
rates  were  compared  using  the  Chi-squared  test  with  95%  confidence  limits  according  to 
Pearson-Clopper. 
Main characteristics of supportive studies  
To  support  the  results  of  the  pivotal  trial,  8  phase  II  trials  in  relapsed/refractory  patients  with  CLL 
were  submitted.  Overall,  a  total  of  741  patients  received  rituximab  in  these  studies.  Approximately 
460 patients  were  treated  with  rituximab  in  combination  with  various  types  chemotherapy  i.e  
pentostatine, cladribine, fludarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide or bendamustine.  
Since  the  proposed  indication  does  not  restrict  combination  chemotherapy  to  fludarabine  and 
cyclophosphamide the studies can be considered as supportive in addition to BO17072.

2. 3. 
Results from Pivotal study (BO17072) 
A total of 552 patients were enrolled and randomized (276 patients per arm). Six of these patients (4 
patients FC, 2 patients R-FC) did not receive any study treatment. These patients were included in the 
intent-to-treat (ITT) population, but excluded from the safety analysis population (SAP). 
Baseline characteristics. 
Both  treatment  arms  were  well  balanced  with  respect  to  disease  stage  and  Eastern  Cooperative 
Oncology  Group  (ECOG)  status.  At  pre-therapeutic  staging,  60%  of  patients  had  an  ECOG 
performance  status  of  0,  and  40%  of  patients  had  an  ECOG  performance  status  of 1.  Slightly  more 
patients in the FC arm than in the R-FC arm had B-symptoms at baseline (31% FC versus 26% R-FC). 
The median time from first diagnosis was nearly 4 years. Time from diagnosis was similar in the two 
treatment  arms;  FC  median  3.7  years  (range  0.1-23.4  years)  and  R-FC  median  3.8  years  (range 
0.1-25.2 years).  
Baseline  hematology  values  were  balanced  between  both  treatment  arms.  Standard  laboratory  tests 
other than hematology parameters (β2-microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] and Coombs test) 
were balanced between the treatment arms at baseline. 
The distribution of prognostic parameters and also cytogentic abnormalities was relatively balanced 
across the treatment arms.  
In relation to characteristics regarding prior treatment it is not fully clear to what extent patients that 
were initially treated with fludarabine-based combination therapy (eg. FCR or FR) were to respond to 
re-treatment with these agents after relapse, retreatment appears a reasonable option.  17% of patients 
received prior fludarabine. Refractoriness to prior fludarabine may be of influence.  
Patients’ exposure to treatment 
A total of 552 patients were enrolled and randomized in the study during July 2003-Augsut 2007. 
Overall, the numbers of patients that withdrew from study treatment due to PD or patient refusal are 
relatively low (FC arm:38.6%, R-FC: arm 32.5%).  
Efficacy Results 
Primary endpoint progression free survival (PFS) 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on a non-stratified, two-sided Log-Rank test of investigator 
assessed  PFS.  Progression-free  survival  was  determined  for  the  ITT  population.  At  the  time  of  the 
analysis  (July  23,  2008),  approximately  9%  more  patients  in  the  FC  arm  than  in  the  R-FC  arm  had 
experienced an event (progression or death; 158 patients [57%] on FC versus 132 patients [48%] on R-
FC). More patients in the FC arm than in the R-FC arm had a progression as a first PFS event (48% 
FC versus 37% R-FC), whereas slightly more patients in the rituximab containing arm had died (9% 
FC versus 11% R-FC). 
The addition of rituximab to the FC regimen significantly prolonged the median PFS when compared 
to  the  FC  regimen  alone  (p=0.0002,  Log-Rank  test).  The  Kaplan-Meier  estimated  median  PFS  was 
20.6 months  (627 days)  with  FC  and  30.6 months  (932 days)  with  R-FC  (see  figure  1).  The  risk  of 
having  a  PFS  event  (progression  or  death,  whichever  occurred  first)  was  statistically  significantly 
decreased by 35%: unadjusted HR = 0.65 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.82, p=0002, Wald test) for patients in the 
rituximab arm compared to the FC arm. 44% of the patients in the FC arm, and 60% of those in the R-
FC arm, were progression-free at two years according to Kaplan-Meier estimates.

Overall survival (OS) 
At the clinical cut-off (July 23, 2008) 130 randomized patients had died: 68 patients (25%) in the FC 
arm and 62 patients (23%) in the R-FC arm. The median survival time was (51.9 months) for patients 
in the FC arm and OS could not be estimated for patients in the R-FC arm. See figure 2.

Treatment  with  R-FC  reduced  the  risk  of  death  by  17%  when  compared  to  FC  alone,  however  a 
difference which was not statistically significant (unadjusted HR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.59, 1.17; p = 0.2871, 
Wald  test).  At  clinical  cut-off,  the  data  were  still  relatively  immature,  with  the  great  majority  of 
patients still alive in both treatment arms.  
An overall survival analysis may be hampered by next line therapies. Besides that the study was not 
powered  to  demonstrate  a  benefit,  any  forthcoming  assessment  of  survival  in  the  study  population, 
while excluding patients that subsequently received rituximab after failure of the 2nd line, is considered 
not  an  option.  Very  few  randomised  clinical  studies  including  CLL  patients  have  shown  survival 
benefit  reflecting  a  relatively  long  natural  history  in  an  elderly  patient  population.  However,  the

applicant has confirmed that overall survival data will continue to be collected and will submitted post 
approval.

With the exception of DFS, the analysis of secondary endpoints are in line with the results on PFS for 
R-FC  compared  with  FC  as  observed  in  the  analysis  of  the  key  secondary  efficacy  parameters.  The 
observation on DFS was also seen in the pivotal trial for the application for first line indication in CLL 
(study  ML17102).  Apart  from  DFS,  results  from  other  secondary  endpoints  can  be  considered 
supportive for the rituximab containing arm of BO17072. 
Quality of Life (QoL) 
QoL  assessment,  using  the  FACT-G  questionnaire,  up  to  one  year  after  study  onset,  revealed  no 
advantages for the addition of rituximab to FC. Nonetheless, although pivotal trial BO17072 was an 
open  label  study,  any  disadvantages  with  regard  to  rituximab  appeared  not  to  have  affected  QoL 
substantially. 
Subgroup analysis of the pivotal study (BO17072) 
In the study BO17072, in general the results of the PFS subgroup analyses were consistent with the 
results seen in the overall ITT population. The risk of disease progression or death was reduced in the 
R-FC arm compared to the FC arm in almost all of the 48 subgroups analyzed.  
Only  the  subgroup  of  patients  who  received  treatment  ≥ 10 years  from  first  diagnosis  (unadjusted 
HR = 1.02;  95%  CI:  0.52,  1.99),  and  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  negative  CD38  at  baseline 
(unadjusted HR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.64) had a hazard ratio >1.0.

In  all  other  subgroups,  the  risk  of  disease  progression  or  death  was  reduced  with  a  risk  reduction 
ranging from 1% (for patients > 70 years old) to 80% (for patients who were ZAP70+ and had mutated 
IgVH). In most of the subgroups analyzed, the risk reduction ranged between 40% and 60% and point 
estimates (not adjusted) were below 1 indicating a clinical benefit for R-FC.  
The risk of progression or death was reduced in patients with and without del17p (del17p being a poor 
prognostic marker and associated with treatment resistance) and in all Binet stages. Subgroup analyses 
for OS, based on baseline prognostic parameters and putative prognostic markers, were consistent with 
the results of OS in the overall population and with the PFS analysis. Although subgroups were small 
and relatively few events were observed, there was a tendency towards a reduced risk of death with R-
FC compared to FC for most of the subgroups analyzed.  
2. 4. 
Supportive studies: efficacy 
Patient populations in the supportive studies 
In the supportive studies of rituximab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with previously 
treated  CLL,  the  median  age  was  in  the  range  of  59  to  66 years.  Patients  enrolled  in  the  supportive 
studies were slightly younger than the median age of diagnosis for CLL (65-72) but similar to patients 
in the pivotal study BO17072. Apart from the study by Wierda et al. (in which half of the patients had 
Rai stage 0-2 disease), the majority of patients enrolled in the supportive studies had high risk disease 
(between 59% and 86% of patients had Rai stage  ≥ 3 disease or approximately two-thirds of patients 
with Binet stage C disease), and treatment had failed after a median of two prior therapies for CLL. 
Progression free survival (PFS) 
Results of PFS were available from 2 studies in previously treated patients with CLL (see table 3).

Overall Survival  
In  the  retrospective  comparison  of  three  sequential  groups  of  patients  with  relapsed/refractory  CLL 
(refer  to  the  paper  by  Wierda  et  al.),  estimated  median  survival  times  were  significantly  longer  for 
patients in the R-FC cohort compared to patients in the FC or F cohort (p = 0.05 for R-FC vs FC and 
p<0.01  for  R-FC  vs  F).  Median  OS  was  49  months  (R-FC),  31  months  (FC)  and  19  months  (F), 
respectively. Note that OS results in non-randomized comparisons should be interpreted with caution. 
In a small study including 34 poor prognostic patients with relapsed/refractory CLL (refer to Lamann 
et  al.  See  table  1),  the  median  survival  was  44 months  for  patients  treated  with  rituximab  in 
combination with PC.  
In a retrospective review of patients receiving a range of salvage therapies after failure of first-line R-
FC therapy, the median survival after first salvage therapy was 30 months and was significantly longer 
for patients who achieved a CR or nPR with first salvage therapy (median 46 months) than for those 
who only achieved a PR or no response (median 10 months). Duration of response to first-line R-FC, 
β2-microglobulin  level  and  Rai  stage  predicted  survival  after  salvage  therapy  but  the  actual  salvage 
regimen did not (refer to the Mabthera registration study on 1st line CLL, ML17102). 
Overall Response rates  
In supportive studies, ORRs were similarly high and ranged from 67% (rituximab in combination with 
cladribine) to 94% (rituximab in combination with PCM). In the retrospective analysis by Wierda et 
al. (Cancer, 2006, 106:37-345), the overall response rate was significantly higher for patients who had 
received R-FC compared with patients who had received fludarabine (p=0.008), but not compared to 
patients who received FC. However, the proportion of CRs was significantly higher in patients in the 
R-FC cohort compared to patients in the fludarabine and FC cohorts (p<0.05). 
2. 5. 
Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The  safety  population  (SAP)  in  study  BO17072  consisted  of  546  patients  (272  patients  on  FC,  274 
patients on R-FC). An overview of the safety data reported in this study with a clinical cut-off date of 
July 23, 2008 is shown in Table 4.

Overall, the safety profile of rituximab in CLL was consistent with its expected safety profile and no 
unexpected new safety signals were detected. There were more cases of hepatitis B (primary infection 
and reactivation) than expected in the R-FC arm, a slight imbalance in second malignancies compared 
with the FC arm. 
Adverse events 
Overall, patients in the R-FC arm experienced more AEs than patients in the FC arm (1468 AEs in FC, 
1797 AEs in R-FC), mostly due to AEs in the following system organ classes (SOCs):

All Grade AEs which occurred with an at least 2% higher incidence in the R-FC arm than in the FC 
arm  are  summarized  in  Table  5.  Overall,  the  slightly  higher  frequencies  and  the  types  of  events  (all 
Grades) observed in the R-FC arm are consistent with the known safety profile of rituximab and do 
not pose any new safety concerns. 
Grade 3/4 AEs which occurred with a 2% or higher incidence in the R-FC arm compared with the FC 
arm  are  summarized  in  table  6,  and  include  (febrile)  neutropenia,  granulocytopenia  and  hepatitis  B 
infections. This information is used to update the prescribing information.

Multiple occurrences of the same adverse event in one individual counted only once. 
Only AEs with a missing onset date or an onset date on or after the date of first trial 
medication are considered. 
Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia are already reported in the prescribing information with the same 
frequency grouping “very common” (incidence of  ≥ 10%). Granulocytopenia has not been reported in 
the  prescribing  information  and  it  is  proposed  to  report  it  in  the  “common”  frequency  grouping 
( ≥ 1% <10%). 
The  incidence  of  thrombocytopenia  in  the  R-FC  arm  of  study  BO17072  was  slightly  higher  (1.8%) 
than in the FC arm but this is not captured in  table 5 which uses a 2% cut-off. This event is already 
reported  in  the  prescribing  information  in  the  frequency  grouping  “common”  and,  based  on  the 
frequency observed in study BO17072, the MAH proposes that this be changed to “very common”. 
Based on the incidence of hepatitis B cases observed in study BO17072 (6 patients with a Grade 3/4 
event with 5 patients actually experienced Grade 3/4 hepatitis B the MAH proposes to report this event 
in  the  “common”  frequency  grouping  and  to  update  the  Warning  Section  in  the  prescribing 
information. 
The proportion of Grade 3/4 AEs considered by the investigators to be related (remotely, possibly or 
probably related) to treatment was slightly higher in the R-FC arm (83% of Grade 3/4 AEs in the FC 
arm  vs.  86%  of  Grade  3/4  AEs  in  the  R-FC  arm)  and  the  proportion  of  patients  with  a 
Grade 3/4 related AE was higher in the R-FC arm (67% FC vs. 74% R-FC).  
More  patients  in  the  R-FC  arm  had  a  grade  3/4  related  AE  within  the  blood  and  lymphatic  system 
disorders SOC (59% of patients in the FC arm vs. 64% of patients in the R-FC arm) and within the 
infections and infestations SOC (16% FC vs. 14% R-FC).

The incidence of grade 3 and 4 infections (mainly pneumonia, herpes zoster, sepsis or bronchitis) was 
comparable between the treatment groups. There was no consistent increase in infection rates across 
different  age  categories  or  disease  stages  according  to  Binet.    A  total  of  31  patients  died  from 
infections, 19 patients (5%) in the FC arm and 12 patients (3%) in the R-FC arm. In 5 patients in the 
FC arm and in 4 patients in the R-FC arm, death due to infection was considered treatment-related.  
Overall, with the exception of hepatitis B, the slightly higher frequencies and the types of Grade 3/4 
adverse events observed in the R-FC arm are consistent with the known safety profile of rituximab and 
do not pose any new safety concerns.  
Deaths and Serious adverse events  
Deaths 
General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions,  including  progressive  disease  (PD),  were  the 
major  cause  of  death  in both  treatment  arms  (18 patients  (7%)  in  FC  vs.  17 patients  (6%)  in  R-FC). 
Infections  and  infestations  (including  pneumonia,  septic  shock  and  sepsis)  were  responsible  for  the 
deaths of 19 patients (7%) in the FC arm and 14 patients (5%) in the R-FC arm. Fourteen patients died 
due to cardiac disorders (6 patients (2%) in FC, 8 patients (3%) in R-FC).  
The  investigators  considered  14 deaths  (5%)  in  the  FC  arm  and  19 deaths  (7%;  including  one  death 
due  to  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome  [probably  related  to  cefotaxime]  and  one  death  from  Hodgkin’s 
disease/CLL transformation) in the R-FC arm related to treatment.  
Of the 33 patients who died from infections and infestations, 16 deaths were considered to be related 
to study treatment (3% [7/272] in FC vs. 3% [9/274] in R-FC). 
SAEs 
A  slightly  higher  incidence  of  SAEs  was  observed  in  the  R-FC  arm  (130 patients  [48%]  in  FC; 
137 patients [50%] in R-FC with at least one serious adverse event [SAE]).  
A slight increase in incidence of febrile neutropenia was observed in the R-FC arm (11%) compared to 
the FC arm (8%), while there was a higher incidence of anemia (reported as an SAE) in the FC arm 
(4% in FC vs 1% in R-FC). An equal number of patients in each arm (54 patients [20%]) experienced 
an SAE categorized under infections and infestations, although SAEs of hepatitis B infection occurred 
only  in  the  R-FC  arm  (6  patients).  36%  of  the  patients  in  the  FC  arm  experienced  at  least  one 
treatment-related SAE compared to 39% of patients in the R-FC arm. 
Secondary malignancies 
Overall, 40 patients experienced 44 AEs classified as neoplasm (17/272 [6%] in FC; 23/274 [8%] in 
R-FC). Furthermore, 36 patients experienced SAEs classified as neoplasm (15 patients in FC and 
21 patients in R-FC) and 12 patients had fatal AEs classified as neoplasm (2 patients in FC [3 events] 
and 10 patients [11 events] in R-FC). 
Laboratory findings 
A higher number of shifts to Grade 3/4 values in the R-FC arm were observed for white blood cells, 
lymphocytes and neutrophils compared to the FC arm, which correlated with the increased incidence 
of  neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia  and  granulocytopenia.  Higher  frequency  of  shifts  to  Grade 3/4 
levels  was  observed  in  the  R-FC  arm  for  AST,  ALT,  total  bilirubin  and  to  lesser  extent  LDH.  The 
reason  for  this  imbalance  between  the  arms  is  not  clear.  There  was  no  corresponding  imbalance 
between the FC and R-FC arms for hepatobiliary AEs, Grade 3/4 AEs or SAEs, with the exception of 
hepatitis B.  The  cases  of  acute  or  chronic  hepatitis B  infection  and/or  reactivation  in  the  R-FC  arm 
may account for some of the difference in Grade 3/4 liver function test abnormalities between the two 
arms but, these do not fully account for the difference as observed. 
Supportive studies: safety 
The safety data on rituximab in combination with chemotherapy in the supporting studies is consistent 
with the safety profile in the pivotal study, BO17072. In particular, myelotoxicity and gastrointestinal 
disorders were seen in both the pivotal and the supportive trials and related to the use of rituximab.

Risk Management plan 
The  MAH  has  submitted  an  updated  combined  Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  for  rituximab  in  the 
indications  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA),  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL)  and  chronic  lymphocytic 
leukaemia (CLL), version 3.1. The applicant announced that the only significant new data included in 
the  updated  RMP  are  in  the  oncology  sections:  data  on  rituximab  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
relapsed/refractory  CLL  became  available  from  study  BO17072  (REACH).  Also,  new  data  are 
included in the paediatric off-label section; however, these changes do not present new safety findings.

tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, 
see section 4.3) or severely immunocompromised 
patients (e.g. in hypogammaglobulinemia or where 
levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low). Physicians 
should exercise caution when considering the use 
of MabThera in patients with a history of recurring 
or chronic infections or with underlying conditions 
which may further predispose patients to serious 
infection (see section 4.8).  
Patients reporting signs and symptoms of infection 
following MabThera therapy should be promptly 
evaluated and treated appropriately. Before giving 
a subsequent course of MabThera treatment, 
patients should be re-evaluated for any potential 
risk for infections. 
Very rare cases of Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported 
following use of MabThera for the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases 
including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) 
and Vasculitis. These cases involved patients with 
multiple risk factors for PML, including the 
underlying disease and long-term 
immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy. 
In patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
receiving rituximab in combination with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, very rare cases of hepatitis B 
reactivation have been reported (see non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma). 
As described in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC:  
4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Method of Administration 
Premedication with glucocorticoids should be 
considered if MabThera is not given in 
combination with glucocorticoid-containing 
chemotherapy for treatment of non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. 
Premedication consisting of an anti-pyretic and an 
antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and 
diphenhydramine, should always be administered 
bedore each infusion of MabThera. 
First infusion 
The recommended initial rate for infusion is 
50 mg/hr; after the first 30 minutes, it can be 
escalated in 50 mg/hr increments every 30 minutes, 
to a maximum of 400 mg/hr. 
Subsequent infusions 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
Subsequent doses of MabThera can be infused at 
an initial rate of 100 mg/hr, and increased by 
100 mg/hr increments at 30 minutes intervals, to a 
maximum of 400 mg/hr. 
The  prepared  MabThera  solution  should  be 
administered as an intravenous infusion through a 
dedicated line. It should not be administered as an 
intravenous push or bolus. 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
‘Infusion reactions  
MabThera is associated with infusion reactions, 
which may be related to release of cytokines and/or 
other chemical mediators. Premedication with 
intravenous glucocorticoid significantly reduced 
the incidence and severity of these events (see 
section 4.8).  
Most infusion events reported were mild to 
moderate in severity. The proportion of affected 
patients decreases with subsequent infusions. The 
reactions reported were usually reversible with a 
reduction in rate, or interruption, of MabThera 
infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an 
antihistamine, and, occasionally, oxygen, 
intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and 
glucocorticoids if required. In most cases, the 
infusion can be resumed at a 50 % reduction in 
rate (e.g. from 100 mg/h to 50 mg/h) when 
symptoms have completely resolved. 
Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions 
have been reported following the intravenous 
administration of proteins, including MabThera, to 
patients. Medicinal products for the treatment of 
hypersensitivity reactions, e.g., epinephrine 
(adrenaline), antihistamines and glucocorticoids, 
should be available for immediate use in the event 
of an allergic reaction during administration of 
MabThera. The presence of HACA may be 
associated with worsening infusion or allergic 
reactions after the second infusion of subsequent 
courses (see section 5.1). 
In  clinical  studies  10/990  (1 %)  patients  with 
rheumatoid  arthritis  who  received  a  first  infusion 
of  MabThera  at  any  dose  experienced  a  serious 
reaction during the infusion (see section 4.8).

Immunization 
Physicians should review the patient’s vaccination 
status and follow current immunization guidelines 
prior to MabThera therapy. Vaccination should be 
completed at least 4 weeks prior to first 
administration of MabThera. 
The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines 
following MabThera therapy has not been studied. 
Therefore vaccination with live virus vaccines is 
not recommended whilst on MabThera or whilst 
peripherally B cell depleted.  
Patients treated with MabThera may receive non-
live vaccinations. However, response rates to non-
live vaccines may be reduced. In a randomized 
study, patients with RA treated with MabThera and 
methotrexate had comparable response rates to 
tetanus recall antigen (39% vs. 42%), reduced 
rates to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
(43% vs. 82% to at least 2 pneumococcal antibody 
serotypes), and KLH neoantigen (47% vs. 93%), 
when given 6 months after MabThera as compared 
to patients only receiving methotrexate. Should 
non-live vaccinations be required whilst receiving 
MabThera therapy, these should be completed at 
least 4 weeks prior to commencing the next course 
of MabThera. 
In the overall experience of MabThera repeat 
treatment over one year, the proportions of 
patients with positive antibody titers against S. 
pneumoniae, influenza, mumps, rubella, varicella 
and tetanus toxoid were generally similar to the 
proportions at baseline.

Malignancy 
Immunomodulatory drugs may increase the risk of 
malignancy. On the basis of limited experience 
with MabThera in rheumatoid arthritis patients 
(see section 4.8) a possible risk for the 
development of solid tumours cannot be excluded 
at this time, although present data do not seem to 
suggest any increased risk.

Pregnancy 
IgG immunoglobulins are known to cross the 
placental barrier. 
B cell levels in human neonates following maternal 
exposure to MabThera have not been studied in 
clinical trials. There are no adequate and well-
controlled data from studies in pregnant women, 
however transient B-cell depletion and 
lymphocytopenia have been reported in some 
infants born to mothers exposed to rituximab 
during pregnancy. For these reasons MabThera 
should not be administered to pregnant women 
unless the possible benefit outweighs the potential 
risk. 
Due to the long retention time of rituximab in 
B cell depleted patients, women of childbearing 
potential should use effective contraceptive 
methods during treatment and for 12 months 
following MabThera therapy. 
Developmental toxicity studies performed in 
cynomolgus monkeys revealed no evidence of 
embryotoxicity in utero. New born offspring of 
maternal animals exposed to MabThera were noted 
to have depleted B cell populations during the post 
natal phase.  
Lactation 
Whether rituximab is excreted in human milk is not 
known. However, because maternal IgG is excreted 
in  human  milk,  and  rituximab  was  detectable  in 
milk  from  lactating  monkeys,  women  should  not 
breastfeed while treated with MabThera and for 12

aggressive symptomatic treatment. Since initial 
improvement of clinical symptoms may be followed 
by deterioration, these patients should be closely 
monitored until tumour lysis syndrome and 
pulmonary infiltration have been resolved or ruled 
out. Further treatment of patients after complete 
resolution of signs and symptoms has rarely 
resulted in repeated severe cytokine release

4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy 
Use of MabThera maybe associated with an 
increased risk of Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy (PML). Patients must be 
monitored at regular intervals for any new or 
worsening neurological symptoms or signs that 
may be suggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, 
further dosing must be suspended until PML has 
been excluded. The clinician should evaluate the 
patient to determine if the symptoms are indicative 
of neurological dysfunction, and if so, whether 
these symptoms are possibly suggestive of PML. 
Consultation with a Neurologist should be 
considered as clinically indicated. 
If any doubt exists, further evaluation, including 
MRI scan preferably with contrast, CSF testing for 
JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological 
assessments, should be considered.  
The physician should be particularly alert to 
symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may 
not notice (e.g. cognitive, neurological or 
psychiatric symptoms). Patients should also be 
advised to inform their partner or caregivers about 
their treatment, since they may notice symptoms 
that the patient is not aware of. 
If a patient develops PML the dosing of MabThera 
must be permanently discontinued.  
Following reconstitution of the immune system in 
immunocompromised patients with PML, 
stabilisation or improved outcome has been seen. It 
remains unknown if early detection of PML and 
suspension of MabThera therapy may lead to 
similar stabilisation or improved outcome.

The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines, 
following MabThera therapy has not been studied 
for NHL and CLL patients and vaccination with 
live virus vaccines is not recommended. Patients 
treated with MabThera may receive non-live 
vaccinations. However with non-live vaccines 
response rates may be reduced. In a non-
randomized study, patients with relapsed low-
grade NHL who received MabThera monotherapy 
when compared to healthy untreated controls had 
a lower rate of response to vaccination with 
tetanus recall antigen (16% vs. 81%) and Keyhole 
Limpet Haemocyanin (KLH) neoantigen (4% vs. 
69% when assessed for >2-fold increase in 
antibody titer). For CLL patients similar results 
are assumable considering similarities between 
both diseases but that has not been investigated in

4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
Although MabThera is not myelosuppressive in 
monotherapy, caution should be exercised when 
considering treatment of patients with neutrophils 
< 1.5 x 109/l and/or platelet counts < 75 x 109/l as 
clinical experience in this population is limited. 
MabThera has been used in 21 patients who 
underwent autologous bone marrow 
transplantation and other risk groups with a 
presumable reduced bone marrow function without 
inducing myelotoxicity.  
Consideration should be given to the need for 
regular full blood counts, including platelet counts, 
during monotherapy with MabThera. When 
MabThera is given in combination with CHOP or 
CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and

3. 
Overall Discussion and Benefit/ Risk Assessment 
The proposed indication for rituximab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with 
relapsed/refractory CLL is based on data from one pivotal study (BO17072 -REACH). This was a 
multicentre/multinational, open label, prospectively planned, randomised controlled study. In this 
study 552 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups through a central randomisation to 
either the combination of R-FC or FC alone. In view of current practices in this patient group the 
choice of the treatment modalities and schedules in the active and the control arms are considered 
justified. 
Although a pre-planned interim efficacy analysis of study BO17072 was performed after two-thirds 
(190/284 planned, 205 actual) of the events (progression or deaths) had been reported, it was decided 
that PFS did not cross the pre-specified threshold at that time (actual result: p=0.012) and, because all 
patients had completed therapy, the data monitoring board recommended that the study should be 
continued until the final analysis. As a consequence, only results from the final analysis (data cut-off 
July 23 2008) were submitted. 
The primary endpoint was the Progression-free Survival (PFS); the secondary endpoints included the 
Event-free Survival, Overall Survival (OS), Disease-free Survival (DFS), Overall Response Rate and 
Time to new CLL Treatment. Although in general PFS is considered a surrogate endpoint when 
assessing efficacy, in the setting of 2nd  line treatment of CLL this endpoint can nevertheless be 
considered of clinical relevance especially when assessment of OS may be hampered by the effect of 
next line therapies. 
The patient population studied can be considered as representative for the general population with 
relapse or refractory CLL and baseline characteristics appeared balanced between the two treatment 
arms. Patients with ECOG PS >1 were not eligible.  
Results from BO17072 on PFS showed substantial improvement of PFS: The KM estimate in the ITT 
population showed median PFS of 20.6 months with FC versus 30.6 months with R-FC. This 
difference is statistically significant (p=0.0002) and the HR was 0.65 (95% CI 0.51 - 0.82). Therefore 
this pivotal trial BO17072 data on PFS showed a statistically significant and clinically relevant 
improvement of the Progression free Survival. In addition, an increase in Event-free Survival and 
Overall Response Rate confirmed the benefit for rituximab plus FC in patients with relapsed or 
refractory CLL. Although a trend towards an OS benefit is envisaged, formal proof of benefit in 
survival is lacking possibly due to next line treatments and also QoL improvement was not 
demonstrated. 
The treatment benefits observed with R-FC were seen in nearly all of the subgroups analyzed except 
for patients that relapsed >10 years after initial treatment and for patients with CD38 negative CLL 
phenotype (a prognostic favourable subgroup).  
From the supportive studies it may be concluded that the addition of rituximab to various appropriate 
other chemotherapy regimens for relapsed CLL improves efficacy regarding PFS, although also here, 
as in trial BO17072, indications of survival benefit are limited.  
With regard to safety, the risks of rituximab in CLL patients were comparable to known safety profiles 
of rituximab used in approved indications in combination with other cytotoxic chemotherapy 
regimens. In particular, higher incidences of neutropenia, leukopenia, febrile neutropenia and 
pancytopenia were also seen in patients treated with rituximab for 1st line treatment of CLL and in 
NHL. The addition of rituximab did not increase the rate of treatment discontinuations due to toxicity 
or the incidence of treatment related deaths compared to FC alone.  
Myelotoxicity,  hepatitis B and secondary neoplasms were more apparent in the R-FC arm. 
Overall, the benefits of the addition of rituximab to the combination fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide with regard to PFS outweigh the risk related to this addition. The PFS benefit in 
relapsed or refractory CLL is substantial, 10 months, and this clearly reflects a clinically relevant 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
advantage. Although OS benefit could not be proven, it can be envisaged that rituximab leads to 
prolonged survival as well.  Therefore the benefit/risk ratio is considered positive.  
The application could be approvable, provided other concerns are resolved. 
The indication for first line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was recently approved. 
Consequently, it can be foreseen that in future patients, that may encounter refractoriness to 1st line 
treatment, or patients that may relapse after initial treatment, will have had rituximab as part of prior 
first line therapy.  
Study  BO17072  excluded  patients  who  were  previously  treated  with  rituximab  or  other  monoclonal 
antibodies.  At  the  time  of  study  planning  in  2001  and  2002,  patients  who  had  received  monoclonal 
antibody  treatment  in  the  first-line  setting  were  considered  rare  as  no  monoclonal  antibodies  were 
approved for the first-line treatment of patients with CLL. Standard first-line treatments were mainly 
fludarabine  monotherapy  and  chlorambucil  (with  or  without  corticosteroids),  the  two  first-line 
regimens that contributed most to the patient pool in study BO17072 (REACH). 
During the last 5-7 years, use of first-line fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) combinations has 
increased  as  a  result  of  a  number  of  randomised  phase  III  trials  showing  superiority  of  fludarabine 
over chlorambucil, and of FC over fludarabine monotherapy. Meanwhile, the ML17102 (CLL-8) trial 
has  demonstrated  that  the  addition  of  rituximab  to  FC  (R-FC)  is  superior  to  FC  alone,  with  higher 
response rates and complete response (CR) rates, and longer progression-free survival (PFS) reported. 
Accordingly, it is expected that R-FC will rapidly become the combination of choice for patients with 
previously  untreated  CLL  who  are  suitable  for  fludarabine-based  therapy.  However,  the  ML17102 
(CLL-8)  study  data  also  indicate  that  although  patients  treated  with  R-FC  benefit  from  the 
prolongation of PFS, ultimately most patients will still relapse and require further therapy. 
Limited data that are available from approximately 180 patients demonstrate that rituximab-containing 
regimens,  specifically  repeat  administration  of  R-FC  (and  variants  thereof)  are  a  viable  and  useful 
therapeutic option for patients whose initial treatment contained rituximab. There is no data published 
indicating that regimens that do not contain rituximab produce better outcomes than regimens that do 
incorporate  rituximab.  An  exclusion  of  CLL  patients  who  have  previously  received  rituximab-
containing therapy from treatment with rituximab-containing combinations at relapse would limit the 
available  options  therefore  it  was  considered  appropriate  to  leave  the  treatment  decision  to  the 
clinician. 
The  overall  results  of  salvage  therapy  after  first-line  FCR  therapy  are  unsatisfactory  as  stated  by 
Keating  et  al.  That  fact  may  be  due  both  to  refractoriness  to  the  two  most  important  classes  of 
cytotoxics for CLL, alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide) and fluoropyrimidines (fludarabine), and to 
anti-CD20  therapy  (rituximab).  It  seems  much  more  likely  that  refractoriness  to  conventional 
chemotherapy  plays  a  major  role  in  the  unsatisfactory  second-line  response  than  the  limited 
contribution  of  rituximab.  Therefore,  a  restrictive  wording  as  regards  rituximab  is  not  justified. 
However, it seems that the results from study BO17072 may not be fully translated to that particular 
population  of  CLL  patients.  If  FCR  becomes  standard  first  line  therapy  for  CLL  patients  who  can 
tolerate this regimen the same regimen may not be generally appropriate as second-line therapy. The 
decision  to  use  FCR  as  second-line  therapy  in  that  population  may  depend  on  a  number  of  other 
factors (primary refractoriness to FCR, early relapse after initial FCR, long disease-free interval after 
FCR,  patient  tolerability  and  performance  status  etc.).  Such  clinical  decisions  are  not  easily 
transferable to the SPC wording, hence the following statement was agreed: “Limited data on efficacy 
and safety for patients previously treated with monoclonal antibodies including rituximab or patients 
refractory to fludarabine or any nucleoside analogue are available.” 
Rituximab  is  currently  not  licensed  in  paediatric  NHL.  The  MAH  is  working  with  paediatric 
collaborative groups to support a randomised international clinical trial in which about 300 paediatric 
patients  will  be  treated  with  rituximab  (plus  300  controls),  and  in  which  all  adverse  events  will  be 
collected  up  to  5  years.  In  addition,  the  MAH  is  planning  to  implement  an  enhanced 
pharmacovigilance  system  in  August  2009,  which  will  proactively  follow  up  all  paediatric  adverse 
event  reports  received  by  the  MAH,  including  reports  of  ‘off-label’  use.  This  will  utilise  a  ‘guided 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
questionnaire’  to  better  characterise  the  reports.  The  guided  questionnaires  will  be  ‘tracked’  and 
followed  up  closely.  This  information  will  be  included  in  the  periodic  safety  update  report  (PSUR) 
which is submitted to the EMEA on a regular basis. 
Both these proposals have been described in the rituximab Paediatric Investigation Plan. 
The MAH confirmed that collection of overall survival data will continue. The MAH intends to submit 
one updated analysis on overall survival with a clinical data cut-off approximately 24 months after the 
cut-off for the final analysis (data cut-off for final analysis was July 23, 2008). The up-dated OS data 
will be submitted to the EMEA about 5 months later, ie around Dec 2010. It is expected that with this 
additional  follow-up,  about  40-50%  of  deaths  will  have  been  observed  in  the  BO17072  (REACH) 
study. Further follow-up for survival is not planned after the 2010 cut-off, since results of the primary 
analysis  of  the  study  were  released  to  the  public  in  November  2008  and  substantial  cross  over  to 
rituximab is expected to occur which will confound any future analyses. Accordingly, it is considered 
unlikely that an OS benefit will be observed at the next OS update or subsequently. 
Benefits 
Superior efficacy for the primary endpoint PFS has been convincingly demonstrated in favour of the 
rituximab  containing  combination.  The  primary  endpoint  of  PFS  was  prolonged  by  a  median  of  10 
months (20.6 months for FC and 30.6 months for R-FC) and the risk of disease progression or death 
was reduced by 35% when rituximab was added to the FC regimen (p=0.0002, Log-Rank test).  This 
PFS benefit was robust and apparent in almost all of 48 pre-specified subgroups. 
In addition, an increase in Event-free Survival and Overall Response Rate confirmed the benefit for 
rituximab plus FC in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Also a trend towards an OS benefit is 
envisaged, but as the overall survival data may be hampered by subsequent treatment options, the data 
may be difficult to interpret. 
From the supportive studies it may be concluded that the addition of rituximab to various appropriate 
other chemotherapy regimens for relapsed CLL improves efficacy regarding PFS, although also here 
indications of survival benefit are limited.  
Risks 
With  regard  to  safety,  the  risks  of  rituximab  in  CLL  patients  were  comparable  to  the  well  known 
safety profile of rituximab. The safety profile of rituximab plus FC was very acceptable with only the 
expected addition of rituximab-related side effects to those of FC (more infections and more infusion-
related events). 
The patient numbers included in the analysis might have been too small to detect prognostic factors for 
secondary malignancies. Inclusion of “second malignancies” as a potential risk for NHL and CLL in 
the  RMP  is  accepted.  Routine  pharmacovigilance  activities  including  discussion  and  monitoring  of 
second malignancies from spontaneous reporting and other sources in PSURs is considered sufficient 
at  this  moment.  For  each  case  report  of  second  malignancy  the  MAH  should  analyse  and  report 
whether a causal relationship between the event and rituximab can be excluded. The overall discussion 
of second malignancies should always be based on cumulative data from all sources (all reports up to 
the data lock point). The MAH commits to provide the relevant information as asked for in the next 
and following PSURs.

the  addition  of  rituximab 
Balance  
Overall, 
the  combination  fludarabine  and 
cyclophosphamide with regard to PFS outweigh the risk related to this addition. The PFS benefit in 
relapsed  or  refractory  CLL  is  substantial,  10  months,  and  this  clearly  reflects  a  clinically  relevant 
advantage.  Although  OS  benefit  could  not  be  proven,  it  can  be  envisaged  that  rituximab  leads  to 
prolonged survival as well.  
The  benefit/risk  ratio  is  considered  positive,  as  the  MAH  revised  the  SPC  according  to  the  CHMP 
recommendations provided and committed to provide follow-up information.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
AQUMELDI is indicated for the treatment of heart failure in children from birth to less than 18 years.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
AQUMELDI should be initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of paediatric patients with 
heart failure.
Posology
Starting/test dose
0.01 to 0.04 mg/kg (max 2 mg) as a single initial dose.
 Before giving a test dose, blood pressure (BP) and renal function should be checked. If the BP is
below the 5th percentile or creatinine is above normal limit for age, then enalapril should not be
given.
 Test dose should be at the lower end of the range for less stable patients and in infants <30 days of
age.
 Blood pressure should be monitored at intervals for 1–2 hours after the initial dose. If systolic BP
is below the 5th percentile enalapril should be stopped and appropriate clinical care given.
Target/maintenance dose
0.15 to 0.3 mg/kg (max 20 mg) per day in one or two divided doses 8 hours after test dose.
The dose should be individualised according to blood pressure, serum creatinine and potassium 
response. 

If systolic blood pressure (SBP) is greater than or equal to the 5th percentile and serum
creatinine is no more than 1.5 × baseline, consider enalapril dose up-titration.
If SBP is below the 5th percentile and serum creatinine is more than 2 × baseline, enalapril
should be stopped.
If systolic blood pressure is below the 5th percentile and serum creatinine is between 1.5 and 2 ×
baseline, enalapril dose should be titrated down.
If SBP is above the 5th percentile and serum creatinine is more than 2 × baseline, enalapril dose
should be titrated down.



2

If systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to the 5th percentile and serum creatinine is 
between 1.5 to 2 × baseline the enalapril should be continued at the same dose. 
At any stage if potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/l pause enalapril treatment. Once hyperkalaemia has resolved, 
restart enalapril on the same or a lower dose level. If hyperkalaemia recurs, repeat the above and 
restart at a lower level. If potassium is repeatedly above 5.5 mmol/l, despite multiple dose decreases, 
discontinue enalapril.
If a dose of AQUMELDI is missed the next dose should be given as usual. Do not give a double dose 
to make up for a forgotten dose.
Special populations
Renal impairment
Special precautions should be followed in patients with impaired renal function (see section 4.3 and 
4.4):

Enalapril is contraindicated in paediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
<30 ml/min/1.73 m2 (see section 4.3).
GFR ≥50 ml/min/1.73 m2: Dose adjustment not required. 
GFR ≥30-<50 ml/min/1.73 m2: Start with 50% of the single dose and dose at 12 hour intervals.
For dialysis: Start with 25% of the normal single dose and dose at 12 hour intervals. 



The dose should be increased to the highest possible tolerated dose depending on the effect. 
Depending on the clinical condition of the patient, the creatinine and potassium concentrations should 
be checked within 2 weeks after the start of treatment and then at least once a year. 
Hepatic impairment
No data is available for treatment of paediatric subjects with liver impairment. Dose adjustment is not 
considered necessary however such children should only be treated with enalapril under strict 
monitoring. Treatment of children below the age of 1 month with hepatic impairment is not 
recommended (see section 4.4).
Children less than 30 days of age
Treatment of infants < 30 days of age should only be conducted with rigorous monitoring, including 
blood pressure, serum potassium levels and renal function. 
Method of administration
For oral use only. Place on the tongue or in the buccal cavity and allow to disperse. 
AQUMELDI can be taken with or without meals.
For instructions on administering starting doses < 0.25 mg and in case of feeding tube administration, 
see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications





Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or any 
other angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi).
History of angioedema associated with previous ACE inhibitor therapy.
Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema.
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).
The concomitant use of AQUMELDI with aliskiren-containing medicinal products is 
contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment 
(GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).
3


Combination with sacubitril/valsartan (a medicinal product containing a neprilysin inhibitor) 
due to the increased risk of angioedema. AQUMELDI is not to be administered within 36 hours 
of switching to or from sacubitril/valsartan (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
Paediatric patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.2).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Symptomatic hypotension
In patients with heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, symptomatic hypotension 
has been observed. This is most likely to occur in those patients with more severe degrees of heart 
failure, as reflected by the use of high doses of loop diuretics, hyponatraemia or functional renal 
impairment. In these patients, therapy should be started under medical supervision and the patients 
should be followed closely whenever the dose of AQUMELDI and/or diuretic is adjusted. Similar 
considerations may apply to patients with ischaemic heart or cerebrovascular disease in whom an 
excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident. 
In some patients with heart failure who have normal or low blood pressure, additional lowering of 
systemic blood pressure may occur with AQUMELDI. This effect is anticipated, and usually is not a 
reason to discontinue treatment. If hypotension becomes symptomatic, a reduction of dose and/or 
discontinuation of the diuretic and/or AQUMELDI may be necessary.
If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, should 
receive an intravenous infusion of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. A transient 
hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses, which can be given usually without 
difficulty once the blood pressure has increased after volume expansion.
Aortic or mitral valve stenosis/hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
As with all vasodilators, ACE inhibitors should be given with caution in patients with left ventricular 
valvular and outflow tract obstruction and avoided in cases of cardiogenic shock and 
haemodynamically significant obstruction.
Renal impairment
Renal failure has been reported in association with enalapril and has been seen mainly in patients with 
severe heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis. If recognised promptly 
and treated appropriately, renal failure when associated with enalapril therapy is usually reversible 
(see section 4.8).
Some hypertensive patients, with no apparent pre-existing renal disease have developed increases in 
blood urea and creatinine when enalapril has been given concurrently with a diuretic. Dose reduction 
of enalapril and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required (see section 4.2). This situation 
should raise the possibility of underlying renal artery stenosis (see renovascular hypertension below).
Renovascular hypertension
There is an increased risk of hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal 
artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with ACE inhibitors. 
Loss of renal function may occur with only mild changes in serum creatinine. In these patients, 
therapy should be initiated under close medical supervision with low doses, careful titration, and 
monitoring of renal function.
Kidney transplantation
There is no experience regarding the administration of AQUMELDI in patients with a recent kidney 
transplantation. Treatment with AQUMELDI is therefore not recommended.
4
Hepatic failure
Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice or 
hepatitis and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this 
syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked 
elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical 
follow-up.
Neutropenia/agranulocytosis
Neutropenia/agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia and anaemia have been reported in patients receiving 
ACE inhibitors. In patients with normal renal function and no other complicating factors, neutropenia 
occurs rarely. Enalapril should be used with extreme caution in patients with collagen vascular 
disease, immunosuppressant therapy, treatment with allopurinol or procainamide, or a combination of 
these complicating factors, especially if there is pre-existing impaired renal function. Some of these 
patients developed serious infections which in a few instances did not respond to intensive antibiotic 
therapy. If enalapril is used in such patients, periodic monitoring of white blood cell counts is advised 
and patients should be instructed to report any sign of infection.
Hypersensitivity/angioedema
Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has been reported in patients 
treated with ACE inhibitors, including enalapril. This may occur at any time during treatment. In such 
cases, AQUMELDI must be discontinued promptly, and appropriate monitoring should be instituted to 
ensure complete resolution of symptoms prior to dismissing the patient. Even in those instances where 
swelling of only the tongue is involved, without respiratory distress, patients may require prolonged 
observation since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient.
Very rarely, fatalities have been reported due to angioedema associated with laryngeal oedema or 
tongue oedema. Patients with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx are likely to experience 
airway obstruction, especially those with a history of airway surgery. Where there is involvement of 
the tongue, glottis or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, which may 
include subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1 000 (0.3 ml to 0.5 ml) and/or measures to ensure a 
patent airway, should be administered promptly.
Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema 
compared to non-blacks.
Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of 
angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see section 4.3).
Caution should be used when starting racecadotril, mTOR inhibitors (e.g. sirolimus, everolimus, 
temsirolimus) and vildagliptin in a patient already taking an ACE inhibitor.
Patients receiving concomitant ACE inhibitor and neprilysin inhibitor therapy (e.g., sacubitril, 
racecadotril) may be at increased risk for angioedema (see section 4.5). The combination of enalapril 
with sacubitril/valsartan is contraindicated due to the increased risk of angioedema (see section 4.3). 
Sacubitril/valsartan must not be initiated until 36 hours after taking the last dose of enalapril therapy. 
If treatment with sacubitril/valsartan is stopped, enalapril therapy must not be initiated until 36 hours 
after the last dose of sacubitril/valsartan (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).
Anaphylactoid reactions during hymenoptera desensitisation
Rarely, patients receiving ACE inhibitors during desensitisation with hymenoptera venom have 
experienced life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. These reactions were avoided by temporarily 
withholding ACE inhibitor therapy prior to each desensitisation.
5
Anaphylactoid reactions during LDL-apheresis
Rarely, patients receiving ACE inhibitors during low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-apheresis with 
dextran sulfate have experienced life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. These reactions were 
avoided by temporarily withholding ACE inhibitor therapy prior to each apheresis.
Haemodialysis patients
Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialysed with high-flux membranes (e.g., AN 
69®) and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. In these patients consideration should be given 
to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of antihypertensives.
Hypoglycaemia
Diabetic patients treated with oral antidiabetics or insulin starting an ACE inhibitor should be told to 
closely monitor for hypoglycaemia, especially during the first month of combined use (see 
section 4.5).
Cough
Cough has been reported with the use of ACE inhibitors. Characteristically, the cough is non-
productive, persistent, and resolves after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough 
should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis of cough.
Surgery/anaesthesia
In patients undergoing major surgery or during anaesthesia with medicinal products that produce 
hypotension, enalapril blocks angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If 
hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume 
expansion.
Hyperkalaemia
Elevations in serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors, 
including enalapril. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalaemia include those patients with 
renal insufficiency, worsening of renal function, age (> 70 years), diabetes mellitus, intercurrent 
events, in particular dehydration, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis and concomitant 
use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride), 
potassium supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes; or those patients taking other 
medicinal products associated with increases in serum potassium (e.g., heparin, trimethoprim-
containing products such as cotrimoxazole). Neonates are at increased risk of developing 
hyperkalaemia. The use of potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium-containing 
salt substitutes, or other medicinal products that may increase serum potassium, particularly in patients 
with impaired renal function may lead to a significant increase in serum potassium. Hyperkalaemia 
can cause serious, sometimes fatal arrhythmias. If concomitant use of enalapril and any of the above-
mentioned agents is deemed appropriate, they should be used with caution and with frequent 
monitoring of serum potassium (see section 4.5).
Lithium
The combination of lithium and enalapril is generally not recommended (see section 4.5).
Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)
There is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or 
aliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia, and decreased renal function (including 
6
acute renal failure). Blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II 
receptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).
If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist 
supervision and be subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood 
pressure.
ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with 
diabetic nephropathy.
Pregnancy
ACE inhibitors should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued ACE inhibitor therapy is 
considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative treatments which 
have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with 
ACE inhibitors must be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started 
(see sections 4.3 and 4.6).
Ethnic differences
As with other ACE inhibitors, enalapril is apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black 
people than in non-black, possibly because of a higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black 
hypertensive population. 
Paediatric population
AQUMELDI is not recommended in children in indications other than heart failure.
Caution is advised in children below 1 month of age as they may be very sensitive to the medical 
product. Data on the use of Aqumeldi in children below 1 month of age in the clinical studies is scarce 
(n=4). Any signs of adverse events and electrolytes should be closely monitored. 
Hepatic impairment
No data is available for treatment of paediatric subjects with pre-existing liver conditions. Therefore, 
paediatric subjects with pre-existing liver conditions should only be treated with enalapril under strict 
monitoring. Treatment of children below the age of 1 month with hepatic impairment is not 
recommended.
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
“sodium free”.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with AQUMELDI in the adult or paediatric population. 
Interaction studies with enalapril have only been performed in adults.
Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)
Clinical study data have shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system 
(RAAS) through the combined use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is 
associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and 
decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting 
agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).
7
Potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or other medicinal products that may increase 
serum potassium
ACE inhibitors attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. Potassium sparing diuretics (e.g., 
spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene or amiloride), potassium supplements, potassium-containing 
salt substitutes, or other medicinal products that may increase serum potassium (e.g., heparin, 
trimethoprim-containing products such as cotrimoxazole) may lead to significant increases in serum 
potassium. If concomitant use of enalapril and any of the above-mentioned agents is deemed 
appropriate, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium (see 
section 4.4).
Diuretics (thiazide or loop diuretics)
Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension 
when initiating therapy with enalapril (see section 4.4). The hypotensive effects can be reduced by 
discontinuation of the diuretic, by increasing volume or salt intake or by initiating therapy with a low 
dose of enalapril.
Antihypertensives
Concomitant use of these medicinal products may increase the hypotensive effects of enalapril. 
Concomitant use with nitroglycerine and other nitrates, or other vasodilators, may further reduce blood 
pressure.
Lithium
Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during 
concomitant administration of lithium with ACE inhibitors. Concomitant use of thiazide diuretics may 
further increase lithium levels and enhance the risk of lithium toxicity with ACE inhibitors. Use of 
enalapril with lithium is not recommended, but if the combination proves necessary, careful 
monitoring of serum lithium levels should be performed (see section 4.4).
Tricyclic antidepressants/antipsychotics/anaesthetics/narcotics
Concomitant use of certain anaesthetic medicinal products, tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics 
with ACE inhibitors may result in reduction of blood pressure (see section 4.4).
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) 
inhibitors
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors 
(COX-2 inhibitors) may reduce the effect of diuretics and other antihypertensives. Therefore, the 
antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists or ACE inhibitors may be attenuated by 
NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.
The co-administration of NSAIDs (including COX-2 inhibitors) and angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists or ACE inhibitors exert an additive effect on the increase in serum potassium and may 
result in a deterioration of renal function. These effects are usually reversible. Rarely, acute renal 
failure may occur, especially in patients with compromised renal function (such as the elderly or 
patients who are volume-depleted, including those on diuretic therapy). Therefore, the combination 
should be administered with caution in patients with compromised renal function. Patients should be 
adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of 
concomitant therapy and periodically thereafter.
8
Gold
Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been 
reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant 
ACE inhibitor therapy including enalapril.
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors
Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy may 
be at increased risk for angioedema (see section 4.4).
Neprilysin inhibitors
Patients receiving concomitant ACE inhibitor and neprilysin inhibitor therapy (e.g., sacubitril, 
racecadotril) may be at increased risk for angioedema (see section 4.4). The concomitant use of 
enalapril with sacubitril/valsartan is contraindicated, as the concomitant inhibition of neprilysin and 
ACE may increase the risk of angioedema. Sacubitril/valsartan must not be started until 36 hours after 
taking the last dose of enalapril therapy. Enalapril therapy must not be started until 36 hours after the 
last dose of sacubitril/valsartan (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Sympathomimetics
Sympathomimetics may reduce the antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors.
Antidiabetics
Epidemiological studies have suggested that concomitant administration of ACE inhibitors and 
antidiabetics (insulins, oral hypoglycaemic agents) may cause an increased blood-glucose-lowering 
effect with risk of hypoglycaemia. This phenomenon appeared to be more likely to occur during the 
first weeks of combined treatment and in patients with renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Patients taking concomitant vildagliptin therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (see 
section 4.4).
Alcohol
Alcohol enhances the hypotensive effect of ACE inhibitors.
Acetyl salicylic acid, thrombolytics and β-blockers
Enalapril can be safely administered concomitantly with acetyl salicylic acid (at cardiologic doses), 
thrombolytics and β-blockers.
Ciclosporin
Hyperkalaemia may occur during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors with ciclosporin. Monitoring of 
serum potassium is recommended.
Heparin
Hyperkalaemia may occur during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors with heparin. Monitoring of 
serum potassium is recommended.
9
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
Based on human experience ACE inhibitors including enalapril cause congenital malformations 
(decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation, limb contractures, 
craniofacial deformations and hypoplastic lung development) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, 
hypotension, hyperkalaemia) when administered during pregnancy. 
AQUMELDI is contraindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy and is not 
recommended in the first trimester (see section 4.3 and 4.4). 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 1 week after 
treatment.
Maternal oligohydramnios, presumably representing decreased foetal renal function, has occurred and 
may result in limb contractures, craniofacial deformations and hypoplastic lung development. Should 
exposure to ACE inhibitors have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check 
of renal function and skull is recommended. Infants whose mothers have taken ACE inhibitors should 
be closely observed for hypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Breast-feeding
AQUMELDI and its metabolites are excreted in human milk to such an extent that effects on the 
breastfed newborns/infants cannot be excluded (see section 5.2).
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
AQUMELDI therapy considering the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy 
for the woman.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of enalapril on fertility are available. In rats, there was no effect on 
mating or fertility with enalapril treatment (see section 5.3). 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
AQUMELDI has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness or weariness 
may occur which may affect concentration and co-ordination. This may alter the performance at 
skilled tasks such as driving, riding a bicycle, or using machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of safety profile
The most frequent drug related adverse reactions reported in children were cough (5.7%), 
vomiting (3.1%), microalbuminuria (3.1%), hyperkalaemia (2.9%), hypotension (1.4%), and 
postural dizziness (1.2%). 
Tabulated list of adverse drug reactions
Children
The adverse reaction frequency listed in Table 1 is derived from the clinical studies in children 
receiving AQUMELDI for heart failure. In total 86 children in these studies received enalapril for up 
to 1 year; as such the data are limited. 
10
The adverse reactions are listed below by SOC (system organ class) and by frequency, most frequent 
reactions first, with the following guidelines: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), 
uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000), very rare (<1/10 000), not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are 
presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

* A symptom complex has been reported which may include some or all of the following: fever, serositis, vasculitis, 
myalgia/myositis, arthralgia/arthritis, a positive ANA, elevated ESR, eosinophilia, and leucocytosis. Rash, photosensitivity or 
other dermatologic manifestations may occur. 
Paediatric population
Blood pressure and heart rate
Following the first ingestion of AQUMELDI no changes were reported in blood pressure or heart rate 
in naïve or ACEi pre-treated paediatric heart failure patients during the 8-h observation period. Over 
the first 8 weeks of treatment, mean values of blood pressure did not change over time. The same trend 
was observed for heart rate. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), based on systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, increased in every age group throughout the duration of the subsequent 10-month study 
period except for children aged 6-12 months where it showed a minor decrease.
13
Renal safety parameters
Over the 12-month study period treatment, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), GFR and 
potassium levels were generally within normal range and constant in paediatric patients with heart 
failure. The only difference being in children aged from birth to 3 months where BUN levels were 
significantly higher at the end of the study compared to the start, mean (± standard deviation (SD)) 
4.4 (±1.8) vs 2.8 (±1.4), p=0,0001). In paediatric patients with heart failure, microalbuminuria was 
consistently reported in only one patient with dilated cardiomyopathy from the first study visit. As this 
patient prematurely left the study and was lost to follow-up, only limited data are available. 
Microalbuminuria was incidentally reported in three other cases, but at other visits microalbumin was 
within normal range. For the remaining patients values were similar in all age groups throughout the 
study.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Limited data are available for overdose of enalapril in adults and there is no specific data in children. 
The most prominent features of overdose reported to date are marked hypotension, beginning some six 
hours after ingestion of tablets, concomitant with blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, and 
stupor. Symptoms associated with overdose of ACE inhibitors may include circulatory shock, 
electrolyte disturbances, renal failure, hyperventilation, tachycardia, palpitations, bradycardia, 
dizziness, anxiety, and cough. Serum enalaprilat levels 100- and 200-fold higher than usually seen 
after therapeutic doses have been reported after ingestion of 300 mg and 440 mg of enalapril, 
respectively.
The recommended treatment of overdose is intravenous infusion of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) 
solution for injection. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the shock position. If 
available, treatment with angiotensin II infusion and/or intravenous catecholamines may also be 
considered. If ingestion is recent, take measures aimed at eliminating enalapril maleate (e.g., emesis, 
gastric lavage, administration of absorbents, and sodium sulfate). Enalapril may be removed from the 
general circulation by haemodialysis (see section 4.4). Pacemaker therapy is indicated for therapy-
resistant bradycardia. Vital signs, serum electrolytes and creatinine concentrations should be 
monitored continuously.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, ACE inhibitors, plain, 
ATC code: C09AA02.
Enalapril maleate is the maleate salt of enalapril, a derivative of two amino-acids, L-alanine and L-
proline. 
Mechanism of action
Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
After oral administration in adults, enalapril is hydrolysed via hepatic CES 1 to the active metabolite 
enalaprilat, which acts as an ACE inhibitor. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase which catalyses the 
14
conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II and hence inhibition of 
ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II. This also leads to increased plasma renin activity (due 
to removal of negative feedback of renin release), and decreased aldosterone secretion. The 
mechanism of action of enalapril is therefore primarily via the suppression of the RAAS. However, 
ACE is identical to kininase II, and so enalapril may also exert its effects by blocking the degradation 
of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide. Questions remain regarding the differential effects of 
ACE inhibition on RAA axis depending on the paediatric age range in question.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Exploratory pharmacodynamics for brain natriuretic peptides (Nt-proBNP), shortening fraction and 
RAAS associated with enalapril orodispersible tablets in children with heart failure were studied in 
two clinical studies; 32 children aged 1 month to <12 years with heart failure due to dilated cardio 
myopathy (DCM) (WP08) and 70 children aged birth to 6 years with heart failure due to congenital 
heart disease (CHD) (WP09). Mean age 555 days, mean weight 8.92 kg and height 74.01 cm. 46% 
were females and 54% were males. The data are presented below.
In children with DCM, Nt-proBNP median values (range) did not change from 32 (5 to 1 777) pmol/l 
at the start to 35 (3 to 1 302) pmol/l (p=ns) at the end of the study. Only 10% of patients in this cohort 
were ACEi naïve. In children with CHD, Nt-proBNP levels were lower at the end of the study 
compared to the beginning. The median Nt-proBNP value at the start of the study were 171 (1 to 
2 789) pmol/l and 73 (5 to 2 165) pmol/l (p=ns) at the end. In this cohort 44% of patients were naïve to 
ACEi treatment. 
In patients with DCM, echocardiography (shortening fraction) mean values (±SD)) slightly, but 
significantly increased in all patients from 22.3% (SD 7.3) to 25.1% (SD 7.8) (p < 0.05, t-test) 
reflecting an improvement of the cardiac conditions of the patients in all age groups. In patients with 
CHD, shortening fraction remained almost the same during the study period. Mean values (±SD) at the 
screening and end of study visits were 38.7% (SD 8.6) and 38.5% (SD 6.2) respectively.
In terms of effects on the RAAS, renin, plasma renin activity and angiotensin I, all increased at the end 
of the two studies compared to pre-dose values. Aldosterone concentrations had decreased at 4 hours 
after administration of enalapril orodispersible tablets as well as at the end of the study. The observed 
changes were unlikely to be a consequence of the natural course of disease or maturation-dependent 
changes of the RAAS system. A comparable trend for the 4 parameters of the RAAS system was 
observed in ACEi naïve and ACEi pre-treated cohorts, with the main difference being in the baseline 
pre-dose values. The observed changes in markers of the RAAS during the course of enalapril 
orodispersible tablets treatment lie within the expected pattern of ACE inhibition.
Data on the use of Aqumeldi in children below 1 month of age in the clinical studies is scarce (n=4). 
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption 
Oral enalapril is rapidly absorbed, with peak serum concentrations of enalapril occurring within one 
hour. Based on urinary recovery, the extent of absorption of enalapril from oral enalapril tablet is 
approximately 60%. Enalapril is rapidly and extensively hydrolysed to enalaprilat, a potent 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. 
The absorption of AQUMELDI orodispersible tablets is not expected to be affected by food.
Distribution
As described in the adult population, over the range of concentrations, which are therapeutically 
relevant, enalaprilat binding to human plasma proteins does not exceed 60%. In adults, the apparent 
volume of distribution (V/F) of enalapril from AQUMELDI was 93.15 L (SD 33.23 L).
15
Biotransformation
Except for conversion to enalaprilat, there is no evidence for significant metabolism of enalapril.
Elimination
Excretion of enalaprilat is primarily renal. In adults, after a single oral dose of enalapril (10 mg), 18% 
of the administered dose was found in urine and 6% in faeces as unchanged enalapril compared with 
43% of enalaprilat in urine and 27% in faeces. Elimination kinetics of enalaprilat is biphasic, with an 
initial phase reflecting renal filtration (elimination half-life 2 to 6 hours) and a subsequent prolonged 
phase (terminal elimination half-life 36 hours) which is assumed to represent drug equilibration from 
ACE enzyme binding sites. 
Steady state concentrations of enalaprilat are achieved after 3 or 4 doses of enalapril. The principal 
components in urine are enalaprilat, accounting for about 40% of the dose, and intact enalapril (about 
20%). The elimination half-life for enalapril from AQUMELDI in adults was 0.77 h (SD 0.11 h) and 
oral clearance (CL/F) 87.54 l/h (SD 33.45 l/h). 
Special populations
Renal impairment
The exposure of enalapril and enalaprilat is increased in patients with renal insufficiency. In patients 
with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 40-60 ml/min) steady state AUC of 
enalaprilat was approximately two-fold higher than in patients with normal renal function after 
administration of 5 mg once daily. In severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤30 ml/min), AUC 
was increased approximately 8-fold. The effective half-life of enalaprilat following multiple doses of 
enalapril maleate is prolonged at this level of renal insufficiency and time to steady state is delayed 
(see section 4.2). Enalaprilat may be removed from the general circulation by haemodialysis. The 
dialysis clearance is 62 ml/min. 
Lactation
After a single 20 mg oral dose in five postpartum women the average peak enalapril milk level was 
1.7 µg/l (range 0.54 to 5.9 µg/l) at 4 to 6 hours after the dose. The average peak enalaprilat level was 
1.7 µg/l (range 1.2 to 2.3 µg/l); peaks occurred at various times over the 24 hour period. Using the 
peak milk level data, the estimated maximum intake of an exclusively breastfed infant would be about 
0.16% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose.
A woman who had been taking oral enalapril 10 mg daily for 11 months had peak enalapril milk levels 
of 2 µg/l 4 hours after a dose and peak enalaprilat levels of 0.75 µg/l about 9 hours after the dose. The 
total amount of enalapril and enalaprilat measured in milk during the 24 hour period was 1.44 µg/l and 
0.63 µg/l of milk respectively.
Enalaprilat milk levels were undetectable (<0.2 µg/l) 4 hours after a single dose of enalapril 5 mg in 
one mother and 10 mg in two mothers; enalapril levels were not determined.
Paediatric population
In children with DCM, dose and weight normalised maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) were 
203 ng/ml/mg × kg for enalapril and 155 ng/ml/mg × kg for enalaprilat, with high coefficients of 
variation of 73% for enalapril and 61% for enalaprilat. Maximum plasma concentrations (Tmax) were 
of 1.7 hours for enalapril and 4.6 hours for enalaprilat, after administration of enalapril orodispersible 
tablet (ODT). In children with CHD, dose and weight normalised maximum plasma concentrations 
(Cmax) were 274 ng/ml/mg × kg for enalapril and 178 ng/ml/mg × kg for enalaprilat, with high 
coefficients of variation of 58% for enalapril and 82% for enalaprilat. Maximum plasma 
16
concentrations (Tmax) were of 1.8 hours for enalapril and 6.3 hours for enalaprilat, after administration 
of enalapril ODT.
Data from clinical studies in children with heart failure receiving AQUMELDI allow comparison of 
the pharmacokinetic parameters in children with DCM and CHD in patients aged 1 month to under 
6 years of age (see table below). In this age group, DCM patients showed a 50% lower exposure 
(AUC) to enalapril, compared to CHD patients. The metabolism of the active metabolite enalaprilat, 
however, was the same for both groups. The time to achieve maximal concentrations Tmax of enalapril 
were similar.

The elimination half life (T½) for enalapril from AQUMELDI in children was 1.67 h and for 
enalaprilat was 21.66 h.
Although no published results are available describing the PK of enalapril in children with renal 
impairment, since the drug and its active metabolite are predominantly renally excreted, impaired 
renal function is expected to result in elevated levels of enalapril and enalaprilat. Thus, the dose of 
enalapril should be adjusted accordingly and renal function monitored (see section 4.2).
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. Reproductive toxicity 
studies suggest that enalapril has no effects on fertility and reproductive performance in rats and is not 
teratogenic. In a study in which female rats were dosed prior to mating through gestation, an increased 
incidence of rat pup deaths occurred during lactation. The compound has been shown to cross the 
placenta and is secreted in milk. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, as a class, have been 
shown to be fetotoxic (causing injury and/or death to the foetus) when given in the second or third 
trimester.




Hold the bottle firmly with one hand.
With the other hand: push down firmly whilst twisting the cap anti-clockwise. 
Continue turning until the seal is broken.
Due  to  the  small  size  of  the  orodispersible  tablets,  use  the  scoop  provided  in  the  pack  to  facilitate 
extraction from the bottle. As much as possible, avoid touching the tablets with your hands. 
Administration of doses < 0.25 mg
Where the starting dose is less than 0.25 mg, a lower dose can be achieved by placing one 0.25 mg 
tablet in a 10 ml oral syringe, adding tap water to the 10 ml graduation, rolling the syringe for 
3 minutes to fully disperse the tablet, and administering the required volume to the patient (1 ml will 
contain 0.025 mg enalapril, 4 mL will contain 0.1 mg enalapril). Sterile water should be used in 
children under 6 months. After full dispersion of the orodispersible tablet in the oral syringe, the 
required volume should be used immediately. 
Administration via enteral tube
Some patients may require administration via an enteral feeding tube. AQUMELDI rapidly disperses 
in tap water and can be administered once dispersed. Sterile water should be used in children under 6 
months. AQUMELDI should only be dispersed in water by rolling or mixing for 3 minutes in a 
syringe. A maximum of four orodispersible tablets can be dispersed in 1 ml at any one time. If the 
child is given the medicinal product through a feeding tube, flush the tube with at least 3 ml of water 
after you have given the medicinal product.
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Aqumeldi is and what it is used for
Aqumeldi contains the active substance enalapril maleate. 
It is used in children and adolescents from birth to 17 years to treat heart failure (the inability of the 
heart to pump enough blood around the body). 
Enalapril maleate belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors 
(ACE inhibitors), which means that it blocks an enzyme (protein) in the body from forming the 
hormone angiotensin II. By narrowing blood vessels, angiotensin II can cause high blood pressure 
which forces the heart to work harder to pump blood around the body. Angiotensin II also releases 
hormones, such as aldosterone, that raise blood pressure by causing fluid retention.
By blocking the formation of angiotensin II, Aqumeldi modifies the hormone system which influences 
blood pressure and fluid balance within the body. This helps to lower blood pressure and increases the 
supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. The medicine usually starts to work within an hour, but 
several weeks of treatment may be required before the condition improves.
2. What you need to know before you or your child uses Aqumeldi
Do not give Aqumeldi if you or your child
•
is allergic to enalapril maleate, any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
or other ACE inhibitors (such as captopril, lisinopril or ramipril). ACE inhibitors are used to 
treat high blood pressure or heart failure).
has ever had a reaction called angioedema (rapid swelling under the skin in areas such as the 
face, throat, arms and legs, which can be life threatening if throat swelling blocks the airway) 
when taking another ACE inhibitor or when the cause for angioedema was not-known or it was 
inherited.
is more than 3 months pregnant. It is also better to avoid Aqumeldi in early pregnancy – (see 
section 2 “Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility”).
•

•
•
has diabetes or reduced kidney function and is treated with a blood pressure lowering medicine 
containing aliskiren (see section 2 “Other medicines and Aqumeldi”).
has taken or is currently taking sacubitril / valsartan, a medicine used to treat a type of long-term 
(chronic) heart failure, as the risk of angioedema is increased. Wait at least 36 hours after last 
dose of sacubitril / valsartan before taking Aqumeldi.
has severe kidney disease.
If you are not sure, talk to your or your child’s doctor or pharmacist before giving Aqumeldi.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to the doctor before giving Aqumeldi if you or your child:
•
has a heart problem called left ventricular valvular obstruction or outflow tract obstruction or 
cardiogenic shock. 
has a condition involving the blood vessels in the brain (e.g., stenosis, thrombosis, embolism, 
haemorrhage).
has collagen vascular disease (conditions that cause long-lasting inflammation in connective 
tissues which are tissues that hold your bones, muscles and ligaments together). 
is taking immunosuppressant therapy (used to lower the body’s immune response), treatment 
with allopurinol (used to lower uric acid levels) or procainamide (used to treat rhythm 
disturbances of the heart). In these instances, enalapril can increase the risk of low levels of 
neutrophils (neutropenia) a type of white blood cell that fights infection, very low levels of a 
type of white blood cell called granulocytes (agranulocytosis) which are important for fighting 
off infection, low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) which can lead to bleeding and 
bruising and low levels of red blood cells (anaemia) which can cause tiredness and pale skin 
(see section 2 “Other medicines and Aqumeldi”).
has ever had an allergic reaction to ACE inhibitors, with swelling of the face, lips, tongue or 
throat with difficulty in swallowing or breathing (angioedema).  Angioedema can occur at any 
point during treatment with Aqumeldi. If symptoms appear Aqumeldi should be stopped and 
immediate treatment sought. You should be aware that black patients are at increased risk of 
these types of reactions to ACE inhibitors (medicines that work like Aqumeldi).  The risk of 
angioedema may be increased in patients taking other medicines (see section 2 “Other 
medicines and Aqumeldi”).
has a kidney problem (including kidney transplantation) diabetes, dehydration, sudden 
worsening of heart failure, a build up of acid in the body or use of diuretics (water tablets) 
which maintain the amount of potassium in the blood (such as spironolactone, eplerenone, 
triamterene, or amiloride) or substitutes that contain potassium or medicines known to increase 
potassium in the blood  (such as, heparin, trimethoprim or cotrimoxazole). These situations may 
lead to high blood potassium levels (hyperkalaemia) which can cause tiredness, muscle 
weakness, feeling sick and heart rhythm disturbances. Your or your child’s doctor may need to 
adjust the dose of Aqumeldi or regularly check the amount of potassium in the blood (see 
section 2 “Other medicines and Aqumeldi”). 
has a problem with the arteries of the kidney, as this can increase the risk of low blood pressure 
or the kidneys not working properly.
has been very sick (excessive vomiting) or had bad diarrhoea recently.
has diabetes. The blood should be checked for low blood glucose levels, especially during the 
first month of treatment. The amount of potassium in the blood can also be higher.
is having dialysis, since the dose of Aqumeldi may need changing.
has low blood pressure (may be noticed as faintness or dizziness, especially when standing).
is taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: an angiotensin II 
receptor blocker (ARBs) (also known as sartans - for example valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan) 
as these can increase the risk of low blood pressure, high potassium in the blood and kidney 
problems (see section 2 “Other medicines and Aqumeldi”).

Your doctor may check your or your child’s kidney function, blood pressure, and the level of 
electrolytes (e.g., potassium) in the blood regularly.

Aqumeldi with food, drink and alcohol
You or your child should not drink alcohol while taking Aqumeldi. Alcohol may cause blood pressure 
to drop too much and you or your child may experience dizziness, light-headedness or faintness.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
You must tell your doctor if you think you or your child are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor 
will normally advise to stop taking Aqumeldi before becoming pregnant or as soon as knowing about 
the pregnancy and will advise to take another medicine instead of Aqumeldi.
Aqumeldi is not recommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken when more than 3 months 
pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to the baby if used after the third month of pregnancy (see 
section 2 “Do not give Aqumeldi if you or your child”).
If you are a female of childbearing potential, you must use effective contraception during and up to 
1 week after treatment. 
Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding and discuss whether to stop 
breast-feeding or stop taking Aqumeldi treatment. 
Driving and using machines
Aqumeldi may make you or your child sleepy or affect concentration and co-ordination. This may 
affect performance at skilled tasks such as driving, riding a bicycle, or using machines. 
Aqumeldi contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.
3.
How to use Aqumeldi
Always use this medicine exactly as your or your child’s doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check 
with the doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

weight and how they respond to treatment.


levels of potassium in the blood and kidney function.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
Please read carefully before using the orodispersible tablet(s).
Aqumeldi should only be taken by mouth. It is an orodispersible tablet, which means it dissolves in the 
mouth or in water. The tablet can be taken with or without meals.
1.
2.
Due to the small size of the tablets, use the scoop provided in the pack to collect the required 
number of orodispersible tablets from the bottle. As much as possible, avoid touching the tablets 
with your hands.
Place the orodispersible tablet(s) on the tongue, or into the space between the gum and the 
cheek (buccal cavity) and allow to disperse. 
32
3.
Do not crush the orodispersible tablets. 
If the dose prescribed by the doctor is less than 0.25 mg, it can be achieved as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
Place one 0.25 mg orodispersible tablet to be dispersed in a 10 ml oral syringe.
Draw up 10 ml of fresh tap water into the syringe (up to the 10 ml graduation mark). Sterile 
water should be used in children under 6 months of age.
Carefully roll the syringe for 3 minutes until the orodispersible tablet is fully dispersed.
This results in a concentration of 0.025 mg/ml enalapril maleate.
1 ml of the resulting solution will contain 0.025 mg enalapril, 4 ml will contain 0.1 mg 
enalapril.
The required volume of dispersion should then be administered immediately to the patient; do 
not store the dispersion in the oral syringe.
If you or your child is given the medicine through a feeding tube, the following procedure should be 
followed:
1.
Remove the plunger from the syringe you use with the feeding tube (syringe not provided) and 
place the required number of orodispersible tablets in the barrel of the syringe. 
Note: a maximum of four orodispersible tablets can be dispersed in 1 ml at any one time, the 
following procedure may need to be repeated to achieve the recommended dose.
2.
Replace the plunger and draw up 1 ml of fresh tap water. Sterile water should be used in 
children under 6 months of age.
3.
Cap the syringe and carefully roll or mix for 3 minutes for the orodispersible tablets to disperse.
4.
Remove the cap and give the dose via the feeding tube.
5.
Flush the feeding tube with at least 3 ml of water after giving the medicine.
The solution should be given immediately to you or your child. Do not store.
33
Standard feeding tubes (polyurethane, polyvinylchloride and silicone) have been found to be suitable 
to use with this medicine.
If you or your child takes more Aqumeldi than they should
Do not give more medicine than your or your child’s doctor tells you to. If you or your child has 
swallowed more tablets than the doctor has prescribed, contact your nearest hospital casualty 
department or doctor immediately. Take the medicine pack with you.
The most common signs and symptoms of overdose are fall in blood pressure (signs may include 
dizziness or light-headedness) and a state of almost complete lack of consciousness (stupor). Other 
symptoms may include forceful and rapid heartbeat, rapid pulse, anxiety, cough, kidney failure and 
rapid breathing. 
If you or your child forgets to take Aqumeldi
If you or your child forgets to take Aqumeldi, skip the missed dose.
Take the next dose as usual.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you or your child stops taking Aqumeldi
Do not stop giving Aqumeldi unless your or your child’s doctor tells you to.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your or your child’s doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse.

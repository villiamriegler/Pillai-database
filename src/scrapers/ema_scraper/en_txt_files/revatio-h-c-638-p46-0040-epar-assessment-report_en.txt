EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This is an assessment of data pertaining to Revatio (sildenafil) in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation 
(EC) No 1901/2006. The Market Authorisation Holder (MAH) is submitting a clinical study report (CSR) 
A1481276,  a  single-arm  study  to  investigate  safety  and  efficacy  of  sildenafil  in  near-term  and  term 
newborns with Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN). 
This  study  was  discontinued  after  enrolling  only  4  patients  (due  to  recruitment  difficulties).  The  MAH 
does not consider that the results influence the benefit/risk of Revatio, and does not propose any labeling 
changes.  
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
REVATIO (sildenafil citrate) was approved for the treatment of PAH through the centralised procedure in 
2005. In the adult population, the approved dosage regimen is one 20-mg tablet administered 3 times daily 
(TID). 
Revatio was approved in Europe in May 2011 for paediatric PAH (EMEA/H/C/638/II/028). In paediatric 
patients (1 year to 17 years), the recommended dose in patients ≤ 20 kg is 10 mg TID and for patients > 20 
kg is 20 mg TID. Higher than recommended doses should not be used in paediatric patients with PAH.  
Pfizer  updated  the  SmPC  in  Europe  in  September  2011  to  include  mortality  data  from  the  long-term 
extension study A1481156, to reinforce the dosing recommendations for this population, and to introduce 
a warning that higher than recommended doses should not be used in paediatric patients with PAH.  
Sildenafil for the treatment of PAH is available orally as film-coated tablets containing sildenafil citrate 
equivalent  to  20  mg  of  sildenafil  and  a  10  mg/mL  powder  for  oral  suspension  (approved  in  the  EU  in 
March 2012).  
The intravenous formulation is available as a solution for injection, 0.8 mg of sildenafil per ml of solution. 
The recommended dose for the treatment of PAH is 10 mg (corresponding to 12.5 ml) three times a day 
administered as an intravenous bolus injection.

Study A1481276, which is the subject of the report, is a study in paediatric patients diagnosed with PPHN 
that  was  originally  included  in  the  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP)  decision  P/244/2009  dated  2 
December  2009.  The  study  was  halted  prematurely  after  recruitment  of  4  patients  in  June  2012  with 
agreement  from  the  EMA Paediatric  Committee  (PDCO),  as  there  had  been poor  enrollment and it  was 
discontinued for feasibility reasons. The extension study A1481283 is ongoing to ensure follow up of one 
eligible patient from Study 1481276. 
The PIP for Revatio has now been modified to remove study A1481276 and includes an alternative PPHN 
study (Study A1481316) at the request of PDCO, and this is included in the PDCO decision P/0158/2012, 
dated 25 July 2012. The PIP now includes 2 studies in PPHN, namely, A1481157, which has completed, 
and Study A1481316, which is due to start in 4Q 2012/1Q 2013. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All  PPHN  studies  employed  the  IV  solution  for  injection,  being  a  suitable  formulation  for  use  in  these 
patients. The variation application consisting of the full relevant data package (containing all the PPHN 
studies, ie, studies A1481157, A1481276, A1481283 and A1481316) is expected to be submitted.  
Clinical Studies in Paediatric PAH 
These include studies: A1481131, -56 and -34, which formed the basis of the paediatric indication granted 
in 2011 and are not discussed further in this report. Study A1481298 for paediatric patients with PAH, has 
just started in Japan, though no patients have been recruited.

Safety 
Study A1481276 
This phase 2 study was a single-arm, single-centre study to investigate safety and efficacy of sildenafil in 
near-term  and  term  newborns  with  PPHN.  The  planned  study  subjects  were  neonates  (≥34  week 
gestational age and aged ≤ 72 hours) who had PPHN. 
Study Objectives 
Efficacy: The primary objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of IV sildenafil in near term 
and  term  newborns  with  PPHN  or  with  hypoxic  respiratory  failure  and  at  risk  for  PPHN.  The  primary 
measure of efficacy was the reduced need for iNO and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). 
Safety: To assess the safety and tolerability of IV sildenafil in the before-mentioned population.  
Pharmacokinetics (PK): To further characterize the PK of sildenafil in this population. 
Long-term survival: Patients who completed Study A1481276 were to be enrolled in a long term follow-
study, A1481283. 
Study Design 
This was a non-randomized, single arm, single center, open label study in male and female neonates (≥34 
week gestational age and aged ≤ 72 hours). All subjects had to receive sildenafil. Forty subjects who were 
naïve to iNO were planned to be enrolled in the study. The subjects were identified and screened within 72 
hours of birth.  
Dose. Subjects who were eligible at screening received a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg of IV sildenafil citrate 
given over 30 minutes, followed by a continuous maintenance dose consisting of an IV infusion of 0.03 
mg/kg/hr  for  up  to  14  days.  There  were  2  follow-up  visits  at  7±3  days  and  28±3  days  post  end  of 
treatment. 
The  outcomes  of  a  control  group  of  PPHN  patients  (who  were  not  study  subjects)  identified  from  the 
Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) database were to be analyzed in conjunction with the subjects in 
this study. Long term safety and neurological development of subjects were to be assessed during regular 
paediatric check up appointments at GOSH at 12 and 24 months after the end of study treatment. This is 
covered by a separate protocol, A1481283. 
Inclusion Criteria. Subjects aged ≥34 week gestational age and aged ≤ 72 hours at screening with PPHN 
or hypoxic respiratory failure associated with either idiopathic PPHN or meconium aspiration syndrome 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or sepsis or pneumonia; OI >15 and <60 (calculated using blood gases taken approximately 30 minutes 
apart  prior  to  commencement  of  study  treatment  infusion);  and  screening  echocardiogram  to  confirm 
presence of pulmonary hypertension (performed within 24 hours of admission to GOSH) were eligible to 
participate in this study.  
Exclusion criteria were subjects already receiving iNO on referral; who had prior or immediate need for 
full cardiopulmonary resuscitation or ECMO, life-threatening or lethal congenital anomaly; large left-to-
right intracardiac or ductal shunting (diagnosed from echocardiogram on admission to GOSH); clinically 
significant active seizures; bleeding concurrent medication/therapy at any time prior to screening. 
Incidence of treatment failure was the primary efficacy endpoint, which was defined as the incidence of 
iNO or ECMO at any point from initiation of sildenafil to Day 14 visit. 
Safety data including AEs, laboratory tests and vital signs, were to be evaluated using descriptive statistics 
and presented using the Safety Analysis Set (defined as all subjects enrolled in the study). 
Results 
Subject Disposition. A total of 4 subjects were enrolled, assigned to the study treatment and analyzed for 
safety (AEs). Of these, 1 subject completed the study without the need for iNO or ECMO; and 3 subjects 
discontinued  the  study  during  the  maintenance  period.  One  subject  discontinued  due  to  AE  of  reduced 
cardiac  function,  one  subject  died  due  to  PPHN  and  congenital  pneumonia,  and  one  subject  was 
withdrawn as the subject did not meet entrance criteria. 
No Efficacy Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic are available due to early termination. 
Safety Results. All subjects in the study had 1 or more AE. Overall, 19 TEAEs and 12 non-TEAEs were 
reported  during  the  study. The  most frequently  reported TEAEs  were  from  the  respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders, system organ class (6 TEAEs in 3 subjects). The majority of TEAEs were mild (8 
TEAEs) or moderate (6 TEAEs) in severity. Two (2) subjects reported 3 SAEs: bradycardia (one subject), 
persistent  fetal  circulation  and  congenital  pneumonia  (one  subject).  All  SAEs  were  considered  as  not 
related to the study treatment by the investigator. One (1) subject (died due to 2 fatal SAEs: persistent fetal 
circulation  and  congenital  pneumonia.  Two  subjects  permanently  discontinued  the  study:  one  subject 
discontinued due to AE of cardiac disorder, which was considered as not related to the study treatment; 
and one subject discontinued due to death (SAE). 
Applicant's Conclusion  
Due to evolved standard of care and widespread use of iNO at early signs of hypoxic respiratory failure or 
PPHN, the clinical relevance of study A1481276 came into question. Dialogue with PDCO of the EMA 
led to terminating the study prematurely. Only 4 subjects were enrolled and had received study treatment 
at the time of termination of study. The salient findings from the 4 subjects enrolled in this prematurely 
terminated study are: 
•  One subject completed the study without the need for iNO; 3 subjects discontinued from the study. 
•  The 4 subjects experienced 19 TEAEs and 12 non-TEAEs; majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate 
in severity. 
•  Two subjects experienced 3 SAEs: bradycardia in 1 subject; persistent fetal circulation and congenital 
pneumonia in other subject. 
•  One subject died due to 2 fatal SAEs: persistent fetal circulation and congenital pneumonia. 
•  One  subject  permanently  discontinued  the  study  due  to  an  AE,  cardiac  disorder,  which  was 
considered as not related to the study treatment. 
Intravenous sildenafil has the potential to be of value when administered to paediatric patients who have 
been  diagnosed  with  PPHN.  This  is  currently  being  investigated  in  Study  A1481316.  Results  from  the 
PPHN  studies  A1481157,  A1481276,  A1481283,  and  A1481316  will  be  submitted  in  a  variation  to 
include the results of these studies in the SmPC. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
V. CHMP OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION  
Revatio is approved for paediatric PAH since 2011. The current report concerns the premature termination 
of study A1481276 conducted in patients with PPHN. This study was part of the agreed PIP. The study 
was terminated due to slow recruitment considering that PPHN patients are more early administered iNO 
than  before,  making  recruitment  of  iNO  naïve  patients  difficult.  This  is  also  in  line  with  the  paediatric 
addendum  to  CHMP  guideline  on  the  clinical  investigations  of  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of 
pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  EMA/CHMP/213972/2010  which  states  that  as  nitric  oxide  (NO)  is  an 
authorized therapy for PPHN mainly add-on trials or trials in patients failing treatment with NO should be 
considered. 
Available  data  from  the  study  are  too  limited  and  do  not  allow  any  assessment  of  the  potential  use  of 
Revatio IV in this indication. 
The results of study A1481316 are awaited. 
Based on the above, no update of the SmPC is considered necessary. 
The  premature  termination  of  study  A1481276    conducted  in  patients  with  near-term  and  term  children 
with  PPHN  is  acceptable  within  the  context  of  current  use  of  NO  and  does  not  influence  the  current 
benefit/risk of Revatio. No update of the SmPC is needed.  
Further results from other studies in PPHN are awaited as follows.  
According to the MAH, results from the PPHN studies A1481157, A1481276, A1481283, and A1481316 
will be submitted which will allow further assessment of the use of Revatio in PPHN patients.

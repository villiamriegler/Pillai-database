1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Pierre Fabre Medicament submitted on 28 July 2017 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Mektovi, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 21 July 2016. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Binimetinib in combination with encorafenib is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF 
V600 mutation (see section 4.4). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
This application is submitted, in accordance with Article 82.1 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as a 
multiple of Balimek (EMEA/H/C/004052), which at the time of filing of this application was under initial 
assessment. 
Of note, the application for Balimek (EMEA/H/C/004052) was withdrawn by the applicant on 4 
January 2018. As a consequence, the present application does not fall under Article 82.1 of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 anymore. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P0051/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and CW/1/2011 on the granting 
of a class waiver.  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P0051/2016 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request(s) for consideration

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cutaneous  melanoma,  which  arises  from  the  oncogenic  transformation  of  melanocytes  that  reside  in 
the  epidermal  layer  of  the  skin,  is  the  most  lethal  form  of  skin  cancer,  due  to  its  propensity  to 
metastasise  to  vital  organs,  including  the  brain,  lungs,  liver  and  other  visceral  organs1.  Malignant 
melanoma  is  the  19th  most  common  cancer  worldwide,  with  around  232,000  new  cases  (2%  of  the 
total)  diagnosed  in  20122,3.  Malignant  melanoma  is  the  ninth  most  common  cancer  in  Europe,  with 
123,135  new  cases  (3%  of  the  total)  diagnosed  in  2012.  The  European  incidence  of  malignant 
melanoma varies from 3 to 5/100 000/year in Mediterranean countries to 12–25 (and rising) in Nordic 
countries. The most common phenotypic risk factor for developing cutaneous melanoma is having fair 
skin that tends to burn in the sun. Genetic risk factors also include inheriting melanocortin-1 receptor 
variant  as  well  as  the  presence  of  high  numbers  of  common  naevi  and  those  with  large  congenital 
naevi,  multiple  and/or  atypical  naevi  (dysplastic  naevi)  are  at  a  greater  risk  to  developing  cutaneous 
melanoma. The most important external risk factor is prolonged exposure to UV irradiation, particularly 
intermittent sun exposure. 
2.1.2.  Biologic features 
There  are  four  main  subtypes  of  cutaneous  melanomas:  superficial  spreading  melanoma,  nodular 
melanoma,  lentigo  maligna  melanoma,  acral  lentiginous  melanoma.  These  can  be  clinically  and 
histologically defined based on overall appearance, location and histologic features of the melanocytes. 
Approximately  50%  of  patients  with  metastatic  melanoma  have  mutations  in BRAF,  and  over  95%  of 
these  are  in  BRAF  exon  15  at  V600.  The  most  common  V600  mutations  are  V600E  and  V600K 
accounting for 66-91% and 7-30% of all BRAF V600 mutations, respectively4,5,6,7,8. These mutations 
constitutively activate BRAF protein and downstream signal transduction in the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway 
(MAPK pathway), which signals for cancer cell proliferation and survival. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Over  90% of  melanomas are  diagnosed  as primary tumours  without  any  evidence  of  metastasis.  The 
tumour-specific  10-year  survival  for  such  tumours  is  75%-85%,  with  10–20%  of  cases  becoming 
metastatic and eventually fatal9, . However, the survival rate of unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
decreases  sharply;  the  5-year  survival  rate  is  17%  and,  if  left  untreated,  the  median  survival  is  6-9

months.  The  clinical  presentation  of  cutaneous  melanoma  varies  depending  on  the  subtype  but  the 
typical  features  relate  to  asymmetry  of  the  lesion,  irregular  borders,  colour  and  diameter  of  the 
lesions.  The  most  important  prognostic  factors  in  metastatic  melanoma  are  the  site(s)  of  metastases 
(presence  of  visceral  metastases)  and  the  presence  of  elevated  serum  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH). 
Prognosis  is  particularly  poor  in  patients  with  American  Joint  Committee  on  Cancer  (AJCC)  stage  IV 
M1c melanoma, defined as disease that has metastasised to visceral organs (other than the lungs) and 
LDH is normal or with elevated LDH and any distant metastases, with an estimated 1-year survival rate 
of 33%10.

AJCC staging of melanoma (7th edition) 
2.1.4.  Management 
The  current  treatment  options  for  metastatic  melanoma  include  2  classes  of  agents,  immune 
checkpoint  inhibitors  and  kinase  inhibitors  targeting  the  MAPK  pathway  in  patients  with  BRAF 
mutations.  BRAF  and  its  downstream  target,  MEK,  are  kinases  in  the  MAPK  pathway,  and  play  an 
important  role  in  cell  proliferation11.  These  new  therapies  have  been  shown  to  prolong  survival  in

(PFS) to approximately 12 months and the median overall survival (OS) to 22-26 months in metastatic 
melanoma with a BRAF mutation,. 
Vemurafenib  single-agent  was  the  first  BRAF  inhibitor  to  be  approved  for  patients  with  advanced 
unresectable or metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma, followed by dabrafenib single-agent. In the pivotal 
Phase  3  studies,    the  median  PFS  was  5.3  months  with  vemurafenib  and  1.6  months  with 
dacarbazine18  while median PFS was 5.1 months for dabrafenib and 2.7 months for dacarbazine19. The 
duration  of  response  (DOR)  for  single  agent  BRAF  inhibition  is  often  short  lived,  with  resistance 
developing  within  approximately  6  months,  20,  .  To  delay  resistance  to  BRAF  inhibition,  the 
combination  of  BRAF-  and  a  MEK1/2-inhibitors  showed  prolonged  durationof  the  response  in  patients 
with  advanced  BRAF-mutant  melanoma21,  22,  .  In  addition,  the  combination  of  a  MEK  inhibitor  and  a 
BRAF inhibitor appears to result in improved tolerability compared with either agent alone, , , , . Based 
on  these  data,  the  BRAF/MEK  inhibitors  have  been  the  standard  of  care  for  patients  with  previously 
untreated  unresectable  or  metastatic  BRAF  V600E  or  V600K  mutation-positive  melanoma.  Recent 
European  consensus-based  interdisciplinary  guidelines  recommend  the  use  of  the  BRAF/MEK  inhibitor 
combinations  dabrafenib/trametinib  or  vemurafenib/cobimetinib  for  the  treatment  of  BRAF-mutated 
unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma  patients,  where  targeted  therapy  is  indicated  and  the 
combination  has  overtaken  BRAF  monotherapies  (e.g.  vemurafenib  monotherapy)  as  the  current 
standard of care. 
About the product 
Binimetinib  is  an  ATP-uncompetitive,  reversible  inhibitor  of  the  kinase  activity  of  mitogen-activated 
extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. In cell free system, binimetinib inhibits MEK1 
and  MEK2  with  the  half  maximal  inhibitory  concentration  (IC50)’s  in  the  12-46 nM.  MEK  proteins  are 
upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway, which promotes cellular 
proliferation.  In  melanoma  and  other  cancers,  this  pathway  is  often  activated  by  mutated  forms  of 
BRAF  which  activates  MEK.  Binimetinib  inhibits  activation  of  MEK  by  BRAF  and  inhibits  MEK  kinase

activity. Binimetinib inhibits growth of BRAF V600 mutant melanoma cell lines and demonstrates anti-
tumour effects in BRAF V600 mutant melanoma animal models.  
Combination with encorafenib 
Binimetinib  and  encorafenib  (a  BRAF  inhibitor,  see  section  5.1  of  encorafenib  SmPC)  both  inhibit  the 
MAPK pathway resulting in  higher anti-tumour activity.   
Additionally,  the  combination  of  encorafenib  and  binimetinib  prevented  the  emergence  of  treatment 
resistance in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in vivo. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“Binimetinib  is  indicated  for  use  in  combination  with  encorafenib  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients 
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, with BRAF V600 mutation.” 
The agreed final indication is as follows: 
“Binimetinib in combination with encorafenib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).” 
Binimetinib  will  be  supplied  as  15 mg  film-coated  tablets  for  oral  administration.  Each  film-coated 
tablet  contains  15 mg  of  binimetinib.  Each  film  coated  tablet  contains  133.5  mg  of  lactose 
monohydrate. 
The recommended dose of binimetinib is 45 mg (three 15 mg tablets) twice daily, corresponding to a 
total daily dose of 90 mg approximately 12 hours apart. 
Binimetinib treatment in combination with encorafenib should be initiated and supervised under the 
responsibility of a physician experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products. 
Method of administration  
Mektovi is for oral use. 
The tablets are to be swallowed whole with water. They may be taken with or without food. In case of 
vomiting after administration of binimetinib, the patient should not re-take the dose and should take 
the next scheduled dose. 
Duration of treatment 
Treatment should continue until the patient no longer derives benefit or the development of 
unacceptable toxicity. 
Missed doses 
If a dose of binimetinib is missed, it should not be taken if it is less than 6 hours until the next dose is 
due. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Scientific advice was given by 2 national European (EU) Agencies (Medical Products Agency [MPA] and 
Medicines  Evaluation  Board  [MEB])  on  the  design  of  the  pivotal  Phase  3  study  CMEK162B2301, 
intended to establish the safety and efficacy of binimetinib 45 mg BID in combination with encorafenib 
450 mg QD vs vemurafenib 960 mg BID and encorafenib 300 mg QD monotherapies in patients with 
unresectable  or  metastatic  BRAF  V600-mutant  melanoma.  The  choice  of  PFS  as  primary  endpoint  for

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Mektovi is an immediate release film-coated tablet for oral administration. The tablet is ovaloid 
biconvex (capsule shaped), yellow to dark yellow in colour, and debossed with a stylized “A” on one 
side and “15” on the other. The length of the film-coated tablet is approximately 12 mm. The width of 
the film-coated tablet is approximately 5 mm.  
Mektovi is an immediate release film-coated tablet for oral administration. The development of the 
formulation and manufacturing process were conducted following a traditional empirical pharmaceutical 
development approach that targeted an immediate release oral product with complete disintegration 
and rapid dissolution in the stomach that would achieve acceptable bioavailability and would allow for 
room temperature storage. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The dissolution specification has been set according the clinical batches used which dissolution profiles 
have been presented. No overages are used in the manufacture of the finished product. 
The  primary  packaging  is  PVC/PVDC/Alu  blister.  The  materials  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of blending, milling, compression, film-coating and packaging. The 
content of active substance exceeds 2% of the finished dosage form; hence, the process is considered 
to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Formal process validation studies for batches manufactured at the proposed commercial scale have 
been presented. The bulk holding time is justified based on the stability data provided. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The IPCs are adequate for this pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  shown  in  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage 
form:  appearance,  identification  (thin  layer  chromatography  (TLC)  and  High  performance  liquid 
chromatography  (HPLC))  assay  and  related  products  (UHPLC/UV),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  by 
content uniformity (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC), water content (KF) and microbiological examination.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standard used for 
assay has been presented, as discussed in the active substance section. 
Batch analysis results were provided for commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

Stability of the product 
Stability data from batches of finished productstored under long term conditions andunder accelerated 
conditions according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Mektovi are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay  and  related  products,  dissolution,  water  content  and 
microbial  enumeration.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  No  significant  changes 
or trends were observed under any of the storage conditions. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Data presented for tablet appearance, assay, individual and total 
unspecified degradation products and dissolution show no changes following exposure.  
Data  to  demonstrate  stability  to  temperature  excursions  which  could  be  encountered  during  shipping 
or  storage,  i.e.  refrigerated,  frozen  and  exposed  to  cycles  of  freeze  /  thaw  conditions  were  also 
presented. The data indicate no adverse impact on product quality from such temperature excursions. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without special temperature 
storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
All constituent parts of the formulation are of non-biological/chemical origin, with the exception of 
lactose monohydrate for which a suitable TSE declaration has been provided.  It is confirmed that the 
lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used to collect milk 
for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant material 
other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting 
Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pharmacology studies were performed for the binimetinib alone as well as the combination of 
encorafenib with binimetinib in both in vitro (isolated enzyme and cell culture) and in vivo (mouse 
xenograft) model systems. Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in mice, rats and monkeys with 
binimetinib administered either orally or/and intravenously. No PK, ADME or toxicology studies have 
been performed with the combination. The safety pharmacology and toxicology studies were performed 
in accordance with GLP (unless otherwise indicated). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The activity of binimetinib against purified MEK1 has been evaluated using standard screening assays. 
Measurements of the IC50 for binimetinib at a concentration of ATP at/near its Km(app) (10 μM) 
yielded an average value of 12.1 ± 5.6 nM (n=4). Results of the enzymatic studies revealed that 
binimetinib is a weakly time-dependent, slowly reversible, allosteric inhibitor of MEK that displays 
uncompetitive inhibition versus ATP and non-competitive inhibition versus the substrate ERK2. 
Viability and p-ERK Inhibition by binimetinib in B-Raf-Mutant Human Melanoma Cell Lines 
In viability assays, binimetinib was most potent in A375 and UACC-62 cell lines (Table 2) and less 
sensitive in cell lines IGR-39, MDA-MB435S and RPMI-7051, both by relatively high IC50 values and by 
low maximal inhibition of about 50%. IGR-1, WM-115 and Colo-800 lines showed medium sensitivity in 
this panel. Cell lines of variable sensitivity (UACC-62, WM- 115 and Colo-800) showed signs of cell 
death after treatment with MEK162. 
Table 2: 
Effect of binimetinib Single Agent on p-ERK in B-Raf-Mutant Melanoma 
Cell Lines 
B-Raf mutant melanoma cells were seeded at 15,000 cells per well in triplicate black 96-well plates and 
treated for 24 h with MEK162. A p-Erk in-cell Western assay was performed and maximal inhibition, 
relative and absolute IC50 values calculated using Excel Fit software. 
Nude Mouse, HT-29 Xenograft 
The effects of binimetinib on ERK phosphorylation in HT-29 human colorectal carcinoma xenograft 
tumours were evaluated in nude mice (Study 060304-800). Mice were implanted with tumour cells (5 x 
3
106 cells, subcutaneous [SC] and the tumours were allowed to grow to 300 mm
single dose of vehicle or binimetinib (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg, PO) and were sacrificed at 2, 4, 12 and 24 
hours post-dose. 
. Animals received a

Target inhibition of nearly 100% was achieved at all doses of binimetinib, and 50% inhibition was 
maintained at 24 hours following a single dose of either 10 or 30 mg/kg binimetinib, which supports 
BID dosing to achieve maximum target inhibition in the mouse tumour models.

Nude Mouse, A375 B-Raf-Mutant Melanoma Xenograft (High Dose Ranging) 
The effects binimetinib on A375 human B-Raf-mutant melanoma tumour growth in nude mice were 
evaluated (Study RD-2010-00964). Mice were implanted with tumour fragments, and the tumours 
were allowed to grow to 100–150 mm
. Animals received vehicle or binimetinib (30 or100 mg/kg, PO, 
3
BID for 14 days; or 300 mg/kg, PO BID for 3 days, weekly x 2). At the end of the treatment period, 
tumour growth delay for each drug treated group was assessed in comparison to the vehicle treated 
control group. The current summary limits itself to a description of the efficacy and tolerability after 14 
days of treatment. 
Oral administration of MEK162 at 30 and 100 mg/kg, BID produced tumour regression (T/C% = - 11 
and -20%, respectively). In contrast, MEK162 administered at 300 mg/kg BID intermittently only 
caused tumour growth delay which was not statistically different from the control group (Figure 3). 
MEK162 treatment at all doses was well tolerated with minimal body weight loss and no treatment 
related deaths.

Summary of Synergy Evaluations for MEK162 with LGX818 
Nude Mouse, HMEX1906 (BRAFV600E) Mutant Human Melanoma Primary Xenograft 
This study was designed to evaluate whether combining binimetinib and encorafenib would prevent the 
emergence of resistance in the HMEX1906 (BRAFV600E) PDX model. MEK162 was evaluated at two 
doses that approximate the clinically-relevant doses, and LGX818 was evaluated at a dose that was 
anticipated to result in resistance within 1 to 2 months. There were 6 treatment groups: vehicle (1% 
CMC/0.5 % Tween 80 in water), binimetinib (MEK162; 3 or 10 mg/kg, PO, BID), encorafenib (LGX818; 
3 mg/kg, PO, BID) and 2 combination treatment groups with binimetinib (MEK162, 3 or 10 mg/kg, PO, 
BID) plus encorafenib (LGX818; 3 mg/kg, PO, BID).

days, 92 days and 117 days, respectively. Median survival was not reached for the 3 mg/kg 
encorafenib and both combination groups. There was also a significant increase in survival for the 10 
mg/kg binimetinib + 3 mg/kg encorafenib combination group compared to each single agent treatment 
group, however there was no significant difference between the 3 mg/kg binimetinib + 3 mg/kg

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Binimetinib was tested against a panel of 219 kinases. Other than MEK1, 1 μM binimetinib did not 
inhibit any of the other kinases by more than 30%. With 10 μM binimetinib, only calcium/calmodulin 
kinase IV (31%), Fer (fps/fes related) tyrosine kinase (phosphoprotein NCP94) (38%) and MEK1 
(92%) were inhibited by more than 30%.

Whole body autoradiography 
A tissue distribution study was performed for drug-derived carbon-14 material using quantitative whole 
body autoradiography (DM07-001) following a single oral dose of [14C]binimetinib (30 mg/kg) to 
fasted male albino (Sprague-Dawley) and pigmented (Long- Evans) rats. Drug-derived radioactivity 
was absorbed and widely distributed to tissues of albino and pigmented rats, with maximum 
concentrations in most tissues observed 1 to 2 hours post-dose.

An in vitro study subsequently confirmed that MEK162 and the active N-desmethyl (M3) metabolite 
both have low affinity to melanin (Report DMPK R1100541). There was no evidence of CNS penetration 
(i.e., all measurements in this compartment were below the limits of quantification). There was no 
accumulation of radioactivity in various glands (testes, thyroid, pituitary gland, pancreas, harderian 
gland and adrenal gland). The blood-to-plasma concentration ratios ranged from 0.652 to 0.994 across 
species (0.718 in humans). 
Protein binding and distribution in blood cells 
The distribution of [14C]binimetinib was determined in blood and plasma across multiple preclinical 
species and humans (DMPK R1100217). The plasma protein binding of binimetinib was high (> 96%) 
in all species tested except in the dog where the plasma protein binding was moderate (84%). 
Metabolism 
In vitro metabolism 
Binimetinib was shown to be both chemically and metabolically stable in the plasma from rats, 
monkeys and human at 37°C (DM05-027). The metabolic stability of binimetinib in hepatocytes from 
CD-1 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, cynomolgus monkeys and humans was characterized 
as low to moderate with hepatic extraction ratios (ER) < 30% predicted for all species.

The in vitro metabolism of binimetinib was studied in the presence of hepatic microsomes and 
hepatocytes from CD-1 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans 
(DM05-038). The most abundant metabolites produced from human hepatocyte incubations were 
products of direct glucuronidation of binimetinib.  
In incubations of [14C]binimetinib with human hepatocytes the relative contributions of 
glucuronidation (M10.2 and M10.9), hydrolysis (M15.9), formation of M10.5, and the oxidative N-
desmethylation (M3), to the overall metabolism of [14C]binimetinib were 45.1%, 5.1%, 5.9%, and 
2.4%, respectively. The primary oxidative metabolite in human hepatocyte incubations was N-
desmethyl binimetinib (M3). Finally, no metabolites were observed in incubations of [14C]binimetinib 
with human liver cytosol fractions, and no additional metabolites were observed in incubations with S9 
fractions of human liver supplemented with NAPDH. 
CYP Studies 
Experiments to determine which CYP enzymes were responsible for the oxidative metabolism of 
[14C]binimetinib were performed using insect cell membrane preparations containing individual 
recombinant CYP and flavin monooxygenases (FMO) enzymes. [14C]binimetinib metabolism above 
control levels was detectable in incubations with CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. The oxidative 
metabolite M3, found in HLM, was found to be formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. A of 
binimetinib oxidative metabolites (P8.5, M18.2, M23.0 and M24.5) were observed in CYP3A4 
incubations that were not detected following human hepatocytes or microsomal incubations.  
An in vitro study using recombinant human CYP enzymes showed that the enzymes capable of 
metabolizing binimetinib were CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 (DMPK R1100166). CYP1A2 
and CYP2C19 catalyzed the formation of the active metabolite, AR00426032 (M3). Further studies 
were conducted to determine the contribution of CYPs to the oxidative metabolism of binimetinib 
(DMPK R1100166). The inhibitor of CYP1A2, furafylline, decreased [14C]binimetinib oxidative 
metabolism in HLM (i.e., formation of M3) by ~62% with an approximate IC50 of 2.4 μM. The maximal 
percent inhibition observed with ticlopidine (CYP2B6/CYP2C19 inhibitor) was ~41%. In contrast, the 
inhibitors ketoconazole (CYP3A4), azamulin (CYP3A), quinidine (CYP2D6), montelukast (CYP2C8), and 
sulfaphenazole (CYP2C9) had little effect on total [14C]binimetinib metabolism; with maximal observed 
percent inhibitions of 0.3-9%. The percent contribution of both CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 to total hepatic 
oxidative microsomal metabolism of binimetinib was estimated to be equivalent (~50%).  
CYP Inhibition 
Binimetinib was assessed as a potential inhibitor of cytochrome P450s. Binimetinib was a weak 
inhibitor (IC50 ~ 50 μM) of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 activity. Very little or no inhibition of CYP2A6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 was observed at binimetinib concentrations up to 
100 μM. Binimetinib showed no apparent time dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 or 
CYP3A4/5 at binimetinib concentrations up to 50 μM. Binimetinib showed relatively potent inhibitory 
activity for CYP2B6 (IC50 of 6 μM and a Ki of ~1.73 μM; and was similar when adjusted for microsomal 
protein binding, Ki,u of 1.67 μM).  
CYP Induction 
Binimetinib was investigated as an in vitro inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes in human hepatocytes 
in several studies. Significant induction of CYP3A4 activity was not observed in a human DDI study, 
where multi-day administration of binimetinib (30 mg, BID) did not significantly affect the exposure of 
the CYP3A4 probe midazolam.

UGT enzymes 
Experiments to determine which UGT enzymes were predicted to catalyze the conjugative 
biotransformation of binimetinib to the direct glucuronides, M10.2 and M10.9, were performed with a 
panel of recombinant UGT enzymes.  By this approach, UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, 
UGT1A10, UGT2B4 and UGT2B7 were capable of generating both the binimetinib -glucuronide 
conjugates, M10.2 and M10.9.  
UGT1A1 was shown to be the major contributor (90%) to the formation of the direct glucuronide 
M10.9 from binimetinib in HLMs. UGT1A3 and UGT1A9 contributed 3% and 7%, respectively, to the 
glucuronidation activity.  
UGT Inhibition 
Binimetinib was found to be a weak inhibitor of human liver microsomal UGT1A-mediated SN- 38 
conjugation, with an IC50 value greater than 25 μM (DM09-035).

Excretion 
Routes and extent of excretion 
Following IV dosing of [14C]-binimetinib in the rat, faecal and urinary excretion accounted for 45% and 
46% of total radioactivity, respectively. Approximately 15% of binimetinib was excreted unchanged in 
the urine and 16% in the faeces of rats. Total radioactivity in the excreta of monkey was 99% and 
85% following PO and IV dosing, respectively, with an equal contribution for urinary and faecal 
excretory routes. The most abundant drug-related components in monkey urine included binimetinib 
and two direct glucuronides (M10.2 and M10.9). In monkey faeces, binimetinib and the amide 
metabolite (M4; ethane-diol hydrolysis product) were the most abundant entities. 
Biliary excretion of binimetinib and its metabolites was investigated in bile-duct cannulated rats (n=3) 
(DMPK R1400168). Following either intravenous (1mg/kg) or oral dosing (4mg/kg) of 
[14C]binimetinib, 50% and 39.5% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the bile, 
respectively. Biliary levels of M10.9 accounted for up to 90% of the radioactivity recovered in bile.

Toxicokinetic data 
For the 28-day toxicity study in the rat, no NOAEL could be identified. Exposure multiples at the LOAEL 
were  about  8  to  14.  The  exposure  multiple  for  the  6-month  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  the  rat  is 
approximately 3 for males and females. Similar exposure multiples but different NOAELs for males and 
females are due to the generally higher exposure of female rats compared to males.

Gastric irritation in rats (Study AA30230) 
The gastric irritation potential of binimetinib (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, PO, single dose) in 1% CMC/ 
0.5% Tween 80 in water was evaluated in male SD rats (N = 10 per group). No significant effects of 
binimetinib administration were observed at 10 and 30 mg/kg. At 100 mg/kg, binimetinib induced an 
increased incidence of superficial mucosal lesions (10/10 animals) and of hemorrhagic ulcers (9/10 
animals) compared to vehicle-treated animals. 
Skin irritation in rabbit (Study pcs-r502321) 
The possible irritation or corrosion potential of a single dose of the test substance was assessed when 
administered to the intact skin of rabbits.  Three rabbits were exposed to 0.5 grams of binimetinib, 
moistened with 0.4 mL water by application onto clipped skin for 4 hours using a semi-occlusive 
dressing. Skin reactions were assessed 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours after exposure. No skin irritation, 
corrosion or discoloration was caused by binimetinib.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In  biochemical  studies,  binimetinib  has  been  shown  to  be  a  potent  and  selective  inhibitor  of  MEK1/2 
with an enzyme IC50 of 12.1 nM. 
In  cellular  studies  in  vitro,  binimetinib  potently  inhibited  MEK-dependent  phosphorylation  of  ERK  as 
well  as  B-Raf-mutant  melanoma  cell  lines.  In  vivo,  binimetinib  significantly  inhibited  A375  xenograft 
tumours in nude mice as well as HMEX1906 a patient-derived xenografts a dose- and time-dependent

manner.  Tumour  inhibition  was  best  achieved  with  the  combination  of  either  10  or  30  mg/kg 
binimetinib and encorafenib.  
In  safety  pharmacology  studies,  binimetinib  did  not  have  any  adverse  effects  on  cardiovascular 
(monkey  telemetry),  gastrointestinal  motility  and  secretion  (in  rats),  neurobehavioral  (Irwin  rats), 
renal (rats) or respiratory function (rats) up to the highest single dose tested (100 mg/kg in rats and 
10  mg/kg  in  monkeys).  These  doses  are  above  the  MTDs  determined  in  the  repeat  dose  toxicity 
studies  in  rats  and  monkeys.  In  rats,  no  adverse  effect  on  the  main  physiological  functions  were 
observed up to approximately 65-fold the human exposure at the therapeutic dose level. In monkeys, 
no  cardiovascular  effects were  noted  at  about  1.2 to  1.6-fold  the  human  exposure  at  the therapeutic 
dose, based on AUC. 
The plasma protein binding has been measured at a range of physiologically relevant concentrations of 
97.2%. 
In  vitro,  binimetinib  and  its  active  metabolite  (AR00426032)  have  no  appreciable  activity  on  hERG 
channel current (IC50 > 30 μM and > 100 μM, respectively). 
Repeated oral administration of binimetinib in rats for up to 6 months was associated with soft tissue 
mineralisation,  gastric  mucosal  lesions  and  reversible  minimal  to  mild  clinical  pathology  changes  at  7 
to  12.5 times  human  therapeutic  exposures.    Specifically,  repeated  administration  of  binimetinib  to 
rats was associated with abrasion, alopecia and scabbing of the skin, and minimal to mild increases in 
neutrophils  and  monocytes,  ALT,  AST,  urea  and  phosphorus,  and  decreases  in  calcium  and  albumin. 
Treatment  related  histopathological  changes  included  cutaneous  erosion/ulceration  and  multi-centric 
vascular  and  tissue  mineralization,  which  only  partially  reversed  after  a  treatment  free  period.  Skin 
lesions  were  dose  related  in  both  severity  and  incidence  and  were  only  partially  reversible. 
Dermatological reactions to the administration of binimetinib are a known clinical finding. The finding of 
mineralisation  of  soft tissues  in  the  rat  may  be  species  specific  and  has  been  seen  with  another  MAP 
kinase  (MEK)  inhibitor.  The  published  literature  confirms  that  MEK  inhibition  caused  soft  tissue 
mineralisation  in  the  rat  secondary  to  serum  inorganic  phosphorus  increase,  but  nevertheless  the 
molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In a gastric irritation study in rats, an increased incidence of 
superficial mucosal lesions and of hemorrhagic ulcers were observed.  The observations were observed 
with greater frequency and at lower dose level in females than in males. In cynomolgus monkeys, oral 
administration  of  binimetinib  was  associated  with  gastro-intestinal  intolerance,  moderate  clinical 
pathology  changes,  bone  marrow  hypercellularity  and  microscopic  findings  of  gastrointestinal 
inflammation, reversible at the lowest doses which were below human therapeutic exposures. 
Administration  of  binimetinib  was  also  associated  with  weight  loss,  soft  stools,  decrease  in  red  blood 
cell mass, increased platelet, monocyte and neutrophil counts, serum globulin, and decreases in serum 
albumin,  and  albumin/globulin  ratio.  All  these  changes  were  reversible  after  a  treatment  free  period. 
Treatment-related  histological  findings  included  slight  degeneration  of  the  luminal  epithelium  and 
mixed cell infiltrates in the large intestine, mucosal hyperplasia in the cecum, colon and/or rectum. 
Binimetinib was not genotoxic. The lack of studies on pharmacodynamics drug interactions, single dose 
toxicity, carcinogencity and reproduction toxicity are acceptable as per the ICH S9 guideline. (SmPC 
section 5.3).   
Embryo-foetal  development  studies  conducted  in  rats  and  rabbits  showed  evidence  of  embryotoxicity 
(increased post-implantation loss and resorptions) and teratogenicity in rabbits only (ventricular septal 
defects  and  pulmonary  trunk  alterations)  (SmPC  section  5.3).  In  rats,  lower  gestational  body  weight 
gain and fetal body weights and a decreased number of ossified fetal sternebrae were noted. No effects 
were noted at 14-times the human therapeutic exposure. In rabbits, mortality, maternal physical signs 
of toxicity, lower gestational body weight and abortion were noted. The number of viable foetuses and 
foetal  body  weights  were  reduced  and  post-implantation  loss  and  resorptions  were  increased.  An 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 46/182 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increased litter incidence of foetal ventricular septal defects and pulmonary trunk alterations was noted 
at  the  highest  doses.  No  effects  were  observed  at  3times  the  human  therapeutic  exposure.    No 
teratogenic effects were noted in rats and rabbits up to about 30- and 3-fold, respectively, the human 
exposure  at  the  therapeutic  dose,  based  on  AUC.  Therefore,  studies  in  animals  have  shown 
reproductive  toxicity  (see  section  5.3).  There  are  no  data  from  the  use  of  binimetinb  in  pregnant 
women.  Recommendations  have  been included in  section  4.6 of  the  SmPC  concerning  pregnancy  and 
that  if  binimetinib  is  used  during  pregnancy,  or  if  the  patient  becomes  pregnant  while  taking 
binimetinib,  the  patient  should  be  informed  of  the  potential  hazard  to  the  foetus.  Women  of 
childbearing  potential  must  use  effective  contraception  during  treatment  with  binimetinib  and  for  at 
least 1 month following the last dose.  
Fertility studies were not conducted with binimetinib. In repeat-dose toxicity studies, no concern in 
terms of fertility was raised from pathological examination of reproductive organs in rats and monkeys. 
There are no data on the effect on fertility in humans for binimetinib. 
Binimetinib has phototoxic potential in vitro.  
A minimal risk for photosensitisation was shown in vivo at an oral dose providing 3.8-fold higher 
exposure than that achieved with the recommended dose in humans. These data indicate that there is 
minimal risk for phototoxicity with binimetinib at therapeutic doses in patients. 
Binimetinib is neither expected to bio-accumulate, nor to show any significant transfer to sludge and 
soil. The environmental risk assessment indicates the proposed therapeutic use of binimetinib is not 
expected to pose a significant risk to the environment. Any unused medicinal product or waste material 
should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology), submitted for the marketing 
authorisation application for binimetinib, were considered adequate and acceptable for the assessment 
of non-clinical aspects. The lack of carcinogenicity, fertility and pre-and post-natal development studies 
were well justified. Relevant information on the non-clinical aspects of binimetinib has been included in 
section 4.6 and 5.3 of the product information. Binimetinib is not expected to pose a significant risk to 
the environment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Binimetinib has been studied in a number of clinical studies to determine the PK in healthy volunteers 
and patients.  A population PK analysis was also performed to determine important covariates on the 
PK and to support an analysis of exposure versus efficacy and safety.

Study MEK162A2103: A randomized, single-centre, open-label, three-period, cross-over study 
to investigate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of oral MEK162 in healthy subjects 
Study MEKA62A2103 investigated the effect of food on the bioavailability of binimetinib. The study was 
an open-label, randomized, 3-treatment, 3-period, six-sequence, crossover study evaluating the effect 
of  food  on  the  bioavailability  of  binimetinib  tablets  (P3-MI)  in  healthy  subjects.  Subjects  were 
randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences. Subjects received the following treatments in a crossover 
manner at the same time of the day in each period of the study. 
Treatment 1 consisted of single oral 45 mg dose (3 x 15 mg tablets) of binimetinib with a high-calorie 
HFM (Test 1). Treatment 2 consisted of single oral 45 mg dose (3 x 15 mg tablets) of binimetinib with 
a  low-calorie  LFM  (Test  2).  Treatment  3  consisted  of  single  oral  45  mg  dose  (3  x  15  mg  tablets)  of 
binimetinib in FS (reference), where subjects fasted for at least 10 hours prior to dosing and 4 hours 
after dosing. 
Meal composition for a representative LFM consisted of approximately 334 kcal, of which approximately 
23% of the caloric content was attributed to fat.

Distribution 
Plasma binimetinib concentrations exhibit biphasic elimination with a median terminal half-life of 4–13 
hours across all healthy subject and patient studies. The apparent oral clearance was 28.2 L/h and 
apparent volume of distribution based on the human ADME study was about 384 L. 
Elimination 
CMEK162A2102: A Phase I, Single Centre, Open-Label Study to Investigate the Absorption, 
Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) Of MEK162 Following a Single Oral Dose of 
45 mg [14C] MEK162 in Healthy Male Subjects 
The clinical study CMEK162A2102 was conducted in healthy subjects with an objective to determine 
the rates and routes of excretion of binimetinib and its metabolites, including mass balance of total 
drug related radioactivity in urine and faeces, following the administration of a single 45 mg dose of 
[14C] binimetinib. 
After the oral administration of binimetinib to humans, an average of 62.3% of the administered 
radioactive dose was excreted in the faeces and included a total of six identified metabolites and 
binimetinib. Binimetinib was the most abundant radioactive component and accounted for 21.1% to 
45.7% of the administered radioactive dose, with an average value of 29.8%. The most abundant 
metabolites were M4, an ethane-diol cleavage product, and M15.9, carboxylic acid formed from amide 
hydrolysis, accounting for 17.2% and 6.7% of the dose, respectively. All other metabolites were 
present at ≤ 2.7% of the dose. 
Overall, a mean of 31.4% of the radioactivity dose was eliminated in the urine. A total of 14 
metabolites and binimetinib were identified. Binimetinib was the most abundant radioactive component 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 51/182 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and accounted for 5.3% to 8.1% of the administered radioactive dose, with an average value of 6.5%. 
The most abundant metabolites were M10.9 (direct glucuronide of binimetinib), M3 (AR00426032, N-
demethylated binimetinib), and M10.2 (another direct glucuronide of binimetinib), accounting for 
6.2%, 5.1% and 4.2% of the dose, respectively. All other metabolites were present at ≤ 3.2% of the 
dose. The mean cumulative excretion of radioactivity in urine and faeces is shown in Figure 3. 
The estimated mean CLR value of 1.78 L/hr accounted for 6.3% of the total mean CL/F value of 28.2 
L/hr. 
Table 25:  Amounts of Binimetinib and its metabolites in faeces following a single 
oral dose of 45 mg of 14C-Binimetinib 
In the human ADME study (CMEK162A2102), approximately 60% of the plasma radioactivity AUC was 
attributable to binimetinib. 
An in vitro study using human hepatocytes was conducted to assess the relative contributions of CYP 
and UGT enzymes to binimetinib metabolism. The metabolic clearance of binimetinib is likely to be 
dominated by the glucuronidation pathway. The relative contributions of the glucuronidation, 
hydrolysis, or the oxidative pathways (AR00426032 or M3) to overall binimetinib metabolism in human 
hepatocytes were 45.1%, 5.1% and 2.4%, respectively. In this study, unchanged binimetinib 
accounted for 17.3% of total radioactivity after 24 hours. 
The primary metabolic pathways include glucuronidation (up to 61.2% via UGT1A1 per in vitro data) 
and N-dealkylation, amide hydrolysis (up to 17.8% via CYP1A1 and CYP2C19 based on in vitro data), 
respectively. The estimated mean CLR value of 1.78 L/hours was 6.3% of the total mean CL/F value of 
28.2 L/hr.

the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Single Ascending Doses 
of ARRY-438162 in Healthy Volunteers 
In study ARRY-162-0601, healthy subjects received single, escalating doses of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 
mg binimetinib as an oral suspension. The geometric mean of binimetinib exposure parameters (Cmax 
and Area Under the Concentration Time curve [AUC]) generally increased with increasing dose and 
inter-subject variability [intra-cohort % Coefficient of Variation (CV)] ranged from 9.95% to 53.5%. 
The median Apparent Terminal Half-Life (t1/2) of binimetinib across doses was 5.98 hours, and the 
median Time to Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax) was 1 hour post-dose. The overall

AUC and metabolite AUC (Mean Ratio of Exposure [MRAUC]) was 12.8%. The overall mean percent of 
the dose excreted into urine over a 24-hour period as unchanged binimetinib and AR00426032 was 
2.5% and 4.4%, respectively. 
The PK of binimetinib and AR00426032 after repeat doses are studied in four clinical studies (ARRY-
162-0602, ARRAY-162-111, CMEK162X2201 and CMEK162X1101) and are summarized in Table 26 and

Impaired renal function 
ARRY-162-106: A Phase 1, Open-Label, Multicentre, Single-Dose Study to Evaluate the 
Pharmacokinetics of Binimetinib in Healthy Subjects with Normal Renal Function and 
Subjects with Impaired Renal Function 
The impact of renal impairment (as determined using the modification of diet in renal disease formula) 
on 45 mg single dose binimetinib as monotherapy was assessed in a clinical study with an abbreviated 
design (Study ARRAY-162-106). Results from the severe impairment cohort (i.e. subjects with eGFR 
≤29 mL/min/1.73 m2, N=6) indicated an approximate 29% and 21% increase in binimetinib exposure 
(AUCinf) and in Cmax, respectively, compared with matching healthy subjects (N=6). This increase in 
exposure was within the variability observed in both cohorts (25.6% and 38.2% for AUC and 42.5% 
and 48.7% for Cmax). Compared with the healthy subjects, the severe renal impairment cohort 
exhibited a 22% lower clearance and a slightly longer t1/2 (11.2 vs 9.16 hours).

In the binimetinib and encorafenib combination model, moderate and severe renal impairment was 
assessed as a categorical covariate using eGFR for assessment. A 5% increase in CL/F was observed in 
the moderate/severe group (grouped because of limited number of severe patients). In addition, a 2% 
increase in CL/F was observed in the mild impairment group.  
Impaired hepatic function 
CMEK162A2104: A Phase 1, Multicentre, Open-Label, Single-Dose Study to Assess the 
Pharmacokinetics  of  MEK162  in  Subjects  with  Mild,  Moderate  and  Severe  Hepatic 
Impairment 
Study CMEK162A2104 was a dedicated clinical study investigating the binimetinib PK as monotherapy 
in subjects with hepatic impairment, as defined by the NCI Organ Dysfunction Working Group versus 
healthy subjects. Healthy subjects were enrolled based on matched age, gender and body weight to 
subjects with hepatic impairment and could have matched more than one subject. Six subjects with 
mild hepatic impairment, 6 subjects with moderate impairment, 5 subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment and 7 matching healthy subjects have been dosed. 
For the mild impairment versus healthy subject comparison, GMR (90% CI) for AUC0-inf and Cmax 
were 1.10 (0.86, 1.40) and 1.11 (0.79, 1.57), respectively. For the moderate impairment (i.e. total 
bilirubin levels >1.5 and ≤3.0 × ULN and any AST value) versus healthy subject comparison, GMR 
(90% CI) for AUC0-inf and Cmax were 1.94 (1.53, 2.47) and 1.38 (0.98, 1.95), respectively. Due to 
the 2-fold increase in exposure observed in the moderate impairment cohort, the dose was reduced to 
15 mg in the severe impairment cohort. For the severe impairment (i.e. total bilirubin levels >3.0 × 
ULN and any AST value) versus healthy subject comparison, GMR (90% CI) for AUC0-inf and Cmax 
were 2.11 (1.62, 2.74) and 1.57 (1.12, 2.20), respectively. 
Population Pharmacokinetic and Exposure Response Analysis of Binimetinib 
The study CP16-001 was conducted with the objective to develop a PopPK model for binimetinib and 
active metabolite AR00426032, to predict binimetinib and active metabolite exposures. 
Final population PK models were used to derive rich concentration-time profiles and exposure 
parameters were derived according to the randomized dose in patients enrolled in all studies. 
Simulations were derived based on steady-state conditions. Exposure parameters of binimetinib 
following concomitant administration with encorafenib in patients enrolled in the COLUMBUS Part 1 
study are presented in Table 29.

Gender 
In the binimetinib monotherapy analysis, female subjects (N=387) were found in a greater proportion 
in the population PK analysis dataset than males (N=214). A similar trend was observed for binimetinib 
in the binimetinib and encorafenib combination population model including 166 females and 256 males, 
with females exhibiting a 13% lower CL/F and 14% lower V/F relative to males. 
Race 
Japanese patients have shown 1.5 to 2-fold higher binimetinib exposures (Cmin,ss, Cmax, AUC0-12h) 
than non-Japanese patients after administration as monotherapy. In Study CMEK162X1101, Japanese 
patients (N=9) were shown to have higher steady-state binimetinib exposures compared to all patients 
in Study CMEK162X2201 (N=22) following administration of 45 mg binimetinib. The mean Cmax and 
AUC0-12h values were 771 ng/mL versus 439 ng/mL and 3550 ng.h/mL versus 2103 ng.h/mL, 
respectively. In Study CMEK162A2301, plasma concentrations of binimetinib and AR00426032 were 
analysed in Japanese versus non-Japanese patients. Six Japanese patients were identified in the 
binimetinib arm for comparison to non-Japanese patients. At steady-state condition (i.e. pre-dose 
Week 4), Japanese patients showed higher mean binimetinib concentrations than non-Japanese 
patients (305 ng/mL versus 127 ng/mL pre-dose, respectively). 
Weight 
For an individual in the 95th percentile of weight (i.e. 110 kg), the population PK analysis suggested a 
26% change in V/F compared to the typical individual of 78 kg, and a 23% change for an individual in 
the 5th percentile of weight (53kg). A similar trend between body weight and binimetinib V/F was 
observed in the binimetinib and encorafenib combination model with 34% increase at the 95th 
percentile (i.e. 112 kg) and 26% decrease at the 5th percentile (i.e. 54 kg).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Binimetinib showed weak inhibition (IC50 ~ 50 μM) of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. Very little or no inhibition 
of CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 was observed at binimetinib 
concentrations of up to 100 μM. Binimetinib showed no apparent time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, 
CYP2C9, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4/5 at binimetinib concentrations of up to 50 μM.  
Binimetinib showed inhibition of CYP2B6 with an IC50 value of ~6 μM and a Ki value of 1.7 μM. A basic 
model for reversible inhibition was used to calculate the R value of inhibition of CYP2B6 with 
binimetinib using the parameters obtained in the in vitro studies. Since the R value was 1.61, the static 
mechanistic model was used to calculate the AUCR to determine if an in vivo study was warranted (if 
AUCR > 1.25). The AUCR was calculated to be 1.03, therefore it was concluded that binimetinib was 
not likely to be an inhibitor of CYP2B6 and an in vivo study not needed to assess the interaction 
potential.

Binimetinib showed a 1.88 to 2.24-fold induction for CYP2C9 mRNA with 20 μM of binimetinib, relative 
to the vehicle control in primary human hepatocytes. The induction at lower concentrations (0.1, 1, 
and 10 μM) was less than 2-fold. Treatment of hepatocytes with binimetinib caused no induction of 
CYP2C9 activity, as shown by less than 2-fold metabolism of diclofenac. In the second experiment, 
binimetinib concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 30 μM, and a 2.68-fold induction was observed only in 
one of the two hepatocyte donors at 30 μM. 
CYP3A4 induction was observed at all concentration ranges tested. At 0.1 μM binimetinib the induction 
ranged from 1.88 to 3.00-fold, and at 20 μM binimetinib, the induction ranged from 23.7 to 37.2-fold. 
Binimetinib  was  a  weak  inhibitor  of  UGT1A-mediated  glucuronidation  of  SN-38  with  an  IC50  value  of 
greater than 25 μM. The average percent of inhibition at 25 μM was 20.3%. The effect of binimetinib 
on UGT1A enzyme activities is presented in Table 32. 
Table 32: 
Effect of Binimetinib on UGT1A Enzyme Activities 
Binimetinib was not found to be an in vitro inhibitor of BCRP or P-gp. BCRP and P-gp efflux activity 
were largely unaffected by concentrations of binimetinib up to 50 μM. 
Study ARRAY-162-105 was a study in 15 healthy subjects investigating the PK of binimetinib in the 
presence of the proton-pump inhibitor rabeprazole. The GMR for Area Under the Concentration-Time 
Curve from Time 0 Extrapolated to Infinity (AUCinf) increased 4% (GMR = 1.04) following co-
administration with rabeprazole. The treatment groups were bioequivalent as indicated by the 90% CI 
of the GMR (0.930 – 1.17). Likewise, there was no effect on Tmax. In contrast, Cmax was decreased 
after administration with rabeprazole by 17% (GMR = 0.826) and this change was determined to be 
statistically significant as indicated by the 90% CI of the GMR (0.692 – 0.984). However, the 
magnitude of change (17%) was less than the reported variability in the study for Cmax across both 
treatment periods (30.9 % to 41.7%). 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
In humans, the mean plasma protein binding of binimetinib was 97.4% when evaluated by the rapid 
equilibrium dialysis method (DMPK R1300621_DMPK R1300621a). The blood-to-plasma concentration 
ratios of binimetinib ranged from 0.65 to 0.99 in the species tested, and appeared to be independent 
of concentration. In humans, the blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.72 over the concentration range 
evaluated (50 to 10,000 ng/mL). 
Characterization of Binimetinib as a Substrate of Xenobiotic Transporters 
In Caco-2 cells, MEK162 was confirmed as an efflux substrate (BA/AB >2.0), since, in the presence of 
verapamil, a specific P-gp inhibitor, the transwell permeability and efflux of binimetinib were increased 
and reduced, respectively. Binimetinib was confirmed as a substrate of both P-gp and BCRP in MDR1-
expressing LLC-PK1 cells and BCRP expressing MDCK cells, respectively.

The potential involvement of several uptake transporter families (OCT1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and 
OATP2B1) in binimetinib plasma clearance was investigated using a representative cocktail of 
transporter inhibitors in human hepatocyte assays (DMPK R1100398). The data suggested that hepatic 
uptake transporters are not involved in binimetinb plasma clearance and distribution into human 
hepatocytes. Additionally, binimetinib does not display significant active renal secretion as only 6.5% 
of the dose was excreted in urine as binimetinib in humans (Study CMEK162A2102); as such it was not 
evaluated as a substrate of OAT1/3 and OCT2. 
Transporter Inhibition 
Binimetinib was not found to be an inhibitor of BCRP or P-gp. BCRP and P-gp efflux activity were 
largely unaffected by concentrations of binimetinib up to 50 μM (DMPK R 1100165). MEK162 did not 
affect the P-gp mediated transport of digoxin in Caco-2 or MDR1 transfected LLC-PK1 cell monolayers 
(DM05-042-A1_DM05-042-A2). 
Binimetinib was shown to reduce [3H] estradiol 17ß-glucuronide ([3H]E217ßG) accumulation into 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner, however, the estimated IC50 
values for inhibition of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3-mediated ([3H]E217ßG) uptake by binimetinib were 23.6 
± 9.6 μM and ~29 μM, respectively. Binimetinib did not inhibit the transport activity of OCT1 (1 to 100 
μM) but was a weak inhibitor of the transport activity of OCT2 (IC50 18.1 ± 1.3 μM) in vitro). The IC50 
values for binimetinib inhibition of OAT1 and OAT3 activities were approximately 27 μM and 1.9 ± 0.17 
μM, respectively. Additionally, binimetinib was assessed as an inhibitor of BSEP-mediated taurocholic 
acid transport in inside-out membrane vesicles containing expressed BSEP from 0.1 to 25 μM. 
Binimetinib did not cause a dose-dependent inhibition of BSEP activity (~20% maximal inhibition). 
Likewise, binimetinib is not predicted to affect transport of substrates of the renal MATE1 or MATE2-K 
transporters. Binimetinib was not a potent inhibitor of metformin uptake by MATE1 (IC50 >50 μM) and 
did not inhibit MATE2-K when tested up to 50 μM in recombinant HEK cell lines expressing each 
transporter (DMPK R 1100433; DMPK R 1200819; DMPK R 1200760; DMPK R 1400791; DMPK R 
1400790).

Mechanism of action 
See non-clinical pharmacology. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In Study ARRAY-162-111, post-dose decreases in tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) levels were 
observed in serum samples, as well as post-dose decreases in Ki67 and phosphorylated ERK (pERK) 
levels in skin punch biopsies for patients in the 30 to 60 mg BID dose cohorts. 
In Study CMEK162X1101, skin expression of pERK was evaluated as potential surrogate PD marker of 
binimetinib inhibition, pre-dose at baseline and post-dose on Day 15 of Cycle 1. Tumour tissue was not 
evaluated as no paired tumour sample was available. A total of 11 out of 17 patients with matched 
skin samples demonstrated a decrease in pERK H-score from baseline (4 of 6 patients in the 30 mg 
BID and 7 of 11 patients in the 45 mg BID dose level cohorts). The median (range) percentage change 
from baseline to Day 15 of Cycle 1 was −34.6% (−95.3% to 108.3%), indicating inhibition of the 
target at both evaluated dose levels.

Exposure-Safety 
Exposure-safety analyses were conducted using a logistic regression model across multiple oncology 
studies with binimetinib in combination with encorafenib (Studies CMEK162B2301 [Part 1], 
CMEK162X2109, CMEK162X2110 and CLGX818X2101). The relationships between model-predicted 
binimetinib and encorafenib exposure (AUCss) and the expected incidence of increased ALT, PPE, 
pyrexia and diarrhoea were assessed. Exposure-response relationships for binimetinib and encorafenib 
in combination were similar in most instances due to the confounding effect of the combination 
therapy. 
When anchored for encorafenib monotherapy, high AUCss of binimetinib were associated with slightly 
higher probabilities of increased ALT (all grades), pyrexia (grade ≥2) and diarrhoea (grade ≥2), 
though none were statistically significant.  
Binimetinib appeared to mitigate the effect of encorafenib on PPE (grade ≥2) by reducing the 
probability from 32.4% to 42.6% across quartiles of encorafenib exposure to 1.0% to 2.0%.  
Logistic regression evaluation of grade 2 or greater LVEF reduction and exposure found no significant 
relationships for increased incidence and increased exposure for model predicted exposure metrics 
(Cmin,ss, AUCtau,ss, Cmax,ss [p > 0.05]). Additional ER analyses were conducted on CHMP request 
including the ADRs skin rash (grade≥2), skin infections (grade≥2), skin neoplasms (grade≥2), retinal 
events (grade≥2), high levels of AST (all grades), high levels of gGT (all grades), CK elevations (all 
grades) and arthralgia (grade≥2) and included patients from COLUMBUS parts 1 and 2. 
Results from the updated logistic models with positive relationship (i.e. harmful effect [p<0.05]) 
between the exposure and the probability of adverse events showed that all higher exposure 
parameters levels of binimetinib (Cmin,ss, Cmax,ss, AUCtau,ss) were associated with increased 
probabilities of retinal events (grade ≥ 2), high levels of AST (all grades) and high levels of CK (all 
grades).  
For the probability of high CK levels, the probability estimated with the absence of binimetinib (i.e., 
encorafenib monotherapy) was 3.84% and then this probability increased to 11.73%, 15.95%, 20.03% 
and 30.08% for patients with AUCss binimetinib in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th quartiles, respectively. 
Logistic regression models with negative relationship (i.e., beneficial effect [p<0.05]) between drug 
exposure and the probability of adverse events showed that higher exposure of binimetinib was 
associated with a decrease in the probability of skin infection, rash events and of arthralgia events. 
Secondary pharmacology with regard to cardiac safety was assessed by popPK modelling. No relevant 
change of QTcF from baseline was found, and this supported also results from the pivotal study. 
Regarding pharmacodynamic drug interactions the applicant argued that in the pivotal study no 
potential interacting drugs were used. As currently only few drug substances have the potential to 
inhibit MEK the potential for such PD interactions is generally low. Potential off-target activity of 
binimetinib (and encorafenib) to inhibit other kinases is low at the proposed recommended doses.  
Regarding genetic differences in PD response of binimetinib UGT1A1 genotype analysis of binimetinib 
exposure performed in the pivotal study did not establish meaningful changes of predose 
concentrations between genotypes. Presumably, for a similar concentration safety and efficacy effects 
could be expected comparable.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of binimetinib were studied in healthy subjects and patients with solid tumours 
and advanced and unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma. After repeat twice-daily dosing 
concomitantly with encorafenib, steady-state conditions for binimetinib were reached within 15 days 
with no major accumulation. The mean (CV %) Cmax,ss was 654 ng/mL (34.7 %) and mean AUCss was 
2.35 ug.h/mL (28.0 %) in combination with encorafenib as estimated by population PK modelling. 
Binimetinib pharmacokinetics have been shown to be approximately dose-linear. 
After oral administration, binimetinib is rapidly absorbed with a median Tmax of 1.5 hours. Following a 
single oral dose  of  45 mg [14C]  binimetinib  in  healthy  subjects,  at least 50 % of  the  binimetinib dose 
was  absorbed.  Binimetinib  showed  low  solubility  at  physiological  pH  but  higher  at  acidic  pH. 
Administration  of  a  single 45 mg  dose of  binimetinib  with  a  high-fat,  high-calorie  meal decreased  the 
maximum  binimetinib  concentration  (Cmax)  by  17 %,  while  the  area  under  the  concentration-time 
curve (AUC) was unchanged. A drug interaction study in healthy subjects indicated that the extent of 
binimetinib exposure is not altered in the presence of a gastric pH-altering agent (rabeprazole). 
Administration of the commercial formulation of binimetinib with food (HFM) resulted in no significant 
change in total exposure. Cmax increased with a LFM (29%) but decreased with a HFM (17%). Both a 
high fat and low-fat meal have only a small effect on Cmax, therefore it can be agreed the drug can be 
taken without regard for food. 
The  plasma  protein  binding  has  been  measured  at  a  range  of  physiologically  relevant  concentrations 
and is 97.2 % bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. Binimetinib is more distributed in plasma than 
blood.  In  humans,  the  blood-to-plasma  ratio  is  0.718.  Following  a  single  oral  dose  of  45 mg  [14C] 
binimetinib in healthy subjects, the apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of binimetinib is 374 L. 
Following  a  single  oral  dose  of  45 mg  [14C]  binimetinib  in  healthy  subjects,  the  primary 
biotransformation pathways of binimetinib observed in humans include glucuronidation, N-dealkylation, 
amide  hydrolysis,  and  loss  of  ethane-diol  from  the  side  chain.  The  maximum  contribution  of  direct 
glucuronidation to the clearance of binimetinib was estimated to have been 61.2 %. Following a single 
oral  dose  of  45 mg  [14C]  binimetinib  in  healthy  subjects,  approximately  60 %  of  the  circulating 
radioactivity AUC in plasma was attributable to binimetinib. In vitro, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 catalyse the 
formation  of  the  active  metabolite,  which  represents  less  than  20 %  of  the  binimetinib  exposure 
clinically. 
Following  a  single  oral  dose  of  45 mg  [14C]  binimetinib  in  healthy  subjects,  a  mean  of  62.3 %  of  the 
radioactivity was eliminated in the feces while 31.4 % was eliminated in the urine. In urine, 6.5 % of 
the  radioactivity  was  excreted  as  binimetinib.  The  mean  (CV %)  apparent  clearance  (CL/F)  of 
binimetinib was 28.2 L/h (17.5 %). The median (range) binimetinib terminal half-life (T1/2) was 8.66 h 
(8.10 to  13.6 h).  In  faeces  binimetinib  was  the  most  abundant  radioactive  component  and  accounted 
for  an  average  value  of  29.8%  of  dose.  The  most  abundant  metabolites  were  M4,  an  ethane-diol 
cleavage  product,  and  M15.9,  a  carboxylic  acid  formed  from  amide  hydrolysis,  accounting  for  17.2% 
and 6.7% of the dose, respectively. All other metabolites were present at ≤ 2.7% of the dose. In urine 
binimetinib  was  the  most  abundant  radioactive  component  and  accounted  for  5.3%  to  8.1%  of  the 
administered  radioactive  dose,  with  an  average  value  of  6.5%.  The  most  abundant  metabolites  were 
M10.9  (direct  glucuronide of  binimetinib),  M3  (AR00426032,  N-demethylated binimetinib),  and  M10.2 
(another  direct  glucuronide  of  binimetinib),  accounting  for  6.2%,  5.1%  and  4.2%  of  the  dose, 
respectively. All other metabolites were present at ≤ 3.2% of the dose.

Given  the  31.7%  unchanged  in  faeces,  biliary  elimination  of  binimetinib  cannot  be  discounted.  The 
elimination appears mainly hepatic. The major route of elimination appears to be due to metabolism by 
UGT1A1  but  the  quantitative  contribution  is  uncertain.    Binimetinib  is  primarily  metabolised  through 
UGT1A1  mediated  glucuronidation.  In  clinical  study  sub-analysis,  however,  there  was  no  apparent 
relationship  observed  between  binimetinib  exposure  and  UGT1A1 mutation  status.  In  addition, 
simulations  to  investigate  the  effect  of  400 mg  atazanavir  (UGT1A1  inhibitor)  on  the  exposure  of 
45 mg  binimetinib  predicted  similar  binimetinib  Cmax  in  the  presence  or  absence  of  atazanavir. 
Therefore,  the  extent  of  drug  interactions  mediated  by  UGT1A1  is  minimal,  and  unlikely  clinically 
relevant;  however,  as  this  has  not  been  evaluated  in  a  formal  clinical  study,  UGT1A1  inducers  or 
inhibitors  should  be  administered  with  caution    (see  Section  4.5  and  5.2  of  the  SmPC).  UGT1A1 
inducers (such as rifampicin and phenobarbital) and inhibitors (such as indinavir, atazanavir, sorafenib) 
should be co administered with caution.Binimetinib is not an inhibitor of UGT1A1. While encorafenib is 
a  relatively  potent  reversible  inhibitor  of  UGT1A1,  no  differences  in  binimetinib  exposure  have  been 
observed clinically when binimetinib is co-administered with encorafenib (see section 5.2). 
Cytochrome P450 enzymes appear to account for less than 25% of the elimination. Binimetinib does 
not inhibit CYPs except for CYP 2B6 which had a Ki of 1.7 µM, however the mechanistic static model 
was used to rule out an interaction. Binimetinib shows induction of CYP 3A4 in vitro and this was 
investigated in a clinical study. Induction of mRNA for CYP 1A2 and 2B6 is greater than 2-fold (16.5 
and 2.6-fold respectively).  In vitro, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 catalyse the formation of the active 
metabolite, AR00426032 (M3) by oxidative N-desmethylation. Binimetinib is a potential inducer of 
CYP1A2, and caution should be taken when it is used with sensitive substrates (such as duloxetine or 
theophylline). Binimetinib is a weak reversible inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. Inducers of CYP1A2 
enzymes (such as carbamazepine and rifampicin) and inducers of Pgp transport (such as Saint John's 
wort or phenytoin) may decrease binimetinib exposure, which could result in a decrease of efficacy. 
Binimetinib is a weak inhibitor of OAT3, and caution should be taken when it is used with sensitive 
substrates (such as pravastatin or ciprofloxacin) and no clinicallly significant drug-drug interactions 
caused by binimetinib on other transporters is expected. 
Binimetinib is not an inhibitor of Pgp, BCRP, OAT1, OCT1, OCT2, MATE-1, MATE-2k or BSEP.  It is a 
weak inhibitor of OATP1B1 and 1B3, but it can be agreed this does not appear to be clinically relevant 
concentrations. In addition, as 30% is eliminated unchanged in faeces, therefore biliary excretion, 
possibly by Pgp, cannot be discounted. In vitro experiments indicate that binimetinib is a substrate of 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Inhibition of P-gp or BCRP is 
unlikely to result in a clinically important increase in binimetinib concentrations as binimetinib exhibits 
moderate to high passive permeability. In vitro studies also demonstrated that binimetinib is a P-gp 
and BCRP substrate, but the effects of inhibitors of these substrates on the PK of binimetinib in vivo 
has not been investigated. 
Binimetinib is metabolised by UGTs and CYP1A2 is a substrate for Pgp..  Specific inducers of these 
enzymes have not been studied and may result in a loss of efficacy. 
There  do  not  appear  to  be  any  major  metabolites  of  binimetinib.  M3  is  stated  to  be  equipotent  and 
attributes  less  than  20%  of  binimetinib  exposure.  The  plasma  protein  binding  of  metabolite  M3  has 
been determined in all relevant species and is 95.26% in man.   
Binimetinib  appears  essentially  linear  over  the  dose  range  of  20  to  100  mg,  however  there  may  be 
some  less  than  proportional  increase  at  steady  state  in  patients  at  does  above  30  mg  but  data  is 
limited.

Modest accumulation is seen following multiple dosing, ~1.3 fold in patients following 45 mg.  This is 
consistent  with  the  calculated  half-life.  The  data  is  based  on  a  comparison  of  Day  1  to  Day  15.  Data 
from the midazolam study shows that steady state is achieved by Day 8 which is slightly longer than 
may be expected based on the half-life. 
The exposure appears to be slightly higher in patients compared to healthy volunteers.  In the POPPK 
analysis clearance is determined to be 32% greater in healthy volunteers.   
Exposure to binimetinib 45 mg BID in Study CMEK162X2110 was within the ranges of values observed 
in  the  single-agent  studies  (Studies  ARRAY-162-111  and  CMEK162X2201),  regardless  of  encorafenib 
dose level. 
Binimetinib  undergoes  minimal  renal  elimination.  Results  from  a  dedicated  clinical  study  showed  that 
patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR ≤ 29 mL/min/1.73 m2), had a 29 % increase in exposure 
(AUCinf),  a  21 %  increase  in  Cmax,  and  a  22 %  decrease  in  CL/F  compared  to  matching  healthy 
subjects. These differences were within the variability observed for these parameters in both cohorts of 
this study (25 % - 49 %) and the variability previously observed in patient clinical studies, hence these 
differences  are  unlikely  to  be  clinically  relevant.  It  is  agreed  that  based  on  these  PK  results  no  dose 
adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
The effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of binimetinib in combination with encorafenib 
have not been evaluated clinically.  
As binimetinib is primarily metabolised and eliminated via the liver, patients with moderate to severe 
hepatic  impairment  may  have  increased  exposure.  Results  from  a  dedicated  clinical  study  with 
binimetinib  only  indicate  similar  exposures  in  patients  with  mild  impairment  (Child-Pugh Class A)  and 
subjects with normal liver function. While an increase in dose-normalised (total) binimetinib exposure 
was  only  small  with  mild  impairment,  a  two-fold  increase  in  total  binimetinib  exposure  (AUC)  was 
observed  in  patients  with  moderate  (Child-Pugh Class B)  and  severe  (Child-Pugh Class C)  hepatic 
impairment  (see  section 4.2)    and  clearance  reduced  to  about  50%.  In  contrast  to  binimetinib,  the 
plasma  concentration  of  the  metabolite  AR00426032  decreased  with  increasing  hepatic  impairment. 
This increase expends to three fold in both moderate and severe hepatic impairment when considering 
unbound binimetinib exposure (see section 4.2). 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A).  
As encorafenib is not recommended in patients with moderate (Child Pugh B) or severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh C), administration of binimetinib is not recommended in these patients. (see 
section 4.2 of encorafenib SmPC).  
Binimetinib has not been evaluated in patients with Gilbert’s disease. The main route of hepatic 
transformation of binimetinib being glucoronidation, the  decision for treatement should be made by 
the treating physician taking into account the individual benefit-risk. 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age or body weight do not have a clinically important 
effect on the systemic exposure of binimetinib. Based on a population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, 
the PK of binimetinib were similar in males as compared with females. There are insufficient data to 
evaluate potential differences in the exposure of binimetinib by race or ethnicity. 
An analysis performed with the POPPK model does not show a significant effect for a 79-year-old 
compared to a 59 or 75-year-old. Data has been provided for different age categories based on 
Bayesian PK parameters.  There is evidence of a slight decrease in clearance in older patients however 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 64/182 
 
 
 
 
 
this does not seem to be large enough to require a dose adjustment. No dose adjustment is required 
for patients aged 65 years and older (see section 5.2). 
It is unknown whether binimetinib or its active metabolite are excreted in human. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
or to discontinue binimetinib therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and 
the benefit of therapy for the mother.   
Exposure – Response Relationship: Binimetinib in Combination with Encorafenib 
When  analysing  ORR,  a  relationship  between  binimetinib  AUCss  and  the  probability  of  ORR  shows  no 
positive or negative trend. This was observed for part 1 with Combo450 and for part 2 in Combo300. 
Overall, results derived with Cox proportional hazard models are consistent with those derived for ORR 
and exposure-response observations from Kaplan-Meier plots, whereby baseline LDH was the strongest 
prognostic  factor  of  death  or  progression.  The  results  of  these  analyses  indicated  that  higher 
binimetinib  exposure  was  associated  with  longer  PFS  than  lower  exposure  (updated  analyses  Combo 
450 Part 1: 16.6 and 12.7 months, respectively), whereas high and low encorafenib exposure showed 
an  inverse  relationship  with  PFS  (updated  analyses  Combo  450  Part  1:  9.36  and  16.5  months, 
respectively). All groups showed longer PFS than the vemurafenib control arm (7.33 months). 
With  the  responses,  the  applicant  submitted  corresponding  analyses  for  OS.  These  showed  a 
comparable pattern: with higher than median binimetinib AUCss OS of 39.5 months, with lower AUCss 
29.6 months; and for encorafenib inversely a longer OS with lower AUCss (36.8. vs. 23.1 months).  
For  part  2,  with  Combo300,  the  new  analyses  for  PFS  were  comparable  for  binimetinib:  higher  than 
median AUCss 13.4 months, lower AUCss 11.1 months. Here, no effect of encorafenib exposure as in 
part 1 was observed.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic aspects of binimetinib are generally well presented and 
considered sufficiently well characterised.  The relevant information has been included in section 4.5 
and 5.3 of the SmPC. 
The CHMP requests the following measures to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
−  DDI cocktail study: OATP and BCRP will be explored in the ongoing DDI study with rosuvastatin 
(study ARRAY-818-103)  
−  Overall survival results stratified by LDH level for Combo 300 and Enco 300 (Part 2).  
−  To collect PK samples from BRAF melanoma patients with moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment after repeated dosing of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib to determine 
the plasma concentrations in relation to administered dose and AEs observed to guide dosing 
recommendations in these patient populations. 
The CHMP recommends the applicant to submit the following measures to address the issues related to 
pharmacology: 
−  The applicant should commit to submit the results of the planned biomarker analyses for Study 
B2301 (from all 3 treatment arms) for evaluation as soon as available, to support the 
synergistic pharmacodynamic activity of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib. Genomic 
analysis of baseline samples remaining after centralized BRAF testing. As indicated in the 
protocol, genomic alterations in BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PTEN, cKIT, PIK3CA, MAP2K1,

MAP2K2, ARAF, c-MET, CRAF, EGFR and CCND1 may be explored to find a potential association 
between baseline mutations and efficacy outcomes. 
−  The relationship between baseline mutations and efficacy outcomes should be performed, and 
a date provided to submit the results. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The dose recommended for binimetinib and the administration schedule for use in combination with 
encorafenib in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma is 45 mg BID. This corresponds to 
0.35 μg/mL and 2.1 μg.hr/mL in terms of Cmax and AUC0-12h at steady state in humans. 
Clinical  studies  relevant  in  the  determination  of  binimetinib dose  selection  are  presented in  the  Table 
33 below. 
Table 33: 
Selection 
Clinical Studies Relevant in Determination of Binimetinib Dose 
In study ARRY-162-0601, healthy subjects received single, escalating doses of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 
mg  binimetinib  or  matching  placebo.  Twenty  subjects  (4  subjects  per  dose  level)  received  treatment 
with  binimetinib  and  1  subject  per  dose  level  received  placebo.  Headache  was  the  most  common 
adverse  in  this  study.  Clinical  laboratory  results,  vital  signs,  electrocardiograms  and  physical 
examinations indicated no safety concern of a single dose of binimetinib ranging from 5 mg to 40 mg. 
In study ARRY-162-0602, healthy subjects received escalating doses of 5, 10, or 20 mg Once Daily 
(QD) binimetinib, 20 mg BID binimetinib, 40 or 60 mg QD binimetinib for 14 days, a single dose of 80 
mg binimetinib or matching placebo. A total of 50 subjects were enrolled and 44 completed the study. 
The most commonly reported adverse events were diarrhoea, headache, rash and acne. There was no 
evidence that diarrhoea or headache was dose-related and none of these events led to discontinuation

of  study  drug.  Adverse  events  in  the  Skin  and  Subcutaneous  Tissue  Disorders  system  organ  class 
occurred with the greatest incidence in the 20 mg BID, 40 mg QD, and 60 mg QD binimetinib groups. 
The  recommended  Phase  2  dose  (RP2D)  of  binimetinib  monotherapy  was  determined  in  Study 
ARRAY-162-111,  a  Phase  1  dose-escalation  study  in  patients  with  advanced  cancer  to  determine  a 
maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  following  30,  45,  60,  and  80  mg  BID  binimetinib.  The  primary 
objectives  were  to  determine  the  Maximum  Tolerated  Dose  (MTD)  and  to  characterize the  safety  and 
PK  of  binimetinib.  Nineteen  patients  with  advanced  solid  tumours  received  binimetinib  in  the  Dose-
escalation Phase. Four dose levels were evaluated: 30 mg BID, 45 mg BID, 60 mg BID and 80 mg BID. 
Two  of  4  patients  receiving  80  mg  BID  experienced  Dose  Limiting  Toxicities  (DLTs),  thus  the  80  mg 
BID  dose  was  declared  non-tolerable.  Seven  patients  were  enrolled  at  60  mg  BID  and  no  DLTs  were 
observed;  therefore,  60  mg  BID  was  declared  the  MTD.  Following  completion  of  the  Dose-escalation 
Phase,  74  patients  were  enrolled  in  the  Expansion  Phase,  including  28  patients  in  the  biliary  cancer 
cohort at 60 mg BID dose, 31 patients in KRAS-mutant CRC cohort with 6 patients at 60 mg BID and 
25  at  45  mg  BID  dose,  and  15  patients  in  the  BRAF-mutant  CRC  cohort  at  45  mg  BID  dose.  The 
incidence of adverse events resulting in reduction of binimetinib dose were reported at a 3-fold higher 
incidence  in  patients  in  the  60  mg  BID  dose  group  compared  with  the  45  mg  BID  dose  group,  and 
resulted in the decision to discontinue evaluation of the 60 mg BID dose in this study, thus 45 mg BID 
was determined to be the RP2D. 
The safety and efficacy of binimetinib monotherapy was assessed in the Phase 2 study, 
CMEK162X2201, conducted in patients with advanced and unresectable or metastatic cutaneous 
melanoma harbouring a BRAF V600E or NRAS mutation. Patients received a dose of either 45 or 60 mg 
BID binimetinib, which demonstrated preliminary signs of antitumour activity. Twenty-five patients 
initially received 60 mg BID binimetinib but subsequently had their dose reduced to 45 mg BID due to 
the occurrence of 2 serious AEs with suspected relationship to the study drug. The results confirmed 45 
mg BID to be a generally well-tolerated dose with an acceptable safety profile in patients with BRAF 
V600E mutation-positive advanced cutaneous melanoma.

Treatments 
Encorafenib was supplied as 50mg and 100mg capsules (the MAA is for 50mg and 75mg capsules). 
Patients were not to have eaten anything for 2 hours before and 1 hour after the morning dose of 
study drug. 
Patients received study treatment until progressive disease (PD) per RECIST v1.1 as determined by the 
blinded independent review committee (BIRC), unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, 
physician decision or early termination of the study. 
The permitted dose reduction levels for encorafenib were 300 mg, 200 mg, 100 mg and 50 mg QD 
with specific recommendations regarding eye disorders, CK elevation, decreased LVEF, QTc 
prolongation, skin, gastrointestinal and liver-related AEs. Dose re-escalation was permitted if toxicity 
improved to ≤ Grade 1, except for QT prolongation (QTcF >500msec). A patient in the Combo 450 arm 
who permanently discontinued binimetinib could continue encorafenib monotherapy but, if encorafenib 
was permanently discontinued, then binimetinib had to be discontinued due to its limited efficacy in 
monotherapy.  Patients requiring treatment interruption >28 days were to be permanently 
discontinued. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to determine whether treatment with Combo 450 prolongs progression-free 
survival  (PFS)  compared  with  vemurafenib  in  patients  with  BRAF  V600  mutant  locally  advanced 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma. This was addressed by Part 1 of the study. 
The key secondary objectives were to determine the contribution of binimetinib to the combination by 
comparing  the  PFS  of  Combo  450  vs.  encorafenib (Part  1)  and  to  further  quantify  the  contribution  of 
binimetinib to the combination by comparing the PFS of Combo 300 vs. encorafenib (Part 2). 
Other secondary objectives included: 
Part  1  only  –  to  compare  the  treatment  effect  of  Combo  450  vs.  vemurafenib  in  terms  of  overall 
survival  (OS);  to  estimate  the  treatment  effect  of  combo  450  vs.  encorafenib  in  terms  of  OS;  to 
determine the safety and tolerability of Combo 450 and encorafenib in this patient population 
Part  2  only-  to  estimate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  combo  300  vs.  encorafenib  in  this  patient 
population;  to  estimate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  Combo  300  vs.  Combo  450  in  this  patient 
population; to estimate the treatment effect of Combo 300 vs. encorafenib in terms of OS; to estimate 
the treatment effect of Combo 300 vs. vemurafenib in terms of PFS and OS; to estimate the treatment 
effect of Combo 300 vs. Combo 450 in terms of PFS and OS. 
Parts 1 & 2- to estimate the treatment effect of encorafenib vs. vemurafenib in terms of PFS and OS; 
to  assess  objective  response  rate  (ORR)  by  treatment  arms;  to  describe  time  to  response  (TTR);  to 
assess  disease  control  rate  (DCR);  to  evaluate  duration  of  response  (DOR);  to  compare  the  patient-
reported outcomes (PROs) and the ECOG PS between the treatment arms and to characterise the PK of 
encorafenib and binimetinib in this patient population.

Parts  1  &  2-  to  explore  baseline  molecular  status  of  genes  relevant  to  RAF/MEK/ERK  and  PI3K/AKT 
signalling in tumour tissue and their potential correlation to efficacy outcomes and to explore potential 
markers of acquired resistance to encorafenib and encorafenib plus binimetinib 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  the  study  was  PFS,  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of 
randomisation  to  the  date  of  the  first  documented  progression  based  on  tumour  assessment  read 
centrally by a BICR according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred 
first.  If  a  patient  did  not have  an  event  at  the time  of  the  analysis  cut-off  or at  the  start of  any  new 
antineoplastic  therapy,  PFS  was  censored  at  the  date  of  the  last  adequate  tumour  assessment.  If  a 
patient discontinued treatment for “disease progression”, without documented evidence of progression 
based on RECIST v1.1, it was not to be considered as a PFS event. 
The key secondary for Part 1 was PFS per BIRC on Combo 450 vs. Enco 300. 
Other secondary endpoints 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
•  OS (time from the date of randomization to date of death due to any cause);  
•  ORR (proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR or PR, calculated for confirmed 
and unconfirmed responses separately);  
• 
TTR (time from date of randomization until first documented CR or PR);  
•  DCR (proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR or stable disease);  
•  DOR (time from the date of first documented CR or PR to the first documented progression or 
death due to underlying cancer) and  
• 
the  PROs  i.e.  Functional  Assessment  of  Cancer  Therapy  Melanoma  [FACT-M]  v  4,  European 
Organization  for  Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer  Quality  of  Life  Questionnaire  Core  30 
[EORTC QLQ-C30] v 3.0 and EuroQoL-5D-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L] v 4.0. The main PRO endpoints 
were time to definitive 10% deterioration in the FACT-M melanoma subscale and global health 
status score of the EORTC QLQ-C30; change from baseline in the FACT-M melanoma subscale, 
EQ-5D-5L, and global health status score of the EORTC QLQ-C30; change from baseline in the 
other EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales. 
Efficacy and PROs were assessed every 8 weeks until week 105 and every 12 weeks thereafter until 
progression or end of treatment. Patients were then followed every 12 weeks for survival and use of 
subsequent anticancer therapy. Safety was assessed every 4 weeks. Patients in the combination arms 
had an ophthalmic exam at the start of each treatment cycle and pre- and post-dose PK samples.

Sample size 
For the vemurafenib arm, a median PFS of 7 months was assumed based on results from studies in 
previously untreated patients and patients who progressed after at least one prior systemic treatment 
were studied, respectively, where the median PFS values were 6.9 and 6.8 months, respectively.  
Based on the dose-escalation results and the dose-expansion results of the Clinical Study 
CLGX818X2101, the observed median for patients treated with encorafenib was 7.1 months (95% CI 
3.7, 14.7) and 7.4 months (95% CI 7.4, not estimable [NE]), respectively. In this less advanced 
patient population, the median PFS was therefore expected to be around 8 months. 
Based on results from Clinical Study CMEK162X2110, Combo 450 was expected to result in a 42% 
reduction in hazard rate compared to vemurafenib (corresponding to an increase in median from 7 
months to 12 months). 
The observed benefit with Combo 300 was expected to be lower than with Combo 450. The median 
PFS was therefore anticipated to be around 11 months. 
In study Part 1, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive Combo 450, encorafenib or 
vemurafenib. The sample size driver for study Part 1 was the Combo 450 vs. encorafenib comparison. 
For the comparison of Combo 450 vs. encorafenib, 191 PFS events were required to detect a HR of 
0.667 with an 80% power using a log-rank test at a one-sided 2.5% level of significance. For the Part 
1 primary comparison, Combo 450 vs. vemurafenib, 145 PFS events were required to detect a HR of 
0.58 with a 90% power using a log-rank test at a one-sided 2.5% level of significance. 
A total of 576 patients (192 patients in each arm) were planned to be recruited in Part 1 over around 
15 months, accounting for 15% loss to follow-up. The primary analysis was to be performed when a 
sufficient number of PFS events for both the primary and key secondary comparisons were available, 
which was expected to occur around 22 months after first treatment of the first patient. 
In Part 2, the new Combo 300 arm was added. The data already collected in Part 1 for the encorafenib 
arm represented a considerable amount of information; therefore, the randomization ratio for Combo 
300 to encorafenib in Part 2 was 3:1.  
Considering a 3:1 randomization ratio in the second part of the study and aiming for a similar number 
of patients in the Combo 300 and the encorafenib arm (combining Part 1 and 2), 320 additional 
patients were to be randomized (80 in the encorafenib arm and 240 in the Combo 300 arm). 
The Part 2 PFS Analysis was to be performed when approximately 340 PFS events had occurred in total 
in the encorafenib (both parts) and Combo 300 arms. Based on the differential follow-up and expected 
median PFS times, it was expected that approximately 330 of these events would contribute to the HR 
estimate and log-rank test, and would result in approximately 80% power to detect a HR of 0.727 
(8/11) at a one-sided 2.5% level of significance. This was anticipated to occur approximatively 37 
months after first treatment of the first patient. 
Randomisation 
In Part 1, approximately 576 patients were to be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the 3 treatment 
arms.  
Randomisation was stratified by AJCC stage (IIIB + IIIC + IVM1a + IVM1b vs. IVM1c); ECOG PS (0 vs. 
1), BRAF mutation status (V600E vs. V600K) and prior first-line immunotherapy for unresectable or 
metastatic disease (yes vs. no). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 73/182 
 
 
 
 
 
Prior first line immunotherapy (yes vs. no) added with Protocol Amendment 2 (post enrolment of 2 
patients), when inclusion of this patient group was allowed. 
BRAF mutation status (V600E vs. V600K) was removed as a stratification factor with Protocol 
Amendment 2, as the V600K stratum was expected to be very small. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open label. However, blinded tumour assessment data read centrally by a BIRC were 
used in the primary efficacy analysis. 
Statistical methods 
The following analysis populations were defined: 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was defined according to the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) principle, and 
consisted of all randomized patients. Following the ITT principle, patients were analyzed according to 
the treatment and stratification factors they were assigned to at randomization. 
The Per-protocol Set (PPS) consisted of all patients from the FAS without any major protocol deviations 
and who received at least one dose of study medication. 
The Safety Set included all patients who received at least one dose of the study medication and had at 
least one valid post-baseline safety evaluation. Patients were analyzed according to the study 
treatment they actually received. 
The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PAS) consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of 
encorafenib or binimetinib and had at least one evaluable post-baseline encorafenib or binimetinib 
concentration measurement. The same definition applied to the Japanese subgroup. 
All efficacy analyses were performed using the FAS, unless otherwise specified. 
The primary and key secondary efficacy comparisons were based on PFS, defined as the time from the 
date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression, or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurred first. Censoring rules to be applied to the PFS endpoint are described in the 
following table.

Table 34: 
Censoring rules to be applied to the progression-free survival analysis 
Blinded tumor assessment data read centrally by a BIRC were used in the primary efficacy analysis. 
The local Investigator’s assessments were used in a supportive analysis of PFS. 
The primary analysis was the comparison of the distribution of PFS between Combo 450 and 
vemurafenib using a stratified log-rank test at a one-sided 2.5% cumulative level of significance. 
The null and the alternative hypothesis were defined as follows: 
of PFS in the control arm (i.e. vemurafenib) and SC450(t) is the survival distribution function of PFS in 
the experimental arm (i.e. Combo 450). 
where Svem(t) is the survival distribution function 
Progression-free survival was analyzed based on the data from the FAS according to the treatment arm 
and 2 of the stratification factors (cancer stage and ECOG PS) patients were randomized to. Due to the 
relatively low expected prevalence of patients with prior immunotherapy (around 15%), the 2 prior 
immunotherapy strata (yes and no) were combined at the time of the analysis to avoid small or empty 
strata. The same principle applied to all stratified tests and models in this study. 
The distribution of PFS was described in tabular and graphical format by treatment arm using Kaplan-
Meier methods, reporting estimated median (in months) with 95% confidence interval (CI), 25th and 
75th percentiles and Kaplan-Meier estimated probabilities with corresponding 95% CIs at several time 
points (including at least 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 months). 
A Cox regression model stratified by randomization stratification factors was used to estimate the HR 
of PFS, along with 95% CI based on the Wald test. 
To  control  type  I  error,  a  hierarchical  testing  procedure  was  used  and  the  secondary  endpoint  of  OS 
Combo 450 vs vemurafenib was to be tested only if the primary and key secondary PFS comparisons 
were statistically significant.  
Data cut-off for Part 1 was to take place once the planned number of patients had been randomised to 
Part 1 (i.e. 576 patients) and sufficient PFS events were available for the final primary and Part 1 key 
secondary  comparison  (i.e.145  PFS  events  for  Combo  450  vs.  vemurafenib  and  191  PFS  events  for

Combo  450  vs.  encorafenib).  The  analysis  was  performed  at  204  PFS  events  for  Combo  450  vs. 
vemurafenib and 223 PFS events for Combo 450 vs. Enco 300.

(hierarchical testing sequence)

Overall  survival  was  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the  date  of  death  due  to 
any cause. If a death was not observed by the date of analysis cutoff, OS was to be censored at the 
date  of  last  contact.  Survival  time  for  patients  with  no  post-baseline  survival  information  was  to  be 
censored on the date of randomization. For analysis of OS, a group sequential design with one interim 
analysis (at time of PFS analysis (Part 2)) was planned to be used. To maintain the overall type-I error 
rate  for  the  trial,  the  type-1  error  rate  was  based  on  a  α-spending  function  using  a  Gamma  function 
with  parameter  1.  At  the  time  of  the  Primary  PFS  Analysis  (Part  1),  no  formal  testing  of  OS  was 
performed in order to preserve Sponsor blinding to OS and maintain the integrity of the planned first 
interim analysis. 
Secondary efficacy variables were analyzed in the FAS and were to include ORR, TTR, DCR, DOR and 
PROs.  
The  BIRC  assessments  were  used  for  the  main  analyses  of  best  overall  response  (BOR),  ORR,  TTR, 
DCR  and  DOR.  ORR  and  DCR  were  presented  by  treatment  arm  along  with  exact  95%  CI  using  the 
Clopper-Pearson method. 
Time  to  response  and  duration  of  response  were  descriptively  analyzed  using  the  Kaplan-Meier 
method.

The  change  in  tumor  size  was  to  be  depicted  using  waterfall  plots  presenting  the  best  percentage 
change from baseline in the sum of the diameter of all target lesions. These plots were to display the 
best percentage change from baseline in the sum of the diameter of all target lesions for each patient. 
Health-related QoL data were collected via PROs. The FACT-M, EQ-5D-5L and EORTC QLQ-C30 patient 
questionnaires  were  used  in  this  study.  Health-related  QoL  data  were  analyzed  using  the  FAS.  The 
FACT-M  melanoma  subscale,  index  score  of  EQ-5D-5L  and  the  global  health  status/QoL  score  of  the 
EORTC  QLQ-C30  were  identified  as  the  primary  PRO  variables  of  interest.  Physical  functioning, 
emotional  functioning  and  social  functioning  scale  scores  of  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  were  considered  as 
secondary. 
The  primary  PRO  analysis  was  to  assess  the  difference  in  distribution  of  the  time  to  definitive  10% 
deterioration  in  the  FACT-M  subscale  among  the  treatment  arms  in  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS).  Only 
assessments collected while the patient was on treatment and at the EOT visit were included.

Recruitment 
Patients were randomised at 162 sites in 28 countries; 20 sites in North America, 124 sites in Europe 
and 18 sites in selected countries from the rest of the world. A small number were enrolled per site so 
data from all sites were pooled.  
Conduct of the study 
The proportion of patients with at least one protocol deviation was similar among the 3 treatment arms 
(62.0% Combo 450, 66.0% encorafenib, 64.4% vemurafenib arm). Most protocol deviations were due 
to key procedures not performed as per protocol (48.4% Combo 450, 52.6% encorafenib, 54.5% 
vemurafenib arm). Deviations due to eligibility criteria not met were reported in each treatment arm 
(8.9% Combo 450 arm, 10.8% encorafenib arm, 4.7% vemurafenib arm). 
There were 4 amendments to the original study protocol (dated 13 May 2013). 
Version 1, Amendment 1 (3 October 2013) was issued before any patients were randomised and 
included clarification that patients known to be NRAS mutation positive should not be selected for pre-
screening. 
Version 2, Amendment 2 (20 December 2013) after 2 patients had been randomised allowed inclusion 
of patients progressing on or after first line immunotherapy.  
Version 3, Amendment 3 (4 November 2014) was issued when 364 patients had been randomised. 
Part 2 was added. Consequently, allocation to Part 1 was reduced, the primary objective of analysis of 
PFS of encorafenib monotherapy vs. vemurafenib was changed to a secondary endpoint and the key 
secondary endpoint of overall survival for Combo 450 vs. vemurafenib was changed to a secondary 
endpoint to be tested hierarchically after the Part 2 key secondary endpoint.  
Version 4, Amendment 4 (13 Jul 2015), documented a change in study sponsorship.  
At the time of the primary PFS analysis (data cut-off 19 May 2016), the required number of survival 
events had not occurred for analysis of overall survival (OS). On 14 October 2016, the DMC reviewed 
un-blinded data from Part 1 (data cut-off 19 May 2016) and un-blinded survival data, to which the 
Sponsor (Array) and Pierre Fabre remained blinded. The DMC recommended the following: 
• 
• 
Terminate the planned analyses and inform all patients (in Parts 1 and 2) of the Part 1 results. 
Inform patients in the vemurafenib arm that a combination of commercially available BRAF and 
MEK inhibitors may be a better alternative regimen. 
There were no specific recommendations regarding the encorafenib monotherapy arm. The decision to 
continue encorafenib monotherapy or change to a BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination was to be based on 
a discussion between the patient and physician. 
To minimise the delay in the timing of the OS interim analysis, the applicant proposed that the protocol 
be amended to de-couple the Part 1 OS analysis from the primary Part 2 PFS analysis. The timing of 
the Part 1 OS analysis became event driven; the interim OS data was submitted with the response to 
the D120 list of questions.  
Per Protocol Amendment 5.0, two OS analyses of Combo 450 vs. vemurafenib were planned based on 
the number of OS events in the Combo 450 and vemurafenib arms combined:

Part 1 OS Interim Analysis: The primary OS analysis was to be performed when approximately 232 
OS events were observed  
Final OS Update: to be performed when approximately 309 OS events were observed  
The data cut-off date for this Part 1 OS interim analysis was 7 November 2017, by which time a total 
of 232 OS events were observed in the Combo 450 and vemurafenib arms combined in Part 1 of the 
study.

Twenty-one patients (3.6%) were excluded from the PPS (4 patients [2.1%] Combo 450, 10 patients

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoint: PFS based on BIRC review in the FAS 
PFS  for  the  Combo  450  vs.  vemurafenib  alone  was  14.9  vs.  7.3  months,  respectively,  with  a  HR  of 
0.54 (95% CI 0.41, 0.71, 1 sided stratified log rank p<0.001). No imputations were used for the start 
or end dates for the primary PFS analysis.

The median PFS values based on Kaplan-Meier estimates were 14.8 months (95% CI 10.4, 18.4) and 
7.3  months  (95%  CI  5.7,  8.5)  for  the  Combo  450  and  vemurafenib  arms,  respectively  (HR  of  0.49, 
95% CI 0.37, 0.64; nominal p < 0.001). 
Median follow-up time for PFS per BIRC was 16.7 months for the Combo 450 arm and 14.4 months for 
the vemurafenib arm. Just under half of the patients were censored for the primary PFS analyis, most 
prior to the median PFS in each arm. The most common reason for censoring in the Combo 450 and 
encorafenib arms was because patients remained on treatment (29.7% and 24.2%, respectively), 
whilst in the vemurafenib arm it was because patients had started a new cancer therapy (19.9%).

Sensitivity analyses 
The median PFS by investigator assessment was similar to the BIRC result: 14.8 months (95% CI 
10.4, 18.4) vs. 7.3 months (95% CI 5.7, 8.5) for the Combo 450 and vemurafenib arms, respectively, 
with a HR of 0.49 (95% CI 0.37, 0.64; nominal p < 0.001). In general, there was agreement regarding 
the type of event (PD/ death) between the Investigator and BIRC. There was discordance regarding 
the timing of the PD event in about 30% of cases, with no evidence of bias between the arms.  
The results in the per protocol set (PPS) by BIRC were reflective of the primary analysis. The median 
PFS was 15.5 months (95% CI, 11.0, 18.7) in the Combo 450 arm and 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.6, 8.3) 
in the vemurafenib arm (HR =0.53; 95% CI, 0.40, 0.70; nominal p < 0.001). 
Results of additional sensitivity analyses of PFS by BIRC were consistent with the primary PFS analysis, 
yielding similar HRs (0.53 – 0.56), median PFS values and p values.

Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
PFS Combo 450 vs. Encorafenib 
In  Part 1, the median PFS was 14.9 months (11.0,  18.5) and 9.6 months (7.5, 14.8) for Combo 450 
and  encorafenib  respectively  (HR  0.75,  95%  CI  0.56,  1.00).  The  PFS  difference  was  not  statistically 
significant  (p  =  0.0256)  by  the  one-sided  stratified  log-rank  test  according  to  the  threshold  of  p  < 
0.025. Approximately half the patients in each arm had a PFS event (98 patients [51.0%] Combo 450; 
96  patients  [49.5%]  encorafenib).  The  median  follow-up  time  for  PFS  per  BIRC  was  16.7  months  for 
the Combo 450 and 16.6 months for the encorafenib arm. 
An updated PFS analysis performed on 07 November 2017 gave a similar result (median PFS: Combo 
450  vs  encorafenib  14.9  vs  9.6  months,  HR:  0.77  (95%  CI  [0.59-1]),  one  sided  nominal  p

Per Investigator assessment of response, the median PFS estimates were 14.8 months (95% CI 10.4, 
18.4) and 9.2 months (95% CI 7.4, 12.9) in the Combo 450 and encorafenib arms, respectively (HR 
0.68; 95% CI 0.52, 0.90; nominal p = 0.003). Approximately half the patients in each arm had a PFS 
event (102 [53.1%] Combo 450; 108 [55.7%] encorafenib). 
Sensitivity analyses of PFS by BIRC using data from the FAS were conducted as per the primary 
efficacy endpoint.  
The HR for PFS of Combo 450 vs. encorafenib using unstratified log-rank and Cox regression tests was 
0.81 (95% CI 0.61, 1.07; nominal p = 0.0714). 
The remaining sensitivity analyses yielded nominal p values <0.025 (see Table below).

Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
PFS, Encorafenib vs. Vemurafenib  
Analysis of the PFS by BIRC of encorafenib vs. vemurafenib treatment showed a difference of 
approximately 2.3 months (9.6 months vs. 7.3 months; nominal one-sided log-rank p = 0.004; HR = 
0.68, 95% CI 0.52, 0.90). Investigator assessment of response gave similar PFS durations 
(encorafenib 9.2 months, vemurafenib 7.3 months; nominal one-sided log-rank p = 0.004; HR = 0.68, 
95% CI 0.52, 0.90). Median PFS values by BIRC were the same in the PPS as in the FAS.

g Not included in BOR assessment but included in denominator for ORR and DCR. No assessment has 
occurred by BIRC; not included in patients with measurable or non-measurable disease at baseline. 
Median  time  to  objective  response  (TTR)  per  BIRC,  calculated  for  responding  patients  only 
(confirmation not required), was 1.9 months in the Combo 450 arm (95% CI 1.9, 1.9), 2.0 months in 
the  encorafenib  arm  (95%  CI  1.9,  3.6)  and  2.1  months  in  the  vemurafenib  arm  (95%  CI  1.9,  3.7). 
Median  TTR  per  Investigator  assessment  was  also  approximately  2  months  for  each  arm.  This  timing 
corresponded with the first post-baseline response assessment at Cycle 3 Day 1. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of median duration of response (DOR) per BIRC, calculated for confirmed 
responses, were 16.6 months in the Combo 450 arm (95% CI 12.2, 20.4; range 1.64 – 22.11), 14.9 
months in the encorafenib arm (95% CI 11.1, NE; range 0.62 – 15.47) and 12.3 months in the 
vemurafenib arm (95% CI 6.9, 16.9; range 0.92 – 16.89). 
Investigator review revealed a similar pattern but a higher ORR in each arm (75.0 % [95% CI 68.3, 
81.0]; 57.7% [95% CI 50.4, 64.8]; 49.2 % [95% CI 41.9, 56.5], respectively).  
The confirmed CR by Investigator review was higher than by BIRC (16.1%, 8.8% and 7.3% of patients 
in the Combo 450, encorafenib and vemurafenib arms, respectively) and their median time to CR was 
5.5 months, 5.5 months and 3.9 months, respectively. 
The DCR per Investigator review was similar to per BIRC.  
Median TTR per Investigator assessment was also approximately 2 months for each arm. This timing 
corresponded with the first post-baseline response assessment at Cycle 3 Day 1. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of median DOR per Investigator, calculated for confirmed responses, were 
similar to those by BIRC: 16.2 months, 14.8 months and 8.4 months in the Combo 450, encorafenib 
and vemurafenib arms. 
Overall Survival, Combo 450 vs. Vemurafenib  
As of the data cut-off (7 November 2017), 80 patients (13.9%) were ongoing in the treatment period 
of the study (22.4% Combo 450 arm, 12.4% encorafenib arm, 6.8% vemurafenib arm). The median 
duration of exposure to study treatment in the Combo 450 arm (11.8 months) was longer than in the 
encorafenib (7.2 months) and vemurafenib (6.1 months) arms. Within the Combo 450 arm, median 
durations of exposure to encorafenib and binimetinib were identical (11.8 months). 
The most common reason for discontinuation from study treatment, in all arms, was progressive 
disease and the rate was higher in the vemurafenib arm (57.1%) as compared with the Combo 450 
(51.6%) and encorafenib (51.5%) arms. The rates of withdrawal by physician and by patients were 
higher for vemurafenib (8.9% each) and encorafenib (12.4% and 8.8%) vs Combo 450 (4.7% and 
5.7%). The proportion of patients censored for this OS analysis in the Combo 450 arm (45.3%) was 
higher than that observed in the vemurafenib arm (33.5%). Most censored patients in both groups 
who were alive and ongoing had a last contact within the 12 weeks prior to data cut-off. 
For all randomized patients, the median time between randomisation and OS cut-off dates was 37.45 
months [30.98–46.29 months]. When measured as the time from randomisation until event/censoring, 
the median potential follow-up duration using reverse Kaplan Meier for OS was 37.2 months in the 
Combo 450 arm, 36.3 months in the encorafenib arm and 35.9 months in the vemurafenib arm.

A lower proportion of patients in the Combo 450 arm (41.7%) received antineoplastic therapy after 
discontinuation of study treatment compared with the encorafenib (55.7%) and vemurafenib (62.3%) 
arms, partly due to a higher proportion of patients in the Combo 450 arm who continued to receive 
study treatment as of the data cut-off. A similar proportion of patients in each arm received 
subsequent treatment with a monoclonal antibody, mainly checkpoint inhibitors (34.4% Combo 450, 
36.1% encorafenib, 39.8% vemurafenib arm). A lower proportion of patients in the Combo 450 arm 
(10.9%) received subsequent treatment with BRAF inhibitors and/or combinations of BRAF and MEK 
inhibitors after discontinuation of study treatment as compared with either the encorafenib (21.6 %) or 
the vemurafenib (32.9%) arms.

An estimated 39% reduction in the risk of death was observed for patients treated with Combo 450 
compared to those treated with vemurafenib (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47, 0.79), with median OS values of 
33.6 months (95% CI 24.4, 39.2) and 16.9 months (95% CI 14.0, 24.5), respectively.  
Estimates of OS at 12 months and 24 months were 75.5% (95% CI 68.8, 81.0) and 57.6% (95% CI

for vemurafenib. 
The results of sensitivity analyses are consistent with those of the interim OS analysis and lead to 
similar conclusions about treatment effect.

the  robustness  of  the  statistical  significance  of  treatment  effect  on  OS  when  adjusting  for  main

Health related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Analyses 
Patient  compliance  with  the  3  QoL  instruments  (FACT-M,  EORTC-QLQ-C30,  EQ-5D-5L)  was  calculated 
for  patients  still  “at-risk”  i.e.  receiving  treatment  or  in  post-treatment  follow-up  on  the  protocol-
scheduled  PRO  assessment  date.  Compliance  with  the  3  questionnaires  was  equivalent  among  the  3 
treatment arms, with approximately 80%-95% of patients still at risk completing the assessment from 
baseline to Cycle 25.  
At  baseline,  the  mean  [SD]  FACT-M  score  was  similar  in  the  3  treatment  arms:  Combo  450  (52.39 
[9.05]), Enco 300 (52.84 [8.23]) and vemurafenib arm (52.01 [8.65]). The median time to definitive 
10%  deterioration  in  the  FACT-M  global  health  status  score  was  not  reached  in  the  Combo  450  arm 
(95% CI 22.1, NE) and was 22.1 months (95% CI 15.2, NE) in the vemurafenib arm with a HR for the 
difference  of  0.46  (95%  CI  0.29,  0.72)  using  a  stratified  Cox  regression  model.  The  median  time  to 
definitive 10% deterioration in the FACT-M was 20.3 months (95% CI 15.0, NE) in the encorafenib arm 
with a HR for the difference between Combo 450 and encorafenib of 0.48 (95% CI 0.31, 0.75) using a 
stratified Cox regression model.

Figure 17:  Kaplan-Meier Plot of Time to Definitive 10% Deterioration in FACT-M 
Global Health Status – Combo 450 vs. Enco 300 (FAS, Part1) 
At  baseline,  the  mean  [SD]  EORTC  QLQ-C30  global  health  status  score  was  similar  in  the  3 
treatment  arms:  Combo  450  (66.72  [21.59]),  Enco  300  (66.10  [21.16])  and  the  vemurafenib  arm 
(64.74 [23.61]). The median time to definitive 10% deterioration in the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health 
status score was delayed by more than 7 months in the Combo 450 arm compared to the vemurafenib 
arm: 23.9 months (95% CI 20.4, NE) vs. 16.6 months (95% CI 11.9, NE) with a HR for the difference 
of  0.55  (95%  CI  0.37,  0.80)  using  a  stratified  Cox  regression  model.  The  median  time  to  definitive 
10%  deterioration  in  the  QLQ-C30  global  health  status  scores  was  longer  in  the  Combo  450  arm 
compared  with  the  Enco  300  arm  (14.7  months  [95%  CI  9.2,  18.4]),  with  a  HR  for  the  difference  of 
0.45 (95% CI 0.31, 0.65) using a stratified Cox regression model.  
At  baseline,  the  mean  EQ-5D-5L  index  score  was  similar  for  each  arm  (Combo  450  =  0.74, 
encorafenib = 0.76, vemurafenib = 0.73) and the median was 0.77 for each of the 3 treatment arms. 
The Combo 450 arm showed a slight improvement at Cycle 3 Day 1 from baseline and the vemurafenib 
showed no change. In subsequent visits, the scores decreased over time for both arms. Comparison of 
the  Combo  450  arm  vs.  the  encorafenib  arm  showed  similar  results  to the  comparison  of  the  Combo 
450 arm and vemurafenib arm.  
Study CMEK162B2301 PART 2 
The main objective of Part 2 (a key secondary objective) was to further quantify the contribution of 
binimetinib to the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib, by comparing PFS of Combo 300 
(encorafenib 300 mg QD and binimetinib 45 mg BID) vs. encorafenib single-agent (encorafenib 300 
mg QD).  
Approximately 320 patients were planned to be randomised in a 3:1 ratio to Combo 300: Enco 300. 
The inclusion – exclusion criteria were identical to Part 1.

An unplanned initial analysis of Part 2 based on 293 events (vs 340 events planned) was performed 
using a data cut-off date of 09 November 2016 in agreement with the FDA. Analysis of the Part 1 key 
secondary endpoint (PFS, Combo 450 vs. encorafenib) was not statistically significant; therefore, per 
protocol-specified testing hierarchy, the data in this PFS part 2 analysis are summarized descriptively 
without formal testing. 
As pre-specified, (SAP version IV), the Part 2 initial CSR reports data from the combined Part 1 and 
Part 2 encorafenib monotherapy patients (N=280) and Part 2 encorafenib monotherapy patients only 
(N=86) through to the cut-off date for the Part 2 report.  
All efficacy analyses were performed using the full analysis set (FAS).  
Results 
Part 2 patients were randomised between 19 March 2015 and 12 November 2015. A total of 344 
patients were randomised during Part 2, 258 patients in the Combo 300 arm and 86 in the encorafenib 
arm.  
Figure 18: Patient flow chart for Part 2 of study CMEK162B2301 
The two treatment groups (Combo 300 and Enco 300 [Parts 1 + 2]) were reasonably well balanced in 
terms of baseline and disease characteristics.  As would be expected because these were directly 
randomised groups, the Combo 300 and Enco 300 Part 2 populations were similar at baseline.  
However, there were some differences between the two encorafenib monotherapy arms (Part 1 and 
Part 2). Patients in the encorafenib Part 2 arm were older (median age 57 years, 30.2% were ≥ 65 
years old) than those in the encorafenib Part 1 arm (median age 54 years, 20.6% were ≥ 65 years

old). The proportion of patients with Stage IV M1C with elevated LDH was higher in the Enco 300 Part 
2 arm compared with Enco 300 Part 1 (37.2% vs. 25.8%). More Enco 300 Part 1 patients had Stage IV 
M1B (20.1% vs 11.6%), and Stage IV M1C with normal LDH (36.1% vs 30.2% respectively). A 
difference was seen in the overall duration of disease with a median time from initial diagnosis to 
randomisation that was nearly 5 months longer in the Enco 300 Part 2 population (28.4 vs 23.6 
months). Distribution of disease location was similar between combinations for skin and/or lymph 
nodes; however more Enco 300 Part 1 patients had lung metastases (19.6% vs 8.1% respectively), 
while more patients in Enco 300 Part 2 had other organs involved. Baseline LDH levels were higher in 
Enco 300 Part 2 patients, with a mean of 338 U/L vs 265 UI/L and a median of 217 U/L vs 189 U/L vs 
respectively.

The analysis was supported by the sensitivity analysis of the Investigator assessment (HR=0.72, 95% 
CI: 0.57, 0.91; nominal p=0.003), which had the same median PFS values as those by BIRC at 12.9 
months (95% CI: 10.9, 14.8) and 9.2 months (95% CI: 7.4, 11.1) for the Combo 300 arm and the 
encorafenib (Parts 1 + 2) group.  
Sensitivity analyses of PFS by BIRC were conducted: per protocol, unstratified, actual event, 
backdating and further anticancer therapy yielded similar HRs (0.75 – 0.78).  
Most subgroup analyses of PFS per BIRC demonstrated point estimates in favour of the Combo 300 
arm. In the 3 subgroups for which point estimates were in favour of the encorafenib (Parts 1 +2) 
group (BRAF V600K mutation status, AJCC stage IIIb-IVM1B and one organ involved at baseline), all 
had large 95% CIs which overlapped with the other subgroup of the respective category.  
The confirmed ORR per BIRC in the Combo 300 arm was 65.9% (95% CI: 59.8, 71.7) compared with 
50.4% (95% CI 44.3, 56.4) in the Enco 300 (Parts 1 + 2) group. Responses were of similar duration 
with a median DOR for confirmed responses per BIRC of one year in each treatment group (Combo 300 
arm=12.7 months [95% CI: 9.3, 15.1]; encorafenib (Parts 1 + 2) group=12.9 months [95% CI 8.9, 
15.5].  
The ORR per Investigator review was higher in both the Combo 300 arm and the encorafenib (Parts 1 
+ 2) group than by BIRC, with the difference in favour of Combo 300 maintained (72.5% Combo 300 
arm, 56.4% Enco 300 [Parts 1 + 2] group). Median DORs per Investigator were approximately 13 
months in each treatment group.

arm.  
In patients randomised concurrently in Part 2 of the study, there was an estimated 43% risk reduction 
in BIRC-assessed PFS in the Combo 300 arm (N=258) compared to the encorafenib monotherapy arm 
(N=86); HR=0.57, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.78; nominal stratified one-sided log-rank p<0.001. Median PFS 
was 12.9 months (95% CI: 10.1, 14.0) and 7.4 months (95% CI: 5.6, 9.2), respectively.

The effect of treatment on PFS was estimated using a non-adjusted regression analysis, stratified by 
the study randomisation stratification factors (ECOG and disease stage). The crude HR was 0.57 (95% 
CI: 0.42, 0.79). 
The four Propensity Score approaches including stratification (3 and 5 strata), matching, and IPW 
showed a benefit of Combo 300 over Enco 300 Part 2. HRs ranged from 0.52 to 0.70 (upper 95% cI 
0.80 to 1.00).

Results of the prespecified sensitivity analysis of PFS by BIRC for the encorafenib arm (Part 1) vs. 
encorafenib arm (Part 2) showed an estimated 32% risk reduction in the encorafenib (Part 1) arm (HR 
0.68; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.95; nominal one-sided p=0.013). The median PFS times of the encorafenib Part

PFS analyses of Enco 300 Part 1 vs Part 2, adjusted for confounding factors in the context of two 
independent cohorts, were conducted using the propensity score (PS) test. However, the PS is 
normally used for the description of populations accrued at a similar time point, whereas Enco 300 
populations were recruited sequentially in Parts 1 and 2. The model cannot account for the potential 
bias introduced by this temporal difference.

Contribution of binimetinib 45 mg BID to the efficacy of Combo 450: Combo 450 vs. Combo 
300 
A post hoc comparison of data from the Combo 450 arm [Part 1 of CMEK162B2301 (N=192) at the 
cut-off date for the primary analysis of 19 May 2016] and the Combo 300 arm [Part 2 (N=258) 
unplanned initial analysis at the cut-off date of 09 November 2016] was conducted. The two data cut-
offs were chosen to allow similar duration of follow up, as the populations were not recruited 
concomitantly. Median potential follow-up for PFS was comparable for the two populations (16.7 
months vs 13.9 months) and the median follow-up time was 9.3 months for both combinations. A 
supportive analysis was performed using the 09 November 2016 for the two arms. 
The Combo 450 and Combo 300 populations were similar in terms of age, sex, race and ECOG 
performance status. A slightly higher proportion of patients was enrolled in Europe, North America and 
Australia in Combo 450 compared to Combo 300 (9.5% difference). Median time from initial diagnosis 
to onset of metastatic disease was longer in the Combo 450 than the Combo 300 population (15.0 vs 
10.4 months). Distribution of disease location and disease burden were similar between combinations, 
although a higher proportion of patients had only one disease site in Combo 300 (30.2% vs 24.5% 
with Combo 450). Median LDH levels at baseline were slightly higher in Combo 300 (202 vs. 173 U/L). 
Median PFS (per BIRC) was 2 months longer for Combo 450 (14.9 months) than for Combo 300 (12.9 
months), but the difference was not statistically significant (log rank p value 0.0845).

Stratified Analyses 
Other efficacy parameters by BIRC showed similar results for the two combinations (ORR = 63.0% vs 
65.9% and DCR = 92.2% vs 90.7%, respectively).  However, the duration of confirmed responses was 
longer for Combo 450 vs Combo 300 (16.6 months vs 12.7 months) which is aligned with the 
difference in PFS.  
Similar results were seen when comparing median PFS per Investigator (14.8 vs 12.9 months, 
respectively). ORRs per Investigator review were also similar, although higher (75.0% vs 72.5%). 
The analysis performed using the 09 November 2016 cut-off date for the two arms was supportive.

and 5 strata), matching, and inverse probability weighting (IPW), were used to estimate the treatment 
effect on PFS and adjust for confounding factors. The different PS methods (adjusted and non-
adjusted) gave similar results when comparing Combo 450 and Combo 300 for PFS, reaching an HR of 
0.75 to 0.79, with an upper 95% CI above 1 (1.01 to 1.09).

Supportive study(ies) 
Supportive study: CLGX818X2109- LOGIC 2 
Study  CLGX818X2109  (LOGIC  2)  is  an  ongoing  multicentre,  open-label,  2-part  Phase  2  study  of 
sequential  LGX818/MEK162  (encorafenib/binimetinib)  combination  followed  by  a  rational  combination 
with  targeted  agents  after  progression,  with  the  aim  of  overcoming  resistance  in  adult  patients  with 
locally advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 melanoma. There was no control group. 
BRAF mutation was assessed from blood samples locally and from tumour samples (archival or fresh), 
both locally and centrally. Eligibility was based on local tumour BRAF mutation results and included all 
V600 mutations (e.g. V600E, K, D, L or R). 
Patients  were  to  be  ≥  18  years  of  age  with  AJCC  stage  IIIC  or  IV  melanoma,  measurable  disease  as 
determined  by  RECIST  v1.1  and  an  ECOG  PS  of  ≤2.  Patients  were  to  have  no  symptomatic  brain 
metastases  or  symptomatic/  untreated  leptomeningeal  disease.  No  prior  treatment  was  allowed  with 
radiation  therapy  (>  30%  of  the  bone  marrow  reserve),  chemotherapy,  biological therapy  within  ≤  4 
weeks  or  small  molecule  therapeutics  or  investigational  agents  within  5-half-lives  prior  to  starting 
study drug. Patients had to have recovered from the side effects of prior therapy. 
In Part 1, patients were treated with the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of encorafenib 450mg QD 
in combination with binimetinib 45 mg BID [Combo 450]) until PD (as defined per RECIST v1.1) or no 
clinical benefit. Three different patient populations were included: 
• Group A: Patients naïve to treatment with BRAF inhibitors  
•  Group  B:  Patients  who  progressed  after  single-agent  BRAF  or  MEK  inhibitor  or  after  combination 
BRAF  and  MEK  inhibitors  other  than  binimetinib/encorafenib  or  receiving  binimetinib  and/or 
encorafenib, who had not progressed yet or, in consultation with the Sponsor, who received any BRAF 
and/or MEK inhibitor other than binimetinib and/or encorafenib and had not progressed yet. 
• Group C: Patients who progressed after binimetinib/encorafenib combination therapy  
In  Part  2,  patients  previously  treated  with  binimetinib/encorafenib  combination  therapy  and  who 
relapsed  on  this  therapy  received  tailored  combination  treatment  with  binimetinib/encorafenib  and  a 
third  agent in  one of  four arms  based  on  genetic  assessment  of  a  tumour biopsy  obtained  at disease 
progression.  The  four  agents  were  BKM120  (PI3K  inhibitor),  BGJ398  (FGFR  inhibitor),  INC280  (cMET 
inhibitor) and LEE011 (CDK 4/6 inhibitor). 
No primary efficacy endpoint was defined for Part 1 as it was designed as a run-in stage for Part 2 to 
allow  patients  initially  naïve  to  treatment  with  BRAF/MEK  inhibitors  (Group  A)  to  meet  the  Part  2 
eligibility criterion of being resistant to the MEK/BRAF inhibitor combination.  
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  Part  2  of  the  study  was  the  ORR,  defined  as  the  proportion  of 
patients  with  a  best  overall  response  [BOR]  of  CR  or  PR  as  determined  by  the  Investigator  using 
RECIST v1.1. The key secondary endpoint was PFS with other secondary endpoints of DOR, TTR (time 
to  response),  DCR  (disease  control  rate)  and  OS.  Evaluations  of  ORR,  PFS,  DOR,  TTR  and  DCR  were

also  performed  and  analysed  for  Part  1.  The  CSR  for  Part 1  presents data  for  Groups  A,  B  and  C  but 
the focus here is on data from Group A i.e. BRAF and MEK inhibitor-naïve patients. The FAS included all 
patients who received at least one dose of encorafenib or binimetinib and was used for the analysis of 
all endpoints unless noted otherwise. 
A total of 75 treatment-naïve patients were enrolled into Part 1 (Group A) of the study between 31 July 
2014  and  15  January  2016.  As  of  the  data  cut-off  (18  February  2016),  44  patients  (58.7%)  were 
ongoing  with  Combo  450  treatment.  The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  from  Combo  450 
study treatment was PD (25.3%). As of the data cut-off, 13 patients (17.3%) had continued to Part 2 
of the study.

Most  patients  were  Caucasian  (n=74,  98.7%),  and  there  were  more  males  enrolled  (n=  47,  62.7%) 
than females. The median age was 56 years and nearly a quarter were aged ≥65 years (n=18, 24%). 
Most patients had an ECOG PS of 0 (n=55, 73.3%) and had AJCC stage IV disease (93.3%) at study 
entry. Baseline LDH was high in 18.7% (n=14) of patients; however, 40 patients (53.3%) did not have 
a baseline LDH value reported as this was not required until Protocol Amendment 2 (November 2014). 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  skin  melanoma  as  the  primary  site  of  cancer  was  lower  than  in 
Columbus (82.7% vs >99%) but, conversely, the proportion of patients with an unknown primary site 
was higher (6.7%).  The most common sites of metastases were lymph nodes (70.7%), lung (57.3%), 
liver  (40.0%)  and  bone  (26.7%).  Brain  metastases  at  baseline  were  reported  in  5.3%  of  patients. 
Forty-percent  of  patients  had  received  prior-antineoplastic  medication.  More  patients  had  received 
prior  immunotherapy  with  ipilimumab  (21%)  than  in  study  B2301  (≤5%).  Patients  could  have  had 
prior systemic chemotherapy and 2.7% of treatment-naïve patients in Study CLGX818X2109 had prior 
treatment with alkylating agents (dacarbazine, dacarbazine citrate).

Protocol deviations in BRAF/MEK-treatment naïve patients were reported for 28.0% of patients, 4.0% 
were due to eligibility violations and 21.3% were assessment deviations. 
At data cut-off (18 February 2016), the median duration of exposure to study treatment for treatment 
naïve  patients  was  31.14  weeks  (range,  3.86  to  80.57).  The  confirmed  ORR  per  investigator  was 
69.3%  (95%  CI  57.9,  79.5).  Most  patients  experienced  disease  improvement  or  control,  as  the  DCR

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  pivotal  study  CMEK162B2301  (COLUMBUS)  was  a  Phase  3,  randomised,  open  label  study 
comprising  2  parts.  The  primary  endpoint  was  PFS  with  Combo  450  vs.  vemurafenib.  The  key 
secondary endpoint was PFS with Combo 450 vs. Enco 300 from Part 1 (plus PFS Combo 300 vs. Enco 
300  from  Part  2).  With  the  hierarchical  testing  procedure,  the  secondary  endpoint  of  OS  Combo  450 
vs.  vemurafenib  was  to  be  tested  only  if  these  comparisons  were  statistically  significant.  The  PFS 
analyses were conducted after more than the planned number of events had occurred [204 PFS events 
(planned 145) for Combo 450 vs. vemurafenib and 223 PFS events (planned 191) for Combo 450 vs. 
Enco 300]. 
The  DMC  reviewed  the  results  (and  unblinded  survival  data)  to  which  the  applicant  remained  blinded 
and recommended that the planned analyses be terminated and all patients be informed of the Part 1 
results.  Patients  in  the  vemurafenib  arm  were  to  be  advised  that  a  BRAF-MEK  inhibitor  combination 
might  be  a  better  alternative.    There  were  no  specific  recommendations  regarding  the  encorafenib 
monotherapy  arm.  The  OS  analysis  will  likely  be  confounded  by  patients  in  the  monotherapy  arms 
seeking alternative treatments. This early termination is probably inevitable as Combo 450 was being 
compared  to  single  agent BRAF  inhibitor  which  would  not  now  be  considered  standard  of  care  in  this 
setting.  Patients  with  V600  mutant  tumours  would  routinely  be  treated  with  a  BRAF-MEK  inhibitor 
combination. Still, it is accepted that at the time the trial was designed, the combination of BRAF/MEK 
inhibitor was not the SoC..  
The  study  was  open  label,  given  the  likelihood  of  functional  unblinding  from  the  predicted  treatment 
toxicities.  Efficacy  assessment  by  blinded  independent  review  was  appropriate  to  prevent  evaluation 
bias.  Progression  free  survival  as  the  primary  endpoint  is  accepted  as  a  meaningful  reduction  in  the 
risk  of  progression  or  death  represents  a  clinical  benefit  in  patients  with  BRAF  mutation-positive 
melanoma. It also allowed for more rapid assessment, mitigating the potentially confounding effects of 
post-study  treatments  on  OS.  Overall,  the  design  of  the  study  is  acceptable  and  the  study  was  well 
conducted.  
Supportive data is provided from Study CLGX818X2109 (LOGIC 2), an open-label, single arm, Phase 
2  trial.  Data  has  been  provided  from  a  subsection  of  patients  (n=75)  in  Part  1  –  Group  A  –  no  prior 
treatment with a BRAF inhibitor.  There was no pre-defined efficacy endpoint but ORR, PFS, DOR, TTR 
and DCR were evaluated and provided supportive evidence of efficacy. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  primary  endpoint  of  the  pivotal  study,  CMEK162B2301,  was  met  as  Combo  450  significantly 
improved  median  PFS  versus  vemurafenib  alone  (14.9  vs.  7.3  months)  based  on  BIRC  review  in  the 
full analysis set (FAS) with a HR of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.41, 0.71) (one-sided stratified log rank p<0.001) 
which was statistically significant. PFS curves separate early (after approximately 1-2 months) and do 
not intersect until near the end of follow-up where the number of patients in each arm is ≤ 4. Median 
follow-up  time  for  PFS  per  BIRC  was  16.7  months  for  the  Combo  450  arm  and  14.4  months  for  the 
vemurafenib  arm.  About  50%  of  patients  were  censored  at  the  time  of  the  analysis,  approximately 
30%  in  the  Combo  450  arm  due  to  remaining  on  treatment  and  20%  in  the  vemurafenib  arm  for 
starting a new anti-cancer therapy. As the DMC recommended termination of further analyses and all 
patients  in  the  vemurafenib  arm  receive  BRAF-MEK  inhibitor  combination  therapy  there  will  be  no 
further information on this direct comparison.

The  sensitivity  PFS  analyses  yielded  similar  HRs  (95%  CI)  and  median  PFS  values  to  the  primary 
analysis,  reflecting  the  robustness  of  the  PFS  benefit.  These  included  the  investigator  assessment  in 
the  FAS,  the  per  protocol  set  (PPS)  and  tumour  assessments  after  initiation  of  further  anti-cancer 
therapy.  The  efficacy  results  based  on  investigator  assessment  were  consistent  with  the  independent 
central assessment. 
Other than treatment, the only prognostic factor that significantly influenced PFS was LDH increase of 
125  IU/L.  The  PFS  benefit  was  consistent  across the  subgroups  analysed,  apart  from the  presence  of 
brain  metastases.  Only  12  patients  (9  Combo  450  and  3  vemurafenib)  had  brain  metastases  at 
baseline so there were insufficient patients to evaluate efficacy in this subgroup. All patients had BRAF 
mutant  V600  E  or  K  melanoma,  which  comprise  most  BRAF  mutant  patients  Across  the  3  treatment 
arms only 24 patients (3.7% of the Combo 450 arm) had received prior ipilimumab in the adjuvant or 
metastatic  setting  and  3  patients  (0.5%  of  the  Combo  arm)  had  received  a  prior  anti  PD1/PDL1 
inhibitor in the metastatic setting. The HR favoured Combo 450 in the small group of patients that had 
received  prior  immunotherapy  (n=15;  8  Combo  450  vs  7  vemurafenib)  although  the  confidence 
intervals were large. The use of Combo 450 in patients previously treated with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor 
is not supported. The median PFS in non-naïve patients in LOGIC 2 was 3.5 months. 
Results for overall survival have been presented from the OS interim analysis with cut-off date 7th 
November 2017, by which time a total of 232 OS events were observed in the Combo 450 and 
vemurafenib arms combined in Part 1 of the study. The median OS was 33.6 months (24.4, 39.2) and 
16.9 months (14.0, 24.5), respectively, for patients treated with Combo 450 compared to those 
treated with vemurafenib with a HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.47, 0.79, nominal p value <0.0001). The median 
OS was 33.6 months (24.4, 39.2) and 23.5 months (19.6, 33.6), respectively, for patients treated with 
Combo 450 compared to those treated with encorafenib with a HR 0.81 (95% CI 0.61, 1.06, nominal p 
value=0.0613). The observed HR and numerical increase in median OS supports the relevant 
contribution of binimetinib and demonstrates a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
improvement in overall survival with the combination treatment of binimetinib and encorafenib 
compared with vemurafenib. 
For  Combo  450  vs  vemurafenib  and  Combo450  vs  encorafenib,  results  of  the  planned  sensitivity 
analyses were consistent with those from the interim OS analysis and lead to similar conclusions about 
treatment effect. Most unstratified subgroup analyses also demonstrated median OS point estimates in 
favour of the Combo 450.  
For the key secondary efficacy endpoint, the median PFS estimates by BIRC in the FAS were 14.9 and 
9.6 months for Combo 450 and encorafenib, respectively, with a HR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.56, 1.00). The 
PFS  difference  of  5.3  months  just  missed  statistical  significance  (p  =  0.0256)  by  the  one-sided 
stratified log-rank test with a threshold of p < 0.025. Therefore, by the hierarchical testing procedure 
none  of  the  further  endpoints  can  be  considered  statistically  significant  and  nominal  p  values  are 
presented  for descriptive purposed  only.  Per  Investigator  assessment of  response,  the  PFS  difference 
between the Combo 450 and the encorafenib arm was consistent with that reported by the BIRC (14.8 
months Combo 450 vs. 9.2 months Enco 300) and this difference reached nominal significance at the 
one-sided  0.025  level  (HR  0.68;  95%  CI  0.52,  0.90;  nominal  1-sided  p=0.003).  The  subgroup 
analyses,  including  the  unstratified  HRs,  were  generally  consistent  with  the  analysis  in  the  full 
population,  allowing  for  wide  confidence  intervals  in  the  subgroups  with  small  numbers  of  patients.  
There were some groups with small patient numbers where the HR was greater than 1 (e.g. number of 
organs  involved  at  baseline  1  or  >3)  but  this  is  likely  due  to  chance.  Unstratified  subgroup  analyses 
demonstrated point estimates in favour of Combo 450, including LDH at baseline, ECOG performance 
status and AJCC stage. This supports benefit for the combination over single agent encorafenib, likely

due  to  the  increased  tolerability  of  encorafenib  with  a  MEK  inhibitor  allowing  a  higher  dose  of 
encorafenib  to  be  administered  (450mg  vs  300mg)  as  well  as  the  anti-tumour  contribution  of 
binimetinib itself.  
Part 2 of Study CMEK162B2301 was designed to assess the contribution of binimetinib to the 
encorafenib and binimetinib combination. Preliminary Part 2 data, at a cut-off date of 9 November 
2016, demonstrated the contribution of binimetinib with an improved median PFS estimate of 12.9 
months (95% CI: 10.1, 14.0) for Combo 300 compared to 9.2 months (95% CI: 7.4, 11.0) for Enco 
300 (Parts 1 and 2) per independent central review (BIRC). The confirmed ORR per BIRC was 65.9% 
(95% CI: 59.8, 71.7) for Combo 300 and 50.4% (95% CI: 44.3, 56.4) for Enco 300 (Parts 1 and 2). 
Median DOR for confirmed responses per BIRC was 12.7 months [95% CI: 9.3, 15.1] for Combo 300 
and 12.9 months [95% CI: 8.9, 15.5] for Enco 300. The median duration of treatment was longer for 
Combo 300 vs Enco 300, 52.1 weeks vs 31.5 weeks. The addition of binimetinib 45mg BID to 
encorafenib 300mg QD increased the median PFS by 3.7 months (stratified HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61, 
0.97; nominal 1-sided p=0.015) and the ORR by 15.5%. The investigator assessment and sensitivity 
analyses of PFS were similar. When only the patients randomised to Part 2 were assessed the results 
again supported a binimetinib contribution to efficacy; median PFS values (95% CI) were 12.9 months 
(10.1, 14.0) and 7.4 months (5.6, 9.2), respectively (HR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.78; nominal one-sided 
p<0.001 per stratified log-rank test). However, it is worth noting that the results for encorafenib 
monotherapy are better in part 1 than part 2 with a difference of over 2 months in median PFS. It is 
possible that differences in baseline characteristics (in particular age, stage of disease and elevated 
LDH) may be responsible for this difference in outcome. Some baseline imbalances can also be seen 
between Combo300 and Enco300 part 2. In particular, a greater proportion of the Enco 300 patients 
(Part 2) have Stage IV disease with elevated LDH compared with the Combo 300 patients.   
Therefore, for patients that must reduce the dose to 300 mg due to ADRs, the data seems to indicate 
that patients will continue to have a similar magnitude of treatment effect.  The proposed dose 
regimen in the applied indication is Combo 450 (binimetinib 45mg BID and encorafenib 450mg QD). 
Combo 450 (part 1, n=192) and Combo 300 (part 2, n=258) were compared post-hoc. Median PFS by 
BIRC was not statistically significantly longer with Combo 450 vs Combo 300 (14.9 months [95% CI 
11.0, 18.5] vs 12.9 months [95% CI 10.1, 14.0]; HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.60, 1.03]; one-sided log-rank 
p=0.0845) at the cut-off dates for initial analysis (19 May 2016 and 9 November 2016, respectively). 
Combo 450 did not increase the proportion of confirmed responses (63.0% vs. 65.9%), although the 
median duration of confirmed response was longer (16.6 vs. 12.7 months, with overlapping confidence 
intervals).  When Combo 450 and Combo 300 were compared at the same cut-off (9 November 2016) 
there had been an additional 5 PFS events in the Combo 450 arm; median PFS by BIRC was 15.5 vs. 
12.9 months (stratified HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.58, 1.01; 2-sided log rank p value 0.0573). However as 
noted above, patients enrolled to part 2 of the trial seem to have a worse prognosis than those in part 
1.  
The  confirmed  response  rate  (CR  +  PR)  was  higher  in the  Combo  450 group (63.0%)  compared  with 
encorafenib (50.5%) and vemurafenib (40.3%). Confirmed ORR in the small subgroup of patients with 
prior  first-line  immunotherapy  was  lower  but  showed  the  same  pattern  as  in  the  overall  population; 
Combo  450  (N=8)  50.0%;  encorafenib  (N=11)  45.5%;  vemurafenib  (N=7)  28.6%.  These  were  all 
partial  responses,  with  no  complete  responses  in  this  subgroup.  The  median  time  to  response  for 
responders in all treatment arms was short (1.9 – 2.1 months), which corresponds with the first post-
baseline  response  assessment  at  Cycle  3  Day  1.  The  median  duration  of  response  (DOR)  per  BIRC, 
calculated  for  confirmed  responses,  was  longer  in  the  Combo  450  arm  (16.6  months)  in  the  Combo 
450 arm than the encorafenib (14.9 months) or vemurafenib arms (12.3 months).

The PRO findings appeared supportive. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Melanoma (FACT 
M),  the  European  Organisation  for  Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer’s  core  quality  of  life 
questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C30) and the EuroQoL 5 Dimension 5 Level examination (EQ 5D 5L) were 
used  to  explore  patient-reported  outcomes  (PRO)  measures  of  health-related  Quality  of  Life, 
functioning,  melanoma  symptoms,  and  treatment-related  adverse  reactions.  A  definitive  10% 
deterioration  in  FACT  M  and  in  EORTC  QLQ-C30  was  significantly  delayed  in  patients  treated  with 
Combo 450 relative to other treatments. The median time to definitive 10% deterioration in the FACT-
M  score  was  not  reached  in  the  Combo  450  arm  and  was  22.1  months  (95%  CI:  15.2,  NE)  in  the 
vemurafenib  arm  with  a  HR  for  the  difference  of  0.46  (95%  CI:  0.29,  0.72).  An  analysis  of  time  to 
definitive 10% deterioration in EORTC QLQ C30 score provided with similar results. 
Patients  receiving  Combo 450  reported  no  change  or  a  slight  improvement  in  the  mean  change  from 
baseline  EQ  5D  5L  index  score  at  all  visits,  whilst  patients  receiving  vemurafenib  or  encorafenib 
reported  decreases  at  all  visits  (with  statistical  significant  differences).  An  evaluation  of  change  over 
time in score yielded the same trend for EORTC QLQ C30 and at all visit for FACT M).  
The results from the Phase 2 study CLGX818X2109 provided preliminary support regarding the efficacy 
of Combo 450 in the treatment of BRAF V600 mutant melanoma. The overall response rate (confirmed 
ORR) of 69.3% was similar but the median PFS was shorter (14.9 months in Study CMEK162B2301 vs. 
9.5 months in Study CLGX818X2109). This may be because the PFS data was not fully mature at the 
time of data cut off; median follow up time was 6.4 months compared to 16.7 months for the Combo 
450  arm  in  the  COLUMBUS  trial.  Tumour  assessments  were  performed  every  8  weeks  in  COLUMBUS 
compared to every 4 weeks in LOGIC 2.  
Binimetinib is to be given in combination with encorafenib. For additional information on warnings and 
precautions associated with encorafenib treatment, see section 4.4 of encorafenib SmPC. 
BRAF mutation testing 
Before taking binimetinib in combination with encorafenib, patients must have BRAF V600 mutation 
confirmed by validated test. The efficacy and safety of binimetinib in combination with encorafenib 
have been established only in patients with tumours expressing BRAF V600E and V600K mutations. 
Binimetinib in combination with encorafenib should not be used in patients with wild type BRAF 
malignant melanoma. 
Binimetinib in combination with encorafenib in patients who have progressed on a BRAF inhibitor 
There are limited data for use of the combination of binimetinib with encorafenib in patients who have 
progressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor given for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
with BRAF V600 mutation. These data show that the efficacy of the combination would be lower in 
these patients. 
Binimetinib in combination with encorafenib in patients with brain metastases 
There are limited efficacy data with the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib in patients with a 
BRAF V600 mutant melanoma which have metastasised to the brain (see section 5.1). 
The safety and efficacy of binimetinib in children and adolescents have not yet been established. No 
data are available. The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of 
studies with binimetinib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in melanoma (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall,  Combo  450  demonstrates  both  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  benefit  in 
PFS  over  the  comparator  vemurafenib  as  well  as  a  clinically  relevant  benefit  over  encorafenib 
monotherapy at its maximally tolerated monotherapy dose of 300 mg QD. The OS results of Part I of 
the COLUMBUS study demonstrate a statistically significant benefit favouring the Combo 450 treatment 
over vemurafenib. 
The  combination  therapy  of  binimetinib  and  encorafenib  showed  an  improved  efficacy  compared  to 
BRAF inhibitors given as monotherapies (vemurafenib and encorafenib) which is consistent with clinical 
data from other combination therapies of BRAF/MEK inhibition of patients with advanced or metastatic 
melanoma harbouring BRAF V600 mutations. 
The CHMP requests the following measures to address issues related to efficacy: 
−  OS results for Combo 300 and updated Combo 300 PFS analysis, including more mature data 
for the Enco300 Part 2 arm. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  data  from  a  total  of  864  patients  were  presented;  427  patients  received  binimetinib 
monotherapy and 437 patients received binimetinib in combination with encorafenib.  
As of 20 January 2016, a total of 2555 healthy subjects and patients have received at least 1 dose of 
binimetinib.  The  specific  combination  of  binimetinib  plus  encorafenib  has  been  evaluated  in  274 
patients with metastatic melanoma at the recommended doses of 450 mg once daily [QD] encorafenib 
and  45  mg  twice  daily  [BID]  binimetinib  (Combo  450),  with  121  (44.2%)  patients  exposed  to  this 
combination for ≥48 weeks. 
Data  from  5  supportive  clinical  trials  in  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma  were 
included for the safety evaluation of the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib for the treatment 
of patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600-mutant melanoma (Figure 23): 
• 3 clinical studies are pooled to summarise the safety of the combination 
• 2 clinical studies are pooled to summarise the safety of binimetinib monotherapy.

on treatment in the Combo 450°RP and in the Enco 300°P, respectively.  
Patient exposure 
As  of  20  January  2016,  a  total  of  2555  subjects  which  comprises  220  healthy  subjects,  164  patients 
with  rheumatoid  arthritis,  12  patients  with  hepatic  dysfunction  and  2159  patients  with  advanced 
cancer,  have  received  at  least  1  dose.  The  specific  combination  of  binimetinib  plus  encorafenib  has 
been  evaluated  in  274  patients  with  metastatic  melanoma  at  the  recommended  doses  of  45  mg  BID 
binimetinib and 450 mg QD encorafenib (Combo 450).  
The median duration of exposure was 11.7 months in patients treated with Combo 450, 7.1 months in 
patients treated with encorafenib 300 mg and 6.2 months in patients treated with vemurafenib. 
In the Combo 450 RP population, the median relative dose intensity of encorafenib and binimetinib was 
99.66% and 99.50%. The relative dose intensity in the Combo 450 RP population for encorafenib was 
100% for 123 patients (44.9%) and 100% for binimetinib in 109 patients (39.8%).  
The  median  relative  dose  intensity  for  encorafenib  remained  higher  in  the  Combo  450  RP  population 
compared to the Enco 300 P population (99.66% vs 84.98%) and a higher proportion of patients in the 
Combo  450  RP  population  had  a  relative  dose  intensity  of  100%  (44.9%  vs  28.6%).  The  median 
relative dose intensity (RDI) for Combo 450 was 99.6 % for binimetinib and 100 % for encorafenib the 
median RDI was 86.2 % for Enco 300 and 94.5 % for vemurafenib.

Bini P vs Combo 450 RP (pooled sets) 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  and  SAEs  was  similar  between  the  Combo 450 RP  population  and  Bini  P 
population but a lower proportion of patients in the Combo 450 RP population reported Grade 3/4 AEs 
(58%  vs  66.3%).  In  addition,  in  the  Combo  450  RP  population,  a  lower  proportion  of  patients 
compared  to  the  Bini  P  population  reported  AEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation,  AEs  requiring 
dose  interruption  or  additional  therapy  (discontinuation:  10.2%  vs  22.5%;  interruption:  47.1%  vs 
66.3%,  additional  therapy  86.1%vs  92.3%).  On-treatment  deaths  were  reported  in  a  similar 
proportion of patients in both arms. 
In  the  Bini  P  population,  the  maximum  reported  severity  of  AEs  was  Grade  1,  2,  3  and  4  for  6.1%, 
27.2%,  53.6%  and  13.1%  of  patients,  respectively.  In  the  Combo  450  RP  population,  the  maximum

reported  severity  of  AEs  was  Grade  1,  2,  3  and  4  for  10.2%,  30.7%,  48.2%  and  9.9%  of  patients, 
respectively, indicating less Grade 3 AEs (5.4% difference) than in the Bini P population. 
The median time to onset of first Grade ¾ AEs was longer in the combo 450 RP population than in the 
Bini P population (2.6 months (95% CI: 1.8, 3.2) vs 1.0 month (95% CI: 0.9, 1.3)) (Figure OS 1):

AEs  reported  in  ≥50%  of patients  in  the  Combo 450  RP  population  and  at  a higher  incidence  (≥10% 
difference) as compared to the Bini P population were reported under the SOC of musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (54.7% vs 36.8%). No Grade 3/4 AEs reported in ≥10% of patients in the

Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Treatment 
The  relationship  of  study  treatment  to  each  AE  (suspected  or  not  suspected)  was  evaluated  by  the 
investigator  and  treatment-related  AEs  that  were  reported  for  ≥20%  of  patients  in  any  study 
population by PT (overall and maximum Grade 3/4) for the Broad Safety Set are summarised below. 
Bini P vs Combo 450 RP (pooled sets) 
The  overall  incidence  of  treatment-related  AEs  and  Grade  3/4  AEs  was  lower  in  the  Combo  450  RP 
population than the Bini P population (AEs: 89.8% vs 97%; Grade 3/4 AEs: 33.2% vs 48.9%). 
In the Bini P population, treatment-related AEs reported in ≥20% of patients were blood CK increased 
(42.2%),  diarrhoea  (33.5%),  rash  (32.8%)  and  nausea  (21.3%).  The  only  treatment  related  Grade 
3/4 adverse event reported in ≥5% of patients was blood CK increased (20.4%). 
In  the  Combo  450  RP  population,  treatment-related  AEs  reported  in  ≥20%  of  patients  were  nausea 
(29.6%),  diarrhoea  (27%),  fatigue  (25.5%)  and  blood  CK  increased  (22.6%).  The  only  treatment 
related Grade 3/4 AE reported in ≥5% of patients was GGT increased (6.2%).

Treatment-related AEs reported at a higher incidence in the Combo 450 RP population than the Bini P 
population  (≥10%  difference)  were  arthralgia  (16.1%  vs  3.5%).  GGT  increased,  the  only  treatment-
related Grade 3/4 AE reported in ≥5% of patients in the Combo 450 RP population was reported at a 
higher incidence compared to the Bini P population (6.2% vs 0.2%). 
Treatment-related AEs reported at a higher incidence in the Bini P population than the Combo 450 RP 
population (≥10% difference) were blood CK increased (42.2% vs 22.6%), diarrhoea (33.5% vs 27%) 
and  rash  (32.8%  vs  10.2%).  The  only  treatment-related  Grade  3/4  AE  reported  in  ≥5%  of  patients 
were blood CK increased, which was also reported at a higher incidence compared to the Combo 450 
RP population (20.4% vs 4%). 
4-month update 
As of the 4-month safety update, the incidence of AEs assessed by the Investigator as related to study 
treatment  was  generally  consistent  with  the  trends  observed  in  summaries  of  all-cause  AEs  by 
treatment group and to that previously reported for the same population in the initial. 
The  overall  incidence  of  treatment-related  AEs  and  Grade  3/4  AEs  at  the  4-month  safety  update 
remained lower in the Combo 450 RP population compared to the Enco 300 P population (AEs: 98.9% 
vs 99.5%; Grade 3/4 AE: 61.3% vs 67.7%). The only relevant changes for incidences of individual AEs 
since the initial MAA were in the Combo 450 RP population: Arthralgia (27% vs 24.8%), Blood creatine 
phosphokinase (CK) increased (27.0% vs 24.8%) and back pain (10.9% vs 8.8%).

Severity of Adverse Events 
Bini P vs Combo 450 RP (pooled sets) 
In  the  Bini  P  population,  the  maximum  reported  severity  of  AEs  was  Grade  1,  2,  3  and  4  for  6.1%, 
27.2%, 53.6% and 13.1% of patients, respectively. 
In the Combo 450 RP population, the maximum reported severity of AEs was Grade 1, 2, 3 and 4 for 
10.2%,  30.7%,  48.2%  and  9.9%  of  patients,  respectively,  indicating  less  Grade  3  AEs  (5.4% 
difference) than in the Bini P population. 
When encorafenib was used at a dose of 300 mg once daily in combination with binimetinib 45 mg 
twice daily (Combo 300) in study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, the frequency category was lower compared 
to the pooled Combo 450 population for the following adverse reactions: anemia, peripheral 
neuropathy, haemorrhage, hypertension, pruritus (common) and colitis, increased amylase and 
increased lipase (uncommon). 
Adverse Events by Time of Onset 
Bini P vs Combo 450 RP (pooled sets). 
The median time to onset of first Grade 3/4 AEs was longer in the Combo 450 RP population than the 
Bini P population: 2.6 months (95% CI: 1.8, 3.2) vs 1.0 month (95% CI: 0.9, 1.3). 
Of note, a shorter time to onset was reported for the Combo BP population (1.8 months; 95% CI: 1.4, 
2.4) than the Combo 450 RP population. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI)  
These  were  identified  based  on  the  known  class  effects  of  MEK-  and  BRAF-  inhibitors  as  well  as 
emerging safety signals from the clinical program and health authority interactions. Table 70 and Table 
71 present an overview of AESIs by category (AESIs related to both drugs, specifically to encorafenib 
and  specifically  to  binimetinib)  and  grouping  (overall  and  Grade  3/4)  for  patients  in  the  three 
treatment arms of Study CMEK162B2301 and also includes separate columns for patients from the Bini 
45mg BID, Enco 300mg QD and the Combo 450 RP pooled doses population.

Retinal events 
Retinal events were reported in a higher incidence in the Combo 450 RP population compared to the 
Bini  P  population  but  this  tendency  was  reversed  when  considering  adjustment  for  study  drug 
exposure. However, regarding the PTs, retinal detachment was reported at a higher incidence for the 
binimetinib  monotherapy  (10.3%  Bini  P  vs  6.6%  Combo  450),  vision  blurred  for  the  combination 
therapy  (15.3%  Combo  450  vs  6.6%  Bini  P).  In  summary,  an  additive  adverse  effect  of  binimetinib 
and encorafenib regarding Retinopathy can be suggested. Grade 3 events occurred not very frequent 
and most of the events were transient, self-limiting and reversible and the proposed recommendations 
regarding  management  and  dose  modification  seem  to  be  acceptable.  However,  it  should  be  kept  in 
mind  that  events  under  the  PT  of  blindness  (in  the  grouping  of  retinopathy  excluding  RVO)  were 
reported  in  3  patients  in  Study  CMEK162B2301  Part  1  (2  patients  in  the  Combo  450  arm

[CMEK162B2301  Patient  4015-  015  and  CMEK162B2301  Patient  6085-003]  and  1  patient  in  the 
encorafenib  300mg  monotherapy  Part  1  arm  [CMEK162B2301  Patient  6085-005]).  In  the  Bini  P 
population, no cases of blindness were reported. 
Vascular  eye  events  (RVO)  as  potentially  sight–threatening  events  were  seen  only  in  the  Bini  P 
population  (2.1%).  In  contrast  uveitis-Type  AESIs  were  mainly  reported  for  the  Combo  450  RP 
population but only in a quite low incidence and in a mild severity 2.9%). 
Ocular events 
In  the  pooled Combo 450  population,  RPED  was  reported  in  29.6 %  (81/274)  of  patients.  RPED  was 
Grade  1  (asymptomatic)  in  21.2 %  (58/274)  of  patients,  Grade  2  in  6.6 %  (18/274)  of  patients  and 
Grade 3 in 1.8 % (5/274) of patients. Most events were reported as retinopathy, retinal detachment, 
subretinal  fluid,  macular  oedema,  and  chorioretinopathy  and  led  to  dose  interruptions  or  dose 
modifications in 4.7 % (13/274) of patients. The median time to onset of the first event of RPED (all 
grades) was 1.5 month (range 0.03 to 17.5 months).  
Visual impairment, including vision blurred and reduced visual acuity, occurred in 21.5 % (59/274) of 
patients. Visual impairment was generally reversible. 
Uveitis was also reported when binimetinib was used in combination with encorafenib (see section 4.8 
of encorafenib SmPC). 
In  Study  CMEK162B2301-Part  2,  in  the  Combo  300  arm,  RPED  was  observed  in  12.5%  (32/257)  of 
patients with 0.4% (1/257) Grade 4 event.  
Dermatologic reactions 
Dermatologic reactions may occur when binimetinib is used in combination with encorafenib. 
Rash  is  among  the  most  frequently  observed  AEs  reported  for  both  monotherapy  populations  (Bini  P 
82.7%,  Enco  P  51.2%)  and  is  reported  at  a  remarkably  lower  frequency  when  binimetinib  and 
encorafenib  are  combined  (Combo  450  RP  23.7%).  Compared  to  other  MEK/BRAF  inhibitor 
combinations  the  incidence  of  rash  seems  to  be  lower  for  the  combination  therapy  with  binimetinib 
and encorafenib. In addition, it should be kept in mind that, with regard to the preliminary data of part 
2 of the pivotal study, the incidence of rash seems to be lower in the Combo 300 mg population (7.0% 
vs 14.1%). In the pooled Combo 450 population, rash occurred in 19.7 % (54/274) of patients. Most 
events  were  mild,  with  Grade 3 or 4  events  reported  in  0.7 %  (2/274)  of  patients.  Rash  led  to 
treatment discontinuation in 0.4 % (1/274) of patients and to dose interruption or dose modification in 
1.1 % (3/274) of patients. 
In patients treated with Combo 450, dermatitis acneiform occurred in 4.4 % (12/274) of patients, was 
Grade 1 and 2 and no event led to treatment discontinuation. Dose modification was reported in 0.7 % 
(2/274) of patients.  
In  contrast,  palmar-plantar  Erythrodysaesthesia  (PPES)  is  reported  in  a  remarkably  higher  incidence 
for  the  encorafenib  monotherapy  (Enco  P  51.6%)  compared  to  the  Bini  P  (1.2%)  and  Combo  450 
RP (5.8%)  populations.  However,  according  to  the presented  data  of  part  2 of  the  pivotal  study,  the 
incidence  of  PPE  is  higher  with  the  lower  dose  of  encorafenib  (Combo  300).  PPES  can  occur  when 
binimetinib is used in combination with encorafenib. Please refer to the encorafenib SmPC. 
Photosensitivity reaction occurred in 4.7% of the patients in the Combo 450 arm in the pivotal study 
and was identified also as a relevant toxicity of binimetinib (and encorafenib) in the non-clinical trials. 
In  the  pooled Combo 450 population,  photosensitivity  was  observed  in  4.0 %  (11/274)  of  patients. 
Most events were Grade 1-2, with Grade 3 reported in 0.4 % (1/274) of patients and no event led to 
discontinuation. Dose interruption or dose modification was reported in 0.4 % (1/274) of patients.

The  incidence  of  skin  infections  was  remarkably  lower  in  the  Combo  450  RP  population  than  in  the 
Binimetinib  monotherapy  set  (11.3%-1.10  cases  per  100  patient-months  vs  17.3%-4.60  cases  per 
100 patient-months).  
Liver function test abnormalities AESIs were reported at a remarkably higher incidence in the Combo 
450  RP  population  than  in  the  Bini  P  population,  overall  (25.2%  vs  17.3%),  for  Grade  3/4  AESIs 
(12.4%  vs  4.2%)  and  for  AESIs  requiring  dose  adjustment/study  drug  interruption  (8.4%  vs  3%). 
Regarding the PTs, GGT increased was reported at a higher incidence for the encorafenib monotherapy 
and  the  combination  therapy  population  than  for  the  binimetinib  monotherapy  population  (Enco  P 
10.6%,  Combo  450 RP  13.9  %  vs  Bini  P  3.5%).  In  contrast  ALT/AST  increased  was  reported  in  a 
higher incidence for the binimetinib monotherapy and the combination therapy population than for the 
encorafenib monotherapy population.  
Liver laboratory abnormalities 
The incidences of liver laboratory abnormalities reported in the pooled Combo 450 population are listed 
below:  
• 
• 
Increased transaminases: 15.7% (43/274) overall – Grade 3-4: 5.5% (15/274) 
Increased GGT: 14.6% (40/274) overall – Grade 3-4: 8.4% (23/274) 
In Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, the incidences of liver laboratory 
abnormalities are listed below:  
• 
• 
Increased transaminases: 13.2% (34/257) overall – Grade 3-4: 5.4% (14/257) 
Increased GGT: 14.0% (36/257) overall – Grade 3-4: 4.7% (12/257) 
Elevation of blood CK 
Elevation of blood CK is a frequently observed laboratory finding associated with the administration of 
Binimetinib  45  mg  monotherapy  and  is  clinically  associated  sometimes  with  concomitant  muscular 
symptoms.  However,  the  addition  of  encorafenib  to  binimetinib  appears  to  mitigate  this  effect  as 
demonstrated  by  fewer  patients  in  the  Combo  450  RP  population  experiencing  CK  elevations  as 
compared  with  the  Bini  P  population  (24.8%-2.66  cases  per  100  patient-months  vs  44.7%-18.86 
cases per 100 patient-months), as well as a lower incidence of Grade 3/4 events, SAEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuation, AEs requiring dose interruption and/or change and AEs requiring additional therapy. 
In the pooled Combo 450 population, mostly mild asymptomatic blood CK elevation was reported in 
27.0 % (74/274) of patients. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 5.8 % (16/274). 
The median time to onset of the first event was 2.7 months (range: 0.5 to 17.5 months). 
Rhabdomyolysis was reported in 0.4 % (1/274) of patients treated with encorafenib in combination 
with binimetinib. In this patient, rhabdomyolysis was observed with concomitant symptomatic Grade 4 
CK elevation. 
In contrast, muscle-related AEs, including myalgia, is a frequently observed with the administration of 
Encorafenib 300 mg monotherapy. However, the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib appears 
to mitigate this effect as demonstrated by fewer patients in the Combo 450 arm experiencing muscle-
related AEs as compared with the encorafenib 300 mg monotherapy arm Part 1 (16.7% vs 31.3%), as 
well  as  a  distinctly  lower  incidence  of  Grade  3/4  events,  SAEs,  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  AEs 
requiring dose interruption and/or change and AEs requiring additional therapy.  
The incidence of cardiac events (a significant safety concern of Binimetinib monotherapy) was similar 
respectively lower after adjustment for treatment exposure in the Combo 450 RP population compared

to  the  Bini  P  population  (8.4%-0.79  case  per  100  patient-months  vs  11.2%-2.77  cases  per  100 
patient-months).  Grade  3/4  events  were  reported  at  a  remarkably  lower  incidence  in  the  Combo  450 
RP population than in the Bini P population (1.1% vs 4.2%). In addition, there were no events leading 
to study drug discontinuation in the Combo 450 RP population whilst 4.2% were reported in the Bini P 
population.  Few  events  were  serious  or  required  additional  therapy.  The  most  frequent  PT  in  both 
populations was ejection fraction decreased (Combo 450 RP 6.6% vs Bini P 10.3%).  
Overall, regarding the presented data of part 2 of the pivotal study CMEK162B2301 the frequency of 
patients with events in the left ventricular dysfunction grouping in the Combo 450 arm (7.8% [1.6% 
Grade  3/4])  seems  to  be  similar  to  that  in  the  Combo  300  arm  (5.8%  [1.2%  Grade  3/4],  showing 
equivalent  tolerability  between  these  2  Combo  dose  arms  and  with  no  increased  burden  to  patients 
with the higher encorafenib dose in the Combo 450 arm.  
Cardiac electrophysiology 
In the safety analysis of pooled studies of encorafenib 450 mg once daily in combination with 45 mg 
binimetinib twice daily (Combo 450), the incidence of new QTc prolongation > 500 ms was 0.7 % 
(2/268) in the encorafenib 450 mg plus binimetinib group, and 2.5 % (5/203) in the encorafenib single 
agent group. QTc prolongation of > 60 ms compared to pre-treatment values was observed in 4.9 % 
(13/268) patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, and in 3.4 % (7/204) in the encorafenib 
single agent group (see section 5.1 of encorafenib SmPC). 
Left ventricular dysfunction 
In the pooled Combo 450 population, LVD was reported in 8.4 % (23/274) of patients. Grade 3 events 
occurred in 1.1 % (3/274) of patients. LVD led to treatment discontinuation in 0.4% (1/274) of 
patients and led to dose interruptions or dose reductions in 6.6 % (18/274) of patients.  
The median time to first occurrence of LVD (any grade) was 4.4 months (range 0.03 to 21.3 months) 
in patients who developed an LVEF below 50 %. The mean LVEF value dropped by 5.9 % in the 
pooled Combo 450 population, from a mean of 63.9 % at baseline to 58.1 %. LVD was generally 
reversible following dose reduction or dose interruption. 
Venous thromboembolism 
In  patients  treated  with  Combo 450,  VTE  occurred  in  4.7 %  (13/274)  of  patients,  including  2.2 % 
(6/274)  of  patients  who  developed  pulmonary  embolism.  In  the  pooled Combo 450 population,  VTE 
was  reported  as  Grade 1 or 2  in  3.6 %  (10/274)  of  patients  and  Grade 3 or 4  in  1.1 %  (3/274)  of 
patients.  VTE  led  to  dose  interruptions  or  dose  modifications  in  1.1 %  (3/274)  patients  and  to 
additional therapy in 4.7 % (13/274) of patients. 
Hypertension 
Hypertension AESIs were reported at a similar incidence in the Bini P and Combo 450 RP populations 
overall, although the incidence was higher in the Bini P when adjusted for drug exposure (15.9%-4.49 
cases per 100 patient-months vs 12%-1.19 cases per 100 patient-months) and for Grade 3/4 events 
(8.7% vs 6.2%).   
In  Study  CMEK162B2301  the  incidence  of  a  2-grade  shift  in  LVEF  was  higher  in  in  the  hypertension 
risk factor group (=history of hypertension, SBP ≥140 at screening, or DBP ≥ 90 at screening) as well. 
Thus, severe hypertension should be controlled before initiating treatment with binimetinib.  
The  incidence  of  hypertension  AESIs  was  similar  in  the  Combo  450  and  vemurafenib  arms  of  the 
pivotal  study,  overall  (11.5%-1.01  cases  per  100  patient-months  vs  11.3%-1.49  cases  per  100 
patient-months) and for Grade 3/4 events (5.7% vs 3.2%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 138/182 
 
 
 
 
 
New onset elevated blood pressure or worsening of pre-existing hypertension were reported in 11.7 % 
(32/274) of patients treated with the Combo 450. Hypertension events were reported as Grade 3 in 
5.5 % (15/274) of patients, including hypertensive crisis (0.4 % (1/274)). Hypertension led to dose 
interruption or adjustment in 2.9 % of patients. Hypertensive adverse reactions required additional 
therapy in 8.0 % (22/274) of patients.  
Haemorrhage 
Haemorrhage AESIs were reported at a similar overall incidence in the Bini P, Enco P and Combo 450 
RP populations (11.5%-2.98 cases per 100 patient-months vs 12.9%-1.52 cases per 100 patient-
month vs 15.7%-1.55 cases per 100 patient months). Additionally, with regard to the preliminary data 
of part 2 of the pivotal study the incidence of haemorrhage events seems to be lower in the Combo 
300mg population compared to the Combo 450 mg arm (7.0% vs 18.2%).  
Haemorrhagic  events  were  observed  in  17.9 %  (49/274)  of  patients  in  the  pooled Combo  450 
population. Most of these cases were Grade 1 or 2 (14.6 %) and 3.3 % were Grade 3 or 4 events. Few 
patients requiring dose interruptions or dose reductions (0.7 % or 2/274). Haemorrhagic events led to 
discontinuation  of  treatment  in  1.1 %  (3/274)  of  patients.  The  most  frequent  haemorrhagic  events 
were  haematuria  in  3.3 %  (9/274)  of  patients,  rectal  haemorrhage  in  2.9 %  (8/274)  and 
haematochezia  in  2.9 %  (8/274)  of  patients.  Fatal  gastric  ulcer  haemorrhage  with  multiple  organ 
failure  as  a  concurrent  cause  of  death,  occurred  in  one  patient.  Cerebral  haemorrhage  occurred  in 
1.5 % (4/274) of patients with fatal outcome in 3 patients. All events occurred in the setting of new or 
progressive brain metastases.  
 In Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, haemorrhagic events were observed in 6.6% 
(17/257) of patients and were Grade 3-4 in 1.6% (4/257) of patients.  
Anaemia 
In  the  pooled Combo 450 population,  anaemia  was  reported  in  19.7 %  (54/274)  of  patients;  4.7 % 
(13/274)  of  patients  had  Grade 3  or  4.  No  patients  discontinued  treatment  due  to  anaemia,  1.5 % 
(4/274) required dose interruption or dose modification. 
In Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, anaemia was observed in 9.7% (25/257) of 
patients with Grade 3-4 reported in 2.7% (7/257) patients.  
Bradycardia and peripheral oedema 
Bradycardia  and  peripheral  oedema  have  been  identified  as  AESIs  for  binimetinib.  However,  the 
incidences  of  these  AESIs  are  remarkably  reduced  when  binimetinib  is  given  in  combination  with 
encorafenib. 
Pneumonitis  
AESIs were reported at a similar (low) overall incidence in the Bini P and Combo 450 RP populations.  
Facial paresis 
Facial paresis was reported when binimetinib was used in combination with encorafenib (see section 
4.8 of encorafenib SmPC). 
Increased heart rate and facial paresis have been identified as an AESI for encorafenib. However, the 
incidence  of  these  AESIs  is  remarkably  reduced  when  encorafenib  is  given  in  combination  with 
binimetinib. 
Renal dysfunction 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 139/182 
 
 
 
 
 
Blood creatinine elevation and renal failure occurred when binimetinib was used in combination with 
encorafenib (see section 4.8 of encorafenib SmPC). 
The incidence of renal failures seems to be similar in the presented safety populations. However, the 
severity  seems  to  be  slightly  higher  in  the  combo  450  RP  population  than  in  the  binimetinib  and 
encorafenib mono populations (incidence of Grade ¾ events: Bini P 0.5%, Enco P 1.4%, Combo 450 
1.8%). However, laboratory serum creatinine elevations were reported in most of the patients in the 
Combo 450 arm of the pivotal study (overall 92. 7%). Although most of the creatinine elevations seem 
to be asymptomatic, the grade ¾ elevations seem to result in renal failures.  
Cutaneous malignancies 
Secondary  skin  neoplasms  have  been  identified  as  an  AESI  for  encorafenib.  Regarding  the  data 
presented  (CMEK162B2301)  the  addition  of  binimetinib  to  encorafenib  appears  to  attenuate  the 
development  of  cutaneous  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (cuSCC)  as  compared  to  encorafenib  treatment 
alone (Combo 450 arm2.6% vs enco 300 arm 7.8%). 
Compared to vemurafenib cuSCC AESIs were reported at a distinctly lower incidence in the Combo 450 
arm (2.6%) than the vemurafenib arm (16.7%), overall, for Grade 3/4 events (none vs 6.5%) and for 
events  requiring  additional  therapy  (1%  vs  12.4%).  However,  compared  to  the  combination 
vemurafenib / cobimetinib the incidences seem to be similar. 
Cutaneous non-squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) events were reported in a low percentage of patients 
overall (2.1% Combo 450 arm, 1.0% encorafenib 300 arm, 2.7% vemurafenib arm). No melanoma 
events were reported for any patient in the Combo 450 arm while in the encorafenib 300 arm and 
vemurafenib arm, melanoma events occurred in a similar percentage of patients (5.2% encorafenib 
Part 1 arm, 4.3% vemurafenib arm). CuSCC was reported when binimetinib was used in combination 
with encorafenib (see section 4.8 of encorafenib SmPC). 
Compared to the combination dabrafenib/trametinib the incidence of pyrexia in the Combo 450 mg RP 
seem  to  be  distinctly  lower  (53%  vs  15.7%)  and  other  secondary  causes  were  generally  evident. 
However, it should be kept in mind that the most commonly reported SAE by PT in the Combo 450 arm 
of  Study  CMEK162B2301  Part  1  was  pyrexia  in  6  (3.1%)  patients.  None  of  the  6  patients  had 
concurrent  events  of  hypotension,  chills/rigors,  dehydration,  renal  failure  or  syncope  and  most  of  the 
patients  had  concurrent  factors  including  disease  progression  or  underlying  infection  which  may  have 
contributed to the pyrexia. 
Pancreatitis 
The pancreatic enzyme elevations in the combo 450 RP population (Lipase 4.7%, Amylase 2.9%) were 
mostly asymptomatic. Pancreatitis is an uncommon ADR (incidence <1%) when encorafenib is used in 
combination with binimetinib. Pancreatitis was reported when binimetinib was used in combination with 
encorafenib (see section 4.8 of encorafenib SmPC). 
Gastrointestinal disorders   
In the pooled Combo 450 population, diarrhoea was observed in 38 % (104/274) of patients and was 
Grade 3 or 4 in 3.3 % (9/274) of patients. Diarrhoea led to dose discontinuation in 0.4 % of patients 
and to dose interruption or dose modification in 4.4 % of patients. Constipation occurred in 24.1 % 
(66/274) of patients and was Grade 1 or 2. Abdominal pain was reported in 27.4 % (75/274) of 
patients and was Grade 3 in 2.6 % (7/274) patients. Nausea occurred in 41.6 % (114/274) with 
Grade 3 or 4 observed in 2.6 % (7/274) of patients. Vomiting occurred in 28.1 % (77/274) of patients 
with Grade 3 or 4 reported in 2.2 % (6/274) of patients. 
Assessment report

In Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, nausea was observed in 27.2% (70/257) of 
patients and was Grade 3 in 1.6% (4/257) of patients. Vomiting occurred in 15.2% (39/257) of 
patients with Grade 3 reported in 0.4% (1/257) of patients. Diarrhoea occurred in 28.4% (73/257) of 
patients with Grade 3 reported in 1.6% (4/257) of patients.  
Gastrointestinal disorders were typically managed with standard therapy. 
Headache 
In the pooled Combo 450 population, headache occurred in 21.5% (59/274) of patients including 
Grade 3 in 1.5% (4/274) of patients.  
In Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, headache was reported in 12.1% (31/257) of 
patients and was Grade 3 in 0.4% (1/257) of patients. 
Fatigue 
In the pooled Combo 450 population, fatigue occurred in 43.8% (120/274) of patients including Grade 
3 in 2.9% (8/274) of patients.  
In Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, fatigue was observed in 33.5% (86/257) of 
patients with 1.6% (4/257) Grade 3-4 events. 
Combo BP versus Combo 450 RP: 
The overall safety profile (as of 09 November 2016 data cutoff) of overall AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to 
treatment  discontinuation  is  similar  between  Combo  BP  and  Combo  450  RP  populations.  Discrete  AE 
PTs reported in the Combo BP but not in Combo 450 RP occurred at an incidence of <1%, were non-
specific, and no new safety concerns were identified from the Combo BP.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
On-treatment deaths for all studies included in the Broad Safety Set were collected while patients were 
on treatment or within 30 days of the last dose of study drug. 
Table 65 presents a summary of on-treatment deaths (occurring during treatment or within 30 days of 
the last dose) by PT for the Broad Safety Set.  
Bini P vs Combo 450 RP (pooled sets) 
The  overall  incidence  of  on-treatment  deaths  (with  or  without  adjustment  for  study  drug  exposure) 
was lower in the Combo 450 RP population compared to the Bini P population (8.4% vs 10.8%), with 
EAIR of deaths per 100 patient-months of 0.74 vs 2.45 and with most deaths in both populations due 
to progression of malignant melanoma (5.8% Combo 450 vs 9.4% Bini P). 
The higher incidence of deaths not related to progression in the Combo 450 RP population is due to the 
higher exposure duration to Combo 450 than to binimetinib alone. 
Overall two deaths due to AE (sepsis and multiorgan failure) and 10 deaths due to disease progression 
occurred within 30 days of the first dose of study drug in the Bini P population and a single death (due 
to AE: completed suicide) occurred within 30 days of the first dose of study drug in the Combo 450 RP 
population (Combo 450 arm of study CMEK162B2301). 
Combo 450 vs vemurafenib (Study CMEK162B2301) 
The  overall  incidence  of  on-treatment  deaths  (with  or  without  adjustment  for  study  drug  exposure) 
was  slightly  lower  in  the  Combo  450  arm  (8.9%,  with  an  EAIR  of  deaths  per  100  patient-months  of 
Assessment report

0.71) than the vemurafenib arm (10.2%, with an EAIR of deaths per 100 patient-months of 1.23), with 
most deaths in both arms due to progression of malignant melanoma (5.2% vs 9.1%). 
In  the  Combo  450  arm,  one  death  (completed  suicide)  occurred  within  30  days  of  the  first  dose  of 
study drug vs no deaths in the vemurafenib arm.

Deaths related to adverse events in patients treated with Combo (450-600 mg) 
In the Broad Safety Set, a total of 7 patients receiving Combo 450 mg or 600 mg died due to events 
other  than  disease  progression  (malignant  melanoma/metastases),  including  6  patients  in  Study 
CMEK162B2301 and 1 patient in Study CMEK162X2110. A summary of on-treatment deaths considered 
due to an AE is provided in Table 74. 
Table 74:  On-Treatment Deaths Considered Due to an Adverse Event (Combo

Deaths in the Other On-going Studies 
Of  the  30  patients  treated  in  Compassionate  Use  Protocols  and  Investigator-sponsored  trials  with 
single-agent binimetinib, single-agent encorafenib or the combination of encorafenib plus binimetinib in 
the  relevant  NRAS/BRAF-mutant  metastatic  melanoma  population,  11  patients  (all  treated  with 
binimetinib) had SAEs with a fatal outcome. Of these 11 patients, 6 fatal outcomes were due to PD, 1 
was due to an SAE of pneumonia (only PT reported as related to the study drug by the Investigator) 
and  sepsis,  1  was  due  to  an  SAE  of  ileus  and  multi-organ  failure  and  3  others  provided  no  further 
information other than patient death. The SAE of pneumonia was the only reported as related with the 
study drug.

A summary of SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported for ≥2% of patients in 
any  population  by  PT  (overall  and  Grade  3/4  maximum)  for  the  Broad  Safety  Set  are  presented  in

Comparison of the Safety Profile of Combo 300 and Combo 450   
The safety profile comparison is based on the 192 patients randomised to the Combo 450 arm as of 
the 19 May 2016 cut-off date (Part 1) and the 258 patients randomised to the Combo 300 arm (one of 
whom was not treated) as of the 09 November 2016 cut-off date (Part 2).  
The median durations of potential follow-up for PFS of 16.7 months for Combo 450 part 1 and 13.9 
months for Combo 300 part 2 were broadly comparable. The median duration of exposure in the 
Combo 450 arm and Combo 300 arms were similar with 52.6% and 54.9% of patients having received 
≥ 48 weeks of study treatment, respectively.  
In the Combo300, the median relative dose intensity (RDI) of encorafenib and binimetinib was 100% 
and 99.76% respectively, similar to the median RDI of encorafenib and binimetinib in the Combo450.  
The overall safety profiles for the Combo 450 and Combo 300 arms are similar in terms of incidence 
(difference <5%) of deaths, AEs, treatment discontinuation due to AEs and AEs leading to dose 
modifications/ interruptions or additional therapy. The overall incidence of Grade 3-4 AEs, as well as 
the overall incidences of SAEs, was lower in the Combo 300 as compared to Combo 450.

The increase in GI events in the Combo 450 arm did not have a big impact on the renal function; PTs 
of renal failure, blood creatinine increased and clinically notable shifts from baseline of creatinine lab 
parameter were similar in both arms. Worsening creatinine from baseline by at least 2 grades or to ≥ 
Grade 3 occurred for 17.7 % of patients in the Combo 300 vs 17.1% in the Combo 450. Worst post-
baseline Grade 3 increased creatinine values occurred in 1.6% in the Combo 300 arm vs 3.6% in the 
Combo 450. 
The overall incidence of SAEs was lower (difference <5%) in the Combo 300 arm as compared to 
Combo 450 arm (29.7% vs 34.4%). The most frequently reported SAEs that were ≥ 2.0% of patients 
in either treatment group occurred under the SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders (3.1% Combo 300 
arm, 9.4% Combo 450), infections and infestations (6.2% Combo 300 arm, 8.9% Combo 450), 
general disorders and administration site conditions (3.5% Combo 300 arm, 8.3% Combo 450) and 
nervous system disorders (Combo 450 arm 8.2% Combo 300 arm, 7.3%). 
The incidence of on-treatment deaths was similar between the treatment groups (9.7% Combo 300 
arm, 9.9% Combo 450). Most on-treatment deaths were considered due to disease progression. In the 
Combo 300 arm and the Combo 450 group, 3 (1.2%) and 2 (1.0%) on-treatment deaths, respectively, 
were considered due to AEs other than disease progression (malignant melanoma/metastases). 
The percentage of patients with AESIs (any grade) considered common to both drugs was higher in the 
Combo 450 arm compared with the Combo 300 arm (66.1% vs 51.4%). The mitigating effect of 
adding binimetinib to encorafenib remined evident for PTs of retinal or pigment epithelium detachment,

retinopathy (excluding retinal vein occlusion), rash, LFT abnormalities, haemorrhage and hypertension 
were more common for Combo 450 vs Combo 300.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In both the Bini P and Combo 450 RP populations, decreased haemoglobin was the most common new 
or worsened haematology abnormality and decreases were mostly Grade 1, with no Grade 4 decreases 
reported  (Grade  1:  47.1%  vs  32.1%  of  patients,  respectively;  Grade  2:  14.2%  vs  10.5%;  Grade  3: 
2.9%  vs  4.5%).  In  both  populations,  decreases  in  leukocyte  count  and  lymphocyte  count  were  also 
reported  in  ≥10%  of  patients  (for  any  CTCAE  grade)  but  were  mostly  Grade  1/2.  All  other  abnormal 
decreases  or  increases  in  the  Combo  450  RP  populations  were  reported  in  <10%  of  patients  for  any 
CTCAE  grade,  whilst  decreases  in  neutrophil  and  platelet  counts  and  increases  in  activated  partial 
thromboplastin time (mostly Grade 1) were also reported in ≥10% of patients in the Bini P population.

No  new  or  worsened  haematology  abnormality  was  reported  at  a  higher  incidence  in  the  Combo 450 
RP  than  in  the  Bini  P  population  whilst,  additionally  to  Grade  1  decreased  haemoglobin  (see  above), 
Grade  1  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  was  reported  at  a  higher  incidence  in  the  Bini  P 
population than in the Combo 450 RP population. 
Similarly, in both Combo 450 and vemurafenib arms of Study CMEK162B2301, decreased haemoglobin 
was  the  most  common  new  or  worsened  haematology  abnormality  and  decreases  were  mostly  Grade 
1, with no Grade 4 reported (Grade 1: 30.7% vs 36.2% of patients, respectively; Grade 2: 10.9% vs 
7.3%;  Grade  3:  3.7%  vs  2.2%).  Grade  1-3  decreased  lymphocyte  count  was  reported  at  a  lower 
incidence in the Combo 450 arm than in the vemurafenib arm.  
Grade 1 decreased platelet count was the only haematology abnormality reported at a higher incidence 
in the Combo 450 arm than in the vemurafenib arm (8.6% vs 2.8%). 
Biochemistry 
In both the Bini P and Combo 450 RP populations, increased creatinine was the most common new or 
worsened biochemistry abnormality and increases were mostly Grade 1 (Grade 1: 79.5% vs 79.2% of 
patients, respectively; Grade 2: 5.3% vs 15.2%; Grade 3: 0.5% vs 3%; Grade 4: 0.7% vs none).  
Grade 2 increased creatinine was the only biochemistry abnormality reported at a higher incidence in 
the Combo 450 RP population than in the Bini P population.  
Grade 1 increased ALT and AST were reported at a higher incidence in the Bini P population than in the 
Combo 450 RP population (40.8% vs 23.6% and 69.4% vs 25.1%) as well as Grade 3 and 4 increased 
CK (14.5% vs 3.4% and 8.7% vs 0.8%, respectively). 
Safety in special populations 
Age, gender and race 
Overall, there were no clinically important effects of age on the safety of binimetinib, or on the safety 
of  binimetinib  in  combination  with  encorafenib.  Subgroups  defined  for  the  reporting  of  AEs  were  age 
(<65 vs ≥65 years, <75 vs >75 years), gender and race (Caucasian vs Asian vs Other) and baseline 
brain  metastases.  No  clinically  relevant  differences  were  observed.  No  safety  trends  or  differences 
were  observed  in  this  subgroup  as  compared  to  the  overall  patient  population  in  Study 
CMEK162B2301.

Study CMEK162A2104 was a dedicated study investigating the PK of binimetinib in hepatic impairment 
subjects,  as  defined  by  the  NCI  Organ  Dysfunction  Working  Group,  versus  healthy  subjects.  Results 
indicate that, compared to healthy subjects, the exposure of binimetinib is not significantly altered in 
subjects  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  but  is  increased  2-fold  in  subjects  with  moderate  and  severe 
hepatic impairment. Due to the increase in exposure observed in the moderate impairment cohort, the 
dose was reduced to 15 mg in the severe impairment cohort. All AEs reported in Study CMEK162A2104 
were  mild  or  moderate,  except  for  1  Grade  3  AE  of  motor  vehicle  accident  deemed  not  related,  and 
were generally consistent with previous AEs observed following binimetinib administration (headache, 
constipation,  abdominal  pain,  vision  blurred).  Based  on  the  results  of  the  clinical  study,  the  dose  in 
moderate  and  severe  hepatic  impairment  is  proposed  to  be  30  mg  BID.    This  dose  results  in  a  dose 
corresponding  to  60mg  BID  in  normal  patients.  The  60mg  BID  dose,  however,  was  not  developed 
further  during  the  clinical  programme  as  AEs  were  observed.  No  significant  differences  have  been 
noted  between  healthy  subjects  and  those  with  mild  hepatic  impairment,  therefore,  no  dose 
adjustment  is  required.  A  hepatic  impairment  study  has  been  performed.    Based  on  these  study 
results,  popPK  modelling  was  performed  to  simulate  different  dosing  regimens  for  patients  with 
moderate  and  severe  HI.  Considering  total  binimetinib,  as  15mg  TID  dosing  could  be  appropriate. 
However,  considering  the  unbound  drug  concentrations  which  were  impaired  to  a  higher  degree  with 
increasing  hepatic  impairment,  then  a  dose  adjustment  to  15mg  BID  was  more  reasonable,  and  it 
therefore proposed.  Recommendations are required for dose reductions in case of adverse reactions in 
patients with HI.  
In  the  Combo  450  RP  population,  there  was  no  increase  in  notable  hepatic  laboratory  values  in  the 
patients with liver metastases as compared with patients without liver metastases. 
Renal impairment 
The effect of renal impairment on binimetinib exposure was assessed in a dedicated clinical study with 
an abbreviated design (Study ARRAY-162-106). Results from the severe impairment cohort (eGFR ≤29 
mL/min/1.73  m2),  indicate  an  approximate  29%  increase  in  exposure  (AUCinf)  and  21%  increase  in 
Cmax  compared  to  matching  healthy  subjects.  Based  on  the  results  in  the  severely-impaired  cohort 
compared  to  matching  healthy  subjects  in  Study  ARRAY-162-106,  no  dose  adjustment  is  required  in 
subjects with renal impairment. 
The following subgroup analyses were also performed: 
•  Hepatic  lab  test  abnormalities–  in  the  Combo  450  RP  population  there  was  no  increase  in  notable 
hepatic laboratory values in the patients with liver metastases as compared with patients without liver 
metastasis.  In  the  Bini  P  population,  more  patients  with  liver  metastases  had  notable  hepatic 
laboratory  values  (ALT,  AST,  ALP)  as  compared  with  the  overall  population  and  patients  with  no  liver 
metastases;  however,  there  were  still  limited  numbers  of  patients  overall  with  notable  hepatic 
laboratory values. 
• LVEF – in the Combo 450 RP population, there was no difference in the incidence of “worst change 
from baseline” in LVEF between those with or without baseline risk factors (cardiac risk, hypertension, 
LVD  risk)  and  a  small  difference  in  the  incidence  of  “shift”  in  LVEF,  with  more  Combo  450-treated 
patients without baseline risk factors having Grade 2/3 shifts than patients with baseline risk factors. 
•  Cardiac  enzymes  –  more  Combo  450-treated  patients  who  did  not  receive  concomitant  statin 
treatment had a 2-Grade worst shift in CK than patients who did receive concomitant statin treatment.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Currently, safety data for binimetinib is assessable from a total of 2555 healthy subjects and patients. 
They  have  received  at  least  1  dose  of  binimetinib  including  220  healthy  subjects,  164  patients  with 
rheumatoid  arthritis,  12  patients  with  hepatic  dysfunction  and  2159  patients  with  advanced  cancer 
have received at least one dose. 
Safety  data  from  a  total  of  860  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma  are  presented. 
Binimetinib 45 mg BID as monotherapy was evaluated in 427 patients with metastatic melanoma with 
7%  of  patients  receiving  ≥48  weeks  of  study  treatment.  The  recommended  combination  dose  of 
binimetinib 45mg BID and encorafenib 450 mg QD (Combo 450) was evaluated in 274 patients treated 
for metastatic melanoma with 44.2% of patients receiving ≥48 weeks of study treatment. The overall 
size  of  the  safety  data  set  and  the  extent  of  exposure  are  sufficient  to  characterise  the  safety  of 
binimetinib  at  the  dose  of  45  mg  BID  as  monotherapy  and  in  combination  with  encorafenib  450  mg 
QD.  Combo  450  is  intended  for  treatment  of  advanced  or  metastatic  BRAF-mutated  melanoma,  a 
serious and life-threatening condition.  
Furthermore,  a  “broad  combination  safety  pool”  (Combo  BP)  was  defined  which  includes  pooled  data 
from 437 patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma enrolled at or randomized to a dose 
of 45 mg BID binimetinib plus various doses of encorafenib, ranging from 400 mg QD to 600 mg QD 
(192  patients  from  Study  CMEK162B2301  [Part  1],  158  patients  from  Study  CLGX818X2109  and  87 
patients from Study CMEK162X2110).  
For  this  submission,  the  restricted  combination  safety  pool  (Combo  450  RP)  and  the  binimetinib 
monotherapy safety pool (Bini P) provide the most clinical relevant safety data.  
The  median  duration  of  exposure  to  study  treatment  was  respectively  13.0  weeks  in  the  bini  P 
population  (mostly  NRAS  mutant  melanoma)  and  41.9  weeks  in  the  Combo  450  RP  BRAF  melanoma 
population.  The  median  duration  of  exposure  to  study  treatment  was  longer  in  the  Combo  450  arm 
than  in  the  encorafenib  and  vemurafenib  arms  of  Study  CMEK162B2301,  (51.2  weeks  vs  31.4  weeks 
vs 27.1 weeks). 
Despite  the  higher  dose  intensity  and  more  than  3  times  longer  duration  of  exposure  in  Combo  450 
patients compared with Bini P population, a better tolerability of Combo 450 vs binimetinib alone was 
observed. A lower percentage of patients experienced at least one, grade3/4 AE (58.0% vs 66.7%), AE 
leading to treatment discontinuation (10.2% vs 24.1%), AE requiring dose interruption/change (47.4% 
vs  66.7%)  and  AE  requiring  additional  therapy  (86.1%  vs  92.3%).  The  percentage  of  patients  who 
experienced  at  least  one  SAE  was  similar  in  the  two  populations,  (35.8%  vs  33.0%),  regardless  of 
causal relationship to study drugs.  
In Study CMEK162B2301, despite a 50% longer median duration of treatment in the Combo 450 arm 
than in the vemurafenib arm, a better tolerability of Combo 450 vs vemurafenib alone was observed. A 
lower percentage of patients experienced at least one, grade 3/4 AE (57.8% vs. 63.4%), AE leading to 
treatment  discontinuation  (12.5%  vs  16.7%),  AE  requiring  dose  interruption/reduction  (47.9%  vs 
61.3%)  and  AE  requiring  additional  therapy  (85.9%  vs  91.9%).  In  addition,  a  similar  percentage  of 
patients experienced SAEs (34.4% vs 37.1%).

Similarly, in Study CMEK162B2301, despite a 60% longer median duration of treatment in the Combo 
450  arm  compared  to  the  Enco  300  arm  a  better  tolerability  of  Combo  450  vs  Enco  300  alone  was 
observed. A lower percentage of patients experienced at least, one grade 3/4 AE (57.8% vs 66.1%), 
AE  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  (12.5%  vs  14.1%),  AE  requiring  dose  interruption/change 
(47.9% vs 70.3%) and AE requiring additional therapy (85.9% vs 94.3%). The percentage of patients 
who experienced at least one SAE was similar (34.4% vs 33.9%) in the two populations, regardless of 
causal relationship to study drugs. 
There is no study with a direct comparison of Combo 450 and binimetinib 45 mg BID, however indirect 
comparison  showed  a  more  favourable  tolerability  profile  for  Combo  450  than  that  reported  for 
binimetinib  45  mg  BID  monotherapy.  The  overall incidence of  AEs  and  SAEs  was  similar  between  the 
Combo 450 RP population and  Bini P population but a lower proportion of patients in the Combo 450 
RP population reported Grade 3/4 AEs (58% vs 66.3%). In addition, in the Combo 450 RP population, 
a  lower  proportion  of  patients  compared  to  the  Bini  P  population  reported  AEs  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation,  AEs  requiring  dose  interruption  or  additional  therapy  (discontinuation:  10.2%  vs 
22.5%; interruption: 47.1% vs 66.3%, additional therapy 86.1%vs 92.3%). On-treatment deaths were 
reported in  a  similar  proportion  of patients  in both  arms.  The  median  time  to  onset  of  first  AEs  resp. 
SAEs was longer in the combination population than in the binimetinib monotherapy population. 
The  safety  and  tolerability  of  binimetinib  in  combination  with  encorafenib  appear  favourable  and 
acceptable as compared to vemurafenib regarding the observed benefit. The majority of the reported 
ADRs  reflects  the  common  AEs  observed  in  the  clinical  programme  of  binimetinib  45  mg  BID 
monotherapy  and  binimetinib  45  mg  BID  given  in  combination  with  encorafenib  450  mg  QD.  The 
addition  of  binimetinib  45  mg  BID  in  the  combination  allows  for  the  administration  of  encorafenib  at 
the  dose  of  450  mg  QD.  The  observed  toxicities  of  the  combination  are  generally  manageable  and 
acceptable  in  the  population  of  adult  patient  with  metastatic  or  unresectable melanoma  harbouring  a 
BRAF mutation, and no prior therapy. 
A comparison of the safety results of Combo 450 in Study  CMEK162B2301 with those of the recently 
approved  BRAF/MEK  inhibitor  combinations  vemurafenib/cobimetinib  and  dabrafenib/trametinib  in 
pivotal Phase 3 studies is presented in the table below. The studies were broadly comparable in terms 
of  the  demographic  and  disease  characteristics  of  patient  populations  and  in  terms  of  study  design. 
Vemurafenib, the comparator used in Study CMEK162B2301 had a safety profile similar to that of other 
trials  using  vemurafenib  as  a  comparator15,17,  23).  For  the  combination,  similar  rates  of  AEs  overall, 
grade  ≥3  AEs  treatment-related  AEs,  serious  AEs,  and  AEs  leading  to  death,  or  to  dose 
interruptions/modifications or to treatment discontinuation compared to COMBI-v and similar or higher 
incidences of these events in Study CMEK162B2301 compared to coBRIM. 
A  4-month  update  of  the  safety  profile  was  provided  with  the  responses.  The  updated  safety  data 
provided with additional follow-up shows a similar safety profile for the Combo 450 as demonstrated in 
the  initial  submission.  New  ADRs  of  blood  creatinine  increased,  renal  failure  and  GGT  increased  for 
encorafenib  in  combination  with  binimetinib,  and  blood  creatinine  increased  for  encorafenib  single 
agent, have been added to the proposed SmPC since the initial submission. 
Combo 450 vs Combo 300 
The median duration of exposure in the Combo 450 and Combo 300 arms were similar with, 
respectively, 52.6% and 54.9% of patients having received ≥ 48 weeks of study treatment.

The overall tolerability profiles of these two combinations were broadly similar (for AEs requiring 
discontinuation, dose modifications or additional therapy) but Combo 450 led to an increased incidence 
of SAEs and Grade 3-4 AEs. Combo 450 generated an increased incidence of the most common side 
effects compared to Combo 300, particularly nausea (41.1 vs. 27.2%), vomiting (29.7 vs. 15.2) and 
headache (21.9 vs. 11.7%).  
The median time to onset of key tolerability parameters was longer in the Combo 300 arm compared 
with the Combo 450 arm for:  
- First SAE (3.5 vs 4.7 months respectively)  
- First AE resulting in study drug discontinuation (3.8 vs 4.7 months respectively) 
The percentage of patients with one or more encorafenib AESI (any grade) was similar in the two 
populations (14.6% vs 14.4%). Surprisingly, the percentage of patients with one or more binimetinib 
specific AESIs (any grade) was higher too in the Combo 450 arm compared with the Combo 300 arm 
(69.3% vs 56.8% respectively). However, the incidence of binimetinib specific AESIS leading to drug 
discontinuation or drug modification were similar between Combo 450 and Combo 300. This may be 
due to a rather arbitrary allocation of AESI between encorafenib and binimetinib in the original 
assessment, which has since been changed/ rectified. Retinopathy (excluding retinal vein occlusion), 
rash, liver function tests (LFT) abnormalities, haemorrhage and hypertension were more common for 
Combo 450 vs Combo 300. 
This is comparison of Combo 450 vs. Combo 300 is a post-hoc analysis and patients were recruited at 
different times (30 Dec 2013 to 10 Apr 2015 for Combo 450 and 19 March 2015 to 12 Nov 2015 for 
Combo 300). It is possible that investigators had more experience in treating/ preventing AEs by the 
time of recruitment to Combo 300; given that different centres participated in Part 1 and Part 2 of the 
study it is more likely that the difference is simply due to the encorafenib dose. 
As  for  other  MEK  and  BRAF  inhibitors24,  several  main  toxicities  are  presumed  to  be  class  effects  and 
are defined as AESIs for the clinical development of binimetinib and encorafenib. 
The  AESI  groupings  common  to  both  binimetinib  and  encorafenib  reported  and  analysed  include  the 
following: 
Ocular  AESI  groupings:  retinopathy  (mainly  due  to  binimetinib)  excluding  RVO,  RVO  and  uveitis-type 
events (mainly due to encorafenib) 
•  Dermatologic-related  AESI  groupings:  rash  (photosensitivity,  nail  disorders,  skin  infections, 
severe cutaneous adverse reactions) and PPE syndrome (mainly due to encorafenib) 
• 
Liver-related AESI groupings: liver function test abnormalities and hepatic failure 
•  Myopathy/rhabdomyolysis-related  AESI  groupings:  muscle  enzyme/protein  changes  (mainly 
due to binimetinib), myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (mainly due to encorafenib) 
The AESI groupings relating to binimetinib alone reported and analysed in this Application include the 
following: 
•  Cardiac-related AESI groupings: (bradycardia) and left ventricular dysfunction; 
•  Hypertension 
•  Haemorrhage

Regarding the incidences and severities of the known BRAF and MEK inhibitor AESIs, the tolerability of 
the MEK inhibitor binimetinib seems to be remarkably better when given in combination with the BRAF 
inhibitor encorafenib. 
However,  the  incidence  of  retinopathies,  liver  function  test  abnormalities  and  haemorrhage  events 
seems to be higher. This point should be kept in mind as these AESIs (at least retinopathies and liver 
function  test  abnormalities)  resulted  in  the  reduction  of  the  RP2D  to  45  mg  BID  in  the  binimetinib 
monotherapy.  Preliminary data of part 2 of the pivotal study indicate a better tolerability in the Combo 
300mg population regarding retinopathies, liver function test abnormalities and haemorrhage events. 
Specifically, for binimetinib, the most important risks associated with binimetinib treatment defined by 
ADRs  in  the  proposed  patient  population  are  described  below.  This  includes  data  from  monotherapy 
trials conducted for binimetinib. Descriptions of the events during use in combination with encorafenib 
are also included below. 
RPED and RVO:  
The  ocular  toxicities  of  binimetinib  can  in  rare  instances  be  sight  threatening  although  no  cases  of 
permanent  blindness  have  been  reported.  Visual  impairment,  including  vision  blurred  and  reduced 
visual  acuity,  occurred  in  13%  (56/427)  of  patients  and  was  generally  reversible.  RPED  is  a 
characteristic  adverse  effect  of  MEK  inhibition  and  was  closely  monitored  in  the  binimetinib  clinical 
program.  While  evidence  of  retinopathy  was  detected  frequently,  in  31.6%  of  patients  treated  at  the 
recommended dose, i.e., all melanoma binimetinib 45 mg group, it was often asymptomatic (grade 1 
in 18% of patients) or mildly symptomatic (grade 2 in 12% of patients) and could be managed without 
need  for  dose  modification.  RVO  was  seen  infrequently  (1.6%  [9/566  patients  in  the  all  cancers 
(binimetinib  any  dose)  population]),  but  is  a  potentially  sight-threatening  event.  Patients  with  RVO 
were  discontinued  from  treatment  with  binimetinib  and  the  majority  with  available  follow-up  showed 
evidence of recovery. The safety of binimetinib has not been established in patients with a history of or 
current evidence of RVO or current risk factors for RVO including uncontrolled glaucoma, or a history of 
hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability syndromes. Binimetinib must be discontinued with the occurrence 
of RVO. Binimetinib is not recommended in patients with a history of RVO. 
In comparison with Binimetinib monotherapy (Bini P) there was a higher incidence of retinal events in 
the combination arm (Combo 450 RP) but this tendency was reversed when considering adjustment for 
study  drug  exposure.  However,  regarding  the  PTs,  retinal  detachment  was  reported  at  a  higher 
incidence  for  the  binimetinib  monotherapy  (10.3%  Bini  vs  6.6%  Combo),  vision  blurred  for  the 
combination therapy (15.3% Combo vs 6.6% Bini). However, in summary, an additive adverse effect

of  binimetinib  and encorafenib  regarding  Retinopathy  can  be  suggested.  In  addition,  in  3  patients  (in 
the  pivotal  study  CMEK162B2301  Part  1)  events  under  the  PT  of  blindness  (in  the  grouping  of 
retinopathy  excluding  RVO)  were  reported  (2  patients  in  the  Combo  450  arm  and  1  patient  in  the 
encorafenib  Part  1  arm).  In  the  binimetinib  monotherapy  population  no  cases  of  blindness  were 
reported. 
In the Vemurafenib-Arm ocular events were only reported with a low incidence. However, it should be 
kept  in  mind  that  for  the  combination  of  vemurafenib  and  cobimetinib  a  similar  incidence  of  ocular 
events was reported as for Combo 450 RP. 
Vascular  eye  events  (RVO)  as  potentially  sight–threatening  events  were  seen  only  in  the  Binimetinib 
arm. In contrast uveitis-Type AESIs were mainly reported for the combination but only in a quite low 
incidence and in a mild severity.  
See  section  4.4  for  further  information  on  special  warnings  and  precautions  of  use  concerning  ocular 
toxicities. 
Skin-related “rash” events  
These  were  observed  very  common  and  reported  in  81.4  %  of  patients  treated  with  binimetinib 
monotherapy.  Most  cases  were  grade  1  or  2  severity  but  68%  were  requiring  additional  therapy. 
Considering that these events often results in an impairment of infection protection and the binimetinib 
is also a TNF inhibitor, the increase rates of infections and cases of sepsis observed may be also seen 
as  drug  related  complications.  As  the  median  time  of  onset  was  0.4  month  for  these  events,  more 
clarification of potential dangerous consequences of these very frequent events and early occurring AE 
is needed. 
Rash  has  been  identified  as  an  AESI  for  encorafenib  and  binimetinib  and  is  a  known  class  effect  of 
both, BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Rash is among the most frequently observed AEs reported with these 
two classes of agents when used as single agents (Bini P 82.7%, Enco P 51.2%) and is reported at a 
lower  frequency  when  these  2  classes of  agents  are  combined  (Combo 450  RP  23.7%).  Compared  to 
other  MEK/BRAF  inhibitors  the  incidence  of  rash  seems  to  be  lower  for  the  combination  therapy  with 
binimetinib/  encorafenib.  In  addition,  the  presented  data  of  part  2  of  the  pivotal  study  indicates  a 
better tolerability in the Combo 300 mg population.  
Palmar-plantar  erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome  (PPES)  has  been  identified  as  an  AESI  for  both 
encorafenib  and  binimetinib  as  these  types  of  dermatologic  complications  are  known  class  effects 
reported with the use of BRAF inhibitors. In addition, these reactions have also been reported with MEK 
inhibitors  but  less  frequently.  The  incidence  of  PPES  was  obviously  lower  in  the  combination  therapy 
than in the encorafenib monotherapy. 
Dermatologic “non-rash” events: 
These  occurred in  42.4% of  patients  with  binimetinib  monotherapy.  The  median  time  of  onset of  this 
toxicity  was  1.4-month,  additional  therapy  was  required  in  24%.  In  addition,  approx.  25%  of  the 
patients  showed  -  often  secondary  to  other  dermatologic  events-  a  skin  infection;  3.3%  of  these 
events were resulting in hospitalization.  
New primary malignancies 
New primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, have been observed in patients treated with 
BRAF inhibitors and can occur when binimetinib is administered in combination with encorafenib (see 
section 4.8).

Cutaneous malignancies 
The  combination  of  binimetinib  to  encorafenib  appeared  to  attenuate  the  development  of  cutaneous 
squamous  cell  carcinoma  (cuSCC)  as  compared  to  encorafenib  treatment  alone.  Cutaneous  non-
squamous cell carcinoma (cnSCC) events were reported in a low percentage of patients overall (2.1% 
Combo 450 arm, 1.0% encorafenib Part 1 arm). No Melanoma events were reported in the Combo 450 
populations and in the Bini P population while in the encorafenib Part 1 and vemurafenib monotherapy 
arms,  melanoma  events  occurred  in  a  similar  percentage  of  patients  (5.2%  encorafenib  Part  1  arm, 
4.3% vemurafenib arm). 
Cutaneous malignancies such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) including 
kerathoacanthoma has been observed in patients treated with binimetinib when used in combination 
with encorafenib. 
Dermatologic evaluations should be performed prior to initiation of therapy with binimetinib in 
combination with encorafenib, every 2 months while on therapy and for up to 6 months following 
discontinuation of the combination. Suspicious skin lesions should be managed with dermatological 
excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Patients should be instructed to immediately inform their 
physicians if new skin lesions develop. Binimetinib and encorafenib should be continued without any 
dose modifications.  
In summary, the addition of Binimetinib (MEK inhibitor) to encorafenib seems to mitigate the risks of 
secondary skin neoplasms, in the Combo 450 population (compared to the Combo 300 population).   
Liver related events:  
Liver laboratory abnormalities 
Liver enzyme abnormalities are also common (ALT in 9.6%; AST in 13.6% of patients treated at the 
recommended dose) with binimetinib treatment. Although liver enzyme monitoring was enhanced as a 
result of a case of hepatic failure in a single patient treated at the 60 mg BID dose of binimetinib, the 
applicant states that no Hy’s law cases or other clear cases of drug-induced liver injury have been 
observed at the recommended 45 mg BID dose. Liver laboratory abnormalities including AST and ALT 
elevations can occur with binimetinib (see section 4.8). Liver laboratory values should be monitored 
before initiation of binimetinib and encorafenib and at least monthly during the 6 first months of 
treatment, and then as clinically indicated. Liver laboratory abnormalities should be managed with 
dose interruption, reduction or treatment discontinuation (see Table 1 in section 4.2). 
With respect to overall tolerability hepatotoxicity observed indicate a critical safety issue which needed 
to be balanced by a clear benefit. 
As already mentioned above liver function test abnormalities AESIs were reported at a higher incidence 
in the Combo 450 RP population than the Bini P population, overall (25.2% vs 17.3%), for Grade 3/4 
AESIs  (12.4%  vs  4.2%)  and  for  AESIs  requiring  dose  adjustment/study  drug  interruption  (8.4%  vs 
3%). Few events were serious (none vs 0.5%) or led to study drug discontinuation (1.8% vs 0.9%). In 
summary  regarding  liver  function  test  abnormalities  an  additive  effect  of  encorafenib  und  binimetinib 
can be suggested.  
The  data  presented  shows  a  high  incidence  of  increases  of  GGT  (overall  and  grade  ¾)  for  the 
combination therapy. The mechanisms behind the GGT abnormalities are not understood. However, it 
seems to be a kind of class effect, for the MEK/BRAF inhibitor combinations. 
Hepatic impairment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 161/182 
 
 
 
 
 
Liver  metabolism  mainly  via  glucuronidation  is  the  primary  route  of  elimination  of  binimetinib  (see 
section 5.2). As encorafenib is not recommended in patients with moderate (Child Pugh B) and severe 
hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C), administration of binimetinib is not recommended in these patients 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Muscular toxicity:  
Blood CK increase was a very commonly reported AE with binimetinib treatment (in 43.3% of patients 
treated  at  the  recommended  dose).  This  was  rarely  associated  with  symptoms,  although  symptoms 
were  more  common  with  higher  reported  grades  of  CK  elevation.  It  was  the  most  frequent  cause  of 
dose adjustment or treatment interruption. Frank rhabdomyolysis, defined by published criteria of high 
CK,  evidence  of  end  organ  damage  and  muscle  symptoms  was  infrequent,  with  only  a  single 
documented case meeting case defining criteria based on published literature and regulatory guidance. 
CK  and  creatinine  levels  should  be  monitored  prior  to  initiating  binimetinib,  periodically  during 
treatment,  and  as  clinically  indicated,  and  ensure  that  the  patient  is  adequately  hydrated.  In  case  of 
rhabdomyolysis  treatment  should  be  discontinued.  Depending  on  CK  elevation,  dose  interruption  or 
discontinuation  of  binimetinib  may  be  required.  Renal  complications  and  clinical  symptoms  of 
myopathy are often clinically not very impressive, but their impact on overall morbidity and mortality 
should not be underestimated.  
The  addition  of  binimetinib  to  encorafenib  appeared  to  mitigate  the  effects  observed  in  the  Bini  P 
population. 
Muscle-related AEs, including myalgia, have been observed with the administration of BRAF inhibitors 
including  Encorafenib.  The  addition  of  binimetinib  to  encorafenib  appeared  to  mitigate  the  effects 
observed in the Enco 300 mg population. 
In summary, the combination therapy seems to mitigate both the incidence of elevations of the blood 
CK as well as the incidence of symptomatic myopathy, which makes the effect (as a MEKi class effect) 
per se more plausible. 
The overall incidence of Muscle enzyme/protein changes AESIs was higher in the Combo 450 arm than 
in  the  vemurafenib  arm  overall.  However,  for  the  combination  vemurafenib/cobimetinib  a  distinctly 
higher  incidence  of  elevations  of  blood  CK  was  seen  (32.4%  vemurafenib/cobimetinib  vs  22.9% 
encorafenib/binimetinib). 
See  section  4.4  for  further  information  on  special  warnings  and  precautions  of  use  concerning  CK 
elevation and rhabdomyolysis. 
Left ventricular dysfunction:  
This is a class effect of MEK. Left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 10% (44/427) of patients treated 
at the recommended dose, with a maximum severity of grade 3 (in 4.4% of patients). It frequently led 
to  dose  modification  or  treatment  discontinuation.  LVEF  was  routinely  monitored  with  MUGA  or 
echocardiography  across  the  clinical  program.  The  safety  of  binimetinib  has  not  been  established  in 
patients with a baseline LVEF that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower limits of normal. 
It  is  recommended  that  there  be  assessment  of  LVEF  by  ECHO  or  MUGA  scan  before  initiation  of 
binimetinib,  1  month  after  initiation,  and  then  at  2  to  3-month  intervals  while  on  treatment. 
Binimetinib should be interrupted for up to 3 weeks if absolute LVEF value decreases by 10% from pre-
treatment  values  and  is  less  than  the  lower  limit  of  normal.  Binimetinib  should  be  permanently 
discontinued  for  symptomatic  left  ventricular  dysfunction  or  persistent,  asymptomatic  left  ventricular 
dysfunction that does not resolve within 3 weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 162/182 
 
 
 
 
 
According the non-clinical data binimetinib has no electrophysiological effects in the heart and lack of 
effects  on  cardiac  waveform  and  intervals  (including  QTc)  at  doses  as  high  as  10  mg/kg  (mean 
Maximum  Concentration  [Cmax]  2.7  μM,  range  1.04  to  7.05  μM)  in  monkeys.  QT  prolongation  was 
routinely  monitored  and  classified  as  an  AESI.  This  is  confirmed  by  the  clinical  data  in  the  different 
safety  sets  (restricted  and  broad).  In  the  pivotal  trial  QTc  prolongation  events  occurred  with  similar 
frequency  in  patients  in  both  arms  (binimetinib:  3.3%  versus  DTIC:  3.5%).  All  events  were 
asymptomatic  and  none  of  the  patients  had  presyncope,  syncope  or  loss  of  consciousness  associated 
with the QT prolongation, potentially indicating dangerous arrhythmias (e.g. “torsade de pointes”). 
In the Combo 450 mg population the incidence of cardiac events overall and grade 3/4 were reported 
at a lower incidence in the Combo 450 RP population than in the Bini P population. In addition, there 
were  no  events  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation  in  the  Combo  450  RP  population  whilst  4.2% 
were  reported  in  the  Bini  P  population.  Few  events  were  serious  or  required  additional  therapy.  The 
most frequent PT in both populations was ejection fraction decreased (6.6% vs 10.3%). Compared to 
other  MEK/BRAF  inhibitor  combinations  events  in  the  LVEF  grouping  were  reported  with  a  lower 
incidence in the encorafenib/binimetinib combination. 
The  recommendations  in  the  SmPC  (Section  4.2)  regarding  dose  modifications  (provided  for  cardiac 
adverse  reactions,  including  asymptomatic,  absolute  decreases  in  LVEF  from  baseline  of  ≥  10%  and 
ejection  fraction  below  the  institutional  LLN)  currently  is  acceptable.    See  section  4.4  for  further 
information on special warnings and precautions of use concerning left ventricular dysfunction. 
Hypertension:  
New-onset  hypertension  or  worsening  of  hypertension  was  seen  with  binimetinib  treatment  in  16% 
(68/427)  of  patients  at  the  recommended  dose,  with  grade  3  in  8%  of  patients.  It  was  generally 
manageable with antihypertensive medications and rarely required treatment discontinuation. Patients 
should  be  monitored  for  hypertension  and  temporary  suspension  of  binimetinib  is  recommended  in 
case  of  severe  hypertension,  until  hypertension  is  controlled.  The  significantly  high  frequency  for 
increases  of  creatinine  (82.0%)  indicating  a  decrease  in  renal  function  may  explain  at  least  partially 
this finding. It seems very likely that the increase in cardiac events was also triggered by hypertension 
results. 
Hypertension  is  a  class  effect  of  MEK  inhibitors,  either  when  treated  with  these  agents  alone  or  in 
combination with a BRAF inhibitor (see also Mekinist® [trametinib] prescribing information; Cotellic® 
[cobimetinib] prescribing information). Hypertension AESIs were reported at a similar incidence in the 
Bini  P  and  Combo  450  RP  populations,  overall  (although  the  incidence  was  higher  in  the  Bini  P  when 
adjusted for drug exposure) and for Grade 3/4 events (8.7% vs 6.2%).  
In  Study  CMEK162B2301  Part  1,  Kaplan-Meier  plots  of  time  to  LVEF  below  50%  and/or  absolute 
decrease of 10% or more in LVEF from baseline by baseline hypertension risk factor for patients in the 
Combo 450 arm with at least one event, showed a shorter median time for patients with as compared 
to  patients  without  baseline  hypertension  risk  factor.  The  incidence  of  a  2-grade  shift  in  LVEF  was 
higher  in  in  the  hypertension  risk  factor  group  (=history  of  hypertension,  SBP  ≥140  at  screening,  or 
DBP ≥ 90 at screening) as well.  
The  given  recommendations  regarding  management  and  dose  modifications  in  the  SmPC  section  4.2 
as  well  as  the  warning  in  4.4  are  acceptable.  See  section  4.4  for  further  information  on  special 
warnings and precautions of use concerning hypertension. 
Haemorrhage:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 163/182 
 
 
 
 
 
Although haemorrhage is classified as an AESI an occurred in 11.2 of patients in the binimetinib arm of 
the pivotal trial it seems that clinical relevant haemorrhage event beside epistaxis were not observed. 
The  INR  increases  reported  were  also  classified  in  this  category,  but  no  obvious  reason  for  these 
elevations  were  found  beside  concomitant  treatment  with  anticoagulants  from  the  analyses.  The  PTs 
reported  failed  to  indicate  a  clear  signal  for  systemic  impairment  of  haemostasis  system  or 
thrombocytes, although at the time being it cannot be completely excluded. The retinal haemorrhage 
(2.2%  in  the  binimetinib  arm)  seems  to  reflect  more  a  symptom  of  the  retinal  toxicity  than  really  a 
bleeding  disorder.  Additionally,  haematuria  (0.4%  in  the  binimetinib  arm)  in  the  absence  of  a 
haemostatic impairment is often symptom of a urogenital infection like acute cystitis. In summary, the 
data  presented  seemed  not  to  indicate  a  significantly  increase  bleeding  risk  during  binimetinib 
treatment. 
Hemorrhages have been noted to occur with MEK-inhibitor treatment (see also Mekinist® [trametinib] 
prescribing  information;  Cotellic®  [cobimetinib]  prescribing  information).  Although  the  overall 
frequency of hemorrhage events was higher in the Combo 450 RP population as compared to the Bini P 
population, adjusting for exposure, the rate of hemorrhage events in the Combo 450 RP seems to be 
lower than the rate for the Bini P population. In comparison with the other known BRAF/MEK inhibitor 
combination  therapies  the  overall  incidence  of  a  hemorrhage  seems  to  be  similar.  However,  the 
incidence of Grade ¾ events is higher under the combination therapy with encorafenib and binimetinib 
compared to the other combinations. Preliminary data of part 2 of the pivotal study indicates a slightly 
reduced incidence in the Combo 300 mg population.  
See  section  4.4  for  further  information  on  special  warnings  and  precautions  of  use  concerning 
haemorrhage. 
Pneumonitis:  
This  was  seen  following  binimetinib  treatment  in  1.4%  of  patients  in  the  all  cancers  [binimetinib  any 
dose] population) and is a well-recognized ADR associated with a number of kinase inhibitors, including 
MEK  inhibitors.  The  underlying  mechanism  behind  pulmonary  toxicities,  considered  as  being  MEK 
inhibitor  class  effects,  is  not  yet  known.  It  has  been  hypothesized  that  the  blockage  of  epidermal 
growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)-dependent  epithelial  proliferation  by  EGFR  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors 
augments  pulmonary  fibrosis  (Min  et  al,  2011,  Suzuki  et  al,  2003).  However,  it  is  notable  that  MEK 
inhibition may not have the same effect. For example, an in vivo study in mice demonstrated that the 
MEK  inhibitor,  selumetinib  (ARRY-142886),  prevented  the  progression  of  established  pulmonary 
fibrosis associated with EGFR activation (Madala et al 2012). 
Pneumonitis/interstitial  lung  disease  (ILD)  has  been  noted  to  occur  with  MEK-inhibitor  treatment 
(Mekinist®  [trametinib]  prescribing  information;  Cotellic®  [cobimetinib]  prescribing  information), 
including binimetinib.  Pneumonitis AESIs were reported at a similar (low) overall incidence in the Bini 
P and Combo 450 RP populations.  
See  section  4.4  for  further  information  on  special  warnings  and  precautions  of  use  concerning 
pneumonitis/ILD. 
Renal Failure: 
The  incidence of  renal  failures  seems  to be  similar  in  the  presented  safety  populations.  However,  the 
severity  seems  to  be  higher  in  the  combo  450  populations  than  in  the  binimetinib  and  encorafenib 
mono populations (higher incidence of grade ¾ events and SAEs). 
Gastro-intestinal disorders 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 164/182 
 
 
 
 
 
Including  diarrhoea  and  vomiting:  in  the  9-month  repeat-dosing  study  in  the  monkey,  the  primary 
findings were gastrointestinal intolerance and inflammation. All large intestinal findings resolved after a 
treatment-free period. In the gastric irritation study in rats, there were no significant effects at the 10 
and  30  mg/kg  doses.  At  100  mg/kg  binimetinib,  there  was  an  increased  incidence  of  superficial 
mucosal  lesions  and  of  haemorrhagic  ulcers.  ADRs  reported  most  commonly  by  PT  at  the 
recommended dose were diarrhoea (43% of patients), nausea (30% of patients) and vomiting (20% of 
patients).  Gastrointestinal  events  required  dose  adjustment  or  study  drug  interruption  in  11%  of 
patients and led to discontinuation of binimetinib in 1.2% of patients. 
Regarding  preliminary  data  of  part  2  of  the  pivotal  incidences  seem  to  be  remarkably  higher  in  the 
Combo 450mg than in the Combo 300mg population. In addition, the incidence of abdominal pain was 
remarkably higher compared to other MEK/BRAF inhibitors. 
Pancreatitis is a known effect of BRAF inhibitors (Muluneh et al. 2013). Although in most cases the 
increase of lipase and amylase in the Combo 450mg RP was asymptomatic and the incidence of acute 
pancreatitis was low, it seems to be an important safety issue. The incidence is comparable with that 
reported for marketed BRAF inhibitors, and the ADR attribution is also comparable.  Based on the 
available data, this identified risk is not considered a safety concern in the updated encorafenib RMP in 
the context of the severity of metastatic disease. Lipase increased and amylase increased are both 
reported as common ADRs (<10%). 
The  common  ADRs  in  the  category  of  gastrointestinal  disorders  include  nausea,  diarrhoea,  vomiting, 
abdominal pain and constipation. In the Combo 450 arm of the pivotal study AEs in this category were 
reported  overall  in  71.9%  including  Grade  3/4  events  in  11.9%  and  SAEs  in  9.4%.  42.2%  %  of  the 
patients  needed  additional  therapy.  Incidences  seem  to  be  remarkably  higher  in  the  Combo  450mg 
than  in  the  Combo  300mg  population  (71.9%  vs  63.8%,  preliminary  data  of  part  2  of  the  pivotal 
study).    In  addition,  the  incidence  of  abdominal  pain  was  remarkably  higher  compared  to  other 
MEK/BRAF inhibitor combinations. The given information in the SmPC for binimetinob is acceptable.  
Anaemia: 
Occurred  in  18.2%  of  patients  in  the  Combo  450  RP  population  (vs  9.6%  in  the  Bini  P  population), 
4.4%  patients  had  grade  3/4  events  (vs  2.3%  in  the  Bini  P  population).  No  patients  discontinued 
Combo 450 RP due to anaemia, 1.5% required dose adjustment or study drug interruption and 9.5% 
patients required additional therapy. With regard to the preliminary data, incidences were remarkably 
higher in the Combo 450mg arm (Part 1) than in the Combo 300mg arm (Part 2) of the pivotal study 
(15.1%  vs  9.3%).  Compared  to  other  MEK/BRAF  inhibitors,  a  higher  incidence  of  grade  3/4  anaemia 
was reported with the combination therapy binimetinib/encorafenib than with other combinations. 
Venous thromboembolism:  
In  melanoma  patients  treated  at  the  recommended  dose  of  binimetinib,  VTE  occurred  in  4.2% 
(18/427)  of  patients  receiving  binimetinib,  including  1.4%  (6/427)  of  patients  with  pulmonary 
embolism. It is a common complication related to malignancy and there is generally a high degree of 
vigilance  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  VTE  in  cancer  patients,  and  use  of  thromboprophylaxis  in 
appropriate settings is recognized as a standard of care in oncology. 
See section 4.4 for further information on special warnings and precautions of use concerning venous 
thromboembolism. 
Reproductive risk:  
Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, binimetinib may cause foetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman. Binimetinib was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits at 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 165/182 
 
 
 
 
 
doses  greater  than  or  equal  to  those  resulting  in  exposures  approximately  12  times  the  human 
exposure  at  the  recommended  clinical  dose.  The  main  risk  factor  is  the  women  of  child-bearing 
potential  (i.e.,  pre  or  peri-menopausal)  with  exposure  during  the  first  trimester  without  effective 
method  of  contraception.  The  risk  may  be  managed  by  highlighting  in  the  patient  information 
leaflet/summary  of  product  characteristics  that  female  patients  of  reproductive  potential  should  use 
effective contraception during treatment with binimetinib and for 2 weeks after treatment.  
There are no data on the effect on fertility in humans for binimetinib. 
The overall incidence of SAEs and of SAEs of Grade 3/4 was similar in the Bini P and Combo 450 
RP populations. However the onset of SAEs was earlier for binimetinib monotherapy (1.6 month) than 
for the combination binimetinib/encorafenib (3.8 months in the Combo 450 RP population resp 3.5 
months in the Combo 450 arm of the pivotal study). In addition, in contrast to binimetinib 
monotherapy, SAEs were reported (in low incidences) for several different PTs and not particular for 
the PT general physical health deterioration (possibly due to the multiplicity of toxicities). 
In  Study  CMEK162B2301  Part  1,  a  similar  percentage  of  patients  died  on  treatment  across  the  three 
treatment arms (8.9% Combo 450 arm, 7.3% encorafenib Part 1 arm, 10.2% vemurafenib arm). The 
adjusted death rate per 100 patient-months of exposure was 0.71 in the Combo 450 arm, 0.75 in the 
encorafenib Part 1 arm and 1.23 in the vemurafenib arm. In the Binimetinib monotherapy population 
the  incidence  seems  to  be  similar  as  well.  However,  the  adjusted  death  rate  was  higher  (2.45) 
indicating in a shorter survival of this monotherapy population. 
Binimetinib is a substrate of UGT1A1.  It is suggested that a study with an inhibitor is not required but 
instead cautionary wording is proposed.  This is not agreed.   Data on the effect of polymorphisms is 
limited  and  there  are  few  patients  on  UGT  inhibitors  in  the  POPPK  analysis  (n=20)  and  this  is  not  as 
sensitive  to  determine  an  effect.    The  applicant  should  perform  a  study  to  determine  the  effect  of 
UGT1A1 inhibitors on binimetinib. 
Binimetinib is also a substrate for Pgp and BCRP, however an effect on biliary secretion is proposed to 
be  unlikely  based  on  non-clinical  data  and  effects  on  absorption  unlikely,  due  to  high  intestinal 
permeability.    This  too  is  not  accepted  and  it  is  considered  a  clinical  study  should  be  performed  to 
determine the effect of Pgp and BCRP inhibition. 
In cocktail uptake studies binimetinib did not appear to be a substrate of hepatic uptake transporters.  
The  concentration  studied  however  is  high,  15.3  µM  compared  to  Cmax,u  of  0.06µM,  further  studies 
are required at more physiologically relevant concentrations. 
Binimetinib  does  not  inhibit  CYPs  except  for  CYP  2B6  which  had  a  Ki  of  1.7  µM,  however  the 
mechanistic static model was used to rule out an interaction. 
Binimetinib shows induction of CYP 3A4 in vitro and this was investigated in a clinical study. Induction 
of mRNA for CYP 1A2 and 2B6 is greater than 2-fold (16.5 and 2.6-fold respectively).  This should be 
discussed.  
Binimetinib  is  not  an  inhibitor  of  Pgp,  BCRP,  OAT1,  OCT1,  OCT2,  MATE-1,  MATE-2k  or  BSEP.    It  is  a 
weak  inhibitor  of  OATP1B1  and  1B3,  but  it  can  be  agreed  this  does  not  appear  to  be  at  clinically 
relevant concentrations and therefore there are no safety concerns. Binimetinib does inhibit OAT3 and 
further clarification should be provided to discount an effect on this transporter. 
Non-cutaneous malignancies 
Based on its mechanism of action, encorafenib may promote malignancies associated with activation of 
RAS through mutation or other mechanisms. Patients receiving binimetinib in combination with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 166/182 
 
 
 
 
 
encorafenib should undergo a head and neck examination, chest/abdomen computerised tomography 
(CT) scan, anal and pelvic examinations (for women) and complete blood cell counts prior to initiation, 
during and at the end of treatment as clinically appropriate. 
Permanent discontinuation of binimetinib and encorafenib should be considered in patients who 
develops RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies. Benefits and risks should be carefully 
considered before administering binimetinib in combination with encorafenib to patients with a prior or 
concurrent cancer associated with RAS mutation. 
Lactose intolerance 
Mektovi contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 
6.1. 
Overdose 
The highest dose of binimetinib evaluated as single agent in clinical studies was 80 mg administered 
orally twice daily and was associated with ocular (chorioretinopathy) and skin toxicities (dermatitis 
acneiform).  
There is no specific treatment of overdose. If overdose occurs, the patient should be treated 
supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary.  
Since binimetinib is highly bound to plasma proteins, haemodialysis is likely to be ineffective in the 
treatment of overdose with binimetinib.  
Elderly 
In patients treated with Combo 450 (n = 274), 194 patients (70.8 %) were < 65 years old, 65 patients 
(23.7 %)  were  65  -74  years  old  and  15  patients  (5.5 %)  were  aged  >  75.  No  overall  differences  in 
safety or efficacy were observed between elderly patients (≥ 65) and younger patients. The proportion 
of patients experiencing adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in patients aged <65 
years and those aged > 65 years. The most common adverse events reported with a higher incidence 
in patients aged ≥ 65 years compared to patients aged < 65 years included diarrhoea, pruritus, GGT 
and  blood  phosphatase  alkaline  elevation.  In  the  small  group  of  patients  aged  ≥  75  years  (n=15), 
patients  were  more  likely  to  experience  serious  adverse  events  and  adverse  events  leading  to 
discontinuation of treatment.  
Binimetinib has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Visual disturbances have been 
reported in patients treated with binimetinib during clinical trials. Patients should be advised not to 
drive or use machines if they experience visual disturbances or any other adverse reaction that may 
affect their ability to drive and use machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Dose modification 
The management of adverse reactions may require dose reduction, temporary interruption or 
treatment discontinuation (see section 4.2 and Table 1 and Table 2 of the SmPC). 
For patients receiving 45 mg binimetinib twice daily, the recommended reduced dose of binimetinib is 
30 mg twice daily. Dose reduction below 30 mg twice daily is not recommended. Therapy should be 
discontinued if the patient is not able to tolerate 30 mg orally twice daily. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 167/182 
 
 
 
 
 
If the adverse reaction that resulted in a dose reduction is under effective management, dose re 
escalation to 45 mg twice daily may be considered. Dose re escalation to 45 mg twice daily is not 
recommended if the dose reduction is due to left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) or any Grade 4 toxicity. 
If treatment related toxicities occur when binimetinib is used in combination with encorafenib, then 
both treatments should be simultaneously dose reduced, interrupted or discontinued. Exceptions where 
dose reductions are necessary for encorafenib only (adverse reactions primarily related to encorafenib) 
are: palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES), uveitis including iritis and iridocyclitis and 
QTc prolongation. 
If binimetinib is temporarily interrupted, encorafenib should be reduced to 300 mg once daily during 
the time of binimetinib dose interruption (see Tables 1 and 2) as encorafenib is not well-tolerated at 
the dose of 450 mg as a single agent. If binimetinib is permanently discontinued, encorafenib should 
be discontinued.  
If encorafenib is temporarily interrupted (see section 4.2 of encorafenib SmPC), binimetinib should be 
interrupted. If encorafenib is permanently discontinued, then binimetinib should be discontinued.  
For information on the posology and recommended dose modifications of encorafenib, see section 4.2 
of encorafenib SmPC. 
Reporting  suspected  adverse  reactions  after  authorisation  of  the  medicinal  product  is  important.  It 
allows  continued  monitoring  of  the  benefit/risk  balance  of  the  medicinal  product.  Healthcare 
professionals  are  asked  to  report  any  suspected  adverse  reactions  via  the  national  reporting  system 
listed in Appendix V. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The overall safety results for binimetinib show ADRs consistent with the known safety profile of other 
drugs  in  this  class  and  are  considered  acceptbale  and  manageable  with  routine  risk  minimisation 
activities.  However,  the  incidences  of  some  of  the  expected  adverse  events  are  more  frequent  that 
seen  with  other  approved  MEK  inhibitors.  Some  of  these  ADRs  are  serious  or  potentially  life 
threatening  (thromboembolic  events,  hypertension,  serious  skin  toxicities  and  infections,  left 
ventricular  dysfunction,  pneumonitis,  liver  function  abnormalities  and  rhabdomyolysis),  or  are  sight 
threatening (RVO) and are reflected in the deaths, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation across the 
safety sets. 
The  safety  and  tolerability  of  binimetinib  in  combination  with  encorafenib  appears  favourable  and 
acceptable  as  compared  to  vemurafenib  with  regard  to  the  observed  benefit.  The  majority  of  the 
reported  ADRs  reflects  the  common  AEs  observed  in  the  clinical  program  of  binimetinib  45  mg  QD 
single  agent  and  given  in  combination  to  binimetinib  45  mg  BID.  The  observed  toxicities  of  the 
combination  are  generally  manageable  and  acceptable  in  the  population  of  adult  patient  with 
metastatic  or  unresectable  melanoma  harbouring  a  BRAFV600  mutation,  and  no  prior  therapy.  The 
overall  safety  profile  of  the  combination  of  binimetinib  45  mg  BID  with  encorafenib  450  mg  QD  is 
consistent with the mechanisms of action and the known safety profiles of MEK and BRAF inhibitors as 
single agents or in combination.  
A  comparison  of  safety  profile  between  Combo  450  and  Combo  300  suggests  a  better  safety  profile 
with the Combo 300 with lower incidences of grade 3-4 events and serious adverse events. The overall 
safety  profiles  for  the  Combo  450  and  Combo  300  arms  are  similar  in  terms  of  incidence 
(difference<5%)  of  deaths,  AEs,  treatment  discontinuation  due  to  AEs,  and  AEs  leading  to  dose

modifications/ interruptions or additional therapy. The overall incidence of grade 3-4 AEs was lower in 
the Combo°300 (46.7% vs 57.8%) as compared to Combo 450. 
A 4-month update of the safety profile was provided with the responses. The updated safety data 
provided with additional follow-up shows a similar safety profile for the Combo 450 as demonstrated in 
the initial submission. New ADRs of blood creatinine increased, renal failure and GGT increased for 
encorafenib in combination with binimetinib, and blood creatinine increased for encorafenib single 
agent, have been added to the proposed SmPC since the initial submission.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 27 June 2018. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of binimetinib with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers binimetinib to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Mektovi (binimetinib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant applied for a marketing authorisation application for an indication of binimetinib for use 
in combination with encorafenib for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma, with BRAF V600 mutation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 173/182 
 
 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
BRAF- MEK inhibitor combination regimens are currently the main standard of care for treatment of 
advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma that have tumours harbouring the BRAF V600 
mutation.  Tumour responses have reported as high as up to 70% and rapid response induction has 
been associated with symptom control. Median PFS has been shown to be increased to approximately 
12 months and this has translated into an improvement in median OS to 22-25 months.  
Other treatment options include anti PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, which showed a 
clinically and statistically significant PFS benefit over the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab. Emerging 
data suggest that BRAF inhibition is effective following immunotherapy, and checkpoint inhibitors are 
still effective in patients who have progressed on kinase-inhibitor therapy.  
Although there are treatments for metastatic melanoma with BRAFV600 mutation that have shown 
clinical benefit, patients usually relapse or discontinue due to AE or tolerability issues. Therefore, there 
is still a need for treatment choices with improved efficacy or different safety profiles over existing 
medicinal products. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The Phase 3 clinical study (COLUMBUS) was a randomised, open label trial in patients with advanced 
unresectable or metastatic BRAF (either V600 E or K) mutation-positive melanoma comprised of 2 
parts: 
−  Part 1 randomised 577 patients in a 1:1:1 ratio to encorafenib 450mg QD and binimetinib 
45mg BID (Combo 450, N=192), encorafenib 300mg QD (N=194) or vemurafenib 960mg BID 
(N=191). Randomisation was stratified by AJCC stage, ECOG performance status and prior first 
line immunotherapy. 
−  Part 2 was planned to randomise 320 patients in a 3: 1 ratio to Combo 300 (encorafenib 
300mg QD and binimetinib 45mg BID) or encorafenib 300mg QD. This part of the trial was to 
estimate the treatment effect of Combo 300 vs. LGX818 in terms of overall survival (OS), to 
estimate the treatment effect of Combo 300 vs. vemurafenib in terms of PFS and OS and to 
estimate the treatment effect of Combo 300 vs. Combo 450 in terms of PFS and OS.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The  DMC  advised  study  termination  on  14  October  2016  based  on  unblinded  efficacy  data,  including 
OS  results  to  which  the  Sponsor  remained  blinded.  The  Part  1  efficacy  data  were  presented  in  the 
initial dossier and the Part 2 results were provided during the procedure. 
The trial met its primary endpoint, with an improved median PFS by 7.6 months in the Combo 450 arm 
compared to single agent vemurafenib with a median PFS of 14.9 months vs. 7.3 months, respectively, 
HR = 0.54 (95% CI 0.41, 0.71, 1 -sided stratified log-rank p<0.001) is the FAS. 
The HR was consistent by investigator review and in the sensitivity analyses, including an analysis 
counting new therapy as an event (HR=0.53).  
The median PFS of single agent vemurafenib (7.3 months) was consistent with what has been seen in 
previous studies and, it was noted that the median PFS of the Combo 450 (14.9 months) was longer 
than that reported for  other BRAF- MEK inhibitor combination treatments (median PFS for trametinib 
and dabrafenib = 11.4 months; cobimetinib and vemurafenib = 12.3 months).

Encorafenib monotherapy increased median PFS by 2.3 months compared to vemurafenib (9.6 months 
vs. 7.3 months; nominal one-sided log-rank p = 0.004; HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.52, 0.90) by BIRC. This 
was a secondary efficacy endpoint, downgraded from a co-primary endpoint with Protocol Amendment 
3 (post randomisation of 364 patients). Investigator assessment of response gave similar median PFS 
durations. Median PFS values by BIRC were the same in the PPS as in the FAS.  
The confirmed overall response rate (ORR) per BIRC was higher with combination treatment: 63.0% 
(95% CI 55.8, 69.9) in the Combo 450 arm compared with 50.5% (95% CI 43.3, 57.8) in the 
encorafenib arm and 40.3% (95% CI 33.3, 47.6) in the vemurafenib arm. 
The median time to definitive 10% deterioration in the FACT-M global health status score was not 
reached in the Combo 450 arm (95% CI 22.1, NE) and was 22.1 months (95% CI 15.2, NE) in the 
vemurafenib arm with a HR for the difference of 0.46 (95% CI 0.29, 0.72) using a stratified Cox 
regression model. The median time to definitive 10% deterioration in the FACT-M was 20.3 months 
(95% CI 15.0, NE) in the encorafenib arm with a HR for the difference between Combo 450 and 
encorafenib of 0.48 (95% CI 0.31, 0.75) using a stratified Cox regression model. 
The median time to definitive 10% deterioration in the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status score was 
delayed by 7.3 months in the Combo 450 arm compared to the vemurafenib arm: 23.9 months (95% 
CI 20.4, NE) vs. 16.6 months (95% CI 11.9, NE) with a HR for the difference of 0.55 (95% CI 0.37, 
0.80) using a stratified Cox regression model. The median time to definitive 10% deterioration in the 
QLQ-C30 global health status scores was 9.2 months longer in the Combo 450 arm compared with the 
Enco 300 arm (14.7 months [95% CI 9.2, 18.4]), with a HR for the difference of 0.45 (95% CI 0.31, 
0.65) using a stratified Cox regression model.   
The median OS was 33.6 months (95% CI [24.4, 39.2]) and 16.9 months ((95% CI [14.0, 24.5]) for 
Combo  450  compared  to  vemurafenib  (HR  0.61,  95%  CI  0.47,  0.79,  nominal  p  value  <0.0001). 
Estimates of OS at 12 months and 24 months were 75.5% (95% CI [68.8, 81.0]) and 57.6% ((95% CI 
[50.3, 64.3]) for Combo 450 compared to 63.1% ((95% CI [55.7, 69.6]) and 43.2% ((95% CI [35.9, 
50.2]) for vemurafenib.  
The  median  (95%  CI)  OS  was  33.6  months  (24.4,  39.2)  and  23.5  months  (19.6,  33.6)  with  Combo 
450  compared  to  encorafenib,  respectively,  with  a  HR  0.81  (95%  CI  0.61,  1.0;  nominal  p  value 
=0.0613, 2-sided). Estimates of OS at 12 months and 24 months were 75.5% (68.8, 81.0) and 57.6% 
(50.3, 64.3) for Combo 450 compared to 74.6% (67.6, 80.3) and 49.1% (41.5, 56.2) for encorafenib. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There were some uncertainties concerning the best dose for encorafenib (450mg vs 300 mg) that 
should be used in combination with binimetinib. Single agent binimetinib has limited activity in BRAF-
mutated melanoma patients. In the phase II study CMEK162X2201, the 4.9% response rate in 41 
patients, based on locally assessed unconfirmed responses, is low for a monotherapy MEK inhibitor 
compared to results of trametinib reported in a pivotal phase III study. Binimetinib 45mg BID 
contributed to the efficacy of Combo 300 and allowed a higher dose of encorafenib to be administered 
in Combo 450. 
It was unclear whether Combo 450 offered an additional PFS benefit over Combo 300. In the analysis 
with comparable median duration of potential follow-up for PFS (16.7 months and 13.9 months), 
Combo 450 showed a median 2-month improvement in PFS compared with Combo 300 (14.9 vs 12.9 
months). This difference was not statistically significant (HR of 0.79 [95% CI 0.60, 1.03]) one-sided 
log-rank p=0.0845). The second analysis performed using the 09 November 2016 cut-off date for the 
two arms was statistically significant (HR 0.73 95%CI [0.55 0.97]; 2-sided p=0.0278). However, this 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 175/182 
 
 
 
 
 
result is due to a very uneven duration of follow-up for PFS per BIRC (Kaplan Meier) with 22.5 months 
for Part 1 Combo 450 arm compared with 13.9 months for Part 2 Combo 300 arm. Combo 450 did not 
improve the response rate compared with Combo 300 (63.0% vs 65.9%) but did lead to a numerically 
longer duration of confirmed responses (16.6 months vs 12.7 months).  
Normally statistical significance would not be demanded between the two parts of the study and the 
2.8-month improvement in median PFS with Combo 450 compared with Combo 300 could be 
considered clinically relevant. However, in this instance, the fact that encorafenib 300mg performed 
significantly better in Part 1 than in Part 2 with a 2.2-month difference in median PFS hinders the PFS 
comparison of the combination treatment (Combo 450 vs Combo 300) between the two parts of the 
study. Therefore, the OS results for Combo 300 and updated Combo 300 PFS analysis, including more 
mature data for the Enco300 Part 2 arm will be provide as a post-authorisation measure. 
The Exposure-Response analyses suggest that increasing encorafenib AUCss in Combo 450 has a 
negative influence on ORR and PFS. Baseline LDH >ULN was more common in patients with a higher 
AUCss; high LDH is known to be a negative prognostic marker predicting a shorter PFS. In Part 1, in 
the high LDH group only patients with high encorafenib exposure in Combo 450 did worse. There was 
no such finding with Combo 300 in Part 2. There remains the possibility that this association in the 
Combo 450 arm is a chance finding or artefact. It remains possible that the B/R ratio could be 
improved in patients with high baseline LDH by identification of other factors that potentially influence 
encorafenib exposure. Therefore, the applicant is requested to submit the overall survival results 
stratified by LDH level for Combo 300 and Enco 300 (Part 2) as a post-authorisation measure.  
In order to characterise the patient population that responds to treatment, the applicant is requested 
to submit the results of the planned biomarker analyses for Study B2301 (from all 3 treatment arms) 
for evaluation as soon as available, to support the synergistic pharmacodynamic activity of encorafenib 
in combination with binimetinib. The results will be provided as a recommendation.  
In addition, genomic analysis of baseline samples remaining after centralized BRAF testing would be 
informative to assess whether there is a relationship between baseline mutations and efficacy 
outcomes. As indicated in the protocol, genomic alterations in BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PTEN, cKIT, 
PIK3CA, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, ARAF, c-MET, CRAF, EGFR and CCND1 may be explored to find a potential 
association between baseline mutations and efficacy outcomes. The results will be provided as a 
recommendation.

once daily) (hereafter referred to as Combo 450) was evaluated in 274 patients with BRAF V600 
mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma, based on two Phase II studies (CMEK162X2110 and 
CLGX818X2109) and one Phase III study (CMEK162B2301, Part 1) (hereafter referred to as the 
pooled Combo 450 population). At the recommended dose (n = 274) in patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma, the most common adverse reactions (> 25 %) occurring in patients treated with 
binimetinib administered with encorafenib were fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, retinal 
detachment, abdominal pain, arthralgia, blood CK increased and myalgia. 
The safety of encorafenib (300 mg orally once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg orally 
twice daily) was evaluated in 257 patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma (hereafter referred to as the Combo 300 population), based on the Phase III study 
(CMEK162B2301, Part 2). The most common adverse reactions (>25%) occurring in patients treated 
with encorafenib 300 mg administered with binimetinib were fatigue, nausea and diarrhoea.

The overall safety results for binimetinib show ADRs consistent with the known safety profile of other 
drugs in this class. However, the incidences of some of the expected adverse events are more frequent 
that seen with other approved MEK inhibitors. Some of these ADRs are serious or potentially life 
threatening (thromboembolic events, hypertension, serious skin toxicities and infections, left 
ventricular dysfunction, pneumonitis, liver function abnormalities and rhabdomyolysis), or are sight 
threatening (RVO) and are reflected in the deaths, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation across the 
safety sets.  
The  safety  and  tolerability  of  binimetinib  in  combination  with  encorafenib  appears  favourable  and 
acceptable as compared to vemurafenib regarding the observed benefit. The majority of the reported 
ADRs reflects the common AEs observed in the clinical program of binimetinib 45 mg QD single agent 
and  given  in  combination  to  binimetinib  45  mg  BID.  Regarding  the  presented  safety  data  of  part  2, 
Combo 300 seems to be better tolerable than Combo 450. 
Pneumonitis is an important potential risk.  This  was seen following binimetinib treatment in 1.4% of 
patients in the all cancers [binimetinib any dose] population) and is a well-recognized ADR associated 
with a number of kinase inhibitors, including MEK inhibitors. T 
Specifically, for binimetinib, the most important risks associated with binimetinib treatment defined by 
ADRs in the proposed patient population are (see warning in SmPC 4.4): 
• 
Left  ventricular  dysfunction:  is  a  class  effect  of  MEK.  Left  ventricular  dysfunction  occurred  in 
10%  (44/427)  of  patients  treated  at  the  recommended  dose,  with  a  maximum  severity  of 
grade  3  (in  4.4%  of  patients).  It  frequently  led  to  dose  modification  or  treatment 
discontinuation.  LVEF  was  routinely  monitored  with  MUGA  or  echocardiography  across  the 
clinical program.  
•  Hypertension: New-onset hypertension or worsening of hypertension was seen with binimetinib 
treatment  in  16%  (68/427)  of  patients  at  the  recommended  dose,  with  grade  3  in  8%  of 
patients.  It  was  generally  manageable  with  antihypertensive  medications  and  rarely  required 
treatment discontinuation.  
•  RPED and RVO: the ocular toxicities of binimetinib can be sight threatening although no cases 
of  permanent  blindness  have  been  reported.  Visual  impairment,  including  vision  blurred  and 
reduced  visual  acuity,  occurred  in  13%  (56/427)  of  patients  and  was  generally  reversible. 
RPED  is  a  characteristic  adverse  effect  of  MEK.  RVO  was  seen  infrequently  (1.6%  [9/566 
patients  in  the  all  cancers  (binimetinib  any  dose)  population]),  but  is  a  potentially  sight-
threatening event. 
•  Muscular toxicity with a blood CK increase was a very commonly reported AE with binimetinib 
treatment  (in  43.3%  of  patients  treated  at  the  recommended  dose).  Frank  rhabdomyolysis, 
defined by published criteria of high CK, evidence of end organ damage and muscle symptoms 
was  infrequent,  with  only  a  single  documented  case  meeting  case  defining  criteria  based  on 
published  literature  and  regulatory  guidance.  CK  and  creatinine  levels  should  be  monitored 
prior  to  initiating  binimetinib,  periodically  during  treatment,  and  as  clinically  indicated,  and 
ensure  that  the  patient  is adequately  hydrated.  The  incidence  of  musculoskeletal  toxicity  was 
higher in the use in combination with encorafenib.  
•  Haemorrhagic events were observed in 17.9 % (49/274) of patients in the pooled Combo 450 
population.  Most  of  these  cases  were  Grade  1  or  2  (14.6  %)  and  3.3  %  were  Grade  3  or  4 
events. Few patients requiring dose interruptions or dose reductions (0.7 % or 2/274). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018

•  VTE occurred in 4.7 % (13/274) in patients treated with Combo 450, including 2.2 % (6/274) 
of patients who developed pulmonary embolism.  
The overall tolerability profiles of Combo 450 and Combo 300 were broadly similar in terms of AEs 
requiring discontinuation, dose modifications or additional therapy but Combo 450 led to increased 
incidence of SAEs and Grade 3-4 AEs. Combo 450 generated an increased incidence of the most 
common side effects compared to Combo 300, particularly nausea (41.1 vs. 27.2%), vomiting (29.7 
vs. 15.2) and headache (21.9 vs. 11.7%). The time to first SAE and AE resulting in study drug 
discontinuation was shorter for Combo 450. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There  is  the  potential  risk  of  embryo-foetal  toxicity  as  described  in  the  non-clinical  section.  This 
potential risk has been communicated in the SmPC in section 4.6. There is also a potential risk of over-
exposure of binimetinib in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. The potential hs been 
described  in  the  SmPC  and  recommendations  for  dose  modification  has  been  added  to  section  4.2  of 
the SmPC.  
Missing  information  regarding  safety  includes  information  regarding  use  in  patients  with  reduced 
cardiac function (LVEF <50%) or symptomatic chronic heart failure and safety in paediatric population 
(children less than 18 years) (see RMP). 
There is a potential of over-exposure in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. The 
CHMP considers that the applicant should collect PK samples from BRAF melanoma patients with 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment after repeated dosing of encorafenib in combination with 
binimetinib to determine the plasma concentrations in relation to administered dose and AEs observed 
to guide dosing recommendations in these patient populations.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The PFS improvement for Combo 450 compared to vemurafenib is considered clinically meaningful. In 
addition, the significant prolongation in OS with a difference in median survival of 16.7 months in 
favour of Combo 450 is clinically important. 
Combo 450 had better general tolerability than encorafenib monotherapy, as evidenced by the QoL 
analysis and the lower overall rate of AEs. Treatment continued at high relative dose intensity in the 
combination arm. Still, the proportion of SAEs was not reduced compared to encorafenib monotherapy, 
and the combination did introduce additional toxicities, specifically increased CK, hypertension, 
abnormal LFTs, LV dysfunction and eye disorders. These events may not have influenced tolerability, 
but decreased ejection fraction and increased ALT did result in dose adjustment or study drug 
interruption. These AEs have the potential to be serious but are manageable if the routine regular 
screening of patients whilst on treatment is adhered to and recommendations from the SmPC are 
followed.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
BRAF-MEK inhibitor combinations are known to be effective in BRAF V600 mutant malignant 
melanoma. Combo 450 led to an improved PFS compared to monotherapy vemurafenib and a median 
OS at the upper end of the range of survivals currently reported for metastatic malignant melanoma. 
While vemurafenib monotherapy is no longer the main standard of care for metastatic melanoma with 
BRAF V600 mutations and as a result, the comparison with a treatment arm which is currently 
regarded as suboptimal is not encouraged, it nevertheless remains evident that there is a clinically 
relevant benefit that has been demonstrated with the combination treatment of encorafenib with 
binimetinb in patients with metastatic melanoma harbouring BRAF V600 mutation.  The safety of the 
combination is considered acceptable and ADRs can be managed through routine risk minimisation 
activities with no further additional risk minimisation activities required. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Approximately 37-50% of patients with metastatic melanoma have mutations in BRAF, and over 95% 
of these are in BRAF exon 15 at the V600 position. The most common V600 mutations are V600E and 
V600K accounting for 80-90% and 7-30% of all BRAF V600 mutations, respectively. Other more rare 
activating  mutations  include  V600R  and  V600D.  These  mutations  constitutively  activate  BRAF  protein 
and  signal  downstream  to  activate  the  RAF/MEK/ERK  pathway,  which  signals  for  cancer  cell 
proliferation  and  survival.  The  patient  population  recruited  in  the  pivotal  clinical  trial  were  tested  for 
the presence of BRAF V600 E or K mutation, which was an inclusion criteria that a patient’s tumour had 
to be confirmed by a validated test prior to treatment initiation. Based on the mechanism of action and 
the  non-clinical  data  showing  the  inhibitory  activity  of  binimetinb  in  tumour  cells  that  harbour  BRAF 
V600E/K/R, the indication has been expanded to include all BRAF V600 mutations as it is expected that 
binimetinib may target and inhibit MEK, which is downstream of the RAF/MEK ERK pathways and hence 
would be able to block MEK activation regardless of the type of BRAF V600 substitution.  
The patient population included in the pivotal study were patients with histologically confirmed 
diagnosis of locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma or unknown primary 
melanoma (AJCC Stage IIIB, IIIC or IV) and excluded patients with uveal and mucosal melanoma. The 
indication includes all types of melanoma as the prevalence of uveal melanoma and mucosal melanoma 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554701/2018  
Page 180/182 
 
 
 
 
 
is low and few patients would have been recruited in the trial. In addition, there is no standard of care 
for these types of melanoma and it is expected that all melanoma patients with a BRAF V600 mutation 
would benefit from having treatment options that are targeted and have demonstrated efficacy. 
Patients also had not received prior treatment with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor. A warning has been 
included in section 4.4 of the SmPC to inform treating physicians that it appears that patients who 
have received prior BRAF treatment seem to have lower efficacy when treated with the combination. It 
is also noteworthy that the trial population included naive untreated patients or patients who have 
progressed on or after prior first-line immunotherapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic 
melanoma. Nevertheless, the indication does not specify the line of treatment as it is left to the 
treating physician and clinical practice to determine the best treatment algorithm for an individual 
patient. Section 5.1 of the SmPC describes the patient population that was included in trial. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Mektovi is positive. 
The CHMP requests the following measures to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
−  OS results for Combo 300 and updated Combo 300 PFS analysis, including more mature data 
for the Enco300 Part 2 arm. 
−  DDI cocktail study: OATP and BCRP will be explored in the ongoing DDI study with rosuvastatin 
(study ARRAY-818-103)  
−  Overall survival results stratified by LDH level for Combo 300 and Enco 300 (Part 2).  
−  To collect PK samples from BRAF melanoma patients with moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment after repeated dosing of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib to determine 
the plasma concentrations in relation to administered dose and AEs observed to guide dosing 
recommendations in these patient populations. 
The CHMP recommends the applicant to submit the following measures to address the issues related to 
pharmacology: 
−  The applicant should commit to submit the results of the planned biomarker analyses for Study 
B2301 (from all 3 treatment arms) for evaluation as soon as available, to support the 
synergistic pharmacodynamic activity of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib. Genomic 
analysis of baseline samples remaining after centralized BRAF testing. As indicated in the 
protocol, genomic alterations in BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PTEN, cKIT, PIK3CA, MAP2K1, 
MAP2K2, ARAF, c-MET, CRAF, EGFR and CCND1 may be explored to find a potential association 
between baseline mutations and efficacy outcomes. 
−  The relationship between baseline mutations and efficacy outcomes should be performed, and 
a date provided to submit the results. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Mektovi is favourable in the following indication: 
Binimetinib in combination with encorafenib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Congenital coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder in which 
reduced plasma FXIII activity is caused by quantitative or rarely by qualitative defects in the FXIII A-subunit 
protein. Much less commonly, FXIII deficiency is caused by defects in the FXIII B-subunit protein. FXIII 
deficiency has an estimated worldwide prevalence of 1 per 2 to 5 million individuals. In patients with FXIII 
A-subunit deficiency the FXIII activity level is lower than 3 to 5% (or approximately 0.04 to 0.06 IU/mL), 
compared with a wide range of approximately 50% to 220% (0.60 to 2.60 IU/mL) in the normal population. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/539227/2020 
Page 6/37 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Diagnosis is based on quantitative FXIII activity measurement and antigen assays. Common clotting assays 
such as activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) and Prothrombin Time (PT) are normal and cannot be 
used for the screening. The clot solubility test may also be used (clot is stable for more than 24 hours in case 
of FXIII deficiency). However, the assay is qualitative, and when performed correctly the test is positive only 
when the FXIII activity in the sample is close to zero. Molecular testing is available, but unnecessary for 
diagnosis. Differential diagnoses mainly include the other congenital coagulation factor deficiencies: 
fibrinogen, factors II, V, VII, X, XI, VIII, IX. Antenatal diagnosis is possible if the causal mutations have 
previously been identified in the family.  
Congenital FXIII deficiency is characterised by haemorrhagic diathesis frequently associated with 
spontaneous abortions and defective wound healing. Congenital FXIII deficiency can manifest at any age, 
but diagnosis is often made during infancy. Umbilical stump bleeding manifests in up to 80% of patients. 
Other common signs include intracranial haemorrhage (25-30%), soft tissue bleeding, bruising, 
hemarthroses (20%), and recurrent spontaneous abortions. In most cases, haemorrhages are delayed 
(12-36hr) after trauma or surgery. Patients may have poor wound healing.  
Given that intracranial bleeding is common in FXIII deficiency and may be a presenting feature later in 
childhood, most cases receive long-term prophylaxis with FXIII concentrate. Current treatment options in 
FXIII deficiency include cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, plasma-derived FXIII (pdFXIII) concentrate 
(Fibrogammin / Corifact) and recombinant FXIII subunit-A (rFXIII, NovoThirteen). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
NovoThirteen  is  not  FXIII.  Its  active  substance,  catridecacog,  is  the  A  subunit  dimer  [A2]  of  human 
coagulation  FXIII  produced  in  yeast  cells  (Saccharomyces  cerevisiae)  by  recombinant  DNA  technology. 
NovoThirteen (A-subunit) binds to free human FXIII B-subunit resulting in a heterotetramer [rA2B2] with a 
similar half-life to endogenous [A2B2].  
One vial of NovoThirteen contains catridecacog (recombinant coagulation factor XIII) (rDNA): 2500 IU per 3 
ml,  after  reconstitution  corresponding  to  a  concentration  of  833  IU/ml.  As  compared  to  NovoThirteen, 
pdFXIII concentrate contains approximately 62.5 IU/ml, such that larger volumes need to be administrated.  
The  recommended  dose  is  35  IU/kg  body  weight  approximately  once  monthly,  administered  as  an 
intravenous  bolus  injection.  This  will  result  in  a  maximum  plasma  concentration  of  5  μg/ml  and  is  not 
expected to exceed the available free FXIII– B2 subunit. 
NovoThirteen  was  approved  by  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  on  03  September  2012  and  was  first 
launched  in  Denmark  on  10  December  2012.  It  is  currently  indicated  for  the  long-term  prophylactic 
treatment of bleeding in patients with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency. 
As  per  currently  approved  labelling  of  NovoThirteen,  it  has  been  indicated  for  long-term  prophylaxis  of 
bleeding in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. The use of rFXIII other than for prophylactic 
treatment  in  patients  with  congenital  FXIII  A-subunit  deficiency  was  collected  as  one  of  the  secondary 
endpoints in the post-authorisation safety study (PASS) (NN1841-3868, MentorTM6). The results of this 
secondary endpoint suggest that rFXIII can also be used as a treatment of bleeds during the prophylactic 
regimen in these patients. Supportive results were also reported in a pivotal extension trial (F13CD-3720, 
mentorTM2) and a paper by Arokszallasi et al. 
Additionally,  in  F13CD-3720  and  NN1841-3868  it  was  demonstrated  that  prophylaxis  with  rFXIII  would 
alone be sufficient to avoid bleeding episodes during minor elective surgeries during prophylaxis in patients 
with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency.

As a consequence of the above, this group of variations requests to include addition of treatment of bleeding 
episodes  in  patients  with  congenital  factor  XIII  A-subunit  deficiency  in  the  indication  as  well  as  a 
posology-update related to minor surgeries.  
In  support  of  this  application,  the  MAH  submitted the  final  results  of  the  PASS  NN1841-3868  as  part  of 
commitment on post-authorisation measure MEA-003.1. This final study report also includes final data from 
the global Prospective Rare Bleeding Disorder Database (PRO-RBDD) registry. Two interim reports of PASS 
NN1841-3868 have been submitted previously. The second interim report covering the period from FPFV 
until  17th  May  2017  with  the  enrolment  of  30  patients  were  assessed  under  the  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/2284/MEA-15.1. 
The MAH has also updated the SmPC of NovoThirteen to align with the most recent QRD template, version 
10.1.  The  RMP  is  updated  to  version  15.0  based  on  the  study  results  from  the  PASS  NN1841-3868  and 
PRO-RBDD registry. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
• 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
The clinical development program of NovoThirteen consists of 12 completed Novo Nordisk sponsored clinical

trials with rFXIII as the investigational drug. Of these, 5 trials with a total of 82 subjects were conducted on 
the patient population with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency. White (59%) and Asian (17%) racial 
groups represented the largest populations among these patients. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetics data were submitted in this application. 
The half-life of NovoThirteen was assessed in the F13CD-1725 trial from a limited blood sampling scheme at 
1 hour, 14 and 28 days post-dose. Based on FXIII activity measured by the Berichrom assay in patients with 
congenital FXIII deficiency, a geometric mean half-life of 11.8 days was estimated. This is in agreement with 
the elimination pharmacokinetics estimated from a clinical pharmacology trial in healthy subjects, which 
determined the half-life to be 11.8 days. In this trial the mean volume of distribution at steady state was 47 
ml/kg, mean residence time was 15.5 days and mean clearance was 0.13 ml/kg. 
Paediatric population: in a pharmacokinetic trial 6 children (age 1 to less than 6 years old) with congenital 
FXIII A-subunit deficiency were exposed to one single i.v. dose of NovoThirteen 35 IU/kg. The mean t½ of 
FXIII was approximately 15 days (range: 10 to 25 days) and the mean clearance in children was 0.15 
ml/h/kg. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
In  plasma,  FXIII  circulates  as  a  heterotetramer  [A2B2]  composed  of  2  FXIII  A-subunits  and  2  FXIII 
B-subunits held together by strong non-covalent interactions. The FXIII B-subunit acts as a carrier molecule 
for the FXIII A-subunit in circulation and is present in excess in plasma. When the FXIII A-subunit is bound 
to the FXIII B-subunit [A2B2], the half-life of the FXIII A-subunit [A2] is prolonged. 
FXIII is a pro-enzyme (pro-transglutaminase), which is activated by thrombin in the presence of Ca2+. The 
enzymatic activity resides with the FXIII A-subunit. Upon activation, the FXIII A-subunit dissociates from the 
FXIII B-subunit and thereby exposes the active site of the FXIII A-subunit. The active transglutaminase 
cross-links fibrin and other proteins resulting in increased mechanical strength and resistance to fibrinolysis 
of the fibrin clot and contributes to enhanced platelet and clot adhesion to the injured tissue. 
NovoThirteen is a recombinant FXIII A-subunit is structurally identical to the human FXIII A-subunit [A2]. 
NovoThirteen (A-subunit) binds to free human FXIII B-subunit resulting in a heterotetramer [rA2B2] with a 
similar half-life to endogenous [A2B2]. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No new pharmacodynamic data were submitted in this application. 
At present there are no markers that can quantitatively assess the in vivo pharmacodynamics of FXIII. The 
results of standard coagulation tests are normal, as it is the quality of the clot that is affected. A clot solubility 
assay is widely used as an indicator of FXIII deficiency, but the assay is qualitative, and when performed 
correctly the test is positive only when the FXIII activity in the sample is close to zero. 
NovoThirteen has been shown to have the same pharmacodynamic properties in plasma as endogenous 
FXIII.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  currently  approved  SmPC  Section  5.2  reflects  pharmacokinetic  data  obtained  in  healthy  subjects 
(NN1841-3788),  patients (≥  6  years  old) in  the  pivotal phase  3  pivotal  trial F13CD-1725  and  paediatric 
patients (1-4 years) with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency (Study F13CD-3760). 
In  the  application,  the  MAH  updated  SmPC  Section  5.2  by  replacing  the  PK  data  from  healthy  subjects 
(NN1841-3788) by PK data from full PK profiles 23 patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency (age 
7-58  years)  in  Study  F13CD-3720  (PK  sub-study),  so  that  the  proposed  SmPC  Section  5.2  only  reflects 
pharmacokinetics obtained from patients as this is considered mostly relevant in clinical use.  
The Study F13CD-3720 was a safety extension study of the pivotal study F13CD-1725. In this multi-centre, 
open-label, single-arm, and repeat dose phase 3b trial on safety of monthly replacement therapy with rFXIII 
in subjects with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency, a total of 60 subjects were enrolled and exposed to 
trial drug which includes 34 subjects from trial F13CD-1725 and 26 new subjects. Of these 60 subjects, 16 
were paediatric and adolescents received NovoThirteen at a monthly dose of 35UI/Kg.  
The  final  results  of  Study  F13CD-3720  including  “Detailed  PK  report  for  patients  included  in  trial 
F13CD-3720”  have  been  previously  submitted 
in  procedures  EMEA/H/C/002284/P46/016  and 
EMEA/H/C/002284/II/0018, however, no assessment of PK data have been found in the AR.  
For  reminder,  the  summary  of  PK  results  presented  in  “Detailed  PK  report  for  patients  included  in  trial 
F13CD-3720” (cut-off date for PK: 3 December 2012) are displayed as following:

Table  3:  observed  and  estimated  PK  parameters  (based  on  the  FVIII  activity  assay)  for  the 
F13CD-1725 and the F13CD-3720 trail 
To summarise,  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Of all enrolled patients in Study F13CD-3720, 23 agreed to participate in the PK part. These patients 
are not considered different regarding baseline demographics compared to those not participating in 
the PK session and the mean PK results could therefore be considered as representative for the entire 
FXIII A-subunit congenital deficiency population. Of note, in FDA approved label of rFXIII (Tretten in 
US), the section 12.3 Pharmacokinetics in US Prescription Information reflects the results (baseline 
corrected) obtained from this PK study (n=23). 
The FXIII steady-state PK results, obtained from a total of 23 patients with congenital deficiency of 
FXIII are in good agreement with PK data from pivotal trial F13CD-1725 (repeat monthly dose of 35 
IU/kg  see  Table  6-1),  as  well  as  paediatric  Study  F13CD-3760  (a  single  dose  of  35  IU/kg,  cf  AR 
procedure EMEA/H/C/002284/II-02) 
The mean Cmax and Ctrough levels were constant over time, when compared to data obtained from 
the pivotal F13CD-1725 trial, supportive of a steady-state condition with no accumulation and clearly 
indicating that the clearance of rFXIII is not affected by any extrinsic or intrinsic factors. This is further 
supported by the comparable exposures, mean AUC0-28days obtained in the F13CD-3720 trial versus 
the mean AUC0-28days results obtained in the F13CD-1725 trial, 240.4 IU*h/mL and 248.2 IU*h/mL, 
respectively. 
The overall mean half-life of 13.9 days for the 23 patients participating in the PK session is comparable 
with the half-life reported in the F13CD-3760 trial (mean t1/2: 15.8 days), as well as the half-life 
reported in the F13CD-1725 trial (mean t1/2: 12.1 days). Also mean Cmax levels are in the same 
range  for  the  three  trials;  0.89  IU/mL,  0.69  IU/mL  and  0.77  IU/mL  for  trials  F13CD-3720, 
F13CD-3760 and F13CD-1725, respectively, as well as mean Ctrough values (0.17 IU/mL, 0.21 IU/mL 
and 0.19 IU/mL, respectively).  
Based on these results, the MAH presents the pharmacokinetic data from three clinical trials (F13CD-3760, 
F13CD-1725 and F13CD-3720) in proposed Section 5.2 of the SmPC. in the following table 3-1 to give a 
better overview of PK data in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency.

2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There are no updates related to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the product that might affect 
efficacy and/or safety of the marketed formulation of NovoThirteen.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The grouped variations are based on results from PASS NN1841-3868, safety extension Study F13CD-3720, 
PRO-RBDD registry and some relevant literature.  
Only the study report of PASS NN1841-3868 including PRO-RBDD has been submitted in this application. For 
Study F13CD-3720, no new data are found in the submission package. The final study report and the 
response submitted in 2016 have been assessed in procedures EMEA/H/C/2284/P46 016 and variation 
II/0018. 
Hence, the assessment is focusing on PASS NN1841-3868.

2.4.1.  Main study 
PASS NN1841-3868: “Use of rFXIII in treatment of congenital 
FXIII deficiency, a prospective multi-centre observational 
study.” 
Methods 
This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-centre, multinational observational non-interventional 
post-authorisation safety study (PASS) of safety related to treatment with rFXIII in patients with congenital 
FXIII A-subunit deficiency. No controls or blinding procedures are applied.  
The study report also includes results from the global prospective rare bleeding disorder database 
PRO-RBDD registry. The PRO-RBDD is an international database collecting prospective clinical and 
laboratory data of patients with rare bleeding disorders in order to gather information on the incidence of 
bleeding episodes and consumption of treatment products. A contractual collaboration (02 February 2012 to 
11 November 2018) with the registry had been established to collect data on patients with congenital FXIII 
A-subunit deficiency. 
Data was collected at: 
- Baseline: clinical history reported at patient’s enrolment. 
- Follow-up: prospective data collection on any clinical event (bleeding, pregnancy, surgery), treatment, 
adverse events or complications, every 6 months for a duration of three years, later extended to five years. 
Study participants

Objectives 
Primary objective: 
The aim of this non-interventional study is to investigate the incidence of specific ADRs associated with the 
use of rFXIII in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency, comprising anti-FXIII antibodies, allergic 
reactions, embolic and thrombotic events and lack of therapeutic effect. 
Secondary objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
To further explore the overall safety and effectiveness of rFXIII under conditions of routine clinical care in 
patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency, including special population (i.e., children, elderly, 
pregnant and lactating women, and patients with renal insufficiency). 
To assess the use of rFXIII in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency, also other than for 
prophylactic use. 
To better understand the use of rFXIII and practice patterns in the usual care of patients. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
• 
The  incidence  of  specific  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs)  in  patients  with  congenital  FXIII  A-subunit 
deficiency  treated  with  rFXIII,  comprising  anti-FXIII  antibodies,  allergic  reactions,  embolic  and 
thrombotic events and lack of effect, collected during a study period of up to 6 years. 
Secondary endpoints 
•  All serious adverse events collected during a study period of up to 6 years (which will be presented by all 
patients as well as by special populations comprising children, elderly, pregnant and lactating women, 
and patients with renal insufficiency) 
•  All medical events of special interest collected during a study period of up to 6 years 
•  All medication errors and near medication errors collected during a study period of up to 6 years 
•  Use  of  rFXIII  in  patients  with  congenital  FXIII  A-subunit  deficiency,  also  for  other  uses  than  for 
prophylactic treatment collected during a study period of up to 6 years 
•  Annualised bleeding rate collected during a study period of up to 6 years. 
Sample size 
Due to the rarity of the disease and very limited data with regards to adverse events, no formal calculation 
of sample size was conducted. It was determined by the market update of rFXIII for prophylactic treatment 
of patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency.

Statistical methods 
This was a purely descriptive study and the statistical analyses and presentations did not include any testing 
of pre-specified hypotheses. All analyses and presentations were based on the full analysis set, which was 
identical to the safety analysis set.  
The descriptions of main secondary endpoint related to this variation as well as bleeding assessments are 
listed below: 
• 
The  use  of  rFXIII  in  patients  with  congenital  FXIII  A  subunit  deficiency,  other  than  for  prophylactic 
treatment included on demand treatment (patients who do not receive regular treatment but are only 
treated  when  needed).  This  also  included  an  additional  product  dosage  for  patients  on  prophylactic 
treatment  to  treat  breakthrough  bleeds  in  relation  to  traumas,  surgeries,  and  spontaneous  bleeds 
referred to as “treatment of bleeds”.  
•  Definition of severity of bleeds:  
o  Mild/Moderate: Minor uncomplicated bleeds. 
o  Severe: Major bleeds which require hospitalisation. All head, CNS and neck bleeds were categorised 
as severe. 
•  Definition of haemostatic response: 
o  Excellent: abrupt pain relief and/or substantial improvement in signs of bleeding within 
approximately 8 hours after a single infusion. 
o  Good/Effective: some pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 
hours after infusion of product, but not requiring more than one infusion for complete bleeding 
arrest. 
o  Moderate/partly effective: slight beneficial effect on pain relief and/or minimal improvement in signs 
of bleeding within approximately 8 hours after the first product infusion, but not requiring more than 
one infusion for complete bleeding arrest. 
o  None: no improvement or worsening of symptoms or use of other FXIII products. 
•  Definition of major and minor surgery 
Major surgery is any invasive operative procedure where any one or more of the following occur: 
o  A body cavity is entered. 
o  A mesenchymal barrier (e.g., pleura, peritoneum or dura) is crossed. 
o  A fascial plane is opened. 
o  An organ is removed. 
o  Normal anatomy is operatively altered. 
Minor surgery is any invasive operative procedure in which only skin, mucous membranes, or superficial 
connective tissue is manipulated. Examples of minor surgery include vascular cut down for catheter 
placement, implanting pumps or ports in subcutaneous tissue, biopsies or placement of probes, leads, or 
catheters requiring the entry into a body cavity only through a needle/guidewire.  
Dental surgery will be classified as minor or major based on above definitions. 
•  Haemostatic response during surgery 
o  Excellent: blood loss less than expected. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/539227/2020 
Page 16/37 
 
 
  
  
o  Good: blood loss as expected. 
o  Moderate: blood loss more than expected. 
o  None: uncontrolled bleeding. 
•  Haemostatic response after surgery: 
o  Excellent: better than expected in this type of patient and procedure. 
o  Good: as expected in this type of patient and procedure. 
o  Moderate: less than optimal for the type of procedure, maintained without change of treatment 
regimen. 
o  None: bleeding due to inadequate therapeutic effect with adequate dosing, change of regimen 
required.  
All bleeding episodes including bleeding during prophylaxis, on-demand therapy and in relation to surgery, 
were further listed including information about cause, severity, location, date and time of onset, date and 
time of arrest, product name, dose, haemostatic response, related concomitant illness and related 
concomitant medication. Both treatment-requiring (i.e. rFXIII or Fibrogammin) and non treatment-requiring 
bleeding episodes was calculated for Annualised Bleeding rate (ABR) 
Results 
Recruitment 
Start of data collection (FPFV): 17 May 2013; End of data collection for final report (LPLV): 29 June 2019. 
A total of 30 patients were enrolled at 17 sites in 7 countries: Denmark (4), Canada (3), Spain (3), USA (13), 
United Kingdom (1), Hungary (1) and Italy (5), all were exposed to rFXIII in this study. 25 patients 
completed the study defined as minimum 2 years participation or 24 exposure days and 5 patients were 
withdrawn from the study:  
•  1 withdrawal by the investigator for noncompliant reason. 
•  4 withdrawals by patients for personal reasons including change of Haemophilia treatment centre. 
Conduct of the study 
PRO-RBDD registry  
As of the cut-off date of 11 November 2018, there were 4 patients of European origin who were registered 
in the PRO-RBDD registry and who were on prophylaxis with rFXIII, all with endogenous FXIII:C levels < 
2%. The age of the patients ranged from 20 to 41 years.  
All the patients had a history of severe bleeding, such as haemarthrosis, haematoma, and umbilical cord 
bleeding, in addition to mucocutaneous bleeding, before prophylaxis. Out of the 4 patients, 1 patient had a 
post-traumatic cutaneous bleeding and 1 patient experienced epistaxis during prophylaxis with rFXIII, with 
no need for further treatment. 
No AEs or treatment-requiring bleeding episodes were reported. One patient reported 2 events of pregnancy 
and had one spontaneous abortion, all of which occurred before the patient entered into the registry. There 
were no spontaneous bleeding episodes, no pregnancies and no major surgeries reported during the registry 
period.  
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

No patients had major surgery during the study. No pregnant and lactating women or patients with renal 
insufficiency  were  enrolled  in  this  study.  Consequently,  no  results  are  presented  for  these  two  special 
populations.  
Baseline data 
Table 6: Baseline demographics – full analysis set 
The mean age of the patients was 25.5 years, and there were slightly more males (n=17, 57%) than females 
(n=13, 43%). The majority (n=22, 73%) of the patients were White. 
Concomitant medications and illness/medical history at baseline 
17  of  30  patients  reported  concomitant  illness/medical  history  at  baseline,  in  particular  6  patients  had 
allergic reactions to pharmaceutical drug and 2 patients had a history of embolic/thrombotic events.  
At baseline, 25 patients were on prophylaxis, 4 patients were on supplemental doses of rFXIII or plasma 
derived  FXIII  products  (2  for  each)  while  on  prophylaxis  and  1  patient  was  on-demand  without  routine 
prophylaxis. For patients on prophylaxis, within the last 24 months prior to entry into the study, the mean 
of the number of bleeding episodes for treatment-requiring bleeds and for non treatment-requiring bleeds 
was 0.17 and 1.00 respectively. In the patient requiring on-demand treatment, neither treatment-requiring 
nor non treatment-requiring bleeding episodes were reported within the last 24 months prior to entry into 
the study.

Numbers analysed 
All analyses and presentations were based on the full analysis set (n=30), which was identical to the safety 
analysis set. No patients were excluded from the full analysis set. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Use of rFXIII other than for prophylactic treatment 
All  the  30  patients  in  the  study  were  on  prophylactic  treatment.  No  spontaneous  treatment-requiring 
bleeding episodes were reported. A total of 5 traumatic bleeding episodes in 4 patients were treated with an 
additional dose of rFXIII in the study. All the patients showed a good to excellent haemostatic response. In 
PRO-RBDD registry, no spontaneous or traumatic bleeding episodes were reported in any of 4 registered 
patients. 
A young adult patient had bleeding on the left knee, 10 days after the last prophylactic dose. He was treated 
with 36 IU/kg of rFXIII on 02 November 2015 and showed a good haemostatic response. The FXIII activity 
recorded on 22 October 2015 prior to the bleeding episode was 0.04 IU/mL. 
A teenager fell on the face and had a head injury, 7 days after the last prophylactic dose. She was treated 
with 53.3 IU/kg of rFXIII on 28 March 2016 and showed an excellent haemostatic response. The FXIII 
activity recorded on 12 May 2015, prior to the bleeding episode was 0.16 IU/mL. 
A child had bleeding when she fell directly on the knee, 23 days after the last prophylactic dose. She was 
treated with 37.6 IU/kg of rFXIII on 22 March 2017 and showed an excellent haemostatic response. The 
FXIII activity recorded on 23 February 2017 prior to the bleeding episode was 0.06 IU/mL. 
The same patient experienced distortion of the ankle, 16 days after the last prophylactic dose. She was 
treated with 36.3 IU/kg of rFXIII on 20 June 2018 and showed an excellent haemostatic response. The FXIII 
activity recorded on 04 June 2018 prior to the bleeding episode was 0.09 IU/mL. 
A baby received a prophylactic dose of rFXIII and underwent revision of circumcision on the same day. After 
18 days of this prophylactic dose, the patient fell on his abdomen and had haematoma to penile shaft. The 
patient’s haematoma was treated with 41.7 IU/kg of rFXIII and had an excellent haemostatic response. 
Annualised bleeding rate (ABR) 
A total of 65 bleeding episodes were reported by 14 of 30 patients (47%) in the study including: 
- 6 bleeding episodes required treatment with a FXIII containing product: 5 traumatic bleeding episodes 
were  treated  with  an  additional  dose  of  rFXIII  with  good  to  excellent  haemostatic  (see  above),  the  6th 
traumatic bleed was treated with Fibrogammin. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/539227/2020 
Page 19/37 
 
 
  
  
 
- 59 non FXIII treatment-requiring bleeding episodes, of which 41 bleeds were reported by a 6-year-old girl 
(Patient  ID  321001)  who  repeatedly  had  nose  bleeds.  Aminocaproic  acid  was  given  to  2  patients  for  4 
bleeding events. 
There were no spontaneous treatment-requiring bleeding episodes. None of patient was withdrawn from the 
study due to the lack of efficacy treatment.  
Table 9: Annualised bleeding rate of all bleeding episodes – full analysis set 
The  overall  estimated  (mean,  95%  CI)  ABR  for  all  bleeding  episodes  and  ABR  for  treatment  with 
FXIII-requiring bleeding episode was 0.850 [0.246; 2.940] and 0.066 [0.029; 0.150] bleeds/patient/year 
respectively. The mean duration of bleeds was 32.1 hours (SD: 48.0). 
Surgery 
There were no major surgeries during the study. A total of 6 patients underwent 9 minor elective surgeries 
during the study. Out of these, 5 patients had minor surgeries, 0-3 days after the last prophylactic dose. One 
patient had 2 minor surgeries, 12 and 15 days after the last prophylactic dose and received an extra dose of 
rFXIII of 23.2 IU/kg and 21.4 IU/kg prior to both surgeries respectively. The haemostatic response during 
and after the surgeries was good to excellent (the haemostatic response was missing for one surgery).  
Supportive study 
Study F13CD-3720: Safety Extension Trial to pivotal phase 3 study F13CD-1725  
Title: A Multi-Centre, Open-Label, Single-Arm, and Multiple Dosing Trial on Safety of Monthly Replacement 
Therapy with rFXIII in Subjects with Congenital Factor XIII Deficiency,  
Additional dose for breakthrough bleeds during prophylaxis  
In Study F13CD-3720 (long-term extension of phase 3 Study F13CD-1725), haemostatic response to rFXIII 
after  a  single  dose  of  35  IU/kg  for  treatment  of  breakthrough  bleeds  was  assessed  about  8  hours  after 
prophylactic rFXIII administration.  
Only one rFXIII-treated bleed was reported. This subject experienced a trauma-induced muscular bleed 24 
days after the latest prophylactic rFXIII dose. Approximately 34.7 IU/kg were administered as a single dose, 
and  the  haemostatic  response  was  rated  as  ‘excellent’.  No  additional  FXIII-containing  products  were 
necessary to treat the bleed.  
Surgery

In F13CD-3720, 12 minor surgeries were performed in 9 patients within 1 to 21 days of the last scheduled 
rFXIII dose (35 IU/kg). The longest period between a rFXIII dose and minor surgery was 3 weeks; based on 
PK modelling, it was estimated that the patient would have had a FXIII activity level of 0.19 IU/mL.  
In all 12 procedures, there were no reports of unexpected blood loss or requirements for transfusion with 
blood  or  blood  products;  no  surgical  complications  related  to  congenital  FXIII  A-subunit  deficiency  or 
treatment were reported, yet a good haemostatic outcome was observed in all these 12 instances.  
Literature:  
“The  use  of  recombinant  factor  XIII  in  a  major  bleeding  episode  of  a  patient  with  congenital  factor  XIII 
deficiency – the first experience” Arokszallasi A. et al Haemophilia (2015), 21, e70--e121 
On-demand treatment without routine prophylaxis 
Only one individual case was reported in the article of Arokszallasi et al (2015). A male patient with severe 
congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency experienced an intramuscular haematoma while not being on FXIII 
prophylaxis. This major bleeding episode was treated with a single dose of 35 IU/kg rFXIII and within the 
first 24 h after injection, pain, swelling and stiffness of the thigh decreased. The patient was fully mobilized 
on the fourth day after infusion of rFXIII. Thus, a single dose of rFXIII was effective in the management of 
this  major  bleeding  episode  in  a  patient  with  severe  congenital  FXIII  A-subunit  deficiency,  who  was  not 
previously treated with rFXIII. 
Minor elective surgery 
Two dental procedures were carried out under rFXIII cover in a patient: 
•  On the 6th post infusion day after the first dose of rFXIII, a patient developed acute pulpitis of a tooth. As 
FXIII activity was 32%, tooth-extraction was performed without additional FXIII support. 
•  A second dental manipulation was scheduled for the same patient on the day of the first prophylactic 
infusion after tooth extraction. This was carried out with a FXIII activity of 68%. 
•  No bleeding complication followed in either of the procedures. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study design of PASS NN1841-3868  
Title: Use of rFXIII in treatment of congenital FXIII deficiency, a prospective multi-centre observational 
study 
This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-centre, multinational observational non-interventional 
post-authorisation safety study (PASS) of safety related to treatment with rFXIII in patients with congenital 
FXIII A-subunit deficiency. No controls or blinding procedures are applied. The study report also includes 
results from the global prospective rare bleeding disorder database (PRO-RBDD) registry.  
The PASS NN1841-3868 was designed to address the question in a real-world setting “What is the long-term 
safety and effectiveness of rFXIII in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency and what are the 
current clinical treatment practices for rFXIII use?”. All study visits are to be performed according to normal 
local clinical practice and no additional visits are to be conducted due to the participation in this study.  
For this observational PASS, a number of bias and limitation would occur due to potential confounding 
factors (e.g. selection bias) and data collect in a real-life setting (e.g. incorrectness of dose and bleeding 
evaluation by patient). The very few inclusion and no exclusion criteria would reduce selection bias. 
The total study duration was 6 years, all patients should have either a minimum of 2 years’ participation or 
24 exposure days whichever came first, unless the patient had dropped out. Such long-term follow-up is 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/539227/2020 
Page 21/37 
 
 
  
  
considered reasonable and appropriate for expansion of knowledge of safety and efficacy of rFXIII for the 
treatment of patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. 
As one of the secondary endpoint, data of “use of rFXIII other than for prophylactic treatment in patients 
with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency” were collected; and based on the results of this secondary 
endpoint, the MAH requests to include addition of “treatment of bleeding episodes” in patients with 
congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency in the indication as well as a posology-update related to minor 
surgeries in this group variations. 
This was a purely descriptive study and the statistical analyses and presentations did not include any 
comparison or testing of pre-specified hypotheses. 
Results 
A total of 30 patients were enrolled at 17 sites in 7 countries, all were exposed to rFXIII in this study. 
Considering the rarity of congenital FXIII deficiency, the enrolment of 30 patients before the planned end of 
recruitment date is highly appreciated, and the sample size is satisfactory. Of them, 25 patients completed 
the study (i.e. ≥ 2 years participation or 24 ED) and 5 were withdrawn for incompliant or personnel reason. 
No patients had major surgery, no pregnant or lactating women and no patients with renal insufficiency were 
enrolled.  
All the 30 patients in the study were on prophylactic treatment. No spontaneous treatment-requiring 
bleeding episodes were reported. A total of 5 traumatic bleeding episodes were treated in 4 young patients 
during prophylaxis, all were mild/moderate and showed a good to excellent haemostatic response. The FXIII 
activity recorded prior to bleedings ranged from 0.04 IU/ml to 0.16 IU/ml.  
Based on these results, the MAH claimed the extension of indication, by adding “treatment bleeding 
episodes”.  
As a reminder, the study protocol defined that the use of rFXIII in patients with congenital FXIII A subunit 
deficiency, other than for prophylactic treatment included two sub-groups: 
1/ on demand treatment (patients who do not receive regular treatment but are only treated when needed).  
2/ an additional product dosage for patients on prophylactic treatment to treat breakthrough bleeds in 
relation to traumas, surgeries, and spontaneous bleeds. 
None of patients was in on demand sub-group 1. All of 4 patients who treated for their traumatic bleeds were 
currently on long-term prophylactic regimen with rFXIII (Prophylaxis sub-group 2) and all of 5 episodes of 
breakthrough bleeds occurred during their regular prophylaxis.  
Hence, the MAH was requested to modify the updates in section 4.1 “Therapeutic indications” of the SmPC 
of NovoThirteen as following in order to clearly reflect the real recorded data: 
“4.1 Therapeutic indications 
Long term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency.  
As supplementary treatment to management of breakthrough bleeding episodes during regular prophylactic 
treatment regimen.   
NovoThirteen can be used for all age groups.” (SmPC, MO) 
In the response to 1st RSI, the MAH acknowledges that all patients in the PASS NN1841-3868 were on 
monthly prophylaxis regimen and none of patients were treated on-demand. However, the MAH continues to 
consider that treatment of a bleeding episode with NovoThirteen in a patient NOT on monthly prophylaxis is 
a relevant treatment option and proposes to add “treatment of episodic bleedings in patients not covered by 
prophylaxis” in the section 4.1 “Therapeutic indications” of the SmPC of NovoThirteen, on the basis of the 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/539227/2020 
Page 22/37 
 
 
  
  
supportive information such as single dose PK data, mechanism of action of NovoThirteen (endogenous FXIII 
A-subunit) and clinical experiences for pdFXIII products over 20 years of on-demand treatment in patients 
with FXIII A-subunit deficiency when not on prophylaxis. 
The provided rationale is not considered substantial enough to support the extension of indication of 
on-demand treatment. Indeed, although the therapeutic effect of NovoThirteen may be expected when it is 
administrated to treat bleeding episodes in patients not covered by prophylaxis; no clinical trial has 
confirmed this potential effect neither with pd FXIII nor with rFXIII. No relevant supportive information has 
been found in the references 4, 5, 6 indicated by the MAH in the response. 
Hence, it was agreed that the indication wording should remain as requested in RSI as follows: 
“Long term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency.  
Treatment of breakthrough bleeding episodes during regular prophylactic treatment regimen.  
NovoThirteen can be used for all age groups.”  
By supplementary responses on 3rd and 13th July 2020, the MAH agreed with revising the indication (MO) 
on SmPC 4.1 extension of indication as well as comments on 4.2.  
Of note, the MAH withdrew the request for extended marketing protection period of NovoThirteen. 
Furthermore, the deletion of all information on “On-demand treatment” in the section 4.4 Special warning 
and precautions of the SmPC was not considered acceptable. The information regarding very limitation of 
“on-demand treatment” was maintained as follows: 
“On-demand treatment was not studied in clinical development programme. Until further results are 
available, alternative treatment should be considered in such situations.” (SmPC, OC) 
In the response to 1st RSI, the MAH has accepted to keep section "On-demand treatment" in SmPC Section 
4.4. as requested and proposed the following wording which is considered acceptable: 
“On-demand treatment of patients not on prophylactic treatment was not studied in clinical development 
programme”. 
It is noted that the FXIII trough level was relatively low in these 4 patients under long-term prophylaxis by 
rFXIII (mean Ctrough 0.087 ± 0.045 IU/ml), as compared to the geometric mean FXIII Ctrough reported in 
pivotal children and adult studies (0.21±0.05 and 0.18±0.07 IU/ml respectively), suggesting therapeutic 
response decreased in these patients and insufficient FXIII trough level for preventing breakthrough 
bleeding. The MAH was requested to provide an estimation of FXIII trough level in all patients participating 
in the PASS NN1841-3868 with available PK data.  
The requested PK data have been provided and compared to Study F13CD-3720 (PK sub-study: geometric 
mean C28days = 0.16 IU/mL range 0.03-0.32 at steady-state). In PASS NN1841-3868, only 11 out of 30 
patients had FXIII trough assessed at the central laboratory within 28 ± 2 days and contributed with 40 FXIII 
trough assessments. The geometric mean C28 ± 2 days was 0.16 IU/mL (range 0.05−0.32), so comparable 
to the trough value reported for PK sub-study F13CD-3720, i.e. geometric mean C28days = 0.16 IU/mL 
(range 0.03-0.32). 
Two of 4 patients having bleeds under prophylaxis have received an additional dose of rFXIII at 53.3 IU/kg 
and 41.7 IU/kg respectively for the treatment bleeding episodes. Such doses were much higher than the 
recommended dose (35 UI/kg), but they corresponded to the stable prophylactic doses received by these 
patients prior to their bleed.  
The MAH was requested to clarify the following issues:

- A teenager was treated with an additional dose of rFXIII for breakthrough bleeding on 28 March 2016, i.e. 
7 days after the last regular monthly prophylaxis on 21 March 2016. While the FXIII activity prior to the 
bleeding episode was recorded on 12 May 2015 (10 months ago). Please clarify. 
In the response to 1st RSI, the MAH acknowledges the error in reporting the wrong date and clarifies that in 
this PASS NN1841-3868 the blood samples for evaluation of FXIII activity were drawn at the discretion of the 
investigator and there was no systematic evaluation of FXIII activity values due to the non-interventional 
nature of the study.  
- A child received a prophylactic dose on 23 February 2017 (38th month). She was treated with “an 
additional” dose of rFXIII for bleeding episode on 22 March 2017 (39th month), i.e. one month later, not “23 
days after the last prophylactic dose” as mentioned on page 33 of study report. Please clarify or correct. This 
patient received her next monthly prophylactic dose was on 19 April 2017 (40th). Please clarify, why the 
39th month-dose was accounted as “an additional dose” but not a regular prophylactic dose.  
In the response to 1st RSI, the MAH clarified that the additional dose (22 March 2017) was administered for 
the treatment of the bleeding episode as confirmed and reported by site. Although close in time for the next 
regular prophylaxis dose, Novo Nordisk accounts the 39th month-dose as an additional dose and not a 
regular prophylactic dose.  
In NN1841-3868, no differences in the treatment responses were observed between the paediatric and adult 
population. 3 of 4 patients were children (2, 12 and 13 years old), it is agreed that no dose adjustment is 
required when NovoThirteen is used in paediatric patients and the dose of 35 IU/kg body weight should be 
used for both prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes. 
Annualised bleeding rate (ABR) 
The mean rate of bleeding episodes requiring treatment with rFXIII was 0.066 bleeds/patient/year, which is 
very low as compared to that reported in pivotal phase 3 study F13CD-1725 (0.138 bleeds/patient/year). 
This PASS proved that regular prophylaxis with rFXIII prevents breakthrough bleeding in congenital FXIII 
deficient patient and thus confirmed haemostatic efficacy of NovoThirteen for long-term routine prophylactic 
treatment of congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency.  
Minor elective surgery 
There were no major surgeries during the study. A total of 6 patients underwent 9 minor elective surgeries 
during the study. No bleeding complication followed in minor surgical procedures. The haemostatic response 
during and after the surgeries was good to excellent (the haemostatic response was missing for one 
surgery). 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the above discussions, NovoThirteen has shown to be effective in treatment of breakthrough 
bleeding episodes as well as minor surgeries during long-term regular prophylaxis during in patients with 
congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. Further efficacy conclusions are as follows: 
•  A total of 7 bleeding episodes in 6 patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency were reported. The 
haemostatic outcome in all the bleeds treated with rFXIII was good or excellent. Based on these results, 
Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of SmPC, Sections 2 and 3 of package leaflet were updated. 
•  A total of 23 minor surgeries were performed in 16 patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. Of 
these, 21 surgeries were covered by a single prophylactic dose of rFXIII for each surgery. 
•  One patient from NN1841-3868 who underwent 2 surgeries received an additional vial (2500 IU) of rFXIII 
prior to each surgery. 
•  All the patients who underwent minor surgeries (in F13CD-3720 and NN1841-3868) had a successful 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/539227/2020 
Page 24/37 
 
 
  
  
haemostatic outcome of good or excellent, except for 1 patient whose haemostatic outcome was missing. 
Based on these results, posology of rFXIII during minor surgeries is updated in Sections 4.2 and 5.1 of 
SmPC. 
• 
In NN1841-3868, no differences in the treatment responses were observed between the paediatric and 
adult population. The same has been updated in Section 5.1 of SmPC and reflected accordingly in Section 
3 of package leaflet.  
Taken together, the use of rFXIII other than for prophylactic treatment in patients with congenital FXIII 
A-subunit deficiency was collected as one of the secondary endpoints in the PASS NN1841-3868, and 
recorded results demonstrates that rFXIII can also be used as a treatment of bleeds during the prophylactic 
regimen in these patients. Additionally, in the pivotal extension study F13CD-3720 and NN1841-3868, it was 
demonstrated that prophylaxis with rFXIII would alone be sufficient to avoid bleeding episodes during minor 
elective surgeries in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency.

Adverse events 
Table 14: Overview of adverse events -safety analysis set 
A  total  of  18  patients  had  44  adverse  events  (60.0%).  The  44  adverse  events  were  mainly  within  the 
MedDRA  SOCs  of  “Infections  and  infestations”  (11  events  reported  in  7  patients,  PTs  included 
nasopharyngitis,  sepsis,  conjunctivitis,  gastroenteritis  viral,  influenza,  sialoadenitis,  tonsillitis  and  upper 
respiratory  tract  infection),  “Nervous  system  disorders”  (7  events  reported  in  4  patients,  PTs  included 
dizziness, post-traumatic headache, dysarthria and headache), “General disorders and administration site 
conditions” (6 events reported in 4 patients, PTs included chest discomfort, fatigue, influenza like illness and 
therapeutic response decreased), and “Injury, poisoning and procedural complications” (5 events reported 
in 4 patients, PTs included contusion, accidental overdose, ligament sprain and limb injury).  
30 of 44 AEs were mild in 13 patients (43.3%). There was 1 severe AE of sepsis reported. A total of 13 
moderate AEs were reported in 10 patients (33.3%). None of the patients were withdrawn from the study 
due to AEs.

Adverse events with possible or probable relation to study product 
A total of 11 events reported by 7 patients (23.3%) were evaluated to be possibly or probably related to the 
rFXIII by the investigator. None of these events were SAE and the patients recovered from all the events.  
 Medical events of special interest  
There were 4 medical events of special interest reported in this study. 
Primary endpoint: specific adverse drug reactions 
The specific ADRs included anti-FXIII antibodies, allergic reaction, embolic and thrombotic events and lack 
of therapeutic effect. 
A total of 3 specific ADRs in 2 patients were reported in this study; 2 incidences of positive non-neutralising 
anti-rFXIII antibody in one patient at 2 time-points (12 May 2015 and 22 June 2015) and a suspected lack 
of therapeutic effect in another patient. 
The incidence of non-neutralising anti-rFXIII antibody concerned a 6-year-old female patient who tested 
positive  at  two  visits  for  a  total  period  of  2.5  years.  The  patient  developed  low-titre  transient 
non-neutralising  anti-rFXIII  antibodies  after  several  years  of  treatment  with  NovoThirteen.  No  clinical 
findings were associated with these antibodies and there was no evidence of lack of effect.  
The event of suspected lack of therapeutic effect concerned a young child. The patient was on rFXIII since 24 
February 2015. The patient repeatedly had nose bleeds (41 episodes) which occurred when she got hit on 
the nose while playing. The patient had received the prophylactic dose on 31 October 2018. On 14 November 
2018,  the  investigator  reported  decreased  therapeutic  response.  The  FXIII  activity  recorded  on  20 
November 2018 was 0.4 IU/mL. The next prophylactic dose was on 30 November 2018. Since FXIII activity 
was 0.4 IU/mL on 20 November 2018, the FXIII activity would be >0.4 IU/mL on 14 November 2018, when 
the investigator reported the suspected lack of therapeutic response. Hence, the patient had normal FXIII 
in-vitro  activity  levels  and  also  had  no  anti-rFXIII  antibodies.  The  patient  recovered  from  the  event  of 
suspected lack of therapeutic effect in December 2018. 
None of the patients withdrew from the study due to lack of efficacy of the rFXIII product.

There were no neutralising antibodies reported during the study period. There were no allergic reactions and 
no embolic and thrombotic events assessed as related to rFXIII reported in this study. 
Medical errors 
There was one case of accidental overdose reported: The case concerned a teenager who had an accidental 
overdose of rFXIII (63.3 IU/kg; a whole vial of the product was administered instead of half vial); the patient 
did not have any clinical consequences due to this event. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
A total of 10 SAEs were reported in 7 patients. A brief summary of the SAEs is provided below: 
Case: a young adult reported haemarthrosis of moderate severity for which he was hospitalised. Ultrasound 
of  the  knee  revealed  haematoma.  The  patient  received  an  extra  dose  of  rFXIII  to  treat  the  event  and 
recovered. The event was unlikely related to the product as assessed by investigator. 
Case: a young adult experienced pain in the right leg and was admitted to the hospital. A CT scan revealed 
a ruptured ovarian follicle without bleeding. The patient was discharged from the hospital and recovered 
from the event. The event was unlikely related to the product as assessed by investigator.  
This patient also had a medical history of tightness of chest and reported 3 non-serious events of chest 
discomfort. The first 2 events were possibly related to the product and the third event was probably related 
to the product as assessed by the investigator. All the 3 events recovered.  
Case: a teenager reported post-traumatic headache of moderate severity. Patient was hospitalised, and a CT 
scan was performed which did not reveal any abnormality and the patient recovered from the event. The 
event was unlikely related to the product as assessed by investigator. 
Case: a middle aged patient reported dizziness of mild severity during an appointment for receiving rFXIII 
prophylaxis; the event occurred before the dosage. The patient had received medications due to tooth pain 
prior to the visit; he was hospitalised for observation following symptoms of dizziness, recovered from the 
event. The event was unlikely related to the product as assessed by investigator. This patient also presented 
with influenza of moderate severity in September 2017. He had symptoms of tenderness in the left side of 
the chest and dry cough which developed into increased pain in thorax and fever. Five days later, the patient 
received the regular rFXIII prophylaxis dose. The patient had headache, dizziness, slightly sensitive to light, 
shortness of breath and radiation of pain to the left upper arm. The patient also presented with ventricular 
extrasystoles and palpitation. The patient was hospitalised for deep vein thrombosis which started with a 
phlebitis  at  a  peripheral  vein  catheter  on  the  hand  during  the  first  day  of  an  influenza-hospitalization. 
Peripheral  vein  catheter  site  was  changed  to  the  elbow  flexion  where  the  patient  developed  another 
phlebitis.  After  discontinuation  of  these,  continuous  ongoing  redness  and  tenderness  was  observed. 
Ultrasound of the right upper extremity described a thrombosis. A pulmonary ventilation-perfusion scan was 
performed which excluded pulmonary embolism. The patient recovered and was discharged beginning of 
October  2017.  According  to  the  investigator,  the  condition  was  due  to  a  combination  of  a  systemic 
inflammation due to influenza together with a local tissue irritation and endothelia activation due to ongoing 
peripheral venous catheter phlebitis which had caused the patient’s superficial venous thrombosis. Both the 
events  of  influenza  and  deep  vein  thrombosis  were  unlikely  related  to  the  product  as  assessed  by 
investigator. 
Case:  In  2018,  9  days  after  receiving  the  rFXIII  prophylaxis  dose,  the  patient  (a  very  young  child) 
experienced  swelling  of  the  salivary  glands  and  lymph  nodes  of  the  neck.  An  ultrasound  scan  revealed 
sialoadenitis and the patient was hospitalised and treated with oral antibiotics. The patient was recovered 
from the event 4 days later. The event was unlikely related to the product as assessed by investigator.

Case: In 2017, a young adult presented to the hospital with chills, abdominal pain with the concern for a 
urinary tract infection (UTI). A urinalysis performed was negative for UTI. A CT scan of the abdomen and 
chest x-ray did not reveal any findings. Four days later, the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of sepsis 
due to an unclear source. In January 2018, the patient presented to the emergency room with symptoms 
similar  to  the  previous  episode  of  sepsis.  The  patient  was  treated  with  antibiotics,  recovered  and  was 
discharged  3  days  later.  Both  the  events  of  sepsis  were  unlikely  related  to  the  product  as  assessed  by 
investigator. 
Case: an elderly patient with medical history of osteoarthritis of the hip, who reported arthralgia (hip pain) 
of moderate severity. The patient was hospitalised and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the right 
hip was performed which revealed a small right hip effusion with some early osteoarthritic changes. After 
treatment with analgesics, the patient recovered. The event was unlikely related to the product as assessed 
by investigator. 
Death 
There were no deaths reported in this study. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety of rFXIII during pregnancy 
Pregnancies  in  women  with  FXIII  deficiency  have  a  significant  risk  of  miscarriage,  bleeding,  placental 
abruption and post-partum haemorrhage if not on prophylaxis treatment. The combined guideline from the 
United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors’ Organisation (UKHCDO) and the Royal College of Obstetricians 
and  Gynaecologists  (RCOG)  recommends  increased  intensity  prophylaxis  during  pregnancy  using  FXIII 
plasma concentrate or rFXIII (if A-subunit deficiency). Dosing frequency should be increased from every 28 
days to every 14–21 days to maintain a FXIII activity level of more than 0.2 IU/mL. For delivery, consider 
additional  FXIII  concentrate  10-40  IU/kg  once  during  established  labour  or  before  caesarean  section, 
depending on the interval since last prophylaxis. Coagulation factors are large molecules unlikely to cross 
the  placental  barrier.  Replacement  therapy  with  rFXIII  is  not  expected  to  affect  pregnancy  or  offspring 
negatively.  
The table below provides an overview of cases form F13CD-1725, F13CD-3720, relevant literature and 
post-marketing surveillance, where patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency were treated with 
rFXIII during pregnancy.

and  a  healthy  baby  was born.  The pregnancy  occurred while 
the patient was using contraception (Meliane). 
This  case  concerned  a  young  adult  with  congenital  FXIII 
A-subunit deficiency who became pregnant after being treated 
with rFXIII for 1 month. The patient had previously given birth 
to 2 healthy infants and was not interested in more children; 
therefore, the pregnancy was terminated. 
26 years/ 1st trimester  Discontinued  Normal child  A young adult with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency who 
had been treated with rFXIII for 19 months became pregnant 
while  using  contraception.  The  pregnancy  resulted  in  a  male 
child  born  after  being  exposed  to  rFXIII  in  utero  in  the 
beginning of the pregnancy (mother received no dosing after 
the last menstrual cycle). After birth, an echocardiogram of the 
baby  revealed  a  minor  septal  defect  and  a  patent  ductus 
arteriosus;  the  events  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  as 
unlikely related to rFXIII.

This  young  adult  with  congenital  FXIII  A-subunit  deficiency 
reported  a  pregnancy  and  subsequently  experienced  a 
spontaneous  abortion.  The  patient  had  previously  been 
pregnant 5 times and had given birth to 3 healthy children. The 
patient was withdrawn from the study after being treated with 
rFXIII for 4.5 years. No contraception was used at the time of 
conception. 
This  case  concerned  a  young  adult  with  congenital  FXIII 
A-subunit  deficiency  who  had  been  treated  with  rFXIII  for  4 
years.  The  foetus  was  exposed  to  rFXIII  during  the  1st 
trimester. A routine ultrasound at gestational week 7 revealed 
that  the  pregnancy  was  ectopic.  The  pregnancy  was 
terminated, and the patient was withdrawn from the study; the 
event  was  assessed  as  unlikely  related  to  rFXIII.  Patient’s 
history includes 1 child born at week 25 who died 21 days later. 
32 years/ 3 weeks 
Discontinued  Normal child  This  case  concerned  a  young  adult  with  congenital  FXIII 
A-subunit  deficiency  treated  with  rFXIII  for  4  years  for 
congenital 
factor  XIII  deficiency.  The  pregnancy  was 
discovered  via  urine  testing  at  the  patient’s  end-of-trial  visit 
(oral contraceptive was used). The child was exposed to rFXIII 
for  3  weeks.  According  to  the  information  available,  no 
complications were reported in the pregnancy. The pregnancy 
resulted  in  a  healthy  baby  boy.  After  delivery,  the  patient 
developed postpartum haemorrhage due to uterine atony; the 
outcome of the event was reported as recovered.

A-subunit deficiency. The patient was treated with 2500 units 
of Tretten® (rFXIII) monthly. Eight (8) days after the last dose 
of rFXIII, the patient presented with H1N1 influenza and was 
diagnosed  with  HELLP  syndrome.  As  a  consequence  of  the 
HELLP  syndrome,  a  caesarean  section  was  performed.  The 
pregnancy resulted in the birth of a normal male child and the 
outcome  of  the  events  was  reported  as  recovered.  A  causal 
relationship with rFXIII was assessed as unlikely.

A  heterozygous  pregnant  patient  with  congenital  FXIII 
A-subunit deficiency was treated with a single dose of Tretten® 
(rFXIII)  prophylactically  prior  to  her  caesarean  section 
(C-section).  The  patient’s  C-section  was  performed  in  a 
controlled environment to avoid any complications during the 
surgery.  She  had  never  received  FXIII  replacement  therapy 
prior to this event. Attempts have been made to follow up, but 
no further information is available.

a- Reason for no prior dose in the heterozygous pregnant woman: In general, heterozygous patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency do not 
require prophylaxis as they do not experience severe haemorrhage.28 However, some heterozygous women with FXIII deficiency may require FXIII 
prophylaxis due to the well-described decrease of FXIII levels during pregnancy.29, 30

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Main study PASS NN1841-3868: Primary endpoint: specific ADRs 
A total of 3 specific ADRs in 2 patients were reported in this study; 2 incidences of positive non-neutralising 
anti-rFXIII antibody in one patient at 2 time-points and a suspected lack of therapeutic effect in another 
patient. 
There  were  no  allergic  reactions  or  embolic  and  thrombotic  events  assessed  as  related  to  rFXIII  or 
neutralising antibodies against rFXIII reported during the study. 
Secondary safety endpoints 
Of the 30 patients, a total of 18 patients reported 44 adverse events of which 11 events in 7 patients were 
evaluated to be possibly or probably related to the rFXIII. All the related AEs recovered. 
In total, there were 10 SAEs reported by 7 patients during the study; all the SAEs were unlikely related to the 
rFXIII as assessed by the investigator and all the SAEs recovered. 
There were 4 medical events of special interest reported during the study and all the events recovered. 
PRO-RBDD results 
As of the cut-off date of 11 November 2018, there were 4 patients of European origin who were registered 
in the PRO-RBDD registry and who were on prophylaxis with rFXIII, all with endogenous FXIII:C levels < 
2%. The age of the patients ranged from 20 to 41 years. No adverse events or treatment-requiring bleeding 
episodes were reported as of the cut-off date.  
Taken together and regarding the safety updates proposed by the MAH in this variation: 
•  NovoThirteen prophylaxis during pregnancy in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency did not 
show  any  particular  safety  concerns.  As  a  result,  the  MAH  proposed  to  update  Section  4.6  of  SmPC 
accordingly. 
•  In  NN1841-3868, no differences in the safety profile was observed in the paediatric population when 
compared to the adult population. As a result, the MAH proposed to update Section 5.1 of SmPC and 
Section 3 of package leaflet accordingly. 
•  No allergic reactions or embolic and thrombotic events assessed as related to rFXIII were reported in 
NN1841-3868. 
•  In PRO-RBDD registry, no pregnancies and no adverse events were reported as of the cut-off date of 11 
November 2018.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The MAH is seeking an extension of indication for NovoThirteen to include treatment of bleeding episodes in 
patients with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency as well as minor surgery. Updates of PK proprieties 
based on the results of study NN1841-3868, F13CD-3720 and the PRO-RBDD registry are also proposed. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Congenital coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder in which 
reduced plasma FXIII activity is caused by quantitative or rarely by qualitative defects in the FXIII A-subunit 
protein. Much less commonly, FXIII deficiency is caused by defects in the FXIII B-subunit protein. FXIII 
deficiency has an estimated worldwide prevalence of 1 per 2 to 5 million individuals. In patients with FXIII 
A-subunit deficiency the FXIII activity level is lower than 3 to 5% (or approximately 0.04 to 0.06 IU/mL), 
compared with a wide range of approximately 50% to 220% (0.60 to 2.60 IU/mL) in the normal population. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Given that intracranial bleeding is common in FXIII deficiency and may be a presenting feature later in 
childhood, most cases receive long-term prophylaxis with FXIII concentrate. Current treatment options in 
FXIII deficiency include cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, plasma-derived FXIII (pdFXIII) concentrate 
(Fibrogammin / Corifact) and recombinant FXIII subunit-A (rFXIII, NovoThirteen). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
In support of this application, the MAH submitted the final results of the PASS NN1841-3868 as part of 
commitment on post-authorisation measure MEA-003.1. This final study report also includes final data from 
the global Prospective Rare Bleeding Disorder Database (PRO-RBDD) registry. Two interim reports of PASS 
NN1841-3868 have been submitted previously. The second interim report covering the period from FPFV 
until 17th May 2017 with the enrolment of 30 patients were assessed under the procedure 
EMEA/H/C/2284/MEA-15.1. 
PASS NN1841-3868 was a prospective, single-arm, multi-centre, multinational observational 
non-interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS) of safety related to treatment with rFXIII in 
patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. No controls or blinding procedures were applied. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
A total of 7 bleeding episodes in 6 patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency were reported. The 
haemostatic outcome in all the bleeds treated with rFXIII was good or excellent.  
A total of 23 minor surgeries were performed in 16 patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. Of 
these, 21 surgeries were covered by a single prophylactic dose of rFXIII for each surgery. 
One patient from NN1841-3868 who underwent 2 surgeries received an additional vial (2500 IU) of rFXIII 
prior to each surgery. 
All the patients who underwent minor surgeries (in F13CD-3720 and NN1841-3868) had a successful 
haemostatic outcome of good or excellent, except for 1 patient whose haemostatic outcome was missing.

Based on these results, posology of rFXIII during minor surgeries is updated in Sections 4.2 and 5.1 of 
SmPC. 
In NN1841-3868, no differences in the treatment responses were observed between the paediatric and adult 
population.  
Taken together, the use of rFXIII other than for prophylactic treatment in patients with congenital FXIII 
A-subunit deficiency was collected as one of the secondary endpoints in the PASS NN1841-3868, and 
recorded results demonstrates that rFXIII can also be used as a treatment of bleeds during the prophylactic 
regimen in these patients. Additionally, in the pivotal extension study F13CD-3720 and NN1841-3868, it was 
demonstrated that prophylaxis with rFXIII would alone be sufficient to avoid bleeding episodes during minor 
elective surgeries in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In PASS NN1841-3868, none of patients was on demand treatment defined as patients who do not receive 
regular treatment but are only treated when needed per protocol. All of 4 patients who treated for their 
traumatic bleeds were currently on long-term prophylactic regimen with rFXIII and all of 5 episodes of 
breakthrough bleeds occurred during their regular prophylaxis. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The primary endpoint of study PASS NN1841-3868 was the incidence of specific adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency treated with rFXIII, comprising anti-FXIII 
antibodies, allergic reactions, embolic and thrombotic events and lack of effect, collected during a study 
period of up to 6 years. 
A total of 3 specific ADRs in 2 patients were reported in study PASS NN1841-3868; 2 incidences of positive 
non-neutralising anti-rFXIII antibody in one patient at 2 time-points and a suspected lack of therapeutic 
effect in another patient. 
Secondary safety endpoints 
Of the 30 patients, a total of 18 patients reported 44 adverse events of which 11 events in 7 patients were 
evaluated to be possibly or probably related to the rFXIII. All the related AEs recovered. 
In total, there were 10 SAEs reported by 7 patients during the study; all the SAEs were unlikely related to the 
rFXIII as assessed by the investigator and all the SAEs recovered. 
There were 4 medical events of special interest reported during the study and all the events recovered. 
PRO-RBDD results 
As of the cut-off date of 11 November 2018, there were 4 patients (3 males and one female) of European 
origin who were registered in the PRO-RBDD registry and who were on prophylaxis with rFXIII, all with 
endogenous FXIII:C levels < 2%. The age of the patients ranged from 20 to 41 years. No adverse events or 
treatment-requiring bleeding episodes were reported as of the cut-off date. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Based on the provided data and since the last PRAC PSUR AR, no safety concerns were observed with the use 
of NovoThirteen prophylaxis in congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A long-term non-interventional post-authorisation safety study PASS NN1841-3868 has been conducted in 
a real-world setting in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency, who received rFXIII. This 
prospective single-arm, multi-national PASS addressed the long-term safety and effectiveness of rFXIII in 
patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency and the current clinical treatment practices for rFXIII use 
in all age groups. 
A total of 30 patients were enrolled, of which 13 were children and adolescents, 15 adults and 2 elderlies. No 
spontaneous treatment requiring bleeds occurred during 6-year study period. None of the patients withdrew 
from the study due to the lack of efficacy. Six traumatic bleeding episodes were managed with additional 
dose of rFXIII during regular prophylaxis regimen and all had excellent or good response. Haemostatic 
responses observed during and after minor surgeries were favourable.  
No safety concerns were raised. 
The real-world data from this PASS showed that rFXIII prophylaxis every 4 weeks is effective and well 
tolerated for treatment and preventing bleeds in patients with congenital FXIII-A subunit deficiency. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit-risk balance for rFXIII remains overall favourable and unchanged. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The  overall  B/R  of  Novothirteen  is  positive.  In  PASS  NN1841-3868,  none  of  patients  was  on  demand 
treatment. Therefore, no clear conclusion could be drawn in the treatment of episodic bleedings in patients 
not covered by prophylaxis. As a consequence, Novothirteen can only be recommended for the long term 
prophylactic  treatment  of  bleeding  in  patients  with  congenital  factor  XIII  A-subunit  deficiency,  and  as 
supplementary treatment to management of breakthrough bleeding episodes during regular prophylactic 
treatment  regimen.  By  supplementary  responses  on  3rd  and  13th  July  2020,  the  MAH  agreed  with  this 
conclusion and updated the SmPC (4.1 and 4.2) as requested.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Degarelix is a selective gonadotrophin releasing-hormone (GnRH) antagonist that competitively and reversibly 
binds to the pituitary GnRH receptors, thereby rapidly reducing the release of the gonadotrophins, luteinizing 
hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and thereby reducing the secretion of testosterone (T) 
by the testes. Prostatic carcinoma is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to treatment that removes 
the source of androgen. Unlike GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists do not induce a LH surge with subsequent 
testosterone surge/tumour stimulation and potential symptomatic flare after the initiation of treatment. 
A single dose of 240 mg degarelix, followed by a monthly maintenance dose of 80 mg, rapidly causes a decrease 
in  the  concentrations  of  LH,  FSH  and  subsequently  testosterone.  The  serum  concentration  of 
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) decreases in a similar manner to testosterone. 
Degarelix is effective in achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression well below medical castration level 
of 0.5 ng/ml. Maintenance monthly dosing of 80 mg resulted in sustained testosterone suppression in 97% of 
patients for at least one year. No testosterone microsurges were observed after re-injection during degarelix 
treatment. Median testosterone levels after one year of treatment were 0.087 ng/ml (interquartile range 0.06-
0.15) N=167. 
The first maintenance dose should be given one month after the starting dose. Degarelix Accord may be used 
as  neo-adjuvant  or  adjuvant  therapy  in  combination  with  radiotherapy  in  high-risk  localised  and  locally 
advanced prostate cancer.  
The therapeutic effect of degarelix should be monitored by clinical parameters and prostate specific antigen 
(PSA)  serum  levels.  Clinical  studies  have  shown  that  testosterone  (T)  suppression  occurs  immediately  after 
administration of the starting dose with 96% of the patients having serum testosterone levels corresponding 
to medical castration (T≤0.5 ng/ml) after three days and 100% after one month. Long term treatment with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/380123/2023 
Page 7/20 
 
 
 
 
maintenance dose up to 1 year shows that 97% of the patients have sustained suppressed testosterone levels 
(T≤0.5 ng/ml).  
In case the patient's clinical response appears to be sub-optimal, it should be confirmed that serum testosterone 
levels  are  remaining  sufficiently  suppressed.  Since  degarelix  does  not  induce  a  testosterone  surge  it  is  not 
necessary to add an anti-androgen as surge protection at initiation of therapy. 
The Pharmacotherapeutic group of degarelix is endocrine therapy, other hormone antagonists and related 
agents, ATC code: L02BX02. 
This centralised application concerns a generic application according to article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
for Degarelix Accord 80 mg and 120 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection, indicated for the 
identical therapeutic indications at the same dosage as the reference medicinal product. The applicant is 
Accord Healthcare S.L.U.  
The  originator  product  is  Firmagon  80  mg  and  120  mg  powder  and  solvent  for  solution  for  injection 
(EU/1/08/504/001-003).  No  bioequivalence  (BE)  study  was  carried  out,  instead  a  clinical  overview  on  the 
clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety has been provided, and refers to the publications up to year 2021, 
and thus considered up to date. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as powder and solvent for solution for injection. The product is available in 
two strengths, containing 80 mg or 120 mg of degarelix (equal to 84 mg or 126 mg of degarelix acetate, 
respectively) per vial, and solvent pre-filled in a syringe barrel. After reconstitution of each product strength, 
each ml of the reconstituted solution contains 20 mg or 40 mg of degarelix, respectively. 
The other ingredient of the powder is: mannitol. 
The solvent is: water for injections. 
As described in section 6.5 of the SmPC, the product is available in: 
A glass (type I) vial with bromobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium-plastic cap containing the powder. 
A glass (type I) pre-filled syringe barrel with luer tip and tip cap, fluoropolymer coated bromobutyl rubber 
containing the solvent. 
The product is considered a drug-device combination product. Besides the medicinal product (vial with 
powder), and the syringe barrel pre-filled with solvent, the following CE-marked medical devices are co-
packaged in the same tray: vial adapter and sterile hypodermic needle for single use (25 G 0.50 x 25 mm). 
The tray also contains a plunger rod, which is to be attached to the syringe barrel prior to use. The 
presentations for the 80-mg strength consist of one or three trays in a cardboard box, the presentation for 
the 120-mg strength consists of two trays in a cardboard box.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
2.2.2.1.  General Information 
The chemical name of degarelix acetate is N-Acetyl-3-(naphthalen-2-yl)-D-alanyl-4-chloro-D-phenylalanyl-3-
(pyridin-3-yl)-D-alanyl-L-seryl-4-({[(4S)-2,6-dioxohexahydropyrimidin-4-yl]carbonyl}amino)-L-phenylalanyl-
4-ureido-D-phenylalanyl-L-leucyl-N6-(1-methylethyl)-L-lysyl-L-prolyl-D-alaninamide acetate corresponding to 
the molecular formula C82H103ClN18O16·xC2H4O2.  
The amino acid - three letter code sequence is:  
Ac-D-2Nal1-D-4Cpa2-D-3Pal3-Ser4-4Aph(L-Hor)5-D-4Aph(Cbm)6-Leu7-Lys(iPr)8-Pro9-D-Ala10-NH2 
Where: 2Nal is 2-Naphthylalanine, 4Cpa is 4-Chlorophenylalanine, 3Pal is 3-Pyridylalanine, Hor is hydroorotyl, 
Lys(iPr) is N6-Isopropyllysine, 4Aph is 4-Aminophenylalanine, and Cbm is the carbamoyl group. 
The active substance has a relative molecular mass of 1632.26 g/mol (as free base) and the following 
structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The elucidation of the chemical structure of degarelix and the measurement of its solid-state properties  were 
performed by amino acid analysis and the following tests: UV, IR, MS, NMR (1H, 13C, DEPT, COSY, HSQC and 
HMBC), XRPD, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), circular dichroism 
spectrum, amino acid complete sequence test, amino acid composition and configuration analysis, FTIR, 
amino acid ratio, and elemental analysis.  
The active substance is a white or off-white hygroscopic and amorphous powder, very slightly soluble in N,N-
dimethylformamide, soluble in water and 1% acetic acid, and slightly soluble in methanol and ethanol. 
Degarelix is a synthetic linear decapeptide composed of 10 amino acids in the backbone, each of which has a 
chiral center, plus 1 chiral center (L-Hor) on the side chain of 5 L-Aph, resulting in 11 chiral centers in total. 
Seven of the amino acids are unnatural, five of which are D-amino acids. Enantiomeric purity is controlled 
routinely by control of chirality of individual protected amino acid starting materials, and by the active 
substance specification.

Polymorphism is not critical due to the administration of the product as a solution. 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented in the ASMF-restricted part.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances.  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised, the control 
is in line with relevant ICH and EU guidelines. 
The active substance is not provided sterile. 
2.2.2.3.  Specification(s) 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual), optical rotation (Ph.Eur.), identity 
(IR, HPLC, MS), acidity (pH by Ph.Eur.), related substances (three HPLC methods), isomer XI (GC-MS), 
oligomers (HPLC-SEC), amino acid ratio (HPLC), acetic acid (HPLC) and trifluoroacetic acid content 
(HPLC),residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph.Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), nickel (ICP-MS), bacterial 
endotoxin (Ph.Eur),microbiological quality (Ph.Eur) and assay (HPLC).  
ICH Q3A is not strictly applicable to synthetic peptides, Ph. Eur. substances for pharmaceutical use (general 
monograph 2034) thresholds for synthetic peptides apply. The proposed limits for individual impurities are 
compliant with Ph.Eur. monograph 2034. 
Residual solvent specification limits are based on ICH Q3C or based on observed data.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for three commercial scale batches of active substance are provided. The results are 
within specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
packaging representative for the proposed commercial packaging for up to 24 months under long term 
conditions (5°C ±3°C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25°C / 60% RH) according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 
one batch. Results on stress conditions were also provided as part of analytical method validation. 
The following parameters were tested in the long term and accelerated studies: appearance, optical rotation, 
identification, pH (acidity), related substances (HPLC methods 1, 2, 3), isomer XI, oligomers, assay, acetic 
acid, water, microbial quality, and bacterial endotoxins. Both at accelerated conditions and at long-term 
Assessment report  
EMA/380123/2023

conditions, all tested parameters remained within the specification limits; total impurities increased in parallel 
to the increase of degradation impurities. The stability results indicate that the active substance 
manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed re-test 
period and storage condition  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.2.3.1.  Vial with powder 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is Degarelix Accord, powder and solvent for solution for injection, is presented in two 
strengths: 80 mg and 120 mg. The finished product is provided as a vial with white or off-white powder, and 
a pre-filled syringe barrel with the solvent (sterile water for injections).  
There is an overfill to assure the withdrawal of 80 mg or 120 mg of degarelix from the vial. The overfill was 
adequately justified. 
The finished product was developed as a generic to the reference medicinal product Firmagon®.  
The two excipients present in the formulation (mannitol and water for injections) are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The excipients are included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as a sterile lyophilised powder for subcutaneous 
injection (after reconstitution), in two strengths (80 mg and 120 mg), enabling administration of a starting 
dose of 240 mg via two separate subcutaneous injections of 40 mg/mL, and a maintenance dose of 80 mg in 
a single subcutaneous injection of 20 mg/mL, containing the same active substance salt (degarelix acetate) 
and the same excipient (mannitol) as the reference medicinal product and bioequivalent and with quality 
attributes, container closure system and in-use conditions after reconstitution with water for injections 
equivalent to the reference medicinal product.  
The following CQAs were identified: appearance, identity, pH, related substances, water content, optical 
density, viscosity, assay, sterility, and bacterial endotoxins. 
Considering that the reference medicinal product contains the same active substance and excipient 
(mannitol) in the same quantities, and the stability data package from the applicant, compatibility between 
active substance and the excipient was sufficiently demonstrated.  
The applicant has utilised quality by design principles in the formulation development and manufacturing 
process development. The formulation and manufacturing process development have been evaluated through 
the use of risk assessment to identify the product CQAs, critical process steps and critical process parameters 
that may have an influence on the finished product quality attributes. The critical process parameters have 
been adequately identified. 
The key aspects of the development were to optimize formulation variables that could potentially negatively 
impact finished product CQAs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/380123/2023

The nature of the active substance (a heat-sensitive peptide), and the need for a sterile formulation, justify 
the choice of sterile filtration with aseptic processing as manufacturing method. Compatibility of the product 
with manufacturing materials was adequately demonstrated. 
Medial fill studies and process validation were adequately performed. 
Suitable holding times and conditions were defined for the manufacturing process. Degarelix has a self-
aggregation property and a tendency to gelatinize. The product forms a gel depot when injected 
subcutaneously, which results in gradual release of the peptide. According to the literature, plasma/tissue 
proteins are essential for the degarelix depot formation. To characterize gelling kinetics, in-vitro studies were 
performed. 
To simulate the slow release of the drug from this depot, an in-vitro drug release method was developed.  
The applicant demonstrated essential similarity to the reference medicinal product Firmagon® based on in-
vitro studies following FDA´s draft product specific guidance on degarelix acetate, comparing test attributes 
related to primary and secondary structure, purity, physicochemical properties, gelling kinetics, in vitro drug 
release, and biological activity. 
The results of immunogenicity testing showed no strong immune response. 
The container closure system of Degarelix Accord 80 mg and 120 mg consists of a 10 mL glass (Type I) vial, 
with bromobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium-plastic cap. 
The primary packaging material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Responding to a Major Objection (MO) raised during the procedure, the applicant provided suitable 
clarification on the extension of validity of GMP certificate (in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic) covering 
the applicable areas, workshops and activities of the manufacturing site. 
Several holding times and conditions are established, which were acceptably justified. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies.  
Process validation (with three commercial scale batches per product strength) demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification(s)  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance 
(visual),  identity  (UV,  HPLC),  pH  (Ph.Eur.),  reconstitution  time  (in-house),  related  substances  (two  HPLC 
methods),  oligomers  (SEC),  acetic  acid  (HPLC),  water  content  (Ph.Eur.),  optical  density  (Ph.Eur.),  viscosity 
(Ph.Eur.),  visible  particles  (Ph.Eur.),  sub-visible  particles  (Ph.Eur.),  bacterial  endotoxins  (Ph.Eur),  sterility 
(Ph.Eur), uniformity of dosage units (Ph.Eur.) and assay (HPLC). 
During the evaluation procedure, two MOs were raised on the specifications of the finished product: one on 
the proposed impurity limits which were consequently tightened in line with the qualification threshold set in 
Assessment report  
EMA/380123/2023

Ph. Eur. 2034 and the available batch data; and one on the proposed viscosity range, which was 
consequently tightened in line with the available batch data. The potential presence of elemental impurities in 
the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for 
Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 3 commercial scale batches using a validated method was 
provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the 
respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not 
necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on 
the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the 
“European Medicines Regulatory Network approach for the implementation of the CHMP Opinion pursuant to 
Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) Nº 726/2004 for nitrosamine impurities in human medicines 
(EMA/425645/2020).  Overall, based on the information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of 
nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control 
measures are deemed necessary.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches of each strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of each strength of finished product, stored for up to 24 
months under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH), 12 months under intermediate conditions (30°C / 65% 
RH), and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided, with vials placed in both upright and inverted positions. The product is in a single use 
packaging and batches used for stability were identical to those proposed for marketing and were packaged 
in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, pH, reconstitution time, related substances 1 and 2, acetic 
acid, water, oligomers, optical density, viscosity, visible and sub-visible particles, bacterial endotoxins, sterility 
and  assay.  The  analytical  methods  used  were  the  same  as  for  release  and  were  stability  indicating.  In  the 
accelerated stability study, after 6 months storage, some individual impurities as well as total impurities were 
out of specification, both in product stored in upright and inverted position, and for both product strengths. 
There was no trend visible for the other tested attributes. In the intermediate stability study, after 12 months 
storage,  one  individual  impurity  increased  to  the  stability  limit  with  an  upward  trend  for  other  individual 
impurities and for total impurities (but still within specifications), both in product stored in upright and inverted 
positions, and for both strengths. There was no trend visible for the other tested attributes. 
In  the  long-term  stability  study,  after  24  months  storage,  an  upward  trend  was  visible  for  some  individual 
impurities and total impurities, but less pronounced than under the accelerated and intermediate studies, with 
all results well within specification limits, both in product stored in upright and inverted positions, and for both 
strengths. There was no trend visible for the other tested attributes.

One commercial scale batch of each strength was tested for photostability (ICH Q1B); this study demonstrated 
that the product is stable to light exposure.   
An in-use study was performed for both product strengths, with fresh product and product close to expiry. The 
powder was reconstituted with water for injections as per the instructions in the package insert, and then drawn 
up  and  stored  in  the  syringe  for  0,  1,  2,  and  4  hours  at  room  temperature  to  simulate  pre-administration 
storage. Then the solution was tested for appearance, pH, osmolality, related substances 1 and 2, assay, optical 
density,  viscosity,  oligomers,  and  visible  and  sub-visible  particles.  Test  results  demonstrated  chemical  and 
physical in-use stability for 4 hours at 25°C, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3).  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months and storage condition `Store below 
25°C, as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.3.2.  Solvent – water for injections in pre-filled syringe barrel 
Since the solvent (WFI) is an excipient of the medicinal product (and included in section 6.1 of the SmPC) 
and the syringe barrel serves both as primary container closure system, and as administration device (after 
mounting of the plunger), the applicant provided both a ‘drug product’ section and evidence of compliance 
with the GSPRs from the Medical Devices Regulation for the WFI-pre-filled syringe barrels. 
The syringe barrels pre-filled with 3 mL of WFI are to be used with the 120 mg strength vials; the syringe 
barrels pre-filled with 4.2 mL of WFI are to be used with the 80 mg strength vials. 
The reference medicinal product Firmagon has the same solvent (water for injections). 
The primary packaging is a Glass (type I) syringe barrel with luer tip and tip cap and a fluoropolymer coated 
bromobutyl rubber plunger. The material complies with Ph.Eur. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Compatibility  of  the  manufacturing  materials,  including  extractables  and  leachables  testing,  was  adequately 
demonstrated.  
The syringe barrels filled with WFI are terminally sterilised. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing WFI-pre-filled syringe barrels of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Container closure integrity post-sterilisation was validated and demonstrated that the container closure system 
of  the  WFI-filled  barrels  ensure  adequate  product  integrity.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this 
filling/stoppering and terminal sterilisation process for the WFI-pre-filled syringe barrels.  
Assessment report  
EMA/380123/2023

Product specification(s)  
The release specifications for the WFI-pre-filled syringe barrels include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form:  appearance  (visual),  conductivity  (Ph.Eur.),  oxidisable  substances  (Ph.Eur.),  residue  on  evaporation 
(Ph.Eur.),  visible  particles  (Ph.Eur.),  sub-visible  particles  (Ph.Eur.),  bacterial  endotoxins  (Ph.Eur.),  sterility 
(Ph.Eur.), container content (Ph.Eur.), stopper sliding force (in-house), tightness of syringe body (in-house). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. No reference standards are used. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches of each fill volume, confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of WFI-pre-filled syringe barrels of each fill volume, stored 
for up to 18 months under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions  (40°C  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  WFI-pre-filled 
syringe barrels are identical to those proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, conductivity, visible particles, sub-visible particles, bacterial endotoxins, 
sterility, container content, stopper sliding performance and tightness of syringe body. No significant changes 
have been observed. In addition, one batch of each fill volume was exposed to light as per ICH Q1B guideline. 
The study demonstrated that light exposure did not cause any change to the WFI-pre-filled barrels.  
Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months, without any special storage 
condition is acceptable. The SmPC (section 6.3) however mentions `Store below 25°C` in view of the vials 
with powder containing the active substance which are co-packaged with a pre-filled syringe barrel, a vial 
adapter, a needle and a plunger in a tray in a cardboard box. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and the finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. During the procedure, 3 MOs were raised to which the applicant 
responded adequately by 1) clarifying the validity of GMP certificate covering the applicable areas, workshops 
and activities of the finished product manufacturing site; 2) tightening the acceptance criteria for two 
impurities (Qualification threshold Ph. Eur. 2034); and 3) tightening the acceptance criteria for viscosity 
based on batch results, both on the finished product specification (powder vial). The results of tests carried 
out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to 
the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its manufacturing 
process. The QbD approach was used to define the QTPP and identify the CQAs, but no design spaces were 
claimed for the manufacturing process of the finished product.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of Degarelix acetate are well known. As 
Degarelix acetate is a widely used, well-known active substance, the applicant has not provided additional 
studies and further studies are not required. Overview based on literature review is, thus, appropriate. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Degarelix Acetate manufactured by Accord Healthcare is considered unlikely to result in any significant 
increase in the combined sales volumes for all Degarelix containing products and the exposure of the 
environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature concerning non-clinical data of Degarelix Accord was provided and was accepted 
by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non-clinical studies were not 
considered necessary. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for powder and solvent for solution for injection containing degarelix acetate. To 
support the marketing authorisation application the applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as efficacy and safety of degarelix acetate based on 
Assessment report  
EMA/380123/2023 
Page 16/20 
 
 
 
published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the reference medicinal product. 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) in its current version is of 
particular relevance. 
Exemption  
No bioequivalence study or other biopharmaceutic studies have been performed. These studies are not 
considered necessary based on the following facts: 
• 
The product is solution for subcutaneous administration using the same active substance in the same 
concentration as the reference product and the same excipients in similar amounts as the reference 
product.  
•  Since the generic version of Degarelix acetate contains the same qualitative and quantitative 
composition as the European reference product the efficacy and safety of the product should be 
assumed to be the same as that of Firmagon, which has been demonstrated by its continuous clinical 
use for more than 10 years. 
• 
The essential similarity of the product has been justified by detailed comparative studies. To 
summarise, essential similarity was justified by performing the following comparisons: 
•  Compositions of the powder and solvent for solutions for injection 
• 
Physical characterization of the originator product and applied product (appearance, reconstitution 
time, optical density, viscosity, pH, visible/sub-visible particulate contamination) 
•  Chemical attributes of the solutions for injections (assay, related substances) 
• 
Primary and secondary sequence comparison 
•  Gelling kinetics 
• 
in-vitro drug release 
•  Biological activity, binding studies 
•  Aggregation states 
Degarelix Accord is considered essentially similar to the reference medicinal product Firmagon, Ferring 
Pharmaceuticals. The justification for not submitting an in vivo bioequivalence study is acceptable. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The application contains an adequate review of published clinical data. The indications applied are the same as 
for  the  reference  product,  as  well  as  the  method  of  administration,  posology,  patient  population  and 
pharmaceutical form. The absence of bioequivalence studies is acceptable.  
Approval is recommended from a clinical point of view.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of the reference medicinal product Firmagon 80 mg powder and 
solvent  for  solution  for  injection  and  Firmagon  120  mg  powder  and  solvent  for  solution  for  injection.  The 
reference product Firmagon is a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist indicated:  
- for treatment of adult male patients with advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer.  
- for treatment of high-risk localised and locally advanced hormone dependent prostate cancer in combination 
with radiotherapy.  
-  as  neo-adjuvant  treatment  prior  to  radiotherapy  in  patients  with  high-risk  localised  or  locally  advanced 
hormone dependent prostate cancer. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available non-
clinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient.  
From  a  clinical  perspective,  this  application  does  not  contain  new  data  on  the  pharmacokinetics  and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview 
on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature is considered sufficient. 
From quality perspective, all issues have been resolved.  
3.1.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit /risk balance of Degarelix Accord is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome

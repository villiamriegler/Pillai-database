The participants were randomised in a 3:3:2 ratio in the following study groups:
• Group 1 (investigational group – sequential administration): MenACYW conjugate vaccine on Day 
(D) 01 and 9vHPV* + Tdap-IPV vaccines on D31;
• Group 2 (control group – sequential administration): Nimenrix® on D01 and 9vHPV* + Tdap-IPV 
vaccines on D31;
• Group 3 (investigational group – concomitant administration): MenACYW conjugate vaccine + 
9vHPV* + Tdap-IPV vaccines on D01.
*Note: This was the first dose of 9vHPV vaccine, of the 2-dose or 3-dose series according to the 
national recommendations and age of the participant. These additional vaccinations for the completion 
of 9vHPV vaccine schedule took place outside of the objectives and scope of this study.

Objective(s)
Primary Immunogenicity Objective
To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the seroprotection rate (serum bactericidal assay using human 
complement [hSBA] titer ≥ 1:8) to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y following the 
administration of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) compared to a single dose of 
Nimenrix (Group 2).
Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives
1. To describe the antibody response of meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y measured by 
hSBA, before and 1 month following meningococcal vaccination administered alone (Groups 1 
and 2) or concomitantly with 9vHPV and Tdap-IPV vaccines group (Group 3).
2. To describe the antibody response of meningococcal serogroup C measured by hSBA, before 
vaccination and at D31 after vaccination with the MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® 
(Groups 1 and 2) according to MenC primed status.
3. To describe the antibody response against antigens of 9vHPV and Tdap-IPV vaccines, before 
and 1 month following vaccination.
Safety Objective
To describe the safety profile in each group after each and any vaccination.
Outcomes/endpoints
Primary endpoint: Seroprotection against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y measured by hSBA 
titer ≥ 1:8 in Groups 1 and 2, on Day (D)31 (+14 days).
Besides the primary endpoint several secondary immunogenicity and safety endpoints as well as 
observational immunogenicity endpoints were pre-defined.
EMA/59102/2024
Page 12/40
Table 5: Safety endpoints and time windows for collection Study MEQ00071
The SafAS was defined as those subjects who had received at least one dose of the study vaccine(s) 
and had safety data available after any vaccination. For each SafAS, all participants had their safety 
analyzed according to the study vaccine they received.
Sample size
Approximately 464 participants were expected to be enrolled.
For the Primary Objective
With 174 enrolled participants in Group 1 and Group 2 each, the study will have a > 90% power 
(Farrington and Manning formula) to declare the non-inferiority of Group 1 versus Group 2 based on A, 
C, W, and Y hSBA antibody titers ≥ 1:8 (difference in the percentage of seroprotected participants in 
the 2 groups) after a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix®, assuming:
• A 10% dropout rate from the PPAS (155 participants evaluable per Group 1 and Group 2)
• A 1-sided alpha level of 2.5%
• A non-inferiority margin of 10% (percentage difference)

Randomisation and blinding (masking)
Randomisation and allocation Procedures
On the day of enrollment, participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and who sign the 
Assent Form (AF) and whose parents/legally acceptable representatives sign the Informed Consent 
Form (ICF) will be randomly assigned to Groups 1, 2, or 3 in a 3:3:2 ratio.
The site staff will connect to the interactive response technology (IRT) system, enter the identification 
and security information, and confirm a minimal amount of data in response to IRT system prompts. 
The IRT system will then provide at least the participant number and vaccine group assignment. The 
IRT will also state whether the participant has been assigned to the D07 blood draw subset (first 60 
participants of Group 3 only), and whether the participant will be in the rSBA testing subset (first 50 
participants of each group). The full detailed procedures for group allocation are described in the 
Operating Guidelines. If the participant is not eligible to participate in the study, then the information 
will only be recorded on the participant recruitment log.
Blinding and Code-breaking Procedures
The study will be performed in a partially observer-blind fashion:
Groups 1 and 2 are observer-blind:
• Investigators and study staff who conduct the safety assessment, participants, parents/legally 
acceptable representatives, the Sponsor, and laboratory personnel performing the serology testing will 
be kept blinded to the vaccine received
• Only the study staff who prepare and administer the vaccine and are not involved with the safety 
evaluation will know which vaccine is administered
Group 3 is open-label:
• Everyone involved in the study (i.e., Investigator, study staff, the Sponsor, participants, 
parents/legally acceptable representatives) will know which vaccine is administered. This open-label 
design for Group 3 is due to the different vaccination schedule for this group than for Groups 1 and 2.
EMA/59102/2024
Page 14/40
Statistical Methods
The primary objective will be met if the following null hypothesis is rejected for each of the 4 serogroup 
A, C, W, Y:
where p(MenACYW) and p(Nimenrix) are the percentages of participants who achieve an hSBA titer ≥ 
1:8 in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and the comparator group (Nimenrix®), respectively.
The 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in proportion will be computed using the Wilson 
Score method without continuity correction (Newcombe method). If the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% 
CI of the difference between the 2 percentages is > -0.1, the non-inferiority will be demonstrated. 
Non-inferiority will be demonstrated if all 4 individual null hypotheses (4 serogroups) are rejected.
Results
Study participants
A total of 464 participants were planned to be enrolled, while a total of 463 participants were enrolled 
and randomised in this study: 173 participants were randomised to Groups 1 and 2 and 117 
participants to Group 3. 
Overall, there were 312 males (67.4%) and 151 females (32.6%) included. There were more males 
than females in all vaccination groups. There were 124 males (71.7%) and 49 females (28.3%) in 
Group 1, 116 males (67.1%) and 57 females (32.9%) in Group 2, and 72 males (61.5%) and 45 
females (38.5%) in Group 3. The male/female ratio was 2.53 in Group 1, 2.04 in Group 2, and 1.60 in 
Group 3. Most participants were White (97.0%), followed by Asian participants (1.1%).
The mean age of participants was similar (12.6 years [±2.38]) in all vaccination groups.
Of the 462 randomised participants with a history of meningococcal C vaccination, 326 participants 
(70.4%) were previously vaccinated with meningococcal C vaccine (“MenC primed participants”) and 
136 participants (29.4%) were not (“MenC naive participants”): MenC primed participants were 120 
(69.4%) in Group 1, 119 (68.8%) in Group 2, and 87 (74.4%) in Group 3; MenC naive participants 
were 53 (30.6%) each in Groups 1 and 2, and 30 (25.6%) in Group 3.

EMA/59102/2024
Page 16/40
The most frequently reported major protocol deviation was “IMP administered but not as per protocol” 
in 48 participants (10.4%). Indeed, 48 participants were wrongly administered with Tdap-IPV and/or 
9vHPV vaccines in the same arm as MenACYW conjugate vaccine. One critical protocol deviation was 
reported in 4 participants (2.3%) in Group 1: “IMP not fit for use but dispensed/administered”.
Sensitivity Analyses based on study deviations
It was discovered during internal data review that 144 participants were wrongly enrolled with 
unblinding group data at Sponsor level. Thus, to assess the impact on safety data, the safety overview 
table excluding the prematurely unblinded participants will be displayed.
A recurring deviation has been detected during internal data reviews: some participants were wrongly 
administered with Tdap-IPV and/or 9vHPV in the same arm as MenACYW conjugate vaccine. To assess 
the impact on safety data, the safety overview, the solicited injection site and systemic reactions by 
duration, the summary of unsolicited AEs and unsolicited AEs by maximum intensity, time of onset and 
duration tables excluding the participants having received Tdap-IPV and/or 9vHPV in the same arm as 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine will be displayed.
Recruitment
Study period (first participant first visit to last participant last visit): 16 March 2021 to 11 May 2022.
The analyses presented in this report are based on a database lock date of 01 March 2023.
In total, the study was run at twenty-two study centres in Europe (Spain, Italy and Hungary) and in 
Asia (Singapore).

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects
The main purpose of study MEQ00071, a Phase IIIb study conducted in Spain, Italy, Hungary, and 
Singapore, was to compare MenACYW conjugate vaccine, a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate 
vaccine, with a licensed quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide (Groups A, C, W- 135, Y) 
conjugate vaccine (Nimenrix) in the adolescent population. Nimenrix is widely used in several 
countries, but no data on MenACYW conjugate vaccine versus Nimenrix has been generated in the 
adolescent population to date. The MEQ00071 study included both MenC naive adolescents and 
adolescents who have received at least one dose of a MenC vaccine before 2 years of age, in order to 
explore the impact of MenC priming in infancy on MenC immune responses induced by the MenACYW 
conjugate vaccination in adolescents. Additionally, this study has also generated co-administration 
data on MenACYW conjugate vaccine with 2 adolescent vaccines: 9-valent human papilloma virus 
(9vHPV) vaccine and tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis, and inactivated poliomyelitis (Tdap-IPV) 
vaccine. MEQ00071 was conducted between 16 March 2021 (first participant first visit) and 11 May 
2022 (last participant last visit). 
The MAH intends to submit a Type II variation with Product Information update in Q1 2024 with the 
MEQ00071 study data. Of note, study MEQ00071 is not included in the MenQuadfi Paediatric 
Investigational Plan (EMA procedure number: EMEA-001930-PIP01-16-M04). MenQuadfi is currently 
indicated in the European Union from the age of 12 months and older against invasive meningococcal 
disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y.
Population: Overall, there were more male (67.4%) than female (32.6%) subjects. The male/female 
ratios were 2.53 in Group 1, 2.04 in Group 2, and 1.60 in Group 3. Especially the imbalance across 
groups is critically noted. Furthermore, there were slightly more MenC primed participants in Group 3 
(74.4%) than in Group 1 (69.4%) and Group 2 (68.8%). This imbalance across groups had an impact 
on study results with respect to antibody titers for serogroup C. Therefore, separate analyses were 
provided for MenC-primed and MenC-naive subjects which is appreciated (see discussion below).
Tdap-IPV vaccines are licensed in several member states and participants were excluded when having 
been vaccinated with Tdap-IPV vaccines within the previous 3 years before enrolment. However, it is 
not clear if locally recommended vaccination schedules / basic immunisation schedules have been 
completed. Nevertheless, nearly all participants had a vaccination history against Tetanus (96.0, 98.8, 
and 97.4% in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively), Diphtheria (96.0, 98.8, 97.4%), Pertussis (96.0, 98.8, 
97.4), and Polio (96.0, 98.8, 97.4%). Gardasil9 (9vHPV) is approved centrally in the EU and 
recommended for subjects from the age of 9 years. Participants previously having received a human 
papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination were excluded from enrolment, which can be followed. 
Protocol deviations: During internal data review, it was discovered that 144 participants were 
wrongly enrolled with unblinding group data at the Sponsor level. The Applicant states that after 
investigation, it was determined that this major deviation had no impact on the study conduct 
regarding the safety assessment and data collection, and the immunology data analysis. Apparently, 
no unblinding occurred at the site level (i.e., no unblinding data were accessible for investigators and 
no sample for immunogenicity analysis has been sent to the laboratory) at that time. In order to clarify 
any possible impact on safety data analysis, a sensitivity analysis was provided with only subjects 
included in the Overall Safety Analysis Set that were not impacted by the unblinding issue. Although 
the sample size decreased from 171 to 99 subjects in non-impacted Group 1 and from 171 to 100 in 
the non-impacted Group 2, the rates of participants experiencing at least 1 safety event were similar 
to the “compromised” Overall Safety Set. In fact, the rate of only a few parameters increased ≥5% 
between the non-impacted to the “compromised” Overall Safety Analysis Set in Group 1 (solicited 
injection site reactions after injection of MenACWY (50.5% to 57.4%), unsolicited AE (35.4% to 
40.4%), unsolicited AR (4.0% to 11.1%), unsolicited injection site AR (2.0% to 7.6%)) and Group 2 
EMA/59102/2024
Page 34/40
(unsolicited AE (35.4% to 28.7%)). It is critically noted that especially in Group 1 an increase was 
observed, however, no specific impact on safety data based on the unblinding issue on Sponsor level 
could be identified. 
The most frequently reported major protocol deviation was “IMP administered but not as per protocol” 
in 48 participants (10.4%). Indeed, 48 participants were wrongly administered with Tdap-IPV and/or 
9vHPV vaccines in the same arm as MenACYW conjugate vaccine. This deviation would especially 
compromise the evaluation of local reactions in patients of Group 3, but only 1 subject in Group 3 (and 
23 and 24 subjects in Groups 1 and 2, respectively) were reported with “IMP administered but not as 
per protocol”. The deviation is not seen overly critical for Groups 1 and 2 with respect to the time 
between vaccinations (i.e., 30 days), which allows for a distinct assessment of the local safety profile. 
A safety overview has been provided with these subjects that were affected by erroneous 
administration excluded. No critical deviation to the full set of safety data was evident.
Primary immunogenicity objective:
In the PPASM, non-inferiority of the seroprotection rate (serum bactericidal assay using human 
complement [hSBA] titer ≥ 1:8) to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y following the 
administration of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) compared to a single dose of 
Nimenrix (Group 2) was demonstrated for MenACYW conjugate vaccine versus Nimenrix. Of note, for 
the primary analysis the immunogenicity of both vaccines thirty days after vaccination when given 
alone in Groups 1 and 2 were compared. Results for Group 3 (with concomitant 9vHPV and Tdap-IPV 
vaccination) are provided below for completeness, although formally not being part of the planned 
primary endpoint analysis. After vaccination, the proportion of participants who achieved hSBA titers ≥ 
1:8 was comparable and high across all groups and serogroups: 97.5%, 92.5%, and 91.2% (Groups 1, 
2, and 3, respectively) in serogroup A, 100%, 95.0%, and 99.1% in serogroup C, 100%, 98.8%, and 
99.1% in serogroup W, and 99.4%, 98.1%, and 100% in serogroup Y. This indicates a sufficient 
protection against infection for all vaccination schemes and both meningococcal vaccines applied in the 
study. Still, the difference between Groups 1 and 2 in seroprotection of serogroups A and B was 
slightly higher (~5.0%) than for serogroups W and Y (~1.2). The primary objective was also 
demonstrated in the hSBA FAS. However, it should be noted that the proportion of participants who 
had hSBA titers ≥ 1:8 at baseline was already high across all Groups, especially in serogroups A and 
C: 56.3%, 50.6%, and 58.9% in serogroup A, 41.1%, 35.6%, and 41.6% in serogroup C, 22.6%, 
28.6%, and 26.8% in serogroup W, and 9.4%, 15.5%, and 6.2% in serogroup Y for study Groups 1, 2 
and 3, respectively. 
Secondary immunogenicity objectives:
In addition to seroprotection rates, the immune responses against meningococcal serogroups A, 
C, W, and Y 30 days after vaccination with meningococcal vaccines administered alone (Group 1, 
hSBA PPASM) were higher to that elicited by Nimenrix (Group 2) and MenQuadfi+TdapIPV+9vHPV 
(Group 3) in terms of geometric mean titers (GMTs) and vaccine seroresponse rates for all 4 
serogroups, except for GMTs against serogroup Y which were comparable in Groups 1 and 3.
GMTs were 78.2, 56.0, and 42.2 measured 30 days after vaccination with MenACWY vaccines 
administered alone for serogroup A (in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively), 2294, 619, and 1938 for 
serogroup C, 134, 64.6, and 74.6 for serogroup W, and 169, 84.8, and 171 for serogroup Y (PPASM). 
High titer levels are noted for serogroup C, most likely based on the high rate of MenC-primed subjects 
in the study, and especially for Groups 1 and 3, which also had the highest rate in MenC-primed 
subjects. Seroresponse (defined as post-vaccination titer ≥1:16 for participants with pre-vaccination 
hSBA titer < 1:8, or a postvaccination titer ≥4-fold increase from baseline for participants with pre-
vaccination hSBA titer ≥1:8) was observed in 88.0%, 75.5%, and 63.4% of subjects after vaccination 
EMA/59102/2024
Page 35/40
for serogroup A, 99.4%, 88.8%, and 97.3% for serogroup C, 93.1%, 81.4%, and 85.7% for serogroup 
W, and 98.7%, 88.1%, and 99.1% for serogroup Y in study Groups 1-3, respectively. 
Reason for the slightly higher response in antibody titers for group 1 and 3 compared to group 2 could 
be related to the higher meningococcal capsular polysaccharide concentrations in MenQuadfi compared 
to Nimenrix (i.e., 10 µg vs. 5 µg per serogroup) as well as the higher concentration of the tetanus 
toxoid protein carrier in MenQuadfi (55 µg vs. 44 µg). 
In MenC-naïve participants, baseline GMTs of serogroup C were 4.59 and 3.15 (in Groups 1 and 2, 
respectively) measured at D01, and increased to 489 and 29.0 at D31. This converts to GMT ratios 
(GMTRs) of 106 and 9.22 for Groups 1 and 2, indicating a higher response to MenQuadfi compared to 
Nimenrix. As can be expected, MenC-primed participants had higher serogroup C baseline GMTs of 
7.30 and 7.06 measured at D01 which increased to 4222 and 2361 at D31 and which converts to much 
higher GMTRs of 597 and 337, respectively. Therefore, the proportion of MenC-primed participants, 
who had MenC hSBA titers ≥1:8 at baseline (i.e., seroprotection), was comparable and already high 
between Groups 1 and 2 (46.9% vs. 45.9). After vaccination (D31), seroprotection for serogroup C in 
MenC-primed participants was 100% in both groups. Contrarily, the proportion of MenC-naive 
participants, who had MenC seroprotection at baseline, was considerably lower in Groups 1 and 2 
(26.7% vs. 12.2%). Nevertheless, seroprotection increased to 100% in Group 1 (MenQuadfi), while it 
increased only to 85.7% in Group 2 (Nimenrix) after vaccination (D31) in MenC-naïve participants. In 
general, the MenC immune response 30 days after vaccination was highest with MenQuadfi (Group 1) 
in MenC-primed participants. Similar results were observed in the hSBA FAS and rSBA PPASM.
The immune responses for meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y with MenACYW conjugate 
vaccine administered alone (Groups 1 and 2) or concomitantly with 9vHPV + Tdap-IPV vaccines 
(Group 3) was measured on D31 (i.e., before 9vHPV and Tdap-IPV vaccinations in Groups 1 and 2, but 
30 days after concomitant vaccination in Group 3). GMTs of MenQuadfi alone (Group 1) are 
considerably higher than MenQuadfi administered concomitantly with childhood vaccinations (Group 3) 
for serogroups A, C and W: GMTs are 78.2, 56.0, and 42.2 (serogroup A in Groups 1, 2, and 3, 
respectively), 2294, 619, and 1938 (serogroup C), 134, 64.6, and 74.6 (serogroup W), and 169, 84.8, 
and 171 (serogroup Y). The calculated 95%CIs are not overlapping for serogroups A and W. Similarly, 
seroresponses were considerably higher in Group 1 vs. Group 3 for serogroups A, C and W: 
Seroresponse rates are 88.0%, 75.5% and 63.4% (serogroup A), 99.4%, 88.8%, and 97.3% 
(serogroup C), 93.1%, 81.4%, and 85.7% (serogroup W), and 98.7%, 88.1%, and 99.1% (serogroup 
Y). The calculated 95%CIs are not overlapping for serogroup A. It is concluded that the immune 
response induced by MenQuadfi was higher or comparable when MenACYW conjugate vaccine was 
administered alone versus concomitantly with 9vHPV+Tdap-IPV vaccines. Based on these data, the 
concomitant vaccination during adolescence (administered together with the tested vaccines) appears 
principally acceptable, since seroprotection rates 30 days after vaccination were high also for Group 3 
(91.2%, 99.1%, 99.1% and 100% of subjects in Group 3 compared to 97.5%, 100%, 100% and 
99.4%  in Group 1 for serogroups A, C, W and Y, respectively), but not favourable compared to the 
sequential administration, with respect to the expected antibody response for serogroups A, C and W. 
Thus, the information on lower titer response after coadministration should be reported in the PI once 
a coadministration of MenQuadfi and 9vHPV+Tdap-IPV is intended to be included.
The post-dose 9vHPV antibody responses based on pre-dose are roughly comparable between 
groups, although there is a clear trend for a lower response to presented HPV antigens when 
MenQuadfi is concomitantly administered with Tdap-IPV (i.e., response with MenQuadfi+9vHPV 
sequential (Group 1) > Nimenrix+9vHPV sequential (Group 2) > MenQuadfi+9vHPV concomitantly 
(Group 3)). As mentioned by the Applicant, no conclusions about clinical relevance of absolute post-
dose GMs can be drawn since the participants were given only the first dose of what is ultimately a 2 
or 3-dose vaccination regimen. Of note, also the detection method used for HPV testing has changed 
EMA/59102/2024
Page 36/40
from the one described in the protocol (Fluorescent Luminex multiplex instead of Sulfotag multiplex 
MSD) due to unavailability of the technique at the CRO. According to the Applicant, this change does 
not modify the assay principle (HPV IgG LIA assay) and the measurement technique for HPV Ab titer. 
Cut-off values used for serostatus definition were adapted to the technique used. However, no definite 
conclusions on HPV immunity can be derived due to the incomplete vaccination scheme and 
uncertainty regarding the switch of the utilized assay.
All geometric means of Tdap-IPV antibody titers or antibody concentrations were higher post-
dose, except for the Anti-Tetanus component in the Tdap-IPV vaccine when sequentially administering 
a MenACWY vaccine with the Tdap-IPV vaccine (Groups 1 and 2). Indeed, the GMT concentration of 
Anti-Tetanus antibodies decreased (rather than increased) from 25.5 and 18.4 IU/mL at baseline to 
17.3 and 16.1 IU/mL in groups 1 and 2 after vaccination, respectively. Contrarily, antibody 
concentrations increased in Groups 3 from 0.7 to 48.7 IU/mL (as intended). Of note, the GMT was 
substantially lower in Group 3 before Tdap-IPV vaccination than in Groups 1 and 2 (pre-dose GMTs of 
25.5, 18.4 and 0.708 were reported for Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively). According to the Applicant, 
this was expected as 30 days before Tdap-IPV vaccination participants in Group 1 and Group 2 
received MenQuadfi or Nimenrix, which are both tetanus toxoid-conjugated-vaccines. It can be 
followed that a prior vaccination with a tetanus toxoid-conjugated vaccine (e.g., MenQuadfi or 
Nimenrix) can increase antibody titer levels in subjects. However, it is not clear why titer levels 
decrease after vaccination with Tdap-IPV, as evident from Groups 1 and 2. This effect should be 
thoroughly discussed once a coadministration of MenQuadfi and Tdap-IPV is intended to be included in 
the PI. Importantly, almost all patients across all groups had titer levels ≥1 IU/mL after vaccination 
with Tdap-IPV (only 1/149 subjects in group 1 had levels below 1, but still ≥0.1 IU/mL), which 
underlines the existing protection against tetanus infection. The post-dose responses of Tdap-IPV 
(other than Anti-Tetanus antibodies) based on pre-dose levels are principally comparable between 
groups, although there is a trend for lower Tdap-IPV responses when MenQuadfi is concomitantly 
administered with Tdap-IPV (MenQuadfi+TdapIPV sequential (Group 1) > Nimenrix+TdapIPV 
sequential (Group 2) > MenQuadfi+TdapIPV concomitantly (Group 3)). Especially Anti-Polio type 1 and 
type 3 GMT ratios (post-dose based on pre-dose) in group 3 were 2-3-fold lower compared to Groups 1 
and 2, which have followed the sequential administration of vaccines. A similar, but less pronounced, 
trend was also observed for Anti-Diphteria titer level ratios (with lower levels in group 3 and non-
overlapping 95%CIs in GMT ratios with Groups 1 and 2). Importantly, all subjects had protective Anti-
Polio-titer levels (i.e., ≥1:8) for all three types and the majority of subjects (>90%) also had 
protective anti-Diphteria titer levels (i.e., ≥1 IU/mL). Seroresponse of Anti-PT, Anti-FHA and Anti-PRN 
titers appear mildly lower in group 3 compared to groups 1 and 2, but 95%CIs are overlapping. 
Thus, post-dose response of GMs of antibody concentration/titers against antigens contained in the 
Tdap-IPV vaccine are still considered clinically relevant if administered concomitantly with MenQuadfi 
(Group 3). Still, a lower response in antibody titers should be anticipated for Anti-Polio-type 1 and type 
3, as well as anti-Diphtheria when 9vHPV and Tdap-IPV are administered concomitantly with 
MenQuadfi (compared to a sequential administration). Furthermore, the decrease in anti-tetanus 
antibodies upon vaccination with Tdap-IPV should be discussed by the Applicant when submitting the 
planned Type II Variation in Q1 2024.
Long-term antibody persistence data were not generated in the study.
Safety
Throughout the study >97% of subjects were exposed to the intended vaccines at planned visits. The 
Overall SafAS is considered the most informative analysis set for the comparison of local reactions, as 
events can be related to the exact vaccine that was received. However, systemic events are more 
EMA/59102/2024
Page 37/40
suitable to be assessed in the SafAS1 and SafAS2 as events can be related at least to the visit with 
distinct vaccination schedule. 
There were no AEs that caused participants to discontinue from the study and no SAEs within 30 
days of vaccination in any group. There was 1 SAE reported throughout the study for 1 participant 
(0.6%) in Group 2. The participant experienced type 1 diabetes mellitus, which was classified as not 
vaccine-related, which can be followed. There were no AESIs and no deaths throughout the study.
Solicited reactions
No immediate unsolicited AEs were reported within 30 minutes of vaccination in any group. The 
solicited reactions within the solicited period after any vaccine injections (Overall SafAS) were 
frequent (90.5, 88.8, and 95.7% for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and tended to be more frequent 
in Group 3 (concomitant administration of MenQuadfi + 9vHPV + Tdap-IPV). The general trend of a 
higher rate in subjects with events in group 3 is also reflected in reported frequencies for Grade 3 
solicited reactions (18.9, 15.3, and 25.9%). Similarly, solicited reactions within 7 days after vaccine 
injection at Visit 1 (SafSA1) are comparable between Groups 1 and 2, while nearly every participant in 
Group 3 had a solicited reaction (68.6, 65.3, and 95.7% in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and a 
high proportion of subjects had grade 3 solicited reactions in that group (8.3, 8.2, and 25.9% in 
Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The rate of subjects with solicited reactions after vaccine injection at 
Visit 2 (SafSA2) was comparable between groups (79.2 and 82.4% with event as well as 11.9 and 
11.5% with grade 3 event in groups 1 and 2, respectively).
Especially solicited injection site reactions were frequent after any vaccination (Overall SafAS; 
88.2, 82.9, and 93.1%) and events were mostly related to the 9vHPV and/or Tdap-IPV vaccines (with 
around 10-20% more subjects reporting specific injection site after the routine paediatric vaccines 
compared to MenQuadfi and Nimenrix, see following). The most frequently reported solicited injection 
site reaction within 7 days following any vaccination was pain in all 3 groups, again, more frequently 
related to the 9vHPV (67.3, 75.8, and 83.6%) and Tdap-IPV (69.0, 71.3, and 81.9) vaccines than 
MenQuadfi (53.8% in Group 1 and 59.5% in Group 3) or Nimenrix (51.2% in Group 2). Similarly, 
grade 3 injection site pain was higher with 9vHPV (7.7, 9.7, and 12.9%) and Tdap-IPV (7.7, 7.9, and 
12.1%) than with MenQuadfi (2.4% in Group 1 and 1.7% in Group 3) or Nimenrix (2.4% in Group 2), 
and was especially frequent in participants of Group 3 who had received 9vHPV and Tdap-IPV 
concomitantly with MenQuadfi. In general, a total of 62 participants reported at least 1 Grade 3 
solicited injection site reaction within 7 days of vaccination (14.2, 11.2, and 16.4%). Notably, the rates 
of subjects that reported injection site erythema (11.2, 1.8, and 9.5%) and swelling (10.1, 4.1, and 
10.3%) were considerably lower in Group 2 with Nimenrix. Similarly, solicited injection site reactions 
reported for the SafAS1 are comparable between Groups 1 and 2, while most participants in Group 3 
had a solicited injection site reaction (57.4, 52.9, and 93.1% in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The 
higher rate of solicited injection site reaction in subjects of Groups 1 and 2 (who received 
9vHPV+Tdap-IPV 30 days after the MenACWY vaccines) is also reflected in SafAS2 (76.8% and 80% in 
Groups 1 and 2, respectively).
The most frequently reported solicited systemic reactions within 7 days of any vaccination (Overall 
SafAS) were myalgia (49.7, 47.6, and 57.8%), headache (44.4, 37.6, and 44.8%), and malaise (38.5, 
28.2, and 36.2%). No distinction between vaccines, that were provided at the same visit, is possible 
for systemic reactions, but considering also the SafAS1 (50.9, 45.9 and 71.6% of subjects with 
systemic reactions in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and the SafAS2 (48.2 and 50.9% in Groups 1 
and 2, respectively) it can be concluded that around 20% more subjects experienced a solicited 
systemic event after coadministration of MenQuadfi with 9vHPV+Tdap-IPV compared to MenQuadfi, 
Nimenrix or 9vHPV+Tdap-IPV alone. Solicited systemic reactions after vaccine injection at Visit 1 
(SafSA1) were mostly headache (35.1, 25.9 and 44.8% of subjects with event in groups 1-3, 
EMA/59102/2024
Page 38/40
respectively), malaise (27.2, 18.8 and 36.2% of subjects with event in groups 1-3, respectively) and 
myalgia (30.2, 31.2 and 57.8% of subjects with event in groups 1-3, respectively) with substantial 
differences across groups and highest rates in Group 3. The difference between Group 1 and 2 is 
mostly related to grade 1 and 2 events, but not evident for grade 3 events. However, Group 3 also had 
a higher rate of grade 3 events compared to both other groups.
In general, the trend of more subjects with local and systemic reactions in Group 3 is somewhat 
expected, as reactions of either vaccine have to be anticipated at the same visit. Tdap-IPV and 9vHPV 
appear more reactogenic compared to both meningococcal vaccines. Furthermore, it is concluded that 
MenQuadfi appears more reactogenic compared to Nimenrix, with a higher rate of subjects reporting 
solicited events, especially injection site erythema and swelling as well as headache and malaise.
Unsolicited AEs
Unsolicited AE within 30 days after any vaccine injections (overall SafAS) were comparable between 
groups, albeit slightly higher in Group 1 (40.4, 28.7, and 31.9% for Groups 1, 2, and 3). However, the 
SafAS1 and SafAS2 allow for a better relation of events to the vaccinations of a specific visit. 
Unsolicited AEs in the SafAS1 and SafAS2 indicate a mildly higher rate of events that were related to 
Menquadfi (28.7% of subjects reported an event in Group1 after visit 1) compared to Nimernrix 
(18.1% of subjects reported an event in Group 2 after visit 1) or 9vHPV+Tdap-IPV (20.1% and 16.1% 
of subjects reported an event in Group 1 and 2 after visit 2, respectively). However, the highest rate 
was observed after visit 1 in subjects that have received the coadministration of Menquadfi with 
9vHPV+Tdap-IPV (31.9%), which appears expectable as reactions of either vaccine have to be 
anticipated at the same visit and in line with systemic solicited reactions reported above. Furthermore, 
more subjects appear to be affected by unsolicited events after vaccination with Menquadfi compared 
to Nimenrix (refer to Groups 1 and 2 after visit 1). Unsolicited AEs within 30 days of vaccination after 
visit 1 (SafAS1) were mainly reported (i.e. in ≥5% of subjects) in the following SOCs: “Infections and 
infestations” (11.7%) and “General disorders and administration site conditions” (9.4%) in Group 1; 
“Infections and infestations” (7%) in Group 2; and “Infections and infestations” (12.1%), “General 
disorders and administration site conditions” (9.5%), and “Gastrointestinal disorders” (7.8%) in Group 
3. After visit 2 (SafAS2) only the SOC “Infections and infestations” was reported by ≥5% of subjects 
(12.4% and 5.4% in groups 1 and 2, respectively). Most unsolicited AEs started during the time period 
D1-D4 and resolved within 7 days in all Groups . At least 1 Grade 3 unsolicited AE was reported in 
1.6% of participants in Group 1, 0.6% of participants in Group 2, and 2.6% of participants in Group 3 
after visit 1 (SafAS1). 
Unsolicited AR were concluded in 8.8% of participants in Group 1, 3.5% of participants in Group 2, and 
10.3% of participants in Group 3 after the first visit (SafAS1). Unsolicited ARs after the second visit 
were reported by 4.1% and 4.8% in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, it appears that the highest 
rate of AR has to be anticipated for MenQuadfi. However, systemic ARs were not very frequent after 
visit 1 (2.3, 1.2 and 1.7% in Groups 1-3, respectively) or visit 2 (1.8 and 0.6% in Groups 1 and 2, 
respectively). The main unsolicited injection site ARs reported after vaccination at visit 1 and 2 were in 
the SOC “General disorders and administration site conditions” with a comparable pattern of PTs for all 
groups, but with the highest rate in Group 3 and lowest rate in Group 2 after the first visit (6.4, 2.3 
and 9.5% in Groups 1-3 after visit 1 as well as 4.1% and 4.8% for Groups 1 and 2 after visit 2, 
respectively). All unsolicited systemic ARs within 30 days of vaccination after visit 1 or 2 were single PT 
events within groups.  No participants reported any Grade 3 unsolicited systemic ARs within 30 days of 
vaccination in any group.
It is concluded that a higher rate of subjects might be affected by unsolicited AEs after vaccination with 
MenQuadfi compared to Nimenrix, and that the rate of subjects affected might be even increased when 
MenQuadfi is given at the same visit with 9vHPV+Tdap-IPV. Still, the overall reactogenicity and safety

profiles appear manageable and comparable between MenACYW conjugate vaccine administered 
sequentially (Group 1) or concomitantly with 9vHPV+Tdap-IPV vaccines (Group 3) and Nimenrix 
administered sequentially with 9vHPV + Tdap-IPV vaccines (Group 2).
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation
On 06 October 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study MEQ00071. The study was 
completed on 11 May 2022. 
Antibody titers 30 days after vaccination with MenQuadfi were sufficiently high to assume protection 
and were slightly higher compared to the vaccination with Nimenrix. In terms of antibody response, 
the sequential administration of MenQuadfi before 9vHPV+Tdap-IPV appears to be favourable over the 
concomitant administration. However, protection rates were high for either setup. It is noted that 
tetanus titer levels decrease after vaccination with Tdap-IPV in subjects that were vaccinated with 
MenQuadfi (and Nimenrix) 30 days before. This effect should be thoroughly discussed once a 
coadministration of MenQuadfi and Tdap-IPV is intended to be included in the PI. Furthermore, a lower 
response in antibody titers should be anticipated for Anti-Polio-type 1 and type 3, as well as anti-
Diphtheria when 9vHPV and Tdap-IPV are administered concomitantly with MenQuadfi (compared to a 
sequential administration).
Tdap-IPV and 9vHPV appear more reactogenic compared to both meningococcal vaccines, but 
MenQuadfi appears more reactogenic compared to Nimenrix, with a higher rate of subjects reporting 
solicited events, especially injection site erythema and swelling as well as headache and malaise. 
Unsolicited AEs should be anticipated for a higher proportion in subjects after vaccination with 
MenQuadfi compared to Nimenrix, and that rate might be even increased when MenQuadfi is given at 
the same visit with 9vHPV+Tdap-IPV. It is reassuring that no AEs leading to discontinuation from the 
study and no SAEs within 30 days of vaccination were observed in the study. One SAE of type 1 
diabetes mellitus (that occurred >30 days after vaccination) is not considered vaccine-related. Also, no 
AESIs and no deaths were reported throughout the study.
No concerns derive from data reported from study MEQ00071 regarding the current B/R for MenQuadfi 
and therefore, the PAM is considered fulfilled.
  Fulfilled:
No regulatory action required.

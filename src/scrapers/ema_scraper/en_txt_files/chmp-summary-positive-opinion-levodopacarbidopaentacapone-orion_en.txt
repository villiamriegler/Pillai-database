Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion 
levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone 
On 23 June 2011 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion, 50/12.5/200 mg, 75/18.75/200 mg, 100/25/200 mg, 
125/31.25/200 mg, 150/37.5/200 mg and 200/50/200 mg film-coated tablets intended for the 
treatment of Parkinson's disease. The applicant for this medicinal product is Orion Corporation. They 
may request a re-examination of any CHMP opinion, provided they notify the European Medicines 
Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The active substances of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion are a fixed combination of levodopa, 
carbidopa and entacapone, ATC Code N04BA03. Levodopa is a dopaminergic agent that mediates the 
antiparkinsonian effect by converting to dopamine in the brain through decarboxylation. Carbidopa, a 
dopa decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor, and entacapone, a catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) 
inhibitor, both modify the therapeutic properties of levodopa by modifying the peripheral metabolism of 
levodopa, in order to improve its availability to the brain, but have no therapeutic activity without 
levodopa.   
The benefits with Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion as a fixed combination product would be, 
primarily, a simplification of therapy of patients with a fluctuating Parkinson’s disease. The reduction of 
the number of tablets to be swallowed is clinically relevant in advanced Parkinson’s disease patients, 
who may have difficulties in swallowing and who often have to take multiple drugs. The most common 
side effects are dyskinesia, gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea and diarrhoea, and muscle, 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue pain.    
The approved indication is: “Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations not stabilised on 
levodopa/dopa decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor treatment”.

67 days from adoption of the opinion.

Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR), and 
will be available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission. 
The CHMP, on the basis of quality, safety and efficacy data submitted, considers there to be a 
favourable benefit to risk balance for Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion and therefore 
recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation.

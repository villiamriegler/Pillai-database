Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan     
 
 
Summary of risk management plan for Ketoconazole HRA 
200 mg tablets (ketoconazole) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Ketoconazole HRA 200 mg tablets. The RMP 
details important risks of Ketoconazole HRA 200 mg tablets, how these risks can be minimised, and how 
more  information  will  be  obtained  about  Ketoconazole  HRA's  risks  and  uncertainties  (missing 
information). 
Ketoconazole HRA's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Ketoconazole HRA should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Ketoconazole HRA 200 mg tablets should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of  Ketoconazole 
HRA's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Ketoconazole HRA 200 mg tablets is authorised for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome in 
adults  and  adolescents  above  the  age  of  12  years  (see  SmPC  for  the  full  indication).  It  contains 
ketoconazole as the active substance and it is given by oral route, 200 mg tablet. 
Further information about the evaluation of Ketoconazole HRA’s benefits can be found in Ketoconazole 
HRA 200 mg tablets’ EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under 
the medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/ketoconazole-hra. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise 
or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Ketoconazole HRA, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Ketoconazole HRA's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
 
 
 
In the case of Ketoconazole HRA, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Ketoconazole HRA is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Ketoconazole HRA are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks can 
be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of 
a link with the use of Ketoconazole HRA. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the 
use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established 
yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Important identified risk  
Hepatotoxicity 
Evidence for linking the 
SmPC, medical and scientific literature for Ketoconazole use in the 
risk to the medicine 
treatment of Cushing’s Syndrome and as an antifungal therapy and 
one unpublished study in patients with Cushing’s Syndrome (NIH 
study). 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk factors for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) include medication 
dose,  drug  lipophilicity,  and  extent  of  hepatic  metabolism. 
Susceptibility to DILI is thought to be influenced also by concomitant 
hepatotoxic  treatments  such  as  paracetamol  and  polymedications, 
environmental  exposures  and  toxins,  underlying  disease  states  or 
genetic predisposition. There is mixed evidence to support the role 
of  host  factors  such  as  age,  sex,  and  chronic  liver  disease  in  the 
development of DILI. A common belief held that the elderly, women 
and  alcohol  abusers  are  at  higher  overall  risk  of  developing  drug-
induced hepatotoxic effects (Bell, 2009). However, a concise review 
of  different  causality  instruments  did  not  find  any  solid  evidence 
supporting this opinion (Shapiro, 2007; Leise, 2014).  
In  the  literature,  among  24  paediatric  patients  with  Cushing’s 
syndrome  treated  with  ketoconazole,  02  developed  serious 
hepatotoxicity. Therefore in adolescents, frequency of hepatotoxicity 
could be higher than in adults.    
Recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 204 eligible studies 
in uses other than Cushing’s syndrome concluded that the incidence 
of  ketoconazole  associated  hepatotoxicity  was  3.6%-4.2%.  The 
dosage  and  duration  specific  subgroup  analyses  did  not  show  any 
significant difference among groups, while the age specific subgroup 
analysis showed the incidence in children and people aged >60 years 
was 1.4% (95% CI: 0.5%-4.2%) and 3.2% (95% CI: 1.1%-8.7%) 
respectively.  Additionally,  the  incidence  of  the  hepatotoxicity  was 
higher in people who had oral administration of ketoconazole beyond 
the provisions of the usage instructions, and the incidence was 5.7% 
(95% CI: 4.5%-7.2%) (Yan, 2013). However, this review has some 
limitations due to the quality of the different publications and their 
heterogeneity.  In  most  studies,  the  safety  monitoring  and  the 
frequency of liver function monitoring were not well described, the 
criteria for hepatic event was not clearly defined, and only results of 
alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  were  reported.  Therefore  it  is 
unknown  whether  some  events  were  not  captured  in  the  studies 
reviewed  due  to  lack  of  close  follow-up,  and  the  authors  did  not 
provide an incidence analysis based on the most reliable papers. The 
analysis  of  the  dose  dependency  of  the  effect  could  have  been 
impaired  by  the  limited  number  of  studies  in  which  patients  were 
treated with ketoconazole doses above 400 mg/day. Finally, in most 
of  the  studies  analysed,  ketoconazole  was  used  as  an  antifungal 
agent, and the population was probably different from the population 
suffering  from  Cushing’s  syndrome  in  terms  of  comorbidities  and 
may also be different in terms of frequency of follow-up visits and 
liver enzymes monitoring.  
In patients with active Cushing’s syndrome, the presence of hepatic 
steatosis is signiﬁcantly correlated with total abdominal fat area and 
visceral fat area (Rockall, 2003). However, the opinion on the impact 
of  obesity  and  NAFLD  on  the  development  of  DILI  is  biased  and 
literature sources do not firmly confirm that individuals with obesity 
and NAFLD are systematically at increased risk for developing DILI 
(Andrade,  2005;  Chalasani,  2008).  The  risk  of  concomitant 
hepatotoxic  treatment  and  poly-medications  within  the  group  of 
Cushing’s  syndrome  patients  is  adequately  manageable  and 
preventable as the administration of ketoconazole will be under the 
management  and  supervision  of  physicians  experienced 
in 
endocrinology  or  in  internal  medicine.  The  risk  of  development  of 
serious  hepatic  disease  can  be  reduced  to  minimum  by  controlling 
liver function and liver enzymes before starting ketoconazole and by 
avoiding concomitant use with hepatotoxic drugs or alcohol. 
Lo Re V et al. (2015) described the risk of acute liver injury of oral 
azole antifungal medications based on epidemiological data from a 
large  US  database  (patients  ≥  18  years  old).  In  this  population-
based  analysis, 
the  risks  of  both 
transaminases 
increase 
(approximately  above  5  ULN)  and  severe  acute  liver  injury  were 
similar among fluconazole, ketoconazole and itraconazole users. Pre-
existing  liver  disease  was  identified  as  a  strong  risk  factor  for 
development of acute liver injury but it was not possible to determine 
if the acute liver injury was caused by the azole drug or due to the 
natural  history  of  the  underlying  disease.  Hepatotoxicity  occurred 
mostly within the 1st month after treatment initiation, which is in line 
with  the  previous  literature  findings.  The  results  from  this 
retrospective  cohort  study  were  consistent  with  the  Ketoconazole 
HRA SmPC recommendations for dosing and for liver function tests 
monitoring before and during therapy.

Adrenal insufficiency 
Evidence for linking the 
SmPC, medical and scientific literature and one unpublished study 
risk to the medicine 
in patients with Cushing’s syndrome (the NIH study). 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Higher risk of adrenal insufficiency (AI) is linked to the whole group 
of  drugs  interfering  with  glucocorticoids  synthesis  or  action,  e.g., 
antifungal agents, including ketoconazole (Bornstein, 2009) and also 
other  drugs  used  for  Cushing’s  syndrome  treatment  (metyrapone, 
pasireotide and mifepristone).  
Acute  AI  usually  occurs  under  conditions  of  a  relative  cortisol 
deficiency due to an increased glucocorticoid demand (e.g. in case 
of stress, surgery, or infection) and/or an insufficient glucocorticoid 
replacement  (for  the  patients  treated  with  a  block-and-replace 
regimen), or in case of ketoconazole overtreatment (for the patients 
treated  with  a  block  only  regimen).  Main  precipitating  factors  of 
adrenal  crisis  in  patients  at  risk  of  AI  or  with  a  known  AI  are 
gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases. 
Combination of several steroidogenesis inhibitors may also result in 
AI.  Acute  AI  was  observed  in  4/11  patients  treated  with  a 
combination  of  ketoconazole,  metyrapone  and  mitotane  and 
attributed  to  inappropriate  glucocorticoid  substitution  (Kamenicky, 
2011).

QT/QTc interval prolongation/Torsade de Pointes due to interaction of ketoconazole 
with CYP3A4 substrates 
Evidence for linking the 
SmPC, medical and scientific literature 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
The risk of QTc prolongation is increased in  females, patients with 
organic heart disease (for example congenital long QTc syndrome, 
myocardial 
infarction, 
congestive 
heart 
failure, 
dilated 
cardiomyopathy,  hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy,  bradycardia), 
hypokalaemia and hepatic impairment (Yap, 2003). 
Concomitant  administration  of  ketoconazole  with  certain  medicinal 
products  can  increase  the  risk  of  QT  prolongation.  The  risk  of  QT 
prolongation  resulting  from  DDI  involving  ketoconazole  is  well-
recognized and is therefore specifically addressed in the SmPC and 
PL. These effects have been observed for CYP3A4 substrates and is 
discussed  within  the  Important  identified  risk  of  QT/QTc  interval 
prolongation/  Torsade  de  Pointes  (TdP)  due  to  interaction  of 
ketoconazole with CYP3A4 substrates (Dresser, 2000). Moreover, it 
is not recommended to use ketoconazole with pasireotide in patients 
with  known  problems  of  heart.  Ketoconazole  should  not  be  co-
administered with domperidone either.  
The  results  of  a  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind, 
double-dummy and crossover study in healthy volunteers indicated 
that  domperidone  and  ketoconazole,  alone  and  in  combination, 
increased  QTc  significantly  in  men,  and  there  was  a  positive 
correlation  between 
increased  QTc  and  concentrations  of 
domperidone and ketoconazole in both sexes. Even though the effect 
of domperidone alone on QTc was small and not clinically important, 
concomitant use is not recommended (Boyce, 2012).

QT/QTc interval prolongation/Torsade de Pointes 
Evidence for linking the 
SmPC, medical and scientific literature 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
The  strongest  risk  factors  for  QT  prolongation  are  persistently 
elevated  blood  pressure  and  left  ventricular  hypertrophy.  Other 
recognized  predictive  factors  are  age,  body  mass,  and  in  some 
studies the female gender. Women may be at higher risk probably 
due to a specific regulation of ionic channel expression (potassium, 
calcium,  etc.)  by  sex  steroids  (oestrogens  facilitate  bradycardia-
induced  QT  prolongation  and  the  emergence  of  arrhythmia  while 
androgens do the opposite), even though non-genomic effects may 
play a role as well (Drici, 2001). Male hypogonadism could also play 
a role in prolonging QTc interval (De Martin, 2015). In obesity, the 
risk  increases  due  to  electrolyte  disturbances,  left  ventricular 
hypertrophy or drug effects (Frank, 1986; Pontiroli, 2004). 
Despite of the fact that prolonged QT interval has been observed in 
pre-clinical phase, the evidence of its clinical relevance is limited and 
additionally, clinical cases are very rare. One case of a woman with 
a  history  of  coronary  artery  disease  who  developed  a  markedly 
prolonged  QT  interval  and  TdP  after  taking  ketoconazole  for 
treatment  of  fungal  infection  without  concomitant  use  of  other  QT 
interval-prolonging drugs has been reported (Mok, 2005). This case 
indicated that even in the absence of other QT interval-prolonging 
drugs,  precautions  should  be  taken  in  ketoconazole  treatment  to 
avoid  TdP,  particularly  for  patients  who  have  hepatic  dysfunction 
(and thus impaired metabolism of ketoconazole), who concomitantly 
require  CYP3A  inhibitor  and  those  who  have  risk  factors  for 
developing TdP. As per the SmPC, ketoconazole is contraindicated in 
patients with congenital or documented acquired QTc prolongation.    
Ruiz-Garcia  et  al.  (2015),  despite  some  study  limitations,  showed 
that the administration of 400 mg of ketoconazole has no significant 
effect  on  QT  interval  at  steady-state.  Moreover,  in  a  retrospective 
study,  De  Martin  et  al.  (2015)  described  the  absence  of  untoward 
effect 
of 
long-term 
ketoconazole 
administration 
on 
electrocardiographic QTc interval in patients with Cushing’s disease.   
 
Systemic  complications  resembling  metabolic  syndrome  present  in 
patients with Cushing’s syndrome, increase the risk of cardiovascular 
complications  (Arnaldi,  2003;  Muiesan,  2003;  Pivonello,  2005; 
Arnaldi, 2012). 
In diabetic patients, frequent among the Cushing’s syndrome 
patients, factors potentially contributing to QT interval prolongation 
include insulin sensitivity and prevalent coronary artery disease 
(Festa, 2000).

II.C Post-authorisation development plan 
II.C.1 Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation 
The following study is condition of the marketing authorisation: 
Ketoconazole  PASS  (EUPAS21731):  Prospective,  multi-country,  observational  registry  to  collect 
clinical information on patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome exposed  to Ketoconazole (using 
the existing European Registry on Cushing’s Syndrome (ERCUSYN)), to assess drug utilization pattern 
and to document the safety (e.g. hepatotoxicity, QT prolongation) and effectiveness of Ketoconazole. 
 
 
 
Purpose of the study:  
The safety profile of Ketoconazole HRA is documented and is acceptable in the context of the treatment 
of  endogenous  Cushing’s  syndrome,  yielding  to  a  positive  benefit  to  risk  assessment  by  the  CHMP  in 
September 2014. 
Nevertheless, a mandatory pharmacovigilance activity has been imposed by EMA with respect to some 
safety  concerns  listed  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  and  which  are  key  to  the  risk-benefit 
assessment of Ketoconazole HRA: 
• 
The most significant safety issue during treatment with ketoconazole is hepatotoxicity, primarily 
of  the  hepatocellular  type.  Fatal  cases  have  been  reported  particularly  when  treatment  is 
continued  despite  liver  enzymes  elevation.  Due  to  this  concern,  the  CHMP  recommended 
following an article 31 referral that the marketing authorizations of oral ketoconazole-containing 
medicines  should  be  suspended  throughout  the  European  Union  (EU)  (26  July  2013, 
EMA/458028/2013).  Following  Ketoconazole  HRA  approval  for  the  treatment  of  endogenous 
Cushing’s  syndrome,  hepatotoxicity  remains  a  concern  that  needs  to  be  followed  up  post 
approval and the CHMP requested HRA Pharma to collect post approval data through a registry 
and annually submit results for review. The risk is considered manageable when the Summary 
of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  recommendations  are  followed  and  contraindications  are 
respected; concurrent use of other potential hepatotoxic drugs is avoided and with an adequate 
monitoring of liver function tests prior, during treatment and regularly in case of increase of dose. 
The possibility of a higher rate of hepatotoxicity in adolescents is an additional safety issue that 
deserves to be mentioned. Strict criteria for stopping the treatment in case of increase in liver 
enzymes ≥ 3 fold the ULN are also clearly indicated to the prescriber and the patient. 
• 
The risk of QT/QTc prolongation/ torsades de pointes with ketoconazole is low and has mainly 
been  shown  with  concomitant  use  of  QT  interval  prolonging  drugs  which  should  therefore  be 
avoided  as  indicated  in  the  SmPC.  ECG  monitoring  before  and  on  Ketoconazole  HRA  is 
recommended in all patients to check for QT/QTc interval. 
As part of this Post-Authorisation Measure (PAM) (EMEA/H/C/003906/ANX002), as committed, the MAH 
submitted the results of the ERCUSYN feasibility evaluation on 19 February 2015. Following the receipt 
of the positive updated assessment’s report in September 2015, the HRA Pharma submitted the PASS 
protocol version 3.0 in December 2015. The final study protocol for this observational PASS has been 
approved by PRAC on 01 September 2017 (endorsing version 8.0 of the protocol). 
The primary objective is to collect clinical information on patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome 
exposed to Ketoconazole HRA and assess Ketoconazole HRA safety with a particular focus on the safety 
concerns  of  hepatotoxicity  and  QT  prolongation  with  Ketoconazole  HRA  only  and  in  interaction  with 
CYP3A4 substrates. 
The secondary objectives are to collect and assess other safety data, to evaluate the effectiveness and 
drug utilization patterns of Ketoconazole HRA. 
II.C.2 Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
There are no studies required for Ketoconazole HRA 200 mg Tablets.

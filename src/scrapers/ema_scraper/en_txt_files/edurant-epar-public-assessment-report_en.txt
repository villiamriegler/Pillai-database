1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  Janssen-Cilag  International  N.V.  submitted  on  2  September  2010  an  application  for 
Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Edurant, through the centralised 
procedure  falling  within  the  Article  3(1)  and  point  3  of  Annex  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 21 December 2009.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: Rilpivirine, in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products, is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 
infection in antiretroviral treatment-naïve adult patients.   
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/43/2010 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

Applicant’s request for consideration 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance rilpivirine (hydrochloride) contained in the above 
medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance in itself. 
Scientific Advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 19 July 2007, 24 April 2008 and 22 October 
2009. The Scientific Advice pertained to quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier.

In the first Scientific Advice (EMEA/H/SA/919/1/2007/III) the CHMP remarked that a non-inferiority 
margin of 10% is regarded as more appropriate in studies in antiretroviral naïve patients, despite this 
remark the company chose for a non-inferiority margin of 12%. However, as the results of the pivotal 
phase III studies also demonstrate non-inferiority within the 10% margin this considered acceptable.  
Furthermore based upon non-clinical safety signals the CHMP considered that the effect on cortisol as 
well as on coagulation parameters should be assessed in the phase III studies. This was done for 
cortisol however not for coagulation parameters.  
The second Scientific Advice (EMEA/H/SA/919/1/FU/1/2008/II) concerned a new dose selection. In this 
advice in view of preclinical data obtained so far and the results of the TQT-study conduct of an 
electrophysiology study (APD-study) in accordance with ICH S 7 B was highly recommended. Such a 
specific APD-study has not been performed but as the safety pharmacology has been extensively 
studied in other ways this is considered acceptable.  
In the third Scientific Advice (EMEA/H/SA/919/1/FU/2/2009/III it was remarked that it should be 
ensured that all failing patients in phase III studies were followed with regard to development of 
resistance.  This has thoroughly been done in the phase II and III studies. Concerning the QTc study 
C152 the requests of CHMP with regard to presentation of results were partly fulfilled. 
In addition based upon the clinical and non-clinical data the CHMP concluded that rilpivirine may have 
a proarrhytmic effect. The request for special attention for potential effects on QTc was addressed by 
the applicant. 
Licensing status 
The product was not licensed in any country at the time of submission of the application.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the resulting Acquired Immunodeficiency 
Syndrome (AIDS) are having a significant human and socio-economic impact.  
Introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to a dramatic reduction in mortality 
and morbidity in treated HIV-infected individuals. Further improvements in therapy and outcome have 
been challenged by limitations of the commercially available antiretroviral (ARV) agents, including 
safety and tolerability, dosing complexity, and the emergence of viral resistance resulting in reduced 
ARV activity. 
Current treatment guidelines recommend a combination of 2 nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor (N(t)RTIs) plus a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease 
inhibitor (PI) for first line therapy in HIV infected individuals. Improved tolerability, safety, and simple 
dosing regimens are important drivers of good adherence and hence lessen risk of development of 
drug resistance and should, therefore, be considered as major elements in the development of new 
potent ARV compounds, especially for the ARV treatment-naïve population. 
NNRTIs play an important role and are widely used in the treatment of HIV infection, most commonly 
in first line therapy. The currently approved NNRTIs in the United States of America (USA) and/or 
Europe for use in treatment-naïve adult patients are nevirapine (NVP), delavirdine [DLV) and efavirenz 
(EFV). These NNRTIs can be associated with safety/tolerability problems (mainly hepatotoxicity, central 
nervous system symptoms, and/or rash). Currently one novel NNRTI, etravirine (ETR), is approved for 
use in HIV-1 infected, treatment-experienced adult patients, including those with NNRTI resistance. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Rilpivirine (TMC278; formerly known as R278474) is a di-amino pyrimidine derivative. It is a novel 
NNRTI with in vitro activity against wild-type HIV-1 and NNRTI-resistant mutants. It has been 
developed for treatment of ARV naïve HIV-1 infected individuals with the aim to have a better 
safety/tolerability profile compared to other NNRTIs ( such as nevirapine and efavirenz  and etravrine). 
Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic profile allows a once daily (q.d.) dosing. 
There are currently no data available from clinical studies with RPV in treatment-experienced or in 
heavily pretreated patients.

The applicant applied for the following indication: Rilpivirine, in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products, is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 
infection in antiretroviral treatment-naïve adult patients.  The recommended dose of EDURANT is one 
25 mg tablet taken once daily. 
Rilpivirine at the time of submission was not registered in any country in the world. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Rilpivirine is presented as film-coated tablets for immediate release containing rilpivirine hydrochloride 
equivalent to 25 mg rilpivirine as active substance. The other ingredients are povidone, polysorbate 20, 
lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose 
sodium and magnesium stearate. The ingredients of the coating are hypromellose, lactose 
monohydrate, macrogol, triacetin and titanium dioxide. The medicinal product is packaged in HDPE 
bottles with polypropylene (PP) child-resistant closure with an aluminium induction seal liner. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Rilpivirine is a white to almost white powder, is soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide and N,N-
dimethylacetamide, sparingly soluble in sulfinylbismethane, slightly soluble in methanol, propylene 
glycol and 1-methoxy-2-propanol. The active substance does not have chiral centres and is not 
considered hygroscopic. 
Three polymorphic forms of rilpivirine have been observed and a number of solvates can also be 
formed in various solvents. Polymorph form A is routinely produced by the synthetic process described 
in the dossier and is used in the manufacture of the finished product.  
Figure 1: Rilpivirine hydrochloride 
Manufacture 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, the active substance used is supplied by two active substance 
manufacturers. Detailed information about the manufacturing process, control of starting materials, 
reagents and solvents, control of critical steps and intermediates and process development and process 
validation of the active substance has been supplied in the form of an active substance master file 
(ASMF). The manufacturing process of the active substance consists of five steps synthesis. The 
purified active substance is packed in double, antistatic, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags, both 
the inner and the outer bag are appropriately closed and placed in a fibreboard container. The chemical 
structure of rilpivirine has been confirmed by spectroscopy (UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and MS) and 
XRD. In addition the molecular weight was determined by elemental analysis. 
Specification 
Rilpivirine specifications include tests for appearance, identification (IR), identification of chloride (Ph 
Eur), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content, particle size, sulphated

ash, and heavy metals. A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full method 
validation data was provided for the in-house analytical methods and are in accordance with the 
relevant ICH Guidelines. In general, the analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality 
of the active substance. The impurity limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of 
view of safety. Batch analysis data of 10 production scaled batches of active substance are provided. 
The tests and limits in the specifications are considered appropriate for controlling the quality of this 
active substance. 
Stability 
Stability data are presented for three batches of rilpivirine hydrochloride, stored for 36 months at 5°C, 
25 °C / 60% RH, 30°C/ 65% RH and 30°C/ 75% RH and 6 months at 40 °C / 75% RH. A photostability 
study and a forced degradation study were also performed according to ICH guidelines. The packaging 
used in stability trials is identical to that proposed for storage and distribution. 
The test parameters evaluated in these studies were appearance, assay, chromatographic purity, water 
content, particle size, microbiological purity and identification of polymorph. The testing was performed 
in accordance with the tests in the specifications for the drug substance. In the stability studies 
additional tests for microbiological purity and, polymorphism are also included. 
The active substance remained unchanged at all time points and under all conditions tested. No trends 
have been observed for any test parameter under any conditions with the exception for ICH light 
conditions. The results justify the retest period proposed when the active substance is stored in the 
original packing material protected from light. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The choice of the active substance and the excipients are sufficiently justified. The main aim of the 
pharmaceutical development was to formulate a conventional film-coated tablet, with a relatively rapid 
drug release. Prior to the selection of the final formulation and strength for commercial development, 
several earlier formulation and dosage strengths were investigated. An oral solution 25 mg/ml of the 
active substance as free base was developed. For additional clinical studies and commercialisation a 
solid dosage forms were considered for ease of administration. The first dosage form to be developed 
was a 50 mg hard capsule with the active substance free base. A 100 mg film-coated tablet was 
developed from the micronised hydrochloric acid salt of rilpivirine using standard wet granulation 
technology. Both the capsule and tablet formulations provided significant exposure to the active 
substance, which was either comparable to (capsule) or slightly lower than (tablet) the exposure 
obtained with the oral solution formulation. Following further experimental studies the tablet 
manufactured with the micronised hydrochloride salt was selected for further development because it 
provided sufficient bioavailability and a less complex manufacturing process. The initial 100 mg tablet 
was maintained for further use in clinical studies, and two additional strengths for use in the Phase 2b 
clinical study were considered (25 mg and 50 mg).  
For these tablets as the active substance concentration increased, the amount of lactose was 
decreased in order to maintain constant tablet weight (350 mg). This change was not adequate to 
provide the required lubricity for all strengths. 
Further pharmaceutical development was done before the phase 3 clinical trials in order to ensure ease 
of manufacturability. The qualitative composition of the phase 3 formulation was very similar to the

formulation used at the start of Phase 2b. This formulation was manufactured by means of a common 
blend that allowed the compression of dose-proportional tablets of different strengths and proportional 
tablet weights. The bioavailability study results demonstrated that both formulations (Phase 3 
formulation and Phase 2b formulation) are bioequivalent. Base on the results of pharmaceutical 
development and clinical trials the phase 3 formulation (25 mg) was selected as the final formulation. 
Adventitious agents 
As regards excipients of human or animal origin, the following applies. The lactose monohydrate is 
sourced from cow’s milk that is fit for human consumption. A letter of confirmation in respect of this 
matter from the supplier has been submitted. The magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin which 
also has been confirmed by supplier statement.  
Manufacture of the product 
The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  for  the  film-coated  tablets  involves  standard 
technology  and  it  is  divided  into  the  following  steps:  mixing,  granulation,  drying,  milling,  blending, 
compression,  film  coating,  and  packaging.  The  equipment  used  is  commonly  available  in  the 
pharmaceutical  industry.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been  adequately  described  and  some  steps 
have  been  identified  as  critical  and  optimised  during  the  drug  development  (granulation  and 
compression of tablets). The manufacturing process is adequately validated by three production scale 
batches.  Furthermore,  the  validation  protocol  proposed  for  the  full  scale  batches  has  been  provided 
and the quality of the production batches will be evaluated through the results of in process testing as 
well as the results of finished product testing. 
Product Specification  
The product specification is standard for film-coated tablets and contains tests with suitable limits for 
appearance, identification (IR), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), uniformity of dosage (Ph.Eur), 
dissolution, and microbiological purity (Ph.Eur). Impurities and degradation products have been 
evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety. It was noted that no new 
impurities were observed during the manufacturing of the finished product. All analytical procedures 
that were used for testing the finished product were properly described and satisfactorily validated in 
accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines. The batch analysis data for seven commercial batches 
confirm that the film-coated tablets can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished 
product specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies under ICH long-term, intermediate and accelerated conditions (i.e. 25°C/60% RH, 
30°C/65% RH, 30°C/75% RH and 40°C/75% RH) have been carried out on three batches of the 
finished product. The following parameters were monitored during the stability studies: appearance, 
assay, related compounds, dissolution, and water content (Ph.EUR). During the stability studies the 
product did not show any significant change in its quality. All the results remained well within the 
specification limits during all the stability studies. A photostability testing programme was conducted 
on three batches in accor rl Fischer) and microbiological purity dance with the recommendations of ICH 
guideline Q1B. The results were found to meet the specifications. The finished product requires light 
protection. Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in 
the SmPC are acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The pharmaceutical development of the formulation, the manufacturing process, control of the active 
substance and the finished product have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in 
accordance with relevant CHMP and ICH guidelines. The manufacturing flow-chart was provided with 
suitable in-process controls. The manufacturing process is adequately validated for three production 
scale batches at the proposed manufacturing site. Furthermore, the validation protocol proposed for 
the full scale batches has been provided and the quality of the production batches will be evaluated 
through the results of in process testing as well as the results of finished product testing. The routine 
specifications and tests methods proposed for the active substance and finished product will 
adequately control the quality of the active substance and finished product. Analytical methods were 
well described and validated in agreement with relevant guidelines.  
Batch analyses were presented and the results showed that the finished product meets the 
specifications proposed.  
The container-closure system for the finished product was found to be suitable to ensure the quality of 
the finished product as shown by the stability data.  
The conditions used in the stability studies comply with the ICH stability guideline. The control tests 
and specifications for the finished product were adequately established. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
have been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the medicinal product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, all quality issues have been resolved. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A comprehensive nonclinical programme was conducted to evaluate pharmacology, pharmacokinetics 
and toxicology of rilpivirine. The studies were conducted considering European and international 
guidelines. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Rilpivirine is a diarylpyrimidine non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of HIV-1. It 
binds to reverse transcriptase separately from the polymerase active site, inhibiting reverse 
transcriptase allosterically. Rilpivirine had no effect on human DNA synthesis up to 1000 µM.  
Antiviral activity in vitro 
Rilpivirine exhibited activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 in an acutely infected T-cell 
line with a median EC50 value for HIV-1/IIIB of 0.73 nM (0.27 ng/ml). 
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 13/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rilpivirine demonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M and O. EC50 for 
rilpivirine against HIV-1 group M (subtype A, B, C, D, F, G, H) was 0.07 – 1.01 nM (0.03 to 
0.37 ng/ml). Against group O, EC50 was 2.88 – 8.45 nM (1.06 to 3.10 ng/ml). EC90 against HIV-1 was 
1.12 – 1.79 nM (0.41 – 0.66 ng/mL). 
Rilpivirine demonstrated limited in vitro activity against HIV-2 with EC 50 values ranging from 2,510 to 
10,830 nM (920 to 3,970 ng/ml). 
A reduction in antiviral activity was observed in the presence of human serum proteins. The protein 
binding correction factor was experimentally determined to be 39.2 in the presence of 45 mg/mL 
human serum albumin. This corresponds to a high protein binding of rilpivirine. 
Resistance 
In fixed-dose selection experiments at high MOI (multiplicity of infection), the concentration of 
rilpivirine to prevent viral replication was lower (40 nM) than that of efavirenz, etravirine and 
nevirapine (at least 200 nM). Experiments in wild-type and NNRTI resistant strains showed that the in 
vitro resistance profile of rilpivirine may include the mutations V90I, L100I, K101E, V106A/I, V108I, 
E138G/K/Q/R, V179F/I, Y181C/I, V189I, G190E, H221Y, F227C, and M230I/L. It was shown 
crystallographically that rilpivirine is capable of conformational changes to mutations in the reverse 
transcriptase, thus providing protection to at least some of the potential mutations. Among a large 
amount of recombinant clinical isolates resistant to at least 1 first generation NNRTI, 62% remained 
susceptible to rilpivirine, which was similar to etravirine (62%) and better than efavirenz (11.3%) and 
nevirapine (4.6%). Experiments with site-directed mutants showed that M184V/I did not induce 
resistance to rilpivirine. 
A biological cut-off (BCO) for rilpivirine was determined at the fold change in EC50 value (FC) of 3.7, 
on the basis of the analysis of the susceptibility of a large panel of HIV-1 wild-type recombinant clinical 
isolates. 
No in vivo studies were performed with rilpivirine. Considering the sufficient presence of in vitro data 
and the limited relevance of in vivo animal data in this case (in animal studies, animal variants of the 
virus are investigated instead of the human HIV), this is endorsed. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Rilpivirine has no antiviral activity against various human viruses other than HIV and no potential off-
target activity, but might have low cytotoxic potential in various human cell lines. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Except for the dog cardiovascular study Exp5555 and the rat CNS study Exp5560, safety pharmacology 
studies were not GLP compliant. However, at least one study per vital organ system was performed 
under GLP and results of the GLP-compliant studies were consistent with those obtained in the non-
GLP studies. 
Results of the in vitro hERG test reveal that rilpivirine has the potential to prolong the QT-interval. 
Delayed QT prolongation was also observed in a thorough QT study, in which healthy subjects were 
exposed to 75 and 300 mg rilpivirine. This QT prolonging potential and its delayed onset was confirmed 
by the results of the additional in vitro cardiovascular safety studies. However, none of the studies do 
explain the mechanism behind the (delayed) onset of QT prolongation observed in man. It might be 
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 14/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentration-related since it was only observed following exposure to concentrations exceeding the 
clinically relevant concentrations in man. QT prolongation might also be highly species-specific, since it 
was only observed in man and not in any of the animal models used, not even following exposure to 
supratherapeutic concentrations. The role of accumulation can not be excluded either. The applicant 
indicates that a steady-state plasma concentration of rilpivirine was reached at day 7 after starting 
treatment. The occurrence of accumulation following long-term treatment with the intended dose of 25 
mg rilpivirine needs to be followed up. Overall, due to the results of the performed cardiovascular 
safety studies, the potential of rilpivirine to induce QT prolongation can still not be disregarded. Since 
the potential to induce QT prolongation was only observed in a human channel model and occurred 
after a certain time of delay, the applicant is requested as a post authorisation measure to investigate 
the whether species-specific metabolites maybe responsible for the QT prolongation of rilpivirine in 
man and the mechanism behind the QT prolongating and proarrhythmic potential of rilpivirine in man. 
Rilpivirine appears not to affect the respiratory and central nervous system when administered at 
therapeutic concentrations. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The applicant did not conduct specific pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine was investigated in a series of in vitro and in vivo 
studies. In vivo studies were conducted in CD 1 and CB6F1-nonTgrasH2-transgenic mice, pigmented 
Long Evans and Sprague Dawley rats, New Zealand white rabbits, beagle dogs and Cynomolgus 
monkeys. With the exception of pigmented rats, all species and strains were the same as those used in 
the non clinical pharmacology and toxicology studies.  
The drug substance, rilpivirine, has been used in 2 forms in the non-clinical studies, in base form and 
as the HCl salt form. The latter was used in a limited number of preclinical studies and in the clinical 
tablet formulations. 
Absorption 
In vitro experiments showed a medium permeability of rilpivirine. Passive transcellular diffusion was 
proposed as a mechanism for rilpivirine absorption. However, the solubility, and in case of suspension 
and solid dosage forms, also dissolution may limit the rate and extent of absorption. Rilpivirine is no 
substrate for P-gp, but has an inhibitory effect on P-gp. However, the IC50 is 26-fold higher than the 
Cmax in HIV-1 infected subjects (0.13 μg/ml) and therefore clinical effects are not likely. 
The studies were performed after single and repeated oral administration either as specific 
pharmacokinetic studies or as toxicokinetic evaluations of toxicology studies. Oral bioavailability of 
rilpivirine base appeared to be moderate in all species examined. After oral administration of rilpivirine 
base, the absolute oral bioavailability of rilpivirine was 32%, 54%, 31% and 24% to rats, rabbits, dogs 
and monkeys, respectively. Adding citric acid (CA) in the formulation administered to rats and dogs 
usually increased the exposure showing that the absorption of rilpivirine is pH-dependent in these 
species as in humans. 
Distribution 
Maximum blood concentrations of rilpivirine in rat and dog showed a plateau after an initial rapid 
absorption until ~8 hours. A higher exposure to rilpivirine was observed in mice compared to the other 
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 15/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
species. The volume of distribution is high in rat, dog and monkey, while it was low in rabbits. The 
clearance is moderate in rats, whereas in rabbits, dogs and monkeys the clearance is low. Species 
differences in t½ following iv administration were also observed between rat (4.4 h), rabbit (12-21 h), 
dog (31 h) and monkey (7.1 h). Exposure increased less than dose-proportionally in mice, rats, 
rabbits, dogs and immature monkeys after both single and repeated dose. Only in female mice a more 
than dose proportionate increase was observed after repeated dose. In monkeys, a dose-proportional 
increase in exposure was observed after single and repeated dosing. Toxicokinetic studies showed 
evidence of some accumulation of rilpivirine in female mouse and rat, dog and monkey plasma after 
repeated dosing. 
The binding of rilpivirine to human, monkey, dog, rat, rabbit and mouse plasma proteins is high in all 
species (>99%) and is concentration independent. Rilpivirine was highly bound to human albumin 
(99.5%) and to lesser extent to α1-acid glycoprotein (25-55%). In human plasma, the protein binding 
of rilpivirine appeared to be pH-dependent. The distribution of rilpivirine to red blood cells is limited in 
all species. Absorption of radioactivity was rapid with highest levels of radioactivity in all tissues at 4 h 
post-dose, except the uveal tract (24 h post-dose). This is in line with the high volume of distribution 
of rilpivirine and limited clearance. The highest tissue concentrations of radioactivity were observed in 
the uveal tract, liver and adrenal gland. Rilpivirine-related material crosses the blood-brain barrier. 
There appeared to be binding to melanin in the pigmented parts of the eye, meninges, skin and uveal 
tract. Although the concentrations in these tissues are low, accumulation is expected since radioactivity 
is still present 14 days post-dose. Rilpivirine-related material crosses the placenta barrier in rats. The 
AUC0-8h for total radioactivity in whole fetus was 0.64 times that in maternal blood. Placental transfer 
in humans is expected based on these results in rat and this information is reflected in section 4.6 of 
the SmPC. 
Metabolism 
Rilpivirine is metabolised via Phase I and Phase II reactions and a large number of metabolites were 
detected in all species. The most important pathway is oxidation and hydroxylation and to a minor 
extent conjugation with glutathione and glucuronide. Overall, identified metabolites that were detected 
in human matrices were also detected in at least one animal species. However, a unique metabolite 
(M15) formed by N glucuronidation of rilpivirine, was observed in human plasma (8.7%) and faeces 
(0.6%). This metabolite is expected to be inactive and non-toxic due to the glucuronidation. 
Rilpivirine metabolism as well as formation of all its metabolites was mainly catalysed by CYP3A4. 
CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2C8/9/10, CYP2C18, CYP2C19, and CYP3A5 are also involved, but to a 
lesser extent. Also CYP3A7 is involved in the metabolism of rilpivirine. The applicant is recommended 
to further elaborate on the impact of CYP3A5 on the exposure of rilpivirine. 
Reactive intermediate(s) of rilpivirine formed by phase I enzymes were scavenged by glutathione. 
Conjugation with glutathione was more dependent on the mu than the pi isoform of GST, although 
both isoforms were involved. GST mu and GST pi are subjected to genetic polymorphisms, leading to 
an absence or decreased isozyme activity. Thus, genetic polymorphisms of GST could influence the 
pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine in humans. However, conjugation with glutathione was a minor 
biotransformation route and therefore it is unlikely that GST will influence the pharmacokinetics of 
rilpivirine in humans. 
In vitro and in vivo data indicate that gender differences might be present for the biotransformation of 
rilpivirine. In addition, interspecies differences in metabolism were observed both in vitro and in vivo 
(e.g. glutathione conjugation was a major conjugation route in rat whereas in humans glucuronidation 
was the major conjugation route), making it more difficult to compare the different species.

Elimination 
The predominant route of elimination of radioactivity in all species following oral administration was via 
faeces (>85%), with a small contribution eliminated in urine (<6.2%). The majority of the eliminated 
radioactivity is unchanged rilpivirine (25-47% of the dose). In rats, biliary excretion is limited (18-
25%). Concentrations of rilpivirine were quantifiable in blood samples from rat pups, demonstrating 
that pups were exposed to rilpivirine via the milk.  
At therapeutic levels of rilpivirine, rilpivirine may inhibit the metabolism of clarithromycin (CYP3A4), 
sildenafil (CYP3A4), S-mephenytoin (CYP2C19) and norethindron (CYP2C19), but also, although less 
likely, the metabolism of sertraline (multiple CYPS, MAO, UGT), paroxetine (CYP2D6) and 17α 
ethinyloestradiol (Phase II metabolism). Rilpivirine could influence cortisol and aldosterone levels in 
vivo by a direct inhibition of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of those hormones. Furthermore, 
rilpivirine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A, and medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A may 
thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine. Rilpivirine at a dose of 25 mg is not likely to have a clinically 
relevant effect on the exposure of medicinal products metabolised by CYP enzymes. Rilpivirine resulted 
in an induction of CYP4A enzyme activity and to some extent of CYP3A. In addition, rilpivirine may 
induce UGT and GST, but the preclinical results were contradictory. 
A toxicity study in dogs showed changes in the liver accompanied by gall bladder pigmentation which 
suggest cholestasis. This study indicates that rilpivirine may mediate causative and adaptive 
transporter changes leading to cholestasis. Cholestasis can be caused by alterations of transporter 
function in the liver, such as sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), organic anion-
transporting polypeptides (OATPs) or multidrug resistance–associated proteins (MRPs). It can not be 
excluded that OATP transporters may be involved in the observed cholestasis in dogs. However, as 
cholestasis was not observed in clinical studies, it is unlikely that the recommended therapeutic dose of 
rilpivirine will lead to systemic interaction via P-gp or OATPs (no effect on atorvastatin in vivo). 
Based on in vitro data, rilpivirine metabolism as well as formation of all its metabolites was mainly 
catalysed by CYP3A4. CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2C8/9/10, CYP2C18, CYP2C19, and CYP3A5 are 
also involved, but to a lesser extent. Also CYP3A7 is involved in the metabolism of rilpivirine. The 
apparent Michaelis-Menten constant Km and Vmax values for the metabolism of 14C-rilpivirine in 
human liver microsomes were 4.17 μM and 381 pmol/mg/min, respectively. CYP3A5 is inactive in the 
majority of the population. However, due to an SNP in 20-30% of the population, in this group, 
CYP3A5 may be more active than CYP3A4. Evidence regarding involvement of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 is 
inconsistent throughout several experiments. The applicant is recommended to further elucidate the 
impact of CYP3A5 on exposure of rilpivirine. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The Applicant has performed a full program of non-clinical toxicity studies including repeated dose 
toxicity testing, genotoxic and carcinogenicity testing, reproductive and developmental studies, 
supplemented with studies on local tolerance, studies for the toxicological qualification of impurities 
and supportive mechanistical studies. In all in vivo studies rilpivirine was administered orally with the 
exception of the sensitization and dermal irritation studies. All pivotal studies were performed 
according to GLP. 
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 17/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Single dose toxicity  
The single dose evaluations were part of the initial oral dose range finding studies or, in the case of 
mice, part of the bone marrow micronucleus test.  
In mice, no relevant effects were noted following an oral single dose of up to 1600 mg/kg rilpivirine 
base in PEG400 + CA, the maximum feasible dose in this vehicle for this species. Exposures at 1600 
mg/kg were similar as those at 400 mg/kg indicating saturation of absorption (TMC278-Exp5538). 
Rats dosed with an oral maximum feasible single dose of 800 mg/kg rilpivirine base in PEG400 showed 
no treatment-related effects (TMC278-EXP5559).  
Dogs that received an oral maximum feasible dose of 80 mg/kg rilpivirine base in PEG400 or PEG400 + 
CA vomited more frequently and had softer stool than dogs treated with the vehicle. No other effects 
were noted (TMC278-EXP5461). 
In single dose toxicity evaluation it was concluded that the single dose toxicity of rilpivirine at the 
maximal feasible dose is low. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Systemic toxicity of rilpivirine base or rilpivirine after repeat dosing was studied in mice, rats, rabbits, 
dogs and cynomolgus monkeys. Pivotal repeat dose studies were conducted in mice (3 months), rats 
(1 and 6 months), dogs (1, 3, 6, and 12 months), and cynomolgus monkeys (8 weeks). as listed in 
Table 1 below; these included a number of non-pivotal studies in mice, rats and dogs. 
The mouse study served as dose range finder for the carcinogenicity study in that species. The 5-day 
rabbit study was a pilot for the rabbit embryo-fetal toxicity study. The studies in rats and dogs were 
designed to investigate the toxicity profile of rilpivirine and to support clinical studies and marketing 
authorization. A further mechanistic juvenile toxicity study was done in immature female cynomolgus 
monkeys. The reversibility upon repeat dosing was investigated in rats and dogs. 
In all studies high exposure multiples were reached varying from 2 in the monkey to >500 in the mice 
at the highest dose.

between rodents and dogs. In rodents predominantly hepatocellular hypertrophy was noted, while in 
dogs initial perivascular inflammatory reactions were followed by pigmentation of the liver and gall 
bladder suggestive of cholestasis was noted. No sign of liver toxicity was seen in the lowest tested 
dose (AUC ≥20 mice, ≥2 rat, ≥5 dog). The mechanism of the observed effects and why different 
effects were noted in rodents versus dogs has been fully clarified. A possible explanation for the liver 
pathology seen in rodents may be induction of liver enzymes (see pharmacokinetic section). Enzyme 
induction is generally rodent specific, and thus not relevant to humans. The cause for cholestasis in 
dogs may be more related to a treatment-related effect on drug transporters. A safety margin for the 
effect in dogs is present (≥ 5). Cholestasis was not observed in clinical studies. Because a minor 
potentially reactive metabolite of rilpivirine was observed in humans (2.7% of dose in feces) and 
evidence of liver toxicity in non-clinical species, (idiosyncratic) liver toxicity can not be completely 
excluded and are included in the risk management plan. 
Effects on the kidney were noted in mice (pale and enlarged/swollen kidneys, (necrotic) nephropathy), 
dogs (acute interstitial nephritis, corticomedullar mineralization) and possibly also rats (reduced weight, 
changes in urine parameters) at the highest dose level with a sufficient safety margin (≥80 mice, ≥6 
dogs, ≥14 rats).  
An effect on the adrenal gland and steroid hormone levels has been demonstrated in all species in 
studies of sufficient duration. The Applicant has performed additional mechanistical studies to explain 
these observations. From these studies it was concluded that most likely rilpivirine partially inhibits 
cytochrome CYP21 and CYP17 (enzymes are involved in the adrenal steroid synthesis). In the clinic the 
potential effect of rilpivirine treatment on steroid synthesis has been investigated, and no effect was 
noted. 
In the rat treatment-related hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the thyroid was seen. This is most likely 
caused by species-specific liver enzyme induction. In juvenile female monkeys rilpivirine induced 
minimal follicular cell hypertrophy in thyroid already at the lowest dose tested. 
A treatment-related induction of swollen and vacuolated cells in the pars distalis of the pituitary gland 
in rats is most likely secondary to the species-specific liver enzyme induction. 
In dogs, rilpivirine treatment appeared to induce early sexual maturation (1 month study) and 
activation (6 and 12 month study) of ovaries as suggested by the increases in the numbers of tertiary 
follicles, (cystic) luteinized follicles, and in some dogs by corpora lutea in the ovaries, and the changes 
in the other parts of the female genital tract and with the prominent activation of the mammary glands 
in the 1 month study. An opposite effect on the female genital tract was also noted in mice (i.e. 
reduced weight/size of ovaries/uterus, absence of ovulation, uterus atrophy and 
hyperkeratosis/mucification of vaginal epithelium). Some effects on the testes were seen in dogs, 
these included atrophic tubuli and hypertrophy of Leydig cells. The cause of these effects on the 
reproductive organs is unclear but they may be caused by the effect of rilpivirine on the hormonal 
balance due to partial CYP21 and CYP17 inhibition.  In the clinic no effect on these hormones was 
detected.

In mice, rat and dogs, small reduction in red blood cell parameters were noted. In rats increases in 
coagulation parameters were noted, which did not completely recovered following 1 month recovery 
period. Both effects may be due to rilpivirine induced liver pathology. Clinically no effects on the red 
blood cell parameters were noted. 
Genotoxicity 
Rilpivirine was studied in the standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests (in vitro test on bacteria 
(Ames test), and on mammalian cells (mouse lymphoma) and in vivo micronucleus in roedents. 
Rilpivirine did not show a genotoxic potential, at the highest feasible concentration or dose. 
Carcinogenicity 
No short or medium term studies were conducted. Long term carcinogenicity studies were performed in 
mice and rat. 
Rilpivirine was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by oral gavage administration to mice and rats up 
to 104 weeks. At the lowest tested doses in the carcinogenicity studies, the systemic exposures (based 
on AUC) to rilpivirine were 21 fold (mice) and 3 fold (rats), relative to those observed in humans at the 
recommended dose (25 mg once daily). In rats, there were no drug related neoplasms. In mice, 
rilpivirine was positive for hepatocellular neoplasms in both males and females. The observed 
hepatocellular findings in mice may be rodent specific.

Effects on embryo-foetal development were seen at maternal toxic doses in rats and below maternally 
toxic doses in rabbit. In the rat embryo-foetal development study a dose-related increase in the 
incidence of dilated renal pelvis increased dose related (0/140, 2/155, 5/149, 7/149) was noted. 
However all incidences were below the maximal historical control, and high exposure multiples were 
reached in this study. It was thus concluded that this effect is most likely not of toxicological relevance.  
In rabbits the incidence of branches of left subclavian artery and hypoplastic interparietal bone was 
increased. No marked effects were noted in the peri/post-natal development study in the rat. 
Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance studies were performed.  
Other toxicity studies 
No specific immunotoxicity or dependence studies were conducted.  
Three drug substance impurities (R600682, R600683, R289932) were specified at levels equal to or 
exceeding 0.15%. These impurities were adequately qualified regarding general toxicity and 
genotoxicity. In addition, there is an impurity with a genotoxic alert (T002594). The level of this 
genotoxic impurity has been restricted to below the TTC, in line with the Guideline on the limits of 
genotoxic impurities (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/251344/2006).

Rilpivirine is very persistent in the environment ((v)P). However the bioconcentration study showed 
that rilpivirine is not B, thus the compound is not PBT nor vPvB. Since PECsurfacewater is above 0.01 
μg/L, a phase II assessment has been performed. Results from phase IIa studies do not indicate any 
risk for the surface water, groundwater and STP.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed:

The MAH should submit studies in accordance with OECD 123 (regarding the determination of log Kow) 
and OECD 106 (regarding sediment and soil compartment). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Rilpivirine is a NNRTI of HIV-1. Rilpivirine exhibited activity against laboratory strains of wild-type 
HIV-1 in an acutely infected T-cell line with a median EC50 value for HIV-1/IIIB of 0.73 nM 
(0.27 ng/ml). Rilpivirine also demonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M 
and group O primary isolates.  
The most commonly observed resistance-associated mutations that emerged in cell culture from 
wild-type HIV-1 of different origins and subtypes as well as NNRTI resistant HIV-1included L100I, 
K101E, V108I, E138K, V179F, Y181C, H221Y, F227C and M230I. 
These data is reflected in section 5.1 on Pharmacodynamic properties of the SmPC. 
As part of the safety pharmacology programme, results revealed that rilpivirine has the potential to 
prolong the QT-interval. However, the mechanism behind the (delayed) onset of QT prolongation 
observed in man is not clear. It might be concentration-related or be highly species-specific, since it 
was only observed in man and not in any of the animal models used, not even following exposure to 
supratherapeutic concentrations. The role of accumulation can not be excluded either. Overall the 
potential of rilpivirine to induce QT prolongation can still not be disregarded. Since the potential to 
induce QT prolongation was only observed in a human channel model and occurred after a certain time 
of delay, the applicant is requested in accordance to the measure in the RMP to investigate whether 
species-specific metabolites maybe responsible for the QT prolongation of rilpivirine in man and the 
mechanism behind the QT prolongating and proarrhythmic potential of rilpivirine in man. 
Pharmacokinetics studies showed that the absorption of rilpivirine is pH-dependent in these species as 
in humans. 
Based on in vitro data, rilpivirine metabolism as well as formation of all its metabolites was mainly 
catalysed by CYP3A4. Evidence regarding involvement of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 is inconsistent 
throughout several experiments. Therefore, the applicant is recommended to further elucidate the 
impact of CYP3A5 on exposure of rilpivirine. 
Studies in animals have shown no evidence of relevant embryonic or foetal toxicity or an effect on 
reproductive function. There was no teratogenicity with rilpivirine in rats and rabbits. The exposures at 
the embryo-foetal No Observed Adverse Effects Levels (NOAELs) in rats and rabbits were respectively 
15 and 70 times higher than the exposure in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily. 
Studies in animals have shown limited placenta passage. 
Rilpivirine is excreted in the milk of rats.  
No clinically relevant effects on fertility were seen in animal studies. 
These data were reflected in sections 4.6 on Fertility, pregnancy and lactation and 5.3 on Preclinical 
safety data of the SmPC. 
Repeated dose toxicity showed liver toxicity associated with liver enzyme induction in rodents. In dogs, 
cholestasis-like effects were noted. The cause for cholestasis in dogs may be more related to a 
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 25/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment-related effect on drug transporters. A safety margin for the effect in dogs is present (≥ 5). 
Cholestasis was not observed in clinical studies. Because a minor potentially reactive metabolite of 
rilpivirine was observed in humans (2.7% of dose in feces) and evidence of liver toxicity in non-clinical 
species, (idiosyncratic) liver toxicity can not be completely excluded and are included in the risk 
management plan. 
Carcinogenicity long-term studies showed that Rilpivirine induced increases in liver tumours in mice 
and rat and in the thyroid in the rat. These tumours were linked to species/rodent-specific enzyme 
induction in the liver. This is a well-known mechanism for induction of liver tumours and secondary 
thyroid tumours in rats and does not occur in humans.  
Rilpivirine has tested negative in the absence and presence of a metabolic activation system in the in 
vitro Ames reverse mutation assay and the in vitro clastogenicity mouse lymphoma assay. Rilpivirine 
did not induce chromosomal damage in the in vivo micronucleus test in mice. 
These data were reflected in section 5.3 on Preclinical safety data of the SmPC.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non clinical issues: 
Since the potential to induce QT prolongation was only observed in a human channel model and 
occurred after a certain time of delay, the applicant will investigatre in accordance with the measures 
in the RMP to investigate whether species-specific metabolites maybe responsible for the QT 
prolongation of rilpivirine in man and the mechanism behind the QT prolongating and proarrhythmic 
potential of rilpivirine in man. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following point to be addressed: 
With respect to the Environmental Risk Assessment, the Applicant should submit studies in accordance 
with OECD 123 (regarding the determination of log Kow) and OECD 106 (regarding sediment and soil 
compartment). 
The applicant was recommended based on available samples from patients, to further elaborate on the 
impact of CYP3A5 on the exposure of rilpivirine.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Rilpivirine pharmacokinetics has been studied as primary or secondary objective in 33 conducted Phase 
I, II and III trials. Four validated bioanalytical assays LC-MS/MS were used during development. When 
exposed to light the drug is transformed to another isomeric form (Z- isomer). Selectivity towards the 
Z-isomer has been demonstrated.  
Absorption 
Rilpivirine is a poorly soluble (even less at pH above 2) drug with intermediate permeability in vitro. 
After oral administration, the maximum plasma concentration of rilpivirine is generally achieved within 
4-5 hours. 
Efflux data indicate that rilpivirine may be a substrate for P-gp. There is no indication of increased 
bioavailability with increasing dose above 25 mg hence the impact of active efflux for rilpivirine 
absorption seems not relevant at the chosen dose level. 
Absolute bioavailability of rilpivirine was not studied because of its low solubility. Comparable 
bioavailability is obtained with phase II and Phase III tablet forms.

The influence of food is substantial where normal fat and high fat meal result in similar exposure while 
if taken in fasting state the AUC is reduced by about 40%. If taken with only a protein rich nutritional 
drink the exposure is reduced by 50% as compared to a normal fat meal. Rilpivirine should be taken 
with a meal to ensure optimal absorption. This information is reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Distribution 
Animal data indicate that rilpivirine distributes over the whole body, but high concentrations were 
observed in liver, adrenal gland, brown fat and kidney. In addition, rilpivirine crosses blood-brain 
barrier, but to a small extent, and crosses the placenta. 
Blood to plasma ratio was 0.65-0.75 indicating limited distribution to blood cells. Plasma protein 
binding was on average 99.7%. Rilpivirine was extensively bound to albumin and to a lesser extent to 
alpha acid glycoprotein. Apparent volume of distribution was estimated to be 152 l in the Phase III 
population analysis. 
The distribution of rilpivirine into compartments other than plasma (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, genital 
tract secretions) has not been evaluated in humans. 
Elimination 
The terminal half-life was around 45-50 hours across trials. 
Rilpivirine is metabolised by hydroxylation, oxidation, glucuronidation and conjugation with glutathion. 
At 14 days after the administration of a single oral dose of radiolabelled rilpivirine, on average 85.1% 
± 4.0% of the administered radioactivity had been excreted via the faeces. The average recovery in 
urine was 6.1% ± 2.1% with only trace amounts ( 0.03%) of unchanged rilpivirine. The total 
radioactivity recovered was about 91.2 ± 5.1%. Only sixty % of the excreted radioactivity was 
identified. The major loss in radioactivity appears to be caused by the fact that late faeces samples 
were not analysed for metabolites, some during extraction and some not identified. Unchanged drug 
was excreted in faeces and accounted for 25.5% of the dose on average (range 12.1-33.4%). No 
quantitative conclusion can be made on the origin but some of the unchanged drug may originate from 
poor absorption (solubility issue at higher doses). It can also not be excluded that biliary excretion of 
rilpivirine exists as an elimination pathway.  
In plasma, unchanged drug accounted for a major part of the total radioactivity (76% based on Cmax 
and 51% based on AUClast). Fifty nine - 84 % of the drug related plasma exposure has been identified. 
Several metabolites were detected in plasma (glucuronides, direct and following oxidation, tricyclic and 
hydroxymethyl metabolite). Two metabolites were tested for antiviral activity M33 (hydroxymethyl-
rilpivirine, which constituted 4-11% of parent exposure in plasma) had similar activity on wild type 
virus while metabolite 42 (oxidation at the pyrimidinyl moiety, main metabolite in faeces, 16% of dose) 
had 36 times lower activity. Neither is active on resistant strains.  
In vitro data suggest that CYP3A4 is the major pathway involved in metabolism of rilpivirine. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Less than dose proportional increase in exposure at higher doses was observed, which is likely due to 
the limited solubility of the substance. The assessment of dose proportionality at lower doses was 
hampered by the fact that parallel group design was applied in all studies. Approximately dose 
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 28/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proportional increase was observed in healthy subjects up to 200 mg while in patients some studies 
indicated less than proportional increase already at lower doses while others suggested dose 
proportional increase. Since the applicant applied for only one dose with no dose adjustment the 
assessment of dose proportionality in patients is currently not essential. 
No time dependency was obvious however no comparison of CL/F between first dose and steady state 
dose within study was provided. Based on interaction data limited induction is expected at a dose of 25 
mg, hence this issue will not be further pursued. 
Special populations 
Interindividual variability was about 40%CV in oral clearance. No estimate on interoccasion variability 
in CL/F has been provided. 
In the population PK study of the Phase IIb trial 20-30% lower exposure was observed in patients as 
compared to healthy volunteers. In the Phase III studies comparison was made with on study C152 
(second thorough QT study). The exposure was 40 % lower in patients. Other data in healthy subjects 
suggest that Study C152 was at the higher end of exposures observed in healthy subjects. 
 
Impaired renal function 
Renal elimination of rilpivirine is negligible.  No study has been performed in patients with renal 
impairment. Since severe renal impairment may affect also drugs that are eliminated through hepatic 
elimination a cautious approach is recommended especially when combined with potent inhibitors of 
CYP3A.  
 
Impaired hepatic function 
Rilpivirine is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver.  
In a study comparing 8 patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score A) to 8 matched 
controls, and 8 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score B) to 8 matched controls, 
the multiple dose exposure of rilpivirine was 47% higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 
5% higher in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
No data on unbound exposure has been submitted and the applicant claims it impossible to measure 
due to insensitivity of the assay. In the group with Child Pugh B very few subjects appear by score to 
have an affected metabolic capacity. Hence it cannot be excluded that the effect on unbound exposure 
would be larger in other subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and there is very limited safety 
data in this group. Therefore a more cautious approach is proposed in these groups of patients. 
  Gender, race, weight 
No clinically relevant impact of sex, race (White, Black or Asian), weight or BMI on rilpivirine PK was 
identified in the population PK analysis. 
  Elderly 
There is essentially no data in elderly (2 subjects above 65) hence no conclusions regarding elderly can 
be made. 
The above information is reflected in section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC.

  Children 
The pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine in pediatric patients are not part of this procedure. 
  Pregnancy 
There are no pharmacokinetic studies in pregnant women submitted in this application. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
 
In vitro 
In vitro data suggest that rilpivirine may inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP2E1 at a systemic level and 3A4 at 
an intestinal level. Furthermore time dependent inhibition of CYP2C9 by rilpivirine cannot be excluded. 
Therefore the applicant will further investigate inhibitory properties (time dependent) of rilpivirine on 
CYP2C9 according to the measures in the RMP. 
The in vitro induction data shows that rilpivirine is an inducer. The enzyme pattern induced (CYP3A4, 
CYP1A2 and possibly CYP2B6) fits PXR/CAR mediated induction hence several enzymes and transport 
proteins may be induced. The CYP2E1 results were inconclusive.  
In vitro data suggest that rilpivirine may inhibit P-gp in the gut. Systemic inhibition of P-gp is not 
expected.  
 
In vivo 
In vivo data with atorvastatin suggests that rilpivirine is not an inhibitor of OATP. There is no data on 
interaction potential with other transport proteins. 
In vivo interaction data was to a large extent obtained with rilpivirine at a higher dose (150 mg) in 
healthy subjects. Steady state conditions for the interactions were aimed for See Table 6.

Table 6: Some main DDI studies for rilpivirine 
No effect of tenofovir, didanosine, sildenafil, atorvastatin, anticontraceptives or methadone on 
rilpivirine exposure was observed. 
Inducers of CYP3A affected the exposure of rilpivirine and can affect as such the efficacy. 
Therefore the anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin; the 
antimycobacterials: rifabutin, rifampicin, rifapentine; the systemic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, 
except as a single dose treatment and St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) are contra-indicated. 
Drugs affecting the gastric pH substantially also affected the exposure of rilpivirine. Therefore proton 
pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole are 
contra-indicated. 
Staggered dosing is suggested for H2 antagonists and antacids. 
No dose adjustments are suggested for CY3A inhibitors.

Further data on interaction studies with raltegravir and rifabutin will be provided according to the 
measures mentioned in the RMP. 
Rilpivirine exhibit a dose dependent induction in vivo with limited or no effect observed at lower doses 
than 150 mg q.d. At a dose of 25 mg no relevant impact on substrates of CYP3A, CYP2E1 and CYP2C19 
is expected. Tenofovir exposure was increased by 23% when co-administered with rilpivirine (150 mg). 
The mechanism is not fully clear; the clinical relevance of this interaction is further discussed under 
safety. 
Rilpivirine inhibits creatinine secretion in vivo. Inhibition of creatinine secretion has been suggested to 
be due to OCT-2 inhibition, but later publications also indicate that creatinine secretion as well as 
metformin secretion may involve MATE as a main transporter. There is a risk of a clinically relevant 
interaction with metformin. Therefore, an interaction study with metformin will be performed, which 
also includes investigations of the MATE inhibitory potential of rilpivirine (see corresponding measures 
in the RMP). 
After a 25 mg dose mean Cmax in healthy subjects (QTc study C152) mean Cmax at day 11 was 247 
ng/ml and AUCtau about 3300 ngh/ml. The exposure in this study was at the higher end of observed 
exposure. 
A clear relation between concentration and QTc prolongation was observed after administration of 75 
and 300 mg rilpivirine day 11. Women were more sensitive to QTc prolongation than men. The mean 
maximum prolongation appeared to coincide with the mean time of maximum concentration. It was 
noted that the QTc prolongation at day 11 was substantially higher than expected based on exposure 
of the parent compound (75 mg q.d. had lower exposure day 11 then 300 mg day 1 but higher QTc 
prolongation). Given the large exposure margin for the parent compound in preclinical studies and 
longer half-life of radioactivity in the mass-balance study, any contribution by metabolites to the QTc 
effect needs to be further elucidated. Therefore the applicant agreed to submit a report of the 
metabolite profiling and decision on synthesis of disproportional metabolites in relation to QT 
prolongation (see corresponding measures in the RMP). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Rilpivirine is a diarylpyrimidine NNRTI of HIV-1. Rilpivirine activity is mediated by non-competitive 
inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Resistance 
Rilpivirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild-type HIV-1 of different 
origins and subtypes as well as NNRTI resistant HIV-1.  
- 
In sequential passages of different fixed doses of rilpivirine, no virus was seen using 40 nM or 
higher.  
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 32/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
- 
Passages with gradually increasing dose, starting low, suggested the in vitro genotypic profile 
for rilpivirine to be:  V90I, L100I, K101E, V106A/I, V108I, E138G/K/Q/R, V179F/I, Y181C/I, 
V189I, G190E, H221Y, F227C, and M230I/L. 
Considering all of the available in vitro and in vivo data, the following amino acid substitutions, when 
present at baseline, are likely to affect the activity of rilpivirine: K101E, K101P, E138A, E138G, E138K, 
E138R, E138Q, V179L, Y181C, Y181I, Y181V, H221Y, F227C, M230I, and M230L. The basis for this list 
of rilpivirine-associated mutations is discussed in more detail in section Failure and Resistance 
development in the clinical part. The fold changes seen with the most common rilpivirine-associated 
single mutations are low to modest. 
It is of major importance to understand that this list only refers to treatment naïve patients, prior to 
starting therapy, and previously treatment naïve patients failing therapy with rilpivirine. In contrast, 
this list is not sufficient for a safe use in patients with prior virological failure with another NNRTI-
based regimen. This is because a large number of NNRTI-associated mutations were used as exclusion 
criteria in the clinical studies. In addition to in vitro selection studies, that list of excluding mutations 
was based on data from the literature, and also included mutations not known to be associated to 
rilpivirine (or efavirenz).  
Hence,  the efficacy of rilpivirine in patients with virus showing the NNRTI mutations listed as exclusion 
criteria, but not selected for within the in vitro studies (or in vivo), has in fact not been studied. It is 
not straightforward to rely on in vitro sensitivity to make extrapolated assumptions about clinical 
activity against the excluded mutants/polymorphisms, since the in vitro fold changes are relatively low 
also for mutations clearly associated with virological failure on rilpivirine. 
In addition to the mutations included in the list above, mutation M184I (intermediate mutation in the 
development of typical lamivudine/emtricitabine resistance) doubles the fold change of the most 
common rilpivirine-associated mutation E138K, and is in practice directly involved in the resistance 
score. This double mutation, E138K+M184I, was indeed the most common mutation pattern in 
patients failing rilpivirine in the phase 3 studies. Interestingly this pair of mutations were found in 
patients with the tenofovir/FTC backbone - but not in those treated with zidovudine/3TC (true for both 
phase 3 and phase 2b studies), and in only 1 patient treated with abacavir (low numbers), table 7 
below.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Discussion on clinical pharmacokinetics 
The influence of food is substantial where normal fat and high fat meal result in similar exposure while 
if taken in fasting state the AUC is reduced by about 40%. Rilpivirine should be taken with a meal to 
ensure optimal absorption. This information is reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
rilpivirine crosses blood-brain barrier, but to a small extent, and crosses the placenta. 
Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A as well as drugs affecting the gastric pH substantially affected the 
exposure of rilpivirine. Co-administration with inducers and PPIs (drugs affecting the gastric pH) are 
contraindicated (section 4.3), as these may decrease the plasma levels of rilpivirine and as such the 
efficacy. Staggered dosing is suggested for H2 antagonists and antacids. 
All relevant information on pharmacokinetic interactions is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
The information on pharmacokinetics is reflected in sections 4.2, 4.5, 4.6 and 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Additional information on interactions and on the contribution of metabolites in QT prolongation will be 
performed according to the relevant measures in the RMP (see below). 
Rilpivirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild-type HIV-1 of different 
origins and subtypes as well as NNRTI resistant HIV-1. Considering all of the available in vitro and in 
vivo data, the following amino acid substitutions, when present at baseline, are likely to affect the 
activity of rilpivirine: K101E, K101P, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138R, E138Q, V179L, Y181C, Y181I, 
Y181V, H221Y, F227C, M230I, and M230L. The basis for this list of rilpivirine-associated mutations is 
discussed in more detail in section Failure and Resistance development in the clinical part. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology data submitted are considered satisfactory. 
The CHMP considers the following measures as part of the RMP necessary to further characterise the 
pharmacology of the product: 
- To further investigate inhibitory properties (time dependent) of rilpivirine on CYP2C9 
- To provide further data on interaction studies with raltegravir and rifabutin 
- To perform an interaction study with metformin, which also includes investigations of the MATE 
inhibitory potential of rilpivirine 
- To submit a report of the metabolite profiling and decision on synthesis of disproportional metabolites 
in relation to QT prolongation. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
To determine clinical efficacy, the submitted clinical dossier consist of (see Figure 2):  
  2 phase IIa studies proof-of-principle (functional) monotherapy studies in ARV-naïve (C201) 
and ARV-experienced (C202) HIV-1 infected patients to confirm its antiviral activity. 
  1 phase IIb dose finding study in ARV naïve HIV-1 infected adults with rilpivirine 25 mg, 75mg 
or 150 mg q.d. 
  2 pivotal phase III randomized trials (C209 and C215) in ARV naïve HIV-1 infected adults 
comparing rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. plus 2 N(t)RTIs to efavirenz 600 mg q.d. plus 2 N(t)RTIs.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Phase IIa studies 
Two  phase  IIa  proof-of-principle  studies  were  performed  with  rilpivirine  in  HIV-1  infected  patients  to 
confirm its antiviral activity. One study (C201) explored the efficacy of different dosages  of rilpivirine 
mono-therapy  in  treatment-naïve  patients  (n  =  36  received  rilpivirine)  while  the  other  study  (C202) 
explored  the  efficacy  of  different  dosages  of  rilpivirine  in  treatment-experienced  patients  (n  =  36 
received  rilpivirine)  as  a  substitute  for  a  failing  NNRTI  or  protease  inhibitor  (PI)  (=  functional  mono-
therapy).  The  treatment  duration  in  both  studies  was  limited  to  7  days  to  minimize  the  risk  of 
emergence  of  mutations.  Both  studies  confirmed  a  significant  in  vivo  activity  to  HIV-1  of  different 
dosages  (25  mg  –  150  mg  q.d.)  of  rilpivirine.  Based  on  these  results  a  final  dose-finding  phase  IIb 
study was performed (C204). 
A 1.2 log10 reduction of HIV-RNA was seen, with no relevant difference between doses tested. This 
means that the potency of rilpivirine is low compared to other agents (raltegravir > 2log10 reduction, 
PI/r around -2log10, efavirenz -1.6 log10; tenofovir and abacavir around 1.6 log10 reduction in 
monotherapy).   
No emerging resistance in the RT gene was detected at any time during treatment, using population 
sequencing. 
Phase IIb study 
C204 is a randomized, active controlled, partially blinded (to dose of rilpivirine) trial in treatment-naïve 
HIV-1  patients  to  evaluate  the  dose-response,  efficacy,  tolerability,  and  safety  of  a  96-week  regimen 
with 3 doses (25mg, 75 mg and 150mg) of rilpivirine. The active comparator was EFV 600 q.d. and all 
patients 
received  a  background 
regimen  of  2  N(t)RTIs  selected  by 
the 
investigators 
(tenofovir/emtricitabie,  abacavir/lamivudine  or  zidovudine/lamivudine).  After  96  weeks  all  patients 
were offered to continue or switch their study medication to rilpivirine 75 q.d. After 144 weeks, based 
on  the  evaluation  of  the  96  weeks  data,  they  were  switched  to  rilpivirine  25  q.d.  This  trial  is  still 
ongoing to obtain long-term (up to 240 weeks) efficacy and safety data.

It should be noted that the rilpivirine 25 mg formulation (F001) used in this trial is different from the 
formulation (F006) used in the pivotal phase III trials The current request for marketing authorization 
concerns the latter rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. formulation (F006). The different formulations are considered 
to be bioequivalent. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria were those commonly used for treatment naïve patients. Two specific 
issues are considered particularly relevant. 1) An extensive number of NNRTI-associated mutations 
constituted exclusion criteria (n=37); 2) A cortisol level on the screening assessment requested for 
inclusion. This criterion was the major reason for screening failures (around 8% of screened patients). 
The reason for this and for endocrine monitoring performed, were effects on the steroid hormones 
seen pre-clinically.  
The  study  included  HIV-1  infected  ARV  treatment  naïve  adults  with  a  plasma  viral  load  of  >  5,000 
copies/mL  who  were  appropriate  to  initiate  ART  according  to  the  investigator’s  judgment,  who  were 
susceptible to the selected ARV regimen (according to baseline genotyping). 
As  defined  by  exclusion  criteria  all  subjects  were  relatively  healthy  (e.g.  life  expectancy  >  6  months, 
absence of AIDS defining illness, absence of renal impairment or other significant coexisting illness).  
Of 515 screened subjects, 368 (71%) were randomized and received treatment (≈ n = 90 per 
treatment arm). The most common reasons for screen failures were cortisol levels outside the required 
levels, abnormal lab values and viral load values ≤ 5,000 copies/mL.  The proportion of screen failures 
excluded because of NNRTI RAMs from the exclusion list was 3.5% (5/142); this represented 1.0% of 
the total screened population (5/515). The mutations observed at screening in these 5 subjects were 
K101E, K103N, Y181C, and G190A. All of these mutations are listed in the most recent IAS-USA 
December 2010 Resistance Mutations Update as associated with resistance to NNRTIs. 
The  demographics  were  quite  representative  of  today’s  patients,  including  race  other  than  white  and 
non-B  subtypes  being  well  represented.  Discontinuations  were  rather  common  with  around  25%  of 
patients  stopping  therapy  prior  to  week  96  for  various  reasons.  However,  reasons  for  stopping  were 
not markedly different between the treatment arms, including the control. 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  virologic  response  (<  50 
copies/mL,  TLOVR)  at  96  weeks  which  demonstrated  rilpivirine  to  be  efficacious  across  different 
dosages.

Numbers  are  small  for  proper  sub  analyses  regarding  dose  dependency  according  to  baseline  VL. 
However,  the  difference  between  doses  25  mg  and  150  mg  in  patients  with  a  baseline  VL  >100000  
(94% vs 72%) is significant at week 48.  
The  majority  of  patients  were  taking  zidovudine/lamivudine  in  this  study  (75%),  in  contrast  to  the 
pivotal studies. 
rilpivirine seems to be doing better when combined with zidovudine/3TC (given in low income regions) 
than with tenofovir/FTC (given in EU/US) and it is not expected that EU and US study sites yield worse 
outcomes than sites in the other regions of this study (this trend is further discussed in the main 
clinical studies).  
The  efficacy  of  rilpivirine  was  maintained  up  to  192  weeks  of  treatment.  By  Week  144,  64.5%  of 
subjects had maintained virologic response (< 50 copies/mL, TLOVR) (note that all rilpivirine recipients 
used  75  mg  q.d.  between  week  96  and  144).  By  Week  192,  a  total  of  58.8%  of  subjects  taking 
rilpivirine  had  maintained  virologic  response  (note  that  all  rilpivirine  recipients  used  25  mg  q.d. 
between  week  144  and  192).    These  long  term  outcomes  were  similar  to  the  results  in  the  control 
group (EFV 600 mg q.d.). 
Thirty-one  of  279  subjects  (11.1%)  randomized  in  the  rilpivirine  group  and  8  of  89  subjects  (9.0%) 
randomized  in  the  control  (EFV)  group  experienced  virological  failure  at  the  time  of  the  Week  192 
analysis.  For  21/30  patients  treated  with  TCM278  and  with  available  genotypic  and  phenotypic  data, 
emergence  of  reverse  transcriptase  mutations  was  observed.  The  most  frequently  emerging  reverse 
transcriptase  mutations  were:  L74V,  K101E,  V108I,  E138K,  E138R,  I178L,  Y181C,  M184V,  M184I, 
M230L,  and  N348I.  Thirteen  of  the  30  subjects  had  emerging  nucleoside/tide  reverse  transcriptase 
inhibitor  resistance  associated  mutations.  Emergence  of  M184V  or  M184I  (associated  to  the 
development  of  resistance  to  lamivudine  and  emtricitabine)  was  observed  in  the  rilpivirine  group  but 
not  in  the  control  (EFV)  group.  In  the  control  (EFV)  group,  the  emerging  non-nucleoside  reverse 
transcriptase  inhibitor  resistance-associated  mutations  observed  in  the  subjects  experiencing 
virological failure were K103N and V106M.

Subjects experiencing virological failure in the rilpivirine group with phenotypic resistance to rilpivirine 
were  generally  cross-resistant  to  etravirine  and  efavirenz,  and  subjects  from  the  control  (EFV)  group 
with phenotypic resistance to EFV retained sensitivity to rilpivirine and etravirine. 
Dose selection  
A  dose-response  relationship  could  not  be  demonstrated.  However,  initially  the  75  mg  q.d.  dose  was 
selected for the Phase III trials and further development of rilpivirine because, though not statistically 
significant, the proportion of virologic failures in the rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. group was 8.6% compared 
to 5.3% and 6.6% in the 75 mg q.d. and 150 mg q.d. dose groups, respectively. Furthermore, there 
was a trend towards lower efficacy of the 25 mg q.d group among those with a high baseline viral load. 
Later, data became available demonstrating a possible dose-response relationship with respect to AEs 
(see below and safety assessment).  
A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between change from baseline in QTcF 
interval and exposure (AUC24h) to rilpivirine (p < 0.001) as illustrated by the following scatterplot 
(Figure 3).  
Figure 3. Scatter-plot of rilpivirine AUC24h vs the Maximum Change in QTcF Interval From Baseline 
(Phase IIb Trial C204) 
Thus rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. formulation was finally chosen for further evaluation in phase III studies as 
well as the prolonged arm of this phase IIb study.  
A concern was raised on the possible suboptimal dose of 25 mg q.d. in terms of efficacy, especially 
among patients with high baseline viral load, and the applicant was requested to further clarifiy the 
relation between dosage, exposure, efficacy, virologic failure and emergence of resistance stratified by 
baseline viral load. The phase IIb study did not show a dose-response in terms of virologic response 
for both low and high baseline viral load categories, however, there was a tendency towards a lower 
reponse in patients with lower AUC, although there was a large overlap in AUC values between

responders and non-responders. This trend was also observed within the phase 3 studies using the 25 
mg dose based on population PK. Also within the dose-finding study there appeared a trend for higher 
rates of emerging resistance in the lowest dose group of 25 mg TCM278 q.d. and especially for 
patients with baseline viral load > 100,000 copies/ml. Analyses of phase 3 studies stratified by 
baseline viral load showed lower virologic response, higher rate of virologic failure, and increased risk 
of resistance for patients with baseline viral load > 100,000 copies/ml compared to control group and 
compared to patients with lower baseline viral load. It remains unknown whether an intermediate dose 
of 50 mg rilpivirine q.d. would allow enhancing the virological suppression at the level of efavirenz 
without exposing to a critical risk of QT prolongation.  
2.5.2.  Main studies  
C209 and C215 
The two phase III studies (C209 and C215) are both randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, trials 
of rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. versus EFV 600 mg q.d. in combination with a fixed background regimen 
consisting of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (C209) or with a background regimen 
containing 2 investigator initiated N(t)RTIs (either ABC/3TC, AZT/3TC or TDF/FTC) (C215) in ARV-
naïve HIV-1 infected subjects. 
The design of these trials were similar and therefore there is a common description. The outcomes are 
presented separately together with the pooled data.  
Methods 
Study Participants 
Included HIV-1 infected adults with a plasma viral load of > 5,000 copies/mL who were appropriate to 
initiate ART according to the investigator’s judgment, had never received ARV treatment, who were 
susceptible to the selected background regimen at screening, and who had no NNRTI RAMs from a 
predefined list were eligible for this trial (A098G, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138Q, E138R, F227C, G190A, 
G190C, G190E, G190Q, G190S, G190T,K101E, K101P, K101Q, K103H, K103N, K103S, K103T, K238N, 
K238T, L100I, M230I, M230L, P225H,P236L, V106A, V106M, V108I, V179D, V179E, Y181C, Y181I, 
Y181V, Y188C, Y188H, Y188L, Y318F).  
Exclusion criteria were the use of disallowed concomitant therapy, life expectancy < 6 months, 
presence of AIDS defining illness except cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma and HIV wasting syndrome, acute 
HIV-1 infection, HIV-2 coinfection, any active clinically significant disease, subjects with a risk factor 
for QTc prolongation, pregnancy or breastfeeding, absence of effective birth control methods, 
estimated glomerular filtration rate < 50mL/min.   
Both trials are conducted in USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa and Latin America with some 
differences seen in the proportions of subjects recruited per region and country between the two 
trials. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either rilpivirine 25 mg q.d or to EFV 600 mg q.d. 
(control) plus a background regimen containing TDF/FTC (C209) or 2 investigator-selected N(t)RTIs 
(either ABC/3TC, AZT/3TC or TDF/FTC) (C215).  
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 39/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rilpivirine (or placebo) q.d. should have been taken with food, preferably breakfast, each dose 
separated by approximately 24 hours. EFV (or placebo) q.d., was taken on an empty stomach, 
preferably at bedtime, each dose separated by approximately 24 hours. The background regimen was 
recommended to be taken at the same time as rilpivirine (or placebo). Due to the differences in 
administration with or without food, a double-dummy design was chosen so subjects receiving active 
rilpivirine also took placebo EFV (and vice versa) in addition to their background regimen. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of treatment with rilpivirine 25 mg q.d 
compared to control (EFV 600 mg q.d.) in regard to the proportion of virologic responders (plasma 
viral load < 50 human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-1 ribonucleic acid [RNA] copies/mL, according to 
the TLOVR algorithm at 48 weeks, with a maximum allowable difference of 12%. 
Secondary objectives included: 
- demonstrate non-inferiority of rilpivirine compared to EFV with a maximum allowable difference of 
10% at 48 weeks for the primary efficacy endpoint; 
- evaluate superiority in efficacy of rilpivirine compared to EFV, in case non-inferiority was established; 
- evaluate and compare the safety and tolerability of rilpivirine when administered as 25 mg q.d. 
versus (vs.) EFV over 48 and 96 weeks; 
- evaluate and compare the antiviral activity of rilpivirine when administered as 25 mg q.d. vs. EFV 
over 
48 and 96 weeks; 
- evaluate and compare immunologic changes (as measured by CD4+ cell count) in the rilpivirine 
group vs. those in the EFV group over 48 and 96 weeks; 
- assess the evolution of the viral genotype and phenotype over 48 and 96 weeks; 
- evaluate the population pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships 
for efficacy and safety of rilpivirine. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of subjects with virologic response, i.e. a viral 
load < 50 HIV-1 copies/mL at Week 48, according to the time to loss of virologic response 
(TLOVR) algorithm. 
Sample size 
The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of subjects with virologic response, i.e., a 
plasma viral load < 50 copies/mL, according to the FDA’s TLOVR algorithm. Based on previous trials 
with EFV, the proportion of virologic responders (response rate) in the control group was expected to 
be approximately 70–80%. Assuming a response rate of 75% at 48 weeks for both treatment options, 
it was calculated that 340 subjects would be needed per treatment group (rilpivirine or control) to 
establish non-inferiority of rilpivirine vs. EFV with a maximum allowable difference of 12%, at 95% 
power. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either rilpivirine or EFV. Randomization was stratified by 
screening viral load (strata were ≤ 100,000; > 100,000 - ≤ 500,000; and > 500,000 copies/mL) and 
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 40/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
for trial C215 also by background regimen (ABC/3TC, AZT/3TC, TDF/FTC). 
Predefined randomization schedules using permuted blocks were applied to ensure balance across 
treatment groups in the strata and random treatment assignment. 
Blinding (masking) 
After randomization on Day 1, neither Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, the investigator, nor the subjects who 
had been allocated to one of the double-blind NNRTI treatments (rilpivirine or EFV) were aware of the 
identity of their treatment. In addition to the investigator-selected N(t)RTIs, subjects assigned to one 
of the double-blind treatments took 2 tablets daily, either: 
- Active rilpivirine and EFV placebo 
- Active EFV and rilpivirine placebo 
The placebo tablets were identical in appearance to their respective active treatments. 
The primary analysis was performed once all randomized subjects had been treated for 48 weeks, or 
had been withdrawn earlier (cut-off date 28 January 2010). For this analysis, the blind was broken for 
Tibotec Pharmaceuticals but not for subjects, investigators, and monitors who interact with site 
personnel. 
Once the trial is completed (96-week data and follow-up visits) and the database is locked, a final 
analysis will be performed on all available data. The investigator will receive a copy of the 
randomization codes for the subjects participating in his/her center, clearly identifying the treatment 
numbers and the corresponding treatment group (rilpivirine or control). 
A DSMB was installed to monitor the safety of the subjects included in the trial. Blinded data was sent 
to the DSMB every 16 weeks. A summary of SAEs, grade 3 and grade 4 AEs, and AEs leading to 
discontinuation was provided on a monthly basis. Two formal DSMB analyses were performed: the first 
when 340 randomized subjects (50% of the planned number of subjects) had reached ≥12 weeks of 
treatment or discontinued, and the second when almost all randomized subjects had reached 24 weeks 
of treatment or discontinued. Data of these analyses were shared with the DSMB but not with Tibotec 
Pharmaceuticals (other than the Sponsor Review Committee) or site personnel directly involved in trial 
conduct. In these analyses, the treatment code was partially unblinded (up to code level) to the DSMB, 
but not revealed to Tibotec Pharmaceuticals (other than the Sponsor Review Committee). Involvement 
of the Sponsor Review Committee in these analyses was according to the DSMB Charter. Although full 
unblinding did not occur, if deemed necessary by the DSMB, treatment codes could be fully unblinded 
to the DSMB members only. Based on these analyses, the DSMB recommended that the trial could 
continue without modification. 
Statistical methods 
The intent-to treat (ITT) population was defined as the set of all subjects who were randomized and 
who took at least 1 dose of study medication, regardless of their adherence with the protocol 
or their eligibility. 
The per protocol (PP) population was defined as the set of all randomized subjects who took at least 1 
dose of study medication and experienced no major protocol violations during the trial. 
The primary population was the ITT population. However, since an analysis on the ITT population may 
not be conservative in a non-inferiority setting, an analysis based on the PP population was also 
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 41/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
performed to investigate the impact of exclusion of subjects with major protocol violations and to 
evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis results. 
The safety analyses were performed on the ITT population. 
The primary efficacy variable in the primary population (ITT) was compared between rilpivirine 
and control at the Week 48 time point, adjusted for factors treatment group and background 
regimen (C215), and using baseline log10 plasma viral load as a continuous variable. The model-based 
odds ratio for rilpivirine relative to control was presented along with the associated 95% CI. The 
predicted proportion of responders with 95% CI as well as the differences in these proportions with 
95% CI, based on the above logistic regression model, for the rilpivirine and control was calculated. 
A p-value for non-inferiority of rilpivirine compared with control was provided for a maximum 
allowable difference of 12% (the primary efficacy analysis) and 10% (secondary efficacy 
analysis). A p-value for superiority of rilpivirine compared with control was also provided where 
non-inferiority was achieved.

Screening failures 
The reasons for screening failures are displayed in the following Table 9 (of note: as subjects could 
have more than one reason for screening failure these numbers outweigh the number of patients): 
Table 9.

Of  1895  screened  patients,  1368  (72%)  were  randomized  and  received  allocated  treatment  (686 
rilpivirine versus 682 EFV). The reasons for screening failure (n = 527) were low baseline viral load (< 
5.000  copies/mL),  presence  of  at  least  NNRTI  RAM  or  having  risk  factors  for  QTc  prolongation  or 
laboratory toxicities.  
A  considerable  part  (165/1895;  8.7%=35%  of  screening  failures)  of  the  population  failed  inclusion 
because  of  baseline  viral  load  of  <  5,000  copies/ml,  and  the  applicant  was  asked  to  justify  this 
threshold (Q62). In their response, the applicant argued that this threshold was chosen to allow for a 
measureable decrease in viral load of ≥ 1.0 log10 copies/mL, given the detection limit of 50 copies/ml. 
This is considered acceptable.   
In the overall screened population with genotypic data, 156 (8.7%) out of 1,796 subjects had at least 
1  NNRTI  RAM  of  the  protocol  list.  To  what  extent  this  8.7%  primary  genotypic  resistance  implicates 
phenotypic  resistance  to  either  rilpivirine  or  EFV  is  unclear.  The  most  frequent  mutation  was  E138A 
that is associated with resistance to rilpivirine and not to EFV.  
Recruitment 
Primary analyses were performed when all subjects completed 48 weeks of treatment or 
discontinued earlier (cut-off date of 01 February 2010 for C209 and 28 January 2010 for C215). 
The final analysis of the two Phase III trials will be performed when all subjects have completed 
96 weeks of treatment, or discontinued earlier. 
Baseline data 
The baseline demographic characteristics are the following: 
Table 10. 
The median age was 36 years (range 18-78), 76% were men. The number of patients aged above 65 
years was low (4 subjects).

The background regimens were: 
Table 11. 
About 9% of the included population had active hepatitis B or C infection, well balanced between the 
two treatment arms.  
The baseline disease characteristics are:

Dividing the CD4 T-cell count and viral load into different categories revealed the following: 
Figure 6. 
Figure 7. 
The median baseline CD4 T-cell count was around 250 cells/uL. The proportion of subjects with CD4-
cell count ≥ 500 cells/uL was low (4.1% and 6.7%, respectively).  
About  10%  of  the  randomized  population  had  a  CD4  T-cell  count  <50  cells/uL  and  5%  had  a  high 
baseline viral load above 500,000 copies/mL.

The distribution per region was follows: 
Table 13. 
The most notable differences in baseline characteristics between C209 and C215 were differences in 
region of origin (region 1 = western countries 55-60% versus 45-50%), gender (male sex 78-80% 
versus 72-73%) and HIV- 1 subtype (clade B ≈71% versus ≈68%).  
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary objective was to establish non-inferiority in efficacy of rilpivirine vs. control with regard to 
the proportion of subjects achieving a confirmed viral load of < 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks of treatment, 
according to the TLOVR algorithm, with a maximum allowable difference of 12%. 
The proportion of subjects demonstrating virologic response was as follows: 
ITT population:

Figure 8. 
Figure 9. 
The proportion of subjects that achieved a viral load < 50 copies/mL according to the TLOVR algorithm 
at Week 48 was similar between the rilpivirine group (84.3%) and the control group (82.3%). 
Statistical  comparison  using  a  logistic  regression  model  showed  a  predicted  difference  [95%  CI]  in 
virologic response (viral load < 50 copies/mL, TLOVR) at Week 48 between the pooled rilpivirine and 
control treatment groups of 1.6 [-2.2; 5.3] (p-value < 0.0001), demonstrating non-inferiority at both 
the 12% (primary endpoint) and 10% (secondary endpoint) margins. 
Superiority  of  rilpivirine  compared  to  control  was  not  established.  In  both  trials  C209  and  C215 
individually, there was no notable difference in response rate (< 50 copies/mL, TLOVR, ITT population) 
between the rilpivirine group and the control group (82.9% vs 82.8% in C209, and 85.6% vs 81.7% in 
C215,  see  Figure  8)  and  the  primary  endpoint  of  non-inferiority  at  the  12%  margin  was  met  in  each 
trial independently. Based on the ITT and PP population, non-inferiority was also demonstrated at the 
10% margin in both trials.

The proportion of virologic responders seen in the control group in the Phase III trials was greater than 
or comparable to that seen for the same EFV-based combination ARTs in previous trials. In light of this 
and  the  non-inferiority  of  rilpivirine  to  control  established  in  the  Phase  III  trials,  the  efficacy  of 
rilpivirine  in  respect  of  the  proportion  of  virologic  responders  can  be  considered  comparable  to 
efavirenz. 
With respect to differences in response rates, the logistic regression model shown in the above figure 
was not adjusted for age, sex, CDC class category, HIV clade or baseline CD4 T-cell count. 
The  percentages  of  patients  with  treatment  failure  were  similar  between  rilpivirine  and  EFV  (13%  vs 
9%) but the reasons were different; for rilpivirine this predominantly was virological failure and for EFV 
adverse events (see table 14).

Both treatment groups showed a reconstitution of absolute and relative (%) CD4+ cell count at Week 
48.  The  mean  change  from  baseline  in  imputed  absolute  CD4+  cell  count  at  Week  48  was  192.1 
cells/μL; 95% CI [181.30;202.94] in the rilpivirine group and 176.2 cells/μL; 95% CI [164.63;187.76] 
in the control group.  
Subgroup analysis revealed that the efficacy of rilpivirine was comparable to EFV across gender, race, 
region of origin, HIV clade and background regimen.  
However,  though  the  subgroups  were  small,  there  was  a  trend  towards  lower  virological  efficacy  of 
rilpivirine compared to EFV for subjects with high viral load (>500.000 copies/mL; 70% vs 76%) and 
low CD4 T-cell count (< 50 cells/uL; 59% vs 81%) (see table 15).

The different backbones used were highly associated with region. Hence, comparing outcomes between 
for example zidovudine and tenofovir subsets will also include such large differences (social structures, 
adherence  etc).  However,  within  NRTI  subsets  (stratification  factor)  it  seems  reasonable  to  make 
comparisons, see table 16 below.

Outcomes in the tenofovir subsets of patients are of particular importance since this is by far the most 
commonly used first line NRTI backbone in EU. As seen above, the incidence of virological failure was 
more than twice as common with rilpivirine as with control in the tenofovir subset of patients but not 
for  the  other  NRTI  subsets.  However,  numbers  are  low  in  the  non-tdf  subsets,  and  should  be 
interpreted cautiously. 
The failure rate was driven by patients with a high baseline viral load as seen in the table 17 below.

These data show that efficacy was high for rilpivirine-treated patients with baseline VL<100,000 
copies/ml, but considerably lower in patients with baseline VL ≥ 100,000 copies/ml regardless of NRTI 
backbone used.  As a consequence of suboptimal virologic response when baseline viral load is high, 
the number of patients ending up with resistance is much higher for the rilpivirine-treated patients 
compared to the control group (discussed in the next section). Outcomes in patients with baseline viral 
load <100,000 copies/ml are comparable to that of the control group.

Failure and Resistance development  
Regardless  of  failure  population  looked  at  (those  with  protocol  defined  virological  failure,  and 
successfully  paried  genotypes  -  as  well  as  the  broader  population  of  all  patients  with  a  viral  load 
possible to genotype at time of failure), the absolute number of patients ending up with resistance was 
considerably higher for those treated with rilpivirine (2-3 fold higher for NNRTI-resistance, 3-4 for NRTI 
resistance), table 18 below.  
The table below shows the number of patients ending up with resistance by baseline viral load category 
for the overall population and the TDF subset.

NRTI  RAM 
NNRTI  RAM 
The emerging NRTI RAMs are in the vast majority of cases resistance to cytidine analogues 
(emtricitabine/lamivudine). These drugs are important for the patient, with a low toxicity. 
Subsequently to selecting for a M184V/I mutation (i.e. resistance to FTC and 3TC), there will not be 
any obvious non-toxic dual NRTI backbone. Thus, 3TC/FTC resistance has more consequences as 
regards future therapy than just those related to cytidine analogue activity. 
The emerging NNRTI RAMs in patients failing with rilpivirine were associated with cross-resistance to 
all other NNRTIs (efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine). In contrast, those failing efavirenz therapy and 
with emerging NNRTI RAMs would generally still be able to use etravirine. 
It  is  of  interest  comparing  resistance  outcomes  in  studies  C209/C215  with  those  of  studies  for  other 
first  line  agents.  The  amount  of  resistance  seen  in  patients  treated  with  rilpivirine  (in  this  example 
always combination with tenofovir/FTC) is high also in such a comparison, see table 19 below.

CHMP’s  table:  figures  from  ongoing  report,  Lancet  2009,  and  Reyataz  AR  respectively.  “Virological  failure”  not 
necessarily standardized between studies. 
Post-hoc analyses showed that the following factors increased chance of virologic response (in 
decreasing order of importance): 1. higher adherence, 2. higher rilpivirine exposure (C0h), 3. lower 
baseline viral load, 4. lower fold change in EC 50 (FC) for rilpivirine at baseline, and higher baseline 
CD4+ cell count.  
Analyses of risk of virological failure and emerging resistance stratified by adherence indicate that risk 
of virologic failure was about twice as high in patients with less perfect adherence in both treatment 
arms. Still, risk of virologic failure in patients on rilpivirine with optimal adherence was higher than that 
in patients on efavirenz with low adherence, confirming that rilpivirine is indeed not a “forgiving agent” 
and adherence needs to be high. 
In conclusion, the data  indicate that, compared to EFV,  rilpivirine is associated with a 2-fold higher 
risk to develop NNRTI RAMs (10.5*64% = 6% absolute risk versus 5.7*54% = 3%) and a 3 to 4-fold 
higher risk to develop resistance to N(t)RTIs (10.5*63% = 6.6% absolute risk versus 5.7*32% = 
1.8%). Additional analyses stratified for baseline viral load confirm that this increased risk of emerging 
resistance is driven by patients with high baseline viral load which show lower virologic response rates 
and higher rates of virologic failure compared to control. For patients with baseline viral load <100,000 
copies/ml TCM278 shows comparable efficacy to EVF with low risk of emerging resistance and in the 
same order of magnitude as observed for EFV. Furthermore, in case of rilpivirine resistance, second 
line therapy with etravirine is no option due to cross-resistance whereas etravirine is still efficacious in 
case of EFV resistance.

Table 20: Summary of Efficacy for trial TMC278-TiDP6-C209(ECHO study)  
Title:  A Phase III, randomized, double-blind trial of rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. versus efavirenz 600 mg 
q.d. in combination with a fixed background regimen consisting of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
and emtricitabine in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects. 
Study identifier 
rilpivirine-TiDP6-C209  
Design 
rilpivirine-TiDP6-C209 is an ongoing, 96-week, randomized, double-blind, double 
dummy, active-controlled, international Phase III trial in human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infected, treatment-naïve adult subjects. The 
trial was designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. compared with efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg q.d. (control), each 
in combination with a background regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC).  
Adult subjects with an HIV-1 viral load of ≥ 5,000 HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
copies/mL, who were treatment-naïve, susceptible to their background regimen 
at screening, and had no non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) 
resistance associated mutations (RAMs) in their screening genotype, were 
eligible for the trial. 
Approximately 680 HIV-1 infected subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio 
to rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. or to EFV 600 mg q.d. The trial was designed to consist 
of a maximum screening period of 6 weeks, a 96-week treatment period, a post 
96-week treatment period (until all subjects in the trial who had not discontinued 
earlier had been treated for at least 96 weeks and the Week 96 database had 
been locked), followed by a 4-week follow-up period.

Design 
TMC278-TiDP6-C215 is an ongoing 96-week, randomized, double-blind, double-
dummy, active-controlled, international Phase III trial in human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infected, treatment-naïve adult subjects. The 
trial was designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. compared with efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg q.d. (control). Each 
of these non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was given in 
combination with a background regimen containing two nucleoside/nucleotide 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs). The investigator-selected N(t)RTIs 
were either abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC), zidovudine (AZT)/3TC, or tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC).  
Adult subjects with an HIV-1 viral load of ≥ 5000 HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
copies/mL, who were treatment-naïve, susceptible to their background regimen 
at screening, and had no NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) in their 
screening genotype, were eligible for the trial. Approximately 680 HIV-1 infected 
subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. or to EFV 
600 mg q.d. after the investigator had selected the N(t)RTI background regimen.  
The trial was designed to consist of a maximum screening period of 6 weeks, a 
96 week treatment period, a post 96-week treatment period (until all subjects in 
the trial who had not discontinued earlier had been treated for at least 96 weeks 
and the Week 96 database had been locked), followed by a 4-week follow-up

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The applicant has performed one phase IIb study and two phase III studies.  
The phase IIb study was a dose-finding study.  
Based on this study, initially a 75 mg q.d. dosage was chosen  for further development  as the 25 mg 
q.d.  formulation  was  associated  with  lower  exposure  and  a  trend  towards  lower  efficacy  especially 
among subjects with high baseline viral load. However, a dose-relationship could not be demonstrated. 
Later, when additional safety data became available suggesting a dose-safety relationship, the 25 mg 
q.d was selected for further evaluation in clinical studies.  
The  two  pivotal  phase  III  (C209  and  C215)  studies  are  ongoing  randomized,  double-blind,  double-
dummy, trials of rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. versus EFV 600 mg q.d. in combination with a fixed background 
regimen in ARV treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects. The efficacy of rilpivirine for the treatment of 
HIV-1  infection  in  ARV  treatment-naïve  adult  patients  is  based  on  efficacy  data  of  the  Week  48 
analysis. The results of the Week 96 analysis are expected by 1Q2012. 
The chosen treatments are appropriate and EFV is the preferred NNRTI in first-line ARV regimens. Both 
trials do reflect daily clinical practice of a general relatively healthy population of HIV-1 individuals with 
an  indication  to  start  ARV  according  to  accepted  HIV  treatment  guidelines.  The  design  of  the  studies 
are similar and in accordance with the CHMP guideline (EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02/Rev.1) for marketing 
authorisation application. 
With  respect  to  generalisability  of  the  trial  finding,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  studied  population 
consisted of ARV-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects, who had no NNRTI associated resistance mutations at 
baseline.However, few of these subjects had AIDS-defining or clinically significant coexisting illness, or 
CD4 T-cell counts below 50 cells/μl. Therefore, the results can not be extrapolated to individuals with 
significant comorbidities. The median age was 36 years (range 18-78), 76% were male and 95% had a 
CDC category A or B stage of HIV infection.

CHMP assessment report

Only a minority of subjects did use ABC/3TC as their background regimen (n = 35 rilpivirine versus n = 
33 Control) or AZT/3TC (n = 101 rilpivirine versus n = 103 Control). The results obtained rather 
showed a better outcome with these agents, than with tenofovir/FTC. Hence, although numbers are 
low, there is no reason to believe that these NRTI backbones should be avoided in combination with 
rilpivirine. Patents with non-B subtypes were well represented in comparison to trials done with other 
agents. The applicant was recommended to follow up on this issue and to submit the experiments 
planned for assessing outcomes with rilpivirine in combination with zidovudine and abacavir.  
With respect to selection bias, the most relevant issue is the baseline screening for potential resistance 
as  this  might  not  be  a  routine  screening  tool  across  all  countries.  However,  according  to  European 
treatment guidelines, resistance testing is always recommended prior to starting HIV therapy. 
Up to 10% of the screened population indeed had NNRTI-associated mutations, which could lower the 
effect  of  rilpivirine  -  although  it  is  unclear  to  what  extent  those  mutations  actually  would  lead  to 
treatment  failure.  About  3.3%  of  the  patients  would  have  been  excluded  based  on  the  currently 
selected list of mutations, the way these actually affect outcome is not known. Use of therapy should 
be  guided  by  resistance  testing  which  is  considered  current  good  clinical  practice  and  addressed  in 
section 4.1 of the SmPC. 
The  baseline  demographic  and  disease  characteristics  are  well  balanced  between  the  two  treatment 
arms.  The  vast  majority  of  subjects  were  male,  originated  in  western  countries,  infected  with  HIV-1 
clade B, using TDF/TFC as the background regimen, had CD-4 T-cell counts > 50/mm3 and viral load < 
500.000 copies/mL.  
The differences in baseline data of the two studies are considered minor and allow the performance of 
a pooled analysis.  
The median age was 36 years (range 18-78 years). The number of patients aged above 65 years was 
low  (4  subjects).  A  caution  statement  for  elderly  patients  was  included  in  section  4.2  and  5.2  of  the 
SmPC. 
In  total  686  patients  were  randomized  to  rilpivirine  and  682  to  EFV.  The  primary  endpoint  was  the 
proportion  of  patients  with  viral  loads  <50  copies/mL  at  48  weeks  in  an  ITT,  TLOVR  analysis.  Both 
groups had high rates of success at 48 weeks; 84.3% in the rilpivirine group versus 82.3% in the EFV 
group  meeting  the  non-inferiority  objective.  The  per  protocol  analysis  showed  similar  results.  The 
difference in response rate (rilpivirine versus EFV) was minus 0.4 (95% CI: minus 5.9 – 5.2) and 3.5 
(95% CI: minus 1.7 – 8.8) for the C209 and C215 trial respectively; both meeting the margins of non-
inferiority.  
The selected non-inferiority margin of 12% difference was chosen according to the FDA guideline while 
10% was recommended in a previous Scientific Advice. The observed CI is acceptable as it meets also 
the CHMP requested 10% delta value. 
The obtained response rates are comparable to previous trials with EFV used for first line ARV.  
Subgroup  analysis  demonstrated  that  rilpivirine  seems  to  be  less  efficacious  in  subjects  with  high 
baseline  viral  load  or  low  CD4  T-cell  count.  For  subjects  with  a  viral  load  >  100.000  -  ≤  500.000 
copies/mL the virologic response at week 48 was 79.5% vs 82.6% and for subjects with a viral load > 
500.000  copies/mL  this  was  69.6%  vs  75.6%  (n  =  69  vs  n  =  89)  for  TMC78  and  EFV  recipients 
respectively.  For  subjects  with  CD4+  T-cells  <50  cells/uL  (n  =  34  versus  n  =  36)  the  response  rate 
was  58.8%  vs  80.6%.  Definite  conclusions  of  inferiority  of  rilpivirine  for  these  subgroups  can  not  be 
made  due  to  limited  sample  size  but  the  possible  lower  efficacy  is  of  concern.  There  were  no 
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 61/90
 
 
 
 
 
differences in efficacy across subgroups with respect to gender, age, region, HIV clade or background 
regimen.  
In addition to this it is of special interest to know the virological efficacy among the different strata of 
adherence as non-adherence is associated with virological failure. Post-hoc analyses showed that 
virologic response rates were about 20% lower in patients with less perfect adherence compared to 
patients with optimal adherence whereas the proportion of virologic failures roughly doubled in this 
group for both treatment arms. However, since there appears to be an efficacy problem per se with 
rilpivirine, the risk for virological failure was actually lower with efavirenz taken with low adherence, 
than with rilpivirine taken with optimal adherence. Therefore, rilpivirine appears not to be a “forgiving 
agent” and adherence needs to be very high. 
The rilpivirine group had a lower rate of discontinuation due to AEs (2% versus 7%), but the EFV group 
had  a  lower  rate  of  virological  failure  (10.5%  versus  5.7%,  4.7%  versus  1.8%  leading  to 
discontinuation).  Among  the  subjects  with  virological  failure,  NNRTI  resistance  mutations  emerged  in 
63%  of  the  rilpivirine  recipients  (most  commonly  E138K  leading  to  cross-resistance  to  etravirine) 
versus  54%  of  the  EFV  recipients  (most  commonly  K103N)  and  resistance  to  NRTIs  emerged  in  68% 
versus 32%, respectively.  
Thus,  rilpivirine  is  associated  with  a  two-fold  higher  absolute  risk  than  EFV  for  the  development  of 
resistance  associated  mutations  and,  moreover,  in  case  of  emergent  resistance  mutations  the  clinical 
impact is greater leaving fewer alternatives for sensitive second line ARVs.  
Post-hoc multivariate analyses showed that the following factors increase chance of virologic response 
(in decreasing order of importance): 1. higher adherence, 2. higher rilpivirine exposure (C0h), 3. lower 
baseline viral load, 4. lower fold change in EC 50 (FC) for rilpivirine at baseline, and higher baseline 
CD4+ cell count. From a labelling point of view, baseline viral load and CD4 count are the only 
parameters that can be affected. rilpivirine is approvable provided the indication is restricted to 
patients with low baseline viral load ≤ 100,000 copies/ml. Although response rate appears lower in 
patients with low baseline viral load and CD4 count < 50 cells/μl, numbers are too low to draw 
conclusions on the impact of low CD4 count. 
The 25 mg dose appeared suboptimal in terms of efficacy (lower virologic response) for the population 
in general. Whereas there appeared no dose-relationship in terms of virologic response (phase 2b), 
lower AUC tended towards a lower response within the phase 3 studies using population PK. Hence, the 
exposure achieved with the 25 mg dose is just at the edge, or slightly below the Emax of RPV - which 
gives efficacy problems mainly in patients with a high baseline viral load. The applicant does not have 
the intention to continue to develop the 50 mg dose due to the safety concerns. 
Any concomitant drugs that would lower the rilpivirine exposure, as well as intake in fasted state, is 
likely related to a risk of lower efficacy, and the development of resistance. It is crucial that the need 
for correct intake (fed state) and the risk associated with certain interacting drugs is emphasized in the 
SmPC (contraindication). However, the latter restrictions might be difficult to handle in clinical and 
daily practice, with the potential risk of lower virologic response and emergence of resistance. The 
applicant was requested to perform a drug utilisation study to evaluate how the drug is used in clinical 
practice (see corresponding measure in the RMP) to be followed up in the PSURs. 
It remains to be seen whether an increased dose of this order would make a substantial difference in 
the numbers of virological failure in those patients with a high baseline viral load; although the low 
potency of rilpivirine might be the main obstacle with regards the risk of resistance development (1.2 
log10 reduction in monotherapy, regardless of dose used).

In clinical practice rilpivirine might be considered a potential option for switch once viral load has been 
broken with more potent drugs, especially for patients who do not tolerate efavirenz. Although the 
drug might be an effective option, there is currently no data available in support of such use. Such use 
should be monitored in clinical practice and new studies on use in patients switching from other 
therapies to RPV  (See corresponding measures in the RMP). In addition to this, the applicant will 
perform a drug interaction study with efavirenz and 50 mg rilpivirine dose as metabolic induction by 
efavirenz holds for quite some time (See corresponding measures in the RMP). This study is aimed to 
investigate the concerns that further lowering exposure of the 25 mg dose rilpivirine might increase 
the risk of virological failure.  
Furthermore, the available limited data upon individuals with high viral load, do suggest that rilpivirine 
is less virological efficacious than EFV. Together with the previous noted higher risk for development of 
resistance special caution should be warranted for rilpivirine use in such individuals. The concern that 
rilpivirine is less virological efficacious than EFV in patients with high viral load was further confirmed 
by  the  post-hoc  analyses  stratified  for  baseline  viral  load.  Overall  the  lower  virologic  response,  the 
higher number of patients with virologic failure and the 3 times increased risk of emerging resistance 
compared  with  EFV,  precludes  use  of  rilpivirine  in  the  patient  population  with  baseline  viral  load 
>100,000 copies/ml).  
The  impact  of  the  above  addressed  concerns  will  likely  become  clearer  once  the  96-weeks  become 
available  (see  corresponding  sections of  the  RMP).  Thus  these  96-week  data  are  required  for  definite 
assessment of the benefits and risks.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on two pivotal phase III studies, it can be concluded that rilpivirine is non-inferior to the golden 
standard comparator EFV for treatment of ARV-naïve HIV-1 infected individuals.  
However, to generalise the conclusion to subjects with baseline low CD4 counts and high viral load is 
disputable.  Furthermore,  the  higher  rate  of  virological  failure  and  the  development  of  resistance 
associated  mutations  is  a  major  concern,  especially  as  this  hampers  available  second  line  treatment 
options.  
Post-hoc  analyses  confirmed  that  the  observed  increased  risk  of  emerging  resistance  with  TCM278  is 
driven by patients with high baseline viral load; these patients show lower virologic response rates and 
higher  rates  of  virologic  failure  compared  to  EFV.  On  the  other  hand,  for  patients  with  baseline  viral 
load  ≤100,000  copies/ml  TCM278  shows  comparable  efficacy  to  EVF  with  low  risk  of  emerging 
resistance and in the same order of magnitude as observed for EFV. Therefore, rilpivirine is approvable 
for a restricted indication to patients with low baseline viral load ≤100,000 copies/ml. Interaction with 
drugs that could lower TCM278 exposure should be contraindicated as this might lead to a potentially 
lower  response  and  increased  risk  of  resistance  with  a  possible  loss  of  treatment  options  and  the 
product must be taken with a meal.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary in the risk management plan to address issues 
related to efficacy:

-To submit the results of the ongoing switch studies GS-US-264-011 by 1Q 2013 and GS-US-264-0106 
by 4Q 2012 
Additionally the CHMP recommended the applicant to submit the experiments planned for assessing 
outcomes with rilpivirine in combination with zidovudine and abacavir (to be compared to the results in 
the Gilead PC-264-2003 study).  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
There  were  6  trials  in  HIV-1  infected  subjects.  1  phase  I,  2  phase  IIa  trials,  1  phase  IIb  trial  and  2 
phase  III  trials.  All  studies  except  study  phase  I  and  phase  IIa  C202  were  conducted  in  treatment 
naïve HIV-1 infected subjects. In total 1052 HIV-infected subjects of which 1001 treatment naïve HIV-
1 infected subjects were exposed to rilpivirine. In addition 660 non-HIV infected subjects were exposed 
to rilpivirine in phase I studies.  
The number of treatment naive HIV-1 infected subjects treated with at least 25 mg rilpivirine is 1001, 
611  of  these  subjects  were  included  in  the  phase  III  studies.  This  number  is  sufficient  to  explore 
adverse events which occur with a frequency of approximately 1%. The proposed dose of 25 mg q.d. 
was given in the phase III studies. The Phase IIb  study was a dose-finding study with 25, 75 or 150 
mg  rilpivirine  q.d.  More  than  84%  of  the  subjects  from  the  phase  IIb  and  phase  III  studies  were 
treated  for  at  least  48  weeks.  This  is  in  line  with HIV  guideline  that  safety  data  of  at  least  48  weeks 
treatment should be submitted.  
The  safety  assessment  is  based  on  pooled  data  from  1,368  patients  in  the  Phase  III  controlled  trials 
TMC278  C209  (ECHO)  and  TMC278  C215  (THRIVE)  in  antiretroviral  treatment  naïve  HIV  1  infected 
adult patients, 686 of whom received rilpivirine 25 mg once daily. The median duration of exposure for 
patients in the rilpivirine arm and efavirenz arm was 55.7 and 55.6 weeks, respectively. 
Based  on  non-clinical  and  early  clinical  findings  QTc  interval  and  adrenal  function  effects  were  given 
particular attention in clinical trials. In addition special attention was given to skin events, neurologic 
events, psychiatric events and hepatic event. 
Adverse events  
Phase I 
Overall,  rilpivirine  appeared  to  be  generally  safe  and  well  tolerated.  The  main  finding  in  the  phase  I 
studies was the dose-dependent increase in QTcF interval observed in study C131 at doses of 75 mg 
q.d. and 300 mg q.d. This finding led to the selection of the 25 mg q.d. for further development. 
Phase III 
Based upon the week 48 analyses of the pooled phase III studies any treatment related adverse event 
occurred  less  frequent  in  the  rilpivirine  group  compared  to  control  (46.4%  versus  64.1%)  For  any 
treatment AE at least grade 2 this was 15.9% versus 31.1%, indicating that in both groups most of the 
treatment  related  adverse  events  were  mild.  This  difference  was  mainly  driven  by  the  differences  in 
treatment related AEs which occurred within the first four weeks of treatment.    
See figure 10 below.

CHMP assessment report  
Page 64/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 10 
At week four the incidence of adverse events in the rilpivirine group is approximately 35%, while it is 
approximately 55% in the control group. When treatment continues the differences become less. 
This picture is seen for all treatment related adverse events but also for the individual adverse events 
like skin events (rash) and neurological events. 
By  SOC,  the  most  observed  treatment-related  AEs  in  the  rilpivirine  group  were  gastrointestinal 
disorders (19.2% on rilpivirine vs 17.7% on control), nervous system disorders (17.2% on rilpivirine vs 
36.7% on control), psychiatric disorders (14.9% vs 22.7%) skin and subcutaneous disorders (7.0% vs 
16.1%). By preferred term, the most frequently reported treatment-related AEs in the rilpivirine group 
were  nausea  (10.1%  vs  11.3%  on  control),  dizziness  (8.0%  vs  26.2%  on  control),  abnormal  dreams 
(6.3% vs 9.4% on control) and headache (6.1% vs 6.2% on control). Dizziness and rash (2.5% versus 
8.9%) occurred significantly more often in the control group (see table 22 below).

Table 22: Adverse Events at Least Possibly Related to rilpivirine/Control in at Least 2% of 
Subjects (by System Organ Class or Preferred Term) in the rilpivirine or Control Group 
(Phase III Week 48 Pooled Analysis) 
With  regard  to  grade  3  or  more  AE,  these  were  observed  in  13.3%  of  the  rilpivirine  group  versus 
18.0% in the control group. The most reported grade 3 or 4 events in the rilpivirine group were AST 
increased  (1.0% vs 1.2% on control), blood amylase increased (1.0% vs 1.0% on control), neutrophil 
count decreased (1.0% vs 1.8% on control) and neutropenia (1.0% vs 1.0% on control).None of these 
AEs were considered at least possibly related to treatment. 
The  overall  AE  profile  was  similar  in  the  Phase  IIb  and  Phase  III  trials,  except  for  grade  3  or  4  AEs 
which were reported more frequently in the Phase IIb trial (25.8% for 25 mg q.d. and 24.7 % for all 
rilpivirine) than in the pooled Phase III trials (13.3%) with rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. 
For the Phase IIb study there were also safety analyses at week 96 and at week 192. 
At week 96 there was no dose relationship in the overall incidence of AEs reported in the 3 rilpivirine 
dose groups. Although there appeared to be a trend towards a higher discontinuation rate due to AEs 
with  increasing  dose,  there  is  no  specific  SOC  or  preferred  term  level  which  contributes  to  this 
phenomenon.  A  dose  trend  was  observed  in  the  incidence  of  the  skin  event  of  interest,  the  grouped 
term  “rash”,  which  increased  in  incidence  with  increasing  rilpivirine  dose  (5.4%,  9.5%  and  13.2% 
versus 21.3% for control).

Adverse events of special interest 
Effects on QTc 
In phase I studies the dose-dependent increase in QTcF interval observed in study C131 at doses of 75 
mg q.d. and 300 mg q.d led to the selection of the 25 mg q.d. for further development. 
In  phase  II  studies  at  week  192  the  main  observation  was  that  following  the  gradual  mean  increase 
from  baseline  in  QTcF  up  to  week  48,  this  interval  remained  stable  up  to  week  144,  but  showed  a 
further increase thereafter. 
Mean  increases  in  QTcF  interval  after  Week  96  continued  to  be  more  pronounced  in  subjects  treated 
with AZT/3TC compared with those treated with TDF/FTC, regardless of treatment group (rilpivirine or 
control), with greater increases in QTcF interval observed for females than for males.

Table 23: QTcF interval abnormalities over time (worst case) (Trial C204) 
Overall,  similar  proportions  of  subjects  in  the  combined  rilpivirine  and  control  groups  had  a  QTcF 
interval abnormality, an abnormal increase in QTcF interval during the trial, or an abnormal increase in 
QTcF interval that resulted in an abnormal QTcF value. No pattern was observed at the different time 
points  in  the  number  of  subjects  with  increases  in  QTcF  interval  of  >  60  ms,  and  only  a  small 
proportion  of  subjects  with  an  abnormal  increase  in  QTcF  interval  had  an  abnormal  actual  value. 
Therefore,  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  obtained  QT-prolongation  at  a  dose  of  75  mg  is  currently 
unclear. 
in phase 3 studies the ECG data were included in 5 planned subgroup analyses: by background N(t)RTI 
regimen, by gender, by race, by race-by-gender, and by co-medication with a potential impact on QT 
interval. 
Overall there was an increase over time in the mean QTcF interval in both rilpivirine and control groups. 
The  increase  was  gradual  and  numerically  higher  in  the  control  group.  The  mean  maximum  change 
from  baseline  in  QTcF  interval  in  the  overall  population  was  +17.9  ms  in  the  rilpivirine  group  and 
+19.2 ms in the control group.  
A  summary  of  the  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  ECG  abnormalities  (worst  abnormality)  is 
presented in the table 24 below.

Table 24: Treatment-emergent ECG abnormalities (phase III week 48 pooled analysis) 
There were no clinically relevant differences between the rilpivirine and control groups in the incidence 
of treatment-emergent ECG abnormalities overall. In both treatment groups, the most frequent (in at 
least 2.0% of rilpivirine-treated subjects) treatment-emergent ECG abnormalities were abnormally low 
HR (8.0% with rilpivirine vs 4.7% in the control group), QTcB interval > 450 ms (6.3% vs 9.0%), and 
abnormal  increases  in  QTcF  and  QTcB  interval  (QTcF:  19.8%  vs  20.9%,  QTcB:  27.3%  vs  32.7%). 
Abnormalities in the QRS and PR intervals were infrequent in both treatment groups. 
The QTcF interval increase was lower in the TDF/FTC subgroup than in the AZT/3TC subgroup, with a 
QTcF  interval  increase  at  Week  48  of  +10.6  ms  and  +12.1  ms  in  the  rilpivirine  group  and  +12.1  ms 
and +17.8 ms and in the control group, respectively. No differences were found for gender and race or 
co medication. 
Subjects with pre-existing risk factors for QTc prolongation were excluded in the phase III trials. Post-
hoc analyses showed that about 3% of the screened subjects failed screening for this reason. The most 
frequently  reported  ECG  finding  was  incomplete  right  bundle  branch  block  occurring  in  28  subjects, 
followed  by  complete  right  bundle  branch  block  in  seven  subjects.  Given  the  low  incidence  at 
screening,  the  fact  that  the  most  frequently  observed  ECG  finding  is  of  limited  clinical  relevance  and 
the  fact  that  the  25  mg  dose  was  not  associated  with  QT  interval  prolongation,  there  is  no  need  to 
screen with ECG before starting treatment with rilpivirine.  
Adverse events of special interest for an NNRTI 
Skin  events  (rash),  neurological  events  (headache,  dizziness  and  somnolence)  and  psychiatric  events 
(insomnia,  abnormal  dreams  and  depression)  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  first  four  weeks  of 
treatment with a lower incidence of events in the rilpivirine group compared to control. After the first 
four weeks the incidence decreased but remained somewhat lower for the rilpivirine group compared to 
control.  
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 69/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  incidence  of  hepatic  events  of  interest  was  low  in  the  pooled  Phase  III  trials  (2.2%  out  of  5.5% 
were  considered  treatment  related  in  the  rilpivirine  groups  versus  2.1%  out  of  6.6%  in  the  control 
groups). 
With regard to hepatic events (AST, ALT) incidence seems to be comparable between the two groups; 
also  for  this  kind  of  adverse  events  the  occurrence  is  somewhat  higher  in  the  first  four  weeks  but 
overall low. 
With  regard  to  the  adverse  events  of  special interest,  the  safety  profile  of  rilpivirine  appears  to  be  in 
favour compared to the safety profile of the control (efavirenz). 
Serious adverse event and deaths 
In  total  there  were  9  deaths,  all  were  considered  not  related  to  the  study  medication.  Five  subjects 
died (with 6 AEs leading to death) during the course of the 2 Phase III trials, 1 in the rilpivirine group 
in  trial  C215  and  4  in  the  control  group  (1  in  trial  C209  and  3  in  trial  C215).  Causes  of  death  were 
bronchopneumonia  for  the  subject  on  rilpivirine  and  Burktt’s  lymphoma,  cerebral  toxoplasmosis  and 
respiratory  failure,  dysentery,  cerebrovascular  accident  for  the  4  subjects  in  control  group.  In  the 
phase IIb study up to week 192 in total four subjects died. Up to the week 96 analysis of the phase IIb 
study  it  is  described  that  one  subject  died  in  a  car  accident  and  another  died  of  cardio-respiratory 
arrest both  were on rilpivirine 75 mg. After the week 96 analysis two subjects died. One of unknown 
cause, the other died from acute infarction of the intestines following multiple drug intoxication. 
Overall, 45 subjects (6.6%) in the rilpivirine group and 55 subjects (8.1%) in the control group had at 
least  1  SAE  during  the  treatment  period.  The  highest  incidence  of  Seas  was  in  the  SOC  of  infections 
and  infestations  (2.6%  for  rilpivirine  versus  2.5%  versus  control).  The  only  notable  difference  was 
seen in the SOC of hepatobiliary disorders (0.9% on rilpivirine vs 0.1% on control). 
Most  SAEs  were  considered  not  related  to  treatment.  Seven  subjects  (1.0%)  in  the  rilpivirine  group 
and  6  subjects  (0.9%)  in  the  control  group  experienced  at  least  1  treatment-related  SAE.  Thus  no 
difference  between  the  two  groups,  also  psychiatric  disorders  (0.4%  versus  0.3%),  skin  disorders 
(0.1% versus 0.1%) and nervous system disorders (0.1% versus 0.1%) were comparable between the 
two groups.  
Laboratory findings 
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent graded laboratory abnormalities of at least grade 2 
in  the  rilpivirine  group  were  hypophosphatemia  (9.1%),  increased  pancreatic  amylase  (6.1%), 
hyperglycemia  (5.4%),  and  elevated  LDL  cholesterol  (5.5%).  There  were  no  apparent  differences 
between  treatment  groups  in  the  frequency  of  at  least  grade  2  hypophosphatemia,  increased 
pancreatic amylase or hyperglycemia. 
With  regard  to  haemoglobin,  hepatic  parameters  (ALT,  AST)  and  pancreatic  parameters  (amylase, 
lipase) overall the pattern between TMC 278 and control appear comparable. 
Adrenal hormones 
Effects on adrenal glands were seen preclinically in all species except rabbits. This is considered to be 
related to partial inhibition of the CYP21 enzyme - which catalyzes major steps in the aldosterone and 
cortisol pathways, figure below.

Therefore  basal  cortisol,  17-OH-progesterone,  aldosterone, androstenedione,  DHEAS,  progesterone 
and testosterone were monitored in both phase 2b and phase 3. In addition an ACTH stimulation test 
was also performed at baseline, at Week 48, and at unscheduled visits if based on basal cortisol results 
or an abnormal ACTH test.  
In study C204 cortisol levels of ≥ 550 nmol/ at least at one of the 3 time points (i.e., morning cortisol, 
30  or  60  minutes  after  250  μg  ACTH  stimulation)  on  the  screening  assessment  was  an  inclusion 
criterion. However, in phase 3 there were no such restrictions. 
Changes  of  adrenal  hormones  in  the  phase  3  study  (rilpivirine  dosed  25  mg)  were  small,  and  varied 
inconsistently between treatments. In study C204 25mg, 75 mg, 150 mg), there was a tendency for a 
slightly lower cortisol response to ACTH-stimuli in patients with the higher TMC-doses (table 25 below), 
while morning values were not affected. No clinical symptoms related to cortisol deficiency were noted.

No significant changes were seen in levels of androstenedione, progesterone, testosterone and LH. 
Likewise, not symptoms related to impaired levels of these hormones were reported to occur.  
Renal parameters 
In  patients  treated  with  rilpivirine  there  was  an  immediate  increase  of  serum  creatinine  -  causing  a 
decrease in calculated clearance, not seen with the control regimen. In the phase 3 studies (25 mg), 
this decrease in clearance was more pronounced with tenofovir (left) than with zidovudine (right).  
Figure 12. Change in calculated creatine clearance in studies C209 + C215 pooled. 
Left: tenofovir/FTC subset;  right: zidovudine/3TC subset 
In  the  tenofovir  subset  of  patient  in  study  C204  (3  doses  of  rilpivirine),  this  change  in  creatinine 
clearance seen with rilpivirine was, however, not dose dependent (data shown in Clinical report). 
The  immediate  change  in  creatinine  clearance  is  likely  to  be  caused  by  an  inhibition  of  creatinine 
secretion  on  the  tubular  level.  In  contrast,  cystatin  C  is  freely  filtered by  the  glomeruli  without  any 
proximal tubular secretion. Therefore, also cystatin clearance was calculated in study C215 - where the 
different  NRTI  back  bones  made  this  analysis  more  interesting.  Although,  increases  of  cystatin 
clearance was seen from baseline to week 48 for all dose groups (an effect of controlling HIV-infection), 
smaller increases were obtained in rilpivirine-treated patients regardless of NRTI backbone used.  Also 
a lower increase, not only a decrease, could be indicative of a slight renal toxicity.  
Considering the pre-clinical data (kidney target organ) and renal effects seen in patients, it is clear that 
long  term  renal  toxicity  should  be  monitored  also  with  parameters  adequate  for  determining  tubular 
dysfunction.  
It  is  of  particular  interest  to  see  such  data  by  tenofovir  and  non-tenofovir  subsets  for  both  rilpivirine 
and control; as tenofovir per se carries a, dose dependent, risk for that kind of toxicity. It is important 
to  verify  that  rilpivirine  and  tenofovir  given  in  combination,  does  not  give  an  additive/synergistic  risk 
for the tubular toxicity already described for tenofovir, which in turn causes phosphate loss with bone 
loss as perhaps the most important outcome measure. Such data was requested as part of the primary 
LoQ  (urine-protein,  urine-β2-microglobulin  etc).    For  the  issue  of  possible  tubular  toxicity,  DEXA-
scanning  for  bone  mineral  density  (BMD)  is  of  major  interest,  particularly  comparing  the  tenofovir 
subsets of rilpivirine treated vs control, for reasons outlined above.  
To  be  noted,  long  term  bone  safety  with  tenofovir  was  only  shown  for  tenofovir  in  combination  with 
efavirenz - in practice as Atripla, which given in a fasted state. It is therefore a concern that, based on 
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 72/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  data  presented  the  tenofovir  exposure  is  increased  around  50%  compared  to  the  Atripla 
combination, when given with rilpivirine (+25%) and food (+25%) (rilpivirine needs to be taken with 
food). 
The  phase  3  studies  included  an  optional  DEXA  sub  study  looking  at  BMD  progress  from  baseline  to 
weeks 48 and 96.  
The applicant could not provide additional safety data on parameters adequate for monitoring tubular 
injury,  as  these  were  not  collected  during  the  studies.  However,  other  available  data  do  not  point 
toward  tubular  toxicity  with  rilpivirine.  There  was  no  difference  in  bone  parameters  in  the  DEXA 
substudy  for  rilpivirine  and  EFV,  regardless  of  NRTI  backbone.  Also,  rates  of  hypophosphatemia  were 
quite the same between treatment arms.  
Given the fact that tenofovir exposure is highly dependent on renal clearance the effect of rilpivirine on 
renal clearance and creatinine levels should however be reflected in the SmPC, as well that rilpivirine 
was only studied in patients with normal renal function.  
Adverse drug reactions 
The company describes a methodology used to identify Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR). The first step 
was  the  generation  of  a  list  of  preferred  terms  to  be  considered  as  potential  ADRs,  the  second  step 
(review  of  individual  and  multiple  cases)  to  generate  a  draft  ADR  list  and  finally  this  draft  list  was 
discussed  in  a  broader  group  leading  to  the  Final  ADR  list.  In  some  cases,  MedDRA  preferred  terms 
related to a common pathology or symptom were grouped to a single common preferred term. These 
are  called  ‘grouped  terms’  and  were  assigned  to  the  primary  SOC  associated  with  the  preferred  term 
which  corresponds  to  the  term  used  as  an  ADR  grouped  term.  This  methodology  was  considered 
appropriate.  
All ADRs of at least grade 2 identified from the Phase III pooled database are listed in the table 26.

Safety in special populations 
Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C Co-infection 
In  the  Phase  III  pooled  analysis,  approximately  9%  of  subjects  were  reported  to  be  co-infected  with 
hepatitis  B  and/or  C  at  baseline  or  on-treatment.  As  expected,  in  both  treatment  groups,  elevated 
hepatic  parameters  were  observed  at  a  higher  incidence  in  subjects  who  were  co-infected  with 
hepatitis  B  and/or  C  than in  subjects who  were  not co-infected.  The incidence  in  co-infected  subjects 
was comparable in both the rilpivirine and control groups.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Phase III: Overall, 23 subjects (3.4%) in the rilpivirine group and 52 subjects (7.6%) in the control 
group had at least 1 AE leading to discontinuation. Psychiatric disorders (1.5% vs 2.2% on control) 
were the most frequent. rilpivirine-treated subjects who discontinued because of AEs did so later than 
subjects in the control group and this difference was sustained throughout the treatment period. 
Overall the discontinuation rate due to AEs was 2.2% the rilpivirine group versus 7.2% on the control.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
TMC  278  appeared  to  be  generally  safe  and  well  tolerated.    The  most  frequently  reported  treatment-
related AEs in the rilpivirine group were nausea, dizziness, abnormal dreams and headache. Especially 
within  the  first  four  weeks  of  treatment  rilpivirine  the  safety  profile  of  rilpivirine  seemed  in  favor 
compared to control. After the first four weeks the occurrence of adverse events decreased but there 
remained somewhat difference in safety profile in favor of TMC although to a lesser extend. 
With regards to AEs frequently discussed for approved NNRTIs Neurological AEs often experienced 
during the first weeks of treatment for the preferred NNRTI efavirenz (control), was less frequently 
seen with rilpivirine. Psychiatric AEs, often discussed as a problem with efavirenz, were rather 
uncommon for both regimens; anxiety and abnormal dreams were somewhat more common with 
control, while depression was slightly more frequently reported in rilpivirine treated patients.  Rash, 
commonly seen with efavirenz (but only causing 1 patient from each treatment arm to permanently 
stop therapy in phase 3), was less frequent with rilpivirine. However, dermatitis/eczema appearing 
later during treatment was more common. Lipid parameters are not significantly affected by rilpivirine. 
Hepatic events were uncommon and mild for both treatments, Three subjects had grade 4 hepatic 
events while on rilpivirine, none of which were reported as SAEs. Those 3 patients all had hepatitis co-
infection.

Renal function was lowered with rilpivirine compared to control, regardless if using creatinine (lowered 
from baseline value) or cystatin C (somewhat less improvement from baseline vs control) as the 
parameter used to calculate GFR. This did not seem to be dose related when looking at the phase 2 b 
study (cystatin C data only presented for the 25 mg dose). Since kidney was a target organ in rats and 
dogs, primarily with tubular toxicity the company was asked to provide safety data on parameters 
adequate for tubular injury. This is particularly important having in mind that rilpivirine is used in 
combination with tenofovir; an agent with well known risk for tubular toxicity. Post-hoc analyses 
provided did not point toward tubular toxicity with rilpivirine. There was no difference in bone 
parameters in the DEXA substudy for rilpivirine and EFV, regardless of NRTI backbone, and rates of 
hypophosphatemia were similar between treatment arms. These data are therefore reassuring. The 
effect of rilpivirine on renal clearance and creatinine levels is reflected in sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC, as well as that rilpivirine was only studied in patients with normal renal function.  
Due to QT results, during the phase 2b study, the dose for further development was lowered from 75 
mg q.d. to 25 mg q.d.. The clinical relevance of the QT-prolongation seen with 75 mg is currently not 
clear. Long term safety in this regard is of interest. Although the 25 mg q.d. does not show QT 
prolongation, a warning was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC that QT prolongation was observed at 
doses of 75 mg q.d. 
Inhibition of adrenal hormone-axis does not seem to be a relevant issue for rilpivirine dosed 25 mg 
q.d. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. The safety conclusions are further discussed in the context of the overall benefit-
risk balance.

Drug utilisation study (DUS) 
The Applicant provided a protocol for a drug utilisation study (DUS) implicating the use of the already 
existing European HIV cohorts: Observational Cohort Study Including a Nested Case-Control Study to 
Assess Rilpivirine (RPV) Utilization According to the SmPC. 
The  development  of  resistance  and  the  utilization  of  RPV-containing  products  according  to  the 
products’  SmPC  will  be  assessed  through  a  drug  utilization  study  (DUS)  conducted  in  existing  HIV 
observational cohorts within Europe. Additionally, the DUS will provide context to the observed rates of 
virologic failure and development of resistance for patients initiating RPV treatment by describing the 
treatment  outcomes  of  patients  initiating  efavirenz  (EFV).  The  relative  risk  of  virologic  failure  and 
resistant-associated  mutations  (RAMs)  after  initiating  RPV-containing  regimens  will  be  estimated 
separately by comparing the incidence rates of virologic failure and RAMs among RPV-treated patients 
to  the  incidence  of  virologic  failure  and  RAMs  among  EFV-treated  patients.  For  all  study  objectives, 
frequency and rates will be reported for the RPV and EFV-treated groups separately, as well as for RPV 
relative to EFV.  
A  minimum  of  600  HIV-positive  patients  are  to  be  included.  Additionally,  a  comparator  cohort  of  a 
minimum of 600 EFV-treated patients will be included.   
A  nested  case-control  study  will  be  conducted  to  assess  the  effects  of  ARV  treatment  adherence  and 
pill intake with food on the risk of virologic failure with RPV will be assessed. 
Primary objectives include: to describe the proportion of patients treated with RPV in accordance with 
the  SmPC,  to  describe  treatment  emergent  RAMs  in  patients  treated  with  RPV  or  EFV-containing 
regimens and to describe virologic failure in patients treated with RPV or EFV-containing regimens. 
The final protocol of the DUS study, including the nested case control study protocol, is agreed by the 
CHMP. The Applicant should report on this study as well in the PSURs and the RMP updates. 
USA cohort study in women 
In the USA a cohort study in women will be conducted, which will provide additional data on the use of 
rilpivirine-containing regimens for treatment of HIV-infected women, in everyday clinical practice. The 
primary objective of this cohort study is to characterize the population and treatment outcomes of 
ARV-naïve women (including switches) in routine clinical practice initiating rilpivirine-containing 
regimens. The Applicant has submitted the protocol of this study. The Applicant should report on this 
study as well in the PSURs and the RMP updates.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
In European Union, Rilpivirine is the fourth representative of the Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase 
Inhibitor (NNRTI) after nevirapine, efavirenz (EFV) and etravirine. The applicant applied for the 
indication in treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-naïve adults. As such, 
according to current HIV treatment guidelines, it could be considered an alternative to EFV as the first 
choice NNRTI agent in first line ARV regimens.  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The beneficial virological effects of RPV is clearly demonstrated in two pivotal phase III randomized 
trials, comparing RPV to EFV, both in combination with 2 NRTIs,  in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected 
adults. NRTI backbones used were tenofovir/FTC (major part), abacavir/lamivudine or 
zidovudine/lamuvidine.  Both studies demonstrated non-inferiority of RPV to EFV; at 48 weeks follow-
up, the overall response rate (< 50 copies/mL) for pooled results was 84% and 82% for RPV and EFV 
respectively. Such response rates are similar to previous studies with EFV.  
RPV has a favourable tolerability profile compared to EFV, as relatively common skin disorders and 
neuro-psychiatric side effects were reported less frequently. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The beneficial effects in individuals with high baseline viral load (and low CD4 T-cell counts, often 
associated with high viral loads) are questionable.  Post-hoc analyses stratified for baseline viral load 
(≤100,000 versus >100,000 copies/ml) for the overall population and the tenofovir/emtricitabine 
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 82/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subset confirmed the trend towards lower efficacy in patients with high baseline viral load (77% with 
TCM278 versus 81% with EFV) whereas efficacy was comparable (numerically higher) for patients with 
baseline viral load ≤100,000 copies/ml (90% versus 84%). Although response rate appears lower in 
patients with CD4 count < 50 cells/μl, numbers are too low to draw conclusions on the impact of low 
CD4 count per se.   
In phase 2b three doses of RPV were tested:  25 mg, 75 mg and 150 mg. There was not an obvious 
difference in overall efficacy between doses, although a trend for higher incidence of virological failure 
with the lowest dose was noted. Due to concerns of QT-effects with the higher doses in a thorough QT 
study, the lowest dose was chosen for phase 3. Within phase 3, using the 25 mg dose, outcomes were 
associated to RPV exposure (using population PK data); the response rate was significantly lower for 
RPV patients belonging to AUC quartile 1 compared to AUC quartile 3. Hence, the exposure achieved 
with the 25 mg dose is just at the edge , or slightly below the Emax of RPV - which gives efficacy 
problems mainly in patients with a high baseline viral load, but less so in patients with lower viral 
loads.  Hence, any concomitant drugs that would lower the RPV exposure, as well as intake an intake 
in fasted state, is likely related to a risk of lower efficacy, and the development of resistance. It is 
uncertain whether these issues will be handled as carefully in clinical practice as within a well 
controlled trial. It is crucial that the need for correct intake (fed state) and the risk associated with 
certain interacting drugs is emphasized in the SmPC. However, the later restrictions might be difficult 
to handle in clinical and daily practice, with the potential risk of lower virologic response and 
emergence of resistance. Whether restrictions like low baseline viral load and dosing instructions can 
be met in daily clinical practice or that the somewhat suboptimal dose is more fragile here than within 
clinical trials, needs to be confirmed by the drug utilisation study and subsequent PSURs. 
It remains to be seen whether an increased dose of this order would make a substantial difference in 
the numbers of virological failure in those patients with a high baseline viral load. The rather low 
potency of rilpivirine might be the main obstacle with regards the risk of resistance development (1.2 
log10 reduction in monotherapy, regardless of dose used). 
In clinical practice rilpivirine might be considered a potential option for switch once viral load has been 
broken with more potent drugs. Although the drug might be an effective option, there is currently no 
data available in support of such use. The applicant will monitor such use in clinical practice and 
studies are ongoing in patients switching from other therapies to RPV. In addition to this, the applicant 
is requested to perform a drug interaction study with efavirenz and 50 mg rilpivirine dose as metabolic 
induction by efavirenz holds for quite some time. Further lowering exposure of the 25 mg dose 
rilpivirine might increase the risk of virological failure.  
Patients with a number of baseline HIV resistance associated mutations, an estimated glomerular 
filtration rate < 50 ml/min, AIDS defining illness or any significant co-existing illness were excluded 
from the phase III trials.  
The number of HIV patients aged over 65 years treated with RPV is too low to draw any conclusions for 
this subgroup. However, based on the mechanism of action there is no reason to expect a less 
beneficial effect of RPV among the elderly or those with co morbidity including renal insufficiency.  
There are currently no data available from clinical studies with RPV to support the combination of RPV 
with other antiretroviral agents than tenofovir/emtricitabine, abacavir/lamivudine or 
zidovudine/lamivudine.  
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report

Finally, the beneficial effect (non-inferiority of RPV to EFV) has been demonstrated in the phase III 
trials for 48 weeks of follow-up. The 96-weeks data of these trials are expected to become available by 
1Q 2012.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
As with all ARVs, once there is virological failure there is a risk of emerging resistance. The 
extensiveness of this determines the available alternative ARVs left for 2nd line treatment. 
In the pivotal studies there was overall a 2-fold risk for virological failure for RPV-treated patients 
compared to those treated with for EFV; 10.5% versus 5.7%. About half of the patients with virological 
failure (both with RPV and EFV) developed resistance associated mutations; thus RPV was also 
associated with a 2-fold higher risk to develop resistance. Moreover, RPV resistance was associated 
with cross-resistance to the 2nd line NNRTI (etravirine) whereas in case of resistance to EFV, 
susceptibility to etravirine remained. In addition, patients failing RPV therapy more frequently 
developed resistance to the NRTI backbone (particularly emtricitabine/lamivudine) than did patients 
failing with efavirenz.  
Post-hoc analyses demonstrated that this increased risk of virologic failure was driven by patients with 
high baseline viral load ( i.e >100,000 copies/ml) , 15% with RPV versus 6% with EFV, whereas 
virologic failure rates were comparably low for patients with low baseline viral load, 3.8% versus 3.3%, 
regardless of NRTI backbone used.  Hence, for the high viral load strata, the risk for emerging 
resistance (NNRTI and/or NRTI) was 3-4 times higher for those treated with RPV compared to those 
treated with EFV. In contrast, the number of patients developing resistance was low and similar to that 
seen for efavirenz-treated patients within the low viral load strata.     
The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs in the patients treated with RPV were nausea, 
dizziness, abnormal dreams and headache. These AEs were mild and occurred less frequently with RPV 
than with EFV. 
Tenofovir carries a, dose dependent, risk for renal tubular toxicity which in turn causes phosphate loss 
with  bone  loss  as  perhaps  the  most  important  outcome  measure.  Post-hoc  analyses  of  the  optional 
DEXA sub study within the phase 3 studies showed that there was no difference in bone parameters for 
rilpivirine  and  EFV  at  week  96,  regardless  of  NRTI  backbone.  Also,  rates  of  hypophosphatemia  were 
quite  the  same  between  treatment  arms.  Therefore,  there  are  no  suggestions  for  a  possible 
additive/synergistic risk for tubular toxicity when rilpivirine is given in combination with tenofovir. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
An extensive list of NNRTI-associated mutations (n= 39) constituted exclusion criteria in both phase 2b 
and phase 3 (around 10% of all screening failures).  Many of these NNRTI-associated mutations were 
quite infrequent though, and were neither seen in the in vitro resistance profile of RPV, nor in patients 
failing RPV therapy in the trials. In the final analyses of all data a list of 15 RPV-associated mutations is 
proposed to constitute those baseline mutations precluding RPV therapy in treatment naïve patients.  
This list covers the majority of the population not included in the trials, and the analyses behind it are 
endorsed. The combined frequency of these 15 mutations is high enough in untreated patients to 
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 84/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
request that resistance testing should be done prior to the use of RPV. This is reflected in the 
indication: as with other antiretroviral medicinal products, genotypic resistance testing should guide 
the use of rilpivirine and cross reference is made to the relevant sections 4.4 and 5.1. 
To perform resistance testing prior to the use of RPV is in line with the general recommendation in 
Europe - which implies that a baseline resistance testing should be done prior to starting HIV therapy 
(Vandamme et al, 2011). The other mutations used as exclusion criteria, not included in this list, were 
deselected by the company after final analyses of pre-clinical and clinical data; they were not found to 
affect activity in vitro and were not seen in any significant numbers in those failing RPV. Although they 
were formally not properly studied in vivo, the impact in response rates of the phase 3 studies would 
not have been significantly affected by their presence in the list of exclusion criteria. Future follow-up 
of resistance should be provided according to the proposed pharmacovigilance measures and the 
correctness of associated mutations should be confirmed. 
In a thorough QT-study a somewhat unexpected QTc increase above the threshold (just above 10 ms 
for female subjects) was seen at doses 75 mg or higher. As consequence any risk factor for QT 
prolongation was an exclusion criterion in the phase III trials giving an uncertainty about the safety of 
RPV in individuals with such risk factors. However, no difference in QTc increase was seen for the 75 
mg dose compared to and efavirenz in the phase 2b study (using common 12-lead ECGs). Also no 
significant QTc change was noted in an interaction study with RPV 150 mg qd in combination with 
darunavir/r, which further doubles the exposure. Therefore, the clinical relevance of the QT-
prolongation observed at a dose of 75 mg is currently unclear. 
Furthermore, post-hoc analyses showed a low incidence for patients with risk of QTc prolongation at 
screening to phase 3, and observed risk factors were of limited clinical relevance. Therefore, as the 25 
mg dose was not associated with QTc interval prolongation, no special warnings are required for the 
moment. A warning on QT prolongation with supratherapeutic dose (75 mg and higher) was included in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The applicant could not provide additional safety data on parameters adequate for monitoring tubular 
injury (urine-protein, urine-β2-microglobulin etc), as these were not collected during the studies. 
However, other available data do not point toward tubular toxicity with rilpivirine. Still, given the fact 
that tenofovir exposure is highly dependent on renal clearance the effect of rilpivirine on renal 
clearance and creatinine levels is reflected in sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC, as well that rilpivirine 
was only studied in patients with normal renal function.  
Benefit Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
As the targeted indication is the treatment of HIV-1 infection in ARV-naïve individuals, both tolerability 
and efficacy of the ARV regimen are of high importance; this is the start of a potential life-long 
treatment. In this light, the noted better tolerability of RPV compared to the golden standard EFV, is 
considered of clinical relevance. Also the qd dosage and low pill burden are advantages that can make 
it easier for patients to comply with therapy.  
A prerequisite of the ARV regimen is its virological potency. Any inability to suppress HIV replication is 
considered of clinical concern as this may lead to resistance hampering 2nd line ARV treatment options. 
Virological failure due to resistance should therefore be considered of greater clinical relevance than 
the tolerability of the regimen.  
Edurant 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 85/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, it can be concluded that RPV was non-inferior to the active comparator EFV with respect to the 
most relevant clinical endpoint (<50 copies/mL). The potential extra benefit over EFV relies in a better 
tolerability, all be it predominantly the first four weeks of treatment, and the patients convenience 
having one tablet, once daily as ARV regimen. 
This benefit, together with the non-inferior efficacy, should be balanced against an overall 2-fold higher 
risk of RPV for developing virological failure and emerging resistance of which the latter has greater 
clinical consequences, as resistance to RPV was also more frequently associated with resistance 
development to the backbone NRTIs.  
In the pivotal phase III studies, the overall risk of emergence of resistance appeared to be about 6% 
versus 3% for RPV and EFV, respectively. In further analyses it was shown that, the increased risk of 
emerging resistance with TCM278 is driven by patients with high baseline viral load (>100,000 
copies/ml); these patients show lower virologic response rates and higher rates of virologic failure 
compared to EFV. On the other hand, for patients with baseline viral load ≤100,000 copies/ml TCM278 
showed numerically higher response rate and a low risk of emerging resistance and in the same order 
of magnitude as observed for EFV. It can be expected that the ongoing studies up to 96 weeks will 
confirm the observed comparative efficacy and safety profiles of RPV.  
Based on these arguments the limited benefit of better tolerability does not weigh against the higher 
risk for emerging resistance for treatment naïve patients at large - the risk of failure and its 
consequences are not acceptable for patients with a high baseline viral load, taking into account the 
performance of other available first line options for such patients. Therefore, the CHMP considers that 
the benefits outweigh the risks when RPV is restricted to patients with low baseline viral load.   
Since the 25 mg dose is at the edge of being suboptimal, it is crucial that the exposure is not lowered 
(concomitant drugs, need for intake in fed state); there is always a risk that these issues are handled 
less strict in clinical practice than within a clinical trial, where everything is closely monitored. This risk 
was emphasized in the respective sections of the SmPC. Therapy should be guided by resistance 
testing as it is considered current good clinical practice in line with the general recommendation 
according to updated European treatment guidelines. 
In clinical practice rilpivirine might be considered a potential option for switch once viral load has been 
broken with more potent drugs. Although the drug might be an effective option, there is currently no 
data available in support of such use. The applicant will monitor such use in clinical practice and new 
studies are on going on use in patients switching from other therapies to RPV. 
Discussion on the Benefit Risk Balance 
From an individual patient perspective, the reason for judging an ARV agent to be abandoned from the 
1st line regimen, either intolerability or insufficient virological effect, is not so relevant as long as 
alternate future, 2nd line, options are still available. Rilpivirine presents a higher risk for emerging 
resistance limiting 2nd line options, although nevertheless available 2nd line options in general still 
remain. However, whenever possible, avoidance of emerging resistance is considered more critical 
than tolerability.

The restriction of the indication to patients with low baseline viral load resolves the major concern on 
increased risk of emerging resistance compared to efavirenz. As mentioned above although the 
potential consequences of developing resistance are of greater concern with RPV given the potential 
loss of treatment options, the absolute risk is low and available 2nd line options still remain. Interaction 
with drugs that lower RPV exposure is contraindicated given the potential lower efficacy and 
subsequent emergence of resistance and RPV must be taken in fed state. Within these restrictions, in 
patients with low viral load the risks are outweighted by the benefits of RPV showing a comparable 
high virologic response rate with a better tolerability profile to efavirenz and a favourable once-daily 
dosing regimen.  
4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Edurant “in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, is 
indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) infection in antiretroviral 
treatment naïve adult patients with a viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV 1 RNA copies/ml. This indication is 
based on week 48 safety and efficacy analyses from two randomised, double blind, controlled, Phase 
III trials in treatment naïve patients and week 96 safety and efficacy analyses from a Phase IIb trial in 
treatment naïve patients (see section 5.1). As with other antiretroviral medicinal products, genotypic 
resistance testing should guide the use of EDURANT (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).” is favourable and 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
Risk Management System  
The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1 of the 
marketing authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market. 
The MAH shall perform the pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as 
agreed in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation 
and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP. 
As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the 
updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR). 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
  When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, 
Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities 
  Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached  
  at the request of the EMA

Introduction 
Topotecan (Hycamtin™) is a cytotoxic anti-cancer agent exerting its activity by the inhibition of the 
nuclear enzyme topoisomerase I. The resulting DNA damage induces apoptotic cell death predominantly 
in replicating cells such as tumour cells.  Topotecan is registered in the European Union (EU), and 59 
other countries around the world for the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer following platinum-based 
therapy.  In addition to the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer, topotecan is registered for the treatment 
of relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in 39 countries worldwide.  Around 230 000 patients have been 
treated with topotecan since market launch in May 1996 to November 2004. 
The claimed new indication is:  
“Relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in patients for whom re-treatment with the first line regimen is 
not considered appropriate”. 
Lung cancer is amongst the most commonly occurring malignant diseases.  SCLC represents about 14% 
of all lung cancers and is a devastating disease with a long-term survival rate of around 5%.  Most patients 
have extended disease already at first diagnosis. Despite this an initial response to chemotherapy is most 
often the case. However, the development of a therapy resistant disease is usually rapid.   
The clinical evidence of today shows that patients with SCLC should be treated with a suitable first line 
regimen at initial presentation [cisplatin/ carboblatin plus etoposide or CAV (cyclophosphamide, 
Adriamycin [doxorubicin], and vincristine)], and should be considered for further therapy at relapse.  A 
minority of patients have adequate Performance Score (PS) and a sufficiently long time to progression 
(TTP) following first line chemotherapy to be eligible for re-treatment with the first line regimen.  The 
majority of patients need alternative therapy, and there is a great medical need for such new tolerated 
regimens for these patients.   
IV topotecan has been evaluated in patients with relapsed SCLC at the same dose and schedule as is 
currently stated in the SPC for the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer: 1.5mg/m2/day for five consecutive 
days and repeated every 21 days according to bone marrow recovery.  
Regulatory history of the application for Hycamtin in SCLC 
In December 1997, an application was made to the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products 
(CPMP) for the addition of the treatment indication “patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer 
(SCLC)”.  The application was supported by a pivotal phase III study showing similarity of topotecan 
compared with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and vincristine (CAV). The application was withdrawn in 
November 1998. The main hinder for approval was that patient benefit of second-line chemotherapy had 
not been scientifically proven in SCLC.  Therefore superiority over an established comparator was 
required for approval. 
A study was designed to address the reservations of the CPMP.  A randomised phase III study, Study 478, 
was designed to show superiority of oral topotecan over Active Symptom Control (ASC) (=best 
supportive care) in the treatment of relapsed, resistant SCLC.  It was considered unethical to include 
patients with relapsed SCLC unless their disease was “resistant” to the first line of therapy.  Oral 
administration was considered more appropriate for such patients than intravenous administration given 
their poor survival expectation and disease symptom burden. Following preliminary discussions with the 
Swedish and French regulatory agencies, the protocol was reviewed by the CPMP.  It was agreed that: 
the study design was adequate to prove the benefit of further chemotherapy to patients with 
relapsed SCLC; 
• 
• 
a positive outcome would support a second line indication for both IV and oral topotecan. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The dose of oral topotecan proposed for Study 478 was supported by data from a randomised phase II 
study (Study 065) which indicated that 2.3 mg/m2 oral and 1.5 mg/m2 intravenous (IV), daily for 
five days, every 21 days, were clinically similar in relapsed SCLC patients.  As this study was not 
powered to show a statistical difference between the two routes of administration and the ratio of oral and 
IV doses was not based on kinetic data, the Committee advised an application to the IV licence should 
include: 
• 
• 
• 
all available clinical data relevant to the oral to IV extrapolation, including data performed in 
ovarian cancer; 
a discussion of differences in the pharmacokinetics between the two formulations and the 
clinical relevance; 
pharmacological justification to support the claim of similarity in efficacy and safety of the two 
doses and routes of administration. 
Recruitment to Study 478 proved to be more difficult than expected.  Following consultations with the 
Rapporteur and the Co-Rapporteur, GSK submitted a second Type II variation application to register the 
treatment indication “small cell lung cancer (SCLC) after failure of first-line therapy” in November 2002. 
The application was withdrawn following an oral explanation. The outstanding objections were: 
• 
• 
• 
the comparative regimen in the pivotal phase III study is not justified for a large percentage of 
patients; 
non-inferiority in overall survival cannot be concluded; 
superiority as regards other important measures of clinical benefit such as symptom control has 
not been established. 
In October 2003, GSK met with the MPA and NAM to discuss the future conduct of Study 478 and the 
principals of extrapolating positive data from studies conducted with oral topotecan to the IV formulation. 
It was recognised that Study 478 was unlikely to complete as planned and agreed to GSK’s proposal to 
conduct a final analysis at 125 events.  Due to the maturity of the data the proposed analysis would have 
approximately 80% power and maintain alpha at 0.05.  It was confirmed that a positive outcome from 
Study 478 would continue to support an application to register relapsed SCLC for both formulations.   
Previous agreements that positive data obtained with oral topotecan could be extrapolated to the IV 
formulation were reconfirmed, specifically: 
• 
• 
• 
in general terms, extrapolation from oral to IV was more acceptable than IV to oral given the 
obvious differences in exposure; 
linearity for dose and exposure for each formulation should be demonstrated; 
pharmacokinetic data for all indications, not just SCLC, should be presented. 
Non-clinical aspects 
Since the dosing regimen proposed for treatment of relapsed small SCLC is identical to that currently 
registered in the EU for treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the ovary, i.e., 1.5 mg/m2 administered by 
intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily for 5 consecutive days, every 21 days, no additional 
nonclinical safety studies are considered necessary to support the current application.

Clinical aspects 
Clinical Pharmacology 
The doses and schedule of IV and oral capsule topotecan were defined in Phase I studies using identical 
selection criteria and definitions of dose-limiting toxicities in order to produce regimens with similar 
clinical profiles.  In crossover studies at the therapeutic doses (1.5 mg/m2/day (IV) or 2.3 mg/m2/day (oral) 
x 5 every 21 days), the IV formulation has a greater AUC (1.7-fold) and Cmax (5.4-fold) than the oral 
formulation.  In these studies, IV topotecan had less inter-subject variability than oral topotecan as 
expected, due to the additional impact of absorption [i.e., bioavailability] on exposure [AUC, Cmax] 
following oral administration. 
The disposition of topotecan is similar for both routes of administration, with a significant fraction of the 
dose reversibly hydrolysed to the carboxylate form.  Topotecan is cleared predominantly renally with a 
minor component metabolised to the N-desmethyl metabolite.  Mean exposure [metabolite/parent AUC 
ratio] to this metabolite is slightly higher following oral than IV administration, but it did not exceed 10% 
of the parent by either route. 
The PK profile is dose proportional for both IV and oral topotecan. Despite the differences in AUC and 
Cmax, plasma concentrations are similar between IV and oral topotecan at the therapeutic doses, from 
approximately two hours after dosing [start of infusion or oral administration].  Therefore, during a dosing 
interval, more than 90% of the concentration profile is similar between IV and oral administration. This 
similarity in concentration-time profiles by these routes is consistent with similar efficacy and overall 
clinical tolerability as has been shown in two randomised studies (Study 396 and 065), and may therefore 
be a better predictor than AUC or Cmax. 
A linear dose-PK relationship has been shown for both oral and IV administration of topotecan.  The 
results from the two clinical studies 396 and 065 addressing the comparability between the two 
formulations/ modes of administration are discussed further below. 
Further, preliminary bioavailability of topotecan was assessed using an oral drinking solution prepared 
from the reconstituted IV product, diluted in 200mls of 5% dextrose.  The oral administration of 
1.5mg/m2 on day 1 when compared to a 30 minutes infusion of 1.5mg/m2 on day 2 demonstrated a 
bioavailability of 30% with moderate inter-patient variability + 7.7%.  The oral drinking solution was well 
tolerated. The absolute bioavailability of oral topotecan determined using gelatin capsules compared to a 
30 minute infusions was similar, 42%  + 13%. 
Clinical Efficacy 
Previous applications for the use of intravenous (IV) topotecan in relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) 
have been based on six clinical studies evaluating intravenous (IV) topotecan.   
A phase III comparative study with oral topotecan therapy against Active Symptom Control (ASC) (Study 
478) in patients with relapsed, resistant SCLC has now been added to support the indication claim.  
Two randomised trials (Studies 065 and 396) are submitted to show that IV topotecan is no less active 
than oral topotecan in relapsed sensitive SCLC.  
Efficacy data from the integrated Total IV Topotecan (SCLC) population is also provided. 
The Applicant states that all studies were undertaken in accordance with standard operating procedures of 
the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Group of Companies, which comply with the principles of 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP). All studies were conducted with the approval of Ethics Committees or 
Institutional Review Boards. Informed consent was obtained for all subjects, and the studies were 
performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Where regulatory approval was required, this 
was obtained from the relevant health authority. 
The phase II/III clinical trials in relapsed SCLC are presented below (Table 1):

Main clinical study(ies) 
Studies 478, 396 and 090 are considered pivotal in addressing the crucial points for the establishment of 
an efficacy conclusion for topotecan in relapsed SCLC. The results from these studies will be discussed 
study by study in the results section below, while the phase II studies are regarded as supportive and the 
results from these are included and analysed in the integrated database for IV topotecan in SCLC. 
Study populations:  
• 
Study 478 was designed to recruit resistant patients, where resistant was defined as patients who had 
achieved a partial or complete response to first line therapy and progressed at least 45 days after 
completing first line therapy, who were not candidates for further IV chemotherapy but were 
considered of sufficient good health to tolerate treatment with single agent oral topotecan. 
Potential reasons for exclusion from second-line i.v. chemotherapy 
Each patient recruited into Study 478 received optimal and appropriate first-line chemotherapy, in 
accordance with local and national clinical practice and treatment guidelines and were not considered 
by their oncologist to be suitable for further IV chemotherapy. 
Residual toxicity to the first-line regimen alone would not necessarily exclude a patient from further 
IV chemotherapy. It may exclude a patient from re-treatment with the same regimen but IV cross-
over therapy would remain an option.  
Screening data collected within the Case Report Form (CRF) for each patient does not specifically 
capture the reason why a patient was not considered a candidate for further IV chemotherapy.  
Study 478: Potential reasons for exclusion from second-line intravenous chemotherapy 
Potential Reason  
A very short Time To 
Progression (TTP) of 
90 days following an 
initial response to first-
line chemotherapy.  
A relatively short TTP 
from first-line 
chemotherapy and 
residual toxicity to the 
first-line regimen.  
The patient’s personal 
choice not to receive 
further intravenous 
chemotherapy.   
Relevance to Study 478 Population  
58% of patients in the ASC + Oral topotecan arm and 51% in 
the ASC alone arm had a TTP from first-line of < 90 days. 
Until the completion of Study 478, clinically significant 
survival benefit had not been demonstrated in resistant SCLC 
thus palliating symptoms without administering further 
chemotherapy would have been an appropriate treatment 
option.  
13% of patients in the ASC + topotecan arm and 10% in the 
ASC alone arm reported residual toxicity attributed to their 
first-line chemotherapy. Assessing what influence these 
residual toxicities had on treatment options would be 
conjecture however sustained toxicities associated with the 
first-line chemotherapy will influence the choice/option of 
both the clinician and the patient.  
Data captured within the CRF for each patient may allow the 
potential reason why a patient was not considered a candidate 
for further intravenous chemotherapy to be identified, but it 
does not capture the full consultation process or individuals 
opinions. 
A bit more than 50% of patients in Study 478 had a relapse within 90 days. A minority of patients 
(13%) had residual toxicity and another 13% had received two types of chemotherapy prior to the 
entry to study 478. In conclusion, the majority of patients fulfil the requirement of not being suitable 
for re-treatment with the first line.

• 
• 
Studies 396, 065, and 090 were designed to recruit sensitive patients, where sensitive was defined as 
patients who had progressed ≥ 90 days (Studies 396 and 065) or ≥ 60 days (Study 090) after having a 
documented response to first line therapy. 
Studies 014EORTC, 014SB(92), and 053 were designed to recruit sensitive or refractory patients, 
where sensitive was defined as progression ≥ 90 days after having a documented response to first line 
therapy and refractory was defined as patients who 
• 
• 
received at least one full course of treatment and progressed during first line therapy, or 
received at least two full courses of treatment, responded initially (partial or complete response) 
or achieved stable disease, but progressed within 3 months (90 days) of completing first- line 
therapy. 
As overall survival was the primary endpoint in Study 478, patients were not required to have a 
bidimensionally measurable disease for inclusion in this study.  In the other six studies, where response 
rate was the primary endpoint, all patients were required to have a least one measurable indicator lesion at 
baseline. 
The other principal eligibility criteria, which were similar across all seven studies, are summarised in 
Table 2.

Treatment schedules  
The starting dose of oral topotecan (for Study 478, and as a comparator to IV topotecan in Study 396) 
was selected on the basis of a phase I study of oral topotecan in patients with malignant solid tumours 
which concluded that the maximum tolerated dose was 2.3mg/m2/day for 5 days every 21 days.   
 8
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study 049 (A phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of topotecan following oral 
administration over 5, 10 or 21 days in patients with malignant solid tumours) evaluated the 
pharmacokinetics across a broad dose range, from 0.15 mg/m2 to 2.9 mg/m2 (0.3 to 5.5 mg), and 
demonstrated dose proportionality. The pharmacokinetics of oral topotecan has been shown to be linear in 
this dose range. 
The initial study of oral topotecan, Study 047, evaluated a dose of 1.5 mg/m2 given by oral administration 
of the intravenous solution; however, after Study 049, clinical trials to evaluate oral topotecan have 
generally used the maximum tolerated dose determined by that study, 2.3 mg/m2. 
Study 065 comparing oral with IV topotecan in recurrent SCLC confirmed the clinical appropriateness of 
this dose selection. 
Extensive testing of IV topotecan over a range of dosing schedules from single day administration every 
21 days to continuous 21 day infusions identified once-daily dosing for 5 days every 21 days as an 
appropriate regimen.  The starting dose of IV topotecan was chosen on the basis of Phase I studies. This 
dose was subsequently approved as the registered dose for the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer.  In all 
studies IV topotecan was administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at an initial dose of 
1.5mg/m2/day for 5 days every 21 days. 
CAV (cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin [doxorubicin], and vincristine), used as a comparator in Study 090, 
was administered at the standard initial dose of cyclophosphamide 1000mg/m2 plus doxorubicin 45mg/m2 
plus vincristine 2mg/m2 every 21 days, with the maximum permitted doses being 2000mg/m2, 100mg/m2, 
and 2mg/m2, respectively.  Dose modification criteria were specified for reductions in the dose of 
cyclophosphamide and/or doxorubicin and/or vincristine.

Survival:  the time from first administration of study drug (randomisation in Study 478) until death due to 
any cause. 
Response rate:  the percentage of patients who had a complete or partial response. 
•  Complete response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance of all known measurable and 
evaluable disease determined by two measurements not less than 4 weeks apart. 
 9
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  A partial response (PR) was defined as a greater than 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the 
greatest length and perpendicular width of all measurable lesions for at least 4 weeks with no 
simultaneous increase in a known lesion (> 25%), appearance of new lesions or increase in evaluable 
disease during this period. 
• 
Stable disease (SD) was defined as a state of response which is less than partial or progression and 
lasts for at least 8 weeks. 
Investigators monitored and reported the response to treatment through application of the WHO response 
criteria.  Scans for all patients with a partial or complete response underwent independent radiological 
review.  In the phase III studies and Study 065 the independent radiologists were blinded to the respective 
treatment group. 
Time to response:  the time from initiation of study drug until the first documented complete or partial 
response. 
Response duration:  the time from the initial documented response to the first sign of progression. 
Time to progression (TTP):  the time from initiation of study drug (from randomisation in Study 478) 
until the first documented sign of disease progression or death due to progressive disease.  Disease 
progression was defined as a greater than 25% increase in a single measurable lesion; reappearance of 
measurable disease; clear worsening of evaluable disease; appearance of any new lesions; or significant 
worsening of a condition presumed to be related to malignancy. 
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment: In Studies 478, 396, 090, 065 and 053 disease related symptom 
improvement was assessed using Patient Symptom Assessment to access the following symptoms at 
baseline and at the end of each course of treatment: Shortness of Breath; Cough; Chest Pain; Coughing up 
Blood; Loss of Appetite; Interference with Sleep; Hoarseness; Fatigue (Studies 478, 090 and 065 only) 
and Interference with Daily Activities (Studies 478, 090 and 065 only). 
Study 396 used the patient completed FACT-L questionnaire to assess disease related symptoms at 
baseline and at the end of each course of treatment.  FACT-L is a validated 44-item self-reporting 
instrument consisting of five sections: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-
being, functional well-being, and an index specific to lung cancer and its associated symptoms. 
In Study 478, quality of life was assessed using the EuroQoL (EQ-5D) health questionnaire including the 
Visual Analogue Scale.  The EQ-5D is a 16-item self-reporting instrument consisting of five dimensions: 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression divided into three levels of 
perceived problems (level 1: no problems; level 2: some problem; level 3: extreme problem).  Unique 
health states are defined by combining response levels from each of the five dimensions.  The Visual 
Analogue Scale uses a thermometer-style scale on which patients rate their overall health state from zero 
(worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable). 
Statistics 
Study  478:  To  demonstrate  survival  superiority  with  the  addition  of  oral  topotecan  to  Active  Symptom 
Control (ASC), 110 patients per treatment group were required.  This sample size was calculated using a 
two-sided  nonparametric  log-rank  test  which  assumed  all  patients  were  followed  for  a  fixed  length  of 
time, that the hazard ratio was constant over time and the estimated median survival time was 12 weeks 
for the ASC group, with an anticipated survival time of 20 weeks for the topotecan + ASC group.  The 
sample  size  calculation  was  based  on  a  minimum  follow-up  period  for  all  patients  of  30  weeks  or  until 
death,  a  5%  risk  of  erroneously  claiming  superiority,  and  a  90%  chance  of  successfully  declaring 
superiority.

Due to protracted recruitment and diminishing number of centres and countries willing to participate in 
this study, this study was terminated early after randomising 141 patients.  Because the study was 
terminated early, the power was reduced from the original 90%; the final analysis was to be performed 
when at least 125 deaths had occurred providing 80% power to successfully declare superiority of oral 
topotecan + ASC over ASC alone in the presence of a true underlying difference, using the same 
assumptions as in the original sample size calculation. 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population, comprised all randomised patients, and was the primary population 
for analyses of demography and efficacy. 
The modified ITT population, comprised all randomised and treated patients in the topotecan/ASC group 
and all randomised patients in the ASC group who had at least one evaluation, and was the primary 
population for safety and QoL. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates for survival were presented.  Patients were censored for these analyses if the 
event in question had not occurred at the time of reporting or the patient was lost to follow-up. Overall 
survival was also analysed using a Cox regression model. 
“Survival” was chosen for study 478 and is considered as the only acceptable primary endpoint in 
confirmatory studies in SCLC. 
Study 396: A sample size of 300 patients (150 per treatment group) was not based on formal statistical 
criteria, but rather the practical limitations of feasible enrolment rates and study completion time.  These 
provided 71% power to show that the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in 
response rate (oral minus IV topotecan) between formulations excluded values larger than 10%, assuming 
that the response rate following second-line treatment with IV topotecan in patients with SCLC is 19%. 
The ITT population comprised all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study medication 
(IV or oral topotecan), and was the primary population for analysis of efficacy. 
An estimated percentage difference in response rate between oral and IV topotecan and a two-sided 95% 
CI based on normal approximation of binomial distribution were presented.  As the goal was to 
demonstrate non-inferiority of oral to IV topotecan, the lower limit of the 95% CI was compared against 
the pre-specified non-inferiority limit (10%). 
Study 090: Assuming response rates following second-line treatment with IV topotecan and CAV of 33% 
(based on previous GSK experience with IV topotecan) and 28% [Shepherd, 1987], respectively, a sample 
size of 200 patients was required to provide 90% probability that the lower 95% confidence limit for the 
difference between treatments excluded values larger than 14% (the magnitude of a clinically important 
difference in this population) in favour of CAV. 
The ITT population comprised all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study medication 
(IV topotecan or CAV), and was the primary population for analysis of efficacy. 
Response rates and the estimated percentage difference in response rates between treatment groups (IV 
topotecan and CAV) along with 95% CIs based on normal approximation of binomial distribution were 
presented.  As the goal was to demonstrate non-inferiority of IV topotecan to CAV, the lower limit of the 
95% CI was compared against the pre-specified non-inferiority limit (14%). 
Total IV Topotecan Population: The ITT population for the integrated analysis comprised all 
randomised patients in the IV topotecan treatment group of Studies 396, 090, 065, 014EORTC, 
014SB(092) and 053.  Data from Study 396 using the initial cut-off date were included in this population. 
The similarity in design and patient populations allows pooling of the data from the six studies that 
 11
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
included an IV topotecan group (the Total IV topotecan population).  These analyses are descriptive in 
nature. Kaplan-Meier plots for survival were displayed for the Total IV topotecan population by 
sensitivity (sensitive vs. refractive and separately, <90 days, 90-180 days, >180 days).

Time to Progression (TTP) from first-line therapy 
The two treatment groups were similar in terms of key established prognostic factors.  The median TTP 
from first line chemotherapy was 84 days for the oral topotecan plus ASC group and 90 days for the ASC 
alone group. 
Only four (6%) patients in each arm had relapsed < 45 days after completing their first-line chemotherapy; 
of these eight patients, six had a TTP that was between 34 to 44 days. 
In the ASC+ oral topotecan arm 23% of patients had a TTP of between 91 and 180 days compared to 31% 
in the ASC alone arm. A further 20% and 17% respectively had a TTP of > 180 days.

CI 11.1, 18.6) (log-rank p=0.0104).  The median survival of patients receiving ASC alone closely mirrors 
the survival described in the literature for untreated SCLC. The unadjusted hazard ratio for oral topotecan 
plus ASC versus ASC alone was 0.638 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.90) (Figure 1).

Time (weeks)
The survival advantage for oral topotecan plus ASC over ASC alone is maintained in the subset analysis 
based on a priori stratification by TTP (≤ or > 60 days) from first line chemotherapy.  In the subset of 
patients with a TTP ≤ 60 days median survival times were 23.3 weeks and 13.2 weeks for topotecan plus 
ASC (n=22) and ASC alone (n=20), respectively (overall survival HR: 0.499, 95% CI: 0.264, 0.942,  
p=0.0357).  In the subset of patients with a TTP > 60 days median survival times were 27.7 weeks and 
14.4 weeks for topotecan plus ASC (n=49) and ASC alone (n=50), respectively (overall survival HR: 
0.696, 95% CI: 0.464 to 1.052, p=0.0975).

QoL and disease-related symptom benefits were associated with active chemotherapy (data not shown in 
AR). 
Survival by first-line chemotherapy regimen 
The Applicant performed a subgroup analysis of those patients who received CAV, platinum, etoposide or 
other first-line treatments in Study 478. The efficacy of topotecan in patients with relapsed, resistant 
SCLC was consistent irrespective of the first-line regimen.  
Median survival and Hazard Ratios consistently favour Active Symptom Control (ASC) + oral topotecan; 
the subgroup analysis does not demonstrate any inconsistency. Although the number of patients within the 
respective sub-sets are small and the analysis was ad hoc, the data are consistent with the ITT population 
analysis which demonstrated clinical and statistical superiority of chemotherapy over ASC alone 
(p=0.0104).

As would be expected, the natural course of the untreated disease is that patients with better PS have a 
longer survival without treatment than patients with worse PS (18.6 weeks versus 7.7 weeks, 
respectively). 
Both populations (PS 0/1 and PS 2) experience survival benefit following treatment with active 
chemotherapy. For patients with PS 0/1 the median survival following active chemotherapy was 29.2 
weeks and for patients with PS 2, the median was 20.9 weeks. The magnitude of the survival benefit was 
similar in the two groups and median survival was extended by about 12 weeks. 
Study 396 
The two treatment groups were similar in terms of key established prognostic factors.  The median TTP 
from first line chemotherapy was 25.2 weeks (176 days) for the oral topotecan group and 27.1 weeks (190 
days) for the IV topotecan group.  Thus, this is a more sensitive population than in Study 478. 
Median survival times in Study 396 were 33.0 weeks (95% CI 29.1, 42.4) for oral topotecan and 35.0 
weeks (95% CI 31.0, 37.1) for IV topotecan.  The hazard ratio of oral topotecan relative to IV topotecan 
for survival was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.21). Comparison of survival outcomes was not confounded by 
post-study third-line chemotherapy as a similar proportion of patients in both treatment groups received 
third-line therapy (chemotherapy, IV: 35.1%, oral: 32.7%). 
Survival data from Study 396 is illustrated in Figure 2.  Survival curves from the randomized Phase II 
Study 065 support these Phase III data (overlapping curves, data not shown).

Results showed no substantive differences in average change from baseline between oral and IV treatment 
groups.  There was no apparent difference between treatments in change from baseline in total FACT-L 
scores, TOI scores, individual well-being subscale scores, including the lung cancer scale, or scores for 
most individual symptoms. 
Study 396 showed that no advantage is seen with either formualation of topotecan. The treatment 
schedules of both formulations were chosen based on MTD, and the results regarding response rate (1st 
end point) achieved in the 396 trial show that the activity is very similar. The point estimates favour IV 
treatment. Survival and QoL data from both studies are supportive.

Predictably, and as demonstrated in the literature on this subject, patients with sensitive SCLC had a 
higher response rate than patients with resistant disease.  Figure 4 shows survival curves from the 
Total IV topotecan (SCLC) population, presented according to the pre-defined stratification factor; 
TFI <90 days (refractory) or TFI >90 days (sensitive).

Patients who were sensitive to prior chemotherapy achieved a median survival time of 30.3 weeks 
(95% CI 27.6, 33.4) compared with 19.9 weeks (95% CI 16.0, 22.6) for those who were refractory to 
prior chemotherapy.  
A further category was introduced post-hoc at the request of CHMP in order to answer the question “is 
the therapeutic effect preserved in patients with a very long TFI?”  This additional category sub-
divided patients with sensitive SCLC into those with TFI 90 – 180 days or TFI >180 days.  Outcomes 
for patients with resistant disease are also shown.  These data are shown in the Kaplan – Meier plot in 
Figure 5 and in Table 10.

The overall survival according to PS is of similar range to the survival benefit seen in the topotecan-
treated patients on Study 478. The survival of PS 2 patients is substantially improved compared to the 
expectation for the untreated patient as demonstrated by Study 478 in the patients who receive active 
symptom control alone. 
Discussion Clinical Efficacy 
Based on the results of Study 478, it is concluded that oral topotecan has a beneficial effect as 
compared with best supportive care/ASC in a resistant population of SCLC patients. This group had a 
progression free interval of at least 45 days and the patients were judged by their doctor not to be 
eligible for further more intensive (i.e. IV) chemotherapy. In a situation where the comparator was 
ASC it is most likely that the patients included in study 478 had a very poor prognosis. Today, second 
line chemotherapy is commonly used in patients who can tolerate such treatment. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The median survival prolongation achieved with oral topotecan of 12 weeks is considered clinically 
valuable. The statistical significance of the difference between the survival curves (p=0.0104) is 
considered as sufficient for the superiority conclusion. Taking the results in consideration together 
with previous results with topotecan in relapsed SCLC (study 090) it is beyond doubt that the drug is 
efficacious in this setting. It has also now been clearly shown for the first time in a randomised study 
that chemotherapy has a place second line in the treatment of SCLC, and also in the group of patients 
with the worst prognosis. 
A separate analysis of the patients with a poor performance status (PS>1) was presented in the 478 
Study report. Median (95% CI) survival was 7.7 (5.3-13.1) and 20.9 (13.4-26.9) weeks in the ASC 
alone and topotecan treated groups, respectively (N=42, p=0.0146).  Thus, it was made plausible that 
those patients also benefit from topotecan therapy. 
Patients who received platinum/etoposide followed by CAV as first line treatment seem to have better 
overall survival than other groups. However, the number of patients is too small to draw any further 
conclusions. Nevertheless, there is a benefit for the patient irrespectively of the previous therapy. 
Study 396 is showing similarity regarding efficacy between the IV regimen proposed for use in 
relapsed SCLC and the oral regimen used for topotecan administration in Study 478. 
The pooled data further substantiated the clinical evidence of activity of IV topotecan in relapsed 
SCLC with this administration form. This cannot be regarded as proof of activity by itself but in the 
light of historical comparison it supports a positive conclusion regarding efficacy. The outcome of the 
analysis by sensitivity facilitates comparisons of subsets of patients. As expected, these analyses 
clearly demonstrate that patients with a long TFI have a greater survival than those patients with a 
short TFI.  
Clinical Safety 
The current Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for Hycamtin has been maintained by regular 
Periodic Safety Update Reports, and the total safety database now represents a cumulative exposure in 
excess of 229,349 patients with SCLC, ovarian and a variety of other cancers that have been treated 
with topotecan since launch to November 2004. 
This part of the AR will focus on safety aspects of relevance for the proposed new indication; relapsed 
SCLC. It is considered of relevance to make sure that: 
- the safety profile for topotecan in general does not differ from that in relapsed ovarian 
cancer (currently approved indication);  
- IV and oral topotecan do not differ in terms of safety; 
- certain subpopulations of patients do not show increased toxicity (mainly impact of 
gender, age, disease and performance status). 
Therefore, safety data from the randomised studies in SCLC, the comparisons between SCLC and 
ovarian cancer patients and comparisons between relevant subpopulations of SCLC patients will be 
referred to below. 
Patient exposure 
Oral topotecan was delivered at or above the planned starting dose in 87% and 92% of courses in 
Study 478 and Study 396 respectively (Table 11).

For the Total IV topotecan (SCLC) population 63% of patients received > 3 courses of treatment and 
the median number of courses administered was 4 (range 1-22). 
In the Total IV topotecan (Ovarian) population, a total of 523 patients received 2991 courses of 
topotecan treatment, at doses ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mg/m2/day. The extent of exposure by dose, is 
shown in Table 13.  As in the Total IV topotecan (SCLC) population, the majority of courses (73%) 
were at the planned starting dose of 1.5 mg/m2/day.

In the Total IV topotecan (Ovarian) population, 46 patients had more than 10 courses of treatment and 
two received 33 courses, with a mean cumulative dose of 229 mg/m2.  Overall median dose intensity 
was 2.31 mg/m2/week.  This is similar to the overall median dose intensity of 2.29 mg/m2/week 
achieved in the Total IV topotecan (SCLC) population. In the Total IV topotecan (Ovarian) 
population, the median number of courses was five and the median cumulative topotecan dose was 
37.5 mg/m2. 
Adverse events 
Non-haematological AEs 
In the Total IV topotecan (SCLC) population, 595 (94%) patients experienced non-haematological 
AEs, regardless of Grade or relationship to treatment; 338 (54%) patients experienced Grade 3/4 
toxicities.  The numbers of patients experiencing AEs in the Total IV topotecan (Ovarian) population 
were similar: 517 (99%) patients experienced non-haematological AEs, regardless of Grade or 
relationship to treatment; 268 (51%) patients experienced Grade 3/4 toxicities.   
In both populations, nausea, alopecia and vomiting were the most frequently occurring AEs followed 
in the Total IV topotecan (SCLC) population by asthenia, dyspnoea and fatigue and in the Total IV 
topotecan (Ovarian) population by diarrhoea, constipation and fatigue.  It should be noted that with the 
exception of asthenia and dyspnoea, the incidences of each of these most frequent events were smaller 
in the Total IV topotecan (SCLC) population than in the Total IV topotecan (Ovarian) population.  
The incidences of asthenia and dyspnoea were only slightly higher in the Total IV topotecan (SCLC) 
population than in the Total IV topotecan (Ovarian) population, despite dyspnoea being a recognized 
symptom of SCLC.    
In the Total IV topotecan (SCLC) population, the most frequently occurring Grade 3/4 AEs were 
dyspnoea, asthenia and fatigue; in the Total IV topotecan (Ovarian) population, the most frequently 
occurring Grade 3/4 AEs were nausea, vomiting, sepsis and abdominal pain.   
Tables  14  and  15  below  illustrate  non-haematological  toxicity  with  IV  topotecan  in  relapsed  SCLC 
and ovarian cancer, respectively. 
In Study 478, the most frequent AEs in the oral topotecan plus ASC group were nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhoea and the most frequent Grade 3/4 toxicity was diarrhoea.  The most frequent AEs in the ASC 
alone group were disease progression, dyspnoea and cough and the most frequent Grade 3/4 toxicity 
was disease progression.   
In Study 396 a total of 138 patients (90.2%) in the oral topotecan group and 136 patients (90.1%) in 
the IV topotecan group had non-haematological AEs, of any relationship to study treatment.  In 
general the treatments were similar with respect to the incidence of individual AEs and the most 
commonly occurring events in both groups were nausea, fatigue and alopecia, together with diarrhoea 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the oral treatment group and dyspnoea in the IV treatment group.  These events were mainly of mild 
or moderate severity.

Haematological AEs 
For both oral and IV topotecan, the principle haematological AE was bone marrow suppression, 
mainly neutropenia.  The overall incidence of haematological toxicities in study 396 by course 
(reflecting dose adjustment) and by grade is shown in Table 16.

The incidences of anaemia and thrombocytopenia associated with oral and IV topotecan were similar. 
The incidence of Grade 3/4 neutropenia per patient was lower in patients receiving oral topotecan 
(73.2%) compared with IV topotecan (87.7%). However, the complications associated with 
neutropenia were more similar.  Table 17 shows the incidence of complications per patient and per 
course.

Deaths due to haematological toxicity in the Total IV topotecan (SCLC) population (2.4%) are 
consistent with rates reported in the Total IV topotecan (ovarian) population (1.5%) and the literature 
for standard cytotoxic regimens in SCLC (2-5%).  In Study 090, deaths due to haematological toxicity 
were 3.7% for IV topotecan and 1.9% for CAV.  Conversely, from Study 396, the figures for IV 
topotecan versus oral topotecan were 1.3% and 2.6%, respectively.  In study 478 deaths due to 
haematological toxicity on the oral topotecan plus ASC arm were 4.3% (Table 21).  In Study 478, the 
risk of early death associated with oral topotecan was significantly lower than the risk of early death 
on no active therapy.  The risk of death from any cause (including progressive disease) within 30 days 
of randomisation was 7% for oral topotecan plus ASC and 13% for ASC alone, i.e., patients with 
relapsed SCLC who do not receive active chemotherapy have nearly twice as great a risk of early 
death as patients who do receive efficacious chemotherapy.

Clinical laboratory evaluations 
The incidence of biochemical abnormalities associated with topotecan was generally similar for the 
Total IV topotecan (SCLC) population and the population with ovarian cancer.  In general, non-
haematological abnormalities reported were more likely to be associated with the underlying 
malignancy than with topotecan treatment. 
Safety in special populations 
Sex: Although the overall incidence of AEs was no different between males and females, generally the 
incidences  of  the  most  frequent  AEs  were  higher  in  females  than  in  males.  Overall  there  was  no 
increased  haematological  toxicity  associated  with  the  use  of  topotecan  in  one  gender  relative  to  the 
other. 
Age: Concerning overall incidence of AEs there were no noticeable differences between patients aged 
41 to 64 years and those aged 65 years or more.  Interpretation of data for the youngest age group is 
complicated by the small number of patients (n=16). However, the incidence of infectious events and 
the use of antibiotic treatment was low in the 18-40 years age group.  Comparing the age groups 41-64 
years and > 65 years, there was a slight tendency towards an increased incidence of the consequences 
of neutropenia in older patients.  Fever or infection >Grade 2 proximate to Grade 4 neutropenia were 
associated with increased use of intravenous antibiotics in the older patients, as was the incidence of 
sepsis. 
Performance status: The incidences by patient of the most frequently occurring (≥15%) non-
haematological AEs, regardless of causality, were generally similar for patients who had a baseline PS 
of 0/1 or 2/3.  Differences of note were that patients with a reduced PS had a higher overall incidence 
of vomiting, asthenia, stomatitis, constipation and epistaxis compared to patients with a PS of 0/1.  
Grade 3/4 toxicities were more frequent in patients with a reduced PS; this is partly due to the higher 
incidence of Grade 3/4 dyspnoea in this group, which is one of the common symptoms associated with 
SCLC.  
The proportions of patients with neutropenia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia or anaemia (all Grades) 
and Grade 4 neutropenia were similar for the two groups.  However, the incidence of Grade 4 
thrombocytopenia and Grade 3/4 anaemia was higher in patients with a PS of 2/3 than in those with a 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PS status of 0/1. In patients with a reduced PS, the incidence of infection ≥Grade 2 associated with 
Grade 4 neutropenia was higher than in those with a PS of 0/1 (PS 2/3: 16% of patients in 6% of 
courses; PS 0/1: 10% of patients in 3% of courses).  Similarly, IV antibiotic use associated with 
infection/fever ≥Grade 2 proximate to Grade 4 neutropenia, or sepsis, was also seen in a greater 
proportion of patients and courses in the former group (PS 2/3: 19% of patients in 6% of courses; PS 
0/1: 10% of patients in 3% of courses). 
The incidence of bleeding complications in PS 0/1 patients and PS 2/3 patients was 15% and 23% of 
patients respectively.  Likewise the number of Grade 3/4 bleeding events was higher in patients with a 
PS of 2/3 than for those with a PS of 0/1, 5/116 (4%) and 8/514 (2%) respectively.  The five Grade 3/4 
events reported for patients with a PS of 2/3 included one haemoptysis, one epistaxis, one 
haematemesis, one CVA and one haemorrhage rectum.  Four of the five events were reported as 
related to treatment. 
Patients with poor PS tend to have a greater severity of haematological toxicity associated with the use 
of topotecan than do patients with good PS. This tendency has also been observed in the Total IV 
topotecan (Ovarian) population and there is a warning to this effect in the current SPC.  These risks 
must be considered in the context of a population known to have a particularly poor survival and are 
considered to be consistent with the risks associated with adequate management of the disease. 
The incidence of clinical sequelae of severe neutropenia in patients with a baseline PS of 0/1 or 2/3 is 
shown by patient and course in Table 23.

Patients with PS 0/1 appear to have less grade 4 neutropenia than patients with PS 2 (30% vs. 41%). 
The numbers are very small (seven patients with PS 2), but the trend seems to be clear. Similarly the 
incidences of severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia (although sub-acute and not generally dose 
limiting) appear to be slightly higher amongst the PS 2 patients than amongst the PS 0/1 patients. 
The effect of Performance Status (PS) and also sensitivity to prior chemotherapy on the risk for early 
death has been examined.  The number of deaths within 30 days of treatment amongst patients in the 
Total IV topotecan (SCLC) population with a PS of 0/1 or 2/3 at baseline are summarised in Table 24.

Discussion Clinical Safety 
The consistency between the safety profiles in patients with relapsed SCLC and ovarian cancer is 
acknowledged. The dose and posology have not been changed and the eligibility criteria concerning 
performance status and concomitant disease status are similar between the studies in SCLC and 
ovarian cancer. Overall, there are no new safety issues for topotecan when used in relapsed SCLC as 
compared with relapsed ovarian cancer. It has also been shown that there are no major differences 
regarding safety risks with IV topotecan as compared with oral.  
The major AE associated with topotecan in relapsed SCLC was as expected bone marrow suppression. 
This is manageable with dose adjustments and reversible. Nevertheless, the major risk factor with 
topotecan treatment is the possibly lethal consequences of bone marrow depression. The overall 
incidence of haematological toxicity and its consequences did not increase in the elderly but to some 
extent in patients with poor PS.  
There is a trend towards worse tolerability amongst patients of poor PS compared to patients of good 
PS. The difference is small and difficult to quantify. The demonstrated survival advantage fully 
justifies the use of IV topotecan in patients of PS 2 as well in patients of PS 0/1. 
The incidence of haematological toxicity, especially neutropenia, for IV topotecan is higher when 
compared to oral topotecan. In Study 396, the incidence of Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 88% on the IV 
arm and 73% on the oral arm. However, the increased incidence of neutropenia with the IV 
administration as compared to oral is not translated into a higher incidence of complications such as 
infectious complications, sepsis and drug related mortality. The SPC includes adequate warnings in 
this regard. 
According to the data presented above the lethal haematological toxicity of topotecan by sensitivity to 
1st line chemotherapy is the same. It seems plausible that the degree of sensitivity to the initial therapy 
does not have an impact on the haematological toxicity. Instead, the toxicity may be related to the 
haematological profile, bone marrow reserve, and to hepatic/renal capacity. 
The ability for a patient to tolerate cytotoxic chemotherapy does not depend on the duration of the 
response to first-line therapy. The Total IV Topotecan (SCLC) population has demonstrated that a 
patient’s ability to tolerate therapy depends on a full recovery from first-line treatment, adequate bone 
marrow reserves, renal/hepatic function and performance status (PS) at the time of second-line 
therapy.

Benefit Risk  
The clinical development programme for Hycamtin in relapsed SCLC is extensive and three 
randomised pivotal studies form the basis of evidence that enables an approval of its use in this 
indication: 
•  Study 478 shows that chemotherapy with Hycamtin is beneficial as compared to best 
supportive care in 2nd line treatment of SCLC that is regarded as resistant (judged by the 
treating physician). Since a superiority conclusion could be drawn based on a 12-week 
prolongation of the median overall survival, the proof of clinical benefit from treatment has 
been established in a randomised comparison for the first time in relapsed SCLC. 
•  Extrapolation from the results in resistant patients to more sensitive (in the context of having 
longer progression free interval) is considered justified. 
•  Study 090 shows that Hycamtin is as good as CAV in 2nd line treatment of patients with a 
disease regarded as sensitive. 
•  Study 396 shows that the previously approved IV regimen is similar to the oral regimen used 
in study 478 regarding efficacy and safety. 
In patients with relapsed SCLC, whether of PS 0/1 or of PS >1 a positive benefit has been shown. 
Topotecan therapy substantially prolongs survival compared to no chemotherapy. The magnitude of 
this benefit appears to be similar in the two groups. However, there is a trend to slightly worse 
tolerability amongst patients of poor PS (PS 2) compared to patients of good PS (PS 0/1); but the 
difference is not quantifiable, the majority of patients complete therapy as planned and the overall 
burden of therapy is reasonable.  
The overall burden of treatment complications according to PS was similar between those patients of 
poor PS and those of good PS, most likely a result of dose adjustment. Amongst patients of PS 2 there 
are more haematological and non-haematological adverse experiences, but the tolerability is still 
acceptable. The SPC includes appropriate warnings in this regard.  
All in all, there are no new safety issues for topotecan in relapsed SCLC and the safety profile is 
consistent with the current SPC, reflecting its use in relapsed ovarian cancer. An EU Risk 
Management Plan is not considered necessary based on an approval of the application of the new 
indication, relapsed SCLC. No additional risk minimisation measures are required besides the 
amendments to the SPC and routine PSURs. The overall benefit/risk is judged as positive for the 
treatment of patients with relapsed SCLC not suitable for retreatment with their 1st line chemotherapy 
regimen. 
Given the expected benefit in Quality of Life that an oral formulation would provide as compared to 
the IV formulation, the CHMP were of the view that an application for an oral formulation should be 
submitted as soon as possible for the same indication. The Applicant has informed the CHMP that 
they are progressing the development of an oral formulation and has committed to keep the Committee 
informed of the progress made within agreed timeframes.  
CONCLUSION 
-  On 17 November 2005 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed 
on  the  amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet.

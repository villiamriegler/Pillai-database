1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Novavax CZ, a.s. submitted on 16 November 2021 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Nuvaxovid, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 6 November 2020. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Nuvaxovid is indicated for active immunisation to 
prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0126/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0126/2021 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
1.5.  Applicant’s requests for consideration 
1.5.1.  Conditional marketing authorisation 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional marketing authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation. as it is intended for the prophylaxis 
of a life-threatening disease. In addition, the above-mentioned medicinal product is intended for use 
in an emergency situation, in response to public health threats duly recognised by the World Health 
Organisation and by the Union. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 10/168 
 
 
 
1.5.2.  New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein contained in the 
above medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
1.6.  Scientific advice 
The applicant received the following Scientific Advice on the development relevant for the indication 
subject to the present application: 
Date 
Reference 
SAWP co-ordinators 
12 October 2020 
EMEA/H/SA/4686/1/2020/III 
Prof Brigitte Schwarzer-Daum, Dr Mair 
Powell 
The Scientific Advice pertained to the following quality/non-clinical/clinical aspects: 
•  Comparability exercise to assess production of active substance, Matrix-M1 adjuvant and 
finished product at additional manufacturing facilities 
Lot release testing protocol for active substance and finished product 
• 
•  Non-clinical development plan 
•  Clinical data package to support a conditional MAA 
•  Advice on paediatric vaccine development and timelines 
Compliance with Scientific Advice 
Clinical aspects discussed included the acceptability of the proposed clinical development programme 
to support a potential (c)MA proposing study 2019nCoV-501 as pivotal study, as well as the 
acceptability of the target of demonstrating a VE of 50% with a lower bound of the 95% CI of >0. This 
was not accepted as sufficient, indicating the lower bound of the CI should at least be ≥20% and 
preferably ≥30%. Considering the submission is no longer in line with the proposal in the advice (i.e., 
2019nCoV-501 is not the pivotal study), the following comments were provided in this advice on the 
clinical development plan which hold relevance: 
- 
The safety and immunogenicity data obtained in Part 1 support inclusion of the adjuvant and 
administration of a second dose, with no apparent advantage for 25 vs. 5 μg antigen doses in 
the adjuvanted formulations.  
- 
- 
- 
It was advised that the study would have a single primary efficacy endpoint based on 
prevention of COVID-19 disease of any severity. This was followed. 
There was concern regarding the definitions for severity of disease. More stringent 
categorisation was recommended. This has not been followed. 
It was found acceptable that the primary analysis is conducted in baseline seronegative 
subjects and counting cases from day 7 after the second dose. However, it was recommended 
that only these criteria would be applied as exclusions for the primary analysis population. 
Analyses of the primary endpoint in other sub-populations should be designated as secondary. 
Sensitivity analyses should be planned counting all cases from randomisation, all cases after 
dose 1 and all cases after dose 2, each of which should be conducted in baseline seronegatives 
and in the total study population. These analyses have only in part been provided.

-  Given the nature of this vaccine, it was found acceptable that solicited local and systemic 
reactogenicity data were collected for 7 days after both doses. 
1.7.  COVID-19 EMA pandemic Task Force (COVID-ETF)  
In line with their mandate as per the EMA Emerging Health Threats Plan, the ETF undertook the

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
End of December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed about a cluster of cases of 
viral pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China. In mid-January 2020 the pathogen causing this 
atypical pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) and genome sequence data were published. Since then, the virus has spread globally 
and on 30th January 2020 the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International 
Concern and on 11th March 2020 a pandemic. The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts 
to control the outbreak. According to ECDC, histologic findings from the lungs include diffuse alveolar 
damage similar to lung injury caused by other respiratory viruses, such as MERS-CoV and influenza 
virus. A distinctive characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vascular damage, with severe endothelial 
injury, widespread thrombosis, microangiopathy and angiogenesis. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
As of 1st March 2021, there have been over 113 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
globally with approximately 2.5 million deaths resulting from infection and subsequent coronavirus 
disease (COVID-19). The majority of infections result in asymptomatic or mild disease with full 
recovery. Underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic 
respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, immune compromised status, cancer and obesity are 
considered risk factors for developing severe COVID-19. Other risk factors include organ 
transplantation and chromosomal abnormalities. Increasing age is another risk factor for severe 
disease and death due to COVID-19. European countries that have established surveillance systems in 
long-term care facilities (LTCF) have reported that 5-6% of all current LTCF residents died of COVID-
19, and that LTCF residents accounted for up to 72% of all COVID-19 related deaths. Individuals with 
high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to occupation include healthcare and frontline workers. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA 
segment. It is enveloped and the virions are 50–200 nanometres in diameter. Like other 
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M 
(membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins. The spike protein contains a polybasic cleavage site, a 
characteristic known to increase pathogenicity and transmissibility in other viruses. The Spike is 
responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the membrane of a host cell. The S1 
subunit catalyses attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present on cells 
of the respiratory tract, while the S2 subunit facilitates fusion with the cell membrane. The spike 
protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine development because it was shown that antibodies 
directed against it neutralise the virus and it elicits an immune response that prevents infection in 
animals.  
It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 has zoonotic origins and it has close genetic similarity to bat 
coronaviruses. Its gene sequence was published mid-January 2020 and the virus belongs to the 
betacoronaviruses. Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in January 2020. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 15/168 
 
 
 
Transmission occurs primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes and through aerosols. 
The median incubation period after infection to the development of symptoms is four to five days. Most 
symptomatic individuals experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all 
symptomatic individuals will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve. Common symptoms 
include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste and symptoms may 
change over time.  
The major complication of severe COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presenting 
with dyspnoea and acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. In addition to 
respiratory sequelae, severe COVID-19 has been linked to cardiovascular sequelae, such as myocardial 
injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, acute kidney injury often requiring renal 
replacement therapy, neurological complications such as encephalopathy, and acute ischemic stroke. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
The severity of COVID-19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, 
resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases typically 
recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to 
recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to 
eight weeks. Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the 
hospital are associated with severe course of COVID-19 and with a transfer to ICU. The gold standard 
method of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR), which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As this test detects RNA but not 
infectious virus, its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. The test is typically 
done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab, a nasal swab or sputum sample. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The management of COVID-19 cases has developed during 2020, and includes supportive care, which 
may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs. Treatment of 
hospitalised patients encompass anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone and statins, 
targeted immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants as well as antiviral therapy (e.g. remdesivir), 
antibodies administered from convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulins. 
These therapies have shown variable and limited impact on the severity and duration of illness, with 
different efficacies depending on the stage of illness and manifestations of disease. While care for 
individuals with COVID-19 has improved with clinical experience, there remains an urgent and unmet 
medical need for vaccines able to prevent or mitigate COVID-19 infections during the ongoing 
pandemic. Especially protection of vulnerable groups and mitigating the effects of the pandemic on a 
population level are desired. Although four vaccines for prevention of COVID-19 were authorised 
recently, there is still an important need for additional vaccines to meet global demands. 
2.2.  About the product 
Nuvaxovid (also referred to in this report as NVX-CoV2373) is a vaccine developed for prevention of 
COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.  
Nuvaxovid is composed of purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (S) protein that is 
stabilised in its prefusion conformation. The addition of the saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant facilitates 
activation of the cells of the innate immune system, which enhances the magnitude of the S protein-
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 16/168 
 
 
 
specific immune response. The two vaccine components elicit B- and T-cell immune responses to the S 
protein, including neutralising antibodies, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19. 
Nuvaxovid is administered intramuscularly as a course of 2 doses of 0.5 mL each. It is recommended 
to administer the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose. 
The intended indication for Nuvaxovid is ‘for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by 
SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older’. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
According to the applicant, the benefit-risk balance of Nuvaxovid is positive in the active immunisation 
to prevent COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 18 years of age and older. To 
demonstrate positive benefit-risk balance for this product, the applicant submitted data from non-
clinical and clinical studies as well as supportive literature references. 
The applicant considers that the non-clinical program has demonstrated that Nuvaxovid generates a 
robust and functional immune response, eliciting neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, resulting 
in protective efficacy following live viral challenge across multiple species. No adverse risks have been 
identified in the non-clinical testing program and the data support the proposed dose and regimen for 
human use.  
The applicant provided results from two pivotal Phase 3 studies, showing that Nuvaxovid prevents 
PCR-confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 with observed efficacies of ~90%, 
with comparable efficacies against non-B.1.1.7 variant strains (96.4%) and variants that were either 
considered of concern or interest (VOC/VOI) (93.2%) or not considered VOC/VOI (100%) and 
specifically against the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant (86.3% and 93.6%, in each of the two pivotal studies, 
respectively). Among Nuvaxovid recipients, there have been no cases of severe disease with an onset 
from at least 7 days after second vaccination, which mitigates concerns over vaccine-enhanced 
respiratory disease. The clinical benefit was consistent across all participants. Based on the 
administration of Nuvaxovid to 30,058 adults, there have been no safety concerns and the safety 
profile has been largely characterised by mild or moderate reactogenicity reactions of short duration.  
Based on the totality of the data across the SARS-CoV-2 rS clinical development program, the 
applicant therefore considers that Nuvaxovid is an effective vaccine with an acceptable safety profile, 
and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh its known and potential risks. 
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. 
The applicant has provided consolidated quality, non-clinical and clinical data packages for review 
under the rolling review procedure. For all the finished clinical studies, final study reports have been 
submitted for assessment; for the ongoing studies, study protocols, interim reports, and/or other data 
available at the point of granting the Conditional Marketing Authorisation have been provided. As 
further data becomes available, the applicant is committing to submit those without unnecessary delay 
to complete the Marketing Authorisation. Similarly, all currently available quality data have been 
provided for assessment. Any quality data not yet available at the point of granting the Conditional 
Marketing Authorisation will be provided in accordance with the post-authorisation measures and the 
list of recommendations and specific obligations. Furthermore, safety of the product will be closely 
monitored, and updated data delivered. The applicant does not anticipate any reason for being unable 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 17/168 
 
 
 
to fulfil the agreed post-authorisation measures but commits to notify any delay in its ability to meet 
the agreed deadlines. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed. 
Based on the serious impact of COVID-19 disease on public health, caused by the spread of SARS-CoV-
2 world-wide, prevention of the disease is being sought through the development and use of effective 
vaccines. Currently, the following vaccines are authorised in the EU: Comirnaty, Spikevax, COVID-19 
Vaccine Janssen and Vaxzevria. The currently authorised vaccine products have all been authorised 
following demonstration of a positive benefit-risk balance; however, there remains an urgent need to 
deliver further vaccine supplies to meet demand in both the European Union and globally. Therefore, 
there remains an urgent need to supply vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 disease in the EU/EEA 
population, as well as to meet global demand for vaccine supplies and obligations for vaccine 
distribution. This includes the supply of vaccines through equal access schemes, such as the COVAX 
programme, co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Global Alliance 
for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI), and WHO, which aims to provide global equitable access to 
COVID-19 vaccines across the globe. The increased vaccine supplies and consequent increased 
vaccination in EU/EEA, as well as outside of this region will help to decrease the emergence of new 
variants and/or its spread across the world, including the EU/EEA geographical area. The applicant 
therefore believes that there remains an unmet medical need for Nuvaxovid. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. 
Clinical evidence to date indicates that Nuvaxovid is effective in preventing COVID-19 disease. Data 
from various countries with high vaccination rate are showing that vaccination is not only preventing 
the disease of COVID-19, but also limiting the spread of the virus. The applicant considers that 
decreasing the number of patients suffering from COVID-19, as well as the spread of the virus, will 
save thousands of lives as well as have a positive impact on health care systems, both financially and 
by increasing capacity and focus on standard care for other diseases. It will have also positive impact 
on long term mental health, which deteriorated globally during the COVID-19 pandemic period. In 
addition, pandemic measures, depending on their severity, have significant economic impact in EU/EEA 
and the rest of the world. According to the WHO´s COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response 
Plan for 2021, vaccine availability, accessibility, and deployment are the highest health, social, 
economic, and political priorities for virtually every country, agency, business and community around 
the world. The applicant intends Nuvaxovid to be used in prophylactic way to prevent disease or avoid 
severe cases. Therefore, the benefits to public health of the immediate availability of the product 
outweigh the risks of further additional data requirement.

2.4.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
The active substance (company code NVX-CoV2373) is the protein product of a recombinant SARS-
CoV-2 S-gene encoding the 1260 amino acid spike protein (the full length 1273 amino acid protein 
minus the signal peptide). The SARS-CoV-2 viral envelope consists of multimers of the spike (S) 
glycoprotein which mediate receptor binding and membrane fusion with the host cell. The S gene was 
codon optimised for expression in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells from a full-length, prefusion, 
stabilised SARS-CoV-2 S genetic sequence. A total of five amino acid changes were introduced, 
including three in the S1/S2 furin cleavage site (RRAR to QQAQ) and two in the HR1 domain where 2 
proline substitutions (2P) were inserted at residues K986P and V987P, respectively. It is stated that 
these mutations were introduced to stabilise the protein. The virus strain name is Wuhan-Hu-1 and 
was collected from the Wuhan seafood market in December 2019. Purified recombinant spike (rS) 
glycoprotein forms trimers which bind with high affinity to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 
(hACE2) receptor. The 13 amino acid signal peptide is not present on SARS-CoV-2 rS and thus the rS 
is 1260 amino acids. The SARS CoV-2 rS protein has 22 known glycosylation sites which results in a 
heterogenous glycoprotein with a theoretical molecular weight of 163,997 Da. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
The active substance is manufactured, tested and released at Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. 
(SIIPL). The facilities involved are Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. Hadapsar, Pune - 411028, 
Maharashtra, India and Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. Manjari BK, Tal -Haveli, Pune-412307, 
Maharashtra, India. 
The SIIPL site was inspected by MHRA, UK. Evidence of GMP compliance was based on the GMP 
certificate issued by MHRA. This has been updated in October 2021 based on an assessment of the 
new facilities to be used for the manufacturing of Nuvaxovid.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls  
The SARS-CoV-2 rS Protein active substance is produced in a Sf9 insect cell line by using a 
recombinant baculovirus system.  
A comprehensive description of the commercial scale active substance production process performed at 
SIIPL is provided, comprising details of process inputs and outputs for each upstream and downstream 
operation unit. 
The active substance manufacturing process starts with the revival, expansion and production of the 
Sf9 cells from the working cell bank (WCB) into shake flasks followed by bioreactor/ fermenter using 
serum-free medium (SFM). The cells are infected by baculovirus inoculum (BVI). The spike proteins are 
expressed on the surface of the Sf9 cells. At the end of the growth phase, the cells are harvested by 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 19/168 
 
 
 
centrifugation followed by extraction using a non-ionic detergent low pH treatment (4.0 ± 0.1), 
neutralisation and clarification by centrifugation (of neutralised lysate) followed by depth filtration and 
0.2 μm filtration. The clarified lysate is subjected to a purification process that includes anion exchange 
chromatography, nanofiltration and affinity chromatography. The affinity chromatography eluate is 
subjected to concentration and diafiltration using tangential flow filtration (TFF) and final 0.2 μm 
filtration to obtain a purified SARS-CoV-2 rS protein active substance. 
No reprocessing is allowed. Sanitisation procedures and storage conditions for chromatographic 
columns are described. 
Each operation unit / process step is described in sufficient detail; the corresponding operating 
parameters together with their ranges are indicated. 
Whilst overall the process is considered adequately controlled, the applicant has committed to explore 
possibilities to further optimise the manufacturing process with regard to removal of impurities 
(Recommendation 1). 
The batch numbering systems are adequately described. At SIIPL, the intended batch size and 
expected yield of active substance is stated. The conditions and transport procedures from Hadapsar to 
Manjari sites are adequately described. 
The recommended storage temperature of SARS-CoV-2 rS Protein active substance is ≤ -60ºC. 
Control of materials 
Raw materials 
A listing of the raw materials used in the manufacturing process of the active substance is provided. All 
the listed raw materials are tested in compliance with their respective monographs. The release 
specifications of raw materials released based on the supplier certificate of analysis and/or tested with 
in-house developed specifications are also provided. No raw materials of animal or human origin are 
used during the manufacturing process of the active substance. There are three materials of biological 
origin used in the active substance process, namely Insect Cell Media (yeast), Nutrient feed (soy), and 
Affinity Resin The method of preparation of media, buffer, and/or solvents used in the manufacturing 
process along with their process scale/size, method of sterilisation (0.2 μ filtration), and storage 
conditions is presented. Appropriate quality agreements are in place between the applicant and the 
supplier of the proprietary media and supplements.  
The manufacturer utilises certain single use components that have product contact. The consumables 
are divided into the following categories – flasks, filters, bags/containers, tubing/ancillary component. 
The list of single use items used is provided.  
Baculovirus 
A complete list of raw materials used for the production of the baculovirus vector is presented, 
including details of the step where it is used, its supplier, source and certificate of analysis. No 
materials of animal or human origin were used during the manufacturing process of the baculovirus 
vector or the master virus stock (MVS). 
Information about the preparation of the recombinant baculovirus vector is provided, comprising 
information about the source of the genetic sequence, procedures for the generation of the vector, 
transfection and preparation of primary virus (P1) and pre-master virus stock (PVS, P2).

The S-protein is a trimeric glycoprotein of 1273 amino acids. The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein wild type 
(wt) sequence was downloaded from GenBank sequence MN908947 nucleotides 21563-25384. The S 
gene was codon optimised for high level expression in Sf9 insect cells and biochemically synthesised by 
Genscript (Piscataway, NJ, USA). Three mutations (RRAR to QQAQ) were made in the S1/S2 furin site 
of the full-length wt SARS-CoV-2 S protein along with two additional mutations, K986P and V987P, to 
stabilise the protein as shown in Figure 3 and Table 1). 
Figure 1: Full-length Spike Protein Construct 3Q-2P SARS-CoV-2 rS (BV 2373) 
The wild type SARS-CoV-2 S full length S gene was cloned in the pBacSV40 plasmid with a 5’ 
polyhedron promoter and a 3’ SV40 polyA sequence. The virus strain name is Wuhan-Hu-1. The 
sequence of the glycoprotein gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. The pBacSV40 plasmid 
containing wild type SARS-CoV-2 S with the QQAQ and PP sequence was confirmed by DNA 
sequencing. Information about the function of the individual structural elements of the plasmid is 
provided.

The plasmid containing the SARS-CoV-2 rS gene was transfected into Sf9 cells using a cationic lipid 
transfection reagent to produce recombinant baculovirus BV2373. The recombinant baculovirus was 
plaque-purified. The virus was harvested and filtered through 0.45 um cellulose acetate syringe filters 
(P0 virus stock). 
The primary virus (P1) was prepared in Insect medium by infection of Sf9 cells from the WCB with 
virus eluted from individual plaques (P0). The P1 virus stock was selected for manufacturing of the PVS 
based on the rS protein expression and virus titre results. The stock vials were stored in liquid 
nitrogen.  
The PVS (P2) was prepared in Insect medium by infection of Sf9 cells from the WCB with virus from 
primary virus P1. The PVS was selected for stability testing and for future GMP manufacture of the 
Master Virus Stock. 
Data (virus titre, expression of rS protein production) show that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 rS P1 is 
genetically stable at least up to P6 when virus stock is produced using a specified multiplicity of 
infection (MOI). The applicant committed to determine the sequence for the PVS, MVS, working virus 
stock (WVS) and the virus in the culture harvest collected from the production bioreactor and send the 
report and certificates of analysis, as available (Recommendation 4).

The virus banking system consists of an MVS and WVS. The MVS is generated from the PVS. WVS is 
generated from the MVS and is the material that will be used for manufacture of the baculovirus 
inoculum (BVI). The MVS may also be used to make BVI. Production of a new WVS will be prepared 
from the current MVS Batch. 
The testing program and results for the MVS and WVS are presented and is in accordance with the 
relevant Ph. Eur. monographs. Testing includes controls for mycoplasma/spiroplasma, mycobacterium, 
adventitious agents (NGS), virus titre, sterility and nucleotide sequence analysis. Future batches of 
WVS will be manufactured using an identical manufacturing process from the specified MVS. These 
future batches of WVS will be tested using release and additional characterisation tests. Analytical 
methods deployed for the virus stocks are sufficiently described. The testing program for the MVS and 
WVS includes a test for adventitious agents by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). NGS was 
performed to determine if any adventitious agents are present and as a replacement for the Ph. Eur. in 
vivo and in vitro assays, animal and cell culture assays. The applicant was requested to further justify 
this approach taking into account the Ph. Eur. 2.6.16 requirements as regards the risk assessment and 
demonstrating/validating that the NGS method enables an unequivocal decision to be made as to 
whether compliance with the standards of the Ph. Eur. 2.6.16 monograph would be achieved if the 
official methods were used for the qualification/release of MVS and WVS. Further information has been 
provided about the (calculated) sensitivity of the NGS method using the number of genomes detected 
in the NGS study. According to the applicant, the level of NGS detection is between < 1 to about 450 
TCID50/mL which is said to be consistent with in vitro limits of detection. However, this does not seem 
to be consistent with published data of LOD of at least 1 TCID50 on at least one cell line1. However, the 
NGS for testing the seed virus is considered acceptable considering that the unprocessed harvest will 
be tested by the in vitro methods. Furthermore, the applicant committed to submit the results of the 
ongoing characterisation of baculovirus seed virus by in vitro, in vivo and in ovo adventitious agents’ 
tests January 31, 2022 (Recommendation 2). Also, the applicant has committed to update the risk 
assessment to consider all studies, justifications and technical considerations for the use of NGS 
testing and to ensure that it reflects the current control strategy and viral clearance study results as 
part of a post-authorisation commitment. This evaluation will also include comparison of the in vitro 
pharmacopeial method to the NGS test method. The risk assessment will be used to drive the 
analytical control strategy. The complete risk assessment is expected in Q2 2022 (Recommendation 
3). 
The release testing of the MVS and WVS has been adequately described. The applicant has committed 
to provide a stability testing plan for the MVS and WVS by 1 March 2022 (Recommendation 5). 
Cell bank 
Sufficient information is provided about the source history and generation of the Sf9 cell substrate.  
Sf9 cell banks contain cells from the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera; butterflies 
and moths). Sf9 cells were derived from cells purchased in 1988 from the American Type Culture 
Collection (ATCC) that were adapted to grow in suspension culture in serum-free medium. The 
preparation of the pre-master cell bank, master cell bank (MCB), working cell bank (WCB) and end-of-
production cell bank (EOPCB), is described. Beginning with a specified WCB Lot, the cells were 
manufactured using animal derived component free Insect medium. Prior to this lot, the WCBs were 
produced in Insect medium (containing cholesterol and cod liver oil). 
Details are provided on the WCB preparation, including media, cell culture conditions/duration, cell 
passages, freezing conditions

No materials of human origin were used during the pre-master cell bank or MCB manufacturing 
processes. Materials of biological origin include the Sf9 insect cells of the pre-MCB. In addition, the 
Insect cell culture medium also used other specified materials of biological origin for MCB production. 
The cell bank is extensively tested for identity and absence of adventitious agents which is in 
accordance with Ph. Eur. monographs and ICH guidelines. Testing of cell banks includes controls for 
sterility, mycoplasma, mycobacterium, spiroplasma, endotoxin, in vitro adventitious agents, in vivo 
adventitious agents, in vitro assay for bovine virus, karyotype, isoenzyme, Type C particles, retrovirus 
(reverse transcriptase activity), co-cultivation, product enhanced reverse transcriptase, cell growth, 
virus replication, PCR assay for detection of specific porcine and bovine viruses. Massively parallel deep 
sequencing (NGS) was performed on the WCB lot in order to characterise the Sf9 cells due to reports 
in the literature of the presence of Rhabdovirus sequences in other Sf9 cells lines using this method. All 
cell banks have tested negative for viruses, with the exception of the Sf9 Rhabdovirus which is known 
to be present in Sf9 cells (please refer to adventitious agents section). It was sufficiently justified that 
additional tests for cell morphology, contaminating cells and tumorigenicity is not needed. Some 
further details / confirmation were requested to assure the testing of the cell bank is in compliance 
with the Ph. Eur. requirements and WHO recommendations. The viral testing strategy for the 
qualification of the cell banks is considered robust using cell culture techniques using appropriate 
detection cell lines, NGS tests and specific PCR tests for relevant viral contaminants. Overall, the 
testing is in line with Ph. Eur. testing requirement (and consistent with WHO guidelines). 
A brief description of the analytical procedures deployed is provided. This is acceptable. 
Data demonstrate that the MCB has remained stable for 12 years to date. Studies using end-of-
production cells support the use of the Sf9 cell line for active substance production. The applicant has 
further clarified and justified the control of maximum passage level during routine production. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical process parameters (CPPs), in-process controls (IPCs) and critical quality attributes (CQAs) are 
defined. An assessment of the quality attributes of SARS-CoV-2 rS protein active substance was 
performed after Phase 3 clinical trials, including the analytical tools available to monitor those 
attributes and the strategy for using the tools. Evaluation of QAs is based on risk assessment using the 
principles of Quality by Design (QbD) described in ICH Q8, Q9, Q10 and Q11. In general, relevant QAs 
are discussed and classified as CQAs. 
During development of the SARS-CoV-2 rS manufacturing process, a risk assessment was performed 
to identify process parameters that have the potential to affect product quality or process performance 
when varied from their set point. Process parameters (inputs) that were identified to impact product 
quality (based on their potential to impact a CQA) were given a presumptive classification of “critical” 
and were included in the Process Characterisation plan. Parameter operating ranges were defined 
through process development experimentation and by leveraging platform knowledge gained through 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (RSV-F) and quadrivalent Nanoparticle Influenza Vaccine 
(qNIV) active substance process characterisations. 
All process control and performance parameters are listed. If the results for critical process controls are 
outside of the acceptable ranges or limits, a deviation will be raised and an investigation of the 
deviation event will be performed, including an assessment of any potential impact on product quality. 
The disposition decision will be determined based on the outcome of the deviation investigation. 
The following attributes are controlled to maintain the quality and specification of the active substance: 
control of starting materials viz., use of well-characterised Sf9 cell banks and recombinant baculovirus 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 23/168 
 
 
 
stocks/ virus seeds, control of incoming raw materials and components/ consumables, control of design 
of the manufacturing process and operating process parameters and in-process controls. 
For each operation unit/step, the set points, normal operating range (NOR), proven acceptable range, 
and parameter type/classification (non-key process parameter (NKPP), key process parameter (KPP), 
key process attribute (KPA)) for each process parameter (PP) is indicated together with a range 
justification. The NORs, PARs, and target set points are established using process characterisation 
studies and manufacturing process data. Justification has been provided about the classification of PPs 
and IPCs.  
Hold times for BVI and in-process pool materials are sufficiently supported by process 
characterisation/validation studies. Based on the hold time study, the proposed hold times for the BVI 
and intermediates can be considered conservative. 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
A stepwise strategy for defining and validating the manufacturing process of the active substance 
produced at SIIPL through the process life cycle, i.e. stage 1 - process design, stage 2 - process 
qualification, stage 3 - continued process verification following process performance qualification (PPQ) 
throughout the commercial life cycle of the product). 
Process characterisation of active substance was performed in parallel with the PPQ campaign at SIIPL 
as part of a non-traditional approach to enable rapid deployment of a manufacturing process of 
commercial production, in response to the current global pandemic. The process validation campaign 
was performed with the equipment intended for the commercial active substance manufacturing 
process.  
Two process validation studies were conducted at SIIPL at the commercial scale utilising cell culture 
medium A and cell culture medium B. 
Each analytical procedure was selected based on the knowledge acquired through the combination of 
characterisation, manufacturing history, clinical experience and safety and quality requirements. 
Validation of analytical procedures was performed in accordance with the principles outlined in 
ICHQ2(R1). 
Additional supportive studies were performed prior to or concurrent to the PPQ campaign to support 
process validation. These comprised studies on stability of the Sf9 End of Production Cells, WVS hold 
time studies, buffer biochemical stability studies, process intermediate biochemical stability studies, 
resin lifetime and re-use studies, residual impurities (including for process-related impurities and 
residual DNA), viral clearance studies, extractables and leachable risk assessments and filter validation 
studies. Summaries of these studies are provided. The presented HCP clearance studies showed 
significant HCP reduction by the active substance purification process. However, the reported HCP 
values did not represent the absolute HCP values as the applied assay has previously shown non-
specific reactivity and as such was not reliable for absolute quantitation. The assay for HCP is under 
development. When the suitable assay is qualified, it will be used to demonstrate in-process HCP 
clearance (Recommendation 17). HCP levels were investigated at the active substance level by 
peptide mapping/mass spectrometry (MS) and SDS-PAGE (please refer to discussion on comparability 
and characterisation). It is noted that the studies in support of impurity removal capability for other 
process-related impurities were performed at another specified site which is not part of the MAA. It has 
been demonstrated that the conclusions reached from these small scale studies confirming satisfactory 
process removal capacity for process-related impurities are also applicable to the commercial SIIPL 
process. The applicant has committed to submit the pending spiroplasma test results for the Bioreactor 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021

Crude Harvest post-authorisation (Recommendation 6). In addition, the applicant has committed to 
provide the PPQ HCP-data when available (Recommendation 7) and to submit a protocol describing 
the resin lifetime verification at full scale (Recommendation 8). 
Collectively, the PPQ data overall provides scientific evidence that each stage of the active substance 
manufacturing process, when executed according to the production batch records, consistently 
produces an active substance that meets its product specification. Each process performance 
qualification study met the pre-defined acceptance criteria in the respective study protocol with the 
results demonstrating a controlled process that is deemed validated. However, to further address the 
assurance of the impurity profile, the applicant has committed to explore possibilities to further 
optimise the manufacturing process with regard to removal of impurities (Recommendation 1). 
Demonstration of the process remaining in a state of control will be conducted through continued 
process verification. 
Manufacturing process development 
Extensive information is provided about the manufacturing process development. The active substance 
processing steps were developed based on the platform technology that Novavax has used for other 
vaccine candidates including RSV-F and qNIV.  
The active substance manufacturing process development is complex and comprises batches produced 
for clinical studies and qualification of the commercial process. These batches have been produced at 
multiple sites using different versions of the active substance manufacturing process.  
A summary of Novavax’s manufacturing lots used in clinical studies is provided. Lots were 
manufactured in the US at Emergent BioSolutions, Inc (EBSI) and Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies 
(FDBU). Lots manufactured and their respective use to date are described.  
Non-Clinical Batches Produced at Novavax 
The information provided on the non-clinical batches is limited to lot name, date of manufacture, 
amount produced and estimated purity (SDS-PAGE). However, the active substance process applied for 
these non-clinical batches was based on the process developed for the RSV vaccine with slight 
adaptations which are unlikely to impact on the quality profile when compared to the material used for 
the first clinical studies. With the vast experience gained from the phase 1, 2, and 3 human clinical 
studies, there seems little merit in requesting further quality related information for the non-clinical 
batches. 
Manufacturing Process Changes for Batches Produced at Emergent (EBSI) 
Changes implemented between batches within the active substance manufacturing campaign for 
clinical trial supply were assessed to have a low risk of impacting product safety and quality. The 
changes introduced during the EBSI campaign concerned harvest start criteria, harvest method, 
increase in cell density target for dilution, changes to the cell lysis step, and a change in virus stock 
used to infect the production culture from MVS to BVI.  
Manufacturing Process Changes for Batches Produced at Fujifilm Diosynth (FDBU) 
The identified changes for the transfer of the manufacturing process from EBSI to FDBU commercial 
scale were deemed to be low or no risk requiring no mitigation strategy to demonstrate no product 
quality impact. Changes were introduced at the stage of Sf9 cell culture (upscaling), BVI preparation, 
harvesting method, low pH treatment of cell lysate, changes in clarification process, several changes in 
chromatographic and filtration steps and increase in active substance target concentration. Most 
CHMP assessment report

Page 25/168 
 
 
 
 
changes were aimed to increase production capacity and increase of product purity. Changes were also 
introduced into the control strategy to further assure process robustness. 
Manufacturing Process Changes for Batches Produced at Serum Institute of India (SIIPL) 
The process was transferred to SIIPL. For commercial purposes, SIIPL has scaled-up the active 
substance process. Additional changes were made to the baculovirus production (scale-up) and 
infection step (reduced MOI), cell culture media, harvest and clarification procedures and a change to 
the supplier of an excipient.  
Demonstration of comparability 
In order to demonstrate comparability of the active substance from different manufacturing sites, the 
applicant established the following approach. Each lot was assessed against the current version of the 
appropriate lot release protocol for the active substance. All lots had to fall within the lot release 
acceptance criteria for the site. In addition, characterisation data were compared to characterisation 
data from at least three active substance PPQ lots. Results from characterisation assays were expected 
to fall within the specified acceptance criteria to be considered comparable.  
A direct comparison between EBSI (clinical batches used in clinical studies 2019nCoV-101 (Phase 2 
AU/US) and 2019nCoV-302 (Phase 3 UK)) and SIIPL process/product is not available. The applicant’s 
strategy was to demonstrate comparability between EBSI and FDBU (pre-PPQ clinical material used in 
2019nCoV-101 (Phase 2 AU/US) and 2019nCoV-301 (Phase 3 US/MX)), between FDBU pre-PPQ and 
PPQ and between FDBU PPQ and SIIPL. Indirectly, the comparability between EBSI and SIIPL would 
then be substantiated. The rationale for this staged approach is that clinical trials in US and Europe 
were similarly staged i.e. initiated using EBSI material and then using FDBU material in the US/Mexico 
Phase 3 trial. Comparability was therefore initially assessed between EBSI clinical material and FDBU 
clinical material. 
Active substance comparability studies included both active substance batch release tests and 
additional characterisation tests.  
A comprehensive set of physico-chemical and biological analytical methods have been applied which 
cover quality attributes relevant for the demonstration of comparability. 
Comparability between EBSI and FDBU 
Multiple changes were introduced during active substance process development, the overall process 
remains the same across sites. For each change the rationale and risk assessment is provided which 
are overall considered acceptable. 
Several changes have been introduced at the upstream and downstream stages which increased 
product purity. 
Extensive comparability testing results are provided and discussed in more detail. The number of 
batches are generally considered sufficient to reach a conclusion on comparability between the 
materials.  
In view of the complexity of the active substance, some variability between batches produced at the 
different sites may be expected. It is noted that some of the differences are indeed intended 
(increased purity, different protein and PS80 content).  
Purity (expressed as %rS and %gp64) is tested by peptide mapping/mass spectrometry (MS) and is 
considered indicative of an overall higher gp64 content in the FDBU lots when compared to EBSI lots. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 26/168 
 
 
 
According to the applicant, the HCP identification (MS) showed that the predominant impurity for the 
FDBU lots is gp64 whereas the predominant impurity for the EBSI lots is an Sf9 protein which is also 
present in FDBU lots at lower levels. However, multiple other baculovirus related and other HCPs were 
detected. As such, the purity cannot be determined only by the percentage of gp64 present. It is noted 
that both EBSI and FDBU materials were used in the Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials and as such the purity 
profiles of both EBSI and FDBU materials are supported by the safety data obtained and considered to 
be clinically validated.  
There are differences in average particle size, size distribution and higher order oligomer content 
between the EBSI and FDBU materials. According to the applicant, particle size and morphology of the 
active substance have a moderate impact on efficacy. Active substance particle formation is reversible 
and dependent on formulation conditions, temperature, and time. The risk of impact on clinical 
performance is considered to be low as Phase 3 clinical experience is available covering a wide range of 
particle size and morphology.  
There is a higher potency trend seen in FDBU lots which could be related to the potency assay (ELISA) 
applied. While there is a higher relative range for the FDBU lots as compared to the EBSI lots using the 
original binding ELISA, all FDBU lots used in the clinical trial were within the original limits of the ACE2 
receptor binding ELISA assay. 
Comparability between FDBU pre-PPQ and PPQ 
Multiple Phase 3 clinical studies were conducted using pre-PPQ active substance material produced at 
FDBU. The changes introduced between pre-PPQ and PPQ are limited and mainly in the upstream 
processes. The totality of the data for all of these analyses demonstrates overall comparability of the 
materials manufactured at FDBU prior to PPQ and the materials produced for PPQ.  
Comparability between FDBU and SIIPL 
Data from the active substance PPQ lots produced at SIIPL were compared against those generated for 
the FDBU PPQ lots, thereby creating a link back to the clinical trial material. 
The most notable difference in the results for various lots is the higher potency (as tested by hACE2 
receptor binding ELISA) and faster binding kinetics association rates for the SIIPL lots compared to the 
FDBU lots. According to the applicant, the slight increase in active substance potency is not likely to 
affect the efficacy of the vaccine and needs to be considered in the context of acceptable finished 
product potency justified by clinical studies and process performance capabilities. The applicant 
considers that minor differences observed in the ka (association/binding) rate for different active 
substance lots produced at different sites are most likely due to the assay variability and not due to 
differences in the quality of the active substance. 
As regards to active substance purity (as measured by peptide mapping/MS taking only protein 
impurity gp64 into account), the applicant considers that the SIIPL PPQ lots fell well within the range of 
rS content tested in the clinical studies and that, while lot to lot differences can be seen, on average, 
the PPQ lots from both FDBU and SIIPL manufacturing sites are considered comparable. When 
considering all protein impurities, and not only gp64, SIIPL batches do seem more pure than FDBU 
(and EBSI), both by peptide mapping/MS and SDS-PAGE. The purity data for EBSI batches are not 
directly comparable with FDBU and SIIPL batches as different methods have been used. EBSI batches 
are not available anymore for retesting. The FDBU and SIIPL batches have been tested with the SDS-
PAGE method that is used for release. The FDBU batches represent a worst-case situation with purity 
for specified lots. 
It is concluded that the SIIPL lots are not considered fully comparable from a quality perspective for 
potency and binding kinetics when compared with the EBSI/FDBU materials used in the clinical studies. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 27/168 
 
 
 
Similarly, it is concluded that the SIIPL active substance batches have higher purity when compared to 
active substance batches used in preparation of finished product batches applied in phase 2 and phase 
3 clinical studies and hence comparability is not demonstrated for this quality attribute. However, 
these differences can be justified as they are not expected to have an adverse impact on safety or 
efficacy profiles. According to ICH Q5E, in these circumstances, pre- and post-change product can be 
considered comparable. This is further supported by the results from clinical study 2019nCoV-101 
(two-part phase 1/2 randomised observer blinded study designed to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373). Although higher frequencies of local and systemic reactogenicity 
occurred in participants receiving the higher antigen dose (25 μg) compared to the lower antigen dose 
(5 μg), the safety profile was overall considered acceptable. In this respect, it should be noted that the 
proposed upper limit for protein content is significantly lower than the 25 μg/0.5 mL dose used in the 
phase 1/2 studies. 
The particle size distribution ranges overall are comparable, but comparability regarding average 
particle size is uncertain. This is however not expected to have an impact on safety or efficacy. 
The applicant has further justified why the trimeric nature of the protein has not been addressed for 
comparability. The Gen1v2 potency assay specifically measures binding of hACE2 receptor dimers to 
protomers within the rS trimers and is considered the key functional assay to ensure proper folding of 
rS and integrity of the receptor binding domain. Potency testing is included in all analytical 
comparability studies. 
Characterisation 
Structural characteristics of the rS protein have been investigated using different orthogonal methods. 
Characterisation studies were performed with EBSI and FDBU active substance. An overview of the 
batches included in the different characterisation studies has been provided. No SIIPL batches were 
included in the analysis. However, most of the methods that were used for characterisation were also 
used for the comparability assessment between FDBU and SIIPL batches.  
Primary structure: SDS-PAGE showed a main band between 98 and 198 kDa, which was detected by 
the antibody on Western blot and thus confirmed the identity of the rS protein. Peptide mapping with 
MS revealed the correct primary structure. A longer hydrophobic domain near the C- terminus amino 
acid 1192 – 1245) was not confirmed by peptide mapping MS, the applicant has committed to develop 
an improved method and provide further data on the C-terminus peptide (Recommendation 11). 
Furthermore, it was shown that 18 out of 22 glycoform attachment sites were glycosylated with high 
mannose or pauci-mannose structures. Deamidation and succinylation was detected at Asn501 and 
methionine oxidation was not detected. Oligosaccharide profiling by HPLC-FLD confirmed that the 
glycoforms were mainly high mannose (Man3F) and pauci-mannose forms. The data presented from 
three EBSI and three FDBU batches indicates that the EBSI and FDBU batches have slightly different 
oligosaccharide abundance; the FDBU batches contain more Man3F and Man3 and less Man8 and Man9 
than the EBSI batches. The applicant has committed to characterise the glycosylation profile for the 
next 10 batches manufactured at SIIPL and based on the data obtained to present an evaluation on 
the need for any further monitoring or control of the glycosylation profile (Recommendation 12). 
The secondary structure was revealed with Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) and differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC). The DSC revealed improved thermal stability over the native S-protein. Secondary 
structure as revealed by Far-UV CD and DSC was comparable between EBSI and FDBU batches. No 
verification of the secondary structure by confirmation of the expected disulphide bond configuration 
has been provided. The applicant has committed to develop a method to confirm the expected disulfide 
bonds (Recommendation 13).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 28/168 
 
 
 
Higher order structure was investigated by Size Exclusion Chromatography coupled with in-line UV and 
Multi-Angle Light Scattering detection (HPSEC-MALS) and Asymmetrical-Flow Field-Flow Fractionation 
with MALS detection (AF4-MALS). The active substance is expected to be comprised of rS trimers, 
dimers of trimers, and other oligomeric forms. This was confirmed by the HPSEC-MALS 
chromatograms, in which a continuum of oligomeric rS forms was seen and by the AF4-MALS 
chromatograms, in which a broad population of large particles was observed. Differences in the 
HPSEC-MALS chromatograms were observed between EBSI and FDBU batches. In addition, capillary 
electrophoresis - sodium dodecyl sulfate (CE-SDS) data and SDS-PAGE data provide information on 
size heterogeneity of the rS active substance. Non-reduced CE-SDS shows, according to the applicant, 
three major peaks that correspond to molecular weights expected for monomer, dimer, and trimer 
forms of rS in the vaccine. However, the MW information for CE-SDS has not been verified by the use 
of protein standards. Based on this an improved CE-SDS method is under development, which is 
different than the CE-SDS method used during the early stage of development. The applicant has 
committed to develop this CE-SDS method and provide identification of the peaks in the final 
electropherogram and to include a discussion of the data and final confirmation of the molecular 
weights (Recommendation 14). Similarly, the HPSEC-MALS method under development is intended 
to provide a qualitative assessment of the various structures present in the active substance and not to 
address the distribution of monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric forms of rS. The applicant has committed 
to develop the HPSEC method further to normalise protein concentrations prior to sample injection and 
to include the use of appropriate molecular weight standards (Recommendation 15). 
Particle characteristics were investigated by Dynamic light scattering (DLS), Nanoparticle tracking 
analysis (NTA), Negative-stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Single-particle cryo-EM. 
The DLS analysis showed that hydrodynamic diameter of rS particles from EBSI batches was smaller 
than from FDBU batches. EBSI batches were more homogenous, and FDBU batches showed more 
polydispersity. The TEM analysis demonstrated that the active substance particles consist of rS trimers 
and PS80 micelles that form a complex. The ACE2-receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein 
faces outward from a core of PS80 molecules with the rS C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane 
region facing toward the micelle interior. This arrangement of multiple rS trimers around a PS80 core is 
referred to as a rosette. With Cryo-EM, intertrimer interactions between rS proteins were observed 
resulting in higher order spike multimers. 
A summary of the current knowledge on particle morphology has been provided and the main 
conclusions made are: 1) The key immunologic component of the active substance is the rS trimer, 2) 
The particles are dynamic and help to preserve rS in a soluble state in the active substance, 3) Particle 
morphology for the active substance, within the manufacturing process variability, is not linked to 
finished product immunogenicity and therefore not considered to be a CQA. 
Physico-chemical properties: The development of an MS method for confirmation of MW is ongoing 
(Recommendation 16). Existing data confirming the theoretical extinction coefficient as well as 
information on protein content was provided. 
The biological functionality of the rS protein was confirmed by measuring the rS binding to hACE2 
receptor by biolayer interferometry (BLI) and by ELISA, and by a mouse model of immunogenicity to 
demonstrate the ability of rS to elicit functional and neutralising antibodies. BLI revealed a very tight 
binding between the rS protein and the ACE2 receptor. The mouse model of immunogenicity showed 
that rS protein in EBSI lot DS2 was immunogenic and elicited functional antibodies in mice (anti-S IgG, 
hACE2-receptor binding inhibiting antibodies, and neutralising antibodies). The mouse immunogenicity 
method has been revised and several studies using force-degraded rS to evaluate whether this assay is 
capable of distinguishing sub-potent batches has been conducted. In studies, this mouse 
immunogenicity model distinguished between intact and degraded samples in mice immunised with a 
low dose of rS with Matrix-M adjuvant in a manner that generally corresponded with the in vitro 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 29/168 
 
 
 
potency measures. The mouse immunogenicity test is not intended for use in product release, 
comparability evaluation, or stability testing and will be used as a research investigational tool. 
Product-related impurities 
In forced degradation studies, a decrease in the binding assays (ELISA, BLI and protein ELISA) without 
an effect on particle size (by DLS and HP-SEC) and fragmentation (SDS-PAGE and Western Blot) is 
observed after exposure to high pH (8.5), whereas after exposure to low pH an effect on the binding 
assays, and increase in particle size and degradation on SDS-PAGE and Western Blot is observed. 
Thermal stress also had a significant effect on binding assays, and resulted in an increase in particle 
size, but without an effect on degradation. Proteolysis had an effect on all assays but less on the 
protein ELISA, which is a monomer-specific ELISA, showing that the binding of the monomer was less 
affected. Oxidation, freeze-thaw and agitation did not affect any of the assays. There is no strong 
correlation between deamidation or succinimide post-translational modifications and biological activity, 
and a more general disruption of epitopes in rS protein during thermal stress is likely the cause of 
decrease in biological activity. The oxidation, deamidation and succinimide variants are considered 
product-related substances. In summary it can be concluded from the forced degradation studies that 
the binding assays and DLS are stability-indicating assays.  
Stressed samples were selected for in vivo evaluation to determine the correlation between in vitro and 
in vivo potency. A good correlation exists between in vivo and in vitro potency, except for the sample 
that was degraded by proteolysis. Although in vitro potency was decreased, the fragments were still 
immunogenic. 
Regarding fragments, the applicant clarified that low molecular weight species (~140 kDa) observed 
correspond to the theoretical molecular weight of the unglycosylated spike protein and are not 
considered a fragment. Other low molecular weight species are present in low amounts and therefore 
not of concern. The low abundance of monomeric form of rS has been verified by a monomer-specific 
ELISA quantitation assay. 
Process-related impurities 
On SDS-PAGE the most abundant protein in active substance batches besides the rS protein is the 
baculovirus (BV) gp64 protein. In addition, other LMW bands are visible on high load SDS-PAGE gels. 
The SDS-PAGE shows that more gp64 is present in FDBU batches than in EBSI batches and in EBSI 
batches greater quantities of other HCPs and other BV proteins are present than in FDBU batches. For 
gp64 this was confirmed by (semi-quantitative) Mass Spectrometry.  
Other residual host cell (Sf9) proteins and baculoviral proteins were evaluated using a proteomics-
based HCP-MS method. Relevant HCPs and the abundance in the pre-PPQ and PPQ FDBU batches have 
been identified. Gp64 is the most abundant HCP from BV, and the only other BV protein seen among 
the top 15 most abundant proteins. There are 5 host cell proteins (Sf9 and BV combined) above a 1% 
relative signal intensity in all batches investigated. From the data presented, it is clear that the gp64 is 
the most abundant HCP for most batches. However, there are differences from batch to batch in which 
HCPs are most prevalent when considered relative to the total Sf9 and BV proteins identified.  
For release, purity is assessed by SDS-PAGE combined with densitometric scanning. No other methods 
for the estimation of purity and impurities are in place. During the procedure a major objection was 
raised in relation to limitations of the proposed control of purity and the applicant was asked to provide 
further evidence that SDS-PAGE with densitometric scanning is a sufficiently quantitative and accurate 
method to control purity. In addition, the applicant was asked to further justify the proposed 
specification limit and to develop additional methods for control of purity. In response, the applicant 
provided additional data and justifications to support the SDS-PAGE method suitability and proposed 
acceptance limit. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 30/168 
 
 
 
The release test for purity is an important test to control on the one hand the amount of rS protein 
that will be present in the finished product (in combination with total protein), and on the other hand 
the level of impurities, like HCPs. Only impurities above the limit of quantitation will be included in the 
overall purity calculations by SDS-PAGE. Initially there was a concern that several different impurities 
are present at or below the limit of quantitation, which altogether contribute substantially to the level 
of impurities, but remain undetected. However, the proposed control of purity using the SDS-PAGE 
method is considered acceptable, based on the considerations below:  
An acceptable safety profile has been shown for the FDBU batches tested in clinical studies. These 
batches are considered worst-case with respect to impurity levels, compared to commercial batches. In 
addition, five-time higher doses of 25µg also showed an acceptable safety profile (see manufacturing 
process development section for further details). The FDBU and SIIPL batches have been tested for 
purity with the SDS-PAGE method that is used for release. The FDBU batches represent the worst-case 
situation. Considering the purity levels of the batches used in clinical studies, and the purity levels of 
SIIPL batches, the specification for purity of rS content is acceptable.  
HCP assessment via MS is currently being evaluated to characterise the 7 most abundant HCPs 
(including gp64) observed in the active substance. The applicant committed to implement the method 
and set preliminary specification limits already after testing 10 active substance lots 
(Recommendation 18). This test will provide additional control on impurities. A comparison between 
MS and SDS-PAGE data for both FDBU and SIIPL active substance lots will be provided 
(Recommendation 22). Until the MS method can be implemented, gp64 is controlled through the 
SDS-PAGE method currently used for active substance release. Justified acceptance criteria are 
proposed based on the data available. Furthermore, a CE-SDS based purity method and HCP ELISA will 
be developed (Recommendations 14 and 17). Additionally, rS integrity is controlled also by the 
potency testing. In the presence of the strong adjuvant there is a theoretical concern of immunological 
molecular mimicry, potential induction of an immune response against the epitopes on these proteins. 
To address this theoretical concern, the most abundant HCP / HVP will be screened for an overlap in 
epitopes with human proteins (Recommendation 10). 
Considering the additional data and justifications provided and noting the commitments of the 
applicant to further improve the control of purity and impurities, the major objection raised was 
considered resolved. 
Levels of DNA in the active substance batches are low and therefore considered to be acceptable, both 
for total DNA and for BV DNA and sf9 DNA. It is acceptable that DNA levels at release are controlled by 
Total DNA using picogreen detection.  
Infectious baculovirus is controlled at release. The detection limit of the plaque method is acceptable. 
The active substance contains polysorbate 80 and phosphate buffer and an investigation regarding low 
endotoxin recovery (LER), including spike-recovery studies will be performed to further confirm 
absence of endotoxin. (Recommendation 21). 
Conclusion 
Overall, sufficient information on the characterisation of the molecule has been provided to support the 
conditional marketing authorisation. A number of post-authorisation commitments have been agreed 
with the applicant (recommendations) to provide data to further substantiate this conclusion.

Specification 
The active substance specifications include general tests (appearance, pH, PS-80), protein concentration, 
identity  (by  western  blot),  purity  (SDS-PAGE),  potency  (ELISA),  residual  DNA  and  safety  tests 
(endotoxin, bioburden, mycoplasma/spiroplasma, harvest contamination).  
For release, purity is assessed by SDS-PAGE combined with densitometric scanning. Please refer to the 
characterisation section for a discussion on the control of purity. The applicant is also recommended to 
implement a shelf-life specification for purity by SDS-PAGE (Recommendation 24). Upon introduction 
of the CE-SDS method for purity testing the applicant should also implement justified acceptance 
criteria for active substance and finished product release and stability testing (Recommendation 14). 
Identity is controlled by Western Blot, which is considered acceptable. 
The applicant is recommended to re-evaluate the total protein specification limits when 30 commercial 
scale lots have been manufactured (Recommendation 23). 
Potency testing is performed with an ELISA in which the amount of rS protein that binds to the hACE2 
receptor, which is coated on the plate, is measured. Potency is established relative to a reference 
standard. Throughout development, the ELISA assay was improved. Notably, Zwittergent was added to 
diminish interactions between the trimeric proteins and PS-80 that could influence the potency 
estimation for active substance batches. Active substance batches manufactured at FDBU and at SIIPL 
have been retested with the improved assay, using the same reference standard and thereby allowing 
a comparison between the potency results of FDBU and SIIPL batches. The potency of SIIPL batches 
were higher than the potency of FDBU batches, possibly caused by the higher purity of SIIPL batches. 
Potency results of batches of both manufacturers have been used to establish the acceptance criteria 
which is considered acceptable. 
Contaminant testing is performed at the harvest level by bioburden testing. Adventitious agents testing 
is performed by cell culture method on 4 cell lines.  
Analytical methods 
For compendial methods, the type of procedure is mentioned and reference is made to the Ph. Eur. 
Non-compendial methods are described in sufficient detail. For all methods acceptable system 
suitability criteria are provided and the preparation of standards and samples is described. Methods are 
validated in line with ICH Q2 (R1). For some methods additional validation data remain to be 
submitted (Recommendations 19 and 20). 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of active substance batches manufactured as SIIPL (n=6) has been provided. The 
results are within specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
The Reference Standard which is currently used for the potency assay is an intermediate reference 
standard. This standard was prepared from representative active substance and was calibrated against 
active substance used in the Phase 3 clinical studies. This provides a link between the reference 
standard and clinical study material. A protocol has been provided for the calibration of the new 
primary and working reference standard. After calibration, the new primary reference standard will be 
bridged against the intermediate reference standard and previous Reference Standard. Please refer to 
the finished product section for further discussion on this point. 
Container closure system 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 32/168 
 
 
 
Adequate information is provided on the container closure system. The dossier includes references to 
relevant Ph. Eur. monographs for the primary packaging materials. The active substance is stored in 
sterile, single-use Flexible Freeze Thaw Bags at ≤ -60 oC. The FFT bag is chosen based on the 
established historical extractable and leachable data provided by the supplier and additional Novavax 
studies performed in the context of a previous product development. Extractables and leachables 
studies have been performed under worst-case conditions, the results being acceptable from a 
toxicological point of view. The choice of the container/closure is justified, also based on the results of 
active substance stability studies. It has been sufficiently demonstrated that the container closure 
system provides adequate protection from microbial contamination.  
Stability 
The proposed shelf life for the active substance is 9 months stored at <-60 oC.  
Stability studies on an adequate number of active substance batches produced according to the 
commercial process are on-going and available results were provided. Studies have been performed in 
accordance with relevant ICH stability guidelines.  
Two batches of SARS-CoV-2-rS active substance manufactured at FDBU together with 6 batches 
manufactured by SIIPL were placed on stability. The batches were manufactured according to the 
proposed commercial process and filled in the proposed commercial container closure system. 
A description of the stability batches is provided. The primary stability batches are under evaluation at 
real time (Long term) storage conditions of ≤ -60 oC and accelerated conditions (5 oC ± 3 oC). Relevant 
quality attributes are part of the active substance stability testing protocol, including tests for 
appearance (colour, clarity, particulates), pH, protein concentration, purity (SDS-PAGE), potency 
(ELISA) and identity (Western Blot). It is noted that the SIIPL batches placed on stability are 
additionally tested for PS80 content, total DNA and residual infectious baculovirus. It is questionable 
whether the latter two can be considered stability indicating. The applicant has been requested to 
introduce a stability test for control of particle size, such as DLS. As the DLS method is currently not 
validated, the applicant has committed to initiate the method development and validation work with a 
target completion date of Q3 2022. In the meantime, particle size for SIIPL will be monitored in order 
to establish an appropriate release and shelf-life specification for the z-average particle size 
(Recommendation 38). 
FDBU active substance lots remain within specification after 9 months when stored at long-term 
conditions (-70ºC ± 10ºC). No significant changes in purity (SDS-PAGE) are discernible under these 
conditions. 
Limited stability data is available for the PPQ lots produced at the commercial site, SIIPL.  
Stability testing results are available for FDBU samples stored under accelerated conditions (5°C ± 
3°C) conditions and stress conditions (25% ± 2/60% ± 5% RH for 1 month and at 40° ± 2°C/75% ± 
5%RH for 1 week). For SIIPL lots limited data is available for samples stored at 5°C ± 3°C. 
As concluded in the manufacturing development section, FDBU and SIIPL lots cannot be considered 
fully comparable as regards to purity and potency. Hence, the FDBU stability data cannot be 
considered fully supportive until further data is provided. In this respect, it is noted that thermal stress 
studies are underway and will be used to confirm that the degradation products and rates are 
comparable between active substance produced at FDBU and SIIPL. Assays included appearance, pH, 
SDS-PAGE (purity), Protein Concentration (SoloVPE), potency ELISA and DLS (Recommendation 9). 
In addition, one batch of SARS-CoV-2 rS active substance will be placed on stability each year.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 33/168 
 
 
 
Stability studies will be conducted at ≤-60 oC (long term conditions) for annual testing and under 
accelerated conditions at 2-8 oC, if a significant process change is made. 
The applicant has committed to report any unexpected trends or out of specification results for the on-
going stability studies for FDBU and SIIPL lots. Updated stability data for active substance samples 
stored under long-term and accelerated conditions are awaited in January 2022 (Recommendation 
25). 
Overall, limited data have to date been provided in support of the proposed 9 months shelf life for 
active substance when stored at <-60 oC. However, considering the initial data provided and the low 
temperature proposed for long-term storage it is not expected that the quality of the vaccine will be 
significantly impacted during storage under these conditions. Therefore, in conclusion, the 9 months 
shelf life for active substance when stored at <-60 oC is considered to be acceptable. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
Description of the product

2 Matrix-M consists of Fraction-A (42.5 micrograms) and Fraction-C (7.5 micrograms) components and the 
excipients of cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, potassium chloride, disodium 
hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, sodium chloride, and water for injections. 
3 Phosphatidylcholine contains 0.1 – 0.2% α-Tocopherol (all-rac-α-Tocopherol) (according to the specification). 
4 There are no Ph. Eur. and BP monographs for Disodium Hydrogen Phosphate Heptahydrate. Disodium hydrogen 
phosphate heptahydrate referred to as Sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate on supplier CoA. Sodium 
dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate referred to as Sodium phosphate monohydrate monobasic on supplier CoA. 
The recommended storage conditions of finished product is 2°C to 8°C and the intended route of 
administration is intramuscular injection. 
The finished product is formulated on the basis of the total protein concentration of the active 
substance and a 5% overage is used to compensate for any potential loss during finished product 
manufacturing. The vials are filled with a minimum of 6.0 mL to ensure that 10 doses of 0.5 mL can be 
withdrawn.  
Novel excipient – adjuvant 
Matrix-A and Matrix-C contain purified, chromatographic fractions (A and C) of enriched purified bark 
extract from the tree Quillaja saponaria Molina, as well as cholesterol, from botanical origin, and 
phosphatidylcholine, from hen’s egg yolk. The Matrix-A and Matrix-C adjuvant components, assembled 
from a specified and controlled batch formula of saponin, cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine, are 
regularly shaped, uniform and stable complexes (nanoparticles). Matrix-A and Matrix-C are 
nanoparticles suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cholesterol and Phosphatidylcholine are 
present as excipients in the Matrix solutions. 
The processes of Fraction isolation and Matrix formulation have been described in sufficient detail. The 
controls of the materials used for the manufacture of both Matrices are acceptable. The process control 
strategy is based on a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) risk assessment and is appropriate. 
The impact of technical transfer and scale-up of Matrix-A and Matrix-C product has been adequately 
evaluated by comparing analytical data of the matrices produced by processes performed at AGC-
Copenhagen, AGC-Seattle and Novavax, Uppsala to analytical data obtained from analysis of Matrix-A 
and -C produced at a validated smaller scale process at Novavax, Uppsala (used for clinical study 
material).  
Characterisation has been conducted with several orthogonal methods for chromatographic profile (RP-
HPLC-UV), identity ( HPLC-MS, 1H-NMR, 2D NMR), monosaccharide analysis , haemolytic activity, 
particle size (DLS, Multi-angle DLS), and structure (TEM).  
The impurities related to the manufacture of Matrix A and C have been adequately discussed. Forced 
degradation studies show that Matrix-A and Matrix-C are robust formulations.  
The control specification comprises tests for appearance, identification, concentrations of saponin (SA), 
cholesterol (CH) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), saponin purity, residual detergent N-Decanoyl-N-
methylglucamine, pH, average particle size, ratio CH/SA, ratio SA/PC, bioburden and endotoxins. A 
suitable justification has been provided for replacing a haemolytic activity test with the test for 
cholesterol/saponin ratio. The proposed tests are acceptable. The applicant has committed to revise 
the specifications when more batch data are available and to merge the currently separate release and 
shelf-life specifications into one single specification (Recommendation 45). The shelf-life will also be 
reviewed based on the updated specification and stability data (Recommendation 46).  
Adequate information has been provided for the reference standards used in the analysis of Matrix-A 
and Matrix-C. 
Adequate information on the composition, quality references and control of the two container closure 
systems for the matrices has been provided. The applicant is however recommended to update the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021

control specifications to further align with the Guideline on plastic immediate packaging materials 
(Recommendation 44). In view of the conducted initial risk analysis, the gap analysis for the 
polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) bottle packaging components and the toxicological evaluation 
of extractables, the risk of critical presence of leachables in the matrices is considered low. The 
initiated leachables study is appropriate. The post-authorisation commitment to submit the report of 
the 2-year leachables study for the PETG bottle is acceptable (Recommendation 42). In view of the 
conducted risk assessment and compliance of the contact layer ultra-low density polyethylene (ULDPE) 
with Ph. Eur. 3.1.5, the risk of presence of critical leachables in the matrices is also considered low for 
the ULDPE biocontainer bags. The protocol of the verifying study is acceptable (Recommendation 
43). The post-authorisation commitment to submit the results of the study is acceptable.  
The proposed shelf life for Matrix-A and Matrix-C is acceptable based on real time (5±3°C) stability 
data from six batches of Matrix-A and three batches of Matrix-C manufactured at Novavax. For the 
commercial scale batches, 6 months results are available (5±3°C and 25 °C/60% RH).  
Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product presentation has evolved during clinical development. For the Phase 1/2, Part 1 
study, SARS-CoV-2 rS antigen was filled separately and used for bedside mixing with Matrix-M1 
adjuvant prior to administration. All follow up clinical studies were performed using SARS-CoV-2 rS 
pre-mixed with Matrix-M1 adjuvant. The overall composition of the formulation buffer remained the 
same throughout the development to the commercial stage, with only differences in the ratio of 
monobasic to dibasic sodium-phosphate salts and differences in PS80 grade used. 
Formulation development started with exploring three different formulations based on other 
recombinant vaccines and the most optimal one was selected for further development. Subsequently, 
variations in the formulation composition were studied with the objective of optimising the selected 
formulation. Results of these formulation studies indicate that the initial formulation was the optimal 
formulation for minimising loss in potency and aggregation of the SARS-COV-2 rS antigen. No 
additional work was done to develop a formulation containing a preservative. This is understandable 
and acceptable in view of the urgent need for Covid-19 vaccines. Exploratory stability studies were 
subsequently performed to select suitable glass vials of different suppliers.  
The presented in-use stability studies indicate adequate physico-chemical stability of left-over finished 
product (after removal of 9 doses) in Type I glass vials during the proposed 6-hour in-use shelf-life at 
2-25 oC. One of the specified vial types will be used for commercial production at SIIPL. The applicant 
is recommended to conduct further evaluation to confirm whether or not the upper limit of the finished 
product pH range is relevant for compatibility. (Recommendation 36). 
The applicant provided a study demonstrating that long lasting agitation results in an increase in 
particle size and particle size distribution and causes some damage to the trimer spike proteins. The 
applicant is recommended to perform a shipping qualification study in order to evaluate the real-world 
impact of movement/ vibration/ agitation on the quality of the vaccine (Recommendation 26). 
It is noted from the Applicant’s information that Matrix-M1 adjuvant is prone to stability issues 
(aggregation) in some glass vials due to leaching of silicon and boron. Therefore the applicant has 
provided data to demonstrate that the selected vials are compatible with Matrix-M. Differences in glass 
quality between compatible and incompatible glass vials can be identified by the expansion coefficient 
of the glass.  
Manufacturing Process Development Overview 
Formulated finished product for use in early phase clinical studies was manufactured at EBSI at a 
suitably defined batch size. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 36/168 
 
 
 
The finished product batches used in the two pivotal 2019nCoV-301 and 2019nCoV-302 are provided. 
Two finished product lots manufactured at EBSI were used in the Phase 3 clinical study in the UK. The 
active substance used for EBSI finished product lots was manufactured by EBSI. 
Two finished product lots that were used in the clinical Phase 3 studies in US/Mexico have been 
manufactured at Par Sterile Products (PAR). The manufacturer of active substance for PAR lots was 
FDBU.  
The finished product manufacturing process employed at SIIPL was developed based on prior product 
knowledge and manufacturing technology received from Novavax. The process is conducted in a fill-
finish plant, which routinely fills other vaccines (primarily COVID-19 vaccines) into a similar container 
closure configuration and has also a historical record of aseptic process and practices. The process 
knowledge and practices are followed at the Manjari site for commercial scale manufacture. In order to 
complete the comparability exercise, an analytical comparability study was completed for the batches 
manufactured at EBSI and PAR used in the clinical studies. The strategy to demonstrate comparability 
of finished product manufactured at SIIPL to finished product lots used in the clinical studies is shown 
in Figure 2. 
Figure 2: Comparability between finished product Manufactured at EBSI and PAR 
Two lots manufactured at EBSI (material used in the phase 3 UK study) and two lots manufactured at 
PAR (material used in the phase 3 US/Mexico study) were included in the first comparability study. 
Besides the origin of the active substance, the major changes in the finished product process between 
EBSI and PAR include the antigen formulation target concentration, the manufacturing scale, and the 
vial (single dose versus multidose vials). 
Analytical methods used for comparability are finished product release tests (appearance, pH, 
osmolality, total protein, potency by SARS-COV2-rS binding ELISA Gen1v1, identity by western blot, 
Matrix-A content, Matrix C content, sterility, endotoxin) and additional characterisation tests. i.e, 
cholesterol concentration, phosphatidylcholine concentration, saponin integrity, particle size by 
dynamic light scattering, negative stain TEM and 2D class averaging, microflow imaging and 
nanoparticle tracking analysis. In addition, degradation of finished product lots was evaluated after 
storage under accelerated conditions.  
Comparability data indicate that total protein content, estimated spike protein (rS) content and 
potency of both lots used in the phase 3 UK study are lower than in the lots used in the phase 3 
US/Mexico study. These differences can at least partly be explained by the difference in formulation 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 37/168 
 
 
 
 
 
  
strategy (total protein + 5% overage for UK study versus total rS protein, calculated by multiplying the 
active substance protein concentration and purity, for the US/Mexico study). As both clinical phase 3 
studies showed similar results, these differences can be considered clinically qualified.  
Comparability between finished product manufactured at PAR and SIIPL  
The subsequent comparability study assessed comparability of the clinical lots manufactured at PAR 
with the SIIPL initial development scale lots, development/manufacturing scale PPQ lots and the 
commercial scale PPQ lots.  
The SIIPL manufacturing processes at each scale of manufacturing are essentially the same with 
minimal differences. The assessment compares test results of release tests and additional 
characterisation tests, as well as a comparison of results of accelerated stability studies. The design of 
the comparability study is similar to that of the study between finished product manufactured at EBSI 
and PAR as described above.  
Because of change of reference preparation and test method, comparability between the potencies of 
the clinical PAR finished product batches and the SIIPL batches could only be compared indirectly. This 
was performed in two different ways. Additional details can be found in the specification section below. 
All data indicate that the SIIPL lots have a higher potency than the PAR clinical lots, which is consistent 
with the comparability results at the level of the active substance. The increase in potency is not 
expected to impact clinical outcomes. This is supported by the results of phase 1 / 2 study 2019nCoV-
101.  
Based on batch release results, results of characterisation tests and the preliminary results of the 
comparative accelerated stability studies, it is concluded that clinical finished product manufactured by 
PAR is comparable to finished product produced at SIIPL. The applicant is recommended to provide an 
updated analytical comparability report for finished product manufactured at PAR and SIIPL as 
additional characterisation and stability data become available (Recommendation 29). 
Container closure system, microbiological attributes, compatibility 
The container and closure system for Nuvaxovid finished product is Type I glass vials closed with 
bromobutyl rubber stoppers and an aluminium seal. The material of constructions of the vial and 
rubber stopper conform to pharmacopoeial standards. An extraction study has been performed. The 
applicant is recommended to further provide leachable studies for the finished product in vials and 
stoppers (Recommendation 27). 
The vaccine is presented as a non-preserved product in a multi-dose vial. The applicant is proposing a 
6 hour in-use shelf-life after the first puncture of the 10-dose vial, when stored between 2 to 25°C. 
Microbial growth studies presented showed no significant increase in growth for all test organisms 
during the first 24 hours at 2-8 oC and at 20-25 oC, indicating that the formulation does not support 
rapid microbial growth. However, conditions in clinical practice differ from the controlled conditions 
during in-use stability studies. Therefore, the SmPC indicates that from a microbiological point of view, 
after first needle puncture, the vaccine should be used immediately. If the vaccine is not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. 
A study conducted to evaluate the stability of the finished product in syringes shows that the finished 
product is chemically stable for at least 6 hours at both 2-8°C and 25°C when stored in a 
polypropylene syringe. The applicant is recommended to provide data of a supporting short-term 
stability study that includes both polypropylene and polycarbonate syringes under various potential 
extended in-use environmental conditions, such as hold temperature, agitation stress that may occur 
during transportation of syringes and indoor lighting (Recommendation 28).

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Finished product is manufactured, tested and released at the SIIPL Manjari site. Batch control 
testing will be performed by KBI Biopharma Leuven, Belgium, Bilthoven Biologicals B.V., Bilthoven, 
Netherlands and Novavax AB, Uppsala, Sweden. Batch release will be performed by Novavax CZ, 
Jevany, Czech Republic and Bilthoven Biologicals B.V., Bilthoven, Netherlands. Compliance with 
GMP has been appropriately documented for all sites. 
In the initial application, the proposed commercial finished product manufacturing sites included the 
SIIPL Hadapsar facility and the SIIPL Manjari facility for the commercial process. Subsequently, the 
applicant indicated that the Hadapsar facility has not yet been established for commercial 
production. Consequently, commercial finished product production will only be performed at the 
Manjari facility.  
The manufacturing process is described in sufficient detail, including the equipment and materials 
used, formulation calculations, critical and non-critical process parameters with operating ranges/set 
points and in-process controls. The process is straightforward, i.e., preparation of the formulation 
buffer, thawing (if applicable) and pooling of the active substance, preparation of Matrix-M adjuvant by 
mixing Matrix-A and Matrix-C, preparation of the co-formulated final bulk, sterile filtration of the co-
formulated bulk to the filling machine (isolator), filling and finishing. Vials are sterilised and 
depyrogenated in a tunnel at a minimum of 280 oC for NLT 3 mins and the rubber stoppers in an 
autoclave at 122 ± 1 °C for 30 minutes.  
All critical steps are adequately controlled. A number of in-process controls are proposed for the 
manufacturing process and these are considered satisfactory. The co-formulated bulk is an 
intermediate and is tested and released. The applicant is recommended to perform a bulk hold time 
study and to provide stability data for the intermediate hold time of not more than 24 hours 
(Recommendation 31). 
PPQ results are presented for batches consecutively manufactured at the Hadapsar facility and PPQ 
batches consecutively manufactured at the Manjari facility. Results are provided for critical process 
parameters, routine in-process controls, extended characterisation of the formulated bulk, batch 
homogeneity and batch analysis results. The PPQ studies confirm that the full scale commercial process 
performs effectively and is able to produce a finished product meeting its predetermined controls and 
acceptance criteria.  
The applicant is recommended to submit the final process validation report for the commercial scale 
finished product manufacturing process at the Manjari premises once the results of the labelled lots 
(appearance, identity) are in place (Recommendation 30). In addition, the applicant is 
recommended to provide a completed investigation of the increased endotoxin level in a specific PPQ 
batch (Recommendation 32). This increased endotoxin level is close to the specification. As the 
specification is well below the Ph. Eur. endotoxin safety limit, there is no risk for the patient from this 
increased endotoxin level. 
Product specification 
The finished product specifications (add reference) includes general tests (appearance, pH, osmolality), 
protein concentration, identity (by western blot), potency (ELISA), content of Matrices A and C, safety 
tests (endotoxin, bioburden), extractable volume and container closure integrity (CCIT).  
Since the rationale and justification for excluding specific quality attributes from the finished product 
specification was lacking in the application, a number of concerns were raised on the proposed 
specifications. No test is included for purity and the applicant is recommended to establishing a release 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 39/168 
 
 
 
and shelf life purity specification for finished product (Recommendation 33). The absence of tests for 
subvisible particles, for the haemolytic activity of Matrix-A and Matrix-C, and for saponin integrity have 
been properly justified. Polysorbate 80 concentration cannot be measured in the finished product for 
release or stability because of interference in the assay by oleic acid residues originating from the 
adjuvant. The applicant is recommended to include dynamic light scattering to control the particle size 
distribution of the finished product, which is mainly determined by the Matrix–A and Matrix–C 
complexes of the adjuvant (Recommendation 38). The applicant is also recommended to established 
a two-sided specification for osmolality and to re-evaluate the total protein specification limits once 30 
finished product batches have been manufactured (Recommendations 23 and 34). Furthermore, 
the applicant is recommended to perform the container closure integrity test as described in the US 
Pharmacopoeia (Recommendation 35). 
The initially proposed lower acceptance criterion for potency was based on the release potency of a 
clinical batch that was recalculated to the current reference preparation. Because of change of 
reference preparation and test method, a direct comparison of finished product potencies could not be 
made. Instead, a conversion factor was used. The recalculation factor could not be accepted as it was 
based on the Gen1v1 potency assay, which was abandoned because of too high potency readouts and 
replaced with the Gen1v2 potency assay. A major objection was raised requesting an adequate 
bridging between the two reference preparations to be able to rely on data generated with the old 
potency assay and reference preparation. In response to the major objection, the applicant increased 
the lower limit for the finished product potency based on the measured Gen1v2 potency values for the 
active substance used to manufacture finished product for the US/Mexico Phase 3 study. This approach 
removes the reliance on the conversion factor and is considered acceptable. The adjusted lower limit is 
considered justified. Nevertheless, it is still considered essential that the applicant calibrates the old 
and the new reference standard against each other in the Gen1v2 potency assay in the presence of 
Matrix-M1. Once bridged, the finished product release and shelf-life acceptance criteria of the potency 
assay should be reviewed and updated as appropriate. This data is considered necessary to firmly link 
the potencies of finished product batches used in clinical phase 3 studies and commercial batches and 
ensure consistent product quality. It is therefore requested as a Specific Obligation (Specific 
Obligation 2). 
No new impurities / degradation products are formed during the finished product manufacturing 
process. 
The applicant has provided a nitrosamine risk evaluation in line with EMA/369136/2020 and EMA 
Questions and Answers document EMA/409815/2020 for the finished product. Currently identified 
potential sources of nitrosamines impurities have been adequately addressed by the applicant, 
supporting the conclusion that there is no identified risk or the presence of nitrosamine impurities in 
Nuvaxovid finished product. 
Analytical methods 
For compendial methods, appropriate reference is made to the Ph. Eur. Non-compendial methods are 
described in sufficient detail. Validation reports were provided for western blotting, potency by ELISA 
(both Gen1v1 as Gen1v2), Matrix A and Matrix C content by RP-HPLC-UV and qualification reports for 
the compendial sterility and endotoxin tests, and total protein concentration by CBQCA (3-(4-
carboxybenzoyl)quinoline-2-carboxaldehyde). A validation report for the CQQCA method remains to be 
submitted (Recommendation 37). 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis results are provided for three batches manufactured at the Hadapsar premises, three 
PPQ batches manufactured at the Hadapsar Premises, and three commercial scale PPQ batches 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 40/168 
 
 
 
 
manufactured at the Manjari premises according to the commercial process. Batch analysis results 
comply with the specification and confirm acceptable consistency. Some variability in relation to 
potency was observed.  
Reference materials 
The SARS-CoV rS reference standard is used as comparator in the western blot analysis, and as 
reference standard in the total protein analysis by CBQCA, and relative potency assay by ELISA. The 
reference standard is prepared from an active substance batch. It’s preparation and calibration are 
suitably described (please refer to the active substance section). For the quantitative finished product 
assays the reference standard is mixed with Matrix-M to mimic the finished product formulation. This 
approach is acceptable. As discussed above as part of a specific obligation the applicant should 
calibrate the potencies of both reference standards against each other in the Gen1v2 finished product 
assay. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf-life for the finished product is 9 months at 2-8°C.  
This is supported by long term stability studies for 10 months of a PAR clinical batch, 9 months of a 
PAR clinical batch, 3 months of stability data for three PPQ batches manufactured at SIIPL and one 
month of stability data for three commercial-scale PPQ batches manufactured at SIIPL. Data from PAR 
can be considered as representative of commercial product since comparability to the SIIPL lots has 
been demonstrated. 
In addition, accelerated studies (25 ± 2°C) were performed the above mentioned batches and stress 
studies (40 ± 2°C) for the PAR clinical batches. Both clinical PAR batches were stored in upright and 
inverted position and the SIIPL batches in inverted position only. This is acceptable as the inverted 
position can be considered worst-case.  
The clinical PAR lots were tested for appearance, pH, osmolality, sterility, potency by ELISA, protein 
concentration, identity, Matrix A and Matrix C concentration, cholesterol concentration, 
phosphatidylcholine concentration, saponin integrity and particle size. Commercial lots were tested 
against the stability specification (appearance, pH, osmolality, sterility, container closure integrity, 
relative potency, protein concentration, identity). The testing panels include appropriate stability-
indicating methods. In addition, results of characterisation tests are provided for commercial lots. 
Testing frequency is appropriate.  
Clinical batches manufactured at PAR met all specifications up to 10 months, at long term conditions 
(2°C to 8°C). A downward trend in potency is observed, which is not statistically significant. 
Furthermore, for one clinical batch the protein concentration results at 5, 6, 9 and 10 months are part 
of an ongoing out of trend investigation. This is also the case for another clinical batch at 6, 7, 8 and 9 
months. The investigation is still ongoing. The applicant confirmed that the out of trend of protein 
concentration is method related and not product related and this is considered acceptable. The 
applicant is nevertheless recommended to provide the full investigation report of the atypical low 
protein concentration results (Recommendation 40). 
The degradation rates for PAR and SIIPL did not show statistically significant differences for the critical 
quality attributes (pH, osmolality, identity, total protein concentration and potency). The applicant is 
recommended to update the statistical analysis of long-term stability results as additional data 
becomes available for on-going stability studies for SIIPL and PAR finished product lots 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 41/168 
 
 
 
(Recommendation 41). The applicant is also recommended to provide a separate stability protocol to 
describe the post-authorisation stability program (Recommendation 39). 
A photostability study was performed according to ICH Q1B using finished product manufactured by 
PAR. It can be concluded that the product should be stored in the original carton in order to protect 
from light. However, results show that short term (24 and 72 hours) exposure to visible light is not 
detrimental to product quality. A shelf life of 9 months at 2-8 °C is accepted based on the supporting 
data. However, the applicant is required to provide monthly updates for the PPQ lots manufactured at 
SIIPL using the specified manufacturing process and three PPQ lots manufactured at SIIPL using the 
commercial scale manufacturing process. This data is required to achieve a comprehensive data 
package and ensure consistent product quality during shelf life and is therefore requested as a Specific 
Obligation (Specific Obligation 1). 
Adventitious agents 
The Nuvaxovid manufacturing process incorporates control measures to prevent contamination and 
maintain microbial control. These controls include appropriate sourcing, testing and control of raw 
materials, cell and virus banks and in process materials. 
Each material is assessed for the risks related to the following adventitious agents as appropriate: 
•  Microbial contaminants including bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma/spiroplasma 
•  Viral contaminants including endogenous and adventitious viral agents 
•  Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy/bovine spongiform encephalopathy agents (TSE/BSE) 
according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human 
Use (CHMP) guideline, Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform 
Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products (EMA/410/01 Rev. 3). 
Controls to ensure freedom from contamination with adventitious agents include: 
•  Use of non-animal derived components and raw materials wherever possible 
•  Verification of the source and origin of components and raw materials (e.g. geographic, chemical, 
biological) 
•  Testing of virus stocks, virus banks, and cell banks for relevant microbial and viral contaminants 
•  Testing of production harvests for the presence of adventitious agents including microbial (including 
mycoplasma/spiroplasma) and viral agents 
•  Incorporation of steps in the manufacturing process demonstrated to remove/inactivate potential 
viral contaminants 
•  Evaluation of the raw materials and primary packaging materials for their risk of BSE/TSE 
contamination. 
•  Process controls (e.g. limits on processing time, filtration of buffers and in process solutions, 
monitoring of bioburden and endotoxin) designed to reduce and control bioburden and endotoxin 
contamination in the process. 
A clear tabulated overview of the raw materials of biological origin used in the production process is 
provided, indicating the stage of manufacture used, source/origin, the risk evaluation performed, and 
certification of origin (as applicable).  
Non-viral adventitious agents 
An adequate control strategy for the control of potential microbial contaminants including bacteria, 
fungi and mycoplasma/spiroplasma has been developed. This covers starting materials (cell banks, 
virus stocks), raw materials, process controls, and product specifications. Together with an appropriate 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 42/168 
 
 
 
GMP adherence (conformed by GMP inspection outcome) microbial quality of the finished product is 
sufficiently assured.  
Based on the presented information, it is agreed that the risk of BSE/TSE contamination of finished 
product is considered negligible. 
Viral adventitious agents 
An adequate control strategy has been developed for the control of potential adventitious (viral) 
agents’ contamination. This comprises starting materials (cell banks), virus stocks, process controls, 
and product specifications. Sf-Rhabdovirus sequences were identified in the WCB by RT-PCR and 
confirmed by MPS-Seq datasets. In addition, low-level positive PCR result for Sf-Rhabdovirus in active 
substance lots were detected, at or below the level of sensitivity of the assays. This can be expected 
because most Sf9 cell lines are contaminated by Sf-rhabdovirus and this is not considered to be a 
concern. Satisfactory clearance of Rhabdovirus was demonstrated in the viral clearance studies. Sf9 
cells are known to contain nucleotide sequences that code for reverse transcriptase (RT). Of note, the 
characterisation of the cell banks to date includes a number of studies that were performed to 
demonstrate that the cell banks are free of infectious retrovirus. According to the applicant, despite the 
fact that RT equivalent to ~1x103 RVLP was detected, there is a low risk of the presence of infectious 
virus for two reasons: the NGS assay was validated and no retrovirus sequences were detected in 
harvest material and the active substance purification process has been proven to offer at least 13.99 
LRV for a model retrovirus (see below viral clearance studies). RT activity detected at levels below the 
sensitivity of the assay could be expected as the test item is manufactured from Sf9 cells and the very 
low level is likely due to non-infectious retrotransposon elements within the Sf9 genome. 
Viral clearance studies 
Based on the information on the raw materials of biological origin used in the production process which 
have a potential to harbour viral contaminants, a robust strategy for virus clearance is needed. 
Convincing viral clearance studies were performed in accordance with ICH Q5A. 
The choice of the identified process steps for virus clearance are considered appropriate.  
The selection of the model/relevant viruses used in the viral clearance studies are sufficiently justified. 
Adequate interference, matrix effects and cytotoxicity studies were performed. The lowest dilution that 
could be evaluated without significant cytotoxicity or viral interference was assessed. 
Sufficient information is provided in support of the scale down model, process parameters and study 
design. Process parameters reflect (worst-case) routine large scale production conditions. 
Based on the totality of evidence, it is agreed that the risk of viral contamination in Nuvaxovid is low 
with a sufficient safety margin as regards the risk of (infectious) viral contaminants present in the 
finished product.  
Post-approval change management protocol  
The applicant included a Post-Approval Change Management Protocol (PACMP) to support addition of 
active substance manufacturing and testing sites to supplement commercial demand. 
The protocol outlines the information to be submitted to request approval for future active substance 
manufacturing sites, to supplement manufacture by the currently approved site SIIPL. Future sites will 
have GMP and MIA certification in place with an appropriate inspection record.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 43/168 
 
 
 
The PACMP defines the required elements to demonstrate overall comparability between the approved 
site and additional sites to achieve consistency and control of the active substance manufacturing 
process and product at the new site in comparison to the approved site. A dual approach is 
implemented to evaluate (1) the active substance manufacturing process via process comparability 
(i.e. process validation) and (2) active substance product via analytical comparability. The active 
substance manufacturing process at the new facility will be compared to the active substance 
manufacturing process at the approved site (SIIPL) to define any potential differences and appropriate 
mitigation, as applicable. The initial marketing authorisation application included data to demonstrate 
analytical comparability of the active substance produced at SIIPL to material manufactured at FDBU, 
where pre-PPQ material at FDBU was used to formulate finished product for Phase 3 trials. The active 
substance at the new facility will be evaluated against the active substance from SIIPL to ensure that 
the biochemical (purity), biophysical (structural), and biological (potency) properties of the final active 
substance at the new facility is comparable. As requested, 3-way comparability for the active 
substance will be performed, comparing the active substance from the new facility to material both 
from SIIPL and the clinical manufacturing site FDBU. Upon request during the procedure, the PAMCP 
was revised and considered generally in line with the EMA Q&A on post-approval change management 
protocols (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/586330/2010). 
In the initial application three additional PACMPs were included. These related to an additional finished 
product and adjuvant manufacturing and testing sites and to an alternate finished product formulation 
process. Further to concerns raised during the procedure these PACMPs have been withdrawn by the 
applicant. 
2.4.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects 
Quality data to support consistent quality of Nuvaxovid are considered sufficient in the context of a 
conditional Marketing Authorisation in the current (COVID-19) pandemic emergency situation. Having 
considered the emergency situation and the quality documentation provided, the CHMP imposed two 
specific obligations (SOBs) with clearly defined due dates (refer to Conclusions for details). It is 
expected that the applicant will be able to provide the requested data and thereby fulfil the specific 
obligations. Based on the applicant’s plans and documentation, it is expected that data to fulfil the SOs 
will be submitted between February 2022 and end of January 2023. 
During the procedure, two major objections were raised, in relation to the control of purity and 
potency. Additional data have been submitted by the applicant during the procedure in response to the 
major objections and other concerns raised. Further information is provided below on the resolution of 
the major objections and the rationale for accepting some open issues to be addressed as Specific 
Obligations post-marketing. Several other issues, 46 in total, are further highlighted as 
Recommendations (RECs) to be addressed by the applicant post-authorisation. These cover various 
aspects of the active substance, finished product and adjuvant and are detailed in Annex I to this 
report. 
An exemption from Article 51 of Directive 2001/83/EC was sought regarding potency testing of the 
finished product at Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. (SIIPL), 212/2, Off Soli Poonawalla Road, 
Hadapsar, Pune - 411028, Maharashtra, India. Finished product EU-release potency testing will be 
performed at SIIPL until 31st March 2022. From this date onwards, potency testing will be performed 
by a site located in the EU (either the currently approved release testing site KBI Biopharma, 
Technologielaan 8, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium or an additional site which is intended to be added via 
variation post-approval (Novavax CZ a.s. Bohumil 138, 281 63 Jevany, Czechia)). Having considered 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 44/168 
 
 
 
 
the ongoing COVID-19 epidemiological situation, the duration of the derogation and that it is 
acceptable from a quality point of view, this approach was accepted and reflected accordingly in the 
terms of the Marketing Authorisation (Annex II, Section A of the Product Information). 
Active Substance 
During the procedure, a number of issues were raised concerning the process development, 
demonstration of comparability and control of purity. The main points are summarised below. 
Overall,  comparability  data  provided  for  the  full-scale  lots  active  substance  and  finished  product 
manufactured  at  the  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  site  (SIIPL)  Support  a  conclusion  that  the 
commercial product manufactured at SIIPL will be comparable to clinical material. However, the SIIPL 
active  substance  cannot  be  considered  to  be  fully  comparable  as  regards  potency  (i.e.  higher  in 
commercial batches versus clinical batches), binding kinetics and purity when compared to the materials 
used in the clinical studies. These differences can be justified as they are not expected to have an adverse 
impact on safety or efficacy profiles. This is supported by the results from clinical study 2019nCoV-101 
(two-part  phase  1/2,  randomised,  observer-blinded  study  designed  to  evaluate  the  safety  and 
immunogenicity  of  NVX-CoV2373).  Although  higher  frequencies  of  local  and  systemic  reactogenicity 
occurred in participants receiving the higher antigen dose (25 μg) compared to the lower antigen dose 
(5  μg),  the  safety  profile  was  still  considered  acceptable.  In  this  respect,  it  should  be noted  that  the 
upper limit for protein content is significantly lower than the 25 μg/0.5 mL dose used in phase 1/2 study 
material. 
For release, purity is assessed by SDS-PAGE combined with densitometric scanning. No other methods 
for the estimation of purity and impurities are in place. During the procedure a major objection was 
raised in relation to limitations of the proposed control of purity and the applicant was asked to provide 
further evidence that SDS-PAGE with densitometric scanning is a sufficiently quantitative and accurate 
method to control purity. In addition, the applicant was asked to further justify the proposed 
specification limit and to develop additional methods for control of purity. In response, the applicant 
provided additional data and justifications to support the SDS-PAGE method suitability and proposed 
acceptance limit. Based on the responses provided, the proposed control of purity using the SDS-PAGE 
method is acceptable, considering that an acceptable safety profile has been shown for the FDBU 
batches tested in clinical studies and that these batches are considered worst-case with respect to 
impurity levels, compared to commercial batches. The major objection raised was therefore considered 
adequately resolved. Several commitments have also been made by the applicant to further improve 
the control of purity and impurities. 
A  PACMP  has  been  included  covering  future  additions  of  active  substance  manufacturing  sites,  to 
supplement  manufacture  by  the  currently  approved  site  SIIPL.  As  requested,  future  comparability 
exercises for the active substance will include a 3-way comparison, where active substance from the new 
facility will be compared to material both from SIIPL and from the clinical manufacturing site FDBU. 
Finished product 
The finished product is a sterile, preservative-free, aqueous buffered dispersion for injection containing 
the SARS-CoV-2 rS protein as active substance. The active substance is co-formulated with Matrix-M1 
adjuvant and presented in a multi-dose vial containing ten doses of 0.5 mL.  
The potency of the finished product batches used in clinical studies is currently not considered to be fully 
linked  to  the  potency  of  the  commercially  manufactured  batches  at  SIIPL,  raising  uncertainty  in 
comparing the potency of commercial finished product batches with those of clinical batches and defining 
clinically qualified potency limits based on batches used in clinical phase 3 trials. A major objection was 
therefore  raised  during  the  procedure  requesting  an  adequate  bridging  between  the  reference 
preparations used to be able to rely on data generated for the clinical material, using previous versions 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 45/168 
 
 
 
of both potency assay and reference preparation. Based on the clarifications provided by the applicant, 
it can be concluded that the batches manufactured at SIIPL are at least as potent as the least potent 
batch  used  in  clinical  studies.  In  addition,  the  lower  limit  for  the  product  potency  specification  was 
increased, which is considered a conservative approach. However, to further support this conclusion, as 
a  Specific  Obligation,  the  applicant  should  bridge  the  relevant  reference  standard  lots  (i.e.  calibrate 
reference standards against each other in the Gen1v2 finished product assay in the presence of Matrix-
M1) to firmly link the potencies of finished product batches used in clinical phase 3 studies to those of 
commercial batches. Once the references standards are adequately bridged, the finished product release 
and shelf-life acceptance criteria of the potency assay should be reviewed and updated as appropriate 
(specific obligation). 
The  proposed  specifications,  as  demonstrated  by  the  submitted  data,  are  suitable  to  control  product 
quality. Due to the rapid development, real time stability data for finished product are limited but data 
from clinical batches are considered representative to support the shelf life of the finished product. As a 
specific obligation the applicant will provide additional stability data on commercial batches to further 
support the shelf life of the product over the entire storage period (specific obligation). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The data presented to support consistent quality of the medicinal product Nuvaxovid are considered to 
be sufficient in the context of a conditional marketing authorisation in the current (COVID-19) 
pandemic emergency situation. The CHMP has identified specific obligations to address remaining 
uncertainty in relation to quality issues that may have a potential impact on the safe and effective use 
of the medicinal product, and which therefore are needed to achieve comprehensive pharmaceutical 
(quality) data and controls for the product. The specific points that need to be addressed in order to 
fulfil the imposed specific obligations are detailed below.  
SOB 1: In order to ensure consistent product quality during shelf life, the MAH should provide 
additional information on stability of the finished product.  
The MAH should provide additional finished product stability data to confirm the long-term storage period 
of the finished product manufactured at the Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. (SIIPL). Stability studies 
updates, including results of characterisation tests, should be provided post-authorisation for three PPQ 
lots manufactured at SIIPL using the specified manufacturing process and three PPQ lots manufactured 
at SIIPL using the commercial scale manufacturing process, upon availability of data for 3, 6, 9 and 12 
months and completion of the study. Due date: 31 January 2023 with interim, monthly updates beginning 
February 2022. 
SOB  2:  In  order  to  ensure  consistent  quality  over  the  product  life  cycle,  the  MAH  should 
adequately  bridge  the  reference  standards  and  review  the  finished  product  potency  limits 
when additional data become available. 
The MAH should bridge reference standard lots (intermediate reference standard and previous 
reference standard) and the Primary Reference Standard in the SARS-Cov-2 rS binding ELISA 
Generation 1 Version 2 potency assay in the presence of Matrix-M1 adjuvant, to firmly link the 
potencies of finished product batches used in clinical phase 3 studies to those of commercial batches. 
Once bridged, the finished product release and shelf-life acceptance criteria of the potency assay 
should be reviewed and updated as appropriate. Due date: 31 July 2022 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 46/168 
 
 
 
 
the CHMP recommends additional points for investigation, as listed in Annex I of this document. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical program was conducted in consideration of the appropriate regulatory guidelines for 
vaccine development. SARSCoV-2 rS with Matrix-M1 adjuvant vaccine-induced cellular and humoral 
immune response were assessed across multiple species, including rodents and NHPs. Live virus 
challenge studies were performed in mice, hamsters, cynomolgus macaques, and rhesus macaques. A 
standard toxicology program to support vaccine development has been undertaken for SARSCoV-2 rS 
with Matrix-M1 adjuvant. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A number of animal species have been used to test the immune response, i.e. mice, baboons, 
hamsters, cynomolgus monkeys and rhesus macaques 
Mice 
Studies in mice (BALB/c) have been conducted to optimise the protein construct based upon the 
confirmation of the protein and the involvement of an adjuvant. Five studies have been conducted in 
BALB/c mice.  
The first study in mice has been conducted to evaluate the following constructs: BV2365 “3Q” 
comprising a full-length S protein with amino acid substitutions in the S1/S2 cleavage domain and furin 
cleavage site introduced to confer protease resistance; BV2369, “3Q-ΔFP806-815” construct with 
deletions in the hydrophobic fusion peptide; and a receptor binding domain (RBD) construct received 
from Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, California) representing the intact receptor binding domain of 
the SARS-CoV2 S protein only. This study has indicated that the mutations 3Q and 3Q-ΔFP806-815 
introduced in the S protein are insufficient in increasing the immunogenicity of the product. In this 
prime-boost regimen study it emerged that the adjuvant/antigen combinations provided better 
immunogenicity and better protection than the non-adjuvanted antigens. In addition, the Matrix-M1 
adjuvant had a dose-sparing effect, with similar immunogenicity seen for 1 and 10 ug antigen 
adjuvanted with 5 ug Matrix-M1. The enhancing effects of Matrix-M1 adjuvant on antibody production 
were expected based on the applicant previous experience with the Matrix-M1 adjuvant from other 
vaccine programmes (MERS and Ebolavirus), as well as the scientific literature (saponin-based 
adjuvants, so called ISCOM or immune-stimulating complex adjuvants, have been used in a large 
number of vaccine development programmes over the last approx. 40 years). 
In a second study in BALB/c mice three different constructs have been tested with small mutations in 
the spike protein to enhance stability and immunogenicity in the presence of Matrix M1 adjuvant. 
BV2365 and BV2373 were similarly immunogenic by all serology assays performed (anti-S IgG ELISA, 
hACE2 receptor binding blocking ELISA and neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro), while BV2369 
was immunogenic as measured by anti-S IgG ELISA but did not induce functional antibodies able to 
block the spike-ACE2 interaction and neutralise SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. For this latter reason BV2369 was 
excluded at this stage. The remaining 2 lead antigens (BV2365 and BV2373 ie SARS-CoV-2 rS) were 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 47/168 
 
 
 
tested for protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, at 10 ug level, with or without 5 ug Matrix-
M1 adjuvant, in a prime-boost regime. These 2 antigens gave similar protection against challenge with 
SARS-CoV-2 strain. The 2 lead antigens were tested for protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 
challenge, at 10 μg level, with or without 5 ug Matrix-M1 adjuvant, in a prime-boost regime in mice 
sensitised for SARS-CoV-2 by intranasal instillation of adenovirus vector expressing human ACE2. It 
was shown that both constructs protect against the bodyweight loss induced by challenging the mice 
with SARS-CoV2 virus. One of the most sensitive markers for disease appeared to be the body weight 
which was daily measured as recommended in the WHO Guideline 2014. The effects on body weight 
loss clearly showed the protective effect of the vaccine, being more effective after two dosages. The 
more stable 3Q-2P BV2373 construct was chosen to be further developed. In addition, it was shown in 
this study that adjuvant/antigen combinations provided better immunogenicity and better protection 
than the non-adjuvanted antigens and that the Matrix-M1 adjuvant was dose-sparing. 
A third study also tested the SARS-CoV-2 viral challenge in mice pre-treated with an adenovector 
expressing the hACE2 receptor. The effects on body weight loss clearly showed the protective effect of 
the vaccine, being more effective after two dosages. Immunogenicity was maximal and protection fully 
achieved with 10 ug adjuvanted antigen dose, and 1 ug adjuvanted antigen was similarly effective. 
Furthermore, the vaccination strongly induced adequately levels of functional antibodies against the 
SARS-CoV2 spike protein as well as the binding to the hACE2 Receptor. Of note, animals with low and 
suboptimal responses did not show vaccine-associated enhancement of pulmonary pathology. 
The fourth study in Balb/c mice indicated the importance of the adjuvant Matrix M1 in increasing the 
response to SARS-Cov2 spike protein, including stimulation of the cellular immunity. Biomarkers of the 
cellular immunity such as interferon-gamma as well as germinal centre B cells are strongly increased 
by the vaccine-antigen with Matrix M1. This involvement of cellular immunity is important in relation to 
the duration of the immune response. Based on ELISpot and flow cytometry, the antigen-specific recall 
response after immunisation with 10 μg non-adjuvanted antigen was dominated by Th2 cells; in 
contrast, the antigen-specific recall response after immunisation with 10 μg antigen adjuvanted with 5 
μg Matrix-M1 was more directed towards Th1. 
In the fifth study, the applicant compared the Matrix-M1 with Alum as an adjuvant. The Matrix-M1 
adjuvant induced a higher immunogenicity with functional antibodies as compared with the Alum 
adjuvant.  
On the basis of the studies carried out in mice it was concluded that the 3Q-2P protein is able to induce 
an appropriate immune response, which is significantly enhanced by the Matrix-M1 adjuvant. The 
immune response was not only limited to antibody responses but included also an adequate response 
in cell-mediated immunity which was Th1-biased. The immune response is dependent on the dose of 
the antigen rS (3Q-2P protein) in an optimal ration compared to the adjuvant. This ratio might be 
different in various species as the ratio in NHP is around 1 vs. 10, while in rodents it might be higher 1 
vs. 2 or less. The data also showed that the immune response protect against the morbidity of the 
challenge, e.g. loss of body weight.  
The applicant submitted studies to evaluate the mode-of-action of the adjuvant Matrix-M1. These 
studies have been conducted in BALB/c mice, and one in vitro study has been included. The in vitro 
study suggests a mechanism of action of Matrix-M1 which is related to active lysosomal processing, 
indicating that the mode of action of saponins is not related to saponification as such. Accordingly, 
saponins induced specific cellular mechanisms. A study with Ebola Glycoprotein clearly showed that the 
effect of Matrix-M1 was local. Spatial and large temporal separation of the administration of the 
adjuvant from the protein clearly reduced the adjuvant action. Administration in the same area within 
a time-slot of 48 hours is crucial in this respect. Cytokines were produced transiently with a peak 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 48/168 
 
 
 
within 24 hours from administration, with the increase in cytokines preceding the increase in antibody 
response. 
Studies in other species 
Hamsters are susceptible preclinical model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following challenge, mild to 
moderate, transient disease comprising body weight loss, respiratory signs and lethargy is seen, as 
well as pneumonia associated with virus replication in upper airways and lung (Muñoz-Fontela et al. 
Nature. 2020 586(7830):509-515).  
The study in hamsters supports the choice of the antigen in the vaccine, and the added value of the 
use of Matrix-M as an adjuvant. This antigen/adjuvant combination induced a strong protective 
immunogenic response, and a second dose enhanced further the immune response. The administration 
of the antigen/adjuvant combination also strongly reduced viral replication as shown by a reduced level 
of genomic as well as sub-genomic viral RNA in oral swabs. Protection from disease was shown by 
reduced body weight loss and lethargy as well as reduced lung pathology. There was no evidence of 
vaccine-enhanced disease. 
A study in middle aged (10-16 years old) baboons was designed to study the functional 
immunogenicity by measuring the binding of IgGs to the spike protein and to the hACE2 receptor by 
ELISA. The adjuvant enhanced the immune response towards Th1, including activity of CD4+ T cells. 1 
and 10 μg adjuvanted antigen induced similar humoral and functional responses, with 0.1 and 0.01 μg 
antigen levels being sub-optimal (5 μg Matrix-M1 for all antigen doses). A booster injection given after 
a period of 3 weeks, enhanced further the immunogenicity as measured by anti-S IgGs, functional 
antibodies against hACE2 receptor, as well as cellular immunity. Total duration of the study is 245 
days. Immunogenicity against SARS-CoV2 was optimal around day 28-35 after the booster. Afterwards 
it decreased at day 120 and further at day 182, but less when using the adjuvant.  
In another pivotal study, cynomolgus monkeys were immunised with full human dose (5 μg), or higher 
antigen dose (25 μg) with the same dose of Matrix-M1 adjuvant (50 μg). Binding as well as functional 
antibody responses were induced after the first immunisation, and protection against lung pathology 
after SARS-CoV-2 challenge was also seen already after the first immunisation, indicating that some 
protection against disease may be present already after a single immunisation with the vaccine. 
Nevertheless, binding as well as functional antibody responses increased markedly after the second 
immunisation, supporting the 21 day interval prime/boost vaccination regimen used in humans. 
Furthermore, in the vaccinated animals the viral replication of SARS-CoV2 was reduced in upper and 
lower respiratory tract. No evidence of VAERD following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus was seen, even 
in animals which had received suboptimal vaccination regimens. 
A pivotal study in rhesus macaques has applied the full human dose of 5 μg SARS-CoV-2 rS antigen 
and 50 μg Matrix M1 adjuvant. Immunisation with one dose resulted in partial protection against viral 
replication in airways. Providing a second dose resulted in nearly complete protection. All SARS-CoV-2 
rS with Matrix-M1 adjuvant vaccination doses and regimens used in this study were immunogenic in 
rhesus macaques, with the two-dose regimens resulting in the greatest immunogenicity and protection 
against SARS-CoV-2 challenge that was comparable between both the 5 and 25 μg antigen dose levels. 
IgA response was generated in this animal model.  
From the studies in hamsters, cynomolgus macaques and rhesus monkeys, it emerged that vaccination 
with the BV2373 construct in combination with the adjuvant Matrix-M1 leads to a robust immune 
response that is proven to be effective against the disease symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and in 
reducing viral replication.

In a second study in Rhesus monkeys two doses (full human dose) of 5 μg SARS-CoV-2 rS with 50 μg 
Matrix-M1 adjuvant was well tolerated. The final report will show the results on a challenge with SARS-
CoV-2 virus after 6 or 12 months and provide information on the duration of protection. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No studies on the secondary pharmacodynamics have been performed, which is in accordance with 
applicable guidelines. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies were not conducted with SARS-CoV-2 rS with Matrix-M1 adjuvant 
vaccine, which is in line with the recommendation of the WHO Guidelines on Non-clinical Evaluation of 
Vaccines (2005), also given the availability of supporting non-clinical and clinical data, which indicated 
that the vaccine did not affect physiological functions other than those of the immune system. The 
repeat-dose toxicity study included daily clinical observations, a complete panel of haematology, 
clinical chemistry, and coagulation evaluations, as well as histopathology evaluation on a full panel of 
tissues. There was no evidence of toxicity on physiological functions (e.g., central nervous system, 
cardiovascular, respiratory, or renal functions) based on these evaluations. In addition, multiple 
repeat-dose toxicity studies have been conducted in rats and rabbits with the Matrix-M1 adjuvant and 
viral glycoproteins produced in the baculovirus/Sf9 platform with no evidence of overt systemic or 
organ-specific toxicities identified.  
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies on pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been performed, which is in accordance with 
applicable guidelines. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
WHO guidelines on non-clinical evaluation of vaccines (WHO 2005) and vaccine adjuvants and 
adjuvanted vaccines (WHO 2013), traditional absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion 
(ADME) evaluations are not generally needed for vaccines. The safety concerns associated with 
vaccines are generally not related to the pharmacokinetics but are related to the potential induction of 
immune response.  
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The non-clinical toxicology program was designed to support development of the SARS-CoV-2 rS 
vaccine with Matrix-M1 adjuvant and a set of GLP compliant studies was submitted by the applicant. A 
repeat-dose GLP-compliant study with SARS-CoV-2 rS in rabbits was performed, with or without the 
adjuvant Matrix-M1. In addition, 6 GLP-compliant repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and rabbits 
with other vaccines in combination with Matrix-M1, or Matrix-M1 alone, were provided, in which the 
toxicity of Matrix-M1 was evaluated. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were performed by the applicant, which was agreed. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 50/168 
 
 
 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
In the repeated dose toxicity study with SARS-CoV-2 rS in New Zealand White rabbits, animals 
received 4 intramuscular injections of SARS-CoV-2 rS with or without Matrix-M1. SARS-CoV-2 rS 
vaccine was administered on day 1, 8, 15, and 36 and induced high anti-S IgG titers. Addition of 
Matrix-M1 adjuvant significantly enhanced anti-S IgG responses. Vaccine administration affected 
clinical pathology parameters and histopathology, consistently with an immune stimulation following 
administration of a vaccine, including: minimally to mildly higher mean fibrinogen concentrations, 
moderately to markedly higher mean CRP and minimally higher mean globulin concentrations. These 
findings correlated with the microscopic observations of subacute inflammation at the injection sites. 
The vaccine-related findings were relatively mild and no changes were seen in parameters such as 
body temperature, food consumption or any of the haematological parameters. The observed effects 
resolved during the recovery interval, except for the injection site reactions. Addition of Matrix-M1 
resulted in similar effects. Of note, the dosing schedule used was not in accordance with the proposed 
clinical schedule (the dose ratio of SARS-CoV-2 rS nanoparticle/Matrix-M1 used is different: 50/50 in 
the study vs 5/50 in the clinical situation).  
The safety of Matrix-M1 was also evaluated in three studies in rabbits, either alone or in combination 
with other viral glycoproteins manufactured in the baculovirus-Sf9 system. In addition, three other 
studies (one in rabbits, two in rats) were submitted by the applicant in which the safety of Matrix-M1 
was evaluated with or without a vaccine. Overall, consistent results were observed across these 
studies, and Matrix-M1 adjuvant was well-tolerated with no evidence of toxicity suggestive of any 
unusual risk or target organ toxicity. The findings were considered consistent with immune system 
stimulation consequent to administration of an active adjuvant, and comprised: local injection site 
inflammation, reversible enlargement of the lymph nodes draining the injection sites (but not 
elsewhere), and chemical markers of inflammation (i.e., CRP, fibrinogen, and globulin). Most of the 
findings were fully reversible after 3- to 4-week of recovery periods, although minimal to mild changes 
at the injection sites and in regional lymph nodes persisted in some animals.  
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
The adjuvant Matrix-M1 was tested in a bacterial reverse mutation assay and an in vitro screening 
chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. In both non-GLP assays, there 
was no indication for a genotoxic potential of Matrix-M1.  
The confirmatory GLP-compliant bacterial reverse mutation assay and Mammalian Cell Micronucleus 
assay in CHO Cells with Matrix-M1 confirmed the absence of any indication for a genotoxic potential of 
Matrix-M1. Further in vivo studies were therefore not considered necessary. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed with the SARS-CoV-2 rS vaccine and Matrix-M1 
adjuvant in accordance with the WHO Guidelines on Non-clinical Evaluation of Vaccines (2005) and 
Guidelines on the Non-clinical Evaluation of Vaccine Adjuvants and Adjuvanted Vaccines (2014). 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
A DART study in rats with SARS-CoV-2 rS + Matrix-M1 or Matrix- M1 alone (administered 27 and 13 
days prior to cohabitation and on gestation day (GD) 7 and 15) has been performed. A non-GLP pilot 
study in rats indicated that SARS-CoV-2 rS adjuvanted with Matrix-M1 is immunogenic in female and 
male rats following one and two immunisations. In the DART study, 5 µg SARS-CoV-2 rS + 10 µg 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 51/168 
 
 
 
Matrix-M1 or 10 µg Matrix- M1 alone were used, which are in given at a different ratio than in the 
clinically used dose (although the dose of SARS-CoV-2 rS is the same, the dose of Matrix-M1 is 5 times 
lower).  
No male fertility studies were performed given no adverse observations in male reproductive organs 
were observed in the GLP repeat-dose toxicology study.  
The DART study confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 rS + Matrix-M1 or Matrix-M1 does not affect reproductive 
or developmental parameters and no adverse findings on pregnancy/lactation, or development of the 
embryo/foetus and offspring through post-natal Day 21 were identified. (although some, incidental, 
not compound-related foetal observations were noted in all groups). Furthermore, administration of 
SARS-CoV-2 rS co-formulated with Matrix-M1 adjuvant induced high anti-S IgG titers in all vaccinated 
dams. Anti-S IgG antibodies were also found in F1 generation foetuses and pups (higher levels were 
observed in pups), confirming the transfer of maternal antibodies in postnatal stages of development, 
but also (although to a lesser extent) during the gestational period. 
2.5.4.6.  Local Tolerance  
The absence of a dedicated local tolerance study for NVX-CoV2373 or Matrix-M1 Alone was endorsed. 
Local tolerance was evaluated as part of the repeat dose toxicology study in rabbits with SARS-CoV-2 
rS Nanoparticle Vaccine with Matrix-M1 Adjuvant or Matrix-M1 Alone as well as in the cynomolgus, 
rhesus, and baboon NHP pharmacology studies.  
Overall, administration of both the SARS-CoV-2 rS Nanoparticle Vaccine and the Matrix-M1 adjuvant 
proved to induce local irritancy and inflammation. These effects can be related to an immunological 
response towards the administered products at the injection site, which is a desired pharmacological 
mode of action of the vaccine and the adjuvant.  
In the repeat dose toxicology study in rabbits, minimal to moderate subacute inflammation were 
found, which were generally similar between vaccine groups with and without Matrix-M1, and across all 
phases, and decreased in severity and incidence at the conclusion of the 3-week recovery period. 
In the two supportive rabbit repeated dose toxicity studies, the injection site reactions were relatively 
mild after 3 or 4 injections, and after the 28-day recovery period only minimal injection site reactions 
persisted. In the supportive rat repeated dose toxicity studies, there were minimal to moderate local 
effects, including discolouration, inflammation and haemorrhage at the injection sites, which had 
markedly to fully decreased in severity after a 3-week recovery period. 
Overall, the studies raise no concern regarding the local tolerance of either the SARS-CoV-2 rS 
Nanoparticle Vaccine or the Matrix-M1 adjuvant.  
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447100), due to their nature vaccines and lipids are unlikely to 
result in a significant risk to the environment. Therefore, environmental risk assessment studies are 
not provided in this application for Marketing Authorisation, which is considered acceptable. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 52/168 
 
 
 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The rS antigen is being manufactured in baculoviral cells, which is not a mammalian cell culture, and 
therefore a different pattern of glycosylation is expected. The paucimannose pattern glycosylation 
induced by the insect cells has only limited effects on antibody binding and MHC molecule interactions 
of most predicted T-cell epitopes on the spike. 
In general, the pharmacodynamic studies show that SARS-CoV-2 rS plus Matrix M1 induce an immune 
response in several species (mice, hamsters and monkeys) as shown by the induction of virus-
neutralising antibodies, as well as by disrupting the binding to the hACE2 receptor. These studies 
showed also that the addition of Matrix-M1 is necessary to induce a sufficient immune response. 
Furthermore, it has been shown in a mouse model as well as in hamsters and monkeys that 
administration of SARS-CoV-2 rS plus Matrix M1 protects against SARS-COV2 infection, as shown by 
amelioration of body weight loss, protection from activity reduction, accelerated viral clearance, and 
protection against severe SARS-CoV-2-induced lung histopathological changes compared with placebo. 
Finally, data show the induction of a Th1 cellular immune response. 
The nonhuman primate studies are still ongoing. Given the evolving landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 
pandemic and emergent variant strains, as well as considering the global scarcity of non-human 
primates available for biomedical research, study designs for the two ongoing NHP studies (Studies 
702-087 in baboons and 702-115 in rhesus macaques) have shifted to accommodate investigations 
into vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Long-term data for protection against virus 
challenge in rhesus macaques will be reported after approval.  
As the Matrix-M1 adjuvant is not currently marketed in a human vaccine in the EU market, Novavax is 
planning to conduct a biodistribution study in mice to evaluate the Matrix-M1 adjuvant, which may be 
of value in further understanding the mode of action of the adjuvant. Results of this study will be 
provided at a later stage. Challenges with the labelling of the Matrix-M1 adjuvant, prevented the study 
to be conducted earlier. Considering the extensive clinical package available at the time of initial 
marketing approval, the safety profile of the adjuvanted vaccine was considered acceptable without 
finalisation of the biodistribution study. Furthermore, the recruitment of immune cells, which might 
influence biodistribution, is mainly driven by the Matrix-M1 adjuvant (and not the vaccine antigen), as 
antigen and adjuvant are not bound. However, although the major influence to biodistribution is 
expected to be driven by the Matrix M1 adjuvant vs virus antigen, Matrix M1 adjuvant and antigen will 
be pre-mixed and, under these conditions, some interaction between Matrix-M1 adjuvant and the 
SARS-CoV-2 rS antigen is likely. The applicant therefore will include an additional study group with 
Matrix-M1 (labelled) + SARS-CoV-2 rS (unlabelled) in addition to the Matrix-M1 adjuvant (labelled) 
only group to assess the impact of antigen on the biodistribution of the adjuvant. This protocol of the 
biodistribution will indicate that an adequate dose will be supplied, and adequate tissues will be 
analysed at multiple timepoints, allowing to assess the absorption, distribution and clearance of the 
adjuvant. 
Overall, the toxicology programme revealed no effects other than what expected when administering a 
vaccine. However, the doses used in both the repeated dose toxicity study in rabbits (50/50) and the 
DART study in rats (5/10) are not in line with the absolute human dose (5/50). In both studies, the 
ratio of antigen/adjuvant is different. In addition, in the DART study, the Matrix-M1 dose is 5 times 
lower than the clinical dose, whereas the Guidelines on the non-clinical evaluation of vaccine adjuvants 
and adjuvanted vaccines clearly indicates that ‘the toxicity study should be performed using the 
highest anticipated human dose (in absolute terms) of the final adjuvanted vaccine’. In addition, the 
pharmacodynamic studies in various species have shown that the ratio of antigen/adjuvant may affect 
the immunogenic response, which indicates the relevance of the ratio vaccine/adjuvant for the 
pharmacological properties. According to the applicant, the antigen is not contained within the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 53/168 
 
 
 
saponin-bearing complex, nor are the antigen nanoparticles adsorbed to the Matrix-M1 adjuvant. 
However, in the intended drug product, Matrix-M1 adjuvant and SARS-CoV-2 rS (BV2373) antigen will 
be pre-mixed, and under these conditions, some interaction between Matrix-M1 adjuvant and the 
SARS-CoV-2 rS antigen are expected. Of note, in the mouse study aimed to investigate Temporal and 
Spatial Effects of Matrix-M1 Adjuvant Administration on Adaptive Immune Responses, with 
Recombinant Ebola Virus Glycoprotein it was found that separate administration of Matrix-M1 and 
antigen to the same i.m. injection site resulted in lower levels of antigen-specific antibodies compared 
to pre-mixed Matrix-M1 + antigen.  
It is noted that in the repeated dose toxicity study with the SARS-CoV-2 rS vaccine, the majority of 
iliac lymph nodes (79%) was not assessed. According to the applicant this was due to the small size of 
these lymph nodes. The absence of enlarged lymph nodes implies that the missing lymph nodes were 
most likely normal and therefore the overall interpretation of the study can be accepted. 
For the evaluation of reproduction toxicology, the applicant has used the rat as animal model. It is 
noted that placental transfer of antibodies in rabbits is more similar to humans compared to rodents. 
However, in the DART study, anti-SARS-CoV-2 rS spike IgG titers were measured in maternal, foetal, 
and pup serum samples. Titers measured in foetuses were approximately 8.0% of those present in 
dams, whereas nursing pups had anti-S lgG levels approximately 70-82 % of the IgG levels of the 
dams, indicating that sufficient antibody transfer occurred via placenta and especially lactation.  
In addition, it is noted that In the DART study, the Matrix-M1 dose is 5 times lower than the absolute 
human dose. The administered dose was the maximum volume of clinical formulation (used for the early 
clinical studies) and, although the dose is smaller than the absolute dose that will be administered to 
humans, it does exceed the human dosage on a weight-adjusted basis by 40-fold. In addition, the final 
audited DART report includes data showing that the dose used in this study did induce an immune 
response. The study design and generated results are therefore considered acceptable. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No major non-clinical issues are identified in this application. Several concerns were identified and 
have been properly addressed by the applicant. The CHMP is of the view that non-clinical data reveal 
no special hazard for humans based on appropriate studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive 
and developmental toxicity.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
No pharmacokinetics studies have been conducted for NVX-CoV2373. This is because pharmacokinetics 
studies are generally not needed for vaccines, consistently with current Guidelines on clinical 
evaluation of vaccines. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamic profile of vaccines is defined by their immunogenicity, as detailed in the CHMP 
guideline “Guideline on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines” (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005). 
Mechanism of action 
The SARS-CoV-2 rS vaccine with Matrix-M1 adjuvant (also referred to as NVX-CoV2373) is a protein 
nanoparticle vaccine (SARS-CoV-2 rS) constructed from the full-length, wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S 
glycoprotein (based on Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate), stabilised in its prefusion conformation administered with 
Matrix-M1 adjuvant, a saponin-based adjuvant derived from fractionated Quillaja saponins, 
phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol. The addition of the saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant facilitates 
activation of the cells of the innate immune system, which enhances the magnitude of the S protein-
specific immune response. The two vaccine components elicit B- and T-cell immune responses to the S 
protein, including neutralising antibodies, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19. 
To date, there is no established correlate of protection for COVID-19.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The bioanalytical methods used to support the clinical development of NVX-CoV2373 were a micro-
neutralisation (MN) assay to evaluate specific neutralising antibodies (nAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in

human serum, an ELISA for the determination of specific IgG antibodies against S protein or N protein 
in human serum, an intracellular cytokine staining assay, and an hACE2 receptor inhibition assay to 
determine the inhibition titre in human serum for inhibiting the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to the 
hACE2 receptor. The microneutralisation, anti-S protein binding IgG, and hACE2 receptor binding 
inhibition assays were all based on the original Wuhan strain.  
All assays used to determine immunogenicity in the phase 3 studies were validated.

Immunogenicity results 
The immunogenicity data available so far were generated from study 2019nCoV-101 part 1 and 2, 
2019nCoV-301, 2019nCoV-302, and 2019nCoV-501. Main findings are described below.  
Dose finding studies: 2019nCoV-101 Part 1 and Part 2 
Study 2019nCoV-101 is a two-part phase 1/2 randomised observer blinded study designed to evaluate 
the safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373. Part 1 is the first-in-human trial evaluating the safety 
and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 rS with or without Matrix-M1 adjuvant in healthy adult participants 
18 to 59 years of age at 2 sites in Australia. Part 2 commenced after positive results were observed 
following a formal analysis of the primary endpoints in Part 1 and was designed to evaluate the safety 
and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 rS with Matrix-M1 adjuvant in healthy adult participants 18 to 84 
years of age at multiple sites in the USA and Australia.  
Both Part 1 and Part 2 evaluated 2 dose levels of SARS-CoV-2 rS (5 μg and 25 μg), which were based 
on the results of non-clinical studies with this antigen and on the results of clinical studies with other 
Novavax-based nanoparticle vaccines. Both parts also evaluated a single dose level of Matrix-M1 
adjuvant (50 μg), based on previous clinical experience with Matrix-M1 adjuvant. 
Subjects in Part 1 received either 1 or 2 doses of either 5 or 25 µg rS with or without 50 µg Matrix-M1 
adjuvant (see Table 4).

Following First Vaccination of SARS-CoV-2 rS with or without Matrix-M1 Adjuvant in Healthy Adult 
Participants 18 to 59 Years of Age (Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set) 
In conclusion, Part 1 showed that up to 2 doses of 5 μg and 25 μg SARS-CoV-2 rS with or without 50-
μg Matrix-M1 adjuvant, administered 21 days apart, were immunogenic and well tolerated in healthy 
adult participants 18 to 59 years of age (see safety section for more details).  
Part 2 of the study was conducted in healthy males or nonpregnant females 18 to 84 years of age, 
inclusive, to further identify the optimal dose across age strata based on immune response (IgG 
antibody to SARS-CoV-2 rS) at Day 35 and whether baseline immune status has an impact. The 
following treatment groups were included: 
Table 5 Trial Design for Protocol 2019nCoV-101 Phase 2 (Part 2)  
Immunogenicity assessments comprised serum anti-S protein binding IgG, hACE2 receptor binding 
inhibition, neutralising antibodies, and cell-mediated immunity.  
Neutralising antibody responses comparing the 18 to 59 years stratum and the 60 to 84 years stratum 
are shown below.

Serostatus in Participants 18 to 59 Years of Age and 60 to 84 Years of Age (PP Analysis 
Set2019nCoV-101 Part 2) 
Overall, it can be concluded that the interim results obtained in Part 2 provide further support for the 
inclusion of the adjuvant and administration of a second dose, with again no apparent advantage for 
25 vs. 5 μg antigen doses in the adjuvanted formulations. The humoral immune response analyses by 
age subgroup show a potent response in both age groups, although the magnitude of the response was 
consistently lower in the older age stratum. The final clinical study report (CSR) should be made 
available as soon as possible to further evaluate the effect of age on the kinetics, amplitude or 
durability of vaccine-induced immune responses. 
Main studies 
2019nCoV-301 
Study 2019nCoV-301 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-
controlled study in participants 18 years of age and older in United States and Mexico. Upon 
enrolment, participants were stratified by age (18 to 64 years and ≥ 65 years) and assigned in a 2:1 
ratio to receive Nuvaxovid or placebo. 
The main immunogenicity related endpoints were the analysis of antibodies binding to the SARS-CoV-2 
S protein by ELISA, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation, both at Day 0 (baseline) and Day 35 (14 days 
after second study vaccination).  
Demographics and baseline characteristics of participants in the PP-IMM Analysis Set were well 
balanced between the NVX-CoV2373 and placebo groups. Median age (range) was 65.0 years (18 to 
95 years), with approximately 50% of participants ≥ 65 years of age. Approximately half the 
participants were male (50.1%), while the majority (79.1%) was White, not of Hispanic or Latino origin 
(80.7%), and located in the United States (93.0%). Black or African Americans (9.9%), American 
Indians or Alaska Natives (6.2%), and Asians (3.3%) were well represented. The majority of 
participants were overweight or obese (74.3%), with more than a third being obese (38.2%). 
At 2 weeks following second vaccination (Day 35), serum IgG antibody geometric mean ELISA units 
(GMEUs) in the NVX-CoV2373 group were markedly increased relative to placebo across all age groups 
(48,918.0 vs 128.0, respectively, for participants ≥ 18 years of age; 63,890.4 vs 121.9 for participants 
18 to < 65 years of age; and 37,594.3 vs 134.1 for participants ≥ 65 years of age) with no evidence of

placebo response. Serum anti-S IgG GMTs in the NVX-CoV2373 group were approximately 1.7-fold 
higher in the younger age cohort (18 to <65 years) than in the older age cohort (≥65 years). SCRs in 
the NVX-CoV2373 groups also were markedly increased relative to placebo across all age groups 
(97.3% vs 4.5% for participants ≥ 18 years of age; 98.0% vs 3.7% for participants 18 to < 65 years 
of age; and 96.6% vs 5.3% for participants ≥ 65 years of age). 
Serum anti-S IgG levels at Day 35 in both serologically negative and serologically positive adult 
participants were increased relative to placebo and showed similar patterns of response, with higher 
levels in the placebo group in serologically positive adult participants. In baseline seropositive 
individuals, GMTs at baseline were 7,541.0 and 3,062.2 EU/mL in the placebo and NVX-CoV2373 
group, compared to 6,174.6 and 119,620.4 EU/mL at Day 35. 
Neutralising antibody levels in serologically negative adult participants at Day 35 (Table 13) were 
increased relative to placebo across all age groups: ≥18 years of age, 18 to <65 years, and ≥65 years 
of age. 
Table 7. Summary on neutralising antibodies for SARS-COV-2 wild-type virus at day 0 
(baseline) and day 35 (14 days after second vaccination) in serologically negative 
participants by age groups (PP-IMM analysis set). 
At 2 weeks following second vaccination in most participants (Day 35), neutralising antibody GMTs in 
the NVX-CoV2373 group were markedly increased relative to placebo for all participants (1,156.6 vs 
11.8, respectively); for serologically positive participants (3,741.9 vs 190.3) relative to placebo; and 
for serologically negative participants (1,078.2 vs 10.7), with no evidence of placebo response (Table 
14). Neutralising antibody GMTs in the NVXCoV2373 group were approximately 3.5-fold higher in the 
serologically positive cohort than in the serologically negative cohort. SCRs in the NVX-CoV2373 group 
also were markedly increased relative to placebo across all baseline serostatus groups (95.5% vs 2.3% 
for serologically negative and positive participants; 96.3% vs 2.1% for serologically negative 
participants; and 82.9% vs 8.3% for serologically positive participants).

2019nCoV-302 
Study 2019nCoV-302 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-
controlled study in participants 18 to 84 years of age in the United Kingdom. Upon enrolment, 
participants were stratified by age (18 to 64 years; 65 to 84 years) to receive Nuvaxovid or placebo.  
The main immunogenicity related endpoints were the analysis of antibodies binding to the SARS-CoV-2 
S protein by ELISA, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation, both at Day 0 (baseline) and Day 35 (14 days 
after second study vaccination). 
At 2 weeks following second vaccination in all participants (Day 35), serum anti-S IgG GMTs in the 
NVX-CoV2373 group were markedly increased approximately 350- to 400-fold relative to placebo 
across all age groups (44,673.8 vs 113.2 EU/mL, respectively, for participants 18 to 84 years of age; 
47,564.3 vs 113.5 EU/mL for participants 18 to 64 years of age; and 37,892.8 vs 112.3 EU/mL for 
participants 65 to 84 years of age) with no evidence of placebo response. Serum anti-S IgG GMTs in 
the NVX-CoV2373 group were approximately 1.3-fold higher in the younger age cohort (18 to 64 
years) than in the older age cohort (65 to 84 years). SCRs in the NVX-CoV2373 groups also were 
markedly increased relative to placebo across all age groups (99.0% vs 0.7% for participants 18 to 84 
years of age; 99.0% vs 1.0% for participants 18 to 64 years of age; and 99.1% vs 0% for participants 
65 to 84 years of age). 
Serum anti-S IgG levels at Day 35 in both serologically negative and serologically positive adult 
participants were increased relative to placebo and showed similar patterns of response, with higher 
levels in the placebo group in serologically positive adult participants. In baseline seropositive 
individuals, GMTs at baseline were 1771.7 and 1698.8 EU/mL in the placebo and NVX-CoV2373 group, 
compared to 1756.9 and 125489.8 EU/mL at Day 35.

Neutralising antibody levels in serologically negative adult participants at Day 35 were increased 
relative to placebo across all age groups: 18 to 84 years, 18 to 64 years, and 65 to 84 years (Table 
15).

Neutralisation Assay Subset, 2019nCoV-302) 
At 2 weeks following second vaccination (Day 35), neutralising antibody GMTs in the NVX-CoV2373 
group were markedly increased approximately 110-fold relative to placebo for serologically negative 
participants (1,129.5 vs 10.4); and approximately 70-fold for serologically positive participants 
(4,373.8 vs 62.0) with no evidence of placebo response (Table 16). Neutralising antibody GMTs in the 
NVXCoV2373 group were approximately 3.9-fold higher in the serologically positive cohort than in the 
serologically negative cohort. SCRs in the NVX-CoV2373 group also were markedly increased relative 
to placebo across baseline serostatus groups (98.2% vs 0.8% for serologically negative participants; 
and 100.0% vs 15.8% for serologically positive participants).

after Second Vaccination) in Adult Participants By Baseline Serostatus (ITT Neutralisation 
Assay Subset, 2019nCoV-302) 
An authorised seasonal influenza co-administration substudy was conducted as part of protocol 
2019nCoV-302 in the first approximately 400 participants who met the additional inclusion criteria for 
this study (i.e., participant had not received a current season influenza vaccine, had no 
contraindication to the specific vaccine to be administered in the study, and had no prior history of 
allergy or severe reaction to seasonal influenza vaccines). 
The objective of the substudy was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 rS with 
Matrix-M1 adjuvant in the initial set of vaccinations when co-administered with an authorised seasonal 
influenza vaccine. The endpoint was Analysis of the safety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 rS with 
Matrix-M1 adjuvant when co-administered with seasonal influenza vaccine in a subset population. 
An unadjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Flucelvax, Seqirus) was given to those 18 to 64 years 
of age, and an adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluad, Seqirus) was given to those ≥ 65 years of 
age, in compliance with UK recommendations.

Flucelvax contains surface antigens (hemagglutinin and neuraminidase) detergent-extracted 
from the 4 strains of influenza virus recommended annually by the WHO for the Northern 
Hemisphere season (type A H1N1, type A H3N2, type B Yamagata lineage and type B Victoria 
lineage; 15 ug virus protein of each, 60 ug virus protein in total). 
Fluad contains surface antigens (hemagglutinin and neuraminidase) detergent-extracted from

Co-administration resulted in no change to influenza vaccine immune responses as measured by 
hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. A 30% reduction in antibody responses to Nuvaxovid was 
noted as assessed by an anti-spike IgG assay with seroconversion rates similar to participants who did 
not receive concomitant influenza vaccine. The clinical impact of the reduced response is unknown. 
2019nCoV-501 
2019nCoV-501 is an ongoing Phase 2a/b, multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-
controlled study in HIV-negative participants 18 to 84 years of age and people living with HIV 18 to 
64 years of age in South Africa. These people were medically stable (free of opportunistic infections), 
receiving highly active and stable antiretroviral therapy, and having an HIV-1 viral load of < 1000 
copies/mL. Upon enrolment, participants were randomly assigned to receive Nuvaxovid or placebo. 
Immunogenicity related endpoints considered binding antibody levels and neutralising antibody activity 
at Day 0, 21 (only for binding antibodies) and 35 in healthy HIV-negative and medically stable HIV-
positive adult subjects with baseline negative serostatus, baseline positive serostatus, or regardless of 
baseline serostatus.  
CHMP assessment report

Regardless of HIV status, anti-S IgG antibody GMTs at Day 0 were higher for participants who were 
seropositive at baseline, across both vaccine and placebo groups, than they were for participants who 
were seronegative at baseline.  
In all participants (HIV seronegative and HIV seropositive subjects together), SARS-CoV-2 
seronegative at baseline, the anti-S IgG antibody GMT at Day 21 was greater for participants who 
received NVX-CoV2373 (1,147.4 EU/mL) than it was for those who received placebo (119.2 EU/mL). 
The anti-S IgG antibody GMT further increased after the second dose, to 30520.6 and 126.0 EU/mL at 
Day 35.  
Among participants who were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline, anti-S IgG antibody GMTs for 
HIV-positive participants were approximately half of those seen for HIV-negative participants (14420.5 
vs 31631.8 EU/mL at Day 35); however, among participants who were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at 
baseline, anti-S IgG antibody GMTs for HIV-positive participants were comparable to those seen for 
HIV-negative participants (98399.5 vs 100666.1 EU/mL at Day 35).  
In all participants, regardless of baseline serostatus and regardless of HIV status, participants who 
received 2 doses of NVX-CoV2373 showed stronger neutralising antibody responses, in terms of 
amplitude and kinetics, than did those that received placebo. Also in this study, among participants 
who were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at baseline, neutralising antibody GMTs for HIV-positive 
participants were comparable to those seen for HIV-negative participants. Regardless of HIV status, 
SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus neutralising antibody GMTs at Day 35 were markedly higher in 
seropositive as compared to seronegative participants. SCRs at Day 35 ranged from 92.3% to 98.4% 
for NVX-CoV2373 versus 2.0% to 13.5% for placebo for all actively immunised participants and for 
HIV-negative and HIV-positive participants with baseline negative serostatus, baseline positive 
serostatus, or regardless of baseline serostatus. See Table 19 below for more details per HIV 
serostatus group.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In the context of vaccines, PK studies are not required because the PK is not considered informative 
towards the determination of an optimal dose and the metabolic pathways of vaccines are generally 
understood.  
The applicant has performed several assays to characterise the vaccine-induced immune response. At 
the present time, there is no established immunological correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 
infection. Current evidence suggests that neutralising antibody against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-
2 is likely to be the best surrogate marker for vaccine efficacy.  
Validation reports have been submitted for the main assays, including the SARS-CoV-2 
microneutralisation (MN) assay and the IgG ELISA. The T cell assays have not yet been validated. If 
these assays will be used for the analysis of phase 3 study samples, validation reports are expected to 
be available. Of note, the validation exercise should include all steps, i.e. also the preparation, freezing 
and shipping of vaccinee PBMCs, and bridging studies between US and UK laboratories.  
For both the MN and IgG ELISA assays efforts have been put in calibrating the assay standards with 
the WHO international standard (IS). For the S-binding ELISA, the conversion factor to convert IgG 
antibody level from EU/mL to BAU/mL is calculated to be 22. As such, any antibody level depicted in 
ELISA units can be divided by 22 to express these in the WHO international units BAU/mL. For the MN 
assay, a conversion factor of 0.62 has been determined.  
Immunogenicity data available were generated from study 2019nCoV-101 part 1 and 2 (dose response 
studies), 2019nCoV-302, 2019nCoV-301 (main studies), and 2019nCoV-501 (supportive study). 
Immunogenicity was assessed primarily based on circulating neutralising and spike antigen-binding 
antibodies as measured by in vitro SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay and anti-S protein IgG binding 
ELISA, respectively. Results from an hACE2 receptor binding inhibition ELISA and a limited amount of T 
cell immunity data were also included in the interim report of study 2019nCoV-101. The clinical phase 
1/2 immunogenicity findings were in concordance with the preclinical immunogenicity findings in mice, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 68/168 
 
 
 
 
hamsters and nonhuman primate models; both preclinical and clinical data supports the posology 
intended for authorisation (5 ug of SARS-CoV-2 rS spike protein antigen adjuvanted with 50 ug of 
Matrix-M1). T cell responses were Th1-skewed.  
Clinical phase 3 data confirm that the vaccine is immunogenic and the studied two dose schedule 
resulted in seroconversion in almost all participants. Also, in baseline seropositive subjects, the 2-dose 
regimen resulted in a markedly increased humoral immune response. Whether or not a single dose 
would also suffice in this subgroup is unknown, as data after a single dose have not been collected in 
the pivotal study.  
As expected, immune responses were somewhat lower in the adults ≥ 65 years of age, as well as in 
HIV seropositive participants (for the latter group in both subgroups antibodies (binding and 
neutralising) were approximately 2-fold reduced). These findings raise no immediate concerns, but the 
magnitude as well as durability of immunogenicity of the vaccine in elderly subjects as well as 
medically stable HIV-positive subjects remains to be determined based on final study data. It is agreed 
that based on the available data, no dose adjustment is required in adults ≥ 65 years of age as also 
stated in the SmPC. 
In healthy COVID-19 naïve individuals 18-64 years of age of study 2019nCOV-101, at day 189 
(approximately 5 months after the second dose), binding as well as functional antibody levels were 
approximately 10-fold reduced compared to the maximum at day 35; seroconversion rates remained 
at 100% for binding antibodies, but had declined to ≥ 64% for neutralising antibodies. The clinical 
relevance hereof, and whether or not (and if so, when) a booster dose should be recommended is 
currently unknown.  
Across all studies, few non-responders were seen for both the binding antibody as well as 
neutralisation assay. Lower immune response was observed in study 2019nCoV-501 (conducted in 
South-Africa) as compared to study 2019nCoV-302 (conducted in the UK). Furthermore, a lower 
vaccine efficacy has been reported for study 2019nCoV-501 as compared to 2019nCoV-302 (see 
clinical efficacy section for more details). Although there are differences between the assays used in 
the two studies that may explain some of the observed differences in response levels, a resolutive 
explanation for the lower levels of neutralising antibody responses reported from Clinical Study 
2019nCoV-501 has not been found. Importantly, the applicant states that no issues have been 
observed with the shipping or storage of the study vaccine in study 2019nCoV-501 (such as 
temperature excursions) that might have contributed to the reduced response levels. The reduced 
efficacy seen in study 2019nCoV-501 is according to the applicant directly attributable to the 
emergence of the Beta escape variant in South Africa during the study. While it is acknowledged that 
the emergence of the Beta variant likely has had a role in the reduced efficacy, it cannot be excluded 
that there are other factors that may have affected overall vaccine efficacy. However, given the lack of 
solid explanations as to why the immunogenicity was lower in 2019nCoV-501 and whether this can be 
linked to the reduced efficacy, no further action is currently required. The applicant is currently 
performing an analysis of immune correlates of risk and protection from the pre-crossover efficacy 
period for Clinical Study 2019nCoV-301 which may be able to provide additional insight in the 
implications of the observed lower immunogenicity in study 2019nCoV-501. 
A diminished response was also observed in participants in study 2019nCoV-302 who received a 
concomitant seasonal influenza vaccination (approx. 1.5-fold). The clinical impact of the reduced 
response is unknown. The few cases of PCR-confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-
19 observed in the substudy population (n=10 in total, 2 in the active arm and 8 in the placebo arm) 
are considered insufficient to dismiss the concern. SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody responses for the 
influenza substudy participants were not investigated by the applicant. Also, while negative impact of 
non-adjuvanted (quadrivalent) flu vaccine on NVX-CoV2373 is not expected, interactions between

NVX-CoV2373 (adjuvanted with Matrix-M1) and adjuvanted flu vaccines (e.g. MF59-adjuvanted 
trivalent flu vaccine such as used in study 2019nCoV-302) cannot be ruled out, especially if 
accidentally injected at the same site, because of the similarity in the modes of action between the 
adjuvants present in the vaccines. However, in study 2019nCoV-302, only elderly participants received 
adjuvanted trivalent flu vaccine, and there are too few elderly participants in the influenza sub-study 
for conclusions to be drawn. In short, the data from the flu substudy is considered too limited to 
support any recommendations regarding concomitant use of NVX-CoV2373 with influenza vaccines.  
Different PCR assays have been used in the different studies. All assays were however validated and 
expected to perform well.  
Further, sequencing of breakthrough cases has been performed. More information, including on the CT 
values of all positive samples, by virus strain (Wuhan vs. B.1.1.7, vs. other variants) will be provided 
in later CSRs.  
Several issues remain that require further investigation and that may be solved post-authorisation. 
These include i) investigation on the need of a booster dose; ii) investigation on identifying an 
immunological correlate of protection, and iii) investigation (with regular updates) on the ability of the 
vaccine to neutralise emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion, aspects related to clinical pharmacology have been satisfactory addressed by the 
applicant. The immune response data provided in the interim reports overall support the choice of a 2-
dose schedule of NVX-CoV2373, with no apparent advantage for 25 vs. 5 μg antigen doses in the 
adjuvanted formulations.  
The interim immunogenicity data indicates that immunogenicity is likely reduced in the elderly and 
HIV-positive subjects; the magnitude of this reduction remains to be determined. No conclusions can 
currently be reached on (i) durability of immune responses (especially in elderly vaccinees), and 
concomitant use of NVX-CoV2373 with influenza vaccines (especially adjuvanted influenza vaccines).  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
the applicant should submit final study reports from studies 2019nCoV-101 part 1 and 2, 2019nCoV-
301, 2019nCoV-302 and 2019nCoV-501 as soon as these are available, investigate the need of a 
booster dose, detail their plans to establish an immunologic correlate of protection, and investigate 
(with regular updates) the ability of the vaccine to neutralise emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response studies 
See section 2.6 on clinical pharmacology for an overview of the immunogenicity data from dose finding 
study 2019nCoV-101, Part 1 and Part 2. 
Overall, the safety and immunogenicity data obtained in Part 1 and Part 2 of 2019nCoV-101 provided 
support for the inclusion of the adjuvant and administration of a second dose, with no apparent 
advantage for 25 vs. 5 μg antigen doses in the adjuvanted formulations. The immunogenicity analyses 
by age subgroup (humoral immunity only) show a potent response in both age groups, although the 
magnitude of the response was consistently lower in the older age stratum. The clinical relevance of 
this lower response can however not yet be determined. Clinical efficacy information for this age

stratum will come from the main studies described below. Reactogenicity was higher in the adjuvanted 
arms of the study and higher frequencies of local and systemic reactogenicity occurred in participants 
receiving the higher antigen dose (25 μg) compared to the lower antigen dose (5 μg). 
2.6.5.2.  Main studies 
Two pivotal studies are included for this MAA: 2019nCoV-301 and 2019nCoV-302. These are phase 3, 
randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
a SARS-CoV-2 rS with Matrix-M1 adjuvant in adult participants 18 years of age and older in the US, 
Mexico for study 2019nCoV-301 and the United Kingdom 2019nCoV-302. 
Study 2019nCoV-301 & 2019nCoV-302  
Methods 
Study 2019nCoV-301 & Study 2019nCoV-302 were presented together for the similar study sections, 
while they were reported separately to explain differences as needed. 
Study Participants  
The trials included healthy male or female participants aged 18 to 84 years (2019nCoV-302) or 18 
years and older (2019nCoV-301), who did not have a history of laboratory-confirmed (by PCR or 
serology to SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 infection at any time prior to randomisation. Both trials focussed 
on enrolment of participants at high risk of complications due to COVID-19 due to underlying coming 
comorbidities or living/working conditions. Participants with stable chronic medical conditions were not 
excluded unless participants were immunocompromised (iatrogenic or pathogenic), had an 
autoimmune disease/condition or a current diagnosis of or treatment for cancer. Further, pregnant and 
breastfeeding women were also excluded from participation. Additionally, normal inclusion and 
exclusion criteria appropriate for a vaccine trial were in place. 
Treatments 
Participants were randomised to either 2 doses of 5 µg SARS-CoV-2 rS with 50 µg Matrix-M1 adjuvant 
(NVX-CoV2373) or saline placebo (Sodium chloride injection (BP, sterile), 0.9%). 
In 2019nCoV-302, single dose vials manufactured from Emergent BioSolutions (Emergent) were used. 
Lot numbers were 2870-101 and 2870-102. The seasonal influenza vaccine co-administration sub-
study will comprise a single IM injection (0.5 mL) of an authorised influenza vaccine on Day 0 in an 
open-label manner. An unadjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine will be given to those 18 to 64 
years of age, and an adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine will be given to those ≥ 65 years of age. 
In study 2019nCoV-301, material filled in multi-dose vials (MDV), manufactured by Par Pharmaceutical 
was used. The lot number was from Drug Product Lot 280003 manufactured at Par Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc. The lot was composed of drug substance and Matrix-M1, Lot GR1350007, manufactured at 
FujiFilm Diosynth Biotechnologies (FDBU) at the 2000 L scale. For information with regards to 
comparability between the batches produced at the two sites please see the sections 2.4 on Quality 
aspects. Of note, there are differences between the batches used in the different trials. In study 
2019nCoV-301 the DP Lot PAR28003 was used which had a higher level of protein as well as higher 
levels of impurities compared to the DP Lots EBSI DP4 and EBSI DP5 used in trial 2019nCoV-302, as 
well as in trial 2019nCoV-101 and 2019nCoV-501. The commercial batches are more comparable to 
the lots used in the 2019nCOV-301 trial.

In study 2019nCoV-301, the eDiary would alert participants to start daily nasal self-swabbing for PCR 
testing within 3 days of symptom onset at home (3 days) and to initiate daily completion of the 
InFLUenza Patient-Reported Outcome (FLU-PRO) symptom reporting instrument for 10 days. Also, the 
eDiary alerted the study site to schedule a surveillance visit (Unscheduled Acute Illness Visit), which 
included taking of vital signs, a nasal swab and blood sample for serologic testing. PCR-positive swabs 
obtained outside the study from either asymptomatic participants, e.g. for travel or work, or from 
symptomatic infection not evaluated by swab(s) tested by the central laboratory, were not included in

the endpoint analyses. Active surveillance for COVID-19 will continue after the blinded crossover 
through the first 12 months of study. Passive surveillance of safety and efficacy via remote contacts or 
the scheduled visits will continue during months 12 to 24. 
For information on the PCR assays used, see section 2.6.2 of Clinical Pharmacology. 
In study 2019nCoV-302, participants received weekly reminders (email or text messages) to 
immediately contact the study team if they have experienced any new symptoms or health concerns 
that could be related to infection with SARS-CoV-2. If a participant experiences any symptom included 
in Table 21, this will trigger: 
-  Nose/throat self-sampling once daily for 3 consecutive days. If any test is found to be positive 
before 3 consecutive days of testing is performed, the full 3 consecutive tests may not be 
required. Participants will self-sample based on the training given on Day 0. 
-  Nose/throat sampling will be started approximately 24 hours after the first symptom(s) are 
reported. 
- 
Participants will take their temperature daily for 10 days and complete a FLU_PRO diary to 
record symptoms. 
Study participants were discouraged from using non-study swabs; however, it was not prohibited. Non-
study swabs include swabs taken during hospitalisations, ER visits, local tests performed at the study 
sites, or private testing facilities. If a valid report existed for testing in any of these conditions, it was 
treated identically to a study swab. 
Newly discovered symptoms of suspected COVID-19 will trigger a COVID-19 Surveillance Visit. During 
the surveillance visit, symptoms will be reviewed and confirmed, vital signs will be taken, any health 
care visits will be documented and use of concomitant medication recorded.  
Secondary endpoints 2019nCoV-301:

least 7 days after second study vaccination (e.g., Day 28) in the initial set of vaccinations in 
seronegative adult participants by age (< 65 and ≥ 65), in racial and ethnic minorities, and in 
those with comorbid conditions. 
Sample size 
2019nCoV-301 
The sample size for the original study design (described through protocol version 6.0) was driven by 
the total number of cases expected to achieve statistical significance for the primary efficacy endpoint; 
a total of up to approximately 30,000 participants ≥ 18 years of age would be enrolled to provide a 
target of 144 symptomatic PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections.  
Change during study: Given the mandate from the US Government that all adults would be eligible for 
an EUA vaccine as of 01 May 2021 and the decreasing prevalence of COVID-19 in the US during the 
timeframe for case accrual, the applicant identified that it would become extremely difficult to continue 
accruing COVID-19 cases. The applicant implemented the blinded crossover in Clinical Study 
2019nCoV-301 on 20 April 2021 following accumulation of the median 2-month safety follow-up 
(targeted for 19 April 2021) and accumulation of cases for the efficacy analysis. With the 
implementation of the blinded crossover, the placebo-controlled portion of Clinical Study 2019nCoV-
301 ended. In a protocol revision the two interim analyses for efficacy and futility that were planned, 
were removed. Only one analysis will be performed. 
It was assumed as an example that with 75 events the minimum VE needed to demonstrate a lower 
bound of the confidence interval to be >30% would be VE 56%. 
2019nCoV-302 
This study is designed to enrol approximately 15,000 participants, who will be initially randomised 1:1 
into the study vaccine groups. The sample size is driven by the total number of events expected to 
achieve statistical significance for the primary efficacy endpoint. A target of 100 mild, moderate, or 
severe COVID-19 cases was chosen to provide > 95% power for 70% or higher vaccine efficacy (VE).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 76/168 
 
 
 
A single interim analysis of efficacy will be conducted based on the accumulation of approximately 50% 
(50 events) of the total anticipated primary endpoints using Lan-DeMets alpha-spending function for 
Pocock boundary conditions, with a planned one-sided alpha of 0.01550 at 50% of the data and 
0.01387 at the final analysis. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
In 2019nCoV-301, participants were randomised in a 2:1 ratio stratified by age group (18-64, ≥65 
years of age), using randomly varying block sizes between 3 and 12. No formal stratification by site 
was conducted, however, at the time of randomisation of a participant at a site, a full block would be 
assigned to the site in order to maintain treatment assignment balance in the planned ratio at each 
site and allow for site and region effects to be assessed. 
In 2019nCoV-302, participants were randomised to NVX-CoV2373 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio via block 
randomisation to NVX-CoV2373 or placebo, stratified by site and by age (<65 years, ≥ 65 years). 
Both trials were designed as observer blinded trials. To maintain the blind, unblinded site personnel will 
manage study vaccine logistics, preparation, and administration so as to maintain the blind from the 
remainder of the site personnel and participants. The unblinded site personnel will not be involved in 
study-related assessments or have participant contact for data collection following study vaccine 
administration. It was made clear that for both studies blue-coloured translucent tape will be used on 
the syringe barrel to maintain the blind Clear rules surrounding potential unblinding were included in 
the protocols, however, communication between blinded and unblinded teams was possible. The DSMB 
was unblinded and reviewed the distribution of PCR+ cases over the trial arms during the study. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis set for both trials 2019nCoV-302 and 2019nCoV-301 was defined as the 
PP-EFF set, consisting of all randomised participants without major protocol deviations, who are 
seronegative (for SARS-CoV-2) at baseline and do not have a laboratory confirmed current SARS-CoV-
2 infection with symptom onset up to 6 days after the second dose, and who have received both doses 
less than 45 days apart. Supportive efficacy analyses were defined in the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
(2019nCoV-302 study)/ full analysis set (FAS) (2019nCoV-301 study) sets including all participants 
who are randomised and have received at least 1 dose of study vaccine. For the 2019nCoV-301, a 
second per-protocol efficacy (PP-EFF-2) analysis set was defined followed the same method described 
in the PP-EFF population including all participants regardless of baseline serostatus. 
For the primary analysis for both trials the VE was calculated as 100% x (1 – RR), where RR = Relative 
Risk calculated as ratio of incidence rates (SARS CoV-2 Rs with Matrix-M1 / Placebo), presented with 
95% CI and an unadjusted one-sided p-value for testing H0: VE ≤ 30%.  
The primary endpoint was to be evaluated using a modified Poisson regression fitted to the occurrence 
of PCR confirmed COVID-19 disease (no infection, or one or more infections) with onset between 7 
days after second study vaccination and end of study at 12 months (+15 days). The model included 
stratification factors and treatment group as fixed effects and robust error variances (Zou, 2004) as 
well as the natural log of the surveillance time as an offset. The explanatory variables included the 
treatment group and the stratification variables (age group (<65/ ≥65 years) and region [pooled sites] 
for study 302 only). The pooling of sites into regions will be determined and documented prior to 
breaking the blind for the 302 study. Where the model failed due sparsity of data, the Clopper Pearson 
approach, adjusted for surveillance time, was to be used. A sensitivity analysis was planned in both 
trials using a stratified Cox Proportional Hazard model with Efron’s method of tie handling on the PP-
EFF analysis.

A primary estimand was defined for 2019nCoV-302. This estimand seeks to understand efficacy during 
a surveillance period (7 days to 12 months after second vaccination), which starts after the vaccine is 
considered to have stimulated an immune response in adults naïve to SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed 
seronegative) who comply with the dosing schedule and do not start an infection prior to 7 days after 
second vaccination. A hypothetical strategy is used for unrelated deaths and significant protocol 
deviations (such as use of alternative vaccines and prohibited medications) so that interest lies in the 
hypothetical situation that these do not occur. As at the time of writing the protocol the estimand 
framework had not been fully implemented by all regulators globally, for pragmatic reasons, it was 
later decided to introduce the estimand framework, therefore it is not fully implemented.  
No estimand was defined for 2019nCoV-301. 
For 2019nCoV-302, the one-sided alpha was calculated using the Lan-DeMets alpha-spending for 
Pocock boundary conditions to account for the interim analysis. 
For 2019nCoV-301, two formal interim analyses for efficacy and a futility were planned. However, the 
protocol was revised while the study was ongoing to perform one single primary analysis. This analysis 
was planned to be performed when the blinded crossover will be implemented, the timing has not been 
clarified.  
For 2019nCoV-301, sensitivity analyses were planned to evaluate potential bias due to differential 
early unblinding: 1) Including additional potential covariates; 2) Using a Cox PH model with Inverse 
Probability of Censoring Weights (IPCW) (e.g., Robins 1993, Robins & Rotnitzky 1992, Robins & 
Finkelstein 2000); 2) Using an alternative Cox PH model with multiple-imputation using Zhao’s 
method. 
For 2019nCoV-302, data from the blinded crossover period as well as incomplete or unavailable data 
from the initial vaccination period was excluded from the efficacy analyses. For 2019nCoV-301, in 
general, missing data have been excluded, no imputations were conducted for missing efficacy data. A 
tipping point analysis was to be conducted for both trials to assess the impact of missing values on the 
primary conclusions. 
Subgroup analyses were predefined for a range of subgroups based on age, sex, race and 
comorbidities, ethnicity and race.  
The statistical analysis plan of 2019nCoV-301 includes pre-specification of how waning of efficacy will 
be studied, the statistical analysis plan of 2019nCoV-302 will be updated to include similar 
methodology. 
Results 
Recruitment 
Study 2019nCoV-301 was initiated on 27 December 2020 (first participant screened) and completed 
enrolment on 18 February 2021 at 119 sites across the US and Mexico. The data cut-off date for the 
60-day median safety follow-up analysis was 19 April 2021; collection of efficacy and safety follow-up 
data continued for events that began on or before 19 April 2021 through 01 June 2021. The study 
remains ongoing through approximately 2 years follow-up from the Day 21 injection. 
Study 2019nCoV-302 was initiated on 28 September 2020 (first participant screened) and completed 
enrolment on 28 November 2020 at 33 sites across the UK. The data cut-off date of the interim 
efficacy analysis was 10 January 2021, the data cut-off date for the final efficacy analysis was 29 
January 2021, and the data cut-off date for all other analyses was 23 February 2021. All data were 
fully cleaned and locked on 26 January 2021 for the interim analysis and on 15 March 2021 for the 
final analysis. The study remains ongoing through approximately 1 year follow-up from the Day 21 
injection.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
Both studies have gone through numerous changes.  
Major change to protocol of study 2019nCoV-301 (final Protocol Version 9.0, 14 May 2021) included 
replacement of two interim analyses with a single efficacy analysis.  
Initial major changes to the protocol of study 2019nCoV-302 (Version 4.0 (25 February 2021) included 
demoting a co-primary endpoint (protection against moderate-severe disease) to a secondary 
endpoint, and increasing recruitment.  
Changes to the protocols are not expected to have impacted the robustness of the primary endpoint 
and overall study conclusions.

Baseline data 
2019nCoV-301: Demographics and baseline characteristics of participants in the PP-EFF Analysis Set 
were well balanced between the NVX-CoV2373 and placebo groups. Median age was 47.0 years, with 
all participants ranging in age from 18 to 95 years. Approximately 11.8% of participants were ≥ 65 
years of age, with 10.7% aged ≥ 65 to ≤ 74 years and 1.7% (n=405) aged ≥ 75 to ≤ 84 years. 
Approximately half the participants were male (51.8%), while the majority (75.9%) were White, and 
not of Hispanic or Latino origin (78.2%) and located in the United States (94.0%). Black or African 
Americans (11.0%), American Indians or Alaska Natives (6.2%), and Asians (4.4%) were well 
represented compared to the US population (US Census Bureau 2021). The majority of participants 
were overweight or obese (69.9%), with more than a third being obese (37.2%). Most participants 
(95.2%) were categorised as high-risk adults for acquiring or experiencing complications of COVID-19. 
A breakdown of underlying comorbidities at baseline in the study population is presented in Table 24. 
Baseline characteristics were similar between the PP-EFF analysis set and the safety population. 
Further, within the Safety population, most participants (93.5%) had a seronegative (based on anti-NP 
serology) and PCR negative (based on negative nasal swab PCR) baseline status prior to 
randomisation.

participants ranging in age from 18 to 84 years. Approximately 28% of participants were ≥ 65 years of 
age, with 23.2% aged ≥ 65 to ≤ 74 years and around 4.1% (n=614) aged ≥ 75 to ≤ 84 years. 
Approximately half the participants were male (51.6%), and most were White (94.5%) and not of 
Hispanic or Latino origin (87.8%). All participants in the PP-Analysis set had a negative (or missing) 
baseline serostatus, and nearly 45% of participants were identified as having at least 1 comorbid 
condition reported as a medical history or had a screening BMI > 30 kg/m2. A breakdown of 
underlying comorbidities at baseline in the study population is presented in Table 24. Demographics 
and baseline characteristics of participants in the ITT Analysis Set were similar with the PP-EFF 
Analysis Set. Further, within the ITT population, most participants had a seronegative (based on anti-
NP serology) or PCR negative (based on negative nasal swab PCR) baseline status prior to 
randomisation of 99.4% and 95.8%, respectively.

Numbers analysed 
2019nCoV-301 
Of the 29,949 participants randomised, 29,949 (100%) were in the ITT Analysis Set, 29,582 (98.8%) 
were in the FAS, and 29,582 (98.8%) were in the Safety Analysis Set. The PP-EFF Analysis Set 
included 25,452 (85.0%) randomised participants, with 17,312 (86.7%) in the NVX-CoV2373 group 
and 8,140 (81.5%) in the placebo group. Overall, data analysis sets were generally well balanced 
between the 2 study vaccine groups. 
Table 18. Analysis Sets (All Randomised Participants, 2019nCoV-301) 
The FAS excluded 289 (1.0%) participants (195 [1.0%] in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 94 [0.9%] in 
the placebo group), predominantly due to the exclusion of all participants from Site US151 and 14 
participants from Site 076. Site US151 is being terminated from participating in Clinical Study 
2019nCoV-301 for critical and major observations identified during a for-cause audit regarding the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021

Principal Investigator’s lack of compliance with regulations in place. There were 280 subjects 
randomised at this site with approximately 248 subjects ongoing.  
Study discontinuation occurred in 1,619 (8.1%) in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 1,391 (13.9%) in the 
placebo group, most frequently due to withdrawal by participant (NVX-CoV2373 5.5%, placebo 11%).  
Fourteen participants from Site US076 were excluded due to having received NVX-CoV2373 from 
single-dose vials rather than the multi-dose vial. 
The PP-EFF Analysis Set excluded 4,497 (15.0%) participants (2,653 [13.3%] in the NVX-CoV2373 
group and 1,844 [18.5%] in the placebo group). The most frequent (incidence > 2.00% in any vaccine 
group) reasons for exclusion were baseline positive anti-NP result (5.6%), censored prior to 
observation period (4.5%), did not complete vaccination schedule (4.0%), and protocol deviation 
(3.3%). 
Approximately 18% of participants were unblinded to study treatment assignment during the course of 
the study. The most frequent reason was to receive an authorised vaccine. There was an obvious 
imbalance between treatment groups with a higher proportion of placebo recipients (23.4%) 
requesting unblinding than vaccine recipients (15.2%), observed for most clinical sites. It is speculated 
that this difference may reflect the perception of study participants based on their reactogenicity 
symptoms or serologic testing outside of the study. No obvious association between reactogenicity 
profile and request for unblinding has been observed (supporting tables not shown). Data on serologic 
testing outside of the study has not been collected. Further it is noted that a larger proportion of 
participants in the placebo group did not receive their second dose compared to the participants in 
NVX-CoV2373 group (3.2% vs 4.4%). Also, a larger proportion of participants in the placebo group 
discontinued the study (8.1% vs 13.9%). 
2019nCoV-302 
Of the 15,187 participants randomised, 15,139 (99.7%) were in the ITT and Safety Analysis Sets with 
7,569 in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 7,570 in the placebo group (Table 26). 
The PP-EFF Analysis Set included 14,039 (92.4%) randomised participants, with 7,020 in the NVX-
CoV2373 group and 7,019 in the placebo group. A total of 1,100 (7.3%) participants were excluded 
from the PP-EFF Analysis Set, the most frequent (incidence > 1.0%) reasons for exclusion from the PP-
EFF Analysis Set were positive serostatus before 7 days after second vaccination, missed 1 dose of 
study vaccine, and positive PCR test before 7 days after second vaccination. 
Approximately one-third of participants (34.6%) were unblinded to study vaccine assignment during 
the course of the study). The most frequent reason was receipt of an authorised vaccine. Most (98.2%) 
unblinded participants continued to be followed up in the study.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoint  
2019nCoV-301 
After the protocol revision one single primary analysis was performed. 
For the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, there were 77 cases. Of these cases, 14 (0.1%) were 
in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 63 (0.8%) were in the placebo group; all 14 cases in the NVX-CoV2373 
group were mild in severity; 59 cases in the placebo group were mild or moderate and 5 were severe. 
There were 3 hospitalisations due to COVID-19 among the 77 per-protocol COVID-19 cases in this 
study. The resultant VE was 90.40% (95% CI: 82.88, 94.62), with a p-value of < 0.001 confirming 
the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI > 30% and meeting the prespecified study success criterion 
of the study.  
2019nCoV-302 
Confirmatory interim analysis 
There were 62 cases accrued for the prespecified interim analysis of the primary endpoint, with 6 
(<0.1%) in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 56 (0.8%) in the placebo group. The resultant estimated VE 
was 89.3% (alpha-adjusted 96.9% CI: 73.0, 95.8; p < 0.0001), with an alpha-adjusted LBCI > 30% 
meeting the prespecified study success criterion. 
Final primary efficacy analysis  
There were 106 cases for the final prespecified analysis of the primary endpoint, with 10 (0.1%) in the 
NVX-CoV2373 group and 96 (1.4%) in the placebo group. All but 4 cases were mild or moderate in 
severity, with all 4 severe cases, including 1 hospitalisation and 1 person with a pulmonary embolism, 
occurring in the placebo group. The resultant estimated VE was 89.7% (95% CI: 80.2, 94.6; p < 
0.001), with an LBCI > 30% meeting the prespecified study success criterion. These findings 
confirmed the results of the interim analysis of the primary endpoint.

First episode of PCR-positive COVID-19, as defined under the primary endpoint, shown by gene 
sequencing to represent a variant not considered as a “variant of concern / interest” according to 
the CDC Variants Classification. 
Viral genetic sequences were available for 54 of 77 primary endpoint cases in the PP-EFF.  
Ten of these cases (0 in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 10 [0.1%] in the placebo group) were prototype-
like and did not contain any of the mutations that would identify them as a VOC/VOI, including 3 that 
were moderate or severe. Resequencing of the PCR-positive cases that had not initially yielded 
sequencing results resulted in an additional 3 mild cases with non-VOC/VOI sequences in the placebo 
group (for a total of 13 [0.2%] cases). 
The VE of NVX-CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 due to a SARS-
CoV-2 variant not considered as a VOC/VOI in serologically negative (to SARS-CoV-2) adult 
participants was 100% (95% CI: 80.8, 100; p < 0.001), and 100% (95% CI: 85.8, 100) with the 3 
additional sequenced cases. 
- 
First episode of PCR-positive moderate or severe COVID-19, as defined under the primary 
endpoint. 
There were 14 cases of PCR-confirmed symptomatic moderate or severe COVID-19 with onset from 
at least 7 days after second vaccination accrued for this analysis, with 0 in the NVX-CoV2373 group 
and 14 (0.2%) in the placebo group. The resultant VE of NVX-CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic 
moderate or severe COVID-19 in baseline seronegative (to-SARS-CoV-2) adult participants was 100% 
(95% CI: 87.0, 100). 
- 
First episode of PCR-positive COVID-19, as defined under the primary endpoint, shown by gene 
sequencing to represent a “variant of concern / interest” according to the CDC Variants 
Classification. 
Of the 276 cases with onset from first vaccination, 14 were virologically confirmed with at least one 
COVID-19 symptom and 262 were mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19. Of the 262 PCR-positive cases 
of mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19, 203 had sequence data available as summarised. Of these, 82 
were identified as VOC/VOI clades, lineages, or variants of SARS-CoV-2. The most common VOC were 
B.1.1.7 (Alpha), which occurred in 46 cases. During the period of case accrual, no cases of infection 
due to the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant were identified.

Disease with Onset from First Vaccination in Adult Participants Who Received at Least 1 
Dose of Study Vaccine Regardless of Baseline Serostatus (Full Analysis Set, 2019nCoV-301) 
In the PP-EFF Analysis Set, 44 cases (6 in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 38 in the placebo group) had 
mutations that would identify them as a VOC or VOI. In the NVX-CoV2373 group, all 6 cases were mild 
in severity; in the placebo group, 9 of 38 cases were moderate or severe. The resultant VE of NVX-
CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 due to a SARS-CoV-2 variant 
considered a VOC or VOI in baseline seronegative adult participants was 93. 2% (95% CI: 83.97, 
97.1), with a p-value < 0.001 confirming the lower bound of the one-sided 95% CI > 0%.

PCR results of the final analysis by SARS-CoV-2 strain showed estimated VEs of NVX-CoV2373 to 
prevent symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 in baseline seronegative (to SARS-CoV-2) 
participants were 86.3% (95% CI: 71.3, 93.5) for the UK (Alpha) variant B.1.1.7 and 96.4% (95% CI:

There were 77 out of 106 cases of PCR-confirmed symptomatic moderate or severe COVID-19 with 
onset from at least 7 days after second vaccination, with 9 (0.1%) in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 68 
(1.0%) in the placebo group. The resultant estimated VE of NVX-CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic 
moderate or severe COVID-19 in baseline seronegative (to SARS-CoV- 2) adult participants was 86.9% 
(95% CI: 73.7, 93.5).  
- 
Protection against symptomatic severe COVID-19 with onset at least 7 days after second study 
vaccination (e.g., Day 28) in baseline seronegative subjects. 
At the time of the final analysis there were 4 cases classified as severe in the placebo group and none 
in the NVX-CoV2373 group occurring at least 7 days after the second dose in serologically negative 
adult participants in the PP-EFF analysis set.  
- 
Protection against hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or mechanical ventilation 
linked to any virologically confirmed COVID-19 with onset at least 7 days after second study 
vaccination (e.g., Day 28) in adult participants regardless of their serostatus at baseline. 
There were 2 cases of PCR-confirmed symptomatic moderate or severe COVID-19 requiring 
hospitalisation, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation with onset from at least 7 days after second 
vaccination in serologically negative adult participants, with 0 in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 2 in the 
placebo group.  
- 
Protection against COVID-19 in adults regardless of baseline serostatus 
There were 107 cases of PCR-confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 with an 
onset from at least 7 days after second vaccination in participants regardless of baseline serostatus, 
with 10 (0.1%) in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 97 (1.3%) in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy of 
NVX-CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 in adult participants 
regardless of baseline serostatus was estimated to be 89.8% (95% CI: 80.5, 94.7). 
There were 183 cases of PCR-confirmed mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 with onset from first 
vaccination through the data cut-off date of the final analysis of the primary endpoint. PCR-confirmed 
COVID-19 occurred in 42 (0.6%) participants (1.742/1,000 person-years) in the NVX-CoV2373 group 
and 141 (1.9%) cases (1.728/1,000 person-years) in the placebo group at the time of the final 
analysis of the primary endpoint (median surveillance time 85 days), with no participant having more 
than 1 episode of COVID-19. The resultant estimated VE of NVX-CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic 
mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 from first vaccination in adults regardless of baseline serostatus 
was 70.5% (95% CI: 58.0, 79.6; Clopper-Pearson method). The vaccine efficacy against confirmed 
mild, moderate or severe COVID-19 with onset after first vaccination in adults regardless of baseline 
serostatus is shown in Table 27 for different time periods.

Vaccine efficacy adjusted for surveillance time was 24.0% (-38.1, 58.1), 42.8% (-16.2, 71.9) and 
57.1% (-18.8, 86.5) when onset was from at least 7 days, 10 days and 14 days after first vaccination 
and an observation period up to the second vaccination. The median duration of illness was 12.5 days 
in the vaccine group and 13.0 days in the placebo group.  
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 2019nCoV-301 
The VEs of NVX-CoV2373 at the time of the final analysis of the primary endpoint, for which an 
adequate number of cases were identified, were consistent across major demographic and baseline 
characteristic subgroups and are shown in the tabled overview below. The relatively lower VE of 67.3% 
(95% CI: 18.7, 86.8) for participants of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, may reflect social or economic 
characteristics in the locations where the participants were enrolled. Immunogenicity, measured by 
anti-S IgG ELISA assay, neutralising antibody titers, and hACE2 receptor binding inhibition titers at 
baseline and Day 35, demonstrated that the immune responses in Hispanic/Latino participants were 
equivalent (although uniformly slightly higher) to those in non-Hispanic/Latino participants.

and strata (age-group and pooled region) as fixed effects and robust error variance [Zou 2004]. 
3. The Clopper-Pearson model replaced the log-linear model using the modified Poisson regression because few events were 
observed in at least 1 of the study vaccine groups (or at least 1 stratum) and Poisson regression analysis failed to converge. The 
95% CIs calculated using the Clopper-Pearson exact binomial method adjusted for the total surveillance time. 
4. Comorbid participants were those who had at least 1 of the comorbid conditions reported as a medical history or had a 
screening BMI > 30 kg/m2.

*Calculations of the percentages have been performed by the assessment team. Up to 4 tests could have been 
taken per person, although not all participants had in fact taken 4 tests. This number was considered for the 
calculations. 
There were no major differences in acute illness visits between the trial arms. The percentage of 
participants randomised who were tested and had a negative test result was comparable over the 
study arms, while the percentage positive tests was different.

Primary Analysis 
The Per-Protocol Efficacy (PP-EFF) Analysis Set included all participants 
who received the full prescribed regimen of trial vaccine and had no major 
protocol deviations that occurred before the first COVID-19 positive episode 
and were determined to affect the efficacy outcomes, including baseline 
SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity or nasal swab PCR -positivity. Participants who 
were unblinded with an intention to receive other COVID-19 vaccines were 
censored at the time of unblinding. Although the study enrolled participants 
regardless of SARS-CoV-2 serologic status at the time of initial vaccination, 
any participants with confirmed infection or prior infection (due to SARS-
CoV-2 at baseline, by nasal swab PCR or serology assessed by Anti- 
Nucleocapsid, were excluded from the PP-EFF population. PP-EFF was the 
primary set for all efficacy endpoints.

2.6.5.3.  Supportive study 
Study 2019nCoV-501 is an ongoing phase 2 randomised, observer blinded placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of NVX-CoV2373 in South African adult subjects 
living without HIV and safety and immunogenicity in adults living with HIV.  
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 compared to placebo 
on the occurrence of symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe confirmed COVID-19 as demonstrated by 
qualitative PCR in serologically naïve (to SARS- CoV-2) healthy HIV-negative and medically stable HIV-
positive adult participants (analysed as an overall population). 
Methods 
Eligible HIV-negative participants (Cohort 1) were healthy males/females ≥ 18 to < 85 years of age, 
with a BMI between 17-40 kg/m2 and a documented HIV-negative test result. Eligible HIV-positive 
participants (Cohort 2) were medically stable (free of opportunistic infections) males/females, ≥ 18 to 
< 65 years of age, with a BMI between 17-40 kg/m2, receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy 
using the same regimen within at least 8 weeks before screening, and having an HIV-1 viral load < 
1000 copies/mL within 45 days of randomisation. Excluded participants, regardless of HIV status, 
included pregnant women, and persons with potential COVID-19. A negative SARS-CoV-2 results 
within 5 days prior to first vaccination was required. Enrolment was staggered to ensure safety. 
Participants 65 to < 85 years of age were only enrolled at second stage. 
Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive up to 2 IM injections (Day 0 and Day 21) of SARS-CoV-2 
rS with Matrix-M1 adjuvant or placebo. At 6 months (± 15 days) after the last vaccination in the initial 
vaccination period (Day 201), participants were to be given the option to enter into the crossover 
vaccination period. The duration of the study, excluding screening, was to be approximately 12 months 
after the last vaccination in the initial vaccination period. 
The primary endpoint was PCR-confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 in 
serologically naïve (to SARS-CoV-2) healthy HIV-negative and medically stable HIV-positive adult 
participants, analysed overall, with a lower bound CI of > 0, from 7 days after the second vaccine dose 
until the endpoint-driven efficacy analysis is triggered by the occurrence of a prespecified number of

blinded endpoints across the 2 study vaccine arms and/or at prespecified time points during the initial 
vaccination period. Secondary endpoints included the efficacy in HIV-positive and HIV-negative 
participants analysed separately, as well as protection against symptomatic mild or moderate or 
symptomatic moderate or severe COVID-19. Protection against COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation 
(regardless of severity) or resulting in death was also analysed.  
Of note, the immunogenicity and safety objectives and endpoints are discussed in the corresponding 
sections of this AR. 
Results 
Study 2019nCoV-501 was initiated on 17 August 2020 (first participant screened) and completed 
enrolment into the initial phase on 25 November 2020. Participants were enrolled at 16 sites in South 
Africa. 
In total, 4,419 subjects were randomised (4,173 HIV-negative and 246 HIV-positive). At the cut-off 
date, 4,325 (97.9%) were continuing in follow-up and 94 (2.1%) had discontinued the study. The PP-
EFF Analysis Set included 2,770 (62.7%) participants. The most frequent reasons for exclusion from 
the PP-EFF Analysis Set were positive PCR test or PCR-confirmed illness episode before 7 days after 
second study vaccination (n=1,488, 33.7%) and missed 1 dose of study vaccine (n=148, 3.3%).  
Demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the NVX-CoV2373 and placebo 
groups, overall and by HIV status. Of participants, 94% were HIV-negative. Median age was 28 years 
(range: 18 to 84 years); 40% were female; 91% were Black/African American; 2% were White; 3% 
were multiple races, 1% were Asian; and 2% were Hispanic or Latino. 5.5%. were HIV-positive. At 
baseline, 34.1% of participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. For HIV positive participants, the 
majority (63.9%) had no co-morbidities. Median baseline CD4 level was 738 cells/μL (range 80 to 
2,076 cells/μL) and median baseline HIV viral load was 63.5 copies/mL (range 20 to 735 copies/mL). 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
A total of 44 cases of symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 cases in serologically naïve 
healthy HIV-negative and medically stable HIV-positive adult participants were accrued between 23 
November and 30 December 2020 for the official event-driven analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint 
(data extraction 18 January 2021), with 15 (1.11%) cases in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 29 (2.19%) 
cases in the placebo group. The VE was 49.4% (95% CI: 6.1, 72.8). All but 1 case was mild or 
moderate in severity, with the severe case occurring in the placebo group.  
Final analysis 
A total of 147 symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 cases among all adult participants, 
seronegative (to SARS-CoV-2) at baseline, were accrued for the complete analysis (PP-EFF Analysis 
Set) of the primary efficacy endpoint (data extraction 23 February 2021), with 51 (3.62%) cases for 
NVX-CoV2373 versus 96 (7.05%) cases for placebo. The resultant VE of NVX-CoV2373 in prevention of 
symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 in adult participants, seronegative (to SARS-CoV-2) 
at baseline, was 48.6% (95% CI: 28.4, 63.1). The cumulative incidence curves in both vaccine groups 
is presented in Figure 11.

Prevention of COVID-19 hospitalisation 
There were 5 cases of hospitalisation among all adult participants seronegative (to SARS-CoV-2) at 
baseline, from 7 days after second vaccination (Day 28). All occurred in the placebo group.  
Prevention of COVID-19 stratified by severity 
Among all participants seronegative (to SARS-CoV-2) at baseline, from 7 days after second 
vaccination, the level of prevention of mild COVID-19 was 68.7%, 95% CI: 38.5, 84.1, that of 
moderate COVID-19 was 32.1%, 95% CI: -1.0, 54.4, and 100%, 95% CI: -5.6, 100 against severe 
COVID-19.  
Efficacy by SARS-CoV-2 variant 
Forty-one (93.2%) of 44 participants with a primary efficacy endpoint had whole genome sequence 
data available (samples from 3 cases in the placebo group could not be sequenced), and 38 (92.7%) of 
41 were identified as the B.1.351 variant, resulting in a post-hoc VE of NVX-CoV2373 (PP-EFF Analysis 
Set) in prevention of symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 in all adult participants, 
seronegative (to SARS-CoV-2) at baseline, of 43.0% (95% CI: -9.8, 70.4) for the B.1.351 South 
African variant. 
Efficacy in subgroups 
By SARS-CoV-2 serostatus at baseline 
A total of 147 and 39 symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 cases occurring at least 7 
days post dose 2, among all adult participants, seronegative (to SARS-CoV-2) or seropositive at 
baseline were accrued for analysis. The VEs of NVX-CoV2373 in prevention of COVID-19 in all adult 
participants, seronegative (to SARS-CoV-2) or seropositive at baseline, were respectively 48.6% (95% 
CI: 28.4, 63.1) and 54.5% (95% CI: 11.1, 76.7), as shown in Table 32.

Among HIV-negative participants seronegative (to SARS-CoV-2) at baseline, the VE of NVX-CoV2373 in 
prevention of symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 was 55.4% (95% CI: 35.9, 68.9). 
Among HIV-positive participants seronegative (to SARS-CoV-2) at baseline the VE was -35.4% (95%

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
COVID-19 vaccine NVX-CoV2373 is meant for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by 
SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older. The following clinical studies were conducted by 
the applicant: two pivotal phase 3 trials, 2019nCoV-301 and 2019nCoV-302, and a supportive phase 2 
trial, 2019nCoV-501, conducted in South Africa in approximately 4500 subjects including HIV+ 
subjects in addition to a phase 1/2 dose finding trial, 2019nCoV-101. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of the selected dose of 5 μg SARS-CoV-2 rS vaccine +50 μg Matrix-M1 adjuvant (NVX-
COV2373) was assessed in two pivotal phase 3 clinical trials, 2019nCoV-302 and 2019nCoV-301. 
These were two randomised, observer blinded placebo-controlled trials conducted in approximately 
30,000 adults aged 18 years or older in the US and Mexico (2019nCoV-301) and 15,000 adults aged 
18-84 years in the UK (2019nCoV-302). The main efficacy objective of both trials was to demonstrate 
protective efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 given as a 2-dose vaccination regimen three weeks apart, in the 
prevention of virologically confirmed (by PCR to SARS-CoV-2), symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) with onset 7 days after second vaccination, as compared to placebo, in serologically 
negative (to SARS-CoV-2) adults. 
Both studies were placebo controlled, which is acceptable as there was no authorised COVID-19 
vaccine at the start of either study. In study 2019nCoV-302, single dose vials manufactured from 
Emergent BioSolutions (Emergent) were administered to the NVX-CoV2373 group. In study 2019nCoV-
301, material filled in multi-dose vials (MDV), manufactured by Par Pharmaceutical was used.  
The study population comprised of subjects 18 years and older, including individuals with underlying 
but stable chronic disease (e.g. diabetes, chronic lung disease, obesity) and older adults over 65 years 
CHMP assessment report

of age. In both studies efforts were made to include persons who were at high risk of COVID-19, 
aiming to include at least 25% of participants who were ≥ 65 years of age as well as prioritising other 
groups that are most affected by COVID-19, including racial and ethnic minorities. Pregnant and 
breastfeeding women were excluded from the trials as well as persons who were immune suppressed 
or had an immunodeficiency; few HIV+ were enrolled in supportive trial 2019nCoV-501. As both 
groups are highly relevant target groups for COVID-19 vaccination, it is important that the 
performance of NVX-CoV2373 is evaluated in these subgroups as soon as possible. Regarding children 
and adolescents, a paediatric development plan has been agreed with Paediatric Committee (PDCO). 
In 2019nCoV-302, participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio stratified by site and by age (18 to 64, 
≥ 65 years). In 2019nCoV-301, participants were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to NVX-CoV2373 or 
placebo and stratified by age (18 to 64 years and ≥ 65 years). By providing full blocks to a site, the 
randomisation was also stratified by site. An adapted randomisation list, including randomisation time, 
will be shared by the applicant post-authorisation. Further, both trials were designed as single-blinded 
trials, with vaccination administrators potentially being aware of treatment allocation. In addition, 
although separate blinded and unblinded teams were set-up, any communication between the blinded 
and unblinded teams cannot be fully excluded and therefore blinding cannot be fully guaranteed.  
The primary endpoint for both trials, i.e. the first episode of PCR-positive mild, moderate, or severe 
COVID-19 with onset at least 7 days after second study vaccination (Day 28), is in line with applicable 
regulatory guidance on the evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines, is clinically relevant and agreed. Cases 
were either classified as being mild, moderate or severe according to pre-defined definitions which 
differed slightly between the two trials. Whilst it may be argued that cases classified as moderate 
according to these definitions were in fact mild, this has little impact on the actual outcome of the trials 
as all cases regardless of severity are considered for the primary endpoint. However, it should be kept 
in mind for the interpretation of secondary analyses. The classification of cases was performed with a 
programmatic algorithm. In 2019nCoV-301, because of the potential for the programmatic algorithm 
to over-estimate the severity of disease (largely due to spuriously low oxygen saturations reported by 
participants), further medical review of all cases categorised as “severe” was performed by 
independent infectious disease and critical care physicians. This was not done for 2019nCoV-302. 
Further, the accuracy of the programmatic algorithms to distinguish mild from moderate cases is 
unknown, therefore categorisation of cases according to severity were not included in the SmPC. 
Severe cases may be reflected following review of narratives. 
In general methods for case detection appear sufficiently appropriate. Assessment of probable COVID-
19 cases followed reporting by study participants of respiratory and clinical signs/symptoms recognised 
to be predictive of COVID-19 (predefined) and subsequent laboratory confirmation of infection of 
SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs by RT-PCR. Swabs were collected through self-swabbing by individuals 
(2019nCoV-301, 2019nCoV-302) and by study personnel at a triggered surveillance visit (2019nCoV-
301 only). Non-study swabs were permitted in 2019nCoV-302, and if a valid report existed for testing 
outside the study these swabs were treated identically to a study swab. Even though non-study swabs 
were discouraged, non-study swabs accounted for 15% of positive swabs overall. This is considerable. 
Furthermore, in comparison with study swabs there was a higher positivity rate in both the NVX-
CoV2373 as the placebo group. The difference in positivity rate between non-study and study swabs 
was higher in the vaccine vs the placebo group. It is considered that this will not impact the overall 
conclusion of the trial. However, the applicant is expected to submit sensitivity analyses in which non-
study swabs were excluded at the time of the next interim CSR submission (Q1 2022). Also, a 
discussion of reasons for this discrepancy in positivity rates will be expected to be submitted with these 
sensitivity analyses post-authorisation. 
Numerous secondary endpoints were listed for both trials with varying relevance. For both trials the 
applicant listed ‘key’ secondary endpoints: protection against moderate or severe PCR confirmed 
CHMP assessment report

COVID-19 (2019nCoV-302) (not multiplicity controlled) and protection against COVID-19 not caused 
by Variants of Interest or Concern (VOI/VOC) (multiplicity controlled). Whilst protection against severe 
COVID-19 (including hospital admissions, ICU admissions and death) is considered an important 
endpoint, protection against ‘moderate to severe’ is considered of less relevance, particularly as the 
definition of moderate has large overlap with mild symptomatic disease and there is uncertainty 
around the accuracy of the assessment of moderate cases. Further, whilst it is considered relevant to 
determine whether the immune response elicited by the vaccine also protects against circulating 
variants which are of interest from a public health perspective due to higher transmissibility or more 
severe disease, this is difficult to determine, as comparisons may be biased due to the non-random 
introduction of these variants. It is not considered very relevant to have an estimate of efficacy against 
variants that are not classified as being of concern or interest, which is the key secondary endpoint for 
2019nCoV-301, therefore the hierarchical testing approach is considered of limited value. 
For study 2019nCoV-302 a single interim analysis of efficacy using the Lan-DeMets alpha-spending 
function for Pocock boundary conditions was planned to be conducted based on the accumulation of 
approximately 50 events of the total anticipated target number of 100 for the primary endpoint. 
For study 2019nCoV-301 two interim analyses for efficacy and futility were planned targeting a total of 
144 cases. However, with the implementation of the blinded crossover, the placebo-controlled portion 
ended, and both interim analyses were removed in a protocol revision. The DSMB was unblinded and 
reviewed the distribution of PCR+ cases over the trial arms during the study. The requested DSMB 
minutes have been provided. They provide sufficient reassurance that the timing of the interim 
analyses were not informed by knowledge on the efficacy of the vaccine by the DSMB. The amendment 
was made prior to the DSMB discussion and was therefore independently taken. 
In 2019nCoV-302, the primary and secondary efficacy analyses was based on the PP-EFF and 
supported by ITT Analysis Sets whilst in 2019nCoV-301 the primary analysis was conducted in the PP-
EFF set supported by the FAS set. Further, the primary efficacy endpoint in 2019nCoV-301 was 
evaluated among the seropositive and seronegative participants in the PP-EFF2 set. 
The primary endpoint was analysed using modified Poisson regression, with a sensitivity analysis using 
a Cox proportional hazards model accounting for stratification factors. The primary hypothesis in both 
trials was to determine that the (multiplicity adjusted) lower bound of the confidence interval around 
the estimate of vaccine efficacy (100 x (1 – RR)) was above 30%. Presented statistical methods are 
generally considered acceptable. In study 2019nCOV-302 various strategies are applied on handling 
intercurrent events for each of the two proposed estimands, no estimand has been defined in study 
2019nCoV-301. In addition, conventional terminology including per protocol analysis has also been 
used. The applicant clarified that as at the time of writing the protocol the estimand framework had not 
been fully implemented by all regulators globally, and it was later decided to introduce the estimand 
framework in the SAP. The applicant will provide supportive analysis in Q2 2022. 
Sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of potential informative censoring due to early unblinding for 
intention to receive an Emergency Use Authorization vaccine were planned. The efficacy of NVX-
CoV2373 was planned to be explored in several subgroups, such as age, presence of underlying risk 
factors, ethnicity and race.  
In conclusion, overall, the design and conduct of the studies were appropriate and in line with the 
requirements as laid down in the Guideline on clinical evaluation of new Vaccines 
(EMA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005) and the EMA considerations on COVID-19 vaccines approval. Overall 
primary and secondary efficacy objectives as defined in the phase 3 trials are of relevance to inform 
the efficacy of NVX-CoV2373.

The disposition of study participants in the various analysis sets were generally well balanced across 
treatment groups. A reasonable proportion of participants was over 65 years of age (27%) in 
2019nCoV-302, compared to 12.6% of the safety population of 2019nCoV-301. Study 2019nCoV-301 
included participants up to 95 years of age whilst -302 capped inclusion at 85 years.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Vaccine efficacy according to the primary efficacy endpoint was demonstrated for both pivotal trials. 
The inferential analysis at the interim analysis in 2019nCoV-302 indicated a VE point estimate of 
89.3% with a multiplicity adjusted 96.9% CI of 73.0% to 95.8%, meeting the prespecified study 
success criterion of an alpha-adjusted LBCI > 30%. This interim was based on 62 accrued cases. VE 
was consistent in the final efficacy analysis after accrual of 106 cases, with an estimated VE of 89.7% 
(95%CI: 80.2, 94.6%). The final efficacy evaluation is based on a median follow-up of 90 days, 
limiting VE estimates to be applicable short-term. Longer-term vaccine efficacy remains currently 
unknown and will be further followed post-authorisation. Of the 106 cases, 4 were classified as severe 
(all in the placebo group). Of these, two were hospitalised. Pre-planned analyses assessing the 
sensitivity to model assumptions (Cox regression), missing data (tipping point analysis) as well as 
supportive analyses assessing different intercurrent event handling are planned by the applicant for 
2022. An analysis taking into account overrunning cases not listed on the confirmed event list for the 
final analysis is also expected in 2022. 
A single final analysis was conducted in 2019nCoV-301, based on 77 cases with 14 in the NVX-
CoV2373 group and 63 in the placebo group. The resultant estimated VE was 90.4% (95% CI: 82.9, 
94.6), which is in line with the findings from 2019nCoV-302. This evaluation is based on a median 
follow up time of 76 days after the second dose of NVX-CoV2373. There were 4 severe cases including 
3 hospitalisations due to COVID-19 among the 77 per-protocol COVID-19 cases in 2019nCoV-301 (all 
in the placebo group). Sensitivity analyses with Cox regression were consistent (VE: 90.4%), as well 
as the effect in adults regardless of serostatus at baseline. The latter is unsurprising considering the 
small proportion of participants who were seropositive, therefore no conclusions on efficacy in 
seropositive subjects can be drawn. Sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of potential informative 
censoring due to early unblinding for intention to receive an Emergency Use Authorization vaccine are 
planned for 2022. 
Both trials were conducted during a time that COVID-19 vaccines became available. 2019nCoV-302 
was started earlier than 2019nCoV-301, September vs December 2020 respectively, and is therefore 
differently impacted by this. Although there was substantial unblinding in 2019nCoV-302, with one-
third of participants unblinded to study vaccine assignment during the course of the study this was 
balanced between the groups (33.8% in the NVX-COV2373 group vs 35.4% in the placebo group). It is 
likely that the duration of follow-up is shorter for selective groups who were eligible first to receive an 
authorised vaccine through their national vaccination campaign, e.g. elderly and health care workers. 
However, as vaccine efficacy was fairly consistent across different risk groups and duration of follow-up 
is still relatively short, major impact is unlikely. In study 2019nCoV-301 there is an obvious imbalance 
in unblinding between the study arms, with more participants in the placebo group requesting 
unblinding (15.2% vs 23.4%). Overall, the percentage of unblinding is lower than in study 2019nCoV-
302, however, the implementation of the blinded crossover, offering NVX-COV2373 to all participants 
was much earlier in the conduct of the 2019nCoV -301 study (4 months after study start) than it was 
in the -302 study (6 months after study start). Further, a larger proportion of participants (3.2%) did 
not receive their second dose in the 2019nCoV-301 trial compared to 2019nCoV-302 (1.0%), with 
again more participants in the placebo group (3.2% vs 4.4%). Also, a larger proportion of participants 
in the placebo group discontinued the study (8.1% vs 13.9%).

A trend for increased requests for unblinding to treatment received in the placebo arm compared to the 
NVX-COV2373 arm was observed for most clinical sites in study 2019nCoV-301, but not in study 
2019nCoV-302. No obvious association between reactogenicity profile and request for unblinding has 
been observed, although this does not preclude that placebo recipients might still have been able to 
guess their treatment allocation, with potential impact on their behaviour (potentially impacting the 
risk of being exposed and reporting of symptoms and collection of endpoint data). To assess whether 
potential unblinding had an impact on the reporting of symptoms and collection of endpoint data, the 
applicant was requested to provide per treatment arm an overview of the unscheduled surveillance 
visits, number of swabs taken, number of positive and negative tested cases. There were no major 
differences in acute illness visits in the active and placebo arm (8.3% vs 8.7% in 2019nCOV-301and 
28% vs 28% in 2019nCOV-302). The percentage of participants randomised who were tested and had 
a negative test result was comparable for the active and placebo arm (6.8% vs 6.6% in 2019nCOV-
301 and 5.0% and 4.7% in 2019nCOV-302), while as expected a difference was observed in the 
percentage of positive tests. This indicates that even though in study 301 there was some awareness 
of the treatment received, there were likely no major differences in risks of being exposed, reporting 
illness or tests taken over the study arms. It is unlikely that this severely biased the efficacy estimates. 
Sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of potential informative censoring due to early unblinding for 
intention to receive an Emergency Use Authorization vaccine were planned but have not been provided 
yet. Given that the lower bound of the confidence interval was far from the pre-specified null 
hypothesis, and based on the information provided, it is unlikely that it would change the conclusions. 
Sensitivity analysis are expected to be provided in Q2 2022. For both trials, cumulative incidence rates 
were increasing constantly after randomisation in the placebo group but remained low in the vaccine 
group. These analyses show that the cases in the two groups start diverging around day 21, indicating 
no measurable efficacy before the administration of the second dose in both trials which is further 
supported by analyses considering the protection after a first dose. Within the trials the vaccine was 
mostly given with a 3-week interval. In those who received a second dose, the at least 50% received 
the vaccine between day 21 and 23. Therefore it is deemed appropriate that section 4.2 of the SmPC 
simply states that the 2 doses are recommended to be given with a 21-day interval.  
The vaccine was administered in the PP-EFF as early as day 14 up to day 60 in study 2019nCoV-301 
and between day 16 and day 45 in study 2019nCoV-302, the IQR was 21 to 23 days for the ITT/FAS 
population in both trials. This information is reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
There were insufficient severe cases (n=8) and hospitalised cases (n=5) or deaths (n=0) to reliably 
estimate the VE against more severe outcomes.  
In 2019nCoV-301, viral genetic sequences were available for 54 of 77 primary endpoint cases in the 
PP-EFF. Of these, 44 cases had mutations that would identify them as a VOC or VOI, 6 in the NVX-
CoV2373 group and 38 in the placebo group, suggesting that efficacy is maintained against circulating 
variants which included B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.429 (Epsilon) and B.1.526 (Iota). There were no cases 
due to the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant in either trial. In 2019nCoV-302, for the final analysis, 66 cases 
were characterised as B.1.1.7, and 29 as Wuhan, characterisation of 11 cases is unknown. Overall, 
efficacy was shown against the B.1.1.7 variant. Strain specific efficacy results should however be 
interpreted with caution given the low number of cases for individual strains (1 vs 28 for the Wuhan 
strain), and potential confounding due to differences in baseline characteristics or unknown 
confounding factors.  
In addition, subgroup analyses showed that vaccine efficacy is consistent across different risk groups, 
subjects with various underlying diseases and different demographic characteristics, although limited 
numbers in certain subgroups preclude strong conclusions.

Further support for the efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 comes from trial 2019nCoV-501 which was conducted 
in South Africa and included both HIV-negative and HIV-positive participants.  
A total of 44 cases of symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 cases in serologically naïve 
healthy HIV-negative and medically stable HIV-positive adult participants were accrued between 23 
November and 30 December 2020 for the official event-driven analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint 
(data extraction 18 January 2021), with 15 (1.11%) cases in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 29 (2.19%) 
cases in the placebo group. The estimated VE was 49.4% (95% CI: 6.1, 72.8). This is mainly driven by 
efficacy in HIV-negative participants, as efficacy in HIV-positive participants could not be established 
(overall VE -16.0%, 95% CI -182.5, 52.4). The complete analysis comprised of 147 cases, with 51 
(3.6%) cases for NVX-CoV2373 versus 96 (7.1%) cases for placebo. The estimated VE was 48.6% 
(95% CI: 28.4, 63.1). With only few cases accrued in HIV-positive participants (10 in NVX-CoV2373 vs 
8 in placebo), further evaluation of NVX-CoV2373 in HIV-positive persons would be relevant. The 
overall VE in this study is lower than what is observed in study 2019nCoV-302 and -301, also when 
looking only at the HIV-negative population. Whilst this may be explained by the circulating variant 
(Beta), immunogenicity results of the participants enrolled in this study also point to a reduced 
immune response after vaccination (measured against the Wuhan strain) compared to the response 
observed in 2019nCoV-302. As it is difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of the differences 
between the trials, it cannot be excluded that the lower VE is explained by more factors than the 
circulating virus variant alone, for example differences in baseline characteristics of the population 
enrolled or potential batch related issues.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the data available for NVX-CoV2373, a robust and high protective efficacy against COVID-19 
has been demonstrated in individuals aged 18 years and older in two pivotal observer blinded placebo 
controlled trials. Efficacy has been established for a median follow-up of 90 days in 2019nCoV-302 and 
76 days in 2019nCoV-302. The vaccine is efficacious across different high-risk groups including older 
adults, as well as subjects considered at increased risk of severe disease due to underlying chronic 
disease. Lower vaccine efficacy was observed in a supportive trial 2019nCoV-501 in South Africa, 
which was possibly due to reduced efficacy against the Beta variant, however other factors cannot be 
excluded. 
No major objections regarding clinical efficacy have been identified.  
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
Clinical safety was evaluated in the phase 1/2 trial 2019nCoV-101, phase 2 trial 2019nCoV-501 and 
the two pivotal phase 3 trials 2019nCoV-302 and 2019nCoV-301. 
Safety assessments include monitoring and recording of solicited (local and systemic reactogenicity 
events), unsolicited adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of special 
interest (AESI), and vital sign measurements. Safety laboratory values (haematology and serum 
chemistry) were also evaluated in the first-in-human Clinical Study 2019nCoV-101 (Part 1). 
Solicited local and systemic adverse events were collected for 7 days after each vaccine dose. Grading 
of solicited adverse events was based on FDA Toxicity Grading Scale for Clinical Abnormalities. 
Unsolicited AEs were recorded from the time of first study vaccination until Day 49 after the initial set 
of vaccinations (i.e. 28 days post dose 2) in each trial, and for the entire study period in 2019nCoV-
301. SAEs, medical attended adverse events (MAAEs) and AESIs were assessed for the entire study 
period in all trials.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 107/168 
 
 
 
AESIs included Potential Immune-Mediated Medical Conditions (PIMMCs) as well as events relevant to 
COVID-19.  
The investigator was to assess causality for all AEs and SAEs. AEs will be considered related if there is 
a reasonable possibility of relationship to study vaccine. The AE follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of study vaccine and cannot be reasonably explained by the participant’s 
clinical state or other factors (e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, or concomitant 
medications), represents a known reaction to study vaccine or other vaccines in its class, is consistent 
with the known pharmacological properties of the study vaccine, and/or resolves with discontinuation 
of the study vaccine (and/or recurs with re-challenge, if applicable). 
The main presentations of data are based on the Safety Analysis sets from submitted clinical trials, 
including all subject data with supporting presentations to exclude the data post-unblinding/post-
approved or deployed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine receipt. 
For 2019nCoV-301, incidence rates for AEs were presented to account for the imbalanced 
randomisation and imbalanced follow up time between treatment arms. For other trials, numbers of 
events and % are reported. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Participants from two phase 3 studies (2019nCoV-301, 2019nCoV-302), two phase 2 studies 
(2019nCoV-101 part 2, 2019nCoV-501) and one phase 1 study (2019nCoV-101 part 1) contributed to 
the safety database for NVX-CoV2373. In total 30,058 subjects have been exposed to at least one 
dose of NVX-CoV2373 (5 ug rS /50 ug adjuvant), with 19,892 participants receiving a placebo. Of 
these, over 96% have received two doses.  
Table 26. Exposure of Participants in the Pooled Analysis of Safety Data 
In the phase 1 study, 134 subjects aged 18-59 were randomised. Of these, 29 subjects received 2 
doses of the final formulation (5 ug rS /50 ug adjuvant) and 54 subjects received at least 1 dose of 25 
ug/50 ug vaccine formulation. In the phase 2 study 2019nCoV-101 (part 2), 1288 subjects were 
randomised, 1,283 participants received at least 1 dose of trial vaccine and 1,256 participants received 
both Dose 1 and Dose 2. Of these, 260 subjects received a single dose of NVX-CoV2373 (5 ug rS /50 
ug adjuvant), 254 subjects received two doses. In addition, 251 subjects received two doses and 263 
subjects received one dose of 25 ug/50 ug vaccine formulation (with a higher level of S-protein).

The median duration of follow-up in the pooled safety database was 70 days post-Dose 2, with 32,993 
(66%) participants completing more than 2 months follow-up post-Dose 2. The shorter median 
duration of follow-up in the pooled data as compared to the individual studies is due to censoring at 
unblinding. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Solicited local reactions 
There were higher frequencies of solicited local AEs among NVX-CoV2373 recipients than among 
placebo recipients in all trials. An overview of solicited local AEs is presented in Table 35. 
In 2019nCoV-302, following the first dose, solicited local AEs were reported by 59.3% of NVX-CoV2373 
recipients compared to 20.9% of placebo recipients. Following second dose the frequency of solicited 
local AEs in the NVX-CoV2373 group (80.2%) increased relative to the first vaccination (59.3%) and 
remained higher than in the placebo group (17.0%). Also, higher frequencies of grade 3 reactions were 
reported following the second dose, increasing from 1.1% to 5.2%. There was a slight increase in the 
frequency and intensity of reactions following the second dose in persons who reported mild (grade 0, 
grade 1) reactions following the first dose; of persons reporting grade 1 reactions following the first 
dose approximately 50% reported grade 2 or higher reactions following the second dose. Persons 
reporting moderate to severe reactions following the first dose tended to report similar or less severe 
reactions following the second dose.  
Tenderness and injection site pain were the most frequent solicited local AEs, reported by 705 (54.9%) 
and 394 (30.7%) participants, respectively, after the first dose and by 922 (76.6%) and 624 (51.9%) 
participants after the second dose. Median durations of tenderness and pain increased with the second 
dose from 2.0 to 3.0 and 1.0 to 2.0 days respectively. A similar picture emerged in 2019nCoV-301 and 
2019nCoV-101. In 2019nCoV-501 lower rates of local reactions were reported following the second 
dose compared to the first and they were less often severe.

Table 28. Solicited Local Adverse Events for 7 Days Following Each Vaccination Across the 
SARS-CoV-2 rS Clinical Development Programme 
Solicited systemic reactions 
Overall, there were higher frequencies of solicited systemic AEs among NVX-CoV2373 recipients than 
among placebo recipients following each vaccination overall and in each age cohort. An overview of 
solicited systemic AEs after each dose across the clinical trials is presented in Table 29 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 110/168

the SARS-CoV-2 rS Clinical Development Programme 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 111/168 
 
 
 
 
In 2019nCoV-302, solicited systemic AEs were reported by 47.6% of NVX-CoV2373 recipients following 
the first dose. This increased with the second dose to 64.6%. With the second dose, higher frequencies 
of grade 3 reactions were reported, increasing from 1.3% with the first dose to 6.8%. There was a 
modest increase in the frequency and intensity of reactions with the second dose for those persons 
who experienced mild (grade 0, grade 1) reactions with the first dose. Of participants reporting grade 
1 reactions with the first dose, 55% reported grade 2 or higher reactions following the second dose. Of 
participants who reported grade 3 or 4 reactions following the first dose, 60% reported less severe 
systemic reactions following the second dose. 
Headache, fatigue, and muscle pain were the most frequent solicited systemic AEs. Grade 3 headache, 
fatigue, and muscle pain were reported in 17 (1.4%), 43 (3.6%), and 34 (2.8%) participants in the 
NVX-CoV2373 group and 3 (0.3%), 9 (0.8%), and 3 (0.3%) participants in the placebo group. Median 
durations of headache, fatigue, and muscle pain were 1.0, 1.0, and 1.0 day in each study vaccine 
group after both the first as the second dose. 
Again, a similar systemic reactogenicity was observed in trials 2019nCoV-101 and 2019nCoV-301. In 
2019nCoV-301, 0.1% reported grade 4 solicited systemic adverse events after the first and second 
dose in both vaccine arms. 
Following first vaccination in 2019nCoV-301, overall concomitant analgesic medication use was low (< 
1%), and rates were balanced between the NVX-CoV2373 and placebo groups (130 [0.7%] and 57 
[0.6%], respectively). Following second vaccination, there was an increase in concomitant analgesic 
medication use in the NVX-CoV2373 group relative to the placebo group (545 [2.8%] and 63 [0.6%], 
respectively). In 2019nCoV-302, following first vaccination, overall concomitant analgesic medication 
use was low (1.4%), and rates were balanced between the NVX-CoV2373 and placebo groups (100 
[1.3%] and 112 [1.5%], respectively). Similar results were seen following second vaccination (103 
[1.4%] and 119 [1.6%], respectively).

Unsolicited adverse events 
There were higher frequencies of unsolicited AEs within the 49 days after first vaccination among NVX-
CoV2373 recipients than among placebo recipients. Unsolicited AEs were mostly mild, with severe 
TEAEs occurring in < 1% of participants.  
In 2019nCoV-301, up to Day 49, higher rates of AEs in the NVX-CoV2373 group were reported for 
the following SOCs: 
‘General disorders and administration site conditions’ (IR: 33.7 vs 16.8 per 100 PY) with differences in 
the PTs: Fatigue, Injection site pain, pain, pyrexia, chills, malaise, injection site pruritus, injection site 
erythema, Injection site swelling, influenza like illness, oedema peripheral (n=15 vs 4).  
Nervous system disorders (IR: 18.7 vs 18.1 per 100 PY) with differences in PTs Headache (n=293 vs 
130), Migraine (n=18 vs 3) 
‘Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders’ (IR: 13.8 vs 11.8 per 100 PY), with a difference in 
PTs Myalgia (n=109 vs 30), Pain in extremity (n=51 vs 17), tendonitis (n=11 vs 2) 
‘Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’ (IR: 7.9 vs 5.2), with a difference in the PTs Rash (n=61 vs 
22), Pruritus (n=25 vs 2), Urticaria (n=17 vs 5), Erythema (n=16 vs 3). 
‘Blood and lymphatic disorders’ (IR: 2.8 vs 1.6), with a difference in the PT Lymphadenopathy (n=53 
vs 13) 
‘Eye disorders’ (IR: 2.3 vs 1.0) with 62 events reported in 51 of 19,729 (0.26%) participants receiving 
active vaccine compared with 13 events in 12 of 9,853 (0.12%) placebo-treated participants. This 
explained by minor imbalances in several PTs including diplopia (notably, one SAE of diplopia was 
reported), dry eye, eye swelling, lacrimation increased, ocular discomfort, photophobia, and swelling of 
eyelid. Several of these PTs are related or can possibly be caused by inflammation of the eye although 
there was only a singular report in the PT ‘Eye inflammation’ (in the NVX-CoV2373 group). 
Reproductive system and breast disorders (IR: 2.00 vs 1.25) with 55 events reported in 52 of 19,729 
(0.26%) participants receiving active vaccine compared with 17 events in 17 of 9,853 (0.17%) 
placebo-treated participants; the imbalance is explained by PTs of dysmenorrhoea (12 vs 3) and 
menstruation irregular (5 vs 0). 
There was a higher IR of unsolicited treatment-related AEs reported from start of first vaccination 
through 28 days after second vaccination (eg, Day 49) in the NVX-CoV2373 group (50.92 e/100 PY]) 
than in the placebo group (26.34 e/100 PY). Unsolicited treatment-related AEs that had a > 1.00 
e/100 PY higher IR in the NVX-CoV2373 group than in the placebo group were injection site pain (5.64 
vs 2.35), fatigue (4.84 vs 2.72), headache (4.73 vs 3.31), pyrexia (2.76 vs 0.74), myalgia (2.76 vs 
0.96), chills (1.86 vs 0.37), and injection site pruritus (1.53 vs 0.15); these events were consistent 
with the solicited local and systemic TEAEs reported during the reactogenicity period.  
In 2019nCoV-302, differences between the treatment arms were largely due to differences in AEs of 
pain (1.2% vs 0.3%, respectively), injection site pruritus (0.7% vs <0.1%), and lethargy (1.0% vs 
0.4%). There was a higher frequency of participants with unsolicited treatment-related AEs in the NVX-
CoV2373 group (10.9%) than in the placebo group (4.6%); this difference was largely due to 
treatment-related AEs of pain (1.1% vs 0.2%, respectively), influenza-like illness (0.8% vs <0.1%), 
injection site pruritus (0.6% vs <0.1%), and lethargy (0.9% vs 0.3%). 
Considering the severe AEs in 2019nCoV-302, a numerical imbalance was seen for hypertension, with 
9 reports of hypertension (0.1%) for the NVX-CoV2373 group compared with 2 for the placebo group 
(<0.1%), in addition to reports of blood pressure increased (n=2), systolic hypertension (n=1) and 
hypertensive crisis (n=1) in the NVX-CoV2373 group vs one report of ‘blood pressure systolic 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 113/168 
 
 
 
increased’ in the placebo group (n=1). Combined 13 vs 3 severe TEAEs were reported related to 
hypertension. In the pooled analysis the incidence rates were 0.40 (n=102) in the NVX-CoV2373 arm 
compared to 0.43 (n=70) in the placebo arm for participants 18-64 years. In participants aged 65 or 
older however, the rates were 0.96 (n=46) in the NVX-CoV2373 arm compared to 0.64 (n=22) in the 
placebo group during the 3 days following vaccination. 
In 2019nCoV-501, there was a similar rate of unsolicited AEs through 49 days after first vaccination 
in both vaccine arms. The most frequent (incidence > 1.0%) TEAEs in the NVX-CoV2373 group were 
headache (3.1%) and upper respiratory tract infection (1.2%); headache (2.3%) and influenza-like 
illness (1.1%) were the most frequent in the placebo group. The most frequent (incidence > 5 
participants) treatment-related TEAEs in the NVX-CoV2373 group were headache (17 [0.8%]), myalgia 
(9 [0.4%]), lymphadenopathy (9 [0.4%]), and injection site pain (6 [0.3%]). 
Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of special interest included potential immune-mediated medical conditions (PIMMCs) as 
well as adverse events related to COVID-19. 
PIMMCs were reported in 5 (<0.1%) participants in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 8 (0.1%) 
participants in the placebo group in 2019nCoV-302. There were no PIMMCs reported for 2019nCoV-501 
and 2019nCoV-101. 
In 2019nCoV-301 there was a higher IR of PIMMCs reported from start of first vaccination to blinded 
crossover or End of Study in the NVX-CoV2373 group (0.40 e/100 PY]) than in the placebo group (0.15 
e/100 PY). An overview of PIMMCs reported in 2019nCoV-301 is presented in Table 37.Table 30 Apart 
from uveitis (n=3 reports) and Basedow’s disease/hyperthyroidism (n=3), there was only a single 
report for the PTs listed with no clear patterns emerging aside from the overall imbalance.

Blinded Crossover or End of Study by Age Strata (Safety Analysis Set)  
Given findings in the interim data outputs, which suggested that investigators (and perhaps 
participants) thought they could surmise the treatment assignment, a broader analysis with respect to 
PIMMCs was undertaken. A standard MedDRA query (SMQ) based on the protocol-defined PIMMC 
MedDRA preferred terms was applied to the data. This evaluation demonstrated no imbalance of 
PIMMCs between study groups. An overview of PIMMCs based on protocol-defined MedDRA preferred 
terms or site entered criteria on case report forms is provided in the table above. There were no SOCs 
that had a ≥ 0.05 e/100 PY higher IR in the NVX-CoV2373 group than in the placebo group. 
In 2019nCoV-302 similar frequencies of participants reported protocol-defined AESIs relevant to 
COVID-19 between the NVX-CoV2373 and placebo groups, with AESIs reported in 8 (0.1%) 
participants in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 23 (0.3%) participants in the placebo group. Anosmia and 
ageusia were the most frequently reported AESIs relevant to COVID-19, reported by 0.1% in the NVX-
COV2373 group. In 2019nCoV-301, there was a numerically higher IR of AESIs relevant to COVID-19 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021

reported from start of first vaccination to blinded crossover or EoS in the placebo group (0.27 e/100 
PY]) than in the NVX-CoV2373 group (0.11 e/100 PY). IN 2019nCoV-501, there were few reports of 
AESIs related to COVID-19 through 49 days after first vaccination: 11 (0.5%) participants in the NVX-
CoV2373 group and 14 (0.6%) participants in the placebo group. AESIs related to COVID-19 in the 
NVX-CoV2373 group were anosmia, cough, oropharyngeal pain, and pyrexia (3 [0.1%] each). 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
Three (<0.1%) participants died during study 2019nCoV-302, 2 in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 1 in 
the placebo group. In 2019nCoV-301, a total of 14 participants died during the study, with 9 (0.05%) 
in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 5 (0.05%) in the placebo group. Four deaths occurred in 2019nCoV-
501, with 2 deaths (unknown cause and COVID-19) in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 2 deaths (both 
COVID-19) in the placebo group. There were no deaths reported in 2019nCoV-101 (interim report). 
All deaths were assessed as not related to trial vaccine. An overview of deaths occurring within clinical 
trials is provided in Table 31

In 2019nCoV-301 169 (0.86%) participants in the NVX-CoV2373 group reported 228 SAEs (IR: 
4.32/100PY). There were 128 SAE reported in the placebo group (IR: 4.89/100PY).  
Two SAEs (angioedema and central nervous system inflammation) in the NVX-CoV2373 group were 
assessed by both the investigator and sponsor as being related to study vaccine. Three additional SAEs 
(Basedow’s disease, hyperthyroidism, and thrombocytopenia) in the NVX-CoV2373 group were 
assessed by the investigator as related to study vaccine but were assessed by the sponsor as not 
related to study vaccine. Also refer to AESIs. 
Other SAEs of interest in 2019nCoV-301 due to imbalances between the treatment arms or 
observations in other trials are:  
- 
- 
- 
There were 11 events of (acute) cholecystitis, bile duct stone, and cholelithiasis reported in nine 
subjects in the NVX-CoV2373 group and none in the placebo group 
There were 6 events of prostate cancer in the NVX-CoV2373 group and none in the placebo group. 
These events occurred in 5 subjects 
There were 7 events of cerebrovascular accident in the NVX-CoV2373 group and one in the placebo 
group. These events occurred in 8 subjects, including one in the placebo group 
There were 4 events of hypertension and 2 events of hypertensive crisis reported as an SAE in the 
NVX-CoV2373 group, and none in the placebo group.

In 2019nCoV-302, 44 (0.6%) participants in the NVX-CoV2373 group reported 54 SAEs vs 44 (0.6%) 
participants in the placebo group reporting 56 SAEs. One SAE of myocarditis in a 18-29 year old study 
participant with no underlying risk factors was considered related to study vaccine by the investigator; 
TTO was 3 days post second vaccination. The event resolved. Further, there was an SAE of pulmonary 
embolism in a 50-59 year old study participant with relevant risk factors. TTO was 9 days after the 
second vaccination. The event was not considered related to vaccination by the investigator. 
In 2019nCoV-501, a total of 11 (0.5%) participants reported 11 SAEs in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 
18 (0.8%) participants reported 18 SAEs in the placebo group; none of these events in either group 
were assessed as related to trial vaccine. 
There were no SAEs reported in 2019nCoV-101 (Part 1) (D189 interim report). In study 2019nCoV-
101 (Part 2) 9 (0.7%) participants had a total of 9 SAEs, including an SAE of colitis occurring 2 days 
post second dose and assessed as not related by the Sponsor. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory findings were only reported for study 2019nCoV-101 (Part 1), where haematology 
and serum chemistry was part of the safety assessments. Haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count, 
white blood cell count, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, creatine were 
determined. FDA toxicity grading was applied.  
Haematology: A total of 6 participants (4.6%) had post-baseline Grade ≥ 2 hematologic laboratory 
abnormalities: 1 in Group A [placebo/placebo], 1 in Group B [25/0 μg × 2], 2 in Group C [5/50 μg × 
2], and 2 in Group E [25/50 μg, Dose 1; placebo, Dose 2]. This included 5 participants (3.8%) with 
Grade 3 toxicity (1 in Group B; 2 in Group C; and 2 in Group E). All Grade ≥ 2 hematologic laboratory 
abnormalities comprised decreased haemoglobin, defined as > 20 g/L decreases from baseline. These 
events were predominantly transient in nature. Median haemoglobin values decreased from baseline 
across the active vaccine and placebo groups following first vaccination at Day 7 and at Day 21 and 
following second vaccination at Day 28. 
Serum chemistry: A total of 2 participants (1.5%) had abnormal serum chemistry laboratory values 
reported as TEAEs (liver function test increased in Group C and transaminases increased in Group D). 
Both events were mild in severity and assessed as related to active vaccine. 
A total of 10 participants (7.6%) had post-baseline Grade ≥ 2 serum chemistry abnormalities (1 in 
Group A [placebo/placebo], 1 in Group B [25/0 μg × 2], 2 in Group C, 5 in Group D, and 1 in Group E 
[25/50 μg, Dose 1; placebo, Dose 2]), which included 2 participants (1.5%) with Grade 3 toxicity (1 
each in Groups C and E); no participant had a Grade 4 serum chemistry abnormality. 
Throughout the clinical trials, there were similar rates of laboratory investigation TEAEs for NVX-
CoV2373 compared with placebo. TEAEs in most PTs were infrequent, with less than two events for 
most PTs in either the NVX-CoV2373 or placebo groups; there were no clear imbalances between the 
NVX-CoV2373 group and placebo. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
By sex 
CHMP assessment report

In the pivotal trial 2019nCoV-302, 51.6% of participants were male and 48.4% were female. In the 
pivotal trial 2019nCoV-301, 52.2% of participants were male, and 47.8% were female. In study 
2019nCoV-501, 57.2% of participants were male and 42.3% were female.  
Subgroup analyses by sex were performed for solicited TEAEs in Clinical Study 2019nCoV-301 and 
2019nCoV-302. Male participants reported lower frequencies of solicited AEs among both NVX-
CoV2373 and placebo recipients after each vaccination than in female participants. The difference 
between the rates in the NVX-CoV2373 and placebo groups for both males and females are very 
similar after dose 1 and dose 2 considering both local as well as systemic reactions. Solicited reactions 
by sex as observed in 2019nCoV-301 are presented in Table 33 (local) and Table 34 (systemic). 
Table 33 . Subgroup Analysis of Solicited Local Adverse Events within 7 Days after Dose 1 
and Dose 2 by Sex (Safety Analysis Set, 2019nCoV-301) 
Table 34.Subgroup Analysis of Solicited Systemic Adverse Events within 7 Days after Dose 1 
and Dose 2 by Sex (Safety Analysis Set, 2019nCoV-301) 
With regards to unsolicited AEs, including severe AEs, SAEs, MAAEs, and AESIs, there are no clear 
indications of a differential safety profile with relatively small, non-significant, differences in several 
SOCs detected but no consistent pattern emerging. Of note, where there are clearly higher rates of 
certain AEs in males vs females or vice versa this is mostly true for both the NVX-CoV2373 group as 
well as the placebo group.

By underlying comorbidites 
In 2019nCoV-301, participants with co-morbidities of obesity, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular 
disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2 reported lower frequencies and intensities of solicited local and 
systemic AEs after each vaccination among NVX-CoV2373 recipients than the overall study population 
who received NVX-CoV2373 and participants with chronic lung disease. The frequencies and intensities 
in participants with chronic lung disease were similar as the overall study population.  
By Age 
Participants in the older age cohort (≥ 65 years of age) reported lower frequencies and intensities of 
solicited local and systemic AEs among NVX-CoV2373 recipients after each vaccination than in 
participants in the younger age cohort (18 to ≤ 64 years of age). An overview of adverse events 
reported in 2019nCoV-302 stratified by age is presented in Table 35. A similar pattern was observed in 
study 2019nCoV-301.

By serostatus at baseline 
In study 2019nCoV-501, negative baseline serostatus and positive baseline serostatus for SARS-CoV-2 
were established, respectively, for 65.9% and 34.1% of participants. As can be seen in Table 45 rates 
of solicited and unsolicited adverse events were similar in subjects seropositive or seronegative at 
baseline. Similarly, in 2019nCoV-302 – where only 4.2% of participants was seropositive at baseline - 
there was no suggestion of an increase in reactions or TEAEs in seropositive persons vs seronegative 
persons.

In pregnancy and during breastfeeding 
There is limited experience with NVX-CoV2373 in pregnancy. A total of 137 pregnancies were reported 
in the clinical development program as of 26 October 2021. Of these participants, 95 received NVX-
CoV2373 and 42 received placebo. Of the 95 pregnancies reported in participants in the NVX-CoV2373 
group, 8 resulted in live births, 11 underwent voluntary termination, 16 resulted in spontaneous 
abortion, and 60 were either ongoing (55) or the outcome of the pregnancy was unknown (5). There 
were no foetal deaths or stillbirths reported in the clinical development program. There are no data 
available on the safety of NVX-CoV2373 administered during breastfeeding. 
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
In order to evaluate the occurrence of potential hypersensitivity reactions following administration of 
the vaccine, the SMQ of Hypersensitivity (Narrow) was run across the pooled studies included in the 
Integrated Safety Summary (Studies 2019nCoV-101 Part 1, 2019nCoV-101 Part 2, 2019nCoV-301, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021

2019nCoV-302, and 2019nCoV-501). Events occurring within the 3 days of vaccination were captured. 
Across the studies, 113 (0.38%) vaccine recipients compared to 42 (0.21%) placebo recipients 
reported AEs under the Hypersensitivity SMQ Narrow within the 3 days of vaccination, with a Risk 
Difference (RD) of 0.20 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.30).  
For the SOC Immune System Disorders, the frequency was higher for vaccine recipients (0.04%) than 
for placebo recipients (0.00%) with 8 (0.03%) recipients reporting of allergy to vaccine and 3 (< 
0.01%) recipients reporting hypersensitivity. None of the three hypersensitivity events are considered 
related to NVX-CoV2373. None of the three hypersensitivity events are considered related to NVX-
CoV2373. Upon review of the narratives of the 8 reports of ‘allergy to the vaccine’, it was found that 
these were mostly reactogenicity related events rather than clear hypersensitivity reactions to the 
vaccine. There was one case which may concern true hypersensitivity, namely an erythematous patch 
on the hand and itchiness as mild in intensity with onset 10 minutes after vaccination, which was 
resolved within 3 hours. No events of anaphylaxis have been reported. 
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Local and systemic reactions were higher in participants included in the Seasonal Influenza Substudy, 
who received concomitant influenza vaccine, than in participants who did not receive concomitant 
influenza vaccine.  
• 
• 
Following first dose, where concomitant influenza vaccination did occur, there was a higher 
frequency of solicited local AEs in the NVX-CoV2373 group who received concomitant influenza 
vaccine (70.1%) than in those who received only NVX-CoV2373 (57.6%). Systemic reactions were 
reported by 60.1% in the Seasonal Influenza Substudy, compared to 45.7% in those who did not 
receive concomitant influenza vaccine. 
Following second vaccination (where concomitant influenza vaccination did not occur), the 
frequency of solicited local AEs in participants in the Seasonal Influenza Substudy was 85.0%, 
compared to 79.6% in subjects not included in the Seasonal Influenza Substudy. Systemic 
reactions were reported by 69.7% compared to 64.0% respectively. 
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
2019nCoV-301 
Study discontinuations due to adverse events were reported by a total of 24 subjects (0.1%), 17 
(0.1%, 65 events) in the NVX-CoV2373 arm and 7 (0.1%, 14 events) in the placebo arm. IRs of 
unsolicited TEAEs resulting in study discontinuation reported from start of first vaccination to blinded 
crossover or EoS with > 0.05 e/100 PY in the NVX-CoV2373 group was fatigue (0.06 vs 0). Adverse 
events resulting in vaccine discontinuation were reported by 57 (0.3%) subjects in the NVX-CoV2373 
arm and 16 (0.2%) subjects in the placebo arm.  
2019nCoV-302 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were recorded for 27 (0.4%) of subjects in the NVX-CoV2373 
group and 17 (0.2%) subjects in the placebo group. Treatment-related TEAEs leading to study 
discontinuation were reported in 14 (0.2%) subjects in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 3 (<0.1%) in the 
placebo group. The most frequent (incidence > 1 participant) treatment-related TEAEs leading to study 
discontinuation in the NVX-CoV2373 group were injection site pain (4 participants) and myalgia (2). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 127/168 
 
 
 
There were similar frequencies of participants reporting unsolicited TEAEs leading to discontinuation of 
study vaccine between the 2 study vaccine groups, with 30 (0.4%) participants in the NVX-CoV2373 
group and 23 (0.3%) participants in the placebo group.  
2019nCoV-501 
Unsolicited TEAEs resulting in vaccine discontinuation were reported in 0 of 2,211 participants in the 
NVX-CoV2373 group versus 1 (< 0.1%) of 2,197 participants in the placebo group; 4 (0.2%) of 2,211 
participants in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 4 (0.2%) of 2,197 participants in the placebo group 
reported TEAEs resulting in study discontinuation. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Methods 
Safety data was collected in 4 studies conducted in Australia, the US, South Africa, the UK and Mexico. 
A pooled analysis of safety data from these studies has been presented, including data from the first 
vaccination up to the data cut-off, blinded cross over or study unblinding.  
Methods for the collection and reporting of safety data appear largely appropriate.  
There is an apparent different pattern in reactions as observed in study 2019nCoV-501 compared to 
studies -301 and -302. In 2019nCoV-501 lower rates of local and systemic reactions were reported, 
and the rates were reduced following the second dose compared to the first. Further, reactions were 
less often severe as compared to the other clinical trials. As the reason for the discrepancy between 
the studies in reporting is not clear, the rates of reactions as presented in the SmPC has been based 
on 2019nCoV-301 and 2019nCoV-302 and does not consider the data of study 2019nCoV-501. It is 
however anyhow considered that pivotal studies -302 and -301 are sufficiently large and of adequate 
methodology to characterise the reactogenicity profile. Of note, the reactogenicity subset in study -302 
included participants who received concomitant influenza vaccine. This is considered acceptable as it is 
a conservative approach: participants who received concomitant influenza vaccine reported more 
reactions (approximately 10-15% higher rates of local reactions). 
Solicited AEs were collected for 7 days post dose 1 and post dose 2. Unsolicited AEs were collected up 
to 28 days after the second dose, with the exception of SAEs, MAAEs and AESIs which were collected 
during the entire study period, which was considered appropriate. 
Exposure 
At the time of the analysis, a total of 49,950 participants age 18 years and older received at least one 
dose of NVX-CoV2373 (n=30,058) or placebo (n=19,892). Over 96% of participants have received two 
doses. Median exposure from the second dose was 90 days in study 2019nCoV-302 and 76/77 days in 
the NVX-CoV2373 and placebo group respectively in study 2019nCoV-301, with 66% of participants 
completing at least 2 months follow-up. The median duration of follow-up in the pooled safety 
database was 70 days post-Dose 2. The shorter median duration of follow-up in the pooled data as 
compared to the individual studies is due to censoring at unblinding. 
Adverse Events 
Reactogenicity was evaluated in 1,364 participants who received a first dose and 1,348 participants 
who received a second dose of NVX-CoV2373 in study 2019nCoV-302, and 19,729 participants who 
received a first dose and 17,139 participants who received a second dose of NVX-CoV2373 in study 
2019nCoV-301. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 128/168 
 
 
 
In both studies, there were more solicited local and systemic reactions reported by participants in the 
NVX-CoV2373 group compared to placebo, with the frequency and intensity of reactions increasing 
with the second dose compared to the first.  
Pain and tenderness were the most commonly reported local reactions in both study 2019nCov-302 as 
study 2019nCov-301. Pain was reported by 34% after the first dose of NVX-CoV2373 and 59% after 
the second dose. Tenderness was reported by 53% post dose 1 and 74% post dose 2. In the placebo 
group rates were between 11% and 17% and did not increase with the second dose. Local reactions 
were mostly mild to moderate, with 1.1% of participants in the NVX-CoV2373 group reporting grade 3 
local reactions after the first dose in either study and 6.6% after the second dose. Local reactions pain 
and tenderness had a median duration of 1 to 2 days after the first dose and 2 to 3 days after the 
second dose. 
Headache, fatigue, and muscle pain were the most frequent solicited systemic AEs, reported by 25%, 
25%, and 23% post dose 1 compared to 23%, 22%, and 13% in the placebo group respectively, and 
by 44%, 49%, and 48% post dose 2 compared to 19%, 21%, and 12% in the placebo group. The 
median duration of headache, fatigue and muscle pain was 1 day after each dose in both studies. For 
GI reactions (nausea/ vomiting), after the first dose rates are comparable between the NVX-CoV2373 
group and the placebo group, however with the second dose reported nausea/vomiting doubled in the 
vaccine group.  
Fever was reported infrequently, but again increased substantially with the second dose in the NVX-
CoV2373 group (in study -302 from 2.3% to 5.1%, in -301 from 0.4 to 5.7%). 
Overall, concomitant analgesic medication use was low, varying from < 1% to 3% depending on study 
and dose. 
Systemic reactions were mostly mild with 1.3%-2.3% reporting grade 3 systemic reactions after the 
first dose, and 6.8%-12.0% reporting grade 3 systemic reactions following the second dose. Grade 4 
reactions were reported by 0.1% in study 2019nCov-301.  
Unsolicited AEs 
There were higher frequencies of unsolicited TEAEs within the 49 days after first vaccination (28 days 
after the second dose) among NVX-CoV2373 recipients than among placebo recipients overall (23.8% 
vs 18.7% in study -302 and 16.3% vs 14.8% in -301). The imbalance between the NVX-CoV2373 
group and the placebo group in study 2019nCoV-302 was mainly driven by the SOC of general 
disorders and administration site conditions (n=438, 5.8%, vs n=191, 2.5%). Also, there were more 
cases of lethargy (SoC: Nervous system disorders) reported in the NVX-CoV2373 group (n=77 (1.0%) 
vs n=29 (0.4%)). A similar picture is observed in study 2019nCoV-301 and 2019nCoV-501. 
In the clinical trials there is a signal of increased risk of hypertension following NVX-CoV2373 as 
compared to the placebo group. There was an imbalance in severe cases of hypertension in trial 
2019nCoV-302 where 13 vs 3 severe TEAEs were reported related to hypertension as well as four 
events of hypertension and hypertensive crisis reported as an SAE in the NVX-CoV2373 group, 
compared to 1 in the placebo group. No further information is available on the severity of reported 
events nor on the duration. There was no standardised assessment of hypertension in the trials, and 
there is limited information on the episodes of hypertension or worsening of hypertension reported. 
Further, it is unclear if an AE of hypertension was accompanied by measurement of the blood pressure 
(BP) at multiple timepoints or reflects an increase at a single timepoint. Therefore, it is not possible to 
determine the potential impact of the observed increased risk for vaccinees and whether there is any 
cause for concern. With regards to a mechanism, hypertension could be related to anxiety surrounding 
the vaccination (in which case similar rates would be expected in the placebo group) or possibly related 
to an inflammatory reaction to the vaccine. Despite these limitations it is deemed relevant to inform 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 129/168 
 
 
 
prescribers of the increased risk as observed in the clinical trials and based on the higher incidence in 
the NVX-CoV2373 vaccinated participants, which was included in the table of ADRs in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. Further, more information should be actively collected by the participant to further characterise 
the risk of hypertension following vaccination either through monitoring of BP in older adults still to be 
vaccinated in ongoing trials or through prospective observational studies in persons at risk of 
hypertension, where close and consistent monitoring of blood pressure can take place. 
There were no relevant imbalances or signals with regards to Adverse Events of Special Interest in 
studies -2019nCov-302, 2019nCov-501, and 2019nCov-101, however in study 2019nCov-301 there 
was an increase in the incidence of PIMMCs reported in the NVX-CoV2373 group. The type of events 
reported are diverse, with no clear patterns emerging aside from the overall imbalance. Whilst 
exploring this signal, the applicant conducted a MedDRA SMQ which identified additional events in both 
treatment groups not reported by investigators. This analysis did not suggest an imbalance. In 
addition, the applicant provided a review of PIMMMCs in different SOCs based on the entire clinical 
safety database. In the SOCs of Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders, Eye Disorders and Endocrine 
Disorders there is a risk difference suggesting increased risk in the NVX-CoV2373 group however 
differences are small, there is no clear association with a single PT, and therefore these imbalances 
may be due to chance. Where background rates are available, the observed cases do not seem to be 
higher although no adequate analysis comparing rates following vaccination with expected background 
rates was submitted. 
The clinical trial data from 2019nCoV-301 provide a suggestion of a higher risk of AEs related to 
inflammation of the eye following vaccination with NVX-CoV2373. This increased risk is not detected in 
other trials and is based on small numbers; therefore, it is not clear whether it is indeed related to 
NVX-CoV2373. It is considered that the reporting of AEs related to eye inflammation, including but not 
limited to uveitis, iridocyclitis, iritis, lacrimation increased, eye(lid) swelling, diplopia, photophobia, 
should be closely followed in the Monthly Safety Summary Reports/PSURs. 
In 2019nCoV-301 also show an increased reporting of AEs in the SOC of Reproductive and breast 
disorders, which is explained by imbalances in PTs of dysmenorrhoea (12 vs 3) and menstruation 
irregular (5 vs 0). As there were no adverse events reported in relation to these PTs in study -302, and 
as there is no clear pattern in time to onset and factors in the medical history that may have 
contributed, it is not clear based on the available evidence whether NVX-CoV2373 may be related to 
these events. Therefore, it is recommended that menstrual disorders are followed in the 
MSSRs/PSURs. 
Deaths and other serious adverse events  
There were 3 deaths in study 2019nCoV-302, 13 deaths in -301, and 4 deaths in -501. None were 
considered related to study vaccine. Whilst it is agreed that none of the deaths are related to study 
vaccine, there were two deaths due to COVID-19 pneumonia in the vaccine group. Onset of symptoms 
was 8 days and 19 days after the first dose.  
There were no imbalances in SAEs between the vaccine groups in study 2019nCoV-302 or 2019nCoV-
501. In study 2019nCoV-301, there are imbalances between the treatment groups in the reporting of 
SAEs. There were numerically more SAEs in the SOC of Hepatobiliary Disorders, mainly driven by 
events related to cholecystitis (9 vs 0). Further, there were more events of prostate cancer (5 vs 0), 
cerebrovascular accident (7 vs 1) and hypertension/hypertensive crisis (6 vs 0) in the NVX-CoV2373 
treatment group. Differences remain when incidence rates were compared therefore the longer 
duration of follow up time due to higher levels of unblinding in the placebo group do not fully explain 
the imbalances.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 130/168 
 
 
 
The mechanism behind vaccine induced cholecystitis occurring within a relatively short timeframe after 
vaccination is unclear although may be attributable to the activation of the inflammatory system. All 
cases of cholecystitis were in participants with underlying risk factors (e.g. female, gallstones, obese). 
There was no consistent pattern in time to onset in the reported cases, varying from 6 to 64 days after 
the last dose. Further, the data presented by the applicant suggest a relatively high background rate 
although the number of cases expected within the clinical trials is unclear. As there is a numerical 
imbalance between the vaccine and placebo group, and as all cases are considered serious, although 
there is currently insufficient evidence to conclude that cholecystitis is possibly related to NVX-
CoV2373 the recommendation is to follow cholecystitis in the MSSRs/PSURs. 
Considering the short latency between the diagnoses of prostate cancer, the presence of underlying 
risk factors, the absence of biological plausibility and the number of cases observed being within the 
expected cases based on background rates, ‘prostate cancer’ is unlikely related to NVX-CoV2373. 
The events of ‘cerebrovascular accident’ occurred in participants with pre-existing medical conditions 
were known risk factors for stroke, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tobacco abuse, 
hyperlipidaemia, atrial fibrillation, recent myocardial infarction, and obesity. There was no clear pattern 
in the time between last vaccine dose and onset of symptoms. Despite the absence of any clear 
indication that the observed cases were related to the vaccine and any clear indication of an increased 
risk of CVA and/or related conditions with NVX-CoV2373, due to the imbalance between the two 
groups in 2019nCoV-301 it is recommended that CVA and related conditions are monitored in the 
MSSRs/PSURs.  
In study -302, an SAE in the NVX-CoV2373 group of myocarditis was considered related to study 
vaccine by the investigator, in a 18-29 yoa study participant with no relevant risk factors. Important to 
note that a viral aetiology cannot be excluded based on the available information. A further four cases 
were identified during the vaccination cross over period, including two cases of pericarditis. For two 
cases – an event of myocarditis and an event of myocarditis/pericarditis - considering the TTO, a 
relation is possible although here potential confounders are present which could provide an alternative 
explanation (strep throat, viral syndrome and the latter preceding lower respiratory tract infection with 
elevated WBC and CRP). It will be important to carefully monitor and assess the risk of 
myocarditis/pericarditis following vaccination and it should be included as an important potential risk in 
the Safety Specifications of the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Laboratory values 
Clinical laboratory findings were only reported for study 2019nCoV-101 (Part 1), where haematology 
and serum chemistry was part of the safety assessments. According to the protocols of studies 
2019nCOV-101 (Part 2), -302 and -501 it appears that the effects of vaccination on clinical laboratory 
values (i.e. haematology, serum chemistry) has not been evaluated within these studies.  
There were similar rates of laboratory investigation TEAEs for NVX-CoV2373 compared with placebo. 
TEAEs in most PTs were infrequent, with less than two events for most PTs in either the NVX-CoV2373 
or placebo groups; there were no clear imbalances between the NVX-CoV2373 group and placebo. 
Safety in special populations 
Overall, 47.4% (n=14232) of NVX-CoV2373 recipients in the clinical trials were female and 52.7% 
(n=15826) were male. Therefore, both sexes are sufficiently represented. There were no relevant 
differences in the safety profile of NVX-CoV2373 in female and male participants. Whilst higher rates of 
solicited adverse events were reported by females compared to males, with females reporting 
approximately 5-10% more solicited reactions after dose 1 and dose 2, this is observed in the NVX-
CoV2373 group as well as the placebo group which may indicate that the increased reporting in 
females is not vaccine related.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 131/168 
 
 
 
Available data does not suggest that baseline serostatus impacts the reactogenicity (frequency of 
solicited AEs) or safety of NVX-CoV2373 with very similar rates of treatment emergent solicited and 
unsolicited AEs reported in both participants seropositive as well as seronegative at baseline.  
There is no clear pattern of a differential safety profile of NVX-CoV2373 by HIV status. Although there 
is a suggestion of less reactions in HIV-positive participants, this may also be due to age which is 
known to affect reactogenicity. HIV-negative participants had a median age of 27 years, compared to 
38 years in HIV-positive participants. Medically attended AEs were reported more often in HIV positive 
participants (2.9%) compared to HIV-negative participants (0.9%), at a similar frequency in the 
placebo as the NVX-CoV2373 group. 
Participants with co-morbidities of obesity, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and 
diabetes mellitus type 2 reported lower frequencies and intensities of solicited local and systemic AEs 
after each vaccination among NVX-CoV2373 recipients compared to the overall study population as 
well as participants with chronic lung disease. 
Considering older adults participating in the trials, reactogenicity was markedly lower in those aged 65-
84 years of age compared to those 18-64 years of age. Frequencies of unsolicited AEs were similar in 
older adults compared to those aged 18-64 years of age, with no difference in related adverse events 
or serious adverse events. There is a potentially higher rate of medically attended AEs in older adults, 
however this is consistent between the two treatment groups and may be reflective of different health 
care seeking behaviour in this demographic rather than a different safety profile of NVX-CoV2373. 
There is limited clinical data in pregnant women, with 95 pregnancies reported in the clinical trials of 
which the majority (60) were still ongoing at the time of reporting. There were no stillbirths or foetal 
deaths. There are no data available on the safety of NVX-CoV2373 administered during breastfeeding. 
Preclinical data show no effect of NVX-CoV2373 on the reproductive or developmental parameters. 
Therefore, no safety issues of use during pregnancy are foreseen. Furthermore, there is no reason to 
assume that constituents of NVX-CoV2373 will be excreted in breast milk. It is to be expected that 
anti-SARS-COV2 antibodies elicited by NVX-CoV2373 will be excreted in the colostrum, which may 
contribute to the protection of the newborn child. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Concomitant administration with influenza vaccine increased reporting of solicited AEs relative to when 
NVX-CoV2373 was administered without influenza vaccine. This is reflected in the SmPC. 
Immunological events 
No events of anaphylaxis have been reported though this likely reflects the rarity of this event in 
relationship to the size of the pre-authorisation safety database for the vaccine.  
Discontinuation due to AES 
In general, there were few discontinuations (vaccination/study) due to treatment emergent adverse 
events. Whilst none of the studies showed an imbalance in the study discontinuations due to AEs per 
study group, in -301 more events were reported by those that discontinued the study due to AEs in the 
NVX-CoV2373 group. Further, in both pivotal studies a slightly higher proportion of participants 
discontinued the vaccination with the imbalance mostly due to reactions to the vaccine (i.e. headache, 
injection-site pain, myalgia). 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of Nuvaxovid is adequately characterised and appears to be acceptable.

2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
2.7.1.  Safety concerns 
The applicant has submitted an RMP including the following summary of safety concerns:  
Summary of safety concerns 
Important identified risks 
None 
Important potential risks 
•  Anaphylaxis 
•  Vaccine-associated  enhanced  disease  (VAED),  including  vaccine-
associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) 
•  Myocarditis and pericarditis  
Missing information 
•  Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding 
•  Use in immunocompromised patients 
•  Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders 
•  Use  in  frail  patients  with  comorbidities  (e.g.  chronic  obstructive 
pulmonary  disease  [COPD],  diabetes,  chronic  neurological  disease, 
cardiovascular disorders) 
•  Interaction with other vaccines 
•  Long-term safety 
Risks considered important for the inclusion in the summary of safety concerns 
Important potential risk 
Anaphylaxis, although very rare, it can be life-threatening or fatal, requiring immediate medical 
attention. The risk of anaphylaxis after all vaccines is estimated to be 1.31 per million vaccine doses. 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported with other COVID-19 vaccines. Appropriate medical 
treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction 
following the administration of the vaccine. 
There were no reports of anaphylaxis in the NVX-CoV2373 clinical development programme. One event 
of angioedema was reported and was considered as related to the vaccine. Anaphylaxis can manifest 
clinically with dyspnea, hypotension, swelling (sometimes leading to airway compromise), and rash, 
and may be life threatening. 
Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease 
(VAERD):  Vaccine-associated  enhanced  disease  (including  VAERD)  may  present  as  severe  disease  or 
modified/unusual clinical manifestations of a known disease presentation and may involve one or multiple 
organ  systems.  Subjects  with  VAED/VAERD  may  experience  rapid  clinical  deterioration  and  will  likely 
require non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation; and patients diagnosed with acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) have poorer prognosis and potentially higher mortality rate. No cases have 
been reported at the moment in the current NVX-CoV2373 clinical development. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis: Myocarditis and pericarditis are events which may be serious or non-
serious and are generally mild but may be potentially life
threatening. Balanced with the risk of death 
and illness (including myocarditis) seen with COVID-19 itself, the impact on the benefit-risk balance of 
the vaccine is considered minimal. Two cases of myocarditis were reported following exposure to NVX-
CoV2373 and one case was reported following exposure to placebo. In the post-crossover phase of the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 133/168 
‑
 
 
 
 
studies 301 and 302, three cases of myocarditis were reported. In one case, myocarditis was reported 
with temporal association to NVX-CoV2373. In the absence of alternative aetiologies, a causal 
association with the vaccine cannot be excluded in this case. For the other cases, alternative 
explanations that could explain the event have been reported. Considering that myocarditis and 
pericarditis has been observed following other COVID-19 vaccines, it is considered that there is a 
scientific basis for suspicion of a causal relation, although this is not confirmed. It should be listed as 
important potential risk.  
Missing information  
Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding: Pregnant and breastfeeding women are typically excluded 
from initial clinical trials. There is limited experience with use of NVX-CoV2373 in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, 
embryo/foetal development, parturition, or post-natal development. Administration of Nuvaxovid in 
pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the 
mother and foetus. It is unknown whether Nuvaxovid is excreted in human milk. No effects on the 
breast-fed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast-feeding woman to 
Nuvaxovid is negligible. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to 
reproductive toxicity. 
Use in immunocompromised patients: Immunocompromised individuals are at greater risk of morbidity 
and mortality from vaccine-preventable disease. In addition, vaccines may be less effective in severely 
immunocompromised patients, as the vaccinees weakened immune system may not mount a sufficient 
response. Although there is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving NVX-
CoV2373 will be different to that of the general population, the possibility cannot be excluded. 
Use in frail patients with comorbidities (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, 
chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders): Frail (unstable) patients with comorbidities are 
at risk of developing a more severe manifestation of COVID-19. Although there is no evidence that the 
safety profile of this population receiving NVX-CoV2373 will be different to that of the general 
population, the possibility cannot be excluded.  
Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders: There is limited information on the safety 
of the vaccine in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. There is no evidence from NVX-
CoV2373 clinical studies to date that the safety profile of this population differs with that of the general 
population. However, given the paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded. 
Interaction with other vaccines: The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 when co-
administered with another vaccine (i.e., with seasonal illness vaccines [such as the influenza vaccines]) 
was evaluated in approximately 400 persons in the UK Phase 3 study. The binding antibody response 
to SARS CoV-2 was lower when NVX-CoV2373 was given concomitantly with inactivated influenza 
vaccine. The clinical significance of this is unknown. 
Long-term safety: Given the nature of the NVX-CoV2373 clinical development programme, 
understanding of the long-term safety profile of NVX-CoV2373 is currently limited.

Risks not considered important for inclusion in the summary of safety concerns 
The reactogenicity is in line with what can be expected from a vaccine, and it is considered acceptable 
to not include those events in the list of safety specifications. 
Vaccination errors may relate to administration, vaccination scheme, storage conditions, or errors 
associated with multidose vials. Furthermore, there is potential for confusion or interchangeability with 
other COVID-19 vaccines. These potential vaccination errors are mitigated through a number of routine 
risk minimisation measures, including product information, vaccination reminder cards and medical 
information contacts.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest: The List of AESI is drawn from efforts by regulatory authorities, 
internationally recognised collaborations, and the scientific literature to identify AESI for vaccinations, 
and COVID-19 vaccinations specifically. NVX-CoV2373 list of AESIs is provided in the RMP.  
Conclusions on the safety specification  
It is agreed that the list of safety concerns in the RMP are appropriate. 
2.7.2.  Pharmacovigilance plan

Monthly Summary Safety Reports (MSSRs) 
In line with EMA’s ‘Consideration on core requirements for RMPs of COVID-19 vaccines’ guidance, the 
applicant will submit monthly safety reports containing a review of safety information received during 
the reporting interval, as well as cumulative data. Topics covered by the monthly summary safety 
reports will include, at a minimum:  
• 
• 
Interval and cumulative number of reports overall and stratified by age groups, report type 
(medically confirmed vs. non-medically confirmed), seriousness, and in special populations (e.g., 
pregnant women) 
Interval and cumulative number of reports per HLT and SOC 
•  Reports per EU country 
•  Exposure data based on administered doses whenever possible, stratified by region (and within the 
EU also by country), by age groups, gender, by first vs. second dose  
•  Safety-related changes to the reference safety information and actions taken in the interval 
• 
List of ongoing and closed signals in the interval, including a summary of their evaluation; reviews 
of signals identified during the period or of safety topics identified by EMA and requested to be 
addressed in the MSSR  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 136/168 
 
 
 
•  Summaries of reported cases of all AESIs and RMP safety concerns: report numbers and relevant 
cases, including O/E analysis (when possible)  
• 
Fatal reports- numbers and relevant cases (considering co-morbidities and frailty), including O/E 
analyses (when possible), stratified by age groups. 
•  Medication errors, if a pattern of errors leading to harm is identified and/or risk minimisation 
activities are considered warranted 
•  Details of the search strategy, case definitions, and methodology for O/E analyses including source 
of background rates, risk windows, etc., as needed 
•  Benefit-risk considerations 
In addition, based on the impurity levels, the applicant should monitor the reactogenicity profile for the 
secondary dose and for future potential booster injections via routine pharmacovigilance, including the 
provision of updates as part of the MSSR. 
Following the safety clinical assessment of the conditional marketing authorisation, the following 
events are to be reviewed via routine pharmacovigilance in the MSSR/PSUR: menstrual disorders, 
cholecystitis, cerebrovascular accidents and related conditions and adverse events related to eye 
inflammation, including but not limited to uveitis, iridocyclitis, iritis, lacrimation increased, eye(lid) 
swelling, diplopia, photophobia. 
Traceability  
To facilitate the traceability of the use of this vaccine, the SmPC includes instructions for HCPs to 
record the name and batch number of the administered vaccine for each recipient.  
Traceability is available for every shipping container of COVID-19 vaccine, which are outfitted with a 
unique device that provides real-time monitoring of geographic location and records temperature 24 
hours per day, 7 days per week while in transit. Each device will also trace the batch/lot of the 
associated shipment. The device is activated prior to shipment and information is transmitted 
wirelessly to Novavax at a predefined cadence, until delivery to the customer. A shipment quality 
report that indicates if the product is acceptable for immediate use is generated by Novavax and 
transmitted to the vaccinator’s practice site upon pressing of the stop button on the data logger, or 
arrival notification from the carrier in combination with the data logger’s location and/or light signal. 
Additionally, alarms and escalation/notification for excursions (per pre-defined specifications) are 
programmed into the device. 
The carton, which is the lowest saleable unit of the product, is assigned a unique serial number that is 
linked to information about the product’s origin, batch number and expiration date. Each carton 
contains the product global trade identification number (GTIN), serial number, lot/batch number, and 
expiry date printed as human readable information and a scannable GS1 2D DataMatrix code. 
Further, vaccination reminder cards will be available to member states, if requested, for use by 
member state vaccinators at the time of vaccination. The vaccination reminder cards contain the 
following elements: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Placeholder space for the vaccinee name; 
Placeholder space for the name of the vaccine (brand name) and manufacturer of the vaccine; 
Placeholder space for the batch/lot number of the vaccine; 
Placeholder space for the date the vaccine was administered; 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 137/168 
 
 
 
•  A reminder to return for the second dose of the vaccine; 
• 
Placeholder spaces for the second dose of the vaccine including the name of the 
vaccine/manufacturer of the vaccine, batch number, and date of the second dose of the vaccine; 
•  Novavax website and QR code that links to NovavaxCovidVaccine.com; and 
• 
Information on AE reporting to the member state local health authorities. 
In addition to the vaccination reminder cards, traceability labels (two labels per dose) containing 
product identifier (brand name) and batch/lot information as human readable and GTIN, batch/lot 
information and expiration date encoded in GS-1 compliant 2-D data matrix will be made available to 
support documentation of the batch/lot traceability on the vaccination reminder card and for use in the 
vaccinee’s medical records. We also acknowledge that some EU member states may require utilisation 
of nationally mandated vaccination cards or electronic systems to document batch/lot number; 
therefore, the available traceability and vaccination reminder cards and/or stickers with printed 
lot/batch information may not be utilised in all member states. 
Specific AE follow-up forms for the following safety concerns: 
Two specific adverse reaction follow up questionnaires will be used to collect follow-up information 
on reports of anaphylaxis and Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine-
associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) 
Additional pharmacovigilance activities 
The applicant proposes the following 10 studies to further evaluate safety and effectiveness, and to 
address missing information in the post-marketing setting. There are five interventional studies and 
five non-interventional studies (five safety and two on effectiveness).

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP and the PRAC considers that the risk management plan version 1 is acceptable. 
Pharmacovigilance 
2.7.5.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.6.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  New Active Substance 
The active substance is defined as the protein product of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S-gene encoding 
the 1260 (full length 1273 amino acid protein minus the signal peptide) amino acid spike protein 
(company code NVX-CoV2373). 
Information has been provided on the chemical formula, relative molecular mass, and structural 
formula/ amino acid sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 rS protein. 
Keyword and sequence searches were conducted in established databases and no relevant patent 
literature was identified that describes the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein. Details about the 
searches performed are provided, using keyword-based searches and sequence-based searches. 
The applicant has provided sufficient evidence that the quality aspects of NVX-CoV2373 are unique and 
that collectively, the information provided support the claim that the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike 
protein included as active substance in Nuvaxovid can be considered as a New Active Substance in 
itself. 
In conclusion, the active substance NVX-CoV2373, i.e. the protein product of a recombinant SARS-
CoV-2 S-gene encoding the 1260 (full length 1273 amino acid protein minus the signal peptide) amino 
acid spike protein, contained in the medicinal product Nuvaxovid can be considered a biological 
substance not previously authorised in a medicinal product in the European Union, i.e. it is considered 
a New Active Substance in itself. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable, given the current urgent 
public health need for rapid development and approval of vaccines to prevent the global burden of 
disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease, and because the product will 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 149/168 
 
 
 
always be administered by a healthcare professional. 
The applicant is expected to thoroughly review and update the package leaflet in the light of the 
results from the user testing, especially as regards the section ‘Information about storage and 
handling’. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
The following exemptions from labelling requirements have been granted on the basis of article 63.3 of 
Directive 2001/83/EC. In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the context of the 
labelling flexibilities described in the Questions and Answers on labelling flexibilities for COVID-19 
vaccines (EMA/689080/2020 rev.3) document which aims at facilitating the preparedness work of 
COVID-19 vaccine developers and the associated logistics of early printing packaging activities. 
Outer and immediate packaging in EN only: 
Outer and immediate labelling will be provided in English only for all EU Member States (MSs), as well 
as Norway and Iceland. The labelling flexibility is granted until end of June 2022. 
EN only printed package leaflet: 
If required, EN printed package leaflet (PL) will be supplied to EU MSs, including Norway and Iceland. 
Except for those countries that require it in their national language as per labelling Q&A. The applicant 
plans to provide electronic and downloadable national translations of the Package Leaflet for other 
Member States / languages via a QR code. The labelling flexibility is granted until end of June 2022. 
Omission of the Blue Box information on the outer carton: 
Due to the use of one unified EN packing across all the EU countries, the Blue Box will not be displayed 
on the outer carton. The labelling flexibility is granted until end of June 2022. 
The information, normally provided in the market specific packaging Blue Box area of the carton, will 
be provided as an electronic version on the website (via the QR code/URL). 
Exemption from the obligation of serialisation:

2.9.3.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling and the package leaflet for the purpose of providing 
information to Healthcare Professionals and vaccine recipients has been submitted by the applicant and 
has been found acceptable by all EU MSs, including Norway and Iceland. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code:  
Statutory information: 
•  Approved regulatory information, including the patient information leaflet (PIL) and Summary 
of Product Characteristics (SmPC); 
•  Vaccination Card. 
2.9.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Nuvaxovid (COVID-19 Vaccine 
(recombinant, adjuvanted)) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active 
substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU 
and it is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for Nuvaxovid is active immunisation of individuals ≥18 years of age for 
prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the 
novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The virus has spread world-wide during 2020 causing WHO to declare 
a pandemic in March 2020. The virus infects the airways and causes a broad spectrum of respiratory 
symptoms ranging from asymptomatic infection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and 
ARDS. The pandemic is still ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to control the outbreak.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
At the time of authorisation of this vaccine, five medicinal products had received marketing 
authorisation for the treatment of COVID-19. These encompass antiviral therapy (remdesivir), anti-
inflammatory therapy (dexamethasone), IL-6 inhibitor (toculizumab) as well as monoclonal antibodies 
directed against the spike protein (casirivimab / imdevimab, regdanvimab and sotrovimab). Further, 
marketing authorisation applications were submitted for anakinra, baricitinib (both anti-inflammatory 
agents), as well as the direct acting antiviral drug molnupiravir. A rolling review was ongoing for 
tixagevimab / cilgavimab. Other widely used treatments for hospitalised patients include 
anticoagulants. These therapies have shown variable efficacy depending on the severity and duration 
of illness.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 151/168 
 
 
 
While care for individuals with COVID-19 has improved with clinical experience gained over time, there 
remains an unmet need worldwide for vaccines able to prevent or mitigate COVID-19 during the 
ongoing pandemic.  
There are currently four COVID-19 vaccines authorised in the EU to prevent COVID-19. A high global 
demand for suitable vaccines to help counteract the ongoing pandemic remains. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence for efficacy for Nuvaxovid is based on two pivotal observer blinded, randomised, 
placebo controlled trials conducted in the US, Mexico (2019nCoV-301) and the United Kingdom 
(2019nCoV-302). The trials were designed to demonstrate efficacy against PCR-confirmed 
symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosed ≥ 7 days after completion of the second 
study vaccination (given 21 days after the first dose) in adult participants serologically negative (to 
SARS-CoV-2) at baseline until the endpoint-driven efficacy analysis was triggered by the occurrence of 
a prespecified number of blinded endpoints. 
In study -302, 15,187 subjects were randomised 1:1 to receive NVX-CoV2373 or placebo (saline). In 
study -301, 29,949 subjects were randomised 2:1 to NVX-CoV2373 or placebo. The primary efficacy 
analyses were conducted in 14,039 (92.4%) randomised participants in 2019nCoV-302 and 25,452 
(85.0%) randomised participants in 2019nCoV-301. The efficacy analysis was event-driven in both 
studies, with 62 cases in the interim and 106 in the final analysis for 2019nCoV-302, and 77 cases for 
the analysis in 2019nCoV-301. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The estimated VE for the single primary analysis based on 77 accrued cases in 2019nCoV-301 was 
90.4% (95% CI: 82.9, 94.6). Vaccine efficacy according to the primary efficacy endpoint was therefore 
demonstrated for both pivotal trials. The confirmatory analysis at the interim analysis based on 62 
accrued cases in 2019nCoV-302 indicated a VE point estimate of 89.3% with a multiplicity adjusted 
96.9% CI of 73.0% to 95.8%, meeting the prespecified study success criterion of an alpha-adjusted 
LBCI > 30%. VE was consistent in the final efficacy analysis after accrual of 106 cases, with an 
estimated VE of 89.7% (95%CI: 80.2, 94.6%).  
In 2019nCoV-301, 4 cases were classified as severe, all in the placebo group. With respect to 
hospitalisation, there was 1 case of COVID-19 hospitalisation in 2019nCoV-302 and 3 in 2019nCoV-
301. At the time of the final analysis in 2019nCoV-302 there were 4 cases classified as severe in the 
placebo group and none in the NVX-CoV2373 group occurring at least 7 days after the second dose in 
serologically negative adult participants in the PP-EFF analysis set.  
The efficacy was consistent with the level of protection in the general study population in older adults 
≥65 years [2019nCoV-302: estimated VE 88.9% [95% CI: 20.2; 99.7] based on 1/1953 vs 9/1957 
cases for vaccine and control groups respectively], and in participants with comorbid conditions 
[2019nCoV-302: estimated VE 90.9% [95% CI: 70.4; 97.2]; based on 3/3117 vs 33/3143 cases for 
vaccine and control groups respectively; 2019nCoV-301: estimated VE 90.8% [95% CI: 79.2; 95.9]; 
based on 7/8109 vs 34/3910 cases].  
The estimated VE of NVX-CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 due 
to a SARS-CoV-2 variant considered a VOC or VOI in baseline seronegative adult participants in 
2019nCoV-301 was 93.2% (95% CI: 84.0, 97.1). The most common VOC was B.1.1.7 (Alpha), which 
was found in 46 cases. PCR results of the final analysis by SARS-CoV-2 strain showed estimated VEs of 
NVX-CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 in baseline seronegative 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 152/168 
 
 
 
(to SARS-CoV-2) participants in 2019nCoV-302 were 86.3% (95% CI: 71.3, 93.5) for the UK (Alpha) 
variant B.1.1.7 and 96.4% (95% CI: 73.8, 99.5) for the ancestral (Wuhan) strain.  
An immune response in terms of both the humoral response against S protein (binding antibodies) and 
SARS-CoV-2 virus (neutralisation assays) and the cellular response have been shown in vaccinated 
subjects. The second dose is required to improve immunogenicity. Furthermore, safety and 
immunogenicity data from 2019nCoV-101 supported the inclusion of the adjuvant. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Data on vaccine efficacy is available for 76 days for study 2019nCoV-301 and approximately 90 days 
since dose 2 from 2019nCoV-302. Therefore, the duration of protection is unknown. Longer-term 
vaccine efficacy will be further followed post-authorisation.  
Although encouraging trends were observed, reliable efficacy estimates against severe COVID-19 and 
hospitalisation caused by COVID-19 could not be established due to the lack of a sufficient number of 
cases within the clinical studies. From the experience with other vaccines it is expected that prevention 
of severe COVID-19 will be achieved by preventing COVID-19 overall.  
Although observed point estimates of vaccine efficacy were consistent across age groups, the number 
of cases in 65 to 84 years of age were limited. 
Available data are insufficient to establish efficacy in subjects seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. 
However, efficacy is anticipated in this group to the extent that natural immunity does not fully protect 
against re-infection, which is presently not fully characterised. 
Immunocompromised patients were excluded from the trials, as well as pregnant and breast-feeding 
women. Few HIV+ subjects were enrolled in the supportive trial 2019nCoV-501. Further data in these 
subgroups should be collected post-authorisation. Data are limited in subjects with severe and/or 
uncontrolled underlying disease, and there is no data in persons with autoimmune diseases since these 
subjects were excluded from the clinical trials. 
Although efficacy was shown against the B.1.1.7 variant, strain specific efficacy results should be 
interpreted with caution given the low number of cases for individual strains and potential confounding. 
The extent of cross-neutralisation of circulating and newly emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 (including 
Delta and Omicron) remains uncertain, more data should be generated post-authorisation.  
Further support for the efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 comes from trial 2019nCoV-501 which was conducted 
in South Africa and included both HIV-negative and HIV-positive participants. During the trial, a new 
variant emerged (B.1.351, Beta variant). The overall estimated VE in this study (48.6% (95% CI: 
28.4, 63.1)) is lower than what is observed in study 2019nCoV-301 and 2019nCoV-302, also when 
looking only at the HIV-negative population. Whilst this may to some extent be explained by the 
circulating variant (Beta), immunogenicity results of the participants enrolled in this study also point to 
a reduced immune response after vaccination (measured against the Wuhan strain) compared to the 
response observed in 2019nCoV-302. Thus, it cannot be excluded that the lower VE is explained by 
more factors than the circulating virus variant alone, for example differences in baseline characteristics 
of the population enrolled, or potential batch related issues.  
To date no correlate of protection has been established. Therefore, the clinical relevance of 
immunogenicity data is difficult to interpret.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety was characterised in four clinical trials, in which 30,058 participants have been exposed to 
NVX-CoV2373 of whom 28,963 (96.4%) to two doses. The placebo group included 19,892 participants, 
with 19,270 (96.9%) receiving two doses. The median duration of follow-up in the pooled safety 
database was 70 days post-Dose 2. 
Solicited local and systemic reactions were reported at a higher incidence in the NVX-CoV2373 group 
than in the placebo group after each injection. The frequency and severity of solicited reactions 
increased with the second dose compared to the first. 
In 2019nCoV-302/2019nCoV-301, solicited local AEs were reported by 58% of NVX-CoV2373 recipients 
following the first dose and 79% following the second dose, compared to 21% and 21% of placebo 
recipients after the first and second dose respectively. Pain and tenderness were the most commonly 
reported local reactions in both pivotal studies, reported by 34% (pain) and 53% (tenderness) after 
the first dose of NVX-CoV2373. After the second dose, pain was reported by 59% and tenderness by 
74%. In the placebo group rates were between 11% and 17% and did not increase with the second 
dose. Local reactions were mostly mild to moderate, with 1.1% of participants in the NVX-CoV2373 
group reporting grade 3 local reactions after the first dose in either study and 6.6% after the second 
dose. Local reactions pain and tenderness had a median duration of 1 to 2 days after the first dose and 
2 to 3 days after the second dose. 
Headache, fatigue, and muscle pain were the most frequent solicited systemic AEs, reported by 25%, 
25%, and 23% post dose 1 compared to 23%, 22%, and 13% in the placebo group respectively, and 
by 44%, 49%, and 48% post dose 2 compared to 19%, 21%, and 12% in the placebo group. The 
median duration of headache, fatigue and muscle pain was 1 day after each dose in both studies. For 
GI reactions (nausea/ vomiting), after the first dose rates are comparable between the NVX-CoV2373 
group and the placebo group, however with the second dose reported nausea/vomiting doubled in the 
vaccine group. The median duration of headache, fatigue and muscle pain was 1 day after each dose. 
Fever increased substantially with the second dose in the NVX-CoV2373 group (from 0.5% after dose 1 
to 5.6% after dose 2). 
Systemic reactions were mostly mild with 2.3% reporting grade 3 systemic reactions after the first 
dose, and 12% reporting grade 3 systemic reactions following the second dose. Grade 4 reactions were 
reported by 0.1%.  
In the safety subsets, unsolicited AEs within the 49 days after first vaccination (28 days after the 
second dose) were reported more frequently in NVX-CoV2373 recipients than among placebo recipients 
overall (23.8% vs 18.7% in study 2019nCoV-302 and 16.3% vs 14.8% in 2019nCoV-301). This was 
driven mainly by the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions, nervous system 
disorders and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, which mostly reflect the reactogenicity 
of NVX-CoV2373. A similar imbalance was seen in treatment-related TEAEs, which again was explained 
by the reactogenicity. Severe TEAEs occurred in < 1% of participants.  
A numerical imbalance was seen in the reports of severe TEAEs related to hypertension in 2019-
nCoV302. In a pooled safety analysis, a higher incidence of hypertension following NVX-CoV2373 was 
seen in older adults, over 65 years of age. There were 4 SAEs of hypertension as well as 13 severe 
cases of hypertension in the NVX-CoV2373 vaccinated participants. Hypertension is considered an 
adverse drug reaction of NVX-CoV2373. 
There were no deaths considered related to study vaccine, with similar rates between vaccine groups. 
Overall, the incidence of SAEs was low and similar in the between the vaccine groups in study 
2019nCoV-302 and 2019nCoV-501. In study 2019nCoV-301, there were numerically more SAEs in the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 154/168 
 
 
 
SOC of Hepatobiliary Disorders, mainly driven by events related to cholecystitis (9 vs 0). Additionally, 
there were more serious adverse events of prostate cancer (5 vs 0), cerebrovascular accident (7 vs 1) 
and hypertension/hypertensive crisis (4 vs 0) in the NVX-CoV2373 treatment group. 
There were three cases of myocarditis following vaccination with NVX-CoV2373, which may be related 
to the vaccine based on the TTO. Considering the experience with other COVID-19 vaccines, 
myocarditis was included as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There is a lack of long-term safety data, with a median follow up of 3 months after the second dose in 
the pivotal trials. Long term safety up to 1 year is available for the platform (Recombinant Nanoparticle 
Vaccine Antigens with Matrix-M1 Adjuvant) with no emerging safety signal. 
No difference was observed with regard to the incidence and severity of reactogenicity in subjects who 
were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline compared with subjects who were seronegative for 
SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. 
Whilst hypertension has been identified as an uncommon adverse drug reaction for Nuvaxovid, there is 
insufficient information available to determine the clinical impact of this ADR.  
Immunosuppressed /immune-deficient individuals, with exception of HIV infected individuals on stable 
antiviral therapy, were excluded from the study. The safety database for immunocompromised 
individuals is limited to 244 subjects with medically stable HIV infection (122 in each treatment group) 
included in 2019nCoV-501. The submitted safety and reactogenicity data in this subpopulation did not 
reveal any concern. No safety data are available for immunocompromised individuals other than HIV. 
No safety data are available for individuals with autoimmune disorders and individual under immune-
suppressive treatment.  
There is limited clinical data in pregnant women, with 95 pregnancies reported in the clinical trials of 
which the majority (60) were still ongoing at the time of reporting. There were no stillbirths or foetal 
deaths. There are no data available on the safety of Nuvaxovid administered during breastfeeding.  
Persons with stable comorbidities were included in the pivotal trials. In 2019nCoV-302, almost half of 
participants (45%) had a comorbidity or BMI greater than 30. In 2019nCoV-301, the majority of 
participants were overweight or obese (70.2%), 14% had a chronic lung disease, 8% had Diabetes 
mellitus type 2, 1% had cardiovascular disease and 0.6% had chronic kidney disease. There were 
lower frequencies and intensities of solicited local and systemic AEs after each vaccination among 
Nuvaxovid recipients with co-morbidities of obesity, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, 
and diabetes mellitus type 2 than the overall population. Frailty has not been evaluated yet. Therefore, 
use in frail patients with co-morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, diabetes, 
chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) has been identified as missing information in 
the safety specifications of the RMP. 
Available non-clinical and clinical data do not raise a concern regarding vaccine-enhanced respiratory 
disease. The possibility of enhanced disease cannot be excluded with certainty and is listed as an 
important potential risk in the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Overall, vaccine efficacy of two doses of Nuvaxovid administered with an interval of 21 days has been 
demonstrated for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease with onset of at least 7 days after 
second vaccination in adults ≥18 years of age, as well as an acceptable safety profile, based on two 
large pivotal phase 3 trials included in this cMAA. 
The results are considered robust based on the study design and are further supported by the different 
secondary endpoints and analyses. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed efficacy for elderly (≥65 years), as well as 
for participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID-19, which is 
considered as the population at highest need for preventative strategies.  
Efficacy against COVID-19 was demonstrated in each participating country, including South Africa 
(where the variant of concern B.1.351 (Beta) was the predominant circulating strain during the study), 
although efficacy was of lower magnitude compared to other region/countries.

No reliable efficacy estimate can currently be established against severe COVID-19 or hospitalisation; 
however, it is likely that severe disease will be prevented as a consequence of preventing symptomatic 
COVID-19. Further follow up is expected in post-authorisation effectiveness studies to confirm this. 
A shortcoming of the current efficacy dataset is the short median follow up of approx. 90 days since 
dose 2 from 2019nCoV-302 and 76 days for 2019nCoV-301. Longer-term vaccine efficacy will be 
further followed post-authorisation.  
It would be desirable to confirm if this vaccine also has an effect on asymptomatic infection and viral 
transmission. This is evaluated as part of secondary objectives in both pivotal trials and data are 
expected post-authorisation. These aspects however may not be adequately characterised based on 
clinical trial data and will likely need to be further elucidated post-authorisation. 
The observed safety profile is considered well characterised and acceptable based on the short-term 
data available. The safety of Nuvaxovid is mainly characterised by local and systemic reactions 
occurring during the first 7 days after vaccination. Reactions were mostly mild to moderate, transient 
and self-limited. Reactions were more frequent and more severe with the second dose. The 
reactogenicity was milder and lower in older adults aged ≥65 years compared to the younger adults 
aged ≥18 to 64. SAEs and AESIs were infrequent in the NVX-CoV2373 and placebo groups. 
Long term safety has to be characterised further, and it is important to analyse the full safety follow-up 
of the ongoing trials, which is 12 months for 2019nCoV302 and 2019nCoV501, and 24 months for 
2019nCoV301 The current dataset gives no indication of vaccine-enhanced disease, a potential risk 
that will be followed up as detailed in the RMP. 
There is limited data on use in pregnant women, but a protective effect is anticipated. Preclinical data 
are reassuring; therefore, noting that pregnancy as such is a risk factor for severe COVID19, and that 
pregnant women may additionally belong to other risk groups, vaccination may be considered on a 
case by case basis. Data in pregnancy will be generated post-authorisation. There are no data in 
breast-feeding women. Based on biological plausibility, no risk in breast-feeding is anticipated. 
No participants with severe immunodeficiency were included in the studies. Such patients may not be 
protected as well as immunocompetent individuals by vaccination. However, no safety issues are 
anticipated, and the benefit-risk balance in immunocompromised subjects is deemed positive, also in 
light of the underlying excess risk of COVID-19. Further data should be collected post-authorisation. 
Also, subjects with severe underlying diseases were not included in the studies, and the safety and 
effectiveness of the vaccine in these groups will be followed up post-authorisation. 
Regarding seropositive subjects, no safety issues have been observed in this population, and efficacy 
can be anticipated. Therefore, the vaccine can be administered without performing previous SARS-
CoV-2 serology testing. 
Uncertainties concerning the pharmaceutical characterisation of the commercial product are compatible 
with a positive benefit-risk balance. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The available clinical data for Nuvaxovid, including the induction of immune responses and the 
demonstrated vaccine efficacy, establish the benefits to prevent COVID-19 in immunised individuals 18 
years of age and older. The lack of any serious safety concerns for subjects aged 18 years and above 
allows concluding on a positive benefit-risk balance in the proposed indication. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 158/168 
 
 
 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Given the current pandemic situation, the demonstrated favourable effect and considering the overall 
characteristics of the unfavourable effects, a positive benefit-risk balance in the proposed indication is 
concluded for this vaccine. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
The potency of the finished product batches used in clinical studies was not adequately linked to the 
potency of the commercially manufactured batches, raising uncertainty in comparing the potency of 
commercial finished product batches with those of clinical batches and defining clinically qualified 
potency limits based on batches used in clinical phase 3 trials. Based on the clarifications provided by 
the applicant, it can be concluded that the commercial batches are at least as potent as the least 
potent batch used in clinical studies. In addition, the lower limit for the product potency specification 
was increased, which is considered a conservative approach. However, to further support this 
conclusion, as a Specific Obligation, the applicant should bridge the relevant reference standard lots 
(i.e. calibrate reference standards BN2-0620-047 and 20_PRS_SARS-CoV-2 against each other in the 
Gen1v2 finished product assay in the presence of Matrix-M1) to firmly link the potencies of finished 
product batches used in clinical phase 3 studies to those of commercial batches. Once the reference 
standards are adequately bridged, the finished product release and shelf-life acceptance criteria of the 
potency assay should be reviewed and updated as appropriate. 
The proposed specifications, as demonstrated by the submitted data, are suitable to control product 
quality. Due to the development of this vaccine under accelerated timelines, real time stability data for 
finished product are limited. However, data from clinical batches are considered representative to 
support the shelf life of the finished product. As a Specific Obligation the applicant is requested to 
provide additional stability data on commercial batches to further support the shelf life of the product. 
The characterisation and control of the active substance and finished product are considered 
acceptable in the context of a conditional Marketing Authorisation in the current (COVID-19) pandemic 
emergency situation. Nevertheless, additional data to ensure consistent quality are considered 
important to confirm the finished product stability and to ensure appropriate links to the clinical 
material in relation to control of potency, and these data should be provided post-authorisation as 
specific obligations to the MA. 
Studies are underway and it is expected that the applicant will be able to provide the requested data 
and thereby fulfil the specific obligations. Based on the applicant’s justification and commitment, it is 
expected that data to fulfil the specific obligations will be submitted between February 2022 and end of 
January 2023. 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the prevention of a life-threatening disease. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. 
Nuvaxovid falls within the scope of the conditional marketing authorisation Article 3(1) of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004 indent 2: Medicinal products to be used in emergency situations as recognised by 
Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council No. 1082/2013/EU on serious cross-border 
CHMP assessment report

threats to health amended with date of last review on 28/05/2020 to adopt measure to cope with the 
impact of the crisis following the COVID-19 outbreak. For Module 3 data the commitments are made 
with specified timelines and data will be delivered accordingly. It is therefore considered likely that the 
applicant will be able to provide the requested data and thereby fulfil the specific obligations. 
•  Unmet medical needs will be addressed. 
Currently, four COVID-19 vaccines are authorised in the EU, under conditional marketing 
authorisations: Comirnaty, Spikevax, Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen, and Vaxzevria. While these vaccines 
all demonstrated a positive benefit-risk balance, they are not covering the supply need in the European 
Union, and there is still an urgent need to provide additional prophylactic options in the context of the 
pandemic across the EU. Further authorised vaccines are therefore needed to increase the total supply 
and availability to fully vaccinate the EU/EAA population. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. 
The product provides immediate benefit for the vaccinated population in preventing COVID-19 disease. 
Data from Israel are suggesting that vaccination not only prevents COVID-19, but also limits the 
spread of the virus. Decreasing the number of patients suffering from COVID-19, as well as the spread 
of the virus impacts positively the health care systems, not only financially, but primarily in terms of 
capacity and focus on standard care of other diseases. Moreover, data from clinical trials also show 
Nuvaxovid protection from new variant strains (e.g., B.1.1.7/501Y.V1 first identified in the UK and 
B.1.351/501Y.V2 first identified in South Africa). According to the WHO´s COVID-19 Strategic 
Preparedness and Response Plan for 2021, vaccine availability, accessibility, and deployment are the 
highest health, social, economic, and political priorities for virtually every country, agency, business 
and community around the world. 
The justifications presented by the applicant are considered valid and acceptable. Therefore, a 
Conditional marketing authorisation may be granted as long as the benefit-risk balance of Nuvaxovid 
remains positive after the assessment of all submitted data. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk balance of Nuvaxovid is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
Eligibility to a conditional marketing authorisation as well as requirements have been demonstrated in 
line with provisions of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Nuvaxovid is favourable in the following indication: 
Nuvaxovid is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 
individuals 18 years of age and older. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
In view of the declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern and in order to ensure early 
supply this medicinal product is subject to a time-limited exemption allowing reliance on batch control 
testing conducted in the registered site(s) that are located in a third country. This exemption ceases to 
be valid on 31 March 2022. Implementation of EU based batch control arrangements, including the 
necessary variations to the terms of the marketing authorisation, has to be completed by 31 March 
2022 at the latest. 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Official batch release 
In accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC, the official batch release will be undertaken by a 
state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/783213/2021  
Page 161/168 
 
 
 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit-risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the 
conditional marketing authorisation 
This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Description 
Due date 
In order to ensure consistent product quality during shelf life, the MAH should 
31 January 2023 
provide additional information on stability of the finished product. 
In order to ensure consistent quality over the product life cycle, the MAH should 
31 July 2022  
adequately bridge the reference standards and review the finished product 
potency limits when additional data become available. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that SARS-CoV-2 recombinant 
spike protein is to be qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).

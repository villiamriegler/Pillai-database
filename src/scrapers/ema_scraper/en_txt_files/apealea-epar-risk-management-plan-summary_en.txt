Summary of risk management plan for 
Apealea (paclitaxel) 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Apealea's RMP. 
Apealea's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Apealea should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Apealea should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Apealea. The RMP details important risks 
of Apealea, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
Apealea's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Apealea in combination with carboplatin is authorised for the treatment of adult patients with first 
relapse of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube 
cancer (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains paclitaxel as the active substance and it is given 
by intravenous (i.v.) infusion.

II. 
• 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

If important information that may affect the safe use of Apealea is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
Important risks of Apealea are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use of Apealea. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Myelosuppression (Neutropenia, Anaemia, Thrombocytopenia) 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Prior chemotherapy might also be a risk factor, and all patients in 
the study had been previously treated. 
Lyman et al, 2005 suggested that age is a very important risk 
factor, not just age in itself, but also because of the comorbidities 
that accompany the ageing process. Other risk groups are 
patients with prior neutropenic event(s) and patients receiving a 
combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  
Clinical study OAS-07OVA and literature search. 
Myelosuppression, particularly neutropenia, is considered an 
important identified risk since it represents the most common 
dose-limiting toxicity associated with the use of Apealea in 
combination with carboplatin. Both duration and severity of the 
neutropenia are factors that may lead to febrile neutropenia. The 
duration of neutropenia is particularly important in terms of the 
risk of infections. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
In clinical study OAS-07OVA, neutropenia defined as serious 
(Grade 4 and lower if the patient was hospitalised) occurred in 
29% of the patients treated with Apealea, while Grade 3 or higher 
leukopenia was less frequent (6%) in patients treated with 
Apealea, as was anaemia (5%). Febrile neutropenia occurred in 
3% of the patients treated with Apealea. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Section 4.2 contains advice regarding treatment delay and 
dose reductions in the event of neutropenia and/or 
thrombocytopenia for Apealea in combination with carboplatin.  
Neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, 
granulocytopenia, anaemia, disseminated intravascular 
coagulation, pancytopenia, haematotoxicity and coagulopathy are 
labelled in SmPC Section 4.8. 
Since myelosuppression may occur in the event of an overdose 
this is specified in SmPC Section 4.9. 
SmPC Section 4.4 contains special precautions regarding 
myelosuppression. 
Patients with low neutrophil counts or platelet counts are 
contraindicated, SmPC Section 4.3.  
Additional risk minimisation measures:  
None proposed.

No subgroups of patients have been identified as being at a 
higher risk of developing an infusion site reaction. 
Infusion site reaction is labelled as a very common reaction in 
SmPC Section 4.8. 
Clinical study OAS-07OVA and literature search. Infusion site 
reactions are considered important identified risks since they 
were reported more frequently in patients receiving Apealea 
(12%) than Taxol (1%). The reactions were typically of low grade 
and transient. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Section 4.4 advises that these reactions are common, but 
may be improved by slowing the infusion rate. At severe 
reactions, the patient is recommended to be considered for a 
central intravenous catheter.

Several studies have attempted to identify risk factors for 
development of CIPN, which also vary with different 
chemotherapeutic agents. Some of the clinical factors implicated 
in the development of CIPN include baseline neuropathy 
(Dimopoulos et al, 2011; Badros et al 2007) the presence of 
diabetes (Badros et al 2007), smoking history and decreased 
creatinine clearance (Kawakami et al, 2012). In addition, there is 
interest in pharmacogenomics and identifying genes that may 
play a role in the development of CIPN. Although numerous 
genes have been investigated, such as GSTP1, CYP2C8, and 
AGXT, there have been no conclusive findings (Alberti and 
Cavaletti, 2014).  
Clinical study OAS-07OVA and literature search. Peripheral 
neuropathy is considered an important identified risk since it is 
associated with paclitaxel/carboplatin treatment. Chemotherapy 
induced neurotoxicity may affect patient’s response to treatment 
due to the need for dose reduction or discontinuation and also 
affect quality of life. 
The risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased if used in 
combination with other agents, depending upon the combination. 
Patients with cancer (Honnorat and Antoine, 2007).

Peripheral sensory neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy are 
labelled in SmPC Section 4.8. 
Since peripheral sensory neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy 
may occur in the event of an overdose this is specified in SmPC 
Section 4.9.  
Clinical study OAS-07OVA and literature search. Hypersensitivity 
reactions are considered important potential risks since they are 
not only reported for Cremophor-EL formulated paclitaxel but also 
have been reported for treatment with albumin-bound paclitaxel 
formulations. Even though most hypersensitivity reactions 
reported for Apealea were mild to moderate and mainly occur as 
skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, general disorders and 
administration site conditions, serious hypersensitivity reactions 
including one anaphylactic shock were reported. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Hypersensitivity reactions could appear in any cycle. Patients 
who previously suffered hypersensitivity reactions with a taxane 
formulation are at increased risk (see review by Picard and 
Castells, 2015). 
SmPC Section 4.4 cautions that patients should be observed 
closely during treatment. Moderate cases may require 
premedication. Delayed reactions related to paclitaxel occurring 
during or after infusion of carboplatin cannot be excluded. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Section 4.3 states that severe hypersensitivity to the active 
substance or the excipients is a contraindication. 
Additional risk minimisation measures:  
None proposed.

Clinical study OAS-07OVA and literature search. Even though 
there were no reports of acute renal failure or haemolytic-uremic 
syndrome in the clinical trial of Apealea, acute renal failure is 
listed as a common, and haemolytic uraemic syndrome as an 
uncommon adverse reaction for albumin-bound paclitaxel in 
combination with gemcitabine. Since albumin-bound paclitaxel 
and Apealea belongs to the same pharmacological class, acute 
renal failure is considered an important potential risk.

Risk factors and risk groups 
ln a small study (N = 9) of high-dose paclitaxel (250 mg/m2) in 
patients with advanced breast cancer, the 2 patients with hepatic 
function disturbances experienced more profound neuropathy 
(Huizing et al, 1995). However, a correlation between paclitaxel 
pharmacokinetic and sensory polyneuropathy was not seen in a 
more recent study (Joerger et al, 2007).  
In a study of the safety and pharmacology of paclitaxel in patients 
with impaired liver function (N = 37), a significantly increased 
haematological toxicity was seen in patients with increasing 
hepatic impairment, even with a lower paclitaxel exposure (AUC; 
Joerger et al, 2007). This study suggested that an individual's 
susceptibility to paclitaxel-related haematological toxicity, such as 
myelosuppression in cancer patients with moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment, could be predicted based on total bilirubin 
concentration (Joerger et al, 2007). More instances of mucositis 
and neutropenic fever were also seen in paclitaxel-treated 
patients in the higher liver impairment groups (Joerger et al, 
2007).

A Phase 2 study of paclitaxel in patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma (N = 20) showed that, in patients with hepatic 
impairment (N = 4 [toxicity data; N = 3 for PK data] according to 
indocyanine green test), the AUC was significantly increased (p 
<0.02), clearance decreased (p <0.02) and treatment-related 
deaths increased (p = 0.03) compared to those patients without 
hepatic impairment (Chao et al, 1998). 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Section 4.2 contains information of insufficient data for 
recommendation of dose modification for patients with mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic 
impairment should not be treated with paclitaxel. 
SmPC Section 4.4 warns that the toxicity of paclitaxel may be 
increased with hepatic impairment and the patients should be 
closely monitored.

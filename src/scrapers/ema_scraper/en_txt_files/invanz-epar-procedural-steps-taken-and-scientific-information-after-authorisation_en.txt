which contained the preferred term ' depressed level of

level of consciousness was reported with one or more terms 
currently listed for ertapenem under the Psychiatric or 
Nervous system SOC. The time to onset for the 12 
cumulative reports ranged for 1 to 24 days with median of 
7 days. The event of depressed level of consciousness 
occurred with a similar time to onset as several other 
events within the Psychiatric and Nervous system SOC. 
These results support the addition of the adverse event 
term "depressed level of consciousness" to section 4.8 of 
the Invanz SmPC, under the Nervous system disorders 
SOC. The Package Leaflet (Section 4) was updated 
accordingly. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line

During the renewal period no major change to the

manufacture of Invanz was implemented. No change in the 
efficacy of Invanz was observed in clinical trials conducted 
since initial marketing authorisation. With respect to safety 
data, a cumulative review on muscular weakness was 
submitted by the MAH at the request of CHMP and this 
adverse reaction was added in section 4.8 of the Invanz

SmPC as unknown frequency under SOC "Musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders" and under "Possible Side-
effects" in the Patient Leaflet. No other new specific safety 
concern was raised in a number of clinical trials conducted 
with Invanz. The safety results provided in the PSURs and 
overall safety bridging report do not indicate any other new 
safety signal or new adverse events, which are not covered 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit risk profile of Invanz continues 
to be favourable. Therefore, CHMP has recommended that 
the renewal can be granted with unlimited validity. 
The product information (PI) has been updated according 
to the latest QRD template. Finally, the list of local 
representatives for Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, 
Germany, Estonia, Luxemburg, Malta, Netherlands, Greece, 
Portugal, Island, Italy, Cyprus, Slovak Republic, Sweden 
and the UK has been updated.

single-sequence, drug-drug interaction study of doripenem 
co-administered with oral VPA, section 4.4 and section 4.5 
of the SPC for doripenem was updated to indicate that the 
concomitant use of doripenem and valproic acid/sodium 
valproate is not recommended. The interaction is believed 
to be a class effect for carbapenems. Hence, the CHMP 
proposed to initiate a class review on the interaction 
between carbapenems and valproate. As a consequence, 
this type II variation II/31 was submitted to update the 
wording of section 4.4 and section 4.5 of the SPC for 
ertapenem with information on the drug-drug interaction

The WAES database was queried:

ertapenem with the preferred terms: mental status

- from 30-Mar-2001 to 15-Jan-2009 for reports for 
ertapenem containing the preferred term 'disorientation'.

marketing environment containing the preferred terms 
myoclonus, dyskinesia and tremor. 
The submitted safety data provide some evidence of a 
temporal association with the use of ertapenem, even 
though in several cases concomitant drugs and conditions 
were present to confound the association and there was a 
lack of information on re-challenge in many of cases. 
Nevertheless, overall, the above data and the plausible 
precedent of other undesirable effects on mental state and 
the nervous system already listed individually in the SPC 
suggests that "aggression, delirium, disorientation, mental 
state changes, dyskinesia & myoclonus" should be included 
as undesirable effects observed from post marketing 
experience.

This update to the product information is based on a review

surveillance. Section 4 of the PL has been updated 
accordingly. The MAH took the opportunity to update 
the contact details of the local representative in 
Ireland in section 6 of the PL. 
of spontaneously-reported cases of altered mental status as 
found in the MAH's database.  
In the documentation submitted, a total of 14 reports with 
the preferred term, mental status changes (MSC) were 
reported in temporal association with the use of ertapenem 
for the period from market introduction to 29 March 2008. 
Page 13/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
Of 13/14 reports, the onset time of MSC after start of 
ertapenem sodium was provided in 6/13 reports and 
ranged from 30 minutes to 6 days. Documentation of 
mental status level on discontinuation of ertapenem sodium 
was provided in 7/13 reports. Full recovery to baseline 
mental status occurred in 5 patients, 1 patient experienced 
partial recovery and 1 did not return to baseline. The 6 
remaining reports did not provide information regarding the 
patient's mental status after discontinuation of ertapenem 
sodium. 
One/13 case reported both a positive de-challenge and a 
positive re-challenge with reoccurrence of MSC within days 
of restarting ertapenem sodium, although the remaining 13 
cases have less detail and causality is less clear. However, 
on the basis of the likely causal association of the main 
case, and possible association of remaining cases, altered 
mental status has been included in the product information. 
The balance of risks and benefits remains positive and no 
additional action is warranted at this stage.

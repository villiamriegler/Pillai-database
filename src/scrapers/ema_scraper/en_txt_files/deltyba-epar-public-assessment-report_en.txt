2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is defined as TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that 
is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. Approximately 500,000 cases of MDR-TB occur globally 
every year which corresponds to approximately 5% of the world’s annual burden of tuberculosis. In 
Europe, Japan and the United States, MDR-TB is an orphan indication. Within the member states of the 
European Union, a total of 1715 laboratory-confirmed cases of MDR-TB were reported in 2007, including 
300 in central European countries and 1415 in Eastern European countries with the largest burden in 
Romania (754 cases) and Lithuania (754 cases).  In the United States there were 13,767 TB cases in 
2006 but ~ 1% (< 150) cases were MDR-TB.   
MDR-TB is associated with a considerable mortality rate and poses a significant public health threat. The 
mortality rate is more than 10% in national treatment programs and has been estimated to be as high 
as 32% worldwide. Individuals infected with drug-resistant strains who are unable to receive adequate 
treatment present a considerable public health risk and are capable of spreading primary MDR-TB 
infection.   
The current treatment recommendations are based on direct susceptibility testing results to select active 
agents and on an overall regimen as shown in the diagram. 
Nevertheless, the failure rate for MDR-TB treatment is high. In a recent meta-analysis of studies, which 
included 4959 patients with MDR-TB from 21 countries over a period of more than three decades, 
successful outcome (cure or completion of treatment) was reported for only 62% (range: 39-77%) of 
patients; an unsuccessful outcome was reported for 38% (range: 23-61%) of patients and death for 
11% (range: 0-32%) of patients1. In a recent study in Latvia in which MDR-TB patients (N=167) were 
treated under WHO guidelines, 77% of subjects experienced a conversion of sputum culture (over a

median duration of 60 days), 23% of patients remained sputum culture positive and 8% died2. Similar 
findings were reported from a study in Peru of 66 patients with MDR-TB who received second-line 
therapy as recommended by the WHO. Of these 66, 83% achieved probable cure and 8% died while 
receiving therapy3. 
The increasing global burden of MDR-TB and the public health risk have created an urgent need for 
anti-TB agents with novel modes of action and with activity against multiple drug-resistant strains of M. 
tuberculosis. Worldwide, MDR-TB has become a major barrier to achieving successful control of TB 
because therapy is less effective, associated with more adverse events and more costly and complex 
(e.g. takes much longer and involves injectable agents) compared with standard first-line therapy. The 
critical need in drug resistant TB is further amplified by reports of extensively drug-resistant TB 
(XDR-TB), which currently represents approximately 7-10% of MDR-TB isolates. In addition to 
rifampicin and isoniazid, XDR-TB strains are resistant to any fluoroquinolone and to at least one 
injectable second-line drug (capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin) so that treatment options are very 
limited. 
About the product 
Delamanid (formerly OPC-67683) is a nitro-dihydro-imidazo-oxazole derivative that was discovered by 
Otsuka in a screen for inhibitors of mycolic acid biosynthesis. Delamanid is practically insoluble in 
aqueous solution of pH ≥ 4 but it is soluble to some extent in organic solvents and in aqueous solutions 
at lower pH.  
The antibacterial activity of delamanid is specific for Mycobacteria. Against M. tuberculosis MIC values 
are typically in the range 0.006 to 0.012 µg/mL and there is no cross-resistance with any of the currently 
used anti-TB drugs. Delamanid has been developed solely for oral treatment of MDR-TB in conjunction 
with other active agents.   
The (revised) proposed indication and posology from the applicant was as follows. 
4.1 Therapeutic indications 
{Delamanid Otsuka} is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary infections due to 
multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis as part of an appropriate combination regimen 
(see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Delamanid should be administered by physicians experienced in the treatment of pulmonary 
tuberculosis. 
Posology 
The recommended daily dose for adults is 100 mg twice daily, taken with food, for 24 weeks. 
Delamanid must always be administered as part of an appropriate combination regimen for the 
treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) according to WHO guidelines (see sections 
4.4 and 5.1).  
Treatment  with  an  appropriate  combination  regimen  should  continue  after  completion  of  the 
24-week delamanid treatment period according to WHO guidelines.

Elderly patients (> 65 years of age) 
No data are available in the elderly. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment 
(see section 5.2).  
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Delamanid 
is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 
5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of delamanid in children and adolescents below 18 years has not yet been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Delamanid should be taken with food. 
The development programme/Compliance with CHMP Guidance/Scientific Advice 
The applicant conducted a Phase 2 study in which delamanid (either 100 mg or 200 mg BID) was 
compared to placebo when each was added to optimized background regimen (OBR) over 8 weeks. After 
reaching week 8 (Day 56) subjects stopped delamanid/placebo and continued OBR with sampling to Day 
84. Subjects were then invited to participate in an uncontrolled follow-on study in which they received 
delamanid 100 mg BID (with option to receive 200 mg BID after week 2) for a total of 26 weeks. 
With regard to compliance with the TB guideline, the applicant approached clinical development along 
the lines suggested but only compared delamanid with placebo over 8 weeks.  
There is an ongoing Phase 3 study 242-09-213 with an estimated date of submission in 2015. The study 
evaluates the efficacy of delamanid 100 mg twice daily (BID) for 2 months followed by 200 mg once daily 
(QD) for 4 months in combination with an optimized background regimen (OBR) versus placebo + OBR 
during the 6-month intensive phase of MDR TB treatment. This is a multicentre, randomized, 
double-blind, stratified, placebo-controlled study conducted globally in 2 parallel groups at 
approximately 15 sites qualified to treat MDR TB. In addition, a sub-study comprises HIV-positive 
patients on antiretrovirals (ARVs).

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The 
chemical 
name 
(IUPAC) 
of 
delamanid 
is 
(2R)-2-methyl-6-nitro-2-[(4-{4-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenoxy] 
piperidin-1-yl}phenoxy)methyl]-2,3-dihydroimidazo[2,1-b][1,3]oxazole  and  it  has  the  following 
structural formula: 
Delamanid consists of white to pale yellow crystals or crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble in 
water,  slightly  soluble  in  methanol,  sparingly  soluble  in  benzyl  alcohol  and  acetonitrile,  soluble  in 
acetone, and freely soluble in tetrahydrofuran. It is not hygroscopic. 
Having an asymmetric carbon at the C-2 position of the 2,3-dihydroimidazo[2,1-b]oxazole ring, it is an 
optically active compound; the R-enantiomer is used. The enantiomeric purity of delamanid is controlled 
routinely by chiral HPLC. No polymorphs or solvates have been found.  
The chemical structure of delamanid has been verified using elemental and spectroscopic analysis (MS, 
UV, IR, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR). 
Information on the active substance was provided in an Active Substance Master File (ASMF).  
Manufacture 
The active substance is manufactured in three main steps, including final recrystallization. Well defined 
starting materials with acceptable specifications are used for the active substance synthesis.  Critical 
process  parameters  have  been  defined.    In-process  controls  are  in  place  at  all  critical  steps  of  the 
synthetic process. Specifications and control methods for starting materials, reagents and intermediate 
products have been presented. 
During development the manufacturing process has been modified and optimised to improve quality of 
the active substance, increase yield and decrease environmental impact. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing process of the active substance has been provided in the 
restricted part of the AMSF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identity  (IR,  UV),  assay  (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), optical purity (S-isomer; HPLC), loss on drying, residual solvents (GC), heavy metals, 
melting point and residue on ignition. 
Each specification parameter was sufficiently justified. Analytical methods used have been adequately 
described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated.

Batch analysis data are provided for 32 batches produced with the proposed synthetic route four of them 
are of commercial size. The batch analysis data show that the active substance can be manufactured 
reproducibly. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Sufficient  information  is  provided  on  potential  impurities  and  residual  solvents.  Levels  of  impurities 
found in the batches of the active substance are toxicologically justified and well below specification 
limits. One genotoxic impurity, which is a reagent in the synthesis, is specified in the active substance. 
The  limit  was  established  based  on  the  Threshold  of  Toxicological  Concern  (TTC).  Batch  results  are 
consistently below detection limit; therefore, skip testing for this impurity is considered acceptable. 
Stability 
Three  pilot scale batches of the active substance packed in double LDPE bags and fibre drums were put 
on  stability  testing  as  per  ICH  conditions:  under  long  term  conditions  (30°C/65%RH)  for  up  to  36 
months and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for 6 months. The stability data show no apparent degradation 
and very little variability. 
All  the  results  conformed  to  the  specifications  for  all  parameters  tested  (appearance,  identification, 
optical  rotation,  melting  point,  impurities,  optical  purity,  loss  on  drying  and  assay).  The  analytical 
methods were the same as for release and were stability indicating.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch and confirmed that 
delamanid is not light sensitive. 
No changes in the tested parameters were observed for delamanid stored under stressed conditions at 
50°C  (closed  amber  glass  bottle),  25°C/90%  RH  (open  glass  bottle)  and  40°C/75%  RH  (open  glass 
bottle) for 3 months. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  drug  substance  manufacturer  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Delamanid is practically insoluble in water and its solubility increases only slightly under a lower pH 
(under 4). Therefore, a complex approach to this oral solid dosage form development was necessary.  
From early development stages, formulation development was focused on dissolution enhancement. 
Several approaches were investigated; finally a technology showing higher solubility and higher 
bioavailability compared to tablets produced with active substance in crystal form was selected. 
Delamanid 50 mg tablets with this powder blend have been used throughout the clinical studies since 
the latter stage of phase I studies.  The clinical and intended commercial tablets are exactly the same 
formula. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
Standards and/or EC directive. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. 
The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. The compatibility of the excipients with the 
drug substance has been established during preliminary stability studies.

A Quality by Design (QbD) approach was applied during development,  a risk analysis was conducted to 
identify the critical points in the manufacturing process and to establish a proven acceptable range 
(PAR) for each process parameter. 
Critical quality attributes (CQA) were identified for the product, based on the quality target product 
profile (QTTP). The process parameters in the selected process have been investigated and optimized 
based on the design of experiments (DoE) result targeting the crystallinity as one of the proposed CQAs.  
Critical parameters to the performance of the product are controlled by a dissolution method which was 
proved to be of sufficient discriminatory power. The manufacturing process for the powder blend is 
considered a key process as the dissolution performance of delamanid tablets is highly dependent on the 
powder blend characteristics. To establish proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for this process, a two-tier 
DoE with factorial design was performed to evaluate the influence of several process variables on CQAs. 
Cross interaction evaluation indicated that none of the combinations impacted the CQA significantly. In 
a second step the DoE was repeated with three of the dominating process variables in order to confirm 
the acceptable operating range around a centre point. Appropriate in-process controls have been put in 
place.  
PARs which will be applied in routine production were defined and confirmed for other processes. 
For  the  compression  step,  a  design  of  experiments  was  set  up  and  the  results  indicated  the  critical 
parameter with respect to the CQAs. A statistical evaluation is performed to identify the design space 
and PAR for the critical parameter with respect to the CQAs and a PAR was established which is narrower 
than the design space. 
The film coating process was successfully scaled up and optimised. From a quality point of view, this step 
was deemed as low risk and not further investigated during manufacturing process development. 
A discussion was provided on the impact of the batch size on the different manufacturing steps in order 
to identify the up- or downscaling strategy in the future.  
The  finished  product  contains  hypromellose  phthalate  (HPMCP)  as  a  component  of  the  tablet 
formulation. There are two potentially toxic substances which may be derived from HPMCP. Sufficient 
toxicology and batch analysis data those substances were submitted and strict limits were introduced in 
the finished product specification. As the amounts in the batch analysis were well below the established 
limits, the presence of hypromellose phthalate in the finished product is considered acceptable. 
The  primary  packaging  is  an  aluminium/aluminium  blister  or  an  amber  glass  bottle  (type  III)  with 
polypropylene  child  resistant  closure,  polyester  insert  and  desiccant  canister(s).  The  choice  of  the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. 
Adventitious agents 
Lactose monohydrate, used as an excipient, is the only material of animal origin which is used in the 
product. Appropriate declaration confirming compliance with the TSE guideline has been provided by the 
lactose manufacturer. Lactose is produced from milk obtained from healthy animals under the same 
conditions as milk intended for human consumption and that it has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet in accordance with the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform  Encephalopathy  Agent  Via  Human  and  veterinary  medicinal 
products. 
Magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin.

Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is divided into 4 main steps: preparation of powder blend, blending, 
compression, film coating. 
The active substance is dispersed in polymer matrix, which is an intermediate in the finished product 
manufacturing process. 
For the tablet manufacture, tablets are prepared using the powder blend and are mixed with the 
remaining excipients, in the last manufacturing step, the tablets are film-coated.  
Critical steps of the manufacturing process were identified. Based on the critical quality attributes 
(CQAs) identified for the product, process parameters for the critical steps were evaluated and the 
proven acceptable ranges (PARs) were established during the development. The proposed CQAs have 
been incorporated either in the in-process control or the QC release testing. The available development 
data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support 
the proposed PARs. The manufacturing process both for the intermediate and for bulk film-coated 
tablets is validated with three consecutive batches of commercial scale.  Validation data demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form. The 
product is tested for appearance, identification of delamanid and tocopherol (HPLC), identification of iron 
oxide yellow (Ph.Eur.), impurities (HPLC), assay of delamanid (HPLC), assay of tocopherol (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), two specific phthalates-related substances (HPLC), dissolution and 
microbial purity.  
The acceptance criteria for all specification parameters are justified by batch results and comply with 
relevant  CHMP/ICH  guidelines.  The  degradation  products  are  discussed  and  specified  in  the  finished 
product as appropriate. 
All test methods for the finished product control are sufficiently described and appropriately validated.  
Batch  analysis  results  were  provided  for  3  batches  of  production  scale.  Results  of  clinical  batches, 
manufactured  at  pilot  or  smaller  scale,  are  provided  as  supportive  data.  All  results  comply  with 
specifications.  
Stability of the product 
Stability studies were conducted on 3 production-scale batches of tablets packaged in the commercial 
package, glass bottles and aluminum/aluminum foil blisters. The long-term stability study is on-going 
(25°C/60%RH)  and  24  months  data  are  provided;  results  of  completed  accelerated  studies 
(40°C/75%RH, 6 months) are available in the dossier.  
Stability studies were also conducted on production-scale batches of bulk tablets packaged in double 
polyethylene  bags/aluminum  bag.  Additionally,  stability  study  was  conducted  on  delamanid  powder 
blend intermediate.

In  addition,  photostability  testing  was  conducted  with  one  batch  of  exposed  delamanid  tablets  and 
freeze-thaw  cycling  studies  were  completed  with  tablets  packaged  in  aluminium/aluminium  blister 
packs, glass bottles and bulk packaging.  The photostability results show no signs of photodegradation; 
freeze-thaw samples show no degradation or trends in any of the tested parameters.  
The parameters tested include description, identification, impurities/degradation products, dissolution, 
delamanid  assay,  tocopherol  assay  and  microbial  testing  (long-term  testing  only).  For  information 
purpose, additional testing is performed for water content, disintegration, hardness, crystallinity and 
optical purity. These tests will not be repeated in post-approval stability studies. 
The stability samples were tested using the same analytical methods as for release; the methods are 
stability indicating.  
Overall, no significant changes were observed in any studies throughout the period tested to date. The 
overall stability results obtained are similar between the different packaging materials. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC 
are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
The  applicant  has  applied  QbD  principles  in  the  development  of  the  finished  product  and  its 
manufacturing  process.  However  no  design  space  was  claimed  for the  manufacturing  process  of  the 
finished product.  
The use of HPMCP as a component of the tablet formulation has been justified and the proposed control 
strategy  for  the  specific  phthalates-related  substances  is  acceptable  and  justified  from  toxicological 
point of view. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GLP 
The pivotal toxicology and the majority of the safety pharmacology studies conducted by the applicant 
were reported to be GLP compliant.  The safety studies that were not conducted to GLP were conducted 
to an appropriate scientific standard. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The pharmacological mode of action of delamanid involves inhibition of the synthesis of the 
mycobacterial cell wall components, methoxy-mycolic and keto-mycolic acid.  This is observed at lower 
IC50 values than that of isoniazid (INH).  However, unlike INH, delamanid does not inhibit α-mycolic acid 
biosynthesis.  The mode of action has been investigated in M. bovis BCG only.  The genome sequence of 
M. bovis is > 99.95% identical to that of M. tuberculosis. Moreover, delamanid shows the same level of 
activity against M. tuberculosis and the other sub-species of the M. tuberculosis complex including M. 
bovis BCG.  Taken together these data suggest that the mechanism of action in M. bovis and M. 
tuberculosis should be identical.  The precise mechanism of action is unknown; however, there is 
evidence to suggest that delamanid requires metabolic activation by M. bovis BCG in order for the 
anti-TB activity to be exerted and that this activation is possibly mediated via the deazaflavin-dependent 
nitroreductase (Rv3547) and F420 coenzyme system. 
M. tuberculosis is genetically diverse and different strain lineages of M. tuberculosis are associated with 
different geographic regions.  Phenotypic differences between clinical isolates exist.  In the in vitro 
studies a broad range of strains were investigated and the choice of the strains requires further 
justification in terms of the relevance to the European region.  Delamanid is highly active against both 
sensitive and resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, with MIC values of 0.006 to 0.012 µg/mL compared to 
0.05 to > 100 µg/mL observed for reference compounds.  Delamanid is active against hypoxic-induced 
dormant M bovis BCG assessed using an anaerobic culture system.  Delamanid exhibited 
dose-dependent bactericidal activity at concentrations ≥ 0.4 μg/mL. In contrast, INH had no effect on 
hypoxic-induced dormant M bovis BCG at concentrations up to 10 μg/mL.  Elimination of dormant bacilli 
which may serve as a reservoir is important in reducing the duration of the treatment time.  Delamanid 
is active against intracellular M tuberculosis and M bovis BCG, which is of importance since M. 
tuberculosis can survive as an intracellular pathogen in host macrophages, leading to prolonged or 
recurrent infections. 
The 8 identified delamanid metabolites show a poor anti-mycobacterial effect (MIC > 6.25 µg/ml) when 
compared to delamanid (MIC 0.006-0.012 µg/ml) against 10 M. tuberculosis strains.  The 3 delamanid 
metabolites (R)-DM-6701, (R)-DM-6702 and (R)-DM-6703 showed poor activity against standard 
anaerobic and aerobic strains, although more than delamanid itself. 
The in vitro frequency of spontaneous resistance to delamanid is high and is almost equal to those for 
reference compounds, INH and PA-824.  Values for moxifloxacin and rifampicin were substantially lower. 
Comparison to other agents has not been included. Mutation in one of the five coenzyme F420 genes 
fgd, Rv3547, fbiA, fbiB, fbiC is suggested as the mechanism for resistance against delamanid.  These 
Assessment report

seem to be the same enzymes and co-factors as suggested to be responsible for the activation of 
delamanid. Since these enzymes and co-factors are seemingly non-essential in vitro, as a result, a 
variety of mutations can give rise to resistance. 
In vivo efficacy of delamanid has been investigated in animal models through investigation of lung, 
spleen and liver colony-forming unit counts.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
In mice significant decreases in pulmonary viable bacteria count vs. vehicle control were observed 
with delamanid ≥ 0.313 mg/kg/day (p < 0.01). Using regression analysis, the effective dose of 
delamanid (corresponding to the therapeutic dose of rifampicin 3.5 mg/kg/day) was 0.52 
mg/kg/day. 
In immunodeficient BALB/c nude or immunocompetent BALB/c mice delamanid showed significant 
dose-dependent activity at ≥ 0.625 mg/kg/day, measured as reduction of viable bacteria count in 
lung, liver and spleen. Some activity was observed in both studies at 0.313 mg/kg/day. No clear 
distinction was seen between normal and nude mice. 
In a mouse model of TB using M. tuberculosis MDR strains the survival time during an 8-month 
period following treatment was superior in delamanid-treated mice vs. reference compounds. 
Studies in guinea pigs also supported in-vivo activity of delamanid. 
It is concluded that studies in mice suggest that once or twice daily treatment with delamanid 
provides comparable exposures (AUC) and demonstrates comparable efficacy.  There was no 
difference in delamanid activity in normal and immunodeficient mice and delamanid was effective 
against infection with either MDR-TB or drug-susceptible strains.  In a mouse model, early 
bactericidal activity (EBA) values for delamanid were similar to those for INH and more potent than 
EBA values for rifampicin. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
At the end of the evaluation procedure, the applicant provided a secondary pharmacology study, 
conducted according to the request of the Agency. The effects of delamanid on a series of receptors, 
enzymes and ion channels will however be further assessed in post-authorisation phase. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
A series of safety pharmacology studies have been provided which evaluate the effects of delamanid and 
its metabolites on the central nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and renal systems. 
No treatment related effects on the central nervous system were noted at plasma levels that were 
~18.5-fold higher than that proposed clinically (following 100 mg BID).  In addition, no 
treatment-related effects on respiratory rate were observed at exposures that were 3.2-fold higher than 
the maximum proposed Cmax in humans. 
During a series of safety pharmacology studies performed to investigate the effects on the 
cardiovascular system, some degree of hERG channel inhibition was observed with delamanid (35.4% at 
1.6 µg/mL); no effect on action potential duration was observed during a guinea pig papillary muscle 
assay (at up to 1.6 µg/mL) and delamanid had no effect on QT interval in vivo following single oral 
administration in the dog, where plasma levels of delamanid were ≤3.2-fold higher than those observed 
in man. However, QT/QTc prolongation was observed following repeated administration in the dog and 
in man. 
The applicant has suggested that the observed QT prolongation in vivo might be due to metabolites of 
delamanid as the exposures to the plasma metabolites were higher upon repeated administration. The 
Assessment report

effects of the human metabolites (R)-DM 6701 (=DM-6704), (R)-DM-6702 (=DM-6705), (R)-DM-6703 
(=DM-6706), (S)-DM-6717, (S)-DM-6718, (4RS, 5S)-DM-6720, (4R, 5S)-DM-6721, and (4S, 
5S)-DM-6722 were investigated in subsequent studies using HEK-293 or CHO-K1 cells stably expressing 
the hERG channel.  Inhibition of the hERG channel current was observed with (R)-DM 6701 (≥0.5 
µg/mL), (R)-DM-6702 (≥ 0.15 µg/mL) and (4RS, 5S)-DM-6720 (0.5 µg/mL) and the most pronounced 
effects on hERG channel inhibition were observed with the predominant metabolite (R)-DM-6702 (IC 50 
0.04 µg/mL). 
Although delamanid and the metabolites (R)-DM-6701, (R)-DM-6702 and (4RS, 5S) DM 6720 could 
collectively contribute to the observed QT prolongation in vivo; given the time course and the exposures 
of the metabolites in man, it is likely that the (R)-DM-6702 (DM-6705) is a significant contributor to the 
observed effect. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
For a description of pharmacodynamic drug interactions, refer to the “clinical aspects” section of this 
report. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A series of method validation, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetic drug 
interaction studies have been conducted. With the exception of the pharmacokinetic drug interaction 
studies, the package is considered to be adequate. 
In fed animals, the absolute oral bioavailability for the jet milled formulation was estimated to be 42.2%, 
34.9% and 61.3% in the mouse, rat and dog, respectively.  Cmax and AUC for delamanid generally 
increased in a less than dose proportional manner and there was some evidence of accumulation on 
repeated-dosing in the rat and dog.  In the dog, food intake caused an appreciable increase in the 
systemic exposures following oral administration of delamanid.  However the “food effect” was less 
pronounced with the solid dispersion formulation and therefore supports the selection of this formulation 
for use in humans. 
In vitro protein binding of delamanid and the metabolites (R)-DM-6701, (R)-DM-6702, and 
(R)-DM-6703 to mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and human sera was high (≥ 97.4%).  Distribution of 
delamanid and/or its metabolites into the lung was observed in both the mouse and the rat.  In the rat, 
following oral administration of radiolabeled-delamanid, drug-related radioactivity was widely 
distributed and the highest tissue:plasma ratio was observed in the liver and the adrenal gland, which 
correlates with the route of elimination and/or the target organ toxicity observed.  The radioactivity 
retention in the eyes of pigmented rats was longer than that observed in non-pigmented animals, which 
suggests an association of delamanid and/or its metabolites with melanin.  Following repeated dosing for 
21 days, accumulation of drug-related material was observed and the ratio of radioactivity in the tissues 
on Day 21 to that observed on Day 1 was highest in the testis. 
Following single oral administration of 14C-delamanid to pregnant rats, delamanid-related radioactivity 
crosses the placenta in rats, whereby the concentrations of radioactivity in fetal tissues were greater 
than or equal to those observed in maternal blood at ≥24 hours post-dose.  The fetus:plasma ratios 
were >1 at 48 and 72 hours post-dose.   
There is some evidence of accumulation of radioactivity within the amniotic fluid and the fetus over time 
and this most likely contributes to the reproductive toxicity observed in the rat.  Drug-related material

also distributed into the milk of lactating rats; hence, breast-feeding should be discontinued upon 
treatment with delamanid. 
Overall, the transformation of delamanid is thought to be mediated primarily by plasma albumin and to 
a lesser extent, the enzymes CYP3A4, CYP1A1, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1.  There is evidence to suggest that 
the proposed mechanism for the metabolism of delamanid to DM-6705 involves a reaction between the 
amino groups in albumin and the 5-C of the 6-nitro-2,3-dihydroimidazo [2,1-b] oxazole moiety of 
delamanid. 
Following single and repeated oral administration to the mouse, rat, rabbit and dog, the plasma levels of 
the metabolites were consistently lower than that of the parent, with the exception of the metabolite 
DM-6717 in rabbit plasma.  Delamanid and (R)-DM-6702 were identified as the predominant analytes in 
the mouse, rat and dog (plasma, tissues, urine and/or feces).  In the mouse, rat, rabbit and dog, the 
enantiomeric ratio of delamanid [and the metabolites (R)-DM-6701, (R)-DM-6702 and (R)-DM-6703] 
was ≥ 99.8% as the R-enantiomer, suggesting that there was no enantiomeric conversion.  The 
metabolites identified following the administration of delamanid (100 or 200 mg BID) in man 
[(R)-DM-6701, (R)-DM-6702, (R)-DM-6703, DM-6717, DM-6718, DM6720, DM-6721, DM-6722] have 
all been identified in at least one or more of the species evaluated. 
The question though as to whether all human metabolites have been adequately assessed from a 
toxicological perspective remains unanswered. Hence, this necessitates a new mass balance study to 
investigate and profile potential reactive metabolites. 
The potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions at the level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) have been 
evaluated.  In vitro, delamanid at 5 µM was not a substrate or an inhibitor for P-gp mediated transport 
and it is noted that the concentration of delamanid was approximately 15-fold lower than the estimated 
concentration of 74.8 μM in the intestinal lumen (following administration of 100 mg).  Hence, an effect 
at the level of gut cannot be ruled out.  Additional studies to evaluate the effects of delamanid and 
(R)-DM-6702 at a series of transporter systems were conducted.  The results of these in vitro 
transporter-based studies will be further scrutinised in post-authorisation phase.. The results provided 
thus far suggest that at the concentrations tested (3 to 10µM), the potential for delamanid and 
(R)-DM-6702 to inhibit BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OCT1 and BSEP is low.  
Overall, the potential for delamanid to cause pharmacokinetic interactions via inhibition or induction of 
the CYP enzymes investigated thus far is considered to be low. In accordance with the Guideline on Drug 
Interactions, the potential to induce CYP2B6 will also be evaluated. Factors that might potentially affect 
metabolism by plasma albumin (which could in turn increase the levels of delamanid and thus increase 
the risk of CYP inhibition or transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions) have not yet been identified.  
However, no clinically relevant changes in the plasma concentrations of delamanid and DM-6705 
occurred in MDR-TB patients with hypoalbuminaemia when compared to those with albumin levels 
within the normal range. 
A drug-drug interaction study with Rifater, which contained rifampin, an inducer of CYP3A4, indicated 
that the concentrations of delamanid decreased by about 50%; hence there is a need to prohibit 
co-administration of delamanid with strong inducers of CYP3A4 (contra-indication added to Section 4.3 
of the SmPC).

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single and repeat dose toxicity 
The applicant has presented a series of single and repeated-dose studies in the rat, rabbit and dog 
whereby delamanid was administered via the oral route for up to 39 weeks.  The studies performed are 
considered appropriate for the proposed clinical duration of 6 months.  The systemic exposures for 
delamanid at the no-effect levels from the 26-week rat study are 4.3 to 16.7-fold higher than the 
proposed clinical Cmax which is acceptable.  The exposure margins (Cmax and AUC) based on the 
no-effect levels from studies in the dog ranged from 0.48 to 1.  It is evident that the no-effect levels for 
the pivotal toxicity studies in the dog were primarily based upon the QT prolongation observed.  QT 
prolongation has been reported in man and some precautions have been included in the SmPC. 
In the rat, alterations in red blood cell parameters (decreased hematocrit and red blood cell count and 
increased reticulocyte ratio) were observed at exposures in excess of those proposed clinically.  
Interestingly, abnormal values for hematocrit, hemoglobin and red blood cell count were observed 
during the clinical studies; however, the observed changes from baseline were generally comparable 
between treatment groups. 
In vivo studies demonstrated a pronounced inhibitory effect of delamanid on blood coagulation, whereby 
parameters such as PT and APTT were prolonged (mouse, rat, rabbit, but no effects reported in the dog) 
and the plasma levels of several clotting factors, including factors, II, VII, IX and X, were reduced 
following administration of delamanid (rabbit).  Although measurements did not show a profound impact 
of delamanid on endogenous vitamin K levels, these studies demonstrated that supplementation with 
vitamin K 1 could counteract inhibitory effects on coagulation following delamanid administration. An 
in vitro study conducted with rabbit liver microsomes demonstrated significant inhibition of vitamin K1 
epoxide reductase, a model of endogenous vitamin K1 formation, by delamanid metabolite DM-6717.  
The data presented thus far therefore suggest that the metabolite DM-6717 has a key role in the 
interference with vitamin K-dependent coagulation and it is important to note that the exposures to 
DM-6717 observed at the effective doses were substantially higher than that observed in man.  The role 
of other metabolites of delamanid in these processes has not been entirely elucidated.  Although a 
definitive effect on clotting has not been reported in man, these findings have been summarised in 
Section 5.3 of the proposed SmPC.  
In the dog, histopathological findings were noted in the liver at ≥ proposed clinical exposures and these 
findings were not associated with any signs of necrosis.  There is clinical evidence to suggest that 
treatment with delamanid may occasionally cause hepatic damage.  Hence, liver disorders have been 
included as an important potential risk in the risk management plan.  In the same species, foamy 
macrophages were observed in the lymphoid follicles of various organs during the definitive 13-week 
and the 39-week studies.  The incidence and/or degree increased in a dose dependent manner, the 
finding was shown to be partially reversible and the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.  
These findings have been included within section 5.3 of the proposed SmPC. 
Genotoxicity 
The applicant has conducted a series of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies with delamanid and the 
metabolites (R)-DM-6701, (R)-DM-6702, (R)-DM-6703 and DM-6718. Delamanid and its metabolites 
were non-mutagenic and the data therefore suggest that administration of delamanid will not pose a 
genotoxic risk to humans.  Moreover, in the mouse and rat, repeated oral administration of delamanid 
for up to 104 weeks did not appear to be carcinogenic. 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 20/140 
 
 
  
  
Carcinogenicity 
In the mouse and rat, repeated oral administration of delamanid for up to 104 weeks did not appear to 
be carcinogenic. 
Examination of the rat carcinogenicity study and some of the non-pivotal studies conducted in the rat, 
rabbit and dog revealed histopathological changes in the adrenal tissues (such as cortical cell 
hypertrophy, swelling and necrosis of the zona glomerulosa and focal infiltration of the mononuclear 
cells).  These findings occurred at exposures in excess of those proposed clinically and were not 
observed during the pivotal repeat-dose studies.  Moreover, any observed change in adrenocortical 
function in man (elevation of cortisol levels) was associated with tuberculosis disease and not with 
delamanid therapy.  Hence the observed findings within the adrenal tissues were not considered to be 
clinically relevant. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The applicant conducted a series of reproductive toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit to evaluate the 
effects of delamanid on fertility and embryofetal development.  Delamanid had no effect on male or 
female fertility (rat) at up to 300 mg/kg/day.  In the rat, delamanid was not teratogenic at exposures 
(AUC) that were ~16.7-fold higher than those proposed clinically. 
Embryofetal development studies were also performed with metabolites (R)-DM-6702 and (S)-DM-6718 
on the basis that these metabolites represented >20% of drug-related exposure.  Following repeated 
administration of the metabolite (R)-DM-6702, fetal anomalies (oedema) and variations including 
(thymic remnant in the neck and bipartite ossification of the thoracic vertebral body) were noted at 
exposures that were 3.6 fold higher than proposed clinically.  Following repeated administration with 
(S)-DM-6718, general oedema of the fetus was noted at exposures that were similar to that proposed in 
man.  In the rabbit, delamanid was not teratogenic at the doses evaluated; however, a slight increase in 
the incidence of resorptions was noted at 10 mg/kg/day.  Although it is feasible that the observed finding 
may be due to the observed toxicity in the dam (reduced body weight gain), the NOAEL for the effects 
on the dam and for maintenance of pregnancy is considered to be 5 mg/kg/day.  The package of 
reproductive toxicology studies has addressed all of the identified disproportionate metabolites to date.  
However, the applicant should consider the impact of any significant unidentified human metabolites on 
the ability to predict the potential to cause reproductive toxicity. 
Local Tolerance  
Delamanid did not appear to have any ocular irritant effects and was a non-irritant to skin in New 
Zealand White rabbits 
Other toxicity studies 
Data from the whole tissue distribution studies indicate drug-related material is retained within the 
pigmented eye and that delamanid binds to melanin.  There were no clear ophthalmic findings in the 
repeated dose studies apart from some sporadic occurrences of retinal rosettes at exposures that were 
16.7-fold higher than that proposed clinically (pivotal 4 week rat study only).  It is noted that these

findings were not observed in the definitive 26-week rat study, or in the repeated-dose studies in the 
dog.  Moreover, the applicant has provided in vitro data which demonstrate that delamanid is not 
phototoxic at concentrations that are well in excess of those proposed clinically (0.41 µg/mL).  Taken 
together the data suggest that proposed dose of delamanid does not pose a risk of phototoxicity. 
The Safety Working Party (SWP) has recently considered the issue of phthalates in medicinal products.  
In order to address concerns with respect to the lack of data concerning the toxicity (particularly the 
genotoxicity and the reproductive toxicity) of hypromellose phthalate (HPMCP), the applicant has 
supplied data to demonstrate that the proposed dose of the excipient, hypromellose phthalate (HPMCP) 
does not pose a safety risk to man.    The applicant provided data where HPMCP was administered as the 
placebo control.  Repeated dose studies in the mouse (up to 100 weeks), rat (26-week) and dog 
(39-week) demonstrated no test-article (HPMPC) related effects at corresponding human equivalent 
doses (HEDs) of~6, 12 and 4-fold higher.  Older studies in the published domain (Kitagawa et al., 1973) 
have identified 6000 mg/kg/day as the NOAEL for HPMCP in the rat following repeated administration for 
six months.  Based on the results from a bacterial reverse mutation test and a bone marrow 
micronucleus test and an in vivo/in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis (USD) test in rat hepatocytes, the 
applicant considered HPMCP not to be genotoxic.   Further data have meanwhile become available, 
based on a study conducted according to ICH S2 (R1) Guideline (data to be assessed in 
post-authorisation phase). 
The applicant has provided data to demonstrate that HPMCP should not have an effect on fertility and 
early embryonic development.  In addition, data from the literature (published in 1972) have shown that 
sternal deformities occurred in animals treated with HPMCP during embryofetal development studies in 
the mouse and rat.  Similar findings were noted in controls at a slightly lower incidence which made the 
data difficult to interpret.  Moreover, close examination of the publication revealed that in the rat, there 
was an increase in the incidence of a supernumerary rib and this appeared to be significant at 20 and 
200 mg/kg/day.  However, it was demonstrated that HPMCP had no effect on the parameters evaluated 
during the embryofetal development studies conducted in the rat and the rabbit (when compared to that 
observed with historical controls).  The doses of HPMCP evaluated in the rat (900 mg/kg) were 
substantially higher than that proposed clinical dose; hence, the proposed levels of HPMCP are 
considered to be qualified from a reproductive toxicity point of view. 
In view of the content of HPMCP in Delamanid tablets as well as the use of process solvent during the 
manufacturing process the applicant was asked to discuss the potential for formation of specific 
phthalates asimpurities, and ensure that the amounts within the final product have been adequately 
qualified.  The applicant has evaluated the content of the specific phthalate impurities within the 
proposed medicinal product.  The applicant has confirmed that one specific impurity was not detected 
within the medicinal product (on release or during the stability studies). 
The applicant has analysed samples of placebo used for the definitive toxicity studies (such as the 
26-week rat study, the 39-week dog study and the early embryonic development study), where no 
toxicity findings were observed.  The corresponding human equivalent doses for the rat and dog are 2 
and 6-fold higher than the maximum proposed dose of one of the impurities.  The applicant has also 
presented some of the control data from the genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity studies conducted 
and the results provided suggest that the proposed dose of the impurity does not pose a risk to humans. 
It is evident that the level of the specific impurity in the drug product is fairly low and is lower than the 
doses shown to have no potential to cause general toxicity, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity in the 
non-clinical species evaluated.  In addition a second potential impurity is not detected.  The applicant 
has agreed to implement limits for these specific phthalates as requested.

The log Kow for delamanid exceeds 3, this indicates a capacity for bioaccumulation and a 
bioaccumulation study was performed in Phase II Tier B. The PEC surfacewater value (4.0 µg/L) was above 
the action limit of 0.01 µg/L, therefore, a Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis was performed. 
Delamanid is not readily biodegradable and has no significant adverse effects on aquatic organisms up 
to and even slightly above the limit of water solubility. 
An aerobic transformation study in aquatic sediment systems was performed.  Dissipation of delamanid 
from the water phases was rapid, due to degradation and adsorption to the sediment layer.  Over 10% 
of delamanid shifted to sediment, which triggered the requirement for a sediment toxicity study.  All 
metabolites detected in the sediment remained below 4.9% of the applied radioactivity.  DT90 values 
were in excess of 3 days. 
It is evident that the maximum concentrations of delamanid evaluated during the aquatic studies were 
limited by the very low solubility of the compound, which resulted in PEC:PNEC ratios that were 
artificially high. However, it is agreed that the risk to the aquatic compartment is likely to be low and no 
additional studies are required. 
The sediment toxicity study was conducted in accordance to OECD 218. No toxicity was observed and a 
NOEC of ≥ 100 mg/kg dry sediment was established. In accordance with the Questions and answers 
document on 'Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use' 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010) the results from the toxicity tests should have been recalculated into 
standard sediment with an organic carbon content of 10%, according to the following equation: 
The artificial sediment used in the toxicity study has an organic carbon content of 2.4%. The NOEC 
standard sediment is thus ≥ 417mg/kg. The PEC sediment should also have been corrected for carbon 
content. However, in any case the PEC:PNEC ratio does not indicate any risk to sediment organisms. 
A bioaccumulation study was performed according to OECD 305. Only one concentration could be tested 
due to its very low solubility, which is considered acceptable. The bioconcentration potential of 
delamanid is considered to be low. In conclusion, the applicant has conducted a series of studies to 
investigate the potential for ecotoxicity. Although some of the studies performed in order to evaluate the 
effects on the aquatic systems were limited by the solubility of delamanid, the data presented suggest 
that delamanid will not constitute a risk to the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data reveal no specific hazard for humans based on conventional studies for 
genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, but in rabbit reproductive studies, embryofetal toxicity was 
observed at maternally toxic dosages.  Delamanid /metabolites have shown to be excreted into breast 
milk. 
The metabolic profile observed in animals was qualitatively similar across the evaluated   non-clinical 
species. It was also clarified that the human metabolites identified to date have been sufficiently 
evaluated during the toxicology studies.  Nevertheless, there are remaining uncertainties regarding the 
metabolites profile in humans, as the anomaly of the results of the mass balance study in humans has 
not been adequately addressed.    
Delamanid and/or its metabolites have the potential to affect cardiac repolarisation via blockade of hERG 
potassium channels. Also, repeat-dose toxicity studies in rabbits revealed an inhibitory effect of 
delamanid and/or its metabolites on vitamin K-dependent blood clotting. 
Prior to opinion, the applicant provided results from a secondary pharmacovigilance study to evaluate 
whether delamanid and /or its metabolites have any clinically relevant effects on secondary targets. 
These results will be assessed following marketing authorisation. Finally, the applicant considered 
hypromellose phthalate not to be genotoxic. However, in accordance with ICH S2(R1) Guideline, an 
additional study will be submitted. 
In this context, at the end of the evaluation phase, an additional study was submitted in accordance with 
ICH-S2(R1) Guideline .  Results from this study will be assessed during post-authorisation. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical profile of delamanid has been sufficiently characterised.  Nevertheless, some 
data remain outstanding.  As such, the CHMP considers the following measures to address the non-clinical 
issues: 
  On the basis of the outcome of a new mass balance study, additional non-clinical studies in 
appropriate animal models may need to be conducted if disproportional metabolites are identified. 
  Additional data are necessary to investigate the following: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
The potential for delamanid to interact with secondary pharmacological targets 
The potential for delamanid and its principal metabolite to act as substrates for a series of 
transporters  
The potential for delamanid to induce CYP2B6  
The potential for the excipient HPMCP to cause genotoxicity using with the aid of an in 
vitro/in vivo rat liver unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) study

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The first two studies in man concerned administrations of the jet-milled formulation (242-03-101 and 
242-04-101). These studies indicated unsatisfactory absorption. All subsequent studies employed a 
solid dispersion formulation except for use of a gelatin capsule in the mass balance study. Almost all of 
the data were obtained by dosing with multiples of the 50 mg commercial film-coated tablets.

Pharmacokinetic data were also obtained from one of the two Phase 2 studies of Early Bactericidal 
Activity (EBA) that used the solid dispersion formulation (242-06-101) and from subjects with MDR-TB 
enrolled into the Phase 2 studies of safety and efficacy (242-07-204 and 242-07-208).  
Measurements of plasma delamanid and its three primary metabolites (DM-6704, DM-6705 and 
DM-6706) as well as 5 other metabolites (DM-6717, 6718, 6720-6722) were performed using a specific 
and sensitive HPLC-MS/MS method. This was linear over the range 1-500 ng/mL for plasma delamanid 
concentrations and 1-100 ng/mL for concentrations of the metabolites. Urinary concentrations were not 
determined due to low excretion demonstrated by chromatography and liquid scintillation counts in the 
mass balance study. 
Absorption  
The absolute oral bioavailability of delamanid in man has not been determined.  Assuming delamanid is 
not excreted unchanged in humans (based on lack of biliary excretion in non-clinical studies), the 
delamanid recovered in the faeces after an oral dose in humans would represent non-absorbed drug. On 
this basis, the observation that 52.9% to 74.8% of the dose was recovered as unchanged delamanid in 
faeces in the human mass-balance study suggests that 25% to 47% of the delamanid dose is orally 
absorbed in the fed state. 
A less than dose-proportional increase in plasma exposure to delamanid (and its primary metabolites; 
see below) was observed across the single and multiple dose studies whether administered in fed or 
fasting states. In 242-05-001 using single ascending doses of 50-400 mg almost no differences in Cmax 
or AUC0-∞ were seen between the 50 mg group and the 100 mg group. Although the Cmax and AUC0-∞ 
at 100, 200 and 400 mg increased with dose escalation, increases were less than dose-proportional.

Administration of single and multiple doses of delamanid after standard meals to Japanese male 
subjects in study 242-06-001 did not show linearity for Cmax or AUC. Mean C24h values indicated that 
delamanid had almost reached a steady state on day 10 in all dosage groups. The estimated 
accumulation ratios of C24h on Day 10 were 2.92 (±0.60), 3.82 (±0.40) and 2.63 (±0.50) for 100, 200 
and 400 mg daily doses. 
Figure 1 
Additional data on single and multiple doses were obtained in two studies in Chinese subjects 
(242-08-801-01 and 08-802-01). Following administration of single doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg to 
fasted male subjects the Cmax and AUC∞ increased with increasing dose but in a less than 
dose-proportional fashion. After multiple dosing after standard meals Cmax, AUC0-12 and AUC0-24 
increased with dose but in a less than dose-proportional fashion. Steady-state was reached after 8 days 
of dosing. The accumulation ratios and Day 10 plasma profiles are shown below.

In the UK study 242-05-101 delamanid was quantifiable in plasma until at least 72 h after single doses 
and up to at least 144 h after the last dose on day 10. After single doses the mean Cmax, AUCt, AUC24h 
and AUC∞ increased with dose in a sub-proportional manner while median Tmax and mean t½, z 
estimates remained largely unchanged with increasing dose. Following repeated dosing for 10 days both 
Cmax and AUC24h increased from Day 1 in males and females, which was consistent with the decrease 
in clearance (CL/F) estimates. However, Vz/F did not consistently follow this trend. The predicted 
accumulation ratio estimates ranged between 2.2 and 3.3. Mean Cmax showed less than the predicted 
accumulation (between 1.5 and 2.3) whereas AUC24h and C24h showed ~ 1.8-3.2-fold and 2.6-4.8-fold 
accumulation, respectively. There were no consistent differences in accumulation between males and 
females. 
Tables 5 & 6 
Study 242-08-211 provided an important comparison of three dosing regimens administered for 10 days 
in the fed state to healthy subjects in the US. Steady state was reached by Day 10 for each regimen in 
most of the subjects based on mean ± SD Day 8-10 trough plasma concentrations. On Day 10 
delamanid plasma concentrations were slightly higher (~ 1.16- and 1.18-fold) after 100 mg TID 
compared to 150 mg BID based on mean steady state AUC0-24 and Cmax values, respectively. Both the 
BID and TID regimens gave significantly higher (1.93- to 2.23-fold) exposure than 300 mg QD dosing 
based on steady-state AUC0-24h values on Day 10. 
The pre-dose (morning trough) mean ± SD plasma concentrations on Days 8, 9 and 10 after QD, BID 
and TID dosing regimens were comparable. However, the Day 11 (PK sampling day) mean trough 
concentrations were 14% to 32% higher for all the regimens, which was unexplained.

Tables 8 & 9 
Distribution 
Delamanid was bound extensively (> 99.5%) to total human serum proteins in vitro with no saturation 
of binding capacity at 5 μg/mL. Binding occurred preferably (≥ 97.3%) to albumin and human 
lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL and HDL) and to a lesser and more variable extent to human α1-acid 
glycoprotein (68.7% to 87.9%) and γ-globulin (77.6% to 97.1%). The metabolites DM-6704, DM-6705 
and DM-6706 also bound extensively (99.60%, 99.70% and 99.21%, respectively) to human serum 
proteins. In the mass balance study the whole blood to plasma ratio of radioactivity was consistent and 
indicated negligible binding of delamanid to whole blood components.  
Across the studies the derived estimates suggested a large V/F for delamanid that increased with dose 
in relation to the non-dose-proportional behaviour of the drug (i.e. decrease in F with dose). For 
example, the V/F in healthy subjects was 1100 and 1800 L after 100 mg and 200 mg BID dosing, 
respectively. Estimates of the apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz/F) and of 
Vz/F adjusted for body weight (Vz/F/BW) ranged from 936.5 to 16100 L and from 15.48 to 163.2 L/kg, 
respectively. 
Transporter studies 
Delamanid was shown not to be a substrate for P-gp transport.  
Delamanid and DM-6705, believed to be principally responsible for QTc interval prolongation, are being 
assessed as substrates for transporters relevant to absorption (including gastro-intestinal secretion), 
and to hepatic uptake and biliary excretion, considering no renal excretion is involved. Substrate studies 
were conducted on transport by P-gp for DM-6705, and on transport by BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and 
OCT1 for delamanid and DM-6705.  
Delamanid does not inhibit P-gp transport at 5 μM (this was the maximum concentration tested due to 
solubility issues), but this is approximately 15-fold lower than the estimated concentration of 74.8 μM in 
the intestinal lumen after 100 mg and therefore an effect in the gut cannot be ruled out. It is 
theoretically conceivable that the concentrations in the gut could be much higher than the 
concentrations of delamanid tested in the in vitro study.

Transporter inhibition studies were conducted with delamanid and four metabolites (DM-6704, 
DM-6705, DM-6718 and DM-6720) based on total percent circulating amount of delamanid entities and 
their potential for QTc interval prolongation. The results suggest that there is a low potential for 
inhibition of BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OCT1 and BSEP but the maximum 
concentrations tested were relatively low.  
The applicant will further address the margins between IC50 values and hepatic inlet concentrations. 
Elimination 
In study 242-05-101, concentrations of delamanid decreased in a biphasic manner in the majority of 
profiles. Across the studies the data suggested that delamanid is eliminated from plasma with a t1/2 of 
30 to 38 hours whereas the t1/2 for the metabolites ranges from 121 to 322 hours. In the mass balance 
study, peak delamanid concentrations occurred at ~ 4-8 h.  Concentrations continued to be quantifiable 
until 96 h after dosing and up to 144 h in one subject. The terminal half-life was nearly 32 h while the 
apparent clearance (CL/F) was high. 
Table 10 
After 192 h (end of collection period), urinary excretion accounted for just over 3% of the radioactivity 
dose and was still continuing. Faecal elimination accounted for almost 90% of the administered 
radioactivity within 96 h. Mean total recovery of radioactivity in urine and faeces amounted to 92.4% of 
the administered dose. Unchanged delamanid was the major radiolabeled compound in faeces (52.9% 
to 74.8% of the dose). Besides unabsorbed delamanid, DM-6705, DM-6718 and DM-6704 were also 
recovered in faeces. Delamanid was not detected in urine in the mass balance study. Also, after 10 days 
of 100 to 400 mg QD dosing in another study, less than 1% of the dose was recovered in urine as 
DM-6705 and DM-6720; unchanged delamanid was not found in urine. 
Metabolism  
Delamanid is an optically active compound (R-form) with an asymmetric carbon at the C-2 position of 
the 2,3-dihydroimidazo [2,1-b]oxazole ring. The potential for in-vivo inter-conversion to occur was 
addressed during 242-04-101 using the jet-milled formulation in which R-/S-enantiomer analysis of Day 
10 samples revealed that plasma contained 100% R-enantiomer for parent and each analyzed 
metabolite (DM-6704, DM-6705 and DM-6706). Therefore, delamanid does not undergo chiral 
inter-conversion in vivo. 
The pharmacokinetics of 8 identified metabolites of delamanid was described in several Phase 1 studies. 
The applicant concluded that delamanid metabolism in humans is generally comparable to that in animal 
species with some qualitative differences.  It was considered that single dose mass balance studies in 
animals and humans and short-term urine excretion profiles only partially describe the metabolism and

excretion profile of delamanid. The applicant proposed that the more relevant analyses concern the 
concentrations and proportions of delamanid and its metabolites found after 6 months of dosing in 
MDR-TB patients in 204/208, as described in the next section.  
Delamanid is proposed to undergo primary metabolism to DM-6705 mainly in plasma, which the 
applicant ascribes to an effect of human serum albumin (HSA). This assertion was supported by the 
observation that intrinsic clearance of delamanid in plasma (0.224 μL/min/mg of HSA) was similar to 
that in albumin (0.223 μL/min/mg).  Delamanid is stated to be immediately and rapidly metabolized into 
DM-6705 in plasma by albumin, with a disappearance/formation half-life (at 37°C) of 0.64 hours. 
Metabolism of delamanid to DM-6705 is believed to result from reaction of the amino groups in albumin 
with the 5-C of 6-nitro-2,3-dihydroimidazo[2,1-b]oxazole moiety of delamanid. Since the metabolites 
are missing the nitro group of delamanid, they are not further metabolized by HSA.  
Delamanid was minimally metabolised in human liver microsomes and 9000 g supernatant (S9) 
fractions while the three metabolites (DM-6704, DM-6705 and DM-6706) were stable in human plasma. 
In vitro, delamanid was metabolised by CYP3A4 and CYP1A1 in the presence of NADH and NADPH. 
CYP1A1 involvement was not confirmed in S9 fractions or human hepatocytes. The applicant concluded 
that only CYP3A4 makes a contribution to the metabolism of delamanid. The predominance of albumin 
vs. CYP3A4 involvement in the metabolism of delamanid is proposed to be supported by the moderate 
effect of potent CYP inducers and inhibitors on delamanid plasma exposure (see Interactions). 
As shown in the Figure below, DM-6705 is proposed to be metabolized via 3 routes - two involve 
hydrolysis (to DM-6704 and DM-6706) while the third route involves CYP3A4 oxidation to form 
DM-6720. Further biotransformation of DM-6704 and DM-6720 also occurs via CYP3A4. DM-6704 is 
further transformed into DM-6721 and DM-6722 to finally form DM-6717, while DM-6720 is further 
transformed into DM-6718. 
Figure 6 
Although the applicant has stressed the importance of the steady-state PK data in patients with MDR-TB 
over single dose studies in healthy subjects, there remains some difficulty reconciling the proposed 
metabolic pathway for delamanid with the findings of the human mass balance study (single dose 100 
mg capsule; fed state). In this study delamanid in plasma accounted for 45.6% of the total radioactivity 
(TR) at Tmax (4 h post-dose) but only 3.42% of TR AUCinf.  
Radioactivity remained well above the LLOQ at 192 h. The t1/2 of delamanid and TR were 32 and 180 
hours, respectively, reflecting the presence of metabolites with longer t1/2 values than delamanid itself.

The study report states that none of these 8 known metabolites therefore accounts for the majority of 
the circulating radioactivity.  
It is of concern that > 90% of circulating radioactivity has not been accounted for. Circulating 
metabolites present in high concentrations relative to parent drug or relative to total radioactivity are of 
concern for their potential to cause drug-drug interactions. A quantitative assessment of the 
contribution of individual metabolites is needed because so little of the total radioactivity AUC is 
explained.  On this basis, the applicant’s proposed metabolic pathway is not correct and is incomplete 
since it points to the presence of other compounds being present that predominate over the 8 
characterised metabolites in the early phases of dosing.  
As for delamanid, the metabolites show marked increases in exposure with multiple dosing and some 
also show this with food. Most seem to show less than dose-proportional kinetics and have elimination 
half-lives much longer than that of delamanid. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
In the Phase 2 study 242-07-204, delamanid was administered for 8 weeks at 100 or 200 mg twice 
daily with standard meals (550 kcal, 25% from fat) in addition to OBR to subjects with MDR-TB.  Full PK 
profiles were obtained up to 24 h post-dose on each of days 1, 14, 28 and 56.  
Tmax occurred at ~4 h after each dose.  On Day 56 mean (% CV) values for Cmax were 414 (39.9) and 
611 (35.6) ng/mL while mean AUC0-24h values were 7,925 (37.5) and 11,837 (33.6) h.ng/mL with 100 
mg and 200 mg BID dosing, respectively.  Hence AUC0-24h was 50% higher after the 200 mg vs. 100 
mg BID dose. CL/F on Day 28 and 56 was higher in the 200 mg BID dose group (e.g. on day 56 values 
were 0.597 L/h/kg vs. 0.801 L/h/kg). Plasma concentrations of delamanid reached 90% (steady state) 
of the Day 56 values by Day 14 and AUC0-24h on Day 56 was 3.4- to 3.5-fold that on Day 1.  After 
cessation of dosing, delamanid t1/2 was 38 h and median plasma concentrations were zero on Day 84.

Figure 7 
Formation of the three primary metabolites (DM-6704, 6705 and 6706) was slow. Each showed flat daily 
concentration-time profiles without a clear Cmax with a slow increase over time through Day 56. On Day 
56, delamanid represented 41% of total drug-related AUC0-24h (parent and metabolites) in plasma. 
Metabolites exceeding 10% of total drug-related exposure (AUC) were DM-6705 (17% to 18%) and 
DM-6718 (12% to 13%).  
In the 6-month open label Phase 2 study 242-07-208 all subjects commenced 100 mg BID with an 
option to receive 200 mg BID after an initial 2-week period. Dosing was to be with food but subjects were 
not hospitalised after week 2, so meals were not standardised.  Due to the variable PK sampling times 
(median [CV%] 2 [112%] h post-dose), descriptive statistics are indicative only.  
Over the 26 weeks and from Day 14 onwards median plasma delamanid concentrations ranged from 
342-408 ng/mL and from 284-540 ng/mL at 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID doses, respectively. 
Metabolite plasma concentrations reached or exceeded 90% (steady state) of the Week 26 values by 
Week 6 for DM-6704, DM-6705 and DM-6706, by Week 10 for DM-6720 and by Week 14 for the others.

The Phase 2 population PK model (i.e. built using data from 242-07-204 and 208) reported that for a 
typical MDR-TB subject (55 kg male, plasma albumin > 3.4 mg/dL), the PK parameters of delamanid 
(apparent clearance, inter-compartment clearance, central and peripheral volume) were , respectively: 
CL/F = 39.3 L/hr (95%CI: 37.5 - 41.1 L/hr), Q/F = 106 L/hr (95%CI: 92.3 - 120 L/hr), V2/F = 624 L 
(95%CI: 573 - 675 L), and V3/F = 930 L (95%CI: 843 - 1020 L).  In a typical subject on delamanid 100 
mg or 200 mg BID, steady state was reached at about 1.5 weeks with a Rac (AUC24h) of approximately 
3.1 to 3.5.  
Delamanid exposure was not affected by age, mild renal impairment or drug resistance status (MDR-TB 
vs. XDR-TB). Delamanid clearance was independent of weight, and exposure-related PK parameters 
were independent of gender.  Only hypo-albuminaemia tended to coincide with higher delamanid CL/F, 
and possibly more likely a lower F. This is believed to be possibly related to confounding pre-existing 
physiological conditions (e.g. disease status, malabsorption) in these patients. Among the extrinsic 
factors, delamanid exposure was not affected by OBR treatment or other concomitant medications. 
Actual differences in delamanid exposure across regions may reflect intrinsic ethnic differences, 
including body composition, as well as food differences. Intra-subject variability (i.e. estimated from 
proportional residual variability) was moderate (27% to 39%) and appeared to be highest in 208, 
reflecting primarily outpatient conditions and therefore more variable food intakes. The regional 
differences were on average within the range of the 50% difference in exposure observed between the 
delamanid 100 and 200 mg BID doses, both of which were well tolerated. In addition, post hoc 
simulations at the 100 mg BID dose across regions in both in-patients and out-patients indicated that 
delamanid AUC in the European population exceeded 3,500-5500 ng*h/mL in 100% of the population. 
The relative bioavailability of the evening dose was 45% (95% CI: 37% to 52%) higher than the 
morning dose and 19% (95% CI: 16% to 21%) higher in the non-hospitalised vs. hospitalised setting 
possibly due to differences in food composition/amount associated with these different settings. 
For 100 mg BID with standard meals the Phase 2 POP-PK model predicted the lowest plasma AUC0-24h 
= 6395 h*ng/mL during steady-state for a female, non-Asian, hospitalized patient and the highest 
plasma exposure AUC0-24h =11465 h*ng/mL for a North-East Asian male out-patient with MDR-TB 
under OBR therapy. Corresponding estimates for 200 mg BID were 9129 h*ng/mL for female non-Asian 
hospitalized patients and 16306 h*ng/mL for a North-East Asian female out-patient with MD-TB under 
OBR therapy. 
Special populations 
In the dataset used to derive the Phase 2 population PK model there were 60 (14.8%) subjects with mild 
(CrCLN < 80 mL/min/[1.73 m2]) and 4 with moderate renal impairment (CrCLN < 50 mL/min/[1.73 
m2]). There was no impact of mild to moderate renal impairment on delamanid and DM-6705 
exposures. DM-6705 plasma concentrations in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on Day 
56 in study 204 indicated a trend towards slightly higher DM-6705 plasma exposure in patients with mild 
renal impairment that remained well within the variability in exposure. The DM-6705 exposure in 
patients with moderate renal impairment after delamanid 100 mg BID remained well within that 
observed after delamanid 200 mg BID.   
No hepatic impaired subjects were enrolled but 9 had ALT > 56 U/L, 41 had AST > 40 U/L, 3 had AST > 
80 U/L and 7 had total bilirubin > 1 mg/dL. Hepatic impairment may have an influence on DM-6705 
exposure but the applicant concluded from the DDI study with Kaletra (see below) that a major loss of 
CYP3A4 activity would not result in concentrations > those observed with 200 mg BID in 204/208. In 
trials 204/208 a trend towards slightly lower DM-6705 concentrations in hypoalbuminaemic patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014

was observed. The lack of data on patients with severe hepatic impairment has been reflected in the 
proposed Product Information. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
See Distribution for details of completed transporter studies and Metabolism for what is known and/or 
proposed to be the mode of biotransformation of delamanid and its metabolites.  
When delamanid was co-administered with P-gp inhibitors cyclosporin A or verapamil HCl to rats the 
Cmax was unchanged but the AUC was slightly increased. The slight increase in AUC was not considered 
to be caused by inhibition of P-gp since Cmax was not affected and delamanid was not shown to be 
transported by P-gp in a study with human MDR1-expressing cell monolayers. 
Factors that may influence metabolism by albumin are yet unknown. In study 204 no patient had 
hyperalbuminaemia and 30.6% had hypoalbuminaemia. No clinically relevant changes in delamanid and 
DM-6705 plasma concentrations occurred in MDR-TB patients with hypoalbuminaemia vs. those with 
normal albumin levels. The applicant does not expect interactions to occur via interference with 
metabolism by albumin.   
Regarding interactions at the level of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes: 
-  Delamanid did not induce human CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5 and mRNA levels in fresh 
primary cultures of hepatocytes at 0.1, 1 and 10 μmol/L. At 100 μmol/L there was little possibility 
for mechanism-based inhibition by delamanid on the CYP isoforms tested (CYP1A1/2, CYP2A6, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 [testosterone, midazolam]).  
-  DM-6704 inhibited CYP2B6, CYP2C8/9 and CYP2C19 activities with IC50 values ranging from 25.2 
to 89.4 μmol/L.  
-  DM-6705 inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 (nifedipine 
oxidation) and CYP3A4 (testosterone 6β-hydroxylation) activities with IC50 values ranging from 
18.3 to 87.5 μmol/L.  
-  DM-6706 inhibited CYP2B6, CYP2C8/9, and CYP2C19 activities with IC50 values ranging from 
32.8 to 90.6 μmol/L. 
-  DM-6720 inhibited CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP3A4 (testosterone 6 β-hydroxylation) with IC50 values 
ranging from 10.9 to 42.3 μmol/L.  
-  DM-6718 had little inhibitory potency against CYPs (IC50 > 100 μmol/L).  
Based on the steady-state Cmax after delamanid 200 mg BID in humans and the Ki values, the 
calculated I/Ki values for the metabolites (DM-6704, DM-6705, DM-6706, DM-6718, and DM-6720) 
indicate that the likelihood for inhibition potential is remote (I/Ki < 0.1). No inhibition was observed with 
delamanid so no IC50 or Ki was determined. These in-vitro results indicated that enzyme inhibition in 
vivo with specific probe substrates can be excluded for delamanid and the metabolites that were tested.  
The worst case scenario for CYP3A4 induction was assessed in a 15 day study with Rifater 
(isoniazid/rifampicin/pyrazinamide) + ethambutol (242-06-202).  Ethambutol and Rifater were 
administered before and delamanid after a standard breakfast. Subjects were genotyped for CYP2C9, 
CYP 2C19 and N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT-2).  
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 40/140 
 
 
  
  
Co-administration with Rifater reduced plasma exposure to delamanid by 47% and also decreased 
steady state plasma concentrations of DM-6704, DM-6705, DM-6706, DM-6717, DM-6721 and DM-6722 
from 15 to 45%.  
Table 13 
Figure 8 
By applying the same ratios to the Day 56 plasma levels observed in patients with MDR-TB in study 204 
the applicant concluded that co-administration of delamanid with a strong inducer of CYP3A4 would not 
result in a significant effect on safety or efficacy. It is not really expected that rifampicin and its 
analogues would be used for the treatment of MDR-TB. However, the value of the data is more related 
to its predictive capacity for co-administration with other strong inducers. On this basis, there is 
sufficient concern at this stage and in light of lack of information to prohibit co-administration of strong 
inducers of CYP3A4 with delamanid (noted as a contra-indication, section 4.3 of proposed SmPC). 
The metabolite/parent AUC ratios with and without Rifater + EMB showed that the ratio was unchanged 
for DM-6704 (suggestive of mainly decreased absorption) but modestly increased for DM-6705 (0.26 vs. 
0.19) and DM-6720 (0.058 vs. 0.028) (suggestive of the presence of induced metabolism). Hence, in 
addition to an effect on CYP3A4 metabolism decreased absorption possibly due to the number of tablets 
(15) taken, may have occurred.  
Co-administration with delamanid significantly increased steady state plasma concentrations of 
ethambutol by approximately 25%. The individual ethambutol PK profiles and the slightly more 
pronounced change in Cmax than in AUC suggested slightly improved absorption rather than decreased 
elimination of ethambutol.  Ethambutol bioavailability has been shown to be absorption-dependent, as 
antacids are known to decrease ethambutol bioavailability.  
The underlying reasons are unclear considering the limited information on ethambutol metabolism and 
considering that delamanid and related metabolites do not show CYP isoform inhibition. This minor 
change in exposure was considered not to be relevant.

The report states that co-administration with delamanid did not significantly alter steady state 
plasma concentrations of rifampicin. The GMRs were 1.07 (90% CI 0.69, 1.67) for AUCt and 1.14 
(0.78, 1.68) for Cmax. The tables of 25-desactyl rifampicin data show slightly higher plasma 
levels on dosing with delamanid but no formal analysis was planned.  
-  When PK data for subjects with a given NAT-2 genotype were compared, co-administration with 
delamanid did not appear to alter isoniazid PK.  
-  Co-administration with delamanid did not significantly alter steady state plasma concentrations of 
pyrazinamide. The GMRs (90% CI) were 1.07 (0.89, 1.30) for AUCt and 1.04 (0.88, 1.24) for 
Cmax.  
The worst case scenario for CYP3A4 inhibition was assessed in the 14-day DDI study with 
lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra). In 242-07-209 delamanid steady state was reached by Day 14 regardless 
of co-administered anti-HIV agents based on pre-dose plasma concentrations but none of the 
metabolites had reached steady state on this day. 
Table 14 
-  Kaletra slightly increased delamanid steady-state AUC (ratio 1.22). Marginally higher 
steady-state exposure of DM-6704 (ratio 1.75) and DM-6705 (ratio 1.28) was observed, while no 
effect occurred on DM-6720 (ratio 1.03) exposure. The limited impact of ritonavir was deemed 
compatible with the predominant contribution of HSA to delamanid metabolism and formation of 
DM-6705 and alternative routes (hydrolysis) in the biotransformation of DM-6705 into DM-6704 
and DM-6706. The more pronounced increase in DM-6704 was consistent with its persistent 
formation through hydrolysis and is indicative of CYP3A4 being solely responsible for its 
disappearance.  
- 
The applicant further assessed the impact of CYP3A4 inhibition by applying the effect factors to 
the Day 56 data obtained from patients in study 204 and concluded that there was no need for 
dose adjustment when delamanid is given with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. However, the effect 
on DM6705 and the risk of QTc prolongation is considered to be a concern that merits a warning 
in the proposed Product information. 
- 
- 
Plasma concentrations were unaffected (DM-6704 and 6706) or lower (DM-6705) on 
co-administration with tenofovir (a CYP1A2 inhibitor).  
Plasma concentrations of tenofovir, ritonavir and lopinavir were considered to be not greatly 
affected by co-administration with delamanid over 14 days. Tenofovir GMC ratios (90% CI) were 
0.89 (0.77, 1.04) for Cmax and 0.91 (0.78, 1.07) for AUCt, lopinavir ratios were 1.05 (0.88, 1.25)

and 1.04 (0.86, 1.24) and ritonavir ratios were 0.96 (0.66, 1.4) and 1.03 (0.77, 1.37), 
respectively. 
In 242-08-212 subjects received either efavirenz 600 mg QD for 10 days (at 20.00 h and 2 h post-food) 
or delamanid 100 mg BID without (7 days) and then with (10 days) efavirenz 600 mg QD. Delamanid 
was given at 08.00 and 18.00 within 30 minutes of a standard meal.  
Efavirenz exposure was described as being comparable when given alone or with delamanid (Cmax GMR 
0.94 [0.75, 1.17]; AUCt GMR 0.94 [0.72, 1.23]. Trough concentrations were also comparable although 
there was a greater spread of values on co-administration. One subject per group with 3 to 4 times 
higher efavirenz exposure had *6/*6 and *6/*15 alleles, which are predictive for considerably reduced 
CYP2B6 enzyme activity. In addition, the 11 subjects with *1/*6 alleles tended to show higher efavirenz 
exposure vs. those genotyped as *1/*1 alleles. Comparisons within each CYP2B6* genotype did not 
reveal any overt difference in exposure on co-administration. 
Delamanid plasma exposure was comparable when given alone or with efavirenz and steady state was 
reached after 7 days of administration. The GMRs were 0.995 (0.93, 1.07) for Cmax and 0.97 (0.91, 
1.03) for AUCt. Trough levels were slightly lower on co-administration but with a similar spread. Plasma 
concentrations of the three primary metabolites were higher on co-administration, especially for 
DM-6705 and 6706. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Delamanid is an inhibitor of mycolic acid biosynthesis. It is described as a pro-drug that undergoes 
reductive metabolism by M. tuberculosis to produce an active free radical. Specifically, it was reported to 
exert anti-TB activity in M. bovis through bioreductive activation of an aromatic nitro group that is 
possibly mediated via the F420 coenzyme system. These enzymes have been reported in other 
mycobacteria including M. tuberculosis and M. africanum with near 100% homology.  
Delamanid inhibited methoxy-mycolic and keto-mycolic acid synthesis in M. bovis BCG with IC50 values 
of 0.036 and 0.021 µg/mL but the IC50 for α-mycolic acid was > 0.25 µg/mL.  While isoniazid also 
inhibits mycolic acid synthesis it has been reported to inhibit mainly the enoyl-ACP reductase InhA-NDA 
complex. Since the in-vitro activity of delamanid was unaffected by mechanisms conferring resistance to 
isoniazid it has been deduced that the precise mechanism of mycolic acid synthesis inhibition differs 
between the two agents. 
Primary pharmacology 
In-vitro susceptibility testing of Mycobacteria mostly employed agar dilution with 14 days incubation at 
370C. The agar proportion method generally gave MICs up to 4-fold lower than the agar dilution method. 
There was an inoculum effect (higher MICs of delamanid) detected at > 107 cfu/ml. Higher MICs of 
delamanid were also observed at pH >7 vs. pH 6-7. A comparison of MICs determined using agar dilution 
against M. tuberculosis showed the following for delamanid in comparison (on a wt/wt basis only) with 
primary anti-TB agents. 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 43/140 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Table 15 
Using the agar dilution method the MICs of delamanid for 67 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis ranged 
from 0.006 to 0.024 μg/mL. The in-vitro activity of delamanid was unaffected in the presence of 
mechanisms conferring resistance to one or more other anti-TB agents. For example, against 24 M. 
tuberculosis MICs of delamanid determined using the agar proportion method ranged from ≤ 0.00625 to 
0.0125 μg/mL regardless of whether strains were classified as drug-sensitive, MDR or XDR. 
The in-vitro activity of delamanid against 17 non-tuberculous Mycobacterium strains (all ATCC) 
determined by the agar (7H11) dilution method showed that: 
-  Delamanid MIC against M. kansasii, M. shimoidei, M. xenopi and M. marinum was 0.024 μg/mL.   
- 
For M. avium, M. intracellulare, M. kansasii ATCC 12478, M. scrofulaceum, M. malmoense, M. 
simiae and M. ulcerans the MICs were in the range 0.5 -1.56 μg/mL 
-  MICs were > 100 μg/mL against M. smegmatis, M. aurum, M. szulgai, M. fortuitum and M. 
chelonae  
-  Against M. africanum ATCC 25420 the MIC delamanid was comparable to M. tuberculosis.  
- 
For single strains of sub-species of the MTB-complex including M. pinnipedii (ATCC BAA-688), M. 
microti (ATCC19422 & 11152), M. caprae (ATCC BAA-824) and M. bovis (ATCC BAA-935) the 
delamanid MICs were similar to those for M. tuberculosis.   
The MICs of the primary metabolites of delamanid (DM-6704, 6705 and 6706) against 10 M. tuberculosis 
strains, including some resistant to currently used anti-TB drugs, was determined using the agar dilution 
method. These metabolites showed poor activity with MICs that ranged from 6.25 to 50 μg/mL. For the 
other five metabolites (i.e. DM-6717, 6718, 6720, 6721 and 6722) all MICs were ≥ 12.5 μg/mL. Against 
a range of non-Mycobacterial species the MIC of delamanid was > 100 μg/mL. MICs of DM-6704, 
DM-6705 and 6706 were 12.5 - > 100 μg/mL, 6.25 to > 100 μg/mL and 50 to > 100 μg/mL, 
respectively.  
Delamanid showed no antagonistic activity with ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampicin and streptomycin. 
Combination with these agents was classified as synergistic or partially synergistic for 88.9%, 44.4%, 
92.6% and 25.9%, respectively, of all tested strains. 
Against M. bovis BCG Tokyo under aerobic conditions and in liquid culture with incubation at 37°C 
delamanid showed bactericidal effects after 3 and 7 days at 0.016, 0.080 and 0.40 μg/mL but not at 
0.0032 μg/mL. At 0.016 μg/mL delamanid gave a 3-log reduction in CFU on day 3 and a 4-log reduction 
in CFU on day 7. Also, delamanid showed bactericidal activity [IC90 0.215 μg/mL, 95% CI 0.178 to

0.261 μg/mL] against intracellular M. tuberculosis (H37Rv strain) and against the same strain in primary 
human macrophages. Against dormant M. bovis BCG Tokyo delamanid exhibited dose-dependent 
bactericidal activity that was significant at concentrations ≥ 0.4 μg/mL. 
Regarding clinical isolates, initially the applicant did not conduct any susceptibility testing against 
delamanid at baseline in study 204. There is an ongoing effort to retrieve, identify and perform 
susceptibility testing for as many baseline isolates as possible form study 204. There are inadequate 
data available during the procedure to support setting of breakpoints by EUCAST.  
In “delamanid-resistant” M. bovis BCG Tokyo (i.e. with much higher than usual MICs), mutations were 
identified in coenzyme F420 genes fgd, Rv3547, fbiA, fbiB and fbiC, based on HPLC elution profiles and 
DNA sequencing. When delamanid-resistant M. bovis BCG Tokyo strains were complemented with 
wild-type genes fgd, Rv3547, fbiA, fbiB, fbiC or both fbiA and fbiB susceptibility was restored (MICs 
0.006 to 0.024 μg/mL). These results suggest that mutation in one of the 5 coenzyme F420 genes is the 
mechanism for resistance of M. bovis BCG against delamanid. 
Investigation of clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis that were “resistant” to delamanid (i.e. growth on 
solid media containing delamanid at 200 ng/mL) showed that the mechanism of resistance was 
exclusively due to lack of conversion of delamanid to the desnitro-imidazooxazole form by the bacilli. 
Specifically, clinical isolates from study 208 that showed high MICs of delamanid have been found to 
contain functional mutations of any of the 5 genes (Rv3547, FGD, FbiA, FbiB and FbiC), resulting in the 
inability of the bacilli to convert delamanid to the desnitroimidazooxazole. Four (2 from EU) out of 213 
(49 from EU) patients had isolates that were confirmed to develop delamanid resistance during the 
6-months’ treatment period. All of these patients were on effective mono-therapy with delamanid or 
with only the addition of a weak, bacteriostatic drug to which the patient’s isolate was susceptible. 
The spontaneous resistant rate in H37Rv for delamanid is 6.44 x 10-6 – 4.19 x 10-5, which is very 
similar to that of isoniazid: 1.74 x 10-5 – 3.13 x 10-5. Therefore, based on the experience with isoniazid, 
the applicant expects that the rate of emergence of resistance to delamanid will be high unless it is 
paired with a potent bactericidal drug or multiple bacteriostatic or weakly bactericidal drugs. 
Secondary pharmacology 
In stably transfected HEK293 cells delamanid (0.03 to 3 μmol/L) showed increasing inhibition potential 
(19.6% to 35.4%) without evidence of a dose-response and hence no IC50 was reported. DM-6705 
showed the highest inhibitory potential (IC50 of 0.0822 μmol/L) followed by DM-6704 (IC50 of 1.60 
μmol/L), while DM-6706 showed no significant effect on hERG at 3 μmol/L.  
In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells stably expressing hERG channel the inhibition rate for 
delamanid at 1 μmol/L (0.5 μg/mL) was 7.9% vs. the DMSO vehicle control. It was considered that any 
of delamanid (no IC50), DM-6704 (IC50 1.6 µM), DM-6705 (IC50 0.082 µM) and DM-6720 (IC50 1 µM) 
could possibly contribute to QTc prolongation. Their steady-state Cmax total plasma concentrations in 
patients with MDR-TB in 204/208 were 0.33, 0.15 and 0.13 μmol/L after 100 mg BID and 0.50, 0.20 and 
0.18 after 200 mg BID. The inhibition rates for DM-6704, 6720 and 6705 at 1 μmol/L vs. control were 
23.7%, 54.9% and 90.6%, respectively. The other 5 metabolites did not affect hERG current at 1 
μmol/L.  
A clinical TQT study was not performed but ECG data were obtained in Phase 2 studies. In the Phase 2 
study of 8 weeks delamanid vs. placebo (242-07-204), ECGs were measured at baseline and at each PK 
sampling time (except for pre-dose) on the PK visit days and QTcF and QTcB values were generated. 
Progressive increase in QTc intervals over time occurred during delamanid treatment with higher values

for QTcF vs. QTcB. For the PK/PD analysis only the records where both QTc and PK data were available 
were used. The applicant conducted a full dataset analysis and a restricted dataset analysis after 
exclusion of all the data collected in two sites in Peru (sites 15 and 16). Day 56 Cmax values were used 
to compute predictions for QTc change from baseline.  
The predicted placebo-adjusted ΔQTcF values were higher than the corresponding predicted 
placebo-adjusted ΔQTcB values. The highest placebo-adjusted ΔQTcF value was predicted for DM-6705 
Cmax. The PK/PD analysis for change in QTc from baseline (ΔQTcF and ΔQTcB) for delamanid, DM-6704, 
DM-6705 and DM-6720 indicated that the linear models for delamanid and DM-6704 overestimated the 
effect at high concentrations, while for DM-6705 and DM-6720 the regression lines went through the 
observed points. DM-6705 concentrations were identified as a surrogate marker for QTc prolongation 
since plasma levels predicted the highest change in QTcF at Cmax. The highest DM-6705 concentrations 
were observed on Day 56 and the QTc prolongation reversed after drug was discontinued on this day.  
Figures 9 & 10 
Based on the full dataset during delamanid administration for 2 months, the highest mean 
placebo-adjusted ΔQTcF [upper 95% CI] values were 14.2 ms [15.4 ms] for a DM-6705 Cmax of 151 
ng/mL (delamanid 100 mg BID) and 22.0 ms [23.8 ms] for a DM-6705 Cmax of 233 ng/mL (200 mg 
BID). 
The time course of QTcF and ΔQTcF and PK (delamanid, DM-6704, DM-6705 and DM-6720) in 
242-07-208 indicated that DM-6705 and QTcF values were essentially unchanged from Week 10 
onwards. The mean change from baseline was 3.0 to 6.1 ms for delamanid 100 mg BID from Week 2 to 
Week 26 compared to 9.4 to 13.9 ms in the 200 mg BID group.

Further analysis of QTc data from study 204 revealed a strong association between hypoalbuminaemia 
and prolongation of the QtC interval. There was no correlation found between serum albumin and QTc in 
the placebo groups.   
Patients on treatment with delamanid (+OBR) who had low albumin (< 3.4 mg/dL) significantly more 
often experienced ΔQTcF > 60 ms as compared to patients on delamanid with normal albumin; this 
difference was not observed in patients on placebo. At each time point of the study, the median ΔQTcF 
was higher in patients on delamanid treatment who had a low albumin level at baseline. When the 
frequency of patients with ΔQTcF above 60 ms was stratified by albumin and ΔQTcF at each visit, it was 
also apparent that patients with low albumin who were treated with delamanid more often experienced 
pronounced QTc prolongation. Based on the performed sub-analysis, there seems to be a 6- to 8-fold 
higher risk for a patient with a baseline albumin level <3.4 mg/dL to develop ΔQTcF exceeding 60 ms; 
the same elevation of the risk is seen if Day 56 albumin levels are used as the cut-off.  
Over time, the mean ΔQTcF observed in patients with a low baseline albumin level treated with 
delamanid ranges between 20 ms and 25 ms as compared to 15 ms to 20 ms in patients with albumin 
>3.4 mg/dL. 
The underlying mechanism for the observed association between hypoalbuminaemia and QTc 
prolongation in patients treated with delamanid is not clearly understood; the fraction of unbound drug 
(or metabolite), the severity of the disease or other yet unknown factors may be contributing. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Taking into account the unresolved matter of the inadequate metabolic profiling in the human 
mass-balance study, there are remaining uncertainties regarding delamanid and metabolite PK, and 
hence the risk for drug-drug interactions to occur, as well as the implications for the total effect on QTc.  
This uncertainty will be further addressed in a new mass balance study to investigate and to profile 
potential reactive metabolites. 
Further on, sparse sampling in ongoing phase 3 trial (213) is not adequate to document the metabolic 
fate of delamanid or the potential for DDIs affecting plasma concentrations of delamanid to occur. 
Hence, detailed characterisation of patient plasma profiles to further assist in exploring circulating 
delamanid-associated molecules is imperative. 
Regarding the potential effects of hepatic insufficiency on the fate of delamanid, more data are required 
on patients with MDR-TB and hepatic impairment during the course of study 213.  Likewise, the 
applicant should obtain more data by allowing enrolment of patients with renal insufficiency into study 
213. 
Delamanid has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance and it is truly essential that it is 
co-administered with other agents predicted to be active. Study 213 should include collection of full 
delamanid susceptibility data for baseline isolates from all patients. Additional susceptibility test data 
(with MIC determination) from EU reference laboratories to document the rate of resistance in 
circulating isolates, including those from EU countries is further required. 
Finally, the data regarding the relationship between hypo-albuminaemia and risk of QTc prolongation is 
important to communicate to healthcare professionals.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considers the following measures to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
-  A new human mass balance study should be carried out to investigate and profile potential 
reactive metabolites. The major elimination pathways of delamanid should be clarified and 
enzymes/transport proteins involved in major in vivo pathways should be identified in vitro. If 
there are reactive metabolites of likely safety importance, the major formation and elimination 
pathways of these metabolites, and the main enzymes/transporters involved should be identified. 
- 
- 
The applicant should address the margins between IC 50 values and hepatic inlet concentrations 
For ongoing study 213, the sponsor was asked to assess the feasibility of a protocol revision 
evaluated  
to include collection of full delamanid susceptibility data for baseline isolates from all 
patients and to provide the data in the Study Report for the planned interim analysis; 
to monitor both PK and ECG data at frequent intervals in patients with mild to moderate 
hepatic or renal insufficiency, subject to the feasibility of modifying the protocol and the 
agreement by competent authorities for including these populations.  
- 
The applicant should provide further details of the European drug susceptibility testing system 
once these are known, including a timetable for the provision of results. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Subjects enrolled into the two EBA studies had fully susceptible M. tuberculosis. Both studies employed 
once daily dosing of delamanid but only the second used the solid dispersion formulation as follows:

Delamanid was administered once daily after a standard breakfast for 14 days. Rifafour e-275 tablets 
were administered once daily in the fasting state (2-5 tablets per day according to body weight).  
The primary efficacy analysis focused on the Early Slopes, the Late Slopes and AUClog10 bacteria vs. 
time (AUC0-14). The 200 mg delamanid dose achieved a mean change point in regression slope after 
5.8 days, followed by the 300 mg dose with a mean change point at 6.8 days. The 400 mg group reached

Page 48/140 
 
 
 
 
  
  
a mean change point after 7.8 days and the 100 mg group after 8.4 days. The mean AUC0-14 of log10 
bacterial counts was highest for the 300 mg group (8.485) followed by 200 mg (7.672), 400 mg (2.703) 
and 100 mg (2.576). Similar findings applied to the ITT population.  
All delamanid treatment groups had a greater negative slope (decline in log10 CFU/mL) in their 
respective earlier phase (prior to the regression split point being reached) than in the later phase. The 
largest average decrease in log10 CFU/mL (mean Early Slope of -0.15) was observed with 200 mg, for 
which the mean Late Slope was -0.09. The exploratory p-values showed no significant difference in 
either Early or Late Slope across treatment groups.  
The actual counts were very variable at baseline with no trend in change from baseline values with dose. 
Table 17 
The delamanid treatment groups had lower EBA (0-2) and Slope (0-14) values vs. standard therapy. The 
mean Baseline Time to Culture Positivity for the delamanid groups ranged from 4.0 days (100 mg) to 4.5 
days (400 mg) vs. 5.0 days with standard therapy. The mean Endpoint Time to Culture Positivity for the 
delamanid groups ranged from 4.2 days (100 mg) to 5.7 days (200 mg) vs. 7.3 days for standard 
therapy. 
Overall, the applicant concluded that in the 14-day treatment period a decline of ≥ 0.9 log10CFU/mL 
sputum occurred i.e. with an average EBA disappearance rate of 0.040 ± 0.056 log10CFU/mL 
sputum/day. 
No relationship between EBA and dose was observed but the applicant concluded there was an 
association between AUC24h and maximum change in log10CFU/mL in sputum on Day 14.

Figure 11 
The ROC analysis revealed that an AUC24h of 3500 ng.h/mL at steady state (Day 14) was an appropriate 
cut-off for CFU count reduction. Modelling from a Phase I study of QD, BID and TID dosing showed that 
>85% of subjects on 100 mg BID and >95% on 200 mg BID would achieve an AUC of at least 4000 
ng.h/mL. Based on these clinical findings and available non-clinical data the dose regimens 100 mg and 
200 mg BID were selected for development. 
In the Phase 2 studies in MDR-TB (242-07-204 and 208) over 95% of subjects treated with 100 mg BID 
for up to 6 months had delamanid steady-state exposure that exceeded an AUC24h of 3500 ng.h/mL. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
- 
- 
- 
The pivotal study in this application is the Phase 2 study 242-07-204, which compared 
delamanid 100 mg or 200 mg BID with placebo over 8 weeks only. 
The same study had a follow-on open-label phase designated as study 242-07-208 from which 
the complete data were provided during the procedure. Participation was voluntary. 
There was a further follow-on study (242-10-116) to capture long term outcome at 24 months. 
The complete data were provided during the procedure. Participation was voluntary and was 
independent of participation in 208 or having documented MDR-TB at baseline.  
-  Study 242-08-210 was conducted in 30 subjects with MDR TB refractory to OBR after 9 months.  
- 
There is an ongoing Phase 3 study (242-09-213), expected to report initially (SCC at 6 months) 
in 2014.

A Multi-center, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 2 Trial to Evaluate the 
Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Doses of OPC−67683 in Patients with 
Pulmonary Sputum Culture-Positive, Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The critical inclusion criteria were as follows: 
Table 18 
The study excluded subjects with ECG abnormalities or laboratory tests indicating renal or hepatic 
dysfunction. HIV-infected subjects were enrolled if they were not on or requiring ART according to the 
guidance operative at the time the study was initiated.  
Treatments 
The study comprised three periods: 
Pre-treatment Period (Days −12 to −1) for screening and establishing baseline culture status 
Treatment Period (Days 1 to 56) for BID administration of delamanid or placebo plus OBR 
Post-treatment Period (Days 57 to 84) for OBR to all subjects 
All subjects were hospitalised for the duration of the Treatment Period. At the discretion of the 
investigator, subjects could be discharged from the hospital on Day 57. 
Subjects were randomised to one of the following treatments in a 1:1:1 ratio: 
Delamanid 100 mg BID + OBR 
Delamanid 200 mg BID + OBR 
Placebo + OBR

Treatment allocation was stratified by extent of pulmonary TB (i.e. cavitation) so that an equal number 
of subjects with cavities visible on chest radiograph were allocated to each treatment group. 
Delamanid 50 mg tablets (lot numbers 07F91A050A, 07F91A050B, 07F91A050C) and matching placebo 
tablets were administered under fed conditions in the morning and evening within 30 minutes of the 
start of a meal (minimum of 550 calories with at least 25% from fat). The OBR for each subject was 
selected by the site’s lead investigator, who could change the OBR as necessary based on tolerability or 
DST results at any time during the study. The OBR was to be selected in accordance with the WHO 
Guidelines for the Programmatic Management of Drug-resistant TB. If a subject’s organism was 
resistant to a higher number of second-line anti-TB medications or the subject had problems tolerating 
some of the second-line medications the OBR could consist of < 4 medications. Note that moxifloxacin 
was not allowed in any OBR in this study due to the QTc effects. 
After completion of 56 days of delamanid + OBR all subjects were to continue treatment with OBR alone. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the safety, efficacy and PK of 2 doses of delamanid (100 mg BID 
and 200 mg BID) administered orally for 56 consecutive days + OBR vs. placebo + OBR to subjects with 
pulmonary, sputum-culture-positive MDR-TB. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of the subset of MITT subjects (sputum culture 
positive for MDR-TB at baseline) that achieved SCC using the MGIT system by Day 57. The time to SCC 
was based on the collection of the first sputum specimen with MGIT culture negative for growth of MTB 
that was followed by at least one additional sputum specimen with no MTB growth in MGIT at least 27 
days after the first negative specimen and not followed by any sputum specimens with MGIT growth of 
MTB at any point during the remainder of the 84 day study period. 
Morning sputum specimens were to be collected on Day −1, Day 1 and Days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50 
and on the day after stopping delamanid/placebo (57) for culture using the MGIT system and solid 
media. Spot sputum sampling was to be conducted prior to the morning meal whenever possible on 
Days 63, 70, 77 and 84 during the Post-treatment Period. Induction of sputum was used as needed. The 
Company states that standardised mycobacterial methods were used (as per CLSI) but the 
“comprehensive laboratory manual” was not included in the dossier. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included analyses of SCC based on solid culture media and other 
measures of anti-mycobacterial effect. 
Sample size 
Relying largely on microbiological data using solid culture media, it was estimated that adding 
delamanid would result in 60% of subjects achieving SCC after 56 days of treatment compared with 
40% on OBR alone. Based on this effect size, a study with 120 fully evaluable subjects per treatment 
arm would have 80% power to detect this 20% treatment difference at type I error = 0.025 (2-sided) 
using a 2-sample Chi-square test. The study finally randomised a total of 481 subjects to insure that at 
least 360 subjects would have full data available for the primary efficacy analysis.

Randomisation 
This was accomplished by IWRS and was stratified by cavitations on chest radiograph. The 
randomisation ratio was maintained for the study as a whole, but not necessarily within each site. 
Blinding (masking) 
A double blind design was maintained. The DSMB and an independent unblinded DSMB support 
statistician were unblinded to study treatment as needed in order to adequately assess safety issues. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations were defined as: 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) - all randomised who received a dose of IMP 
Modified Intent-to-treat (MITT) - all subjects who had sputum cultures positive for MDR-TB at baseline 
(Day −1 and/or Day 1) using the MGIT system based on results of local laboratories  
Per Protocol (PP) - the subset of the MITT population that adhered to the protocol up to Day 84 
Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis sought to ascertain whether delamanid at either dose tested was superior 
to placebo when given with OBR during early treatment based on proportions in the MITT population 
with SCC at Day 57. The study was not powered to compare the two delamanid regimens. In this primary 
analysis the proportions with SCC in each of the delamanid groups vs. placebo group were compared 
using the CMH test by randomisation strata (cavitation/no cavitation). 
Results 
Recruitment 
Study 242-07-204 was initiated in May 2008 and enrolled 481 subjects across 17 sites in 9 countries.  
The numbers enrolled by site are shown below; note the predominance of site 001 in Manila (150/481), 
which was the only SE Asia regional site.

Participant flow 
Of the 481 subjects enrolled 90% (434/481) completed 242-07-04. Percentages that discontinued were 
evenly distributed across groups. The most common reason for discontinuation was subject withdrawal 
of consent. The majority of subjects were analysed for efficacy using the MGIT system (402/481, 
83.6%) and/or using solid culture media (347/481, 72.1%).

Conduct of the study 
A particular issue regarding microbiology data was the report of false positive results in MGIT at sites 
001 (66 patients) and 009 (16 patients). Only cultures from these sites that were definitively identified 
as MTB were reported as such in the database. Site 009 was placed on temporary hold due to GCP 
compliance issues and it was later decided that no further subjects should be enrolled. Some 
microbiology data from this site were considered questionable due to the GCP compliance issues, so a 
sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was performed without the microbiology data from 
Site 009. 
Baseline data 
The treatment groups were well balanced in terms of baseline characteristics. About two thirds were 
male, ~ one quarter was of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and just over half were described as Asian. The age 
range was from 18-63 years. 
All subjects had an abnormal chest radiograph consistent with the diagnosis of TB at baseline. More than 
two-thirds had cavitation and 24% had bilateral cavitation. Rates of signs and symptoms were 
comparable between treatment groups except for haemoptysis, which was reported by 32.9% and 
37.5% in the delamanid groups vs. 46.9% in the placebo group.  
Overall, 433/481 (90.0%) had received prior treatment for TB for at least 30 days, including 243/481 
(50.5%) who had been treated with a first-line regimen only. At randomization major changes to 
treatment mostly involved drugs being added rather than stopped. The highest proportion of patients 
had no change in regimen content with respect to injectables, fluoroquinolones or pyrazinamide (range 
40.3 - 60.4% in each OBR class). During the study, the majority (51%) of patients had no change to 
their OBR with respect to these drug groups (72% for injectables; 83.8% for fluoroquinolones; 38.8% 
for pyrazinamide).  
Overall, 63.6% of Day 1 sputum specimens were positive for MTB complex using both MGIT and solid 
culture media, 15.8% were negative in both, 17.3% were positive using MGIT and negative using solid 
culture media while 3.1% were negative using MGIT and positive using solid culture media. Isolates 
were not speciated within the MTB complex.  
Day 1 susceptibility test results were available for MTB isolated from 399/481 subjects enrolled. It was 
later clarified that susceptibility testing was only performed for isolates from MGIT and not from solid 
culture. It was established that testing susceptibility to delamanid was not performed at baseline in this 
study but it remains possible that some data could be provided assuming that the strains have been 
deposited in the applicant’s NJ repository. There were 27/399 isolates susceptible to isoniazid and/or 
rifampicin, with 5 missing results for each drug. Rates for other first and second line agents varied. In 
both ITT and MITT populations and using MGIT and solid culture data a higher proportion of placebo 
subjects had XDR-TB (e.g. MITT rates were 22% for placebo vs. 17% and 13% in the delamanid groups; 
p-values slightly less than 0.05).  
Numbers analysed 
A total of 402/481 (83.6%) subjects qualified for the MITT population defined as subjects who had a 
positive sputum culture for MDR-TB at baseline using the MGIT system. The PP data set based on the 
MGIT system included 69.9% (336/481) subjects. Among 145 patients who were excluded from the PP 
population 79 were excluded due to their baseline culture status, while the remainder was excluded due 
to major protocol deviations. A total of 347/481 (72.1%) of subjects from the MITT population were 
analysed for efficacy using solid culture media. The PP data set based on solid culture media included 
60.7% (292/481) of subjects.

Outcomes and estimation 
SCC rates by MGIT up to Day 57 were statistically significantly higher in the two groups treated with 
delamanid (100 mg BID 45.4%; 200 mg BID 41.9%) vs. placebo [p = 0.0083 and 0.0393, 
respectively]). For subjects with cavitation the proportions achieving SCC were also statistically 
significantly higher for delamanid vs. placebo. For subjects without cavitation the differences were not 
significant for either delamanid group vs. placebo or overall for delamanid vs. placebo.

For SCC rates based on solid culture media data, statistically significantly higher proportions in the 
delamanid groups achieved SCC regardless of cavitation. 
Table 22 
Analysis of sensitivity data sets (LOCF, OC and PP) for both the MGIT system and solid culture media 
results supported the results from the MITT data sets. 
Other MGIT system data 
At all post-baseline visits the time to culture positivity was longer for both of the delamanid groups vs. 
placebo. Differences were not statistically significant at Day 57 using the LOCF data set but were 
statistically significant at Days 36 and 43 for both delamanid groups vs. placebo. The results for the two 
delamanid groups were comparable. 
In the MITT population the LS mean of AUC of change from baseline in time to culture positivity (mean, 
SE) was 13.4, 13.1 and 11.1 in the delamanid 100 mg and 200 mg BID groups vs. placebo. The omnibus 
Kruskal-Wallis test was not statistically significant but the pair wise comparisons (delamanid 100 mg or 
200 mg BID vs. placebo) showed p-values of 0.0246 and 0.0529, respectively. 
The analysis of sputum culture negativity at Day 57 without consideration of subsequent culture results 
in the MITT population showed numerically but not statistically higher rates for delamanid vs. placebo, 
regardless of the presence of cavitation. In addition, the proportion with sputum culture negativity at 
Day 57 and Day 84 without respect to interim culture results was numerically but not statistically higher 
for delamanid vs. placebo. 
Table 23 
Since baseline susceptibility was perfomed only for the MGIT isolates the applicant was only able to 
analyse outcomes by number of predicted active drugs in the OBR for these cases. In addition the

analysis was confined to those taking any of an injectable agent (INJ), a fluoroquinolone (FQ), 
pyrazinamide (PZA) or ethambutol (EMB). The numbers who were infected with a sensitive strain and 
received a given drug was approximately 25% for PZA, 19% for INJs, 68% for FQs and 29% for EMB. 
-  SCC rates among those with strains sensitive to PZA and received it were 62.9%, 51.5% and 23.5% 
in the DLM 100 mg BID, 200 mg BID and Placebo arms, respectively. 
- 
- 
- 
For INJs the corresponding SCC rates were 71.4%, 44.8% and 25.0% in the DLM 100 mg BID, 
200 mg BID and Placebo arms, respectively. 
For FQs the corresponding rates were 51.5%, 40.4% and 32.9% in the DLM 100 mg BID, 200 mg 
BID and Placebo arms, respectively. 
For EMB the corresponding rates were 52.5%, 40.9% and 26.5% in the DLM 100 mg BID, 200 mg 
BID and Placebo arms, respectively. 
The applicant observed that: 
-  Across arms the highest proportion received 1 type of active drug (38.8%), followed by no drug 
(28.4%) and 2 types of drugs (24.1%), with relatively few (8.7%) having received 3 active drugs.  
- 
The proportions achieving SCC at 2 months were higher for each of the delamanid groups vs. 
placebo for the patients who received no active drug, 2 types and 3 types of active drugs in the 
OBR. 
- 
For  the  patients  who  received  1  type  of  active  drug  (predominantly  a  fluoroquinolone)  the  2 
months SCC proportions were similar for each of the 3 treatment arms. 
Since this analysis is confined to INJ, PRZ or FQs these patients could have been receiving other agents 
to which their strain was susceptible so the 114 in the analysis that did not receive an agent from the 3 
classes that was predicted to be active cannot be assumed to have received delamanid monotherapy. 
The SCC rates in the delamanid 100 mg BID group increased considerably when 2 or 3 types of agents 
were included in the OBR but it was not possible to discern such a clear trend for the 200 mg BID group 
or placebo group. 
Other solid media culture data 
The proportion of MITT subjects with sputum culture negative at Day 57 without respect to subsequent 
culture results was statistically significantly higher for delamanid vs. placebo. A statistically significant 
dose response across the 3 treatment groups was observed (p = 0.0007). In the presence of cavitation 
the difference between delamanid and placebo did not reach statistical significance. The proportion of 
subjects with sputum culture negative for growth at Day 57 and Day 84 without respect to interim 
culture results was statistically significantly higher for delamanid vs. placebo.

Table 24 
MGIT and solid culture media data 
The benefit ratios (i.e. that subjects treated with either dose of delamanid BID would achieve SCC more 
rapidly than subjects treated with placebo; see table) calculated by the applicant showed that: 
-  With the MGIT system, the likelihood of achieving final SCC by Day 57 was 73% and 59% higher for 
the  delamanid  100  mg  and  200  mg  groups,  respectively,  vs.  placebo.  Results  were  statistically 
significantly higher for both doses of delamanid vs. placebo for subjects with cavitation at baseline.  
- 
The benefit ratios were higher with solid culture media (probability of final SCC by Day 57 was 85% 
and 130% higher for the delamanid 100 mg and 200 mg BID groups, respectively, vs. placebo). 
Also,  results  were  statistically  significantly  higher  for  both  doses  of  delamanid  vs.  placebo  for 
subjects without cavitation at baseline and for 200 mg BID vs. placebo for subjects with cavitation 
at baseline.  
-  Results of the sensitivity analyses (LOCF, OC, and PP data sets) were consistent with those of the 
MITT data set using both the MGIT system and solid culture media. 
Table 25 
XDR-TB 
Both the MGIT and solid culture method showed that a higher proportion in the placebo + OBR group had 
XDR-TB vs. either of the delamanid groups. The numbers in some of the cells in the table below are very 
small. Nevertheless, a lower percentage of patients with XDR-TB achieved SCC compared with patients 
who had MDR-TB while SCC was achieved in a greater percentage of patients in both delamanid groups 
compared to the placebo group regardless of whether patients had XDR-TB or MDR-TB. The treatment 
effect was greater in the XDR-TB subset based on solid culture and, for 200 mg BID, also for MGIT data.

Exploratory Multiple Logistic Regression analysis of SCC 
A multiple logistic regression analysis that combined all potential independent predictive factors for SCC 
into one model was conducted for the MGIT and solid culture media datasets in the MITT population.  
-  A longer time to culture positivity using MGIT at baseline  correlated with a higher likelihood of 
SCC at Day 57 (p = 0.0003). Moderate previous treatment was associated with an approximate 
3-fold higher likelihood of SCC at Day 57 than limited previous treatment (p = 0.0193).  
-  Baseline resistance to fluoroquinolone agents and at least one of the injectable anti-TB agents was 
associated with a 4.5-fold decreased likelihood of SCC at Day 57 (p = 0.0019).  
- 
The  odds  of  achieving  SCC  within  57  days  decreased  by  2.5%  for  each  year  age  increase  (p  = 
0.0181). 
-  A longer time to positivity in MGIT at baseline showed that for the solid culture MITT population, 
lower bacterial load was also associated with a higher likelihood of SCC at Day 57 (p < 0.0001).  
- 
The use of a later generation fluoroquinolone increased the likelihood of SCC (p = 0.0594).  
-  Baseline resistance to fluoroquinolone agents and injectable anti-TB agents was associated with an 
approximate 4-fold decreased likelihood of SCC at Day 57 (p = 0.0106).  
In the subgroup analyses by regions (the Americas, European/Mediterranean, NE and SE Asia): 
-  Using the MGIT data higher proportions treated with delamanid achieved SCC vs. placebo except in 
NE Asia and in SE Asia in the delamanid 200 mg BID group.  
-  Using solid culture media, higher proportions treated with delamanid achieved SCC vs. placebo in all 
of the regions. 
In the subgroup analyses by ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino vs. not Hispanic or Latino): 
-  Using the MGIT data proportions of Hispanic or Latino subjects achieving SCC were 12/39 (30.8% 
100  mg  BID),  18/38  (47.4%  200  mg  BID)  and  7/39  (17.9%  placebo).  The  difference  was 
statistically  significant  for 200  mg  BID  vs.  placebo  (p  =  0.0067).  The  corresponding  rates  for 
non-Hispanic or non-Latino subjects were 52/101 (51.5%), 39/98 (39.8%) and 30/86 (34.9%) 
with statistical significance for 100 mg BID (p = 0.0235). 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 60/140 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
-  Using  solid  culture  media  data  proportions  of  Hispanic  or  Latino  subjects  achieving  SCC  were 
14/38 (36.8%), 20/34 (58.8%) and 8/37 (21.6%), respectively, with statistical significance for 
200 mg BID vs. placebo (p = 0.0016). The proportions of non-Hispanic or non-Latino subjects 
achieving  SCC  were  49/80  (61.3%),  55/81  (67.9%)  and  30/76  (39.5%)  with  statistical 
significance for 100 mg (p = 0.0071) and 200 mg BID (p = 0.0004) groups vs. placebo. 
Effects of anti-TB medications on SCC outcome in the MITT  
-  Use of a later generation fluoroquinolone demonstrated an increased likelihood that subjects 
would achieve SCC at Day 57 using MGIT with a trend toward statistical significance. 
Table 27 
Effects of previous treatment history on SCC 
- 
The  odds  of  SCC  occurring  in  subjects  who  had  previous  exposure  to  third  line  anti-TB 
medications  were  approximately  4  times  lower  than  those  exposed  only  to  first-line  anti-TB 
medications (odds ratio = 0.26; p < 0.0039). 
- 
Previous  exposure  to  second-line  anti-TB  medications  did  not  prove  to  be  an  independent 
predictor of SCC in this analysis. The results using solid culture media were similar to those using 
MGIT. 
- 
The MGIT data showed that the odds of SCC occurring in subjects who had moderate previous 
treatment with anti-TB medications were ~ 2.5 times those with limited previous treatment.

Additional analyses of the effects of region and ethnicity (see logistic regression above) 
There was no benefit for delamanid in NE Asia based on MGIT while rates for solid culture in this region 
were 52% and 58% for delamanid vs. 40% for placebo. The MGIT data showed a benefit for 100 mg BID 
vs. 200 mg BID only in SE Asia (single site in Manila; 150 total enrolled) yet the solid culture media data 
showed a comparable benefit for both doses. 
Figure 14 
- 
The overall number of patients contributing to the solid phase assessment of response was 347, 
which is 55 (14%) less than in the MGIT assessment (402 patients) and 36/55 were entirely in the 
single Philippines centre comprising the SE Asia region (150 total patients enrolled).  
- 
- 
- 
The MGIT SCC for 100 mg BID group in NE Asia (31.0%) is similar to that for the Americas (30.8%). 
The MGIT SCC for 200 mg BID group in NE Asia (32.1%) is similar to that for SE Asia (36.2%)  
The SCC for the placebo group in NE Asia (32.0%) lies within the middle of the range of SCC results 
for the placebo groups across all regions (17.9% - 40.0%).  
The applicant concluded that the similar responses for all 3 treatment groups in the NE Asia region are 
possibly just coincidence rather than indicative that the NE Asia region was either different or 
anomalous. Sites in NE Asia tended to be more tertiary referral than primary or even secondary care 
facilities. In keeping with this the proportion of patients in each region with XDR-TB using the MGIT 
system ranged from America 6.9%, European/Mediterranean 17.4%, SE Asia 0%, and NE Asia 59.8% 
and results were similar using solid media. Thus, the NE Asia population contained a disproportionate 
number of XDR-TB cases and had the highest rate of previous third-line anti-TB therapy than in any 
other region. In contrast, in the single SE Asia site, where 100 mg BID seemed better than either 200 mg 
BID or placebo based on MGIT, there was no XDR-TB. 
The applicant concluded that the NE Asia population was least likely to benefit substantially from the 
addition of delamanid as a single bactericidal treatment agent, which may explain why MGIT results 
showed no clear benefit in NE Asia, while this finding was not the case using the less sensitive solid 
media for assessing SCC. Finally, there was no indication from the population PK data that drug 
exposure to delamanid (as indicated by AUC0-24) in the NE Asia population of patients was suboptimal; 
if anything it may have been somewhat greater among patients in this region than in other regions.

Analysis of SCC with dose and according to plasma exposure data (PK/PD analysis)  
The proportions with SCC using the MGIT system increased from 29.60% at zero mg/kg (placebo) to 
48.04% at 2 to 3.5 mg/kg but dropped to 38.64% for doses ≥ 3.5 mg/kg, and no statistically significant 
dose response was observed.  
Figure 15 
When subdividing this analysis by region, the MGIT SCC rates for each delamanid mg/kg subgroup were 
higher vs. placebo in the USA and the European Mediterranean region but the effect of delamanid vs. 
placebo was not consistent in NE or SE Asia (note that numbers per cell are often very small).  
Figure 16 
The solid media SCC rate increased from 29.6% at 0 mg/kg (i.e. placebo) to 67.6% in the sub-group 
that received ≥ 3.5 mg/kg delamanid. The data were more consistent than the MGIT data in showing 
higher SCC rates by mg/kg subgroup vs. placebo.

Figure 17 
The analysis of SCC as a function of delamanid exposure, expressed as average AUC24h over the 56-day 
treatment period, suggested that SCC increased up to an inflection point (AUC24h) of 3000 ng.h/mL and 
a plateau above 5000 ng.h/mL. 
Additional PK/PD analyses of study 204 data during the procedure attempted to further support the 
proposed dose regimen. Bactericidal efficacy was presented for each patient by the dichotomous 
primary outcome variable sputum culture conversion SCC (yes/no; based on the MGIT-MITT population) 
and by patient’s slope for time-to-positivity (TTP; MGIT), indicative for bacterial load reduction per day.  
Figure 18 & 19 
Assessment report

The applicant concluded that although 200 mg BID resulted in an approximately 50% higher exposure 
(mean AUC0-24h [CV %I] = 11837 [33.6 %]) than 100 mg BID (mean AUC0-24h [CV %I] = 7925 [37.5 
[%]), the efficacy end-point (SCC; MGIT) showed comparable results for both delamanid doses. 
Exposure measured at month 2 appeared to be above the potential threshold for maximum efficacy as 
increased exposure did not result in increased efficacy. 
The applicant also looked at time-to-positivity (TTP) by AUC. The mean TTP increased over 2 months in 
all 3 treatment groups, indicating a reduced bacterial load. The time to sputum mycobacterial culture 
growth in the MGIT assay at Day 56 (LOCF) showed a mean increase from baseline of 22.1 days for 100 
mg delamanid, 22.4 days for 200 mg delamanid and 19.3 days placebo; the differences compared to 
placebo were not statistically significant at Day 56 (100 mg delamanid, p=0.0786; 200 mg delamanid, 
p=0.0583). 
Figure 20 
The mean slope for the 100 mg (mean slope = 0.265/day) and 200 mg (mean slope = 0.253/day) were 
higher than the slope for placebo (mean slope = 0.203/day) (p-values were 0.0153 for 100 mg vs. 
placebo and 0.0417 for 200 mg vs. placebo, ANCOVA, cavitation and baseline TPP as covariates). The 
analysis of delamanid slopes as a function of AUC0-24h at the end of 2-month therapy did not reveal any

association between both parameters for the combined groups (R2=0.002) nor for any of both 
delamanid treatment groups separately (R2=0.009 for 100 mg and R2=0.001 and 200 mg. This finding 
suggests that during steady state conditions for 100 and 200 mg BID delamanid, patients were above 
the exposure threshold for maximum efficacy evaluated as increase in TTP per day. 
An assessment of the threshold was performed using data from the EBA study in which 100 mg, 200 mg, 
300 mg and 400 mg QD were administered after standard breakfasts for 14 days to newly diagnosed TB 
patients. EBA was not statistically different between delamanid doses and exposure was less than dose 
proportional. EBA assessed as a function of AUC0-24h from all patients was weakly correlated with EBA 
at Day 14 (i.e. a higher AUC0-24h was associated with greater decrease in log-CFU counts). This 
association no longer held when only patients with an AUC0-24h above 3500 h*ng/mL were considered. 
The applicant concluded that the threshold of AUC0-24h for maximum bactericidal efficacy was between 
3500 and 5500 h*ng/mL.

Resistant Tuberculosis (208) 
Registry for Data Collection to Determine Final Treatment Outcomes of Multidrug 
Resistant Tuberculosis Patients Previously Enrolled in Otsuka Trials Assessing 
Treatment with OPC-67683 (116) 
In study 242-07-208 subjects were to be enrolled no earlier than day 84 of study 204 and no later 
than 30 days after day 84 or 30-90 days after site initiation for study 208. The final dataset for the 
integrated analysis of 242-07-08 and 242-10-116 reported on 87.5% (421/481) of the patients 
initially randomised into 204 (not all had confirmed MDR-TB at baseline). Of these 421 patients 53.4% 
were from Asia and 66% were men. The median age was 34 years (range 18-63) and 56 (13.3%) had 
confirmed XDR-TB.  
From the total 481 randomised into 204 there were 213 patients who chose to enter study 208 and 268 
patients who did not enter study 208. Observational data were collected in study 116 from 421 patients, 
comprising 192/213 who entered study 208 and 229/268 who did not enter study 208. 
Throughout 204/208 there were: 
-  38 patients who received ONLY 100 mg BID and were followed through 116 
-  22 who received ONLY 200 mg BID and were followed through 116 
-  73 who did NOT receive delamanid in either study and were followed through 116 
but it seems that not all of these had MDR-TB at baseline in 204. All other patients who chose to 
participate in 208 received a different dose of delamanid for at least some period of time vs. the dose 
they were randomised to receive in 204.  Also, patients entered 208 at different time points relative to 
their participation in 204 - 54.5% within 2 months but 37.6% after a gap of more than 4 months.

Figure 21 
The analysis of sustained effect was based on the mITT population (i.e. sputum culture positive for 
MDR-TB at baseline) and on the solid culture data (rather than the MGIT data). In this analysis the 
applicant combined all data for delamanid (i.e. regardless of the dose[s] used). 
Additionally, the applicant assessed sustained SCC after 8, 6, 2 or 0 months of treatment with 
delamanid.  For this the results for groups of patients receiving 8 or 6 months were combined into one 
group for analysis of delamanid treatment ≥ 6 months (n = 192 patients). The remaining 229 patients 
who received 2 months of delamanid (156 patients) at either dose or placebo (73 patients) and who 
received no further treatment with delamanid during the remainder of MDR-TB treatment were 
combined into one group for analysis of delamanid treatment ≤ 2 months. The total of 192 treated for at 
least 6 months and 229 treated for < 2 months is 421, which implies the analysis was not confined to the 
proven MDR-TB population (402 by MGIT and 347 by solid culture).   
For time to sustained SCC over the full treatment period, the Kaplan–Meier curve of the delamanid 
treatment ≥ 6 months group had a substantial increase above the curve for the delamanid treatment ≤ 
2 months group starting at 3 months (Day 84).

Figure 22 
Both curves reached a relative plateau at approximately 11 months. Although a large proportion of 
patients were treated for a total of 24 months, the Kaplan-Meir curves stop after approximately 20 
months for the delamanid treatment ≥ 6 months group and 16 months for the delamanid treatment ≤ 
2 months due to the fact that no additional patients achieved SCC beyond those time points. 
The applicant concluded that the results from this survival analysis demonstrate that patients treated 
with delamanid ≥ 6 months experienced accelerated SCC that was sustained throughout the treatment 
period and that overall a higher proportion of these patients achieved sustained SCC compared to those 
treated with delamanid ≤ 2 months (including those who never received delamanid).  
As shown in the table below (which is confined to the 301 with MDR-TB on solid culture at 204 baseline 
who chose to be followed; note that the XDR-TB group is a subset of the MDR-TB) by the end of 
treatment 90.9% (130/143) in the delamanid ≥ 6 months group achieved sustained SCC compared to 
70.9% (112/158) in the delamanid ≤ 2 months group. Among the patients in the delamanid ≤ 2 months 
group, out of 48 who had no treatment with delamanid at any time, 37 (77.1%) achieved sustained SCC. 
This compares with 75 out of 110 (68.2%) of those who received delamanid for a maximum of 2 months.

sustained SCC compared to 41.7% (5/12) patients in the delamanid ≤ 2 months group.  
The full ITT population of 421 patients who agreed to participate in 116 was assessed for final treatment 
outcomes. The outcomes were determined by clinicians managing the patients’ care and were based on 
a given patient’s clinical status, including sputum culture status, at the end of treatment. Definitions for 
the outcomes were based on those outlined in the WHO guidelines and were subsequently grouped as 
favourable or unfavourable.  
Table 29 
Favourable outcomes were significantly increased in patients in the delamanid ≥ 6 months group vs. ≤ 
2 months group and mortality was also reduced (2 vs. 19). Also, 42/73 (57.5%) patients who received 
no treatment with delamanid during the 24-month treatment period had a favourable outcome and 6/73 
(8.2%) died.  
The applicant considered that the 73 that did not receive delamanid can serve as a control group for the 
overall analysis. This group, which is anyway a subset of the 229 in the ≤ 2 months group, showed a 
comparable favourable response rate vs. the total treated for no more than 8 weeks.  
The applicant proposed that the fact that substantial numbers received more than one dose of 
delamanid throughout 204/208 is addressed by the results of 204 at week 8 that relate to only one 
assigned dose.

The applicant also concludes that the results are conservative since a much greater proportion in the 
delamanid ≥ 6 months group had XDR-TB vs. the ≤ 2 months group (22.9% vs. 5.2%). In the smaller 
subset with XDR-TB the results are shown below.  
Table 30 
The applicant also provided several additional analyses in an attempt to support a lack of bias resulting 
from the lack of randomisation of subjects into study 208 and the fact that follow-up in study 116 was 
according to subject volition. 
However, CHMP questioned the reliability of these further analyses. It is not possible to agree that the 
results of 208 and 116 are without potential bias. Even if the data from 208 and 116 were to be accepted 
they fail to support a recommendation for 100 mg BID delamanid. The available datasets actually do not 
support any clear conclusion regarding the dose, they only point strongly to the insufficiency of 8 weeks 
delamanid.  
To further explain the problem over and above the fact that 208 was not a randomised study, that the 
dose used was decided by the physicians for individual patients and the comparison between delamanid 
and placebo was limited to 8 weeks, it should be noted that of the patients randomised into 204: 
-  44% did continue to 208  
-  28% did not have the possibility to continue (delayed start up 23% + site did not participate 5%)  
-  28% could have enrolled in 208 but did not either because they withdrew during 204 (10%) or 
completed 204 and chose not to continue to 208 (18%)  
This large proportion (28%; including 18% who completed 204) of patients who could have continued 
into study 208 but did not, creates the possibility that the sample continuing into 208 is subject to 
selection bias. One way of assessing whether the sample in 208 could be biased would be to compare 
those patients who did continue with those who did not.  
From the group originally randomised to delamanid, it was observed that at the end of study 204 (after 
2 months) for the ITT population the SCC rate based on PI favourable outcome was 85/126 (67.5%) in 
those who went into 208 vs. 91/156 (58.3%) in those who did not. For the mITT population SCC rates 
at the end of 204 for those randomised to delamanid were 71/107 (66.4%) for those who went into to 
208 and only 68/127 (53.5%) for those who did not. These observations pointed to concern that the 208 
population is subject to selection bias and that the bias favours delamanid in that response rates in the 
group that continued into 208 are likely to be biased upwards. All the subsequent presentations, 
including those of death rates, were considered to be flawed and difficult to interpret because of the 
potential for selection bias (see also: “Ancillary analyses”).

Study 242-09-213 was designed to confirm and extend the results observed in 204 and is ongoing.  
Results for the co-primary endpoints of proportion with SCC and time to SCC over 6 months will be 
available within the first quarter of 2014. Top line results on 30 month outcomes and the final report will 
be available in 2016.  
The study compares:  
-  OBR for 18-24 months with placebo for the first 6 months  
-  Delamanid 100 mg BID for 2 months + 200 mg QD for 4 months plus OBR for 18-24 months  
Follow-up will continue for 30 months after randomization (i.e. 6-12 months post OBR). The study 
includes a comparison of the SCC rates at 8 weeks (one of the co-primary endpoints) and will allow for 
comparisons of time to SCC and declines in time to positivity in the MGIT system. 
The study also examines 3 other aspects: 
-  Approximately, 40 HIV positive patients on ART will be enrolled in sites in South Africa and there is 
a modified protocol describing special procedures required for these patients, including additional 
blood  draws,  analysis  of  genetic  polymorphisms  potentially  affecting  the  metabolism  of 
anti-retroviral drugs and a requirement for hospitalization for at least the first 10 weeks. 
-  Moxifloxacin will be allowed provided that the patients are hospitalized for the first 10 weeks 
- 
The  study  will  otherwise  be  conducted  as  an  out-patient  study  unless  local  practice  or  patient 
condition requires this 
There are 18 sites with 5 in Europe. Six participated in Otsuka clinical studies before and 12 are new (in 
India, South Africa and Moldova). 
Study 242-208-210 is an open-label dose escalation study (range 250 mg -400 mg BID delamanid 
added to OBR) in sputum culture positive MDR-TB patients refractory to treatment with OBR. Study is 
ongoing and a total of 30 patients are envisaged for enrolment. 
Ancillary analyses (trials 204/208 – 116) 
Updated mortality data 
In a supplementary analysis, as requested by the CHMP following the oral explanation, the applicant 
focused on updated mortality data. Information had been collected on a total of 37 deaths among 464 
patients for whom vital status was known. All deaths except 2 occurred prior to day 771 and the analysis 
concentrated on 14 deaths in the placebo group and 21 deaths in the delamanid group (35 deaths in the 
ITT population) as well as on 32 deaths that occurred in the mITT-MGIT population.  
Mortality data were shown for 4 groups according to the actual treatment received: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Those who only ever received 100 mg BID throughout 204 and 208 (100/100 group) 
Those who received 200 mg BID throughout 204 and 208 except during the initial 2 weeks of 208 
(200/200 group) 
Those who did not enter 208 but received up to 8 weeks delamanid (2M delamanid [DLM] group)  
Those who never received delamanid (No DLM group)

Figure 23  
Table 31 
To further explain this subset analysis it is pertinent to recall that there were 213 patients enrolled into 
204 who continued in study 208 (44% of the 481 randomised) and 192 of these were followed up in 
study 116. However, considerable proportions of those who entered 208 received a different dose of 
delamanid vs. the dose assigned in 204. This is why the numbers in the 100/100 and 200/200 groups 
are small relative to the total initially randomised to delamanid that participated in both 204 and 208.  
These results show the value of a period of delamanid administration greater than two months to 
achieve a significant treatment effect and mortality reduction. The 2 M DLM group shows a more limited 
treatment effect with a 23% reduction in mortality relative to the No DLM group. Though consistent with 
a treatment benefit for delamanid this is not statistically significant. 
Nevertheless, caution is needed when viewing these data. It should be recalled that the proportion with 
XDR-TB at baseline in study 204 was highest in the total patients randomised to placebo (27% vs. 13% 
and 17% in the delamanid groups). Also, in the following table for 299 patients as described in the table 
heading there is a higher failure rate for those who received delamanid but a much higher default rate 
in the OBR only group. These observations point to a conclusion that those did not enter 208 (a 
substantial proportion of whom chose not to enter rather than being at sites where participation became 
impractical) were also more likely to default from OBR. This fact adds to the questionable validity of the 
overall comparisons that have been made according to “actual treatment” received.

Table 32 
The results for the three randomisation groups (100 mg BID, 200 mg BID and Placebo) were as follows: 
Table 33 
Each of the three randomisation groups reported in the table included those who did and did not enter 
study 208. The death rates in the initial delamanid groups and in the initial placebo group cannot be 
related to any treatment effect of delamanid due to the mixture of actual regimens that each group 
received in accordance with participation or no participation in 208. Hence, it is no surprise that there is 
little appreciable difference in death rates between the three initial randomised groups. 
As shown below the combination of achieving SCC by 2 months and longer duration of delamanid 
treatment yielded the lowest risk of mortality.  
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 73/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Table 34 
The highest mortality rates occurred among patients who neither achieved 2-month SCC nor 
participated in 208. Among those patients failing to achieve 2-month SCC, the 100 mg BID group has 
the lowest proportion (36.9%) of patients participating in 208 and the placebo group has the highest 
proportion (43.1%). This may explain in part why the mortality rate in the 100 mg BID group is not 
significantly lower than the placebo group. 
The association of 2-month SCC and mortality for the Otsuka 204 patients was assessed for 386/402 
patients in the mITT MGIT population (96.0%) with known vital status. Among the patients achieving 
2-month SCC, 2.7% died during MDR-TB treatment or during the average 2 years of follow up after 
treatment, compared with 11.9% of those who did not achieve 2-month SCC. The relative risk of death 
for patients who did not convert is 4.5.  
Table 35 
The association of 2-month SCC and mortality was adjusted for covariates indicative of more severe 
disease in bivariate models to see if the magnitude of effect of 2-month SCC was changed. Participation 
in the open-label extension trial was also included as a covariate to ensure that it had no impact on the 
strength of the association of 2-month conversion and mortality.

Table 36 
The MGIT result at week 8 and sustained SCC cannot be assessed since sustained SCC was captured in 
116 using solid culture data only. In the population positive at baseline in 204 by solid culture and with 
a PI outcome in study 116, an association between the month 2 result and final outcome is apparent 
particularly for those with SCC at week 8. However, more than half of those without SCC at 2 months 
went on to a favourable outcome and just under half did not.  
It is important to take into account this table since the applicant’s proposal is essentially that the 
comparison with placebo over only 8 weeks in 204 predicts a long-term benefit. In reality the available 
data cannot be used to confirm this supposition because of the variable management of patients after 
week 8 that would be reasonably expected to affect outcomes.

To further explore the possible treatment effect of delamanid in the reduction of mortality, 5 of the 
actual treatment groups were analysed. All of these analyses show a reduction in mortality associated 
with the treatment of MDR-TB with delamanid.  In all cases the relative risk of death for the delamanid 
group is presented relative to the placebo group.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The integrated analysis of the combined set of data does not provide sufficient evidence of meaningful 
benefits for MDR-TB patients from treatment with delamanid 100-mg BID for 6 months added to an OBR 
compared to those treated with OBR alone. 
The applicant provided two Position Papers – one to support the Combined analysis across 204/208/116 
(the critical results are shown above) and one (reflected in the PK/PD analysis) to support the dose of 
100 mg BID delamanid over 6 months (see the PK/PD section).  
Based on the data provided, the integrated analysis and the two Position Papers, the following 
observations are made: 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The main trial in the submission for conditional marketing authorisation is study 204, which was a 
double-blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate efficacy (in terms of sputum culture conversion, SCC) 
and safety of delamanid given for 2 months of treatment.  Patients could then (after at least 4 weeks off 
delamanid and taking OBR only; the gap between 204/208 exceeded 2 months in 45% of patients) 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014

participate in an open label extension trial (study 208), designed to the safety and efficacy of delamanid 
during 6 months of treatment.  All subjects (< 50% of the number randomised into study 204) who 
entered in trial 208 (i.e. whether or not they received delamanid in 204; which was not known when 
entering 208) initially received delamanid for two weeks at 100 mg BID after which the physicians could 
increase the dose to 200 mg BID. Hence, the randomization allocation of trial 204 (100 mg BID or 200 
mg BID or placebo) was not respected and the two treatment groups created were not comparable with 
respect to prognostic factors. The submission also reported outcomes (vital status and solid culture 
status) from patients who elected to be followed in trial 116. This was an observational study designed 
to capture additional data and final treatment outcome for patients who participated in trial 204 whether 
or not they participated in trial 208. 
The single pivotal study with a primary analysis at week 8 is insufficient. To support the indication 
claimed by the applicant there should have been a comparison of delamanid vs. placebo over a 
continuous 6-month treatment period.  Patients themselves selected to be treated in study 208 and only 
213 out of 481 randomised into 204 chose to enter. Some of the initial 481 patients never had the 
chance to enter 208 because this extension study could not be initiated at some sites in time to allow 
their participation. Patients who had achieved SCC in 204 were more likely to enter 208 than those who 
did not. Outcomes at the end of trial 208 are therefore subject to unknown bias and therefore cannot be 
interpreted. It is also not possible to interpret with confidence the solid culture or mortality data 
collected in trial 116. 
Regarding the delamanid dose regimen, many of the analyses presented to attempt to address the 
deficiencies of the trial designs were based on pooling of the dose groups. The lack of an adequate 
comparison with placebo cannot be addressed by comparing outcomes in 116 or vital status between the 
very small numbers that actually received a single dose level of delamanid (i.e. only 100 mg or 200 mg 
BID throughout 204/208) or did not receive any delamanid throughout (i.e. placebo in 204 and declined 
to enter 208).  
Comparisons between 100 mg and 200 mg BID are also subject to bias, as in trial 208 the dose was 
selected, not randomised.  This would be expected to bias against the higher dose as patients would only 
be up-titrated if they were felt to “need” the higher dose i.e. those treated with 200 mg BID in 208 may 
represent a population in a poorer general state. Despite this there were several trends in the data to 
suggest that 200 mg BID, at least for the initial 8 weeks, followed by 16 weeks at either dose might be 
the better regimen. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Despite the concerns regarding interpretation of the data, the small number of patients who only 
received one of 100 mg BID, 200 mg BID or no delamanid at any time, raise several concerns. For 
example, the solid culture data collected in trial 116 show no difference between the applicant’s 
proposed dose of 100 mg BID for 24 weeks and the group that never received delamanid. 
Added to these problems is the heterogeneity of the study population.  In the MITT population 17% and 
13% in the two delamanid groups had XDR-TB vs. 22% in the placebo group and the outcomes by 
sub-group clearly showed lower SCC rates in the XDR-TB patients regardless of the treatment given.  
This baseline imbalance in XDR-TB has potential to make the overall benefit of delamanid vs. placebo in 
the study (i.e. for all mITT patients) look better than it really was.  
Regional enrolment and outcomes also illustrated the difficulties of interpreting the overall findings 
when the population included MDR and XDR-TB. The answer clarified that a single site in SE Asia 
contributed 150 patients to study 204. Not unexpectedly, removal of this site (~ one third of patients) 
from the analysis resulted in loss of statistical significance for SCC rates between delamanid 100 mg BID 
Assessment report

groups and placebo based on the primary (MGIT) analysis. 
The MGIT SCC rate with 100 mg BID was considerably higher at this single SE Asia site, where there was 
no XDR-TB, compared to other sites (e.g. vs. NE Asia where plasma exposures were comparable with SE 
Asia but there were more XDR-TB cases). Also, the solid culture SCC rates at the SE Asia site were 
highest compared to other regions for both delamanid dose levels. As such, the overall efficacy for 
delamanid 100 mg BID and overall in 204 appears to have been driven to some considerable extent by 
the results from the single site in SE Asia that enrolled 150 out of 481 patients. In accordance with the 
CHMP guidance regarding provision of a single pivotal study, these findings add to the doubts regarding 
the robustness of study 204.  
In the applicant’s separate Position Paper to further support selection of 100 mg BID the PK/PD analysis 
attempts to identify a threshold delamanid exposure associated with efficacy. From this, the applicant 
has concluded that exposure to delamanid in study 204 was above the threshold for maximum efficacy 
as no association between a further increase in plasma exposure and increase in efficacy was observed. 
Hence, as long as exposure comparable to that in trial 204 is achieved, other factors such as 
morphological conditions of the host (cavitation), concomitant OBR therapy and corresponding 
susceptibility or duration of MDR-TB would have to be considered to explain individual differences in 
efficacy. 
The CHMP however remains critical of this conclusion. The analysis of SCC vs. AUC and TTP vs. AUC is 
based on only 8 weeks treatment. Whether or not patients achieved SCC based on MGIT was not solely 
due to delamanid. Also, the study population was heterogeneous in terms of MDR/XDR (with a slightly 
higher proportion with XDR-TB in the placebo group that may be at least partly responsible for the TTP 
results).  
These issues weaken the discriminative capacity of the analysis to confirm a lack of association between 
dose (based on AUC at steady state) and MGIT SCC. Such an analysis cannot supplant and/or overturn 
the few actual data that can be gleaned regarding the comparison of 100 mg vs. 200 mg BID. The 
attempt to establish a threshold AUC correlating with maximal efficacy from the EBA study data is also 
not considered reliable.  
Additional expert consultation 
The advice of an Ad-Hoc Expert Group was sought on the following aspects:  
Efficacy & Drug Resistance 
1.  Expert opinion was sought on the fact if comparison of delamanid vs. placebo over 8 weeks suffices 
to predict the treatment effect of 6 months therapy?   
The group was not confident that this is indeed possible. The experts were concerned that the data to 
Week 8 included too much heterogeneity.  Indeed, in their view, the data are clearly subject to influence 
according to region/site.  Treatment groups were imbalanced in the proportion of patients with XDRTB. 
Open-label data from 208/116 do not further add in confirming the treatment effect. 
2.  Do the data adequately support the proposed posology for 100 mg BID for 6 months?  If not, can an 
alternative dose regimen and/or duration be suggested as more appropriate?  
The experts agreed that although there is some evidence of efficacy obtained with a 100 mg bid 
regimen, there is also some indication that a 200 mg bid could be more appropriate, but with the caveat 
of potential concern about QTc prolongation and drug interactions.  It could however be advantageous 
to explore other dosages (e.g. in between 100-200 mg), taking account of the appropriate precautions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 81/140 
 
 
  
  
3.  It was asked if the experts consider that the ongoing Phase 3 trial is adequate to confirm the 
proposed posology? 
The experts noted that in trial 213, the dosage schedule differs from the one used in the presently 
submitted 8 –weeks controlled trial 204.  The group considered that possibly 200 mg OD for 4 months 
could be an acceptable dose (as proposed), whilst large uncertainties remain regarding the optimal 
treatment dose for the first 2 months: should it be 100 mg BID or an initial higher dose? Ultimately, a 
right balance needs to be struck between the higher probability in achieving reliable SCC across the 
range of MDR/XDR-TB and risk of extensive QTc prolongation.  Also, retaining a contra-indication in 
using moxifloxacin as part of the OBR seems to deviate from reality of clinical practice.  Hence, drug 
interactions between delamanid and fluoroquinolones (including moxifoxacin) should be adequately 
addressed (note: moxifloxacin will be allowed in trial 213, protocol amendment). 
Although, the ongoing phase 3 trial will not adequately confirm the currently proposed posology (100 mg 
BID), the ultimate contribution of the proposed trial on the overall B/R balance of delamanid, will 
ultimately depend on the strength of its findings. 
4.  The experts were asked to consider if the results obtained at 8 weeks can be widely extrapolated 
across MDR patients taking into account the regional variations observed and the SCC rates for 
XDR-TB?  
An overall recommendation could not be made on this.  MDRTB and XDRTB represent a spectrum of TB 
with various resistances. A section of this spectrum is likely to benefit but this will be based on 
microbiological evidence and clinical judgment.  
5.  It was requested to comment on how the prescribing information might be amended to minimise the 
potential risk that use of delamanid along with other poorly effective agents could select for 
resistant organisms? 
The group stressed that where available treatments are very limited, every effort should be made to 
combine with other agents showing evidence of an effect against the resistant pathogen, and the 
decision to use should be according to expert advice. The risk for the patient and the public health 
implication due to potential emergence of resistance should be part of the consideration. 
Additional efficacy data proposed by the applicant as a specific obligation in the context of 
a conditional MA  
Ongoing study 213 will further try to confirm the efficacy of delamanid in MDR/XDR-TB patients.   
The study compares OBR for 18-24 months with either placebo or delamanid for the first 6 months.  
The dose regimen of delamanid is 100 mg BID for 8 weeks followed by 200 mg QD to complete a total 
of 6 months.  
However, the CHMP has doubts whether indeed this constitutes the optimal dose regimen to provide 
best chance of achieving reliable SCC across the range of MDR/XDR-TB patients.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
There are several issues regarding the design and conduct of 204 that raise serious doubts regarding the 
robustness of the data to demonstrate the treatment benefit of delamanid at either dose vs. placebo and 
to support the applicant’s proposed delamanid dose regimen.  
In particular: 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 82/140 
 
 
 
  
  
a)  The duration of comparison between delamanid and placebo is too short to be able to discern the 
benefit of adding delamanid at either 100 mg or 200 mg BID to an optimised background regimen 
for 6 months. Study 242-07-208 cannot repair this major deficiency since it does not allow for an 
assessment of SCC rates vs. placebo over the applicant’s proposed duration of use of delamanid (6 
months). In addition, the data obtained in both 208 and 116 do not allow for a robust assessment of 
sustained SCC and must be viewed with much caution since patients self-selected to enter study 208 
and to be followed in trial 116. 
b)  There are inadequate data to identify the dose of delamanid that should be used. The data obtained 
in 208 and 116 cannot provide a reliable conclusion regarding the most appropriate dose regimen as 
doses used in study 208 were selected and not randomised. It is also of concern that the magnitude 
of benefit of delamanid 100 mg BID vs. placebo based on MGIT SCC rates at week 8 was 
substantially driven by the result for this dose at a single site that enrolled 150/481 patients where 
no patient had XDR-TB. 
There is a critical need to substantiate the efficacy of delamanid at a final proposed dose regimen with 
an adequate comparison vs. placebo over 6 months.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The most informative data come from the comparison with placebo over 8 weeks in 242-07-204 while 
242-07-208 provided information on longer-term exposure to delamanid without a control group. 
Patient exposure 
In 242-07-204, 91% (437/481) of subjects were treated for at least 56 days.  
Three studies were completed after the initial application was submitted: 242-07-208, 242-08-210 and 
242-10-116; all were ongoing at submission.  In total, since 2004 there have been 887 individuals 
exposed to delamanid. 
Table 41 
Assessment report

Page 83/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Adverse events 
In 242-07-204 > 90% of subjects per treatment group had at least one TEAE.  
Table 42 
In trial 204, women treated with either dose of delamanid had a higher incidence of TEAEs by SOC vs. 
men (overall 95.4% vs. 89.7%) and a similar pattern was observed in the placebo group (98.0% vs. 
91.0%). The increased incidence of TEAEs for women vs. men was apparent for the majority of SOCs 
although rates among women in the delamanid BID groups were not higher than rates among women in 
the placebo group except Investigations and Renal and Urinary Disorders. In the Renal and Urinary 
Disorders SOC no specific PT contributed to the observed difference. In the Investigations SOC, the 
difference was due to ECG QT prolonged (13.0% vs. 8.2%), which reflected the overall effect of 
delamanid in this respect. 
To explore whether the difference in incidence of TEAEs by gender may be related to body weight and 
delamanid exposure the applicant provided plots for delamanid AUCss by gender. Separate plots for 
each delamanid dose group showed a similar pattern. Women showed a slightly higher exposure at 
steady state, possibly related to their slightly lower body weight vs. men. 
The incidence of TEAEs reported in the SE Asian region in delamanid and placebo groups was 100%, 
which was higher than for other regions combined (88% delamanid BID and 89.6% placebo). 
Although the applicant dismissed the possibility that the gender difference in TEAE rates reflected 
delamanid exposures it is stated that the difference in incidence by region may partially be explained by 
a slightly higher delamanid exposure in the SE Asian population. The Population PK data also showed 
slightly higher delamanid exposure in SE Asia in the 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID groups vs. other 
regions combined. However, the predicted delamanid exposure at steady state based on the average 
body weight in men and women by region showed very similar delamanid exposures despite the slightly 
lower body weight observed in women. 
In 242-07-208 there were no new clinically important TEAEs relative to those reported in 204 and no 
meaningful increases in the incidence of any TEAEs vs. 204. In particular, the incidence of TEAEs of QT 
interval prolongation did not increase in study 208 vs. either delamanid treatment group in trial 204.

From the listing it seems that 0-2 TEAEs of any one type were considered to be severe in intensity and 
for the majority there were no TEAEs considered severe.

delamanid doses in 208

In study 204, TEAEs for which the total rate for delamanid was higher by > 5 percentage points vs. 
placebo included nausea, vomiting, headache and prolonged ECG QT (37/321, 11.5% vs. 6/160, 3.8%). 
For all of these events, the rates were also higher in the delamanid 200 mg vs. 100 mg BID group. 
More subjects in the delamanid 100 mg and 200 mg BID groups (26/159, 16.4% and 22/158, 13.9%, 
respectively) had a ≥ 5% decrease in body weight compared with placebo (10/157, 6.4%).  
The table shows TEAEs in 204 that occurred at a rate higher by 3 percentage points for delamanid (either 
dose) vs. placebo. 
Table 44 
Within study 204, the rates for TEAEs considered drug-related were also mostly comparable between 
groups except for prolonged QT (23/321; 7.2%, total delamanid vs. 2/160; 1.3%, placebo).

Table 45 
The primary ECG analysis (time-matched change in QTcF from Day −1 to Day 56) showed that 
delamanid was associated with a progressive increase in QTcF. The upper CIs increased from 11 ms (100 
mg BID) and 14 ms (200 mg BID) at Day 14 to 12 and 17 ms at Day 28 and 16 and 19 ms at Day 56. 
The greatest magnitude of effect at Day 56 was 13 ms (10 to 16 ms) change for delamanid 100 mg BID 
vs. placebo and 16 ms (12 to 19 ms) change for 200 mg BID vs. placebo, indicating a QTc dose 
relationship. 
Figure 24 
Using the time-averaged method for QTcF, delamanid showed a dose-response relationship with a 
progressive increase from Day 1 to Day 56 with a 12 ms (10 to 15 ms) mean change at the 100 mg BID 
dose level and a 15 ms (12 to 17 ms) mean change at the 200 mg BID dose level.  
At Day 56, there were also imbalances between total delamanid and placebo groups for the incidences 
of categorical changes in QTcB and QTcF. No subject had a new onset QTcF > 500 ms but 5/321 (1.5%) 
in the delamanid group (all 200 mg BID) had a new onset QTcF > 480 ms versus 1/160 (0.6%) on

placebo. Rates for new onset QTcF > 450 ms were 47/321 (14.6%) vs. 10/160 (6.2%), respectively. 
Also, 11/321 (3.4%) in the total delamanid group had a change in QTcF of > 60 ms versus 0% on 
placebo while 30 to 60 ms changes from baseline occurred in 129/321 (40.1%) and 25/160 (15.6%). 
The analysis using the restricted dataset gave the same pattern of findings with no important differences 
vs. the original ECG analysis dataset. 
TEAEs of QT/QTc prolongation in individual subjects were reported for 16/161 (9.9%) in the delamanid 
100 mg BID group, 21/160 (13.1%) in the 200 mg BID group and 6/160 (3.8%) for placebo. Other 
reported ECG-related TEAEs in subjects treated with delamanid were ECG ST segment depression (3 
subjects), ECG ST segment abnormal (1 subject) and ECG abnormal T wave (1 subject). The time point 
analysis showed a slight drop in HR ranging on Day 56 from −3.5 to −6.7 ms in the delamanid 100 mg 
BID group and −3.3 to −5.9 ms in the 200 mg BID group. No signal of any effect on PR duration or QRS 
duration was demonstrated. 
Overall, there were 43 patients with QTc interval outlier events of > 60 ms change from baseline at any 
time in 204 (29 patients), 208 (13 patients) and 210 (1 patient); all were in the delamanid treatment 
groups. In 204, 13 were in the 100 mg BID group and 16 in the 200 mg BID group with 7 and 6 in 
respective dose groups in 208 and one subject in 210 who received 300 mg BID. All 29 subjects with 
QTcF increase > 60 ms in 204 were taking a fluoroquinolone; 9/29 patients were taking levofloxacin and 
20/29 were taking ofloxacin. No patient on placebo with or without low potassium had a QTcF > 60 ms 
change from baseline. 
There were 11out of 43 subjects with QTc change > 60 ms who also had a serum potassium ≤ 3.1 
mEq/L. However, based on readings taken as close together as possible there was no clear correlation 
between timing of low potassium and QTc prolongation except for a very few patients. Hence, delamanid 
was associated with QTc prolongation regardless of serum potassium. 
Review of Cardiac TEAEs and SMQ terms showed that palpitation was the most frequently reported 
TEAE. There was no consistent pattern in time to onset or duration of palpitation and most patients 
reported pre-existing conditions and/or were taking concomitant medications that possibly had a causal 
role in the event. There were more TEAEs of ECG QT prolonged reported in the delamanid treatment 
groups vs. placebo but there were no cases of Torsades de pointes or serious ventricular arrhythmias.

Table 46 
The incidence for other Cardiac Disorders TEAEs in trial 204 was < 2% for any TEAE including 
supraventricular extrasystoles, AV block first degree, sinus tachycardia, tachycardia, ventricular 
extrasystoles, conduction disorder, sinus bradycardia, and bundle branch block left. The onset of these 
events ranged from Day 7 to Day 63 and the duration from 1 day to 62 days. One TEAE of bundle branch 
block started on Day 28 and was continuing. The events were assessed by the investigator as mild 
severity and not related, except the events of AV block. No TEAEs of AV block or bundle branch block 
were reported in patients with TEAEs of QT prolongation 
In trial 208, 16.1% (22/137) reported TEAEs mapped to the Cardiac Disorders SOC and all events 
occurred with 100 mg BID: 13.1% palpitations and <1% each for first degree AV block, angina pectoris, 
extrasystoles and right ventricular failure. ECG QT prolonged was reported in 2.9% (4/137) in the 100 
mg BID group and 2.6% (2/76) in the 200 mg group. There was one TEAE of syncope reported in the 100 
mg BID group. Most events were assessed by the investigator as mild severity and not related.  
In trial 210, the doses used were 250 mg, 300 mg, 350 mg and 400 mg BID in combination with OBR 
administered for 28 weeks in patients with refractory MDR-TB (no SCC after 9 months of treatment with 
second-line anti-TB drugs). Of the 10 enrolled, one patient on 300 mg BID group experienced an acute 
MI and QT prolonged while one in the 250 mg BID group reported syncope on Day 224. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
The single death in study 242-07-204 occurred in a 50-year-old Asian female with MDR TB that had been 
treated several times previously. On Day 1 she had a potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L, which dropped to 1.9 
mEq/L on Day 7, when she had worsening anaemia, sinus tachycardia and QTcB prolongation (from Day 
Assessment report

-1 468 ms to 541 ms; this decreased to 397 ms on Day 8 after the hypokalaemia had been treated). The 
plasma concentration of DM-6705 was 20.3 ng/ml on Day 6, when delamanid was stopped. On Day 7 she 
developed respiratory failure, was intubated in ICU but on the next day had two cardiac arrests and died. 
The single death in study 242-07-208 involved a 25-year-old Asian male with a 3-year history of 
treatment for TB who received delamanid 100 mg BID. He died of right ventricular failure on Day 72, 63 
days after discontinuation of delamanid on Day 9 (he had also received 200 mg BID for 8 weeks in study 
204). He had evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy at study 204 screening and all subsequent ECGs 
but this was not seen on the screening ECG for study 208. On Day 9 of study 208 he had SAEs of right 
ventricular failure and increased hepatic transaminase, with severe drug-induced liver injury and mild 
increased blood uric acid. Delamanid was stopped. The elevated blood uric acid resolved by Day 19 and 
the elevated hepatic transaminase, drug induced liver injury and hyperbilirubinaemia resolved by Day 
27. On Day 34 he had severe respiratory failure and he died on Day 72. The investigator considered the 
right ventricular failure, drug-induced liver injury, increased hepatic transaminase, and 
hyperbilirubinaemia all possibly related to delamanid. 
One additional death occurred in trial 210 on Day 78 following discontinuation of delamanid on Day 64. 
This 46-year-old male patient died due to acute non-Q wave myocardial infarction (Day 63), coronary 
artery disease, worsening MDR-TB and alcohol abuse. Delamanid, as well as other anti-TB medications, 
were discontinued. The plasma concentration of DM-6705 on Day 64 was 121 ng/mL with QTcF of 415 
ms, which was not an increase from baseline.  
There were another 21 deaths in the registry study 116, for which cause of death was not recorded. 
These subjects were not taking delamanid.  The median time from last dose of delamanid to death was 
231.5 days, with a range from 3 days to 705 days.  
Six of the 24 total patients who died did not receive delamanid.  Among 18 that did receive any 
delamanid, 6 cases had actually achieved SCC in 204 or in 208 without a documented reversion. In all 
except 3 instances death occurred at > 100 days after the last dose of delamanid. The other three had 
intervals of 3 days (case in 204), 15 days and 63 days. 
During the procedure, information was collected on a total of 37 deaths by means of study 116 as well 
as review of TB program records at sites where 204 was conducted. These data were analysed in support 
of efficacy and are described in the previous section.  
Severe adverse events 
Overall, 74 patients in 204/208 reported SAEs. No new clinically relevant SAEs were reported in 208 vs. 
204. QT interval prolongation was reported as an SAE for 2 patients. Most SAEs in 208 occurred 4 
months or longer after starting treatment with delamanid. Those occurring in > 1 patient are shown in 
the table.

Table 47 
In 242-07-204 the overall incidence of SAEs was slightly higher for the pooled dose delamanid group 
(36/321, 11.2%) vs. placebo (14/160, 8.8%). Rates for individual SAEs were mostly comparable except 
for prolonged ECG QT (16/321, 5.0% vs. 3/160, 1.9%). Prolonged QT was considered by the 
investigator as possibly related for 9/16 of those treated with delamanid. Rates were 7/161 (4.3%; 5 
related) for 100 mg BID and 9/160 (5.6%; 4 related) for 200 mg BID. None of the three SAEs of this type 
on placebo were considered related and no event was accompanied by clinical symptoms. SAEs of 
hypokalaemia were reported for 2 subjects in the delamanid 200 mg BID group but were not considered 
to be related by the investigator.  
One 32-year-old Asian subject became pregnant after receiving 200 mg BID in study 204 and 100 mg 
BID in study 208. She conceived approximately 34 days after the last dose of delamanid. At 33 weeks 
gestation she experienced pre-term labour that did not progress and at nearly 39 weeks she delivered 
a healthy male by Caesarean section.  
Laboratory findings 
In 242-07-04 clinically significant abnormal chemistry values were most frequently observed for uric 
acid, potassium, sodium and albumin. Hyperuricaemia was the only parameter for which the proportion 
of subjects with clinically significant abnormal values was higher for the total delamanid group (26.1% 
vs. 22.9% for placebo).  
TEAEs related to serum chemistry abnormalities were reported at comparable rates for delamanid and 
placebo groups. The most frequently reported was hypokalaemia (15.9% vs. 15.0%). Hypokalaemia 
was also the most frequently reported potentially drug-related chemistry abnormality (2.5% [8/321] 
delamanid and 1.9% [3/160] placebo). SAEs of hypokalaemia were reported for 2 subjects.  
Elevated serum cortisol may be seen in progressive TB due to disturbance of the peripheral metabolism 
of cortisol leading to increased cortisol production. The proportion with ≥ 26 μg/dL was higher in the

delamanid groups (58/161, 36.0% and 78/160, 48.8%) vs. placebo (47/160, 29.4%). In addition, 
about half of the subjects had a single elevation that met clinically significant criteria including 28/58 
(48%) subjects in the 100 mg BID group, 38/78 (49%) in the 200 mg BID group and 26/47 (55%) in the 
placebo group. The onset of clinically significant serum cortisol values varied across treatment groups. 
Among those with clinically significant serum cortisol levels, 42/58 (72%) in the 100 mg BID group, 
52/78 (67%) in the 200 mg group and 30/47 (64%) in the placebo group had cavitations on the baseline 
chest radiograph. Also, 13/58 (22%), 11/78 (14%) and 7/47 (15%) with elevated cortisol in respective 
groups had XDR-TB.  
Clinically significant abnormal haematology values were most frequently observed for aPTT, absolute 
eosinophils, haematocrit, haemoglobin, MCV, absolute neutrophils, platelet count, RBC count, 
reticulocyte count and WBC count. Higher proportions in the total delamanid group had clinically 
significant abnormal values for haematocrit (13.4% vs. 11.3% placebo), haemoglobin (25.9% vs. 
22.5%), MCV (28.3% vs. 26.9%), platelet count (15.9% vs. 13.8%) and RBC count (27.4% vs. 26.3%). 
Clinically significant abnormal values for aPTT were observed less frequently with delamanid (44/321, 
13.7% vs. 26/160, 16.3% for placebo) but the converse applied to abnormal values for PT (11/263, 
4.2% vs. 2/138, 1.4%). No apparent safety signal of effect of delamanid on PT or aPTT was observed. 
One SAE of thrombocytopenia and a case of leucopenia were considered possibly related to delamanid 
and treatment was discontinued for both subjects. 
Haematuria was the most frequently reported TEAE related to urinalysis but was reported for a lower 
percentage in the total delamanid group vs. placebo (2.5% vs. 3.1%). Other than haematuria for one 
subject none of the TEAEs related to urinalysis abnormalities were considered by the investigator to be 
potentially drug-related, none was serious and none resulted in discontinuation. 
Regarding the potential for hepatotoxicity, the Asian male who died in study 208, having also received 
delamanid in 204, is described above. The cause of the liver injury was felt to be most likely liver hypoxia 
secondary to right ventricular failure. He did not have elevated bilirubin by laboratory evaluation, 
although he was reported by the investigator to have a TEAE of hyperbilirubinaemia. The investigator 
assessed the events as cardiac failure and hepatic injury, possibly related to the investigational 
medicinal product (IMP). The assessment was based on the observation that the patient had a relatively 
good Karnofsky score (80%) prior to the event, the OBR drugs were not new to the patient, the LFTs 
improved after IMP discontinuation, the secondary lung infection had not worsened appreciably at the 
time of the event, and the IV fluid given to improve liver function was not large enough to cause cardiac 
decompensation (there was global cardiac failure, which was refractory to diuretic and other treatment). 
Based on the Hy’s Law criteria the patient did have AST 20 x ULN and ALT of 10 x ULN at 3 days after 
elevation was first noted and the day before values were clearly rapidly declining. 
The three other possibly related TEAEs of abnormal hepatic function in 208 came from a single site in 
China. None of the patients met biochemical criteria consistent with Hy’s Law and none had isolated 
elevated bilirubin or a transaminase that was > 3 x ULN. Briefly, these cases concerned: 
-  A 31-year-old female on delamanid 100 mg BID had an ALT level > 1 x ULN, an AST level > 2 x 
ULN and a normal total bilirubin level (0.3 mg/dL). The abnormalities occurred at Week 26, were 
mild and were noted to have resolved at the follow-up visit (Day 225; but actual values not 
available). 
-  A 41-year-old male on delamanid 200 mg BID had normal ALT, AST and bilirubin levels without 
any other evidence of abnormal hepatic function in the patient profile. On Day 45, not closely 
associated with any scheduled laboratory investigations, he was reported to have the TEAE of 
abnormal hepatic function possibly related to the study drug, which was considered mild and no 
change in study drug was made. The TEAE was said to have resolved 9-days later. The sponsor 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 93/140 
 
  
  
does not know the basis of the TEAE report and it is not supported by any laboratory values in the 
database. 
-  A 24-year-old male had mild elevations of transaminases (> 1 x ULN) at Day 7 of 208, which was 
Day 84 of his participation in 204. He received 200 mg BID and had an ALT level > 2 x ULN, an 
AST level > 1 x ULN, and a bilirubin level minimally elevated at 1.3 mg/dL at Day 70. The event 
was mild, possibly related to study drug and no change in study medication was made. The 
patient withdrew on Day 78.  
One additional patient did meet the criteria for Hy’s law but the event was not considered to be related 
to delamanid. This case was reported in 208 following closure of the database for the interim report for 
the dossier filing. The patient was an 18-year-old male who received delamanid 200 mg BID during 204 
and had no TEAEs related to liver abnormality. At Day 99 in 208, when he was also taking 200 mg BID, 
he had an acute hepatitis event (AST/ALT 40 x ULN and bilirubin 6.6 x ULN). Viral hepatitis A, B and C 
were ruled out by appropriate testing. The patient was taken off all medications including delamanid and 
the event subsided. The investigator deemed the event due to pyrazinamide, a frequent cause of 
elevated transaminases and bilirubin in TB patients that has been associated with liver failure and death. 
Immunological events 
Thus far there seem to be very few TEAEs reported as “hypersensitivity” in the database and very few 
other TEAEs that could potentially represent allergic reactions to treatment.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There is a risk of co-administration of delamanid with other agents that can prolong QTc. This is an 
important fact to be communicated to healthcare professionals.   
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study 204 the percentages that discontinued treatment (delamanid or placebo) due to TEAEs were 
comparable (10/321, 3.1% and 4/160, 2.5%). No TEAE resulting in discontinuation was reported for 
more than one subject with the exception of psychotic disorder (in 3 subjects; 2 at 200 mg BID and one 
placebo). 
In study 208 7/213 (3.3%) discontinued delamanid because of TEAEs. These included SAEs of right 
ventricular failure, QT prolongation and oral malignancy. 
In study 210 two of 30 discontinued due to TEAEs of atrial fibrillation and progressive TB.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The total safety database for this new anti-mycobacterial agent is relatively limited in terms of total 
numbers exposed.  
The predominant concern regarding use of delamanid is the effect on QTc, which did show evidence of 
increased magnitude with dose. However, there does not seem to be a clear relationship between this 
effect and rates of TEAEs and there were only 2 deaths in the 204/208 combined datasets.  
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 94/140 
 
 
  
  
It is important to note that moxifloxacin was not allowed in clinical studies. All 29 patients with QTcF 
increase > 60 ms in trial 204 were prescribed a fluoroquinolone; nine out of 29 patients were taking 
levofloxacin and 20 out of 29 were taking ofloxacin. This is important since it is expected that 
fluoroquinolones would be standard (rather than exception) as part of an adequate regimen to treat 
MDR-TB. 
The details of the TEAEs that resulted in the higher reporting rates for the SOCs cardiac, investigations 
and psychiatric disorders in SE Asia showed, among other things, that QTc prolongation accounted for 
the difference in the cardiac and investigations SOC. The relationship between occurrence of these 
TEAEs and delamanid plasma levels was examined and suggests a trend to a positive correlation. 
However, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions in light of the apparent geographical variability 
in AEs reporting that confounds the assessment of reporting rates vs. plasma exposures.  
Another concern is the potential for delamanid to be associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. 
This cannot be dismissed on current evidence and would require further characterisation of this risk. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The total safety database for Delamanid is relatively limited in terms of total numbers exposed, but 
overall re-assuring.  
Electrocardiogram QTc interval prolongation has been identified as the most prominent safety concern 
of treatment with delamanid.  This is an important fact, since co-prescription with fluoroquinolones is to 
be expected as part of an adequate regimen to treat MDR-TB. 
Another concern constitutes the potential for delamanid to be associated with an increased risk of 
hepatotoxicity.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The pivotal trial for establishing efficacy and safety of delamanid in MDR-TB patients was the 
randomised placebo-controlled phase 2 trial 242-07-204.  The demonstration of the efficacy of 
delamanid was based on the increase in sputum culture conversion (SCC) after 2 months of delamanid 
treatment given in combination with OBR.  
Follow-on studies (208 and 116) aim to provide support to the sustained efficacy of delamanid. 
During 8 weeks treatment with delamanid 100 mg or 200 mg twice daily in study 204, a higher 
proportion of subjects with pulmonary tuberculosis caused by organisms that were at least resistant to 
rifampicin and isoniazid achieved SCC compared to the placebo group: in 45.4% of the patients treated 
with delamanid 100 mg BID, 41.9% in patients treated with delamanid 200 mg BID, and 29.6% in 
patients treated with OBR only (MGIT media); for patients with XDR-TB these figures were 4/24 (17%), 
5/18 (28%) and 2/27 (7%). 
As such, the magnitude of the difference vs. placebo in the MITT population varied by dose group, 
MDR-TB vs. XDR-TB, presence of cavitation, region and whether the analyses were based on MGIT or 
solid culture media results. 
The applicant’s integrated analyses showed that delamanid use for ≥6 months (any combination of 
doses) yielded a sustained culture conversion in 91% of patients with MDR-TB (130/143), and in 78% 
(31/40) in those with XDR-TB. Of note though, among 48 MDR-TB patients who had no treatment with 
delamanid in 204/208 at any time, 37 (77.1%) achieved sustained SCC (on solid culture media). This 
compares with 75 out of 110 (68.2%) of those who received delamanid for a maximum of 2 months. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The comparison between delamanid and placebo was restricted to 8 weeks only, which is insufficient.  In 
principle, there should have been a comparison of delamanid vs. placebo over a continuous 6-month 
treatment period.   In addition, the data to Week 8 are clearly subject to influence according to 
region/site, at least part of which reflects the rates of XDR-TB.  
The open-label data from 208/116 reflect patient decisions to continue with open-label treatment, 
investigator decisions to change the dose and willingness of patients to be followed up for final outcomes 
(24 months).  As such, the reliability of the additional integrated analyses is questioned. Also, the 
available datasets do not support any clear conclusion regarding the appropriateness of the 
recommended dose regimen (100 mg BID). 
Actual results for the relatively small numbers who were proven to have MDR-TB at baseline in trial 204 
and at any time only received one of the following: 100 mg BID, 200 mg BID or no delamanid, raise 
concerns.  Indeed, in the group that received only 100 mg BID in trials 204/208, 16 out of 25 patients 
(64.0%) had a favourable outcome (WHO classification) compared to 29 out of 48 patients (60.4%) who 
received no delamanid at all.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Delamanid is associated with prolongation of the QTc interval that is driven predominantly but not wholly 
by plasma levels of a major metabolite DM-6705.  Currently, there remain uncertainties regarding the 
metabolic fate of delamanid, since the apparently anomalous results of the human mass balance study 
remain unexplained.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The total safety database, consisting of two delamanid dose groups and placebo in the first study and 
uncontrolled use of delamanid in the second study, is limited.  
The potential for delamanid to be associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity is uncertain and 
would need further characterisation. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The actual benefit of delamanid cannot be established from the data provided.  The efficacy in terms of 
sputum culture conversion of the two investigated doses (100 mg BID and 200 mg BID) was superior to 
placebo, but the duration of comparison was too short. The results of the follow-on studies are difficult 
to interpret.  These data cannot address the essential deficiencies of study 204 and the available results 
cannot confirm the appropriateness of the applicant’s proposed dose regimen for delamanid. 
The main safety issue observed with delamanid relates to QT-prolongation, albeit no associated cases of 
ventricular tachycardia /torsades de pointes were observed.  Further on, hepatotoxic potential cannot be 
dismissed.  
Benefit-risk balance 
On current evidence, the benefit-risk balance of Delamanid in treatment of pulmonary infections due to 
multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis as part of an appropriate combination regimen is 
deemed unfavourable.     
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
MDR-TB is defined as TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is resistant to at least isoniazid and 
rifampicin.   It represents a significant unmet medical need in Europe and developing countries. MDR-TB 
is associated with a considerable mortality rate and poses a significant public health threat. New 
medicinal products that can be used in combination with existing therapies are therefore much needed. 
Delamanid, a nitro-dihydro-imidazo-oxazole derivative, provides a novel mechanism of action.  It has 
been developed for clinical use against MDR strains of M. tuberculosis, as part of combination therapy. 
Efficacy results (superiority outcome) were obtained in phase-2 pivotal trial 242-07-204.  All patients 
were diagnosed for pulmonary, sputum culture positive MDR-TB and received an optimal background 
regimen (OBR). Patients were randomised into 3 groups and received 100 mg BID delamanid, 200 mg 
BID delamanid, or placebo, in combination with OBR (BID), and sputum culture status was assessed 
weekly; SCC was measured after 2 months of treatment.   
Following completion of trial 242-07-204, patients were eligible for participation in the uncontrolled 
open-label trial 242-07-208 and received up to an additional 6 months treatment (or first-time 6 months 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 104/140 
 
  
  
for patients randomised to the placebo group in trial 242-07-204) with delamanid 100 mg BID or 200 mg 
BID during their course of 24 months MDR-TB treatment with OBR.    
The overall data are however difficult to interpret.  The duration of comparison between delamanid and 
placebo is too short to be able to discern the benefit of adding delamanid at either 100 mg or 200 mg BID 
to an optimised background regimen for 6 months. Study 242-07-208 cannot repair this major 
deficiency since it does not allow for an assessment of SCC rates vs. placebo over the applicant’s 
proposed duration of use of delamanid (6 months). In addition, the data obtained in both 208 and 116 
do not allow for a robust assessment of sustained SCC and must be viewed with much caution since 
patients self-selected to enter study 208 and to be followed in trial 116.   
In addition, there are inadequate data to identify the dose of delamanid that should be used. The data 
obtained in 208 and 116 cannot provide a reliable conclusion regarding the most appropriate dose 
regimen as doses used in study 208 were selected and not randomised. It is also of concern that the 
magnitude of benefit of delamanid 100 mg BID vs. placebo based on MGIT SCC rates at week 8 was 
substantially driven by the result for this dose at a single site that enrolled 150/481 patients where no 
patient had XDR-TB.  
The adverse events profile for Delamanid has been established in a limited safety database, comprising 
approximately 900 individuals.  Delamanid was generally well tolerated.   However, potential 
hepatoxicity cannot be dismissed and needs further investigation.  The predominant concern regarding 
use of delamanid is the effect on QTc.  Hypoalbuminaemia (particularly below 2.8 mg/dl) is identified 
as a major contributing factor. Also, caution has to be applied if delamanid would be administered with 
quinolones to construct an adequate regimen for treating MDR-TB. Of note, moxifloxacin was 
contra-indicated during the phase-2 study programme.     
Finally, the metabolic fate of delamanid remains largely unexplained, due to apparently anomalous 
results obtained in the human mass balance study.  
Based on the available data, a positive benefit-risk balance of this medicinal product cannot be 
established, which precludes the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation.

Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy for Delamanid in the treatment of 
pulmonary infections due to multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis as part of an appropriate 
combination regimen, the CHMP considers by majority decision that the efficacy of the above mentioned 
medicinal product is not sufficiently demonstrated as: 
- 
the duration of comparison between delamanid and placebo is too short to be able to discern the 
benefit of adding delamanid at either 100 mg or 200 mg BID to an optimised background regimen 
for 6 months. Study 242-07-208 cannot repair this major deficiency since it does not allow for an

assessment of SCC rates vs. placebo over the applicant’s proposed duration of use of delamanid (6 
months). In addition, the data obtained in both 208 and 116 do not allow for a robust assessment of 
sustained SCC and must be viewed with much caution since patients self-selected to enter study 208 
and to be followed in trial 116;  
- 
there are inadequate data to identify the dose of delamanid that should be used. The data obtained 
in 208 and 116 cannot provide a reliable conclusion regarding the most appropriate dose regimen as 
doses used in study 208 were selected and not randomised. It is also of concern that the magnitude 
of benefit of delamanid 100 mg BID vs. placebo based on MGIT SCC rates at week 8 was 
substantially driven by the result for this dose at a single site that enrolled 150/481 patients where 
no patient had XDR-TB;  
therefore the CHMP recommends the refusal of the granting of the conditional Marketing Authorisation 
for the above mentioned medicinal product 
Due to the aforementioned concerns a satisfactory summary of product characteristics, labelling, 
package leaflet, pharmacovigilance system, risk management plan and follow-up measures to address 
other concerns as outlined in the list of outstanding issues cannot be agreed at this stage.

5.  Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 25 July 2013 
Following the CHMP conclusion that Delamanid was not approvable for the following indication:  
“Delamanid is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary infections due to multidrug-resistant 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis as part of an appropriate combination regimen (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents”. 
as the efficacy of the above mentioned medicinal product was not sufficiently demonstrated, the 
applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal.  
5.1.  Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant 
The applicant presented in writing and at an oral explanation their grounds that the adopted CHMP 
opinion may not have considered the data fully and also provided further information. The applicant 
presented the revised indication: 
“Deltyba is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary infections in adults due to multidrug-resistant 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis as part of an appropriate combination regimen (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
5.1). 
Deltyba is not recommended for use in the treatment of extra pulmonary tuberculosis (e.g. central 
nervous system, bone), latent infection with M. tuberculosis, drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis or 
infections due to Mycobacterial species other than those of the M. tuberculosis complex. 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents”. 
During the oral explanation held on the 18 November 2013, the applicant addressed specifically the 
CHMP’s grounds for refusal as follows: 
Ground 1 
The duration of comparison between delamanid and placebo is too short to be able to discern the benefit 
of adding delamanid at either 100 mg or 200 mg twice daily to an optimized background regimen for 6 
months. Study 208 cannot repair this major deficiency since it does not allow for an assessment of SCC 
rates vs. placebo over the applicant’s proposed duration of use of delamanid (6 months). In addition, the 
data obtained in both Trials 208 and 116 do not allow for a robust assessment of sustained SCC and 
must be viewed with much caution since patients self-selected to enter Trial 208 and to be followed in 
Trial 116. 
The Applicant proposes 3 lines of data supporting the sustained efficacy of delamanid in MDR-TB 
patients: 
1.  The data from Trial 204 to demonstrate a sustained benefit in SCC out to 3 months from the 2 
months of treatment with delamanid at either dose in that trial. 
2.  Analysis of 2-month SCC, sustained SCC, and mortality in Trials 204, 208, and 116 to demonstrate 
sustained efficacy and reduced mortality. 
3.  The association between 2-month SCC and the longer term efficacy of MDR-TB treatment 
demonstrated by the Collaborative Group data.

1.  Analysis of data from Trial 204 on efficacy of delamanid 
The primary endpoint pre-specified for the randomized, controlled Trial 204 was the proportion of 
patients achieving sputum culture conversion (SCC) within 2 months by measuring mycobacterial 
growth incubation tube (MGIT). The results were an increase relative to the placebo group in the 
proportion of patients achieving SCC of 45% and 42% for 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID dosing groups, 
respectively. 
A key secondary endpoint was the time to SCC, shown with the Kaplan-Meier curve analysis. The curve 
for the two delamanid groups are nearly superimposed and separate from the placebo curve by day 28 
(one month) and the separation continues to increase during the second month. 
Figure 25: Primary and secondary analyses for Trial 204 
SCC was measured by MGIT (mycobacterial growth incubation tube) 
Proportion negativity at each time point 
Controlled data on sputum culture status was available up to 3 months (Day 84) in Trial 204 since to 
meet the definition of 2-month SCC, a patient was required to have achieved a negative culture by 2 
months in the trial as well as in the 4 subsequent weekly cultures.  
The proportion of culture results that are negative at each time point have been used to determine 
sustained efficacy. This is different from conversion, since it does not require a confirmatory negative 
culture but the proportion negative is a useful population measure of the efficacy of treatment.  Figure 
26 below illustrates the proportion of all culture results that are negative at each time point.

Figure 26 
Time to culture positivity (TTP) in MGIT 
For patients with positive cultures, the change in the mean TTP in the MGIT culture system can be 
examined. TTP is a measure of bacterial load in sputum and an increase in TTP indicates a lower 
bacterial load. The TTP in the delamanid groups separates from the placebo group at Day 29 and the 
difference between the delamanid groups and the placebo group remains statistically significant through 
Day 50 (Figure 27). Overall, in a regression model, the reduction in bacterial load is estimated to be 
22-27% faster in the delamanid groups compared to the placebo group.

Consistency of results at 2 and 3 months 
The results were consistent for the efficacy measures at 2 months and at 3 months. In all cases the 
efficacy measure for delamanid groups are significantly different from the placebo group. For each of the 
measures there is little difference between the two delamanid dose groups when compared to placebo.

2. Analysis of 2-month SCC, sustained SCC, and mortality in Trials 204, 208, and 116 to 
demonstrate sustained efficacy and reduced mortality. 
Final treatment outcomes were ascertained on 421 (87.5%) patients in Trial 116 and follow-up vital 
status was available on 464 (96.5%) of the original Trial 204 patient population at ≥24 months after the 
date of randomization in that trial (Table 49):

The applicant claims that bias is unlikely to have affected enrolment of patients completing Trial 204 into 
Trial 208 for the following reasons: 
•  Nearly all patient treatment assignments in Trial 204 were unknown to investigators and patients at 
the time of their potential to enroll in Trial 208, so previous treatment in Trial 204 did not influence 
the decision to enter Trial 208. 
• 
The Trial 208 protocol was designed to duplicate care delivered by the high-quality treatment 
programs where the Trial 204 sites were located; patients not participating in Trial 208 were 
managed in the same manner at the same sites. 
Association between 2-month SCC and mortality 
Mortality is an important clinical outcome from the perspective of both efficacy and safety and is least 
likely to be affected by bias. In the Otsuka MDR-TB development program for delamanid, vital status at 
≥24 months was determined on 464 (96.5%) of the original 481 patients randomized in Trial 204. This 
high level of capture of vital status serves to further attenuate concerns of bias in interpreting beneficial 
trends from 6 months of treatment with delamanid. As a frame of reference, overall mortality published 
in 2012 from the large meta-analysis of treatment data from >9,000 MDR-TB patients was 15%; ECDC 
reported 19.6% mortality for MDR-TB patients treated in the EU/EEA (Ahuja SD, et al. Multidrug 
Resistant Pulmonary Tuberculosis Treatment Regimens and Patient Outcomes: An Individual Patient 
Data Meta-analysis of 9,153 Patients. PLoS Med 2012;9(8):e1001300). 
The mortality according to original Trial 204 randomization group, 2-month SCC, and Trial 208 
participation is summarized in the Table below: 
Table 50 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 111/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
The key findings include: 
•  No deaths occurred among patients who achieved 2-month SCC as assessed with the MGIT 
system and then enrolled in Trial 208 (received 6 months delamanid) in each of the original 3 
Trial 204 randomization groups. 
•  Among those who did not achieve 2-month SCC in each of the original 3 randomization groups 
in Trial 204, mortality for patients who enrolled in Trial 208 was consistently two thirds lower 
than for those who did not enroll in Trial 208 (and did not receive 6 months delamanid). 
• 
The highest mortality was for those who did not achieve 2-month SCC in Trial 204 and then did 
not enroll in Trial 208 (did not receive 6 months delamanid).  
Though the number of patients in each of the various sub-groups for analysis is relatively small, the 
mortality benefit of delamanid treatment is clear. 
Association between 2-month SCC, sustained SCC, and Mortality 
Treatment with delamanid led to a 50% increase in 2-month SCC. As demonstrated in Table below, 
patients in Trial 204 who achieved 2-month SCC and then enrolled in Trial 208 achieved the highest level 
of sustained SCC (98.7%) among all groups; none of these patients died during the follow-up period. 
Their level of sustained SCC was higher than for those patients who achieved 2-month SCC in Trial 204 
but did not enrol in Trial 208 (85.9%), suggesting an added benefit from 6 months of treatment with 
delamanid. 
Among those who did not achieve 2-month SCC in Trial 204, those who did enroll versus those who did 
not enrol in Trial 208 experienced a substantially higher level of sustained SCC (81.5% versus 56.5%) 
and lower mortality (5.5% vs. 15.4), respectively.

3. Association of 2-month SCC with Sustained SCC and Reduced Mortality from Collaborative 
Group Data 
The 2-month SCC has long been considered a very good predictor of relapse-free survival in 
drug-sensitive TB and of favorable treatment outcomes, including a reduction in mortality in patients 
with MDR-TB. The largest meta-analysis of MDR-TB was conducted by the Collaborative Group for the 
WHO Stop TB Department using patient level data combined from different centers, using methods 
suggested by the Cochrane group (Stewart LA, Tierney JF, Clarke M on behalf of the Cochrane Individual 
Patient Data Metaanalysis Methods Group 2008. Reviews of individual patient data. Higgins JPT, Green 
S, editors. Cochrane Handbook for Systematic reviews of Intervention. Wiley-Blackwell; 48-58).  
An initial analysis of 9,153 patients with MDR-TB from 32 observational studies was published in 2012 
(Ahuja SD et al. Multidrug Resistant Pulmonary Tuberculosis Treatment Regimens and Patient 
Outcomes: An Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis of 9,153 Patients. PLoS Med 
2012;9(8):e1001300).  
To evaluate the validity of the 2-month SCC as a predictor of clinical outcome in MDR-TB, 2 co-authors 
(Richard White, PhD and Carole Mitnick ScD) undertook a series of analyses of a subset of 2,942 
patients from the original total group (9,153 TB patients) for whom baseline culture data were available. 
The findings are described below and the resulting conclusions have been endorsed by the authors.  
Objectives: To evaluate the evidence that supports the utility and predictive value of sputum culture 
conversion (SCC) from growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to no growth after two months of intensive 
treatment (2-month SCC) as an endpoint in the context of MDR-TB, using individual sputum culture 
results that could be linked with long-term outcomes, such as mortality, assessment of treatment 
outcome at 24 months, using a WHO algorithm, by the PI of each cohort, assessment of treatment 
outcome at 24 months using a computer program implementation of the WHO algorithm, and with 
sustained SCC, from 2,492 patients included in the Collaborative Group for Meta-Analysis of Individual 
Patient Data in MDR-TB database. 
To compare the strength of the association of SCC measured at 2 months, 3 months and 6 months to 
identify if there is an optimum time point for measuring SCC. 
To compare the association of 2-month SCC with mortality, sustained SCC and PI assessment of MDR-TB 
treatment outcomes at 24 months identified in the meta-analysis with the results observed in the 
combined dataset from Otsuka Trials 242-07-204, 242- 07-208, and 242-09-116. 
Methodology: The database for this analysis was assembled from a larger database of 9,153 patients 
from 32 MDR-TB treatment cohorts assembled to provide a robust evidence base for the 2011 update 
for the WHO Guidelines for the programmatic management of drug resistant tuberculosis.[7] The 
database includes patient information from 10 cohorts with agreement from the principal investigator to 
analyze the data in that cohort and 2,942 of these patients were included in the analysis. The Applicant 
claims that the meta-analysis is methodologically rigorous following methodologies outlined by the 
Cochrane Collaboration and meets criteria set out in EMA Points to Consider (CPMP/EWP/2330/99) on 
validity and use of meta-analysis data sets. In fact the meta-analysis was conducted under protocol with 
clear statement of objectives, study selection criteria, specification of endpoints and statistical methods; 
the patients dataset of 9,153 patients are representative of geographically diversity from all WHO 
regions; it is a meta-analysis of individual patient data from the eligible cohorts.  
Number of Patients: 2,492 patients with baseline sputum cultures positive for growth of 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The analysis of association of SCC with long-term outcomes has been 
performed with a subset of 2,942 patients with sputum culture data available and culture positive at 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 113/140 
 
 
  
  
baseline. The patients in this subset had demographic, geographic diversity and clinical characteristics 
similar to the large data set of 9,153 and that homogeneity of study results for association of SCC and 
mortality demonstrated qualitatively in forest plots and quantitatively (p=0.07). 
Statistical Methods: Pooled estimates of the effects for each of the outcome measures were calculated 
using both fixed-effect and random-effect models. Data for each outcome variable were presented in 2 
x 2 tables and for each of the cohorts. The crude odds ratios (OR) were then adjusted for cohort and 
then for cohort plus one other clinical or demographic covariate available in both the collaborative group 
and Otsuka Trials databases. In brief, 93 studies of MDR-TB or meta-analyses of MDR-TB cohorts were 
identified. Of these, 26 publications were excluded because they represented the same or overlapping 
cohorts and an additional 35 cohorts were excluded because the authors did not respond or could not 
provide the required individualized patient data. The remaining 32 cohorts included data on 9,898 
patients, of whom 410 were excluded since they had XDR-TB, 208 were excluded because they had no 
treatment information and 127 were excluded with extra-pulmonary TB, leaving 9,153 patients for 
analysis.  
Analysis and Results  
One of the key findings of this meta-analysis was that whether SCC was measured at 2-months, 
3-months or 6-months, a similarly strong association of SCC and a reduction in the odds of mortality 
was noted. The Odds Ratio for mortality, given SCC, was 0.20, 0.15 and 0.12 when SCC was measured 
at 2-months, 3-months or 6-months, respectively (Table 52). This indicates that SCC measured as early 
as 2 months serves as a meaningful predictor of long-term outcome, in this case mortality. 
Table 52 
One hypothesis for why achieving 2-month SCC is associated with a reduced likelihood of mortality is 
that those who achieve SCC earlier are most likely to achieve sustained SCC. In turn, those with 
sustained SCC are most likely to survive to the end of treatment and during follow-up. 
This was observed among patients in the Collaborative Group meta-analysis (Table 53). The Odds Ratio 
for achieving Sustained SCC, given that the patient achieved 2-month SCC, was 12.7. The Odds Ratio 
for mortality, among those achieving Sustained SCC was 0.08. This means that after SCC at 2 months, 
there is a >12-fold chance to achieve sustained SCC and the odds of survival are 90% higher.

These results are consistent with the biological hypothesis for the observed association of 2- month SCC 
and a reduction in mortality. 
Overall Results from Otsuka Dataset consistent with Analysis of Collaborative Group Dataset 
The results from the analysis of the overall data from the Otsuka MDR-TB program (irrespective of 
treatment with delamanid) were consistent with and are supported by the analysis of the Collaborative 
Group data. The association of 2-month SCC with mortality and sustained SCC and the association of 
sustained SCC and mortality are very similar (Table 54). The magnitude of effect is very similar in all 
cases. These three associations are consistent with the proposed hypothesis that delamanid increases 
the proportion achieving 2-month SCC which in turn increases the proportion achieving sustained SCC 
and finally that those achieving sustained SCC have a very low risk of mortality. 
Table 54 
Summary of Longer-term benefit from 6 months of Treatment with Delamanid 
In summary, the analysis of the data from patients treated with 6 months of delamanid provides support 
for an added longer-term benefit from the treatment. 
The data have demonstrated that 2-month SCC is valid to discern the benefit of adding delamanid to 
OBR for 6 months. 
•  The data from Trial 204 demonstrate a sustained benefit in SCC out to 3 months from the 2 months 
of treatment with delamanid at either dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 115/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
•  Furthermore, patients who achieved 2-month SCC in Trial 204 (irrespective of receiving delamanid) 
and then enrolled in Trial 208 to receive 6 months of delamanid treatment had the highest level of 
sustained SCC (and very low mortality), especially compared to those patients who did not achieve 
2-month SCC and then did not enroll in Trial 208. 
•  The Collaborative Group data provide independent corroboration of the Otsuka results 
demonstrating a strong association between 2-month SCC, sustained SCC, and improved clinical 
outcome. 
Data supporting the sustained efficacy of delamanid from Trial 213 which is nearing the completion of 
enrollment and in which MDR-TB patients receive delamanid or placebo for 6 months of the treatment 
with OBR and are followed for 30 months will serve to confirm this longer-term benefit. 
Ground 2 
There are inadequate data to identify the dose of delamanid that should be used. The data obtained in 
208 and 116 cannot provide a reliable conclusion regarding the most appropriate dose regimen as doses 
used in Trial 208 were selected and not randomized. It is also of concern that the magnitude of benefit 
of delamanid 100 mg twice daily vs. placebo based on MGIT SCC rates at week 8 was substantially 
driven by the result for this dose at a single site that enrolled 150/481 patients where no patient had 
XDR-TB 
Evidence that the 100 mg delamanid twice daily dose should be used as the most effective dose was 
obtained from the efficacy results of the double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, Trial 204. 
In Trial 204, both of the delamanid doses assessed, 100 mg and 200 mg twice daily, showed similar 
results for all efficacy endpoints. Furthermore, exposures from both dose regimens were above the 
threshold for maximum efficacy (Figure 29), as no association between increased plasma exposure and 
increased efficacy was observed. This indicates that saturation of delamanid’s anti-bacterial efficacy was 
reached at the exposures obtained with either dose in the trial. Doubling of the daily dose did not 
increase anti-bacterial benefit to the patients and would potentially increase risk and escalate +the 
already high pill burden of patients on MDR-TB therapy.

Figure 29 
The main conclusions from Trial 204 supporting the delamanid 100 mg twice daily dose were: 
•  Both delamanid 100 mg twice daily + OBR treatment and 200 mg twice daily + OBR treatment for 
2 months in MDR-TB patients resulted in virtually identical clinically meaningful and statistically 
significant increases in the primary efficacy variable, SCC at Month 2compared to placebo (29.6%): 
45.4% for 100 mg (p=0.0083) and 41.9%, for 200 mg twice daily, (p=0.0393). 
•  Mean exposures for delamanid 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID during steady state at Day 56 were 
AUC0-24h = 7952 (37.5 CV%) and 11837 (33.6 CV%) ng*h/mL. Although delamanid exposure 
was 49% higher for 200 mg BID + OBR, the proportion of patients reaching SCC at 2 months was 
comparable between delamanid dose groups. These results suggest that during steady-state 
conditions in Trial 204 for both the 100 and 200 mg BID delamanid doses, patients’ plasma 
exposure was above the exposure threshold for maximum efficacy when evaluated as SCC rate. 
• 
• 
Essentially identical results for both doses were also seen for time-to-conversion, assessed as a 
secondary end-point, where both were significantly better compared to placebo. 
There was no association between delamanid anti-bacterial efficacy (assessed as bacterial load 
reduction measured by the slope of the time to culture positivity [TTP] curve) and plasma exposure 
(AUC) to delamanid. 
As demonstrated in Figure 30 the regression line between AUC and anti-bacterial efficacy (TTP curve 
slope) is horizontal indicating no association (similar efficacy for either dose), whereas a positive 
association would have resulted in a diagonal regression line (as the efficacy would be higher at higher 
exposure).

Figure 30 
Summary of Delamanid Dose Justification 
The dose-response relationships were explored using the antibacterial efficacy, measured as SCC, TTP 
at various time points, the slope of the TTP and the time to culture conversion of the delamanid 100 and 
200 mg BID doses in Trial 204. Delamanid’s antibacterial efficacy from the 100 mg and 200 mg BID 
regimens showed virtually the same results, both being clinically meaningful and statistically superior to 
placebo. 
With regard to delamanid exposure, although 200 mg BID resulted in an approximately 50% higher 
exposure (mean AUC0-24h [CV %I] = 11837 [33.6 %]) than 100 mg BID (mean AUC0-24h [CV %I] = 
7925 [37.5 [%]), the efficacy end-points measured as SCC, TTP at various time points, as slope for TTD 
or time to culture conversion all show comparable results for both delamanid doses. A potential initial 
exposure range was identified in the EBA trial seeking to optimize the bactericidal activity in the early 
stage of treatment. The bactericidal activity of delamanid was assessed through daily measurements of 
CFU counts in sputum and expressed as the slope of log CFU change per day over the 14 days of trial 
duration in EBA. A threshold of AUC0-24h for maximum bactericidal efficacy was determined to be 
between 3500 an 5500 ng*h/mL. Thereafter, in a longer-term trial utilizing a split/BID dosing to further 
optimize exposure, the original initial bactericidal range appeared to be validated. The threshold was 
further evaluated using a nonlinear mixed-effect modeling approach with delamanid exposure and TTP 
data, which indicated a threshold of about 6000 ng*h/mL in XDR-TB-negative patients or 7000 ng*h/mL

in XDR-TB patients. In addition, the intraquartile odds ratio analysis indicated no significant differences 
between delamanid 100 mg and 200 mg BID on the probability of conversion and a plateau in efficacy 
was reached with the exposures beyond that associated with delamanid 100 mg BID. 
In summary, the delamanid exposure following the 100 mg BID regimen is well above the threshold 
indicated by the EBA trial, the exposure-TTP analysis, and the nonparametric logistic regression. 
Increased delamanid exposure, beyond that from the 100 mg BID regimen, does not result in increased 
efficacy. While the 200 mg BID regimen provides higher plasma concentrations and AUC0-24h, it also 
resulted in increased incidence of adverse events as well as the QTc interval, a marker for cardiac 
toxicity. 
Since the exposure of delamanid in trial 204 was above the threshold for maximum efficacy, it is unlikely 
that differences in delamanid exposure are a discriminating factor for differences in antibacterial efficacy 
(conversion/non-conversion or bacterial load reduction measured by TTP). As long as exposure above 
the threshold is achieved, other factors such as morphological conditions of the host (cavitation), 
concomitant OBR therapy and corresponding susceptibility or duration of MDR-TB would have to be 
considered to explain individual differences in efficacy. 
Justification for Delamanid Treatment Duration 
The proposed treatment duration with delamanid in MDR-TB therapy is 6 months. The 6-months 
treatment duration for delamanid is justified following analysis of durability of sputum conversion 
through determination of final sustained SCC. Durability of delamanid’s antibacterial efficacy was 
assessed by comparing sustained final SCC at the end of MDR-TB therapy 20-24 months after the start 
of Trial 204 between patients treated with delamanid for ≥ 6 months and patients treated for ≤ 2 
months. The results indicated that patients treated long-term with delamanid 100 mg BID and 200 mg 
BID + OBR showed notably and clinically meaningful higher rates of sustained SCC (92.3%) than 
delamanid 2 month or OBR only treated patients (73.4%). Furthermore, consistent with 2-month 
efficacy results, sustained SCC rates for 200 mg BID were not significantly higher than for delamanid 
100 mg BID. These results clearly support the proposed 100 mg BID regimen administered for 6 months 
to MDR-TB patients. It should be noted that a total SCC of around 90% is very much in the range of 
bacterial clearance in other bacterial diseases like CAP. 
Magnitude of Benefit of delamanid 100 mg twice daily is consistent across Region and 
extent of drug resistance 
Consistency of Delamanid Effect Across Regions 
The single trial site mentioned in Ground for Refusal 2 is the Manila, Philippines site. The potential 
imbalances represented by the large sample size enrolled at this site were addressed using statistical 
methods including a pre-specified sensitivity analysis.  
The pre-specified secondary analyses for Trial 204 consistently confirmed the favorable and clinically 
meaningful effect of treatment with delamanid + OBR compared to placebo + OBR. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the primary endpoint using the MGIT system and solid culture 
media, excluding microbiology data from each country/region; additionally, for the Manila, Philippines, 
by far the largest site for enrolment. The results of these analyses were consistent with those of the 
primary analysis (Figure 31).

The protocol also required the analysis of 2-month SCC in 3 other populations as a sensitivity analysis 
and to test the robustness of the conclusions about SCC (Figure 34). 
These populations were: 
• 
LOCF - for the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) analysis in the case of missing values the 
result for the last non-missing culture was carried forward to the end of the trial. 
•  OC - The Observed Cases (OC) data set is the population completing the 84-day trial, for patients 
with data through Day 84 and is a subset of the MITT population. 
• 
PP - A subset of the OC population with no major protocol deviation. 
In all cases, the delamanid group has a statistically higher likelihood of conversion compared to the 
placebo group (Figure 34).

Consistency of Delamanid Effect Across Extent of Drug Resistance 
Until recently, the WHO classified streptomycin as a “Group 2 injectable” among the second line drugs 
used to treat MDR-TB in the 2008 Guidelines. Therefore, resistance to streptomycin was included in the 
pre-specified analysis plan of Trial 204 to define XDR-TB. Now however, the WHO no longer classifies 
streptomycin as a second-line anti-TB medication for treating MDR-TB. Therefore, the data from Trial 
204 were re-analyzed using both the previous and current WHO definitions of XDR-TB (with and without 
streptomycin). In applying this updated definition, the imbalance at baseline disappears (Table 55). 
Critically, the marked treatment benefit of delamanid compared to placebo is apparent in XDR-TB 
patients according to both definitions (Table 56).

5.2.  Additional expert consultation- Report from the Ad hoc expert group 
meeting 
Following a request from the applicant at the time of the re-examination, and supported by both 
rapporteurs, the CHMP convened an Ad hoc Expert Group inviting the experts (and including two 
representatives from patient organisations), to provide their views on the questions posed by the CHMP, 
taking into account the applicant’s response to the grounds for refusal. 
Efficacy & Drug Resistance 
1.  Does the SAG consider the applicant’s claim that the short term efficacy results obtained in the 
placebo controlled trial with delamanid may be used as a proxy to predict the long-term 
maintenance effect of delamanid, taking into consideration the evidence published in the literature 
and the results of the meta-analysis which highlight the correlation between SCC results after 2 
months and treatment effect at 6 months?  
According to the SAG, do the 2-month SCC results together with the evidence of the correlation 
existing between results at 2 month and results at 6 months provide sufficient demonstration of 
delamanid efficacy for use in patients with limited options? 
Despite the imbalances in groups in MDRTB and XDR-TB numbers and recruitment sites in trial 204, the 
experts agreed that there is evidence of efficacy over an initial period of 8 weeks treatment.  Based on 
the experience of the experts there is a significant possibility that indeed it could maintain effect in use 
over the later phase of treatment.  However, the less than perfect evidence so far available from trials 
208 and 116, cannot rule out the possibility that delamanid would behave like pyrazinamide and lose its 
effect over a variable period. Nevertheless, based on the fact that a confirmatory trial is awaited soon to 
complement the current evidence, the level of efficacy demonstrated over 8 weeks in a superiority 
setting could be used preliminarily as a proxy for efficacy. 
2.  Can the results obtained at 8 weeks be widely extrapolated across MDR patients taking into account 
the regional variations observed and the SCC rates for XDR-TB? 
Bearing in mind the reservations about the small numbers and some imbalance in sub-groups studied, 
such as XDR TB cases, there is nevertheless no clear evidence that any of these groups failed to show 
a response. 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 124/140 
 
 
 
 
  
  
3.  Is the overall evidence provided by the applicant to support the selection of the 100mg BID dose as 
opposed to the 200 mg dose (for treatment over 6 months), sufficiently robust and adequate? 
If  not,  can  the  SAG  suggest  an  alternative  dose  regimen  and/or  duration  that might be more 
appropriate? 
Data available from the trials cannot confirm 100 mg bid to be the optimal dosage.  This is based 
particularly on mortality outcomes (in which 200 mg bid appears to outperform placebo and 100 mg 
bid), although it was recognized that the long term data are potentially biased as no randomization took 
place.  The group recommends that whilst 100 mg bid might be a starting point, 200 mg bid and maybe 
equivalent once daily dosage (i.e. 400 mg OD) could be explored as alternatives.  Most members felt 
that such dose should be explored in studies which may be differently designed and more discriminating 
than those completed so far, even from the beginning of the treatment course (thus to be employed 
over the whole course). At the same time it was reflected that co-administration with other medicines 
with an effect on QTc prolongation calls for some caution in the conduct of studies with higher doses. 
4.  The SAG’s opinion is sought on which further data would be required post-or pre-approval in 
addition or as alternative to the proposed equivalence study and the ongoing Phase III study. 
The SAG strongly recommended the following points for attention: 
- 
to explore a higher dose usage, including once daily dose regimen (preferable from practice 
viewpoint) 
-  MGIT culture data to be maintained as long as possible through the treatment of patients 
-  Observational registry to be set up to collect information on sustained responses, recrudescence/ 
relapse (including outcome in pre-XDRTB, XDRTB) and culture sensitivity data. 
5.  Can the SAG comment on how the prescribing information might be amended to minimize the 
potential risk that use of delamanid in combination regimens could select for resistant organisms? 
The advice given by the group concurs with the opinion expressed by the experts at the first SAG for 
delamanid (March 2013). 
Where available treatments are very limited, every effort should be made to combine with other agents 
showing evidence of an effect against the resistant pathogen (including at least one other bactericidal 
medicine), and the decision to use should be according to expert advice (and based in accordance with 
national and international guidelines).   
The risk for the patient and the public health implication due to potential emergence of resistance should 
be part of the consideration.

5.4.  Discussion on grounds for re-examination 
The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the 
applicant and considered the views of the ad hoc expert group meeting held on 15 November 2013. 
Ground 1 
The CHMP noted that delamanid 100mg bid versus placebo (in both arms added to OBR), proved 
superior in terms of achieving SCC at month 2 of therapy (figure 27) in a well-designed trial 204, 
including MDR-TB /XDR-TB patients.  Also data provided on proportion negativity at each time point, up 
to 3 months (figure 28) and time-to-positivity (TTP) (figure 29) were further supportive of  the short 
term efficacy of delamanid (100 mg bid or 200 mg bid) over placebo. 
With regard to whether the proven short term measure of efficacy is predictive for long-term patient 
outcome, the applicant asserted that patients who achieved 2-month SCC in trial 204 (irrespective of 
receiving delamanid) and then enrolled in trial 208 to receive 6 months of delamanid treatment had the 
highest level of sustained SCC (and very low mortality), especially compared to those patients who did 
not achieve 2-month SCC and then did not enroll in trial 208. 
CHMP remarked that enrolment in follow-on trial 208 did not further inform opinion on sustained efficacy 
due to recognised methodological flaws, such as open-label treatment, investigator decisions to change 
the dose and willingness of patients to be followed up for final outcomes (24 months).  Also, there was 
an important time gap in rollover between trials 204 and 208 (with delamanid interruption of at least 2 
months for 50% and up to 4 months for > 38 % of enrolled subjects in trial 208).  As such, the reliability 
of the additional integrated analyses is questioned.  Thus, the strength of the evidence of delamanid 
efficacy on long-term, is limited by the lack of a direct and sound proof of continuous benefit for at least 
6 months, since study 208 is biased by the inadequate design. 
However, the CHMP took into consideration that, the experts concurred that indeed two months SCC 
could be a proxy for long term outcome in MDR-TB.  The value of 2 months SCC as important prognostic 
factor for outcome has been proposed in several studies, such as the one discussed by Ahuja SD et al. 
(2012).  
Notwithstanding the uncertainties and limitations of data from the submitted literature references and 
the additional meta-analysis, the CHMP considered that, on balance, the SCC results obtained in trial 
204 can be regarded as sufficient demonstration of therapeutic effect in a superiority setting.  CHMP 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 126/140 
 
 
 
 
  
  
considers the following measure necessary to address the missing longer term efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
 “completion and submission of the final study result of the ongoing confirmatory trial examining 
delamanid added to optimal background regimen in licensed indication (Phase 3 trial comparing 
delamanid 100 mg BID for 2 months + 200 mg QD for 4 months plus OBR for 18-24 months versus OBR 
for 18-24 months with placebo for the first 6 months)”. 
Ground 2 
It is appreciated that data obtained from double-blind, randomized trial 204 fully informed the selection 
of dosage for use of delamanid.  The applicant performed various analyses to demonstrate that 
delamanid assessed at 100 mg and 200 mg twice daily, showed similar results for all efficacy endpoints.  
The applicant argues that exposures from both dose regimens were above the threshold for maximum 
efficacy and no association between increased plasma exposure and increased efficacy was observed.  
Doubling of the daily dose, therefore, would not give added benefit and could potentially increase risk for 
patients on MDR-TB therapy.  It is also argued that the analyses of trial 204 demonstrate the consistency 
of the delamanid benefit compared to placebo across all regions and the extent of resistance. 
The CHMP considered that doubts remain if the 100mg twice daily dosing constitutes the optimal 
schedule.   It is re-iterated that mortality outcomes at month 24 by initial randomization pointed towards 
a higher effect of 200 mg bid versus placebo and 100 mg bid, noting however the caveat that the long 
term data are potentially biased as no randomization took place.   
Also considering the recommendation obtained from the expert group, the CHMP concludes that, 
although the currently proposed dose schedule is acceptable within the context of conditional Marketing 
Authorisation, a higher dose should be appropriately studied to better define optimal exposure-response 
relationship and impact on emergence of bacterial resistance, whilst taking account of the safety 
considerations, in particular the effect on QTc interval, expected with higher plasma exposure (and in 
context of combination with other potentially pro-arrhythmic therapeutic agents).  
In consequence, to resolve the uncertainties around exposure and antimycobacterial activity, by 
conducting a further study exploring the relationship between different doses with respect to 2 months 
SCC and longer term outcome, the CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address the 
missing efficacy data in the context of a conditional MA: 
“a post-authorization controlled study of the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of delamanid 100 mg 
twice daily for 2 months followed by delamanid 200 mg in a single daily dose for 4 months or delamanid 
400 mg single daily dose for 6 months in adult patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis 
to be conducted, based on a CHMP-agreed protocol”.   
5.5.  Pharmacovigilance

6.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
During 8 weeks treatment with delamanid 100 mg or 200 mg twice daily in the Phase 2 study 
(242-07-204), a higher proportion of subjects with pulmonary tuberculosis caused by organisms that 
were at least resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid achieved sputum culture conversion (SCC) compared 
to the placebo group: in 45%, 42% and 30% in those treated with 100 mg bid, 200 mg bid and placebo, 
respectively; for patients with XDR-TB these figures were 4/24 (17%), 5/18 (28%) and 2/27 (7%). 
As such, the magnitude of the difference vs. placebo in the MITT population varied by dose group, 
MDR-TB vs. XDR-TB, presence of cavitation, region and whether the analyses were based on MGIT or 
solid culture media results. 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 132/140 
 
 
 
 
  
  
It is noted that delamanid for ≥6 months (any combination of doses) yielded a sustained culture 
conversion in 91% of patients with MDR-TB (130/143), and in 78% (31/40) in those with XDR-TB.  
Delamanid showed to be significantly active over the short term period and overall data point towards its 
incremental value as part of an optimal treatment regimen in MDR-TB. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The comparison between delamanid and placebo was restricted to 8 weeks only.  In addition, the data 
to Week 8 are clearly subject to influence according to region/site, at least part of which reflects the 
rates of XDR-TB.  
The open-label data from 208/116 reflect patient decisions to continue with open-label treatment, 
investigator decisions to change the dose and willingness of patients to be followed up for final 
outcomes.  Data from studies 208/116 do not address the essential deficiencies of study 204 and the 
available data cannot confirm the appropriateness of the applicant’s proposed dose regimen for 
delamanid.  However, data from literature and collaborative research data provides sufficient arguments 
that 2-month SCC be associated with better long term clinical outcome.   
Whilst awaiting results from confirmatory trials, it can be considered, based on preliminary evidence, 
that the addition of delamanid to the armamentarium in an area of unmet medical need will be 
beneficial.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The overall safety profile of delamanid is considered acceptable despite the fact that the size of the 
safety database is currently limited.  
Delamanid is associated with prolongation of the QTc interval that is driven predominantly but not wholly 
by plasma levels of a major metabolite DM-6705.  However, no torsades de pointes or any other major 
cardiac arrhythmia have been observed.  Use with other medicinal products affecting QTc interval has 
been addressed in the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The total safety database, consisting of two delamanid dose groups and placebo in the first study and 
uncontrolled use of delamanid in the second study, is limited.  
There are still missing data regarding interactions with transporters, which has important implications 
for potential drug-drug interactions.  
The potential for delamanid to be associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity is uncertain and 
requires further characterisation. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The efficacy in terms of sputum culture conversion of the two investigated doses (100 mg BID and 200 
mg BID) was superior to placebo, but the duration of comparison was too short. The results of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/55567/2014 
Page 133/140 
 
 
  
  
follow-on studies are difficult to interpret.  These data cannot address the essential deficiencies of study 
204 and the available results cannot confirm the appropriateness of the applicant’s proposed dose 
regimen for delamanid.  However, recent data from literature and collaborative research data provide 
sufficient arguments that 2-month SCC obtained in trial 204 be correlated with better long term clinical 
outcome.  Uncertainty remains on the most appropriate daily dosing schedule. 
The main safety issue observed with delamanid relates to QT-prolongation, albeit no associated cases of 
ventricular tachycardia /torsades de pointes were observed.  Further on, hepatotoxic potential cannot be 
dismissed. 
Benefit risk balance 
MDR-TB is a public health problem for which only limited treatment options are available.  MDR-TB 
patients generally require treatment with a combination of at least 5-6 “second-line” anti-TB 
medications for up to 24 months. The current treatment success rate for MDR-TB patients is deemed 
inadequate, with a sizable proportion of patients dying, failing treatment or lost to follow-up. Hence, it 
has been recognised that new medicinal products are urgently needed, in order to improve overall 
outcome in MDR-TB patients.  The development programme of delamanid aims to respond to this unmet 
medical need. 
Based on current evidence, the benefit-risk balance of Deltyba indicated for the treatment of pulmonary 
infections in adults due to multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis as part of an appropriate 
combination regimen (Deltyba is not recommended for use in the treatment of extra pulmonary 
tuberculosis [e.g. central nervous system, bone], latent infection with M. tuberculosis, drug-susceptible 
M. tuberculosis or infections due to Mycobacterial species other than those of the M. tuberculosis 
complex) could be deemed favourable for a limited indication only.    It should be restricted for use as 
part of an appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in 
adult patients when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of 
resistance or tolerability. This position takes into account the limited evidence of efficacy to support the 
proposed posology. 
The benefit/risk of using Delamanid is to be acceptable only under following strict conditions: 
- 
- 
- 
be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the management of multi-drug resistant 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis  
an appropriate combination regimen should continue after completion of the 24-week delamanid 
treatment period according to WHO guidelines  
serum albumin < 2.8 mg/dL or taking medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A, 
constitute contra-indications. 
It is recommended that treatment be administered by directly observed therapy (DOT). 
Further data are requested before the CHMP would consider whether those recommendations can be 
altered.  CHMP is of the opinion that information from the planned post authorisation measures is 
essential to determine the full scope of safety and efficacy at chosen dosing regimen.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
MDR-TB is defined as TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is resistant to at least isoniazid and 
rifampicin.   It represents a significant unmet medical need in Europe and developing countries. MDR-TB 
is associated with a considerable mortality rate and poses a significant public health threat. New 
medicinal products that can be used in combination with existing therapies are therefore much needed.

EMA/55567/2014

Delamanid, a nitro-dihydro-imidazo-oxazole derivative, provides a novel mechanism of action.  It has 
been developed for clinical use against MDR strains of M. tuberculosis, as part of combination therapy. 
Efficacy results (superiority outcome) were obtained in phase-2 pivotal trial 242-07-204.  All patients 
were diagnosed for pulmonary, sputum culture positive MDR-TB and received an optimal background 
regimen (OBR). Patients were randomised into 3 groups and received 100 mg BID delamanid, 200 mg 
BID delamanid, or placebo, in combination with OBR (BID), and sputum culture status was assessed 
weekly; SCC was measured after 2 months of treatment.   
Following completion of trial 242-07-204, patients were eligible for participation in the uncontrolled 
open-label trial 242-07-208 and received up to an additional 6 months treatment (or first-time 6 months 
for patients randomised to the placebo group in trial 242-07-204) with delamanid 100 mg BID or 200 mg 
BID during their course of 24 months MDR-TB treatment with OBR.  
Unfortunately, study 242-07-208 does not allow for an assessment of SCC rates vs. placebo over the 
applicant’s proposed 6 months duration of use.  As such, the strength of the evidence of delamanid 
efficacy on long-term, is limited by the lack of a direct and sound proof of continuous benefit for at least 
6 months, since study 208 is biased by the inadequate design.  However, the value of 2 months SCC as 
important prognostic factor for longer term outcome has been proposed in several published analyses.  
Re-examining all submitted data, and taking account of the position expressed by the expert group, the 
CHMP considers that notwithstanding the uncertainties and limitations of the data and further analyses, 
the limited evidence provided to date could be acceptable within the context of a conditional MA, subject 
to forthcoming confirmatory results from the phase 3 trial, necessary to address the missing longer term 
efficacy data.  
In re-examining the submitted data, the CHMP confirmed that doubts remain if the 100mg twice daily 
dosing constitutes the optimal schedule.  A total daily higher dose might be more appropriate, preferably 
within the context of once daily administration (which facilitates DOT practice). The CHMP concludes 
that, although the currently proposed dose schedule is acceptable within the context of conditional 
Marketing Authorisation, a higher dose (as once daily administration) should be appropriately explored 
to better define the optimal exposure-response and impact on emergence of bacterial resistance.   
The adverse events profile for Delamanid has been established in a limited safety database, comprising 
approximately 900 individuals.  Delamanid was generally well tolerated.   However, potential 
hepatoxicity cannot be fully dismissed.  The predominant concern regarding use of delamanid is the 
effect on QTc.  Hypoalbuminaemia (particularly below 2.8 mg/dl) is identified as a major contributing 
factor.  
Based on the totality of available data and the view expressed by the experts during the re-examination 
of delamanid MAA, the CHMP concludes that a positive benefit-risk balance of this medicinal product can 
be established, recommending the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation.  This position takes 
into account that further confirmatory data will become available within a specified timeframe; that 
delamanid fulfils an unmet medical need and that the benefit to public health of the immediate 
availability on the market of delamanid outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are 
still required.

7.  Recommendations following re-examination 
Based on the arguments of the applicant and all the supporting data on quality, safety and efficacy, the 
CHMP re-examined its initial opinion and in its final opinion concluded by majority decision that the 
risk-benefit balance of Deltyba “indicated for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for 
pulmonary multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adult patients when an effective treatment 
regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or tolerability. 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.”

DIVERGENT POSITION EXPRESSED BY CHMP MEMBERS 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the granting of 
a conditional Marketing Authorisation for Deltyba. 
The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
Although the undersigned acknowledged that there is an unmet clinical need for new medicinal products 
for the treatment of multi-resistant (MDR) and extensive resistant (XDR) tuberculosis, they cannot 
support the approval of Deltyba in this indication MDR-TB for the following reasons. 
1.  The appropriate dose to be used has not been defined and there are concerns that a higher daily 
dose might be necessary to achieve full efficacy. The currently proposed dose might therefore 
result in sub-optimal cure rates and encourage the development of microbiological resistance. 
2.  The data package submitted showed a treatment effect over just 2 months on sputum culture 
conversion and it has not been established that clinical efficacy would be maintained over the 
proposed 6 months treatment period. 
Considering these uncertainties in life threatening conditions, the undersigned do not agree with the 
CHMP majority opinion.

1.  Introduction 
On 12 July 2019, the MAH submitted data from a completed paediatric study for Nimenrix, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are submitted as part of this post-authorisation measure (PAM) P46/054. 
A short overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study MenACWY-TT-099 is a stand-alone study. 
In addition to this study, two other studies have recently been completed, MenACWY-TT-100 
(C0921004) under review at the time of submission of P46/054 (procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002226/P46/053) and an adult study MenACWYTT-101 (C0921005). All these studies 
assessed long-term antibody persistence up to 10 years after vaccination with MenACWY-TT, or 
comparator vaccine and the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT 
administered 10 years after primary vaccination. After complete data from all three of these studies 
are available, Pfizer proposes to submit a variation to update the SmPC with long term antibody 
persistence and booster data based on the complete data set from these studies. Pfizer anticipates 
submitting this variation in either September or October 2019. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study.

2.3.1.  Introduction 
• 
Protocol MenACWY-TT-099 (C0921002); formerly GlaxoSmithKline 116725 
A Phase IIIb, Open, Multi-Center Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Antibody Persistence at 6, 7, 8, 9 
and 10 Years After the Administration of One Dose of Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine MenACWY-TT 
Versus 1 Dose of Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine Mencevax® ACWY, and to Evaluate the Safety 
and Immunogenicity of a Booster Dose of MenACWY-TT Vaccine Administered 10 Years After Primary 
Vaccination of 11-55 Year Old Subjects With MenACWY-TT or Mencevax® ACWY. 
Study MenACWY-TT-099 (C0921002) was an extended follow-up study to evaluate antibody 
persistence 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 years after primary vaccination.  In the original study, MenACWY-TT-015 
(107386), 500 healthy subjects between 11 and 55 years of age were randomized using a 3:1 ratio to 
receive either a single dose of the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY-TT (ACWY-
TT group) or the meningococcal quadrivalent polysaccharide vaccine Mencevax ACWY (MenPS group).  
Antibody persistence was evaluated up to 5 years after vaccination in extension studies MenACWY-TT-
016 through -020. The primary vaccination study MenACWY-TT-015 was conducted in Saudi Arabia 
and in the Philippines.  Study MenACWY-TT-099 was conducted only in the Philippines.  The study 
provides a summary of the immunogenicity and safety results up to 10 years after vaccination. Results

are also presented for evaluations of the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT 
administered to all eligible subjects 10 years after the primary vaccination.

Study MenACWY-TT-099  
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The main purpose of this study was to evaluate antibody persistence 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 years after 
primary vaccination with MenACWY-TT as compared to Mencevax ACWY when given to healthy 
participants 11 to 55 years of age. The safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT 
administered to all participants 10 years after the primary vaccination was evaluated

Booster starting at Visit 5 (Month 120 [Year 10] after primary vaccination) and ending at the phone 
contact visit (Month 126 or 6 months after booster vaccination).  
There were 2 parallel groups in this study: 
•  ACWY-TT group: all participants vaccinated with MenACWY-TT in Study MenACWY-TT-015 
(107386) 
•  MenPS group: all participants vaccinated with Mencevax ACWY in Study MenACWY-TT-015 
(107386) 
Four hundred (400) subjects (299 in the ACWY-TT group and 101 in the MenPS group) were enrolled 
and vaccinated in Study MenACWY-TT-015 (107386) in the Philippines. The subjects who completed 
the vaccination phase of Study MenACWY-TT-015 (107386) and received either MenACWY-TT or 
Mencevax ACWY were eligible for this study if they met the inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria. 
Participants were followed up for 5 years after vaccination. The subjects were allowed to return at any 
visit during the persistence phase. 
Study design 
Study MenACWY-TT-099 (C0921002) was a Phase 3b, open-label study with 2 parallel groups that was 
designed to evaluate the persistence of meningococcal antibodies 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 years after 
primary vaccination with MenACWY-TT or Mencevax ACWY in Study MenACWY-TT-015. However, the 
Year 6 study visit was not completed, and thus there are no data for Year 6.  At 10 years after primary 
vaccination, a booster dose of MenACWY-TT was administered to subjects in both vaccine groups, and 
the immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of the booster dose was evaluated. 
All subjects who completed the vaccination phase of Study MenACWY-TT-015 were eligible for Study 
MenACWY-TT-099 if they met the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  During the 
persistence phase of the study, subjects attended visits once a year, when blood samples were drawn 
for determination of antibody titers at the following time points: Year 7 (Month 84); Year 8 (Month 
96); Year 9 (Month 108); Year 10 (Month 120).  At the Year 10 visit, subjects received a single booster 
dose of MenACWY-TT and returned 1 month later for a blood draw for determination of antibody titers.  
Bactericidal activity was measured by serum bactericidal assays using rabbit complement (rSBA) to 
measure activity against Neisseria meningitidis group A (rSBA-MenA), group C (rSBA- MenC), group 
W-135 (rSBA-MenW-135), and group Y (rSBA-MenY). 
At each persistence phase visit, serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study participation, fatal 
SAEs, SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study, and any occurrence of meningococcal disease were 
to be reported.  Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) and pregnancies were reported from the time of 
booster vaccination through the 31-day postbooster visit.  Solicited local events (pain, redness, 
swelling) and solicited general events (fever ≥37.5°C, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, and 
headache) were recorded daily in a diary for 4 days after the vaccination. Serious adverse events, 
new-onset chronic illnesses (NOCIs), and Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS) were reported from the time 
of booster vaccination through the 6-month follow-up telephone contact. 
Study population /Sample size 
A total of 311 subjects were enrolled in the study: 235 in the ACWY-TT group and 76 in the MenPS 
group. Mean age at enrollment was 25.2 years; approximately 48% of subjects were female, and all 
subjects were of Asian/Southeast Asian heritage.  The proportions of subjects attending each of the 
annual visits were approximately 93% at Year 7, 90% at Year 8, 82% at Year 9, and 74% at Year 10.  
Overall, 80 subjects (approximately 26%) withdrew from the study during the persistence phase, with

the most frequent reasons for withdrawal being moved from study area (41 subjects) and “other 
reason” (30 subjects); the most common “other reasons” cited for withdrawal were a busy work 
schedule, conflict with work schedule, or ineligibility as per eligibility criteria.  A total of 220 subjects 
received the booster dose: 164 in the ACWY-TT group and 56 in the MenPS group, and 5 subjects were 
withdrawn from the study during the booster phase (due to ‘moved from area’ or lost to follow-up).

Statistical Methods 
The analysis cohorts: 
Total Cohort at Year X 
• 
•  According-to-protocol (ATP) Cohort for Persistence at Year X 
•  Adapted ATP Cohort (denotes, for each time point, that subjects belong to the corresponding 
ATP Cohort for Immunogenicity or persistence at that time point) 
Total Enrolled Cohort 
• 
•  Booster Total Vaccinated Cohort at Year 10 
•  Booster ATP Cohort for Safety at Year 10 
•  Booster ATP Cohort for Immunogenicity at Year 10 
Analysis of Persistence 
For each Year X: The analysis of antibody persistence was based on the ATP cohort for antibody 
persistence at Year X. If, for any vaccine group, the percentage of subjects who come back for the 
Year X follow-up with serological results excluded from the ATP cohort is higher than 5%, a second 
analysis based on the total cohort at Year X was performed to complement the ATP analysis.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/599680/2019  
Page 7/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For each vaccine group, at each blood sampling time point in Study MenACWY-TT-099, for each 
antigen assessed: 
•  GMTs with 95% CIs will be tabulated. 
• 
Percentages of subjects with titers above the proposed cut-offs with exact 95% Cis will be 
calculated. 
• 
The distribution of antibody titers will be tabulated and also presented using reverse 
cumulative distribution curves. 
In addition, the following analyses will also be performed by age stratum: 
•  GMTs with 95% CIs will be tabulated. 
• 
Percentages of subjects with titers above the proposed cut-offs with exact 95% Cis will be 
calculated. 
•  Geometric mean anti-TT concentrations (GMCs) with 95% CIs will be tabulated. 
Modelling prediction 
In order to complement the descriptive analyses of observed persistence per time point and minimize 
the bias that may have occurred due to the loss to follow-up after the vaccination, a longitudinal 
analysis will be performed at the last time point for rSBA-MenA, C, W-135, and Y at Year 10.The 
longitudinal analyses will include all titers from: 
• 
• 
• 
The pre- and post-primary vaccination analysis (Month 0 and Month 1 in Study MenACWY-TT-
015) for subjects belonging in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity defined in Study MenACWY-
TT-015. 
Year 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (in Study MenACWY-TT-016, -017,- 018,- 019, and -020 respectively) 
for subjects belonging in the ATP cohort for persistence defined in each study respectively, and 
Year 7, 8, 9, and 10 (in Study MenACWY-TT-099) for subjects belonging in the ATP cohort for 
persistence at Year 7 (Month 84) up to Year 10 (Month 120), respectively. 
Note that since the Year 6 (Month 72) visit was not done the ATP cohort for persistence at Year 6 is not 
applicable. A longitudinal model taking into account the vaccine group, age cohort, and all available 
immunogenicity time points from pre-primary time point (in Study MenACWY-TT-015)  until the last 
persistence time point at Year 10 (in Study MenACWY-TT-099) will be fitted. This model will be 
primarily aimed at evaluating the selection effect in the group and the time points will be considered as 
categorical. 
MenACWY-TT Antibody Response 
Bactericidal antibodies specific for meningococcal antigens are recognized as surrogate markers of 
protection against meningococcal disease. A serum bactericidal assay using rabbit complement (rSBA) 
with a cut-off of 1:8 was shown to be the most consistent with observed efficacy at 4 weeks after 
vaccination with the meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine in post-licensure efficacy estimates in 
the United Kingdom. Following common practice, the 1:8 cut-off for the rSBA to measure activity 
against N. meningitidis group C (rSBA-MenC) was extended for rSBA to measure activity against N. 
meningitidis group A (rSBA-MenA), rSBA to measure activity against N. meningitidis group W-135 
(rSBA-MenW-135), and rSBA to measure activity against N. meningitidis group Y  (rSBA-MenY). 
Functional anti-meningococcal serogroup bactericidal activity (ie, rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-
MenW-135, and rSBA-MenY) was determined by an rSBA according to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) protocol.11 rSBA titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum 
last dilution resulting in at least a 50% reduction of meningococcal colony-forming units.

Baseline data 
Efficacy results 
The mean GMTs observed for rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenW-135, and rSBA-MenY were higher in the ACWY-
TT group in comparison to the MenPS group. GMTs for rSBA-MenC were similar for both vaccine 
groups. GMTs remained generally similar across all time-points in the persistence phase for both 
vaccine groups. 
The numbers and percentages of subjects with rSBA titers greater than or equal to 1:8 and 1:128 and 
GMTs for the total enrolled cohort were similar to those observed for the adapted ATP cohort. 
In the ACWY-TT vaccine group, the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-
135, and rSBA-MenY titers ≥1:8 increased from 71.4% to 90.9% at Month 120 to 100.0% at Month 
121 (1 month after booster vaccination). In the MenPS vaccine group, the percentage of subjects with 
rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135, andrSBA-MenY titers ≥1:8 increased from 21.2% to 88.5% 
at Month 120 to 98.1% to 100.0% at Month 121 (1 month after booster vaccination). 
The mean GMTs observed at 1 month after booster vaccination were greater in the ACWY-TT group in 
comparison to the MenPS group, particularly for rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135, and rSBA-MenY.

Estimated rSBA Predicted by Modeling 
rSBA GMTs were predicted by modeling for pre-vaccination and postvaccination (1 month) time points 
(from Study MenACWY-TT-015 [107386]) and Months 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 84, 96, 108, and 120 after 
primary vaccination. For both vaccine groups the estimated GMTs at Months 84 to 120 were generally 
similar to the observed values, with no indication of bias caused by subjects lost to follow-up during 
the persistence phase. 
Immune Response to MenACWY-TT Anti-TT Concentration ≥0.1 IU/mL and ≥1.0 IU/mL and GMCs 
A secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the percentage of subjects with anti-TT 
concentrations ≥0.1 IU/mL and ≥1.0 IU/mL and geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) before and 1 
month after booster vaccination. 
Between Month 120 and Month 121 (1 month after booster vaccination), the percentage of subjects 
with anti-TT concentrations ≥0.1 IU/mL increased from 86.5% to 99.4% in the ACWY-TT group, and 
from 61.5% to 98.1% in the MenPS group. Similarly, the percentage of subjects with anti-TT 
concentrations ≥1.0 IU/mL increased from 44.5% to 94.8% in the ACWY-TT group, and from 23.1% to 
88.5% in the MenPS group. 
Immunogenicity Conclusions 
In general, vaccine meningococcal antibodies persisted from Months 84 to 120 after primary 
vaccination with MenACWY-TT or Mencevax ACWY. The percentage of subjects with rSBA titers greater 
than or equal to the cut-off values (1:8 and 1:128) and GMTs for the adapted ATP cohort remained 
generally stable across all time points. The persistence of the rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenW-135, and rSBA-
MenY immune response was generally higher for subjects in the ACWY-TT group in comparison to the 
MenPS group. The persistence of the rSBA-MenC immune response over time was similar for the 
ACWY-TT and MenPS groups. 
The mean GMTs observed for rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenW-135, and rSBA-MenY were higher in the ACWY-
TT group in comparison to the MenPS group. GMTs for rSBA-MenC were similar for both vaccine 
groups. 
For subjects who received a booster vaccination 10 years after the primary vaccination, a robust 
booster vaccination response was observed. In both the ACWY-TT and MenPS groups, the percentage 
of subjects with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135, and rSBA-MenY titers ≥1:8 increased from 
21.1% to 90.9% at Month 120 to 98.1% to 100.0% at Month 121 (1 month after booster vaccination). 
The GMTs observed in response to booster vaccination were greater in the ACWY-TT group in 
comparison to the MenPS group, particularly for rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135, and rSBA-MenY. 
The percentage of subjects in the ACWY-TT and MenPS groups with anti-TT antibody concentrations ≥
0.1 IU/mL increased from 86.5% and 61.5% at Month 120 to 99.4% and 98.1% at Month 121, 
respectively. 
No clinically relevant differences were observed in vaccine response between subjects who were 
initially seronegative and those who were initially seropositive before the booster vaccination. 
Safety results 
Solicited local and general events (pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site; and fatigue, fever, 
gastrointestinal events [nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain], and headache) were 
monitored and recorded by subjects on diary cards for 4 days after the booster vaccination.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

The proportion of subjects reporting pain was similar in both vaccine groups (27.0% versus 26.4% in 
the ACWY-TT and MenPS groups, respectively), and the majority of these events were mild in severity.  
Few subjects in either vaccine group reported redness (5.7% versus 3.8% in the ACWY-TT and MenPS 
groups, respectively) or swelling (3.8% versus 5.7% in the ACWY-TT and MenPS groups, respectively) 
at the injection site. 
Most solicited general events were mild in severity.  The proportion of subjects reporting solicited 
general events in the ACWY-TT and MenPS vaccine groups was 14.5% and 15.1% for fatigue, 6.9% 
and 5.7% for fever, 4.4% and 1.9% for gastrointestinal events, and 15.7% and 9.4% for headache, 
respectively.  Grade 3 solicited general events occurred within the ACWY TT group, with 1 report of 
Grade 3 fatigue (0.6%), 1 report of Grade 3 gastrointestinal event (0.6%), and 2 reports of Grade 3 
headache (1.3%); all were assessed as being related to the investigational vaccine by the investigator. 
The proportion of subjects reporting at least 1 AE during the 31-day post-booster vaccination period 
was 9.1% (15 subjects) in the ACWY-TT group and 3.6% (2 subjects) in the MenPS group. Most 
reported unsolicited AEs were in the system organ class (SOC) of infections and infestations (7 [4.3%] 
in the ACWY-TT group and 2 [3.6%] in the MenPS group). 
Three AEs in the ACWY-TT group were assessed as being related to the investigational vaccine (1 
report each of dizziness, hypoesthesia, and oropharyngeal pain), and none of the AEs in the MenPS 
group were assessed as being related to the investigational vaccine. 
No related Grade 3 AEs were reported during this study. 
No deaths, SAEs, NOCIs, or other significant AEs (including GBS or meningococcal disease) were 
reported during the study, and no subjects were withdrawn from the study due to safety-related 
reasons. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Antibody persistence at Years 7 to 10 after primary vaccination was higher among subjects primed 
with MenACWY-TT compared with subjects primed with Mencevax ACWY, as measured by the 
percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenW-135, and rSBA-Men-Y titers greater than or equal 
to predefined cutoff values. Antibody persistence for MenC was similar for both vaccine groups. While a 
robust MenACWY-TT booster vaccination response was observed in both vaccine groups, greater GMTs 
were observed in subjects primed with MenACWY-TT compared with subjects primed with Mencevax 
ACWY at 1 month after booster vaccination. 
No new safety concerns or adverse reactions for Nimenrix were identified in this long-term persistence 
study of subjects 11 to 55 years of age who received a primary vaccination of either MenACWY-TT or 
Mencevax ACWY (Study MenACWY-TT-015 [107386]) and who subsequently received a booster dose 
of MenACWY-TT 10 years after primary vaccination. 
Overall, the results of the analysis at 7 to 10 years after primary vaccination and up to 6 months after 
booster vaccination continue to support a favourable benefit-risk assessment of MenACWY-TT in this 
age group.

3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The percentage of subjects with rSBA titers ≥1:8 or ≥1:128 and GMTs at time points 7, 8, 9 and 10 
years after the primary vaccination are quite stable. No hSBA data are available from this study, or 
from the previous reports from the primary vaccination or previous extension studies. There is a good 
consistency in the rSBA data from PHE (Public Health England) from year 4 after the primary 
vaccination through the years 7-10.  Based on a smaller sample size analysed by PHE from 1 month 
after the primary vaccination and year 1 and 2, it is evident that the largest drop in rSBA is seen the 
two first years after the primary dose.   
Study TT-99 shows that a booster dose of Nimenrix administered 10 years after primary vaccination in 
adolescents and adults 11-55 years of age elicited a robust immune responses against each of the 4 
serogroups.   
Safety results demonstrate that the booster dose was well tolerated, and no new safety concerns were 
identified.   
CHMP agrees that the data from Study MenACWY-TT-99 do not change the benefit-risk profile of 
Nimenrix.  
Long-term antibody persistence data up to 10 years after primary vaccination in 1-10 year old subjects 
with Nimenrix and the effect of a booster dose (MenACWY-TT-100) was recently reviewed (procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002226/P46/053). Study (MenACWY-TT-99) provides the same type of data in   adolescents 
and adults 11-55 years of age. In addition, an adult study MenACWYTT-101 is expected to be received 
for a review. The MAH Pfizer proposes to submit a variation to update the SmPC with long-term 
antibody persistence and booster data based on the complete data set from these three studies.  
The task for the MAH will be closed when the variation application to update the SmPC is assessed and 
finalised. 
  Fulfilled: 
No further action required.  
However, further data are expected in the context of a variation prior to any conclusion on product 
information amendments being made. The MAH is expected to submit this variation application when 
study MenACWYTT-101 has been reviewed.

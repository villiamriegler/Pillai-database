Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Simponi 
golimumab 
On 13 December 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending changes to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Simponi. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Janssen Biologics B.V. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to one of the existing indications for Simponi 50 mg solution for injection in 
pre-filled pens and syringes as follows:2 
“Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) 
Simponi in combination with MTX is indicated for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis in children 2 years of age and older with a body weight of at least 40 kg, who have 
responded inadequately to previous therapy with MTX.” 
In addition, the CHMP recommended approval of a new formulation of Simponi, a 45 mg/0.45 ml solution for 
injection in pre-filled pens, for the above indication. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

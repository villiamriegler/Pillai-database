Chemical class: Elacestrant is a tetrahydronaphthalene compound that acts as 
a selective estrogen receptor (ER) degrader. 
Summary of mode of action: Elacestrant binds with high affinity and 
selectivity to the ERα. In the presence of 17β-estradiol (E2), elacestrant 
shows dose-dependent antagonism of E2-mediated stimulation of MCF7 
breast cancer cell proliferation through down-regulation and degradation of 
the ER.  
Important information about its composition: The drug product is an 
immediate release film-coated tablet containing elacestrant. 
Please refer to Module 1.3.1 for the proposed Product Information. 
Current: ORSERDU monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of 
postmenopausal women, and men, with ER-positive, HER2-negative, locally 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer with an activating ESR1 mutation who 
have disease progression following at least one line of endocrine therapy 
including a CDK4/6 inhibitor.

PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
Part II: Module SI - Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population(s) 
Indication: ORSERDU monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women, 
and men, with ER-positive, HER2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with an 
activating ESR1 mutation who have disease progression following at least one line of endocrine 
therapy including a CDK4/6 inhibitor. 
Incidence/prevalence: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths in women 
(Bray et al., 2018). Worldwide, there were 2.3 million new cases and over 685000 deaths from 
breast cancer in 2020 (Bray et al., 2018; WHO 2021). In comparison, breast cancer in men is very 
rare, occurring in < 1% of the total number of cancer cases. Nevertheless, the American Cancer 
Society estimates that there will be 2650 new cases of invasive breast cancer in men, and about 
530 men will die from breast cancer in 2021 (Breastcancer.org 2021a). 
In the United States (US) and Europe, improved treatments are prolonging survival and 
improving quality of life but, in the US, the death rate for women’s breast cancer remains 2nd 
only to lung cancer. Furthermore, preventive methods are not abolishing new cases; breast 
cancers account for approximately 30% of all newly diagnosed cancers among US women 
(Breastcancer.org 2021b). Approximately 330840 (approximately 281550 invasive and 
approximately 49290 noninvasive or in situ) new cases were expected for 2021, while an 
estimated 43600 American women will die from the disease during this same period 
(Breastcancer.org 2021b). For European women, there were approximately 576300 new cases 
and, concurrently, approximately 157100 deaths from breast cancer in 2020 (Europa Donna 
2021). Mortality rate predictions across Europe are expected to reach relatively uniform levels in 
2025. The largest predicted decrease in breast cancer mortality was estimated for the United 
Kingdom (12.2 in 100000 women in 2025), leading to the estimated avoidance of 150000 breast 
cancer deaths over the period of 1994 to 2025 and 470000 in the rest of Europe (Wojtyla et al., 
2021). 
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication and risk factors for the disease: 
The number of risk factors (including demographics) for breast cancer is significant and includes 
both modifiable and nonmodifiable factors, as listed below (Łukasiewicz et al., 2021).

EU Risk Management Plan – Version 1.0 
ORSERDU (Elacestrant; RAD1901) 
Nonmodifiable risk factors are discussed below. 
Age: Currently, about 75% to 80% of breast cancer cases occur in individuals aged > 50 years, 
with an incidence of < 5% in people aged up to 35 years (Dafni et al., 2019; Łukasiewicz et al., 
2021). European demographic trends show an aging population, with a median age of 41.9 years 
compared to the world median age of 29.2 years. Thus, the aging population in Europe will 
result in a further increase in the burden of breast cancer and its impact on public health (Dafni 
et al., 2019). 
Gender: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths in women (Bray et al., 
2018). Being a woman is a major risk factor due to the enhanced hormonal stimulation. A 
woman’s breast cells are very vulnerable to hormones, as well as any disruptions in their 
balance. 
Increases in circulating sex hormones of hormones in pre- and postmenopausal women results 
in a higher risk of breast cancer (Łukasiewicz et al., 2021; Key et al., 2013). In comparison, 
breast cancer in men is very rare, occurring in < 1% of the total number of cancer cases 
(Breastcancer.org 2021a). 
Race and/or ethnicity: According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 
cancer query system searched between 2012 to 2016, age-adjusted incidence of breast cancer is 
highest in white women (103 per 100000 population). Incidence of age-adjusted breast cancer in 
black and Asian/Pacific Islander women is 98.6 and 81.3 per 100000 population, respectively. 
Breast cancer risk is lower in Hispanic women, with an age-adjusted incidence rate of 77.7 per 
100000 population (SEER 2022). However, the mortality rate due to breast cancer is 
significantly higher among black women; this group is also characterized by the lowest survival 
rates (ACS 2016). 
Family history: Family history is another major risk factor for breast cancer, with approximately 
13% to 19% of those diagnosed having a 1st-degree relative (eg, mother, sister, or daughter) 
who has or had breast cancer. Furthermore, the incidence rate of breast cancer is significantly 
higher in all patients with a family history, regardless of age (Łukasiewicz et al., 2021). 
Genetic mutations: The 2 major genes associated with increased risk of breast cancer are BRCA1 
(Breast Cancer gene 1) (located on chromosome 17) and BRCA2 (Breast Cancer gene 2) 
(located on chromosome 13) (Shiovitz and Korde 2015). The mutations within the above-
mentioned genes are mainly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however, sporadic 
mutations are also frequently reported (Łukasiewicz et al., 2021). 
Reproductive history: The occurrence of pregnancy, breastfeeding, 1st menstruation, and 
menopause, along with their duration and associated hormonal imbalance, are crucial in terms 
of potential carcinogenic events in the breast microenvironment. Women who have early 
menarche or late menopause have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. Nulliparous 
women and women who are older (e.g., > 30 years old) with their 1st birth may also have a 
greater chance of developing breast cancer (Łukasiewicz et al., 2021). 
Density of breast tissue: Generally, a greater breast tissue density correlates with a greater risk of 
breast cancer; this trend is observed both in pre- and postmenopausal women (Kim et al., 2020).

EU Risk Management Plan – Version 1.0 
ORSERDU (Elacestrant; RAD1901) 
History of breast cancer and benign breast diseases: A personal history of breast cancer is 
associated with a greater risk of renewed breast cancer (Schacht et al., 2014). In addition, 
benign breast diseases (eg, atypical hyperplasia) also significantly increase (4 to 5 times) the 
risk of breast cancer (Hartmann et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2004; McPherson et al., 2000). 
Previous radiation therapy: Children or young adults (< 30 years old) exposed to radiation 
therapy to the chest area have significantly increased risk of developing breast cancer later in 
life (Ronckers et al., 2005; Ng and Shuryak 2015). 
The main existing treatment options: Currently, recommended 1st-line standard of care (SOC) 
for locally advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer 
is endocrine therapy, with either aromatase inhibitors (AIs) or fulvestrant, plus a cyclin- 
dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor (NCCN 2021; Bentzon et al., 2008; Burstein et al., 
2021; Gennari et al., 2021). Once the disease progresses, there are limited therapeutics options. 
When the pivotal study (RAD1901-308) was initiated in 2018, treatment guidelines 
recommended the use of sequential endocrine therapy in the absence of visceral crisis or until all 
endocrine therapy options have been exhausted (NCCN 2018; NCCN 2021). Endocrine therapy 
includes endocrine monotherapy, such as fulvestrant, if the 1st-line therapy contained an AI- 
based therapy, or AIs if the 1st-line therapy applied a fulvestrant-based therapy (NCCN 2021; 
Burstein et al., 2021; Gennari et al., 2021). 
Fulvestrant is currently the only approved selective estrogen receptor degrader for the treatment 
of subjects with ER-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (Niikura et al., 2014). 
Fulvestrant effectively degrades ER and has demonstrated clinical benefit in ER-positive/HER2- 
negative metastatic breast cancer. A 500-mg monthly dose of fulvestrant, after a biweekly dose 
during the 1st month, in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who 
failed previous endocrine therapy was associated with a median progression-free survival (PFS) 
of 6.5 months (Di Leo et al., 2010). However, these data were generated prior to the approval of 
CDK4/6 inhibitors. Recently, data on fulvestrant monotherapy post CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment 
are starting to emerge. 
• 
• 
In a recent Phase 2 trial of 2nd- or 3rd-line venetoclax + fulvestrant versus fulvestrant 
alone in ER-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who experienced disease 
recurrence/progression during/after CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy (VERONICA study), 
treatment with fulvestrant as a single agent was associated with a median PFS of 1.94 
months and with a clinical benefit rate of 13.7% (Lindeman et al., 2021). 
In the plasmaMATCH Phase 2a clinical trial, high-dose fulvestrant was associated with a 
median PFS of 2.2 months and a clinical benefit rate of 16% among patients with a 
detectable estrogen receptor 1 gene (ESR1) mutation, where few subjects received prior 
CDK4/6 inhibitors (Turner et al., 2020). 
In addition to the need for effective treatment options for patients with 
ER-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer after progression on CDK4/6 inhibitors, the 
intramuscular route of administration of fulvestrant underscores the need for novel oral ER 
antagonists in this setting (Bihani et al., 2017). Although a long-acting intramuscular 
formulation of fulvestrant was approved, which can be administered monthly after 3 biweekly 
doses, the total volume of the injections per dose is 10 mL, a volume that is difficult to tolerate 
by some patients (Wardell et al., 2015).

EU Risk Management Plan – Version 1.0 
ORSERDU (Elacestrant; RAD1901) 
Available 2nd-line combination therapy options are everolimus + exemestane and everolimus + 
fulvestrant. For subjects with PIK3CA (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, 
catalytic subunit alpha)-mutant breast cancer, the combination of fulvestrant and alpelisib is 
another option. These combinations are associated with an approximate 25% treatment 
discontinuation rate because of adverse events in clinical studies (Alpelisib USPI; Everolimus 
USPI; Kornblum et al., 2018). 
In this context, next-generation, orally bioavailable selective estrogen receptor degraders with 
improved pharmacokinetic properties have garnered significant interest as novel therapies for 
ER-positive metastatic breast cancer (Bentzon et al., 2008; Gluck, 2014; McDonnell and 
Wardell, 2010; Osborne and Schiff, 2011). 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including mortality 
and morbidity: Breast cancer stage is usually expressed as a number on a scale of 0 through IV, 
as tabulated below (Cancer.net 2020). Mortality resulting from breast cancer is discussed earlier 
in this section, under incidence/prevalence. 
Table SI.2: Breast cancer stages 
Stage

Stage IB 
Stage IIA 
Description 
Disease is only in the ducts of the breast tissue and has not spread to the surrounding tissue of the 
breast. This is also called noninvasive or in situ cancer (Tis, N0, M0). 
The tumor is small, invasive, and has not spread to the lymph nodes (T1, N0, M0). 
The tumor has spread to the lymph nodes, and the tumor in the lymph node is larger than 0.2 mm 
but < 2 mm in size. There is either no evidence of a tumor in the breast or the tumor in the breast 
is 20 mm or smaller (T0 or T1, N1mi, M0). 
Any 1 of these conditions: 
•  There is no evidence of a tumor in the breast, but the cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary 
lymph nodes. It has not spread to distant parts of the body (T0, N1, M0). 
•  The tumor is 20 mm or smaller and has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes (T1, N1, M0). 
•  The tumor is larger than 20 mm but not larger than 50 mm and has not spread to the axillary 
lymph nodes (T2, N0, M0). 
Either of these conditions: 
•  The tumor is larger than 20 mm but not larger than 50 mm and has spread to 1 to 3 axillary 
Stage IIB 
lymph nodes (T2, N1, M0). 
•  The tumor is larger than 50 mm but has not spread to the axillary lymph nodes (T3, N0, 
M0). 
Stage IIIA 
Stage IIIB 
Stage IIIC 
Stage IV 
(metastatic) 
The tumor of any size has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes or to internal mammary lymph 
nodes. It has not spread to other parts of the body (T0, T1, T2, or T3; N2; M0). Stage IIIA may 
also be a tumor larger than 50 mm that has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes (T3, N1, M0). 
The tumor has spread to the chest wall or caused swelling or ulceration of the breast, or it is 
diagnosed as inflammatory breast cancer. It may or may not have spread to up to 9 axillary or 
internal mammary lymph nodes. It has not spread to other parts of the body (T4; N0, N1, or N2; 
M0). 
A tumor of any size that has spread to 10 or more axillary lymph nodes, the internal mammary 
lymph nodes, and/or the lymph nodes under the collarbone. It has not spread to other parts of the 
body (any T, N3, M0). 
The tumor can be any size and has spread to other organs, such as the bones, lungs, brain, liver, 
distant lymph nodes, or chest wall (any T, any N, M1). 
M = metastasis; mi = micrometastatic; N = node; T = Tumor; Tis = carcinoma in situ. 
Events that frequently occur in untreated patients with metastatic breast cancer are described 
below. These include events associated with the disease or with therapies.

EU Risk Management Plan – Version 1.0 
ORSERDU (Elacestrant; RAD1901) 
Bone metastases: Among breast cancer patients with distant metastases, bone is the most 
common site for metastasis (reported in 70.6% of patients) (Savci-Heijink et al., 2015). In a 
retrospective study of 35912 Danish patients with breast cancer, it was found that 4% of 
patients had bone metastases at the time of diagnosis or developed bone metastasis during 
follow-up (up to 5 years). Among these patients, 47.6% already had or went on to develop 
skeletal-related events, defined as pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, bone pain 
requiring palliative radiotherapy, and orthopedic surgery (Jensen et al., 2011). 
Hepatotoxicity/Liver metastases: Among breast cancer patients with distant metastases, liver is 
also a common site for metastasis (reported in 54.5% of patients) (Savci-Heijink et al 2015). In 
78.6% of cases, liver metastases are asymptomatic at the time of metastatic diagnosis. The 
remainder are symptomatic, presenting with epigastric pain or fullness (21.4%), palpable 
hepatomegaly (27.3%), and ascites (6.2%) (Wyld et al., 2003). 
Pulmonary metastases: Among breast cancer patients with distant metastases, 31.4% suffer lung 
metastasis (Savci-Heijink et al 2015). Metastasis to lung is associated with poor prognosis and 
presents with clinical symptoms such as pain, cough, hemoptysis, pleural effusion, and 
pulmonary dysfunction (Jin et al., 2018). 
Brain metastases: Brain metastases are found in 5.1% of patients with breast cancer (Barnholtz- 
Sloan et al., 2004; Pestalozzi et al., 2006). Headache (35%), vomiting (26%), nausea (23%), 
hemiparesis (22%), visual changes (13%), and seizures (12%) are the most common presentation 
with brain metastases (Rostami et al., 2016). In a retrospective study of clinical data of German 
patients with breast cancer who had brain metastasis, median overall survival time after brain 
metastasis development was reported as 7.4 months, with a 1-year survival rate of 37.7% (Witzel 
et al., 2018). 
Important comorbidities: The presence of comorbidities in patients with cancer has a negative 
association with health outcomes for patients. Poorer survival from cancer has been found 
overall in cancer survivors with comorbidities compared to those without. Whilst all women 
have risks for developing chronic illnesses or comorbidities due to aging; women who survive 
cancer are at risk for chronic conditions (such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, 
and decreased bone mass) not only because of aging, but sometimes due to the after effects of 
cancer treatment (Fu et al., 2015). In a prospective quality of life study in breast cancer 
survivors, Fu et al 2015 found that among 134 patients, 73.8% had at least 1 of comorbidity, 
54.7% had 2 to 4 comorbidities, and 7.4% had 5 to 8 comorbidities. The 5 most common 
comorbidities were hypertension (32.8%), arthritis (32.8%), thyroid problem (22.4%), 
hypercholesterolemia (12.7%), and diabetes (12.0%). In an observational study in patients 
being treated for breast cancer between January and December 2012, Sharma et al., 2016 found 
that the most common comorbidities were hypertension (21.8%), chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (19.9%), rheumatologic disease (18.6%), and diabetes mellitus (16.7%); all 
4 conditions were reported in more than 75% of the patients.

dyspepsia) have also been detected in patients.   
Table SII.1: Key safety findings from nonclinical studies and relevance to human usage 
Key safety findings from nonclinical studies 
Gastrointestinal toxicity 
Oral gavage of elacestrant treatment (30 and 100 mg/kg/day for 7 
days) resulted in emetic events (retching and vomiting) in ferrets, 
occurring more frequently at higher doses. The number of emesis 
observations following the 30 mg/kg dose decreased over time, 
suggesting tolerance to elacestrant over time. The 100 mg/kg 
dose was not tolerated.  
Findings in the gastrointestinal tract have been also observed in 
repeat dose toxicity studies: emesis has been observed in female 
monkeys, vacuolation of the mucosa of non-glandular stomach in 
both male and female rats, infiltrates of activated macrophages in 
the small intestine in both rats and monkeys. 
General toxicity 
Elacestrant displayed a low acute toxicity. The highest doses 
devoid of lethal effects were 900 and 500 mg/kg after a single 
oral administration in Sprague Dawley rats and cynomolgus 
monkeys, respectively. 
The results of repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats (up to 
26 weeks) and monkeys (up to 39 weeks) were relatively 
consistent across the studies and species. In both female 
rats and monkeys, atrophy of the uterus, cervix, and 
vagina and  increased ovary weight due to the presence 
of prominent ovarian cystic follicles were observed at all 
doses in studies lasting 4 weeks or longer at lower 
exposure levels than in humans. In rats, the increase in 
ovary weight was also associated with a decrease in 
pituitary weight. In the 39-week monkey study, beyond 
the atrophy of the uterus/cervix/vagina, mammary gland, 
and the occurrence of ovarian follicular cysts, 
microscopic findings included, increased ovarian stroma 
at doses ≥ 10 mg/kg/day. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Fertility studies were not conducted; however, adverse effects 
of elacestrant on both male and female fertility can be 
anticipated based on its mechanism of action. Decreased 
cellularity of Leydig cells was noted in male rats at the highest 
dose of elacestrant (50 mg/kg/day) in the 26-week repeat-dose 
study, in line with impaired male (and female) fertility in ERα 
knockout mice (Korach, 1994). 
In rat embryo-fetal developmental studies, elacestrant treatment 
during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal and 
fetal toxicities and malformations.  
The atrophy of the uterus, cervix, and vagina 
represents a direct inhibitory effect of 
elacestrant on the trophic activity exerted by 
E2 on these organs, whereas ovarian cystic 
follicles are likely caused by the interruption 
of the negative feedback loop between E2 and 
pituitary hormones. These findings, observed 
in animals with reproductive potential, are not 
relevant for the target patient population of 
postmenopausal women which have already 
lost the reproductive function. 
Long term treatment with elacestrant could 
impair male and female fertility (the latter is not 
applicable to postmenopausal women).  
Observations of estrogen-disruptive 
pharmacological activity of elacestrant in 
pregnant female rats indicate a potential 
teratogenic risk for women (not applicable to 
postmenopausal women).

Key safety findings from nonclinical studies 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted with elacestrant, in 
accordance with ICH S9 Guidance for Nonclinical Evaluation 
for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals (ICH S9 2010). However, 
granulosa ovary cell benign tumors were present in female rats 
following 26-week treatment with elacestrant at doses of 
≥ 25 mg/kg. 
Relevance to human usage 
Such tumors have been associated with 
long-term perturbation of endocrine function 
induced by selective ER modulators/ 
degraders. Indeed, these tumors also 
spontaneously develop in mice lacking ERα. 
This endocrine perturbation should not occur 
in postmenopausal women, where the 
hypophyseal-ovarian loop is already impaired. 
Furthermore, carcinogenicity due to 
deoxyribonucleic acid damage can be 
excluded because elacestrant is devoid of 
genotoxic potential.

Part II: Module SIII - Clinical Trial Exposure 
SIII.1 Exposure in healthy volunteers and subjects with hepatic impairment 
The elacestrant clinical development plan included 11 studies in healthy volunteers (RAD1901-
101, RAD1901-104, RAD1901-109, RAD1901-110, RAD1901-111, RAD1901-112, RAD1901-
113, RAD1901-114, RAD1901-115, RAD1901-116, and RAD1901-118) and 1 study in subjects 
with hepatic impairment (RAD1901-117 which included 20 subjects with hepatic impairment (10 
subjects with mild hepatic impairment, 10 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and 16 
additional control subjects with normal hepatic function). 
In the pooled healthy volunteer studies, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) duration on treatment 
was 3.8 (3.05) days. In subjects with hepatic impairment, the duration on-treatment was 1.0 
(0.00) day.

respectively). 
•  Gender: the proportion of males to females was similar in the pooled healthy volunteer 
studies, whilst there were more males in the RAD1901-117 hepatic impairment study (69.4% 
males versus 30.6% females). 
•  Ethnicity: the proportion of Hispanic or Latino subjects was lower in the pooled healthy 
volunteer studies than in the RAD1901-117 hepatic impairment study (26.0% versus 47.2%, 
respectively).

SIII.2 Exposure in patients with metastatic breast cancer 
The elacestrant clinical development plan included 3 studies in metastatic breast cancer. 
• 
• 
• 
RAD1901-005 was a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, multipart dose-escalation trial of 
elacestrant in postmenopausal women with ER-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast 
cancer. 
RAD1901-106 was a pharmacodynamic trial to assess target engagement of the ER in 
metastatic breast cancer lesions of postmenopausal women with ER-positive/HER2- 
negative metastatic breast cancer as detected by 16α-18F-fluoro-17β-estradiol positron 
emission tomography imaging following 14 days of treatment. 
RAD1901-308 was an international, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active 
controlled, event driven, Phase 3 trial comparing elacestrant dihydrochloride 400 mg 
(corresponding to elacestrant 345 mg) once daily with the SOC options of either 
fulvestrant or an AI in postmenopausal women and men with ER-positive/HER2-negative 
metastatic breast cancer. 
In the RAD1901-308 study, the mean (SD) duration on treatment was highest for patients in the 
elacestrant group at 157.7 (180.53) days and lowest in patients receiving AIs in the SOC group at 
98.9 (108.34) days. Almost all patients (230 [97%]) in the elacestrant group and patients receiving 
AIs (68 [100%]) had a relative dose intensity between 90% and 100%. 
In the pooled Phase 1 studies, the overall mean (SD) duration on elacestrant treatment was 213.5 
(239.07) days. Similar to the RAD1901-308 study, 68 (100%) patients had a relative dose 
intensity of > 90%.

In the RAD1901-308 study, groups were balanced with respect to all baseline demographic 
characteristics. The median age in all groups was between 63.5 and 64 years (range: 24 to 
89 years). There were 6 (3%) males in the elacestrant group and 1 (<1%) male in the SOC group. 
Postmenopausal women accounted for 471 (100%) of the patients. 
Demographic characteristics in the pooled Phase 1 studies were similar to those in the RAD1901-
308 study, with the following exceptions: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Race: there were no Asian patients in the pooled Phase 1 studies (0% versus 9% 
elacestrant, 8% SOC). 
Region: there was a lower percentage of patients from Europe in the pooled Phase 1 
studies (22% versus 57% elacestrant, 51% SOC). 
Region: there was a higher percentage of patients from North America in the pooled 
Phase 1 studies (78% versus 27% elacestrant, 31% SOC). 
Region: there were no patients from Asia in the pooled Phase 1 studies (0% versus

Patients excluded as per this criterion most likely require other 
treatments (chemotherapy, radiation treatments, etc) with potential 
effects on the target symptoms. Interactions between 
chemotherapeutic drugs and elacestrant are unknown. 
No 
Elacestrant is not expected to be a treatment for this group of 
patients. 
Included as missing information 
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information) 
Criterion 2: Intact uterus with a history of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (atypical endometrial hyperplasia 
or higher-grade lesion) 
Reason for exclusion 
Included as missing information 
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information) 
Criterion 3: Diagnosis of any other malignancy within 5 years before enrollment, except for adequately treated 
basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or 2nd primary breast cancer 
Reason for exclusion 
Patients with prior malignant disease would most likely require 
other treatments (chemotherapy, radiation treatments, etc) with 
potential effects on the assessment of study drugs in breast cancer. 
Interactions between chemotherapeutic drugs and elacestrant are 
unknown. 
Furthermore, patients with prior malignancies are at risk for cancer 
recurrence in general, which may increase the risk for early 
withdrawal from the study, thereby reducing the ability to detect 
safety and efficacy signals. 
No 
Elacestrant is not expected to be a treatment for these types of 
cancers. 
Patients with prior malignant disease most likely require other 
treatments (chemotherapy, radiation treatments, etc.) with potential 
effects on the assessment of study drugs in breast cancer. 
Interactions between chemotherapeutic drugs and elacestrant are 
unknown. 
Furthermore, patients with malignancies within the last 5 years are 
at risk for cancer recurrence in general, which may increase the risk 
for early withdrawal from the study, thereby reducing the ability to 
detect safety and efficacy signals. 
No 
Elacestrant is not expected to be a treatment for these types of 
cancers. 
Included as missing information 
Rationale (if not included as missing

in these patients would be different from that of the populations 
intended for treatment. 
Criterion 5: Child-Pugh Score greater than Class A (ie, score > 6) 
Reason for exclusion 
Patients at increased risk for developing complications from hepatic 
impairment may require additional evaluation/assessments outside 
the scope of a clinical study. As a standard precautionary measure, 
patients with significant hepatic impairment were excluded. 
No 
Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, reduced dose of elacestrant is 
recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Included as missing information 
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information) 
Criterion 6: Coagulopathy or any history of coagulopathy within the past 6 months, including history of deep 
vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism

Part II: Module SV - Post-authorization Experience 
Not applicable as this is an initial RMP. 
Part II: Module SVI - Additional EU Requirements for the Safety Specification Potential for 
misuse for illegal purposes 
Elacestrant is not expected to have the potential to be used for illegal purposes; hence, the 
potential for misuse is considered negligible. There has been no known incidence of abuse with 
the use of elacestrant. The product will be made available by prescription only.

SVII.1 Identification of safety concerns in the initial RMP submission

EU Risk Management Plan – Version 1.0 
ORSERDU (Elacestrant; RAD1901) 
SVII.1.1. Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP: 
Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the indication 
treated):  
•  Apart from embryo-fetal toxicity, hepatic failure, and thromboembolic events (venous) 
which are included in the section, “Other reasons for considering the risks not important,” 
adverse drug reactions included in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) are 
considered to have minimal impact in relation to the indication treated. 
Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious, but occurring with a low frequency 
and considered to be acceptable in relation to the severity of the indication treated: 
• 
None 
Known risks that require no further characterisation and are followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and for 
which the risk minimisation messages in the product information are adhered by prescribers 
(e.g., actions being part of standard clinical practice in each EU Member state where the 
product is authorised): 
• 
None 
Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile: 
• 
None 
Other reasons for considering the risks not important: 
•  Embryo-fetal toxicity is not applicable in relation to postmenopausal women for which 
elacestrant is indicated.  
•  Thromboembolic events (venous; VTEEs): The risk of VTEEs in patients treated with 
estrogen receptor antagonists are well known to the healthcare professionals. These risks 
are well characterised and they do not require additional PV measures or risk minimisation 
measures. The Applicant's position is that there is not enough evidence that elacestrant 
causes VTEEs vs. underlying disease; however, considering the clinical significance, 
VTEEs have been included as ADRs in the SmPC section 4.8 consistent with the 
fulvestrant product information. For these risks, Healthcare Professionals have adequate 
measures in place to treat patients. Hence, the risk of VTEEs will be reviewed as a part of 
routine pharmacovigilance activities and current labelling information is considered 
sufficient.  
•  Hepatic failure: One patient across the clinical development program experienced acute 
hepatic failure and disease progression that resulted in death. However, this patient's 
underlying stage IV breast cancer with liver and bone metastases at baseline were major 
confounders to determine the causality with elacestrant. Overall, the abnormal liver 
function tests observed with elacestrant are reflected by asymptomatic, non-serious

EU Risk Management Plan – Version 1.0 
ORSERDU (Elacestrant; RAD1901) 
elevation of the transaminases with no impact on treatment or benefit-risk balance. One 
serious case of blood bilirubin increased occurred; however, it was determined to be related 
to progressive disease. The Applicant's position is that there is not enough evidence that 
elacestrant causes acute hepatic failure; however, considering the clinical significance, 
increased liver enzymes and acute hepatic failure are included as ADRs in the SmPC 
section 4.8 consistent with the fulvestrant product information. The adverse events 
suggestive of hepatic failure including abnormal liver function tests are being monitored 
through routine pharmacovigilance. 
SVII.1.2. Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP: 
A review of the data does not currently indicate any important identified risks or important 
potential risks of elacestrant. Details concerning areas of missing information are discussed

EU Risk Management Plan – Version 1.0 
ORSERDU (Elacestrant; RAD1901) 
PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan (RMP) for ORSERDU (Elacestrant dihydrochloride) 
This is a summary of the RMP for ORSERDU. The RMP details important risks of ORSERDU, 
how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained about 
ORSERDU’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
ORSERDU’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how ORSERDU should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for ORSERDU should be read in the context of all this information, 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which 
are part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
ORSERDU’s RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for: 
ORSERDU is intended as monotherapy for the treatment of postmenopausal women and men, 
with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-
negative, advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have progressed following at least one line of 
endocrine therapy that could have been in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. 
It contains elacestrant dihydrochloride as the active substance and it is given orally with food. 
Further information about the evaluation of ORSERDU’s benefits can be found in ORSERDU’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency 
website. 
II.  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or further characterize 
the risks: 
Important risks of ORSERDU, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about ORSERDU’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• 
• 
• 
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
The authorized pack size: the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status: the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.

EU Risk Management Plan – Version 1.0 
ORSERDU (Elacestrant; RAD1901) 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including periodic safety update report assessment so that immediate action 
can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of ORSERDU is not yet available, it is listed 
under “missing information” below. 
II.A  List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of ORSERDU are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link to the use of ORSERDU. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

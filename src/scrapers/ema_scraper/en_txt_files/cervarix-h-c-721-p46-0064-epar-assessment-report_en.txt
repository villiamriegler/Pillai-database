1.  RECOMMENDATION 
Based on the review of the paediatric data on safety and immunogenicity collected in study HPV-048, 
Mont 48, the Rapporteur considers that the benefit-risk balance for the above mentioned product 
remains unchanged and therefore does not require further regulatory action on the marketing 
authorisation for Cervarix. The SmPC and PIL remain unchanged.  
The results observed at Months 7, 12, 18, 24 and 36 have been presented previously. The final study 
report of study HPV-048 at Month 60 is needed to fulfil commitment FUM021.  
2.  BACKGROUND 
The HPV-048 Clinical Study Report Annex 5 (Month 48) is submitted in accordance with the 
requirements of Article 46 of the regulation 1901/2006. 
3.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
The HPV-048 PRI study report M7 and Annex Report MI2 were previously submitted in order to fulfill 
commitments FUM021, 021.1 and 021.2. The Annex Reports 2 (MI8), 3 (M24) and 4 (M36) were 
previously submitted. From the results reported at M18, M24 and M36 it is concluded that in all age 
groups (9-25 years) a sustained immune response against both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens was 
observed in all vaccine groups up to 36 months after the first vaccination. 
The MAH submits now the results observed at Month 48 (Annex Report 5). The submission of the final 
report at Month 60 to fulfil commitment FUM021 is currently planned in October 2013. 
Study design: please refer to the Clinical Study Report.  
Study HPV048 PRI is a phase IIII, partially-blind, randomized, multi-centre, age stratified (three age 
strata: 9-14 years, 15-19 years and 20-25 years), dose-range study in healthy females aged 9-25 
years. This study is conducted in 21 study centres in two countries (Germany and Canada). 
A total of 960 were randomized (1:1:1:1) and allocated to four treatment groups (all received the HPV 
16/18 vaccine at different dosages [20 µg or 40 µg of each HPV antigen] and on different schedules [0, 
2-month, 0, 6-month or 0, 1 ,6 month schedule]: 240 subjects received the 40 µg/40 µg) vaccine 
according to a Month 0, 2 schedule (V40_02 group), 241 subjects received the 40 µg/40 µg) vaccine 
according to a Month 0, 6 schedule (V40_06 group), 240 subjects received the 20 µg/20 µg) vaccine 
according to a Month 0, 6 schedule (V20_06 group) and 239 subjects received the 20 µg/20 µg) 
vaccine according to the standard Month 0, 1, 6 schedule (HPV group). 
A total of 668 subjects were included at the Month 48 visit of Study HPV-048 PRI: 169, 168, 167 and 
164 subjects in the V40_02, V40_06, V20_06 and HPV groups, respectively. 
Primary objectives 
Immunogenicity 
To evaluate the immunogenicity of the HPV-16/18 vaccine one month after the last dose when 
administered at different dosages (20 or 40 µg of each HPV antigen) and on different schedules (0, 2- 
or 0, 6 months) compared with the standard administered on a 3-dose schedule (0, 1, 6 months).

the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

The primary analysis of immunogenicity was performed on the Month 48 ATP Immunogenicity cohort. 
The Month 48 ATP Immunogenicity cohort included all evaluable subjects (i.e. those meeting all 
eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures defined in the protocol, with no elimination criteria 
during the study) for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were available. This 
included subjects who returned for blood sampling at Month 48 and for whom assay results were 
available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after vaccination. 
Safety 
To evaluate the reactogenicity of the HPV-16/18 vaccine when administered at different dosages (20 or 
40 µg of each HPV type) and on different schedules (0, 2-or 0,6-months) with respect to the 
occurrence, intensity and relationship to vaccination of solicited local and general symptoms reported 
within 7 days (Days 0 - 6) after each and any vaccination.] 
The primary analysis of safety was based on the Month 48 Total Vaccinated cohort for events reported 
between Month 36 and Month 48. The Month 48 Total Vaccinated cohort included all vaccinated 
subjects who returned for the Month 48 visit. Thus, the Month 48 Total Vaccinated cohort for analysis 
of safety included all subjects with at least one vaccine administration documented and the Month 48 
Total Vaccinated cohort for analysis of immunogenicity included vaccinated subjects who returned for 
blood sampling at Month 48 and for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were 
available. 
Assessor’s preliminary note 
The secondary objectives of the study are shown in the Clinical Study Report and not reproduced here. 
Only the outcome with respect to the primary objectives will be discussed in the current assessment 
report. A complete analysis will be done at the end of the study. The only relevant group is the one 
that receives the 20 µg/20 µg Cervarix formulation that is currently commercially available and used 
according to the 0, 1, 6 month vaccination schedule. The immune responses to HPV-31 and HPV-45 
will be discussed at the end of the study. 
Immunogenicity results 
Table 17 and Table 18 show the immunogenicity results according to the ATP analysis.  
Table 19 and Table 20 show the immunogenicity results in subjects aged 9-14 years and 15-25 years. 
Table 21 and Table 22 show seropositivity rates and GMTs by pre-vaccination status and by age 
stratum (strata: 9-14, 15-19, 20-25 years).  
Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the persistence of ELISA antibody titers in subjects seronegative at 
baseline.

Safety results 
During the follow-up period from Month 36 to Month 48, 18 SAEs were reported in 15 subjects. 
46 subjects reported at least one medically significant condition (MSC), 11 subjects reported at least 
one new onset chronic disease (NOCD), 2 subjects reported at least one new onset autoimmune 
disease (NOAD). 
4.  MAH’S OVERALL CONCLUSION 
The data submitted confirm a sustained immune response up to 48 months after the first vaccine dose 
administration and the findings remain in line with those observed at previous time points. The benefit-
risk balance for Cervarix remains positive. No further regulatory action is required. 
5.  RAPPORTEUR’s CONCLUSION 
The MAH’s conclusion is endorsed. 
6.  REQUEST FOR SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
The MAH is requested to submit the Month 60 follow-up study report of study HPV-048 in due time 
(expected October 2013).

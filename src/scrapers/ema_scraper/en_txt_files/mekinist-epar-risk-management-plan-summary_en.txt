Summary of the risk management plan for Mekinist (trametinib)
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Mekinist.  The 
RMP details important risks of Mekinist, how these risks can be minimized, 
and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about  Mekinist’s  risks  and 
uncertainties (missing information).
Mekinist’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package 
leaflet  give  essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals  and  patients 
on how Mekinist should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Mekinist should be read in the context of all 
this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its 
plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the  European  Public 
Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in 
updates of Mekinist’s RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Mekinist is authorized in the following indications:
 Trametinib as  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  for  the 
treatment  of  adult  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma 
with a BRAF V600 mutation;
o Trametinib monotherapy has not demonstrated clinical activity 
in  patients  who  have  progressed  on  a  prior  BRAF  inhibitor
therapy
 Trametinib in combination with dabrafenib is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with 
a BRAF V600 mutation;
 Trametinib in combination with dabrafenib is indicated for the adjuvant 
treatment of adult patients with Stage III melanoma with a BRAF V600 
mutation, following complete resection.
Mekinist contains trametinib as the active substance and it is given orally.
Further information about the evaluation of Mekinist’s benefits can be found 
in  Mekinist’s  EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on 
the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/mekinist
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or
further characterize the risks
Important  risks  of  trametinib,  together  with  measures  to  minimize  such 
risks and the proposed studies for learning more about trametinib’s risks, 
are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on 
correct use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients 
and healthcare professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The  authorised  pack  size  — the  amount  of  medicine  in  a  pack  is 
chosen so to ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the 
patient  (e.g.  with  or  without  prescription)  can  help  to  minimize  its 
risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is 
collected continuously and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment 
so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary.  These  measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of trametinib is not 
yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of trametinib are risks that need special risk management 
activities to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal 
product can be safely taken. Important risks can be regarded as identified 
or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof 
of a link with the use of trametinib. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further 
evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. 
on the long-term use of the medicine).

Patients 
trametinib or  combination  with 
dabrafenib may  develop  ILD  or  pneumonitis.  In  a  Phase  III 
trial,  2.4%  (5/211)  of  patients  treated  with  trametinib 
monotherapy developed ILD or pneumonitis. The median time 
to  first  presentation  of  ILD  or  pneumonitis  was  160 days 
(range: 60 to 172 days).
Specific  risks  for  trametinib  treated  patients  have  not  been 
identified.  Pneumonitis  with  some  chemotherapeutic  agents 
(associated with the event) such as gemcitabine may be seen 
with higher frequency in pancreatic cancer patients with prior 
irradiation. It is unclear if this holds for trametinib.

Hepatic  adverse  events  have  been  reported  in  clinical  trials 
with trametinib. For trametinib monotherapy, more than 90% 
of  these  liver  events  occurred  within  the  first  6 months  of 
treatment. Of the hepatic AEs, increased ALT and AST were the 
most common events and the majority were either Grade 1 or 
2. Liver events were detected in clinical trials with monitoring 
every  four  weeks.  It  is  recommended  that  patients  receiving 
treatment  with  trametinib  monotherapy  have  liver  function 
monitored  every  four  weeks  for  6 months.  Liver  monitoring 
may be continued thereafter as clinically indicated.
Specific  risk  factors  that  predict possible  hepatic  enzyme 
elevations  have  not  been  identified  for  trametinib  treated 
patients.  Patients  with liver  metastases  are  considered  to  be 
at higher risk for events of hepatic failure.

Early studies in animals have shown that trametinib may affect 
the fertility both when taking the medication and after it has 
been stopped. It is not known whether these effects will also 
be seen in humans, as there have been no human studies to 
look at whether trametinib can affect a woman’s ability to have 
children.

In  rats  and  rabbits  given  trametinib  monotherapy,  maternal 
and developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weights and 
increased ossification variations) were observed at exposures 
below  the  exposures  achieved  at  the  recommended  clinical 
dose  of  2 mg  per  day.  Additionally,  decreased  corpora  lutea 
were  observed  in  rats  given  trametinib,  which  may  impact 
female fertility. It is not known whether these effects will also 
be seen in humans.

Studies  in  juvenile  animals  have  shown  adverse  effects  of 
trametinib which had not been observed in adult animals. In 
juvenile  rats,  increased  heart  weight  with  no  histopathology 
was  observed  at  0.35 mg/kg/day  (approximately  twice  the 
adult human clinical exposure based on AUC).

In  clinical  trials,  pulmonary  embolism  and  deep  vein 
thrombosis  (PE/DVT)  events  were  reported  in  3%  of  the 
subjects  (6/209)  on  trametinib  and  dabrafenib  combination 
therapy.
Risk  factors  include  history  or  family  history  of  VTE, 
immobilization,  increased  age  (>60),  those  on  oestrogen-
based  compounds,  recent  surgery  and  cancer.  Therefore, 
patients with metastatic melanoma are at risk from the nature 
of their disease.

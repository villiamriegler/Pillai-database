Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for bedaquiline, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Results from a published article by Pandie et al show that the bedaquiline exposure (area under 
curve:AUC) over 48 hours was increased 2 times in subjects treated with bedaquiline as part of 
therapy for drug-resistant tuberculosis and lopinavir/ritonavir-based antiretroviral therapy.  
In view of the data presented in this PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to the product 
information of Sirturo were warranted. Based on the safety review, the PRAC considers that an 
update of the Product Information is necessary in order to add information about bedaquiline 
exposure over 48 hours in subjects treated with bedaquiline as part of drug –resistant tuberculosis 
and lopanivir/ritonavir- based antiretroviral therapy in section 4.5 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for bedaquiline the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing bedaquiline is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

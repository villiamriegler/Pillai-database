2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
The development of inhibitors is the most severe treatment-related complication of haemophilia A. 
Current treatment option for haemophilia A patients who developed inhibitors is immune tolerance 
induction (ITI). However, ITI fails to eradicate inhibitors in approximately 20-40% of treated 
patients (Franchini et al. 2012). It is also time intensive and burdensome, particularly for children, 
who frequently require surgical implantation of central venous lines. When FVIII can no longer be 
used to control bleeding, patients with inhibitors may be treated with agents who bypass FVIII, 
known as bypassing agents (BPA). But these products are not as effective as FVIII, with patients 
suffering frequent bleeds, mainly into target joints, that are difficult to control even with large 
doses of bypassing agents. BPAs are also short-acting and may need to be administered 
frequently, particularly for prophylactic treatment, with long IV infusion times. This can sometimes 
cause compliance issues. Increased bleeding resulting from suboptimal disease management leads 
to pain and disability through progression of joint disease, notwithstanding the impact on quality of 
life (Hay and DiMichele 2012; Kempton and White 2009; Kreuz et al. 1995). 
Overall, there is an unmet medical need for new, more convenient and efficacious treatment 
options for patients with Haemophilia A with inhibitors. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Haemophilia A is a X-linked recessive bleeding disorder characterised by congenital 
underproduction of or dysfunction of FVIII. It accounts for approximately 80% of all cases of 
haemophilia. 
Haemophilia A can be classified into severe, moderate or mild haemophilia depending on the % 
normal level of active clotting factor remaining (< 1%: severe haemophilia; 1–5% moderate and 
5-40% with mild haemophilia). This classification is however less relevant for the population of 
patients who developed inhibitors.  
The main bleeding sites in patients with haemophilia A are usually intra-articular, intramuscular, 
subcutaneous, gastrointestinal, mucocutaneous, and/ or intracranial. Repeated intra-articular 
bleeds are a major contributor to decreased quality of life, as the joint damage associated with 
multiple haemarthroses may progress to haemophilic arthropathy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The incidence of haemophilia A is approximately 1 in 5,000 live-born male births or 1 out of every 
10,000 live births (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2016; National Institutes of 
Health [NIH] 2017; Franchini and Mannucci 2013; WFH 2016b). In the European Union, this 
equates to around 510 newborns with haemophilia A in 2015 (based on an estimated 5.1million 
children born in EU-28 (Eurostat 2015). The prevalence of haemophilia A varies with the reporting 
country, with a range of 5.4-14.5 cases per 100.000 males. Haemophilia A occurs in all races and 
ethnic groups. Because it is an X-linked, recessive disease, it is predominantly occurring in males. 
Females are usually asymptomatic carriers. 
The epidemiology of inhibitors in haemophilia A is reported as an overall inhibitor prevalence of 5–
7%. When limited to patients with severe disease the prevalence is much higher at 12–13%. The 
incidence of new FVIII inhibitors in patients with severe FVIII deficiency is approximately 30%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 10/126 
 
 
 
 
Inhibitors are less common in patients with mild or moderate haemophilia occurring in 
approximately 3–13% of patients (World Federation of Hemophilia [WHF] 2016a). Most patients 
develop an inhibitor within a relatively short time of exposure days. A bimodal peak of inhibitor risk 
in early childhood and old age has been identified lately (all reviewed in Witmer C et al; Ther Adv 
Hematol (2013) 4(1) 59–72). 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Factor VIII inhibitors can be detected either with routine laboratory testing or by clinical 
presentation. An inhibitor is clinically suspected when a patient experiences bleeding that does not 
adequately respond to haemostatic therapy (Witmer C et al; Ther Adv Hematol (2013) 4(1) 59–
72). 
Patients with inhibitors are recognised as having the most severe clinical course among those 
affected by haemophilia, mainly due to suboptimal disease management. These patients 
experience frequent bleeds that are difficult to control even with large doses of bypassing agents, 
with bleeds which can be life threatening. 
2.1.4.  Management 
For the proposed patient population who developed inhibitors, permanent eradication of inhibitors 
is usually first choice. Immune tolerance induction (ITI) involves administration of factor VIII in a 
small dose to begin with and gradually increasing the dose so that the individual’s immune system 
learns to tolerate the FVIII and ceases to produce inhibitors. However, an optimal regimen for ITI 
remains to be defined and the length of treatment is based on individual responses, ranging from 
months to years and comes with high treatment burden. ITI has a success rate of 60% to 80% 
(Mariani et al. 2003; Hay and DiMichele 2012; Santagostino et al. 2009). 
When FVIII can no longer be used to control bleeding, patients with inhibitors may be treated with 
bypassing agents. The two principal products available for this are:  
- 
- 
recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa, NovoSeven) and  
activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC, or factor eight inhibitors bypassing agent 
[FEIBA]).  
BPAs are short-acting and may need to be administered often, with long IV infusion times (25-50 
minutes for FEIBA) and/or require frequent administration for prophylaxis (daily or every other day 
for FEIBA). Frequent administration is time-consuming and burdensome for people with 
haemophilia A and their caregivers. 
NovoSeven is indicated for episodic use only, while FEIBA is approved for episodic and prophylactic 
use. 
It is recommended that prophylaxis be considered for patients whose condition has failed to 
respond to ITI and who have recurrent significant bleeding (i.e. a target joint or life-threatening 
haemorrhages) (Young, G et al, 2011; Haemophilia 17: e849–e857). Still the haemostatic effect of 
bypassing agents used prophylactically is suboptimal. Data have shown that patients on aPCC 
prophylaxis achieve an ABR of 7.9 (Antunes et al; 2014), and patients who take rFVIIIa 
prophylactically experience 2-3 bleeds/month (Konkle et al; 2007). These are higher numbers of 
bleeds than patients without inhibitors on FVIII concentrates who can achieve a median ABR of 
approximately 0-2 with optimal prophylaxis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 11/126 
 
 
 
 
Despite the availability of prophylaxis regimens for patients who develop FVIII inhibitors, the 
majority of patients are currently treated with episodic regimens, in part due to the treatment 
burden of prophylaxis regimens. 
About the product 
Emicizumab is a novel bispecific monoclonal antibody which mimics coagulation factor VIII and, 
therefore, is capable of promoting the activation of FX by FIXa, resulting in downstream 
haemostasis at the site of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A who have decreased or no 
circulating levels of FVIII. 
Emicizumab has no structural relationship or sequence homology to factor VIII and, as such, does 
not induce or enhance the development of direct inhibitors to factor VIII. 
The applied and approved indication is the following: 
Hemlibra is indicated for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A 
with factor VIII inhibitors. 
Hemlibra can be used in all age groups. 
The recommended dose is 3 mg/kg once weekly for the first 4 weeks (loading dose), followed by 
1.5 mg/kg once weekly (maintenance dose), administered as a subcutaneous injection. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on: 
o  There is unmet medical need for new, more efficacious, but equally convenient treatment 
options for patients with Haemophilia A with inhibitors. 
o  The request for accelerated assessment has overall been adequately substantiated. The data 
package will allow robust evaluation of the claimed indication.  
o  Based on the evidence submitted, a clinically meaningful benefit is assumed, whilst the 
safety concerns particularly around DDIs have been characterised and risk minimisation 
measures proposed, to be evaluated as part of the RMP. 
o  The proposed full extrapolation of efficacy and safety for the youngest age group (0-2 years 
of age) is noted. The acceptability of this exercise will be part of the review process but is 
not considered to jeopardise an overall assumed positive benefit:risk for the remaining age 
groups within the proposed indication.  
o  If licensed, Emicizumab, with its weekly s.c. dosing schedule and an improved efficacy profile 
over existing inhibitor treatment options, which are limited, has the potential to provide 
substantial therapeutic advantage to patients with Haemophilia A and inhibitors. 
o  It has the potential to change medical practice, as it decreases treatment burden by 
elimination of daily IV treatments at home with its subsequent risks, while reducing bleeding 
rates and improving quality of life.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Emicizumab is a novel bispecific monoclonal antibody which mimics coagulation factor VIII 
(referred to as FVIII hereafter) and, therefore, is capable of promoting the activation of FX by 
FIXa, resulting in downstream haemostasis at the site of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A 
who have decreased or no circulating levels of FVIII.  
The antibody structure is based on a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) framework containing two 
different heavy chains (referred to as Q- and J-chains by the applicant) and light chain sequences. 
The bispecific antibody binds to FIXa and FX and has co-factor activity that substitutes FVIII.  
The finished product is supplied as a single-use, sterile, colourless to slightly yellow solution for 
subcutaneous injection and contains no preservatives. The finished product is formulated as 30 
mg/mL (30 mg strength) or 150 mg/mL (containing 60 mg, 105 mg, and 150 mg of emicizumab). 
The excipients are L-histidine, L-aspartic acid, L-arginine, and poloxamer 188 and water for 
injections. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 
cells and consists of one anti-FIXa heavy chain named in-house as Q chain, one anti-FX heavy 
chain named in-house as J chain, and two light chains (referred to as L-chain).  
The Fc region of the two heavy chains (Q chain and J chain) was engineered to preferentially 
heterodimerize by electrostatic steering mutations. During the purification of the bispecific 
antibody, mispaired Homo species including J-Homo Main (antibody consists of two light chains and 
two J chains) and Q-Homo Main (antibody consists of two light chains and two Q chains), are 
removed.  
Like other complex glycoproteins, emicizumab displays a certain amount of micro-heterogeneity in 
terms of different degrees of glycosylation and modifications of amino acids. Both heavy chains, Q 
chain and J chain, also have a single conserved glycosylation site. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Emicizumab is produced using a suspension-adapted CHO cell line. The source is the working cell 
bank (WCB), which is derived from the master cell bank (MCB). The cell culture process for the 
production of emicizumab active substance involves three stages: the seed train, the inoculum 
train, and the production culture. The seed train is used to provide a continuous source of cells for 
the production of multiple batches and is started by thawing one vial of the working cell bank 
(WCB). The inoculum train is used to expand the cell population for introduction into the production 
stage. The production stage is used to produce emicizumab, which is secreted into the culture fluid. 
During production, cell viability and productivity are enhanced by addition of nutrients. The 
production culture is harvested by separating the secreted molecule from cells and cell debris.

From each production run, a single batch of harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF) is produced and can 
be traced back to the WCB vial used to initiate the manufacturing process. 
Following the cell culture steps, harvest is initiated from the production bioreactor. Following 
completion of the cell culture production stage, the secreted emicizumab in the pre-harvest cell 
culture fluid (PHCCF) is separated from cells and cellular debris. The harvested cell culture fluid 
(HCCF) is cooled and stored. Once the contents of the bioreactor are processed, water for 
injections may be flushed to recover any residual product. 
The emicizumab purification process consists of chromatography steps and additional steps for 
removal and inactivation of potential viral contaminants. The final step in the active substance 
purification process is concentration of the product and buffer exchange using ultrafiltration and 
diafiltration (UFDF). Protein concentration and buffer composition are adjusted to the active 
substance specification by addition of a stock solution containing histidine and arginine buffer and 
poloxamer 188. The active substance solution is filtered into appropriate storage containers. 
Cell substrate, genetic stability, cell banks 
The generation of the production cell line and the expression vectors has been described in detail.  
Emicizumab is manufactured in a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line which is regarded as well 
established. Sufficient details have been provided on the source and history of the cell substrate. 
The preparation of the expression constructs for the three different antibody chains (Q/J/L chains) 
has been appropriately described and vector maps have been provided.  
Control of materials 
The details on the raw materials used in the fermentation and purification process as well as the 
quality standards e.g. compendial or non-compendial (in-house) specifications have been 
presented. The pharmacopoeial raw materials and reagents comply with their respective 
monographs. The non-pharmacopoeial materials are accepted on the basis of the specification 
indicated. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
To ensure the quality of emicizumab active substance, in-process controls (IPCs) have been 
established. Depending on criticality, some of the IPCs are tested against acceptance criteria; for 
other IPCs, alert levels and action limits have been defined and these are acceptable. All IPC tests 
and limits applied to the cell culture and purification processes have been provided. 
Process validation 
Development, characterization, and validation of the emicizumab process are based on a Quality by 
design (QbD) approach. The applicant has emphasized that emicizumab follows essentially the 
same concepts as previously approved for other Roche antibodies. The QbD strategy has been 
discussed in detail. 
The applicant has built a series of risk assessment tools aimed at analyzing, categorizing, and 
ensuring appropriate mitigation and management of risk to product efficacy and safety related to 
the production process. In combination, these elements form a comprehensive risk and science 
based program to assess the criticality of product attributes and rationally design a process and 
product control strategy.  
• Identification of critical quality attributes (CQAs) for the active substance and finished product 
using CQA risk ranking and filtering (RRF) was refined iteratively during development as more 
product knowledge was accumulated; 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 14/126 
 
 
 
 
• Process design, assessment of potential critical process parameters (pCPPs) to be included in 
process validation (PV) studies, and analysis and categorization of study results to identify CPPs 
were refined continuously over the process development life cycle; 
• The product and process understanding and risk assessment outcomes were used as inputs to a 
final assessment that determines the Attribute Testing Strategy (ATS), which was coupled to a 
robustness assessment. 
Process validation strategy 
The manufacturing process for emicizumab active substance has been evaluated and validated to 
define acceptable process parameter ranges that ensure consistent product quality. Development 
and PV of the emicizumab active substance process are built upon a comprehensive science- and 
risk-based approach, which incorporates process and product understanding developed from 
emicizumab-specific studies. The applicant has generated risk assessments for the identification of 
potential critical process parameters (pCPPs), PV and linkage studies, as well as the tool applied to 
define the CPPs. 
The PV section includes studies conducted using qualified scale-down models and manufacturing-
scale equipment. Site-specific studies include PV studies that were conducted at manufacturing 
scale. These studies demonstrate manufacturing process consistency for relevant product quality 
attributes and key performance indicators (KPIs) when producing emicizumab in the commercial 
facility. Site- and scale-independent PV studies to support the identification of CPPs and the 
definition of acceptable process parameter ranges are generally conducted in qualified scale-down 
models of the manufacturing-scale unit operations. 
The commercial active substance manufacturing process, validated site-specific at commercial 
scale (G2.1 process), was shown to be reproducible and produces active substance with acceptable 
quality. Data generated from seven consecutive batches all meet the predefined validation study 
acceptance criteria as well as the proposed commercial acceptance criteria. All batches were 
manufactured consecutively according to the production plan. This is acceptable.  
Moreover, the results of 30 manufacturing batches demonstrate process consistency. Consistent 
removal of J/Q homo variants and other product- or process-related impurities was demonstrated. 
Deamidation in complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) and non-CDRs were consistent and 
within controlled levels.  
The G2.1 commercial process is able to consistently reduce host cell proteins (HCP) and leached 
protein A to acceptable low levels. In conclusion, the evaluation of G2.1 batches confirms that 
process-related impurities and product variants are controlled and reduced to acceptable levels. 
Moreover, the validation of site-specific process hold times was successfully performed. 
Manufacturing process development  
Summary of emicizumab control strategy 
The control strategy comprises the elements of batch release, in-process controls (IPCs) with 
acceptance criteria, stability testing, and the monitoring program. These elements are part of the 
Attribute Testing Strategy (ATS). The control strategy further comprises control of raw materials, 
environmental control, procedural controls, control of process parameters, and additional IPCs. 
One of three possible outcomes is identified for each quality attribute: 
1. Control system testing  
2. Monitoring program  
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 15/126 
 
 
 
 
3. No testing 
Once a testing strategy has been defined for each attribute, an overall assessment is performed to 
determine the robustness of the proposed testing strategy. The recommended testing strategy for 
each of the emicizumab active substance quality attributes using the ATS RRF tool and the 
robustness assessment has been listed by the applicant. 
The applicant has utilized their risk ranking and filtering (RRF) tool for the attribute testing strategy 
(ATS). The applicant’s evaluation of quality attributes appears comprehensive and the classification 
of scores seems reasonable.  
Comparability 
During clinical development, four different active substance manufacturing processes were 
established. The four process versions are referred to as G1 process, G1.2 process, G2 process and 
G2.1 process. The G2.1 process is used for the manufacture of material for pivotal clinical studies 
and is established as the commercial process. 
The comparability assessment between clinical trials phases included a large number of analytical 
procedures including various functional assays, e.g. biological activity and an FcRn binding assay. 
No relevant differences in structure, mass, potency, and purity were observed.  
Characterisation 
Sufficient data on the physicochemical, biological, and immunochemical characteristics of 
emicizumab has been provided: 
• 
Physicochemical characterisation, which describes studies on the elucidation of the 
structural information of emicizumab, including primary structure, post-translational 
modifications, and higher-order structure. In addition, detailed characterisation of 
emicizumab structural variants, including molecular size and charge variants, has been 
provided provided. 
•  Biological and immunochemical characterization, which studies emicizumab’s ability to bind 
FIXa and FX. 
•  CQA assessment, which references the used tools and a summary of the CQAs. 
FcRn binding properties of the emicizumab active substance process performance qualification 
(PPQ) batches were analysed and demonstrated that the batches are comparable.  
The identification of CQAs for emicizumab has been described in sufficient detail and the potential 
impurities have been analysed and are considered sufficiently controlled. 
Specification 
The proposed active substance specification includes control for pharmaceutical characteristics, 
identity, purity, bacterial endotoxins, bioburden, content, and potency. Overall, the test items 
included in the specifications are considered adequate and in line with relevant guidance.  
Analytical methods 
Descriptions of analytical procedures for active substance lot release, and validation summaries 
have been provided.  
Batch analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 16/126 
 
 
 
 
Batch data for active substance lots used during clinical development and for product manufactured 
at the commercial manufacturing facility have been provided. The batch analyses data demonstrate 
that the results were within the specifications and that emicizumab active substance is reproducibly 
manufactured.  
Reference standards  
The two-tiered (primary and secondary/working) reference standard system, including the details 
on the batch selection, preparation, storage, qualification, and stability of emicizumab reference 
standards has been appropriately described. Also, the history of the reference standards and 
qualification of future reference standards have been described in sufficient detail. The 
characterisation results obtained confirmed compliance with the acceptance criteria proposed for 
active substance and corroborate suitability as reference standards.  
Container closure system 
The proposed bags appear suitable as container closure system. Adequate extractable and 
leachable (E&L) studies were conducted. No leachables were found above acceptable limits. The 
information provided was sufficient. 
Stability 
Primary stability data to support the commercial shelf life assignment are derived from stability 
studies of the following active substance batches: 
-Three PPQ batches (used for process validation) manufactured at the commercial facility using the 
G2.1 commercial manufacturing process and scale, and stored at the recommended storage 
condition; 
-Seven clinical batches manufactured at the commercial facility using the G2.1 commercial 
manufacturing process and scale, and stored at the recommended storage condition;  
-One technical batch manufactured at the commercial facility using the G2.1 commercial 
manufacturing process and scale, and stored at the recommended storage condition.  
For all batches, all stability results have remained within the proposed acceptance criteria, 
therefore supporting the claimed shelf life at the recommended conditions. 
Stability-indicating profile  
A panel of analytical procedures was developed and validated that profiles the stability 
characteristics of emicizumab. Validation of the commercial analytical procedures and their 
stability-indicating properties have been adequately described. The analytical procedures to assess 
the stability of emicizumab include methods to determine potency, purity, and physicochemical 
changes. This set of analytical procedures ensures that changes in quality, quantity, and potency of 
emicizumab will be detected. 
Based on the stability results the claimed shelf life for the active substance at the recommended 
storage conditions is acceptable.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Emicizumab finished product is supplied as a sterile, colourless to slightly yellow solution for single-
use subcutaneous injection and contains no preservatives. 
Each single-use, 3 mL vial contains 30 mg, 60 mg, 105 mg, or 150 mg (nominal value) of 
emicizumab at target pH 6.0. The finished product is formulated as 30 mg/mL (30 mg strength) or 
150 mg/mL (containing 60 mg, 105 mg, and 150 mg of emicizumab). The 60 mg, 105 mg, and 
150 mg finished products have identical formulations, differing from each other only in the fill 
volume (0.4 mL; 0.7 mL and 1 mL respectively).  
The 30 mg strength consists of 30 mg/mL emicizumab in a vial at a nominal fill volume of 1.0 mL. 
The 30 mg finished product has an identical composition to the active substance and the 150 
mg/mL finished products, except for a 5-fold lower emicizumab concentration. The 30 mg finished 
product is intended for low-body weight/paediatric patients, and the lower concentration is 
intended to facilitate the handling from a liquid volume perspective. 
The primary packaging components used for the manufacture of emicizumab finished product 
consist of a 3 mL USP/Ph. Eur./JP Type I glass vial, sealed with a rubber stopper and crimped with 
an aluminum cap fitted with a plastic flip-off disk. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product formulation for the 150 mg/mL strength is identical to the active substance 
formulation. Concentration and composition of formulated emicizumab occurs at the active 
substance stage. No further compounding or dilution is performed during finished product 
manufacturing. The 30 mg finished product formulation is identical to the active substance 
formulation, except for a five-fold lower concentration of active ingredient achieved by dilution with 
formulation buffer at the finished product manufacturing stage. 
Phase I clinical trials were conducted with a single-use formulation, designated as F01 and 
containing 80 mg/mL emicizumab. For subsequent pivotal clinical trials, the formulation was 
adapted by increasing the protein concentration while keeping all other formulation components 
and concentrations unchanged. Two strengths of this formulation were used in clinical trials; the 
only difference between them is the fill volume, namely 60 mg (0.4 mL, Product F04) and 150 mg 
(1.0 mL, Product F03). The commercial finished product strengths are the same as those used for 
pivotal clinical trials, with the addition of a 105 mg strength (F02), that was not used in clinical 
trials. An additional formulation (Product F05), containing 30 mg/mL emicizumab in the identical 
formulation composition, was developed for clinical and commercial use in low-body 
weight/paediatric patients and was used in pivotal clinical trials. 
The results of formulation development studies conducted prior to pivotal studies provided the data 
and rationale for the selection of an appropriate formulation. These studies were followed by a 
multivariate formulation robustness study to address potential critical formulation parameters. 
The multivariate formulation robustness study demonstrated that the relevant quality attributes of 
emicizumab are acceptable at the edges of these composition ranges. A multivariate stability study 
was then conducted using several formulation parameters as input factors, as these factors had 
been identified to have a potential impact on critical quality attributes (CQAs) during finished 
product storage. In summary, the active substance and finished product shelf lives are adequately 
supported even at the edges of the allowed formulation composition ranges.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product was developed using a Quality by Design approach with risk assessment tools 
to define critical quality attribute acceptance criteria (CQA-ACs), CPPs, and the control strategy. 
The process description is based on a batch size range (i.e., volume of bulk finished product 
solution). The vials, stoppers, vessels, and filters as well as the connective tubing are cleaned and 
sterilized prior to use. The finished product solution is filtered through an in-line 0.22 µm 
sterilizing-grade filter. 
The manufacture of finished product includes the following main process steps: 
-Pooling of several containers of the active substance and mixing 
-Bioburden reduction filtration of the bulk finished product solution 
-Sterile filtration of the finished product solution; vial filling and stoppering 
-Capping and crimping 
-Final inspection of vials 
-Labelling and secondary packaging 
A summary of the acceptable ranges derived from the process design and validation studies have 
been provided. The ranges are justified by process design studies, process validation studies, and 
media fill runs. 
Controls of critical steps and intermediates 
An overview of the CPPs and IPCs that control the critical steps and, thus, ensure appropriate 
routine control of the entire manufacturing process has been provided. 
Apart from microbiological attributes and some other process parameters, finished product process 
design and validation studies have demonstrated that the emicizumab finished product 
manufacturing process is robust.  
Validation studies have been performed to ensure that the sterilization and depyrogenation 
processes for product-contacting equipment are effective. Media fill runs are routinely performed 
and demonstrate the effectiveness of aseptic processing operations and the suitability of the 
technical setup. Filter validation was performed to demonstrate microbial retention under worst-
case processing conditions.  
Process validation / verification 
The validation of the finished product manufacturing process included the manufacture of several 
consecutive PPQ runs representing the full range of batch sizes for commercial manufacturing. 
The process validation campaign was conducted using active substance batches from the G2.1 
process manufactured according to the commercial active substance manufacturing process and 
scale. 
The finished product (FP) registration batches (used as primary stability batches) and PPQ batches 
(used for formal process validation) for the 30 mg, 60 mg, 105 mg, and 150 mg FP were 
manufactured at the commercial manufacturing facility.  
Three registration batches for the 60 mg FP and three registration batches for the 150 mg strength 
were manufactured. The purpose of the registration batches is to support the shelf life claim for the 
commercial finished products. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 19/126 
 
 
 
 
For the 30 mg strength, three batches were manufactured at the commercial manufacturing 
facility, serving the double purpose of registration batches and PPQ batches. As registration 
batches, these batches support the shelf-life claim for the commercial finished product. As PPQ 
batches, the same batches validate the finished product manufacturing process. 
Furthermore, the batch sizes (prepared volume of bulk finished product solution) of the PPQ 
batches were defined to cover the minimum and the maximum of the commercial manufacturing 
batch size range. During the validation campaign, process parameters for each process step were 
operated at the target operating conditions or at the edges of the allowed ranges. 
 The information provided in this section is sufficient and acceptable. 
Product specification 
The finished product specification includes relevant parameters in accordance with ICH Q6B and 
the Ph. Eur. monograph on parenteral preparations.  
Analytical procedures  
Both pharmacopoeia-based and emicizumab-specific analytical procedures are used to test the 
commercial batches of the finished product for release and/or stability.  
Detailed descriptions of the analytical procedures have been provided. The suitability of these 
analytical procedures for their intended use was either verified or validated. 
Batch analysis 
The evaluation of the emicizumab registration and PPQ finished product batches against the 
proposed commercial specifications has been provided. PPQ batches are used for the finished 
product manufacturing process validation. Registration batches are manufactured using the 
finished product commercial manufacturing process at the commercial facility. Finished product 
registration batches are different from PPQ batches and are used to derive primary stability data 
that support the shelf life claim for the finished product. 
All batch analysis results meet the specifications that were in effect at the time of testing and 
release for each batch. 
In addition, all available release data from emicizumab finished product batches produced during 
the registration and PPQ campaigns were re-evaluated against the proposed commercial release 
specification and results meet the commercial release specification acceptance criteria. 
Overall, the batch testing results are consistent. 
Container closure 
The primary packaging components used for the manufacture of emicizumab finished product 
consist of a 3 mL colourless USP/Ph. Eur./JP Type I glass vial, sealed with a rubber stopper, 
crimped with an aluminium cap fitted with a plastic flip-off disk. All primary packaging materials 
are of suitable quality for packaging sterile liquid products and comply with relevant 
pharmacopoeial requirements. 
The container closure system has been sufficiently described. Packaging materials are of standard 
quality and comply with relevant Ph. Eur. requirements. 
Assessment report

Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 24 months at 2°C-8°C, protected from light, is proposed for the finished product. 
Batches were examined under long-term storage conditions at 5±3°C, and accelerated stability 
studies were performed at 25±2°C /60% relative humidity. The batches were also studied under 
stress conditions at 40±2°C /75% relative humidity. 
In addition, stability of the finished product when exposed to light has been investigated for the 60 
mg and for 30 mg emicizumab FP in the manufacturing-scale container closure material (3 mL 
USP/Ph. Eur./JP Type I glass vial). Stability after intensive light exposure was determined by 
comparing the results of an unprotected, exposed sample in the primary packaging (unlabelled 
vial) to the results for vials stored in the secondary packaging. The photo stability study 
demonstrates that finished product in unprotected vials should not be exposed to intense light for 
prolonged periods and that the vials should be stored in the carton. 
Overall, the stability data looks consistent and satisfactory. Stability acceptance criteria were met. 
Based on the results from the primary stability studies, as well as data from photo stability study, 
temperature excursion studies, in-use stability study, and freeze/thaw stability study, the claimed 
shelf life of 2 years when stored at 2°C to 8°C is acceptable. Based on the in-use stability results 
once removed from the refrigerator, unopened vials can be kept at room temperature (below 30°C) 
for up to 7 days.  
Comparability exercise for finished medicinal drug product 
During clinical development and up to the definition of the commercial presentation, the changes 
that were introduced into emicizumab finished product concerned the emicizumab concentration 
and the fill volume, whereas the primary packaging and the nature and concentration of the 
excipients were left unchanged throughout clinical development. 
No change in finished product manufacturing process and in-process controls was made between 
G1, G2, and G2.1-derived finished products, except for the fill volume. 
The comparability between G1, G2, and G2.1 processes was demonstrated during clinical 
development on the active substance level, by assessing results from release testing and extended 
characterization available at the time of comparability assessment. In addition, and also as part of 
clinical development, a comparative stress stability study was performed on finished product level 
including finished product manufactured using active substance derived from G1, G2, and G2.1 
processes. Overall, the G2.1 material was shown to be comparable with G1 and G2 materials in 
terms of product quality and safety as shown by release testing, extended characterization, and 
comparative stress stability. 
The comparability between G1, G2, and G2.1-derived finished products during clinical development 
also included a comparison of relevant finished product release data available at the time of 
comparability assessment. With the introduction of G2.1-derived finished product with different fill 
volumes, the suitability for intended use was also confirmed during clinical development by 
comparing relevant finished product release data available at the time of comparability 
assessment.  
The assessment performed during clinical development, and based on comparative finished product 
release data, demonstrated that G1, G2, and G2.1-derived finished products have comparable 
quality and that there is no impact of the fill volume on finished product quality.

Adventitious agents 
No substances of human or animal origin are used during manufacture, and the safety of the cell 
substrate has been suitably demonstrated. No virus like particles were detected other than 
retrovirus-like particles which were identified as intracytoplasmic A and C-type particles, which are 
known to be present in CHO cells. An acceptable estimation of the number of retrovirus particles 
per dose was provided. 
The applicant has conducted viral clearance studies and selected the model viruses in accordance 
with ICH Q5A. The small scale models used were suitably validated. No impact on viral clearance 
was seen with any process parameter within the ranges tested. Clearance studies were based on 
worst case setting. The studies show an acceptable viral clearance potential of the manufacturing 
process.  
Column sanitisation procedures were suitably validated. All study reports and analytical validation 
results were submitted. 
The information provided is considered sufficient and satisfactory.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The information presented in the quality sections of the emicizumab dossier is very detailed and of 
high quality. Relevant guidelines and Ph. Eur. monographs have been taken into account. The 
development of the manufacturing process and the control strategy is based on a QbD approach 
and is generally considered justified. A very similar approach has already been found acceptable for 
other authorised Roche monoclonal antibodies. The QbD approach used for the development and 
control of the manufacturing process has been extensively explained in this application. The control 
strategy is considered sufficient to guarantee consistent quality of emicizumab. Specification limits 
and analytical methods are suitable to control the quality of the active substance and finished 
product.  
The stability program is in general considered satisfactory. The results generated during the 
stability studies support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
Sufficiently detailed data and documents have been provided indicating that the quality of the 
active substance and finished product are well controlled.  
Information about the active substance and finished product was of acceptable quality. The 
manufacturing processes of the active substance and finished product have been adequately 
described and have been satisfactorily validated. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to 
the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a 
satisfactory way. 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
To support the registration of Hemlibra, a series of in vitro studies were performed to characterise 
the binding of emicizumab to activated and non-activated Factor IX and X and the effects on Factor 
X activation, Factor IX activation, prothrombin activation, thrombin generation and activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT).  
In addition, the haemostatic potency of emicizumab was evaluated in vivo, in the Cynomolgus 
monkey. 
The potential for emicizumab to promote Fc effector function was also investigated. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
FVIII  is  a  glycoprotein  found  in  plasma  that,  in  its  activated  form,  serves  as  a  co-factor  for  FIXa 
and FX, facilitating the reaction whereby FX is catalysed to FXa. After coagulation is initiated by the 
complex  of  exposed  tissue  factor  (TF)  and  activated  factor  VII  (FVIIa)  in  the  plasma  and  a  small 
amount  of  thrombin  is  produced,  FVIII  undergoes  enzymatic  cleavage  by  thrombin  and  is 
converted  into  activated  FVIII  (FVIIIa).  Because  it  enhances  the  FIXa−induced  FX  activation 
reaction  by  200,000-fold;  FVIIIa  plays  a  critical  role  in  accelerating  the  explosive  coagulation 
reaction during the propagation phase of the blood coagulation reaction process. A dysfunction at 
this  central  point  in  haemostasis  is  therefore  associated  with  severe  bleeding  complications  of  a 
broad spectrum of locations. 
An overview of the coagulation system with its activation (solid and dotted arrow headed lines) and 
inhibition pathways (bar-headed lines) is presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Coagulation Pathway 
Hemlibra is a humanised monoclonal modified immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody with a bispecific 
antibody  structure,  produced  by  recombinant  DNA  technology  in  Chinese  hamster  ovary  cells. 
Hemlibra  bridges  activated  factor  IX  and  factor  X  mediating  the  activation  of  the  latter.  This  is 
normally  the  function  of  coagulation  factor  VIII,  which  is  missing  in  haemophilia  A  patients.  This 
bispecific antibody restores the function of missing activated factor VIII that is needed for effective 
haemostasis. In patients with haemophilia A, haemostasis can be re-established irrespective of the 
presence  of  FVIII  inhibitors,  as  Hemlibra  shares  no  sequence  homology  with  FVIII.  The  figure 
below  summarises  the  interactions  of  FVIIIa  (part  A)  or  emicizumab  (part  B)  with  FIX/FIXa  and 
FX/FXa.  
The mode of action of emicizumab and how it compares to that of FVIIIa, is shown in Figure 2.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The in vitro data presented demonstrate that emicizumab has a moderate bispecific target binding 
affinity for activated and non-activated FIX and FX in the micromolar range.  
Characterisation  of  the  binding  epitopes  revealed  that  emicizumab  binds  to  the  EGF1  domain  of 
FIX/FIXa and to the EGF2 domain of FX/FXa. Although EGF domains are expressed in other vitamin 
K-dependent  coagulation-related  proteins,  emicizumab  did  not  bind  FVII,  FXII,  or  Protein  C, 
demonstrating clear binding specificity for FIX/FIXa and FX/FXa. 
The  applicant  characterised  the  functional  activity  of  emicizumab  and  investigated  the  effect  on 
human FX activation. The data demonstrate that emicizumab promotes activation of FX by FIXa in 
the absence of FVIIIa and thus it has the potential to functionally restore haemostatic activity.  
Figure 3: Effect of Hemlibra on activation of factor X by activated factor IX 
The  Michaelis-Menten  kinetics  of  substrate  FX  were calculated  to  assess  the  catalytic  efficiency  of 
emicizumab. In comparison to FVIIIa, the estimated Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of emicizumab 
was  lower,  indicating  stronger  binding  interaction  to  FIXa  and  FX,  but  the  catalytic  efficiency 
(kcat/Km)  to  promote  the  turnover  of  the  reaction  was  only  ~9%  of  the  catalytic  efficiency  of 
FVIIIa.

Emicizumab  was  tested  in  an  aPTT  clotting  test  in  human  congenital  FVIII-deficient  plasma  with 
normal  levels  of  von  Willebrand  factor  activity  and  pathologically  prolonged  aPTT  clotting  time  at 
baseline. Emicizumab caused a concentration-dependent reduction in aPTT and reduced it down to 
normal  range,  exhibiting  procoagulant  activity  with  a  minimum  effective  concentration  of  0.01

of  FVIII  at  physiological  concentrations  of  1  IU/mL,  aPTT  normalisation  was  reached  with 
emicizumab  concentrations  of  around  or  below  10  µg/mL.  Hence,  emicizumab  demonstrated 
functional  FVIIIa  mimetic  activity  and  showed  its  potential  to  effectively  restore  dysfunctional 
haemostasis in FVIII-deficient human plasma. 
Figure 4: Effect of CH5534262 on activated partial thromboplastin time in haemophilia 
plasma 
A  thrombin  generation  assay  was  performed  to  quantify  the  total  amount  of  thrombin  generated 
after activation, permitting analysis of the kinetics of and capacity for thrombin formation and thus 
giving further insight into the initiation, propagation and termination phases of coagulation. Hence, 
the  potential  to  generate  thrombin  was  also  investigated.  In  FVIII-deficient  human  plasma, 
emicizumab  promotes  concentration-dependent  thrombin  generation  in  the  presence  of  FXIa.  The 
shortening of the time to onset of thrombin generation (lag time) suggests an effect on the initial 
phase  of  coagulation,  a  finding  consistent  with  the  reduction  of  aPTT.  More  importantly, 
emicizumab  also  promotes  thrombin  generation  during  the  propagation  phase  of  coagulation,  as 
indicated  by  the  increase  in  peak  free  thrombin  concentration  (peak  height)  and  endogenous 
thrombin  forming  capacity.  In  inhibitor-positive  plasma  emicizumab  (1  nM  to  1  µM)  showed 
increased thrombin peak height and reduced APTT in a manner that was comparable to its activity 
in inhibitor-negative plasma.

A  study  was  conducted  to  investigate  whether  binding  of  emicizumab  to  FIX  and  FX  inhibits 
activation.  Emicizumab  significantly  inhibited  activity  in  three  FIX-  and  FX-dependent  reaction 
steps: 
 
 
 
FX  activation  by  FIXa/FVIIIa  (N3  reaction).  For  this  reaction  pathway,  emicizumab  has 
bifunctional binding activity and the inhibition was particularly pronounced at 10 µg/mL 
FX activation by FVIIa/TF (N5 reaction) and 
Prothrombin activation by FXa/FVa (N6 reaction). 
Given the potential inhibitory effects on 3 FIX/FX-dependent reactions as reported in vitro, two in 
vivo  investigative  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  potential  for  high  local  exposure  of 
emicizumab to inhibit blood coagulation.  
No evidence of local inhibitory activity or exacerbation of local or systemic bleeding at areas of high 
local emicizumab exposure was observed. SC administration of high doses of emicizumab (up to 30 
mg/kg;  118  or  120  mg/mL)  to  Cynomolgus  monkeys  with  acquired  haemophilia  A  did  not 
exacerbate bleeding at the injection site compared to vehicle. This was confirmed in a second study 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 27/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where SC administration of 10 mg/kg (80 mg/mL formulation) did not exacerbate bleeding even in 
the presence of trauma-injury. Taken together, the anticoagulant potential of emicizumab identified 
in a series of in vitro tests (at 100 µg/mL) did not translate into a risk of systemic bleeding in vivo. 
In an enzyme assay using purified Cynomolgus monkey, rat and mouse FIXa and FX, emicizumab 
was  found  to  cross-react  only  with  the  corresponding  clotting  factors  of  Cynomolgus  monkeys. 
Binding of monkey FIX and FX to emicizumab was comparable to emicizumab binding to hFIX and 
hFX; however, the responses for human FX were slightly higher than that observed for monkey FX 
(e.g. response at 160 nM FX: 13 ± 0.2 for cy vs 25.7 ± 0.2 for human). The difference in binding 
activity translated to a difference in the capacity to generate thrombin; whereby the concentrations 
of  emicizumab  required  to  reproduce  the  activity  of  a  given  concentration  of  porcine  FVIII  was 
higher  in  monkey  FVIII-neutralised  plasma  when  compared  to  human  FVIII-neutralised  plasma. 
However,  it  is  evident  that  the  observed  difference  was  attributed  to  inter-animal  variability  as 
opposed to inter-species differences. 
Emicizumab  significantly  inhibited  Cynomolgus  monkey  FX  activation  by  FIXa/FVIIIa  (IC50  0.17 
mg/mL),  FX  activation  by  FVIIa/tissue  factor  (IC50  0.57  mg/mL)  and  prothrombin  activation  by 
FXa/FVa  (IC50  0.75  mg/mL);  it  is  noted  that  the  IC50  values  for  Cynomolgus  monkey  were 
consistently higher 8.1, 4.4 and 3.3-fold higher than those observed for the purified human factors, 
respectively. However, the inhibition of FX activation in the monkey was not translatable to the in 
vivo  situation  and  hence  the  difference  in  the  observed  potency  was  not  deemed  to  be  relevant. 
Moreover,  the  difference  in  the  capacity  of  emicizumab  to  generate  thrombin  in  monkey  plasma 
was generally comparable to that observed in human plasma as outlined previously. 
An  acute  model  of  haemophilia  A  was  established  in  the  monkey  whereby  FVIII-deficiency  was 
induced (on Day 0) via a single IV injection of the mouse hybridoma VIII-2236 antibody. Trauma-
induced  bleeding  caused  a  reduction  in  haemoglobin  levels,  bruising  on  the  skin  surface,  an 
increase  in  APTT  (indicator  of  FVIII  depletion),  but no  effect on  prothrombin time  (PT)  during  the 
observation period (Days 0 to 3). Pre-treatment with emicizumab (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 50 and 200 mg/kg 
SC)  on  Day  -4  caused  a  dose-dependent  attenuation  of  the  Hb  loss,  skin  bruising  and  APTT 
prolongation,  whereby  the  higher  doses  caused  maximum  restoration  of  some  of  the  parameters. 
Similarly,  intravenous  treatment  with  emicizumab  at  0.3  to  3  mg/kg  caused  a  dose-dependent 
attenuation of haemostatic dysfunction when administered after bleeding induction. 
In  a  chronic  haemophilia  A  model,  Cynomolgus  monkeys  were  given  weekly  injections  of  the 
chimeric  mouse-monkey  anti  primate  FVIII-neutralising  antibody.  This  model  bears  a  closer 
resemblance  to  human  hereditary  haemophilia  A  with  characteristic  spontaneous  bleeding; 
however,  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  bleeding  sites  are  not  identical  to  those  which  present 
clinically. Emicizumab, when administered subcutaneously at a starting dose of 3.97 mg/kg on Day 
0 and then from Day 7 onwards at 1 mg/kg/week, prevented spontaneous intra-articular bleeding 
and  other  bleeding  symptoms  similar  to  haemostatic  complications  in  human  haemophilia  A  (e.g. 
bruising  on  the  skin  surface,  haematuria).  It  is  noted  however,  that  there  was  no  significant 
difference  per  se  in  the  mean  Hb  levels  when  compared  the  emicizumab  to  the  control  group  at 
each timepoint over the 8-week period; this may be due to the observed variability in the vehicle 
group. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The Fc receptors, FcγRI, FcγRIIa (167Arg and 167His), FcγRIIIa (176Phe and 176Val), FcγRIIIb 
(Neutrophil antigen 1 and 2) and C1q protein are known to mediate Fc effector function. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 28/126 
 
 
 
 
The binding activity of emicizumab was compared to the IgG4 antibody, natalizumab with 
absent/low Fc effector functionality and that of the IgG1 antibody rituximab which has full Fc 
effector functionality. The binding to the Fcγ receptors evaluated was generally similar to that 
observed with the IgG4 antibody, natalizumab, with the exception of the fact that observed binding 
to the inhibitory receptor, hFcγRIIb with emicizumab was higher. When comparing the binding 
activities for emicizumab vs. rituximab, again, it was only the binding to the inhibitory Fc receptor, 
FcγRIIb that exceeded that observed for the reference antibody rituximab. Interestingly, the 
binding profiles observed with Cynomolgus monkey Fcγ receptors was generally in line with that 
observed for human; hence, the monkey is considered suitable for the evaluation of potential Fc 
effector functions in vivo. 
The low binding activity of emicizumab to C1q protein was similar to that of natalizumab and 
suggests that the proposed product is unlikely to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity. 
Taken together these data are suggestive of a low potential for Fc effector function. 
The extent of the binding activity of emicizumab to FcRn is comparable to natalizumab and this 
binding is consistent with its long half-life. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Separate  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  not performed  which  is  acceptable  and  in  accordance 
with the ICH S6 (R1) guideline.  
The  safety  pharmacology  endpoints  were  evaluated  during  the  repeated-dose  toxicity  studies 
described in Section 2.3.4 of this report. No effects on the CNS, respiratory or CNS were identified.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Interactions with FVIII and by-passing agents 
The currently available medicines for the treatment of haemophilia A are plasma-derived or 
recombinant FVIII and bypassing agents, rFVIIa and/or activated prothrombin complex concentrate 
(aPCC). Due to their mode of action, bypassing agents rFVIIa and aPCC have the potential to 
interact with emicizumab. As these agents might be given to emicizumab-treated haemophilia A 
patients as on-demand treatment for bleeding events, the potential procoagulant liability of 
concomitant use of these agents with emicizumab was investigated in vitro and in vivo. 
In vitro effects of emicizumab in combination with FVIII and by-passing agents 
The  effects  of  emicizumab  on  the  actions  of  FVIII  and  bypassing  agents  were  investigated  in  a 
thrombin  generation  assay  in  human  haemophilia  A  plasma.  For  the  combination  of  emicizumab 
and FVIII, thrombin generation was determined via activation of the intrinsic pathway with FXIa as 
the starting reagent. Under the extrinsic pathway-triggered assay conditions, in the absence or in 
the  presence  of  low  concentrations  of  rFVIIa  (0.5  µg/mL),  emicizumab  at  ≥  100  µg/mL,  delayed 
the  thrombin  generation  starting  time  of  FX-related  reactions  within  the  extrinsic  coagulation 
pathway. However, emicizumab increased the ETP and peak height in the presence of rFVIIa (≤15 
µg/mL),  indicating  that  concomitant  use  of  rFVIIa  and  emicizumab  further  enhanced  thrombin 
generation during the propagation phase. 
Emicizumab did not change the lag time, but shortened the ttPeak and increased the ETP and peak 
height in the presence of aPCC and thus significantly enhanced thrombin generation during the 
initiation and propagation phase. In haemophilia A, the rate of FIX-catalysed FX activation is 
extremely low. It is increased in the presence of emicizumab, but the reaction rate is even further 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 29/126 
 
 
 
 
increased in the presence of elevated plasma concentrations of the aPCC components, thus 
promoting disproportionate haemostatic activity (a 2.6 and 5-fold increase in peak height and 
endogenous thrombin potential, respectively).  
In vivo effects of emicizumab in combination with FVIII and by-passing agents 
The effect of co-administration of emicizumab and bypassing agents (rFVIIa and aPCC) on 
thrombus formation was investigated in a Cynomolgus monkey model of FVIII-neutralised 
haemophilia A/venous stasis. No thrombi were seen in either the jugular vein or the femoral vein in 
the untreated control group and the 3 mg/kg emicizumab-only group. Thrombus formation was 
observed in the rFVIIa and aPCC groups. There was no significant difference between these two 
groups, although a tendency towards a higher thrombus weight was seen in the aPCC group. The 
sum of thrombus weights in the combination dose groups increased above the levels noted in the 
rFVIIa and aPCC groups, although the individual measured thrombi did not exceed the levels 
observed with either compound alone. The platelet counts, fibrinogen concentration, FDP 
concentration and D-dimer concentration do not indicate enhanced systemic coagulation or 
fibrinolysis in any group. 
In vivo effects of emicizumab ± in combination with FVIII and Bypassing Agents 
The effect of emicizumab on thrombus formation was compared to that of rFVIIa and FVIII 
treatment in a model of venous stasis in normocoagulative Cynomolgus monkeys. Almost no 
thrombus formation was observed at the site of stasis in the untreated control group. In contrast, 
thrombus weight increased significantly at the site of stasis in the positive control group that 
received 120 µg/kg rFVIIa IV. Thrombi also formed at the stasis site in the groups that received 
emicizumab (1 and 2 mg/kg IV) or FVIII (25 U/kg); however, the total thrombus weights in these 
groups were not markedly higher than those in the rFVIIa group. Immediately after IV injection of 
1 or 1+2 mg/kg emicizumab, the mean ± SD plasma concentrations were 23.3 ± 6.3 µg/mL and 
49.4 ± 9.8 µg/mL, respectively. 
Interference with various diagnostic assays 
Emicizumab  greatly  shortens  aPTT  even  at  concentrations  far  below  the  clinical  effective 
concentrations.  Thus,  emicizumab  may  also  interfere  with  any  other  aPTT-based  diagnostic  test, 
such  as  the  FVIII  one-stage  activity  assay,  whereas  assays  of  the  extrinsic  coagulation  cascade, 
such as PT, are not significantly affected. 
The aim of the interference studies was to evaluate the effects of emicizumab on a variety of in 
vitro assay systems used as diagnostics related to haemostasis and coagulation. Emicizumab has 
the potential to interact with aPTT diagnostic tests but has also highlighted a series of diagnostic 
tests that are not affected. Such assays should therefore not be used for monitoring patients 
treated with emicizumab. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of emicizumab were studied in mice and in Cynomolgus monkeys. The 
monkey was identified as the most relevant species as it was shown to cross react with 
emicizumab. In the vast majority of the nonclinical studies, emicizumab was administered via the 
SC route administration as this mimics the proposed clinical route. 
The analytical methods used for the toxicokinetic analyses for the pivotal toxicity studies were 
sufficiently validated. The analytical methods (ELISA) used had sufficient selectivity and 
reproducibility to determine emicizumab in Cynomolgus monkey plasma over the range of 0.01 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 30/126 
 
 
 
 
μg/mL to 0.4 μg/mL. The narrow range was noted however no effects on the determination were 
observed by diluting up to 40,000-fold. 
An electro chemiluminescence immunoassays was developed for the analysis of anti-drug 
antibodies (ADA) in monkey plasma. Upon review of the analytical report, it was noted that on Day 
2, intra-day precision values, were not adopted because electro-chemiluminescent (ECL) signals 
were high and inter-day precision, C.V. (%), did not meet the acceptance criteria. However, two 
additional assays were performed to confirm the variation of ECL signals. This deviation is not 
considered to affect the overall interpretation of the data generated. 
In the mouse, following a single subcutaneous administration of emicizumab (1 mg/kg), Cmax 
occurred at 1 to 3 days post-dose, apparent T1/2 was 17.6 days and bioavailability was estimated 
to be 84.3%. In the monkey, following administration of emicizumab (0.06 to 6 mg/kg), apparent 
t1/2 was independent of dose and ranged from 23.6 to 26.5 days and bioavailability was said to be 
complete at 102%. Exposures (Cmax and AUC) increased in a dose-proportional manner. The 
observed slow clearance is consistent with the observed FcRn affinity reported. No changes in 
concentrations of blood coagulation factors IX and X were noted after single SC administration of 
emicizumab at 0.06 to 6 mg/kg. This suggests that the binding to emicizumab does not change the 
turnover of FIX or FX. This is consistent with the binding affinity (low µM range) of emicizumab for 
FIX and FX. 
Following repeated SC administration of emicizumab in the monkey, where doses of up to 30 
mg/kg were administered for up to 26 weeks, exposures increased with dose and accumulated 
upon repeated dosing (by 2-7-fold), which is consistent with the long t1/2. 
Anti-drug antibodies were detected in the single dose studies (mouse: in 1/5 animals; monkey 2/6) 
in the 13-week study (in 7/29 animals) and in the 26-week study (in 9/30 animals). Some of the 
ADA-positive animals did exhibit faster elimination of emicizumab; those demonstrating a complete 
loss of exposure tested positive for neutralising antibodies. However, all samples could not be 
assessed for neutralising activity as the high concentrations of emicizumab interfered with the 
antibody characterisation assay. 
No studies to evaluate the distribution, metabolism, excretion or potential to cause 
pharmacokinetic interactions were conducted which is in line with the ICH S6 guideline (R1) 
Preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals 
[EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998. 
Overall, the pharmacokinetic aspects of the non-clinical package are considered to be adequate. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The studies performed in support of this application are summarised in table below and it is evident 
that pivotal studies were conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice.

Table 2: Toxicology studies performed with emicizumab 
Single dose toxicity 
While no single dose studies were performed, No acute toxicological were noted following the first 
IV administration at 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg or SC administration at 1, 6, or 30 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Intravenous study 
Emicizumab was administered to Cynomolgus monkeys aged 3 to 4 years at 0 (vehicle control), 
10, 30, and 100 mg/kg [n=3/sex/group]) QW for 4 weeks (5 times in total). Two additional 
animals/sex in the control and at 100 mg/kg were monitored for a 4-week recovery period. Vehicle 
solution consisted of 20 mmol/L histidine-aspartate buffer containing 150 mmol/L arginine-
aspartate and 0.5 mg/mL poloxamer 188, pH 6.0 (excipients in line with those within the final 
product). The administration was conducted at a volume of 1.22 mL/kg and at a rate of 4 mL/min 
with a syringe pump. 
No emicizumab-related deaths or moribundity were observed when Emicizumab was administered 
to Cynomolgus monkeys aged 3 to 4 years at 0 (vehicle control), 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg 
[n=3/sex/group]) QW for 4 weeks (5 times in total)(intravenous study). No emicizumab-related 
abnormalities were noted in clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, Holter 
electrocardiography, ophthalmoscopy, urinalysis, blood chemistry, necropsy, organ weight, 
histopathology, or plasma cytokine analysis in any animals. In addition, no changes in reproductive 
organs of males and females were noted. 
A shortening of aPTT was noted in all groups treated with emicizumab during the treatment and 
recovery. This was attributed to the pharmacological properties of emicizumab. 
In 1 female at 100 mg/kg/week, periarteritis in several organs was found histopathologically, 
suggesting polyarteritis had developed in this animal. Several haematology and blood chemistry 
changes related to inflammation were also observed. However, these inflammatory markers tended 
to recover during the dosing period. The cause of the polyarteritis was unclear, but was considered 
to be incidental and not related to emicizumab based on the following reasons:(1) spontaneous 
polyarteritis with similar changes have been reported in Cynomolgus monkeys [Study 1076956; 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 32/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
short report summarising historical data which reports incidence of polyarteritis in 2013: 6/841 
males and 3/788 females, Porter et al. 2003]; (2)some of the abnormal clinical pathology values 
improved while emicizumab exposure was maintained; (3) this change only occurred in one female 
in this study (out of a total of 88 monkeys that received emicizumab in the general toxicity 
studies). 
Immune-mediated vascular injury such as that arising from type III hypersensitivity reaction 
involving immune complexes is sometimes seen with biological therapeutics evaluated in 
Cynomolgus monkeys. An antibody response to a test article can result in the deposition of 
immune complexes, evident as granular deposits in arteries or in kidney glomeruli [Rojko et al. 
2014]. No ADAs were detected in this animal and there was no evidence for loss of exposure after 
repeated dosing. However, the possibility that polyarteritis observed in this one female given 100 
mg/kg/week IV for 4 weeks is immune-mediated cannot be completely ruled out. 
Plasma concentrations of emicizumab decreased gradually during recovery but were still observed 
until 4 weeks after the last dose. ADAs were not detected in any animals during the dosing or 
recovery periods. 
Subcutaneous study 
Emicizumab was administered SC at 0 (vehicle control), 1, 6 and 30 mg/kg to Cynomolgus 
monkeys (n=1/sex/group) QW for 4 weeks (total of 5 doses) to assess toxicity and systemic 
exposure. 
APTT shortening was observed at all dose levels as well as elevation of coagulation FVIII activity at 
≥ 6 mg/kg/week doses. These were attributed to the pharmacological effect of emicizumab. In 
addition, the activity of coagulation FIX and FX was elevated at 30 mg/kg/week. These 
observations were not considered toxicologically significant as no changes in fibrinolytic markers, 
such as FDP (fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products) and D-dimer, or emicizumab-related 
thrombotic changes were observed. 
Perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells in the subcutis at the injection sites was observed at 
all doses. This change was considered to be caused by high protein concentration at the injection 
site. Additionally, follicular hyperplasia of the axillary lymph node at the site of administration was 
observed in one male at 6 mg/kg/week and considered to be related to an inflammatory response 
at the injection site. 
A dark-red area in the subcutis of individual injection sites was observed at all doses at necropsy, 
and correlated with slight haemorrhage observed microscopically. Slight haemorrhage in the 
subcutis, without a necropsy finding, was observed at an injection site in one male at 30 
mg/kg/week. In the subcutis at the injection site, slight degeneration/necrosis and swelling of 
endothelium were noted in one female at 1 mg/kg/week and in one male and one female at 30 
mg/kg/week. Additionally, slight neutrophil infiltration in the subcutis at the injection site was 
observed in one female at 1 mg/kg/week. 
No emicizumab-related changes were observed in general condition, body weight, FOB, food 
consumption, ophthalmoscopy, electrocardiography, urinalysis, blood chemistry, lymphocyte subset 
test, cytokine measurement, bone marrow examination and organ weight. 
Exposure to emicizumab during repeated administrations was maintained during the treatment 
period and documented with measurements of steady-state concentration at the end of a dosing 
interval (i.e., just prior to next drug administration) (Ctrough). Anti-emicizumab antibodies were 
not detected in any emicizumab-treated animals.

Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies were not performed as it is not expected that IgGs would interact directly with 
DNA or other chromosomal material in accordance with ICH S6 (R1): Preclinical safety evaluation 
of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals [EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998]. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not performed which is acceptable and in line with ICH S6 (R1). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The effects of emicizumab on fertility were assessed in the 13-week SC GLP toxicity study in 
Cynomolgus monkeys (the animals were 3 years old at the start of dosing) and the 26-week SC 
GLP toxicity study in mature Cynomolgus monkeys (4 to 6 years old at the start of dosing). 
Emicizumab did not cause any toxicological changes on male or female reproductive organs at 
doses up to 30 mg/kg/week in either of these studies. In the 26-week study, the effect of 
emicizumab on fertility (sperm analysis, menstrual cycles) was also evaluated. No toxicological 
effects on fertility were observed in this study. 
Moreover, in the 4-week IV GLP toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys aged 3-4 years, 
emicizumab did not cause any toxicological changes in the reproductive organs of male or female 
Cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 100 mg/kg/week. 
No data are available with respect to potential effects of emicizumab on embryofetal development. 
The available data on the pharmacological action of emicizumab and the results of the general 
toxicity studies do not suggest that emicizumab might interfere with embryofetal development. In 
addition, as the vast majority of haemophilia A patients are males, this is relevant for only a small 
subset of patients. 
Juvenile studies were not performed. However, the available 13-week SC toxicity study in monkeys 
of 3 years of age with once weekly dosing supports treatment of adolescent humans at 12 years of 
age and older [Baldrick 2010]. Toxicology studies in juvenile animals have not been conducted and 
are  not  considered  meaningful  for  emicizumab.  Fetal  synthesis  of  clotting  factors  is  low,  begins 
early at about gestation week 5 and reaches measurable but low levels at week 20 until parturition 
[Reverdiau-Moalic et al. 1996]. Some components of the haemostatic system such as protein C and 
fibrinogen  even  have  fetal  forms  with  different  activity  to  the  adult  forms  [Jaffray  and  Young 
2013].

AUC and Cmax were determined at last dose (4th, 13th, 26th) in animals. 
Human exposure achieved at 24 weeks treated at 3 mg/kg QW AUCT 783 µg.day/ml  
The NOAEL dose of 30 mg/kg in the 26-week study (1060134) resulted in a steady state 
AUC0−168h (AUC0−168h ss) exposure of 8680 µg.d/mL. This is approximately 11-fold above the 
clinical exposure in a 3 mg/kg QW dosing regimen which is the regimen that is anticipated to yield 
the highest exposure in patients.

haemorrhage, perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration and degeneration/necrosis of subcutis and 
swelling of endothelium in the subcutis were retrieved. 
Other toxicity studies 
In an in vitro study of cytokine release that used the whole blood of healthy adults, the levels of 
cytokine induced by emicizumab were comparable to those induced by panitumumab, a reference 
antibody with low clinical risk. 
In a tissue cross-reactivity assay in normal human tissue (GLP), staining of intracytoplasmic 
granules was observed in liver hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, bone marrow cells (along with 
extracellular granules), thyroid follicular epithelium, and the adrenal cortex (inner zona reticularis). 
It is considered unlikely that serious adverse drug reactions will develop in humans because it is 
unlikely that emicizumab will enter the cytoplasm in vivo. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the CHMP guideline for Environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for 
human use” [EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2], as the proposed product falls within the 
classification of a products containing vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, 
carbohydrates and lipids as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an environmental risk assessment 
(ERA) is not required. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Emicizumab acts as a FVIII-mimetic, whereby it promotes activation of FX by FIXa in the absence 
of FVIIIa. The Michaelis-Menten kinetics of this reaction were calculated to assess the catalytic 
efficiency of emicizumab. In comparison to FVIIIa, the estimated Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of 
emicizumab was lower, indicating stronger binding interaction to FIXa and FX, but the catalytic 
efficiency (kcat/Km) to promote the turnover of the reaction was only ~9% of the catalytic efficiency 
of FVIIIa. The applicant clarified that in contrast to FVIII, emicizumab, does not require activation 
by thrombin but the molecular conditions required to promote cofactor activity are nearly identical. 
Emicizumab has to form a correctly arranged complex with platelet-bound FIXa and FX, in order to 
place the FIXa protease contact region in close proximity to the FX cleavage site for subsequent FX 
activation. The functional activity of emicizumab is not only due to its binding constants to FIXa 
and FX, but also to its appropriate structure and flexibility in the non-antigen-contacting region 
allowing full cofactor activity. Emicizumab with its bispecific binding but only single point binding 
sites on both FIXa and FX cannot equally substitute the complex binding interaction and functional 
potency of human FVIII. The moderate binding affinity to the EGF1 and EGF2 domains allows 
efficient FIXa-FX crosslinking while maintaining sufficient steric flexibility within both catalytic 
domains for interaction and activation of FX. As emicizumab, in contrast to FVIIIa, does not directly 
promote the steric optimisation of the complex by additional binding interactions, the overall 
catalytic efficiency is expected to be lower than that of FVIIIa. 
Models of haemophilia A in cynomolgus monkeys were established to investigate the effects of 
emicizumab on haemostasis under FVIII deficiency in vivo. While the results are supportive of the 
proposed use, at the time of initial application, the models were poorly characterised. However, 
adequate justification of the choice of parameters measured was subsequently provided. 
As FVIII is a foreign substance to those who are FVIII-deficient, FVIII therapy may cause 
haemophilia A patients to develop antibodies to FVIII (inhibitors). Patients with inhibitors are

treated with agents which stimulate coagulation pathways that bypass the FVIII-dependent 
coagulation pathway. A series of in vitro and in vivo studies were therefore conducted to explore 
the thrombogenic risk associated with emicizumab, FVIII, FVIIa and/or activated prothrombin 
complex concentrates (aPCC, a heterogenous mixture of prothrombin, FIX and FX) when 
administered in combination. 
For the thrombin generation assay, the calibrator accounts for and corrects the fluorescence 
quenching effect of the plasma sample and substrate depletion in order to provide an accurate 
thrombin concentration readout. For this to work correctly, the proportion of the plasma sample in 
the test well has to be exactly the same as that in the calibrator well. It is evident that 40 µL of 
plasma was used for the test wells and 80 µL of plasma (as recommended by the manufacturer of 
the kit) was used for the calibrator wells. However, the applicant clarified that equivalent volumes 
of plasma were used for both test and calibrator wells. 
To support the clinical use of emicizumab at the maximum dose of 3 mg/kg/week, repeated SC 
studies of up to 26 weeks duration have been conducted in the monkey, which is supportive of the 
proposed use. Upon request, the applicant has confirmed that the relevant endpoints to detect 
effects on the central nervous system, respiratory system and reproductive function were assessed 
during the pivotal 26-week study and that no treatment-related effects were noted. The reported 
differences in APTT during the 26-week study were attributed the fact that different reagents were 
used (evidence in support of the variability and difference in the sensitivity of different reagents for 
APTT assays has been provided). In addition, the observed increase in the levels of D-dimer 
(fibrinolytic marker) in some animals was either small when compared to baseline, within 
background range, was not dose-related, and had no effect on associated parameters such as the 
development of thrombi (as observed during hispathological examination). The applicant has also 
clarified that the non-clinical batches used during the pivotal studies are representative of the final 
commercial product. 
The age of the animals used in the 13-week and 26 week studies in the Cynomolgus monkey 
correspond to patients ≥12 years old and adolescents or older. The applicant is proposing to use 
the product in paediatric patients at ≤ 2 years and >2 years. It is accepted that the human 
coagulation cascade reaches maturity at a very young age and that juvenile studies per se are 
unlikely to contribute any useful data (as agreed as per CHMP Sci Advice July 2015). However, the 
applicant was asked to identify all of the factors likely to contribute differences in exposure in the 
proposed paediatric population (when compared to adults), discuss whether the existing non-
clinical data support the proposed exposures in this subpopulation and provide a thorough 
discussion as to how the pharmacokinetic profile in paediatric patients ≤2 years and >2 years is 
likely to compare to that observed in the patients studied thus far. The applicant provided 
additional clinical data which confirmed similarity of exposure (emicizumab trough plasma 
concentration) between children (1 to ≤12 years), adolescents, and adults with the maintenance 
dose of 1.5 mg/kg/week. The applicant also provided a discussion of the changes in physiology in 
children and states that some uncertainty remains with respect to any potential changes in 
clearance/pharmacokinetic profile of monoclonal antibody in general. From a non-clinical 
perspective, the additional clinical PK data do support treatment of paediatric patients ≥1 year but 
not for patients <1 year. See clinical aspects for further information. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical perspective, the data provided support safety in the paediatric population in 
patients ≥1 year. Please see section 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy which provides the 
justification for the granting of the indication below 1 year of age.

Clinical pharmacokinetic data have been obtained from 6 clinical trials.  
The pharmacokinetic data submitted are from a single ascending dose study (ACE001JP Parts A 
and B), a multiple ascending dose study (ACE001JP Part C) conducted in healthy volunteers and its 
extension Study ACE002JP, which recruited patients with haemophilia A; a relative and absolute

bioavailability/site of administration study (JP29574) appreciating manufacturing changes prior to 
initiation of the Phase III trials.  
Pharmacokinetic data are available for 108 healthy subjects and 141 patients with haemophilia.  
In addition, sparse plasma sampling for PK and PD analyses were performed in all patients in the 
Phase III studies. 
Phase I trial ACE001JP 
Part A: Placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, inter-individual, subcutaneous single 
ascending dose study in healthy Japanese adult male volunteers (5 dose level: 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 
0.3 and 1mg/kg with each 6 subjects per group plus 2 subjects on placebo/ dose level). 
Part B: Placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, inter-individual, subcutaneous single 
ascending dose study in healthy Caucasian adult male volunteers (3 dose level: 0.1, 0.3 and 
1mg/kg with each 6 subjects per group plus 2 subjects on placebo/ dose level). 
Part C: Open-label, inter-individual, subcutaneous multiple-ascending dose study in Japanese 
patients with haemophilia A (3 dose level including loading doses: 1 and 0.3; 3 and 1; only 3 
mg/kg with each 6 subjects per group). 
The dose escalation was done in a stepwise approach. PK samples were collected in Part A and B 
pre-administration, 8hrs, 24, 48, 72, 96 hrs, days 6 to 8, 11, 15, weekly until week 8, biweekly 
until week 12, then every 4 weeks until week 24. This was the same for Part C, but continued 4 
weekly beyond week 24 until week 48. PD samples in Part A and B were collected pre-
administration, day 3, 5, 8, followed by every other week until week 16; weeks 20, 24, and 
extended to week 36 and 48 in Part C. 
Extension study ACE002JP: open label extension of Part C of the ACE001JP study (see 
also Section 3.6 Supportive studies) 
This study is an open-label extension of Part C of the ACE001JP study, hence also conducted as an 
unblinded study without any control group. PK and PD samples were collected at the same 
timepoints as Part C of study ACE001JP and 4 weekly post-Week 24 (arbitrary) and every 12 
weeks as well as at last observation. For more details on this study see Section 2.5 Supportive 
Studies.  
Study JP29574: randomized, open-label, parallel group study in healthy adult male 
Japanese subjects 
This study evaluated the relative and absolute bioavailability of Hemlibra across preparations and 
injection sites of subcutaneous Hemlibra in 60 healthy adult Japanese males in a randomized, 
open-label, parallel-group design. It was conducted at CPC Clinical Trial Hospital at Medipolis 
Research Institute (Japan). The study was initiated after changes to the drug substance 
manufacturing process, including the master cell bank (see also Quality AR; old: G1; new: G2.1) 
and changes in the preparation concentration prior to initiation of the pivotal studies using the new 
preparation (old: 80 mg/mL; new: 150 mg/mL).  
The primary objective for this study was to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and relative 
bioavailability of single subcutaneous doses of the old and new preparations of Hemlibra; the 
safety, pharmacokinetics, and relative bioavailability of single subcutaneous doses of the new 
Hemlibra preparation when administered to the abdomen, upper arm, and thigh; and to investigate 
the absolute bioavailability of subcutaneous dosing of the new Hemlibra preparation. With the 
secondary objectives similar to the primary but relating to the PD responses.

Absorption  
Following subcutaneous administration in haemophilia A patients, the absorption half-life was 
1.7 days.  
Following multiple subcutaneous administrations of 3 mg/kg once weekly for the first 4 weeks in 
haemophilia A patients, mean (±SD) trough plasma concentrations of emicizumab increased to 
achieve 54.6±14.3 µg/mL at Week 5. Trough plasma concentrations of approximately 50 µg/mL 
were sustained thereafter with weekly dosing of 1.5 mg/kg Figure 6. 
Figure 6: Studies BH29884 (adult and adolescent study) and BH29992 (paediatric 
study): mean emicizumab trough plasma concentrations (µg/mL) 
The predicted mean (±SD) Ctrough and Cmax at steady state were 52.2±13.5 μg/mL and 
56.5±13.5 μg/mL, respectively. The mean (±SD) ratio of Cmax/Ctrough at steady state was 
1.07±0.03. 
In healthy subjects, the absolute bioavailability following subcutaneous administration of 1 mg/kg 
was between 80.4% and 93.1% depending on the injection site. Similar pharmacokinetic profiles 
were observed following subcutaneous administration in the abdomen, upper arm, and thigh. 
Emicizumab can be administered interchangeably at these anatomical sites. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding 
Because emicizumab is a monoclonal antibody, traditional protein binding studies were not 
conducted. 
Volume of distribution 
Following a single intravenous dose of 0.25 mg/kg emicizumab in healthy subjects, the volume of 
distribution at steady state was 106 mL/kg (i.e. 7.4 L for a 70 kg adult).  
The apparent volume of distribution (V/F), estimated from the population PK analysis, in 
haemophilia A patients following multiple subcutaneous doses of emicizumab was 11.4 L.

Metabolism 
Antibodies are thought to be internalised in endothelial cells bound to the neonatal Fc receptor and 
rescued from metabolism by recycling. They are degraded in the reticulo-endothelial system to 
small peptides and amino acids, which are then used by the body for protein de-novo synthesis 
(Tabrizi et al. 2006; Roskos et al. 2004). 
Emicizumab is an IgG antibody and as such is likely to broken down by proteolytic enzymes to 
amino acid and peptides which either excreted by kidney or re-used in protein synthesis; in line 
with this the elimination half-life of emicizumab is 4 to 5 weeks. The pharmacokinetics of 
emicizumab do not suggest a mechanism of target-mediated drug disposition. 
Elimination 
Following intravenous administration of 0.25 mg/kg in healthy subjects, the total clearance of 
emicizumab was 3.26 mL/kg/day (i.e. 0.228 L/d for a 70 kg adult) and the mean terminal half-life 
was 26.7 days. 
Following single subcutaneous injection in healthy subjects, the elimination half-life was 
approximately 4 to 5 weeks. 
Following multiple subcutaneous injections in haemophilia A patients, the apparent clearance was 
0.244 L/day and the elimination apparent half-life was 27.8 days. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In study ACE001JP, in patients with a dosing interval of 7 days, the accumulation index (mean ± 
SD) was estimated to be 5.53 ± 0.716 (n=3). Moreover, the PK properties of emicizumab do not 
suggest target-mediated drug disposition in agreement with emicizumab’s low affinity for FIX and 
FX. 
Figure 7: Mean time course of plasma Hemlibra concentration following multiple 
subcutaneous administration (Japanese patients with haemophilia A) 
Power model analysis indicated that the Cmax and AUCinf of emicizumab was dose proportional 
over the range 0.01 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg in healthy subjects and was dose-proportional for steady-
state trough concentrations increased in proportion to the doses of 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg/week in the 
multiple ascending dose study in patients. 
Population PK model 
Two population PK models were used to describe the disposition of emicizumab. The applicant has 
used appropriate software and methods for the population PK analyses and for the non-
compartmental analyses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 43/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The final population PK model was a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and 
elimination processes. There was moderate variability were estimated for apparent clearance 
(CL/F) (25.0%) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) (29.1%), there was relatively high 
variability for the absorption rate constant (KA) (65.1%). The goodness-of-fit plots and VPCs were 
fit for purpose. 
The applicant initially used a body weight exponent of 0.891 on CL/F rather than the standard 
0.75. This reflects the known variability therapeutic proteins especially ones targeting coagulation 
pathways (Mahmood, 2009, Haemophilia, 15: 1109–1117). The population PK model showed that 
albumin was a significant covariate on CL/F and V/F. With albumin value slightly below the LLN 
(e.g. 30 g/L), emicizumab trough concentration is predicted to remain above 40 µg/mL. With 
albumin value almost 3 times lower than the LLN (e.g. 10 g/L), predicted emicizumab trough 
concentration is predicted to remain above 30 µg/mL. 
Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal function 
No dedicated studies of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab have 
been conducted.  
The safety and efficacy of emicizumab have not been specifically tested in patients with renal 
impairment. There are limited data available on the use of Hemlibra in patients with mild renal 
impairment. No data are available on the use of Hemlibra in patients with moderate to severe renal 
impairment. Mild renal impairment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab. 
Emicizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is cleared via catabolism rather than renal excretion and 
a change in dose is not expected to be required for patients with renal impairment. 
 • 
Impaired hepatic function 
Given the metabolic pathway of antibodies, no dedicated studies on the effect of hepatic 
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab have been conducted. Rather than being 
cleared by hepatic metabolism, antibodies are thought to be internalised in endothelial cells bound 
to the neonatal Fc receptor and rescued from metabolism by recycling. They are degraded in the 
reticulo-endothelial system to small peptides and amino acids, which are then used by the body for 
protein de-novo synthesis (Tabrizi et al. 2006; Roskos et al. 2004). 
Furthermore, the PK profile of emicizumab does not suggest target-mediated disposition and, thus, 
reduced hepatic production of factor IX (FIX) and FX, which are the binding targets of emicizumab, 
should not affect the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab. However, a possible PD effect of reduced 
concentrations of FIX and FX cannot be excluded, in particular, given the fact that patients with 
haemophilia have a higher risk of developing liver impairment as a consequence of transfusion-
acquired infections.  
Most of the patients with haemophilia A in the population pharmacokinetic analysis had normal 
hepatic function (bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN, n=113) or mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and 
AST > ULN or bilirubin < 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST, n=17). Mild hepatic impairment did not 
affect the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab. The safety and efficacy of emicizumab have not been 
specifically tested in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment were included in clinical trials. No data are available on the use of Hemlibra in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment.  
Emicizumab is a monoclonal antibody and cleared via catabolism rather than hepatic metabolism 
and a change in dose is not expected to be required for patients with hepatic impairment.

Gender 
• 
No gender effect was investigated in the population PK model as all patients included in Study 
BH29884, Study BH29992 and Study ACE001JP / ACE002JP were male. 
• 
Race 
V/F was substantially affected in Black or African American patients, the maximum change in V/F 
being estimated to be -36% compared with white/Asian patients. Despite a change in the shape of 
the concentration-time profile at steady state, no obvious difference in PK concentrations was 
predicted between Black and white/Asian patients (Population PK and PK/PD Report). 
The effect of Black status on apparent volume of distribution only barely modifies the shape of the 
PK profile at steady state. A reduction of only 2.08% of the Css,trough and an augmentation of 
only 1.11% of the Css,max is predicted for a Black patient compared to a White or Asian one 
(assuming typical 22-year patients of 70 kg with 45 g/L of albumin). Furthermore, no obvious 
difference in PK between Japanese and Caucasian healthy subjects was observed in Study 
ACE001JP Parts A and B. Across all clinical studies in patients with haemophilia A (Studies 
ACE001JP Part C/ACE002JP, BH29884, and BH29992), the majority of patients included in the 
popPK analysis were white (n = 76, 54%), followed by Asian (n = 43, 30.5%), Black or African 
American (n = 12, 8.5%), and others (n = 10, 7.1%). No obvious difference was observed in the 
PK across these patient populations. 
• 
Weight 
As anticipated, strong relationships between body weight and CL/F as well as body weight and V/F 
were estimated, modifying up to about ± 80% those parameters for extreme body weights.  
Negligible body weight impact on the level of PK concentration at steady state is predicted, as is 
expected with a weight-based dosing. 
• 
Elderly 
About 2% of patients with haemophilia A and B surveyed in U.S. comprehensive haemophilia 
treatment centres were 65 years of age or older (Philipp 2010). Due to the extremely limited 
population of elderly patients with haemophilia, the applicant did not perform a dedicated study to 
investigate the pharmacokinetics in elderly patients. Instead, participation to blood sampling for PK 
assessments was mandatory in the Phase III Study BH29884 (enrolling patients from > 12 years of 
age), and the influence of age on emicizumab pharmacokinetics was investigated via population PK 
analysis. 
Older patients ( > 22 years) had increased CL/F with age and consequently decreased steady state 
exposure. This, for instance, leads to a predicted exposure (AUCSS,1week) at steady state 25.8% 
lower in a 75-year old patient compared to a 22-year old patient (assuming typical values for body 
weight (70 kg), albumin (45 g/L) and White status). Although this age effect was not precisely 
estimated (RSE = 37.2%) and is unusual for antibodies (Tabrizi et al. 2006), it was kept in the 
model as the estimated probability from posterior distribution showed a 91% risk of clinical 
importance of this covariate for a typical 75-year patient. 
Individual PK profiles observed in Studies BH29884 and BH29992 support the tendency of lower 
concentrations with age (Population PK and PK/PD Report). However, a consistent and meaningful 
reduction of ABR in patients < 65 and ≥ 65 years old was observed, indicating that no dose 
adjustment is required in elderly patients.

Indeed, in the exposure-efficacy database (from Phase III Study BH29884), among the 3 patients 
above 65 years old 2 of them (75- and 67-years old) were fully controlled (ABRT = 0) and the 
other one, 68- years old, were well controlled with an ABRT of 1.48.

None 
To date PK data is available for 60 patients with haemophilia < 18 years of age. This includes 10 
patients of 2 years and below and 5 that are 1- 2 years old, for whom PK profiles are available for 
4 patients. Ongoing studies are investigating patients with haemophilia birth to <12 years of age 
and patients 12-17 years with body weight <40 kg. 
A PBPK model was also developed in SIMCYP to investigate the effects of IgG levels in younger 
children. 
An update to the PopPK model was provided focussing on subjects below one year of age. This 
included the larger database of patients (a total of 189 vs. initially 141 patients), including 9 
patients between 1 and 2 years of age who were dosed with emicizumab. This new model included 
body weight (exponent 0.75) and a maturation effect on clearance and an effect of changing 
albumin concentration on the apparent clearance. 
The popPK model was agreed to be a better fit to the data with regard to simulation of steady state 
exposure in patients less than 1 year of age; noting that the one individual patient closest to 1 year 
of age appeared to have a small underprediction of clearance. The initial model used did not take 
into account potential variation of albumin with age. In the new model, the variation in albumin 
concentration with age, and in particular in patients <1 year, was taken into account, and with or 
without a maturation function.  Simulations predicted slightly lower exposures than previous ones 
performed with a constant value of 45 g/L of albumin and slightly higher exposures are predicted 
when the maturation of clearance with age is taken into account. Exposure in neonates is predicted 
to be 23% (with maturation; AUCSS of ~250 µg*day/mL) and 27% (without maturation; AUCSS of 
~240 µg*day/mL) lower than that observed for of older patients (1–12 years).

patients included in the covariate population PK model building) indicating that no dose adjustment 
by age is required in adolescents ( ≥ 12 years of age to < 18 years of age) and children ( < 12 
years of age) patients with haemophilia A. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
• 
In vivo 
Drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted as PK drug-drug interactions are not expected 
given that the metabolic pathways (monoclonal antibodies are neither metabolised via the 
cytochrome P450 system nor is there conjugation with glucuronic acid, esterases, etc.) and 
elimination pathways of small molecules do not overlap with metabolism or elimination of 
antibodies. Moreover, antibodies are not bound to drug transporters such as p-glycoprotein, breast 
cancer resistance protein, organic cation transporters, or organic anion transporter. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Not applicable. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Emicizumab is a recombinant, humanised, bispecific, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal 
antibody that binds with moderate affinity in the low µM range to the human FIX (hFIX), human FX 
(hFX), human FIXa (hFIXa), and human activated FX (hFXa) in a concentration-dependent manner. 
Upon binding, emicizumab enhances the activation of hFX by hFIXa, thereby restoring haemostatic 
function. Emicizumab thus activates downstream haemostasis at the site of bleeding in haemophilia

Thrombin Generation 
After the start of emicizumab administration, peak height of TG increased in all dose groups with a 
slight dose dependency. The mean (±SD) TG peak height at steady state was 261.09 ±78.28 at 12 
weeks’ post-dose, 273.98 ±29.39 at 12 weeks’ post-dose, and 284.96 ±53.27 nmol/L at 24 weeks’ 
post-dose in the 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/week dose groups, respectively. 
The maximal effect of ACE910 on thrombin generation was achieved at approximately ≥30 µg/mL 
for Peak height and over the entire detected concentrations of approximately ≥1 µg/mL for ETP. 
FVIII activity measured in pivotal studies BH29984 and BH29992  
FVIII activity was measured with a chromogenic assay (Biophen FVIII:C – for further details see 
Methods Section 2.1.2 above) containing human FIXa and FX proteins. Reported FVIII activity 
values provided by this assay should not be viewed as equivalent to FVIII activity data obtained in 
patients treated with FVIII because the biochemical (enzymatic) properties of emicizumab and 
FVIII are not identical. Nevertheless, FVIII activity provides a relative indication of the 
procoagulant activity of emicizumab and thus serves as a PD marker.  
Study BH29984  
The slight decline over time for Arms A and C from Week 5 to Week 25+, and the lower mean 
values for Arm B after switch to emicizumab, are both thought to be the result of the same 
laboratory artefact. All Arm B emicizumab samples were collected and analysed after June 2016, as 
were the later visit samples for Arms A and C; whereas early time points for Arms A and C patients 
were generally collected and analysed prior to that date. Thus, the declining %FVIII values over 
time and the apparent difference between arms are thought by the Applicant to be likely due to 
signal drift in the central lab assay over time.

Study BH29992 
Following treatment with emicizumab, increases in reported FVIII activity were observed for all 
patients recruited so far, reaching levels between 19 and 33 U/dL at Week 5 and sustained at 
approximately this level during the study period.

Secondary pharmacology  
No dedicated, thorough QT study was conducted to evaluate the effect of emicizumab on ECG 
parameters (QTc). But intensive ECG assessments were performed, and the relationship between 
emicizumab PK and 12-Lead ECG (QTcF) was investigated in patients with haemophilia A in Studies 
ACE001JP Part C and ACE002JP. In part C of study ACE001JP, there were no obvious plasma 
ACE910 concentration-dependent prolongation of ΔQTcB and ΔQTcF within the concentration range 
up to 115 μg/mL in haemophilia A patients. The point estimates [95% CI] of the regression 
coefficient on plasma ACE910 concentration for ΔQTcB and ΔQTcF were −0.115 [−0.266 to 0.036] 
and −0.066 [−0.172 to 0.041], respectively. The same holds true for long term exposure based on 
results from the extension study ACE002JP, also showing no obvious plasma emicizumab 
concentration-dependent prolongation of ∆QTcF (Absolute change in QTcF interval from baseline; 
i.e., pre-treatment time-matched baseline) within the tested concentration range up to 144 µg/mL 
was observed.

Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
In conjunction with non-clinical results, an increased thrombotic effect of bypassing agents used in 
combination with emicizumab is hypothesised, with the effect being more pronounced in 
combination with aPCC. This is based on 2 confirmed cases of thromboembolic events (TE) and 2 
cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), all observed in Study BH29884. 
Bypassing agents (rFVIIa and aPCC) may be administered to emicizumab-treated patients with 
haemophilia A as episodic treatments for bleeds. The possibility of a PD interaction 
(hypercoagulability/thrombosis) between emicizumab and aPCC is likely and one between 
emicizumab and rFVIIa cannot be ruled out. This is further discussed in Section 3.3.8 Clinical 
Safety.  
Relationships between plasma concentration and effect 
The Repeated Time-to-Event Model developed from the phase 2 data demonstrated that bleeding 
frequency was reduced in a plasma emicizumab concentration-dependent manner and that 
cumulative bleeding events are reduced significantly when plasma emicizumab concentrations are 
> 45 µg/mL. 
The applicant has provided a straightforward graphical analysis for exposure-efficacy, -
pharmacodynamic and -safety endpoints. The dose regimen of 3 mg/kg/week SC for 4 weeks 
followed by 1.5 mg/kg/week SC results in a ABRT reduction that is near maximal at all exposure. 
Following 24 weeks of exposure, patients with 0 ABRTs had a median Cav of 55.8 ug/mL vs 47.7 
and 41.9 µg/mL for patients with 1-10 and >10 ABRTs, respectively. aPTT was normalised (<40 
seconds) at a plasma emicizumab concentration ≥ 5 ug/mL; peak height for thrombin generation 
and Factor VIII activity increased with increasing emicizumab concentration and this was not 
influenced by Factor XI or Factor X exposure.  
There was no apparent relationship between plasma emicizumab concentration and occurrence of 
injection site reactions, thromboembolic events, or thrombotic microangiopathy. However, this may 
be due to low number of patients and/or events. 
Analytical Methods  
Drug concentration in plasma 
A validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., 
Ltd. and validated at Chugai, SRL, Inc., and QPS Netherlands B.V. was used to measure 
emicizumab concentrations in plasma. 
Immunogenicity 
A panel of assays was used to detect, confirm, and characterise the antibody responses to 
emicizumab, as follows: screening electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECL) or ELISA to 
detect emicizumab antibodies in samples; followed by confirmatory assays (ECL or ELISA) to 
assess the specificity of the screenpositive results by competition with excess of emicizumab. 
Titration assays (ECL or ELISA) were used to determine the antibody titres for confirmed positive 
samples. A neutralising antibody assay and immunoglobulin E (IgE) assay was developed to 
characterize the confirmed antibodies to emicizumab (only in clinical studies ACE001JP, ACE002JP, 
and JP29574). 
The assay for the detection of anti-emicizumab IgE antibodies in human plasma was based on the 
principles of fluorescent-enzyme immunoassay (FEIA), and the anti-emicizumab IgE antibodies 
were detected by measuring the reaction’s fluorescence intensity.

Biomarker assays 
Factor VIII activity was measured using a validated CE-marked chromogenic assay containing 
human FIXa and FX (Hyphen Biomed, Neuville-sur-Oise, France). A Bethesda assay method was 
used to detect FVIII inhibitors in patients in Study ACE002JP.  FVIII inhibitor titre was measured in 
BH29884 and BH29992 using the Chromogenic Bethesda Assay (CBA) procedure published by the 
U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). FIX was measured using a validated ELISA based on an 
AssayMax Human FIX ELISA Kit (Assaypro, Catalog No. EF1009-1). Factor X was measured using a 
validated ELISA based on an assay kit AssayMax Human X (FX) ELISA Kit (Assaypro, Catalog No. 
EF1010-1). Thrombin Generation (TG) was measured with a research-grade assay validated as fit-
for-purpose. A Calibrated Automated Thrombogram method (Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres sur 
Seine, France) was modified by using a triggering reagent containing FXIa rather than tissue 
factor. 
The Applicant also highlights the issue of interference of emicizumab with laboratory assays, such 
as aPTT, the one-stage (clotting) FVIII activity assay utilizing aPTT reagents, and the Bethesda or 
Nijmegen Bethesda assays for measuring FVIII inhibitor titre, those frequently used in 
management of patients with Haemophilia A. In these tests, and in all tests based on aPTT, 
emicizumab interferes with the test results, such that they do not accurately reflect the patient’s 
underlying haemostatic potential.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of emicizumab have been described in healthy subjects and male patients 
with haemophilia A. There is limited, yet reassuring data in patients less than 2 years of age and 
no data in those less than 1. An extrapolation approach was required to support dosing in those 
less than 1 years of age. Modelling and simulations have been performed utilising the updated 
PopPK model which includes a maturation factor and the effects of changing albumin 
concentrations. A PBPK model was also developed which investigated the impact of changing IgG 
levels. It is agreed with the applicant that quantitative knowledge about age related processes is 
not well established and recognised that only the competition with varying levels of endogenous 
IgG levels is implemented in the PBPK model therefore this limits its usefulness. However, taken as 
a whole, the different models provide a range of clearance predictions in those less than 1 year. 
Typically an increase in clearance may be expected of up to 2 fold in neonates (PBPK model 
prediction). For the POPPK model, exposure in neonates is predicted to be 23% (with maturation; 
AUCSS of ~250 µg*day/mL) and 27% (without maturation; AUCSS of ~240 µg*day/mL) lower than 
that observed for of older patients (1–12 years). 
There is limited data in this age range with other similar molecules which could support the 
extrapolation, the exception being pavlizumab, which has a significant amount of data (this data 
being the source of the maturation function) and infliximab which has some data in 6 patients less 
than 1 year of age (these showed similar exposure to older subjects when dosed on a weight based 
basis). The data shows similar relationships with age for the different drugs and therefore it is 
agreed that the popPK model, including the effect of body weight and albumin on the apparent 
clearance with a maturation function appears to be the most appropriate approach to extrapolate 
exposure for patients aged less than 1 year. 
The results of these considerations suggest that the risk, if any, in this patient population will be 
slight under-exposure, however given the exposure-response analysis, this is unlikely to result in 
lack of efficacy. 
Emicizumab induces a dose-dependent shortening of aPTT, with normalisation of aPTT occurring at 
low concentrations, at approximately ≥ 5µg/mL. It furthermore induces a dose-dependent 
promotion of Thrombin Generation, which is maintained over time, indicative of a ‘pro-thrombotic 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 53/126 
 
 
 
 
state’ the coagulation system maintains while on emicizumab prophylaxis. No obvious changes in 
plasma FIX and FX concentrations have been observed. Reported FVIII activity levels, although not 
equivalent to FVIII activity data obtained in patients treated with FVIII, provide a relative indication 
of the procoagulant activity of emicizumab, thus serving as a PD marker, showing an increase, 
which plateaus after the 4-week period of loading doses. However, a slight decline can be observed 
over time likely due to quality control issues of the assay and not due to clinical or biological 
factors related to emicizumab PK, PD, or immunogenicity. Even if this would not be the only root 
cause, the consistency of clinical efficacy results observed are supportive of sustained clinical effect 
beyond the date the assay kit lot changed. 
The proposed posology of 3 mg/kg/week s.c. for 4 weeks followed by 1.5 mg/kg/week s.c. is based 
on graphical analysis for exposure-efficacy, -pharmacodynamic and -safety endpoints, showing that 
this dose regimen results in a ABRT reduction that is near maximal at all exposure. No apparent 
relationship between plasma concentration and occurrence of ADRs (i.e. injection site reactions, 
thromboembolic events, or thrombotic microangiopathy) can be observed.  
Drug-drug interaction with concomitant use of bypassing agents (i.e. aPCC, rFVIIa) has been 
identified and thoroughly investigated. This is discussed in more detail in the Section 2.6. Clinical 
Safety. Other secondary pharmacology, i.e. such as ECG assessment indicated no drug-related 
changes.  
The validated assays used are generally considered adequate. In earlier clinical studies 
(ACE001JP/ACE002JP and JP29574), a tiered approach was used for analysis of anti emicizumab 
antibodies. All samples were analysed using an ECL screening assay, and positive samples were 
further analysed in a confirmatory assay by competition with excess of emicizumab. Finally, 
samples were titrated using the ECL assay. In the pivotal studies, a second-generation ELISA was 
used, which contained an overnight incubation step, allowing detection of free and initially 
complexed ADAs. With regards to drug tolerance, the applicant confirmed that that ADA can be 
detected when levels are ~ 40 micrograms/ml (trough concentrations with a maintenance dose of 
1.5mg/kg/week), yet the applicant indicates a potential concentration-dependent interference of 
emicizumab with ADA detection. This conflicting information is noted. Nevertheless, development of 
clinically relevant ADA will likely affect efficacy and hence be recorded by clinicians by means of 
continuous monitoring of their patients. A statement has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC 
to prompt physicians to consider a change of treatment in case of clinical signs of loss of efficacy.  
The neutralising AB assay, in presence of anti-drug antibodies, measures a prolongation of aPTT 
time, with output of clotting time in seconds, meant as a qualitative assay, not intended for 
commercial use, with no inter-assay variability applying.  
About the biomarker assays, although only used as exploratory endpoints, the applicant clarified 
that identical volumes in test and calibrator wells were used. 
The applicant acknowledged the limitations of the biological tests used in patients with Haemophilia 
A including inhibitor measurement in the presence of emicizumab and has developed strategies to 
overcome this, by using the chromogenic assay with the bovine reagent. The inclusion of warnings 
and educational material for healthcare professionals and caregivers as part of the RMP has 
addressed this risk. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PK and PD parameters have been characterised. The lack of data in patients aged 0-1 years of age 
has been reassuringly addressed through modelling and simulation. Limitations and concerns 
around the clinical use of emicizumab, particularly with regards to the concomitant use of 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018

bypassing agents as well as interference with standard lab tests have been identified. Appropriate 
measures have been implemented to address these concerns (see Section 2.6 below).  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Clinical efficacy data to support this current application in patients with FVIII inhibitors are derived 
primarily from the adult and adolescent pivotal Phase III Study BH29884 in patients ≥12 years of 
age.  
Interim results from the ongoing paediatric pivotal Phase III Study BH29992 in children <12 years 
of age further support this application and an initial indication that encompasses all age groups.  
Supporting data are also provided from the ongoing Phase I/II extension Study ACE002JP, which 
provides long-term efficacy data of emicizumab prophylaxis following more than 2 years of 
treatment. 
Overall this submission includes efficacy data from 104 adult and adolescent patients (Study 
BH29884), 19 children aged <12 years and 1 aged 12 years old and less than 40kg (Study 
BH29992), as well as 18 adult and adolescent Japanese patients (ACE002JP, extension study of 
Part C of study ACE001JP). 
In addition, the Phase III clinical program also includes a non-interventional study (NIS BH29768). 
NIS BH29768 prospectively collected bleed and haemophilia medication data and provided eligible 
patients the opportunity to enrol in the Phase III Studies BH29884 and BH29992. 
• 
Dose-response study ACE001JP 
This was a three-part trial conducted between 17th of August 2012 to 17th of April 2015; Part A 
and B being a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, inter-individual, subcutaneous single 
ascending dose study in healthy Japanese adult male volunteers conducted at one site in Japan. 
Part C was designed as an open-label, inter-individual, subcutaneous multiple-ascending dose 
study in Japanese patients with haemophilia A, conducted at 6 sites in Japan. 
Study participants 
All 64 HV enrolled in Part A and B were dosed, hence no subjects were excluded from safety, 
pharmacokinetic, or pharmacodynamic analyses. One HV in the placebo group and 1 in the 0.3 
mg/kg group in Part B withdrawn for failure to cooperate.  
For Part C a total of 18 haemophilia A patients were enrolled and dosed in three groups of 6 
patients with only one patient in the 1 mg/kg/week group discontinued study administration due to 
an adverse event (AE).  
One patient each in the 0.3 mg/kg/week group and the 3 mg/kg/week group in Part C transitioned 
to the observation period, and 5 patients in the 0.3 mg/kg/week group, 5 patients in the 1 
mg/kg/week group and 5 patients in the 3 mg/kg/week group transitioned to the ACE002JP study 
and continued ACE910 administration with no interruptions. One patient in the 0.3 mg/kg/week 
group transitioned to the ACE002JP study after completing the observation period.  
Study conduct & deviations

The applicant amended 6 times the protocol. The amendments are not considered to have any 
impact on the study outcomes.  
Most of the protocol deviations (13) are due to inadequate primary endpoint investigations, mainly 
deviations from the protocol set timepoints for investigations, or missing data. 
For more detailed pharmacokinetic results from Study ACE001JP see above. The extension study of 
part C, ACE002JP will be discussed under Section Supportive studies in the below. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study BH29884: open label, multicentre, global, randomized study, with 
two additional, separate therapeutic arms    
Methods 
This is a randomised, multicentre, open label, Phase III clinical study enrolling patients aged 12 
years or older with haemophilia A who have inhibitors against FVIII,  
Figure 15: Overview of study design – study BH29884 
Study Participants  
Key inclusion criteria were diagnosis of congenital haemophilia A in patients age 12 and above of 
any severity and documented history of high-titre inhibitor (i.e. ≥5 BU); documentation of 
treatment with episodic or prophylactic bypassing agents for at least the last 24 weeks; ≥ 6 bleeds 
in the last 24 weeks prior to screening (if on an episodic bypassing agent regimen) or ≥2 bleeds in 
the last 24 weeks prior to screening (if on a prophylactic bypassing agent regimen). 
Key exclusion criteria were ongoing (or plan to receive during the study) immune tolerance 
induction therapy or prophylaxis with FVIII except for patients who had received a treatment 
regimen of FVIII prophylaxis with concurrent bypassing agent prophylaxis, as well as planned 
surgery (excluding minor procedures such as tooth extraction or incision and drainage) during the 
study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 56/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The exclusion criteria were amended (amendment 2) to exclude patients who are at high risk of 
thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) as part of the safety changes.  
Treatments 
The study evaluates prophylactic treatment with emicizumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg/week SC for 4 
weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg/week SC thereafter. Emicizumab was administered as a SC injection 
in the lower abdomen, upper arm, or thigh at patient’s discretion.  
Dose-up titration was allowed after at least 24 weeks on emicizumab prophylaxis. Patients could 
increase their dose from 1.5 mg/kg QW to 3 mg/kg QW, if they met certain criteria (two 
spontaneous and clinically significant bleeds after loading dose period of which one verified by 
physician) and received approval from the Medical Monitor.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic emicizumab 
compared with no prophylaxis in patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors (Arms A and B) after 
24 weeks of emicizumab treatment. 
The secondary objectives for this study was to compare prophylactic emicizumab treatment with no 
prophylaxis (Arms A and B) and to compare the bleed rate of prophylactic emicizumab treatment 
with bleed rate prior to study entry (intra-patient comparison; Arms A and C).  
The exploratory objective for this study was to evaluate the impact of prophylactic emicizumab 
compared with no prophylaxis on school/work attendance and hospitalisation.  
The PK objective for this study was to characterise the exposure (Ctrough) of emicizumab prior to 
drug administration on Day 1 at the following time points while on emicizumab: Every week during 
Weeks 1-4; Every 2 weeks during Weeks 5-8; Every 4 weeks during Weeks 9-24; Every 8 weeks 
during Weeks 25-48; Every 12 weeks thereafter, until the end of the study. 
The exploratory biomarker objectives were to assess potential pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers 
of emicizumab.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint was number of bleeds over time (i.e., bleed rate), defined as a bleed for which 
coagulation factors are administered. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were not included in the 
primary analysis. 
For the purposes of the efficacy analyses, a standardised definition of bleed, adapted from standard 
criteria defined by the Subcommittee on Standards and Criteria, FVIII/FIX subcommittee of the 
International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis was used (Blanchette et al. 2014). 
Secondary endpoints were number of all bleeds (i.e., those treated and not treated with 
coagulation factors) over time (added in Amendment 1); number of spontaneous bleeds over time 
(added in Amendment 2); number of joint bleeds over time; number of target joint bleeds over 
time (defined as a major joint e.g., hip, elbow, wrist, shoulder, knee, and ankle into which 
repeated bleeds occur (frequency of ≥ 3 bleeds into the same joint over the last 24 weeks prior to 
study entry); HRQoL of patients according to Haem-A-QoL (aged ≥18) or Haemo-QoL-Short Form 
(ages 12-17) scores at 24 weeks; health status of patients according to EuroQoL Five-Dimension-
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 57/126 
 
 
 
 
Five Levels Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) scores at 24 weeks; number of bleeds over time compared 
with the patient’s historical bleed rate (both for treated bleeds and all bleeds).  
Exploratory endpoints were differences in number of days away from school/work and differences 
in number of days hospitalised. 
Assessments 
Data on bleeds and medications were collected using an electronic, handheld device using a BMQ 
developed and validated by the applicant as a patient-reported measure of bleeding episodes 
(including cause, type, location, day and start time of bleed, and symptoms) and haemophilia-
related medication use, completed at least weekly. 
Sample size 
The total sample size for this study was based on both clinical rather than statistical considerations, 
considering the limited number of patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors available for 
participation in clinical studies and to collect sufficient data to assess the safety and efficacy of 
emicizumab. A sample size calculation was conducted to assess the adequacy of the randomised 
comparison. 
Sample size calculations were performed for a range of values of λt and λc. A sample size of 45 
patients, assuming a randomisation ratio of 2:1 (30 patients in Arm A and 15 patients in Arm 
Bcontrol), would achieve a power of more than 95% for λt and λc ranging from 1 to 4 and 18 to 
30, respectively assuming patients were followed for 24 weeks. 
The primary analysis included all randomised patients, regardless of their length of follow-up. 
Randomisation 
Patients who took episodic treatment with bypassing agents prior to study entry were randomised 
in a 2:1 ratio to receive either emicizumab prophylaxis (Arm A) or to receive no prophylaxis (Arm B 
control). 
A central randomisation procedure was used for all patients who fulfilled the entry criteria at 
screening, with block-based randomisation stratified by the number of bleeds in the last 24 weeks 
(< 9 or ≥ 9). The stratification cut-point was chosen to approximate an ABR of 18, which was 
estimated to be approximately halfway between the minimum ABR to be eligible for this study and 
median ABR for inhibitor patients receiving episodic bypassing agents. 
A total of 114 patients were screened prior to enrolment into this study, with 109 eligible patients 
enrolled. The countries from which the most patients were enrolled were the United States 
(33.0%), followed by Japan (11.0%) and Poland (8.3%).  
Among the 109 patients, 66 patients (60.6%) had previously participated in NIS BH29768 (24 
randomised to Arm A; 11 to Arm B; 24 eligible for Arm C; 7 for Arm D).  
Three patients were withdrawn from emicizumab treatment, all in Arm A (2 patients due to an AE – 
see also Section 3.3.8 Clinical safety below - and 1 patient per physician decision; one patient 
randomised to Arm A withdrew prior to Study Day 1; patient decision to not participate).

Statistical methods 
Formal hypothesis testing was conducted only for the randomised comparison of Arm A versus Arm 
Bcontrol, and for the intra-patient comparisons in Arms A and C. The comparison of the number of 
bleeds over time between the randomised treatment arms was performed using a negative 
binomial (NB) regression model, which accounted for different follow-up times, with the patient’s 
number of bleeds as a function of randomisation and the time that each patient stays in the study 
included as an offset in the model. The model also included the number of bleeds (< 9 or ≥ 9) in 
the last 24 weeks prior to study entry as a stratification factor in the randomisation. This analytic 
model estimated the rate ratio, lambda t/ lambda c., which quantified the risk of bleeding 
associated with emicizumab prophylaxis (lambda t) in comparison to no prophylaxis (lambda c). 
Statistical significance was controlled at the 2-sided, 0.05 alpha level, and the estimated risk ratio 
was compared with 1, assuming the following statistical hypothesis: 
•  H0 (null hypothesis): rate ratio=1 
versus 
•  H1 (alternative hypothesis): rate ratio ≠ 1. 
Statistical significance was controlled at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 based on a Wald testing 
procedure. Bleed rates for emicizumab prophylaxis and for no prophylaxis, together with the rate 
ratio including 95% confidence intervals, were described. 
The number of bleeds was also annualised for each patient using the following formula: 
•  ABR= (number of bleeds/number of days during the efficacy period) x 365.25. 
Both NB regression model-based and calculated ABR results are presented. 
It was pre-specified in the SAP that the non-parametric Van Elteren test of ABR was to be provided 
as a sensitivity analysis. If convergence of the NB regression model was not achieved or was 
questionable, the primary efficacy analysis would then be based on the Van Elteren test of ABR. 
The start of the efficacy period for each individual patient was defined as the first day there were 
data available from the BMQ. For patients who started the study on emicizumab (Arms A, C, and 
D), this coincided with the Week 1 visit and the day of the first emicizumab dose, and for the 
patients who did not start the study on emicizumab (i.e., Arm Bcontrol), this coincided with the Week 
1 visit. The second efficacy period for patients in Arm B started when they switched to receive 
emicizumab prophylaxis (i.e., Arm Bemi), on the day of their first emicizumab dose. 
For patients in Arms A, C or D the end of the efficacy period was defined as the date of the CCOD 
or the date of withdrawal from the initial study period (i.e., treatment phase according to eCRF), 
whichever was earlier. 
For patients randomised to Arm Bcontrol (no prophylaxis), the end of the first efficacy period was 
defined as either the day before the first emicizumab dose was administered (for patients who 
switched to receive emicizumab after 24 weeks) or the date of withdrawal from the initial study 
period. The second efficacy period ended on the date of the CCOD or the date of withdrawal from 
emicizumab treatment. 
For the intra-patient comparisons the efficacy period in NIS BH29768 comprised total time in NIS 
BH29768 prior to enrolment in Study BH29884, and the efficacy period during the participation in 
Study BH29884 was calculated as above for the efficacy periods in Arms A and C. 
For patients whose dose was up-titrated, the efficacy period ended the day before the first day on 
the up-titrated dose. The bleeds on the up-titrated dose were analysed separately. The efficacy

period on a given up-titrated dose started with the first day on this dose and ended on the day of 
the CCOD or withdrawal. 
For a patient who withdrew from the study before reaching the Week 1 visit, the duration of the 
efficacy period was set to 1 day, starting and ending on the day of randomisation/enrolment. 
A bleed was considered to be a “treated bleed” if it was directly followed (i.e., there was not an 
intervening bleed) by a haemophilia medication reported to be a “treatment for bleed,” irrespective 
of the time between the treatment and the preceding bleed. A bleed and the first treatment 
thereafter were considered to be pairs (i.e., one treatment belonged to one bleed only), with the 
following exception: if multiple bleeds occurred on the same calendar day, the subsequent 
treatment was considered to apply for each of these multiple bleeds (which were, however, 
counted as separate bleeds). Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were not included in the primary 
analysis. Only treatments that were recorded as “treatment for bleed” were included in the 
determination of a treated bleed. 
As per the adapted ISTH definition, two bleeds of the same type (e.g., “joint,” “muscle,” or “other”) 
and at the same anatomical location were considered to be one bleed if the second occurred within 
72 hours (72-hour rule) from the last treatment for the first bleed. The last treatment was defined 
as the last treatment before a new bleed occurred, either in the same or in a different location. 
This was in line with the above definition that bleeds and treatments were considered to be pairs. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
For the intra-patient comparisons, only patients who participated in the NIS BH29768 were 
included as bleed and treatment data were collected with the same level of granularity in both time 
periods. Of note, for some patients who participated in NIS BH29768, the total time in that study 
prior to enrolment in Study BH29884 was less than 24 weeks 
The pre-specified endpoints on the Haemo-QoL-SF were not tested, due to an insufficient number 
of adolescent patients randomised to Arm A or B. All analyses of the Haemo-QoL-SF were 
descriptive only. 
Type I error for secondary endpoints was controlled through a hierarchical testing framework. The 
alpha level was 0.05. The hierarchy was designed both with clinical relevance as well as probability 
of success in mind. The endpoints were included in the following order: 
•  A versus B randomised comparison: all bleeds 
•  A intra-patient: all bleeds 
•  A intra-patient: treated bleeds 
•  A versus B randomised comparison: joint bleeds 
•  C intra-patient: all bleeds 
•  C intra-patient: treated bleeds 
•  A versus B randomised comparison: spontaneous bleeds 
•  A versus B randomised comparison: target joint bleeds 
•  A versus B randomised comparison: Haem-A-QoL physical health subscale at 24 weeks 
•  A versus B randomised comparison: Haem-A-QoL Total Score at 24 weeks 
•  A versus B randomised comparison: EQ-5D-5L VAS at 24 weeks 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 60/126 
 
 
 
 
 
•  A versus B randomised comparison: EQ-5D-5L Index Utility Score at 24 weeks 
The analysis methodology for all secondary endpoints was the same as for the primary endpoint, 
except for the EQ-5D-5L and Haem-A-QoL at 24 weeks, which used analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) with treatment group, baseline score, time and treatment by baseline interaction term 
as covariates. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
Pre-specified sensitivity analyses included different methods to define bleeds or eligible bleed data 
as well as alternative statistical tests to NB regression. 
Bleed definitions: 
•  Analysis including all bleeds recorded by patients in the electronic patient-reported 
outcomes device (i.e., without the 72-hour rule). 
•  Analysis including only patients who received at least 12 weeks of emicizumab treatment. 
•  Analysis based on counting days when treatment for bleeds was administered instead of 
the bleeds themselves. 
•  Analysis including only patients who had at least 12 weeks of follow-up in NIS BH29768 
(for the intra-patient comparison secondary endpoints only). 
•  Alternative tests: 
•  ANCOVA 
•  Van Elteren (non-parametric stratified test) 
•  Wilcoxon Rank Sum (non-parametric unstratified test) 
Subgroup analyses 
The primary endpoint was analysed by the following pre-defined subgroups: 
•  Age: < 18, ≥ 18 
•  Age: < 65, ≥ 65 
•  Race: Asian, Black or African American, White, Other 
•  Number of bleeds during 24 weeks prior to study entry: ≤ 9, >9 
•  Number of target joints: no target joint, any target joint 
In addition, estimated ABR including 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for all treatment 
arms for each of these subgroups. Due to the small sample size, all subgroup analyses are highly 
sensitive to variability caused by individual patients and should be interpreted with caution. No p-
values were calculated.

Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 16:  Patient disposition–study BH29884 
The total observation time for all patients in the study (calculated as the time from enrolment until 
the CCOD or premature withdrawal from the study, including any time in the Safety Follow-up 
period) is presented descriptively and by week ranges in the table below. 
The shorter observation time in Arms C and D is not surprising (completed 24 weeks of treatment 
Arm C: 44.9% [22 patients]; Arm D: 0), as recruitment was prioritised into Arm A and B triggering 
the primary analysis.  
Most patients in Arm B (13 patients [72.2%]) switched to receive emicizumab (Arm Bemi) after 
completion of the 24-week evaluation and the remaining patients (5 patients; 27.8%) did not 
switch. This was due to the temporary enrolment halt following the SAEs of TE and TMA.

Recruitment 
The study is conducted in 43 sites across 14 countries.  
The study was sponsored by the applicant (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd) and Chugai Pharmaceutical 
Co. Ltd. 
Study period 
First patient entered was 18th of November 2015.  
Last patient entered was 28th of September 2016.  
Last patient randomised was 11th of May 2016.  
Data cut-off/ LPLV was 25th of October 2016. 
Conduct of the study 
There were two amendments to the original protocol. Amendment 1 (21th of April 2016) 
introduced changes to the planned number of patients enrolled to Arm C and added Arm D. These 
are not considered to have impact on the outcome analyses. Amendment 2 (released on 30th of 
November 2016), after the data cut-off date, formalised the changes to administration of 
bypassing agents that were originally implemented via the DILs (from 7th and 17th of October 
2016) following 4 patients who experienced SAEs (2 patients with thromboembolic events and 2 
patients with thrombotic microangiopathy), considered to be related to the concomitant use of 
aPCC. Furthermore, a new efficacy objective to evaluate the clinical effect of emicizumab 
prophylaxis on the number of spontaneous bleeds over time (spontaneous bleed rate) was added. 
This was despite it being included as an endpoint in the SAP.  
Protocol deviations 
The total number of major protocol deviations were slightly lower in the control arm (ITT 
population: Arm B 16.7% vs 20% Arm A), due to the open label design. Procedural major protocol

deviations were equally balanced between the two groups (Arm A 14.3% vs Arm B 16.7%); two 
patients in the Arm A had medication deviations.  
The few cases of non-compliance, where the patients did not fill out a questionnaire via the BMQ, 
and the site supplemented the information via a site data entry system was balanced between 
treatment arms. Compliance of providing responses to the quality of life questionnaires was high 
with no apparent drop over time. The missing data are mostly due to individual patient’s low 
compliance across all time points.

Efficacy observation time for the intra-patient comparison (Arm A and C) based on the NIS 
BH29768 trial were 8 patients (33.3%) for ≥24 weeks for episodic bypassing agents of the NIS 
population and 22 patients (91.7%) for Arm A, 16 patients (66.6%) for prophylactic bypassing 
therapy of the NIS and 15 (62.5%) for patients on Arm C, both for the efficacy period ≥24 weeks.  
Two patients in Arm A had their dose up-titrated from 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/week. One patient after 
week 27 after physicians verified ≥ 2 spontaneous and clinically significant bleeds; one after week 
25 again due to verified ≥ 2 spontaneous and clinically significant non-limb-threatening joint 
bleeds. Preliminary results show improved efficacy. In the intra-patient analysis, Hemlibra 
prophylaxis resulted in statistically significant (p = 0.0003) and clinically meaningful reduction 
(79%) in bleed rate for treated bleeds compared with previous bypassing agent prophylaxis 
collected in the NIS prior to enrolment. See Tables below for overview of intra-patient comparisons 
in Arm A and C.

Health Status and Quality of Life  
In Study BH29884, health-related quality of life for patients aged ≥ 18 years was evaluated at 
Week 25 based on the Haemophilia-specific Quality of Life (Haem-A-QoL) questionnaire for adults. 
Baseline Total Scores (mean = 41.14 and 44.58, respectively) and Physical Health scale scores 
(mean = 52.41 and 57.19, respectively) were similar for Hemlibra prophylaxis and no prophylaxis. 
Table below provides a summary of the comparison between the Hemlibra prophylaxis arm (Arm A) 
and the no prophylaxis arm (Arm B) on the Haem-A-QoL Total Score and Physical Health scale 
after 24 weeks of treatment adjusting for baseline. Weekly Hemlibra prophylaxis showed a 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement compared with the no prophylaxis in 
the pre specified endpoints of Haem-A-QoL Total Score and Physical Health Scale score at the 
Week 25 assessment. All the secondary endpoints for the Haem A-QoL and EQ-5D-5L were met.

Ancillary analyses 
Exploratory endpoints (ITT population) showed that most treated bleeds reported during the study 
in both study arms occurred in joints (Arm B 70.9% and Arm A 80.8%; predominantly in elbows, 
knees, and ankles). Analysis of treated bleeds by cause of bleed indicates that over two-thirds of 
the treated bleeds in Arm B (68.6%) and almost half of the treated bleeds in Arm A (46.2%) were 
spontaneous, with the remaining bleeds resulting from trauma (Arm A 28 [53.8%] vs Arm B 69 
[31.4%]). The summary of all bleeds (without 72-hour rule) by cause of bleed during the 
randomised period indicates that 69.0% of all bleeds in Arm B and 38.2% of all bleeds in Arm A 
were spontaneous. Only a small number of bleeds in both treatment arms was due to a surgery or 
procedure (Arm B 5 bleeds [1.8%]; Arm A 7 bleeds [6.4%])

Study BH29992 paediatric phase III study 
This is an ongoing single-arm, multicentre, open-label, Phase III clinical study enrolling children 
with haemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors, recruiting patients younger than 12 years of age or 
between 12 -17 years who weigh <40 kg at the time of informed consent.

Study participant (BH29992 study) 
Key inclusion/ exclusion criteria were similar to study BH29884. It is patients with a diagnosis of 
congenital haemophilia A with a body weight of less than 40 kg, but at least 3 kg, of any severity 
and documented history of high-titre inhibitor (i.e., ≥ 5 BU) and required treatment with bypassing 
agents. Criteria for past history of bleeding was different to study BH29884. For patients > 2 years 
of age, if on an episodic bypassing agent regimen this is: ABR of ≥ 6 (e.g., 3 bleeds in the last 24 
weeks) or if on a prophylactic bypassing agent regimen, inadequately controlled (e.g., 2 bleeds 
since starting prophylaxis or 1 life-threatening bleed) or CVAD placement medically not feasible or 
deemed unsafe by investigator. For patients < 2 years determined by investigator to be in high 
unmet medical need. Adequate haematological, hepatic, and renal function.  
Regarding ITI, contrary to study BH29884, patients awaiting initiation of ITI and patients in whom 
ITI had failed are eligible with a 72-hour washout period prior to the first emicizumab 
administration. 
Treatment (BH29992 study) 
Treatment is similar to study BH29884, with emicizumab administered at a weekly loading dose of 
3.0 mg/kg SC for the first 4 weeks (Day 1 of each week) followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 
mg/kg/week SC (Day 1 of each week). 
Following an interim data review of all available data up to the clinical cut-off date of 28 October 
2016 (e.g., safety, efficacy, PK and PD), the independent data monitoring committee 
recommended that the selected maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg/week should be continued in all 
enrolled and new patients.  
Similar to study BH29884, individual patients were able to have their dose up-titrated if they 
experienced suboptimal bleeding control on emicizumab during the 52-week treatment period. This 
is on the basis of three predefined maintenance doses (1.5, 2.25, and 3.0 mg/kg/week). 
Objectives (BH29992 study) 
The objectives of the study were to investigate (with no formal hypothesis testing) the efficacy, 
safety, and PK of once weekly SC administration of emicizumab in paediatric patients with 
haemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors who were receiving treatment with bypassing agents; with the 
following efficacy endpoints: to evaluate the clinical effect of prophylactic emicizumab on the 
number of bleeds over time (i.e., bleed rate, with analysis for treated bleeds, all bleeds, treated 
spontaneous bleeds, treated joint bleeds, and treated target joint bleeds); to evaluate the efficacy 
in reducing the number of bleeds over time compared with the patient's historical bleed rate (intra-
patient comparison); to characterise the efficacy of up-titration on both an intra-patient and 
population level, also on the basis of the number of bleeds over time; to evaluate the HRQoL of 
children 8-17 years of age according to Haemo-QoL-Short Form (SF) (completed by patients); to 
evaluate proxy-reported HRQoL and aspects of caregiver burden using the Adapted Inhib-QoL 
Including Aspects of Caregiver Burden questionnaire for all children (completed by caregivers); to 
assess the number of days missed from day-care/school and days hospitalised.

Sample size (BH29992 study) 
The sample size for this study was based on feasibility and clinical considerations. Hence, at least 
20 children younger than 12 years of age and up to approximately 60 patients with haemophilia A 
with FVIII inhibitors who were receiving treatment with bypassing agents were to be enrolled in 
this study. 
During the study, re-assessment of the initially specified sample size based on enrolment 
consideration was possible. 
Randomisation 
This was a single arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study.

Statistical methods 
The primary analysis of bleed rate is to be performed 52 weeks after the last patient in the primary 
cohort has been enrolled or withdrawn prematurely, whichever occurs first. For the interim analysis 
presented in this CSR the number of bleeds, types, and locations of bleeds are summarised for all 
patients and listed for each patient individually. 
 Several exploratory analyses were conducted to characterise the type, location, frequency, and 
pattern of bleeds.  
Negative Binomial Regression Model 
At the time of the primary analysis, the number of bleeds over time (bleed rate) will be calculated 
using a negative binomial (NB) regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times, with 
time that each patient stayed in the study (efficacy period) included as an offset in the model. 
Calculated Annualised Bleeding Rate 
The number of bleeds was annualised for each patient using the following formula:  
ABR = (Number of bleeds/number of days during the efficacy period) x 365.25. For this interim 
CSR, the population ABR may not be robust as it might be driven by only a few extreme 
observations because of the short follow-up time. Therefore, the bleed rate was characterised on 
an individual patient basis. In addition, with such a short follow up period, the NB model might not 
converge or the results might be unreliable. For all patients, the number of bleeds was described 
with use of descriptive statistics. The individual ABR was calculated for patients who were on the 
study for at least 12 weeks at the same dose (including the loading doses) using the above 
formula. 
Intra-Patient Comparison 
In order to increase the robustness of the intra-patient comparison, only patients who participated 
in NIS BH29768 were included. This is because it is only possible to apply the detailed definition if 
the data are collected with the same granularity for both time periods. For the primary analysis a 
NB regression model will be used. This model estimates the rate ratio, lambda t/lambda c., which 
quantifies the risk of bleeding associated with prophylactic emicizumab (lambda t) in comparison to 
the historical bleeding events (lambda c). For this interim CSR, only individual patient’s ABRs are 
provided, in a descriptive manner, including the reduction in ABR comparing before (i.e. during NIS 
BH29768) and after entering into Study BH29992. The intra-patient comparison was performed on 
patients who were enrolled at least 12 weeks before the cut-off date of the interim CSR for Study 
BH29992

Results  
Participant flow study (BH29992 study) 
The interim analysis of efficacy and safety data, as of 28 October 2016, present a total of 20 
patients, with 19 less than 12 years of age and one ≥12 years but with a weight <40 kg. A total of 
11 (55%) patients had completed at least 12 weeks of treatment. No patient withdrew from 
treatment yet.  
Recruitment 
This is an ongoing Phase III clinical study conducted at 12 sites in 6 countries. First patient entered 
22nd of July 2016. 
The study is conducted at 12 sites in 6 countries.   
The study is also sponsored by the applicant (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd) and Chugai 
Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. 
Study period 
First patient entered study: 22nd of July 2016 
Final clinical data cut-off for all data considered for this application: 08 May 2017 for all patients, 
with an additional unplanned interim analysis for patients ≤2 years of age of 29th of September 
2017. 
Conduct of the study 
There were two protocol amendments, with Amendment 1 approved on 12th of July 16 and 
Amendment 2 in December 2016, which are not considered to impact the efficacy analyses. 
Amendment 1 contained changes to up-titration criteria, additional efficacy objectives (treated, 
non-treated bleeds) and to increase the maximum number of patients from 40 to 60 based on the 
rapid enrolment. It was also decided to leave enrolment open for patients <2 years if no patients

are included in the primary cohort, to enrol up to 5 such patients. Amendment 2 was in line with 
study BH29884, addressing the safety concerns of concomitant use of bypassing agents. 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 11 major protocol deviations occurred in 7 of 20 patients in the All Patients population (6 
patients [30.0%] with 9 procedural deviations, and 2 patients [10.0%] with 2 deviations relating to 
medication, which are not considered to have any impact. However, there appear to be some 
clusters around certain sites; e.g. site 291660. 
BMQ compliance was high (97.5%). Only 16 of the 19 (84.2%) expected Adapted Inhib-QoL 
questionnaires were completed at baseline, with all (n=10; 100%) expected questionnaires 
completed at week 13. Haemo-QoL-SF was completed only by patients aged ≥8 years at study 
entry. At baseline, 7 of the 10 (70.0%) expected questionnaires were completed, with all (n = 6; 
100%) of the expected questionnaires were completed at week 13.

Baseline data  
Baseline characteristics of patients in study BH29992 are described in the tables below. 
Four patients (20.0%) were age 2 to < 6 years. Of these, 3 patients were 3 years of age.  
All but one patient (n = 19, 95.0%) had severe haemophilia. The mean time from FVIII inhibitor 
diagnosis was 78.06 months, with the majority (n = 12, 60.0%) of patients diagnosed = 72 
months prior to study entry. Patients with a documented history of high inhibitor titre were enrolled 
in this study, however the titre was unknown for 2 patients. For the knowns, no patients had Factor 
VIII inhibitor < 5 BU. Overall, 17 patients (85.0%) had previously been treated with ITI. The 
majority (n = 18, 90.0%) of patients were treated with a prophylactic regimen prior to enrolment, 
with 2 patients (10.0%) previously on episodic treatment. The median number of bleeds in the last 
24 weeks prior to study entry was 6.0 bleeds (range: 0 - 35). Five patients (25.0%) had at least 
one target joint, with a total of 8 target joints.

Supportive studies 
• 
Non-interventional study (NIS) BH29768 
This non-interventional study (NIS) prospectively collected bleed, treatment patterns, health-
related quality of life (HRQoL), health status, and safety information in patients with haemophilia A 
in routine clinical practice. This study enrolled patients with haemophilia A, particularly those with 
severe disease or inhibitors against Factor VIII, who suffer from bleeding episodes, which are 
treated with replacement or with bypassing agents. It was conducted in 12 countries at 33 sites.  
Primary objective was to document the number and type of bleeds in haemophilia A patients with 
or without FVIII inhibitors under routine clinical practice and to estimate the number of bleeds over 
time. 
It included three cohorts (Cohort A – patients age ≥ 12 years; B – age 0-11 years both with 
inhibitors; C -patients age ≥12 years without inhibitors). Inclusion/ exclusion criteria were like the 
ones set out in the pivotal studies, however patients age ≥2 to < 12 years needed to have a higher 
previous reported bleeding history (minimum of 4 bleeds in last 6 months) compared to the pivotal 
paediatric study BH29992. Relevant results are presented as part of the intra-patient comparisons 
in the results section for the pivotal studies above. 
• 
Extension trial ACE002JP  
This was an extension of the Phase I trial ACE001JP as outlined above, conducted in 6 sites in 
Japan, including patients with and without inhibitors. Primary objective was to investigate the 
safety and efficacy of emicizumab on bleeding during long-term treatment. The study is still 
ongoing at the data cut-off date of 30th of September 2016. 
Patients were assigned to one of three emicizumab dosing groups: 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg/week. Study 
ACE002JP calculated individual patient ABRs but did not estimate population rates based on the NB 
regression model. ABRs were calculated by annualising the number of bleeding episodes that 
required treatment with coagulation factor products (‘treated bleed’).  
Results 
Study results presented herein are for all 18 patients who participated in Part C of Study 
ACE001JP. A total of 16 patients were enrolled in the extension Study ACE002JP and remained on 
treatment at the interim analysis. 
All patients were male with a median age at baseline of 32, 30, and 33 years in the 0.3, 1, and 3 
mg/kg/week groups, respectively (3 patients were adolescents 12 – 17 years of age, and 15 
patients were ≥18 and < 60 years of age).  
At study entry, 11 patients had inhibitors and 7 patients did not have inhibitors. All but 3 patients 
had a prior history of inhibitors and 8 patients overall had a prior history of ITI treatment. Ten 
patients were on prophylactic treatment prior to study entry: 7 patients without inhibitors were on 
FVIII prophylaxis, and 3 patients with FVIII inhibitors were on bypassing agent prophylaxis. The 
median numbers of bleeding episodes in the 6 months prior to first emicizumab administration 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 85/126 
 
 
 
 
 
varied by dose group: 16.0 (range: 4 - 38), 9.0 (range: 5 - 19), and 7.5 (range: 0 - 16) in the 0.3, 
1, and 3 mg/kg/week groups, respectively. 
Overall, 4 patients had had their doses up-titrated in Study ACE002JP, and 3, 5, and 8 patients 
were receiving maintenance doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/week, respectively at the time of the 
interim analysis. 
The median efficacy period was 134.1 weeks (range: 12.3 - 177.3 weeks) for the 0.3 mg/kg/week 
group (n=6), 81.0 weeks (range 4.1 - 156.3 weeks) for the 1 mg/kg/week group (n=9), and 121.1 
weeks (range: 12.1 - 130.6 weeks) for the 3 mg/kg/week group (n=9). Note that these values also 
account for those patients who up-titrated to a higher dose. 
The ABR of all patients decreased from the pre-dose period (6 months before study enrolment) 
following emicizumab administration regardless of the presence of inhibitors and/or prior use of 
prophylactic treatment. One patient had an ABR of 0 in the pre-dose period which did not change 
during treatment with emicizumab. Eight patients (1, 3, and 4 patients in the 0.3, 1, and 3 
mg/kg/week groups, respectively) experienced zero bleeding episodes on emicizumab prophylaxis. 
Of these, 6 patients had inhibitors (including 4 patients treated with prior prophylactic bypassing 
agents), and 2 patients did not have inhibitors. Three patients originally in the 0.3 mg/kg/week 
group had their dose up-titrated to 1 mg/kg/week, of which 2 patients underwent further dose 
increase to 3 mg/kg/week, and 1 patient originally in the 1 mg/kg/week group also had his dose 
up-titrated to 3 mg/kg/week. ABR for these 4 patients decreased with each up-titration step. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Two pivotal studies have been submitted. One randomised, open label, Phase III trial in patients 
aged 12 years or older with haemophilia A who have inhibitors against FVIII (BH29884) and one 
ongoing, single-arm, open-label Phase III trial in children < 12 years (study BH29992). 
Emicizumab was administered s.c. at in both studies a loading dose of 3 mg/kg/week for 4 weeks, 
followed by 1.5 mg/kg/week thereafter. Dose-up titration was an option in both trials after at least 
24 weeks. 
Both trials were designed and monitored in accordance with ICH-GCP and carried out in keeping 
with local legal requirements and meeting the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Both studies had two protocol amendments of similar content, not expected to have any impact on 
the efficacy results. The total number of major protocol deviations in both studies, are not 
considered to have major impact on the primary analyses. Compliance of providing response to the 
QoL questionnaires was high with no apparent drop over time.  
Study BH29884 enables comparison of current standard of care (episodic use of bypassing agents 
when needed – Arm B), as the control arm, with prophylactic use of emicizumab (Arm A); but also, 
intra-patient comparison of emicizumab prophylaxis (Arm C) compared to historical prophylactic 
use of bypassing agents utilising data from the non-interventional study NIS29768 of the same 
patients. Open label comparison of prophylactic use against on demand treatment is not ideal and 
raises concerns, particularly in view of observation bias regarding the secondary QoL endpoints. 
The consistency in maintaining the improvements in QoL however are reassuring in that any 
potential for bias can be considered overcome by the observed treatment effect. The chosen 
endpoints of bleeding rates, with the primary endpoint of reduction of treated bleeds (excluding 
bleeds due to procedures/ surgery) are endorsed, being patient relevant measures. The primary 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 86/126 
 
 
 
 
endpoint was measured at 24 weeks, which is considered adequate in context of results from the 
Phase I extension study, evidence suggesting an association between longer duration of 
prophylactic therapy with maintenance of ARB reduction, as well as evidence of no seasonal 
variation in bleeding. The QoL questionnaires used are validated, including cross cultural validity 
ensured. In case of the possibility of a patient/caregiver having missed the completion of a full 
questionnaire, or in case of a technical error in the device, the questionnaires were imputed and 
considered missing at random. 
Inclusion/ exclusion criteria are considered acceptable. The inclusion of adolescents (≥12 years) is 
endorsed based on disease similarity. Overall, patients included represent a population of high 
unmet need; haemophilia A patients with a documented history of high-titre inhibitors and high 
numbers of bleeds experienced while on episodic, or prophylactic bypassing treatment respectively. 
The latter highlights the importance to evaluate the potential benefit of emicizumab therapy on an 
individual basis, taking into account all clinically relevant disease history. Ongoing, or plan to 
receive ITI during the study was excluded, which is supported. Nonetheless this raises the question 
to where appropriately position emicizumab in context of the existing treatment guideline for 
patients with inhibitors, recommending immune tolerance as first line choice.  
The statistical methodology applied is considered adequate.  
Study BH29992 with its single arm design is endorsed. Inclusion/ exclusion criteria were similar, 
apart from less stringent requirements regarding previous bleeding history in patients aged ≥2 to 
< 12 years, understood as a measure to increase feasibility. The fact that patients participating in 
study BH29992 reported higher median ABRs in the run-up prior to enrolment than the minimum 
inclusion criteria for the NIS study, suggests that these patients were not considerably better 
controlled compared with those who had enrolled on the NIS study. The differences in inclusion 
criteria are not considered to have any clinically meaningful impact on the results, nor any impact 
on the ability to extrapolate efficacy based on consistent PK. 
There is inconsistency regarding the exclusion criteria of ITI between the two pivotal trials, with 
patients allowed to be recruited in case of awaiting ITI initiation and after a 72 hrs wash-out after 
failure of ITI in the paediatric trial (BH29992), in contrast to these patients excluded in study 
BH29884. The applicant acknowledges that no formal study evaluating the safety and efficacy of 
emicizumab in relation to ITI was performed, which has been added to section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Patients scheduled to undergo major elective surgery were excluded in both trials. Whilst the 
restriction is understood from a risk mitigation perspective, emicizumab is intended for long term 
prophylactic administration. This is hence important data missing, particularly regarding efficacy 
and safety during major surgeries in emergency situations. This has consequently been included in 
the RMP as missing information. Adequate wording has been added to section 4.2 of the SmPC to 
indicate that safety and efficacy has not formally been evaluated in the surgical setting, with 
reference made to the dosing guidance on the use of bypassing agents in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The long-term extension study ACE002JP, conducted in Japan, enrolled patients with and without 
inhibitors using a different maintenance dosing regimen (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/week). It calculated 
individual patient ABRs but did not estimate population rates based on the NB regression model. 
Nonetheless it provides long term efficacy data.  
The non-interventional study NIS BH29768, set up to collect bleed, treatment patterns, health-
related quality of life, health status, and safety information in patients with haemophilia A in 
routine clinical practice used inclusion/ exclusion criteria like the ones set out in the pivotal trials. It 
included three cohorts. It was set up to allow intra-patient comparison, with patients enrolled into 
the NIS given priority for enrolment into the pivotal trials.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The data cut-off for study BH29884 (25th of Oct 2016) was triggered by the primary analysis 
(randomised comparison), with the interim analysis for BH29992 conducted around the same time 
to prepare the dossier for MAA (data cut-off 28th of Oct 2016). This means that follow-up data on 
patients beyond 6 months from study BH29884 are limited (74 patients with observation time ≥ 6 
months; 1 patient ≥ 1 year). For the paediatric study BH29992, only interim results on ABR are 
presented for 10 patients who completed 12 weeks of treatment. Long term efficacy is based on a 
total of 16 Japanese patients on study ACE002JP exposed for > 1 year.  
Study BH29884 screened 114 patients of which 109 were eligible for enrollment (total of 32 
[29.4%] under age 18); 35 enrolled into Arm A and 18 into Arm B (with 4, respectively 2 patients 
under the age of 18 years). A total of 4 patients withdrew from the trial, one prior dosing due to 
personal reasons and 3 from treatment (2 due to AEs; 1 due to physician’s decision based on 
mental illness), all in the prophylaxis arm. The small number of withdrawals due to AEs (1.8%) 
although both related to the safety concern around concomitant use of bypassing agents (see 
Safety section below), is reassuring as regards to any potential tolerability concerns. Following the 
initial data cut-off, additional 4 patients were included in Arm D and 4 switching to Arm Bemi. The 
additional data from these patients do not change the overall effect size observed and are 
therefore not discussed any further. 
Overall, baseline demographics, disease characteristics and past medical and medication history 
are as expected, representing the target population; patients with long standing history of mainly 
severe haemophilia A and inhibitors, with half of them having had previous ITI; a majority with 
target joints and more than 9 bleeds in the past 24 weeks. Patients on Arm C have been on 
prophylactic bypassing treatment. Comparing use of bypassing agents (aPCC, rFVIIa) during 
prophylactic treatment with emicizumab with the non-haemophilia medication history, it appears 
that there is a trend for increasing use of rFVIIa for treatment of bleeds while on emicizumab 
prophylaxis, most apparent for those on previous aPCC prophylaxis, is likely due to the fact that 
patients were no longer using aPCC for prophylaxis and on-demand treatment with rFVIIa is far 
more convenient with a shorter preparation and infusion time.  
Using the NB regression model to analyse the bleed rate for treated bleeds for the randomised 
population, there was a statistically significant 87% reduction in bleed rate with emicizumab 
prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis (Arm B ABR = 23.3; Arm A = 2.9; ABR ratio 0.13 [95% 
CI: 0.057; 0.277]; p < 0.0001 for stratified Wald test. A total of 22 of 35 patients (62.9%) in Arm 
A had no treated bleeds at all. The robustness was confirmed through additional sensitivity 
analyses. Subgroup analyses confirmed the primary endpoint, with a wide CI noted for those 
patients without the presence of a target joints. Although likely to contribute, this observation is 
not merely due to the small sample size. Calculating the individual ABRs of patients with no target 
joints at baseline it can be considered that the wide confidence interval associated with the risk 
ratio for treated bleeds are not reflective of a more heterogeneous patient population, but rather as 
a result of individual outliers in each arm.  
The results of the secondary bleed endpoints are consistent with the primary endpoint, with all 
bleeds, treated joint bleeds and target joint bleeds, all showing similar rates of reduction of around 
80-90%. With the caveated of no direct comparison of different prophylactic treatments, the 
consistency of results is considered reassuring. The intra-patient comparison of bleed rates in Arm 
A and C showed a statistically significant reduction of ABR (Arm A NB analysis for patients with at 
least 12 weeks of treatment (Arm A NIS ABR = 21.9; Arm A ABR = 1.8; ABR ratio = 0.08 [95% 
CI: 0.033;0.209], p < 0.0001; Arm C NB analysis for patients with at least 12 weeks of treatment 
(Arm C NIS ABR = 17.0; Arm C ABR = 3.6; ABR ratio = 0.21 [0.090;0.488], p < 0.0003),

confirmed by sensitivity analyses. When adjusting for lack of compliance, the ABR ratio in the 
adjusted intra-patient analysis was similar to that from the non-adjusted analysis (ABR Ratio=0.34 
for both), showing that the effect of emicizumab is consistent even after adjusting for compliance. 
The quality of life measures evaluated as secondary endpoints confirm the overall benefit observed 
with treatment of emicizumab up to week 24. When comparing QoL responses at time of bleeds 
(i.e. unscheduled visits), indeed on a patient level the health status is lower at the time of patient 
experiencing a bleed, which would be considered expected. Yet when looking at the group level, 
the average score for the Emicizumab arm as higher in excess of the clinically meaningful 
improvement of 0.07 points on the IUS versus no prophylactic patients (i.e., emicizumab mean 
IUS=0.56; no prophylaxis mean IUS=0.38), which was similar on the VAS as well. The latter is 
reassuring in view of a clinically meaningful improvement, shown even in case of a bleed. 
Most treated bleeds occurred in joints. Around 2/3 and almost half of treated bleeds in Arm B and 
A respectively were spontaneous. The summary of all bleeds (without 72 hrs rule) indicated a 
reduction in spontaneous bleeds (Arm B 69.0% vs Arm A 38.2%). Whilst the number of patients 
with trauma was lower in the emicizumab arm (Arm A 45.7% vs Arm B 77.8%), there were more 
numbers of traumatic bleeds in the emicizumab arm (Arm A 55.5% vs Arm B 29.2%), which could 
well be due to the open label design, with patients feeling more protected on emicizumab 
prophylaxis. The median time of all bleeds (without 72 hrs rule) was similar, with the mode at 
week 4 and 24 (~70% vs 76% for Arms A and B). Appreciating the small numbers, there is some 
concern around the higher numbers of treated bleeds and all bleeds following minor surgery/ 
procedures on the emicizumab arm (treated Arm A 53.8% vs Arm B 31.4%]; all bleeds 6.4% Arm 
A vs 1.8% Arm B). Again, this might well be due to the open label design, with physicians feeling 
the ‘prophylactic’ patient being better protected, which would be consistent with the results of 
traumatic bleeds as described above. But it could equally be a sign of investigators’ apprehension 
to proactively and early on, intervene with the use of bypassing agents due to concerns around 
drug-drug interactions. Additional summary data of bleeding events following minor procedures/ 
surgery are however not available, mainly due to the fact that management was based on the 
physicians discretion, hence the lack of detailed data collection. Appreciating that the use of 
emicizumab in the surgical setting has not formally been evaluated, no clear conclusions are able 
to be drawn from the descriptive individual evidence available on this issue. Hence, the proposed 
inclusion in section 4.2 of the SmPC of the statement that safety and efficacy in the surgical setting 
has not been evaluated which reflects the lack of these data and is endorsed to adequately inform 
physicians. 
Study BH29992 enrolled 20 patients up to the time of the initial data cut-off, aged between 3-11 
years. No patient withdrew from treatment so far. One patient included age 12 years was enrolled 
because of weight (<40kg), but was not included in the primary efficacy population.  
In the 19 patients observed the number of patients without treated bleeds, treated spontaneous 
bleeds or treated joint and target joint bleeds ranged between 95% and 100%. Annualised bleed 
rate was calculated only for patients who had been on study treatment for at least 12 weeks. Nine 
of ten patients (90.0%) had an ABR of 0, while 1 patient (10.0%) had an ABR of 4.1 due to the 1 
treated spontaneous bleed. Appreciating disease similarity between adults/ adolescents (≥ 12 
years) and children as currently included in the analysis (3- < 12years), the observed ABR for all 
bleeds appear similar to the model based ABR described for Arm A in study BH29884 (5.5 [95% CI 
(2.58; 8.6)].  
During the procedure, updated data from the pivotal Study BH29992 with a clinical cut-off date of 
08 May 2017 were presented by the applicant, including data from a total of 60 patients of whom 7 
patients are ≤2 years of age (including 2 patients < 2 years of age), 50 patients aged > 2 and ≤12

years, and 3 patients are ≥12 years of age (weight < 40 kg). This gives an additional 
approximately 6 months of follow-up, with a median observation period of 9 weeks (range. 1.6 - 
41.6 weeks). The ABR for treated (treated bleeds) patients aged < 12 years and on the same dose 
for at least 12 weeks in the ‘ABR Patients population’ (n=23) was shown to be 0.2 (95% CI: 0.06; 
0.62). For all bleeds the ABR was 2.9 (95% CI:1.75; 4.94). For both treated spontaneous bleeds 
and treated joint bleeds the ABR was 0.1 (95% CI: 0.01; 0.47). For treated target joint bleeds the 
ABR was not estimable by the NB regression model as no treated target joint bleeds were reported. 
The calculated ABRs were consistent with the ABRs estimated using the NB regression model. The 
median ABR was 0 for all endpoints except all bleeds. Overall the results were consistent with 
results from the BH29884 trial. 
Additional data for children ≤2 years of age have been provided with a clinical cut-off date of 29 
September 2017. The efficacy and safety data include a total of 10 patients ≤2 years of age 
(including 5 patients <2 years of age; ranging from 14.7 months to 34.2 months) with a median 
observation period of 23 weeks (range: 7.4 to 28.7 weeks), with 9 patients (90%) having had an 
efficacy period ≥12 weeks, and 4 patients (40%) ≥ 24 weeks. No intra-patient comparison has 
been included as none of these patients had participated in the NIS. Overall, no bleeds were 
reported in 8 of 10 patients; in 2 of 10 patients, traumatic bleeds were reported (2 bleeds in each 
patient); all were categorised as “other” (non-joint, non-muscle), and none of these bleeds were 
treated. The results are again considered generally supportive of efficacy, yet to be seen in context 
of being interim results. The efforts to recruit 10 patients ≤ 2 years needs to be appreciated and 
seen in context of the rarity of the population. 
The applicant’s intention to including paediatric patients from birth onwards in the proposed label is 
based on full extrapolation for patients 0-<1 years of age and partial extrapolation for patients age 
≥1-<2 years. The applicant provided literature data showing that the coagulation system matures 
over time, while maintaining full function, with different levels of FIX and FX reaching maturity, i.e. 
adult levels, during the adolescent age, yet no difference in efficacy and safety of Emicizumab 
could be seen between these age groups compared to adults based on the additional data 
submitted. Literature data on the use of FVIII replacement therapies in pre-term and term 
neonates, those patients with the lowest levels of FIX and FX, indicate similar efficacy compared to 
older children, implying the levels of FIX and FX are sufficient to mediate FVIII activity. Given 
current knowledge it is considered sufficiently justified that that the age-dependent variations of 
FIX and FX in newborns and infants should have no clinically meaningful impact on response, 
assuming similar exposure.  
In context of the proposed dose being located at the flat part of the dose-response curve, with an 
overall large effect size observed, the additional modelled data on PK extrapolation have provided 
sufficient reassurance of similar exposure, with a potential risk of under-exposure, which is, if 
existing, considered unlikely to result in a clinically meaningful response differences (see Section 
2.4.2. above). 
Based on the additional study results, modelled data as well as relevant literature data provided by 
the applicant and discussed in the context of its limitations and strengths, it can be concluded that 
the exposure-response relationship between the source population (i.e. patients age 1 years and 
above) and the target population (i.e. 0-1 years of age) is assumed to be similar, with any 
potential exposure differences not translating into clinically relevant differences.  
Overall, this allows agreeing on an extrapolation approach for all patients to be included in the 
label. The lack of data in this age group has been added to Section 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC, as 
well as missing information in the RMP. .

The applicant commits to continue enrolment of patients < 2 years of age until the protocol defined 
end for patients ≥2 years of age, expected to be in April-May 2018. This will allow additional 
patients in the youngest age group to be recruited, increasing the robustness of the data-set in this 
age group. As study BH29992 is a PIP study, full compliance will need to be shown for which 
completion is required. In addition to the full compliance check, it is agreed that the results from 
this paediatric study will then be subject to an obligatory Art. 46 procedure and therefore be 
assessed by CHMP. It is hence ensured that all available data will be subject to CHMP scrutiny to 
allow further confirmation of the extrapolation assumptions made, utilising all data available from 
the relevant clinical study.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Prophylactic use of emicizumab in inhibitor patients age ≥1 years and above with and without 
previous ITI experience indicates clinically meaningful reduction of bleeds in the range of around 
80-90% compared to standard of care of ‘on-demand’ use of bypassing agents. This is consistent 
for all bleed related endpoints, including the intra-patient comparison for those patients on 
previous prophylactic use of bypassing agents. This coherently translates into improvements in 
QoL. The inclusion of patients <1 year of age based on full extrapolation is considered acceptable. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
As of the updated data of 21st of April 2017 (BH29884) and 08th of May 2017 (BH29992), 189 
patients had received at least one dose of emicizumab, with an overall exposure of 157.8 patient-
years, providing safety data from 48 additional patients with haemophilia A and inhibitors treated 
with emicizumab compared to the initial submitted data package. The duration of exposure to 
emicizumab and number of patients exposed varied between arms and studies. See Table below for 
summary.

Based on the initial data cut-off date, three patients (15.0%) reported a total of 9 AEs that were 
related to emicizumab treatment. All of these related AEs were ISRs. None of the ISRs required 
treatment, and all resolved within 1-2 days without dose modification or interruption. Three 
patients (15%) reported 3 SAEs in total: catheter site infection, mouth haemorrhage, and

Updated safety information regarding SAEs based on the April 2017 data-cut off showed similar 
results to the ones presented as part of the initial submission. Across all studies, 27 patients 
(14.3%) had a total of 35 SAEs. System organ classes with the highest incidence of SAEs were 
infections and infestations (9 patients, 4.8%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (5 
patients, 2.6%), blood and lymphatic system disorders (4 patients, 2.1%), and gastrointestinal 
disorders (4 patients, 2.1%). The following SAEs occurred in more than 1 patient: device-related 
infection (3 patients), appendicitis (2 patients), muscle haemorrhage (3 patients), thrombotic 
microangiopathy (3 patients), and haemophilia (2 patients). 
Study BH29992 
As per data cut off May 2017, six patients (10%) reported SAEs: catheter site infection (2x), 
mouth haemorrhage, and appendicitis, muscle haemorrhage (2x), eye pain during the treatment 
period. All of the SAEs resolved and were mainly associated with a surgery or procedure. 
No SAEs were reported in treated patients aged ≤2 years (data cut-off September 2017).

Deaths  
Although there were no deaths in any of the emicizumab clinical studies at the time of data cut-off 
date, one patient in Arm C in study BH29884 died due to an SAE of rectal haemorrhage after the 
initial data cut-off date for the primary analysis This patient also experienced thrombotic 
microangiopathy.  
There was also one death reported in a compassionate use program. 
The narratives are provided below: 
1.  Patient  
This was a 41-year-old white male with haemophilia A and history of high-titre inhibitor. The 
patient was initially diagnosed with severe haemophilia A and developed a Factor VIII inhibitor in 
1981. The patient underwent previous immune tolerance induction in March 2014. Prior 
prophylactic treatment included aPCC. At study entry, the patient had 22 bleeds in the last 24 
weeks, with no target joints. 
Patient’s surgical history includes ileostomy placement due to perforated bowel secondary to high-
dose opiate use in 2007. His baseline conditions were hepatitis C, hypertension, haemophilic 
arthropathy, and pain. The patient received the first of his four-weekly loading dose of emicizumab 
3 mg/kg/week on 8 June 2016. From the study start to the time of the two SAEs described herein, 
he reported 13 bleeds but had not used bypassing agents to treat any of them. At the patient’s 
week 33 visit on 18 January 2017 (Study Day 225), the patient’s haemoglobin was 144 g/L, 
platelet count was 181 x 109/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum creatinine within normal 
range.  
On 30th of January 2017 (study Day 238), the patient presented to the hospital complaining of 
rectal bleeding, postural dizziness, and exertional dyspnoea. Of note, the patient did not have any 
bleeding from the ileostomy site and declined receipt of blood and blood products throughout his 
entire hospital course despite experiencing an SAE of rectal haemorrhage. He received 11 doses of 
rFVIIa over 3 consecutive days and underwent multiple interventions (haemostatic powder 
application, absorbable haemostat packing, and embolisation of rectal arteries) in attempts to 
control the bleeding. Despite these, the patient continued to have rectal haemorrhage. On Study 
Day 240, the patient’s bypassing agent treatment was changed to aPCC, with temporary cessation 
of bleeding. On Study Day 243 (05 Feb 2017; 4 days following the start of aPCC), the patient was 
diagnosed with thrombotic microangiopathy after being found to have microangiopathic haemolytic 
anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. aPCC was discontinued, and the patient 
underwent 2 sessions of total plasma exchange with albumin as the replacement fluid. On Study 
Day 246, the patient had recurrent rectal haemorrhage, for which additional arterial embolisation 
and surgery were deemed not to be feasible. At the time of the patient’s last laboratory 
assessment (3 days after discontinuing aPCC), the patient’s platelet count and LDH were 
improving, and the investigator assessed the patient's thrombotic microangiopathy to be 
recovering/resolving. The patient continued to decline receipt of blood and blood products and was 
placed on comfort care before passing away the same day.  
The patient's most recent trough emicizumab concentration prior to the rectal haemorrhage was 
37.2 μg/mL (range while receiving maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg/week: 33.7-48.9 μg/mL). 
2.  Case narrative for patient on compassionate use program 
This was a 38-year-old male patient with a past medical history of Haemophilia A, who experienced 
a fatal intracranial bleed and fatal disseminated methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus Aureus

(MSSA) infection. In August 2014, he developed Factor VIII inhibitors and was reportedly having 
multiple bleeding episodes, some of which were life-threatening. 
The patient attempted multiple alternative therapies (Porcine FVIII and aPCC), but developed 
allergic reactions to them. The patient also tried multiple unsuccessful immune tolerance therapies 
involving the use of immune suppressive agents. The patient started emicizumab in September 
2015. 
On 17 February 2016, the patient presented to the emergency room complaining of chest pain with 
worsening leg pain and swelling. His initial evaluation included a lower extremity ultrasound that 
did not reveal a deep vein thrombosis, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan that was 
consistent with a pulmonary infarct and blood cultures that grew Staphylococcus Aureus. The 
patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring and started on treatment with broad-
spectrum antibiotics for treatment of sepsis and septic emboli. According to the treating physician, 
anti-coagulation was not started. Over the next several days, the patient’s neurologic condition 
began to deteriorate. He initially complained of weakness, which progressed to altered mental 
status. Initial CT scans showed no evidence of intracranial pathology, but on 21 February 2016, an 
MRI of his brain showed that he had an intracranial haemorrhage. The patient was treated with 
rFVIIa when a ventriculostomy catheter was placed. Despite this, his condition continued to 
deteriorate, and he died on 24 February 2016. 
The treating physician assessed that the cause of death was due to intracranial haemorrhage and 
disseminated MSSA infection. An autopsy was performed and early preliminary information from 
the pathologist showed evidence of extensive infection throughout the body (i.e., purulent 
material). The final autopsy report showed there were abscesses throughout the body involving 
multiple organs (lungs, heart and kidney). There was extensive involvement of the heart including 
the left ventricle. There was no evidence of a deep vein thrombus from the lower extremity that 
migrated to the pulmonary vessels, instead they were septic emboli. The treating physician and the 
sponsor assessed the fatal intracranial haemorrhage and fatal disseminated MSSA infection as not 
related to emicizumab. 
Immunological events 
Injection Site Reactions (ISR) 
Following the data cut-off April/May 2017, the incidence of local ISRs was similar in all three age 
groups: 17.5% in children, 18.4% in adolescents, and 19.1% in adults. In addition, in studies 
BH29884 and BH29992, there were no ISRs leading to discontinuation, as part form one patient in 
study ACE002JP presented as part of the initial data package. 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) 
Patients (trial ACE002JP, BH29884 & BH29992) 
The incidence of anti-emicizumab antibodies was low (4 patients, 2.8%). All 4 patients received 
treatment with emicizumab in Study ACE002JP (3 patients in the 0.3 mg/kg cohort and 1 patient in 
the 1.0 mg/kg cohort).  
Three patients tested negative prior to administration and positive after treatment start 
(treatment-induced response), while 1 patient tested positive prior to administration and had post-
baseline samples with a titre at least 4- fold greater compared with the baseline sample 
(treatment-boosted response). In one of the four patients, the ADA detected at two occasions was 
IgE based, with ISR observed. The other patients no IgE AB were detected.  
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018

No patients had neutralising anti-emicizumab antibodies, and there was no clinical significance 
associated with these anti-emicizumab antibodies.  
No anti-emicizumab antibodies were detected in Studies BH29884 or BH29992. Two patients 
however had pharmacokinetic profiles potentially indicative of the generation of anti-emicizumab 
antibodies. Patient #1002 had emicizumab plasma concentrations that consistently declined 
between week 13 and 33 with decreasing PD markers over time (thrombin generation and 
chromogenic FVIII activity). However, no bleeds were experienced while participating in this study. 
The second patient (#1121) had a similar decline in emicizumab plasma concentrations over time 
(between week 5, to week 25). This patient qualified for up-titration to 3 mg/kg/week but his 
emicizumab plasma concentration after up-titration at week 33 was, however, lower than 
anticipated. The patient experienced one additional bleed (spontaneous left ankle hem arthrosis) 
14 days after up-titration but no additional bleeds thereafter.  
Healthy subjects (trial ACE001JP Part A & B, JP29574) 
After a single SC dose of emicizumab, 2 of 48 Japanese and Caucasian healthy subjects in study 
ACE001JP tested positive for ADAs. Both subjects (1 Japanese and 1 Caucasian) received the 0.1 
mg/kg emicizumab dose. One of the 2 subjects tested positive for treatment-induced anti-
emicizumab antibodies (negative at pre-dose and positive at two post-dose occasions). In this 
subject (Caucasian HV), emicizumab was eliminated earlier than in subjects who tested negative, 
and the shortening of aPTT and promotion of thrombin generation dissipated earlier than in 
subjects who tested negative. The anti-emicizumab antibodies detected in the plasma of both 
healthy subjects were not IgE. No adverse events were observed in subjects with detected 
antibodies. 
In study JP29574 anti-drug antibodies were detected in four subjects. Of these subjects, the 
subjects in whom ADAs were newly detected were 2/36 (treatment induced 5.6%) receiving 
subcutaneous injections of the new preparation in Groups B through D (one in each group, with 
one 1 of 12 subjects (8.3%) in the IV Group E). In these 3 subjects, plasma emicizumab was 
eliminated earlier than in subjects who tested negative. PD responses (shortening of aPTT and 
promotion of thrombin generation in FVIII-neutralised plasma) dissipated earlier than in the 
subjects who tested negative. No obvious effect on plasma FIX and FX concentrations was 
observed in these subjects. The anti-emicizumab antibodies detected in plasma were non-IgE. No 
adverse events were observed in subjects with detected antibodies. 
Updated safety data 
No new anti-drug antibodies were detected in patients between the first and the second data cut-
off. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, there were no changes of clinical significance in haematology or chemistry laboratory 
parameters in the emicizumab clinical studies. 
Safety in special populations 
Overall, no appreciable differences were observed in the AE profile of emicizumab as a function of 
age, based on the current available data (only 3 patients ≥ 65 years).

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The incidence of thromboembolic and thrombotic microangiopathy events in the emicizumab 
clinical development program was 1.4% for each type of event (i.e. 2 of 141 patients with 
thromboembolic events and 2 of 141 patients with thrombotic microangiopathy). All cases were 
observed in Study BH29884, and all 4 patients had recent exposure to aPCC concurrently with 
emicizumab. Overall, these cases were associated with a cumulative dose of aPCC that was higher 
than the majority of those received in the study. Evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy 
resolution was seen within 1 week following discontinuation of aPCC. Patients who experienced 
thromboembolic, with emicizumab treatment stopped, were reported as recovering in the presence 
of emicizumab given its long half-life. The TE of skin necrosis was also confirmed to be resolved at 
the time of the second data cut-off (with the onset date of 28 September 2016, not until 29 March 
2017), but still taking longer than the other TE events.  
No thromboembolic or thrombotic microangiopathy events were reported in patients receiving 
rFVIIa alone concurrently with emicizumab. An interaction between aPCC and emicizumab 
treatment resulting in these events was therefore initially suspected, and detailed investigations 
were performed.  
As a first step, the applicant conducted an aggregate analysis at the level of individual 
administrations of aPCC (‘treatment events’). The analysis focused on Study BH29884 only. The 
first 7 days of emicizumab exposure and data in safety follow-up period (30 days after 
discontinuation of emicizumab prophylaxis) were excluded for the purposes of this analysis, due to 
low emicizumab concentration at these times. The aim was to examine whether the cumulative 
dose of aPCC per treatment event was linked to the occurrence of these AEs. Based on this 
analysis, there were 18 patients who experienced a total of 65 treatment events of the use of 
aPCC. All 4 cases of thromboembolic and thrombotic microangiopathy events were linked to high 
cumulative doses of aPCC (i.e., > 200 U/kg). Note that 2 of the patients who experienced 
thromboembolic or thrombotic microangiopathy events each had an earlier treatment event, or 
events, with cumulative doses of aPCC <100 U/kg that were not associated with thromboembolic 
or thrombotic microangiopathy events.  
To further support that thrombotic microangiopathy or thromboembolic events were associated 
with aPCC use, rather than patient characteristics, the applicant also reviewed baseline 
demographics and disease characteristics (haemophilia history, medical history, and bleeding 
events in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry), with no obvious differences in these baseline 
characteristics observed.  
Categorical analyses looked at the average exposure to aPCC over 24 hours and the total duration 
of the aPCC treatment events, as well as the distribution of cumulative doses of treatment events 
and compared those consisting of a single dose of aPCC with those consisting of multiple doses. Of 
the 65 aPCC treatment events, 7 consisted of an average 24-hour aPCC dose ≥100 U/kg and lasted 
over multiple 24-hour periods. Four of these 7 events were associated with thromboembolic and 
thrombotic microangiopathy events. All of the treatment events associated with thromboembolic or 
thrombotic microangiopathy events consisted of multiple aPCC doses. 
In a next step the cumulative dose of aPCC within a 24-hour period was looked at (24-hour interval 
started at each aPCC dose and included all treatments administered within the next 24 hours; a 
treatment could belong to more than one 24-hour interval). All thromboembolic and thrombotic 
microangiopathy events were associated with at least one instance of the cumulative aPCC dose 
being >100 U/kg within a 24-hour interval during the contemporaneous treatment event.

Similar analyses were performed for treatment events with rFVIIa, which showed that zero 
treatment events where rFVIIa was administered alone were associated with thromboembolic or 
thrombotic microangiopathy events. Note that 1 patient had 1 treatment event with rFVIIa prior to 
diagnosis of thrombotic microangiopathy and 3 additional treatment events with rFVIIa while the 
AE was ongoing. The thrombotic microangiopathy AE resolved while the patient received factor 
rFVII. 
In summary, the aggregate treatment event analyses showed that a high cumulative dose of aPCC 
administered concomitantly with emicizumab was associated with an increased risk of development 
of thromboembolic or thrombotic microangiopathy events. Specifically, all patients who developed 
thromboembolic or thrombotic microangiopathy events received aPCC doses > 100 U/kg over 24 
hours, and no patients receiving concomitant aPCC ≤100 U/kg over 24 hours or rFVIIa alone at any 
dose or duration developed thromboembolic or thrombotic microangiopathy events. 
After the initial data cut-off in 2016, an additional patient experienced a thrombotic 
microangiopathy event (see Section SAE/ Deaths above). This patient received cumulative aPCC 
doses > 100 U/kg over 24 hours, similar to the other patients who developed thromboembolic or 
thrombotic microangiopathy events. While this patient also had a rFVIIa treatment event preceding 
the thrombotic microangiopathy, the aPCC treatment event started after the rFVIIa treatment 
event 3 days prior to and immediately preceded the diagnosis of the thrombotic microangiopathy 
event. Overall, the information from this additional case further supports the conclusions of these 
aggregate analyses. 
Updated safety data  
No additional patients experienced an AE of TMA following the second amendment and the DIL, 
which implemented the risk mitigation measures to address the potential risk related to the DDI as 
discussed above. 
One additional even of TE was however reported: a device occlusion. This event occurred in a 
patient in Arm Bemi who also had experienced deep vein thrombosis prior to switching to 
emicizumab. The patient was not receiving treatment with aPCC or other bypassing agents when 
he had the device occlusion. The AE of device occlusion was Grade 1, not serious, and assessed by 
the investigator as not related to emicizumab. This AE resolved without sequelae. 
Proposed Mechanism of Action for Drug-Drug Interaction between Emicizumab and aPCC 
The pathophysiological mechanism(s) by which the posited drug-drug interaction between 
emicizumab and aPCC results in thrombotic microangiopathy events has not yet been fully 
elucidated. 
The applicant’s key hypothesis is that both thromboembolic and thrombotic microangiopathy 
events have been mediated by temporarily increased FIXa-emicizumab-activated factor X (FXa) 
ternary complex formation on the surface of a phospholipid bilayer and excessive thrombin 
generation, with localisation to certain microvascular beds. 
Emicizumab likely has a unique interaction with aPCC, due to the inclusion of emicizumab’s 
substrates within aPCC, as well as other coagulation factors with long half-lives (e.g., prothrombin) 
that accumulate with repeated dosing (Sørensen et al. 2011) Figure 18. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 103/126 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 18: Proposed interaction between emicizumab and aPCC 
It is conceivable that, in addition to the independent, procoagulant effects of aPCC, the presence of 
FIX, FIXa, FX, and FXa (included at low levels in aPCC, which primarily contains prothrombin 
complex zymogens) may increase the frequency and concentration of enzyme (FIXa)-cofactor 
(emicizumab)-substrate (FX) complex formation in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in an 
increase in emicizumab’s cofactor activity and capacity to generate thrombin. In contrast, rFVIIa 
does not directly impact emicizumab’s potential to form the intrinsic tenase complex, which is in 
agreement with clinical results showing that TE and TME events were associated with high 
cumulative doses of concomitant aPCC treatment but not rFVIIa treatment. 
This hypothesised coagulation-mediated mechanism of action is further supported by in vitro and in 
vivo studies (see also non-clinical discussion).  
The clinical course of the thromboembolic and thrombotic microangiopathy events in Study 
BH29884 is not consistent with that of typical thromboembolism (e.g., deep vein 
thrombosis/pulmonary embolism) and thrombotic microangiopathy events: the thromboembolic 
events did not require treatment with anticoagulation and the thrombotic microangiopathy events 
started to resolve within 1 week following discontinuation of aPCC. The latter finding argues against 
mechanistic processes that involve autoantibodies against von Willebrand factor cleaving proteases 
(i.e., thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) or dysregulation of the alternative complement 
pathway (i.e., atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome), both of which are generally associated with 
prolonged, systemic therapeutic interventions before remission can be achieved.  
Other potential mechanisms of action of thrombotic microangiopathy associated with the use of 
aPCC and emicizumab cannot be completely ruled out as an explanation for the interaction 
between emicizumab with aPCC now.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Table 35: Adverse Events leading to discontinuation from Treatment, Safety Population -
studies BH29884; BH29992; ACE002JP 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
A total of 189 patients have received at least one dose of emicizumab at the time of the second 
clinical data cut-off (21st of April 2017 (BH29884) and 08th of May 2017 (BH29992)), with an 
overall exposure of 157.8 patient-years, providing safety data from 48 additional patients with 
haemophilia A and inhibitors. Long term exposure data (i.e. > 1 year) is based on Japanese 
patients from study ACE002JP.  
The overall safety profile of emicizumab appears to be tolerable. A total of 4 patients (2.1%) had 
AEs leading to discontinuation from study treatment, of which 2 patients were in Study BH29884 
(one due to TMA; one due to TA) and 1 patient in Study ACE002JP due to ISR. AEs leading to dose 
modifications/ interruptions was observed in 5.4% (6/189).  
The most common AEs related to nervous system disorders (19.0%, mainly headache), general 
disorders and administration site conditions (34.9%, mainly ISRs), thrombotic microangiopathy 
(1.4%), gastrointestinal disorders (21.7%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
(19.6%, mainly arthralgia). 
There were no clinically significant changes in haematology or chemistry laboratory parameters in 
the emicizumab clinical studies.  
No appreciable safety differences were observed in special populations. However, due to the limited 
data currently available (e.g. no patient <1 years; 3 ≥65 years), section 4.2 of the SmPC mentions 
that there are no data in patients less than 1 year of age and that there are no data in patients 
over 75 years old. In addition, “use in neonate and infants” and “use in elderly” have been added 
as missing information in the RMP. Additional safety data in patients < 2 years of age as part of the 
ongoing study BH29992 (PIP study) will be provided. Please see section below.

No dose adjustments are recommended in patients with mild renal or mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). Emicizumab has not been studied in patients with 
moderate or severe renal impairment or severe hepatic impairment. 
Treatment with bypassing agents should be discontinued the day before starting Hemlibra therapy. 
Physicians should discuss with all patients and/or caregivers the exact dose and schedule of 
bypassing agents to use, if required while receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis. 
Hemlibra increases the patient’s coagulation potential. The bypassing agent dose required may 
therefore be lower than that used without Hemlibra prophylaxis. The dose and duration of 
treatment with bypassing agents will depend on the location and extent of bleeding, and the 
patient’s clinical condition. Use of aPCC should be avoided unless no other treatment 
options/alternatives are available. If aPCC is indicated in a patient receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis, 
the initial dose should not exceed 50 U/kg and laboratory monitoring is recommended (including 
but not restricted to renal monitoring, platelet testing, and evaluation of thrombosis). If bleeding is 
not controlled with the initial dose of aPCC up to 50 U/kg, additional aPCC doses should be 
administered under medical guidance or supervision with consideration made to laboratory 
monitoring for the diagnosis of TMA or thromboembolism and verification of bleeds prior to 
repeated dosing. The total aPCC dose should not exceed 100 U/kg in the first 24-hours of 
treatment. Treating physicians must carefully weigh the risk of TMA and thromboembolism against 
the risk of bleeding when considering aPCC treatment beyond a maximum of 100 U/kg in the first 
24-hours. 
In clinical trials, no cases of TMA or thrombotic events were observed with use of activated 
recombinant human FVII (rFVIIa) alone in patients receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis. 
Bypassing agent dosing guidance should be followed for at least 6 months following discontinuation 
of Hemlibra prophylaxis (SmPC section 4.4). The safety and efficacy of emicizumab in patients 
receiving ongoing immune tolerance induction have not yet been established. No data are 
available. 
There are two cases of death, although one not as part of the submitted trials, but on the 
compassionate use program. The cause of death of the patient on trial BH29884 was essentially 
due to recurrent rectal haemorrhage which occurred due to lack of efficacy while on emicizumab 
prophylaxis. The special circumstances of the patient not having consented to receive blood 
products are appreciated and acknowledged to have been a contributory factor. The death of the 
patient on the compassionate use program due to disseminated MSSA infection followed by an 
intracranial haemorrhage was most likely triggered by the septic event. It is acknowledged that 
death due to sepsis is one of the most common causes in patients with haemophilia. 
Thrombin generation data from the three studies ACE001JP, ACE002JP, BH29884, indicated a 
continuous potential for thrombin generation for the duration of treatment, not a continuous 
presence of activated thrombin. In addition, D-Dimer and prothrombin fragment 1+2 data show a 
coagulation system not globally activated. Whilst this is not direct evidence of adequate thrombin 
degradation, indeed it shows a sustained potential for thrombin generation in a coagulation system 
not globally activated, indicating a balance which is not considered of direct concern.  
What remains unknown at present, is the issue of long term use, as reflected in the RMP 
particularly regarding the impact on the balance of the known bi-directional relationship between 
coagulation and inflammation (local and systemic). However, as emicizumab is not pro−thrombotic 
and does not, itself, activate coagulation, it can only accelerate the tenase reaction after FIX is 
activated by normal physiological processes. Therefore, it is unlikely to cause high or exaggerated 
levels of coagulation proteases leading to induction of pro-inflammatory processes. In addition, 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 106/126 
 
 
 
 
there is no correlation between increase in infection and infestation AEs and increased exposure to 
Emicizumab. Whilst no definite conclusion can be drawn, it is agreed to be unlikely that 
Emicizumab impacts on patients’ inflammatory processes or innate immune responses over time. 
Generally, haemostatic efficacy requires not only effective initial haemostasis, but also a 
maintained state of haemostasis with fibrin plugs resistant to premature lysis. Appreciating the 
clinical course of these events in view of its unusual short and uncomplicated period of resolution, 
in comparison to other TMA events it needs to be appreciated that the pathophysiology underlying 
the DDI related TMA remains to be fully elucidated. The ‘clean’ mechanism of action by which 
rFVIIa interferes in the coagulation cascade in this patient population could explain that it does not 
seem to directly impact emicizumab’s potential to form the intrinsic tenase complex to increasingly 
generate thrombin. This proposed hypothesis is supported by the clinical observation which did not 
reveal any events of TE/TMA following use of rFVIIa, even in case of its use after these events. 
Although rFVIIa might not directly impact on the emicizumab’s triggered generation of thrombin, 
concomitant use of rFVIIa in a coagulation system maintained in a prothrombotic state while, in the 
event of acute bleeding, experiencing signal activation through endothelial damage, necessitating 
the need for additional use of rVFIIa still raises the concern of an increased risk of thromboembolic 
events. This has been extensively reflected in section 4.4 as well as in section 4.8 of the SmPC. In 
addition, educational materials for Healthcare Professionals, a patient alert card and a 
patient/Carer Guide have been developed as a risk minimisation measure. Finally, the concomitant 
use of rFVIIa is being followed through specific questionnaires as part of routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.  
Hence, the main safety concern is around the development of thromboembolic events (TEs) or 
thromboembolic microangiopathy (TMA), with 4 patients in study BH29884 who develop such AE (2 
patients each). It was considered to be related to concomitant use of bypassing agents (particularly 
aPCC). This is in addition to a further patient who experienced a SAE of TMA after the initial data 
cut-off. The applicant conducted a comprehensive review around the ADRs of TE and TMA and 
concluded that there is sufficient evidence to support a drug-drug interaction. Doses of aPCC ≥100 
U/kg over 24 hours were associated with an increased risk for developing TE and TMA, which was 
not observed with the use of rFVIIa only. The potential mechanism of action for the observed DDI 
is hypothesised to be mediated by a dose dependant increase in FIXa-emicizumab-FXa complex 
formations and excessive thrombin generation due to the inclusion of emicizumab’s substrates 
(e.g. FIX, FIXa, FX, and FXa) within aPCC. This is acknowledged. Risk mitigation measures were 
added as part of amendment 2 (i.e. after data-cut-off). No new events of TMA occurred following 
these risk mitigation measures, apart from one patient with an event of device occlusion (Grade 1), 
without receiving treatment with a bypassing agent, and not considered to be related to treatment, 
showing that there is an intrinsic risk for TE in patients with devices (e.g. catheters) in-situ. The 
fact that overall no new events of TMA or TE in conjunction with the use of bypassing agents, 
particularly aPCC, occurred is reassuring.  
Since implementation of the risk mitigation measures, no patients in study BH29884 received 
single infusions of aPCC doses ≥100 U/kg, which means all patients adhered to the SmPC posology 
recommendation of single doses. A substantial reduction in the number of infusions between 90-
270 µg/kg for rFVIIa after the risk mitigation measures were put in place (from 75.7% to 33.9% of 
all infusions) was observed. Importantly a more focused use of aPCC did not lead to an increase in 
proportion of patients reporting SAEs or serious haemorrhages. No additional AEs leading to 
withdrawal from treatment occurred after the clinical cut-off date for the primary analysis. 
Regarding the exclusion criteria of ‘patients at high risk of TMA’ the CHMP considered that  a) at 
the time of adding this as an exclusion criterion, there was limited understanding of these TMA 
events, which are now considered to be most likely related to a DDI, with adequate risk mitigation 
Assessment report

Page 107/126 
 
 
 
 
measures in place; with no patient having been excluded due to a high risk for TMA; b) based on 
current knowledge, patients with a previous medical history of TMA or those with hereditary 
predispositions to TMA, such as ADAMTS13 deficiency or complement pathway mutation, would not 
be expected to have increased susceptibility to TMA, as it is considered to be mediated by the 
drug-drug interaction between emicizumab and aPCC; c) patients would be precluded from 
resuming emicizumab treatment following complete resolution of a TMA event, even if a positive 
benefit-risk is still considered based on the prescribers judgment, bearing in mind that emicizumab 
will be administered by experienced haemophilia physicians. It was agreed to add a warning to 
Section 4.4 instead as indeed there is currently only paucity of evidence to support a 
contraindication. The need for a contraindication however should be regularly revisited through the 
PSUR updates.  
The incidence of detected ADAs in the patient population was low (4/189), with no apparent impact 
on efficacy and safety. The described incidence is based on Japanese patients with positive ADA 
from the extension study ACE002JP only. Updated immunogenicity data shows that no patient in 
the pivotal studies tested (i.e. at least one post-baseline assessment) were positive. The concerns 
around the appropriateness of the assays have overall been adequately addressed. A pragmatic 
approach is taken in light of the fact that development of clinically relevant ADA will likely effect 
efficacy and hence be recorded by clinicians by means of continuous monitoring of their patients. 
The statement proposed for Section 5.1 of the SmPC to consider immunogenicity in cases of loss of 
efficacy raises awareness around this issue and is considered sufficient to address a remaining 
uncertainty particularly around drug tolerance. Immunogenicity is also reflected in the RMP and 
recognised as important potential risk.  
Injection site reactions (ISRs) were reported very commonly from clinical trials. All ISRs observed 
in the Hemlibra clinical trials were reported as being non serious and generally mild to moderate in 
intensity. Most ISRs resolved without treatment. The most commonly reported ISR symptoms were 
injection site erythema (7.4 %), injection site pruritus (5.3%) and injection site pain (5.3%) 
(SmPC section 4.8).  
Safety data below patients age 1 are not available. In order to address the question to which 
extent the quantitatively different haemostatic system in neonates and infants may influence the 
haemostatic balance, consequently response to emicizumab as well as potentially impacting safety, 
e.g. increasing the risk for thromboembolic events (TE), the applicant described that haemostatic 
balance is maintained in an ‘equilibrium’ through concurrent reduction in levels of anti-coagulant 
proteins (Hanmod et al 2016). That the healthy newborn exists in a ‘haemostatic equilibrium’, 
neither prone to bleeding nor to clotting, supported by the observation that healthy infants 
typically do not suffer haemorrhagic or thrombotic complications spontaneously or in the presence 
of minor challenges. The imbalance of higher incidences of pro-thrombotic events (e.g. venous 
thromboembolism - VTE) described in the literature in this age group is thus not due to a ‘natural’ 
pro-thrombotic tendency, but considered to be associated with a higher risk of acquired 
predisposing maternal, neonatal and central venous catheter (CVC) related risk factors leading to 
the development of thrombotic events, of which many are unique to the perinatal period, such as 
pre-eclampsia, emergency C-section or perinatal asphyxia (Amankwah et al. 2014; Klaassen et al. 
2015; Haley 2017). If one looks at the complication of TE in the target population of neonates and 
infants with haemophilia and central venous access devices, it is generally a rare event (1%) 
(Kulkarni et al. 2009). But if occurring in context of the different risk factors described, TEs are in 
more than 90% considered CVC-related (van Ommen et al, 2001, van Ommen and Nowak-Goettl, 
2017). Overall, if it is agreed that a ‘haemostatic equilibrium’ possibly exists, the deficiencies of 
anticoagulant proteins in neonates and infants may still, potentially, predispose this group to a 
higher risk of thrombosis. It looks like this is however largely driven by different risk factors and 
Assessment report

prompted by an increased use of invasive procedures and catheter placement in small calibre 
vessels in such patients (Hanmod et al 2016). In context of emicizumab, the question then is to 
which extent do the potential predispositions influence a balanced response to emicizumab, i.e. 
emicizumab amplifying the risk for thromboembolic events. In this context, it is important to note 
that emicizumab is not pro−thrombotic and does not, itself, activate coagulation. It only accelerates 
the tenase reaction after FIX is activated by normal physiological or indeed pathophysiological 
processes; with the latter potentially triggering a TE event. Overall, a potential safety concern for 
this age group is, as for all age groups indeed the risk of thromboembolic events. The question to 
whether we have to assume an incidence difference in TEs in neonates and infants as compared to 
our source population is speculation and not part of the extrapolation exercise. Overall, it 
emphasises that the potential risks for this age group needs to be appreciated, but seen in context 
of the anticipated benefits (see Section 3 below). In order to inform prescribers regarding the 
absence of data in patients 0-1 year of age, and to mitigate any risks associated with it, the lack of 
(safety) data is now adequately reflected in Section 4.2 and data in neonates and infants are 
considered missing in the RMP. In addition, adequate warnings have been introduced in Section 4.4 
regarding the uncertainty around the deficiencies of anticoagulant proteins in neonates and infants 
which may, potentially, predispose this group to a higher risk of thrombosis in case of a CVC in 
situ, which should be appreciated when concluding on a patient’s individual benefit-risk. Additional 
safety data in patients < 2 years of age as part of the ongoing study BH29992 (PIP study) will be 
provided. 
To conclude, the additional safety data submitted after the data cut-off have shown no new safety 
concerns, with a safety profile considered to be tolerable down to the age of 1 year. The applicant 
showed that following the risk mitigations put in place addressing the potential for drug-drug 
interaction with aPCC, no new events of TMA and TE occurred. At the same time, no increases in 
SAEs or serious haemorrhages were seen. This is overall considered supportive of the risk 
mitigation measures proposed. The data are however limited and this risk remains, with adequate 
pharmacovigilance measures in place to follow this concern up in the post marketing setting i.e. 
through specific guided questionnaires which will be assessed as part of routine PSUR reporting as 
well as through a PASS based on the EUHASS registry. This is in addition to appropriate guidance 
being included into the SmPC regarding concomitant use of aPCC and warnings regarding patients 
with potential risk factors for development of TMA. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety data submitted after the data cut-off have shown no new safety concerns, with a safety 
profile considered to be tolerable down to the age of 1 year. The most common AEs related to 
nervous system disorders (19.0%, mainly headache), general disorders and administration site 
conditions (34.9%, mainly ISRs), thrombotic microangiopathy (1.4%), gastrointestinal disorders 
(21.7%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (19.6%, mainly arthralgia). 
The drug-drug interaction with bypassing agents, particularly aPCC leading to the ADRs of TE and 
TMA was a concern as part of the assessment. The applicant recognised and investigated the root 
cause for the DDI and implemented risk mitigation measures as part of the second amendment. 
Updated safety data show no new cases being observed with clinicians following the aPCC dosing 
recommendations. Extensive warnings have been included in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Additional risk minimisation measure include educational materials for health care professionals, 
patient alert card as well as patient/carer educational guide. The proposed pharmacovigilance 
measures will follow up on this issue, particularly with regards to adherence to dosing 
recommendation when using concomitant bypassing agents, as well as concerning the lack of data 
in neonates and infants. Additional data will come through specific guided questionnaires which will

be assessed as part of routine PSUR reporting as well as through a PASS based on the EUHASS

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant 
fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are 
set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant requested alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 16.11.2017. The new EURD list entry 
will therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that emicizumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product 
in the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by 
the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Hemlibra (emicizumab) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was 
not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 114/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification 
of new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant has applied for emicizumab to be indicated for prophylaxis to prevent bleeding in 
patients with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors, in patients of all age. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The current standard of care for treatment of bleeds in haemophilia A patients with inhibitors is 
treatment with bypassing agents (BPA). The two products available for this are:  
- 
- 
recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa, NovoSeven) and  
activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC, or factor eight inhibitors bypassing agent 
[FEIBA]).  
NovoSeven is indicated for episodic use only, while FEIBA is approved for episodic and prophylactic 
use in patients with high-responding inhibitors and frequent joint bleeding. 
BPAs are short-acting and may need to be administered often, with long IV infusion times and/or 
require frequent administration for prophylaxis. This is considered time-consuming and 
burdensome for patients with haemophilia A and their caregivers. Overall, there is an unmet 
medical need for new, more convenient, and efficacious treatment options for patients with 
haemophilia A with inhibitors.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Efficacy is based on one randomised control open label trial in patients age ≥12, with a total of 113 
patients enrolled, assigned to 4 different treatment arms based on prior treatment regimens with 
bypassing agents, allowing to compare bleed rates at 24 weeks between patients on episodic use 
of bypassing agents and those on emicizumab prophylaxis (53 patients randomised 1:2 - ITT 
population), as well as intra-patient comparison of patients previously treated with prophylactic 
bypassing regimens.  
This is supported by descriptive interim data of 60 patients from an ongoing single-arm, open label 
trial in children age <12 (data cut-off 08 May 2017). This is addition to 10 patients ≤2 years of age 
based on a separate later data cut-off (September 2017). 
Long term efficacy data are presented from 16 Japanese patients recruited into the Phase I 
extension trial ACE002JP. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Using the NB regression model to analyse the bleed rate for treated bleeds for the randomised 
population, there was a statistically significant 87% reduction in bleed rate with emicizumab 
Assessment report

prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis (Arm B ABR = 23.3; Arm A = 2.9; ABR ratio 0.13 [95% 
CI: 0.057; 0.277]; p < 0.0001 for stratified Wald test, confirmed by sensitivity analyses. 
The NB regression model analysis of all bleeds showed a statistically significant reduction (Arm B 
ABR = 28.3; Arm A = 0.8; ABR ratio = 5.5 [95% CI: 0.102;0.375]; p <0.0001 for stratified Wald 
test), confirmed by sensitivity analyses. 
The NB regression model analysis of treated joint bleeds showed a statistically significant 89% 
reduction in the bleed rate (treated bleeds) (Arm B ABR = 6.7; Arm A = 0.8; ABR ratio = 0.11 
[95% CI: 0.025; 0.520]; p <0.0050 for stratified Wald test). 
The NB analysis of treated target joint bleeds showed a statistically significant 95% reduction in 
the bleed rate (Arm B ABR = 3.0, Arm A ABR = 0.1; ABR ratio = 0.05 [95% CI: 0.009; 0.227]; p 
< 0.0002 for stratified Wald test). 
The NB regression analysis of treated spontaneous bleeds showed a statistically significant 92% 
reduction in the bleed rate (Arm B ABR = 16.8, Arm A ABR = 1.3; ABR ratio = 0.08 [95% CI: 
0.037; 0.154]; p < 0.0001 for stratified Wald test). 
The intra-patient comparison of bleed rates in Arm A and C showed a statistically significant 
reduction of ABR (Arm A NB analysis for patients with at least 12 weeks of treatment (Arm A NIS 
BR = 21.9; Arm A ABR = 1.8; ABR ratio = 0.08 [95% CI: 0.033;0.209], p < 0.0001; Arm C NB 
analysis for patients with at least 12 weeks of treatment (Arm C NIS ABR = 17.0; Arm C ABR = 
3.6; ABR ratio = 0.21 [0.090;0.488], p < 0.0003), confirmed by sensitivity analyses. 
The updated intra-patient comparison of bleeds rates in Arm C confirmed the above (ABR ratio 
treated bleeds 0.13; 95% CI: 0.059; 0.301; P-value (non-stratified Wald test) <0.0001; all bleeds 
ABR ratio 0.15; 95% CI: 0.078;0.299; P-value (non-stratified Wald test) <0.0001). 
All QoL measures indicated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There were no patient <1 years treated with Hemlibra (section 4.2 of the SmPC). The “use in 
neonate and infants” has been added as missing information in the RMP. The model used for PK 
extrapolation in children less than 1 year is not reflecting the most optimum fit. This is however 
considered acceptable as additional safety data in patients < 2 years of age will be provided as part 
of the ongoing study BH29992 (PIP study).  
Efficacy data in situations of major surgery are missing; this has been appropriately reflected in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
Long term data were provided with the extension study ACE002JP, conducted in Japan which 
enrolled patients with and without inhibitors using a different maintenance dosing regimen (0.3, 1, 
and 3 mg/kg/week). It calculated individual patient ABRs but did not estimate population rates 
based on the NB regression model.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common AEs related to nervous system disorders (19.0%, mainly headache), general 
disorders and administration site conditions (34.9%, mainly ISRs), thrombotic microangiopathy 
(1.4%), gastrointestinal disorders (21.7%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
(19.6%, mainly arthralgia). 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 117/126 
 
 
 
 
The main safety risks relate to thromboembolic events and thrombotic microangiopathy revealed 
by two cases of thromboembolic events and three of thrombotic microangiopathy while on 
emicizumab, related to concomitant use of bypassing agents, particularly aPCC which is considered 
to be a drug-drug interaction. The applicant recognised and investigated the root cause for the 
drug-drug interactions and implemented risk mitigation measures as part of the second 
amendment of the clinical trial protocol. Updated safety data show no new cases being observed 
with clinicians following the aPCC dosing recommendations. Extensive warnings have been included 
in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. Additional risk minimisation measure include educational 
materials for health care professionals, patient alert card as well as patient/carer educational 
guide. In addition, the proposed pharmacovigilance measures will follow up on this issue, 
particularly with regards to the adherence to dosing recommendation when using concomitant 
bypassing agents, as well as concerning the lack of data in neonates and infants. Additional data 
will come through specific guided questionnaires which will be assessed as part of routine PSUR 
reporting as well as through a PASS based on the EUHASS registry. Additional safety data in 
patients < 2 years of age as part of the ongoing study BH29992 (PIP study) will be provided.  
Injection site reactions in 18.5% of all patients, although as stated in section in 4.8 of the SmPC, 
most of the injection site reactions resolved without treatment.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
It is not sure that the long term effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures implemented to 
address issue of drug-drug interaction with concomitant use of bypassing agents will be successful. 
A PASS based on the HCP and patient/carer survey will be performed to address this issue as part 
of the RMP.  
The pathophysiology behind thrombotic microangiopathy is considered to be potentially related to 
concomitant use of aPCC but this has not been fully elucidated.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treatment of bleeds in patients with haemophilia A who developed inhibitors are limited and 
confined to the use of bypassing agents.  
Overall the observed effect size is consistent, showing reduction of all bleed related endpoints, 
including joint bleeds, hence reducing any potential subsequent clinical damage. This together with 
the QoL measures can be considered clinically meaningful.  
Inclusion of patients 0-1 years of age based on full extrapolation is considered acceptable, with a 
positive benefit-risk assumed. 
The safety profile of emicizumab is considered tolerable, mainly consisting of injection site 
reactions, pyrexia and headache. The updated safety data submitted were in line with these 
observations and did not indicate any additional new safety concerns.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall efficacy has been shown in patients ≥ 1 year of age, with the lack of data in patients 0-1 
year of age addressed through an extrapolation exercise. The safety profile of emicizumab, mainly 
consisting of injection site reactions, pyrexia and headache is considered as tolerable. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 121/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
identified risks of thrombotic microangiopathy and thromboembolic event are adequately addressed 
by means of the SmPC and within the RMP.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Hemlibra is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Hemlibra is favourable in the following indication: 
Hemlibra is indicated for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A 
with factor VIII inhibitors. 
Hemlibra can be used in all age groups. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are 
set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-
portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this 
product within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 122/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile 
or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Hemlibra in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must 
agree about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication 
media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National 
Competent Authority.  
The educational programme is aimed at increasing communication and medical and patient 
education around the important identified risks of thromboembolic events and thrombotic 
microangiopathy associated with the concomitant use of emicizumab and activated prothrombin 
complex concentrate (aPCC), and the important potential risk of life-threatening bleeding due to 
misinterpretation of the standard coagulation tests (unreliable in patients treated with emicizumab) 
and provide information on how to manage them. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Hemlibra is marketed, all healthcare 
professionals, patients/carers who are expected to prescribe, dispense or use Hemlibra, and 
laboratory professionals, have access to/are provided with the following educational package: 
•  Physician educational material 
•  Patient/Carer educational material 
•  Laboratory professionals educational material 
The physician educational material should contain: 
o  The Summary of Product Characteristics  
o  Guide for healthcare professionals 
o  Patient alert card 
•  The guide for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements: 
o  Brief introduction to emicizumab (chemical class, mode of action, 
pharmacodynamics and indication) 
o  Relevant information (e.g. seriousness, severity, frequency, time to onset, 
reversibility as applicable) of the following safety concerns associated with the use 
of Hemlibra: 
 
 
thromboembolic events associated with the concomitant use of emicizumab 
and activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC),  
thrombotic microangiopathy associated with the concomitant use of 
emicizumab and aPCC 
Assessment report  
EMA/88475/2018  
Page 123/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 life-threatening bleeding due to misinterpretation of the standard 
coagulation tests (unreliable in patients treated with emicizumab)  
o  Guidance on the use of bypassing agents concomitantly with emicizumab, including 
the following information: 
 
 
 
 
Treatment with prophylactic bypassing agents should be discontinued the 
day before starting emicizumab therapy; 
Physicians should discuss with all patients and/or caregivers the exact dose 
and schedule of bypassing agents to use, if required while receiving 
emicizumab prophylaxis; 
Emicizumab increases the patient’s coagulation potential and the dose and 
duration of treatment with bypassing agents may require adjustment 
depending on the location and extent of bleeding and on the patient’s 
clinical conditions; 
For all coagulation agents (aPCC, rFVIIa, FVIII, etc.), consideration should 
be given to verifying bleeds prior to repeated dosing; 
  Use of aPCC should be avoided unless no other treatment 
options/alternatives are available and aPCC dosing recommendations in 
case aPCC is the only option. 
 
Treating physicians must carefully weigh the risk of TMA and 
thromboembolism against the risk of bleeding when considering aPCC 
treatment. 
o 
o 
o 
Information on emicizumab’s interference with certain laboratory coagulation tests 
which will affect their reliability in the emicizumab setting and warning that these 
tests should not be used to monitor for emicizumab activity, determine need for 
factor replacement dosing, or measure FVIII inhibitors.  
Information on assays and methods not affected by emicizumab that may be used 
to monitor coagulation parameters during treatment, with specific considerations 
for FVIII chromogenic activity assays; 
Listing of laboratory tests unaffected by emicizumab; 
o  Reminder that all patients receiving treatment with emicizumab should be given a 
Patient Alert Card and reminded to carry it at all times and show it to any 
healthcare professionals who may treat them and to laboratory professionals that 
will perform their coagulation testing; 
o  Reminder to report any adverse events associated with the use of emicizumab. 
•  The patient alert card shall contain the following key messages:  
o 
o 
Instructions for patients to carry the card at any time, including in conditions of

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that emicizumab is a new 
active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0196/2016 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

This application is to extend the indication of Firmagon (Degarelix) to include the treatment of adult male 
patients with high-risk localized and locally advanced hormone dependent prostate cancer in combination 
with radiotherapy and as neo-adjuvant treatment prior to radiotherapy in patients with high-risk localised 
or locally advanced prostate cancer.  High-risk prostate cancer is defined by the European Association of 
Urology (EAU) as for Table 1 below.   
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
Firmagon is already indicated for treatment of adult male patients with advanced hormone-dependent 
prostate cancer. 
The new wording of the indication is as follow:

FIRMAGON is a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonist indicated for treatment of adult male 
patients with advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer 
FIRMAGON is indicated for the treatment of hormone dependent advanced prostate cancer and for the 
treatment of high-risk localized and locally advanced hormone dependent prostate cancer in combination 
with radiotherapy. 
FIRMAGON is indicated as neo-adjuvant treatment prior to radiotherapy in patients with high-risk 
localized or locally advanced prostate cancer 
Epidemiology  
Worldwide, prostate cancer ranks second in cancer incidence and fifth in cancer mortality in men (Bray et 
al, 2018). In Europe, the estimated number of new prostate cancer cases was approximately 473,344 in 
2020 and the number of deaths was approximately 108,088 in 2020 (GLOBOCAN, 2020).  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis  
Prostate cancer may present as localised disease, locally advanced disease or metastatic disease at initial 
diagnosis. Locally advanced prostate cancer represents a subpopulation of advanced prostate cancer, 
described as prostate cancer that has spread through the prostatic capsule to involve tissues and 
structures adjacent to the prostate gland, including regional lymph nodes, the urinary bladder and 
seminal vesicles, but not nodes and organs distant to the pelvis. In contrast, localised prostate cancer 
describes a condition where the neoplasm is confined within the prostate gland itself and where the 
prostatic capsule has not been breached by the tumour.  
High-risk prostate cancer includes locally advanced prostate cancer (T3–4 N0-X M0) and high-risk 
localised prostate cancer (T2c N0-X M0) with either a Gleason score >7 and/or a baseline PSA of >20 
ng/ml Table 1. According to the European Association of Urology (EAU), high risk prostate cancer means 
an increased risk of PSA failure, need for secondary therapy, metastatic progression and death from 
prostate cancer. 
Table 1 EAU risk group for biochemical recurrence of localised and locally advanced prostate cancer  
Management 
There is no consensus regarding optimum management of high-risk localised prostate cancer (EAU, 
ESMO). However, radiotherapy associated with long-term androgen deprivation therapy is a rated 
recommendation for high risk localised disease. 
Assessment report  
EMA/613173/2021 
Page 7/50 EMA/613173/202  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In locally advanced disease recommend treatments are neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy 
(ADT)+ radical radiotherapy + adjuvant ADT (European Society of Medical Oncology ESMO) or external-
beam radiation therapy in combination with long term androgen deprivation therapy (EAU). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Degarelix (FIRMAGON) is third-generation gonadotropin releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonist that 
competitively and reversibly binds to the pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors 
rapidly reducing the release of the gonadotrophins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH), and thereby reducing the secretion of testosterone by the testes. 
Unlike GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists do not induce a LH surge with subsequent testosterone 
surge/tumour stimulation and potential symptomatic flare after the initiation of treatment. 
The current indication of FIRMAGON is for treatment of adult male patients with advanced hormone-
dependent prostate cancer at a posology of 240 mg administered subcutaneously (sc) as starting dose 
followed by 80 mg sc monthly for maintenance. 
The MA has been granted in Europe since February 2009.  
Clinical results were mainly coming from a phase 3 study (Study FE 200486 CS21), an open-label, multi-
centre, randomised, active comparator controlled, parallel-group phase III study. This study investigated 
the efficacy and safety of two different degarelix monthly dosing regimens with a starting dose of 240 mg 
followed by monthly sc administration of 160 mg or 80 mg, in comparison to monthly Intramuscular 
administration of 7.5 mg leuprorelin in patients with prostate cancer requiring androgen deprivation 
therapy. Degarelix was considered effective in achieving testosterone suppression below the medical 
castration level of 0.5 ng/ml. 
The proposed dose for the claimed new indications remains unchanged. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH did not seek scientific advice. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP 
The current application is based only on literature review. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.  
The MAH has provided literature data supporting the mechanism of synergy between androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) and radiation.

2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In the Environmental risk Assessment of degarelix (ERA) the market penetration factor, Fpen, was 
calculated based on information of patients with prostate cancer. The highest refined Fpen was that of 
Sweden and was calculated to be 0.25%. 
As the two indications of this application concern a subset of prostate cancer patients eligible for 
treatment with Degarelix, a Fpen of 0.25% is applicable. 
Furthermore, as the dosing route (sc), the starting dose of 240 mg/inh and the monthly maintenance 
dose of 80 mg/inh remain unchanged for the two indications, the predicted environmental concentrations 
are not regarded subject to change. 
Considering the above data, degarelix is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Not applicable as no relevant new data were provided 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new/extended indication does not lead to a 
significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of degarelix.  
Considering the above data, degarelix is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction

2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Not Applicable  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
This extension of indication is justified based on:   
1) the recommendations of ESMO, EAU and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines 
2020 for androgen suppression in patients with high-risk prostate cancer. 
2) the mechanism of action of the androgen suppression by LHRH antagonist compared to LHRH agonist 
Although the initial effect of LHRH agonists and antagonists is different, the downstream effect of both 
treatments is to decrease testosterone level.  
3) the non-inferiority of degarelix vs a LHRH agonist on suppression of testosterone which already has 
been assessed in the initial MAA (see SmPC 5.1 and CS21, Klotz et al.). This study was designed to 
compare the efficacy and safety of degarelix versus leuprorelin in achieving and maintaining testosterone 
suppression in a 1-year trial involving patients with all stages prostate cancer. Among the patients 
included, an average of 1/3 had localized disease and 1/3 had locally advanced disease in each group.  
4) the marketing authorization of LHRH agonists with the claimed indications presented below. 
PAMORELIN LA® (triptorelin) DE/H/0566/001  
PAMORELIN LA 22.5 mg is indicated in the treatment of high-risk localised or locally advanced hormone-
dependent prostate cancer in combination with radiotherapy.  
In section 4.2, it is specified that in high-risk localised or ‘locally advanced hormone-dependent prostate 
cancer as concomitant to and following radiation therapy’ clinical data have shown that radiotherapy 
followed by long-term androgen deprivation therapy is preferable to radiotherapy followed by short-term 
androgen deprivation therapy.

ELIGARD is indicated for the treatment of hormone dependent advanced prostate cancer and for the 
treatment of high-risk localized and locally advanced hormone dependent prostate cancer in combination 
with radiotherapy. ELIGARD 22.5 mg may be used as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy in combination 
with radiotherapy in high-risk localized and locally advanced prostate cancer. 
GOSERELIN ALVOGEN® (goserelin) PT/H/1276/001 
GOSERELIN ALVOGEN is indicated as adjuvant treatment to radiotherapy in patients with high-risk 
localised or locally advanced prostate cancer where goserelin has demonstrated improved disease-free 
survival and overall survival (see section 5.1). 
As neo-adjuvant treatment prior to radiotherapy in patients with high-risk localised or locally advanced 
prostate cancer where goserelin has demonstrated improved disease-free survival. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies)

The key exclusion criteria were previous or current hormonal treatment for prostate cancer (surgical 
castration or other hormonal manipulation, including LHRH receptor agonists, LHRH receptor antagonists, 
anti-androgens, estrogens, megestrol acetate, and ketoconazole). 
Patients having undergone prostatectomy, radiotherapy or cryotherapy with curative intention 
neoadjuvant/adjuvant hormonal therapy for a maximum duration of 6 months was accepted if this 
treatment had been terminated at least 6 months prior to the screening visit. Other key exclusion criteria 
were history of any serious or significant health condition, undergoing treatment with 5-alpha reductase 
inhibitor and/or treatment with any investigational drug within 28 days before enrolling into the study. 
Treatments 
Patients received a once-a-month treatment with degarelix or goserelin with 28-day intervals between 
injections. Degarelix was administered as a deep subcutaneous (sc) injection in the abdominal region, at 
a starting dose of 240 mg (40 mg/mL) at Day 0, followed by 12 monthly (28- day intervals) maintenance 
doses of 80 mg (20 mg/mL). 
Goserelin (Zoladex 3.6 mg) was administered sc into the anterior abdominal wall as 12 monthly (28-day 
intervals) doses. Patients could also receive anti-androgen treatment, bicalutamide 50 mg/day, starting 
with the first goserelin dose, and for a maximum of 28 days as flare protection, at the discretion of the 
investigator 
Objectives 
To establish non-inferiority of degarelix compared with goserelin in suppressing and maintaining castrate 
testosterone levels from Day 28 to Day 364 in Chinese patients with prostate cancer. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the study was the difference in the cumulative probability of testosterone at 
castrate level (≤0.5 ng/mL) from Day 28 to Day 364 between patients treated with the degarelix and 
goserelin. Secondary endpoints were cumulative probabilities of testosterone at castrate level from Day 
56 to Day 364, no PSA failure, PSA-progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), and PFS. PSA failure was defined 
as two consecutive assessments at least 2 weeks apart with an increase of 50% and at least 5 ng/mL 
increase compared to nadir. PSA-PFS was defined as PSA failure or death from any cause, whichever is 
first. PFS was defined as PSA failure, death from any cause, or introduction of additional therapy related 
to prostate cancer, whichever is first. Also evaluated was proportion of patients with testosterone levels 
_0.5 ng/mL at Day 3, and at each subsequent visit, serum levels of testosterone and PSA over time; and 
percentage change in PSA from baseline to Day 28. Changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
were measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and 
lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were measured by International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). 
Safety was evaluated by recording adverse events (AEs), and other laboratory parameters. The AEs were 
presented by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. 
Sample size 
Of the 322 patients screened, 285 patients were randomized  (143: Degarelix; 142: Goserelin, ITT 
analysis set), and 239 patients completed the study (123: Degarelix; 116: Goserelin).

Randomisation 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to either degarelix or goserelin, stratified by the use of 5-alpha reductase 
inhibitors in the previous 12 months. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable, this was an open-label trial. 
Statistical methods 
Primary endpoint: 
The 1-year cumulative probability of testosterone levels below castrate level (≤0.5 ng/mL) was estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method using testosterone measurements every 4 weeks (at Day 28 to Day 
364). The standard error (SE) of the mean of this estimate was based on Greenwood’s formula. The two-
sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the suppression probability was based on the log-log 
transformation, Greenwood’s formula, and asymptotic maximum likelihood theory. The two-sided 95% CI 
of the difference between degarelix and goserelin in cumulative suppression rate probabilities from Day 
28 to Day 364 was constructed using the pooled SEs. If the lower limit of this CI was >-10%, the non-
inferiority of degarelix to goserelin was confirmed. However, if the lower limit of this CI was >0%, 
superiority could have been declared. In case of failure to calculate the CIs and SEs while achieving a 0% 
or a 100% response rate, CIs were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson interval, (0, 3.69/N) for 0% 
observed responders, and (1-3.69/N, 1) for 100% responders, where N is the number of completers and 
3.69=- lnα=2 with α=0.05. When estimating the SE of the KM estimate in the case of a 0% or a 100% 
response, the SE of the mean of the KM estimate was set to 1/2 x3/N, where 3/N corresponds to the one-
sided 95% Clopper-Pearson CI with a 0% or 100% response. 
Secondary endpoints: 
The median percentage change from baseline to Day 28 in PSA was presented for both treatment groups, 
and comparisons between the treatment groups were made using the Wilcoxon test (α=0.05, two-sided). 
Cumulative probabilities of no PSA failure, PSA-PFS and PFS were also estimated using the KM method. 
Categorical data were summarized as counts and percentages, while descriptive statistics were presented 
for continuous data; the data were tabulated by treatment group and visit. For laboratory efficacy 
parameters (testosterone and PSA) with reported values below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), a 
value of 1/2 LLOQ was used in the calculations. Drop-outs were accounted for by the KM approach, as 
censored observations. Drop-outs were censored at the time of their last testosterone assessment; 
missing values after Day 28 were imputed as ≤0.5 ng/mL provided all other testosterone assessment 
were less than 0.5 ng/mL, including missing values at Day 364. If one or both values before and after the 
missing value was greater than 0.5 ng/mL, the patient was considered an endpoint failure at the first 
assessment above 0.5 ng/mL. 
For the secondary endpoints related to PSA, there was an additional analyses according to whether or not 
the patient was previously treated with a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor. The KM analysis of cumulative 
probability of no PSA failure was performed for the subgroups defined by the previous inhibitor use.

Baseline data 
Numbers analysed 
The number of patients analysed for efficacy in the ITT population were 143 for degarelix and 142 
patients for goserelin ± bicalutamide. 
The number of patients included in the Safety analysis set were 142 for degarelix and 141 patients for 
goserelin ± bicalutamide. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Degarelix was non-inferior to goserelin in achieving and maintaining serum testosterone suppression at 
castrate levels from Day 28 to Day 364 Figure 1. The difference between the two treatment groups was 
3.6% (95% CI: -1.5%, 8.7%), and the lower limit of the CI (for the difference in probability) was higher 
than the pre-defined threshold of >-10%.

Figure 1 Cumulative probability of testosterone at castrate level (≤0.5ng/mL) from Day 28 to Day 364. 
The individual cumulative probabilities of maintaining castrate testosterone levels over a period of 1 year 
was 97.0% (95% CI: 92.3%, 98.9%) for degarelix and 93.4% (95% CI: 87.7%, 96.5%) for goserelin. 
The sensitivity analysis in patients who did not receive a previous treatment with 5-alpha reductase 
inhibitor demonstrated non-inferiority of degarelix to goserelin. However, in the subgroup previously 
treated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, the point estimate of the difference in suppression rates was -
4.5%, but due to the low number of patients (n=40), non-inferiority could not be demonstrated. The 
cumulative probability of achieving and maintaining serum testosterone suppression at castrate levels 
from Day 56 to Day 364 was also comparable between degarelix and goserelin (97.0% [95% CI: 92.3%, 
98.9%] and 95.5% [95% CI: 90.2%, 97.9%], respectively). 
Testosterone levels were rapidly suppressed to castrate levels with degarelix (0.25 ng/mL) at Day 3 
compared with goserelin (p<0.0001), and 96% of patients achieved castrate levels of testosterone in the 
degarelix group compared to none in the goserelin group (p<0.0001). The time concentration curve of 
testosterone with respect to degarelix and goserelin is presented in Figure 2. In the goserelin group, 
there was a 53% increase in the testosterone levels from the baseline to Day 3 (4.58 ng/mL and 7.31 
ng/mL). After Day 3, the proportion of patients achieving testosterone castrate levels was similar in both 
groups, though median testosterone levels were higher in the goserelin group as compared with the 
degarelix group (0.05 ng/mL [range, 0.05-0.38 ng/mL] and 0.112 ng/mL [range, 0.05-9.92 ng/mL], 
respectively). Median levels of testosterone remained suppressed for both degarelix and goserelin groups 
until the end of the study on Day 364. Similar results were observed in the PP analysis set.

Treatment with degarelix resulted in a rapid and more profound PSA suppression from baseline to Day 3 
versus goserelin group (22.20% versus 8.65% reduction in PSA). 
By Day 28, the treatment groups had a 91% reduction from baseline in PSA levels, which continued to be 
similar throughout the treatment period in the two treatment groups Figure 3. A previous treatment/no 
treatment with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor did not impact the PSA reduction. PSA failure occurred more 
frequently in patients with a high PSA level at baseline, and those with metastatic disease. On the other 
hand, patients previously treated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor had a lower PSA failure rate. The 
cumulative probability of PSA-PFS at Day 364 was significantly higher for degarelix as compared with 
goserelin (p=0.038). 
Furthermore, the cumulative probability of PFS showed a favourable trend for degarelix in terms of 
disease control Table 3.

Study participants 
Main inclusion criteria included prostate cancer TNM category T2b-T4, N0, M0, Gleason score ≥7, or PSA 
≥10 ng/ml; total prostate volume (TPV) >30 ml; scheduled to undergo radical radiotherapy treatment and 
in whom neoadjuvant ADT was indicated. 
Major exclusion criteria included treatment for prostate cancer or transurethral resection of the prostate; 
use of a urethral catheter; treatment with a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (finasteride or dutasteride) in the 
past 12 and 16 weeks, respectively; or treatment with an alpha-adrenoceptor blocker in the past 4 
weeks. 
Treatments 
In the degarelix group, a starting dose of 240 mg (40 mg/ml) was given on day 0. The second and third 
doses (maintenance doses) of 80 mg (20 mg/ml) were given on days 28 and 56, respectively.  
In the control arm, once-daily treatment with bicalutamide 50 mg as anti-androgen flare protection was 
initiated on day 0 and this treatment continued for 17 days. On day 3, the first goserelin implant (3.6 mg) 
was administered and the second and third doses were given on days 31 and 59, respectively. 
Objectives and Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary objective was to demonstrate that the mean percentage reduction in prostate volume with 
degarelix is non-inferior to goserelin plus bicalutamide, based on Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) at 12 weeks 
compared to baseline. Secondary objectives included the effect on lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) 
relief, changes of quality of life related to urinary symptoms, testosterone control, PSA control, oestradiol 
levels, safety of degarelix and goserelin plus bicalutamide treatments. 
The primary endpoint was the mean percentage reduction in prostate volume at 12 weeks as compared 
to baseline. Secondary endpoints were: reduction in IPSS from baseline at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, change in 
serum testosterone concentration at 4, 8, and 12 weeks as compared to baseline, change in serum PSA 
concentration at 4, 8, and 12 weeks as compared to baseline, change in serum oestradiol concentration 
at 4, 8, and 12 weeks as compared to baseline, quality of life evaluation at 4, 8, and 12 weeks compared 
to baseline. 
Sample size 
The number of patients was 240, 160 in degarelix arm and n=80 in goserelin arm 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive treatment with degarelix or goserelin for 12 
weeks

Statistical methods 
Patients who received at least one dose of the investigational drug and had at least one efficacy 
assessment were included in the full analysis set (FAS). The per-protocol population was obtained by

excluding patients who fulfilled any pre-set criteria for exclusion from the per-protocol analysis set. The 
primary efficacy measure was the mean percentage reduction in TPV from baseline at week 12. 
Changes were analyzed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for both the FAS and per-protocol 
populations. Non inferiority was established if the treatment difference in adjusted mean percentage 
reduction was significantly greater than Δ=-10 points in both the FAS and per-protocol analysis sets (two-
sided at α= 0.05 level). Changes in IPSS from baseline were analysed by ANCOVA. Changes in quality of 
life due to urinary symptoms were analyzed by polytomous regression. In total, 228 (171 degarelix and 
57 goserelin) patients were required in order to show non-inferiority with 90% probability (assuming a 
standard deviation of the change from baseline of 20 percentage points at week 12). An additional 5% of 
anticipated protocol violators were added to arrive at the total of 240 patients.

The FAS population was of 180 patients in degarelix group and of 64 patients in goserelin+bicalutamide 
group while PP population was of 164 patients in degarelix group and of 57 patients in 
goserelin+bicalutamide group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Mean Percentage Change in Total Prostate Volume (TPV)  
TPV decreased significantly from baseline to week 12 in both treatment groups with mean (± standard 
deviation) percentage changes of -36.0 ± 14.5% and -35.3 ± 16.7% for degarelix and goserelin, 
respectively, for the FAS and -36.2 ±14.5% and -35.4 ±16.9% for degarelix and goserelin, respectively, 
for the per-protocol analysis set Figure 4.

The adjusted differences between treatment groups were -0.3% (95% confidence interval -4.74; 4.14%) 
for the FAS and -0.27% (95% confidence interval -5.05; 4.52%) for the per-protocol analysis set. The 
upper limits of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the adjusted mean differences were thus below 
the non-inferiority margin of 10, and non-inferiority was considered to have been established.

Changes from Baseline in Serum Testosterone and Prostate specific Antigen 
The median levels of serum testosterone showed no differences between degarelix- and goserelin-treated 
patients during the trial Figure 5. The median level of testosterone for degarelix-treated patients at weeks 
4, 8 and 12 was 0.05 ng/ml and the corresponding figures for goserelin were 0.17, 0.05 and 0.05 ng/ml, 
respectively. 
Overall, there were seven of 180 and five patients of 64 on degarelix and goserelin, respectively, with a 
serum testosterone level >0.5 ng/ml on at least one occasion. The estimated cumulative probabilities of

testosterone <0.5 ng/ ml between days 28 and 84 were 96% for the degarelix treatment group and 92% 
for the goserelin treatment group. 
The median percentage changes in PSA were also comparable; for degarelix the decreases from baseline 
at weeks 4, 8 and 12 were -71.6, -84.8 and -89.2%, respectively, whereas for goserelin they were -72.2, 
-93.1 and -93.0% Figure 5.

Changes from Baseline in International Prostate Symptom Score 
About 50% of patients had no to mild lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), about 40% had moderate 
and 10% had severe LUTS at baseline. In patients with moderate LUTS at baseline, the mean IPSS 
(±standard error of the mean) decreased clinically meaningfully (-2.99 ± 0.68, n = 72) in degarelix-treated 
patients by week 12, whereas it remained virtually unchanged in goserelin-treated patients (-0.48 ±1.29, 
n = 23, P = 0.06). 
In patients with severe LUTS at baseline, the mean IPSS changes from baseline to week 12 were 
numerically larger in degarelix-treated patients (-6.84 ±1.31, n = 19) compared with goserelin-treated 
patients (-3.50 ± 3.18, n = 6), but differences did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.21). Similarly, 
when focusing on patients with a baseline IPSS ≥13 (a commonly used threshold in clinical trials on LUTS 
management), degarelix elicited more pronounced LUTS relief compared with goserelin (-6.04 ± 0.79, n = 
53 versus -3.41 ±1.23, n = 17; P = 0.06). In the total population, 37% of patients in the degarelix group 
and 27% in the goserelin group experienced clinically meaningful IPSS decreases of at least three points 
(P = 0.06). 
The mean change (± standard error of the mean) from baseline in IPSS was larger in the degarelix group 
compared with the goserelin group at weeks 8 (-1.53 ± 0.41, n = 178 versus 0.016 ± 0.68, n = 63) and 12 
(-1.71 ±0.42, n = 178 versus 0.11±0.65, n=63). At week12, the adjusted (for baseline IPSS) difference 
between degarelix and goserelin was statistically significant (-1.42 [-2.81; -0.035], P = 0.044) Figure 6.

Change from Baseline in Quality of Life due to Urinary Symptoms 
The relative increases in the reporting of ‘delighted’ or ‘pleased’ from baseline to week 12 were greater in 
the degarelix-treated patients compared with goserelin-treated patients (31% versus -3%) and the 
relative decreases in the reporting of ‘unhappy’/’terrible’ from baseline to week 12 were also greater in 
the degarelix-treated patients compared with goserelin-treated patients (-37% versus 14%). However, 
the numerical differences did not reach statistical significance.

Treatments 
Registered LHRH antagonist, degarelix, will be given at the dose of 240 mg given as two subcutaneous 
injections of 120 mg at a concentration of 40 mg/mL on day 1, followed by 80 mg given as one 
subcutaneous injection at a concentration of 20 mg/mL every 28 days (±2 days). 
External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to a total dose of 78-80 Gy, delivered as one daily fraction, five days 
a week, started between d1 and months 6 of the androgen deprivation therapy as per institution policy. 
The irradiation was the same as in the reference therapy arm. 
The minimum duration of androgen deprivation with LHRH agonist or antagonist therapy was 18 months. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the trial is to assess if LHRH antagonists in combination with external beam 
radiation therapy improve progression free survival (progression that can be biological, clinical, or death) 
compared to LHRH agonists in combination with external beam radiation therapy. 
Secondary objectives include:’ 
-documentation of effect of LHRH antagonists on clinically significant cardiovascular events in the 
subgroup of patients at high risk of such events at baseline; 
-documentation of side effects and quality of life, I-PSS and urinary tract infections; 
-assessment of relative treatment effect on secondary efficacy endpoints (clinical progression, time to 
next line of systemic therapy, time on therapy, overall and cancer specific survival) and on PSA at 6 
months after end of RT. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Outcome Measures:

Supportive studies 
Three studies assessing LHRH agonist in the neoadjuvant setting, 4 studies assessing LHRH agonist in the 
adjuvant setting and further two studies (McLeod D et al. 2001 and Trachtenberg J, et al. 2002) 
assessing a LHRH antagonist (abarelix) compared to a LHRH agonist were presented in support of the 
claimed indications.  
Studies assessing LHRH agonists in the Neoadjuvant setting 
Neoadjuvant setting indication claim is supported by the clinical trial CS30 described in section 2.4.2. and 
on three clinical trials: RTOG 86-10, TROG 96.01 and RTOG 94-08 which are described below.

RTOG 86-10:  Phase III radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) Trial 86-10 of androgen deprivation 
adjuvant to definitive radiotherapy in locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate. Pilepich M.; et. al. Int. J. 
Radiation Oncology Biol. Phys 2001; 50: 1243-1252 
RTOG 86-10 (Pilepich et al.) was a phase III randomized study to assess 16 weeks treatment with 
goserelin+ flutamide starting 2 months before radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in patients with 
clinical stage T2-T4 i.e. patients with localized disease. The primary end point of the study was 
locoregional control; secondary end points were disease-free survival (freedom from progression) and 
survival.After a median follow-up of 6.7 years, the short-term ADT plus radiotherapy combination was 
associated with improved local control, reduced incidence of distant metastases, improved disease-free 
survival, and reduced cause-specific mortality. The 10-year results showed that the addition of ADT 
induced a significant improvement in the 10-year disease-specific mortality (23% versus 36%; p=0.01), 
disease free survival (11% versus 3%; p<0.0001), and biochemical failure (65% versus 80%; 
p<0.0001). 
TROG 96.01:  Short-term neoadjuvant androgen deprivation and radiotherapy for locally advanced prostate 
cancer: 10-year data from the TROG 96.01 randomised trial; Denham J, et.al.; The Lancet oncology 2011; 
12: 451-459 
This is a phase III randomized controlled trial to determine whether 3 months or 6 months of androgen 
deprivation given before and during radiotherapy improves outcomes for patients with locally advanced 
prostate cancer. Throughout this study 818 men with locally advanced prostate cancer were randomly 
assigned to no androgen deprivation 3 months’ androgen deprivation with 3,6 mg Goserelin or 6 months’ 
androgen deprivation, with the same regimen. 
The following results have been published in the literature: 
“802 men were eligible for analysis (270 in the radiotherapy alone group, 265 in the 3-month 
neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (NADT) group, and 267 in the 6-month NADT group) after a 
median follow-up of 10·6 years (IQR 6·9–11·6). Compared with radiotherapy alone, 3 months of NADT 
decreased the cumulative incidence of PSA progression (adjusted hazard ratio 0·72, 95% CI 0·57–0·90; 
p=0·003) and local progression (0·49, 0·33–0·73; p=0·0005), and improved event-free survival (0·63, 
0·52–0·77; p<0·0001). 6 months of NADT further reduced PSA progression (0·57, 0·46–0·72; p<0·0001) 
and local progression (0·45, 0·30–0·66; p=0·0001), and led to a greater improvement in event-free 
survival (0·51, 0·42–0·61, p<0·0001), compared with radiotherapy alone. 3-month NADT had no effect 
on distant progression (0·89, 0·60–1·31; p=0·550), prostate cancer-specific mortality (0·86, 0·60–1·23; 
p=0·398), or all-cause mortality (0·84, 0·65–1·08; p=0·180), compared with radiotherapy alone. By 
contrast, 6-month NADT decreased distant progression (0·49, 0·31–0·76; p=0·001), prostate cancer-
specific mortality (0·49, 0·32–0·74; p=0·0008), and all-cause mortality (0·63, 0·48–0·83; p=0·0008), 
compared with radiotherapy alone. Treatment-related morbidity was not increased with NADT within the 
first 5 years after randomisation.”

et.al.  N Engl. J Med 2011; 365: 107-118 
This is a phase III, randomized study in localized prostate cancer patients with low TNM staging. From 
1994 through 2001, 1979 eligible patients with stage T1b, T1c, T2a, or T2b prostate adenocarcinoma and 
a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 20 ng per milliliter or less were randomized to radiotherapy

alone (992 patients) or radiotherapy with 4 months of total androgen suppression starting 2 months 
before radiotherapy (radiotherapy plus short-term ADT, 987 patients). 
The following results have been published in the literature: 
“The median follow-up period was 9.1 years. The 10-year rate of overall survival was 62% among patients 
receiving radiotherapy plus short-term ADT (the combined-therapy group), as compared with 57% among 
patients receiving radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for death with radiotherapy alone, 1.17; P=0.03). The 
addition of short-term ADT was associated with a decrease in the 10-year disease-specific mortality from 
8% to 4% (hazard ratio for radiotherapy alone, 1.87; P=0.001). Biochemical failure, distant metastases, 
and  the  rate  of  positive  findings  on  repeat  prostate  biopsy  at  2  years  were  significantly  improved  with 
radiotherapy plus short-term ADT. Acute and late radiation-induced toxic effects were similar in the two 
groups.  The  incidence  of  grade  3  or  higher  hormone-related  toxic  effects  was  less  than  5%.  Reanalysis 
according to risk showed reductions in overall and disease-specific mortality primarily among intermediate-
risk patients, with no significant reductions among low-risk patients.” 
Among patients with stage T1b, T1c, T2a, or T2b prostate adenocarcinoma and a PSA level of 20 ng per 
milliliter  or  less,  the  authors  conclude  that  the  use  of  short-term  ADT  for  4  months  before  and  during 
radiotherapy was associated with significantly decreased disease-specific mortality and increased overall 
survival. According to post hoc risk analysis, the benefit was mainly seen in intermediate-risk, but not low-
risk, men. 
Studies assessing LHRH agonists in the Adjuvant setting 
Adjuvant setting indication claim is supported by the following 4 clinical trials with LHRH agonists. 
EORTC 22961: Duration of androgen suppression in the treatment of prostate cancer; Bolla M, et.al. 
2009; 360: 2516-2527 
In this randomized phase III study, patients with locally advanced prostate cancer (including a smaller 
sub-group of high-risk localised patients) who had received external-beam radiotherapy plus 6 months of 
androgen suppression (LHRH agonist +bicalutamide) were randomized into two groups: 
• one to receive no further treatment (short-term suppression) and 
• one to receive 2.5 years of further treatment with a LHRH agonist alone (long-term suppression). 
The following results have been published in the literature: 
A total of 1113 men were registered, of whom 970 were randomly assigned, 483 to short-term 
suppression and 487 to long-term suppression. After a median follow-up of 6.4 years, 132 patients in the 
short-term group and 98 in the long-term group had died; the number of deaths due to prostate cancer 
was 47 in the short-term group and 29 in the long-term group. The 5-year overall mortality for short 
term and long-term suppression was 19.0% and 15.2%, respectively; the observed hazard ratio was 1.42 
(upper 95.71% confidence limit, 1.79; P = 0.65 for no inferiority). Adverse events in both groups 
included fatigue, diminished sexual function, and hot flushes.

In this phase III trial, patients with T2c-T4 prostate cancer received 4 months goserelin and flutamide 
before and during RT and then were randomized to no further ADT (short-term ADT [STAD] + RT) or 24 
months of goserelin (long-term ADT [LTAD] + RT). 
The following results were published in the literature:

high metastatic risk: 10-year results of an EORTC randomized study. Bolla M , et.al Lancet oncology 2010; 
11: 1066-73 
This is a randomized phase III trial assessing the benefit of addition of long-term androgen suppression 
with a LHRH agonist (goserelin) + 1 month cyproterone acetate to external irradiation in patients with 
prostate cancer with high metastatic risk (10-year follow-up). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to 
receive radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy plus immediate androgen suppression. 
The primary endpoint was clinical disease-free survival. The secondary endpoints were overall survival, 
distant metastasis-free survival, cause-specific mortality, and locoregional control. 
The following results were published in the literature: 
« Between May 22, 1987, and Oct 31, 1995, 415 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups 
and were included in the analysis (208 radiotherapy alone, 207 combined treatment). Median follow-up 
was 9·1 years (IQR 5·1–12·6). 10-year clinical disease-free survival was 22·7% (95% CI 16·3–29·7) in 
the radiotherapy-alone group and 47·7% (39·0–56·0) in the combined treatment group (hazard ratio 
[HR] 0·42, 95% CI 0·33–0·55, p<0·0001). 
10-year overall survival was 39·8% (95% CI 31·9–47·5) in patients receiving radiotherapy alone and 
58·1% (49·2–66·0) in those allocated combined treatment (HR 0·60, 95% CI 0·45–0·80, p=0·0004), and 
10-year prostate-cancer mortality was 30·4% (95% CI 23·2–37·5) and 10·3% (5·1–15·4), respectively 
(HR 0·38, 95% CI 0·24–0·60, p<0·0001). No significant difference in cardiovascular mortality was noted 
between treatment groups both in patients who had cardiovascular problems at study entry (eight of 53 
patients in the combined treatment group had a cardiovascular related cause of death vs 11 of 63 in the 
radiotherapy group; p=0·60) and in those who did not (14 of 154 vs six of 145; p=0·25). Two fractures 
were reported in patients allocated combined treatment. »

results of phase III RTOG 85-31 Pilepich M, et.al. Int. J. Radiation Oncology Biol. Phys 2005; 61: 1285-1290 
This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of adjuvant androgen suppression, using goserelin, 
in unfavorable prognosis carcinoma of the prostate treated with definitive radiotherapy (RT). Eligible 
patients were randomized to either RT or adjuvant Goserelin (Arm I) or RT alone followed by observation 
and application of Goserelin at relapse (Arm II).The primary endpoint was Absolute Survival. 
The secondary endpoints were Local Failure, formation of Distant Metastasis and Prostate Cancer Death 
(also referred to as Disease Specific Mortality). 
The following results have been published in the literature: 
Between 1987 and 1992, when the study was closed, 977 patients were entered: 488 to Arm I and 489 
to Arm II. As of July 2003, the median follow-up for all patients was 7.6 years and for living patients was

11 years. At 10 years, the absolute survival rate was significantly greater for the adjuvant arm than for 
the control arm: 49% vs. 39%, respectively (p = 0.002). The 10-year local failure rate for the adjuvant 
arm was 23% vs. 38% for the control arm (p <0.0001). The corresponding 10-year rates for the 
incidence of distant metastases and disease-specific mortality was 24% vs. 39% (p <0.001) and 16% vs. 
22% (p = 0.0052), respectively, both in favor of the adjuvant arm. 
Study published by McLeod D, Zinner N, Tomera K, Gleason D, Fortheringham N, Campion M et.al. A 
phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized study of abarelix versus leuprolide acetate in men with 
prostate cancer. Urology 2001; 58: 756-6 is summarized below.  
Methods 
Study participants 
Men were eligible for study enrollment if they were at least 18 years of age and were candidates for 
neoadjuvant hormonal therapy; had metastatic disease (Stage D1 or D2); had increasing PSA levels after 
radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or other local therapy; were scheduled for an initial course of 
intermittent therapy; had a life expectancy of greater than 6 months; had adequate renal, hepatic, and 
cardiac function; and had a serum testosterone level between 220 ng/dL and two times the upper limit of 
normal 
Men were excluded if they required immediate treatment for severe bone pain from metastases, spinal 
cord compression, bilateral hydronephrosis, symptoms of bladder neck outlet obstruction, or azotemia 
from metastatic prostate cancer. 
Men were also excluded if they had a history of, or concurrent, secondary cancer; had a recent history of 
clinically significant drug hypersensitivity to LHRH agonists or LHRH antagonists; had an unstable 
concurrent medical condition; had received prior hormonal therapy for prostate cancer, except for 
neoadjuvant hormonal therapy; were taking or planning to take herbal therapy to treat their prostate 
cancer; were receiving or had received corticosteroids (including inhalants) within 90 days; or were 
receiving or had received finasteride or other 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors within 30 days before 
enrollment. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomly assigned to receive abarelix injectable suspension 100 mg or leuprolide acetate 
7.5 mg. Physician-supervised intramuscular injections were administered on days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, and 
141. Men in the abarelix group received an additional injection of the study drug on day 15. As clinically 
indicated, patients could continue treatment with the study drug for up to 1 year.  
Objectives 
The objective of the study was to evaluate the levels of testosterone and other hormones in men with 
prostate cancer treated with abarelix versus leuprolide acetate 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Three prospectively defined primary efficacy endpoints were evaluated. A testosterone surge was defined 
as a serum testosterone measurement that exceeded the baseline level by 10% or greater on any two of 
days 2, 4, or 8. The rapidity of the reduction in the testosterone values was based on the achievement of 
castration (castration was defined as a testosterone measurement of 50 ng/dL or less) on day 8. The 
achievement and maintenance of medical castration from days 29 through 85 was determined by the 
achievement of medical castration on day 29 with no two consecutive non castrate testosterone values 2 
weeks apart between days 29 and 85, inclusive. 
Assessment report  
EMA/613173/2021 
Page 33/50 
 
 
 
 
 
The secondary efficacy endpoints included the rate of medical castration on days 2, 4, and 15. Endocrine 
and biochemical efficacy were also evaluated by the measurement of DHT, LH, FSH, and the rate of 
change in the PSA level with time. 
Sample size 
Sample size was composed of 269 men of which 180 received abarelix and 89 received leuprolide 
acetate. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized (2:1) to treatment according to four strata defined by the screening 
testosterone values (220 to 500 ng/dL and greater than 500 ng/dL) and body weight (less than 200 lb 
and 200 lb or more). 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable, this was an open-label trial. 
Statistical methods 
The proportions of men experiencing a testosterone surge and the proportions of men with medical 
castration on day 8 were compared between the treatment groups using Fisher’s exact test. The 
equivalence in the proportion of patients who achieved and maintained castration was evaluated using a 
95% confidence interval on the difference in the proportions between the two treatment groups. The 
endocrine and PSA levels were compared between the treatment groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum 
test 
Results 
Participant flow 
Two hundred sixty-nine men received abarelix (n = 180) or leuprolide acetate (n =89). Ninety-eight   
percent of the abarelix group and 95% of the leuprolide acetate group completed treatment through day 
85.

Outcomes and estimation 
No man who received abarelix experienced a testosterone surge compared with 82% of the men who 
received leuprolide acetate (P <0.001). The median increase from the baseline testosterone levels on days 
2, 4, and 8 in the leuprolide acetate group was 45%, 54%, and 15%, respectively (interquartile range 
23% to 68%, 30% to 101%, and -12% to 36%, respectively). After day 29, a comparable percentage of 
men achieved and maintained castration. 
Forty-three (24%) of 176 men in the abarelix group had achieved medical castration on day 2 of the 
study (1 day after the initial injection), 99 (57%) of 173 on day 4, and 129 (72%) of 180 on day 8 (Table 
II). None of the leuprolide acetate treated patients had achieved medical castration by day 2, 4, or 8 (P 
<0.001). On day 15, 134 (75%) of 179 abarelix patients had achieved medical castration compared with 
9 (10%) of 88 leuprolide acetate- treated patients (P<0.001). When a post hoc analysis was done 
defining castration as a testosterone level of 20 ng/dL or less, the results were similar (Table 7). 
Medical castration was achieved and maintained by 91.7% of the abarelix-treated patients and 95.5% of 
the leuprolide acetate-treated patients (95% confidence interval, -9.7% to 2.1%).

In men who had achieved castration on day 29, castration was maintained by 98.8% of the abarelix 
group (95% confidence interval, -2.5% to 4.7%) and 97.7% of the leuprolide acetate group 
Table 7 Median testosterone values and rapidity of median castration  
The median (dihydrotestosterone) DHT values followed a similar pattern to that of testosterone during the 
course of the study (Table 8) . The median DHT value in the abarelix group decreased from the baseline 
median as early as day 2; the median DHT in the leuprolide acetate group was increased over the 
baseline value through day 8. 
In the abarelix group, the median LH decreased to the lower limit of detection by day 2 and remained 
there through day 85 (Table 8). The median LH level in the leuprolide acetate group increased to 4.3 
times the baseline value on day 2, remained at or above baseline through day 8, and decreased to the 
lower limit of detection (1 IU/L) from days 29 through 85. 
In the abarelix group, the median FSH level decreased to below the baseline value as early as day 2 and 
continued to decrease through day 57 to the lower limit of detection (Table 8). It increased slightly on 
day 85, but was still below the level achieved by the leuprolide acetate group. The median 
FSH level in the leuprolide acetate group increased to 2.3 times the baseline value on day 2, and, 
although it decreased through day 15, the median FSH value in the leuprolide acetate group appeared to 
gradually increase through day 85. Patients in the abarelix group attained a statistically significant lower 
FSH level on all days from day 2 to 85, except for day 15.

The percentage of change in the PSA concentrations was significantly greater in the abarelix group than 
in the leuprolide acetate group (P<0.001) on days 15 (P<0.001) and 29 (P =0.001) and appeared to be 
comparable in the two treatment groups after day 29 (Figure 7).

phase 3, multicentre, open label, randomized study of abarelix versus leuprolide plus daily antiandrogen 
in men with prostate cancer. Journal of Urology 2002; 167: 1670-1674 
Only the abstract was available . 
Purpose: We compared the endocrinological and biochemical efficacy of abarelix depot, agonadotropin-
releasing hormone antagonist, with that of a widely used combination of luteinizing hormone releasing 
hormone agonist and a nonsteroidal antiandrogen. 
Materials and methods: A total of 255 patients were randomized to receive open label 100 mg.abarelix 
depot or 7.5 mg. leuprolide acetate intramuscularly injection on days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113 and141 for 24 
weeks. Patients in the abarelix group received an additional injection on day 15 and those in the 
leuprolide acetate group received 50 mg. bicalutamide daily. Patients could continue treatment with study 
drug for an additional 28 weeks. The efficacy end points were the comparative rates of avoidance of 
testosterone surge (greater than 10% increase) within 7 days of the first injection and the rapidity of 
achieving reduction of serum testosterone to castrate levels (50 ng./dl. or less) on day8. Patients were 
monitored for adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. 
Results: Abarelix was more effective in avoidance of testosterone surge (p <0.001) and the rapidity of 
reduction of testosterone to castrate levels on day 8 (p <0.001) than combination therapy. No significant

difference was seen between the groups in the initial rate of decline of serum prostate specific antigen or 
the ability to achieve and maintain castrate levels of testosterone. No unusual or unexpected adverse 
events were reported. 
Conclusions: Abarelix as monotherapy achieves medical castration significantly more rapidly than 
combination therapy and avoids the testosterone surge characteristic of agonist therapy. Both treatments 
were equally effective in reducing serum prostate specific antigen, and achieving and maintaining castrate 
levels of testosterone.

This review examines ADT use in combination with radiotherapy to improve outcomes in localised or 
locally advanced disease and examines some of the latest developments in hormonal therapy for PCa 
with LHRH antagonists: 
Given the rapid onset of testosterone and PSA suppression with degarelix, there has been interest in the 
use of LHRH antagonists in combination with radiotherapy. In a study of NHT (NB: neoadjuvant hormonal 
therapy) in 378 men with localised PCa, biochemical response (i.e., PSA reduction) to NHT was a more 
important predictor of therapeutic benefit than the duration of NHT (Alexander et al, 2010). 
Consequently, for patients who achieve a rapid fall in PSA after starting NHT, it may be possible to 
minimise the duration of ADT and its related toxicities. Thus, rapid biochemical control with LHRH 
antagonists may therefore shorten the duration of NHT. Preclinical data also suggest that tumour volume 
reduction may be greater with the blocker degarelix than with the agonist leuprolide (Princivalle et al, 
2007).  
The authors conclude that “Biochemical response to neoadjuvant ADT before RT, not duration, appears to 
be the critical determinant of benefit in the setting of combined therapy. Individually tailored 
ADT duration based on PRPH-PSA (pre-RT, post-hormone PSA) would maximize therapeutic gain, while 
minimizing the duration of ADT and its related toxicities.” 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The mechanism of action of testosterone suppression by the LHRH antagonist degarelix has been 
validated in the initial MAA with appropriate studies. The non-inferiority of degarelix compared with the 
LHRH agonist leuprorelin to decrease testosterone level was also demonstrated in the initial MAA (CS21, 
Klotz et al.). Regarding the newly claimed indications, the MAH provided references to 5 studies (Study 
CS21, Study CS12, Study 00006, Study CS30 and study EORTC-1414) assessing degarelix with one of 
which ongoing (study (EORTC-1414).  
Studies CS21 and study CS12 were assessed in the context of the initial MAA.  
Study 00006 (PANDA) published by Sun et al. in 2019 was a phase III randomized trial assessing the 
effect of degarelix versus goserelin±bicalutamide of testosterone decrease in a population with all stage 
disease over 1 year. The baseline characteristics did not discriminate in intermediate and high risk of 
localized disease. The results showed non inferiority of degarelix versus goserelin ±bicalutamide on 
testosterone decrease at castration level. On the secondary endpoints, PFS and the absence of PSA failure 
was not different between both groups at Day 364. Of note, the PSA-PFS was significantly in favor of 
degarelix (82.3 vs 71.7 for degarelix and goserelin groups respectively). 
Study CS30 published by Mason et al. in 2013 was a phase III randomized trial assessing the effect of 3 
months neoadjuvant androgen suppression with degarelix or goserelin+bicalutamide in patients in men 
with intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer who were scheduled to undergo subsequent radiotherapy. 
The primary endpoint was tumour volume reduction at week 12. This study was assessed in a previous 
variation for FIRMAGON (EMEA/H/C/000986/II/0015) and could support the indication in neoadjuvant 
setting as no difference was observed between degarelix and goserelin + bicalutamide.  
Finally study EORTC-1414 assessing the effect of degarelix versus LHRH agonists + antiandrogen in 
adjuvant setting is ongoing and no data have been provided. 
Three further studies, evaluated in the context of extension of indications for LHRH agonists, have been 
provided in support of the neoadjuvant treatment for patients with high-risk localized and localized 
disease: RTOG 86-10 (Pilepich et al.), TROG: 96.01 (Denham et al.) and RTOG 94-08 (Jones et al.).

RTOG 86-10 (Pilepich et al.) was a phase III randomized study to assess 16 weeks treatment with 
goserelin+ flutamide starting 2 months before radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in patients with 
clinical stage T2-T4 i.e. patients with localized disease. The primary end point of the study was 
locoregional control; secondary end points were disease-free survival (freedom from progression) and 
survival. From this publication it cannot be determined the proportion of patients with high-risk localized 
disease nevertheless  in conjunction with study RTOG 92-02 (below) in which patients with high risk 
localized prostate cancer represented a large subgroups of the total study population, it is agreed that the 
study population as a whole benefits from combination treatment.  
TROG 96.01 (Denham et al.) was phase III randomized trial to compare 3- or 6- neoadjuvant therapy 
with goserelin + flutamide versus radiotherapy alone in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer 
according to the title but with intermediate and high risk localized disease in addition according to the 
inclusion criteria. Primary endpoints were time to local failure and prostate-cancer-specific survival. The 
secondary endpoints were distant failure, disease-free survival, and freedom from salvage treatment. 
Analyses were done by intention to treat 6-month neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (NADT) 
decreased distant progression (0·49, 0·31–0·76; p=0·001), prostate cancer-specific mortality (0·49, 
0·32–0·74; p=0·0008), and all-cause mortality (0·63, 0·48–0·83; p=0·0008), compared with 
radiotherapy alone. In this study only two short term regimes were compared with no ADT, long-term 
ADT was not included but clinical data from other studies (not shown) demonstrated clinical benefit by 
addition of long-term ADT (3 years) to RT compared to short-term (6 months). 
RTOG 94-08 (Jones et al.) was a phase III randomized trial in localized prostate cancer patients to assess 
the effect of 4 months neoadjuvant therapy with flutamide +goserelin or leuprorelin versus radiotherapy 
alone. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points included disease-specific 
mortality, distant metastases, biochemical failure (an increasing level of PSA), and the rate of positive 
findings on repeat prostate biopsy at 2 years. Although “In all three risk subgroups, short-term 
ADT was associated with a significant reduction in biochemical failure », the authors discussed that a 
“reanalysis of the data according to risk subgroups showed that the gains in overall survival and 
reductions in disease-specific mortality were mainly limited to men in the intermediate-risk subgroup. […] 
Although the addition of short-term ADT to radiotherapy also appeared to be beneficial in the high-risk 
patients, the persistent significant increase in 10-year disease-specific mortality provides support for 
observations from other clinical trials showing that more than 4 months of ADT is required for maximum 
benefit. According to the described inclusion criteria on staging, patients included had low to intermediate 
risk prostate cancer which makes this publication not relevant for the claimed indications. 
In these 3 studies the primary endpoints were not the volume reduction of the tumor but locoregional 
control, time to local failure, prostate-cancer-specific survival or overall survival were assessed depending 
on the trial, thus challenging their relevance in the current neoadjuvant indication. In RTOG 86-10 study, 
the proportion of patients with high-risk localized disease could not be determined. In study TROG 96.01 
no significant reductions in mortality have been noted in either group assigned androgen deprivation. In 
Study 94-08 the gains in overall survival and reductions in disease-specific mortality were mainly limited 
to men in the intermediate-risk subgroup. The persistent significant increase in 10-year disease-specific 
mortality provides support for the observations from other clinical trials that more than 4 months of ADT 
is required for maximum benefit. 
However, although it is considered that the primary goal of neoadjuvant therapy is still to cure the patient 
and not only to reduce the tumor volume, the testosterone and the PSA levels, the relevance of these 3 
surrogate endpoints is considered widely accepted to allow a favorable outcome.

Adjuvant setting 
No data with studies assessing degarelix in the adjuvant setting were provided, the only information 
available derives from a currently ongoing clinical trial sponsored by the EORTC cited above (EORTC-
1414). 
Studies supporting this application in the adjuvant setting are represented by studies conducted with 
LHRH agonists (EORTC 22961, RTOG 92-02, EORTC 22863, and RTOG 85-31).  
EORTC 22961 (Bolla et al.) was a phase III randomized trial comparing radiotherapy plus short-term 
androgen suppression with radiotherapy plus long-term androgen suppression in the treatment of locally 
advanced prostate cancer (patients with high risk localized disease were also included). Androgen 
suppression was achieved by goserelin or triptorelin associated with an antiandrogen therapy (flutamide 
or bicalutamide for 6 months). OS was statistically significantly increased by long term androgen therapy.  
RTOG 92-02 (Horowitz et al.) was a phase III randomized trial to assess Disease Free Survival (DFS), OS, 
local progression (LP), distant metastasis (DM), biochemical failure (BF), and disease-specific survival 
(DSS) of 4 months goserelin + flutamide before and during radiotherapy. Patient were then radomized to 
no further ADT or 24 months of goserelin. A statistically improvement in OS for long term ADT was 
observed in a subgroup of patients with a Gleason score of 8 to 10. After 10 years a benefit in terms of 
DFS and disease-specific survival, but not in terms of OS, was shown for RT in combination with 28 
months ADT, compared to RT in combination with 4 months ADT 
EORTC 22863 (Bolla et al.) was a phase III trial assessing the benefit of addition of long-term androgen 
suppression with goserelin + cyproterone acetate for 1 month in patients with prostate cancer with high 
metastatic risk with a 10-year follow-up. The primary endpoint was clinical disease-free survival. Analysis 
was by intention to treat. The secondary endpoints were overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival, 
cause-specific mortality, and locoregional control. The OS and clinical disease-free survival were 
statistically significant in favor of the combination treatment. 
RTOG 85-31 (Pilepich et al.) was a phase III randomized trial to assess the effect of goserelin without 
anti-androgen started the last week of radiotherapy or at relapse in patients with locally advanced 
prostate cancer after a median follow-up of 7.6 years, confirmed the long-term benefit of adjuvant ADT, 
with a significantly greater 10-year OS (49% versus 39% in the ADT plus radiotherapy versus 
radiotherapy only group, p=0.002). The conclusion of this study mainly focusses on high-risk patients as 
described above, especially the high-risk definition referring to a Gleason Score ≥ 8. To note that this 
patient sub-population comprises only one third (32%) of patients.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data provided by the MAH support the indication for high-risk localised and locally advanced 
patient in neoadjuvant setting.  
Regarding the adjuvant setting, the evidence of biological activity and indirect comparisons are 
convincing and demonstrate the ability to achieve chemical castration.

The safety profile of FIRMAGON is well described. 
The known adverse events of ADT are in relation with androgen deprivation: hot flushes, fatigue, loss of 
libido, weight increase, decrease in haemoglobin, and prolongation of the QT/QTc interval.  
The most important risks associated with ADT are an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, a 
decreased bone density and new onset of diabetes.  
For what concern the increase risk of cardiovascular disease a QT/QTc specific study, Study CS22 
(EMA/H/C/986/II/0986/014G) was conducted to evaluate if degarelix had an impact on the QT/QTc 
prolongation and confirmed that degarelix has no inherent effect on the QT-interval. 
Pooled data from the MAH phase 3 trials comparing LHRH agonists to degarelix suggested a lower risk of 
serious CV event or death from any cause with degarelix (Albersten et al, Eur Urol. 2014; 65 (3):565-73) 
A safety study in patients with advanced prostate cancer treated with FIRMAGON (FE 200486 CS39 PASS) 
focused on cardiovascular events after long term treatment with degarelix compared to LHRH agonists. 
This study showed no significant differences between the groups. 
In the same CS39 PASS study, glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus were also compared 
between the groups with no difference observed.  
Moreover, the approved RMP for degarelix concluded that known risks associated with degarelix no longer 
require additional risk minimization measures (RMM).  
Regarding the safety profile of ADT with radiotherapy, a review published by Dorff et al. refers to a meta-
analysis based on 8 randomized controlled trial suggests that the safety profile of ADT is not altered when 
used in combination with RT. 
Moreover, results from a post-hoc analysis of RTOG 85-31 data suggested that there is no increased 
cardiovascular mortality of adjuvant ADT over salvage ADT (LHRH agonist administered at recurrence). 
Accordingly, RTOG 92-02 and EORTC 22961 also failed to detect an increase in cardiovascular mortality 
for the long-term ADT arm over the short-term ADT arm. 
Safety information of degarelix or LHRH antagonists in combination with radiotherapy were presented in 
the Study 00006 and Study CS30.

Most of the AEs were mild to moderate in intensity. The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was higher 
with degarelix than with goserelin (76.1% and 58.9%, respectively) Table 9. Predominantly general 
disorders and administration site conditions were reported in 52.1% of the degarelix patients. Most 
injection site reactions (35.0%) occurred after the first dose of degarelix and 29% following the other 
dosing intervals Table 9. There were 13 discontinuations due to an AE (four in the degarelix and nine in 
the goserelin group), however, none of these were assessed as treatment-related and none of the 
discontinuations were due to injection site reactions. 
No marked trends were noted in data stratified by baseline PSA category and previous use of 5-alpha 
reductase inhibitors. Patients with metastatic disease reported higher incidence of severe AEs in the 
goserelin group as compared to the degarelix group (14.1% versus 6.7%, respectively). 
There were 14 serious AEs (SAEs) reported by 12 patients (8.5%) treated with degarelix and 27 SAEs 
reported by 18 (12.8%) patients treated with goserelin. The most common SAEs were cardiac disorders, 
which occurred in five patients (3.5%) in the degarelix group and two patients (1.4%) in the goserelin 
group. Two patients each in the degarelix and the goserelin group had SAEs assessed as treatment-
related (acute kidney injury and lung infection possibly related to degarelix and femur fracture and

haematuria possibly related to goserelin). Two patients (1.4%) receiving degarelix had increased PSA 
levels that were reported as SAEs, of which one SAE led to withdrawal of the patient from the study. 
There were no other notable AEs

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
No new safety data of degarelix are provided within this variation application. The safety profile of 
FIRMAGON is well described. 
The safety profile of degarelix or LHRH antagonists in combination with radiotherapy is less known. 
However, safety data from the neoadjuvant study CS30 suggested that the safety profile of degarelix is 
similar to that of goserelin + bicalutamide with the exception of injection site reaction. This is in line with 
the safety data from CS21 study assessing degarelix versus leuprorelin. 
Regarding the adjuvant indication, the ongoing PEGASUS trial -is considered to be of interest in providing 
such data. 
Relevant data regarding the combination with radiotherapy provided by the MAH applies to LHRH 
agonists.  
While no Clinical Study Report of ongoing studies of degarelix in combination with RT are available yet, 
preliminary safety data do not indicate new emerging signals.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Safety data provided by the MAH support the indication for high-risk localised and locally advanced 
patient in neoadjuvant setting. While only preliminary data were provided, the safety profile of degarelix 
in combination with RT is reassuring and it is endorsed that no new safety data could be presented.

3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH claims the use in high-risk localized and locally advanced hormone dependent prostate cancer in 
combination with radiotherapy and as neo-adjuvant treatment prior to radiotherapy in patients with high-
risk localized or locally advanced prostate cancer. 
Locally advanced prostate cancer is defined as prostate cancer that has spread through the prostatic 
capsule to involve tissues and structures adjacent to the prostate gland, including regional lymph nodes, 
the urinary bladder and seminal vesicles, but not nodes and organs distant to the pelvis. In contrast, 
localised prostate cancer describes a condition where the neoplasm is confined within the prostate gland 
itself and where the prostatic capsule has not been breached by the tumour.  
High-risk prostate cancer includes locally advanced prostate cancer (T3–4 N0-X M0) and high-risk 
localized prostate cancer (T2c N0-X M0) with either a Gleason score >7 and/or a baseline PSA of >20 
ng/ml. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
According to European guidelines for high–risk localized disease, possible treatments are radical 
prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection to selected patients with low tumor volume or 
radiotherapy (external beam radiation therapy-EBRT) in combination with long term ADT. 
Regarding locally advanced disease radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection is 
recommended only in highly selected patients with cT3b-T4 N0 or any cN1 only as part of multi-modal 
therapy. EBRT in combination with long term ADT is an option for patients with cN0 disease. Moreover 
ADT monotherapy may be offered only to patients unwilling or unable to receive any form of local 
treatment if they have a prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-doubling time < 12 months, and either a PSA > 
50 ng/mL, a poorly-differentiated tumour or troublesome local disease related symptoms.

Currently only LHRH agonists are authorized in the claimed indications of neoadjuvant/adjuvant for high-
risk localized disease and locally advanced disease. No LHRH antagonists are authorized in the claimed 
indications. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
To support the indication, the MAH summarised study results described in literature. The main efficacy 
results are based on a number of randomized studies assessing degarelix versus LHRH agonists on 
testosterone suppression. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Regarding the neoadjuvant setting, only study CS30 (Mason et al.) is considered relevant. This study 
demonstrated non inferiority of degarelix versus goserelin +bicalutamide for the reduction of the prostate 
volume when administered for 12 weeks as neoadjuvant before radiotherapy with mean (± standard 
deviation) percentage changes of -36.0 ± 14.5% and -35.3 ± 16.7% for degarelix and goserelin, 
respectively, for the FAS and -36.2 ±14.5% and -35.4 ±16.9% for degarelix and goserelin, respectively, 
for the per-protocol analysis set. Data on testosterone and PSA reduction confirm the non-inferiority of 
degarelix compared to goserelin. The median level of testosterone for degarelix-treated patients at weeks 
4, 8 and 12 was 0.05 ng/ml and the corresponding figures for goserelin were 0.17, 0.05 and 0.05 ng/ml, 
respectively. 
Overall, there were seven (of 180) and five patients (of 64) on degarelix and goserelin, respectively, with 
a serum testosterone level >0.5 ng/ml on at least one occasion. The estimated cumulative probabilities of 
testosterone <0.5 ng/ ml between days 28 and 84 were 96% for the degarelix treatment group and 92% 
for the goserelin treatment group. 
The median percentage changes in PSA were also comparable; for degarelix the decreases from baseline 
at weeks 4, 8 and 12 were -71.6, -84.8 and -89.2%, respectively, whereas for goserelin they were -72.2, 
-93.1 and -93.0%. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The main uncertainty is the lack of efficacy data with degarelix in the adjuvant setting however the 
mechanism of action and the similar reduction in testosterone and PSA level of degarelix compared to 
LHRH agonists supports an extrapolation of efficacy in terms of clinical endpoints in the adjuvant setting.  
Moreover the provision of results from the ongoing PEGASUS study, requested as soon as available, will 
further clarify efficacy and safety data of degarelix with RT in the adjuvant setting. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of FIRMAGON is well established: 
The known adverse events of ADT in relation with androgen deprivation are: hot flushes, fatigue, loss of 
libido, weight increase, decrease in haemoglobin, and prolongation of the QT/QTc interval.  
The most important risks associated with ADT are increased risk of cardiovascular disease, decreased 
bone density and new onset of diabetes. 
The recently assessed PSUR of degarelix included a PASS which did not provide any information in the 
claimed indications. No indication of combination with radiotherapy was detailed as off label use.

Safety data of CS30 suggest a similar safety profile between degarelix and LHRH agonists when used in 
neoadjuvant setting except for System Organ Classes of General disorder and administration site 
condition. This is in line with study 00006 with 52.1% and 8.5% for degarelix and goserelin respectively 
and with study CS21 for Preferred Term injection site reaction 40% and <1 % for degarelix and 
leuprorelin respectively. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Specific data with degarelix for long term use as adjuvant therapy in combination with radiotherapy are 
missing. However, based on experience with LHRH agonists deleterious adverse effects of degarelix when 
administrated concomitantly to radiotherapy are not expected. A phase III study (EORTC 1414, 
PEGASUS) assessing degarelix versus goserelin is ongoing and will provide further confirmation.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The similar total volume prostate reduction observed with goserelin and degarelix in study CS30 is 
relevant for neoadjuvant setting. Others results in this study show a similar reduction of testosterone and 
PSA serum level up to 12 weeks of ADT. This is in accordance with previous observation of non-inferiority 
of degarelix compared to leuprorelin in achieving decrease in testosterone and PSA level up to 12 months 
in patients with no curative options, not planned to receive radiotherapy (Study CS21). 
Comparison of degarelix to LHRH agonists on testosterone level and PSA can be relevant when 
considering the adjuvant setting. The antitumoral Mechanism of Action of degarelix and LHRH agonists is 
indirect and depends on the depth of castration. The effect of degarelix to reduce testosterone to 
castration level has been established. An extrapolation of efficacy in terms of clinical endpoints based on 
the mechanism of action in the adjuvant setting for which direct data are not available yet can be 
acceptable. An ongoing phase III trial will further confirm this aspect. 
The safety profile of degarelix is well established and the last PSUSA dated from 2019 didn’t show 
unexpected issues. The safety profile of degarelix in adjuvant to radiotherapy is not documented, 
however, and adverse interaction with concurrent RT is not expected.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Considering the neoadjuvant setting, it is acknowledged that degarelix reduces the volume of the prostate 
to similar extend to that of goserelin and it is already described in section 5.1 of the SmPC of degarelix. 
Testosterone levels and PSA levels were also decreased to similar extend between both groups. Both 
groups showed similar safety profiles except for injection site reactions for which degarelix shows a 
poorer toxicity profile than goserelin. This difference was however expected.  
Considering the adjuvant setting, the mechanism of action and the similar reduction in testosterone and 
PSA level of degarelix compared to LHRH agonists supports the claimed indication.  
Result from the ongoing PEGASUS study are requested as soon as they are available to further clarify 
efficacy and safety data of degarelix with RT in the adjuvant setting. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
A phase III study assessing degarelix versus goserelin is ongoing (Phase IIIb Randomized Trial 
Comparing Irradiation Plus Long Term Adjuvant Androgen Deprivation With GnRH Antagonist Versus 
GnRH Agonist Plus Flare Protection in Patients With Very High Risk Localized or Locally Advanced Prostate 
Cancer. A Joint Study of the EORTC ROG and GUCG. PEGASUS. EORTC 1414, EUdraCT 2015-005098-19, 
EORTC 1414, PEGASUS). 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Firmagon is positive. 
The MAH is recommended to provide the results of the PEGASUS-EORTC1414 to confirm efficacy and 
safety data of degarelix in combination with radiotherapy.

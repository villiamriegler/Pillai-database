1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  AstraZeneca  AB  submitted  on  1  September  2010  an  application  for  Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Caprelsa, through the centralised procedure 
falling  within  the  Article  3(1)  and  point  3  of  Annex  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The  eligibility  to 
the  centralised  procedure  was  initially  agreed  upon  by  the  EMA/CHMP  on  23  March  2010  and 
subsequently on 20 September 2010. 
The  applicant  applied  for  the  following  indication:  Vandetanib  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult 
patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended - complete and independent application. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  7  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision 
P/94/2008 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP EMEA-000052-PIP01-07 was not yet completed as 
some measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Not applicable. 
Derogation(s) of market exclusivity 
Not applicable. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
In accordance with Article 3 (2) of Regulation EC No 507/2006, the CHMP proposed the application to 
be considered for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation based on the following claim(s): 
 
The risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product, as defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 
2001/83/EC, is positive. 
Based  on  the  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  presented  in  patients  with 
unresectable  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  MTC,  the  superiority  of  vandetanib  was  demonstrated 
compared  to  placebo,  with  a  11.2  months  increase  (19.3  vs  30.5  months)  of  median  PFS  (HR=0.46, 
Assessment report  
Page 6/88
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
95% CI, 0.31 to 0.69, p=0.0001).  The benefit risk balance of vandetanib in patients with unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic MTC is therefore considered to be positive. 
From a quantitative point, of view, the specific benefit in patients with RET - tumours might be less as 
compared  with  what  was  observed  in  RET+  tumours.  There  is  a  need  to  further  confirm  such 
differences in terms of efficacy in RET negative patients with vandetanib,  
 
It is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide comprehensive clinical data. 
The applicant claimed that it is likely to be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data from 
an open label study with vandetanib in patients with sporadic medullary thyroid cancer with known RET 
mutation status that will support the efficacy and safety of the phase III study D4200C00058. The 
applicant stated that the final analysis of the core phase of this study is planned for Q4 2015. 
  Unmet medical needs to be fulfilled. 
The applicant claims that there is a lack of approved and effective pharmacological treatment other 
than thyroidectomy for MTC patients and that there is a need in the MTC patient population that could 
be fulfilled with the proposed medicinal product. 
 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product 
concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
The applicant claimed that the potential risks inherent in marketing vandetanib for the specific 
indication, while additional, more comprehensive data will be available in the future, would be offset by 
the potential benefit to the patients whose only treatment option currently available is surgery. The 
RMP for vandetanib in the approved indication is considered as adequate to address any identified and 
unknown risks.  
New active Substance status 
The Applicant requested the active substance vandetanib, contained in the above medicinal product, to 
be considered as a new active substance in itself.  
Scientific Advice/Protocol Assistance 
The Applicant received Scientific Advice and Protocol Assistance from the CHMP on 18 November 2005 
and  2  June  2006.  The  Scientific  Advice  and  Protocol  Assistance  pertained  to  non-clinical  and  clinical 
aspects of the dossier.  
Licensing status 
The product was not licensed in any country at the time of submission of the application.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma 
Carcinoma of the thyroid is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system and include mostly 
(85%–95%) well-differentiated tumors (papillary or follicular), about 2.5% to 10% of thyroid cancers 
are medullary carcinoma and other are anaplastic, both of which carry a worse prognosis for patients.  
MTC  is  a  distinct  subtype,  arising  from  the  parafollicular  cells  (C-cells)  of  the  thyroid,  that  has 
particular prognostic and genetic features: it presents mainly as a sporadic cancer (75% of cases) or 
as part of a hereditary syndrome (25%). 
-  The  hereditary  form  of  MTC  is  a  rare  disease  commonly  diagnosed  in  patients  <20  years  and 
characterised  by  Multiple  Endocrine  Neoplasia  (MEN)  with  complete  penetrance  (virtually  all  patients 
develop MTC), but variable expressivity: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type 2a, MEN type 2b, or 
Familial Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (FMTC). Only 50% of patients with MEN2a and MEN2b, develop 
pheochromocytoma  and  30%  of  patients  with  MEN2a  develop  parathyroid  hyperplasia).    All  of  the 
patients  with  MEN2b  develop  a  typical  ganglioneuromastosis  throughout  the  aerodigestive  tract.  
Patients with FMTC develop only MTC).  Patients with hereditary MTC carry a germline mutation of the 
RET gene, leading to constitutive activation of the RET tyrosine kinase. 
-  The  sporadic  form  of  MTC  most  often  presents  in  middle-aged  patients  as  a  solitary  nodule  in  the 
thyroid.    RET  was  found  to  be  mutated  in  some  tumors  of  patients  with  sporadic  MTC,  and  patients 
with RET mutations (especially the common M918T mutation) are more likely to have regional lymph 
node involvement or distant metastases and a worse outcome. 
Symptoms and Prognosis 
Patients  with  MTC  often  have  localization  to  the  neck  and  mediastinum.  Main  symptoms  are  mostly 
diarrhoea,  pain,  opiod  use,  fatigue,  respiratory  symptoms,  flushing,  weight  loss  and  dysphagia. 
Metastatic MTC spreads most often to the regional lymphatics as well as to the liver, lungs, and bones.  
Metastases can be anticipated by increasing levels of calcitonin and are often evident on radiographic 
imaging studies.   
The  5-year  survival  for  medullary  cancer  with  regional  spread  is  about  78%.  For  medullary  cancer 
which spread to distant sites or lymph node the 5-year survival rate is approximately 40% and median 
overall survival is 2-3 years in patients with distant metastatic disease. Approximately 35% of patients 
present  with  tumor  extending  beyond  the  thyroid  with  regional  lymph  node  involvement,  and  13% 
have metastatic disease at initial diagnosis. Metastatic disease is the most common cause of death in 
patients  with  MTC,  and  approximately  90%  of  patients  with  metastatic  disease  die  of  progressive 
cancer.  
Patients  with  the  hereditary  form  of  the  disease  generally  have a  better  prognosis  than  patients  with 
the  sporadic  form.    However,  if  patients  are  matched  for  age  and  disease  stage,  no  differences  in 
survival  are  seen,  suggesting  that  patients  with  sporadic  disease  may  be  diagnosed  later  with  more 
advanced disease.   
Treatment  
Assessment report  
Page 9/88
  
 
 
 
   
 
Patients with MTC can be cured only by thyroidectomy, performed when the tumour is confined to the 
thyroid gland.  The tumour is relatively unresponsive to conventional doses of radiation therapy and to 
chemotherapeutic regimens (none of which have been approved in this indication yet). 
About the product 
Caprelsa, vandetanib, is an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with activity against the 
Rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene, the Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 
(VEGFR) and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).  
Initially,  the  Applicant  claimed  vandetanib  was  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. 
Subsequently, as a result of the evaluation procedure, the approved indication states as follows: 
Caprelsa is indicated for the treatment of aggressive and symptomatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) 
in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. For patients in whom Rearranged 
during  Transfection  (RET)  mutation  is  not  known  or  is  negative,  a  possible  lower  benefit  should  be 
taken into account before individual treatment decision (see important information in sections 4.4 and 
5.1). 
Treatment  should  be  initiated  and  supervised  by  a  physician  experienced  in  treatment  of  MTC  and  in 
the  use  of  anticancer  medicinal  products  and  experienced  in  the  assessment  of  electrocardiogram 
(ECG).    Only  one  supply  per  prescription  is  allowed.  For  a  further  supply,  a  new  perscription  is 
required. 
The recommended dose is one 300 mg tablet once a day, taken with or without food at about the same 
time each day.  
If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. If it is less than 12 hours to 
the  next  dose,  the  patient  should  not  take  the  missed  dose.  Patients  should  not  take  a  double  dose 
(two doses at the same time) to make up for a forgotten dose. 
Patients treated with Caprelsa must be given the patient alert card and be informed about the risks of 
Caprelsa.  
Vandetanib may be administered until patients with MTC are no longer benefiting from treatment.  
QTc  interval  should  be  carefully  assed  prior  to  initiation  of  treatment.  In  the  event  of  common 
terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) grade 3 or higher toxicity or prolongation of the ECG 
QTc interval, dosing with vandetanib should be at least temporarily stopped and resumed at a reduced 
dose when toxicity has resolved or improved to CTCAE grade 1. The 300 mg daily dose can be reduced 
to  200 mg  (two  100 mg  tablets),  and  then  to  100 mg  if  necessary.  The  patient  must  be  monitored 
appropriately.  Due  to  the  19-day  half-life,  adverse  reactions  including  a  prolonged  QTc  interval  may 
not resolve quickly. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Caprelsa contains the active substance vandetanib. For other ingredients see the SmPC. The product is 
formulated  as  immediate  release  tablets  of  two  strengths.  The  100  mg  strength  is  presented  as  a 
round,  biconvex,  white,  film-coated  tablet  with  ‘Z100’  impressed  on  one  side;  the  other  side  is  plain. 
Assessment report

The  300  mg  strength  is  presented  as  an  oval-shaped,  biconvex,  white,  film-coated  tablet  with  ‘Z300’ 
impressed on one side; the other side is plain.  
The product is packaged in PVC/PVDC/alu blisters.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The  chemical  name  of  the  active  substance  is  N-(4-bromo-2-fluorophenyl)-6-methoxy-7-[(1-
methylpiperidin-4-yl) methoxy] quinazolin-4-amine.  
The  corresponding  molecular  formula  is  C22H 24BrFN4O2,  molecular  weight  is  475.36  g/mol.  The 
compound is achiral.  
The  structure  of  vandetanib  was  confirmed  by  elemental  analysis,  mass  spectrometry,  infra  red 
spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, differential scanning 
calorimetry and X-ray crystallography.    
Vandetanib  is  a  white  to  off-white  powder.  The  substance  exhibits  pH-dependent  aqueous  solubility 
(with best solubility at acidic pH) and is defined as class II (low solubility/high permeability) under the 
Biopharmaceutics  Classification  System  (BCS).  Vandetanib  shows  varied  solubility  in  organic  solvents 
(sparingly soluble in tetrahydrofuran and ethanol, slightly soluble in ethylacetate, very slightly soluble 
in acetonitrile).  
Manufacture 
The  applicant  decided  to  use  some  elements  of  quality  by  design  (QbD)  approach  for  the  active 
substance  synthesis.  The  manufacture  of  vandetanib  is  a  seven  step  process  starting  from  three 
starting materials. Three intermediates are key intermediates; however, only one of them is routinely 
controlled.  Specifications  for  starting  materials  and  this  intermediate  have  been  adequately  justified. 
Regarding the other isolated intermediates, suitable specifications for skip testing have been set.  
A design space with respect to impurities formation has been defined for each of the intermediates. No 
critical process parameters were identified, as the level of impurities remained well below the tolerated 
levels at all times. Consequently, the ranges established during the screening have been considered as 
proven acceptable ranges.  
The design space boundaries have been established using a combination of prior knowledge, significant 
manufacturing  experience  and  experimentation  in  conjunction  with  science-based  risk  management 
processes.    The  vandetanib  design  space  boundaries  are  justified  based  on  an  examination  of  all  the 
information from the development of the vandetanib synthetic process, the manufacture of clinical trial 
batches and extensive systematically designed multi factorial studies. 
Assessment report  
Page 11/88
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
For  the  purification  step  of  vandetanib,  the  applicant  has  also  described  the  approach  to  determine 
process  parameters  and  identified  the  region  of  thermodynamic  stability  of  anhydrate.  Process 
parameters  for  the  distillation  and  residual  water  post-distillation  have  been  set  and  impurity 
interaction  experiments  have  been  performed.  Based  on  these  additional  data,  the  boundaries  of  the 
design space for the purification step correspond to the ranges explored in the design of experiments. 
The applicant has agreed to verify at commercial scale any movement of the manufacturing process to 
a  different  area  of  the  design  space,  other  than  the  area  of  the  design  space  already  authorised, 
according to the agreed process verification protocol. 
Specification 
A  number  of  critical  quality  attributes  (CQA)  for  the  active  substance  were  considered  during  the 
establishment of the proposed vandetanib design space. Some of the CQAs are controlled in the active 
substance  specification  –  these  are  description,  identification,  assay,  purity,  contents  of  residual 
solvents, sulphated ash and particle size. For the rest of CQAs a justification why this is not necessary 
was provided.  
Vandetanib  is  routinely  controlled  by  in-house  monograph  which  includes  appearance,  identification, 
assay,  organic  impurities,  residual  solvents  and  particle  size.  An  exhaustive  discussion  has  been 
provided on impurity profile; detailed information was provided for intermediates, reaction by-products 
and  the  active  substance  degradants.  The  impurity  limits  are  considered  safe,  based  on  toxicology 
data. Absence of routine control of starting materials, potential genotoxic impurities, residual solvents 
and heavy metals has been sufficiently justified by additional data.  
Analytical  methods  used  for  the  active  substance  control  have  been  sufficiently  described  and 
appropriately validated. 
Batch results starting from early development batches were provided. Recent production batches were 
manufactured  within  the  proposed  design  space  limits  at  the  set  points.  All  results  conform  to  the 
active substance specification.   
Stability 
Stability  studies  according  to  the  relevant  EU/ICH  stability  guidelines  have  been  submitted  with  late 
development batches. Based on stability results submitted up to 48 months at long term conditions, a 
retest  period  of  60  months  can  be  granted  with  the  special  storage  “stored  in  the  primary  packaging 
protected from light”.  
Vandetanib solid is found to be stable to both thermal and hydrolytic degradation but a small degree of 
degradation  is  observed  under  stressed  photolytic  conditions.  In  solution,  vandetanib  is  degraded 
under acidic, oxidative and light stress conditions but it is stable under basic conditions.   
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
All  excipients,  used  in  the  finished  product  manufacture,  are  of  compendial  quality.  Dibasic  calcium 
phosphate  dihydrate  and  microcrystalline  cellulose  are  used  as  fillers,  crospovidone  as  disintegrant, 
povidone as binder and magnesium stearate as lubricant. Purified water is used in wet granulation but

is  not  present  in  the  finished  product.  The  tablets  are  film-coated  with  a  mixture  of  hypromellose, 
polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide and purified water. 
The applicant proposed to have flexible range in the amount of some of the excipients (dibasic calcium 
phosphate  dihydrate,  microcrystalline  cellulose,  magnesium  stearate  and  the  film  coating).  This, 
however,  was  only  accepted  for  magnesium  stearate  and  the  film  coating,  based  on  the  knowledge 
gained  during  the  development.  The  amounts  of  dibasic  calcium  phosphate  dihydrate  and 
microcrystalline cellulose have been fixed during the procedure.   
Physicochemical  properties  of  the  active  substance  and  its  compatibility  with  the  excipients  were 
extensively studied. Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements.  
Both the formulation and manufacturing development have been evaluated through the use of design 
of experiments including the risks identified during risk assessments. A design space has been defined 
for  the  wet  granulation  and  the  dry  granulate  milling.  Critical  process  parameters  forming  the  design 
space are clearly set and found acceptable. Particle size reduction of vandetanib is performed prior to 
the  finished  product  manufacture.  Particle  size  within  the  set  specification  limit  does  not  affect 
dissolution performance of the tablets. Data from process screening also demonstrated that dissolution 
performance is not affected by tablet hardness.  
It  has  been  demonstrated  that  dissolution  is  not  critical  for  the  in  vivo  performance,  as  the  limiting 
factor  for  bioavailability  is  the  absorption  rate.  Several  tablet  variants  were  prepared  and  tested  for 
dissolution behaviour. In vitro dissolution tests can differentiate between these variants; however, as 
seen from their in vivo behaviour in a clinical study, they can be considered bioequivalent.  
Dissolution  experiments  were  conducted  at  varied  conditions  for  the  pH  and  use  of  surfactant. 
Dissolution  rate  is  related  to  disintegration  time.  A  discriminating  dissolution  method  has  been 
developed. 
Adventitious agents 
No  materials  used  in  the  manufacture  of  the  finished  product  are  of  human  or  animal  origin. 
Magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin. 
Manufacture of the product 
Conventional  wet  granulation  approach  was  selected  as  vandetanib  has  sub-optimal  compression 
properties  and  is  incorporated  into  the  tablets  in  a  high  load.  Risk  assessment  of  individual 
manufacturing steps and their impact on the quality of the product was performed.  
Both tablet strengths are manufactured from the common granulate.  
The  manufacturing  process  starts  with  dispensing  of  the  ingredients  which  are  then  dry  mixed.  The 
mixture  is  granulated  with  purified  water,  the  wet  mass  is  de-lumped  on  a  screening  mill  and  the 
granulate is dried.  The dried granulate is afterwards mixed with magnesium stearate and compressed 
into tablet cores. The tablet cores are film-coated in a coating pan. The finished product is packed into 
blisters.  
In-process  controls  are  performed  at  each  step  of  the  manufacturing  process  as  part  of  the  overall 
control strategy; the critical process parameters are tested to ensure that the product is manufactured 
inside the design space. Non-critical in process controls are performed to confirm continuous quality of 
the product on-line and to reduce testing at release. The batch size has been defined.  
Traditional approach has been followed with respect to manufacturing process validation.  
Assessment report  
Page 13/88
 
 
   
 
The  manufacturing  process  was  sufficiently  described  and  validated  to  the  extent  required  for  the 
marketing  authorisation  approval.  At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  Opinion  the  proposed  design  space  was 
only partly verified at commercial scale. Only a target area of the restricted approved design space has 
been verified. This is acceptable and no concerns are raised about the capability and reproducibility of 
the  manufacturing  process,  when  operating  in  this  target  area.    However  if  the  applicant  wishes  to 
move  to  other  areas  of  the  design  space,  then  this  move  should  be  verified  with  an  appropriate 
verification  scheme.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  currently  approved  verification  scheme  has  a  limited 
value in assessing the risk of such moves. Therefore prior to moving to areas of the design space not 
already verified, the applicant needs to submit a revised verification scheme (submitted as a variation 
in  section  3.2.R),  including  consideration  of  the  requirement  for  a  running-in  period  based  on  the 
assessment of the risk attributed to new areas of the design space. 
Product specification 
The critical quality attributes were defined: identity, assay, degradation products, uniformity of dosage 
units,  dissolution  and  microbial  purity.  These  are  also  specification  parameters,  together  with 
description.    
Reduced  finished  product  testing  approach,  based  on  the  results  of  real  time  testing,  has  been 
proposed  for  the  release  testing.  The  dissolution  test  will  not  be  performed  routinely  at  the  time  of 
release  as  it  is  controlled  via  the  GSA  and  disintegration  in-process  tests.  Nevertheless,  it  will  be 
performed  on  stability.  The  uniformity  of  dosage  units  by  weight  variation  will  not  be  performed 
routinely  either;  however,  all  batches  would  comply  with  the  limit  if  tested.    The  test  for  microbial 
purity  has  been  included  in  the  finished  product  control  strategy.  All  batches  would  pass  the  test  if 
tested. 
The reduced testing at release has been accepted in principle. However, it cannot be applied before the 
outcome of the running-in period is available. Release testing frequency will be revised through a risk 
assessment process, based on the outcome of the proposed running-in-period scheme (i.e. full testing 
for  five  commercial  batches  per  strength).  The  switch  from  parallel  testing  to  reduced  testing  will  be 
done through a variation.  
Adequate  descriptions  of  the  in-house  analytical  methods  are  given.  The  methods  are  appropriately 
validated. Batch results starting from development batches and including clinical batches produced at 
the proposed commercial manufacturing site, have been provided. All results comply with the finished 
product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Three  batches  of  vandetanib  100  mg  tablets  and  three  batches  of  300  mg  tablets  manufactured  at 
production  scale  at  the  commercial  site  were  stored  in  the  proposed  commercial  packaging,  i.e. 
PVC/PVDC/alu  blisters.  The  tablets  were  also  tested  in  bulk  and  at  stressed  conditions  (high 
temperature, light).  
Samples have been tested at each time point for description, assay, dissolution, degradation products 
and water content. In addition, microbial purity has been tested annually.  
The stability studies have been performed according to EU/ICH guidelines on stability. All parameters 
remained  within  specification  during  the  stability  testing  at  all  storage  conditions.  Slight  increase  in 
water content and decrease of dissolution was observed at accelerated and intermediate conditions; no 
other trends are detected. No degradation was seen in the samples.

needed.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Initial  major  objections  related  to  the  design  space  for  both  the  active  substance  and  the  finished 
product have been satisfactorily solved. The design space has been partly reduced as compared to the 
initial application. The boundaries of the design space are now adequately set to ensure desired quality 
of the finished product.  
The quality of the product is considered acceptable.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical development program comprises of pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology 
studies which have been performed in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP).   
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamics in vitro 
Vandetanib potently and selectively inhibited VEGFR-2, EGFR and RET kinase activity, which are 3 key 
targets in MTC. 
Vandetanib more effectively inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR/L858R mutants (substitution of Leucine 
at  codon  858  with  Arginine)  than  wild-type  EGFR.  Phosphorylation  of  the  gatekeeper  mutants, 
EGFR/T790M  (substitution  of  Threonine  at  codon  790  with  Methionine)  and  RET/V804,  showed 
decreased sensitivity to Vandetanib. 
Assessment report  
Page 15/88
 
 
 
 
   
 
In  in  vitro  model  of  angiogenesis,  Vandetanib  inhibited  VEGF-stimulated  endothelial  cell  migration, 
proliferation, survival and new blood vessel formation.  
Primary pharmacodynamics in vivo 
In vivo, Vandetanib significantly reduced VEGF-induced and tumour cell-induced angiogenesis, tumour 
vessel  permeability  and  tumour  microvessel  density,  and  inhibited  tumour  growth  and  metastasis  in 
human and murine xenograft and orthotopic models of cancer.  
In various human tumour xenograft models in mice, Vandetanib significantly inhibited tumour growth 
and  angiogenesis  and  induced  tumour  regressions.  These  anti-tumour  effects  became  more 
pronounced  as  the  dose  increased  and  were  independent  on  tumour  size  at  the  start  of  treatment. 
When  treatment  was  stopped  tumours  rapidly  re-grew,  but  growth  was  re-inhibited  when  treatment 
was restarted, indicating that tumours remain responsive to Vandetanib without developing resistance 
and that sustained treatment with Vandetanib is required to maintain inhibition of tumour growth.  
In  the  PC-9  human  lung  cancer  model,  Vandetanib  produced  a  more  sustained  anti-tumour  effect, 
whereby  PC-9  tumours  did  not  re-grow  when  treatment  was  stopped.  The  antitumor  activity  and 
inhibition of angiogenesis was enhanced when Vandetanib was given in combination with taxanes. 
The  2  metabolites  of  Vandetanib,  N-desmethyl  and  N-oxide  Vandetanib,  showed  similar  inhibitory 
activity  against  both  VEGFR-2,  VEGFR-1,  EGFR  and  FGFR-1  compared  to  Vandetanib.  The  N-oxide 
metabolite was less potent than the N-desmethyl metabolite against all kinase enzymes.  
Vandetanib showed broad-spectrum antitumour activity in vivo. This antitumour activity extended to a 
range  of  models  (subcutaneously  or  orthotopically  implanted  human  tumour  xenografts  or  syngeneic 
murine tumours) and histological types, including lung, colon, breast, prostate, ovarian, glioma, head 
and neck. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In  a  murine  model  of  wound  healing,  Vandetanib  did  not  prevent  wound  healing,  but  was  associated 
with a reduced skin breaking strength.  
In an in vitro selectivity screen, Vandetanib bound significantly to 59/334 receptor or enzyme targets 
including  several  protein  kinases  previously  identified  in  other  screening  assays.  Ten  receptors  were 
bound  by  Vandetanib  with  sufficient  affinity  (IC50  <  1µM)  to  suggest  the  potential  for  receptor 
interactions. Then, next to targets directly involved in tumour proliferation and angiogenesis (VEGFR-2, 
EGFR and RET), Vandetanib is active against other targets. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Vandetanib inhibited the hERG channel with an IC 50 of 0.4 µM, produced an increase in action potential 
duration  at  concentrations  of  ≥1  µM  in  isolated  Purkinje  fibers  and  increased  QTcV  by  up  to  15%  in 
anaesthetised  dogs.  These  results  suggest  clearly  a  hERG  channel-mediated  risk  of  QT  interval 
prolongation in humans.  
Assessment report  
Page 16/88
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
When  Vandetanib  was  given  in  combination  with  ondansetron,  an  anti-emetic  drug,  an  increase  in 
hERG channel inhibition was observed.  
Vandetanib  increased  blood  pressure  in  rats  and  dogs  and  then,  might  also  have  the  potential  to 
induce hypertension in humans.  
In conscious rats, a single oral dose of Vandetanib up to 200 mg/kg did not affect respiratory function. 
At these doses, no effect in humans is expected since 40 mg/kg produced a protein free Cmax similar 
to that seen in patients at a therapeutic dose of 300 mg which is significant lower than the dose rates 
tested in this study. 
Oral administration of Vandetanib caused significant inhibition of gastric emptying and intestinal transit 
at doses of 40, 200 and 1000 mg/kg. 
Vandetanib minimally affected Central Nervous System function. In rats, Vandetanib caused a decrease 
in open field activities at all dose levels (40, 200 and 1000 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and a decrease in landing 
foot splay at 1000 mg/kg. However, given these high doses, these finding are not considered to be of 
clinical relevance. 
A single oral dose of 50 mg/kg Vandetanib did not affect renal function in conscious rats. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Vandetanib  was  absorbed  slowly  with  a  Tmax  ranged  from  2  to  8  hours  after  single  or  repeated  oral 
administration of vandetanib to rats and dogs, the oral bioavailability was generally good (50 to 90 %). 
The C max and area under the curve (AUC0-24) increased fairly dose-proportional up to about 25 mg/kg 
and thereafter slightly less than proportional in rats after repeated administration.  
Distribution 
The protein binding of 14C-Vandetanib in plasma of mice, rats, rabbits dogs and human was moderate, 
from  83  to  90%.  The  tissue  distribution  of  vandetanib  and/or  metabolites  in  pigmented  and  non 
pigmented  male  rats  after  single  oral  dosing  was  slow  but  extensive,  and  consistent  with  the 
distribution  pattern  of  a  lipophilic  compound.  Highest  concentrations  of  vandetanib  and/or  its 
metabolites were seen in the majority of tissues at 6-8 hours after administration. The distribution of 
radioactivity to brain was evident. Retention of radioactivity was seen in pigmented tissues indicating 
melanin affinity. A significant distribution of radioactivity was seen in milk of lactating rats and further 
on in the plasma of suckling pups.

Metabolism 
The metabolism of vandetanib seemed to be similar in the toxicology species, rat and dog, as well as in 
mouse  and  human.  The  2  major  metabolites  identified  in  excreta,  were  N-desmethyl-vandetanib  and 
vandetanib-N-oxide.  In  mouse,  a  minor  metabolite  was  also  identified  as  O-desalkyl-vandetanib 
glucuronid. A glucuronide conjugate was also detected in human urine. 
Metabolism as well as biliary excretion appears to be most important for the elimination of vandetanib 
in  preclinical  species.  CYP  identification  studies  in  vitro,  suggest  that  CYP3A4  is  involved  in  the 
formation  of  N-desmethyl-Vandetanib.  vandetanib-N-oxide 
is 
formed  via  FMO1  and  FMO3 
(FMO=flavine  mono-oxygenase).  Both  these  enzymes  are  also  found  in  kidney  indicating  that  renal 
excretion might be contributed to the clearance of vandetanib. 
Excretion 
Excretion  of  14C-Vandetanib  in  faeces  (via  bile)  was  the  major  route  in  mouse,  rat  and  dog  with 
excretion  in  urine  being  a  minor  route.  The  rate  of  excretion  was  generally  slow  and  consistent  with 
the plasma half-lives of vandetanib. As vandetanib was the major component detected in rat faeces it 
is  likely  that  N-oxide  is  excreted  into  the  faeces  and  then  reduced  back  to  vandetanib  in  the  gut.  In 
dogs,  the  major  component  in  faeces  was  unchanged  vandetanib  and  it  is  possible  that  a  similar 
reduction had occurred in the gut of dogs.    
Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions (in vitro) 
Vandetanib and hepatic cytochromes 
Vandetanib  is  metabolized  through  the  CYP3A4  about  10%  and  the  FMO1  and  FMO  3,  about  2%, 
yielded to N-desmethyl vandetanib and to vandetanib-N-oxide, respectively. 
Cytochrome inhibition by vandetanib 
Vandetanib produced some inhibition of CYP2D6 with IC50 and Ki values of 25 and 13 μg/mL, 
respectively. 
Cytochrome induction by vandetanib 
Induction  of  CYP1A2,  2C9  and  3A4  by  vandetanib  was  evident  in  studies  using  human  hepatocytes. 
Maximal  induction  of  CYP1A2  activity  (3-fold  increase  in  activity,  28%  of  the  positive  control  (β-
naphthoflavone)  response),  CYP2C9  activity  (2,3-fold,  38%  of  the  positive  control  (rifampicin)  effect) 
and CYP3A4  activity (17,2 -fold increase, 33% of the positive control (rifampicin) effect), occurred at 
0,95 μg/mL of vandetanib, a concentration close to the therapeutic one at 300 mg, i.e. 0,81 μg/mL 
Vandetanib  showed  a  weak  inhibition  of  P-gp  (IC50  =  8.7  μg/ml)  and  BCRP  (IC50  =  11.9  μg/ml). 
Considering  that  the  steady-state  concentrations  of  vandetanib  following  100  mg  and  300  mg  daily 
dosing  are  approximately  0,32  μg/ml  and  0,81µg/ml,  respectively,  it  is  unlikely  that  vandetanib  will 
markedly  affect  the  disposition  of  P-gp  and  BCRP  substrates.  However,  since  these  transporters  are 
located  at  the  intestinal  level  and  since  the  concentrations  of  vandetanib  are  much  higher  in  the 
gastro-intestinal tract than in plasma, inhibition of P-gp and BCRP at this level cannot be excluded.  
OCT2  
Vandetanib  was  an  inhibitor  of  OCT2  inhibiting  the  uptake  of  the  selective  OCT2  marker  substrate 
[14C]-creatinine  by  HEK-OCT2  cells,  with  a  mean  IC50  value  of  approximately  2,  1  μg/ml  (study 
KMX083).

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
A single oral dose of Vandetanib at 2000 mg/kg to mice or rats was not tolerated and all animals died 
or were killed for humane reasons. A single oral dose of 1000 mg/kg resulted in the death of 1 out of 
10 mice while in rats there were no adverse effects at this dose. An IV single dose of 50 mg/kg in mice 
resulted  in  early  death  in  1  of  10  mice.  No  IV  single  dose  toxicity  was  performed  in  rats  due  to 
intolerance to the vehicle.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  rats  (up  to  6  months)  and  in  dogs  (up  to  9  months) 
using the oral route. In addition, repeat dose toxicity studies up to 14 days IV dosing were performed 
in rats and dogs. 
Dose-limiting toxicities in 1, 6 and 9 month studies included gastrointestinal effects in dogs, and skin 
and hepatotoxicity in rats. As a result of such toxicity, exposures in the toxicity studies in most cases 
did not reach margins of clinical exposure. 
Key 
findings 
in  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies 
included  adverse  signs  (emesis, 
loose 
faeces/diarrhoea),  hepatobiliary  toxicity,  dysplasia  of  teeth  and  epiphysial  growth  plate,  folliculitis  of 
the skin, renal papillary necrosis, phospholipidosis in variety of tissues and haematological effects and 
ovarian  atrophy.  These  findings  were  generally  in  accordance  with  what  would  be  expected  from  an 
inhibition of VEGFR and EGFR signalling.  
Genotoxicity 
Vandetanib was evaluated over a range of concentrations between 5 and 5000 μg/plate using 4 strains 
of Salmonella typhimurium (TA1535, TA1537, TA98 and TA100) and 2 strains of Escherichia coli (WP2P 
and  WP2  uvrA),  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  a  rat  liver-derived  metabolic  activation  system  (S9-
mix).  Vandetanib  showed  no  mutagenic  potential.  Vandetanib  was  not  clastogenic  to  cultured  human 
lymphocytes. 
Vandetanib  did  not  increase  the  incidence  of  micronucleated  polychromatic  erythrocytes  in  the  bone 
marrow of male rats when administered as a single oral dose of up to 1000 mg/kg. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been submitted. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The reproductive toxicity of Vandetanib was investigated in a series of studies to assess embryofoetal 
toxicity, male and female fertility as well as pre and post-natal development. 
Vandetanib significantly affected all stages of female reproduction in rats. A decrease in the number of 
corpora  lutea  was  observed  in  the  ovaries  of  rats  dosed  at  75  mg/kg/day  in  the  1  month  toxicology 
study.  In  the  absence  of  maternal  toxicity  in  a  female  fertility  study,  there  was  a  trend  towards 
increased oestrus cycle irregularity in animals dosed at 10 or 25 mg/kg/day. A dose-related increase in 
early  intra-uterine  deaths,  resulting  in  a  reduced  number  of  live  embryos  and  increased  post-
Assessment report  
Page 19/88
 
 
 
   
 
implantation loss, was observed at 10 and 25 mg/kg/day. Following a 4 week withdrawal period there 
were no effects on oestrus cycles, pre- or post-implantation losses, or on the number of lives embryos. 
In  the  embryofetal  development  study  in  rats,  heart  vessel  abnormalities  (aortic  arch  interrupted  or 
right  sided,  subclavian  artery  arising  from  ductus  arteriosus  or  pulmonary  arch;  subclavian  artery 
retro-oesophageal;  innominate  artery  absent)  and  precocious  ossification  of  some  skull  bones  were 
observed  at  25  mg/kg/day.  Heart  vessel  abnormalities  were  observed  also  at  lower  doses  (10 
mg/kg/day and 1 mg/kg/day) and a no-effect level was not established. 
In  a  rat  pre-  and  post-natal  development  study,  an  increase  in  pre-birth  loss  was  observed  at  10 
mg/kg/day. Reduced post-natal pup growth was observed in all treated groups. There were no effects 
on behavioural tests, mating performance, fertility and gestation of the F1 generation. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data was submitted for repeat dosing in rats and dogs. 
Total steady state AUC 0-24 after 100 mg/day (~1.43 mg/kg/day) dosing in humans (7530 ng.h/ml) was 
similar to that achieved at the highest oral dose level (10 mg/kg/day) in the rat 6 month study (8114 
ng.h/ml) and ~3-fold higher than that achieved at the high dose, 15 mg/kg/day, in the 9 month dog 
study (2273 ng.h/ml).  
Steady  state  AUC0-24  after  300  mg/day  dosing,  18782  ng.h  /ml,  was  consequently  higher  than  those 
determined in the 6 and 9 month studies.  
In the 6 months study in the rat, at the NOAEL (1 mg/kg/day), animals were 23.5 times less exposed 
(799 ng.h /ml) than human at 300 mg/day (18782 ng.h /ml).  In the 9 months study in the dog at 5 
mg/kg/day,  animals  are  18  times  less  exposed  (1 035  ng.h  /ml)  than  human  at  300  mg/day  (18782 
ng.h /ml). 
Local Tolerance 
No local tolerance studies have been submitted. 
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
Vandetanib  absorbs  light  in  the  wavelength  of  290-700  nm  and  a  phototoxic  potential  of  Vandetanib 
was demonstrated in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay.   
Impurities 
A  control  strategy  was  developed.  Some  impurities  (BNAN,  Aminodibenzyl,  Vandetanib  4-Amino  MA 
and 2, 4-Dibromo-6-fluoroaniline) were considered as not to be genotoxic; however, assays are not in 
compliance to international guidelines. For the other impurities, no assays were available (Vandetanib 
N-Formyl and Vandetanib t-Butyl).

No environmental risk has been identified as a consequence of the use of Vandetanib.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Vandetanib is a potent inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2 also known 
as  kinase  insert  domain  containing  receptor  [KDR]),  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)  and 
Rearranged  during  Transfection  (RET)  tyrosine  kinases.  Vandetanib  is  also  a sub-micromolar inhibitor 
of vascular endothelial receptor-3 tyrosine kinase. 
Vandetanib  inhibits  VEGF-stimulated  endothelial  cell  migration,  proliferation,  and  survival  and  new 
blood  vessel  formation  in  in  vitro  models  of  angiogenesis.  In  addition,  vandetanib  inhibits  epidermal 
growth  factor  (EGF)  -stimulated  EGF  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  in  tumour  cells  and  endothelial  cells. 
Vandetanib inhibits EGFR-dependent cell proliferation and cell survival in vitro. Vandetanib also inhibits 
both  wild  type  and  the  majorities  of  mutated,  activated  forms  of  RET,  and  significantly  inhibits  the 
proliferation of medullary thyroid tumour (MTC) cell lines in vitro. 
In  vivo  vandetanib  administration  reduced  tumour  cell-induced  angiogenesis,  tumour  vessel 
permeability, tumour microvessel density, and inhibited tumour growth of a range of human xenograft 
tumour  models  in  athymic  mice.  Vandetanib  also  inhibited  the  growth  of  MTC  xenograft  tumours  in 
vivo.The precise mechanism of action of vandetanib in locally advanced or metastatic MTC is unknown 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Vandetanib has shown no mutagenic or clastogenic potential. 
In  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  of  up  to  9 months  duration,  effects  included  emesis,  body  weight  loss 
and diarrhoea in dogs and physeal dysplasia in young dogs and rats with open growth plates. In rats, 
effects  on  teeth,  kidney  and  skin  were  noted.  These  findings  occurred  at  clinically-relevant  plasma 
concentrations, were largely reversible within 4 weeks of cessation of dosing and were attributable to 
inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) or EGFR.  
Effects noted in other studies included inhibition of human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) current 
and  prolongation  of  QTc  interval  in  dogs.  Elevation  of  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  were 
observed  in  rats  and  dogs.  In  mice,  vandetanib  was  shown  to  delay  but  not  prevent  wound  healing. 
Vandetanib also showed evidence of phototoxic potential in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay. In an animal 
model  of  wound-healing,  mice  dosed  with  vandetanib  had  reduced  skin-breaking  strength  compared 
with  controls.  This  suggests  that  vandetanib  slows  but  does  not  prevent  wound  healing.  The 
appropriate  interval  between  discontinuation  of  vandetanib  and  subsequent  elective  surgery  required 
to  avoid  the  risks  of  impaired  wound  healing  has  not  been  determined.  In  clinical  studies,  a  small 
number of patients had surgery while receiving vandetanib and there were no reported wound healing 
complications. 
Vandetanib had no effect on fertility in male rats. In a female fertility study, there was a trend towards 
increased  oestrus  cycle  irregularity,  a  slight  reduction  in  pregnancy  incidence  and  increase  in 
implantation  loss.  In  a  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  rats,  there  was  a  decrease  in  the  number  of 
corpora lutea in the ovaries of rats given vandetanib for 1 month. 
In  rats,  embryofoetal  toxicity  was  evident  as  foetal  loss,  delayed  foetal  development,  heart  vessel 
abnormalities  and  precocious  ossification  of  some  skull  bones.  In  a  rat  pre-  and  post-natal

development study, at doses producing maternal toxicity during gestation and/or lactation, vandetanib 
increased pre-birth loss and reduced post-natal pup growth. Vandetanib was excreted into milk in rat 
and found in plasma of pups following dosing to lactating rats. 
As  the  development  of  vandetanib  was  performed  only  by  oral  route,  which  is  the  clinical  route  of 
administration,  no  specific  local  tolerance  studies  were  performed.  In  line  with  ICH  S9,  no 
carcinogenicity studies have been conducted. 
Based  on  the  review  of  the  data  on  non  clinical  aspect,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  application  is 
approvable and requested the inclusion of the following statements in section 4.6 of the SmPC: 
  Women  of  childbearing  potential  must  use  effective  contraception  during  therapy  and  for  at 
least four months following the last dose. 
 
There is a limited amount of data on the use of vandetanib during pregnancy. Vandetanib has 
shown  significant  effects  on  all  stages  of  female  reproduction  in  rats.  If  vandetanib  is  used 
during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving vandetanib, she should be 
apprised of the potential for foetal abnormalities or loss of the pregnancy.  
 
There  are  no  data  on  the  use  of  vandetanib  in  breast-feeding  women.  Vandetanib  and/or  its 
metabolites  is  excreted  into  milk  in  rats  and  found  in  plasma  of  pups  following  dosing  to 
lactating rats. Breast-feeding is contraindicated while receiving vandetanib therapy (section 4.3 
and 4.6 of the SmPC).

Method of analysis 
All  assays  used  to  analyse  vandetanib  in  plasma  employed  LC-MS/MS  detection.  Assays  were  also 
validated for vandetanib and metabolites in plasma, urine and plasma ultra-filtrate (PUF).  
The calibration range for vandetanib in plasma was generally 5-1000 ng/mL, and for the metabolites 1-
200  ng/mL,  however,  there  were  considerable  variations  between  methods.  The  calibration  range  in 
urine was 100-50000 ng/mL and in PUF 1-200 ng/mL.

Bioavailability 
No studies have been submitted with intravenous administration of vandetanib.  
Bioequivalence 
A  number  of  formulations  have  been  utilised  throughout  the  clinical  development  of  vandetanib.  The 
commercial tablet formulation has been used in some Phase II studies and in all Phase III studies. No 
significant  difference  has  been  detected  between  the  Phase  I,  IIa  and  III  formulations.  Alterations  in 
particle  size,  process  and  formulation  did  not  translate  into  relevant  changes  in  exposure.  Moreover, 
the  similar  concentration  profile  of  the  solution  and  the  different  tablet  formulations  indicate  that  the 
absorption  pattern  of  vandetanib  is  not  dependent  on  dissolution,  and  therefore  the  formulation  has 
little impact. 
Influence of food 
Vandetanib  rate  and  extent  of  absorption  did  not  significantly  change  when  taken  with  a  high-fat 
breakfast (data not shown). 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution has not been determined in humans as no intravenous formulation has been 
developed.  In  patients,  vandetanib  was  approximately  93%  bound  to  plasma  proteins;  both  albumin 
and  α-1-acid-glycoprotein  bind  to  vandetanib.  The  plasma  protein  binding  of  the  N-desmethyl 
Assessment report  
Page 26/88
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
metabolite  is  similar  as  for  vandetanib,  and  the  binding  of  the  N-oxide  metabolite  could  not  be 
determined  due  to  analytical  difficulties.  Although  the  bioavailability  of  vandetanib  is  not  known,  the 
Vss/F indicates immense distribution into tissues, which is also confirmed in preclinical studies.  
Metabolism 
The  metabolism  of  14C-vandetinib  was  investigated  in  4  healthy  volunteers  (Study  25)  following  a 
single oral dose of 800 mg. Vandetanib represented 80% of the circulating radioactivity during the first 
day but this declined slowly with time. Due to the low radiochemical dose, long half-life of vandetanib 
and high volume of distribution, concentrations of radioactive material were low in plasma, urine and 
faeces. Using qualitative LC-MS, unchanged vandetanib and 2 known metabolites (vandetanib N-oxide 
and N-desmethyl vandetanib) were detected in plasma. N-desmethyl-vandetanib was found to be the 
major  circulating  metabolite  of  vandetanib;  relative  to  vandetanib,  the  exposure  to  N-desmethyl-
vandetanib  was  ~10  %  and  for  N-oxide-vandetanib  the  exposure  relative  to  vandetanib  was  <2% 
(studies  16,  22  and  26).  The  same  metabolites  were  found  in  both  urine  and  faeces,  where  an 
additional  minor  metabolite  was  also  present.  This  was  shown  by  mass  spectroscopy  to  be  a 
glucuronide conjugate. Using TLC, the ratio of vandetanib: N-desmethyl vandetanib excreted in faeces 
was estimated 5:1.  
Vandetanib  is  not  a  substrate  for  P-gp,  BCRP,  MRP1  or  OCT2.  Vandetanib  was  found  to  be  a  weak 
inhibitor  of  P-gp  and  BCRP,  although  at  concentrations  higher  than  what  are  expected  in  plasma. 
Vandetanib is also an inhibitor of OCT2, a transporter involved in the excretion of creatinine. 
Elimination 
Plasma  clearance  has  not  been  determined  in  humans  as  no  intravenous  formulation  has  been 
developed. CL/F is approximately 10 L/h, although highly variable.  
The elimination has not been fully elucidated, and no metabolite profiling was performed in the human 
mass balance study. Clearance of vandetanib occurs by metabolism and excretion in urine and faeces 
of unchanged vandetanib. Total recovery of radioactivity was 69% after 21 days and was still ongoing, 
which is caused by the slow elimination of vandetanib, and twice as much radioactivity was excreted in 
the  faeces  (44%)  compared  to  urinary  (25%)  excretion.  Qualitative  measurements  identified  N-
desmethyl-vandetanib  and  vandetanib-N-oxide  in  plasma  as  well  as  in  urine  and  faeces.  In  urine,  a 
glucorinide conjugate was also found. No quantitative results of the concentrations of the metabolites 
and  parent  compound  in  plasma,  urine  and  faeces  could  be  provided  from  the  mass  balance  study, 
which is considered a deficiency. However, due to the long half-life of vandetanib, only a low dose of 
radioactive material could be given, and thereby the concentration levels of the metabolites were too 
low  for  characterization.  The  approach  to  search  for  the  N-desmethyl  and  N-oxide  metabolites  was 
based on data from mass balance studies in the pre-clinical program.  
Urine  concentrations  were  determined  in  a  healthy  volunteer  study,  indicating  that  less  than  5%  is 
excreted in urine as unchanged drug over the first 72 h. This indicates that renal excretion is not the 
major route of elimination. Rather, the amount excreted unchanged in urine, in combination with the 
large  proportion  radioactive  material  found  in  faeces  indicated  that  metabolism  and  biliary  excretion 
are likely important mechanisms for vandetanib elimination.  
A long terminal elimination half-life (8-19 days) was observed in both single and multiple-dose studies, 
and  is  consistent  with  the  low  clearance  (8.7L/h)  of  vandetanib.  Longer  half  life  is  estimated  in  the 
target  patient  population  (MTC)  with  a  mean  T1/2  of  approximately  20  days  (4-85  days).  Such 
discrepancy is not clearly explained. The mean CL/F was approximately 10-13 L/h across studies.

Pharmacokinetics of Metabolites 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites of vandetanib has been investigated in healthy volunteers, in patients 
and subjects with renal and hepatic impairment. Due to the low systemic exposure, it is estimated that 
the  active  metabolite  N-desmethyl-vandetanib  contributes  only  a  relatively  small  proportion 
(approximately  10%)  of  the  overall  pharmacological  activity  of  vandetanib.  This  proportion  may 
increase up to 43% in patients co-administered CYP inducers such as rifampicin (Study 26), but is not 
changed in patients with renal impairment (Study 22) and may be decreased in patients with hepatic 
impairment (Study 16).  
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
In  healthy  volunteers,  the  pharmacokinetics  seemed  to  be  independent  of  dose  over  the  dose  range 
300-1200 mg single doses. There was no clear indication of non-proportionality in exposure in patients 
receiving  50  –  600  mg,  or  in  patients  receiving  100  mg  every  other  day  or  100  -300  mg  daily, 
although there were a limited number of patients in several of the dose groups. Also, the variability in 
exposure  between  patients  was  high,  which  could  possibly  mask  a  dose  dependency.  The 
pharmacokinetics of vandetanib seemed to be independent of time. In the population pharmacokinetics 
models, the estimates of the inter-individual variability were approximately 40% for CL/F and 50% for 
Vc/F.  
300 mg was selected as the dose with which to begin treatment in clinical studies. The rationale for the 
using  the  300  mg  dose  was  based  primarily  on:  (1)  preclinical  data,  which  demonstrated  that  the 
greatest  benefit  (in  terms  of  maximizing  inhibition  against  key  targets)  is  seen  when  vandetanib  is 
used at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), (2) the MTD of 300 mg being concluded from data in the 
Phase  I  ascending-dose  Study  D4200C00001  (Study  01)  and  the  corresponding  Phase  I  study  in 
Japanese  patients,  Study  D4200C00043  (Study  43),  and  (3)  in  Study  08,  the  phase  II  study  of 
vandetanib  in  hereditary  MTC  patients,  the  dosing  schema  of  beginning  treatment  with  vandetanib 
300mg allowing for dose reductions demonstrated that this was a safe and tolerable dosing plan.  
Intra- and Inter-individual variability 
The intra-subject variability following single oral dose of 300 mg vandetanib tablet under both fed and 
fasted  conditions  was  assessed  in  15  healthy  volunteers  using  a  replicate  design  (Study  24).  Intra-
subject  variability  in  exposure  to  vandetanib  was  found  to  be  small;  the  overall  estimate  for  intra-
subject variability was 8% for AUC and 11% for Cmax. In phase I studies inter-subject variability was 
typically approximately 30%. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Pharmacokinetics of vandetanib in patients with MTC was evaluated by popPK analyses.  The results 
are summarized in the table below.

The  PK  parameter  estimates  between  patients  and  healthy  volunteers  do  not  indicate  large  PK 
differences  between  patients  and  healthy  volunteers.  Estimated  elimination  half-life  (~18  days)  was 
longer in phase 3 popPK analysis than in the phase I studies (~ 8 days), in which elimination half-life 
was determined after single dose administration. Data across studies are comparable. 
Special Populations 
Population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  predicted  weight  as  covariates  of  vandetanib  clearance  and 
volume  of  distribution.  The  mean  estimated  clearance  for  median  weight  (68  kg)  was  13.2  ±  0.306 
L.h-1.  A  steady-state  AUC  on  Day  56  of  13.75  μg.h/mL  (27%  lower  than  the  median  of  all  subjects 
that received 300 mg up to Day 56) is estimated for the heaviest patient with a body weight of 125 kg. 
This  exposure  is  greater  than  the  threshold  for  a  probability  of  stable  disease  to  be  50%  (7.05 
μg.h/mL) as estimated by the response analysis. The estimated weight effect is, however, modest and 
no dose adjustment for weight is necessary.  
Pharmacokinetics  of  vandetanib  was  not  different in  Caucasian and  Oriental patients  (Studies  01,  43, 
04,  58).  Gender  and  age  (Study  58)  had  no  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  vandetanib. 
Pharmacokinetics of vandetanib has not been studied in children.  
A  study  in  renally  impaired  subjects  indicated  a  clear  trend  towards  higher  exposure  with  decreased 
renal  function.  Unbound  vandetanib  concentrations  were  on  average  16%,  46%  and  57%  higher  in 
subjects  with  mild,  moderate  and  severe  renal  impairment.  Adequate  recommendations  have  been 
introduced in the SmPC regarding the use of vandetanib (not recommended) in patients with moderate 
or severe renal insufficiency for whom very limited data are available with the proposed 300 mg dose 
(and none with other doses) in patients with MTC. 
In  a  study  with  hepatically  impaired  patients  without  tumours  in  the  liver,  there  was  no  increase  in 
AUC  or  Cmax  in  patients  with  mild,  moderate  or  severe  hepatic  impairment,  but  rather  a  slight 
decrease.  The  AUC  and  Cmax  of  the  N-desmethyl  metabolite  were  decreased  in  hepatic  impairment, 
while the AUC and C max of the N-oxide were increased.  
Pharmacokinetic Interaction Studies 
The effect of inhibition of CYP3A4 by itraconazole was assessed in healthy volunteers in Study 15. The 
9% increase in exposure (AUC0-504h) was not considered to be clinically meaningful.  
The  effect  of  induction  of  CYP3A4  by  rifampicin  was  assessed  in  healthy  volunteers  in  Study  26.  The 
estimate  of  the  treatment  ratio  for  vandetanib  AUC0-504h  indicates  a  statistically  significant  39.9% 
reduction, when taken in combination with rifampicin, compared with vandetanib alone. The presence 
or absence of rifampicin did not significantly influence the Cmax.  
The  metabolite  formed  by  CYP3A4  metabolism  has  been  identified  as  N-desmethylvandetanib  and 
consistent  with  induction  of  CYP3A4,  there  was  a  266%  increase  in  the  exposure  (AUC)  to  this 
metabolite  when  vandetanib  was,  in  combination  with  rifampicin  compared  to  vandetanib  alone  and 
Assessment report  
Page 29/88
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
the  exposure  relative  to  vandetanib  increased  from  about  7%  to  43%.  Levels  of  vandetanib-N-oxide 
were low and did not allow the determination of the AUC0-504h. However, compared with vandetanib 
alone, the AUC determined to a common time t increased  by about 100%  and Cmax by about 175% 
when  vandetanib  was  given  in  combination  with  rifampicin  and  the  exposure  relative  to  vandetanib 
showed a small increase from approximately 1.5% to approximately 2%.  
Vandetanib exhibit pH dependent solubility: high solubility at low pH and low solubility at neutral pH. 
At  pH  6.8  solubility  of  vandetanib  is  0.35  mg/ml.  No  further  data  on  vandetanib  solubility  has  been 
submitted  at  different  pH  and  notably  under  a  value  of  6.8.  As  proton-pump  inhibitors  and  H2-
antihistamines increase gastric pH until 5-6, one cannot exclude that this solubility could be affected.   
S-warfarin (the pharmacologically more active enantiomer) is metabolized by CYP2C9 and R-warfarin is 
metabolized principally by CYP1A2 and to a lesser degree by CYP3A4. Vandetanib has been shown to 
have a moderate potential to inhibit these iso-enzymes.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics  
Mechanism of action 
The role of vandetanib as a selective inhibitor of VEGF, EGFR and RET has been described in the non-
clinical section of this report.  In addition to this, clinical studies supporting the involvement of VEGFR 
and EGFR in the anti-cancer activity of vandetanib are described in the primary pharmacology section 
below. 
Primary and Secondary Pharmacology 
See Secondary Endpoints, Pharmacodynamic parameters pertinent for activity in the MTC setting. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
There  is  a  scientific  rationale  in  MTC  for  vandetanib  which  targets  two  separate  aspects  of  cancer  by 
directly inhibiting EGFR and/or RET dependent tumour growth and indirectly inhibiting tumour growth 
through antiangiogenic effects on endothelial cell proliferation, migration and survival.  
The  long  half-life  of  vandetanib  is  unfavourable  for  a  drug  which  is  to  be  dose  adjusted  based  on 
adverse  events,  especially  with  regard  to  serious  concerns  about  the  safety  profile,  including  marked 
QT  prolongation  (and  clinical  consequences)  and  potential  deterioration  of  renal  function,  as  high 
concentrations  will  remain  for  months  after  cessation  of  the  drug.  Conventional  studies  and  popPK 
analysis indicated a low intra- and moderate to high inter-subject variability of vandetanib.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics  of  vandetanib  and  metabolites  have  been  adequately  investigated.  Following  single 
oral  dose  of  vandetanib  absorption  appeared  to  be  relatively  slow  with  Cmax  achieved  at  a  median 
Tmax of 6 h and vandetanib is slowly cleared from the plasma (8.7 L/h) and is characterised by a long 
plasma  half-life  of  8-18  days.  Consistent  with  the  long  half-life,  once  daily  oral  administration  of  100 
mg or 300 mg resulted in approximately 10-fold accumulation from single dose to steady-state levels.  
Assessment report  
Page 30/88
 
 
 
 
   
 
A  pharmacokinetic  study  in  volunteers  with  mild,  moderate  and  severe  renal  impairment  shows  that 
exposure to vandetanib after single dose is increased up to 1.5, 1.6 and 2-fold respectively in patients 
with mild, moderate (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 to < 50 ml/min) and severe (clearance below 30 l/min) 
renal  impairment  at  baseline  (see  section 5.2  of  the  SmPC).  Clinical  data  suggest  that  no  change  in 
starting dose is required in patients with mild renal impairment. There is limited data with 300 mg in 
patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment:  discontinuation  for  AEs  in  5/6  pts.  The  starting  dose  could 
be reduced to 200 mg in patients with moderate renal impairment; safety and efficacy have however 
not been established with 200 mg (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). Vandetanib is not recommended for 
use  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  since  there  is  limited  data  in  patients  with  severe  renal 
impairment, and safety and efficacy have not been established.  
Vandetanib is a weak inhibitor of the efflux pump P-gp.  The co-administration of vandetanib and drugs 
excreted  by  P-gp,  such  as  digoxin,  may  result  in  increased  plasma  concentrations  of  these  drugs.  
Patients  receiving  digoxin  and  vandetanib  may  require  increased  digoxin  blood  level  monitoring  and 
appropriate  dosage  adjustments.  The  applicant  has  planned  to  study  the  interaction  between 
vandetanib and digoxin further. 
Vandetanib  is  an inhibitor  of  the  OCT2  transporter.    Therefore, vandetanib  may  have  the  potential  to 
decrease the elimination of drugs known to be excreted by OCT2 and to increase a patient’s exposure 
to  these  drugs.    Metformin  is  a  substrate  of  OCT2;  patients  who  are  receiving  vandetanib  and 
metformin  (or  other  substrates  of  OCT2)  may  require  more  careful  monitoring  and  possible  dose 
adjustment of metformin. The applicant has planned to study the interaction between vandetanib and 
metformin further. 
The  effect  of  proton  pump  inhibitors  and  H2  antagonists  on  the  gastrointestinal  absorption  of 
vandetanib  has  not  been  determined.    Vandetanib  demonstrates  pH-dependent  solubility;  therefore, 
the  co-administration  of  vandetanib  with  proton  pump  inhibitors  and  H2  antagonists  may  reduce  a 
patient’s exposure to vandetanib. The concomitant use with these therapeutic classes is therefore not 
recommended (see section 4.4 of the SmPC) 
The  co-administration  of  vandetanib  with  proton  pump  inhibitors  and  H2  antagonists  may  reduce  a 
patient’s exposure to vandetanib. Therefore, the applicant has planned to study this interaction further. 
Vandetanib has the potential to induce the CYP3A4 enzyme system.  Co-administration of vandetanib 
and  drugs  primarily  metabolised  by  the  CYP3A4  enzyme  system  may  result  in  decreased  plasma 
concentrations of these drugs that could reduce or shorten therapeutic effects.  Therefore, appropriate 
dosage  adjustments  may  be  required.  The  applicant  has  planned  to  study  the  interaction  between 
vandetanib and midazolam further. 
The above mentioned drug-drug interaction studies are covered in the RMP. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy submission in MTC is based on one pivotal study (Study 58) with vandetanib 300 
mg daily and is supported by two phase II uncontrolled studies performed with different dose regimen 
100 mg (study 068) and 300 mg daily (study 008) in patients with MTC.  
A  recently  completed  study  (Study  D4200C00079  [Study  79])  was  performed  in  patients  with 
differentiated  thyroid  cancer  and  the  preliminary  results  are  also  presented  in  the  Applicant’s 
documentation. A list of clinical efficacy studies submitted is presented in the table below.

evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of vandetanib (300 mg daily) in 30 patients with hereditary locally 
advanced or metastatic MTC. 
The  ORR  was  20.0%  (6/30)  (complete  (CR)  or  partial  response  (PR)  based  on  primary  site-read 
assessment based on RECIST). By independent assessment there were 5 (16.7%) of patients who had 
an  OR  (modified  RECIST  criteria).  Median  PFS  was  27.9  months.  The  median  duration  of  response 
(DOR)  from  first  response  until  progression  or  death  was  10.2  months,  and  from  first  dose  until 
progression or death was 18.5 months.  
D4200C00068 
Study  068  was  a  single-arm,  open-label,  uncontrolled,  monotherapy  Phase  II  study  conducted  to 
evaluate  the  efficacy  and  tolerability  of  vandetanib  (100mg)  in  19  patients  with  hereditary  locally 
advanced or metastatic MTC. 
The ORR (RECIST criteria, based on site-read assessment) was 15.8% (3/19) with 95% CI [3.4; 39.6].  
The median DOR from the onset of response was 5.5 months

Assessment report  
Page 34/88
 
 
   
 
- placebo 300mg once daily oral dose 
until they had objective disease progression, provided they did not meet any other withdrawal criteria.  
Upon disease progression, patients were discontinued from blinded study treatment and given the 
option to begin open label treatment with vandetanib 300 mg (or receive a permanently reduced dose, 
if applicable), or enter follow-up for survival status. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
 
To demonstrate an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with vandetanib as compared 
to placebo in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer 
(MTC). 
Secondary objectives: 
 
To demonstrate an improvement in the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), 
and duration of response (DOR) with vandetanib as compared to placebo 
 
To demonstrate an improvement in the overall survival (OS) in patients with MTC who have been 
treated with vandetanib as compared to placebo 
 
To demonstrate an improvement in biochemical response with vandetanib as compared to 
placebo, as measured by calcitonin (CTN) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 
 
To demonstrate a delay in time to worsening of pain (TWP) among patients with MTC after 
treatment with vandetanib as compared to placebo 


any influence of patient demography and pathophysiology on the PK 
 
To assess the relationship between PK and time interval between the start of the Q wave and the 
end of the T wave, (corrected for heart rate) (QTc), safety, efficacy, and biomarkers 
 
 
To determine the safety and tolerability of vandetanib treatment in MTC patients 
To determine the mutational status of the rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene in 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted from tumour samples 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint  
 
Progression-free  survival  (PFS),  defined  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the  date  of  objective 
progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), provided death was within 3 
months  from  the  last  evaluable  RECIST  assessment,  using  data  from  RECIST    assessments 
performed  at  baseline,  during  treatment  and  during  the  follow-up  period.  The  PFS  assessment 
was based on an independent radiological review. 
Secondary endpoints 
  Secondary efficacy endpoints included overall Respose Rate (ORR) by RECIST, overall survival 
(OS) and biochemical response rate: CTN and CEA.

Sample size 
Assuming 2:1 randomisation (vandetanib: placebo), to detect a doubling of PFS at the 2-sided alpha= 
.050 level with 80% power, at least 90 events were required. Assuming a median PFS of 12 months in 
the control group, a non-linear recruitment period of 22 months, and a minimum follow-up of 6.7 
months, at least 232 patients were to be recruited for the study, i.e., the total length of the study was 
estimated to be 28.7 months to observe 90 progression events. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were to be randomized strictly sequentially in a 2:1 ratio.  
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blind.  
Statistical methods 
Primary endpoint analysis 
The primary analysis was based on an ITT analysis of PFS data derived from all available modified 
RECIST assessments, which included any available information on central read RECIST scans 
performed whilst on randomised treatment, after discontinuation of randomised treatment and after 
first dose of open label treatment.   
A log-rank test was planned for the primary analysis of PFS (unadjusted model with treatment factor 
only).

A medical history of previous thyroidectomy was noted in 90.3% of patients, diarrhoea in 45.0%, and fatigue in 
15.4%. 
RET  mutation  status  was  determined  to  be  positive  in  187  (56.5%)  patients,  negative  in  8  patients 
(2.4%),  and  unknown  in  136  (41.1%)  patients.  Thus,  while  all  but  2  patients  provided  an  archived 
tumour sample for RET mutation analysis, the complete mutation analysis comprising the ARMS assay 
for M918T and the 6-exon sequencing was not successful for all patients, suggesting that the quality of 
the archived samples may have been inadequate for the comprehensive sequencing analyses. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 331 patients were randomised to receive treatment in this study (231 in the vandetanib arm 
and 100 in the placebo arm) and were included in the Full Analysis Set. One patient randomised to 
receive placebo never received any study treatment, therefore, the safety analysis set included 330 
patients.

The median PFS in the placebo group was 19.3 months. The median PFS in the vandetanib group could 
not  be  calculated  (because  of  an  insufficient  number  of  PFS  events);  a  Weibull  model  was  used  to 
estimate the median PFS in the 2 treatment arms: the predicted median PFS for the vandetanib arm is 
30.5 months.

PFS  was  derived  from  all  available  central  read  RECIST  assessments.  Prior  therapy  refers  to  systemic  anti-cancer 
therapy for MTC taken prior to the first dose of randomised treatment. A response to prior therapy is defined as a 
BOR of CR or PR to the most recent prior therapy. No response to prior therapy is defined as a BOR of SD or PD to 
the most recent prior therapy. 
The superiority of vandetanib over placebo is consistent across all pre planned subgroups, even if not 
significant in all of them. No HR is greater than 1. 
Most patients (all but 18 patients) had either progressive disease or symptoms at baseline (12 patients 
without progression and without symptoms and 6 patients with unknown progressive status and 
without symptoms); 25 patients were only symptomatic; 64 patients had only progressive disease; 
186 patients had symptomatic and progressive disease. 307 patients were known to be progressive or 
symptomatic.

ORR by site read assessment (excluding the open label period) was respectively 39% vs. 2.0%. None 
of the patients had complete response; the absence of response was due to stable disease in 
respectively 49.4% and 70% of the patients and disease progression 3.9% and 13.0% of the patients 
in the vandetanib and placebo treatment groups.  
Median DOR could not be calculated for either group. 
OS 
Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier plot of OS (ITT) 
No significant positive effect of vandetanib over placebo has been demonstrated on OS: HR 
of  0.89  (0.28,  2.85).  In  MTC  setting,  even  at  metastatic  stage,  OS  is  fair;  one  should  also 
note  that  open  label  use  of  vandetanib  was  allowed  after  progression  and  cross-over  from 
placebo (randomised treatment) to open label vandetanib was chosen in 58 of the 100 ITT 
placebo patients. 
Time to worsening of pain (Patient reported outcome) and other secondary endpoints 
There was an improvement in TWP (derived using the worst pain score from BPI and patient reported 
analgesic use) for vandetanib compared with placebo: HR 0.61, 95% CI (0.43, 0.87), p=0.0062; this 
was  confirmed  by  sensitivity  analyses  that  used  the  Cox  proportional  hazards.  The  median  time  to 
deterioration in worsening of pain was 7.85 months vs. 3.25 months in the placebo arm.  
There were no observed differences between treatment groups for most exploratory variables such as 
time to deterioration in WHO PS [32.5 % vs. 34.0 %, HR 0.74, 95% CI (0.48, 1.14), p=0.1654, stool 
frequency,  FACT_G  score,  or  opioid  analgesic  medication  use  [OR  2.78,  95%  CI  0.77  to  10.80, 
p=0.1193]. 
There was an improvement in weight in the vandetanib arm compared to the placebo arm [28.6% vs. 
11%, OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.69 to 6.76, p=0.0003].

Data  from  Study  58  are  described  in  the  figure  below  with  regard  to  effect  of  vandetanib  on 
biochemical response rate (CTN and CEA), according to RET status and other biomarkers.

pg/ml at baseline.)  
RET mutation status 
RET mutation status was determined by sequencing the 6 most commonly mutated exons in MTC (10, 
11,  13,  14,  15,  and  16)  and  by  evaluating  for  the  M918T  mutation  using  an  amplification  refractory 
mutation  system  (ARMS)  analysis  as  there  is  no  standard  or  routine  practices  for  how  to  test  for 
somatic RET mutations in the tumours of patients with advanced MTC. 
A RET positive mutation status was defined as having a mutation either observed from the sequencing 
or ARMS assay. RET mutation negative status was defined as having the sequencing assay successfully 
showing  wild  type  sequence  at  all  6  exons,  and  the  ARMS  assay  negative  for  a  M918T  mutation. 
Unknown  RET  mutation  status  was  documented  when  1  or  more  sequencing  assay  was  unsuccessful 
(non-informative), and none of the successful assays demonstrated a mutation. 
All  patients  included  in  the  phase  II  supportive  trials  (Studies  08  and  68)  had  hereditary  MTC, 
documented as RET positive in all patients in study 08 and RET positive in 17/19 and unknown in 2/19 
in study 68.  
Patients included in the pivotal phase III trial (Study 58) had either sporadic or hereditary MTC. Out of 
331 patients, 287 (86.7%) had sporadic MTC, 33 (10.0%) patients had hereditary MTC (more, n=28 in 
the vandetanib vs. n=5 in the placebo group), and 11 (3.3%) patients had unknown status. Diagnosis 
of  hereditary  MTC  was  based  on  family  history  if  RET  mutation  status  was  unavailable.  Patients  with 
hereditary  MTC  who  had  a  documented  germline  mutation  in  RET  were  not  required  to  provide  a 
mandatory tumour collection sample. All patients with sporadic MTC had to submit a suitable archived 
tumour sample before randomisation.  
Study  058  initially  had  a  co-primary  analysis  population  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  vandetanib  in 
patients  with  a  RET  mutation  as  well  as  in  the  overall  population  which  was  removed  when  the  RET 
could  not  be  determined  for  a  major  proportion  of  patients  after  completion  of  recruitment.

Measurement of RET mutation status in the RET proto-oncogene was (after amendment) a secondary 
objective and was performed on a tumour samples from all patients who did not have a documented 
germline RET mutation.   
RET mutation was positive in 187 (56.5%) patients, unknown in 138 (41.1%), and shown negative in 
only  8  patients  (2.4%),  including  2  patients  in  the  vandetanib  group.  At  12  months,  the  progression 
rate (vandetanib vs. placebo) was 34.3 % (47/137) vs. 54.0 % (27/50) in patients with RET + status, 
27.2 % (25/92) vs. 43.2 % (19/44) in patients with RET unknown status and 50.0 % (1/2) vs. 83.3 % 
(5/6) in patients with RET – status, respectively.  
Correlation between RET mutation status and clinical outcome could not be clearly evaluated in study 
58 because in 41.1%% of patients in study 58 RET mutation status was unknown.

RET mutation positive hereditary and sporadic MTC patients 
Following a post-hoc analysis, efficacy endpoints were studied for seventy nine patients. These patients 
were identified as without M918T mutation and with no other RET mutation (71 patients  with sporadic 
MTC    previously  classified  as  RET  mutation  “unknown”  and  8  patients  with  sporadic  MTC  previously 
classified  as  RET  mutation  “negative  “).  Forty  six  patients  were  randomised  to  vandetanib  and  33 
patients  to  placebo.    Table  12  compares  the  efficacy  analysis  observed  in  RET  mutation  positive 
patients  versus  RET  mutation  negative  patients  (defined  as  having  no  mutation  at  the  most  common 
site of RET mutation (M918T) and no other RET mutation identified)  
For vandetanib in ‘RET mutation negative’ patients, the ORR was 35% [16 /46,] versus 52%.  Absolute 
difference  was  17%,  and  relative  difference  was  33%.  Vandetanib  is  suggested  to  prolong  PFS 
compared to placebo in that subgroup, with a HR for PFS of 0.57 [95% CI 0.29-1.13].  The results are 
not significant in the RET negative patients as the higher bound of the 95% CI is over 1 (1.13) and the 
HR for PFS is lower in RET mutation negative’ patients as defined above as compared with RET positive 
patients  [HR  for  PFS  =0.45  95%  CI  0.26-0.78].  Duration  of  response  is  18  months  instead  of  22 
months (absolute difference 4 months, relative difference 18 % shorter).Predicted mean PFS is similar 
(29 vs. 28) and longer than placebo (18 months). 
Biochemical response rate: CTN and CEA  
Biochemical response rate (CTN and CEA), markers of activity of vandetanib in MTC, were evaluated as 
secondary efficacy endpoints in the 3 clinical studies in MTC, the open phase II (Study 08 and 68) and 
in  the  pivotal  phase  II-III  study  vs.  placebo  (Study  58)  as  percentage  of  patients  with  a  best 
biochemical response (respectively CTN / CEA) of CR or PR.  CR was defined as complete normalization 
of the CTN level (≤10 pg/ml for men and ≤5 pg/ml for women) /CEA level (2.5 pg/ml) confirmed by a 
Assessment report  
Page 45/88
 
 
 
 
   
 
repeat assessment > 4 weeks later. PR was define as decrease in the CTN/CEA level of at least 50% 
from baseline confirmed by a repeat assessment > 4 weeks later. 
In the phase II study (Study 08) with vandetanib 300 mg, CTN response was observed in 80% (24/30) 
of patients and CEA response in 53% (16/30) of patients.  In the phase II study with vandetanib 100 
mg  (68),  CTN  response  was  observed  in  15.8%  of  patients  (3/19  patients)  who  experienced  a 
reduction  in  CTN  of  at  least  50%  that  was  sustained  for  at  least  4  weeks;  5.3  %  of  patients  (1/19 
patients) experienced a reduction in CEA of at least 50% from baseline that was sustained for at least 
4 weeks.  
In  the  pivotal  phase  II-III  study  (58),  there  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  between 
vandetanib and placebo arm for both CTN and CEA response: 
  CTN (CR plus PR): OR 72.86, 95% CI (26.22, 303.2), p<0.0001  
  CEA (CR plus PR): OR 52.03, 95% CI (15.95, 320.3), p<0.0001. 
CTN doubling time ≤ 24 months and CEA doubling time ≤24 months are known to be markers of poor 
prognosis  and  more  aggressive  disease.  In  study  58,  the  efficacy  of  vandetanib  on  PFS  was  more 
marked in comparison with placebo in patients with CTN doubling time ≤ 24 months and CEA doubling 
time ≤24 months (statistically significant difference versus placebo in these subgroups).  
Forest  plots  of  subgroup  analyses  for  PFS  (according  to  baseline  characteristics,  disease  status  and 
biomarkers) have been submitted. As the global interaction test was not statistically significant at the 
1%  level  (p=0.177),  unplanned  post  hoc  individual  interaction  tests  were  performed  with  a  10% 
significance level for all factors included in the forest plots. 
The  percentage  of  patients  with  ORR  was  higher  in  patients  with  CEA  doubling  time  ≤24  months  at 
baseline  compared  with  CEA  doubling  time  >24  months:  53.6%  versus  37  %  respectively.    The 
percentage of patients with ORR was higher in patients with CTN doubling time ≤24 months at baseline 
compared  with  CTN  doubling 
time  >24  months:  46.8%  vs.  39.8  % 
respectively.   
CEA  and  CTN  doubling  times  and  tumor  size  have  been  linked  to  the  rate  of  objective  progression  in 
MTC.  HR  for  PFS  was  in  favour  of  vandetanib  in  patients  with  tumor  size  <10  cm  and  ≥  10  cm,  but 
seems somewhat better in patients with the largest tumors≥ 10 cm.  
A significant effect on PFS was demonstrated in patients with tumor size ≥ 10 cm at baseline but not in 
patients with tumor size <10 cm .

Clinical studies in special populations 
Preliminary dose-finding and safety results of Study 79 in 6 paediatric patients with hereditary MTC 
were reported, with objective response in 5 patients. 
Supportive studies 
Preliminary  results  of  a  phase  II,  placebo  controlled  randomised  study  (study  79)  of  vandetanib  300 
mg in 145 patients with locally advanced or metastatic papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma failing 
or  unsuitable  for  radioiodine  therapy  found  a  HR  of  0.62  (0.43,0.92),  p=0.017    on  the  primary 
endpoint PFS without any significant difference on the secondary endpoints. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical efficacy in the present submission is based on a pivotal study (Study 58) with vandetanib 
300  mg  daily.    Study  58  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  comparing  the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  vandetanib  versus  placebo  in  patients  with  unresectable  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic MTC.  
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  demonstrate  an  improvement  in  progression-free  survival 
(PFS)  with  vandetanib  as  compared  to  placebo  in  patients  with  unresectable  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic  MTC.    A  total  of  331  patients  were  randomized  (2:1)  to  receive  vandetanib  300  mg  once 
daily (231 patients) or placebo (100 patients).  
There was no substantial imbalance between treatment arms with respect to demographic and baseline 
characteristics, with the exception of age. Of 331 patients, 287 (86.7%) had sporadic MTC, 33 (10.0%) 
patients  had  hereditary  MTC,  and  11  (3.3%)  patients  had  unknown  status.  The  patients  who 
participated  in  this  study  were  generally  representative  of  a  population  of  patients  with  unresectable 
locally  advanced  or  metastatic  MTC  population,  and  their  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics 
generally  resembled  those  in  the  target  population.  There  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  at 
baseline in the % of patients <40 years of age in the vandetanib and placebo group, p=0.02. Age was 
not a pre-planned subgroup analysis for efficacy data. 
A significant increase in PFS versus placebo on the primary analysis (HR=0.46, 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.69, 
p=0.0001) was observed. The predicted median PFS (Weibull model) for the vandetanib arm was 30.5 
months,  which  is  approximately  an  11-month  delay  for  the  vandetanib  arm  when  compared  with  the 
Assessment report  
Page 48/88
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
19.3  months  median  PFS  in  the  placebo  arm.  The  gain  in  PFS  was  maintained  over  time.  Post-hoc 
sensitivity analysis of PFS adjusting for CTN and for CEA at baseline were performed and did not show 
any  influence  of  baseline  imbalance  in  CTN  values  and  CEA  values.    Except  for  response  in  terms  of 
CEA  doubling  time,  the  superiority  of  vandetanib  over  placebo  on  PFS  was  consistent  across  all  pre 
planned subgroups, even if not significant in all of them.  
The results observed on PFS were supported by results on some secondary endpoints such as ORR (45 
% vs. 13.0 %, OR 5.48 (2.99, 10.79), <0.0001 for the primary analysis). The results on biochemical 
response  also  supported  the  primary  endpoint.  For  CTN  OR  =  72.86,  95%  CI  of  26.22,  303.2; 
p<0.0001  and  for  CEA  OR  =  52.03;  95%  CI  of  15.95,  320.3;  p<0.0001  with  more  marked  effect  of 
vandetanib  on  PFS  in  patients  with  more  aggressive  stage  of  the  disease  characterised  by  CTN 
doubling  time  ≤  24  months  and  CEA  doubling  time  ≤24  months.  No  significant  positive  effect  of 
vandetanib over placebo has been demonstrated on OS: HR of 0.89 (0.28, 2.85). It is likely that it will 
not  be  possible  (even  with  more  mature  data)  to  establish  a  long  term  survival  outcome  from  the 
pivotal study and this could be in part caused by the open label use of vandetanib after progression on 
randomised treatment. Because of the proposed cross-over at progression, the OS comparison in fact 
compares  populations  that  differ  mainly  by  the  fact  that  vandetanib  has  been  proposed  early 
(experimental group) or later on, at progression (placebo arm). 
95% of the study population had metastases at baseline. Because of the very small number of patients 
without metastasis treated with vandetanib (14 patients only), no firm conclusion can be made about 
efficacy and B/R in patients without metastasis. 
Following the SAG’s advice, the indication was revised to include aggressive and symptomatic disease. 
The  choice  of  ‘aggressive’  instead  of  ‘progressive’  was  justified  by  the  fact  that  the  term  of 
“progressive”  remains  ambiguous  (RECIST  progression  as  in  the  primary  criteria  or  including  clinical, 
RX and biological criteria) and the term “aggressive” is likely to address  patients condition with rapid 
deterioration, for whom an urgent treatment is required. 
Only  6  patients  with  moderate  renal  failure  were  randomised  to  vandetanib  (1  with  severe  renal 
impairment, NI criteria). These 6 patients were initially treated with 300 mg but the dose was reduced 
for AEs in 5/6 patients to 200 mg and further to 100 mg in 1 patients. The safe and effective dose in 
patients  with  moderate  or  severe  renal  failure  has  not  been  established  (see  sections  4.2  and  4.4  of 
the SmPC).  
At present optimal duration of treatment remains unclear and should be left to the clinical evaluation 
and decision of the treating physician. A dose-finding study analyzing the safety and activity of 150mg 
vs 300mg due to be completed in July 2014 will address this issue (see section on Pharmacovigilance). 
RET mutation status 
The activity of vandetanib in RET mutation negative patients is indirectly supported by the activity of 
the  drug  observed  in  the  subgroup  of  138  patients  in  Study  58  whose  RET  status  could  not  be 
successfully  established.  In  the  vandetanib  arm,  PFS  at  12  months  for  this  subgroup  of  patients  was 
27.2 % compared to 34.3 % in patients with RET + status. 
In a post-hoc analysis,  further data from 71 patients  previously classified as RET mutation “unknown” 
and  8  patients  previously  classified  as  RET  mutation  “negative”  showed  efficacy  (see  Table  12)  
Therefore,  the  available  evidence  suggests  but  does  not  fully  confirm  efficacy  of  vandetanib  in  RET 
negative tumours. 
Assessment report  
Page 49/88
 
 
 
 
   
 
Moreover,  it  is  not  certain  that  those  patients  tested  RET  negative  in  the  post-hoc  analysis  are  not 
positive for mutation on other exons. It is equally not certain that those patients tested RET negative 
from old tumour sample were still RET negative at the time of initiation of treatment. Therefore, it is 
difficult to draw an unequivocal conclusion of the size of the benefit of vandetanib in patients with RET 
mutation negative tumours.  
Given that the precise mechanism of action of vandetanib in RET remains unclear, the absolute benefit 
in  these  patients  should  be  more  precisely/directly  determined.  A  conditional  marketing  authorisation 
was  thus  recommended,  taking  into  consideration  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  vandetanib,  as 
defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 2001/83/EC, is positive, to gather the missing information. 
In the framework of the conditional marketing authorisation,, given the need to confirm the benefit risk 
balance in RET negative patients, the following statements were included in the Product Information: 
 
In  section  4.1  of  the  SmPC:  “'For  patients  in  whom  Rearranged  during  Transfection  (RET) 
mutation  is  not  known  or  is  negative,  a  possible  lower  benefit  should  be  taken  into  account 
before individual treatment decision (see important information in sections 4.4 and 5.1) 
 
In  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC:  “Patients  without  RET  mutation  may  have  a  decreased  benefit 
from  vandetanib  treatment  and  the  benefit/risk  balance  for  this  group  of  patients  may 
therefore  differ  from  that  of  the  group  with  RET  mutations.  For  patients  whose  RET  mutation 
status  could  be  negative,  a  possible  lower  benefit  should  be  taken  into  account  before 
individual  treatment  decisions  and  the  use  of  vandetanib  should  be  carefully  considered 
because of the treatment related risks. Therefore RET mutation testing is recommended. When 
establishing RET mutation status, tissue samples should be obtained if possible at the time of 
initiation of treatment rather than at the time of diagnosis (see sections 4.1 and 5.1) 
 
In  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC:  “In  Study  58,  RET  mutation  testing  was  performed  by  using  the 
polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  based  Amplification  Refractory  Mutation  System  (ARMS) 
assay  for  the  M918T  mutation,  and  direct  sequencing  of  DNA  for  mutations  in  exons  10,  11, 
13, 14, 15 and 16 (site of M918T mutation) on all sporadic patients where DNA was available 
(297/298).  
However,  RET  status  could  not  be  tested  in  a  large  proportion  of  patients  (mainly  because  of 
unavailable results for direct sequencing of DNA) and response rate was somewhat lower in the 
patients  with  unknown  RET  status  compared  with  RET  mutation  positive  status:  51.8%  vs. 
35.9  %  respectively.  In  the  blinded  comparison  of  vandetanib  vs.  placebo,  only  2  patients 
known  to  be  RET  negative  at  all  6  exons  received  vandetanib  and  none  demonstrated 
responses. 
A post-hoc subgroup analysis of RET negative status based on absence of M918T mutation of 
the pivotal study 58 was performed. A patient was considered to have a RET mutation if either 
an  M918T  mutation  by  the  ARMS  assay,  or  a  RET  mutation  in  any  exons  sequenced  was 
present in the tumour. Actually 79 patients were identified by absence of an M918T mutation 
and  no  RET  mutation  identified  at  any  of  the  other  6  exons  tested  but  in  71  of  such  patients 
sequencing  of  the  6  exons  was  incomplete.  M918T  mutation  is  the  most  frequent  mutation 
observed  inpatients  with  sporadic  MTC;  however  it  cannot  be  ruled  out  that  some  patients 
tested RET negative for M918T mutation might be positive for mutation on other exons.

Results according to RET status (positive, unknown and RET M918T mutation negative 
definition) are presented in Table 3, Section 5.1 of the SmPC.

Additional expert consultation 
The SAG was requested to define the restricted population of patients in whom the absolute benefit in 
terms of progression prevention would compensate for the overall safety profile of vandetanib and to 
comment  on  whether  other  possible  methods  as  FISH  or  RNA  studies  would  be  more  sensitive  and 
specific to determine RET status.  
In  view  of  the  associated  risks,  the  SAG  considered  that  it  was  important  to  limit  treatment  with 
vandetanib  to  patients  who  are  in  real  need  for  treatment.  This  can  be  established  based  on  clinical 
and biological criteria. From a clinical point of view, this corresponds to patients that can be identified 
as having a symptomatic-aggressive course of the disease. Either symptomatic disease or progressive 
disease  alone  is  not  enough  to  prompt  the  need  for  treatment  with  vandetanib.  Rate  of  change  in 
biomarker  levels  such  as  of  calcitonin  and/or  CEA  as  well  as  the  rate  of  change  of  tumour  volume 
during  watchful  waiting  might  help  to  identify  not  only  patients  in  need  for  treatment  but  also  the 
optimal  moment  to  commence  the  treatment.  Similarly,  imaging  data  alone  is  not  expected  to  be 
useful  in  identifying  patients  in  need  for  treatment.  From  a  biological  point  of  view,  the  efficacy  of 
vandetanib  has  been  established  only in  patients  with  RET  mutation-positive  tumours.  The  efficacy  is 
unknown in RET mutation-negative tumours. Further studies are needed, using biopsy material in the 
metastatic  setting,  to  study  the  effect  in  RET  mutation-negative  tumours  and  to  clarify  the  exact 
mechanism of action of the drug.  
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
Current  evidence  supports  the  use  of  vandetanib  in  patients  with  unresectable  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. However, from a quantitative point of view, the specific benefit in 
RET  –  MTC  patients  might  be  less  as  compared  with  what  was  observed  in  RET+  MTC  tumours. 
Therefore,  based  on  the  available  evidence,  there  is  a  need  to  further  investigate  any  quantitative 
differences in terms of efficacy in RET negative patients with vandetanib that are not known at present. 
As a result, the CHMP considered the following measure necessary to address the missing clinical data 
in the context of a conditional MA: 
A non-randomised study of vandetanib in patients with sporadic medullary thyroid cancer with known 
RET  mutation  status  to  include  60%  of  patients  who  receive  vandetanib  in  the  CHMP  approved 
indication within the EU. Patients will be followed for 2 years and an interim analysis will be presented 
12 months after first inclusion. Data will be collected and analyzed at pre-specified times.  
The  inclusion  criteria  will  be  based  on  the  SmPC  indication,  sporadic  medullary  thyroid  cancer  and 
known RET mutation status. RET mutation negative patients who do not receive vandetanib due to RET 
status or contraindication should also be to enrolled and followed in order to have a control group for 
patients with RET negative status. Exclusion criteria should be limited as much as possible to contra-
indications outlined in section 4.3 of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
Page 51/88
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
Patients will not be required to have a fresh tissue biopsy to determine RET status before enrolment. 
However RET status must be determined and a recent determination of such status should be obtained 
as  often  as  possible  even  in  patients  previously  tested  at  an  earlier  stage  of  their  disease. 
Determination of RET status should be made preferably just prior to the initiation of treatment. Tissue 
type  used  for  assay,  date  of  tissue  biopsy,  assay  type  and  definition  used  for  RET  mutation  positive 
and negative will be collected.  
Efficacy endpoints will include ORR, DCR and PFS. The main analysis will compare efficacy parameters 
of  vandetanib  in  RET  mutation  positive  and  RET  mutation  negative  patients,  with  reference  to  the 
respective  outcomes  observed  in  RET  mutation  positive    and  RET  mutation  negative  patients  who  do 
not  receive  treatment.  Safety  analyses  will  be  determined  for  the  overall  population,  RET  mutation 
negative  and  RET  mutation  positive  patients.  At  each  visit,  a  safety  assessment  will  be  conducted 
including QT prolongation information. 
Efficacy assessments will be performed at 3 month intervals. PFS hazard ratio will be calculated for RET 
mutation positive versus RET mutation negative patients.  The magnitude of the hazard ratio should be 
interpreted in the context of the non-randomized grouping of patients by RET mutation status.   
The  final  analysis  will  be  performed  when  at  least  40  patients  identified  with  RET  mutation  and  40 
patients  identified  without  evidence  of  RET  mutation  have  been  enrolled  into  the  study  and  received 
vandetanib for 14 months.  The total duration of the study is expected to be 38 months. 
The  applicant  confirmed  that  it  would  be  able  to  provide  the  clinical  data  requested  as  part  of  the 
specific obligation, set out in section 4 Recommendations. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 58) was conducted to demonstrate safety 
and efficacy of vandetanib 300 mg versus placebo. The result of the primary analysis of PFS showed a 
statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomized to vandetanib compared to placebo 
(Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.46; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.31-0.69; p=0.0001). 
The  CHMP  considers  that  an  open  label  trial  comparing  RET  negative  and  RET  positive  patients  with 
sporadic  medullary  thyroid  cancer  treated  with  vandetanib,  based  on  a  CHMP  approved  protocol  is 
necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context of a conditional MA: 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety data submitted corresponds primarily to the safety analysis set in Study 58.  
Patient exposure 
The total estimated exposure to vandetanib (at all doses, and with concomitant chemotherapy as well 
as  monotherapy)  from  clinical  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  and  patients  is  approximately  4000 
patients.    As  of  the  data  cut-off  date  of  19  October  2009,  1839  patients  had  received  300  mg 
Assessment report

vandetanib in the pooled monotherapy clinical studies:  274 patients for at least 1 year and 84 patients 
for at least 2 years.   
In pivotal study 58, patients were randomised to receive vandetanib 300 mg or placebo, continuing on 
blinded  treatment  until  objective  disease  progression.  A  total  of  231  patients  were  treated  with 
vandetanib 300 mg monotherapy and 99 patients received placebo in the randomised phase.  
Upon  disease  progression,  patients  were  discontinued  from  blinded  study  treatment  and  then 
unblinded and given the option to receive post-progression open label treatment with vandetanib 300 
mg  (or  receive  a  permanently  reduced  dose,  if  applicable),  or  enter  follow-up  for  survival  status.  A 
total  of  58  (58%)  of  randomised  placebo  patients  and  44  (19%)  randomised  vandetanib  patients 
received  vandetanib  during  the  open  label  treatment.  Overall,  there  were  no  substantial  imbalance 
regarding  patients  characteristics,  except  in  the  percentage  of  patients  ≤  40  y  at  baseline  in  the 
vandetanib arm.  
The mean duration of exposure was longer for vandetanib 300 mg (75.0 weeks for total exposure and 
73.6 weeks for actual exposure) than for placebo (53.9 weeks for total exposure and 53.7 weeks for 
actual exposure) (See Figure X below). 
Figure 6. 
Percentage of patients by exposure on randomised treatment in Study 58 
(safety analysis set) 
At  the  date  of  data  cut-off,  of  the  231  patients  randomised  in  vandetanib  300  mg  arm,  162  patients 
had been treated with vandetanib for at least 12 months, and 51 patients had been treated for at least 
24 months. A total of 49.4% had a dose reduction or interruption: while 30.3% remained on 300 mg, 
35.1%  were  reduced  to  200  mg,  0.9%  reduced  directly  to  100 mg  and  33.7%  discontinued  (22.0  % 
due  to  disease  progression;  6.1%  due  to  AE,  without  having  a  dose  reduction;  5.6%  for  other 
reasons).   
Assessment report  
Page 53/88
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
The reasons for discontinuation of randomised treatment were: 
- AEs in 12.1% of vandetanib patients and 3.0% of placebo patients.  
- Disease progression in 30.7% vandetanib patients versus 55.0% placebo patients.   
While randomized placebo patients remained on placebo therapy for a median of 265 days: 
- Patients who remained on initial 300 mg dose remained on therapy for a median of 339 days 
- Patients who had their dose reduced to 200 mg remained on therapy for a median of 502 days 
- Patients who had their dose reduced to 100 mg remained on therapy for a median of 545.5 days

Adverse events  
During the randomized treatment phase (study 58), a total of 3149 AEs including 289 grade 3-4 AEs, 
141 SAEs and 6 fatal SAEs have been reported in 99.6% vandetanib patients. In placebo arm: 666 AEs 
including 46 grade 3-4 AEs, 19 SAEs and 2 fatal SAEs have been reported in 90.9% patients. The same 
pattern of AEs events identified during the clinical development of vandetanib is retrieved in study 58. 
The  5  most  frequently  reported  AEs  were  diarrhoea,  rash,  nausea,  hypertension,  and  headache.  The 
percentage  of  patients  with  grade  ≥  3  AEs  was  2.3  fold  higher  in  vandetanib  than  in  placebo  arms: 
55.4% vs 24.2%. (See table below).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events 
The  percentage  of  patients  who  had  at  least  1  SAE  was  higher  in  the  vandetanib  arm  than  in  the 
placebo arm (30.7% vs 13.1%). There were 141 SAEs in vandetanib arm versus 19 in placebo arm. As 
displayed in the table below, the most commonly reported SAEs in the vandetanib arm pertained to the 
following SOCs: 
  SOC  infections:  32  SAEs  (7  pneumonia,  5  Urinary  tract  infection,  4  pyelonephritis,  2 
staphylococcal infections…) 
  SOC GI disorders: 20 SAEs (5 diarrhoea, 1 pancreatitis, 1 colitis, 1 ileus…) 
  Metabolism  and  nutrition  disorder  16  SAEs 
(hypercalcaemia,  decreased  appetite, 
dehydration...) 
  SOC vascular disorders: 11 SAEs (4 HTA, 4 hypertensive crisis, 1 accelerated HTA)  
  Respiratory disorders 11 SAEs (3 pneumonitis, 2 fatal cases respiratory arrest/failure...) 
Deaths 
In the Safety Analysis Set, a total of 14.2% (47) patients had died at the time of data cut-off (31 July 
2009): 13.9% of patients in the vandetanib arm and 15.2% of patients in the placebo arm. 
Within 60 day safety follow-up 
A total of 17 vandetanib patients and 11 placebo patients died within the 60-day safety follow up after 
vandetanib discontinuation. Out of these cases, there were 6 sudden deaths in the vandetanib arm:  2 
related to prolonged QTc, and 4 additional suspected sudden deaths in patients still on treatment or <4 
days  after  discontinuation  There  was  1  death  related  to  pneumonia,  2  deaths  related  to  nutrition 
disorders (malnutrition, dysphagia and anorexia leading to aspiration pneumonia), and 1 death related 
to cardiopulmonary insufficiency. There was a fatal case with ongoing suspected RPLS, and 3 additional 
deaths  while  ongoing  SAE  (staphylococcal  infection,  gastritis,  pancreatitis).  The  fatal  cause  was 
assessed  as  unknown  or  due  to  MTC  according  to  investigator.  In  the  end,  there  were  3  deaths  with 
objective progressive disease. 
Assessment report  
Page 58/88
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
In  contrast,  in  Placebo  arm,  there  were  2  deaths  related  to  gastrointestinal  SAE,  5  deaths  with 
objective progression, and 4 deaths that would be due to MTC (no objective progression). 
After the 60-day safety follow-up,  
A  total  of  15  vandetanib  patients  and  4  placebo  patients  died.  Although  most  deaths  (10/15)  were 
assessed as related to MTC/disease progression by the investigator, there was an additional fatal case 
with  ongoing  suspected  RPLS  (no  MRI  performed).  In  contrast,  in  placebo  arm,  there  were  3  deaths 
related to MTC or disease progression and one death due to suicide. 
MTC  was  documented  as  the  cause  of  death  of  10.4%  vandetanib  patients  and  14.1%  placebo 
patients.  
Furthermore,  during  the  open  label  phase,  there  were  no  fatal  cases  among  the  first  58  randomized 
placebo  patients  while  2  occurred  in  the  first  vandetanib  randomized  patient  group  (pneumonia 
aspiration, suicide). 
Other Significant Events 
Skin and subcutaneous disorders 
Almost 90% of patients developed a skin reaction whilst on vandetanib compared with 23% in placebo 
patients.  Overall,  rash  (including  acne,  dermatitis  acneiform)  was  reported  in  80%  vandetanib 
patients. In addition, photosensitivity reactions occurred in 13% patients who developed a rash only in 
sun-exposed areas. Patients were recommended to follow a program of skin protective measures. Two 
AEs of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia were reported. 
Two cases of bullous dermatitis were reported, including 1 grade 3-4 AE.  Steven Johnson syndromes 
and TEN have been previously reported in other vandetanib clinical trials (0.7%), some were fatal and 
represent an identified risk.  
Gastrointestinal disorders 
During  the  randomized  phase,  80.5%  vandetanib  patients  experienced  a  total  of  595  gastrointestinal 
AES including 51 AEs grade ≥3 and 20 SAEs, compared with 56.6% placebo patients (108 AEs, 1 SAE 
gastrointestinal  haemorrhage).  Among  the  SAEs  reported  in  vandetanib  arm,  there  were:  1 
pancreatitis, 1 ileus, 1 pneumatosis intestinalis, 1 small intestinal perforation, 1 colitis, 1 peritonitis, 2 
dysphagia, 1 gastritis, 5 diarrhoea: 
  Diarrhoea, which is one of the frequent symptoms of MTC, especially in patients with high CTN 
levels,  was  reported  in  56%  of  vandetanib  patients  at  all  grades  in  study  58,  i.e.  a  2-fold 
increased percentage compared with placebo. It was the most common grade ≥3 AE reported 
in vandetanib patients (# 11%), with a time to onset of 151 days (range 9 to 415). At least, 
two  patients  experienced  a  SAE.  Overall,  the  prevalence  of  diarrhea  reaches  approximately 
40%  at  3  months  for  all  grades  and  does  not  increase  after  the  first  3  months.  The  median 
duration  was  267.5  days  for  the  vandetanib  arm  and  49.5  days  for  the  placebo  arm.  The 
management of diarrhea and vomiting which should include the monitoring of electrolytes is a 
major concern because of the increased risk of QTc prolongation.  
Assessment report  
Page 59/88
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  A  bowel  perforation  occurred  in  a  patient  with  a  history  of  diverticulosis,  16  months  after  the 
start  of  vandetanib.  Intestinal  perforation  is  a  identified  risk  in  MTC  patients  receiving 
vandetanib. 
  3  cases  of  pancreatitis  have  been  reported  with  vandetanib  during  the  study:  one  in  the 
randomised phase and 2 during the open label phase. 
Cardiac disorders 
A total of 35 cardiac AEs including 5 SAEs (4 deaths) have been reported in 30 vandetanib patients. In 
placebo  arm,  16  AEs  have  been  reported  in  13  placebo  patients  including  2  SAEs  (1  pericardial 
effusion, 1 pericardial haemorrhage), none were fatal.  
Among  the  35  AEs  reported  in  vandetanib  arm,  there  were:  2  cardiac  failures  (1  fatal),  2  Atrial 
Fibrillation (1 fatal), 1 Supraventricular Extrasystoles, 7 supraventricular arrhythmias (1 fatal), 4 Sinus 
Bradycardia, 3 Bundle Branch Block Left, 1 arrhythmia (1 fatal), 4 Bradycardia (1 fatal), 2 Tachycardia 
(1 SAE), 1 Nodal Arrhythmia, 1 Ventricular Tachycardia.  
QTc prolongation 
Overall,  31  (13.4%)  vandetanib  patients  had  QTc  (Bazett’s)  ≥500  ms  compared  with  1.0%  placebo 
patients,  and  8  (3.47%)  vandetanib  patients  had  QTc  ≥550  ms  or  increase  from  baseline  ≥100  ms, 
based on a single value during randomised treatment.  
Over 91% of patients experienced QTcF prolongation >20ms: 
 
 
 
 
In 45.5%:  QTcF prolongation [20ms to 49ms]  
In 44.2%: QTcF prolongation [50ms to 99ms] 
In 35%:  QTcF prolongation > 60ms 
In 1.7%:  QTcF prolongation >100ms  
In patients with QTc≥500msec: 
 
There was one fatal case  
  Sex ratio:  8 male versus 23 female patients 
  Age range: 23-83 years 
  mean age: 50 years 
  Baseline QTc: 408 – 476 msec 
 
Time to prolonged QTc: 1 week to 633 days. 
Vandetanib  at  a  dose  of  300  mg  is  associated  with  a  substantial  and  concentration  dependent 
prolongation  in  QTc  (mean  28msec,  median  35  msec).  First  QT  prolongations  occurred  most  often  in 
the first 3 months of treatment, but continued to first occur after this time. The effect does not lessen 
over time. Prolonged QTc≥500msec was more frequent in female patients (75% versus 25% in male), 
Assessment report  
Page 60/88
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
and the frequency of QTc≥500msec was increased in subgroups of patients with hypertension (20%), 
diarrhoea (>20%), serum Mg<LLN (31.3%) and with baseline cardiac impairment (32.1%). 
Arrhythmia and QT prolonged AEs 
There were 2 sudden deaths (in patients with QTc >550 ms), and 4 suspected sudden deaths.  
Cardiac failure 
One vandetanib patient had a Grade 1 AE of cardiac failure (following a grade 3 event of abnormal left 
ventricular function) and 1 patient  had a Grade 5 SAE of cardiac failure acute during the randomised 
treatment period; no patients in the placebo arm reported these events.   
Ischaemic heart disease 
Ischaemic  heart  disease  grouped  events  were  reported  in  2.2%  vandetanib  patients  versus  2.0%  in 
the placebo arm. In the vandetanib arm, 4 patients had events of grade 1 and 1 patient had an event 
of grade 3. Both patients in the placebo arm had grade 1 events. 
Vascular disorders 
A  total  of  39.0%  vandetanib  patients  experienced  an  AE  from  the  SOC  Vascular  disorders  (vs  11.1% 
placebo patients).   
  Hypertension  which  is  a  common  side  effect  was  reported  in  31.6%  vandetanib  patients 
(versus  5.1%  placebo),  including  8.7%  patients  with  Grade  ≥3  events  of  hypertension, 
hypertensive crisis (1.7%), or accelerated hypertension. Two patients (0.9%) discontinued due 
to  AEs  of  hypertension  (1  patient  with  Grade  4  and  1  with  Grade  2  hypertension).  The 
prevalence of hypertension, hypertensive crisis, or accelerated hypertension was approximately 
20%  for  the  vandetanib  arm  within  3  months  of  treatment  and  this  appeared  to  increase 
slightly  over  time  throughout  Study  58.  The  median  duration  of  hypertension,  hypertensive 
crisis,  or  accelerated  hypertension  was  261.5  days  for  the  vandetanib  arm  and  188  days  for 
placebo. The upper quartile durations were 609.5 and 259 days, respectively.   
 
Three  (1.3%)  patients,  all  in  the  vandetanib  arm,  had  AEs  of  ischaemic  cerebrovascular 
conditions, all of which were grade 3, while no patient in the placebo arm had these events.  
 
Thromboembolic  events  were  reported  less  frequently  in  the  vandetanib  arm  than  in  the 
placebo arm (0.9% vs 4.0%). Both events in the vandetanib arm were grade 3. 
Nervous system disorders 
A  total  of  256  AEs  have  been  reported  in  112  (48.5%)  vandetanib  patients.  There  were  16  reported 
AEs grade≥3 (2 headaches, 1 dizziness, 1 tremor, 1 disturbance in attention, 1 hyperesthesia, 1 motor 
dysfunction) and 9 SAEs: 1 brain edema, 1 cerebral ischemia, 1 peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, 1 
depressed level of consciousness, 2 loss of consciousness, 3 transient ischemic attacks). 
In  contrast,  40  AES  have  been  reported  in  32  placebo  patients  (32%):  4  AEs  grade  3-4:  2  syncopes 
and  2  SAEs:  1  neuralgia,  1  hemiparesis.    A  total  of  5  ischemic  cerebrovascular  events  have  been

reported in vandetanib arm versus none in placebo. Cerebrovascular event is an identified risk in the 
safety database of vandetanib.  
Peripheral neurotoxicity 
A  total  of  49  AEs  related  to  paraesthesia,  peripheral  hypoesthesia,  sensory  neuropathy,  neuropathy 
peripheral or tremor have been reported in vandetanib arm versus 9 AEs in placebo arm.   
Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy  
Headache  was  reported  more  frequently  in  25.5%  vandetanib  patients  compared  with  9.1%  placebo 
patients  and  was  subsequent  to  elevated  blood  pressure.  There  were  no  reported  cases  of  RPLS  in 
patients  receiving  300  mg  monotherapy.  However,  a  total  of  4  cases  of  RPLS  have  occurred  in  the 
vandetanib programme. One case occurred in Study 32 in a patient who received vandetanib 100 mg 
daily  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  for  NSCLC.  Two  cases  occurred  in  paediatric  patients  with 
primary  brain  tumours  receiving  vandetanib  with  concomitant  radiotherapy  in  investigator-sponsored 
(Study IRUSZACT0051). One case occurred in Study IRUSZACT0070 in a patient receiving vandetanib 
in combination with gemcitabine + oxaliplatin for transitional cell cancer.  
Infections disorders 
In  115  (49.8%)  vandetanib  patients  (23  grade  3-4  AEs  and  32  SAEs)  versus  54  AEs  in  36  (36.4%) 
placebo patients (5 AEs grade 3-4 and 2 SAEs including one fatal). Among the 32 SAEs reported under 
the  SOC  infection  in  vandetanib  patients,  there  were  3  pneumonitis,  1  chylothorax,  1  pneumo-
mediastinum, 1 pulmonary edema and 11 pneumonia (7 SAEs, one was fatal).  
ILD  and  Pneumonia  are  an  identified  risk  in  the  3,000-patient  vandetanib  safety  data  base.  In  the 
monotherapy  pool  of  1839  patients,  the  majority  of  whom  have  lung  cancer,  the  most  common  fatal 
event  was  pneumonia  with  14  deaths.  In  all  there  were  110  events  of  pneumonia  with  58  ≥Grade  3 
and  73  serious.  There  were  15  cases  of  pneumonitis  (6  ≥Grade  3,  8  serious,  2  fatal)  and  7  cases  of 
interstitial lung disease (1 ≥Grade 3, 6 serious, 2 fatal).   
Respiratory disorders 
During the randomized phase study, there were 165 AEs reported in 89 (38.5%) vandetanib patients 
(including 11 SAEs: 2 dyspnea, 1 hemoptysis, 3 pneumonitis, 1 bronchospasm, 1 respiratory failure, 1 
pneumonia  aspiration,  1  chylothorax,  1  respiratory  arrest,)  versus  75  AEs  in  33  (33.3%)  placebo 
patients  (including 3 SAEs: 1 hemoptysis, 1 pleural effusion, 1 pulmonary thrombosis).  
Globally,  the  number  of  AEs  and  the  nature  of  the  most  frequent  AEs  reported  in  vandetanib  arm 
compare well with those reported in placebo arm. Aspiration pneumonia, hemoptysis were reported by 
1  patient  in  each  treatment  arm.  However,  there  were  3  pneumonitis,  1  chylothorax,  1  pneumo-
mediastinum,  1  pulmonary  edema  in  vandetanib.  Of  note,  there  were  only  2  pneumonitis  grade  ≥3 
reported in the initial submission, while no SAE was mentioned.  
No event of ILD occurred during randomised treatment. However, there was 1 cases of ILD reported in 
patients taking vandetanib in the open-label phase. No cases have been reported in the placebo arm. 
Although none of these reported cases were considered by the investigator to be related to vandetanib, 
ILD remains an identified risk in MTC patients.

Renal disorders 
Overall, 24.7% of patients in the vandetanib arm compared with 10.1% of patients in the placebo arm 
experienced an AE in the SOC renal disorders.   
  AEs  of  renal  failure  or  renal  insufficiency  were  reported  in  5  vandetanib  patients  versus  1 
placebo patient. In all cases an aggravating condition was present: vomiting in the case of the 
placebo  patient;  hypercalcaemia,  dehydration,  diarrhoea  or  pre-existing  moderate  renal 
insufficiency with diabetes in the patients receiving vandetanib.   
  Nephrolithiasis was reported in 9 vandetanib patients and 1 placebo patient 
  One related acute case of interstitial nephritis led to temporary withdrawal and a reduced 200 
mg dose after resolving. 
 
Proteinuria was reported in 10% of vandetanib patients (26 AEs versus 3 in placebo arm).  
  During  randomised  treatment,  mean  creatinine  was  consistently  higher  over  time  in  the 
vandetanib  arm  than  in  the  placebo  arm.  Furthermore,  90.9%  vandetanib  patients  had  a 
proteinuria on dipstick versus 28.3% placebo patients.  
The  number  of  patients  who  experienced  an  AE  in  the  renal  SOC  was  significantly  higher  in  the 
vandetanib arm. Furthermore, during randomised treatment, mean creatinine was consistently higher 
over time in the vandetanib arm than in the placebo arm, 90.9% vandetanib patients had a proteinuria 
on dipstick versus 28.3% placebo patients.  
Table  18.  Shift  table  of  creatinine  clearance  at  baseline  against  maximum  percentage 
decrease in creatinine clearance whilst on randomised treatment (Study 48) 
Based  on  the  table  above,  21%  patients  with  a  normal  renal  function  had  a  decreased  creatinine 
clearance  >  20%  (decrease>30%  in  9%  patients).  Furthermore,  51.5%  mild  renal  impaired  patients 
had a decreased creatinine clearance > 20% (decrease> 30% in 28.6% patients). These figures show 
evidence of the vandetanib nephrotoxicity.

Psychiatric disorders 
Reported incidences of insomnia and depression were more frequently reported in vandetanib patients 
than in placebo arm. Importantly, one patient died of a suicide 103 days after receiving his last dose of 
vandetanib during open-label treatment.  
Hepatobiliary disorders 
Overall  3.9%  vandetanib  patients  compared  with  1.0%  placebo  patients  experienced  a  hepatobiliary 
disorders  AE.  Eventually,  3  patients  who  had  a  history  of  metastatic  hepatic  disease  including  gall 
bladder  experienced  bile  duct  stone,  cholelithiasis  and  cholecystitis.  None  of  the  events  were 
considered related to therapy with vandetanib.  
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
A total of 35.1% vandetanib patients experienced 131 AEs (24 AEs grade 3-4 and 16 SAEs) versus 24 
AEs  (1  SAE)  in  20.2%  placebo  patients.  The  sole  serious  AE  grade  3-4  reported  in  placebo  arm  was 
diabetes mellitus. In contrast, 5 SAEs decreased appetite or malnutrition, 2 SAEs hypokaliema, 1 SAE 
hyperkaliemia,  2  SAEs  hypocalcaemia,  3  SAEs  hypercalcaemia,  2  SAEs  dehydration,  and  1  SAE 
hyponatremia were reported in vandetanib patients.  
Based  on  the  5  narratives  of  fatal  cases  provided  by  the  applicant,  at  least  two  patients  died  after  a 
Grade 4 anorexia, one of malnutrition and respiratory failure (not documented), and one of pneumonia 
aspiration (not documented).  
Patients with advanced MTC often have airway and esophageal compromise as a result of bulky disease 
around the neck—deaths from respiratory arrest and aspiration are not unexpected. However, a causal 
relationship between treatment with vandetanib and Patients 0009003 and 2801012 deaths cannot be 
ruled out.  
Eye disorders 
Abnormalities  from  visual  assessment  were  more  common  in  the  vandetanib  arm  than  the  placebo 
arm,  (83.6%  versus  61.5%).  The  most  notable  difference  between  treatment  arms  was  in 
abnormalities  of  the  epithelium,  which  were  observed  in  49.7%  vandetanib  patients  compared  with 
3.8%  placebo  patients.  Vandetanib  patients  also  had  a  higher  frequency  of  stroma  abnormalities 
(17.6%  vs  3.8%)  and  abnormalities  of  the  conjunctiva  (7.5%  vs  3.8%).  Vandetanib  patients  had  a 
lower frequency of abnormalities of blood vessels (6.9% vs 11.5%) and colour vision (7.5% vs 17.3%) 
relative to patients in the placebo arm. Six (5.9%) patients had AEs leading to discontinuation of open-
label  treatment,  including  1  patient  with  blurred  vision.  30.8%  vandetanib  patients  who  underwent 
ophthalmologic examinations had vortex keratopathy, compared with no patients in the placebo arm.   
Drug Interactions 
In  Study  58,  co-administration  of  drugs  known  to  prolong  ECG  QT  interval,  whether  or  not  clearly 
associated with Torsades de Pointes, was associated with a higher incidence of prolongation of the ECG 
QTc interval than when vandetanib was given without such drugs. 
The  potential  for  a  PD  interaction  with  respect  to  QTc  between  vandetanib  and  ondansetron  was 
assessed in Study 21, a four-way cross-over study. Ondansetron 32 mg iv was administered alone or 6

hours  after  vandetanib  700  mg  was  administered.    The  mean  effect  of  32  mg  ondansetron  on  QTc 
interval  when  given  alone  was  12.45  ms.    The  mean  effect  of  700  mg  vandetanib  6  hours  after 
administration  was  17.29  ms.  The  combined  effect  of  ondansetron,  infusion  6  hours  after  700  mg 
vandetanib,  was  22.3  ms.  These  results  point  to  an  additive  or  slightly  less  than  additive  effect  on 
mean QTc when ondansetron (32 mg) was administered as a 15-minute infusion to healthy volunteers 
who had received a single oral dose of 700 mg vandetanib. 
Safety during open-label treatment in Study 58 
A total of 102 patients had received open-label treatment with vandetanib by the data cut-off date of 
19  October  2009.    A  total  of  58  placebo  patients  received  vandetanib  during  the  open  label  study 
phase, and 42 of them were continuing at the time of the cut-off data. The reported incidence of AEs in 
the  open  label  phase  is  similar  in  number  and  type  to  that  seen  in  patients  who  initially  received 
vandetanib in the randomised phase.  
There  were  no  fatal  cases  among  the  58  placebo  patients  while  2  occurred  in  the  vandetanib 
randomized patients. One patient died of an SAE of pneumonia aspiration during the open-label phase.  
One  additional  patient  died  of  a  suicide  103  days  after  receiving  his  last  dose  of  vandetanib  during 
open-label treatment. The event was not considered related to treatment by the investigator.

2        The  increases  in  serum  creatinine  were  CTCAE  grade  1-2,  and  may  be  related  to  inhibition  of  the  human 
transport protein OCT2. 
Haemoglobin 
Mean values for haemoglobin were consistently higher with vandetanib compared with placebo in both 
males and females. The differences between treatment arms in mean haemoglobin values were more 
pronounced in females than males. In males these mean levels were higher by approximately 5 to 10 
g/L in the vandetanib arm up to Week 72, when the differences between treatment arms diminished. 
In  females  the  mean  levels  of  haemoglobin  were  higher  in  the  vandetanib  arm  by  ≥10  g/L  at  the 
majority of time points. 
Assessment report

One (0.4%) patient in the vandetanib arm and 2 (2.0%) patients in the placebo arm had CTCAE Grade 
3  reductions  in  haemoglobin.  There  were  no  important  differences  with  respect  to  mean  values  over 
time for haematology parameters other than haemoglobin. 
ALT 
Mean ALT values increased from baseline to Week 12 during randomised treatment before decreasing 
to  the  baseline  level  by  Week  120.  Mean  ALT  values  during  randomised  treatment  were  consistently 
higher  over  time  through  Week  108  in  the  vandetanib  arm  compared  with  the  placebo  arm.  Similar 
results were observed for median values. A higher percentage of patients in the vandetanib arm than 
the placebo arm shifted from baseline to a higher CTCAE grade for ALT during randomised treatment. 
Liver function test (LFT) elevations were reported as an AE more frequently in the vandetanib arm than 
the  placebo  arm.  These  included  alanine  aminotransferase  increased  (9  [3.9%]  vs  1  [1.0%]  in  the 
vandetanib  and  placebo  arms,  aspartate  aminotransferase  increased  (10  [4.3%]  vs  1  [1.0%]), 
transaminases increased (4 [1.7%] vs 0), and liver function test abnormal (1[0.4%] vs 0 patients). No 
patient had a concomitant bilirubin elevation. 
Four  (1.7%)  patients  in  the  vandetanib  arm  had  laboratory  findings  for  ALT  of  CTCAE  grade  3  or  4 
whilst on randomised treatment, compared with no patients in the placebo arm. Of 28 patients in the 
vandetanib arm who had an ALT elevation of grade 2 or higher, 21 patients returned to normal value 
(18  patients)  or  grade  1  ALT  elevation  (3  patients)  without  any  change  in  vandetanib  dose.  In  3 
patients  ALT  normalised  (2  patients)  or  improved  to  grade  1  (1  patient)  after  dose  reduction  or 
interruption.  Four  patients  still  had  an  ALT  of  grade  2  at  data  cut-off.  No  patient  had  both  an  ALT 
elevation  of  3  x  ULN  and  a  bilirubin  elevation  of  2  x  ULN.  No  patient  in  the  vandetanib  arm 
discontinued due to AEs related to LFT elevations. 
Creatinine 
The  mean  creatinine  level  increased  from  73.6  μmol/L  at  baseline  to  91.6  μmol/L  at  Week  1  and 
remained  relatively  stable  through  Week  108  before  decreasing  slightly.  Mean  creatinine  was 
consistently higher over time in the vandetanib arm than in the placebo arm. A higher percentage of 
patients in the vandetanib arm than the placebo arm shifted from baseline to a higher CTCAE grade for 
creatinine during randomised treatment. 
No patient in either treatment arm had laboratory findings for creatinine of CTCAE grade 3 or 4 whilst 
on  randomised  treatment.  There  were  6  CTCAE  grade  2  elevations  in  serum  creatinine  in  the 
vandetanib  arm  versus  none  in  the  placebo  arm.  Of  these  6  patients,  4  normalised  or  improved  with 
dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation, 1 patient had recurrent episodes of nephrolithiasis and 
pyelonephritis, and 1 patient continued to have elevated creatinine at the date of data cut-off. 
A total of 9 (3.9%) patients in the vandetanib arm had an AE of blood creatinine increased, while no 
patient  in  the  placebo  arm  had  this  AE.  Two  (0.9%)  of  these  patients  discontinued  vandetanib 
treatment due to AEs of blood creatinine increased.

Calcium 
The percentage of patients with laboratory variables for low calcium of CTCAE grade 3 or 4 whilst on 
randomised treatment was higher for the vandetanib arm than for the placebo arm (5.6% vs 3.0%). 
Sodium 
The percentage of patients with laboratory variables of high sodium for CTCAE grade 3 or 4 whilst on 
randomised treatment was higher for the vandetanib arm than for the placebo arm (1.7% vs 0%). 
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) 
Median  values  of  TSH  during  the  randomised  treatment  phase  of  Study  58  were  higher  in  the 
vandetanib  arm  than  those  in  the  placebo  arm  at  virtually  all  time  points,  with  the  highest  median 
value  for  vandetanib  occurring  at  Week  12,  after  which  the  median  values  declined  in  this  treatment 
arm at all time points except one. 
For  patients  with  normal  TSH  at  baseline,  elevated  TSH  was  defined  as  a  TSH  value  above  3x  upper 
limit of normal (ULN) on at least 2 separate follow-up assessments. For patients with an abnormal TSH 
value at baseline, elevated TSH was defined as a TSH value above 3x the baseline value on at least 2 
separate follow-up assessments. The definition was based on the findings of a study by deGroot et al 
2005.  By  this  definition,  43  (18.6%)  patients  in  the  vandetanib  arm  had  elevated  TSH  values  during 
treatment, compared with 1 (1.0%) patient in the placebo group. The median time to TSH elevation in 
the vandetanib arm was 57 days (range, 14 to 502). 
Hypothyroidism was reported as an AE in 15 (6.5%) patients in the vandetanib arm and no patients in 
the placebo  arm. All of the AEs of hypothyroidism were grade  1 or 2. A total of 114 (49.3%) and 17 
(17.2%) of patients on the vandetanib and placebo arms respectively, required an increase in thyroid 
hormone replacement therapy while on randomised treatment. 
Urinalysis 
The  percentage  of  patients  with  newly  developed  proteinuria  or  deterioration  of  existing  proteinuria 
during randomised treatment was higher in the vandetanib arm (210 [90.9%] patients) compared with 
the  placebo  arm  (28  [28.3%]  patients),  as  was  the  percentage  of  patients  with  newly  developed 
haematuria or deterioration of existing haematuria (79 [34.2%] vs (22 [22.2%] patients). 
Among  the  210  patients  in  the  vandetanib  treatment  arm  who  developed  proteinuria  or  had 
deterioration  of  existing  proteinuria  during  randomised  treatment,  54  (23.4%)  patients  had  a 
concurrent  or  subsequent  AE  of  hypertension,  compared  with  1  (1%)  of  28  patients  in  the  placebo

arm.  None  of  these  same  patients  in  the  2  treatment  arms  had  a  concurrent  or  subsequent  elevated 
blood pressure. 
Among the 79 patients who developed haematuria or had deterioration of existing haematuria during 
treatment  with  vandetanib,  16  (6.9%)  patients  had  a  concurrent  or  subsequent  AE  of  hypertension, 
compared with compared with 1 (1%) of 22 patients in the placebo arm. None of these same patients 
in the 2 treatment arm had a concurrent or subsequent elevated blood pressure. 
Safety in special populations 
Effect of gender 
99.3%  of  males  and  100%  of  females  in  the  vandetanib  arm,  and  92.7%  of  males  and  88.6%  of 
females  in  the  placebo  arm,  had  an  AE.  The  reported  incidences  of  rash  (40.3%  versus  51.5%), 
diarrhoea  (53.0%  versus  60.8%),  hypertension  (27.6%  versus  37.1%),  and  fatigue  (19.4%  versus 
29.9%) were higher in females than in males in the vandetanib arm; the incidence of asthenia (17.2% 
versus  11.3%)  was  lower.  Incidences  in  the  placebo  arm  were  similar  between  genders.    These 
differences do not significantly change the safety profile. 
Effect of age 
The safety profile of vandetanib was examined across the following age ranges:  <40 years of age, 40 
to <65 years of age; 65 to <75 years of age; and 75 years of age. Elderly patients were defined as 
those  patients  65  years  of  age.  For  the  first  3  groups,  the  safety  profile  was  similar  except  that 
among skin reactions, acne was reported more frequently in patients <40 years of age. There were too 
few patients 75 years of age to define a safety profile in that group.   
Renal impairment 
Patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  (creatinine  clearance  <30  ml/min)  were  excluded  from  all 
vandetanib  Phase  III  studies.  Mild  renal  impairment  was  defined  as  baseline  creatinine  clearance 
values of 50 to 80 ml/min, and moderate impairment was 30 to 50 ml/min. In Study 58, 1 patient had 
mild renal impairment at baseline and had an event of interstitial nephritis.  
The safety profile of vandetanib in patients with both mild and moderate renal impairment was similar 
to that of the overall study population. The incidences of the events of rash, diarrhoea, hypertension, 
fatigue, and asthenia were 45.9%, 58.1%, 34.5%, 23%, and 14.2%, respectively, in patients with mild 
renal failure, and 46.7%, 40%, 26.7%, 20%, and 13.3%, respectively, in patients with moderate renal 
failure. These data indicate no adjustment in starting dose is needed in patients with mild-to-moderate 
renal impairment. 
Clinical  data  and  PK  data  in  healthy  subjects  suggest  that  no  change  in  starting  dose  is  required  in 
volunteers with mild or moderate renal impairment; in healthy subjects with severe renal impairment, 
exposure to vandetanib may be increased up to 2-fold.

Hepatic impairment 
There is limited clinical data in patients with hepatic impairment treated with vandetanib for MTC; only 
5 such patients were enrolled in Study 58.  Clinical data and PK data in healthy subjects suggests that 
no change in starting dose is required for mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. 
Cardiac impairment 
Thirty-eight  (11.5%)  patients  with  cardiac  impairment  were  recruited  into  Study  58.  Patients  with 
previous  cardiovascular  abnormalities  recorded  on  their  medical  history  CRF  were  defined  as  having 
cardiac  impairment.  A  total  of  21.4%  of  patients  in  the  vandetanib  arm  with  cardiac  impairment  at 
baseline  had  protocol-defined  QT  prolongation,  compared  with  14.3%  of  all patients  treated  with 
vandetanib. 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnant or lactating women have been excluded from participation in vandetanib studies. Therefore, 
there is no adequate clinical information in pregnant women using vandetanib.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
A total of 3 (9.7%) of 31 patients in the vandetanib arm who were treated with a Group 1 concomitant 
medication  had  protocol-defined  QTc  prolongation  during  randomised  treatment  and  1  (3.2%)  of  4 
patients had this event after randomised treatment. Of those taking Group 2 concomitant medications, 
5  (8.8%)  patients  in  the  vandetanib  arm  had  QTc  prolongation  during  randomised  treatment  and  2 
(3.5%) patients had QTc prolongation after randomised treatment.     
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One  case  of  discontinuation  was  reported  in  blinded  phase  of  Study  58  for  safety  reasons,  in  the

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Regarding the pro-arrhythmogenic effect of vandetanib, Vandetanib at a dose of 300 mg is associated 
with a substantial and concentration dependent prolongation in QTc (mean 28msec, median 35 msec). 
First  QT  prolongations  occurred  most  often  in  the  first  3  months  of  treatment,  but  continued  to  first 
occur after this time. Actually, this effect does not lessen over time and the half-life of vandetanib (19 
days) renders this prolongation in QTc interval particularly problematic. Prolonged QTc≥500msec was 
more  frequent  in  female  patients  (75%  versus  25%  in  male).  The  frequency  of  QTc≥500msec  was 
particularly  increased  in  subgroups  of  patients  with  hypertension  (20%),  diarrhoea  (>20%),  serum 
Mg<LLN (31.3%) and with baseline cardiac impairment (32.1%). 
Overall,  31  (13.4%)  vandetanib  patients  had  QTc  (Bazett’s)  ≥500  ms  compared  with  1.0%  placebo 
patients,  and  8  (3.47%)  vandetanib  patients  had  QTc  ≥550  ms  or  increase  from  baseline  ≥100  ms,

based  on  a  single  value  during  randomised  treatment.  Globally,  there  was  no  difference  between  the 
different  groups  regarding  sex  ration  and  median  age.  However,  when  it  comes  up  to  patients  with 
QTc≥500msec, the sex ratio is different (M/F=0.33) (25% M / 75% F).   
QTc  increase  is  an  AE.  The  mechanism  of  action  and  both  preclinical  and  pharmacological  studies  in 
humans have shown an explanation for the concentration related increase in QTc. Torsades de Pointes 
have been observed. Cases of sudden death have also been observed not linked to cases of Torsades 
de  Pointes  nor  exposure.  This  risk is of  further  concern  in  a  drug  with  a  very  long  half life  (19  days) 
and  as  diarrhoea  is  one  of  the  main  disease  related  symptom  and  side-effect  of  the  drug.  Another 
additional  risk  factor  is  the  further  risk  of  dehydration  and  consequent  renal  impairment;  in  addition, 
vandetanib has also shown a deterioration of renal function (increase in creatinine). Duration of follow 
up  in  the  pivotal  study  is  quite  short  with  regard  to  the  need  for  long  duration  of  treatment  and 
therefore the risk of developing further major Cardiac SAEs including Torsades de Pointes. 
There were 35 AEs reported under the cardiac SOC, including 6 SAEs and 5 fatal SAEs. It appears that 
there  were  2  Atrial  Fibrillation  (1  fatal),  1  Supraventricular  Extrasystoles,  7  supraventricular 
arrhythmia  (1  fatal),  4  Sinus  Bradycardia,  3  Bundle  Branch  Block  Left,  1  arrhythmia  (1  fatal),  4 
Bradycardia  (1  fatal),  2  Tachycardia  (1  SAE),  1  Nodal  Arrhythmia,  1  Ventricular  Tachycardia. 
Furthermore,  there  were  2  sudden  deaths  (in  patients  with  QTc  >550  ms),  and  4  suspected  sudden 
deaths.   
Although no Torsades de Pointes have been reported as such in study 58, 5 cases have been reported 
to the Clinical Trial Unit of Afssaps.  
Additional expert consultations 
Considering  vandetanib  induced  QTcF-prolongation  and  the  observed  cardiac  events  and  sudden 
deaths in the pivotal study as well as Torsades de Pointes in other indications, the SAG was asked to 
discuss  the  importance  of  QTcF  prolongation  and  its  clinical  consequences  in  this  clinical  setting.  The 
SAG  was  also  asked  to  discuss  specific  measures  that  could  be  recommended  to  prevent,  limit  and 
control  the  specific  cardiac  risk  in  clinical  practice  in  an  oncology  unit,  and  specifically  whether  such 
treatment should be administered in relation with specialised cardiological advice/follow-up.  
SAG’s conclusion:  
The  QT  interval  is  an  important  measurement  to  identify  patients  at  risk  of  developing  ventricular 
arrhythmias and sudden death. Pharmacological and clinical observations (interference with potassium 
channels, mechanism of Torsades de Pointes, clinical observation of Torsades de Pointes, and cardiac 
deaths  even  if  judged  as  unrelated  to  the  study  drug)  provide  strong  evidence  of  an  important 
association between vandetanib and increased risk of clinically significant cardiac events. Of particular 
concern are the long half-life of the drug, the drug-related diarrhoea potentially inducing hypokalemia, 
drug-drug  interactions  such  as  with  SSRIs,  deterioration  of  renal  function,  and  the  long  treatment 
duration,  all  of  which  may  contribute  to  increase  the  risk  of  arrhythmias  and  sudden  death.  Selected 
patients  could  a  priori  have  an  increased  risk,  such  as  those  with  a  genetically  determined  long  QTc 
interval. 
A prerequisite for commencing treatment with vandetanib is the correct measurement of QT interval, if 
necessary by experienced cardiologists. The QTcF interval should be <480 msec prior to start. Patients 
Assessment report  
Page 70/88
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
with  a  QT  interval  of  >480  msec  are  at  increased  risk  of  arrhythmias  and  sudden  death,  but  the 
precise magnitude of the risk is unknown. Patients who develop QTcF >480 msec should be referred to 
a cardiologist for identification of risk factors and follow-up. 
Adequate  information  should  be  provided  to  patients  and  health  care  professionals  on  minimising 
concomitant  risks,  such  as  the  need  to  identify  increased  diarrhoea  and  the  need  to  strictly  control 
diarrhoea  in  view  of  the  risk  of  developing  hypokalemia,  monitoring  of  renal  function  and  serum 
potassium  at  appropriate  intervals,  avoiding  adverse  drug-drug  interactions,  prompt  referral  to  a 
cardiologist in case of patients at increased risk of arrhythmias and sudden death.  
Although  it  is  difficult  to  try  to  restrict  use  of  vandetanib  to  specialised  centres,  it  is  important  to 
recommend that treating oncologists should have extensive experience in identifying and managing the 
risk  of  ventricular  arrhythmias  and  sudden  death  associated  to  vandetanib,  and  that  specialist 
cardiologic  advice  be  available  promptly  when  needed.  Overall,  the  SAG  agreed  on  the  risk 
minimisation measures presented. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
To  prevent  and  limit  the  safety  concerns,  the  following  aspects  have  been  reflected  into  the  Product 
Information: 
  A  recommendation  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC  with  regards  to  treatment  initiation  and 
supervision  by  a  physician  experienced  in  treatment  of  MTC  and  in  the  use  of  anticancer 
medicinal products and experienced in the assessment of ECG. 
  A  contraindication  in  section  4.3  of  the  SmPC  with  regards  to  congenital  long  QTc  syndrome, 
patients with an increased QTc interval over 480 msec and the concomitant use of vandetanib 
with drugs known to also prolong the QT interval and / or induce Torsades de Pointes (arsenic, 
cisapride,  erythromycine  IV,  toremifene,  mizolastine,  moxifloxacine,  Class  IA  and  III 
antiarrhythmics). 
 
a  precaution  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  with  regards  to  QTc  prolongation.  Patients  who 
develop  a  single  value  of  a  QTc  interval  of  greater  than  500 msec  should  stop  taking 
vandetanib.  Dosing  can  be  resumed  at  a  reduced  dose  after  return  of  the  QTc  interval  to 
pretreatment  status  has  been  confirmed  and  correction  of  possible  electrolyte  imbalance  has 
been made. 
 
a statement in section 4.5 of the SmPC noting that Vandetanib has been shown to prolong the 
ECG  QT  interval  and  Torsades  de  Pointes  have  been  uncommonly  reported.  Therefore,  the 
concomitant  use  of  vandetanib  with  drugs  known  to  also  prolong  the  QT  interval  and  /  or 
induce  Torsades  de  Pointes  is  either  contra-indicated  or  not  recommended  depending  on 
existing alternative therapies: 
  Combinations  contraindicated:  cisapride,  erythromycine  IV,  toremifen,  mizolastine, 
moxifloxacine, arsenic, ,Class I A and III antiarrhythmics  
Assessment report  
Page 71/88
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  Combinations  not  recommended:  methadone,  haloperidol,  amisulpride,  chlorpromazine, 
sulpiride, and zuclopenthixol), halofantrine, pentamidine and lumefantrine. 
If  there  is  no  appropriate  alternative  therapy,  not  recommended  combinations  of  such 
medicinal  products  with  vandetanib  may  be  made  with  additional  ECG  monitoring  of  the  QTc 
interval, evaluation of electrolytes and further control at onset or worsening of diarrhoea. 
 
a  statement  in  section  4.5  of  the  SmPC  noting  that  Posterior  reversible  encephalopathy 
syndrome,  PRES  (Reversible  posterior  leukoencephalopathy  syndrome-RPLS)  has  been 
observed infrequently with vandetanib treatment in combination with chemotherapy. PRES has 
also been observed in patients receiving vandetanib as monotherapy. This syndrome should be 
considered in any patient presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion or 
altered  mental  function.  Brain  MRI  should  be  performed  in  any  patient  presenting  with 
seizures, confusion or altered mental status. 
In  addition  to  this,  extensive  physician  and  patient  information  with  regard  to  the  risks  of  QTc 
prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, PRES/RPLS and their management will be provided.

efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The co-administration of vandetanib and 
medicinal products excreted by P-gp, such as dabigatran or digoxin, may result in 
increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. Patients receiving 
dabigatran or digoxin and vandetanib may require increased clinical and biological 
surveillance and appropriate dose adjustments, if needed. 
Vandetanib coadministered with metformin. Vandetanib is an inhibitor of the 
organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2). Therefore, vandetanib may have the potential 
to decrease the elimination of medicinal products known to be excreted by OCT2 
and to increase a patient’s exposure to these medicinal products. Metformin is a 
substrate of OCT2; patients who are receiving vandetanib and metformin (or other 
substrate of OCT2) may require more careful monitoring and possible dose 
adjustment of metformin. 
June 2013 
Vandetanib coadministered with antacids ( omeprazole or ranitidine). The effect of 
proton pump inhibitors  or histamine agonists on the gastrointestinal absorption of 
vandetanib has not been determined. Vandetanib demonstrates pH-dependent 
solubility; therefore, the co-administration of vandetanib with proton pump 
inhibitors or histamine agonists may reduce a patient’s exposure to vandetanib.   
June 2013 
Vandetanib coadministered with midazolam. Vandetanib has the potential to induce

the CYP3A4 enzyme system. Co-administration of vandetanib and medicinal 
products primarily metabolised by the CYP3A4 enzyme system may result in 
decreased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products that could reduce or 
shorten therapeutic effects. Therefore, appropriate dose adjustments may be 
required. 
The following additional risk minimisation activities were required:  
  Before and after product launch, the MAH must provide the SmPC, sufficient Patient Alert Cards 
(see Annex 10) for each prescription, and health care professional (HCP) educational material 
about  the  risks  of  QTc  prolongation,  Torsades  de  Pointes  and  PRES  and  their  management 
according to the SmPC, to all HCPs who are expected to prescribe the product. The MAH shall 
agree  the  educational  material  with  the  national  competent  authority  before  launch  of  the 
product in the authority’s state.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In  the  current  submission,  the  Applicant  has  mainly  provided  results  taken  from  one  pivotal  study 
(Study  58).    Two  supportive  studies  (Studies  08  and  68)  were  also  submitted,  both  performed  in  a 
limited number of patients with hereditary medullary thyroid cancer.  
Study 58 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the efficacy and safety 
of vandetanib versus placebo in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC. In the 
primary analysis, the superiority of vandetanib as compared to placebo was demonstrated, with a 11.2 
months increase (19.3 vs 30.5 months) of median PFS (HR=0.46, 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.69, p=0.0001).   
The  superiority  of  vandetanib  over  placebo  is  clinically  significant  and  quite  consistent  across  all  pre 
planned  subgroups.  More  benefit  from  vandetanib  was  seen  in  patients  with  a  CTN  or  CEA  doubling 
time < 24 months compared to patients with a longer doubling time and in patients with symptoms at 
baseline. 
The  terms  “symptomatic  and  aggressive”  disease  correspond  to  a  rapid  deterioration  of  clinical 
condition (clinical, biological and radiological signs) i.e., patients at urgent need of treatment 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The activity of vandetanib in RET mutation negative patients is indirectly supported by the activity of 
the  drug  observed  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  RET  unknown  status.  Further  data  from  study  58 
provided  in  the  post-hoc  analysis  of  RET  negative  patients  (including  those  patients  classified  as  RET 
unknown,  with  the  M918T  mutation)  showed  efficacy.  Therefore,  the  available  evidence  supports  the 
efficacy of vandetanib in RET negative tumours using the most frequent mutation (80%-92%).  . It is 
not  certain  however  that  those  patients  tested  RET  negative  for  M918T  mutation  are  not  positive  for 
mutation  on  other  exons.  It  is  equally  not  certain  that  those  patients  tested  RET  negative  from  old 
tumour sample were still RET negative at the time of initiation of treatment. Therefore, it is difficult to 
draw an unequivocal conclusion of the size of the benefit of vandetanib in patients with RET mutation 
negative tumours. Given that the precise mechanism of action of vandetanib in RET remains unclear, 
the absolute benefit in these patients should be more precisely/directly determined. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions have been diarrhoea, rash, nausea, hypertension, 
and headache. Regarding the pro-arrhythmogenic effect, Vandetanib at a dose of 300 mg is associated 
with a substantial and concentration dependent prolongation in QTc (mean 28msec, median 35 msec). 
First  QT  prolongations  occurred  most  often  in  the  first  3  months  of  treatment,  but  continued  to  first 
occur after this time. This effect does not lessen over time. Prolonged QTc ≥ msec was more frequent 
in  female  patients  (75%  versus  25%  in  male),  Frequency  of  QTc  msec  was  particularly  increased  in 
subgroups of patients with hypertension (20%), diarrhoea (>20%), serum Mg<LLN (31.3%) and with 
baseline cardiac impairment (32.1%). 
Assessment report  
Page 81/88
 
 
 
   
 
The mechanism of action and both preclinical and pharmacological studies  have shown an explanation 
for  the  concentration  related  increase  in  QTc.  Torsades  de  Pointes  have  been  observed.  Cases  of 
sudden death have also been observed not linked to cases of Torsades de Pointes nor exposure. This 
risk is of further concern in a drug with a very long half life (19 days) and with diarrhoea as one of the 
main  disease  related  symptoms.  Another  additional  risk  factor  is  the  further  risk  of  dehydration  and 
consequent renal impairment; in addition, vandetanib has also shown a deterioration of renal function 
(increase in creatinine).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In view of the toxicity profile of vandetanib at the 300 mg dose, at least in some patients the 
safety of the 300 mg dose may be a concern; there is a need to further study the optimal 
dose with the aim to maximise the benefit-risk balance, Additional data on safety and 
activity of a lower dose will be provided through a randomized dose-finding trial looking at 
safety and activity of 150mg vs 300mg dose of vandetanib (Study D4200C00097), with 
overall response rate as the primary endpoint. The trial is due to be completed in October 
2015. (see Section 2.7 Pharmacovigilance) 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In  the  overall  population, improvement  in  PFS,  ORR  and  DCR  are  of  importance  as  well  as  a  positive 
effect  on  some  PRO.  The  management  of  the  risk  of  QT  prolongation  and  associated  clinical 
consequences and renal risks associated with vandetanib are particularly important.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The  restriction  of  the  indication  to  patients  with  symptomatic  and  aggressive  disease  allows  to  select 
patients  who  are  at  urgent  need  of  treatment  for  medullary  thyroid  cancer.  It  is  in  this  patient 
population that the benefits outweigh the important risks outlined. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
To  prevent  and  limit  the  concern  on  QT  prolongation  and  clinical  consequences  associated  with 
vandetanib, the following measures have been implemented in the Product Information. : 
  A  recommendation  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC  with  regards  to  treatment  initiation  and 
supervision  by  a  physician  experienced  in  treatment  of  MTC  and  in  the  use  of  anticancer 
medicinal products and experienced in the assessment of ECG. 
  A  contraindication  in  section  4.3  of  the  SmPC  with  regards  to  congenital  long  QTc  syndrome, 
patients with an increased QTc interval over 480 msec and the concomitant use of vandetanib 
with drugs known to also prolong the QT interval and / or induce Torsades de Pointes (arsenic, 
cisapride,  erythromycine  IV,  toremifene,  mizolastine,  moxifloxacine,  Class  IA  and  III 
antiarrhythmics). 
 
a  precaution  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  with  regards  to  QTc  prolongation.  Patients  who 
develop  a  single  value  of  corrected  ECG  QTc  interval  of  at  least  500 msec  should  stop  taking 
vandetanib. Dosing can be resumed at a reduced dose after return of the ECG QTc interval to 
pretreatment  status  has  been  confirmed  and  correction  of  possible  electrolyte  imbalance  has 
been made. 
Assessment report  
Page 82/88
 
 
 
   
 
 
a statement in section 4.5 of the SmPC noting that Vandetanib has been shown to prolong the 
ECG  QT  interval  and  Torsades  de  Pointes  have  been  uncommonly  reported.  Therefore,  the 
concomitant  use  of  vandetanib  with  drugs  known  to  also  prolong  the  QT  interval  and  /  or 
induce  Torsades  de  Pointes  is  either  contra-indicated  or  not  recommended  depending  on 
existing alternative therapies. 
If  there  is  no  appropriate  alternative  therapy,  not  recommended  combinations  of  such 
medicinal  products  with  vandetanib  may  be  made  with  additional  ECG  monitoring  of  the  QTc 
interval, evaluation of electrolytes and further control at onset or worsening of diarrhoea. 
In  addition  to  this,  extensive  physician  and  patient  information  with  regard  to  the  risks  of  QTc 
prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and their management will be provided. 
Although the results of the randomised, placebo controlled, phase III trial fully support the positive 
balance of benefits and risks, there is still the need to obtain further data to confirm the magnitude of 
the effect of vandetanib in patients with RET mutation negative tumours.  
Following consultation with the applicant, the CHMP considered the granting of a conditional marketing 
authorisation  vandetanib.    Vandetanib  aims  at  the  treatment  of  seriously  debilitating  diseases  or  life-
threatening diseases and falls within the scope of Commission Regulation 507/2006 on the conditional 
marketing  authorisation.  The  Committee  found  that  although  comprehensive  clinical  data  referring  to 
the  efficacy  of  the  medicinal  product  had  not  been  supplied,  all  of  the  following  requirements  were 
met: 
 
The risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product, as defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 
2001/83/EC, is positive 
Based  on  the  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  presented  in  patients  with 
unresectable  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  MTC,  the  superiority  of  vandetanib  was  demonstrated 
compared  to  placebo,  with  a  11.2  months  increase  (19.3  vs  30.5  months)  of  median  PFS  (HR=0.46, 
95% CI, 0.31 to 0.69, p=0.0001).  The benefit risk balance of vandetanib in patients with unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer is therefore considered to be positive. 
From  a  quantitative  viewpoint,  the  specific  benefit  in  patients  with  RET  -  tumours  might  be  less  as 
compared  with  what  was  observed  in  RET+  tumours.  There  is  a  need  to  further  confirm  such 
differences in terms of efficacy in RET negative patients with vandetanib,  
 
It is likely that the applicant will in a position to provide comprehensive clinical data 
Comprehensive clinical data will be provided through an open label study of vandetanib in patients with 
sporadic medullary thyroid cancer with known RET mutation status. Data will be collected and analyzed 
at  pre-specified  times.  The  final  analysis  will  be  performed  when  at  least  40  patients  identified  with 
RET mutation and 40 patients identified without evidence of RET mutation have been enrolled into the 
study and received vandetanib for 14 months. This study will include 50 - 60% of patients who receive 
vandetanib within the EU. Patients will be followed for 2 years and an interim analysis will be presented 
12  months  after  first  inclusion.  The  study  is  considered  feasible  and  it  is  therefore  likely  that  the 
applicant will in a position to provide comprehensive clinical data.

Patients with MTC can be cured only by thyroidectomy, performed when the tumour is confined to the 
thyroid gland.  The tumour is relatively unresponsive to conventional doses of radiation therapy and to 
chemotherapeutic  regimens  (none  of  which  have  been  approved  in  this  indication  yet).  Caprelsa  is 
intended for the treatment of aggressive and symptomatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in patients 
with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. The CHMP concluded that the product fulfils 
an unmet medical need due to the lack of available alternative treatments in this population. 
 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product  
concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required 
The CHMP considered that the potential risks inherent in marketing vandetanib for the specific 
indication while additional, more comprehensive data will be available in the future would be offset by 
the benefit to patients with aggressive and symptomatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in patients 
with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. The CHMP agreed that the RMP for 
vandetanib in the approved indication was adequate to address any identified and unknown risks. 
The CHMP concluded that all the requirements for the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation 
had been met.

Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  consensus 
that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Caprelsa  in  the  treatment  of  “aggressive  and  symptomatic  medullary 
thyroid cancer (MTC) in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease (For patients 
win whom Rearranged during Transfection (RET) mutation is not known or is negative, a possible lower 
benefit should be taken into account before individual treatment decision(see important information in 
sections  4.4  and  5.1))”  is  favourable  and  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  conditional 
marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

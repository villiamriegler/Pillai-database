SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
INTRODUCTION 
Zoledronic  acid  is  a  “third-generation”  nitrogen-containing  bisphosphonate  and  as  such,  inhibits 
osteoclast mediated bone resorption. An intravenous formulation of zoledronic acid has been approved 
in  over  96 countries  worldwide,  including  Europe,  under  the  trade  name  of  Zometa  for  several 
indications, including tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, treatment of patients with multiple myeloma, 
and treatment of bone metastases from solid tumours.  
For  the  indication  Paget's  disease  of  bone,  zoledronic  acid  is  approved  worldwide  under  the  trade 
name Aclasta as of 15 June 2007 in over 70 [A1]countries and as Reclast in the United States.  
In  July  2007,  Aclasta  received  a  positive  CHMP  opinion  for  the  treatment  of  post-menopausal 
osteoporosis (PMO) in women at increased risk of fracture. 
Aclasta is presented in vials of 5 mg in 5 ml of solution for dilution with 100 ml of isotonic saline or 
dextrose.  The  presentation  intended  for  the  market  was  also  used  in  most  of  the  clinical  studies  of 
PMO. It consists of 5 mg zoledronic acid in 100 ml of solution, containing mannitol as an isotonising 
agent.[A3] 
Zoledronic  acid  in  the  treatment  of  PMO  and  in  the  indication  proposed  in  this  variation  is 
administered once a year as a 5 mg i.v. infusion over at least 15 minutes. 
The purpose of the current submission for a Type II variation for Aclasta was to seek approval for an 
extension  of  indication  to  include  the  prevention  of  clinical  fractures  after  hip  fracture  in  men  and 
women.  This  indication  however  was  not  in  line  with  the  “Guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  new 
medicinal products in the treatment of primary osteoporosis” and the indication wording was therefore 
changed  during  the  procedure,  also  in  view  of  the  indication  in  the  male  population.  Based  on  the 
provided  safety  data  for  the  extension  of  indication,  the  MAH  also  proposed  to  change  the 
recommendation  not  to  treat  patients  with  a  creatinine  clearance  cut-off  less  than  40 ml/min  to 
35 ml/min.  
The  MAH  has  reanalysed  data  for  the  male  subpopulation  in  the  hip  fracture  study  2310  and  has 
provided  comparisons  between  the  male  and  female  subpopulations  in  this  study  as  well  as 
comparisons with the postmenopausal population in the larger study 2301. Study 2301 was the pivotal 
study  for  approval  of  the  indication  “Treatment  of  osteoporosis  in  post-menopausal  women  at 
increased  risk  of  fracture”  (variation  H/C/595/II/10).  Further  data  from  the  supportive  study  2308, 
which  compared  the  effects  on  BMD  of  Aclasta  and  alendronate  treatment  in  male  osteoporosis 
patients, have also been assessed.  
Development programme/Compliance with CHMP Guidance/Scientific Advice 
The  MAH  has  previously  received  3  Scientific  Advices  on  the  development  program  in  PMO,  in 
November 2001, in January 2003 and in June 2005. The first 2 advices were mainly concerned with 
the pre-clinical development but the 2001 advice also addressed the plan to perform a study in patients 
following a recent hip fracture. This plan was considered acceptable but it was recommended to study 
males and females separately. Furthermore, to support the indication “treatment of osteoporosis after 
acute hip fracture” it was considered a requirement to have available at least interim results from the 
large PMO trial.

General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP  
All studies fully adhered to GCP guidelines of the CHMP and Directive 91/507/EEC of the European 
Union. All studies were closely monitored by the MAH or a contract organisation for compliance to 
the protocols and procedures described in them.  
NON CLINICAL ASPECTS  
In vitro data 
Data  on  efficacy  in  vitro  was  included  in  the  submission  of  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  for 
Aclasta  and  was  demonstrated  in  vitro in cultures  of  murine calvaria.  No further  preclinical  in  vitro 
data was submitted for this variation. 
In vivo data 
The  MAH  submitted  further  data  from  four  pre-clinical  studies  on  fracture  healing  during  the 
procedure. 
The effect of zoledronic acid (zoledronic acid) on fracture healing in laboratory animals was studied 
using three different animal models: 
• 
• 
• 
Distraction osteogenesis in the rabbit tibial diaphysis (Little, et al 2003; Smith, et al 2004) 
Critical size defect healing in the rat femoral diaphysis (Little, et al 2005) 
Closed fracture healing in the rat femoral diaphysis (Amanat, et al 2007) 
Three studies published up to the end of 2005 were assessed within the type II variation to extend the 
indication to include osteoporosis in post-menopausal women (II-10). Subsequently new results from 
an additional study became available in 2007 (Amanat, et al 2007).  
Overall,  the  results  of  the  Amanat,  et  al  2007  study  in  the  rat  closed  fracture  model  indicated  that 
administration of zoledronic acid at 0, 1 and 2 weeks post-fracture increases the size and strength of 
the callus without exerting any apparent deleterious effects on the fracture healing process. The timing 
of the zoledronic acid infusion, post-fracture, markedly affected the magnitude of these local effects in 
the callus as well as the relative distribution of drug between the callus and the rest of the skeleton.  
Discussion on non-clinical aspects  
Although the 1-2 week post-fracture timeframe from the rat study may not be directly applicable to the 
clinical situation, timing of the dose played an important role in the modulation of callus properties, 
and delaying the dose resulted in a stronger callus. The MAH pointed out that this short-term rat study 
revealed that the timing of bisphosphonate therapy following fracture affected callus size and strength 
as well as the distribution of drug between the fracture site and the rest of the skeleton. Although the 
fracture  repair  process  in  the  rat  closed  fracture  model  closely  resembles  that  occurring  in  human 
bone, it has to be taken into consideration that bone metabolism is more active in skeletally immature, 
young rats than in osteoporotic bone of adult humans. 
For  example,  dosing  immediately  after  fracture  would  be  expected  to  produce  a  systemic  exposure 
pattern  similar  to  that  in  a  patient  without  a  fracture,  with  little  drug  binding  to  the  fracture  site. 
Consequently, the potential positive effect of zoledronic acid on callus strength would be suboptimal. 
In the alternative scenario, delayed dosing post-fracture should result in high drug binding to the callus 
and maximal mechanical benefit at the fracture site.  
However, as the callus remodels, the bound zoledronic acid will be released and redistributed to new 
sites  of  active  bone  turnover  where  it  will  again  be  able  to  exert  its  anti-resorptive  activity.  (In  the 
long-term  distraction  osteogenesis  study  in  rabbits  treated  with  zoledronic  acid, the  callus  was  fully 
remodelled  by  44  weeks,  presumably  releasing  the  drug  that  had  initially  been  bound  to  the  callus 
(Smith, et al 2004). Whilst the rat experiments have demonstrated the potential of zoledronic acid to 
increase  callus  strength  when  administered  during  the  initial  weeks  post-fracture,  they  were  not 
designed  to  address  the  clinical  observation  that  delayed  dosing  apparently  enhances  anti-fracture 
efficacy; thus they provide little pertinent information on this topic.

The  CHMP  noted  that  in  the  animal  models,  delayed  dosing  of  the  zoledronic  acid  clearly  led  to 
increased binding of the drug in the fracture area and increased BMC and callus volume as compared 
with  dosing  at  the  time  of  fracture.  There  is  also  a  plausible  mechanistic  explanation  to  this  that 
probably  applies  to  both  animals  and  humans.  It  therefore  seems  very  likely  that  delayed  dosing  in 
humans  would  give  better  results  than  dosing  immediately  after  fracture  and  information  about  the 
ideal  timing  after  fracture  repair  was  therefore  included  in  the  SPC  as  discussed  in  section  clinical 
efficacy below. 
CLINICAL ASPECTS 
Introduction 
Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterised by low bone mass and micro-architectural 
deterioration of bone tissue, with consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures. 
Age and menopause are the two main determinants of osteoporosis. Asian or white ethnic origin, 
underweight, dietary calcium deficiency, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol use, family history, and cigarette 
smoking appear to be independent risk factors for osteoporotic fractures.  
Most  osteoporotic  fractures  occur  in  women  because  they  have  lower  peak  bone  mass  than  men. 
Additionally, the effect of menopause increases the risk of fracture at any given age, and women have 
a higher life expectancy. However, the life-time risk of fragility fractures in men is also considered as 
a  significant  public  health  issue.  No  WHO  definition  for  osteoporosis  exists  for  men.  However,  in 
clinical  practice  the  same  cut-off  for  the  diagnosis  of  osteoporosis  in  men,  i.e.  BMD  below  -2.5 
standard deviations of the female reference range, has been used. Epidemiological studies have shown 
a similar relationship between BMD and fracture risk in men and in postmenopausal women, i.e. the 
predictive value of BMD for the occurrence of fractures is similar in men and in women.  
Prevalent  fractures  also  predict  the  risk  of  future  fractures  to  the  same  extent  in  both  genders,  and 
numerous studies have reported increased risks of hip, spine and other fractures among patients who 
had previously diagnosed fractures. It has also been demonstrated that patients with hip fractures lose 
bone and muscle mass in the year following the fracture. 
Other independent risk factors (e.g. family history of hip fracture, alcohol or tobacco use) have not, 
however,  been  validated  to  the  same  extent  in  men  as  in  women.  Clinical  trials  of  pharmacological 
intervention in osteoporotic men have shown BMD increases and changes in biochemical markers of 
bone turnover similar to those observed in postmenopausal women. The limited available fracture data 
in men show that, when observed, the degree of reduction in vertebral fractures and height loss in men 
was consistent with that observed in postmenopausal women. 
The  goal  of  osteoporosis  therapy  is  prevention  of  fractures  in  susceptible  patients.  The  appropriate 
timing  and  proper  use  of  agents  such  as  calcium,  vitamin  D,  estrogen,  bisphosphonates,  calcitonin, 
PTH, and raloxifene and the role of exercise have generated major research efforts and considerable 
controversy. Intake of adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D and continuing moderate weight-
bearing  exercise,  are  basic  preventive  measures  for  persons  of  all  ages.  Orally  administered 
bisphosphonates have low bioavailability but are widely used to prevent fractures in the osteoporotic 
population.  
In  July  2007,  Aclasta  was  approved  for  the  treatment  of  post-menopausal  osteoporosis  with  once 
yearly  i.v.  administration.  Currently,  no  i.v.  bisphosphonate  has  been  approved  for  the  treatment  of 
osteoporosis in men. 
According  to  the  EMEA  guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  new  medicinal  products  in  the  treatment  of 
primary osteoporosis, “the clinical significance of osteoporosis lies in the fractures that occur”. This 
statement seems to be true also for other forms of osteoporosis (resulting from immobilisation, from 
diseases such as hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis or from the use of drugs 
such as glucocorticoids or from hormonal ablation therapy).

In most studies on osteoporosis, DXA measurements of lumbar spine BMD and often also of total hip 
BMD and femoral neck BMD, have been important study parameters. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Key  PK/PD  studies,  were  conducted  in  patients  with  bone  metastases,  receiving  single  or  multiple 
infusions  of  2 – 16 mg  zoledronic  acid,  and  presented  in  earlier  submissions  for  the  Marketing 
Authorisation  of  zoledronic  acid  in  the  oncologic  indication,  and  1  subsequent  PK/PD  study. 
Additional pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in either patients with Paget’s disease or 
in patients with osteoporosis. 
Clinical efficacy 
Results  from  a  Phase  III,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  clinical  trial  intended  to 
demonstrate  efficacy  for  the  use  of  zoledronic  acid  in  the  prevention  of  clinical  fractures  after  hip 
fracture  (study  2310)  were  submitted.  This  study  was  considered  pivotal  for  this  extension  of 
indication procedure. 
The  MAH  presented  during  the  procedure  also  further  supportive  analyses  from  study  2308,  which 
was  a  double-blind  double-dummy  randomised  active-controlled  2-arm  trial  comparing  the  efficacy 
and safety of  i.v. zoledronic acid with oral alendronate in osteoporotic men. 
Study 2310 
This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven study to assess the efficacy of 
intravenous  zoledronic  acid  in  preventing  subsequent  clinical  fractures  after  a  hip  fracture  with 
surgery.  Recruitment  was  from  148  sites  around  the  world.  The  population  included  both  men  and 
women who had surgical repair of a low-trauma hip fracture within 90 days of study entry. Patients 
were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either zoledronic acid or placebo.  
The trial was event-driven. It was planned to enrol approximately 2038 patients to yield 211 patients 
with confirmed clinical fracture events. There were two planned interim analyses after approximately 
70  and  140  patients,  respectively,  had  experienced  confirmed  clinical  fracture events.  Following  the 
2nd  interim  analysis,  a  3rd  interim  analysis  was  requested  by  the  drug  safety  monitoring  board 
(DSMB). After review of this interim analysis based on 185 patients with confirmed clinical fracture 
events in November of 2006, the DSMB recommended study close-out over a 90-day period. 
Participants 
Males and females who were 50 years old or older and who had had surgical repair of an acute hip 
fracture caused by low - energy -trauma within 90 days of randomisation (according to the inclusion 
criteria  before  amendment  3  in  April  2003,  patients  should  be  included  within  42  days  after  hip 
fracture  surgery)  [A5]and  who  were  ambulatory  prior  to  the  fracture  were  included  in  this  study. 
Important  exclusion  criteria  were:  calculated  creatinine  clearance  ≤  30 ml/min,  history  of  iritis  or 
uveitis, serum calcium > 2.75 mmol/l, serum alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 x upper normal limit, serum 
corrected  calcium  <  2.0  mmol/l  and  prior  use  of  oral  bisphosphonates  during  the  last  2  years. 
Concurrent treatment with other bisphosphonates, sodium fluoride, PTH and PTH analogs, strontium 
and anabolic steroids (except for testosterone substitution in hypogonadal men) was not allowed, and 
specific washout periods for each treatment were required. 
Treatments 
Zoledronic acid 5 mg or placebo were administered to study patients every 12 months until the study 
was completed. With a study amendment, the number of doses was limited to three but by the time of 
this  amendment,  a  number  of  patients  had  already  received four  doses  and  one patient  had received 
five doses of study drug. The study drug was given as a slow intravenous infusion during over at least 
15 minutes. All study patients received a loading dose of 75.000 – 125.000 units of vitamin D2 i.m. or 
orally  once  or  50.000  –  75.000  units  of  vitamin  D3  i.m.  or  orally  once  prior  to  randomisation.  All 
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
5
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients  thereafter  received  a  maintenance  dose  of  800  –  1200  units  of  oral  vitamin  D  daily.  All 
patients received elemental calcium 1000 – 1500 mg orally daily in a divided dose.  
Patients received their study drug infusion at any time from day 14 (amended from Day 7) following 
vitamin D2 or D3 administration up to 90 days after surgical repair of their hip fracture. 
All  patients  without  contraindication  to  paracetamol  were  provided  with  a  standard  dose  of 
paracetamol  for  72  hours  following  each  dose  of  study  drug,  to  treat  post-dose  symptoms  of  fever, 
myalgia, arthralgia and bone pain. 
These  “usual  care  medications”  excluded  other  bisphosphonates  but  included  hormone  replacement 
therapy  (HRT),  selective  estrogen  receptor  modulators  (SERMs),  calcitonin,  tibolone,  tamoxifen, 
dehydroepiandrosterone 
and 
medroxyprogesterone. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either zoledronic acid or placebo. 
An intravenous formulation of the study drug was administered annually at randomisation, at Year 1, 
and at Year 2.

Study Objectives 
The primary efficacy variable was the time to first clinical fracture. Only the fractures confirmed by a 
Clinical Endpoint Committee were counted as clinical fractures in the time-to-event analysis. 
Differences between treatments were compared using a log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier estimates of 
the  survival  functions  for  each  treatment  were  also  calculated.  The  superiority  of  zoledronic  acid 
relative to placebo was concluded if the statistical significance was achieved at the 3.51% level with 
respect to the time to first clinical fracture being longer for zoledronic acid-treated patients than for 
placebo-treated  patients.  The  significance  level  was  adjusted  to  account  for  3  interim  analyses 
previously conducted.  
The following key secondary efficacy variables were evaluated. 
1.  Other clinical fracture endpoints including time to first clinical vertebral fracture, time to first 
hip fracture, time to first non-vertebral fracture.  
2.  BMD:  Percent  change  from  baseline  at  each  analysis  visit  was  assessed  at the  total  hip  and 
femoral neck, using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), of the non-fracture hip.  
3.  Hospitalisation: Between-treatment difference in the number of patients being hospitalised at 
least once at any time post-randomisation was evaluated using Fisher’s exact test. 
Sample size 
A total of 2127 patients were randomised to treatment and of these, 2111 patients received at least one 
study drug infusion. 
ITT population: All randomised patients (n = 2127)  
PP population: ITT patients who did not have a major protocol violation (n = 1909) 
Safety population: All randomised patients who were exposed to study drug (n = 2111) 
All  efficacy  endpoints  were  analysed  using  the  ITT  population,  which  included  all  randomised 
patients. A total of 2127 patients were randomised to treatment, 1065 patients to zoledronic acid and 
1062  patients  to  placebo.  In  total,  508  men  (24%)  were  randomised  and  1619  women  (76%).  The 
safety population included 2111 patients who were exposed to at least one study drug infusion. 
Results – Study 2310 
Demographic data 
Demographic characteristics of patients were comparable for the two treatment groups. The majority 
of patients were Caucasian (91.11%) and female (76.12%). The median age was 76 years (range: 50 to 
98); 27.08% of patients were between 65 and 74 years old and 55.81% were more than 75 years of 
age.  Overall,  the  two  treatment  groups  were  similar  with  respect  to  all  baseline  disease  and 
background  characteristics.  More  than  half  of  all  patients  were  from  Western  and  Eastern  Europe 
(58.34%).  Baseline  mean  standardised  femoral  neck  and  hip  BMD  values  were  similar  for  the  two 
treatment groups. Nearly 42% of all patients had a femoral neck T-score of ≤  -2.5.

Approximately  46%  of  patients  received  their  first  infusion  of  study  drug  within  6  weeks  after  hip 
fracture surgery and 54% received their first infusion of study drug more than 6 weeks following hip 
surgery. The median number of days from hip surgery to the time of the first infusion was 47.0 for 
zoledronic acid and 44.5 for placebo. 
Baseline  creatinine  clearance  values  were  comparable  for  the  two  treatment  groups.  Approximately 
40% of all patients had mild to moderate renal impairment at baseline (baseline creatinine clearance ≥ 
30 ml/min and < 60 ml/min). 
Participant flow 
The  discontinuation  rates  were  very  variable  between  different  centres,  however  the  discontinuation 
rates in the zoledronic acid group were lying in the same  magnitude as in the placebo group with a 
slightly  higher  discontinuation  rate  in  the  patients  that  received  zoledronic  acid  when  death  was 
excluded  as a reason for discontinuation [A6](see table 1). 
Table 1: Patient disposition, ITT population, study 2310. 
The treatment groups were well balanced with regard to demographic and other baseline factors. The 
patients were elderly, mainly females. About 40% had osteoporosis as defined by a T-score of ≤–2.5 
and about 60% had osteoporosis based on the criteria of previous radiographic fracture with femoral 
neck T-score > -2.5. 
Comorbidities 
Active medical conditions at randomisation were representative of an elderly population with typical 
chronic  comorbidities.  The  most  commonly  reported  active  medical  conditions  (i.e.,  ≥  10.0%  of  all 
patients) were the following: hypertension (49.86% zoledronic acid vs. 50.56% placebo), osteoarthritis 
(19.15%  zoledronic  acid  vs.  17.89%  placebo),  depression  (15.59%  zoledronic  acid  vs.  16.85% 
placebo),  osteoporosis  (13.99%  zoledronic  acid  vs.  13.84%  placebo),  insomnia  (13.99%  zoledronic 
acid  vs.  11.68% placebo),  constipation  (12.21%  zoledronic  acid  vs.  13.18%  placebo),  and  diabetes 
mellitus (10.89% zoledronic acid vs. 9.98% placebo). 
Concomitant medication 
Overall,  the  distribution  of  concomitant  medication  use  (which  may  have  been  started  prior  to  first 
study  drug  administration  or  at  anytime  during  the  conduct  of  the  study)  was  similar  between  the 
treatment groups. The three most commonly used concomitant medications (apart from vitamin D and 
calcium) prior to and after start of study drug infusion were over-the-counter pain relievers including 
paracetamol,  acetylsalicylic  acid,  and  furosemide,  all  of  which  were  used  comparably  in  the  two 
treatment groups 
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
7
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
According to the protocol, all patients received a loading dose of 75,000–125,000 units of vitamin D2 
or 50,000–75,000 units of vitamin D3 i.m. or orally. All patients immediately thereafter began a daily 
maintenance dose of oral vitamin D (800–1200 IU) and oral elemental calcium (1000–1500 mg in a 
divided dose). 
The comparably high proportion of patients receiving paracetamol after start of study drug reflects the 
recommended use of paracetamol to reduce post-dose symptoms as per study protocol. 
Concomitant use of other bisphosphonates was not permitted during the study. Nevertheless, a number 
of patients in both study arms (more patients in the placebo group) had other bisphosphonates during 
the study. The difference between groups in this aspect could be explained with the higher incidence 
of fractures in the placebo group. 
Efficacy results:  
In the ITT population, 231 patients had at least one adjudicated clinical fracture (92 in the zoledronic 
acid and 139 in the placebo group). A between-treatment comparison of the incidence of first clinical 
fracture is presented in Table 3-7. For the primary analysis in the ITT population, the hazard ratio of 
0.65 (95% CI:  0.50  to  0.84)  for  the  zoledronic  acid  group  versus  the  placebo  group  represents  a 
35% reduction in the risk of clinical fractures over time (p = 0.0012). 
1) n is the number of patients with a fracture. 
2) The event rate is from Kaplan-Meier estimate at Month 24. 
3) The hazard ratio and 95% CI of zoledronic acid vs. placebo are computed from a Cox proportional hazards 
regression model with treatment as a factor. A hazard ratio < 1 implies that zoledronic acid-treated patients have 
a lower risk of having a fracture than placebo-treated patients. 
4) The p-value is calculated from a log-rank test. Note: Facial, skull, digital fractures, fracture due to metastatic 
cancer or osteomyelitis, or high energy trauma were not considered as endpoints in the analysis.

Kaplan-Meier curves for the cumulative clinical fracture rate are presented in Figure 3-1. After Month 
36 the number of patients who were at risk of clinical fracture was 129 on zoledronic acid and 119 on 
placebo.  
Primary efficacy variable 
Zoledronic acid-treated patients experienced at least a 33% reduction in the risk of clinical fractures 
over time relative to placebo-treated patients in the following demographic subgroups: age < 65 and 
age  ≥ 75 years;  female  gender;  Caucasian  and  “Other”  ethnicity.  The  ≥  33%  reductions  were 
statistically significant for Caucasians, females, and patients aged ≥ 75 years (all three categories, p < 
0.005). For all subgroups, the 24-month event rate was numerically lower in the zoledronic acid group 
compared  to  the  placebo  group.  In  addition,  there  was  no  evidence  of  any  treatment-by-factor 
interactions for any of the demographic subgroups (all interaction p-values > 0.10), 
Disease factors evaluated for the primary efficacy variable, time to first clinical fracture, were baseline 
femoral neck T-score (≤ -2.5, > -2.5) and baseline BMI (kg/m2). 
Zoledronic acid-treated patients experienced at least a 30% reduction in the risk of clinical fractures 
over time relative to placebo-treated patients for baseline BMI ≤ 22.6 kg/ m2, 22.6 < baseline BMI ≤ 
26.3, and both baseline femoral neck T-scores (≤ -2.5, > -2.5). The ≥ 30% reductions were statistically 
significant at the 0.05 level for baseline BMI ≤ 22.6 kg/ m2, and both femoral neck T-score categories. 
The time of receiving the first study infusion after hip fracture surgery (≤ 6 weeks, > 6 weeks) was 
evaluated for all clinical fracture endpoints. 
The sub-group analysis with regard to the timing of administration after hip surgery, suggested better 
efficacy when zoledronic acid is given more than 6 weeks after surgery. At all sites there was a trend 
for  better  protection  against    fractures.  In  contrast,  when  the  infusion  was  less  than  6  weeks  from 
surgery,  for  subsequent  hip  fracture,  there  was  an  increased  risk  of  fracture  in  the  zoledronic  acid 
group (p=0.44).  However, when patients treated in the first 2 weeks after the hip fracture surgery are 
excluded, a significant reduction in hip fractures was observed in zoledronic acid treated patients.  
Secondary efficacy variables  
The percent changes from baseline in femoral neck BMD were significantly greater for 
zoledronic  acid-treated  patients  relative  to  placebo-treated  patients  at  Months  12,  24,  and  36  (all 
p < 0.005). Treatment with zoledronic acid resulted in an increase of 0.76%, 2.21%, and 3.62% (least 
squares mean) at Months 12, 24, and 36, while treatment with placebo resulted in a decrease of 1.73%, 
2.08%, and 0.73% respectively.

In  both  males  and  females,  there  were  statistically  significant  differences  in  percentage  change  in 
BMD  for  total  hip  when  comparing  zoledronic  acid  with  placebo,  and  at  all  timepoints.  In  the 
zoledronic  acid  group,  the  increase  in  BMD  was  less  pronounced  in  males  at  12  and  24  months 
compared  with  females  and  in  the  placebo  group,  the  decrease  in  BMD  was  less  pronounced  at  all 
timepoints in males compared with females. Results for between treatment differences in femoral neck 
BMD changes were statistically significant for males at 24 and 36 months.  
Time to first non-vertebral, hip and clinical vertebral fractures 
Analyses on the PP population showed findings very similar to those presented for the ITT population. 
Subgroup  analyses  were  performed  for  the  incidence  of  non-vertebral,  hip  and  clinical  vertebral 
fractures by the time of first infusion following hip fracture surgery (≤ 6 weeks or > 6 weeks). The risk 
reductions observed for the early infusion as well as for the late infusion groups were not statistically 
significant (p > 0.05). 
The incidence of new hip fractures was low. The 2-year event rates for hip fracture, based on Kaplan-
Meier estimates were 2.02 and 3.46 % for the zoledronic acid and placebo groups, respectively. The 
estimated hazard ratio was 0.70 (95 % CI: 0.41 – 1.19, p = 0.1815). 
A 61 % risk reduction in hip fractures was seen in zoledronic acid-treated patients who got their first 
infusion more than 6 weeks after surgery. For patients who received their first infusion within 6 weeks 
after surgery, there was a greater risk of hip fractures in the zoledronic acid group, with an estimated 
hazard  ratio  of  1.37  (95  %  CI:  0.62  –  3.01,  p  =  0.4376).  However,  as  shown  in  further  analyses 
provided by the applicant, exclusion of the patients who received their first infusion within 2 weeks 
after surgery resulted in greater significant anti-fracture efficacy for all fracture subgroups (including 
hip fractures) (see also p18). 
Closed testing procedure 
The following fracture endpoints were evaluated as part of the closed testing procedure: time to first 
clinical vertebral fracture (6th endpoint), time to first hip fracture (7th endpoint), and time to first non-
vertebral  fracture  (8th  endpoint).  The  incidence  of  clinical  vertebral  fractures  was  significantly 
reduced  by  zoledronic  acid  relative  to  placebo.  An  estimated  hazard  ratio  of  0.54  [95%  CI:  0.32  to 
0.92, p = 0.0210] corresponds to a 46% reduction in the risk of a clinical vertebral fracture over time. 
Although the number of new hip fractures was low since surgical repair of the entry hip often involved 
arthroplasty, implying that any hip fractures that occurred during the study could only have occurred 
in the other hip, the zoledronic acid group had a numerically lower risk in hip fractures compared to 
the placebo group. An estimated hazard ratio of 0.70 [95% CI: 0.41 to 1.19, p = 0.1815] corresponds 
to a 30% reduction in the risk of a hip fracture over time. The requirements for the success of the 7th 
endpoint were not met, and, therefore, the 10-step closed testing procedure stops here. 
Further  secondary  endpoints  included  measure  of  resource  utilisation.  There  were  no  statistically 
significant  differences  between  treatment  groups  with  respect  to  the  percentages  of  patients  with  at 
least  one  hospitalisation,  clinic,  or  home  health care visit.  However,  zoledronic  acid-treated  patients 
had 4% fewer emergency room (ER) visits compared with placebo-treated patients (p = 0.0114). 
Comparison of baseline risk factors between subpopulations 
The MAH presented the comparability of the baseline characteristics and incidence of fractures for the 
male  placebo-treated  patients  in  Study  2310  to  the  placebo-treated  PMO  patients  in  Study  2301.  A 
summary  of  these  results  is  provided  in  Table  1-5  and  1-6,  where  it  is  shown  that  in  the  placebo 
groups,  the  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  cumulative  incidence  of  clinical  fractures  at  24  months  was 
nearly identical between placebo populations (8.70% in Study 2310 versus 8.59% in Study 2301).

population in Study 2301. 
Table 1-6 Between-treatment comparison of the incidence of first clinical fracture between 
placebo-treated males in Study 2301 and placebo-treated PMO patients in Study 2301 
The overall risk of clinical fractures of the placebo-treated male patients in Study 2310 (20 patients, 
8.70%) is similar to that of the placebo-treated PMO patients in Study 2301 (456 patients, 8.59%) (HR 
= 0.90, p=0.6374). Of these 20 male placebo-treated patients who had clinical fractures during study 
2310, 15/20 (75.0%) experienced non-vertebral fractures, 7/20 (35.0%) experienced hip fractures, and 
6/30 (30.0%) experienced clinical vertebral fractures. In comparison, of the 456 placebo-treated PMO 
patients  from  Study  2301  who  had  clinical  fractures,  388/456  (85.1%)  experienced  non-vertebral 
fractures, 88/456 (19.3%) experienced hip fractures and 84/456 (18.4%) experienced clinical vertebral 
fractures.  
Analysis of BMD changes by gender 
Given the different reference ranges for BMD in men and women, the absolute change and 
percentage change from baseline was taken into account to assess the similarity of the 
increases in total hip BMD observed for zoledronic acid between males in Study 2310 and females in 
Study 2301. A summary of these results are provided in Table 1-3 and Table 1-4 for total hip BMD 
where it is shown that, at Month 24 for both the percentage change and the change in total hip BMD 
from  baseline,  similar  increases  in  zoledronic  acid-treated  male  patients  from  Study  2310  and 
zoledronic  acid-treated  PMO  patients  from  Study  2301  were  observed.  Month  24  most  accurately 
reflects the median treatment duration (23 months) in study 2310.

Analysis of efficacy by gender 
The analysis  of  incidence of  clinical  fractures  by  gender  in  study  2310  showed that  zoledronic  acid 
reduced  the  risk  of  clinical  fractures  in  females  and  males  by  39%  and  15%  respectively.  Further 
subdivision  by  types  of  fracture  (non-vertebral,  hip,  and  clinical  vertebral)  indicated  that  zoledronic 
acid-treated  females  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  risk  of  non-vertebral 
fractures (HR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.93) and clinical vertebral fractures (HR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.28, 
0.90).    For  hip  fractures,  zoledronic  acid-treated  females  had  a  25%  reduction  in  the  risk  of  hip 
fractures during the study (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.42, 1.35).  
In contrast, the small number of fractures occurring for each subtype in male patients (16 in zoledronic 
acid-treated  patients  and  20  in  placebo-treated  patients),  results  in  wide  confidence  intervals  for  the 
estimates of the hazard ratios. For non-vertebral fractures, the risk of such events was equal between 
the  two  treatment  groups  (HR  =  1.00,  95%  CI:  0.48,  2.38)  while  for  clinical  vertebral  fractures, 
zoledronic acid-treated males had a 28% reduction in the risk of such events (HR =0.72, 95% CI: 0.41, 
1.78).  For hip fractures, zoledronic acid-treated males reduced the risk of hip fractures by 55% (HR = 
0.45, 95% CI: 0.12, 1.75).

with treatment, region, sex, and treatment-by-sex interaction in the model. 
Femoral neck BMD 
A between-treatment comparison of the percentage change from baseline in standardised femoral neck 
BMD by time point and gender showed that for male patients, treatment with zoledronic acid resulted 
in  increases  in  femoral  neck  BMD  of  0.91%,  1.42%,  and  6.53%  at  months  12,  24,  and  36  while 
treatment with placebo resulted in decreases of 0.54%, 2.41% and 0.82% respectively. The differences 
between treatment groups were significantly greater for zoledronic acid vs. placebo at months 24 and 
36 (both p < 0.005) but only a trend towards significance was observed at month 12 (p = 0.0645). For 
females, treatment with zoledronic acid resulted in increases in femoral neck BMD of 0.72%, 2.40%, 
and  2.75%  at  months  12,  24,  and  36  while  treatment  with  placebo  resulted  in  decreases  of  2.10%, 
2.00%, and 0.57% respectively. The differences between treatment groups were significantly greater 
for zoledronic acid vs. placebo 
Timing of first infusion and changes in BMD 
Analysis of the percentage change in  total hip BMD by timing of the first infusion in 2-week intervals 
showed that significant improvements compared to placebo at 12 months were obtained when the first 
infusion was given > 2 weeks after surgical hip repair for total hip BMD (Table 7-7) and >6 weeks for 
femoral  neck  BMD  (Table  7-9).  At  24  months,  there  were  statistically  significant  improvements 
compared to placebo in total hip BMD at all time points (Table 7-8), and when first infusion was given 
>  4  weeks  in  femoral  neck  BMD  (Table  7-10).  However,  the  numerical  increases  in  femoral  neck 
BMD observed at Month 24 for those zoledronic acid-treated patients dosed within two weeks of hip 
fracture surgery (4.58%) are comparable to that which is observed in other categories; however, the 
small  groups  sizes  (18  on  zoledronic  acid  and  21  on  placebo)  would  require  huge  differences  to  be 
observed  for  statistical  significance  to  be  demonstrated.  The  LS  Mean  difference  of  4.58%  is 
comparable to what is observed over other time periods.

In study 2310, a constant increase in BMD at all time intervals was observed at the total hip without 
any specific trend with timing of first infusion (Figure 5-1).

Timing of first infusion and changes in antifracture efficacy 
In order to further analyse the relation between timing of first dose and antifracture efficacy, the MAH 
performed a subgroup analysis based on 2 week intervals. Results are shown in Figure 5-2. 
Figure 5-2 Variation in risk reduction of clinical fracture with timing of first dose over 12 weeks 
in 2 week intervals. 
Timing of first infusion and changes in mortality 
All time points except the > 12 week group have confidence intervals that crossed 1, with the ≤ 2 week 
group showing the largest variation (Figure 5-3). This time to effect interaction is subject to significant 
confounders. When the data is subdivided into 2-week time intervals, there is no treatment-by-timing 
interaction as was shown when analysing timing as a continuous variable in the analysis of risk factors 
for  death.  Several  studies  have  demonstrated  a  very  high  peri-  and  post-operative  mortality  in  hip 
fracture patients, which amounts to 9% within the first 30 days and 19% within 120 days (Moran, et al 
2005; Robbins, et al 2006). Thus, patients receiving their first dose early after fracture repair may well 
exhibit  a  higher  degree  of  fragility,  and  therefore  higher  mortality,  than  patients  dosed  later.  This 
finding is also corroborated in study 2310. Patients in the ≤ 2 week group were older and exhibited a 
higher  baseline  prevalence  of  hypertension,  coronary  artery  disease,  diabetes,  atrial  fibrillation,  and 
stroke  (Table  5-1).  Moreover,  as  shown  in  Table  5-2,  these  differences  were  reflected  in  higher 
placebo mortality in this sub-group (17.71%). In patients dosed > 2 weeks from hip fracture repair, the 
cumulative incidence of mortality as estimated by Kaplan-Meier varied between 20.86% in the >6-8 
week group to 13.53% in the >8-10 weeks group.

Overall antifracture efficacy and mortality benefit after exclusion of 2 week group 
From the graphical presentation of efficacy and mortality results shown above, patients dosed within 
2 weeks  show  responses  very  different  from  the  rest  of  the  cohort.  Therefore,  in  order  to  test  the 
sensitivity  of  the  within  2  week  group  on  the  overall  results,  between-treatment  differences  in  the 
incidence  of  all  clinical,  non-vertebral,  clinical  vertebral,  hip  fractures,  and  mortality  were  analysed 
excluding patients who were dosed within 14 days or less from hip fracture repair (Figure 5-3).

Including only those patients dosed > 2 weeks from hip fracture repair, the magnitude of reduction for 
all  endpoints  increased  relative  to  the  overall  result,  and  leads  to  a  significant  reduction  in  hip 
fractures.  Clinical  fractures  were  reduced  by  41%  (p=0.0002),  non-vertebral  fractures  44% 
(p=0.0077), clinical vertebral fractures 53% (p=0.0084) and hip fractures 48% (p=0.0305). Mortality 
also had a significant 30% reduction (p=0.0095). Thus, exclusion of the ≤ 2 week group resulted in 
greater significant anti-fracture efficacy for all fracture subgroups and a more pronounced reduction of 
mortality. It should be noted that, in patients doses ≤ 2 weeks after fracture repair, the results within 
this  time  period  show  higher  event  rates  across  both  treatment  groups,  which  were  considered  to 
confound the effects observed with zoledronic acid therapy 
Study 2308 
This  was  a  supportive  double-blind  double-dummy  randomised  active-controlled  2-arm  trial 
comparing the efficacy and safety of i.v. zoledronic acid with oral alendronate for 24 months in the 
target population of osteoporotic men. 302 males with primary osteoporosis or significant osteoporosis 
secondary to hypogonadism received zoledronic acid (5 mg i.v. yearly infusion) or active control (oral 
alendronate 70 mg once weekly). 
Inclusion criteria in this study were: age 25 - 85 years, BMD ≤ -2.0 SD at the femoral neck and ≤ -1.0 
SD at the lumbar spine or ≤ -1.0 SD at the femoral neck and at least 1 prevalent vertebral deformity as 
defined by the modified Genant method for males or a documented history of an osteoporotic clinical 
fracture.  
The  primary  efficacy  objective  was  to  show  that  the  %  change  in  lumbar  spine  BMD  at  month  24 
relative to baseline was non-inferior to the % change in lumbar spine BMD in those men treated with 
alendronate. This would be shown if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for 
the  treatment  difference  of  the  percentage  change  in  lumbar  spine  BMD  at  month  24  relative  to 
baseline was greater than the non-inferiority margin ∆ = -1.5%, in the ITT and PP populations. The 
non-inferiority  margin  was  based  on  the  results  of  a  placebo-controlled  study  of  oral  alendronate 
10 mg daily in male osteoporosis (Orwoll et al 2000) and a study comparing alendronate 10 mg daily 
and 70 mg once weekly in postmenopausal osteoporosis (Schnitzer et al. 2000). The “last observation 
carried forward” (LOCF) methodology was applied for the primary efficacy analyses.

In this study, 154 patients were included to receive zoledronic acid and 148 patients alendronate (ITT 
population).  Patients  in  the  alendronate  group  took  placebo  as  i.v.  infusion,  and  patients  in  the 
zoledronic  acid  group  took  placebo  capsules  as  oral  study  medication.  137  patients  completed  the 
study in the zoledronic acid arm, while 124 patients completed the study under alendronate. 
Efficacy results 
In the tables and figures below the main study results in relation to BMD and bone formation and –
resorption markers are presented. 
As  shown  in  table  4-11,  in  both  studies  the  lumbar  spine,  hip  and  femoral  neck  BMDs    increased 
approximately at a similar rate until month 12, while slightly higher increases in total hip and femoral 
neck BMD could be seen between months 12-24 in the female population from study 2301 compared 
with study 2308.

Bone resorption markers 
The  level  of  bone  resorption  marker  serum  beta-CTX  was  significantly  lower  in  the  group  that 
received zoledronic acid at all timepoints (except Month 12 and Month 24), with a marked drop after 
each  injection,  compared  to  the  alendronate  group,  which  showed  a  higher  reduction  of  beta-CTX 
level only at Month 12 and comparable reduction at Month 24 (see figure 4.1).[A15]

Bone formation markers 
The level of amino-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP), which is produced during the 
build-up  of  collagen  1  in  osteogenesis  and  reflects  osteoblast  activity,  dropped  after  initiation  of 
therapy for both substances, with a higher initial reduction of P1NP after each injection in the group 
that received zoledronic acid. However, the reduction of P1NP was greater in the alendronate group at 
Month  12  and  9-11  days  after  the  second  infusion  and  was  statistically  significant  less  prior  to  the 
second infusion and 3 and 6 months after the second infusion and was equal at Month 24 (see figure 
4.2).

Incidence of fractures 
Study  2308  was not  powered  to  detect  treatment  differences  in  fracture rates. There  were  4  patients 
(2.6 %) in the zoledronic acid group and 6 patients (4.1 %) in the comparator group who had a new 
vertebral fracture in the study. 
Discussion and conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Study 2310 
The  efficacy  results  of  this  study  showed  that  zoledronic  acid  is  effective  in  delaying  the  time  to 
subsequent clinical fracture after a hip fracture with surgery. Zoledronic acid significantly reduced the 
risk of clinical fractures relative to placebo in the total study population and was superior to placebo in 
increasing  or  preserving  total  hip  BMD  and  femoral  neck  BMD  at  all  time  points  Zoledronic  acid 
demonstrated equal 35% reductions in the incidence of clinical fractures in those patients who were 
less than 75 years of age compared to those who were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. Unlike 
most  other  studies  on  osteoporosis,  study  2310  did  not  record  lumbar  spine  BMD  routinely  in  the 
study population. It has to be emphasised that the study population consisted of patients over the age 
of 50 who had suffered a hip fracture caused by low energy trauma. 
The  CHMP  also  noted  that  the  mean  age  in  study  2310  was  slightly  higher  than  in  the  previously 
assessed  postmenopausal  osteoporosis  study  2301.  The  age  range  in  Study  2310  was  50-98  years 
(mean  74.5  years  and  median  76 years),  while  in  Study  2301  the  age  range  was  64-89  (mean  73.1 
years and median 73 years). 
The reduction in fracture rate was statistically and clinically significant. The reduction over 24 months 
was similar to that observed in the 2301 trial in postmenopausal osteoporosis over 36 months (event 
rate 8.40% versus 12.9% in the zoledronic acid group and placebo group, respectively, see variation 
EMEA/H/C/595/II/010), suggesting that these patients were at a higher risk for fracture compared with 
the study 2301 patient population, which can be expected considering that previous fracture is a well 
known and strong risk factor for fracture. 
Stratification in study 2310 and concomitant therapy 
Concerning results for the different strata the MAH presented that Study 2310 differed from the large 
pivotal post-menopausal trial 2301 in that patients were not randomised to a stratum based on their use 
of concomitant osteoporosis medications. When study 2310 began, approximately 10% or less of hip 
fracture patients were expected to receive therapy for their osteoporosis (Torgerson and Dolan 1998; 
Colon-Emeric, et al 2000a; Colon-Emeric, et al 2000b; Kamel, et al 2000). It was assumed that this 
usage  level  of  concomitant  osteoporosis  therapies  had  no  anti-fracture  efficacy  at  the  hip  (e.g. 
calcitonin;  SERMs;  hormone  replacement  therapy  [HRT];  tibolone;  DHEA[s],  ipriflavone;  and 
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
21
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
testosterone,  as  hormone  replacement  in  the  case  of  hypogonadal  men)  and  would  have  no 
consequential effect on the trial’s outcome and thus were permitted.  
It is agreed that the data observed in study 2310 support this assumption; approximately 5% of patients 
(53/1065,  4.98%  of  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  55/1062;  5.18%  of  the  placebo  group)  reported 
taking an osteoporosis medication prior to randomisation, and this rose to approximately 10% during 
the trial (99/1065 [9.3%] patients in the zoledronic acid group and 125/1062 [11.7%] patients in the 
placebo group). 
Discussion on bridging of efficacy data in males 
The  inclusion  of  men  in  study  2310  provided  new  information  regarding  efficacy  and  safety  in  an 
additional sub-group, although the number of male patients was relatively low (less than 25% of the 
study population). This reflects the general higher prevalence of osteoporosis in females as compared 
with males. 
The BMD results were seen in the light of the current concept of bridging data from postmenopausal 
females  to  males  according  to  the  recent  revision  of  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  evaluation  of 
medicinal products in the treatment of primary osteoporosis. The four criteria for bridging include: 
-  a study duration of at least 1 year, 
-  justification of the dosage,  
-  similar risk for fractures as in postmenopausal females and  
-  the magnitude of the BMD changes versus placebo have to match the magnitude of changes    
   observed in postmenopausal females.  
The Guideline however refers to a separate bridging study in men, which is not the case with Study 
2310,  as  men  were  only  a  sub-population  of  that  study.  The  CHMP  considered  that  this  would  be 
acceptable considering the relatively large sub-group of males in study 2310. Furthermore, the CHMP 
pointed  out  that  supportive  evidence  was  provided  from  an  active  controlled  trial  in  males  (Study 
2308). 
To justify the bridging between male and female BMD data, the MAH presented study data for total 
hip and femoral neck BMD for men at 12 and 24 months from study 2310. Of the males, 64 (26.2 %) 
received  one  study  drug  infusion,  112  (45.9  %)  received  two  infusions,  59  (24.2  %)  received  three 
infusions and 9 (3.7 %) received four study drug infusions. 
The number of patients was relatively large (approximately 25% of the total sample size), and similar 
to  the  number  of  patients  that  have  been  included  in  separate  trials  in  men  previously  with  other 
agents.  
Study duration and justification of the dosage 
The  study  duration  was  in  line  with  the  guideline.  The  justification  for  the  dosage  was  previously 
assessed in the extension of indication to include PMO with variation II/10.  In the previously assessed 
dose finding study, study 0041, the effect of the different doses of zoledronic acid was studied up to 12 
months. Bone resorption markers reached a peak at 1 month and bone formation marker at 3 months 
and all markers remained suppressed until 12 months for all doses. The CHMP therefore considered it 
doubtful if the duration of bone turnover suppression is directly correlated with the dose. In addition, 
there are no data on the effects of lower doses than 5 mg of zoledronic acid on bone markers after a 
longer period than 12 months. 
The need for a justification of the dose for Bridging in the Guideline was based on potential gender-
based difference in absorption of oral forms. It is however of no importance in this case since Aclasta 
is administered intravenously. 
Risk for fractures - comparability of the male and female populations and their baseline BMD 
The  fracture  incidences  seem  to  differ  between  the  male  population  in  study  2310  and  the  female 
population  in  study  2301 when  the  placebo  groups  are  compared.  It  was  therefore  questioned  if the 
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
22
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fracture risk was similar in the male population in study 2310 and the post-menopausal population in 
study 2301. 
Men and women have different body structures due to height and weight and thus comparing baseline 
BMD in the traditional sense can often be confounded. This is reflected by the differences in baseline 
BMD  shown  in  Table  1-1  despite  the  age  and  BMI  being  similar  across  the  populations.  These 
differences  are  not  unexpected  given  that  the  reference  values  for  femoral  neck  BMD  and  total  hip 
BMD  are  generally  about 10%  higher  for  males  than  females  as  characterised  by  the  data  available 
from NHANES III (Looker, et al 1998). The differences observed between the male population from 
Study  2310  and  the  PMO  population  from  Study  2301  are  consistent  with  what  has  been  observed 
between the observational cohort populations studies for males in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men 
(MrOS)  Study  (Orwoll,  et  al  2005)  and  for  females  in  the  Study  of  Osteoporotic  Fractures  (SOF) 
(Cummings, et al 2006). A comparison of the populations studied in MrOS and SOF are presented in 
Table 1-2. 
Table 1-1 Comparison of baseline characteristics for male patients in Study 2310 to the PMO 
population in Study 2301. 
Table 1-2 Comparison of baseline characteristics for male patients in MrOs to the PMO 
population in SOF 
It was considered acceptable to use total hip and femoral neck BMD data for bridging in this case as 
the  Guideline  does  not  specify  what  localisation  the  BMD  should  be  recorded  at  and  as  practical 
difficulties in study 2310 precluded measuring of lumbar spine BMD. Whether the Region of Interest 
(ROI)  should  be  femoral  neck  or  total  hip  is  currently  debated.  Accordingly,  the  recommendations 
differ between guidelines, such as those of the international Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and those 
of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD). In the PMO study 2301 assessed for the 
extension  of  indication  to  include  PMO  (Variation  II-10)  femoral  neck  BMD  was  used  for  the 
diagnosis  of  osteoporosis.  Therefore,  for  evaluation  of  clinical  trial  results,  both  sites  were 
documented and analysed. 
In view of the fracture risk, the CHMP noted that concerning the age distribution, in Study 2310, more 
than  one  fourth  of  the  males  were  below  the  age  of  65,  although  men  with  primary  OP  are  usually 
older compared with females when they develop osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related fractures. This 
may imply a lower risk for fracture in this study as the fracture risk is strongly associated with age in 
both males and females. 
The mean and median age, however, was similar comparing the patients populations, post-menopausal 
women in study 2301 and males in Study 2310, as a larger proportion of male patients in Study 2310 
were 75 years of age or older.  
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
23
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conversely to the above, this would imply a higher risk of fracture. In terms of BMD at baseline, the 
CHMP considered that populations differ significantly. Less than 40% of the male patients in Study 
2310  were  osteoporotic  at  baseline  compared  with  over  70%  of  the  females  in  Study  2301.  As  the 
BMD  is  one  of  the  strongest  risk  factors  for  fractures,  the  fracture  risk  cannot  automatically  be 
considered the same based on these data.  
On the other hand, a recent low trauma hip fracture is a strong risk factor for further fractures and in 
this  situation  was  considered  to  override  the  other  factors  related  to  the  risk  of  fractures.  In  Study 
2310, a recent hip fracture was an entry criterion and in Study 2301, 63% had at least one prevalent 
vertebral  fracture  at  baseline.  Thus,  both  populations  can  be  regarded  as  high-risk  populations  for 
fractures. Furthermore, annualised fracture rates in the placebo arms were similar in both studies (the 
clinical  fracture  rate  for  PMO  women  in  Study  2301  was  4.28%  and  for  men  in  Study  2310  was 
4.35%). 
Comparisons of the baseline risk factors between Study 2301 and Study 2310 are considered difficult 
given that all patients in Study 2310 were required to have a hip fracture for study entry and there are 
no baseline lateral spine x-rays from Study 2310 to allow for comparison of the prevalence of baseline 
vertebral fractures for the two populations. Furthermore, it has already been established that there are 
clear  differences  in  the  percentage  of  patients  who  had  femoral  neck  BMD  T-scores  below  the 
osteoporosis threshold (41% for Study 2310 and 67% for Study 2301). 
The  CHMP  considered  that  fractures  at  baseline  could  not  be  compared  between  studies  due  to  the 
different  inclusion  criteria  for  the  studies.  However,  considering  that  all  patients  entering  trial  2310 
had to have a recent low energy trauma fracture, it can be concluded that these patients were at high 
risk  of  fracture.  Similarly,  patients  included  into  the  large  PMO  trial  were  patients  at  high  risk  for 
fracture (70 % were osteoporotic and >60 % had one or more vertebral fractures at baseline). 
The  CHMP  noted  that  more  men  in  study  2310  than  women  in  study  2301  had  active  rheumatoid 
arthritis at study inclusion. More males than females were alcoholics. Although it must be pointed out 
that the number of placebo-treated males who suffered a clinical fracture in study 2310 was low, the 
incidence of clinical fractures did not significantly differ between placebo-treated males in study 2310 
and placebo-treated PMO females in study 2301 and the point estimates are similar. Despite the low 
number  of  fractures  in  the  male  placebo  population  in  Study  2310  (n  =  20  vs.  456  in  2301),  this 
supports  a  similar  risk  for  fracture  as  in  Study  2310.  The  risk  reduction  observed  in  the  male 
population,  only  15  %,  however  remains  a  concern  as  it  is  uncertain  whether  or  not  Aclasta  would 
benefit  male  patients  in  terms  of  fracture  prevention.  The  CHMP  considered  that  this  point  will  be 
answered  in  the  ongoing  fracture  prevention  trial  with  zoledronic  acid  in  male  osteoporosis.  In  the 
spirit of the Guideline, however, a bridging based on BMD alone was considered to be sufficient to 
extend the indication to the male population. For the elderly male population, hip fractures constitute a 
large public health problem and it can be concluded that similar to females, this population is in need 
of anti-osteoporotic treatment.  
Magnitude of the BMD changes versus placebo 
In relation to the BMD increases compared to placebo, the changes in total hip BMD in the zoledronic 
arm in the 2310 male population were significantly greater at all time-points. Comparing the results 
with  the  results  for  females  in  Study  2301,  the  increase  in  BMD  was  somewhat  larger  in  females, 
except at 36 months but results derive from only 33 males for that comparison.  
In clinical practice, it is primarily the femoral neck measurement that is used for assessing BMD in 
osteoporotic  patients.  For  the  femoral  neck  measurements,  same  observations  are  made,  although  at 
24 months, the difference compared with placebo in males is primarily due to a decrease in BMD in 
the placebo group, actual increase in the active arm being only 1.42% at 24 months (compared with 
3.38% for the females in Study 2301). 
The risk factors for fractures, age and baseline BMD data were counterbalanced against the fact that 
all male patients had a low-trauma hip fracture at baseline, and as such the males in Study 2310 can be 
regarded a high-risk population. This is supported by the annualised fracture rates in the placebo arms, 
which were similar in both studies.  
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR

A main limitation was the lack of data on vertebral BMD measurements from Study 2310. This is only 
available  from  the  supportive  active  controlled  study  in  a  different  population  of  younger  males, 
including males with secondary OP and with different entry criteria with respect to BMD. Supportive 
evidence  is  provided  from  Study  2308  regarding  efficacy  on  lumbar  spine  BMD.  These  results, 
however,  demonstrated  similar  increase  in  lumbar  spine  BMD  compared  to  the  comparator 
alendronate  and  compared  with  changes  at  the  lumbar  spine  in  post-menopausal  females  in  study 
2301.  
For the bridging, comparison has been made to the population included in the main fracture prevention 
trial, Study 2301. Comparison with the female population in Study 2310 was also considered useful 
for  the  bridging.  Male  patients  in  Study  2310  were  younger  and  had  less  osteoporosis  at  baseline 
compared  with  the  females.  This  difference  in  baseline  BMD,  however,  was  less  pronounced  than 
when  comparing  baseline  BMD  in  male  patients  with  baseline  BMD  of  females  from  Study  2301. 
Thus, the CHMP pointed out that the comparison with females in Study 2310 is more valid as the male 
population was more similar to the female population in the 2310 study. 
The CHMP considered that the MAH has provided data for the absolute change in BMD from baseline 
for males and females during study period in studies 2310 and 2301 as requested. The absolute change 
in BMD for males and females were considered similar. Overall, the CHMP agreed that the between-
treatment  comparison  of  change  in  percentage  total  hip  BMD  relative  to  baseline  did  not  differ 
significantly between males and females and considered that this criterion for bridging was fulfilled. 
Limited data on fracture rate in males do not support any fracture reducing effect at this point in time. 
Females  seemed  to  be  at  greater  total  risk  of  clinical  fracture  over  time  than  males,  so  even  if  the 
majority of females in study 2301 had at least one prevalent vertebral fracture at baseline it remains to 
be  proven  that  the  fracture  risk  was  similar  in  the  male  population  in  study  2310  and  the  post-
menopausal female population in study 2301. An ongoing study with zoledronic acid in males using 
fracture as endpoint was considered to be able to answer this question in the future.  
The (non-significant) reduction in clinical fractures in study 2310 was 15% in the male population in 
Study  2310  compared  with  33%  in  Study  2301,  however  Study  2310  was  not  powered  to  show 
differences in fracture rates in subgroups. The fact that no significant effect on fracture rate in males 
could be observed is therefore reflected in the SPC section 5.1. 
Extrapolation from the population of osteoporotic males after hip fracture to the general population of 
osteoporotic men 
The  question  also  arose  whether  males  without  a  recent  hip  fracture  would  have  the  same  risk  for 
fracture.  Therefore,  a  comparison  between  the  males  in  2310  and  the  general  male  osteoporosis 
population was conducted by the MAH. 
Although there have been a high number of large observational studies conducted to examine women 
with  post-menopausal  osteoporosis,  the  number  of  large  observational  studies  examining  the 
determinants of fracture in men is limited. The first study to examine the risk of fracture solely in men 
has been the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study (Orwoll, et al 2005) which began recruiting 
patients in 2000 and is examining the causes of fracture in a cohort of 5995 men. A comparison of the 
baseline characteristics between this study and the men in Study 2310 is re-presented in Table 2-1.

Table 2-1 Comparison of baseline characteristics for male patients in Study 2310 to those 
participating in the Osteoporosis Fractures in Men Study (MrOS). 
.
While the BMD baseline data for the male populations in studies 2310 and MrOS were comparable, 
the  CHMP  however  noted  that  the  men  in  MrOS  were  nearly  10  kg  heavier  than  the  men  in  study 
2310 and  also  had  a  significantly  higher  BMI.  While  all  males  in  study  2310  had  suffered  a  hip 
fracture, only 17 % of the males in the MrOS study had a history of fracture. The study populations 
were  not  compared  for  history  of  hormonal  deficiency  or  glucocorticoid  treatment.  The  comparison 
between  baseline  data  in  the  two  studies  did  not  support  a  conclusion  that  the  population  of 
osteoporotic  males  after  hip  fracture  in  study  2310  is  representative  for  the  general  population 
of osteoporotic men. 
On  the  other  hand,  the  Guideline  only  requests  that  the  male  osteoporotic  population  should  have a 
fracture  risk  corresponding  to  the  fracture  risk  in  a  population  of  postmenopausal  women  with  an 
increased risk of fracture.  
The CHMP therefore considered that the fracture risk for the studied group of osteoporotic males was 
comparable to the fracture risk in a population of postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. 
Prevalence and characteristics of secondary osteoporosis in the male study population 
Overall,  111/508  (21.9%)  of  male  patients  randomised  in  study  2310  had  one  or  more  factor 
contributing to the presence of secondary osteoporosis. The most common factor present contributing 
to secondary osteoporosis was Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which was present in 
57/508 (11.2%) of the male patients. The proportion of males with hypogonadism in this cohort was 
0.6%. 
In two other randomised trials on treatment of male osteoporosis published so far, men with secondary 
osteoporosis except hypogonadism were excluded (Orwoll, et al 2003; Boonen, et al 2005). BMD T-
scores for inclusion in the two studies ranged between -1 to -2.5 at the lumbar spine and was -2 at the 
femoral neck. 
In  the  male  cohort  evaluated  in  Study  2310,  the  mean  femoral  neck  BMD  T-score  was  -2.31, 
indicative of a population at risk of osteoporotic fractures even without any pre-defined BMD entry 
criteria. In the two published studies, the fraction of men with hypogonadism ranged between 33 and 
50%. The anti-fracture efficacy ranged between 89% relative risk reduction in the alendronate study to 
53% for PTH(1-34). However, another study by Ringe, et al (2002) included a significant proportion 
of  males  with  secondary  osteoporosis  (60%),  and  showed  pronounced  antifracture  efficacy  of  the 
bisphosphonate tested with a 60% reduction of vertebral fractures after 1 year. 
The male subpopulation of Study 2310 constitutes a group with baseline characteristics in between the 
two randomised trials and the study by Ringe, et al (2002). However, the data summarised above show 
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
26
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that inclusion of patients with a significant proportion of secondary osteoporosis in the study did not 
affect the antifracture efficacy of bisphosphonates.  
The  CHMP  considered  that  males  with  osteoporosis  in  general  have  more  secondary  causes  of 
osteoporosis than osteoporotic females. Comparison between the male population in study 2310 and 
the two male osteoporosis studies using other bisphosphonates with respect to secondary osteoporosis 
is difficult since men with other forms of secondary osteoporosis than that caused by hypogonadism 
were excluded from study participation in the latter studies.  
On the other hand, the total number of men with secondary osteoporosis was not as high in study 2310 
as in the two other male osteoporosis studies. It can be concluded that the patient population primarily 
consisted of elderly males with age-related (primary) osteoporosis. The MAH did not refer to the non-
inferiority  study  2308  in  which  a  younger  population  was  included  and  probably  the  proportion  of 
patients with secondary osteoporosis was higher in that study, to support a general indication in males. 
Whether the patients  had  primary  or  secondary  osteoporosis,  however,  was  not considered  of  major 
importance in this case as long as the males were patients with low BMD and risk factors for future 
fractures.  The  male  population  in  study  2310,  consisting  of  elderly  men  with  a  recent  low-energy 
trauma hip fracture, can be regarded as representative of a male population that would be considered 
for treatment with bisphosphonates.  
Femoral neck BMD data 
Femoral neck T-score baseline values were missing in approximately 12 % of the patients. 42 % of 
patients in the zoledronic acid group and 41 % of patients in the placebo group had baseline femoral 
neck T-score ≤ 2.5.  
Altogether, approximately 24 % of the patients had missing values for femoral neck T-score or values 
> - 1.5 at baseline. To facilitate evaluation for male and female patients separately, baseline data was 
given separately for males and females.  
According  to  the  guideline,  the  suitable  population  for  clinical  trials  are  postmenopausal  women  at 
increased  risk  of  experiencing  osteoporotic  fractures  based  on  the  known  skeletal  independent  risk 
factors.  
Having a prevalent fracture, in this study a hip fracture, is acknowledged in the guideline as a strong 
risk factor. All patients randomised in study 2310 suffered a low trauma (fragility) hip fracture, and 
thus  are  all  considered  to  have  osteoporosis  according  to  the  general  consensus  definition  of 
osteoporosis. Using the Osteoporosis Guideline BMD criteria to define osteoporosis, 41.8% (888/2127 
patients) of the ITT population (42.3% [451/1065] of zoledronic acid patients and 41.1% [437/1062] 
of placebo patients) had a femoral neck baseline BMD T-score < -2.5 and met this criteria. It should be 
noted that 12.2% (260/2127) of patients had no baseline femoral neck BMD measurement performed 
because of technical difficulties of obtaining a DEXA scan so soon after surgery. 
The  MAH  also  reviewed  the  history  of  additional  previous  fractures.  The  majority  of  patients 
randomised, 56% (598/1065) of the zoledronic acid group and 61% (648/1062) of the placebo group, 
reported no history of a fracture beyond their incident hip fracture. For those who did report a history 
of  an  additional  fracture,  the  largest  proportion  (36%  zoledronic  acid  patients  and  32%  placebo 
patients)  reported  only  previous  non-vertebral  fracture(s).  The  remaining  patients  of  this  subgroup 
(8.4% zoledronic acid and 6.6% placebo) reported a previous vertebral fracture with or without a non-
vertebral fracture. Thus, based on previous fracture history it appears that the zoledronic acid group 
had a slightly higher fracture risk at baseline. 
Even if patients with a baseline femoral neck BMD T-score ≤ - 2.5 as well as patients with femoral 
neck BMD T-score > -2.5 at baseline had a significant lowering of the risk for clinical fracture, this 
does not mean that all T-score groups had their fracture risk lowered. Upon request of the CHMP, the 
patient  group  with  baseline  femoral  neck  BMD T-score  >  -  1.5  (12  %  of the study  population)  was 
analysed separately by the MAH.  
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
27
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The number of female patients in study 2310 with a close to normal baseline femoral neck T-score (> -
1.5) was similarly small in number (zoledronic acid N=91; placebo, N=84) to those with an unknown 
baseline  femoral  neck  BMD  (zoledronic  acid  N=103;  placebo,  N=99).  Both  sub-groups  showed  a 
reduced risk for a clinical fracture after treatment with zoledronic acid relative to placebo (44% for the 
missing baseline femoral neck BMD sub-group and 75% for baseline femoral neck T-score > -1.5 sub-
group), however, neither sub-group was large enough to reach statistical significance. When the sub-
groups  were combined,  the  risk  reduction  with  zoledronic  acid relative  to  placebo  (Hazards ratio of 
0.46, 95% CI 0.23, 0.92) achieved statistical significance (p=0.025).   
Patients with close to normal baseline femoral neck T-score as well as patients with unknown baseline 
femoral  neck  T-score  had  a  reduced  risk  of  clinical  fracture  after  treatment  with  zoledronic  acid 
relative to placebo but both groups were small and the results were not statistically significant. 
Timing of infusion post fracture 
For clinical practice, Study 2310 was considered important, as it was considered a major advantage if 
zoledronic acid could be administered immediately following a fracture. However such an approach 
has not been explored until now since in this study patients received zoledronic acid at a median time 
of more than 6 weeks after surgery (less than 5% received study drug between within 14 days from 
surgery). 
The sub-group analysis with regard to the timing of administration after hip surgery suggested better 
efficacy when zoledronic acid is given more than 2 weeks after surgery[A20]. 
Currently  it  is  very  common  for  patients  to  leave  hospitals  after  a  fracture  without  osteoporosis 
prevention and subsequent follow-up has been found to be deficient. This may partly be explained by 
different specialities dealing with fractures and with medical treatment of osteoporosis.  
The CHMP noted that patients were not randomised with regard to time from hip fracture surgery to 
first infusion of study drug. However, data suggested that for several of the study parameters, those 
patients who had their first infusion of zoledronic acid between 6 weeks and 90 days after hip surgery 
performed better than those who had their first infusion of zoledronic acid earlier than 6 weeks after 
hip fracture surgery. 
The CHMP further noted that all zoledronic acid treated patients had significantly greater % change 
from  baseline  in  femoral  neck  BMD  than  the  placebo  group.  Patients  who  got  their  first  zoledronic 
acid    infusion  later  than  6  weeks  after  hip  fracture  surgery  had  markedly  better  %    change  from 
baseline in femoral neck BMD than those who got their first zoledronic acid infusion 6 weeks or less  
after the surgery. 
In this respect, there were also concerns that bisphosphonates may affect fracture healing and this may 
be more relevant in the first period after a fracture. A recent in vivo study with zoledronic acid in a rat 
fracture model, suggested that timing of the dose played an important role in the modulation of callus 
properties,  delaying  the  dose  resulted  in  a  stronger  callus  (Amanat  et  al,  2007).  This  study  could 
possibly also explain the observed difference seen between those patients who had received their first 
dose of zoledronic acid early after hip fracture and those who received their first dose later due to a 
tendency  of  bisphosphonate  accumulation  in  the  healing  fracture.  This  would  prevent  enough 
bisphosphonate to be taken up by the rest of the skeleton.  
The  6-week  timepoint  was  initially  chosen  by  the  MAH  because  at  the  time  the  final  statistical 
analysis plan was created and blinded baseline data was reviewed, it was shown that six weeks was 
close to the approximate median time of infusion following hip fracture repair (median=46 days).  
Almost  all  of  the  patients  who  received  more  than  3  study  drug  infusions  received  their  first  study 
drug  infusion  within  6  weeks  of  hip  fracture  repair.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  prior  to  the 
implementation of Amendment 3 in 2003, all patients were randomised within 6 weeks of dosing.   
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
28
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP agreed that imbalances in baseline factors were not significant and unlikely to explain any 
differences  in  BMD  following  infusion..  The  observation  that  more  patients  were  placed  in 
rehabilitation  centres  after  discharge  in  the  ≤  6  weeks  group,  could  possibly  be  linked  to  worse 
healing. Only 42% were discharged to private residence compared with 56% in the > 6 weeks group.  
The results regarding BMD confirm the findings of the sub-group analysis for fractures, i.e. that better 
efficacy is obtained when zoledronic acid is administered at a later stage (e.g. more than 6 weeks) 
 compared with earlier after hip fracture. For total hip BMD at Month 12, the test for interaction was 
statistically significant. 
The optimal timing of infusion following a recent hip fracture was therefore further discussed and it 
was  also  considered  to  include  clear  recommendation  regarding  administration  of  zoledronic  acid 
following a hip fracture in the Product Information. 
The MAH explored the timing of first infusion after surgical repair of hip fracture and has conducted 
more  detailed  analysis  of  BMD  responses,  fracture  reduction  and  mortality  in  2-week  intervals  and 
sensitivity analysis of the overall result excluding the first two weeks.  
This analysis indicated that the small group of patients who received infusions within 2 weeks after 
fracture  repair  were  different  from  patients  receiving  infusions  later:  a)  they  exhibited  much  higher 
variability  in  their  responses;  b)  they  had  a  significant  higher  mortality;  c)  they  had  more  co-
morbidities. Finally, analysing the anti-fracture efficacy and mortality benefit in patients infused later 
than 2 weeks yielded robust reductions for the primary endpoint, all fracture subgroups and mortality. 
This analysis shows that a 2 week cut-off for the first infusion after surgical repair of hip fracture is 
more appropriate than the 6 week cut-off proposed by the CHMP. 
In  conclusion,  subgroup  analyses  at  2-week  intervals  revealed  a  consistent  effect  in  favour  of  
zoledronic acid on fractures and mortality, when the first dose was given 2 weeks or later after surgical 
hip fracture repair. Taking into consideration that Aclasta was not worse than placebo when patients 
were  treated  within  2  weeks  after  hip  fracture  surgery,  the  MAH  proposed  in  the  SPC  that  patients 
with a recent low trauma hip fracture should be dosed more than 2 weeks after hip fracture surgery. 
Thus, this was reflected in section 4.2 of the SPC. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  in  general,  there  is  no  need  for  immediate  administration  of 
bisphosphonates  after  fracture  repair  for  the  prevention  of  a  subsequent  fracture.  The  MAH  has 
provided analyses based on total hip BMD data rather than femoral neck BMD data, however there is 
currently  nothing  to  support  superiority  of  one  over  the  other  for  the  diagnosis  and  management  of 
osteoporosis.  In  this respect, results for  total hip  support  a 2-week  cut-off,  while  results  for femoral 
neck  support  a  6  week  cut-off.  Based  on  the  analyses,  the  MAH  proposed  a  2  week  interval  from 
fracture repair. 
Overall, a relationship over time in terms of efficacy after different time points following hip fracture 
repair  could  be  demonstrated,  however  it  was  considered  difficult  to  find  a  clear  cut-off  for  the 
timepoint  of  infusion.  As  a  compromise,  the  lowest  timeframe  of  infusion  after  hip  fracture  was 
determined to be 2 weeks. While it is acknowledged that any cut-off based on trends and indices, the 
CHMP  recommended  a  cautious  approach  and  therefore  the  median  time  of  6  weeks  between  the 
surgery and infusion in the study, was reflected in section 5.1 of the SPC to give further guidance to 
the treating physician. 
Effect of timing of infusion on fracture rate 
The  reduction  in  clinical  fractures,  the  primary  endpoint,  for  which  the  study  was  powered,  was 
maximal after 2 weeks. However due to the small subgroup sizes (range 100-500 patients) for the 2-
week subgroups, the confidence limits all crossed 1 except for weeks 4-6. Moreover, of all groups, the 
≤ 2 week group displayed the highest variation. Also, for the subgroups non-vertebral fractures, hip 
fractures and clinical vertebral fractures, no consistent variation of anti-fracture efficacy with time of 
infusion was seen, and the confidence intervals all crossed 1 with very few exceptions. For patients 
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
29
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
receiving  their  first  dose  ≤  2  weeks  after  surgical  repair,  the  confidence  intervals  were  consistently 
wider for all fractures. The lower limit, however, always crossed 1 in the ≤ 2week group. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  effects  of  timing  of  dosing  on  fracture  rate  show  consistently  less 
efficacy in the group of patients that received zoledronic acid 6 weeks or earlier from time of fracture. 
Overall, the difference was small but for the main osteoporotic fractures, vertebral fractures and hip 
fractures, the difference was more pronounced and is a concern. Despite the small numbers, there is a 
consistency  and  the  increase  in  hip  fracture  rate  by  37%  plus  a  treatment-by-timing  of  infusion 
interaction  that  was  statistically  significant,  add  to  the  concerns.  The  additional  analysis  dividing 
groups into 2 weeks intervals also shows consistent results,  
There is an increased risk for fractures compared with placebo for all types of fractures when patients 
received  zoledronic  acid  2  weeks  or  earlier  following  fractures.  For  vertebral  fractures  and  hip 
fractures, a consistent decrease in fracture rate is observed only in the groups receiving zoledronic acid 
> 6 weeks after fracture, but the small numbers in each sub-group make interpretation difficult. 
Effect of timing of first dose on mortality 
When  patients  are  dosed  within  6  weeks  of  hip  fracture  repair,  zoledronic  acid-patients  had  a  10% 
lower risk of death than placebo-treated patients (Hazard ratio = 0.90, p=0.5472).  When patients were 
dosed > 6 weeks after fracture repair, zoledronic acid-treated patients had a 46% lower risk of death 
than placebo-treated patients (Hazard ratio = 0.54, p=0.0022). 
When  the  timing  of  infusion  intervals  are  further  subdivided  into  two-weeks  intervals  it  could  be 
shown  that  the  reduction  in  the  risk  of  death  increases  over  time  from  an  absolute  risk  reduction 
(ARR)  of    0.3%  within  two  weeks,  to  an  ARR  of  9.3%  when  dosing  occurred more  than  12  weeks 
from hip fracture repair. It should also be noted that in none of the timing intervals was the incidence 
death  higher  for  zoledronic  acid  relative  to  placebo.  Thus,  consistent  with  what  has  shown  earlier 
regarding  the timing  of infusion  relative to  reduction in  the risk  of  fractures,  the  benefit is  obtained 
from  2  weeks  onward.  The  one  exception  to  the  results  observed  for  fractures  was  that  concerning 
mortality,  there  was  no  higher  incidence  of  death  for  the  small  group  of  patients  (N=102)  who 
received their first study drug infusion within 2 weeks of hip fracture repair. 
The analysis with respect to anti-fracture efficacy analysed for different fracture sites at entry did not 
show  any  interaction,  but  again,  small  numbers  were  considered  to  hamper  the  interpretation.  The 
effects  on  mortality  could  be  considered  consistent  with  the  anti-fracture  efficacy  by  timing-of 
infusion,  i.e.  patients  receiving  zoledronic  acid  ≤  6  weeks  from  fracture  had  only  10%  reduced 
mortality compared with 46% reduction in the > 6 weeks group. 
The  results  concerning  delayed  healing  however  did  not  cause  a  concern.  Only  4%  and  3.1%  had 
delayed  healing  in  the  groups  receiving  infusion  <  6  weeks  versus  >  6  weeks,  respectively  and 
furthermore, there was no difference compared with placebo in the < 6 weeks group.  
The  CHMP  pointed  out  that  both  BMD  data  and  fracture  data  however  support  caution,  especially 
when  giving  zoledronic  acid  less  than  2  weeks  from  the  time  of  fracture.  Furthermore,  patients 
receiving zoledronic acid needed more rehabilitation and mortality was similar to placebo in the group 
of patients receiving zoledronic acid < 6 weeks from fracture.  
For osteoporotic fractures (hip and vertebral), efficacy became only evident in the group receiving 
zoledronic acid > 2 weeks after the incident fracture and thus it could even be considered to restrict the 
use of zoledronic acid to 2 weeks following a fracture, however , the study was not powered to show a 
reduction in clinical fractures in men. [A24] 
Indication in female patients 
The results of this study in a sub-population at high risk for fractures confirm the results of the larger 
study 2301 in postmenopausal women, which was previously assessed for the approval of zoledronic 
acid for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fractures. Approval of 
a  new  indication  based  on  study  2310  was  questioned  as  the  current  indication  already  includes 
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
30
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients with osteoporosis at high risk for fractures. Comparing study populations in study 2301 and 
study  2310,  the  main  difference  is  the  recent  hip  fracture  and  the  inclusion  of  male  patients.  Both 
osteoporosis and previous fractures are well known risk factors for fractures. In both studies 2301 and 
2310 the proportion of patients with osteoporosis based on T-score and/or previous fractures was high 
(70% and 63% in study 2301 and 42% and 100% in study 2310).  Currently, the study 2310 is only 
considered supportive of the study 2301. A substantial number of study patients were considered to be 
covered by the present indication “Treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women at increased 
risk  of  fracture”.  Additionally,  the  initially  proposed  indication  wording  relating  to  prevention  of 
Osteoporosis was not in line with the “Guideline on the evaluation of new medicinal products in the 
treatment of primary osteoporosis” 
The CHMP therefore considered that study 2310 did not support a new indication for women, as the 
study  population  consisted  of  patients  with  osteoporosis  and  at  high  risk  of  fracture,  which  would 
already fall under the wording of the current indication. 
The CHMP considered it acceptable that the initially proposed two indications “Prevention of clinical 
fractures  after  hip  fractures  caused  by  low  energy  trauma  in  women  over  the  age  of  50”  and 
“Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture” were merged into 
one common indication in accordance with the guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products in 
the treatment of primary osteoporosis CPMP/EWP/552/95 Rev. 2. The MAH highlighted that no other 
prospective designed trial has studied the effects of bisphosphonate treatment on subsequent fracture 
risk in patients with a prevalent hip fracture until this point in time.  
The CHMP proposed that additional information to be included in section 4.1 of the SPC should be 
more exact than the wording proposed by the MAH. The following wording is suggested:  “Treatment 
of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women at increased risk of fracture, including those with a recent 
hip fracture” This wording was considered to be in line with the latest version of SPC Guidelines for 
section 4.1. Taken together with the indication in males, the CHMP agreed on the final wording  
 in post-menopausal women 
in men 
“Treatment of osteoporosis 
• 
• 
at increased risk of fracture, including those with a recent low-trauma hip fracture.” 
This wording was accepted by the MAH. 
Further secondary endpoints 
The CHMP considered also that the results for the secondary endpoints relating to changes in BMD 
and  fractures  confirm  the  results  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoints,  showing  a  reduction  in  risk  of 
clinical  fractures  at  various  sites  (vertebral,  non-vertebral),  although  for  hip  fractures,  the  reduction 
was  not  statistically  significant.  BMD  increased  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  decreased  in  the 
placebo group as expected based on previous trials. The increase seemed to level off during the 3rd 
year but only few patients were left in the study at that time. 
Concerning  the  analyses  on  resource  utilisation  and  Quality  of  Life  (QoL),  these  are  difficult  to 
evaluate  as  they  were  only  performed  on  certain  study  sites  and  the  proportion  of  patients  having 
received their first infusion of drug early or late differed markedly between study centres. The QoL 
measurement method used was a simple VAS scale rating method measuring “total QoL” as a single 
index value.  
The CHMP further pointed out that the clinical relevance of a 4% reduction in emergency room (ER) 
visits in the zoledronic acid group is considered questionable and is not supported by other measures 
of resource utilisation. 
Study 2308 
Although  the  study  did  not  include  a  placebo  arm,  study  2308  was  considered  supportive  of  the 
efficacy of zoledronic acid in increasing BMD in males. The mean lumbar spine, total hip and femoral 
neck  BMD % increase  from  baseline  for  zoledronic  acid  at  months  12  and  24  were  comparable 
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
31
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between studies 2308 and 2301. Lumbar spine results were considered important as these are lacking 
from  Study  2310.  Biomarker  profile  following  infusion  is  similar  to  what  has  previously  been 
observed in post-menopausal females. The rate of new morphometric fractures was similar to the rate 
in post-menopausal females, although the few cases make any interpretation in this respect uncertain. 
Information on lumbar spine BMD data from Study 2308 was included in the SPC (section 5.1)”.  
Clinical safety 
The major safety population for this indication was provided by the pivotal placebo-controlled trial, 
Study  2310.  An  independent  adjudication  committee  for  the  following  ADRs  was  established: 
hypocalcaemia, ocular AEs, avascular necrosis and delayed union/non-union, osteonecrosis of the jaw 
(ONJ), Cardiac arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation, renal AEs, cardiac/cardiovascular and stroke-related 
AEs. For the demonstration of safety in men, Safety data from the male study 2308 were pooled with 
safety data from the male subpopulation in study 2310. In addition, final safety data from the trial for 
the treatment of PMO, Study 2301 were also included, for side-by-side comparison with Study 2310, 
as  well  as  pooled  safety  data  from  these  studies.  The  safety  data  from  Study  2301  have  previously 
been assessed in a type II variation to extend the indication to include PMO (EMEA/H/C/595/II/010).  
Study 2310 
Patient exposure 
The safety population included 2111 patients who were exposed to at least one study drug infusion. In 
Study  2310,  89.5%  of  patients received  the  first  infusion  between  14  and  90  days  after  hip fracture 
surgery.    1054  patients  received  zoledronic  acid  and  1057  patients  received  placebo.  616  patients 
received only one infusion, 850 received two infusions, 569 received three, 77 received four and one 
patient  received  five  infusions  of  study  drug.  Mean  exposure  to  study  drug  was  1.95  years  for 
zoledronic acid- as well as for placebo -treated patients in the study.  The mean exposure to study drug 
was 1.95 patient years. [A27] 
Overall, of the ITT population in Study 2310, 1516 (71.3%) randomised patients completed the study, 
244 patients (11.5%) died, and an additional 367 (17.3%) patients discontinued from the study. Most 
of the patients who discontinued had only received the first infusion.  
Adverse events 
Overall, the percentage of patients experiencing AEs was similar in the zoledronic acid group (82.3%) 
and placebo group (80.6%) in Study 2310.   
The most frequently affected primary system organ classes (PSOCs, ≥ 20.0%) were ‘musculoskeletal 
and  connective  tissue  disorders’,  ‘infections  and  infestations’,  ‘injury,  poisoning  and  procedural 
complications’, ‘general disorders and administration site conditions’, ‘gastrointestinal disorders’, and 
‘nervous  system  disorders’.  Among  these  frequently  affected  PSOCs,  ‘general  disorders  and 
administration  site  conditions’  was  the  only  PSOC  with  more  than  5%  difference  between  the 
treatment groups (25.1% zoledronic acid vs. 18.3% placebo).  
The  most  frequently  occurring  AEs  (≥  2.0%  for  any  group)  included  pyrexia,  bone  pain, 
musculoskeletal pain, and hyperthermia, which occurred with a more than twofold higher incidence in 
the  zoledronic  acid  group  vs.  the  placebo  group.  Osteoporosis,  dizziness  and  chronic  obstructive 
pulmonary  disease  each  occurred  with  a  twofold  higher  incidence  in  the  placebo  group  vs.  the 
zoledronic acid group.  
Overall, within the first 3 days of any study drug infusion, 26.7% of zoledronic acid-treated patients 
experienced at least one AE compared with 19.1% in the placebo group. The difference between the 
treatment  groups  is  accounted  for  by  the  approximate  fourfold  greater  incidence  in  the  general 
disorders and administration site conditions system organ class: 12.14% of patients in the zoledronic 
acid group compared with 3.12% in the placebo group.

Within 3 days of the first study drug infusion, the incidence of AEs was 19.45% for zoledronic acid 
vs. 10.06% for placebo. After the second drug infusion, the incidence of AEs within 3 days decreased 
to  more  comparable  rates  between  the  treatment  groups  (10.42%  for  zoledronic  acid  and  9.96%  for 
placebo).  After  the  third  study  drug  infusion,  the  incidence  of  AEs  within  3  days  was  10.77%  for 
zoledronic acid and 9.01% for placebo. 
The  rates  of  cardiac  failure,  chest  pain  and  atrial  fibrillation  were  similar  in  both  groups,  although 
slightly higher in the zoledronic acid group. The rate of cerebrovascular accident was slightly higher in 
the  placebo  group.  Rate of  decreased creatinine  clearance  was  slightly  higher in  the  zoledronic  acid 
group while renal failure was slightly higher in the placebo group. 
The  majority  of  patients  who  experienced  AEs  had  events  that  were  mild  (17.36%  vs.  16.27%)  or 
moderate  (34.63%  vs.  30.94%)  in  severity  for  zoledronic  acid  versus  placebo,  respectively.  The 
overall reporting frequency for patients with severe AEs was 30.27% for the zoledronic acid group and 
33.40% for the placebo group. The PSOCs with a more than 1% difference in the incidence of severe 
AEs in the zoledronic acid group versus the placebo group were cardiac disorders (5.88% vs. 8.51%, 
respectively) and nervous system disorders (3.80% vs. 5.20%, respectively). 
The difference within the severe cardiac disorders PSOC appears to be driven by lower incidences of 
severe  congestive  heart  failure  and  myocardial  infarction  in  the  zoledronic  acid  vs.  placebo  group 
(8 patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  vs.  13  patients  in  the  placebo  group  for  both  terms).  The 
difference  within  the  nervous  system  disorders  may  have  been  driven  by  the  greater  number  of 
patients  reporting  cerebrovascular  disorders  in  the  placebo  group  (0  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid 
group vs. 4 patients in the placebo group). 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
The overall mortality rate was lower in the zoledronic acid group (101 patients, 9.58%) compared with 
the  placebo  group  (141  patients,  13.34%).  Causes  of  death  for  the  most  common  PSOC  involved, 
cardiac disorders, occurred with at least a two times higher incidence than for any other PSOC, and the 
incidence was lower for the zoledronic acid group (36 patients, or 3.42%) compared with the placebo 
group (52 patients, or 4.92%). 
The most common principal causes of death (≥ 0.5%) included cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, 
cardio-respiratory  arrest,  sepsis,  pneumonia,  cerebrovascular  accident,  and  respiratory  failure.  Of 
these, a twofold or greater difference for zoledronic acid vs. placebo was seen for sepsis (8 [0.76%] 
patients  vs.  4 [0.38%]  patients)  and  cerebrovascular  accident  (6  [0.57%]  patients  vs.  3  [0.28  %] 
patients),  and  a  twofold  or  greater  difference  for  placebo  vs.  zoledronic  acid  was  seen  for  cardio-
respiratory arrest (5 [0.47%] patients vs. 11 [1.04%] patients), and pneumonia (4 [0.38%] patients vs. 
8 [0.76%] patients). 
Analysis confirmed a significant 28% decreased risk of death (Hazard ratio 0.72, 95% CI: 
0.56 to 0.93, p=0.0117) with zoledronic acid compared to placebo. The cumulative death rate for both 
treatment groups over time is shown in Figure 12-1. There is a separation of the two treatment groups 
beginning at approximately Month 16, which is approximately 12 months after the earliest separation 
of the two treatments groups in time to first clinical fracture (approximately Month 4) and paralleled 
each other. 
It should be noted that after Month 36 (Day 1080), the changes in the Kaplan-Meier curves become 
oversensitive  to  the  occurrence  of  death  due  to  the  small  number  of  patients  who  were  still  being 
followed up in the study after that time point (149 on placebo and 144 on zoledronic acid). As such, 
every death that occurs has considerable influence on the cumulative incidence of deaths as well as the 
shape of the Kaplan-Meier curves.

Zoledronic-acid treated patients who received their first study drug infusion more than 6 weeks after 
hip fracture surgery had a 46% reduction in death compared to the placebo-treated patients, shown by 
an estimated hazard ratio of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.36 to 0.81, p=0.0022). Zoledronic acid-treated patients 
who received their first study drug infusion within 6 weeks following hip fracture surgery had a lower 
reduction in the risk of death, as shown by an estimated hazard ratio of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.26, 
p=0.5472). 
SAEs were reported most frequently in the following PSOCs (data are presented for zoledronic acid 
vs.  placebo,  respectively):  ‘injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications’  (10.8%  vs.  13.2%), 
‘infections and infestations’ (9.3% vs. 9.3%), ‘cardiac disorders’ (9.1% vs. 10.0%); ‘nervous system 
disorders’ (6.9% vs. 6.7%), and ‘musculoskeletal disorders’ (6.4% vs. 5.7%). 
For the most frequently reported SAEs (≥ 1.0%) tthe overall frequency of SAEs was comparable for 
the  zoledronic  acid  (38.33%)  and  placebo  (41.25%)  treatment  groups.  For  the  five  most  frequently 
reported  SAEs  (pneumonia,  post-procedural  complication,  arthralgia,  cerebrovascular  accident,  and 
congestive cardiac failure) in the zoledronic acid group, there were no major differences compared to 
the placebo group. The overall incidence of stroke related SAE was slightly higher in the zoledronic 
acid group when compared to placebo (4.4% vs. 3.6%, respectively). 
SAEs  suspected  to  be  related  to  study  drug  occurred  for  8  (0.76%)  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid 
group and 9 (0.85%) patients in the placebo group. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
The most common AEs leading to premature discontinuation from study drug (≥ 0.25%) are presented 
in Table 12-10. Patients who discontinued from study drug were encouraged to remain in the study for 
safety and efficacy follow-up evaluations. The percentage of patients discontinuing treatment due to 
AEs was comparable between treatment groups (5.31% vs. 4.73%).

Laboratory findings 
The  number  of  patients  with  selected  laboratory  tests  meeting  the  ‘clinical  notable’  criteria  were 
summarised by treatment. For a patient to meet the criteria for a clinically notable change, the patient’s 
baseline  value  for  that  parameter  must  not  have  been  clinically  notable.  Guidelines  for  clinically 
notable  criteria  for  laboratory  tests  are  based  on the Division  of  Neuropharmacology  Guidelines  for 
‘Markedly Abnormal’ clinical laboratory values for adults in SI units. 
No post-baseline haematology and urinalysis measurements were planned in the study. 
With  the  exception  of  high  calcium,  there  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  between  the 
treatment groups for any of the parameters, which had patients meeting the criteria[A30]. 
Ocular Adverse Events 
In  Study  2310,  most  cases  of  ocular  Adverse  Events  were  conjunctivitis  (infectious,  irritant,  and 
allergic),  blepharitis,  and  eye  pain.  No  cases  of  uveitis  or  iridiocyclitis  were  reported  in  either 
treatment group. The overall incidence of confirmed ocular AEs was low in the zoledronic acid and 
placebo  groups  (21  [2.0%]  vs.  16  [1.5%],  respectively).  Of  these,  4  (0.4%)  zoledronic  acid-treated 
patients  and  1  (0.1%)  placebo-treated  patient  had  ocular  events  that  were  considered  possibly  or 
probably related to study drug by blinded expert review. Of the ocular conditions known to be related 
to bisphosphonate use, only one case of moderate iritis, in a zoledronic acid treated patient, was found 
to be clinically significant and possibly related to study drug by adjudication. 
Within 3 days of study drug infusion, the only confirmed event observed in Study 2310 was eye pain 
in one zoledronic acid patient.  
In  study  2301,  ocular  events  suspected  to  be  related  to  zoledronic  acid  was  seen  in  0.7  %  of  the 
zoledronic  acid  treatments.  Most  of  these  events  were  conjunctivitis  and  the  majority  of  the  events 
occurred within 2 weeks after infusion of zoledronic acid and were transient. 
Hypocalcaemia 
In  Study  2310,  9  (0.9%)  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  3  (0.3%)  patients  in  the  placebo 
group  experienced  hypocalcaemia  adverse  laboratory  events.  Of  these,  3  (0.3%)  patients  in  the 
zoledronic acid group and no patient in the placebo group had confirmed events of hypocalcaemia. 
For  one  of  these  three  zoledronic  acid-treated  patients  with  confirmed  hypocalcaemia,  the  event 
occurred on the day following the first day of treatment and resolved within 5 days. This event was 
mild,  and  was  thought  to  be  related  to  study  medication.  For  the  other  two  zoledronic  acid-treated 
patients,  the  events  occurred  more  than  50  days  after  an  infusion,  and  were  considered  not  to  be 
related to study medication. 
Only  one  of  the  three  patients  had  symptomatic  hypocalcaemia.  This  patient,  who  became  acutely 
hypocalcaemic  one  day  after  a  radical  thyroidectomy  (due  to  thyroid  malignancy),  was  successfully 
treated with intravenous calcium. The event occurred 360 days after her first dose of study medication, 
and was suspected to be related to the thyroidectomy. 
The rate of hypocalcaemia was lower than in study 2301 which is not surprising as hypocalcaemia was 
an exclusion criterion in study 2310.  Symptomless hypocalcaemia was seen in 2.3 % of patients after 
first study drug infusion in the zoledronic acid group in study 2301, compared to an incidence of 0.3 % 
after the second and 0.1 % after the third infusion. 
Avascular necrosis and delayed union/non-union 
In Study 2310, a total of 23 (2.2%) patients in the zoledronic acid group and 26 (2.5%) patients in the 
placebo group had AVN events. All but three patients in each treatment group had AVN involving the 
hip. Six (0.6%) patients in the zoledronic acid group and 3 (0.3%) patients in the placebo group had 
adjudicated confirmed events of AVN all of which involved the hip.

The  percentage  of  patients  with  delayed  healing  of  the  study  entry  hip  fracture  confirmed  by 
adjudication was comparable for the two treatment groups (34 [3.2%] in the zoledronic acid group vs. 
29 [2.7%] in the placebo group). 
From the search of the clinical trial database, a total of 9 (0.9%) patients in the zoledronic acid group 
and  8  (0.8%)  of  placebo  patients  experienced  delayed  union/nonunion.  Of  the  9  cases  of  delayed 
union/non-union in the zoledronic acid group, 7 were incident hip, 1 was contralateral hip, and 1 was 
in the humerus. Of the 8 cases in the placebo group, 3 were wrist, 2 were shoulder, 2 were incident 
hip,  and  1  was  contralateral  hip.  The  cases  that  were  adjudicated  as  confirmed  events  of  delayed 
union/nonunion were: 3 (0.3%) patients in the zoledronic acid group (2 incident hip and 1 humerus) 
and 3 (0.3%) patients in the placebo group (1 incident hip, 1 contralateral hip, and 1 shoulder). 
Combining the information obtained from both methods, a total of 36 (3.4%) patients in the 
zoledronic acid group and 30 (2.8%) patients in the placebo group had adjudicated confirmed delayed 
hip fracture healing or delayed union/nonunion of the incident hip. 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) 
In Study 2310, the search of the safety database revealed maxillofacial events in a total of 6 (0.6%) 
patients in the zoledronic acid group and 11 (1.0%) patients in the placebo group. One patient in the 
placebo group had an event adjudicated as indeterminate, while the remaining events were adjudicated 
as not clinically relevant cases of ONJ. 
Renal events 
In Study 2310, long-term renal safety was evaluated by  monitoring changes in serum creatinine and 
calculated  Creatinine  Clearance  (CrCl)  annually  within  4  weeks  prior  to  each  scheduled  study  drug 
infusion in addition to evaluating reported AEs that met the pre-specified criteria for change in renal 
function. The following laboratory criteria were developed to monitor for significant declines in renal 
function: 
• increase in serum creatinine > than 0.5 mg/dl relative to baseline, 
• treatment-emergent calculated CrCl < 30 ml/min, or 
• decrease in CrCl ≥ 30% and CrCl ≤ 60 ml/min at baseline. 
Measurements  of  serum  creatinine  and  calculation  of  GFR  were  made  at  baseline  and  then  once 
yearly, before each study drug infusion. 
The overall incidence rates for each of the three categories of renal abnormalities at any time during 
the study were comparable for the two treatment groups. There was no evidence of an increased risk 
for renal impairment with zoledronic acid treatment even in those patients with mild-to-moderate renal 
impairment (baseline CrCl of ≥ 35 ml/min). 
Adverse events associated with a change in renal function were similar in both groups with 
60  patients  (5.69%)  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  compared  to  61  patients  (5.77%)  in  the  placebo 
group.  Events  reported in  more  than  1.0%  of  the  patients  in  either  treatment  group  were:  decreased 
creatinine  renal  clearance  (22  [2.09%]  zoledronic  acid  vs.  18  [1.70%]  placebo),  renal  failure  (17 
[1.61%] zoledronic acid vs. 24 [2.27%] placebo), and acute renal failure (12 [1.14%] zoledronic acid 
vs. 15 [1.42%] placebo). 
A total of 160 (15.18%) patients in the zoledronic acid group and 146 (13.81%) patients in the placebo 
group had renal events (renal function AEs and/or pre-determined laboratory abnormalities) that were 
sent  to  the  adjudication  committee  for  review.  Of  these,  87  (8.25%)  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid 
group and 90 (8.51%) patients in the placebo group had confirmed clinically significant renal events. 
Cardiac arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation 
Overall, in Study 2310, cardiac arrhythmia AEs were reported in fewer zoledronic acid treated patients 
(72 [6.8%])  than  placebo-treated  patients  (85  [8.0%]).  With  the  exception  of  a  higher  incidence  of 
tachycardia  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  (7  [0.7%]  than  the  placebo  group  (3  [0.3%])  and  a 
comparable  incidence  of  atrial  fibrillation  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  (29  [2.8%]  and  the  placebo 
group  (27  [2.6%]),  all  common  arrhythmias  occurred  at  a  lower  rate  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group 
compared to the placebo group. 
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR

A  total  of  24  (2.28%)  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  39  (3.69%)  patients  in  the  placebo 
group  had  arrhythmia  SAEs.  Of  these,  19  (1.80%)  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  28 
(2.65%) patients in the placebo group had adjudicated confirmed arrhythmia SAEs. The most common 
arrhythmia SAE confirmed via adjudication was atrial fibrillation. The incidence of atrial fibrillation 
SAEs  was  lower  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  compared  to  placebo  (11  [1.0%]  vs.  13  [1.2%], 
respectively). Within 30 days following study drug infusion, all three patients with arrhythmia SAEs 
in  Study  2310  were  in the  placebo  group (and  none occurred in the  zoledronic acid  group).  In  both 
studies,  more  than  90%  of  the  arrhythmia  SAEs, including  atrial  fibrillation,  occurred  more than  30 
days after infusion. 
Safety in men with osteoporosis 
Safety data from study 2308 were pooled with safety data from the male subpopulation in study 2310 
to provide an integrated safety profile. Despite the differences in study design and population in the 
two  studies,  the  combination  of  the  data  from  both  studies  increased  the  number  of  patients  in  the 
zoledronic  acid  treatment  group  in  the  analysis,  and  therefore  maximised  the  chance  of  identifying 
potential  safety  signals  specific  to  the  male  osteoporosis  population.  The  information  from  the 
individual studies was presented by the MAH along with the pooled results for zoledronic acid from 
the two studies. 
The overall extent of drug exposure from all studies in male osteoporosis is shown in Table 4.15. A 
total of 397 male patients received 5 mg zoledronic acid/100 ml once-yearly as an i.v. infusion over 
15 minutes.

Exposure years for each patient are defined as the number of days of follow-up divided by 365.25. 
Demographic characteristics were similar between treatment groups of the individual studies. Patients 
in Study 2310 were approximately 8-9 years older than patients in Study 2308; approximately 49% of 
male  patients  in  Study  2310  were  ≥  75  years  of  age,  while  only  approximately  16%  of  patients  in 
Study 2308 were ≥ 75 years of age. The mean and median weights and body mass index (BMI) were 
slightly lower in Study 2310 relative to Study 2308 
The  treatment  groups  within  each  individual  study  were  well  matched  and  similar  with  respect  to 
creatinine clearance and serum calcium. Overall, the majority of patients in both studies had normal 
baseline  renal  function,  as  defined  by  a  baseline  creatinine  clearance  ≥ 60  ml/min.  For  those  with 
baseline renal impairment, patients in study 2310 tended to have more pronounced renal impairment 
(lower creatinine clearances) which is attributed to its generally older patient population. 
The  three  most  commonly  used  concomitant  medications  during  the  studies  other  than  calcium  or 
vitamin  D  supplementation  were  over-the-counter  medications  which  included  paracetamol,

acetylsalicylic acid, and ibuprofen. Of note, unless contraindicated, patients in study 2310 were given 
the standard labelled dose of oral paracetamol at each infusion of study medication, and instructed to 
use  it  for  up  to  72  hours  afterwards  as  needed.    In  study  2308,  at  the  discretion  of  the investigator, 
acetaminophen in usual labelled doses was allowed for the management of post-dose symptoms. 
Adverse Events 
The percentage of patients experiencing at least one AE was highest in patients receiving alendronate 
(93.2%) and lowest in the placebo group (80.5%) relative to zoledronic acid (86.9%). However, in the 
individual studies, the percentage of patients experiencing at least one AE was comparable between 
treatment groups. In study 2308, the percentage of patients experiencing at least one AE was 93.5% in 
the zoledronic acid group, and 93.2% in the alendronate group. 
In  the  male  population  of  study  2310,  the  percentage  of  patients  experiencing  at  least  one  AE  was 
82.8% in the zoledronic acid group, and 80.5% in the placebo group. The incidence of AEs in Study 
2310  was  lower  than  that  observed  in  Study  2308,  presumably  due  to  the  recommended  use  of 
acetaminophen (paracetamol) to prevent the occurrence of post-dose symptoms in Study 2310. 
The  most  frequently  affected  PSOCs  were  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders,  general 
disorders and administration site conditions, infections and infestations, gastrointestinal disorders, and 
nervous  system  disorders.  Among  these  frequently  affected  PSOCs,  general  disorders  and 
administration  site  conditions  was  the  only  PSOC  with  a  10%  or  greater  incidence  in  the  total 
zoledronic acid group than either other treatment group (37.3% zoledronic acid vs. 27.0% alendronate 
vs. 19.9% placebo).  
This  difference  was  mainly  driven  by  a  higher  occurrence  of  pyrexia  fatigue,  and  pain,  often 
associated with post-dose symptoms observed with i.v. and high dose oral bisphosphonates.  In Study 
2308, there was a 10% or greater incidence of nervous system disorders in the zoledronic acid group 
(37.3%) relative to the alendronate group (19.6%), which was mainly driven by a higher incidence of 
headache in the zoledronic acid group (15.0%) relative to the alendronate group (6.1%). 
Events suspected to be drug related 
Such  AEs  occurred  in  34.5  %  of  zoledronic  acid-  and  in  26.4  %  of  placebo-treated  patients.  The 
incidence of AEs was highest following the first infusion (zoledronic acid 79.6 %, alendronate 83.8 %, 
placebo 69.7 %). Between the second and third infusion, the incidence of AEs decreased (zoledronic 
acid  63.7%;  alendronate,  72.0%;  placebo,  60.3%).  Following  the  third  infusion,  the  incidence 
decreased further to 54.4% for zoledronic acid and 50.0% for placebo. Within 3 days of any infusion, 
the incidence of pyrexia (11.3 %) and myalgia (8.3 %) in zoledronic acid-treated patients were more 
than 3 times those of alendronate- or placebo-treated patients.  
Mitigation of post-dose symptoms[A31] 
In order to mitigate the incidence of post-dose symptoms in studies 2310, H2313 and H2315, patients 
were provided with oral paracetamol at the time of i.v. administration of study medication, and were 
instructed to use as needed for the next 72 hours. The incidence of AEs which started within 3 days of 
the first study drug infusion in all three studies was less than 2-fold higher in the zoledronic acid group 
than in the comparator group: 19.5% vs. 10.6% in study 2310; 36.3 % vs. 21.4% in study H2313; and 
63.8%  vs.  37.3% in study H2315.  In  study  H2407,  patients  were  provided  with  oral  paracetamol  or 
ibuprofen at the time of i.v. administration of study medication, and were instructed to use as needed 
for  the  next  72  hours.  The  incidence  of  AEs  was  more  than  2-fold  higher  in  patients  treated  with 
zoledronic  acid  but  without  analgesics  (60.7%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (25.0%);  however,  the 
incidence  was  lower  in  patients  treated  with  zoledronic  acid  and  paracetamol  (46.6%)  or  ibuprofen 
(44.1%). 
Deaths 
The  male  populations  in  study  2308  and  study  2310  differed  in  terms  of  mortality  and 
cardiovascular/cerebrovascular event risk. The Study 2310 population was at a higher risk of mortality 
due  to  their  older  age  and  a  recent  hip  fracture  at  randomisation,  as  compared  to  the  Study  2308 
population, which included patients with osteoporosis, but did not require a recent hip fracture. 
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR

A greater proportion of the patients in Study 2310 ≥ 75 years of age which, when combined with the 
higher baseline rates of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and previous stroke, implies 
that  the  Study  2310  population  was  at  a  higher  risk  for  subsequent  cardiovascular/cerebrovascular 
events than the Study 2308 population.  
A total of 84 patients died, primarily in study 2310. In study 2308, only one patient in each treatment 
group died (zoledronic acid group, respiratory failure; alendronate group, pulmonary embolism).  
In Study 2310, the percentage of patients in the zoledronic acid group who died was less than that in 
the  placebo  group  (zoledronic  acid  group,  13.1%;  placebo  group,  19.5%).  The  causes  of  death  per 
investigator that occurred in more than one patient in the zoledronic acid group included respiratory 
failure, pneumonia, sepsis, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, and cerebrovascular accident. 
The  overall  death  rate  adjusted  for  exposure  was  lower  in  Study  2308  (both  zoledronic  acid  and 
alendronate groups, death rate per patient year < 0.01 per patient year) than in Study 2310 (death rate 
per  patient  year,  0.07  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  vs.  0.10  in  the  placebo  group).  This  would  be 
expected due to the greater mortality risk given their recent hip fracture, greater prevalence of multiple 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk factors, and the greater age of the patient population in Study 
2310. 
Adjudicated cause of death 
The  majority  of  the  causes  of  death  were  adjudicated  as  ‘other’  or  ‘unknown’. The total  number  of 
deaths  to  be  due  to  a  cardiac  condition  was  ten,  two  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  eight  in  the 
placebo  group  (Table  4-25).  Two  deaths,  one  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  one  in  the  placebo 
group, were adjudicated as being cerebrovascular.

Renal AEs 
The following criteria were used to search the clinical database in order to identify cases: 
• Laboratory findings of a) an increase in serum creatinine of > 0.5 mg/dl, b) a calculated CrCl < 30 
ml/min or c) a CrCl ≤ 60 ml/min at baseline and a post-baseline decrease in CrCl ≥ 30 % or significant 
proteinuria as urine dipstick > 2+ 
• Occurrence of AEs associated with a change in renal function  
For the pooled male osteoporosis populations, laboratory renal criteria of increase in serum creatinine 
> 0.5 mg/dl were reported for 23 (6.4%)zoledronic acid, 1 (0.7%) alendronate and 16 (7.4%) placebo 
patients, CrCl < 30 ml/min for 9 (2.6%) zoledronic acid, 1 (0.7%) alendronate and 11 (5.1%) placebo 
patients, and baseline CrCl ≤ 60 ml/min and declined ≥ 30% for 10 (15.6%) zoledronic acid, 1 (5.9%) 
alendronate, and 12 (17.9%) placebo patients, and were sent to the adjudication committee for review.

While the incidence of patients who met one of the laboratory criteria was higher for the zoledronic 
acid group compared to alendronate (due to the transient increases in 9-11 day labs in study 2308 in 
the zoledronic acid group), it was comparable to placebo. Of note, Study 2310 did not include 9-11 
day labs so no transient rises in serum creatinine were observed. Clinically significant renal laboratory 
events  confirmed  by  the  adjudication  committee  are  presented  in  table  4.  27.    In  study  2308,  the 
proportion of patients who demonstrated an increase in serum creatinine from baseline > 0.5mg/dl was 
higher  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  (7  patients,  or  4.6%)  compared  with  the  alendronate  group  (1 
patient, or 0.7%) (study 2308). This was driven by a higher number of patients in the zoledronic acid 
group  with  transient  creatinine  elevations  9-11  day  post-infusion,  which  subsequently  decreased  to 
baseline  or  near  baseline  levels.  For  each  of  these  patients,  the  increase  in  serum  creatinine  was 
adjudicated as possibly or probably related to study drug (table 4. 27). The overall incidences for the 
other laboratory categories at any time during the study were low and comparable for both treatment 
groups in study 2308: CrCl <30 ml/min for 1 (0.7%) of patients in both treatment groups, and decrease 
in  CrCl  ≥  30%  and  ≤60  ml/min  at  baseline  for  1  (5.6%)  zoledronic  acid  and  1  (5.9%)  alendronate 
patient (study 2308).

AEs  associated  with  a  change  in  renal  function  based  on  the  pre-specified  MedDRA  search  criteria 
were summarised by the MAH for the safety population of MO. The incidence was 19 (4.8%) in the 
zoledronic  acid  group,  6  (4.1%)  in  the  alendronate  group,  and  16  (6.1%)  in  the  placebo  group.  The 
incidence  of  AEs  associated  with  a  change  in  renal  function  and  confirmed  by  adjudication  was  10 
(2.5%) in the zoledronic acid group, 2 (1.4%) in the alendronate group, and 12 (4.6%) in the placebo 
group.  AEs  (based  on  the  pre-specified  MedDRA  search  criteria)  associated  with  a  change  in  renal 
function confirmed by adjudication were examined by infusion. There was no evidence of increased 
incidence of events with greater cumulative exposure to zoledronic acid with 6 (1.5%) patients in the 
zoledronic acid group compared to 8 (3.1%) patients in the placebo group having events between the 
1st and 2nd dose and 4 (1.3%) patients in the zoledronic acid group and 4 (2.1%) patients in the placebo 
group having events after the 2nd dose. 
A total of 42 (10.6%) patients in the zoledronic acid group, 6 (4.1%) patients in the alendronate group, 
and 31 (11.9%) patients in the placebo group had renal events (pre-specified MedDRA search criteria 
AEs and/or pre-specified laboratory criteria) that were sent to the adjudication committee for review.  
Of  these,  a  higher  number  of  patients  (27,  6.8%)  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  relative  to  the 
alendronate  (2,  1.4%)  group  had  clinically  significant  renal  events  confirmed  by  the  expert 
adjudication committee; the incidence was highest in the placebo group (23, 8.8%). 
The  incidence  of  change  in  renal  function  confirmed  by  the  adjudication  committee  was  higher  for 
those  patients  with  risk  factors,  although  the  number  of  events  was  too  small  to  draw  meaningful 
conclusions.

Cardiac/cardiovascular and stroke-related AEs 
All (serious and non-serious) cardiac arrhythmia AEs are summarised for the male osteoporosis safety 
population  in  table 4.28.  There  were  9  (5.9%)  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  7  (4.7%) 
patients in the alendronate group who had an AE associated with cardiac arrhythmia in Study 2308. 
Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter were reported for 5 (3.3%) patients in the zoledronic acid group and 3 
(2.0%) patients in the alendronate group. The only atrial fibrillation SAE occurred in the alendronate 
group. 
A  greater  proportion  of  the  patients  in  Study  2310  were  more  than  75  years  of  age  which,  when 
combined  with  the  higher  baseline  rates  of  hypertension,  diabetes,  coronary  artery  disease,  and 
previous  stroke,  implies  that  the  Study  2310  population  was  at  a  higher  risk  for  subsequent 
cardiovascular/cerebrovascular  events  than  the  Study  2308  population  (see  table  4.  21).  This  was 
evident  in  the  placebo  group,  which  experienced  a  higher  rate  of  cardiac  arrhythmias  (27  patients, 
[10.3%]) than either treatment group in Study 2308 and was also higher than the corresponding study 
2310 zoledronic acid treated group (13 patients [5.3%]). Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (both serious 
and non-serious) were reported at similar rates for both placebo and zoledronic acid groups (7 [2.9%] 
zoledronic groups and 6 [2.3%] placebo) in Study 2310 (see table 4-28).

Between-treatment  differences  for  time  to  first  cardiac  arrhythmia  AE/SAE  and  time  to  first  atrial

between the pooled zoledronic acid group and the placebo treatment group.  
Baseline risk factors for cardiac arrhythmia AEs 
The  number  and  percentage  of  patients  who  experienced  cardiac  arrhythmia  AEs  (serious  and  non-
serious)  in  the  Male  osteoporosis  safety  population  were  summarised  by  baseline  risk  factors:  age 
group,  active  hypertension,  active  diabetes  mellitus,  active  congestive/cardiac  heart  failure,  active 
valvular  heart  disease,  active  coronary  artery  disease,  history  of  myocardial  infarction,  active 
cardiomyopathy, active left ventricular hypertrophy, active tachyarrhythmia, active bradyarrhythmia, 
active  atrial  fibrillation/flutter,  active  hypercholesterolemia,  prior  history  of  stroke  and  active 
hyperthyroidism.  The  number  of  patients  in  each  specific  risk  category  and  the  number  of  events 
observed were considered too small to make clinical conclusions. 
Adjudication of arrhythmia SAEs 
Arrhythmia  SAEs  confirmed  by  adjudication  for  the  male  osteoporosis  safety  population  were 
summarised by the MAH. Of those sent for adjudication, a total of 16 patients (6 patients (1.5%) in the 
zoledronic acid group, 2 patients (1.4%) in the alendronate group, and 8 patients (3.1%) in the placebo 
group)  were  confirmed  by  the  adjudication  committee.  Atrial  fibrillation  was  confirmed  by 
adjudication in  5  patients  (3  patients,  zoledronic acid  group;  1  patient,  alendronate  group; 1  patient, 
placebo group). A between-treatment comparison of time to first arrhythmia SAE confirmed showed 
that  zoledronic  acid  reduced  the  risk  of  arrhythmia  SAEs  confirmed  by  adjudication  compared  to 
placebo by 15% (p-value=0.7713, Hazard ratio = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.30, 2.47). Within 30 days following 
study  drug  infusion,  no  patients  experienced  an  arrhythmia  SAE  confirmed  by  adjudication;  all 
confirmed  arrhythmia  SAEs  occurred  more  than  30  days  from  dosing.  This  supports  the  lack  of  a 
causal  relationship  between  zoledronic  acid  and  arrhythmia  SAEs.  A  summary  of  arrhythmia  SAEs 
confirmed via adjudication is presented by underlying medical condition was presented by the MAH. 
The most common underlying condition was pre-existing arrhythmia. Both patients in the alendronate 
group had a previous myocardial infarction. 
Congestive/cardiac heart failure   
The  incidence  of  all  congestive/cardiac  heart  failure  AEs  reported  by  investigators  was  10  (2.5%) 
zoledronic acid-treated patients, 2 (1.4%) alendronate-treated patients, and 18 (6.9%) placebo-treated 
patients).  A  between-treatment  comparison  of  time  to  first  congestive/cardiac  heart  failure  AE  is 
presented  showed  that  zoledronic  acid  reduced  the  risk  of  congestive/cardiac  failure  adverse  events 
compared  to  placebo  by  45%;  however  the  result  was  not  statistically  significant  (p-value=0.1320, 
Hazard ratio = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.24, 1.22).  
Stroke-related AEs 
The  incidence  of  all  stroke-related  AEs  (serious  and  non-serious)  for  the  male  osteoporosis  safety 
population  reported  by  investigators  was  17  (4.3%)  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group,  2  (1.4%)  in  the 
alendronate  group,  and  17  (  6.5%)  in  the  placebo  group.  The  majority  of  stroke-related  AEs  were 
cerebrovascular accidents (CVA): 8 (2.0%) in the zoledronic acid group, 1 (0.7%) in the alendronate 
group, and 8 (3.1%) in the placebo group. Zoledronic acid reduced the risk of stroke-related AEs by 
9%; however the result was not statistically significant (p-value=0.7982, Hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% CI: 
(0.45, 1.85).  
Stroke-related SAEs 
The  incidence  of  all  stroke-related  SAEs  reported  by  investigators  was  12  (3.0%)  in  the  zoledronic 
acid  group,  2 (1.4%)  in  the  alendronate  group  and  10  (3.8%)  in  the  placebo  group. The  majority  of 
stroke-related SAEs were cerebrovascular accidents (CVA): 6 (1.5%) in the zoledronic acid group, 1 
(0.7%) in the alendronate group and 5 (1.9%) in the placebo group. A between-treatment comparison 
of  time  to  first  stroke-related  SAE  showed  that  zoledronic  acid  increased  the  risk  of  stroke-related 
SAEs  by  10%;  however  the  result  was  not  statistically  significant  (p-value=0.8372,  Hazard  ratio  = 
1.10, 95% CI: 0.46, 2.64). 
Ocular events 
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
42
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rare reports of ocular inflammation, such as nonspecific conjunctivitis, uveitis and episcleritis, have 
been  described  in  association  with  administration  of  all  marketed  bisphosphonates,  such  as 
alendronate,  pamidronate,  risedronate  and  zoledronic  acid.  To  objectively  and  independently  assess 
ocular AEs and to identify possible causal relationships, an AE review process was established. Data 
were  reviewed  by  an  independent  and  blinded  ophthalmology  expert  in  assessing  bisphosphonate-
associated  ocular  AEs.  A  list  of  preferred  terms  was created by  the  expert and the  clinical  database 
was  searched  to  identify  potential  cases.  Follow-up  forms  were  sent  to  investigators  to  collect 
additional details, and then the event was adjudicated. All ocular events sent for expert review in the 
Male osteoporosis safety population were adjudicated as confirmed ocular events: zoledronic acid, 11 
patients (2.8%); alendronate, 3 patients (2.0%), and placebo, 4 patients, (1.5%). 
Hypocalcaemia 
Hypocalcaemia is a known potential consequence of bisphosphonate therapy, and because zoledronic 
acid has a rapid effect on bone turnover, transient hypocalcaemia may develop soon after dosing and 
usually  following  the  first  infusion  of    zoledronic  acid.  Three  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group 
(0.7%),  1  patient  in  the  alendronate  group  (0.7%),  and  1  patient  in  the  placebo  group  (0.4%)  had 
clinical events that met the pre-specified criteria for hypocalcaemia and were sent to the adjudication 
committee for review. Only one patient in the zoledronic acid group (0.25%) and one patient in the 
alendronate group (0.68%) were adjudicated to have experienced confirmed events of hypocalcaemia; 
no symptoms were reported. 
Avascular necrosis (AVN) of long bones and delayed union/nonunion following a fracture 
Three  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  (0.8%),  no  patients  in  the  alendronate  group  and  10 
patients  in  the  placebo  group  (3.8%)  had  cases  of  potential  AVN  events  that  were  sent  to  the 
adjudication  committee  for  review.  Only  2  cases,  both  in  the  placebo  group,  were  adjudicated  as 
confirmed.  To  assess  delayed  healing/non-union  of  a  fracture,  the  same  adjudication  committee 
reviewed cases identified by searching the safety database for preferred MedDRA terms agreed to by 
the committee. Overall, there were 2 (0.5%) male patients in the zoledronic acid group and 3 (1.15%) 
in the placebo group who had a potential delayed healing/non-union of a fracture identified. Of these, 
1 (0.25%) zoledronic acid patient and 2 (0.77%) placebo patients had confirmed delayed healing/non-
union of their fracture. No patient in Study 2308 had an event which met the adjudication criteria for 
non-healing/delayed  union  of  a  fracture.  Additionally,  in  study  2310,  a  parallel  process  was 
implemented  to  identify  potential  cases  of  delayed  healing  of  the  fractured  hip  which  defined  entry 
into  the  study.  This  process  identified  36  patients  (14.8%  of  Study  2310  male  patients)  in  the 
zoledronic  acid  group  and  31  (11.9%)  male  patients  in  the  placebo  group  for  adjudication,  which 
confirmed 11 (4.5%) of Study 2310 male patients) in the zoledronic acid group and 9 (3.45%) in the 
placebo group. Overall, there was no evidence of an increased risk of delayed healing or non-union of 
a fracture regardless of anatomic site. 
Maxillofacial complications 
ONJ  was  confirmed  if  there  was  ‘exposed  bone  of  the  jaw  despite  6  weeks  of  appropriate  medical 
care.’  This  definition  is  consistent  with  the  original  descriptions  by  (Ruggiero  et  al  2004)  and  is 
described further based on the published results from the PMO population (Grbic et al 2008). There 
were no spontaneous reports of ONJ. Five patients in the zoledronic acid group (1.3%), 5 patients in 
the  alendronate  group  (3.4%),  and  1  patient  in  the  placebo  group  (0.4%)  had  maxillofacial  events. 
There were no patients who experienced events that were confirmed by adjudication. 
Clinical chemistry 
Analyses  of  selected  biochemistry  parameters  of  creatinine,  BUN,  phosphorous,  albumin,  calcium, 
corrected calcium and magnesium was performed for the pooled Male osteoporosis safety population. 
Data interpretation is difficult due to the differences in patient populations of the two studies pooled. 
The overall incidence for increases in serum creatinine from baseline (> 0.5 mg/dl) was higher in the 
zoledronic  acid  group  (7  patients,  or  4.6%)  compared  with  the  alendronate  group  (one  patient,  or 
0.7%)  in  study  2308.  In  general,  for  other  selected  biochemistry  parameters,  no  clinically  relevant 
differences between treatment groups were observed, when examined overall and from the perspective 
of the individual studies.

Post marketing experience 
According to the latest PSUR for Aclasta, covering the period from 01 November 2006 to 30 April 
2007,  approximately  2625  patients  received  treatment  with  Aclasta  in  investigational  clinical  trials 
sponsored by the MAH. In the previous PSUR, approximately 1185 patients received treatment with 
Aclasta.  Approximately  107  patients  received  Aclasta  in  Post-Marketing-Surveillance  studies.  An 
estimate of patient-years of exposure is based on calculations of worldwide sales volume in grams of 
active substance sold during the review period divided by the defined dose (DD). The sales volume of 
Aclasta  during  the  review  period  is  14.7  g;  divided  by  the  defined  DD  of  5 mg.  The  estimated 
exposure is 6226 patient-years. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
The presentation of safety results was presented side-by-side with safety results from the large study 
2301 in  postmenopausal  osteoporosis,  which  has recently  been assessed. The  safety  data  from  these 
two studies in a similar study population were pooled.  
The  CHMP  noted  that  the  rate  of  SAEs  was  in  general  similar  in  the  2  treatment  groups.  Only  for 
anaemia, was the rate higher (>2 times) in the zoledronic acid group and for cardio-respiratory arrest 
and femoral neck fracture in the placebo group. The numbers, however, are small but it is observed 
that  also  in  study  2301,  the  rate  of  anaemia  was  twice  as  common  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group 
compared with placebo. Overall for SAE, there were no unexpected or new adverse events.  
The CHMP noted that the rates of hyperthermia and pyrexia were high. When combined, the rate was 
11% and 3.4% in the zoledronic acid and placebo group, respectively. 
The CHMP also considered that the results were in compliance with previous findings with regard to 
ocular adverse reactions observed with zoledronic acid. 
The CHMP considered that concerning ONJ, the results are in line with previous observations, i.e. that 
the  risk  of  ONJ  is  low  in  non-oncology  indications  with  zoledronic  acid  and  that  the  current  SPC 
adequately addresses this issue. 
For other SAEs, there were no significant differences between the treatment groups, including atrial 
fibrillation SAE and stroke related death.  
Concomitant use of antipyretic medication 
As  expected  the  rate  of  post-dose  symptoms  was  lower  compared  to  the  rate  observed  in  previous 
studies (e.g. study 2301) where paracetamol or ibuprofen has not been recommended to reduce post-
dose  symptoms.  A  recommendation  for  the  use  of  paracetamol  or  ibuprofen  to  reduce  post-dose 
symptoms has already been introduced into the SPC for Aclasta. It was highlighted that paracetamol 
(acetaminophen)  was  not  given  proactively  in  study  2301  to  mitigate  the  incidence  of  post-dose 
symptoms.  
In study 2301, the most common AEs by preferred term in the zoledronic acid group were the post-
dose symptoms (pyrexia, myalgia, influenza-like illness, headache, arthralgia), all of which occurred 
at  approximately  4-  to  9-fold  higher  incidence  than  in  the  placebo  group.  Pyrexia  was  the  most 
common  AE  in  study  2301  and  study  2310.  Although  the  incidence  was  relatively  consistent in  the 
comparator  groups  (0.7  to  1.7%),  the  incidence  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  in  study  2301  was 
considerably higher (15.5%) than in the other studies (1.8% to 6.9%). All patients in Study 2310 were 
allowed  to  take  paracetamol  to  prevent  post-dose  symptoms,  with  no  control  group  included  in  this 
study for paracetamol use.  
Study  US136  is  currently  ongoing  to  assess  the  effect  of  acetaminophen  or  fluvastatin  in  the 
prevention of transient post-dose symptoms following an i.v. infusion of a single dose of zoledronic 
acid in postmenopausal women with low bone mass, and the CHMP considered that a change to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics may be appropriate when these results are available.

Limited information on laboratory changes is available and only data on clinically notable results was 
presented. However, these results did not give rise to concerns. 
Vitamin D supplementation 
Despite  loading  dose  of  vitamin  D  to  all  patients  prior  to  infusion  and  subsequent  vitamin  D  and 
calcium supplementation, hypocalcaemia occurred with zoledronic acid. This confirms findings from 
previous  studies.  The  symptomatic  event  is  most  likely  related  to  thyroidectomy.  The  current  SPC 
addresses the risk for hypocalcaemia and the need for adequate vitamin D and calcium substitution in 
relation to infusion with Aclasta. Whether there is a need for additional loading dose in patients with 
recent hip fracture was discussed by the MAH . 
Hypocalcaemia occurred with zoledronic acid, despite the administration of a loading dose of vitamin 
D  prior  to  infusion.  This  should  therefore  be  recommended  in  the  SPC  for  patients  with  recent 
fracture,  but  demand  for  calcium  may  be  higher  in  that  population  and  therefore  there  could  be 
increased risk of hypocalcaemia following zoledronic acid infusion.  
Based on previous studies, the incidence of vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis was expected to be 
relatively high in the population of Study 2310 (Mosekilde 2005). In this study vitamin D levels were 
not  routinely  measured  but  the  majority  of  patients received  a  loading  dose  of  vitamin  D  (75,000 – 
125,000 units of vitamin D2 or 50,000 – 75,000 units of vitamin D3 i.m. or orally) prior to the infusion 
of  zoledronic  acid,  followed  by  a  maintenance  dose  of    800  –  1200  IU  of  vitamin  D  p.o.  daily  and 
elemental calcium (1000 - 1500 mg p.o. daily in a divided dose).  
In study 2310, of the three adjudicated confirmed cases of hypocalcaemia in the zoledronic acid group, 
one  was  thought  to  be  related  to  study  medication  by  the  adjudication  committee,  and  none  of  the 
cases were symptomatic. The data from the 2301 and 2310 studies, demonstrate overall a very low risk 
of hypocalcaemia.  
The CHMP considered that it would be possible that as the demand for calcium is increased following 
a  fracture,  without  a loading  dose,  the  risk  of  hypocalcaemia  with  administration  of  zoledronic acid 
could  be  increased.  It  was  further  agreed  that  the  fact  that  all  patients  received  a  loading  dose  of 
vitamin D before the infusion, probably influenced the low rate of hypocalcaemia in the Study 2310.  
Therefore, a statement on loading dose of vitamin D in Aclasta treatment after fracture was added  to 
section 4.2 of the SPC.  
Fracture healing 
The study 2310 provided important information with regard to the concern whether bisphosphonates 
could affect fracture healing adversely. The rate of delayed healing/non-union was not increased in the 
zoledronic acid group, which was considered reassuring. Overall, there were similar rates of delayed 
union/non-union  in  the  2  treatment  groups,  3.4%  vs.  2.8%  in  the  zoledronic  acid  and  the  placebo 
group, respectively. This is of importance considering the design of the study where zoledronic acid 
was  given  to  patients  with  recent  fracture  but  there  have  been  concerns  that  bisphosphonates  might 
affect bone healing negatively. Delayed healing/non-union has not been observed in previous studies, 
but rates have been much lower (0.3% in the large post-menopausal study).  
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  question  whether  infusion  immediately  following  a  fracture  could 
affect fracture healing, however remained unanswered.   
Fractures were more frequent in the patients receiving zoledronic acid within 6 weeks compared with 
patients receiving infusion > 6 weeks after surgery. Apart from this, the sub-group analysis supports 
further the possible greater benefit/risk for zoledronic acid when given several weeks after hip 
fracture. As discussed above in the section on efficacy, the study was however not powered to show a 
reduction in clinical fractures in men. Therefore the decision on the earliest timepoint of infusion after 
hip fracture repair was based on BMD data, which supported the recommendation to give the Aclasta 
infusion two or more weeks after hip fracture repair.

Mortality 
Overall,  the  risk  of  death  was  decreased  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  by  28%.  This  is  difficult  to 
explain but may be indirectly related to the reduction in fracture rate, as hip fractures in the elderly 
population in general are associated with mortality as well as significant morbidity.  
Unadjudicated,  the  death  due  to  cerebrovascular  event  is  6  patients  treated  with  zoledronic  acid 
compared with 3 patients in the placebo group. Following adjudication, the rates are 7 versus 7 deaths 
in each group. This was considered unusual as rates of other AEs are often only presented as following 
adjudication, e.g. rates for hypocalcaemia and AVN. 
The rate of death appeared high (11%), even somewhat higher than calculated in the study plan, but 
not unexpected considering the elderly population with common co-morbidities, including a recent hip 
fracture with surgery. 
Hip fracture mortality was higher for men than for women, increases with age and is greater for those 
with  co-existing  illnesses  and  poor  pre-fracture functional  status  (Cooper  et  al  1992).,  Osteoporosis 
International;  2(6):285-9].  It  can  also  be  explained  by  the  high  age  of  patients in the  study  and the 
high rate of cardiovascular risk factors at baseline. 
However,  this  explains  only  a  certain  part  of  the  difference  in  death  rate  (14  more  patients  in  the 
zoledronic acid group than in the placebo group died after a refracture) and the rest of the difference in 
mortality remains unexplained. 
The  difference in  death  rates  between treatment  groups  are  likely  to  depend  on  a  number  of factors 
including  a)  the  increased  risk  of  mortality  due  to  their  entry  hip  fracture  b)  the  timing  of 
randomisation  following  hip  fracture  repair  c)  the  increased  risk  of  mortality  due  to  subsequent 
osteoporotic fracture(s) following randomisation d) excessive bone loss rate as a marker of frailty e) 
pre-existing medical conditions at the time of randomisation which could increase a patient´s risk of 
death  above  and  beyond  the  study  entry  hip  fracture  (e.  g.  the  association  between  CV  disease  and 
osteoporosis)  and  f)  medical  conditions  that  developed  during  the  course  of  the  study  that  would 
increase a subject´s risk of death.  
There  were  92  zoledronic acid-  and  139  placebo-treated  patients  who  had one or  more  new  clinical 
fractures during the study. 11/92 (12 %) of zoledronic acid-treated patients died compared to 24/139 
(17.3 %) of placebo-patients, corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 3.4 %. This difference did 
not reach statistical significance (p = 0.0994). 
No  apparent  mortality  benefit  was  seen  during  the  first  year  following  randomisation  which  is 
confirmed by the hazard ratio of 0.97. After this point, zoledronic acid appears to develop a consistent 
reduction in the mortality risk that is consistent at year 2 and year 3 and overall with the risk reduction 
ranging between 25 and 28 %. This suggests that other factors contribute to the reduction in mortality 
since most of the overall 36 % fracture risk reduction achieved by zoledronic acid occurred during the 
1st year (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95 % CI: 0.49 to 0.96). In the literature it has generally been accepted that 
the risk of death is high in all patients during the first 6 – 12 months following hip fracture surgery. 
Therefore  the  risk  of  death  during  the  first  year  should  be  comparable  and  any  benefit  obtained  by 
treatment with zoledronic acid would be observed after the first year of follow-up. 
In  long-term  trials  where  physical  health  of  the  population  is  expected  to  deteriorate  over  time, 
conditions  and  events  occurring  may  affect  efficacy  and  mortality/morbidity  outcomes.  To  examine 
this  further,  the  following  additional  post-randomisation  events  were  examined  with  respect  to 
relationship  with  subsequent  death:  change  in  total  hip  BMD  from  end  of  study  to  baseline,  the 
occurrence  of  a  fall  reported  as  an  AE  and  the  occurrence  of  pneumonia  reported  as  an  AE.  The 
occurrence  of  the  latter  two  AEs  has  been  shown  to  be  associated  with  increased  incidence  of 
cardiovascular  disease  and  subsequent  mortality.  Both  falls  and  pneumonia  occurred  in  >  5  %  of 
patients  in  each  treatment  group  and  thus  the  number  of  patients  who  had  an  event  would  be 
considered  adequate  to  be  able  to  test  for  whether  or  not  these  factors  explain  the  rate  of  death 
observed in study 2310.  
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
46
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH has shown baseline and incidence data for multiple factors influencing mortality in study 
2310. Apart from the frequency of re-fractures, age (especially the age group 65 - 74 years), BMI < 
19, pneumonia as adverse event, baseline mental status and previous stroke were risk factors for death. 
Prevalent or incident cardiovascular disease and diabetes also predisposed to mortality. Altogether, no 
clear explanation could be provided for the lower mortality rate in the actively treated group in study 
2310 and no conclusions with regard to a possible association with the treatment and/or the lower re-
fracture rates can be made. Thus, although it may be a chance finding it seems to be an area of interest 
for further investigation.  
Discontinuations 
The Discontinuation rate was high in study 2310, even somewhat higher than calculated in the study 
plan. This could be explained by the high death rate in the study. The rate of discontinuation due to 
other causes was not higher than would be expected (17%) and was similar in both treatment groups. 
However, overall there were more study completers in the placebo group when death was excluded  as 
a reason for discontinuation [A38] .The placebo group had more patients who died while the zoledronic 
acid group had more patients who discontinued the study for reasons other than death. 
Atrial fibrillation and arrhythmia 
The increased frequency of serious AEs from atrial fibrillation in the Aclasta treatment group as well 
as an increased risk for stroke related death in this group observed in study 2301 could not be observed 
in study 2310. This result is in contrast with findings from study 2301, where 0.7 % of zoledronic acid 
treated  patients  had  atrial  fibrillation,  compared  to  0.2  %  of  placebo  treated  patients  in  that  study. 
Since study 2310 is a smaller study than 2301 and as patients were not followed prospectively with 
respect to cardiac complications, these observations have to be interpreted with caution.  
While  in  Study  2310  the  rate  of  arrhythmia  in  general  was  not increased  in  the  group  that  received 
zoledronic  acid,  the  rate  of  tachyarrythmias  (tachycardia  and  atrial  fibrillation)  is  higher  in  the 
zoledronic  acid  group.  The  numbers,  however,  were  low  and  the  difference  was  not  considered 
significant, but the observation has to be interpreted in the perspective of the unexpectedly higher rate 
of atrial fibrillation SAE in the larger postmenopausal study. 
The  findings  from  study  2310  cannot  override  the  findings  of  that  much  larger  study  2301  with  a 
longer  study  duration.  As  in  study  2301,  most  atrial  fibrillation  events  occurred  more  than  30  days 
from  infusion  and  thus  appear  not  to  be  related  to  study  infusion.  Other  mechanisms  may  exist. 
Increased atrial fibrillation has been observed in large long-term studies with other bisphosphonates. 
The CHMP highlighted, that in the previous type II variation procedure (II/014), however an analysis 
of  safety  data  from  study  2310  showed  unexpectedly  that  previous  use  of  bisphosphonates  was  an 
independent risk factor for the development of atrial fibrillation. 
The frequencies of arrhythmia SAEs in study 2310 can however not be directly compared to that in 
study  2301  as  these  two  study  populations  differ  in  a  number  of  aspects.  None  of  the  studies  were 
designed  to  prospectively  evaluate  atrial  fibrillation  or  other  cardiovascular  events.  ECGs  were 
recorded in a substudy of 2301 but not at all in study 2310. 
As atrial fibrillation is very common in elderly patients, often asymptomatic and paroxysmal and may 
go  undetected  even  in  large  studies  not  specially  designed  to  monitor  for  atrial  fibrillation,  the 
circumstance that no safety signals concerning atrial fibrillation have come up for bisphosphonates in 
study 2310 does not exclude the possibility of a causal relationship. 
Renal safety  
Concerning renal adverse events, the circumstance that zoledronic acid treated patients in study 2310 
did not exhibit an overrepresentation of renal failure cannot override safety data from earlier clinical 
studies (especially study 2301). Data on renal safety cannot be directly compared to renal safety data 
from the postmenopausal osteoporosis study 2301 that included 7736 patients, as that study collected 
data on proteinuria and also measured serum creatinine and calculated GFR 10 days after infusion. 
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
47
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP highlighted that short-term renal effects were not studied but sufficient data was provided 
in  the  large  postmenopausal  study  2301.  Transient  increases  in  creatinine  following  infusion  are 
common and of importance for the population with recent hip fracture and surgery. The current SPC, 
however, adequately addresses this issue. With regard to long-term effects, the results confirm those of 
previous trials in non-oncology indications.  
The  higher  incidence  of  transient  renal  dysfunction  after  infusion  of  zoledronic  acid  in  study  2301 
however  remains  to  be  of  concern.  Such  transient  renal  dysfunction  episodes  may,  especially  in  an 
elderly patient population, result in a more severe renal insufficiency. In clinical routine, as opposed to 
in  clinical  studies,  and  in  elderly  patients  without  post  infusion  monitoring,  there  is  very  limited 
experience in patients with an estimated creatinine clearance below 40 ml/min.  
The  MAH  presented  further  justification  to  lower  the  limit  for  creatinine  clearance  from  40  to  35 
ml/min in the SPC for the use of Aclasta taking into account all safety data from clinical trials and post 
marketing.  
The  renal  safety  of  zoledronic  acid  established  in  the  pivotal  fracture  study  2301  was  further 
corroborated in the 2310 study. The population studied in 2310, although smaller in absolute numbers, 
had a much higher degree of fragility as highlighted by their more than threefold higher mortality rate 
(Aclasta 9.6%, placebo 13.3%) than the death rate in study 2301 (3.4% vs. 2.9%) with a mean age of 
75 years. In both studies patients needed to have a calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) above 30.0 
ml/min. Besides older age, hypertension and increased glucose, other atherosclerotic risk factors, such 
as hyperlipidaemia, were also considered to have impact on renal function, even when no underlying 
kidney disease is present.  
Patients with a serum creatinine clearance between 30 and 35 ml/min had a higher incidence of renal 
laboratory  deterioration in the  zoledronic acid  treated  males  than  the  placebo  treated  males in  study 
2310.  For  patients  with  a  baseline  serum  creatinine  clearance  between  35  and  45  ml/min,  renal 
laboratory  deterioration  was  seen  somewhat  more  often  in  the  placebo  group  than  in  the  zoledronic 
acid group. No significant differences were seen between treatment groups with respect to creatinine 
clearance decreases  ≥ 30 % with baseline value ≤ 60 ml/min and the MAH’s proposal to change the 
lower GFR limit for treatment with Aclasta, from 40 to 35 ml/min, can therefore be accepted. 
Pooled safety data  
The  MAH  further  provided  pooled  safety  data  from  studies  2310 and  2301  for  post-dose  symptoms 
and for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter. The tendency to an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation/atrial 
flutter  SAEs  in  the  zoledronic  treated  patient  group  persisted  after  pooling  of  data,  with  a  1.7-fold 
greater incidence in this group. The MAH has suggested a new wording for adverse events in section 
4.8 of the SPC, where the numbers for frequency of post-dose symptoms have been exchanged from 
the  numbers  from  study  2301  to  the  pooled  safety  data.  Since  patients  in  study  2310  received 
prophylaxis against post-dose symptoms, such symptoms occurred less frequently in that study. The 
inclusion  of  information  on  pooled  study  data  for  atrial  fibrillation/atrial  flutter  SAEs  was  also 
suggested by the MAH.  
Since baseline data, especially with respect to age and gender, as well as the recommendations given 
to patients for prophylaxis against post-dose symptoms, differed between studies 2301 and 2310 and 
as  2301  is  a  much  larger  study  the  additional  information  was  added  in  section  4.8  in  the  SPC  ^to 
explain in what aspects AEs differed between the studies 2310 and 2301. 
Safety in the male population  
Due to the different populations and study designs, the CHMP considered that pooling of safety data 
from the Studies 2310 and 2308 could be questioned. The males in study 2310 were nearly a decade 
older  than the  study  population  in  study  2308  and  many  males  over the age  of 75  were included  in 
2310. Especially, incidence of some age related AEs in the placebo controlled Study 2310 are diluted 
by this pooling, such as renal AEs and these should therefore be presented per study. For arrhythmias 
and other cardiovascular AEs, this has been done in the table but not in the text, explaining why rates 
are generally lower in the text compared with rates in the table for the Study 2310.

Atrial fibrillation did not occur with increased rate, although adjudicated cases confirmed AF SAE in 3 
patients treated with zoledronic acid compared with 1 patient in each of the other groups (placebo and 
alendronate).  Atrial  fibrillation  is  currently  being  monitored  within  the  RMP  for  Aclasta  and 
furthermore,  is  under  review  for  all  bisphosphonates  by  the  PhVWP.  Stroke  related  AEs  were  not 
increased in the zoledronic acid group. Hypocalcaemia was observed in 3 patients receiving zoledronic 
acid  compared  with  1  in  each  of  the  other  groups,  but  all  patients  received  vitamin  D  and  calcium 
supplementation  and  in  Study  2310,  a  loading  dose  of  vitamin  D  was  given  prior  to  infusion.  The 
difference  in  the  rate  of  post-infusion  reactions  can  be  explained  by  different  recommendations  on 
prophylaxis with paracetamol/NSAID. 
The  higher  number  of  patients  with  transient  creatinine  elevations  observed  in  the  zoledronic  acid 
group in study 2308 can not directly be compared to data from 2310 as the latter study did not record 
lab  values  at  9  –  11  days  post  infusion.  The  significance  of  these  transient  elevations  of  creatinine 
remains unclear. In general, there was a higher incidence of renal events in study 2310 than in 2308, 
possibly  related  to  the  older  study  population  in  2310.  The  frequency  of  renal  events  did  not 
significantly  differ  between  study  groups  in  study  2310.  In  study  2308,  renal  events  were  more 
common in alendronate-treated than in zoledronic acid-treated patients. 
Overall, there  were  no  new  or  unexpected  AEs  or  SAEs  observed  in the  male population  compared 
with the post-menopausal female population. 
Post-marketing experience 
There  is  limited  post-marketing  experience  with  zoledronic  acid  used  in  non-oncology  indications. 
Based on results from a large long-term study in postmenopausal osteoporosis, a type II variation to 
add  atrial  fibrillation  to  the  list  of  adverse  events  was  finalised  recently  (II-14).  During  the  PSUR 
period,  there  were  6  cases  of  hypocalcaemia  despite  vitamin  D  and  calcium  supplementation.  The 
MAH committed to continue to monitor hypocalcaemia. No other new safety signals were observed, 
but  the  MAH  will  also  continue  to  monitor  ONJ,  renal  dysfunction,  ocular  disorders,  avascular 
necrosis, atrial fibrillation and cerebrovascular events. 
PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN AND RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN (RMP) 
The elements of the proposed risk management plan (RMP) are consistent with the recommendations 
made in the ICH E2E Guideline on Pharmacovigilance and the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management 
Systems for Medicinal Products for Human Use (November 20, 2005). The structure and content of 
the  initial  RMP  were  satisfactory,  however  it  did  not  follow  the  template  for  EU  RMP  (September 
2006). The MAH therefore presented a revised RMP during the procedure. 
Risk management plan (RMP) for Aclasta 
The MAH updated the RMP with relevant information related to the extension of indication, including 
the proposed change the recommendation not to treat patients with a creatinine clearance cut-off less 
than 40 ml/min to 35 ml/min. Relevant parts of this RMP are summarised below.

Renal insufficiency  
Size of the study population 
The Aclasta program in post-menopausal osteoporosis in the completed controlled studies has 10675 
patients  (studies  2301/2313/2315/2407/2310)  with  approximately  5504  having  received  at  least  one 
dose and up to 5 doses of Aclasta. The patient-years exposure to zoledronic acid in this dataset is over 
12947 patient-years of exposure to study medication. 
The  key  safety  population  is  from  study  2301,  a  multicentre,  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-
controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in the treatment of osteoporosis 
in PMO women taking calcium and vitamin D. 
Safety risks 
Identified safety risks in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis 
Post dose symptoms 
In Study 2301, the most common early onset AEs (=5%) within 3 days of any infusion included fever, 
myalgia, influenza-like illness, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, pain in extremity and arthralgia. 
The incidence of post dose symptoms decreased after each annual infusion. The incidence rates of the 
transient  post-dose  symptoms  were  much  lower  in  study  2310  than  what  was  seen  in  study  2301, 
which could be attributed to patients without contraindication to acetaminophen (paracetamol) being 
provided  with  the  standard  labelled  dose  of  oral  acetaminophen  (paracetamol)  at  the  time  of  i.v. 
administration  of study  medication  and  were  instructed  to  use  as  needed for  the  next 72  hours after 
infusion and as labelled in the respective country. 
The incidence of AEs which started within 3 days of the first study drug infusion was 3-fold higher in 
the  zoledronic  acid  group  than  in  the  placebo  group  (44.7%  vs.  14.8%).  The  median  number  of 
infusions was 2.  
Renal dysfunction 
Bisphosphonates  are  excreted  by  the  kidney  and  are  known  to  have  the  potential  to  affect  renal 
function, especially when given intravenously and administered as a bolus. In study 2301 systematic 
assessment of patients 9-11 days following infusion was able to detect short-term increases in serum 
creatinine  (1.8%  in  zoledronic  acid  vs.  0.8%  in  placebo)  and  proteinuria  (0.6%  in  patients  on 
zoledronic  acid  vs.  0.18%  on  placebo).  Long-term  effects  on  renal  function  over  36  months,  which 
represents the aggregate effect of multiple annual doses, did not demonstrate any difference between 
groups  with  respect  to  serum  creatinine  increases,  creatinine  clearance  decreases  or  proteinuria.  In 
study  2310  the  results  were  comparable  between  treatment  groups  for  renal  and  urinary  disorders 
overall (9.49% for zoledronic acid vs. 9.93% for placebo).  In the updated version of the RMP, renal 
dysfunction is consistently classified as an identified risk. 
Ocular adverse events 
Ocular adverse events such as uveitis, iritis, episcleritis and conjunctivitis are known class effects of 
bisphosphonates. In study 2301, the incidence of confirmed adjudicated ocular adverse events was less 
than 3.3% in patients treated with zoledronic acid vs. 2.7% in placebo. Of this, conjunctivitis was seen 
most  frequently  followed  by  uveitis  and  episcleritis.  Patients  treated  with  Aclasta  exhibited  a  30% 
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
50
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher  relative  risk  of  developing  ocular  adverse  events.  These  adverse  events  were  not  visually 
threatening and could be treated conservatively with topical therapy using either steroids or antibiotics. 
In study 2310 the results were comparable between treatment groups. 
Hypocalcaemia 
Transient hypocalcaemia is a well characterised side effect to the treatment with bisphosphonates. In 
study 2301, serum calcium values below 1.87 mmol/l were detectable in 0.24% of patients treated with 
zoledronic  acid  vs.  0.13%  in  placebo.  None  of  the  cases  were  symptomatic  and  they  generally 
occurred  in  patients  with  pre-existing  conditions  such  as  parathyroidectomy  or  malabsorption  of 
calcium.  
In study 2310 after adjudication, the figures for AEs of hypocalcaemia were 3 (0.28%) for zoledronic 
acid patients versus 0 for placebo patients. 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
As of 30th April 2007, one case of osteomyelitis of the jaw and no cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported  as  adverse  events  in  the  studies  on  postmenopausal  osteoporosis  or  Paget’s  disease  with 
zoledronic acid. Maxillofacial adjudication of the total HORIZON safety database after a systematic 
MedDRA search for maxillofacial events found 1 case in the zoledronic acid group and 1 case [A40]in 
the  placebo  group  meeting  predefined  adjudication  criteria  for  ONJ.  No  reports  of  osteonecrosis  or 
osteomyelitis  of  the  jaw  have  been  received  from  post-marketing  sources.  No  cases  of  ONJ  were 
reported in study 2310. 
Potential risks in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis 
Osteonecrosis outside the jaw and non-union or delayed fracture healing 
Four patients in the zoledronic acid group and 3 patients in the placebo group revealed osteonecrosis 
outside the maxillofacial area. One patient in the zoledronic acid group and one patient in the placebo 
group  had  a  report  of  a  non-union  fracture.  Thus,  from  these  study  data  there was  no  evidence  that 
administration of zoledronic acid is associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis outside the jaw or 
impaired  fracture  healing.  No  cases  of  osteonecrosis  outside  the  jaw  or  delayed/non-union  were 
reported in study 2310. 
The RMP has been amended with the number of post-marketing reports of osteonecrosis outside the 
jaw and delayed/non-union observed in study 2310. 
Cerebrovascular events 
In  study  2301,  there  was  a  greater  number  of  deaths  with  a  cerebrovascular  event  as  underlying 
condition for zoledronic acid (0.34%) than for placebo (0.13%). The total number of strokes between 
the 2 treatment groups was, however, similar, and overall prevalence of stroke less than that seen in 
previous cross-sectional studies of populations with characteristics similar to those of patients in study 
2301.  Study  2310  did  not  confirm  the  finding  observed  in  study  2301  (adjudicated  cerebrovascular 
deaths 0.66% in the zoledronic acid group vs. 0.66% in the placebo group). 
Atrial fibrillation 
Cardiovascular  side  effects  have  not  been  associated  with  bisphosphonates  in  previous  studies.  In 
study  2301,  patients  treated  with  zoledronic  acid  exhibited  a  threefold  greater  incidence  of  atrial 
fibrillation SAE’s. A statistically significant increase in the risk of all atrial fibrillation events was not 
demonstrated and an ECG study in a subgroup of patients did not reveal any differences between the 
zoledronic  acid  and  placebo  groups.  The  events  did  not  occur  early  after  infusion,  when  drug 
concentrations  in  serum  were  the  highest.  Oncology  patients  subjected  to  doses  much  higher  than 
those used in Paget’s disease and postmenopausal osteoporosis have not revealed increased incidence 
of  atrial  fibrillation.  In  study  2310,  the  rate  of  atrial  fibrillation/atrial  flutter  AEs  were  comparable 
between  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  the  placebo  group  (2.85%  vs.  2.65%)  and  so  were  the  atrial 
fibrillation/atrial flutter SAEs (1.14 in the zoledronic acid group vs. 1.42% in the placebo group). 
A  causal  relationship  between  zoledronic  acid  and  development  of  atrial  fibrillation  is  difficult  to 
establish  at  present,  and  for  the  time  being  it  is  therefore  considered  acceptable  to  classify  atrial 
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
51
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fibrillation  as  an  important  potential  risk.  The  MAH  has  presented  Pharmacovigilance  activities  for 
this  potential  risk  in  the  Pharmacovigilance  Plan  (committed  to  perform  a  long-term  observational 
epidemiological study with the end-points skeletal and cardiovascular complications and an extension 
of study 2301E for a total of 9 years).  
In  the  revised  RMP,  the  MAH  has  amended  the  section  “Populations  not  studied  in  the  pre-
authorisation  phase  use”  with  use  in  children/adolescents,  pregnancy/lactation  and  in  patients  with 
CrCl <30 ml/min. Moreover risk minimisation activities (information in the SPC) have been specified. 
Gastrointestinal adverse events 
In study 2301, the overall incidence of gastrointestinal AEs was similar between patients treated with 
Aclasta  (38.24%)  and  placebo  (35.28%).  In  study  2313  and  study  2315,  the  incidence  rates  were 
28.0% for Aclasta and 24.6% for alendronate. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were seen more often 
in  patients  treated  with  Aclasta  during  the  first  3  days  following  infusions  as  part  of  the  post  dose 
symptoms  but  these  imbalances  disappeared  at  later  time  points.  In  study  2310,  the  incidence  of 
gastrointestinal AEs was similar between patients treated with Aclasta (24.9%) and placebo (25.3%).

Discussion of the RMP 
The MAH has submitted an updated RMP (version 004) with minor changes compared to the previous 
version  assessed  in the frame  of  the  extension  of  indication  to include postmenopausal  osteoporosis 
during the procedure. 
In the updated version of the RMP, renal dysfunction is consistently classified as an identified risk and 
gastrointestinal adverse events as potential risks. 
Gastrointestinal adverse events are consistently classified as potential risk and have been included into 
the table “Ongoing safety concerns” and the pharmacovigilance and risk minimisation activities have 
been  included  into  the  table  “Summary  of  Activities  for  Each  Safety  Concern”.  Although 
gastrointestinal  AEs  are  a  class  effect  mainly  of  oral  bisphosphonates,  the  risk  of  gastric  and 
oesophageal  erosions  and  bleedings  due  to  direct  toxic  effects  from  bisphosphonate  tablets  on  the 
mucosa is eliminated by the intravenous route of administration.  
For that reason GI adverse events are considered a potential risk. Gastrointestinal side effects such as 
nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea seen after administration of zoledronic acid are part of the post-dose 
symptom complex. These symptoms are transient, mostly mild and have no impact on gastrointestinal 
safety. 
The RMP has been amended with the number of post-marketing reports of osteonecrosis outside the 
jaw and delayed/non-union observed in study 2310 as requested. 
It is agreed that a causal relationship between zoledronic acid and development of atrial fibrillation is 
difficult to establish at present, and for the time being it is therefore considered acceptable to classify 
atrial fibrillation as an important potential risk. The MAH has presented pharmacovigilance activities 
for this potential risk in the Pharmacovigilance Plan. 
In  the  revised  RMP,  the  MAH  has  amended  the  section  “Populations  not  studied  in  the  pre-
authorisation  phase  use”  with  use  in  children/adolescents,  pregnancy/lactation  and  in  patients  with 
CrCl <30 ml/min. Moreover risk minimisation activities (information in the SPC) have been specified. 
The  MAH  also  provided  revised  educational  material  for  patients  and  physicians  reflecting  data 
submitted  in  support  of  this  extension  of  indication  and  the  new  indication.  The  CHMP  considered 
these documents acceptable. 
Due to the unknown long-term safety effects with zoledronic acid treatment the MAH has committed 
to  perform  a  retrospective  study  in  non-oncology  patients  (Australia)  and  a  long-term  observational 
epidemiological study for 10 years with the end-points; skeletal and cardiovascular complications after 
being prescribed Aclasta compared to patients being prescribed oral bisphosphonates. All patients who 
were being prescribed Aclasta in the three Scandinavian countries will be included.  
The MAH has committed to including patients according to all approved indications in this follow-up 
safety study, i.e. now also “men at increased risk of fracture, including those with a recent low-trauma 
hip fracture” This extension of the scope for the Scandinavian study is expected to be included in the 
awaited response to the Follow up Measure (FUMs 016.2, 017.3, 019) concerning the revised protocol 
of this study. 
Moreover, the MAH has committed to present a revised protocol for the study 2301E (extension study 
for 3 years in the treatment of osteoporosis in PMO women) with further efforts to capture cases of 
atrial fibrillation including ECGs prior to and after infusions, increased vigilance for symptoms and an 
intensified follow-up of patients with symptoms, as well as to present a study protocol for an extension 
of study 2301E for an addition of 3 years (total of 9 years).These commitments were included in the 
MAH’s Letter of Undertaking.

Environmental Risk Assessment 
The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) was calculated by the formula proposed in guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00. 
The present assessment suggests that, based on the very low amount of active ingredient put on the 
market and the very low dose per patient, the placement of the foreseen amounts of Aclasta on the EU 
market  does  not  constitute  any  significant  risk  to  the  environment.  No  specific  labelling  or  risk 
mitigation measures are deemed necessary. As with all non-readily biodegradable human medicines, 
unused Aclasta should not be disposed off via domestic sewage. 
The MAH accepted to use the default Fpen of 1%, which results in a PECsw value that exceeds the 
trigger  value  of  0.01  µg/l.  Consequently  the  MAH  was  requested  to  proceed  to  a  phase  II  fate  and 
analysis according to CHMP/SWP/4447/00. The use of toxicity data for structural analogues in view 
of zoledronic acid was considered not acceptable in this analysis. The MAH therefore committed to 
follow up on this outstanding issue as outlined in the MAH’s Letter of Undertaking. 
Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment 
Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP concluded that additional studies performed since 2004 confirm the earlier findings and 
have  increased the  understanding  of  the  mechanisms  of  action  of  zoledronic  acid.  No  new concerns 
have emerged from these studies. 
Overall,  the  data  from  the  4  studies  discussed  above  indicate  that  clinically  relevant  doses  of 
zoledronic acid administered peri- or post-operatively prolong the retention of trabecular bone in the 
callus of a healing fracture, thereby increasing bone mass and mechanical strength at the fracture site. 
Apart from the cosmetic effect of transient retention of a larger callus, no long-term deleterious effects 
on fracture healing were observed in animals treated with zoledronic acid. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  all  three  animal  models  showed  increased  callus  formation  after 
zoledronic acid was given at an early stage of fracture repair. The quality of the newly formed bone 
was considered sufficient, despite the expected transient delay of remodelling. 
Conclusion on clinical efficacy 
The CHMP overall concluded that prevention of re-fracture after low energy trauma hip fracture has 
been convincingly demonstrated by the MAH in study 2310. It was therefore considered reasonable to 
include this group of patients in the wording of the indication. However, the initialy proposed wording 
relating to prevention of osteoporosis was considered not to be in line with the current guidelines on 
osteoporosis and was therefore further modified. 
Concerning the inclusion of treatment of osteoporotic men in the indication for Aclasta, the MAH has 
provided complementary data on the difference in baseline BMD and BMD increases from baseline 
between males and females in study 2310 (fracture prevention after low energy trauma hip fracture). 
Furthermore  the  differences  in  baseline  BMD and  BMD  increases  between the  males  in study  2310 
and the women in study 2301 (postmenopausal osteoporosis) have been compared. 
The absolute change in BMD for males and females from baseline during study period in studies 2310 
and  2301  were  similar.  The  between-treatment  comparison  of  change  in  percentage  total  hip  BMD 
relative to baseline did not significantly differ between males and females. 
It was agreed by the CHMP that in this case it is acceptable to use hip BMD data for bridging data in 
males to a PMO population. It was also accepted that male osteoporotic patients can have a somewhat 
higher basal BMD than a female osteoporotic population. 
Although some risk factors for fractures in baseline data are not identical between the males in study 
2310  and  the  PMO  women  in  study  2301,  the  males  are  considered  to  have  a  total  risk  of  fracture 
comparable  to  that  of  the  2301  study  population.  The  circumstances  that  these  men  had  already 
Aclasta-H-535-II-16-AR 
56
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
suffered a low energy hip fracture and that the placebo group of males in study 2310 had a fracture 
rate comparable to the placebo group in 2301 are important for the CHMP’s conclusion that the male 
subpopulation in study 2310 had a similar risk of fracture as the PMO population in study 2301. To 
some extent the estimation of fracture risk in the male population of study 2310 is also supported by 
external literature data. 
The  population  of  males  studied,  including  the  population  in  Study  2308  was  considered 
representative of the target population and supports an indication in male osteoporosis. 
The CHMP concluded that the MAH has performed thorough analyses of the risk factors for fractures 
in  the  osteoporotic  male  population  in  comparison  to  populations  of  postmenopausal  women  and  to 
populations of osteoporotic men in other studies. Due to differences between sexes in factors such as 
hormonal status and intercurrent diseases, the baseline data can not be expected to be exactly identical 
in the different study populations.  
Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that  efficacy  in  the  general  male  osteoporotic  population  was 
convincingly shown, according to the Guideline on Primary Osteoporosis, as all four above-mentioned 
criteria for bridging were fulfilled. The bridging of the postmenopausal osteoporosis efficacy data to 
the male population of the efficacy study was therefore considered sufficiently justified. 
Thus in the CHMP’s opinion, the criteria for bridging data from the males in study 2310 to the PMO 
population  have  therefore  been  fulfilled  and  the  indication  male  osteoporosis  can  be  accepted  for 
Aclasta.  
Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  adverse  event  profile  is  consistent  with  adverse  events  observed  in 
previous  studies  with  zoledronic  acid  in  non-oncology  indications.  No  new  safety  signals  have 
emerged.  Adverse  reactions  were  mainly  post-infusion  reactions,  such  as  pyrexia  and  influenza-like 
illness, which occur within 3 days. The incidence of post-dose symptoms decreased with subsequent 
infusion,  confirming  the  results  of  previous  studies  with  repeated  infusions.  The  CHMP  further 
concluded  that  the  safety  in  men  with  osteoporosis  was  comparable  to  the  data  in  postmenopausal 
women with osteoporosis. 
Benefit / Risk Assessment 
The  CHMP  concluded  that  an  appropriate  risk/benefit  could  be  demonstrated  in  postmenopausal 
women after hip fracture. This population is already covered by the existing indication (osteoporosis 
in post-menopausal women at increased risk of fracture). The fact that this population is included in 
the  existing  indication  was  however  reflected  in  the  new  indication.  The  bridging  to  extend  the 
indication  to  include  male  osteoporosis  was  considered  to  be  sufficiently  justified  in  line  with  the 
Guideline on Primary Osteoporosis. It could further be demonstrated that the data from the population 
studied in study 2310 could also be extrapolated to men at risk of fracture that did not have a previous 
hip fracture. Concerning Safety, no new worrying signals were detected, and it could be demonstrated 
that post-infusion reactions decrease with the number of subsequent infusions. The introduction of a 
loading dose of vitamin D before infusion with Aclasta for the group of patients that suffered a recent 
low-trauma hip fracture was considered beneficial[A42]. The study data also supported a change in the 
recommendation  not  to  use  Aclasta  in  patients  with  creatinine  clearance  from  <40  ml/min  to 
<35 ml/min. Overall, the CHMP therefore concluded that the benefit/risk continues to be favourable. 
CHANGES TO THE PRODUCT INFORMATION 
The  detailed  changes  can  be  found  in  the  final  approved  highlighted  SPC/Annex  II/  Labelling/  PL 
attached to this report. 
Changes were also made to Annex II in section “Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and 
effective  use  of  the  medicinal  product”  to  reflect  that  revised  educational  material  for  healthcare 
professionals and patients will be made available following the launch of the new indication.

Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following changes to 
the Product Information were requested and subsequently implemented by the MAH. 
The PL was updated accordingly. 
SPC: 
Section 4.1 Therapeutic Indications 
The CHMP proposed that additional information to be included in section 4.1 of the SPC should be 
more  exact  than  the  wording  proposed  by  the  MAH.  Additionally,  the  initially  proposed  indication 
wording relating to prevention of Osteoporosis was not in line with the “Guideline on the evaluation of 
new  medicinal  products  in  the  treatment  of  primary  osteoporosis”.  The  following  wording  was 
proposed:  “Treatment  of  osteoporosis  in  post-menopausal  women  at  increased  risk  of  fracture, 
including  those  with  a  recent  hip  fracture”  This  wording  was  considered  to  be  line  with  the  latest 
version of SPC Guidelines for section 4.1. Taken together with the fact that the CHMP also agreed to 
include  males  in  the  indication,  the  CHMP  agreed  on  the  final  wording  (changes  are  highlighted  in 
bold)   
“Treatment of osteoporosis

at increased risk of fracture, including those with a recent low-trauma hip fracture.” 
 in post-menopausal women 
in men 
Section 4.2: Posology and method of administration  
It seemed very likely that delayed dosing in humans would give better results than dosing immediately 
after fracture. The CHMP agreed that patients with a recent low trauma hip fracture should be dosed at 
least 2 weeks after hip fracture surgery. Thus, information about the ideal timing after fracture repair 
was included in sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SPC. 
The CHMP considered that it would be possible that as the demand for calcium is increased following 
a  fracture,  without  a loading  dose,  the  risk  of  hypocalcaemia  with  administration  of  zoledronic acid 
could  be  increased.  Therefore,  a  statement  on  loading  dose  of  vitamin  D  in  Aclasta  treatment  after 
fracture was added  to section 4.2 of the SPC.  
Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
This section was revised in line with the changes regarding the loading dose of vitamin D in section 
4.2. 
Section 4.8: Undesirable effects 
This section has been further revised to reflect the final safety data from study 2308 and 2310. 
Since baseline data, especially with respect to age and gender, as well as the recommendations given 
to patients for prophylaxis against post-dose symptoms, differed between studies 2301 and 2310 and 
as 2301 is a much larger study, the additional information on the differences in terms of AEs between 
the studies 2310 and 2301 was included in the SPC.  
Section 5.1: Pharmacodynamic properties 
Overall, this section was revised to enhance readability by reduction of the size of the text. 
The  fact  that  no  significant  effect  on  fracture  rate  in  males  could  be  observed  is  reflected  in  this 
section of the SPC . 
The rate of new morphometric fractures was similar to the rate in post-menopausal females, although 
the  few  cases  make  any  interpretation  in  this  respect  uncertain.  Information  on  lumbar  spine  BMD 
data from Study 2308 was also included.  
The (non-significant) reduction in clinical fractures in study 2310 was 15% in the male population in 
Study  2310  compared  with  33%  in  Study  2301,  however  Study  2310  was  not  powered  to  show

differences in fracture rates in subgroups. The fact that no significant effect on fracture rate in males 
could be observed is therefore reflected in the SPC section 5.1. 
Labelling 
The  CHMP  agreed  to  the  justification  of  the  MAH  not  to  include  Braille,  as  Aclasta  will  only  be 
administered by healthcare professionals. Therefore the text in section 16 “Information in Braille” (on 
folding box only) was removed.

CONCLUSION 
On  24  July  2008  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II,  Labelling  and 
Package Leaflet. 
Follow-up measures undertaken by the Marketing Authorisation Holder  
As requested by the CHMP, the MAH agreed to submit the follow-up measures as listed below and to 
submit  any  variation  application  which  would  be  necessary  in  the  light  of  compliance  with  these 
commitments (see Letter of Undertaking attached to this report):

be provided.  
The MAH commits to perform an extension of study 
2301E1 for an addition of 3 years. A study protocol 
should be presented within 3 months. 
The MAH commits to perform a long-term observational 
epidemiological study (for at least 10 years) with the 
end-points; cardio- and cerebrovascular disease and 
fractures/delayed fracture healing. A study protocol 
should be presented within 3 months. 
At 5 years an interim analysis will be performed to 
determine how many patients are still treated with 
Aclasta  that will guide whether a further 5 years will be 
justified . 
The MAH commits to update the study protocol to cover 
the extended target population. 
An updated RMP will be submitted to provide a revised 
description of the long-term observational 
epidemiological study to include the extended target 
population.

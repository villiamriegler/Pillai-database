2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Fosaprepitant is a selective, high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin-1 (NK1) 
receptors and is used in prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting due to highly 
emetogenic and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (HEC and MEC, respectively) in adults. 
This application aims to expand the indication of fosaprepitant to paediatric patients 6 months to 17 
years of age.  
The difficulty of administering oral medications to children is often compounded by additional factors in 
paediatric cancer patients, such as anticipatory CINV and chemotherapy-related odynophagia and 
mucositis; thus the applicant sees a need to evaluate intravenously administered antiemetic agents 
that could circumvent some of the difficulties and provide more convenient dosing and potentially can 
improve patient adherence to prophylactic anti-emetic regimens. 
The submission is based on modelling and simulation, discussed in the frame of the PIP (EMEA-
000406-PIP01-08-M04) initially approved on July 15, 2009 (full compliance check confirmed on 
October 10, 2014) and with the Rapporteurs during a pre-submission meeting on 19 December 2016. 
The paediatric clinical development for fosaprepitant consists of three paediatric clinical studies, 
Protocol P134, P029 and P044.  
The pathophysiology of CINV is similar in adults and children, resulting from activation of 
neurotransmitter receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CRTZ) by chemotherapeutic agents.  
Both peripheral and central pathways can activate neuronal nuclei in this area and lead to vomiting. 
Serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists are widely used as antiemetic prophylaxis and are 
predominantly active on the peripheral terminals of vagal afferents in the gastrointestinal tract and 
CRTZ. NK1-receptor antagonists, such as aprepitant and its prodrug fosaprepitant, act centrally by 
blocking substance P from binding to NK1 receptors in the brain. 
According to the applicant, efficacy of 1-day fosaprepitant treatment in children can be predicted from 
that demonstrated in adults based on similar chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) 
pathophysiology and response to NK1 receptor antagonists, given comparable fosaprepitant exposures 
and duration of emetogenic chemotherapy. Further, the applicant states that the conversion of 
fosaprepitant to aprepitant is rapid and occurs within the time of drug infusion (30 to 60 minutes); 
therefore, efficacy following fosaprepitant administration can be expected to be derived from exposure 
to aprepitant. Based on this rationale the applicant bridged the efficacy of 3-day fosaprepitant 
treatment in children from that demonstrated with the paediatric 3-day oral aprepitant regimen 
(aprepitant capsule is indicated in patients from the age of 12 years old, whereas aprepitant powder 
for oral suspension is indicated from the age of 6 months to less than 12 years). 
Additionally, the MAH would like to use this opportunity to add hypersensitivity as an identified 
important risk in the RMP, as requested by the Agency following the outcome of 
MEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001471/201603 (CHMP Opinion dated 10 November 2016).

Figure 1: Efficacy Extrapolation/Bridging for 1-day and 3-day Pediatric Fosaprepitant 
Regimens 
The recommended dose regimen of IVEMEND, to be administered with a 5-HT3 antagonist, with or 
without a corticosteroid, for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with administration of 
single or multi-day chemotherapy regimens of Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy (HEC) or Moderately 
Emetogenic Chemotherapy (MEC), is shown in Table 1. Single day chemotherapy regimens include 
those regimens in which HEC or MEC is administered for a single day only. Multi-day chemotherapy 
regimens include chemotherapy regimens in which HEC or MEC is administered for 2 or more days. 
An alternative dose regimen that may be used with single-day chemotherapy regimens is shown in 
Table 2.  
Dosing for Single or Multi-Day Chemotherapy Regimens 
For paediatric patients receiving single or multi-day regimens of HEC or MEC, administer IVEMEND as 
an intravenous infusion through a central venous catheter on Days 1, 2, and 3. EMEND capsules or 
EMEND for oral suspension may be used on Days 2 and 3 instead of IVEMEND, as shown in Table 1.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The plasma exposure to aprepitant following IV administration of fosaprepitant has been characterized 
previously in adults. The plasma exposure to aprepitant following per oral (PO) administration of 
aprepitant (Emend) oral solution or capsules has been previously characterized in children from 6 
months of age to 18 years of age and in adults. 
The current variation concerns the extension of use of IV fosaprepitant in children 6 months of age to 
18 years of age. Therefore, this section will mainly focus on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of aprepitant in 
this population following IV administration of fosaprepitant. 
Study 134 
A Multi-center, Open-label, 5-Part Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of 
Aprepitant and Fosaprepitant Dimeglumine in Pediatric Patients Receiving Emetogenic Chemotherapy 
A study schematic is shown in the  
Figure 2 below. 
Figure 2: Schematic of the design of study 134 (grey boxes indicate cohorts that were 
originally planned but later not included) 
Patients were enrolled in age descending cohorts. The design of the study allowed evaluation of PK in 
older children before commencing treatment in younger patients in order to be able to adjust the dose 
between cohorts.

Both 1 day and 3 day regimens were evaluated. For children >= 12 years of age a fixed dosing 
regimen was used while for children < 12 years of age the dose was adjusted according to body size, 
either weight or body surface area. The different dose levels are listed below: 
Part I (12 to 17 years of age) 
Step A 
Day 1: Fosaprepitant 115 mg IV + ondansetron IV 
Days 2-3: Aprepitant 80 mg by mouth (PO) + ondansetron IV 
Step B 
Day 1: Fosaprepitant 150 mg IV + ondansetron IV 
Part II (Birth to <12 years of age) 
Step A 
Day 1: Equivalent to aprepitant 80 mg PO + ondansetron IV 
  6 months to <12 years of age: Aprepitant 47 mg/m2 PO 
Step B 
Day 1: Equivalent to aprepitant 125 mg PO + ondansetron IV 
  2 years to <12 years of age: Aprepitant 74 mg/m2 PO 
  6 months to <2 years of age: Aprepitant 1.3mg/kg PO 
Part III (Birth to <12 years) 
Days 1 to 3: Ondansetron IV 
Part IV (Birth to <12 years) 
Day 1: Equivalent to aprepitant 125 mg + ondansetron IV 
  4 months to <12 years of age: Aprepitant 3.0 mg/kg PO 
Days 2 to 3: Equivalent to aprepitant 80 mg + ondansetron IV 
  4 months to <12 years of age: Aprepitant 2.0 mg/kg PO 
Part V (6 months to <12 years) 
Day 1: Fosaprepitant 3.0 mg/kg IV + ondansetron IV 
The 6, 7, 9, and 13 time point plasma profiles were utilized. The 6-point sampling schedule was to be 
utilized to evaluate the PK of IV dexamethasone in patients birth to one year of age. The 7-point 
sampling schedule was to be utilized to evaluate the PK of oral aprepitant in patients birth to one year 
of age. The 9-point sampling schedule included 9 draw times over 72 hours and was utilized to 
evaluate the PK of oral aprepitant in Parts II and IV. For Parts I and V, a 13-point sampling schedule 
included 13 draw times over 72 hours and was utilized to evaluate the PK of both aprepitant and 
fosaprepitant.

Validated bioanalysis methods were used for determination of aprepitant and fosaprepitant (only Part I 
and part V) and pertinent pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g. AUC0-∞, AUC0-24hr, Cmax, Tmax, CL/F, 
t1/2 and C24hr) were calculated based on non-compartmental analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in Table 3 for 12 to 17 year old patients receiving the 3 
day regimen (fosaprepitant 115 mg IV on day 1 followed by aprepitant 80 mg PO on day 2 and day 3).

Study 029 
A Phase IIb, Partially-Blinded, Randomized, Active Comparator-Controlled Study to Evaluate the 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics, Safety, and Tolerability of Fosaprepitant in Pediatric Patients for 
the Prevention of Chemotherapy- Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) Associated with Emetogenic 
Chemotherapy 
The study design, per Amendment 01 and the revised study design, implemented with Amendment 04, 
are described below.

Figure 3: Amendment 01 Study Schematic  
Amendment 01 was designed as a partially-blinded, randomized, parallel-group, doseranging study 
designed to assess the PK, PD, safety and tolerability of aprepitant after administration of a single dose 
of fosaprepitant concomitant with IV ondansetron with or without dexamethasone. The study planned 
to enroll 256 pediatric cancer subjects from birth to 17 years old into 1 of 4 treatment groups; 
however, subjects <2 years of age were not permitted to enroll until PK and safety data became 
available from the older age cohorts. 
Figure 4: Amendment 04 Study Schematic 
Amendment 04 added an open-label, single treatment arm designed to assess the PK, PD, safety and 
tolerability of aprepitant in subjects <12 years old after administration of a single 5 mg/kg dose of 
fosaprepitant with concomitant IV ondansetron with or without dexamethasone. In addition to the 166 
subjects already enrolled, the revised study planned to enroll approximately 60 subjects from birth to 
<12 years old.

All treatment regimens were administered concomitantly with ondansetron, with or without 
dexamethasone at the discretion of the investigator. The fosaprepitant dosing regimens were designed 
to achieve aprepitant PK exposures (AUC) similar to those in adults. For subjects <12 years old, the 
doses were 3 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg, and 0.4 mg/kg. For subjects 12 to 17 years old, the doses were 150 
mg, 60 mg, and 20 mg. Subjects in the control regimen received placebo for fosaprepitant. 
Among subjects randomized/allocated to the fosaprepitant Dose 1 treatment group, plasma 
concentrations were available for a total of 34 subjects who received a single IV dose of fosaprepitant 
(150 mg for 12 to 17 year olds and 3 mg/kg for 2 to <12 year olds). Pharmacokinetic parameter 
values for each of the age groups (AUC0-24, AUC0-inf, Cmax, Tmax, C24, CL/F and t1/2) for this dose 
group across all age groups are summarised in Table 6.

Table 6: Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters with Descriptive Statistics for Aprepitant 
Following Administration of 150 mg Single Dose IV Fosaprepitant Regimen in Subjects Aged 
12 to 17 Years and 3 mg/kg (up to 150 mg) in Pediatric Subjects 2 to <12 Years Old (LOQ 
Values – 10.0 ng/mL) 
Exposures in adolescent subjects receiving 150 mg closely matched the exposures observed in adults 
while pediatric subjects 2 to <12 years old, all together, had exposures less than those observed 
adults. Thus a higher dose of 5 mg/kg (Dose 4) was tested in subjects 0.5 to < 12 years old. 
Among subjects randomized to fosaprepitant Dose 4 treatment group, plasma concentrations were 
available for a total of 72 subjects who received a single IV dose of fosaprepitant (5 mg/kg up to 150 
mg for birth to <12 year olds). Pharmacokinetic parameter values for each of the age groups (AUC0-
24, AUC0-inf, Cmax, Tmax, C24, C48, CL/F, and t1/2) for this dose group across all age groups are 
summarized below.

Study 044 
A Phase III, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial to Study the Efficacy and Safety of MK-
0517/Fosaprepitant and Ondansetron Versus Ondansetron for the Prevention of Chemotherapy-
Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) in Pediatric Subjects Receiving Emetogenic Chemotherapy 
The main objectives of this study were assessed during a single chemotherapy cycle (Cycle 1), where 
150 mg fosaprepitant as a single-dose IV administration in subjects 12 – 17 years old and 5 mg/kg (up 
to 150 mg) in subjects 2 to <12 were administered in a double-blind manner. Upon completion of 
Cycle 1, eligible subjects were invited to participate in an open-label fosaprepitant treatment period for 
up to 5 more cycles of chemotherapy. 
A study schematic is presented in Figure 5.

A decision was made to terminate enrolment in the clinical trial early as the Sponsor determined, in 
consultation with relevant regulatory authorities, that data from this study were not necessary to 
support a marketing application for use in paediatric patients. 
A total of 55 paediatric subjects aged 2 to 17 years old who received fosaprepitant had evaluable 
aprepitant plasma concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g. AUC0-24hr, Cmax, C24hr and 
Tmax) after single-dose IV administration of 150 mg fosaprepitant in subjects 12 to 17 years old and 
of 5 mg/kg (up to 150 mg) fosaprepitant in subjects 2 to <12 years old were evaluated with a non-
compartmental analysis (NCA) for each age cohort.

In general, the dosing regimens across each of the age cohorts resulted in similar exposures. The 
observed exposure data in adolescents and pediatric subjects are consistent with those data observed 
in Protocol 029 for subjects administered with the same dose. Because of early termination of 
enrollment, the total number of randomized and evaluable subjects was substantially less than 
planned; therefore, these additional PK data were not included in the population PK model. 
Population pharmacokinetics 
The PK of aprepitant was evaluated in paediatric patients by a population modelling approach. 
Concentration-time data from four studies (Protocols 029, 097, 134, and 148) with moderately dense 
to dense PK sampling were combined to compile an analysis PK dataset following doses of aprepitant 
and fosaprepitant. The current population PK model (04LVBW) supporting this application is an update 
to the model previously submitted for 3-day oral pediatric regimens with the addition of plasma 
concentration data from 169 pediatric subjects in Protocol 029 to provide dosing recommendations for 
1-day and 3-day fosaprepitant regimens. This final analysis dataset includes additional PK, dosing and 
demographic data from 22 patients 6 months to <2 years, 46 patients 2 years to <6 years, 64 patients 
6 years to <12 years and 37 patients 12 to 17 years, all receiving a single IV dose of fosaprepitant. 
The original analysis (02Y0Y0) included a total of 1326 measurable concentrations from 147 pediatric 
patients aged 6 months to 19 years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/219267/2018  
Page 27/93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The aims of the current PopPK analysis were to: 
  Update the existing population PK model of aprepitant after aprepitant/fosaprepitant 
administration using final clinical data from studies P097, P134, P148 and P029 and assess the 
impact of key covariates (including demographics, oral and IV formulations) in CINV / PONV 
patients; 
 
Evaluate / validate the updated population PK model to insure its accuracy, precision and 
robustness; 
 
Perform a model-based simulations and determine the appropriate single-(1) day and 3-day 
dosing regimens of fosaprepitant by assessing PK exposure of aprepitant in targeted age 
groups of pediatric patients (i.e., <2 years old, 2 to <6 years old, 6 to <12 years old, 12 to 
<18 years old). 
Modeling followed a conventional approach starting with structural model development followed by 
evaluation of covariates and model qualification. Simulations of the therapeutic dosing regimen were 
based on the final model. 
All PK data were evaluated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling implemented in NONMEN v7.3 with 
first order conditional estimation (FOCE). 
The previous structural population PK model4 included an allometric component accounting for body 
size (i.e., parameters were scaled to WT/70 using a power of 0.75 for clearances and a power of 1 for 
volumes). However, the effects of WT on all parameters were also fitted on the pediatric data and 
compared with the theoretical values. 
The previous structural model also included the effect of age (i.e., post-natal age) on CYP3A4-
mediated clearance. The age effect was re-evaluated in the current analysis and thus not included in 
the structural model. 
In NONMEM control files, the doses of fosaprepitant were scaled using a conversion factor of 534.44 / 
614.4 assuming that fosaprepitant with molecular weight of 614.4 g/mol, is rapidly converted to the 
active drug, aprepitant (molecular weight of 534.44 g/mol). 
Conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant in children 
The topic of conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant in children with comparison to that in adults was 
addressed and resolved under the scope of Article 46 of Regulation 1901/2006, procedure number 
EMEA/H/C/743/P46/024.1.  
Following IV infusions of fosaprepitant in paediatric patients from 6 months to 12 years (3 mg/kg) and 
adolescents 12 through 17 years of age (150 mg), fosaprepitant is rapidly converted to aprepitant, 
typically within 30 minutes from the end of the infusion and consistent with that observed in adults 
(150 mg). Some (9/23) fosaprepitant plasma concentration values were observed for a longer duration 
(i.e., beyond 30 minutes after the end of the infusion time) in patients 6 months to <12 years (Figures 
4, 5, 6 and 7). After the 2.25-hour PK sampling time point, all fosaprepitant plasma concentrations in 
paediatric patients 6 months to <12 years old were reported as below the limit of quantitation (BLQ). 
Whilst these findings could be suggestive of a slower conversion to aprepitant in younger children, 
given the difference in length of infusion duration for fosaprepitant and the significant variability in the 
fosaprepitant plasma concentrations observed among the patients 6 months to <12 years of age, it is 
unlikely that these observations are clinically relevant and therefore, not expected to influence the 
current (2017) population PK model or the underlying assumptions. Additionally, conversion of 
fosaprepitant to aprepitant involves hydrolysis of the phosphoramide moiety by phosphatases in a 
Assessment report  
EMA/219267/2018

variety of mammalian tissues and is unlikely to differ significantly between adult and paediatric 
subpopulations. Furthermore, the variability in time to non-quantifiable concentrations of fosaprepitant 
did not impact the Tmax of aprepitant in the paediatric subjects, with measurable aprepitant 
concentrations appearing rapidly, from the first samples collected; therefore, the assumption of 
instantaneous conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant appears to be conserved across adult and 
paediatric populations.

Covariates and PK parameters 
The relationships between covariates and PK parameters were explored graphically to obtain 
information of covariates likely to affect the PK of aprepitant. Scatter matrix plots presenting the 
relationships between the inter-individual variability of PK parameters and the continuous variables 
included LOESS lines, Pearson correlation coefficients, and the corresponding p-value for each 
relationship. Box plots were used to describe the relationship for categorical covariates. 
The following covariates were firstly tested: 
 
 
Intrinsic factors: age, sex, race 
Extrinsic factors: aprepitant formulations (capsule and suspension), dose levels, 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid level (original and reduced) 
Evaluation of fosaprepitant formulation on systemic PK parameters was also performed to detect 
potential effect of ethylenediaminetraacetic acid (EDTA) in fosaprepitant, which was at reduced level 
for fosaprepitant in Study P029 and original level for fosaprepitant in Study P134. 
The covariates with relevant trends were formally evaluated within the population PK model using a full 
model approach. Full model parameter estimates and 95% confidence interval (CIs) were derived with 
the standard error generated with NONMEM ($COV). Statistically significant covariates were retained in 
the reduced final model if the 95%CI excluded the null value relative to the reference population. 
Model validation and qualification of population PK models for fosaprepitant/aprepitant was based on 
numerical criteria (eg. parameter precision and number of significant digits of the final estimate) and 
diagnostic plots (eg. conditional weighted residuals vs time after dose) common to pharmacometric 
model development. Internal model validation with the final model was conducted by performing visual 
predictive check (VPC). 
Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact BLQ concentration on the model output. The 
final population PK model was re-run using M3 approach described by Beal10 and the estimated typical

values and VPC plots were compared with those derived with the final model, which excluded all BLQ 
concentrations. 
The final population PK model of aprepitant/fosaprepitant in pediatric population was used to simulate 
the PK of aprepitant to support single dose of fosaprepitant and 3-day dosing regimens fosaprepitant 
and aprepitant in CINV/PONC pediatric patients. The simulation data set included demographic data 
from studies P097, P134, P148 and P029. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed in NONMEM ($SIM) 
based on the dosing regimens. Simulations were generated using a total of 100 replicates. Individual 
PK parameters (Cmax, concentration at 24 h [C24], concentration at 48 h [C48], and concentration at 
72 h [C72]) were computed using NCA based on rich concentration profiles of aprepitant. Partial areas 
under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours post-dose (AUC0-24h) and AUCinf were 
computed using the linear trapezoidal rule. 
Modeling results 
Dosing history and demographic data provided for a total of 316 paediatric subjects, administrated by 
aprepitant/fosaprepitant for the prevention of CINV/PONC were included in the population PK analysis.

A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption, lag-time and relative 
bioavailability was used as the structural model of aprepitant. The schematic of this structural 
population PK model is shown below:

in Pediatric Population 
The concentration data were analyzed on the log10 scale, which allowed description of assay error with 
a single-parameter log-normal distribution. 
The base population PK model included the following covariate effects: 
 
 
effect of WT on clearance (CL and Q) normalized to 70 kg to a power of 0.75: ×(Weight/70)0.75 
effect of WT on volumes (V2 and V3) normalized to 70 kg: ×(Weight/70) 
Typical values of CL and V2 of aprepitant in CINV / PONV patients computed from the base structural 
model were 5.25 L/h and 46.3 L, respectively. The relative standard error (RSE) for  CL and V2 were 
4.4% and 12.9%, respectively. The capsule formulation was associated to a lag time of absorption 
(Tlag) of 0.95 h. The relative bioavailability for oral absorption (F1) of aprepitant was 83.9%. All model 
parameters were estimated with a RSE <40%. 
Exploratory analyses were first performed to visually assess the effect of key covariates (i.e., age, sex, 
race, reduced vs. original EDTA content, formulation, study, WT, dose levels) on PK parameters of 
aprepitant derived with the structural model. 
According to scatter matrix plot, negative trend was observed between individual random effect of V2 
and baseline age which was statistically significant (p=0.0015) and similar trend was observed using 
categorical age group based on boxplot. This covariate was added to the structural model (run015) 
using multiplicative function (i.e., V2 = tvV2 × (Age/8)Age_V). 
According to the covariate box plot of the structural model (run015) a negative trend also was 
observed between Ka and formulation. Thus, the formulation effect was induced in the model using 
exponential function (i.e., Ka = tvKa × exp(Form_Ka)), with one specific value for each suspension 
formulation (i.e., one for Study P134 and another for Study P148). 
Assessment report  
EMA/219267/2018  
Page 35/93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A small negative trend was observed between individual random effect of CL and total dose. Since in 
the previous analysis the inclusion of dose on CL significantly improved the overall model fit, this effect 
was re-evaluated with the current dataset using a power function (i.e., CL = tvCL × (Dose/80)Dose_CL). 
After including the above covariates (i.e., age on V2, formulation on Ka and dose on CL), exponents of 
WT/70 on the PK parameters were fitted with the current dataset with same fitted value for clearances 
(i.e., CL and Q) and same fitted value for volumes (i.e., V2 and V3). The fitted exponents were almost 
the same as the fixed exponents (i.e., 0.79 for clearances and 1.03 for volumes) and the estimation of 
WT effects does not significantly improved the overall model fit (i.e., OFV decreasing of -0.5). Thus the 
model with fixed exponents was kept for the next step. 
The inclusion of EDTA on CL significantly decreased the OFV by 23.51 (p<0.001) and at the second 
step EDTA on V3 decreased the OFV by 15.16 (p<0.001). No covariate was significant at the 3rd step 
and no covariate was removed in the backward elimination with p<0.001. However, based on the 
95%CI derived for the effects of EDTA on CL and V3, only the effect of reduced EDTA on CL was 
statistically significant and thus was retained in the final model. 
The impact of BLQ concentrations on the estimation of the PK parameters of aprepitant was evaluated 
using the M3 method. VPC plots for the model estimated with and without considering the BLQ 
concentrations are shown in Figure 11.

2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
The correlation of plasma aprepitant concentrations with the binding of aprepitant to brain NK1 
receptors was assessed in two Phase I studies (Protocol 027) and (Protocol 045) in healthy young 
men. Data from both studies were combined in an exploratory post-hoc analysis, which revealed that 
the relationship between plasma aprepitant concentration and NK1 receptor occupancy was well 
correlated with a curve described by the Hill equation (see figure below). Based on this curve, 
aprepitant plasma concentrations of ~10 ng/mL and ~100 ng/mL are associated with brain NK1 
receptor occupancies of ~50 and 90%, respectively.

Striatal NK1 Receptors in Adults 
Extrapolation 
The MAA for a paediatric indication of fosaprepitant is based on extrapolation of data from an adult 
population treated with fosaprepitant (1-day regimen) and a paediatric population treated with 
aprepitant (3-day regimen).  
The steps taken to determine an appropriate aprepitant dose in a paediatric population was assessed 
within procedure EMEA/H/C/527/X/49/G. Aprepitant dose selection in the paediatric population was 
based on an approach to match the drug exposure to those previously demonstrated to be safe and 
efficacious in adults. In adults, plasma exposures of the approved aprepitant dosing regimen of 125 
mg aprepitant on Day 1 followed by 80 mg aprepitant on Days 2 to 3 (125/80/80 mg regimen) result 
in CNS NK1 receptor occupancy >95% (see figure above). Higher doses were not associated with 
greater efficacy, whereas doses associated with CNS NK1 receptor occupancy <80 to 85% were 
submaximally efficacious. Pharmacokinetic data from aprepitant study P097, P134 as well as PK data 
from a separate PONV-study (P148) were used to develop a population PK-model for aprepitant which 
Assessment report  
EMA/219267/2018  
Page 40/93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was used to conduct dose adjustments for subjects 6 months to <12 years of age that would 
approximate PK parameters associated with safe and efficacious exposures in adults. The efficacy and 
safety of this aprepitant dose regimen was further evaluated within Protocol 134 (Part IV) as well as 
Protocol 208. 
The Applicant has in a previous application presented an analysis where the upper part of the 
established PKPD curve on receptor occupancy vs. concentration is super-imposed with the observed 
trough concentration ranges in adults at different dosing regimens.

Figure 14: Aprepitant Trough Plasma Concentration (ng/mL) 
However, based on simulated data regarding aprepitant dosing, the group 6-<12 years had the lowest 
mean AUC among the paediatric groups. Cmin levels were lower than in adults in all paediatric patients 
< 12 years, while Cmin levels in adolescents were relatively similar as in adult cancer patients. It was 
noted that trough concentrations of around 100-150 ng/ml, obtained at the proposed doses for 
children < 12 years, were between a regimen that produced sub-maximal efficiency in CINV in adults 
in early studies (40 mg/25 mg) and regimens shown to be maximally effective in CINV in adults 
(125/80/80 mg and 375/259 mg). From pharmacokinetic data it was therefore not evident that 
paediatric patients would obtain >95% receptor occupancy and maximum efficacy. However, since the 
Assessment report  
EMA/219267/2018  
Page 41/93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proposed dose regimen led to clinically relevant response rates in all age groups, it was considered 
acceptable for the aprepitant paediatric indication.  
Thus, with a rapid and high conversion rate to aprepitant after intravenous fosaprepitant 
administration, the expected NK1 receptor occupancy would be similar in a paediatric aprepitant or 
fosaprepitant treated population. Even without exactly the same levels of aprepitant Cmin levels in an 
adult and paediatric population, the effect size is determined clinically relevant in the paediatric 
population.  
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Fosapripetant is a prodrug which is converted rapidly in the body to apripetant following IV injection. 
Apripetant in its turn works as an antagonist on NK1-receptors thereby reducing nausea and vomiting 
following administration of highly and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (abbreviated HEC 
and MEC, respectively). 
Intravenous fosaprepitant is already approved as a one day (single dose) regimen for treatment of 
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) as well as for the prevention of postoperative 
nausea and vomiting (PONV) in adults. The current recommended dose is 150 mg as a 20 min to 30 
min infusion. It should be coadminstered with p.o. corticosteroids and 5-HT3 antagonist. 
Oral aprepitant (Emend) is approved for use in children from 6 months to 18 years of age as a 3 day 
regimen for the treatment of prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) when 
used in combination with other antiemetic agents. 
In this application the MAH seeks to bridge the efficacy of the 3-day oral aprepitant dose in children to 
a 3-day iv fosaprepitant dose in the same age categories. The applicant also seeks to extrapolate the 
efficacy of 1-day fosaprepitant dose in adults to a 1-day dose in children. Therefore clinical 
pharmacology data need to support the extension of the approved adult one day IV fosaprepitant 
regimen to children from 6 months of age to 17 years of age and the extension of the 3 day PO 
aprepitant regimen to a 3 day IV or PO fosaprepitant or aprepitant regimen bassed on similarity in 
exposure regardless of IV or PO adminiatration. 
The PK of aprepitant in children following IV administration of fosaprepitant has been studied. The 
complexity due to different dosing regimens for different age groups and studies makes interpretation 
of observed PK data and exposure metrics difficult. Population PK modeling is therefore necessary in 
order to integrate the complete body of data and draw conclusions regarding the adequacy of the 
proposed dosing regimens.  
A thorough population PK analysis using the data from studies Protocols 029, 097, 134, and 148 was 
carried out by the applicant and the methods used were appropriate. The current analysis was based 
on a previous popPK model that was used to support the extension of the indication for Emend to 
children down to 6 months of age (see European Public Assessment Report for Emend 
EMEA/H/C/527/X/0049/G). The model was adequate to describe the PK data in the entire paediatric 
population and is considered qualified for simulation of the proposed dosing regimens in children from 
2 years to 18 years of age. Conclusion regarding the influence of body weight on the drug disposition 
is supported. 
The PopPK model was sufficient for the purpose of describing the exposure in the pediatric population 
at hand (6 months to 18 years of age). The current model does not take maturation of eliminating 
systems into account; but due to the lack of a maturation function on clearance, the difference in 
exposure comparing models with and without maturation function does not translate to large 
Assessment report  
EMA/219267/2018  
Page 42/93 
 
 
 
 
 
differences in receptor occupancy and expected efficacy. Similarly, although the model does not take 
account to the PK data that were below the lower limit of quantification, this is not expected to 
translate into large differences in receptor occupancy and clinical efficacy.  
Aprepitant is likely metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. These enzymes are known to mature 
during at least the first year after birth. The Applicant provided simulations of exposure using a model 
where the previous maturation function is included. The impact on different exposure metrics, eg. 
Cmax, C24, C48, C72, AUC, was illustrated using simulations and thoroughly discussed. The applicant 
was asked to illustrate the impact of maturation on secondary PK parameters (AUC, Cmax, half-life 
and Cmin) using the previously postulated maturation function for children of various age groups with 
a special focus on the children between 6 months and 2 years. 
In order to further address this issue and illustrate the impact of maturation on secondary PK 
parameters (AUC, Cmax, half-life and Cmin), the Applicant has performed additional assessments by 
applying three different maturation functions in the current structural base PK model. Based upon 
model diagnostics, a maturation function, describing the ontogeny of CYP3A4, was not included in the 
current (2017) population PK model for aprepitant, the addition of a maturation function(s) did not 
further improve model predictive performance. Taken together, the approach adopted in the 2017 
model development is reasonably robust across assumptions and available data and continues to 
support the dosing recommendations and resultant estimates of aprepitant exposure metrics provided 
in the original application. The discussion and extended analysis provided supports the dosing of 
Ivemend in children above 6 months of age. The current model is considered to be sufficient for 
describing the observed data although the impact of organ maturation is not included. 
The Applicant also presented data on conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant in children and also 
discussed the consequences of a potential difference in the rate of conversion comparing adults and 
children. It is agreed that the conversion is likely to be sufficiently rapid in children. 
Since the bioavailability of aprepitant is high the assumption that IV and PO administration can be 
used interchangeably can be supported. 
Fosaprepitant is recommended to be administered as an IV infusion on Day 1. For patients receiving 
multi-day chemotherapy, administration should continue on Day 2 and Day3. It is also recommended 
that identical doses of IV fosaprepitant or PO aprepitant can be administered interchangeably on Day 2 
and Day3. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Modelling and simulation of paediatric pharmacokinetic (PK) data were used to identify fosaprepitant 
dosing regimens that would match aprepitant exposures previously demonstrated to be efficacious in 
adults and children.  
Taken together, the presented data supports the 3-day regimen extrapolation from aprepitant to 
fosaprepitant in a paediatric population and the 1-day regimen extrapolation of fosaprepitant efficacy 
from adults to a paediatric population.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
Two supportive studies were referenced for the extrapolation of the 1-day dosing regimen (Protocol 
017L1 and Protocol 031). 
Both trials were worldwide, multi-center, Phase III, randomized, double blind trials designed to assess 
the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a single 150 mg IV fosaprepitant dose in combination with 
ondansetron and dexamethasone for the prevention of CINV in adult subjects naïve to HEC and MEC 
chemotherapy. 
Three studies were referenced (one pivotal study (Protocol 208) and two supportive Phase I studies 
(Protocols 097 and 134)) for the bridging of the paediatric 3-day regimen from aprepitant to 
fosaprepitant. 
P208 was a randomized, double blind, Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the 3-day 
oral aprepitant regimen when administered concomitantly with ondansetron, with or without 
dexamethasone, in paediatric subjects from 6 months to 17 years of age. The aprepitant dose chosen 
for Protocol 208 was supported by 2 Phase I studies (P097 and P134).

P017L1: Randomized, Double-Blind, Active-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study for the Prevention of 
Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) Associated with Cisplatin Chemotherapy. 
Protocol 017L1 was the pivotal non-inferiority study that compared a single dose IV (SDIV) 
fosaprepitant regimen to the approved 3-day oral aprepitant regimen in adult subjects receiving initial 
treatment with a cisplatin-based HEC.  
Methods 
Based on observed plasma aprepitant levels obtained on Days 2-4 following a single 15 or 30 minute 
infusion of fosaprepitant, CNS NK1 receptor occupancy levels were predicted to remain greater than 
90% through at least Day 3 following a single 150 mg IV fosaprepitant dimeglumine dose administered 
over 20-30 minutes, and greater than or equal to approximately 80% through at least Day 4. Protocol 
017L1 was, therefore, designed to test the hypothesis that receptor occupancy levels of this degree 
would be sufficient to confer similar (i.e., non-inferior) clinical efficacy compared to the approved 3-
day oral regimen. Study participants were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

Methods 
The study randomized 1015 subjects in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a single dose of 150 mg IV 
fosaprepitant or placebo on Day 1 prior to the start of an initial cycle of MEC as add-on to concomitant 
oral administration of the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron, and the corticosteroid dexamethasone on 
Day 1; however, only subjects in the control regimen were to receive ondansetron on Days 2 and 3, 
subjects in the fosaprepitant regimen received placebo for ondansetron.  
Outcomes/endpoints  
Primary outcome measures: Complete response (CR) defined as no vomiting*, no use of rescue in the 
delayed phase (25 to 120 hours after first dose of MEC).   
Secondary outcome measure: CR overall (0 – 120 hours), CR acute (0-24 hours), no vomiting overall 
(0-120 hours) 
*vomiting: no emetic episode or dry heaves/retching. 
Complete Response in the delayed phase was selected for evaluation of the primary efficacy endpoint 
based on guidance from regulatory agencies.

Conducted Under In-House Blinding Conditions, to Examine the Efficacy and Safety of Aprepitant for 
the Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) in Paediatric Patients. 
Methods 
Study P208 included patients 6 months-17 years of age with a documented malignancy and life 
expectancy of ≥3 months who were scheduled to receive chemotherapeutic agent(s) associated with 
moderate, high risk or very high risk of emetogenicity, or a chemotherapy regimen not previously 
tolerated due to vomiting, for which ondansetron treatment should be planned. Patients scheduled for 
stem cell rescue therapy in conjunction with study related course(s) of emetogenic chemotherapy were 
excluded, as were patients who had received or would receive radiation therapy to the abdomen or 
pelvis in the week prior to Treatment Day 1 and/or during the course of the study. Patients with 
symptomatic CNS malignancy causing nausea or vomiting were also excluded. Excluded medications 
were: CYP3A4 inducers, substrates and inhibitors, anti-emetics, and products with QT prolongation, 
among others.

Objectives 
Primary objective: To compare the three-day oral aprepitant regimen (aprepitant plus ondansetron), 
to ondansetron alone. 
Blinding 
Cycle 1 of this study was conducted as a double-blind study under in-house blinding conditions. Cycles 
2-6 were conducted as an open-label study. 
Randomization 
Subjects who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized centrally and assigned to 
one of the two treatment regimens via the IVRS. At the time of randomization via IVRS, subjects were 
stratified by age on Day 1 of Cycle 1 into the appropriate age cohort (6 months to < 2 years; 2 to < 6 
years; 6 to <12 years; or 12 to 17 years).  
Patients were further stratified based on planned use of a chemotherapy agent associated with a Very 
High Risk of emetogenicity in Cycle 1 (Yes or No) and planned use of dexamethasone as an antiemetic 
in Cycle 1 (Yes or No).

Statistical Methods 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population which consists of all patients (in the group they were) randomized 
and who received study drug served as the primary population for the analysis of efficacy data in this 
study. A supportive analysis was performed for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints using the 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) population. The FAS population is a subset of all randomized patients including 
all patients who have received chemotherapy, received a dose of study drug and have at least one 
post-treatment efficacy assessment.  
The primary efficacy analysis compared the aprepitant regimen to the control regimen with respect to 
the proportion of patients reporting Complete Response in the 25 to 120 hours (delayed phase) 
following initiation of emetogenic chemotherapy.  
The secondary efficacy analyses will compare the aprepitant regimen to the control regimen with 
respect to the proportion of patients reporting Complete Response (acute and overall) and the 
proportion of patients reporting No Vomiting overall. 
The treatment comparisons for Complete Response and No Vomiting was made using the Cochran-
Mantel-Haenzel (CMH) test stratified by age (<2 years, 2 to 17 years), use of dexamethasone as an 
antiemetic in Cycle 1 (yes, no), and receipt of very high risk emetogenic chemotherapy agent in Cycle 
1 (yes, no). The superiority hypotheses was evaluated by comparing the 1-tailed p-value to 0.025 and 
significance declared if the p-value was ≤0.025. 
Baseline data 
More male than female patients were enrolled, 54 vs. 46%. With regard to age group, the youngest 
age group (6 month – 2 year) represented nearly 12% of study participants while the other three age 
groups (2-6 year; 6-12 year; 12-17 year) represented approximately 30% each.   
Numbers analysed 
In total 307 subjects were randomised 1:1 to aprepitant or control regimen. 5 patients did not receive 
study medication and were excluded from the ITT population. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) patient population included all randomized patients who (1) received 
chemotherapy, (2) received at least one dose of study medication, and (3) had at least one post-
treatment efficacy assessment. The five subjects excluded from the ITT population were also excluded 
from the FAS. An additional subject was excluded from the FAS population because this subject did not 
complete the post-treatment efficacy assessment; this subject was considered as having an 
unfavourable response in the ITT analysis. 
A total of 63 subjects were excluded from the PP population due to protocol violations.

Primary objective: To estimate PK of aprepitant in patients, birth to 17 years of age, scheduled for 
MEC or HEC or chemotherapy not previously tolerated due to CINV, and to evaluate safety and 
tolerability of aprepitant. 
Efficacy was an exploratory objective. 
Conduct of the study 
All enrolled patients were subjects to HEC or MEC. Patients in Part III could continue to Part IV and 
Part V but patients could also enrol in Part IV and V without participating in previous Part.

Baseline data 
 With regard to type of malignancy, the variation of diagnoses across study steps and parts was quite 
wide, reflecting the rareness of the conditions and the small number of patients included in each part. 
The small numbers and nonrandomised nature of the study precludes any firm conclusions with regard 
to efficacy and safety based on comparisons across regimens. The possibility of using Part III as 
“control” is limited due to the different HEC/MEC chemotherapy, among other heterogeneities across 
study parts.  
Numbers analysed 
A total of 91 paediatric patients 6 months to 17 years old were enrolled across 5 parts of the study.

The proportion of patients (aged 6 months to <12 years) experiencing vomiting in the acute phase was 
lower for the single-dose 80 mg-equivalent PO regimen compared with the single-dose 125 mg–
equivalent PO regimen. These results are contra-intuitive, but likely a reflection of the small sample 
size, heterogeneity of the patient population and non-randomised nature of the study. 
The proportions achieving complete response in the different phases are similar in study P134 and 
study P208 (pivotal for the application regarding aprepitant use in children 6 months to 17 years) 
regarding age groups 6 months to < 2 years and 2 years to <6 years whereas the proportion is higher 
in the 6 years to <12 years age group.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This extension of indication is based on a number of studies, all which have previously been submitted 
and assessed within other procedures, and modelling and simulations, the applicant seeks to bridge 
the efficacy of the 3-day oral aprepitant dose in children to a 3-day iv fosaprepitant dose in the same 
age categories. The applicant also seeks to extrapolate the efficacy of 1-day fosaprepitant dose in 
adults to a 1-day dose in children. SmPC is also aligned with SmPC for aprepitant (removal of “cisplatin 
based cancer chemotherapy” from indication. 
Two studies are included to support the applied 1-day dose regimen, study P017L1 and study P031. 
Three studies are included to support the applied 3-day dose regimen, study P208, study P097 and 
study P134. 
There is support for fosaprepitant as a single iv dose of 150 mg in adults and the applicant does not 
invoke (in this MAA) any new efficacy data regarding the 1-day fosaprepitant regimen in children. 
Hence, if the 1-day regimen in adults is pharmacologically possible to extrapolate to a paediatric 
population, the efficacy endpoints would be supported. 
The applicant includes three studies in this MAA to support the 3-day dose regimen, study P208, study 
P097 and study P134. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study P017L1 was designed as a non-inferiority study to compare one single dose of fosaprepitant 150 
mg iv to a 3 day regimen of aprepitant in adults. Complete response in the overall phase was used as 
primary efficacy measure. The study has previously been assessed within procedures 
EMEA/H/C/743/X/006 and EMEA/H/C/743/II/07 and was found supportive for the 1 day fosaprepitant 
regimen. 
Study P031 was designed to explore the add-on efficacy of a single iv dose of 150 mg fosaprepitant for 
prevention of CINV in adults treated with MEC. Complete response in the delayed phase (25-120 hours 
Assessment report  
EMA/219267/2018  
Page 62/93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
after first dose MEC) was primary endpoint. The study has previously been assessed within procedure 
EMEA/H/C/0007/43/II/031 and was found to confirm prior findings conducted with (fos)aprepitant: 
fosaprepitant has a moderate add-on effect on CINV to a background of steroids and a 5-HT3-
antagonist. 
Study P208 investigated the efficacy of a 3-day aprepitant regimen compared to ondansetron alone in 
a paediatric population (6 months to 17 years old). Primary endpoint was complete response in the 
delayed phase (25-125 hours after first dose of chemotherapy). The study has previously been 
assessed within procedure EMEA/H/C/527/X/49/G and efficacy data was found supportive to the 3-day 
aprepitant regimen. Overall, complete response in the delayed phase doubled in the aprepitant group 
compared to the control group. 
Study P097 was a smaller study with primary objectives of safety while efficacy endpoints were 
secondary or exploratory. The study compared standard therapy with aprepitant triple therapy and was 
assessed in the same procedure X/49/G as P208. Study P097 was assessed as supportive to study 
P208 for efficacy. 
Study P134 was also small and thus precludes any firm conclusions based on comparison between 
different study groups, with regard to efficacy endpoints. However, weighted together with study P097, 
study P134 is considered supportive to the efficacy endpoints of study P208. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The clinical aetiology, pathophysiology and manifestation of CINV do not differ between a paediatric 
and adult population, and age is no covariate for CINV severity. 
The company extrapolated the efficacy of the proposed paediatric 1-day fosaprepitant regimen from 
that demonstrated in the adult fosaprepitant program. The efficacy of the proposed paediatric 3-day 
fosaprepitant regimen was bridged from that demonstrated in paediatric subjects receiving the 3-day 
oral aprepitant regimen. As efficacy is extrapolated and bridged from previously completed studies, 
pivotal studies designed to demonstrate the efficacy of fosaprepitant in children were not performed. 
As such, efficacy data from the adult fosaprepitant program and the paediatric aprepitant program are 
presented. 
The recommended dose regimen of IVEMEND, to be administered with a 5-HT3 antagonist, with or 
without a corticosteroid, for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with administration of 
single or multi-day chemotherapy regimens of Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy (HEC) or Moderately 
Emetogenic Chemotherapy (MEC), was 115 mg on day 1 to be followed by 80 mg iv or orally (EMEND 
capsules) on days 2 and 3 for patients above 12 years old and 3 mg/kg on day 1 to be followed by 2 
mg/kg either iv or orally on days 2 and 3 for patients above 6 months and less than 12 years of age 
for paediatric patients receiving single or multi-day regimens of HEC or MEC.   
For paediatric patients receiving single day HEC or MEC, IVEMEND may be administered as an 
intravenous infusion through a central venous catheter on Day 1 as 150 mg iv for patients 12 years 
and older, 4 mg/kg for patients 2 to less than 12 years and 5 mg/kg for patients 6 months to less than 
2 years and not less than 6 kg. The safety and efficacy of IVEMEND in infants below 6 months of age 
have not been established. No data are available. 
It is recommended that instead of iv fosaprepitant on Day 2 and 3 in the 3-day fosaprepitant regimen, 
it should be possible to use oral aprepitant (equal dose). However a change between iv fosaprepitant 
and oral aprepitant is not suggested for Day 1 in the 3-day fosaprepitant regimen. Based on routine 
practices of chemotherapy administration in children, the combination aprepitant/fosaprepitant 
Assessment report  
EMA/219267/2018  
Page 63/93 
 
 
 
 
 
antiemetic regimen suggested above (oral on Day 1 followed by IV on Days 2 and 3) is not anticipated 
to be used. On Day 1, most paediatric patients receive intravenous chemotherapy in a hospital or 
outpatient setting, where IV anti-emetics, such as fosaprepitant, can be easily administered. This is 
supported by data from both the oral aprepitant and IV fosaprepitant paediatric clinical development 
programs in which relatively few subjects received only oral chemotherapy on Day 1. The proposed 
alternative oral aprepitant dosing on Day 2 and 3 of the 3-day fosaprepitant regimen was added to 
offer flexibility for patients who are receiving 1 or 2 days of IV chemotherapy. The flexibility of using 
oral aprepitant on Days 2 and 3 allows health care providers to prescribe a regimen that would not 
require patients to return to the hospital/outpatient clinic for the sole purpose of receiving an IV dose 
of fosaprepitant. Furthermore, for the minority of patients not receiving IV chemotherapy on Day 1, 
the 3-day oral aprepitant regimen is available and offers additional dosing flexibility. 
Therefore although interchangeability between fosaprepitant and aprepitant in 3-day regimen is 
supported, the clinical use of a combination containing the discussed sequence is not foreseen. 
Emend (oral aprepitant) 80 and 125 mg is indicated for “Prevention nausea and vomiting associated 
with highly and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in adults and adolescents from the age 
of 12.” and the powder for oral suspension is approved for “Prevention of nausea and vomiting 
associated with highly and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in children, toddlers and 
infants from the age of 6 months to less than 12 years.”  
Further, section 4.1 of Ivemend is also aligned with SmPC for aprepitant in terms of removing 
reference to “cisplatin based cancer chemotherapy”. This is acceptable as fosaprepitant is a prodrug of 
aprepitant rapidly converting to it following administration , therefore data available on highly non-
cisplatin based emetogenic chemotherapies with Emend are applicable to Ivemend too. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The applied indication is based on extrapolation and bridging of previously submitted (in other 
procedures) and assessed data. The present assessment is in consistency with previous assessments 
for the supportive studies in the studied populations.  Clinical efficacy in the “Prevention of nausea and 
vomiting associated with highly and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in adults and 
paediatric patients aged 6 months and older” can be derived from these studies. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of fosaprepitant IV administered to paediatric patients 6 months to 17 years of age is 
based on information from studies “Protocol 134”, “Protocol 029” and “Protocol 044” with safety data 
collected from 331 paediatric oncology patients exposed to any dose of fosaprepitant. The applicant 
also refers to supportive data in studies “Protocol 208” and “Protocol 097” (3-day oral aprepitant 
regimen) for safety in paediatric patients. The applicant has also provided results from a search within 
its “Adverse Event Reporting and Review System database” containing reports of serious adverse 
experiences and adverse experiences of special interest from clinical trials, including expanded access 
programs, reports from the medical literature, and all adverse experiences from marketed use that are 
reported to the MAH. The applicant also provide information about a literature search of all published 
clinical literature referencing aprepitant and fosaprepitant, which the applicant reviewed for 
consistency with the safety findings reported in this marketing application. 
Assessment report  
EMA/219267/2018

The applicant states that fosaprepitant is rapidly and completely converted to aprepitant within 30 
minutes of intravenous administration and therefore the safety and tolerability of the currently 
approved 3-day oral aprepitant regimen (study P208, P097 and P134), established in paediatric 
patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy, should support the safety profile of the proposed 3-day 
IV fosaprepitant regimen. 
This application also includes exposure data (study P134) for fosaprepitant following administration as 
part of a 1-day IV regimen (all age groups) and a 3-day IV/oral regimen (115 mg IV fosaprepitant 
given on day 1, followed by 80 mg oral aprepitant on days 2 and 3 in adolescent subjects).

The applicant propose the dose for the 1-day regimen to be 150 mg for adolescents 12 to 17 years, 4 
mg/kg (up to 150 mg) for children 2 to <12 years and 5 mg/kg (up to 150 mg) for 6 month to <2 year 
olds. The proposed dose for the 3-day regimen is 115 mg on Day 1 followed by 80 mg on Days 2 and 3 
for 12 to 17 year olds and 3 mg/kg (up to 115 mg) on Day 1 followed by 2 mg/kg (up to 80 mg) on 
Days 2 and 3 for 6 month to <12 year olds. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 361 unique subjects were randomised in Protocol 029, 044 and 134 (Parts I and V which 
included fosaprepitant to a paediatric population). Of those, 331 received fosaprepitant either in Cycle 
1 and/or optional in Cycles 2 to 6 (Protocol 029 and 044 only).

The applicant pooled supportive safety data for the 1-day regimen from subjects who received 150 mg 
and 5 mg/kg in Protocols 134, 029 and 044 (1-Day supportive pool), see table below. 
The applicant derived the proposed 3-day paediatric IV fosaprepitant regimen through population PK 
model-based analysis and achieved similar exposures (AUC0-24, Cmax, C24hr, C48hr and C72hr) as 
the approved paediatric 3-day oral aprepitant regimen associated with efficacy, safety and tolerability

EMA/219267/2018

in children 6 months to 17 years of age. The applicant states that following administration of a single 3 
mg/kg IV fosaprepitant dose, aprepitant is cleared rapidly in children with negligible C24 values. The 
applicant further states that given low daily through levels and negligible accumulation, administration 
of fosaprepitant for 3 consecutive days is not predicted to result in daily exposures outside the range 
associated with safety following administration of higher fosaprepitant doses (150 mg and 5 mg/kg). 
As such, the safety and tolerability of a 3-day IV fosaprepitant regimen is supported by pooled safety 
data from paediatric subjects receiving a single IV dose of fosaprepitant at or above the highest 
proposed daily doses in the 3-day regimen of 115 mg for adolescents and 3 mg/kg for 6 month to <12 
year olds. Supportive safety data were pooled by the applicant from subjects in Protocols 134, 029 and 
044 who received 3 mg/kg, 5mg/kg and 150 mg as part of 1-day regimens and 115 mg IV on Day 1 as 
part of a 3-day IV/PO regimen (3-Day supportive pool). The applicant notifies that all subjects in the 
1-day supportive pool are also included in the 3-day supportive pool. The 1-day and 3-day supportive 
pool also includes 148 and 208 paediatric patients respectively, who received fosaprepitant 150 mg, 5 
mg/kg, or 3 mg/kg in Cycles 2 to 6 of Protocols 029 and 044.

The applicant also, due to the statement of rapid and complete conversion of fosaprepitant to 
aprepitant, provide safety data of the 3-day oral aprepitant regimen demonstrated in Protocols 097 
and 208 as supportive data for safety of a 3-day fosaprepitant regimen. 
In addition to the studies conducted by the Applicant, a small (n=27), prospective, open label study of 
fosaprepitant in paediatric subjects 6 months to 18 years of age was conducted by Ono Pharmaceutical 
Co., Ltd and used to support approval of fosaprepitant in Japan for the prevention of CINV in this age 
group (Study ONO-7847-03). In this study, subjects 12 to 18 years of age received a single 150 mg 
dose of fosaprepitant; subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received a single 3 mg/kg (up to 150 mg) 
dose of fosaprepitant. 
Ondansetron was required as part of the antiemetic regimen for Protocol 134 and Cycle 1 of Protocols 
029 and 044.

In all three studies (P134, P029 and P044), IV dexamethasone was permitted for subjects as an 
optional component of the antiemetic regimen at the discretion of the investigator according to the 
product label for paediatric usage or local standard of care. Because of the known drug-drug 
interaction profile between aprepitant and dexamethasone in adults, dexamethasone was administered 
at 50% of the otherwise intended dose to subjects receiving concomitant fosaprepitant.

Adverse events 
The ASaT population was used for the analysis of safety data and included all randomized subjects (in 
study P134, P029 and P044) who received at least one dose of study medication. Events related to the 
efficacy endpoint (vomiting and dry heaves/retching) were not defined as AEs during the period of 
diary data collection (~120 hours following initiation of emetogenic chemotherapy in Cycle 1) unless 
they met the definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE). After completion of the diary reporting 
period (Day 5), vomiting and dry heaves/retching were considered AEs. 
‘In the optional Cycles 2 to 6 of Protocols 029 and 044, only SAEs and non-serious AEs determined by 
the investigator to be drug-related or events that led to discontinuation from the study were required 
to be reported.

Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable row and column. 
A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence 
criterion in the report title, after rounding. 
The column “1-Day Supportive Pool” includes subjects receiving fosaprepitant in single-day doses of 150mg and 5mg/kg. 
The column “3-Day Supportive Pool” includes subjects receiving fosaprepitant in single-day doses of 150mg, 5mg/kg and 3mg/kg and a 3-day 
regimen of fosaprepitant 115 mg on Day 1 and aprepitant 80 mg on Days 2 and 3. 
The column ”Difference” includes the different, in percentage) between the control regimen and the 1-Day and 3-Day regimen.

The two most commonly reported Grade 3 AEs were febrile neutropenia and anemia with a similar 
incidence in both the fosaprepitant and control groups. The most commonly reported Grade 4 toxicities 
were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, in which similar incidences were reported in both the 
fosaprepitant and control groups.

Protocol 134, 029 and 044 combined, Cycle 1 
Four of the considered drug-related AEs were SAEs: hyponatraemia (Fosaprepitant 3 mg/kg regimen; 
Protocol 134 Part V); anaphylactic reaction (Fosaprepitant 5 mg/kg regimen; Protocol 029); 
hypersensitivity (Fosaprepitant 150 mg regimen; Protocol 044); and seizure (Control regimen; Protocol 
044). 
Symptoms of hyponatremia presented in a patient 8 hours after fosaprepitant administration. At that 
time s-Na was 122 mEq/L (baseline 139 mEq/L; normal range 137-145 mEq/L). With treatment, the 
patient recovered to the next day. 
Anaphylactic reaction occurred in one subject after administration of about 7 mg fosaprepitant. 
Fosaprepitant was discontinued (permanently), and with treatment the anaphylactic reaction resolved 
after about 10 minutes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/219267/2018  
Page 79/93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A severe hypersensitivity reaction occurred in one patient immediately after fosaprepitant infusion. 
Fosaprepitant was stopped (permanently) and with treatment against hypersensitivity reaction, the 
event resolved within 1 hour. 
Seizure occurred in one patient about 45 minutes after completion of chemotherapy (cycle 1). The 
patient had received placebo fosaprepitant + ondansetron and dexamethasone prior to chemotherapy. 
The event resolved. 
Protocols 029, and 044 Combined, Cycle 2-6 
There was one drug-related SAE (seizure) in cycle 2-6 of protocol 029 and 044 combined. A subject 
who received fosaprepitant and experienced seizures in cycle 5. The patient had a history of brain 
sarcoma, tumour excision and previous seizure episodes. 
Deaths 
No subjects included in the Cycle 1 of Protocols 134, 029 and 044 died. 
Two subjects in the optional cycles of Protocol 029 died, one due to progress of disease and the other 
due to neutropenia. A third subject who participated in the optional cycles died (due to tumour 
progression), approximately two months after discontinuation from the trial. Two of these three deaths 
are not reflected in the AE because the deaths occurred outside the reporting follow up period (ie, >14 
days following the last dose of study medication). One subject in the optional cycles of Protocol 044 
died due to sepsis. 
Laboratory findings 
After the approval and launch of the fosaprepitant formulations for use in adults, the US Food and 
Drug Administration requested that a separate fosaprepitant formulation with a reduced 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) content be developed for use in children. This request was in 
response to an upward trend in reported events of syncope in patients following launch of another  
product that had recently been reformulated to include EDTA. Although no fosaprepitant-related events 
of syncope had been reported in the adult clinical development program or during post marketing 
surveillance, a formulation with a reduced amount of EDTA was developed to support the paediatric 
development program.  
Both the original and reduced EDTA formulations were used during the fosaprepitant paediatric clinical 
development program. The original formulation was used in the Phase I PK/safety study P134 and the 
reduced EDTA formulation was used in the Phase IIb study P029 and Phase III study P044.  
In Protocol 134, the original fosaprepitant formulations (115 mg in Part IA and 150 mg in Part IB and 
V) were evaluated. To detect possible EDTA-related AEs, such as hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesemia, 
syncope and hypotension, the applicant included multiple measurements of heart rate and blood 
pressure as well as ionized calcium and magnesium monitoring before and after fosaprepitant infusion 
in Protocol 134. Across the study, no clinically meaningful AEs, changes in vital signs or electrolytes 
associated with EDTA were reported with the original fosaprepitant formulation. The drug-related AEs 
of syncope and hypotension reported in a single subject in Protocol 134 were associated with a normal 
ionized calcium level. 
In Protocols 029 and 044, a reduced EDTA 150 mg fosaprepitant formulation was evaluated. Vital 
signs, including blood pressure and heart rate, and laboratory evaluations, including calcium and 
magnesium, were included in Protocol 029. Protocol 044 included additional measurements of blood 
pressure and heart rate pre- and post-fosaprepitant infusion as well as ionized calcium measurements, 
Assessment report  
EMA/219267/2018  
Page 80/93 
 
 
 
 
 
15 minutes post fosaprepitant infusion. The applicant states that safety data collected with the reduced 
EDTA formulation in Protocols 044 and 029, demonstrated no drug-related events of hypocalcaemia, 
hypomagnesaemia, hypotension, or syncope. 
For a few number of patients, laboratory values were collected at baseline and post fosaprepitant 
treatment (day 6 to 8) (around 33 patients in Protocol 134 and 132 patients in Protocol 029). Protocol 
044 measured laboratory parameters at baseline and around 15 to 20 days post fosaprepitant 
treatment. There was an increase in NCI toxicity grade 3 and 4 for WBC, neutrophil and platelet count, 
as expected in a chemotherapy treated population. Even though there was a larger proportion of 
patients in the fosaprepitant treated group compared to the control group, who had decrease in WBC 
in study P029 and P044, no unexpected consistent deviations in laboratory parameters were noted. No 
consistent unexpected deviations were observed in vital signs or ECG-measurements.  
Safety in special populations 
There are no clinical data in subjects with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh score >9). 
There have not been any prospective studies evaluating aprepitant in pregnant or lactating women. 
Aprepitant may reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives; therefore, women of childbearing 
potential participating in aprepitant/fosaprepitant clinical studies were advised to avoid pregnancy and 
were required to use two adequate barrier methods of contraception while participating in clinical 
studies. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Four subjects included in the Cycle 1 integrated dataset discontinued study medication due to an AE. 
The AEs were: anaphylactic reaction, discomfort/ flushing, hypersensitivity, and pyrexia. All but 
anaphylactic and hypersensitivity were moderate and all resolved on treatment after discontinuation of 
study drug. 
No subjects in the optional Cycles 2 to 6 of Protocols 029 and 044 had an AE that resulted in 
discontinuation of study medication. 
Post marketing experience 
Fosaprepitant 115 mg was first approved 20-Aug-2007. As of 10-May-2017, fosaprepitant 150 mg 
(single dose regimen) is registered and approved in more than 75 countries. On 18-Mar-2016 
fosaprepitant 150 mg single dose was approved in patients 12 to 17 years of age and 3 mg/kg in 
patients 6 months to <12 years of age, in Japan. Fosaprepitant has not been approved in paediatric 
patients outside Japan, but off-label use has occurred. 
In total (as of 10-May-2017) an estimated 10,305,101 doses of fosaprepitant 150 mg or 115 mg 
constitutes the foundation of post-marketing experience. The applicant states that to date, the pattern 
of adverse experiences in the post-marketing environment remains generally consistent with the safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/219267/2018

data reported for fosaprepitant in clinical trials. An estimate of fosaprepitant use in the paediatric 
population cannot be determined from available data. 
The applicant searched their internal database for fosaprepitant spontaneous and non-interventional 
study reports received from health care providers (HCPs) and consumers in patients less than 18 years 
of age (reported in the designated age field) from market introduction (20-Aug-2007) through 10-May-
2017. 
A total of 4,983 (1,328 [27%] serious) spontaneous and non-interventional study reports for 
fosaprepitant received from HCPs and consumers were identified. Of these, 69 reports (12 serious 
[17%]) involved AEs in paediatric patients (17 years of age and younger); 67 cases were received 
from HCPs. In 13 reports, the indication for use of fosaprepitant was not specified. The majority of the 
remaining reports involved treatment with fosaprepitant for post-operative nausea and vomiting 
(PONV) (40). The remaining 20 reports involved treatment with fosaprepitant for the following 
indications: vomiting (7), antiemetic supportive care (5), nausea (3), prophylaxis against 
chemotherapy-induced vomiting (2), product use issue (drug use in unapproved population) (1), off 
label use (1) and Ewing’s sarcoma (1).

The most frequently reported serious event was anaphylactic shock (3 events in 2 cases). In both 
cases, anaphylactic shock was reported as an AE; however, symptoms and/or vital signs indicative of 
anaphylactic shock were not provided to the applicant. The applicant informs that both patients 
recovered following treatment with corticosteroids or corticosteroid and an antihistamine. 
The majority of reported events in paediatric patients involved non-serious events that were either 
described in the label or were preferred terms indicating off label use in paediatric patients. There is no 
pattern or trend presented in these reports to suggest a new safety concern not previously identified in 
adults for therapy with fosaprepitant. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In total 331 paediatric patients were exposed to fosaprepitant in study P029, P044 and P134 (part I 
and V). The validity of safety information from study P208 and P097 (where a paediatric population 
received aprepitant) is in part determined by the possibility to bridge these results to the fosaprepitant 
regimen.  
In a pooled analysis of 3 active-controlled clinical studies in paediatric patients (aged 6 months to 17 
years) receiving either HEC or MEC and a single dose of IVEMEND at or above the recommended 1-day 
regimen dose, safety was evaluated for 139 patients receiving the 1-day regimen of IVEMEND. In the 
same analysis, safety was evaluated for 199 patients receiving either HEC or MEC and a single dose of 
IVEMEND at or above the recommended 3-day regimen of IVEMEND. Safety data following the 
administration of the 3-day IV/oral/oral regimen were also included. 
In 3 active-controlled, open-label clinical studies, paediatric patients aged 6 months to 17 years 
received either highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and a single dose of fosaprepitant at or 
above the recommended 1-day regimen dose (139 patients) or 3-day regimen (199 patients), in 
combination with ondansetron with or without dexamethasone.

ONO-7847-03 is a small (n=22) study in a paediatric age group in Japan. Adverse drug reactions 
assumed to be related to fosaprepitant was 1/22 (4.5%) and constituted of one case of mild abdominal 
pain. The safety results from the study do not contribute significantly to the overall safety analysis. 
The different studies presented by the applicant include different inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Baseline characteristics differ between studies, e.g. major malignancy type, as well as chemotherapy 
regimen and antiemetic therapy. This complicates the separation of the fosaprepitant specific safety 
profile. 
When safety data from study P029, 044 and 134 were combined, AEs were observed in slightly more 
than 80% (i.e. 83.9-84.9%) of fosaprepitant exposed patients compared to 78% in control arm. Drug 
related AEs were considered to be similar in fosaprepitant exposed patients and patients in the control 
arm (around 6%). Few patients discontinued due to drug related adverse events (1.5-2.2% in 
fosaprepitant treated and 0 in control arm). 
In age specific groups there was a slightly higher incidence of AEs among fosaprepitant treated 
patients 6 to <12 years old whereas there were no significant differences regarding AEs, drug related 
AEs, SAE, drug related SAE and discontinuation, between fosaprepitant treated patients and patients in 
the control group. Thus, the difference observed in the 6 to <12 years age group is considered to 
reflect the small sample.  
No clear differences between fosaprepitant and control arm were seen when AEs were summarised by 
system organ class, except for a slightly higher proportion of gastrointestinal disorders and platelet 
count decrease in the fosaprepitant treated group. There were no differences when only grade 3 and 4 
AEs were examined. Neither were there any clinically significant differences regarding drug related AEs 
and no consistent pattern of drug related AEs when the pooled data from study P029, 044 and 134 
were examined. 
There were no clinically significant differences between fosaprepitant 1-day regimen, 3-day regimen 
and controls in proportion of serious adverse events. The pattern of SAEs was a pattern expected in a 
population treated with chemotherapy. Five SAE were considered drug related, some previously known 
like hypersensitivity reactions, others not so well connected to the drug, like seizures. No drug-related 
SAE were fatal. 
The safety profile of fosaprepitant in adult and paediatric patients was generally similar to that 
observed with aprepitant. 
The most common adverse reactions reported at a greater incidence in paediatric patients treated with 
the aprepitant regimen than with the control regimen while receiving emetogenic cancer chemotherapy 
were hiccups (3.3 % versus 0.0 %) and flushing (1.1 % versus 0.0 %). Flushing or irritation at 
injection site is considered to be manageable as a fair number of patients in the targeted population 
will have a central venous access. 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Interactions with other medicinal products following administration of intravenous fosaprepitant are 
likely to occur with active substances that interact with oral aprepitant. The potential for interactions 
with multi-day fosaprepitant regimens are anticipated to be no greater than those for oral aprepitant 
regimens. Therefore, the recommendations for use of IVEMEND with other medicinal products in 
paediatric patients are based upon adult data from fosaprepitant and aprepitant studies. When using 
combined IVEMEND and EMEND regimens, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC) section 4.5 for EMEND capsules or EMEND for oral suspension.

No data are available following the administration of a 3-day IV fosaprepitant regimen in paediatric 
patients. The safety profile of the 3-day IV fosaprepitant regimen in paediatric patients is expected to 
be similar to that of the 1-day fosaprepitant regimen as the low daily trough levels do not significantly 
increase the exposures on subsequent days. 
No dose adjustment is necessary for subjects with renal insufficiency or for mild to moderate hepatic 
insufficiency (Child-Pugh score 5 to 9). No new data regarding safety in special populations are from 
post-marketing experience, there were no reports that constitute a safety signal or grounds for a 
change in safety assessment at this point.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile (with regard to clinical AEs and SAE) in the paediatric population corresponds to the 
known safety profile of aprepitant, and fosaprepitant in an adult population.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication applied for is: “Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly and 
moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in adults and paediatric patients aged 6 months and 
older.” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Aprepitant - a selective, high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptors - 
is indicated for the same population and fosaprepitant is indicated in adults. Other available therapies 
include 5-HT3-antagonists and corticosteroids. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The studies included to support fosaprepitant 1-day regimen in a paediatric population were performed 
with fosaprepitant in an adult population. The studies included to support fosaprepitant 3-day regimen 
in a paediatric population were performed with aprepitant in a paediatric population. All studies of 
efficacy have previously been assessed in other procedures, and have been found to support efficacy in 
the studied populations. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The 1-day regimen of fosaprepitant was, in study P017L1, found to achieve similar response in terms 
of overall complete response, as 1-day aprepitant regimen. The fosaprepitant treated arm in study 
P031 achieved 83.9% complete response in the delayed phase, compared to 75.1% in the placebo 
arm. 
The main supportive study for the 3-day regimen, P208, described a complete response in the delayed 
phase of 50.7% in the aprepitant arm compared to 26% in the control arm. 
Fosaprepitant is rapidly converted in the body to its active form aprepitant following intravenous (IV) 
administration (see EPAR Ivemend).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
As the clinical efficacy of fosaprepitant is based on extrapolations, the precise magnitude of effect is 
uncertain.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Unfavourable effects are in line with known, and previously assessed, unfavourable effects of 
aprepitant in a paediatric population and fosaprepitant in an adult population. No new, clinically 
significant, unfavourable effects have been noted in the pooled data analysis from the applicant.

uncertainties besides already known for an adult population have been noted.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Efficacy of 1-day fosaprepitant treatment in children can be predicted from that demonstrated in adults 
based on similar pathophysiology of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) as well as 
similar response to NK1 receptor antagonists in adults and children.   
Further, since the conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant is rapid, efficacy following fosaprepitant 
administration can be expected to be derived from exposure to aprepitant. Based on this rationale, the 
MAH bridged the efficacy of 3-day fosaprepitant treatment in children from that demonstrated with the 
paediatric 3-day oral aprepitant regimen.

Unfavourable effects do not differ significantly from those found in a paediatric population treated with 
aprepitant. Thus, the extrapolation of efficacy and safety data on the basis of pharmacokinetics is 
considered acceptable. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The primary endpoints have been met in the studies reviewed and the extrapolation and modelling 
considerations are acceptable. The safety is considered adequately documented in a paediatric 
population and does not raise any concerns.  
Alignment with the indications of aprepitant (by deleting “cisplatin – based chemotherapy ) is 
acceptable based on the fact that fosaprepitant is rapidly converted in the body to its active form 
aprepitant following intravenous (IV) administration (see EPAR Ivemend).  
Thus, the B/R balance is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Ivemend in the indication: “Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with 
highly and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in adults and paediatric patients older than 6 
months” is positive.  
4.  Recommendations

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee 
for Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial 
marketing authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal 
product. In particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the 
assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential 
information, please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of 
commercially confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification 
by 06 April 2018. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the EMA 
website at 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Other/2012/03/WC500124536.pdf.

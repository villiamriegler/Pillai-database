2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) proposes to add the following new indication for Lonsurf in 
combination with bevacizumab: 
"Lonsurf is indicated in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of adult patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have received two prior anticancer treatment regimens (see 
section 5.1).“ 
Epidemiology and risk factors 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in terms of incidence and second in terms of 
mortality in the world. Globally more than 1.85 million new CRC cases and 916 000 deaths were 
estimated to occur in 2020. There is an approximately 9-fold variation in colon cancer incidence rates 
by world regions, with the highest rates in European regions, Australia/ New Zealand, and Northern 
America. Rectal cancer incidence rates have a similar regional distribution, although rates in Eastern 
Asia rank among the highest (Sung, 2021). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 8/71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical presentation, and prognosis 
Approximately 25% of patients present with metastases at initial CRC diagnosis and almost 50% of 
patients with CRC will develop metastases, contributing to the high mortality rates reported for CRC 
(Ayez, 2011; Cervantes, 2022). 
The overall prognosis of patients with mCRC has improved significantly in the past decades, and the 
average survival is 30 months (Formica, 2015). Although some patients with mCRC can be cured 
through surgical and ablative techniques, the disease remains incurable in most cases, and there is 
clearly a need for new therapeutic approaches. 
Management 
In patients with unresectable disease, chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. Various 
combinations of drugs may be used for the treatment of these patients at some point during the 
duration of their disease based on European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines 
(Cervantes, 2022) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (NCCN, 2019; 
NCCN, 2021) for the United States of America (USA). The choice of chemotherapy is based upon the 
consideration of the goals of therapy, the type and timing of prior therapies, and the differing toxicity 
profiles of the constituent drugs. Historically, a combined regimen containing a fluoropyrimidine 
formed the backbone of chemotherapy for decades. However, the introduction of monoclonal 
antibodies targeting VEGF receptor and the use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors 
for a subset of mCRC patients with RAS wild-type tumours, have shown to improve clinical outcomes 
when combined with chemotherapy (Baldus, 2010). 
Following progression after treatment with standard chemotherapies (i.e. a fluoropyrimidine, 
oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and as applicable, anti-VEGF and/or anti-EGFR antibodies), the estimated OS 
with best supportive care treatment alone is around 5 months (RECOURSE trial). However, an 
increasing number of patients with mCRC can receive 3 or more lines of therapy (Bekaii-Saab, 2018). 
Treatments in this setting include regorafenib (a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor), FTD/TPI 
(trifluridine/tipiracil) monotherapy, and for specific subgroups of patients, antibodies that target EGFR 
for patients with RAS wild-type tumours (if no prior exposure), and anti-programmed cell death protein 
1 inhibitors for patients with microsatellite instability-high mCRC (Cervantes, 2022; NCCN, 2019; 
NCCN, 2021). Clinical trials of emerging agents, new treatment combinations, and novel therapies are 
still needed to continue the efforts to improve outcomes for patients with mCRC (Cervantes, 2022). 
In the USA, the most recently updated NCCN guidelines include the possibility of using FTD/TPI with 
the addition of bevacizumab (NCCN, 2021) based on the results of the Danish trial, a randomised 
Phase 2 trial conducted in Denmark (Pfeiffer, 2020). The combination is not approved for the 
treatment of refractory mCRC in any region. 
2.1.1.  About the product 
FTD/TPI 
Trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) is a combination of FTD and TPI at a molar ratio 1:0.5. Results of in vivo 
studies show FTD incorporation into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to be the primary mechanism of anti-
tumour activity with oral administration. FTD is incorporated into DNA in tumour cells following three 
phosphorylation steps. The first phosphorylation is mediated by thymidine kinase (TK). TPI inhibits 
degradation of FTD by inhibiting TPase, thus increasing systemic exposure to FTD. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 9/71 
 
 
 
 
FTD/TPI monotherapy is currently approved for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic 
colorectal cancer (CRC) who have been previously treated with, or are not considered candidates for, 
available therapies including fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapies, anti-
VEGF agents, and anti EGFR agents in the European Union ([EU], 2016).The recommended starting 
dose of FTD/TPI is 35 mg/m2/dose administered orally twice daily (BID) on days 1 to 5 and days 8 to 
12 of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs (Lonsurf EU PI). 
Rationale for the combination of trifluridine/tipiracil with bevacizumab in mCRC 
Bevacizumab is approved for treatment of mCRC in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based 
chemotherapy. Continuation of bevacizumab beyond first progression has an, albeit modest, OS 
benefit and administration of bevacizumab in addition to chemotherapy in both first- and second-line 
settings is mentioned in the recent ESMO guideline (Cervantes et al. Ann Oncol. 2023). See also the 
results of Study ML18147 in which the addition of bevacizumab to fluoropyrimidine-based 
chemotherapy resulted in a prolongation of survival in patients with mCRC who have progressed on a 
first-line bevacizumab-containing regimen (Avastin SmPC). 
The combination of FTD/TPI and bevacizumab has shown activity against CRC xenografts in mice and 
in two preliminary investigator-initiated clinical trials conducted in refractory mCRC patients. 
The approved indication: 
Lonsurf is indicated in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of adult patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have received two prior anticancer treatment regimens 
including fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapies, anti-VEGF agents, 
and/or anti-EGFR agents. 
The recommended starting dose of Lonsurf in adults, as monotherapy or in combination with 
bevacizumab, is 35 mg/m2/dose administered orally twice daily on Days 1 to 5 and Days 8 to 12 of 
each 28-day cycle as long as benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
When Lonsurf is used in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of metastatic CRC, the dose 
of bevacizumab is 5 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks. Please refer to the full product 
information for bevacizumab. 
2.1.2.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
There was no scientific advice for this product in the current indication.  
2.1.3.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Applicant stated that the pivotal trial for the current application, the SUNLIGHT study, was 
conducted in accordance with the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki, 1964, as 
revised in 2013, as revised in Fortaleza, 2013 with the GCP and with the applicable regulatory 
requirements. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP.

2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH presented an ERA for a new therapeutic indication of Lonsurf in combination with 
bevacizumab for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have 
received two prior anticancer treatment regimens. 
Lonsurf is a drug containing two active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), trifluridine and tipiracil 
hydrochloride. It is currently indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of metastatic CRC and 
metastatic gastric cancer (GC). 
The assessment was based upon the recommendations in Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as 
amended, and in the principles laid out in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline on the 
environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMA, 2006) abbreviated “the 
guideline” in the following. Moreover, the recommendations as published in EMA Questions and 
answers on Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMA, 2016) use abbreviated “the Q&A document”, as well as the draft for the revised EMA guideline 
(EMA, 2018), abbreviated “the draft guideline”. 
A Phase I evaluation of the two APIs of Lonsurf was performed, including screening for Persistence, 
Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) by experimentally determining the octanol water coefficient (log 
Kow) and calculation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) in surface water. 
The log Kow value fell below the Action Limit of 4.5 specified in the guideline for both APIs over a wide 
range of pH values, indicating no relevant risk of PBT. 
PECSURFACE WATER TOTAL = PECSURFACE WATER CRC + PECSURFACE WATER GC 
PECSURFACE WATER TOTAL trifluridine = 0.00333 µg/L + 0.0016 µg/L = 0.0049 µg/L 
PECSURFACE WATER TOTAL tipiracil hydrochloride = 0.00157 µg/L + 0.00075 µg/L = 0.00232 µg/L 
For each API, the PECSURFACE WATER fell below the Action Limit of 0.01 µg/L, as defined in the guideline. 
Therefore, a Phase II assessment is regarded as not necessary. The assessment can stop after Phase 
I.

2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
An updated ERA was submitted to support this application for an extension of indication. The Fpen 
refinement has taken the existing and new indications into account. The resulting total PECSURFACE 
WATER does not exceed the action limit and therefore a phase II assessment is not needed.

2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated ERA submitted in this application does not indicate a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride.  
- Considering the above data, trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride are not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The applicant has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community were carried 
out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
• 
Tabular overview of clinical studies, see Table 2. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The combination regimen of FTD/TPI with bevacizumab was initially studied in the C-TASK FORCE 
Phase 1/2 study conducted in Japanese patients with mCRC refractory to standard chemotherapies. 
Using a dose de-escalation design in Phase 1, the recommended dose for Phase 2 was determined for 
FTD/TPI as 35 mg/m²/dose BID on Days 1-5 and Days 8-12 in a 4-week cycle plus bevacizumab (5 
mg/kg, IV) on Days 1 and 15 in a 4-week cycle (Kuboki, 2017), which is the same as the FTD/TPI 
monotherapy dose per product information (PI). Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed for FTD 
during cycle 1 of the Phase 1 part of the C-TASK FORCE study. The combination of FTD/TPI with 
bevacizumab (C-TASK FORCE trial) did not increase the FTD and TPI exposure in plasma as compared 
to that of previously reported FTD/TPI monotherapy (TAS102-J001 trial), as shown in Table 1. The 
differences in Cmax, AUC0-t and AUCinf were statistically insignificant (p=0.98, p=0.92, and p=0.92, 
respectively). The geometric mean ratios (i.e., C-TASK FORCE trial/TAS102-J001 trial) of TPI Cmax and 
AUCinf were 1.1 and 0.96, respectively.

Table 1 - Comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters between C-TASK-FORCE and TAS102-J001. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new PK data for FTD/TPI in combination with bevacizumab was included in the dossier to support 
this Type II variation. This is considered acceptable as 1) no interaction between FTD/TPI and 
bevacizumab is expected based on the mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetic characteristics 
described in the SmPCs of FTD/TPI (LONSURF) and bevacizumab; and 2) earlier research (Kuboki, 
2017) reported comparable FTD and TPI exposure between combined FTD/TPI with bevacizumab and 
FTD/TPI monotherapy, which indicates no drug interaction between FTD/TPI and bevacizumab. 
In regard to this type II variation, no pharmacokinetic adjustments are proposed for the Lonsurf 
SmPC, is acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response study was performed with the proposed combination therapy in the proposed 
indication. The proposed doses of FTD/TPI and bevacizumab are the same as in the already approved 
indications. 
2.4.2.  Main study – SUNLIGHT 
The efficacy data for the current application come from a single pivotal trial, CL3-95005-007, 
abbreviated as SUNLIGHT (NCT04737187). This was a multinational, open-label, two-arm, randomised 
phase 3 study comparing treatment with FTD/TPI in combination with bevacizumab to FTD/TPI 
monotherapy in patients with refractory mCRC. The study design is summarized in Table 2. 
The data cut-off dates were 05 July 2022 for clinical data (i.e. non-survival) and 19 July 2022 
(occurrence of 331st death) for survival data. The median follow-up duration was 14.1 months.

Treatments 
FTD/TPI was administered at the starting dose and schedule recommended in the treatment of patients 
with mCRC, 35 mg/m2 BID on days 1 to 5 and days 8 to 12 of each 28-day cycle. Bevacizumab in 
combination with FTD/TPI was administered intravenously (IV) at 5 mg/kg of body weight given once 
every 2 weeks of a 4-week cycle, which is one approved posology of bevacizumab in the treatment of 
Assessment report

mCRC. The study was open-label and no placebo for the intravenous bevacizumab injection was given 
to patients in the comparator arm.  
Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
If a medical condition developed that required bevacizumab to be permanently withdrawn the patient 
could continue with FTD/TPI alone. Bevacizumab was not to be administered alone in case of dose 
delay due to FTD/TPI toxicities. The cycle was to be delayed, and bevacizumab was to be restarted at 
the same time of FTD/TPI. IF FTD/TPI treatment was permanently discontinued, bevacizumab 
monotherapy was not allowed. FTD/TPI missed doses were not to be replaced. 
All toxicities related to FTD/TPI had to be resolved to Grade 1 or baseline before the start of a new 
treatment cycle. In the event of haematological and/or non-haematological toxicities, rules for FTD/TPI 
dose interruption and resumption were provided as in Table 3; rules for dose modifications were 
provided as in Table 4. No dose reductions for bevacizumab were recommended. Bevacizumab therapy 
should either be permanently discontinued or temporarily suspended in case of toxicity.

Common terminology criteria for adverse events 
If the patient recovered from toxicities requiring treatment interruption: 
During the 2-week active treatment intake period of a cycle (treatment D1-D12): 
• 
• 
If no dose reduction was required, FTD/TPI could be resumed during that cycle. 
If a dose reduction was required, FTD/TPI had to be resumed at the start of the next cycle at 
the appropriate dose level. 
During the rest period (D13-D28): 
•  The next cycle was to be started on schedule at the appropriate FTD/TPI dose level. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 17/71 
 
 
 
 
 
If the toxicities did not resolve during the given cycle to Grade 1 or baseline, the start of the next cycle 
had to be delayed for a maximum of 28 days from the scheduled start date of next cycle. If more than 
28 days were needed to recover, the patient had to be withdrawn from treatment. 
The criteria for discontinuation from treatment were: 
•  Adverse events incompatible with continuation of the study treatments according to the 
judgment of the investigator, including no recovery in safety parameters or according to the 
following predefined criteria: 
o  A maximum dose delay of more than 28 days from the scheduled start date of the next 
cycle. 
o  Need for more than 3 dose reductions of FTD/TPI (maximum of 3 dose reductions 
allowed). 
•  Protocol deviation if it interfered with the study evaluations and/or if it jeopardised 
participant’s safety, e.g. any medical event requiring administration of an unauthorised 
concomitant treatment. 
•  Radiologic progressive disease documented by CT-scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). 
•  Clinical progressive disease manifested by symptomatic deterioration. 
•  Non-medical reason (to be carefully described) e.g. consent withdrawal, patient’s removal. 
•  Other, physician decision (for medical reasons that could not be included in any of the criteria 
listed above). 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of FTD/TPI in combination with bevacizumab 
over FTD/TPI monotherapy in terms of OS in patients with refractory mCRC. 
The secondary objectives were to estimate the effect of FTD/TPI in combination with bevacizumab 
versus FTD/TPI monotherapy in terms of PFS, ORR, and DCR in patients with refractory mCRC. Other 
secondary objectives were to compare the safety and tolerance, and the impact on QoL of FTD/TPI in 
combination with bevacizumab to FTD/TPI monotherapy in patients with refractory mCRC. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), defined as the observed time between the date of 
randomisation and the date of death due to any cause. 
The most important secondary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). PFS was based on 
investigator judgment and was defined as the time between the randomisation and the date of 
radiologic tumour progression according to RECIST version 1.1 or death from any cause. 
Overall response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) based investigator’s assessment of tumour response. Disease 
control rate (DCR) was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a CR or PR or stable disease 
based on the investigator’s assessment of tumour response. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 18/71 
 
 
 
 
The Best Overall Response (BOR) as per RECIST 1.1 was defined as the best response recorded from 
the start of the study treatment until the end of treatment. In this study, the minimum time from 
baseline to assess a response of “stable disease” was 6 weeks. 
Safety assessments included recording of adverse events (AEs) including serious AEs (graded by NCI-
CTCAE, version 5.0), and concomitant treatments. Other safety assessments were evaluation of clinical 
laboratory tests, 12-lead ECG, ECOG PS, vital signs, weight, height, physical examination findings, 
and, if the patient was female of childbearing potential, pregnancy testing. 
The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 
Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the EQ-5D-5L tools were used to assess quality of life. 
Sample size 
A maximum of 331 events (deaths for any cause) were required for the primary analysis to detect a 
HR of 0.70 with 90% power using a log-rank test at one-sided cumulative 2.5% level of significance. 
Based on the data from the RECOURSE study (Mayer, 2015), the median OS (mOS) in the control 
group was expected to be around 7.1 months. 
A hazard ratio (HR) of 0.70 translates into a 3-month increase of the mOS in the experimental arm 
(10.1 months) compared to the control arm. Based on the assumption that enrolment would have 
continued for approximately 12 months, and that about 5% per year of the patients would drop out, a 
total of 490 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio were needed to observe the 331st OS event 
approximately 9 months after the last patient randomisation. 
Randomisation 
The treatment group was allocated via IWRS using a central randomisation (1:1) to FTD/TPI in 
combination with bevacizumab or FTD/TPI monotherapy with stratification factors being the geographic 
region (North America, European Union, Rest of the World), the time since first metastasis diagnosis 
(< 18 months, ≥ 18 months) and the RAS status (wild type, mutant). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study; the investigators and patients were not blinded to study treatment.  
Statistical methods  
Study periods 
The study was divided into the following periods for each patient (Figure 1): 
•  Screening visit (up to 28 days prior to randomisation) was to obtain informed consent. 
•  Screening period and inclusion: the eligibility of the patient to be included and randomised in 
the study was checked. 
•  Randomisation: included patients were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups: 
FTD/TPI + Bev or FTD/TPI. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 19/71 
 
 
 
 
•  Treatment period: randomised patients received the first dose of study treatments (C1D1) 
within 3 days after randomisation and continued until they met a discontinuation criterion as 
described above. 
•  Withdrawal visit occurred within 4 weeks following the date of IMPs withdrawal and before the 
start of a new anticancer therapy. 
•  Post-withdrawal follow-up period: after the withdrawal visit, the patient was followed: 
o  For tumour assessment (unless patient had discontinued study treatments for radiologic 
disease progression or withdrawal of consent) every 8 weeks until radiologic progression 
regardless of initiation of a new anticancer therapy. 
o  For survival status every 8 weeks until death or the end of the study (whichever first 
occurred). 
The end of study was planned 19 months after the first investigational medical product (IMP) intake of 
the last patient randomised and defined as the date of the last follow-up of the last patient (including a 
phone contact) or the date of the last contact attempt if the last patient was declared lost to follow-up. 
Once the study is completed, patients still being treated will be offered the option to continue the 
treatments outside the study. 
Measurements 
Tumour assessments were performed by the investigator according to the revised RECIST 1.1 criteria  
(Eisenhauer 2009; RECIST 1.1 update and clarification Schwartz 2016). 
Tumour assessments/imaging studies of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at a minimum (other 
localisations if clinically indicated) were obtained at each time point listed below for all patients: 
•  Baseline: within 28 days prior to randomisation. Images obtained prior to the patient signing 
the ICF could be used if the date of the images was within 28 days of randomisation and if in 
line with methods and techniques that were used during study. 
•  Every 2 cycles from Day 1 Cycle 1 until radiologic progression was documented (including at 
the withdrawal visit if not done in the previous 8 weeks).  
• 
For patients who discontinued treatment for reasons other than radiologic disease progression 
or consent withdrawal, every 8 weeks during the follow up period until the patient experienced 
radiologic progression, regardless of the initiation of new anticancer therapy. 
If the investigator determined that a patient developed clinical progression manifested by symptomatic 
deterioration but not supported by radiologic evidence of progression, the patient had to stop 
treatment. Symptoms of clinical progression were documented in the patient’s source documents and 
in AE form. Tumour assessments continued every 8 weeks until radiologic progression was 
documented.

Figure 1: Study periods and measurements 
Analysis sets 
•  Screened set: All patients screened. 
• 
• 
Included set (IS): All included patients. 
Full analysis set (FAS): In accordance with the intention-to-treat principle and Section 5.2.1 of 
the ICH E9 guideline, all patients to whom a therapeutic unit was randomly assigned using 
IWRS. Patients in the FAS were analysed in the arm they were assigned by randomisation. 
•  Safety set (SS): All patients having taken at least one dose of FTD/TPI. Patients were analysed 
according to the treatment actually received. 
Primary endpoint OS analysis (FAS population)  
OS in the FAS population was compared between the 2 treatment groups using the stratified log-rank 
test one-sided 2.5% level of significance (stratification factors based on IWRS data). The hazard ratio 
of OS with its 95% confidence interval was estimated with a stratified Cox proportional hazard model 
(stratification factors based on IWRS data).   
During the study the following intercurrent events (IE) could have occurred: 
•  Administration of further anti-cancer therapy. 
•  Treatment discontinuation. 
•  Treatment switch (from FTD/TPI in combination with bevacizumab to FTD/TPI monotherapy 
and from FTD/TPI monotherapy to FTD/TPI in combination with bevacizumab (i.e. planned arm 
different from actual arm). 
The primary estimand of interest for OS was the effect of the randomised treatments on the survival 
duration in all patients regardless of whether or not intercurrent events occur (treatment policy 
strategy). All data collected during the trial regardless of any intercurrent event were used.  
Supportive analyses for OS, conducted in the FAS population (unless otherwise noted), included: 
• 
an unstratified log-rank test and an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model. 
•  An OS analysis which excluded patients who had not fulfilled at least one of the following 
criteria:  
o  Has histologically confirmed unresectable adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 21/71 
 
 
 
 
 
o  Has received a maximum of 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of 
advanced colorectal cancer and had demonstrated progressive disease or 
intolerance to their last regimen. 
o  Has measurable or non-measurable metastatic lesion(s) as defined by Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. 
o  Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1. 
o  More than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of advanced colorectal 
cancer. 
o  Has previously received trifluridine/tipiracil. 
o  Did not currently receive or has not received anticancer therapies within 4 weeks 
prior to randomisation. 
•  Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) for OS was to be estimated with its 95% confidence 
interval in each treatment group and the difference in RMST between treatment groups 
tested. 
A secondary estimand strategy based on OS was defined in order to assess the effect of the 
randomised treatments on the survival time in all subjects before patients received further anti-cancer 
therapy. The aim of this estimand was to evaluate the effect of the study treatment without taking into 
account any potential effects of another anti-cancer therapy. For the intercurrent event (IE) 
“administration of further anti-cancer therapy” and “treatment switch”, data obtained post-IE was not 
to be used for the analysis and OS times were to be censored at the time of administration of further 
anti-cancer therapy. For the intercurrent event of “treatment discontinuation”, patients were followed 
up under a treatment policy strategy approach unless they received further anti-cancer therapy.  
Secondary endpoint analysis  
The analysis approach for PFS was the same as the approach specified for the primary endpoint, OS. A 
treatment policy estimand approach was also specified for PFS: patients were censored if they were 
alive without documented radiological progression, lost to follow-up without documented radiological 
progression; or had no baseline or post-baseline tumour assessment.   
The following additional analyses were pre-specified for PFS: 
• 
an unstratified log-rank test and an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model. 
•  A secondary estimand strategy, for which clinical progression and administration of further 
anti-cancer therapy were defined as PFS events in addition to the radiological progression 
or death.  
• 
In line with FDA guidance, an analysis in which it was planned to censor PFS at the time of 
administration of further anti-cancer therapy, and in cases where patients had radiological 
progression or died after ≥ 2 consecutive missed radiological assessments. 
Other secondary endpoint analyses 
ORR and DCR were to be described using 2-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson CIs in each treatment arm. A 
Fisher’s exact test and a 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in ORR between the two treatment arms 
was also to be provided based on the normal approximation. If a stratified analysis is required a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test will be used.  
Multiplicity adjustments 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 22/71 
 
 
 
 
A hierarchical testing strategy, where PFS was to be statistically evaluated and interpreted only if the 
primary efficacy estimand OS is significantly different between the 2 treatment groups, was specified 
to control the overall type-I error rate. The other secondary endpoints were not included in the testing 
hierarchy. No interim analysis for efficacy was planned. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The overall disposition of randomised patients by group in the FAS is presented in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Disposition of patients 
A total of 659 patients provided consent and were screened. Among them, 167 (25.3%) were not 
included due to not meeting the eligibility criteria (24.3%) or withdrawal of consent (1.1%). 
Of the 160 patients that entered screening but were not randomized because of not meeting the 
eligibility criteria, most screen failures were because of not having received a maximum of 2 prior 
chemotherapy treatments, including all standard treatment lines, and showing PD or intolerance to the 
last regimen (40%). Also, many patients did not have adequate organ function as defined in the 
protocol (24.4%), and some did not have an adequate performance status during the entire screening 
period (6.9%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023

All included patients were randomised. Of the total of 492 randomised patients (i.e. the FAS), 246 
were assigned to FTD/TPI + bevacizumab and 246 were assigned to FTD/TPI. All randomised patients 
received study treatment as assigned at randomisation. As of clinical data cut-off, 36 (7.3%) patients 
were still on treatment (13.0% in the FTD/TPI + bevacizumab group, 1.6% in the FTD/TPI group). The 
main reason for study treatment discontinuation was clinical and/or radiological disease progression 
(77.6% vs 88.6%). For patients having both radiological and clinical progressive disease, the rate of 
withdrawal for this reason was higher in the FTD/TPI group than in the FTD/TPI + bevacizumab group 
(21.1% vs 10.6%). The other most frequent reason for treatment withdrawal was adverse events 
(6.5% in each group). The percentage of patients who withdrew consent was 2.0% in the FTD/TPI + 
bevacizumab group and 3.2% in the FTD/TPI group. 
Recruitment 
Patients were recruited at 102 sites in 13 countries. European patients were predominantly 
represented in the study with 315 (64.0%) patients from the EU (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, 
Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Spain). Additionally, 161 (32.7%) patients were from Brazil, Russian 
Federation and Ukraine, and 16 (3.3%) patients were from North America (USA). 
The study started on 25 November 2020 (first visit of first patient) and the last patient was 
randomised on 18 February 2022. 
Conduct of the study 
One global protocol amendment including substantial changes was issued for this study: Amendment 
No. 1, dated 30 December 2020 was applicable in all countries. It mainly concerned: 
•  New exclusion criteria for patients with uncontrolled hypertension, patients with history of any 
life-threatening VEGF related adverse event and patients with proteinuria. 
•  Sponsorship of TOI for the investigational sites in USA. 
•  Change of the time window to perform the tumour assessment. 
•  Baseline ECG obtained prior to patient having signed the ICF could be used if the date of ECG 
was within 28 days of randomisation. 
•  Clarifications were made. They concerned mainly: 
o 
Inclusion criterion number 4: to clarify that the considered prior treatment regimens 
were those for advanced CRC setting. 
o  Definition of the end of study. 
o  Reasons for discontinuation and restart of treatment period, in case of COVID-19 
infection. 
o  Follow-up procedures in case of withdrawal of consent. 
o  All fatal events occurring between ICF signature and IMP administration were to be 
reported on AE form. 
o  Precisions in statistical and safety parts of the protocol.

Inclusion of local amendment issued for France to specify that all patients in France should 
have received an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody before entry in the study.   
One global protocol amendment including non-substantial changes was issued on 08 June 2022 to 
update instructions for restarting treatment after COVID infection: restart could be done if patient was 
asymptomatic and a period of at least 7 days after the diagnosis has been respected, and with a 
negative test (if testing was required by the institutional site). 
Changes in the statistical analyses 
The original SAP version 1.0 was released on 06 November 2020. Prior to database lock, the SAP was 
amended once; version 2.0 was issued on 02 August 2022. The main changes to the SAP were the 
following: 
•  Update of subgroup categories (Section 2.3). 
•  Addition of methodology for data handling according to a survival cut-off date (Section 3.1). 
•  Addition of ‘Time from first metastasis diagnosis to randomisation’ definition and addition of 
precision on staging classifications (Sections 3.2.4.2 & 4.2.1.3.2). 
•  Updates of previous therapies descriptive analyses (Section 3.2.4.5). 
•  Update of covariate categories (Section 3.4.1.3.2). 
•  Addition of a sensitivity analysis (supportive 3) for secondary estimand based on PFS (FDA IND 
57674) (Section 3.4.1.3.1). 
•  Addition of EAEs related to disease progression and leading to death analyses (Section 3.5.2). 
•  Addition of figures displaying mean changes in QoL from baseline by scheduled assessment 
timepoint (Section 3.6). 
•  Update of categories of changes from baseline (Section 3.6.1). 
•  Update of the treatment period and after treatment period definitions considering both IMPs 
and a time window of 30 days (Sections 6 & 6.1). 
•  Update of scheduled QoL assessment timepoint definitions to take into account information 
from ePRO and eCRF; addition of withdrawal questionnaire definition (Sections 7.1 & 7.2). 
Changes or analyses decided after study database lock 
In the multivariate OS analysis, two factors were identified with potential predictive value based on the 
interaction p-value: time since first metastasis diagnosis (< 18, ≥ 18 months) and prior bevacizumab 
use (yes, no). Unplanned analyses based on the final multivariate model for OS were performed to 
confirm that the benefit from the combination therapy remained significant in the corresponding 
subgroups for both factors. 
Protocol deviations 
Overall, 51 patients had 57 important protocol deviations (IPDs) before or at inclusion with similar 
frequency in the treatment groups (10.2% and 10.6%). The most frequent IPDs before or at inclusion 
were those belonging to a predefined subset of IPDs as follows: 
•  Patient who received anticancer therapies within 4 weeks prior to randomisation (13 patients, 
2.6%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 26/71 
 
 
 
 
•  Patient who received more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of advanced 
CRC (12 patients, 2.4%). 
In addition, 3 patients (1.2%) in the FTD/TPI + bevacizumab group and 2 patients (0.8%) in the 
FTD/TPI group had ‘Proteinuria ≥ 2+ by dipstick’. Other IPDs were reported in less than 1% of the 
patients globally. One patient in the FTD/TPI group signed consent after first investigation and 2 
patients in the FTD/TPI + bevacizumab group had total serum bilirubin ≥ 1.5 ULN (i.e. not fulfilling 
eligibility criteria for inclusion). 
Overall, 49 patients had 87 IPDs after inclusion with higher frequency in the FTD/TPI + bevacizumab  
group than in the FTD/TPI group: 14.2% vs 5.7%. The most frequent deviations concerned the 
deviation class ‘Safety Possibly Affected’ with higher frequency in the FTD/TPI + bevacizumab group 
(11.4%) than in the FTD/TPI group (5.3%). This difference was mainly related to the occurrence of 
two deviations: blood sample for laboratory safety measurements not taken within 2 days prior to 
FTD/TPI intake (7.7% vs 4.5%) and not taken within 2 days prior to bevacizumab administration at 
Day 15 (4.9% in the FTD/TPI + bevacizumab group; IPD not applicable for patients in the FTD/TPI 
group).

Time to worsening of ECOG-PS 
Analysis of the time from randomisation to worsening of ECOG PS to ≥ 2 was performed in the FAS using 
Kaplan-Meier methodology to estimate median time of worsening ECOG PS ≥ 2 in each treatment group 
with a stratified log-rank test. To be considered as worsening, ECOG PS had to be increased by at least 1 
from baseline and to be at least of 2 on treatment. Death was considered as worsening of ECOG PS ≥ 2. 
In the FAS, the FTD/TPI + Bev group showed a numerical difference in time to worsening of ECOG PS to ≥ 
2 compared to the FTD/TPI group (p < 0.001, stratified log rank test). The median time to worsening of 
ECOG PS to ≥ 2 was 9.3 months (95% CI: 8.34, 10.61) vs 6.3 months (95% CI: 5.55, 7.23), respectively. 
Quality of life 
Quality of life (QoL) was assessed based on the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L assessment instruments. 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire and EQ-5D-5L were completed at the beginning of each visit by the 
patient: 
•  Within 7 days prior to randomisation (baseline). 
•  At Day 1 of cycles ≥ 2 (every cycle) prior to any study procedure. 
•  At withdrawal visit. 
EORTC QLQ-C30 
The QoL scores were analysed as change from baseline. Global health status (GHS) was the primary QoL 
variable of interest. Any absolute change from baseline greater than 10 points was considered a clinically 
meaningful difference. 
For global health status (GHS), the completion rate (i.e. patients of the FAS with a non-missing score) 
decreased with each visit in the two treatment groups as treatment discontinuations reduced the sample 
size. Among patients expected to complete the questionnaire i.e. still on treatment, the compliance rate 
was ≥ 86% across the timepoints up to cycle 11 (questionnaire completed by 34 patients in FTD/TPI + Bev 
group, 6 patients FTD/TPI group) and similar in the two treatments groups, except at cycle 7 with lower 
compliance rate in the FTD/TPI + Bev group than in the FTD/TPI group (86.2% vs 100%, respectively). The 
reasons for non-completion were mostly questionnaire not available, institutional error or other reasons. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 32/71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Considering any absolute change from baseline greater than 10 points as a clinically meaningful 
difference, no relevant change was detected in mean scores for the GHS in either group during 
treatment, as well as for the functioning and symptom/single items, except for appetite loss at cycle 4: 
mean change of 9.0 ± 26.5 in the FTD/TPI + Bev group and 11.2 ± 32.7 in the FTD/TPI group. 
The comparison of the two treatment groups with respect to changes from baseline of the QoL scores 
was performed longitudinally over time using a repeated-measures mixed-effects model analysis. The 
terms included in the model were treatment groups, baseline stratification factors, baseline score and 
assessment timepoints. Results did not show clinically relevant between-group difference for any of the 
QoL items and no clinically relevant difference in treatment effect across all assessment timepoints was 
found. 
EQ-5D-5L 
Among patients of the FAS with evaluable EQ-5D-5L assessment, questionnaire and VAS completion 
rates decreased with each visit post-baseline, due to stopping study treatment because of disease 
progression. The reasons for non-compliance were the same as for the EORTC QLQ-C30. 
At baseline, the median EQ-5D-5L utility score were almost identical in the two treatment groups: 0.942 
in the FTD/TPI + Bev group; 0.940 in the FTD/TPI group. Up to cycle 8, the median change from baseline 
in EQ-5D-5L score was null in the two groups. Based on a visual analogue scale (VAS) score, also no 
clinically relevant change from baseline was detected at post-baseline timepoints in either group.

o  Exclusion criteria #37: previously received FTD/TPI. 
This OS analysis showed a HR of 0.59 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.74) and median OS of 10.8 months (95% CI: 
9.56,12.12) for the FTD/TPI + Bev group vs 7.2 months (95% CI: 6.31, 8.51) for the FTD/TPI group 
(p < 0.001; stratified log-rank test). 
These two sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis of OS in the FAS. 
Additional estimand based on OS: new anticancer therapy  
Overall, in the FAS, 44.9% of patients received at least one new anticancer therapy with similar 
frequency in the FTD/TPI + Bev group than in the FTD/TPI group: 43.9% vs 45.9%. 
Additional analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of the study treatment without taking into 
account any potential effects of the administration of new anticancer therapy by censoring survival at 
the initiation of new anticancer therapy. 
This OS analysis demonstrated a HR of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.55) and median OS of 14.5 months 
(95% CI: 10.41, upper bound not calculated) vs 7.8 months (95% CI: 6.21, 8.77), respectively, (p < 
0.001; stratified log-rank test). 
- For progression free survival 
Sensitivity analyses of PFS were performed taking into account clinical progression and administration 
of new anticancer therapy. As shown in Table 10, the results of all sensitivity analyses were 
statistically significant and consistent with the primary analysis of PFS in the FAS population.

Subgroup analyses for overall survival 
OS was analysed across the stratification subgroups and for additional subgroups as pre-specified in 
the SAP. The results of these analyses are summarised in Figure 5. 
The HRs were consistently in favour of the FTD/TPI + Bev treatment group in all subgroups examined, 
including the stratification factors subgroups, and ranging from 0.33 to 0.85.

For some subgroups (1 prior metastatic drug regimen, BRAF mutant, MSI-H, no subsequent 
regorafenib), the results should be interpreted with caution due to small sample sizes.

Additional analyses 
A supplementary analysis for ORR and DCR was performed in all patients of the FAS with measurable 
disease (at least one target lesion) at baseline and with at least one tumour evaluation while on 
treatment (222/246 patients in the FTD/TPI + Bev group and 215/246 patients in the FTD/TPI group). 
Results were similar to those of the overall FAS population: ORR was 6.3% in the FTD/TPI + Bev group (14 
patients, all with PR) vs 0.9% in the FTD/TPI group (2 patients, both with PR).

Primary Analysis 
All randomised patients (full analysis set, FAS) received study treatment as 
assigned at randomisation. As of clinical DCO, 36 (7.3%) patients were still on 
treatment (13.0% in the FTD/TPI + bevacizumab group, 1.6% in the FTD/TPI 
group). The primary endpoint was analysed in the FAS using the intent to 
treat principle. 
The median follow-up duration at DCO for analysis of the primary endpoint 
was 14.1 months. 
The study started on 25 November 2020 (first visit of first patient) and the 
last patient was randomized on 18 February 2022.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy data for the current application come from the single pivotal trial CL3-95005-007 or 
SUNLIGHT (NCT04737187). This was a multinational, open-label, two-arm, randomised phase 3 study 
comparing treatment with FTD/TPI in combination with bevacizumab to FTD/TPI monotherapy in 
patients with refractory mCRC. Treatment with FTD/TPI and with bevacizumab followed the doses and 
dosing schedule of the already approved other indications in advanced CRC, which is considered 
acceptable. Treatment could be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. FTD/TPI 
could be continued as monotherapy in case of intolerable toxicity of bevacizumab, but bevacizumab 
monotherapy was not allowed. 
All patients had to have received a maximum of two chemotherapy regimens, including the standard 
available treatments including a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and a monoclonal antibody 
targeting either VEGF or EGFR (for patients with a KRAS-wildtype tumour). This third line treatment 
setting is consistent with the approved indication for FTD/TPI monotherapy. This comparator can 
therefore be considered adequate. 
The patient population for the SUNLIGHT study consisted of patients relatively fit for the third-line 
disease setting, reflected by an ECOG-PS of 0 or 1, the ability to have received all available standard 
treatment options for advanced CRC and the absence of significant comorbidity. Patients with severe 
renal impairment were excluded from the trial, eGFR as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation had 
to be ≥50 ml/min. Some other exclusion criteria are related to known bevacizumab toxicity, such as 
recent thrombo-embolic events, non-healed wounds, uncontrolled hypertension and proteinuria. 
Most patients included in the trial were from Europe. The trial included the planned number of 
participants in 15 months at 102 sites. Of the total of 492 randomised patients (i.e. the full analysis 
set, FAS), 246 were assigned to FTD/TPI + bevacizumab and 246 were assigned to FTD/TPI. 
The used stratification factors for randomisation (geographic region, time since first metastasis 
diagnosis (< 18 months, ≥ 18 months) and RAS status) are acceptable as they are related to 
prognosis. It has become clear in recent literature that the location of the primary tumour (left or right 
sidedness) is also prognostic and might also be predictive of the effect of chemotherapy treatment in 
advanced CRC, however, the criterium ‘time since first metastasis diagnosis’ also reflects possible 
differences in inherent disease course. 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal study was overall survival, which is the most relevant endpoint 
considering the poor prognosis of the included patients in a last line treatment setting. There was no 
placebo for bevacizumab in the comparator arm (open-label design). The fact that treating physicians 
were aware of the assigned treatment arm, could influence their response assessments and timing of 
declaring clinical or radiological disease progression. This hampers the interpretation of investigator-
assessed PFS, the key secondary endpoint of the trial. 
The proposal to specify a treatment policy estimand approach for both OS and PFS is agreed. For 
the secondary estimand approach for OS, data collected after any use of additional anti-cancer 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 38/71 
 
 
 
 
 
medication are not included in the analysis through the use of censoring. The Applicant describes this 
as a “while on treatment” estimand, however, it is considered to more closely represent a hypothetical 
estimand approach (i.e. if patients had not received additional anti-cancer medication). For OS the 
primary estimand of interest is the treatment policy estimand and therefore this secondary estimand 
for OS is not considered relevant for the assessment. For PFS the decision to censor patients lost to 
follow up or without a post-baseline tumour assessment may lead to informative censoring. Given the 
trial is open-label, the additional estimand approach for PFS, in which clinical progression and 
administration of further anti-cancer therapies are counted as events is considered relevant for the 
assessment. The PFS analysis in which patients are censored upon receiving anti-cancer therapy or 
progress or die after 2 or more missed assessments is not relevant to the CHMP assessment. 
A rather large proportion of patients that had given informed consent for participation in the trial were 
not included due to not meeting the eligibility criteria (25%). Most screen failures were because of not 
having received a maximum of 2 prior chemotherapy treatments, including all standard treatment 
lines, and showing PD or intolerance to the last regimen. Also, many patients did not have adequate 
organ function as defined in the protocol, and some did not have an adequate performance status 
during the entire screening period. These are the inclusion criteria which have led to a selected, 
relatively fit patient population. All included patients were randomised and treated with the assigned 
therapy. At the clinical DCO, only a small proportion of patients was still on treatment (13.6% for 
FTD/TPI + bevacizumab and 1.6% for FTD/TPI monotherapy). The main reason was disease 
progression. 
There was one global protocol amendment including substantial changes to the protocol, which was 
issued shortly (1 month) after the first patient was included. The statistical analysis plan was amended 
once, this amendment is dated 6 months after the last patient was included in the study but before the 
database lock. Both amendments appear not to impact the (interpretation of the) results. The 
frequency of important protocol deviations was similar between treatment groups both before and 
after inclusion to the study. It is considered unlikely that these protocol deviations have influenced the 
study results in a relevant manner. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The data cut-off dates were 05 July 2022 for clinical data (i.e. non-survival) and 19 July 2022 
(occurrence of 331st death) for survival data. The median follow-up duration was 14.1 months. 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint of OS showed a statistically significant longer median OS 
in the patients treated with FTD/TPI with bevacizumab compared to FTD/TPI monotherapy, with a HR 
of 0.61 (95% CI: 0.49 -0.77) and a p<0.001 by stratified log-rank test, which was lower than the 
target p-value (p<0.025) that was prespecified to reach statistical significance. The OS Kaplan-Meier 
curves for both treatment arms separate early and stay separated throughout the follow-up period of 
the trial. The observed 3.3 months difference in median OS (10.8 versus 7.5 months) can be 
considered clinically relevant in this last-line patient population without other relevant treatment 
options. 
Consent withdrawal and lost-to-follow-up of a few percent seems reassuring. It is noted in the protocol 
that “If all these attempts to contact the patient fail, the investigator can then declare the patient “lost 
to follow-up”. Most patients had been followed up for OS within 6 months of data cut-off and there was 
no indication of different censoring patterns among the treatment arms though. 
Two sensitivity analyses for OS in the FAS were performed: an unstratified analysis and an analysis 
excluding patients that should have been excluded from participating in the trial based on the 
exclusion criteria. These two analyses showed results consistent with the primary analysis. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 39/71 
 
 
 
 
subgroup analysis for OS does not raise any concerns regarding a possible lack of effect in certain 
subgroups of patients. This includes the subgroup of patients that were previously treated with the 
VEGF-inhibitor bevacizumab (72% of patients). 
The key secondary endpoint of PFS showed a statistically significant longer PFS in the patients treated 
with FTD/TPI with bevacizumab compared to FTD/TPI monotherapy, with a HR of 0.44 (95% CI: 0.36 -
0.54) and a p<0.001 by stratified log-rank test, which was lower than the target p-value (p<0.025) for 
statistical significance. Median PFS was 3.2 months longer with the addition of bevacizumab to FTD/TPI 
chemotherapy (5.6 versus 2.4 months). Because of the open-label design of the trial, the additional 
estimand approach for PFS, in which clinical progression and administration of further anti-cancer 
therapies are counted as events, is considered to be of relevance. This additional analysis shows the 
same hazard ratio and almost the same estimates for median PFS as the primary analysis. 
Only the primary and key secondary endpoint were type-1 error controlled, therefore the analyses of 
the additional secondary endpoints are considered descriptive. 
Overall response rate was low both for FTD/TPI monotherapy (3 patients, 1.2%) and for FTD/TPI 
with bevacizumab (15 patients, 6.1%). The percentage of patients with stable disease was numerically 
higher for the combination therapy (63.4% versus 40.7%). The result of the addition of bevacizumab 
to FTD/TPI therefore mainly appears to be prolongation of disease stabilisation. 
The interpretation of the results of the analysis for ‘time to worsening of ECOG-PS’ should be done 
cautiously, because the open-label design of the trial might have influenced the evaluation of this 
endpoint. 
With regards to the QoL endpoints, the analysis of global health status (GHS) as change from baseline 
was the primary variable of interest. Any absolute change from baseline greater than 10 points was 
considered a clinically meaningful difference. No relevant change was detected in mean scores for GHS 
in either group during treatment (within group differences) and there were also no clinically relevant 
between-group differences in GHS. It should be noted that the open-label design of the trial might 
have influenced the evaluation of QoL by the patients as well as the investigators. It is also not clear 
how missing data was handled in this analysis. The results of the QoL analysis, therefore, do not 
qualify for inclusion in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The SUNLIGHT inclusion criteria explicitly specified that the prior anticancer treatments had to include 
a fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody and/or an anti-EGFR 
monoclonal antibody (for patients with a RAS wild type tumour). This is adequately reflected in the 
indication wording. The previous therapies are also specified in the already approved indication for 
Lonsurf monotherapy. Of note, the two mCRC indications were not combined because of the wording 
“patients ... not considered candidates for, available therapies” included in the monotherapy indication 
(Lonsurf SmPC). Such patients were not allowed to enrol in SUNLIGHT and seeing the additional 
toxicity of adding bevacizumab to Lonsurf the positive B/R cannot be extrapolated to such patients.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The addition of bevacizumab to FTD/TPI monotherapy showed a statistically significant and clinically 
relevant 3.3 months longer median OS in patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer who had 
received two prior anticancer treatment regimens including fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and 
Assessment report

irinotecan based chemotherapies, anti-VEGF agents, and/or anti-EGFR agents. The OS outcome is 
supported by the secondary endpoint of PFS. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI), also named S95005, TAS-102 or Lonsurf, was approved as 
monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with previously treated advanced metastatic colorectal 
cancer (mCRC). Bevacizumab (Bev) is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy 
approved for various oncology indications, including treatment of mCRC in combination with 
fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. 
The known adverse drug reactions (ADRs) observed for FTD/TPI at rates ≥1/10 are neutropenia, 
leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.  
For bevacizumab the reported ADRs are: hypertension, gastrointestinal perforation, 
bleeding/haemorrhages, arterial/venous thromboembolic events, proteinuria and wound healing 
complication. 
The safety data discussed below in this document are based on the single pivotal study CL3-95005-007 
(SUNLIGHT; NCT04737187). 
Standard safety monitoring was performed (vital signs, haematology and chemistry laboratory tests, 
electrocardiogram [ECG]) and AEs were graded using Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Event 
(CTCAE) Version 5.0.  
Patient exposure 
The data cut-off dates were 05 July 2022 for clinical data (i.e. non-survival) and 19 July 2022 
(occurrence of 331st death) for survival data. As of the clinical cut-off date, the mean ± SD (median) 
treatment duration was longer in the FTD/TPI + Bev group than in the FTD/TPI group: 6.1 ± 4.3 (5.0) 
months vs 3.4 ± 2.5 (2.1) months (Table 13).

Adverse events 
Emergent AEs on treatment (EAEs) are defined as AEs with onset or worsening during the treatment 
period as defined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) of the SUNLIGHT study i.e. between the first 
study treatment intake and up to 30 days after the last study treatment intake.  
For the safety analysis, the follow-up period was defined as the time from the 31st day after the last 
treatment intake and up to the patient study withdrawal. An overall summary for emergent adverse 
events in the Safety Set (N = 492) is provided in Table 15.

Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
AESI are known adverse reactions associated with FTD/TPI or bevacizumab. For each AESI, analysis 
was performed based on a list of pre-defined PTs of similar medical concept, including Standard 
MedDRA Queries (SMQ) for bevacizumab. 
AESI for FTD/TPI 
Bone marrow suppression events 
Overall, incidence of bone marrow suppression events did not show relevant between-group difference 
(between-group difference < 10%: 80.9% in the FTD/TPI + Bev group vs 73.2% in the FTD/TPI 
group). Regarding the categories of EAEs, incidences were higher in the FTD/TPI + Bev than FTD/TPI 
group for treatment-related events, severe events, treatment-related severe events, and events 
leading to treatment delayed and events leading to treatment delayed/dose reduction (between-group 
difference > 5%). 
Infections 
Infection events that occurred in ≥ 2 patients (0.8%) in either group are shown by PT in Table 17. 
Incidences of events did not show relevant between-group differences, neither for overall infection 
events (between-group difference < 10%: 30.9% in the FTD/TPI + Bev group vs 23.2% in the FTD/TPI 
group) nor for the EAE categories (between-group difference < 5%). Fatal infections occurred in 2.0% 
of patients in the FTD/TPI + Bev group and 0.8% in the FTD/TPI group; none of these were considered 
treatment-related.

Gastrointestinal events 
No gastrointestinal perforation events were reported in the FTD/TPI group. The incidence of 
gastrointestinal perforation events was 2.4% in the FTD/TPI + Bev group. The incidence was 1.6% for 
treatment-related events.  
Overall incidence of gastrointestinal events did not show a relevant between-group difference (< 10%: 
48.4% in the FTD/TPI + Bev group vs 41.1% in the FTD/TPI group). Regarding the categories of EAEs, 
incidence was higher in the FTD/TPI + Bev than FTD/TPI group for treatment-related events 
(between-group difference > 5%). 
AESIs for bevacizumab 
The following AESIs are associated with bevacizumab: hypertension, gastrointestinal perforation, 
bleeding/haemorrhages, arterial/venous thromboembolic events, proteinuria and wound healing 
complication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 46/71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall incidence for each of these bevacizumab AESIs was higher with the combination FTD/TPI 
plus bevacizumab than FTD/TPI monotherapy. However, between-group differences were all < 10% 
with greatest differences observed for hypertension (11.0% vs 2.0, respectively) and haemorrhages 
(11.8% vs 3.7%, respectively). No gastrointestinal perforation events were reported in the FTD/TPI 
group. 
In the FTD/TPI + Bev group the incidence of gastrointestinal perforation events was 2.4%. The 
incidence of severe gastrointestinal perforation events was 1.6%. 
The incidence of haemorrhagic events was higher in the FTD/TPI + Bev than FTD/TPI group (11.8% vs 
3.7%), as well as for incidence of treatment-related events (5.3% vs none). The incidence of 
thromboembolic events was 4.9% in the FTD/TPI + Bev group and 3.7% in the FTD/TPI group. 
Treatment-related thromboembolic events occurred at 2.8% in the FTD/TPI + Bev group and none 
occurred in the FTD/TPI group. 
Overall, incidence of proteinuria AEs was 6.1% in the FTD/TPI + Bev and 1.2% in the FTD/TPI group. 
Treatment-related proteinuria events were reported only in the FTD/TPI + Bev group in 4.9% of 
patients.  
No wound healing complication events were reported. 
For patients treated with the combination FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab, the rates of severe AESIs were 
< 2%, except for hypertension (6.1%), and the rates for AESIs leading to treatment withdrawal or 
treatment modification were ≤ 2%. 
Analysis of treatment-related emergent adverse events 
For patients who received the combination FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab, treatment-related EAEs 
described are events considered related to the combination i.e. related to FTD/TPI and/or bevacizumab 
(i.e. FTD/TPI only or bevacizumab only or both FTD/TPI and bevacizumab), unless specified otherwise.  
Treatment-related EAEs with incidence ≥ 5% in either group are presented by PT in Table 18. 
When FTD/TPI was combined with bevacizumab, treatment-related EAEs were consistent with the 
known adverse reactions of FTD/TPI monotherapy and bevacizumab.  
Among other treatment-related EAEs, hypertension occurred at higher frequency in the FTD/TPI + Bev 
group than FTD/TPI group: 7.3% vs none.

(8.1%) in the FTD/TPI group. Treatment-related SEAEs that occurred in more than 2 (0.8%) patients 
were febrile neutropenia and anaemia (0.4% vs 2.4% for each). 
Deaths 
The data cut-off dates were 05 July 2022 for clinical data (i.e. non-survival) and 19 July 2022 
(occurrence of 331st death) for survival data. 
As of the survival cut-off, 331 deaths were reported and used for the overall survival primary analysis. 
For the safety analysis, only deaths that occurred as of the clinical cut-off date are described in this 
section.  
As of the clinical cut-off, a total of 323 patients had died: 59.4% of patients in the FTD/TPI + Bev 
group and 72.0% of patients in the FTD/TPI group (Table 20).

Deaths were reported either as fatal outcome of EAE or as withdrawal reason from the follow-up 
period. Fatal EAEs occurred during the treatment period, but the resulting death could have occurred 
during either the treatment period or the follow-up period.  
Analysis of fatal EAEs 
The analysis of EAEs leading to death is presented by system organ class (SOC) and PT in Table 21. 
Fatal EAEs occurred during the treatment period, but the resulting death could have occurred during 
either treatment period or follow-up period. The percentage of patients who experienced a fatal EAE 
(regardless of whether death occurred during treatment or follow-up period) was lower in the FTD/TPI 
+ Bev group than in the FTD/TPI group: 5.3% vs 11.0% (Table 21). Fatal EAEs reported in more than 
one patient were malignant neoplasm progression (2.4% vs 4.5%), hepatic failure (none vs 1.2%), 
septic shock (0.8% vs none), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and cachexia (none vs 0.8% for 
each). Deaths due to reason(s) other than disease progression occurred in 5 patients in the FTD/TPI + 
Bev group (due to abdominal sepsis, septic shock, COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, and cardiac 
failure congestive), and in 5 patients in the FTD/TPI group (due to COVID-19, respiratory failure, 
cerebrovascular accident, cardiac failure acute and death [as PT]).

Adverse events were coded using MedDRA 25.0 
Note: EAEs leading to death during the follow-up period were as follows:  
- 2 patients (0.8%) in the FTD/TPI + Bev group: cardiac failure congestive and malignant neoplasm progression (1 patient each) 
- 5 patients (2.0%) in the FTD/TPI group: malignant neoplasm progression (2 patients), general physical health deterioration, cachexia and 
cerebrovascular accident (1 patient each). 
Deaths which resulted from fatal EAEs were predominantly due to disease progression for 8 out of 13 
patients in the FTD/TPI + Bev group and 22 out of 27 patients in the FTD/TPI group (Table 22). None 
of the deaths were treatment-related in either treatment group.

Deaths during the follow-up period 
Out of the 286 patients who died during follow-up period, most of the deaths were attributed to 
progressive disease: 96.2% in the FTD/TPI + Bev group and 93.3% in the FTD/TPI group. For 5 
patients (3.8%) in the FTD/TPI + Bev group and 10 patients (6.7%), the cause of death during follow-
up period was reported as ‘Other’. Among those deaths for ‘Other’ reason, one was reported as fatal 
outcome of an EAE in the FTD/TPI + Bev group (cardiac failure congestive). 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
The identification of ADRs and their frequency are based on: 
- For Lonsurf as monotherapy: the safety pool of 1114 patients consisting of 533 treated patients 
with metastatic colorectal cancer in the placebo-controlled Phase III (RECOURSE) clinical study, 335 
treated patients with metastatic gastric cancer in the placebo-controlled Phase III (TAGS) clinical study 
and 246 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in the controlled Phase III (SUNLIGHT) clinical 
study. 
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 30%) are neutropenia (53% [34% ≥ Grade 3]), nausea (31% 
[1% ≥ Grade 3]), fatigue (31% [4% ≥ Grade 3]), and anaemia (30% [11% ≥ Grade 3]). 
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) that resulted in treatment discontinuation, dose 
reduction, dose delay, or dose interruption were neutropenia, anaemia, fatigue, leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, diarrhoea, and nausea. 
- For Lonsurf in combination with bevacizumab: 246 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in 
the controlled Phase III (SUNLIGHT) clinical study. 
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 30%) are neutropenia (69% [48% ≥ Grade 3]), fatigue (35% 
[3% ≥ Grade 3]), and nausea (33% [1% ≥ Grade 3]). 
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) that resulted in treatment discontinuation, dose 
reduction, dose delay, or dose interruption of Lonsurf when used in combination with bevacizumab 
were neutropenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, nausea and anaemia. 
When Lonsurf is used in combination with bevacizumab, the frequency of the following adverse 
reactions was increased compared to Lonsurf as monotherapy: neutropenia (69% vs 53%), severe 
neutropenia (48% vs 34%), thrombocytopenia (24% vs 16%), stomatitis (11% vs 6%).

For patients who received the combination of FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab, when an event led to FTD/TPI 
withdrawal, bevacizumab also had to be withdrawn (bevacizumab monotherapy was not allowed); in 
this summary, EAEs leading to treatment withdrawal are those leading to FTD/TPI withdrawal. 
EAEs leading to treatment withdrawal were reported with the same frequency in both treatment groups 
(12.6%). These EAEs that occurred in more than 1 patient in either group were asthenia (3.3% in the 
FTD/TPI + Bev group vs 0.4% in the FTD/TPI group), or jaundice, decreased appetite, biliary 
dilatation, blood bilirubin increased, pain, anaemia, intestinal obstruction, malignant neoplasm 
progression, metastases to central nervous system and fatigue (each at a frequency of ≤ 0.8% in 
either group). 
Of note: EAEs leading to bevacizumab withdrawal were reported for 14.6% of patients in the FTD/TPI 
+ Bev group. These EAEs that occurred in more than 1 patient were asthenia (3.3%), pain, biliary 
dilatation, jaundice, blood bilirubin increased, decreased appetite, proteinuria and pulmonary 
embolism, each at frequency of 0.8% 
EAEs leading to treatment modification 
Overall, the most common EAEs leading to FTD/TPI treatment modification (delay, dose reduction or 
interruption) with the combination of FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab were either myelosuppressive events 
or, at a lower frequency, gastrointestinal disorders. Regarding incidence of those events leading to 
FTD/TPI treatment modification, between-group differences observed were ≤ 10%. 
In the FTD/TPI + Bev group, incidence of EAEs leading to bevacizumab temporary interruption was 
26.0%. The incidence of EAEs leading to bevacizumab treatment delay was 69.9%. As per study 
protocol, bevacizumab was not allowed to be administered alone in case of FTD/TPI dose delay. 
Consequently, the latter incidence of EAEs leading to bevacizumab treatment delay is consistent with 
the incidence of EAEs leading to FTD/TPI treatment delayed of similar magnitude (67.9%). 
Post marketing experience 
The combination of FTD/TPI and bevacizumab is currently not approved for the treatment of refractory 
mCRC in any region. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The randomised, open-label, controlled two-arm, Phase 3 SUNLIGHT study compared FTD/TPI + Bev to 
FTD/TPI monotherapy. The safety of the following dosing regimens is discussed: 
- 
FTD/TPI + Bev group: FTD/TPI at 35 mg/m² orally twice a day (BID), 5 days on/2 days off, over 2 
weeks, followed by a 14-day rest with bevacizumab (5 mg/kg, IV) administered every 2 weeks 
(Day 1 and Day 15). This treatment cycle was repeated every 4 weeks. 
- 
FTD/TPI group: FTD/TPI at 35 mg/m² orally twice a day (BID), 5 days on/2 days off, over 2 weeks. 
As of the clinical cut-off date, the mean ± SD (median) treatment duration was longer in the FTD/TPI 
+ Bev group than in the FTD/TPI group: 6.1 ± 4.3 (5.0) months vs 3.4 ± 2.5 (2.1) months. In the 
FTD/TPI + Bev group, 15.8% of patients initiated > 10 cycles of treatment compared to 2.4% of 
patients in the FTD/TPI group. The mean ± SD (median) relative dose intensity of FTD/TPI was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 61/71 
 
 
 
 
 
similar in the FTD/TPI + Bev and FTD/TPI groups: 85.0 ± 13.2 (88.3%) vs 87.2 ± 14.2 (90.4%), 
respectively; it was 86.9 ± 27.3 (87.6%) for bevacizumab in the FTD/TPI + Bev group. 
Editorial changes were introduced in the section 4.6 of the SmPC and section 2 of PL on fertility 
following the Safety Working Party (SWP) recommendations on the duration of contraception following 
the end of treatment with a genotoxic drug (EMA/CHMP/SWP/74077/2020 corr. 3). Patients who wish 
to conceive a child should be advised to seek reproductive counselling and cryo-conservation of either 
the ovum or sperm prior to starting Lonsurf treatment. 
Almost all patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) in the pivotal study. The adverse 
events of special interest (AESI) were the known adverse reactions associated with FTD/TPI or 
bevacizumab. The AESI for FTD/TPI were bone marrow suppression events, infections, gastrointestinal 
events. The AESI for bevacizumab were hypertension, gastrointestinal perforation, 
bleeding/haemorrhages, arterial/venous thromboembolic events, proteinuria and wound healing 
complication. 
The most frequent EAEs (> 20% in either group) reported were generally myelosuppressive and 
gastrointestinal events: neutropenia (62.2% in the FTD/TPI + Bev group vs 51.2% in the FTD/TPI 
group), nausea (37.0% vs 27.2%), anaemia (28.9% vs 31.7%), asthenia (24.2% vs 22.4%), fatigue 
(21.5% vs 16.3%), diarrhoea (20.7% vs 18.7%) and decrease appetite (20.3% vs 15.4%). Among 
those EAEs, the frequencies were similar in the two treatment groups, except for neutropenia, nausea 
and fatigue that occurred at higher frequencies in the FTD/TPI + Bev group (between-group difference 
> 5%). The safety profile of the combination FTD/TPI with bevacizumab was generally consistent with 
that of FTD/TPI monotherapy, except for an increased incidence of neutropenia events compared to 
FTD/TPI monotherapy, and with the of known safety profile of bevacizumab. The incidence of 
hypertension (as preferred term [PT]) was notably higher in the FTD/TPI + Bev (10.2%) than in the 
FTD/TPI group (2%). 
Incidences of infection events did not show relevant between-group differences, neither for overall 
infection events (between-group difference < 10%: 30.9% in the FTD/TPI + Bev group vs 23.2% in 
the FTD/TPI group) nor for the EAE categories (between-group difference < 5%). 
The percentage of patients who experienced severe (Grade ≥ 3) EAEs was similar in the FTD/TPI + 
Bev and FTD/TPI groups: 72.4% vs 69.5%. The most frequent (> 10% in either group) severe EAEs 
were neutropenia, which occurred at higher frequency in the FTD/TPI + Bev group (43.1% vs 32.1% in 
the FTD/TPI group) and anaemia, which occurred at lower frequency in the FTD/TPI + Bev group 
(6.1% vs 11.0% in the FTD/TPI group). 
The percentage of patients who experienced at least one treatment-related EAE was higher in the 
FTD/TPI + Bev group than in the FTD/TPI group: 90.7% vs 81.3%. The most frequent (> 20 % in 
either group) treatment-related EAEs were neutropenia, nausea and anaemia. Among those EAEs, 
neutropenia and nausea occurred at higher (between-group difference > 5%) frequency in the FTD/TPI 
+ Bev group than in the FTD/TPI group (neutropenia: 60.2% vs 48.4%; nausea: 33.3% vs 20.7%) 
and anaemia occurred with similar frequency in the two treatment groups (23.6% vs 25.2%). 
The percentage of patients who experienced severe treatment-related EAEs was higher in the 
FTD/TPI + Bev than FTD/TPI group: 58.9% vs 45.5%. The most frequent (> 5% in either group) 
severe treatment-related EAEs reported with > 2% between-group differences were neutropenia and 
neutrophil count decreased that occurred a higher frequency in the FTD/TPI + Bev group, and anaemia 
that occurred at lower frequency in the FTD/TPI + Bev group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 62/71 
 
 
 
 
The percentage of patients who experienced at least one serious EAE (SEAE) was lower in the 
FTD/TPI + Bev group than the FTD/TPI group (24.8% vs 31.3%). Treatment-related SEAEs were 
reported for 13 patients (5.3%) in the FTD/TPI + Bev group and 20 (8.1%) in the FTD/TPI group. 
Among other severe treatment-related EAEs, hypertension was reported with > 2% between-group 
difference: 4.1% in the FTD/TPI + Bev group while not reported in the FTD/TPI group; all those 
hypertension events were related to bevacizumab only, except 1 related both to FTD/TPI and 
bevacizumab. This was consistent with the known adverse reactions of bevacizumab. 
Fatal EAEs occurred during the treatment period, but the resulting death could have occurred during 
either treatment period or follow-up period. The percentage of patients who experienced at least one 
fatal EAE (regardless of whether death occurred during treatment or follow-up period) was lower in the 
FTD/TPI + Bev group than in the FTD/TPI group: 5.3% vs 11.0%. Deaths which resulted from fatal 
EAEs were predominantly due to disease progression. None of the deaths were treatment-related in 
either treatment group. 
Analysis of common EAEs indicated no unexpected safety signal. The safety profile of the combination 
FTD/TPI with bevacizumab was generally consistent with that of FTD/TPI monotherapy, except for an 
increased incidence of neutropenia events compared to FTD/TPI monotherapy. According to the study 
protocol hematologic support was based on the institutional site standards. The SmPC of FTD/TPI 
contains adequate precautions for use regarding the monitoring and treatment of bone marrow 
suppression. Serious infections have been reported following treatment with FTD/TPI. Given that the 
majority were reported in the context of bone marrow suppression, the patient’s condition should be 
monitored closely, and appropriate measures, such as antimicrobial agents and granulocyte-colony 
stimulating factor (G-CSF), should be administered as clinically indicated (Lonsurf SmPC). 
Severe EAEs were of higher frequency for patients ≥ 65 years (76.1%) than patients < 65 years 
(63.6%), also for treatment-related severe EAEs (53.0% vs 38.8%, respectively) in the FTD/TPI 
group. In the FTD/TPI + Bev group, serious EAEs were also more frequent for patients ≥ 65 years 
(31.0%) than patients < 65 years (20.5%). 
There were no differences of ≥ 10% between the subgroups of patients with ECOG PS = 0 and ECOG 
PS ≥ 1 for overall EAEs and by category, except a higher frequency of serious EAEs for patients with 
ECOG PS ≥ 1 than for patients with ECOG PS = 0 in both groups (29.9% vs 19.3% in FTD/TPI + Bev 
group; 36.4% vs 24.5% in the FTD/TPI group). 
Patients were required to have a creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min for inclusion in SUNLIGHT and 
there were 30 patients in the FTD/TPI + Bev group and 28 patients in the FTD/TPI group with a CrCl 
50 to 60 mL/min. An overall increase in toxicity seems apparent in both treatment arms for patients 
with baseline CrCl < 60 mL/min compared with patients with baseline CrCl ≥ 60 mL/min. Plus, for 
some EAEs there was a ≥ 10% higher frequency for patients with baseline CrCl < 60 mL/min than for 
patients with baseline CrCl ≥ 60 mL/min. However, due to small size of the subgroup with baseline 
CrCl < 60 mL/min for each treatment group, the between-subgroup differences should be interpreted 
with caution. The SmPC does not include specific recommendations for the starting dose of the 
combination of FTD/TPI + Bev in patients with renal impairment. According to the already included 
information in section 4.2 of the Lonsurf SmPC, no adjustment of the FTD/TPI starting dose is 
recommended in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 59 mL/min) and a reduced 
starting dose of FTD/TPI is recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to 29 
mL/min). These recommendations are considered acceptable. Of note, the safety and efficacy of 
bevacizumab have not been studied in patients with renal impairment (Avastin SmPC). 
EAE leading to discontinuation of FTD/TPI occurred in 12.6% of patients in both groups. 
Monotherapy with bevacizumab was not allowed. EAE leading to bevacizumab withdrawal occurred in 
14.6% of the patients. EAE leading to FTD/TPI treatment delay were slightly higher for FTF/TPI + Bev 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 63/71 
 
 
 
 
(67.9%) than for FTF/TPI (59.8%). EAE leading to FTD/TPI dose reduction occurred in 7.3% and 8.1% 
of the patients.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Adding bevacizumab to trifluridine/tipiracil resulted in limited additional toxicity. The overall safety 
profile of trifluridine/tipiracil in combination with bevacizumab did not result in unexpected safety 
findings compared to what is already known from the safety profiles of trifluridine/tipiracil or 
bevacizumab as monotherapy. The most frequent treatment-related EAEs (> 20% in either group) 
were myelosuppression (neutropenia, anaemia) and gastrointestinal (nausea) events with higher 
frequency in the FTD/TPI + Bev group vs FTD/TPI group for neutropenia and nausea. Treatment 
related hypertension was reported for 7.3% of patients treated with the combination FTD/TPI plus 
bevacizumab.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
“Lonsurf is indicated in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of adult patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have received two prior anticancer treatment regimens 
including fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapies, anti-VEGF agents, 
and/or anti-EGFR agents.”. 
The proposed posology for both components is in line with their approved posology (Lonsurf SmPC; 
Avastin SmPC). 
The recommended starting dose of Lonsurf in adults, as monotherapy or in combination with 
bevacizumab, is 35 mg/m2/dose administered orally twice daily on Days 1 to 5 and Days 8 to 12 of 
each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
When Lonsurf is used in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of metastatic CRC, the dose 
of bevacizumab is 5 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In patients with mCRC, chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment with the goal of prolonging overall 
survival. Standard treatments include (combinations of) a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and 
as applicable, anti-VEGF and/or anti-EGFR antibodies. Following progression after treatment with these 
standard chemotherapies the estimated OS with best supportive care alone is around 5 months. 
Treatments with limited efficacy in this third-line setting include regorafenib (a multitargeted tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor), FTD/TPI monotherapy, and for specific subgroups of patients, antibodies that target 
EGFR for patients with RAS wild-type tumours (if no prior exposure), and anti-programmed cell death 
protein 1 inhibitors for patients with microsatellite instability-high mCRC (Cervantes, 2022; NCCN, 
2019; NCCN, 2021) (Baldus, 2010). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical study 
The efficacy and safety data for the current application come from the single pivotal trial CL3-
95005-007 or SUNLIGHT (NCT04737187). This was a multinational, open-label, two-arm, randomized 
phase 3 study comparing treatment with FTD/TPI in combination with bevacizumab to FTD/TPI 
monotherapy in patients with refractory mCRC. 
The included patient population had an ECOG-PS of 0 or 1, and had to have received a maximum of 
two chemotherapy regimens, including the standard available treatments including a fluoropyrimidine, 
oxaliplatin, irinotecan and a monoclonal antibody targeting either VEGF or EGFR (for patients with a 
KRAS-wildtype tumour). 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal study was overall survival, the key secondary endpoint was 
investigator-assessed PFS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/221594/2023  
Page 67/71 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Median OS was 3.3 months longer with the addition of bevacizumab to FTD/TPI chemotherapy (10.8 
versus 7.5 months). This was a statistically significant difference, with a HR of 0.61 (95% CI: 0.49 -
0.77) and a p<0.001 by stratified log-rank test, which was lower than the target p-value (p<0.025) 
that was pre-specified to reach statistical significance. 
With 60.2% of events (deaths) in the FTD/TPI + Bev group and 74.4% in the FTD/TPI group, OS data 
can be considered mature. 
Two sensitivity analyses for OS showed results consistent with the primary analysis. Further. the 
subgroup analysis for OS does not raise any concerns regarding a possible lack of effect in certain 
subgroups of patients, including the subgroup of patients that were previously treated with the 
VEGF-inhibitor bevacizumab (72% of patients). 
Median investigator-assessed PFS was 3.2 months longer with the addition of bevacizumab to FTD/TPI 
chemotherapy (5.6 versus 2.4 months). This was a statistically significant difference, with a HR of 0.44 
(95% CI: 0.36 -0.54) and a p<0.001 by stratified log-rank test, which was lower than the target p-
value (p<0.025) for statistical significance. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The patient population for the SUNLIGHT study consisted of relatively fit patients, reflected by an 
ECOG-PS of 0 or 1, the ability to have received all available standard treatment options for advanced 
CRC in the first and second line and the absence of significant comorbidity. Patients with moderate and 
severe renal impairment were excluded from the trial, i.e. the eGFR as estimated by the Cockcroft-
Gault equation had to be ≥50 ml/min. It is uncertain whether the reported OS benefit can be 
extrapolated to less fit patients with comorbidity. These limitations have been reflected in the SmPC.  
The pivotal study was open label. The fact that treating physicians were aware of the assigned 
treatment arm, could influence their response assessments and timing of declaring clinical or 
radiological disease progression. In addition, for PFS the decision to censor patients lost to follow up or 
without a post-baseline tumour assessment may lead to informative censoring. Because of these 
problems, the additional estimand approach for PFS, in which clinical progression and administration of 
further anti-cancer therapies are counted as events, is considered to be of relevance. This additional 
analysis shows the same hazard ratio and almost the same estimates for median PFS as the primary 
analysis. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The incidence of AEs in the different AE categories for FTD/TPI + Bev vs FTD/TPI were: any EAE 98.0% 
vs 98.0%; TREAE 90.7% vs 81.3%; grade 3 EAE≥72.4% vs 69.5%; severe treatment-related EAEs 
58.9% vs 45.5%; SEAE 24.8% vs. 31.3%; TSEAEs 5.3% vs. 8.1%; EAEs leading to treatment 
withdrawal 12.6% vs 12.6% EAE leading to death 5.3% vs 11.0%. None of the deaths were considered 
treatment-related in either treatment group. 
The most frequently observed AEs for FTD/TPI + Bev were: neutropenia (62.2%), nausea (37.0%), 
anaemia (28.9%), asthenia (24.4%), fatigue (21.5%), and diarrhoea (20.7%). 
The frequencies of neutropenia (all grade: 62.2% vs 51.2%; grade ≥3 43.1% vs 32.1%), nausea 
(37.0% vs 27.2%) and fatigue (21.5% vs 16.3%) were higher in the FTD/TPI + Bev than in the 
FTD/TPI group, respectively.

The frequency of all grade hypertension was higher in the FTD/TPI + Bev than in the FTD/TPI group 
10.2% vs 2% (5.7% vs. 1.2% grade ≥3). 
An overall increase in toxicity seems apparent in both treatment arms for patients with baseline 
CrCl < 60 mL/min compared with patients with baseline CrCl ≥ 60 mL/min. Plus, for some EAEs there 
was a ≥ 10% higher frequency for patients with baseline CrCl < 60 mL/min than for patients with 
baseline CrCl ≥ 60 mL/min. 
There were no unexpected safety findings compared to the known safety profiles of trifluridine/tipiracil 
and bevacizumab.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The patient population for the SUNLIGHT study consisted of relatively fit patients, reflected by an 
ECOG-PS of 0 or 1, the ability to have received all available standard treatment options for advanced 
CRC and the absence of significant comorbidity. Nevertheless, in the target patient population the 
observed 3.3-month difference in median OS (10.8 versus 7.5 months) can be considered clinically 
relevant, because it concerns a last-line treatment setting without other relevant treatment options. 
The reported OS-benefit cannot be extrapolated to less fit patients with comorbidity, but the study 
population is adequately described in the SmPC. 
The key secondary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS provides support for the primary endpoint, 
with a median invPFS that was 3.2 months longer with the addition of bevacizumab to FTD/TPI 
chemotherapy (5.6 versus 2.4 months). Because of the open-label design of the trial, the additional 
estimand approach for PFS, in which clinical progression and administration of further anti-cancer 
therapies are counted as events, is considered to be of relevance. This additional analysis shows the 
same hazard ratio and almost the same estimates for median PFS as the primary analysis. 
There were no unexpected safety findings in the assessment of emergent adverse events. The safety 
profile is consistent with the known safety profile of FTD/TPI monotherapy and bevacizumab. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The observed benefit in overall survival of 3.3 months for the addition of bevacizumab to FTD/TPI 
chemotherapy in fit patients with refractory mCRC outweighs the risks. No unexpected safety findings 
of the combination were observed. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Lonsurf is positive.

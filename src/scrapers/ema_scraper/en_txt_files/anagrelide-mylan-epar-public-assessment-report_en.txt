2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of anagrelide hydrochloride monohydrate is 6,7-dichloro-3,5-dihydroimidazo[2,1-b] 
quinazolin-2(1H)-one  hydrochloride  monohydrate  corresponding 
to 
the  molecular 
formula 
C10H7Cl2N3O·HCl·H2O. It has a relative molecular mass of 310.56 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: structure of anagrelide hydrochloride monohydrate 
The chemical structure of anagrelide hydrochloride monohydrate was elucidated by a combination of 1H 
and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy and x-ray 
powder diffraction (XRPD). 
The  active  substance  is  a  white  to  off-white,  non-hygroscopic,  crystalline  powder.  It  exhibits  pH-
dependent solubility, being only slightly soluble between pH 3-10.  
Although  two  polymorphic  forms  are  known,  the  manufacturing  process  routinely  produces  the  most 
thermodynamically stable form which is the proposed commercial form. The polymorphic forms can be 
distinguished by XRPD. No change in polymorphic form was observed at the end of the stability studies 
under long term and accelerated conditions. 
Anagrelide is achiral. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Anagrelide  hydrochloride  hydrate  is  synthesized  from  well-defined  starting  materials  with  acceptable 
specifications. It is considered that enough of the process has been included in the dossier and carried 
out under GMP such that the fate and purge of impurities can be understood. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well  discussed  with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
An assessment of potentially genotoxic compounds was carried out in silico in line with ICH M7. All of 
the starting materials and an intermediate gave structural alerts. The purge of these materials is well 
understood  and  suitable  limits  have  been  set  in  either  intermediates  or  the  active  substance  in  line 
with published guidance. 
The potential for metal contaminants was also assessed. Data shows that metals used in the synthetic 
process are purged to levels well below the permitted daily exposure (PDE) and so no specific control is 
deemed necessary. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.

The primary packaging complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identity  (IR,  HPLC),  identity  of 
chloride  counter  ion  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC,  UPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  water 
content  (KF),  sulphated  ash  (Ph.  Eur.),  and  particle  size  distribution  (Ph.  Eur.).  There  is  no  Ph.  Eur. 
monograph  for  anagrelide.  However,  a  USP  monograph  does  exist  and  the  specification  has  been 
based on that. 
Impurities  present  at  higher  than  the  qualification  threshold  according  to  ICH  Q3A  were  qualified  by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. Genotoxic impurities are 
controlled in line with ICH M7. 
A test for microbial contamination is not included as no microbes were found in any of the production 
batches. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  data  from  three  production  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  were  provided.  The 
results were within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (5±3 oC) and for up 
to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were 
provided. In addition, 9 months’ long term data and 6 months’ accelerated data was provided from 1 
production  scale  and  2  more  pilot  scale  batches.  Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  identification, 
water content, assay and impurities. No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were 
observed under either set of conditions. 
Photostability  testing  following  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B  was  performed  on  one  pilot  scale  batch.  No 
changes  to  any  of  the  measured  parameters  were  observed  indicating  that  the  active  substance  is 
photostable. 
The  active  substance  was  exposed  to  stressed  conditions  including  acid,  base  and  oxidants.  Samples 
degraded  under  all  conditions,  more  so  in  the  presence  of  base  or  acid.  The  results  indicate  that  the 
analytical methods, which are also the release methods, are stability indicating. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months at 5±3 oC in the 
proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Anagrelide Mylan capsules contain anagrelide hydrochloride monohydrate, equivalent to either 0.5 or 1 
mg of anagrelide freebase. The different strengths are distinguished by colour. 
The  aim  of  development  was  to  produce  an  oral  solid  dosage  form  of  anagrelide  with  similar  in  vivo 
performance to the originator product Xagrid. In the EU, only a 0.5 mg capsule of Xagrid is marketed. 
However,  since  the  recommended  initial  posology  is  1  mg  per  day,  the  applicant  developed  an 
additional  1  mg  capsule.  The  formulation  is  based  on  that  of  Xagrid  capsules,  but  without  full 
quantitative  knowledge  of  the  various  excipients  or  the  active  substance  polymorphic  form.  The 
applicant therefore conducted investigations to compare the proposed product with Xagrid in terms of 
physical characteristics, dissolution behaviour, impurities content and excipients. 
The  active  substance  is  a  BCS  class  IV  molecule  with  low  solubility  and  permeability.  Accordingly, 
dissolution  rate  is  likely  to  impact  absorption  and  thus,  particle  size  of  the  active  substance  was 
investigated  in  relation  to  its  dissolution  rate.  A  suitable  particle  size  distribution  (PSD)  was  found 
which affords a similar dissolution profile to Xagrid across the physiological pH range. Accordingly, the 
active substance is micronized and a suitable limit for particle size is included in its specification, in line 
with the clinical batch and in vitro dissolution data. 
Excipients  were  chosen  based  on  those  in  Xagrid  and  include  a  diluent,  binder,  lubricant  and 
disintegrant.  However,  a  different  disintegrant,  (croscarmellose  sodium  as  opposed  to  crospovidone) 
was  selected.  Compatibility  of  the  active  substance  with  the  various  excipients  was  demonstrated 
during  stability  studies.  All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is 
compliant  with  Ph.  Eur.  standards.  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this 
report. 
Bioequivalence  between  1  mg  Anagrelide  Mylan  capsules  and  0.5  mg  Xagrid  capsules  was 
demonstrated clinically. A biowaiver was claimed for the 0.5 mg Anagrelide Mylan capsule since it has 
the same relative qualitative and quantitative composition as the 1 mg capsule and is produced by the 
same manufacturer and process. Dissolution profiles for the 0.5 and 1 mg capsules were determined at 
pH  1,  4.5  and  6.8.  At  pH  1,  complete  dissolution  occurred  within  15  minutes  whereas  at  pH  4.5  and 
6.8, profiles were observed to be similar based on f2 values. Therefore, the biowaiver is acceptable. 
The  dissolution  method  selected  uses  the  basket  apparatus  commonly  employed  for  capsule 
formulations. Discriminatory power was investigated by comparing standard batches with capsules with 
meaningful differences in formulation . The method was able to distinguish between batches within the 
specified time frame. 
The  primary  packaging  is  an  HDPE  bottle  with  tamper-evident  child-resistant  PP  closures  with 
desiccant. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  six  main  steps:  blending  of  intra-granular  excipients; 
granulation;  drying  and  milling  of  granules;  blending  with  extra-granular  excipients;  encapsulation; 
Assessment report  
EMA/63484/2018  
Page 11/23 
 
 
 
 
 
packaging.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard  manufacturing  process  due  to  the  low 
content of active substance. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  on  production  scale  using  three 
consecutive  batches  of  common  blend  used  to  make  3  batches  of  each  strength.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner.  In-process controls (IPCs) are carried out.  The proposed in-process 
controls  (IPCs)  are  considered  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing  process  and  pharmaceutical 
form. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form 
including  appearance,  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  dissolution  (HPLC) 
and uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.).  
The  limits  for  impurities  and  assay  were  tightened during  the  procedure  on  the  request  of  CHMP  and 
are now considered acceptable. 
A  risk  assessment  was  carried  out  in  line  with  ICH  Q3D  to  determine  the  likelihood  of  any  elemental 
impurities  being  present  in  the  finished  product  based  on  contributions  from  the  active  substance, 
excipients,  primary  packaging  and  manufacturing  equipment.  The  levels  of  any  elemental  impurity 
potentially  present  was  determined  and  found  to  be  below  30%  of  the  PDE  for  all  batches  tested. 
Therefore, no limit for specific elemental impurities is included in the specification. 
Tests  for  water  content  and  microbiological  contamination  were  added  and  subsequently  tightened 
during the procedure at the request of CHMP. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  appropriately  validated  in 
accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference  standards  used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for three production scale batches of each strength confirming the 
consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to  manufacture  to  the  intended  product 
specification.  The  finished  product  is  released  on  the  market  based  on  the  release  specifications, 
through traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of both strengths of finished product stored for up to 
36  months  under  long  term  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  finished 
product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging 
proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for appearance, dissolution, water content, identification, 
assay,  impurities  and  microbial  contamination.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating 
and are the same (with the same limits) as used for release testing. No significant variability or trends 
were observed for any of the measured parameters under either set of conditions. 
In  addition,  one  batch  of  each  strength  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on 
Photostability  Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  Samples  of  0.5  mg  capsules  stored 
outside the primary packaging showed some degradation whereas samples stored within the packaging 
were stable. The 1 mg capsules were shown to be stable inside and outside the primary packaging.

In-use stability studies were carried out on two batches of 0.5 mg capsules previously stored for up to 
18 month under long term conditions. The in-use studies lasted 50 days, i.e. the full in-use shelf-life of 
the product given that bottles contain 100 capsules and the intended posology is 2 capsules per day. 
No  variability  or  trends  to  any  of  the  measured  parameters  were  observed.  Nonetheless,  given  the 
need for a desiccant in the bottle, the product should be stored in the original bottle in order to protect 
from moisture. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  of  36  months  without  any  temperature 
restriction is acceptable. The 1 mg capsule should be stored in the original package in order to protect 
from moisture, whereas the 0.5 mg capsule should be stored in the original package in order to protect 
from light and moisture, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3). 
Adventitious agents 
It  is  confirmed  that  the  lactose  is  produced  from  milk  from  healthy  animals  in  the  same  condition  as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform  Encephalopathy  Agents  Via  Human  and  veterinary  medicinal 
products. 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture is provided. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A  non-clinical  overview  on  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  has  been  provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need  to  generate  additional  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  data.  The 
Assessment report  
EMA/63484/2018  
Page 13/23 
 
 
 
 
 
non-clinical  aspects  of  the  SmPC  are  in  line  with  the  SmPC  of  the  reference  product.  The  impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  was  submitted.  This  was  justified  by  the  applicant  as  the 
introduction of Anagrelide Mylan manufactured by Mylan S.A.S is considered unlikely to result in any 
significant  increase  in  the  combined  sales  volumes  for  all  anagrelide  containing  products  and  the 
exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not 
increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers the non-clinical dossier is acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers the non-clinical dossier is acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for hard capsules containing anagrelide hydrochloride monohydrate. To support 
the marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted one bioequivalence study with cross-
over design under fasting conditions.  
No  formal  scientific  advice  by  the  CHMP  was  given  for  this  medicinal  product.  For  the  clinical 
assessment  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioequivalence  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1)  in  its 
current version is of particular relevance. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
Exemption  
One  bioequivalence  study  was  conducted  on  the  1  mg  capsule  strength  under  fasting  conditions.  To 
fulfil the requirements of a biowaiver for lower strength, 0.5 mg hard capsule, dissolution testing was 
performed.  
The waiver is justified, since the following general biowaiver requirements are met: 
a) the pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturing process  
b) the qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same  
Assessment report  
EMA/63484/2018  
Page 14/23 
 
 
 
 
 
c) the composition of the strengths are quantitatively proportional  
d)  appropriate  in  vitro  dissolution  data  confirm  the  adequacy  of  waiving  additional  in  vivo 
bioequivalence testing. Dissolution profiles are considered similar, because more than 85% of the drug 
substance is dissolved within 15 minutes, or the similarity factor (f2) is between 50 and 100. 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study. 
A  randomized,  open-label,  single  dose,  two-period,  cross-over,  bioequivalence  study  comparing 
Anagrelide  (as  hydrochloride  monohydrate)  1  mg  hard  capsules  to  Xagrid  0.5  mg  hard  capsules  in 
healthy volunteers under fasting conditions. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Methods 
Study design  
Study  was  an  open-label,  laboratory-blinded,  randomized,  single  dose,  two-period,  two-treatment 
cross-over  bioequivalence  study  in  healthy  male  and  female  adult  subjects  under  fasting  conditions 
with  a  wash  out  period  of  7  days  between  two  administrations.  Each  study  period  included  a  drug 
administration  of  either  1  x  1  mg  hard  capsule  of  test  products  or  2  x  0.5  mg  hard  capsule  of  the 
reference product.  
Food and fluid intake 
Subjects  were  confined  to  the  clinical  facility  at  least  12  hours  prior  to  drug  administration  and 
remained at the study centre until their 8 hrs post-dose blood sample was collected. Study drug was 
taken  orally  after  a  10-hour  overnight  fast  with  200  ml  water.  Standard  meals  were  provided  at 
scheduled  times,  i.e.  at  10.5  hrs  before  and  4  and  6  hrs  after  the  dose.  Water  was  not  permitted  1 
hour  before  dosing  until  2  hours  post-dosing.  Subjects  were  free  to  drink  additional  fluids  from  4  hrs 
following the drug administration. 
 Sampling schedule 
17  blood  samples  were  collected  for  the  assessment  of  Anagrelide  in  plasma.  Blood  collections  were 
performed prior to the administration of study medication (0 pre-dose) and at 0.17, 0.33, 0.50, 0.67, 
0.83,  1.00,  1.25,  1.50,  1.75,  2.00,  2.50,  3.00,  4.00,  5.00,  6.00  and  8.00  hours  after  study  drug 
administration. Treatments were separated by a washout period of 7 days.

Reference  Product:  Xagrid  0.5  mg  hard  capsules  by  Shire  Pharmaceutical  Contracts  Ltd.,  UK 
(manufactured by Wasdell Packaging Limited, UK); Lot No.: A99167A/2 from UK market; expiry date: 
Sep 2016  
Anagrelide Mylan 0.5 mg and 1 mg manufactured by Synthon Hispania S.L Spain (batch No.: 140023, 
manufacturing date; February 2014, exp. date February 2015) has been compared to Xagrid 0.5 mg 
manufactured by Wasdell Packaging Limited, UK (Batch No: A99167A/2, exp. date: September 
2016). 
Populations studied 
A total of 44 healthy adult subjects (Caucasian race, aged 19 – 54 years, BMI 20.00 – 29.50, 22 male 
and 22 female subjects) were included in the study. Only non-smokers were allowed in this study.  
43  subjects  completed  both  study  phases  and  were  included  in  the  pharmacokinetic  and  statistical 
analysis. No major protocol deviations were reported. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were presented 
and were acceptable for a BE study and for the product under investigation. 
Drop outs: Subject No. 18 dropped out due to adverse events (mild restlessness, moderate headache, 
2 episodes of vomiting and weakness during the wash-out period of period 1). 
Analytical methods 
Plasma  concentrations  of  Anagrelide  were  determined  using  a  validated  reversed  phase  HPLC-MS/MS 
method.  Study  drugs  were  extracted  from  50  µl of plasma  by  protein  precipitation.  13C3D2-anagrelide 
was used as internal standards.  
Blood samples were collected into K2EDTA tubes and centrifuged. The plasma samples were frozen and 
retained at -20°C until assay.  
8  non-zero  calibrates  and  6  levels  of  QC  samples  containing  Anagrelide  were  used.  Calibration 
standards  ranged  from  0.075  ng/ml  to  12.000  ng/ml,  LOQ  was  0.075  ng/ml.  The  quality  control 
concentrations  were  0.220  (low),  4.000  (medium)  and  9.000  (high)  ng/ml  for  study  sample  analysis. 
For method validation, additional QC sample levels at 0.075, 1.500 and 12.000 ng/ml were used.  
The linear calibration curve calculated by weighted linear regression (weight = 1/c, where c is nominal 
concentration of the respective calibration sample) was used for calculation of sample concentration. 
Pre-study  validation  and  bio-analytical  report  are  presented.  The  method  selectivity  and  sensitivity 
were demonstrated. Stability of analytes at various conditions during storage, sample preparation and 
analysis  was  shown  according  to  the  requirements  for  bio-analytical  method  validation.  Dilution 
integrity, carryover and matrix effect were tested. Composition of analytical runs has been described.  
Incurred sample reanalysis was conducted on 131 samples (8.8 % of 1479 samples). 100% (131/131) 
of concentrations obtained by reanalysis were found within 20% of their mean initial value. 
The maximum study sample storage period from first blood draw to last sample analysis was less than 
30 days for Anagrelide. The long-term stability of Anagrelide in human plasma covers 91 days at -20°C 
and at -70°C.  
All concentration values below limit of quantification were set as zero for PK analysis.

Reanalysis of study samples: A total of 1479 study samples were analysed in 45 analytical runs. Fifty-
five (55 i.e. 3.7 %) samples were re-assayed for analytical reasons (above ULOQ, insufficient response 
of IS). 
Pharmacokinetic variables  
Primary variables: Cmax and AUC0-t. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, residual area, λz and t1/2 were determined.  
Statistical methods 
Pharmacokinetic  and  statistical  analyses  were  performed  using  Phoenix  WinNonlin  version  6.3,  SAS 
version 9.2 and MS Excel 2007 software. 
PK  parameters  for  each  individual  were  tabulated  and  graphically  presented.  Individual  AUC 
parameters  were  calculated  using  the  linear  trapezoidal  rule.  ANOVA  was  performed  on  the  ln-
transformed Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞. Non-parametric analysis of tmax was performed on untransformed 
data.  The  analysis  of  variance  model  included  sequence,  subject  nested  within  sequence,  period  and 
treatment (i.e. drug formulation) as the sources of variance.  
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence: 
The  ratio  of  geometric  least  squares  means  with  corresponding  90%  confidence  interval  calculated 
from the exponential of the difference between the Test and Reference product for the ln-transformed 
parameters Cmax and AUC0-t were all to be within the 80.00 to 125.00% bioequivalence range.

Safety data 
No serious adverse events (AEs) occurred. 
Twelve  (12)  subjects  experienced  a  total  of  thirty-two  (32)  mild  and  five  (5)  moderate  AEs  over  the 
course of the study. In total, there were ten (10) mild AEs considered related to the oral administration 
of  Anagrelide  1  mg  hard  capsules  and  twenty-two  (22)  mild  and  five  (5)  moderate  AEs  considered 
related to the oral administration of Xagrid® 0.5 mg hard capsules.  
The  most  commonly  reported  AE  was  “vomiting”  reported  by  27.9%  (n=12)  of  subjects.  Other  AEs 
reported were dizziness (8), headache (7), nausea (5), weakness (2), palpitations (2) and restlessness 
(1). 
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study, Anagrelide Mylan is considered bioequivalent with 
Xagrid.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This  application  concerns  a  generic  medicinal  product  containing  0.5  mg  anagrelide  as  well  as  a 
Assessment report  
EMA/63484/2018  
Page 21/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hybrid  medicinal  product  containing  1  mg  anagrelide,  both  referring  to  the  centrally  authorised 
product Xagrid as reference product. 
Xagrid is indicated for the reduction of elevated platelet counts in at risk essential thrombocythaemia 
(ET)  patients  who  are  intolerant  to  their  current  therapy  or  whose  elevated  platelet  counts  are  not 
reduced  to  an  acceptable  level  by  their  current  therapy.  An  at  risk  essential  thrombocythaemia 
patient  is  defined  by  one  or  more  of  the  following  features:  > 60 years  of  age  or  a  platelet  count 
> 1,000 x 109/l or a history of thrombo-haemorrhagic events. 
No  nonclinical  studies  have  been  provided  for  this  application  but  an  adequate  summary  of  the 
available  nonclinical  information  for  the  active  substance  was  presented  and  considered  sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview  on  these  clinical  aspects  based  on  information  from  published  literature  was  considered 
sufficient. 
The  bioequivalence  study  forms  the  pivotal  basis  with  a  cross-over  design  under  fasting  conditions. 
The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was 
in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling 
time  as  well  as  wash-out  period  were  adequate.  The  analytical  method  was  validated. 
Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The  test  formulation  of  Anagrelide  Mylan  met  the  protocol-defined  criteria  for  bioequivalence  when 
compared  with  Xagrid.  The  point  estimates  and  their  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  parameters 
AUC0-t,  AUC0-72h,  and  Cmax  were  all  contained  within  the  protocol-defined  acceptance  range  of 
[range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Anagrelide Mylan is favourable in the following indication: 
Anagrelide  is  indicated  for  the  reduction  of  elevated  platelet  counts  in  at  risk  essential 
thrombocythaemia  (ET)  patients  who  are  intolerant  to  their  current  therapy  or  whose  elevated 
platelet counts are not reduced to an acceptable level by their current therapy. 
An at risk patient 
An at risk essential thrombocythaemia patient is defined by one or more of the following features: 
•  60 years of age or 
• 
• 
a platelet count > 1,000 x 109/l or 
a history of thrombo-haemorrhagic events.  
The originator product was authorised under exceptional circumstances, with the specific obligation of 
submitting  annual  literature  reviews.  The  CHMP  agreed  that  this  specific  obligation  should  not  be 
imposed on this application for Anagrelide Mylan but annual PSURs (in which literature review will be 
provided)  should  be  submitted  for  Anagrelide  Mylan,  similarly  to  Xagrid.  This  would  ensure  a 
harmonised assessment across all products. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

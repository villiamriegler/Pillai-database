The clinical phase III  development program for

glycopyrronium bromide included two pivotal studies: a 6-
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC  to accurately 
reflect the percentage of cases of dry mouth and 
month placebo-controlled study (CNVA237A2304) and a 
12-month placebo and active-controlled (open label 
tiotropium 18 micrograms once daily) study 
(CNVA237A2303),  both in patients with clinical diagnosis of 
section 5.1 to revise the p-values of trough FEV1 and 
moderate to severe COPD.  The SmPC  reflects the primary 
the information on the reduction of COPD 
exacerbations in the pivotal studies A2304 and 
A2303. Furthermore, the MAH took this opportunity 
to bring the PI  in line with the latest QRD template, 
to make minor editorial changes and to include the 
black triangle to reflect that the product is under 
additional monitoring.

endpoint trough FEV1 for glycopyrronium bromide 
compared to placebo at the 6-month time-point (108mL) 
for study A2304 and at the 12-month time-point (97mL) for 
study A2303. In order to more precisely reflect the study 
results, the p-values for both studies are being changed 
from p<0.05  to p<0.001 in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
In addition, the information related to the reduction of 
COPD  exacerbations is being revised in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC  to improve clarity and accuracy.

glycopyrronium bromide compared to placebo is 2.4%

This was changed in order to reflect the actual number of 
patients with the MedDRA Preferred Term (PT) “dry mouth” 
in the 6-month database i.e. 2.2% versus 1.1% in 
accordance with the EPAR.

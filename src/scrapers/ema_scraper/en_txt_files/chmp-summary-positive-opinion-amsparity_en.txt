Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Amsparity 
adalimumab 
On 12 December 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Amsparity, 
intended for the treatment of certain inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. The applicant for this 
medicinal product is Pfizer Europe MA EEIG. 
Amsparity will be available as a solution for injection (40 mg in a pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen and, for 
paediatric use only, 20 mg in a pre-filled syringe and 40 mg/0.8 ml in a vial). The active substance of 
Amsparity is adalimumab, a monoclonal antibody and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitor (ATC 
code: L04AB04). Adalimumab binds to TNF and neutralises its biological function by blocking its interaction 
with the p55 and p75 cell-surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are 
induced or regulated by TNFα, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for 
leucocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1). 
Amsparity is a biosimilar medicinal product. It is highly similar to the reference product Humira 
(adalimumab) which was authorised in the EU on 8 September 2003. Data show that Amsparity has 
comparable quality, safety and efficacy to Humira. More information on biosimilar medicines can be found 
here. 
The full indication for the 40 mg solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen is:

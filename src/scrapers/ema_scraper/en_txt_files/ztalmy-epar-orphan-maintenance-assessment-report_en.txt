2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2019 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
“The sponsor Pharma Gateway AB submitted on 26 June 2019 an application for designation as an 
orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing 
ganaxolone for treatment of CDKL5 deficiency disorder (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”. 
The application was submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 
141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing ganaxolone was 
considered justified based on preliminary clinical data suggesting a reduction in seizures upon 
treatment with the proposed product when used in combination with other anti-seizure 
medications; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to early-onset pharmaco-resistant 
seizures, global developmental delay, abnormal muscle tone, hand stereotypies, and 
gastrointestinal and respiratory problems; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately less than 0.5 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, 
the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing ganaxolone will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor has 
provided preliminary clinical data suggesting a reduction in seizures upon treatment with the proposed 
product when used in combination with best standard of care including authorised products. The 
Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing ganaxolone, as an orphan medicinal product for the 
orphan condition: treatment of CDKL5 deficiency disorder”.

3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is caused by mutations in the cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) 
gene. The disorder has also other names in the scientific literature including: CDKL5 deficiency, CDKL5 
disorder, CDKL5 encephalopathy, CDKL5-related epilepsy, CDKL5-related epileptic encephalopathy, 
and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 2.  
Initially, CDD was not classified as a separate entity. Instead, patients with mutations in the CDKL5 
gene were thought to have had an atypical variant of Rett Syndrome. In 2013, CDD was considered a 
separate entity from Rett syndrome (Fehr S. et al., 2013), based on a large international cohort of 
patients with mutations in the CDKL5 gene. The minimum CDD diagnostic criteria to include a 
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in the CDKL5 gene along with motor and cognitive 
developmental delays and epilepsy with onset in the first year of life (Olson, H.E et al., 2019). It is now 
considered a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. 
CDKL5 is expressed widely in most tissues, with highest levels in brain, thymus, and testis. Within 
neurons, it localises in nucleus, neurites, growth cones, dendritic spines, and at the postsynaptic 
density (PSD) of excitatory synapses. Hector et al (2017) identified more than 200 missense variants 
of the CDKL5 gene but concluded that, of these, only 59 variants occurring in the catalytic domain 
were definitely or probably pathogenic. Szafranski et al (2015) have additionally identified a role for 
CDKL5 duplications in a small number of patients.  
The clinical characteristics commonly associated with a CDKL5 mutation include early-onset 
medication-refractory seizures, severe intellectual and gross motor impairment, and sleep and 
behavioural disturbances 
Most individuals with variants in the CDKL5 gene display a phenotype consisting of early-onset and 
refractory epilepsy with severe global developmental delay and markedly impaired gross motor 
function (Fehr 2013). Three stages of seizures in the course of CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) have 
been proposed: Stage I, early onset epilepsy (onset at 1 to 10 weeks of age); Stage II, epileptic 
encephalopathy with IS and hypsarrhythmia; Stage III, tonic seizures with myoclonia and variable 
level of control with anti-seizure medication (ASM) (Bahi-Buisson 2008b). Frequent myoclonic jerks are 
a key component of the epileptic manifestations at this later stage (Demarest 2019; Bahi-Buisson 
2008b). Some patients show an unusual seizure pattern with prolonged generalised tonic-clonic events 
lasting 2 to 4 minutes gradually transitioning to repetitive, distal myoclonic jerks (Bahi-Buisson 
2008b). 
Early drug-resistant epilepsy, usually starting in the first months of life, is characteristic of CDD (Bahi-
Buisson 2008b). Seizures are generally highly polymorphic, and patients can manifest multiple seizure 
types (Bahi-Buisson 2008b; Grosso 2007). Patients can often experience a period of seizure freedom, 
or a “honeymoon period”, after initiation of a new ASM (Fehr 2016b). However, this period of seizure-
control is frequently short-lived and followed by a relapse (Kilstrup-Nielsen 2012).

CDD, being X-chromosome linked, is more common in females. Male patients have a more severe 
phenotype. 
The approved therapeutic indication “ZTALMY is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of epileptic 
seizures associated with cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) in patients 
2 to 17 years of age. ZTALMY may be continued in patients 18 years of age and older’’ falls within the 
scope of the designated orphan condition “treatment of CDKL5 deficiency disorder”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The sponsor discussed the chronically debilitating nature of the condition with most patients failing to 
achieve key developmental milestones (sitting, standing, and/or walking) during their early years and 
in consequence will require round-the-clock support for the rest of their lives (Fehr 2016b). Recently, a 
study exploring the quality of life of patients with CDD has been published (Leonard 2021). Key 
disease aspects negatively affecting quality of life included the lack of ability to sit, use hands, or 
communicate. Less than a quarter of females and fewer males ever achieve the ability to walk (Fehr 
2016a; Fehr 2015). Similarly, only a quarter to a third of females are ever able to use any spoken 
language, signs, and/or abstract symbols (Fehr 2016a; Fehr 2016b). 
The sponsor also discussed the life-threatening nature of the condition. The overall life-expectancy of 
individuals with CDD is likely to be shorter than age matched healthy individuals, although this is not 
clearly established in the literature. Most patients reported to date have been infants, children, or 
adolescents, with very limited numbers of patients reported to have survived into their late 30's 
(Kobayashi 2021; Siri 2021; MacKay 2020; MacKay 2021; Cutri-French 2020; Demarest 2019; Olson 
2019). As with any epileptic encephalopathy that affects multiple body systems in the body, as CDD 
does, there is a higher probability of premature death due to the epilepsy syndrome per se, or other 
contributing factors like respiratory and GI problems/failure. Unexpected death, most likely due to 
sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a risk for patients with CDD (Jakimiec 2020). Genetic 
studies have suggested a potential pathogenic role of CDKL5 variants in the cardio-cerebral 
mechanisms of SUDEP (Coll 2017). 
The COMP considers the condition to be life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to early-onset 
pharmaco-resistant seizures, global developmental delay, abnormal muscle tone, hand stereotypies, 
and gastrointestinal and respiratory problems. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The prevalence has been estimated by using 3 methods presented in Table 1: 
1.  A birth prevalence estimate was reported by Symonds 2019.  This estimate was derived from a 
Scottish prospective, population-based, national cohort study.  Participants were recruited from all 
20 regional paediatric departments and four tertiary children’s hospitals in Scotland, from 8 May 
2014 to 7 May 2017. The mean number of births per year in Scotland for the years 2011 to 2016 
inclusive was 56,490, making the estimated denominator for this population 169,470. Four 
unrelated individuals carrying a CDKL5 mutation were identified, resulting in an estimated birth 
prevalence of 2.36 (95% CI: 0.805-5.59) per 100,000 live births for the years 2011 to 2016. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000071368 
Page 6/12 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  Point prevalence extrapolated from birth-prevalence: Unfortunately, there is very little information 
on life-expectancy of patients carrying a CDKL5 mutation; what little data there are come from 
case reports that suggest affected individuals may, exceptionally, live until approximately 40 years 
of age.  An estimate of point prevalence of CDD in the EEA can be derived from the reported birth 
prevalence estimates, using the conservative assumption that all patients born with a CDKL5 
mutation live to 45 years of age, with a median life expectancy of the European population of 
81.3 years in 2019 (Eurostat 2021).  Conservatively, from the Scottish and expectation score-
derived birth prevalence estimates, the point prevalence estimates for CDD are: 
•  Scotland: 2.36 (95% CI: 0.805-5.59) × 45/81.3 = 1.31 (0.45-3.09) per 100,000. 
•  Expectation score: 1.81-2.49 × 45/81.3 = 1.00-1.38 per 100,000. 
3.  Prevalence estimated by extrapolation from diagnostic yield of CDKL5 mutations in patients 
assumed to have Rett syndrome but no identified MECP2 mutation: The overall weighted-average 
proportion of CDKL5 mutations amongst typical/atypical Rett patients is estimated to be 0.04 (95% 
CI 0.03, 0.06).

In conclusion, there are currently no population based epidemiological data of CDKL-5 deficiency 
disorder, except for the study limited to the region of Scotland. The presented indirect methods, which 
estimated prevalence from population-based sources on Rett syndrome, are considered acceptable. In 
the future, genotyping may become more common in daily practice, and more carriers may be 
diagnosed. In light of the highlighted uncertainty, it seems adequate to consider the most conservative 
estimate and to designate less than 0.6 per 10,000.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor highlighted that there are no ASMs (anti-seizure medications) authorized specifically for 
the treatment of CDD.  Seizures associated with CDD, which are characteristically refractory, are 
managed with a wide range of ASMs of limited effectiveness (Müller 2016), and various non-
pharmaceutical interventions including the ketogenic diet, VNS and, in some cases, neurosurgical 
treatment (Olson 2019; Jakimiec 2020). 
There are not yet international consensus treatment guidelines for CDKL-5 disorder. There is a recent 
treatment guideline from the French Haute Autorité de Santé (2021), which recommends vigabatrin as 
a first-line treatment for infantile spasms associated with CDD and mentions broad-spectrum anti-
epileptic drugs such as felbamate, clobazam, valproate sodium, lamotrigine, and zonisamide for 
generalised seizures. In addition, non-pharmacological options such as a ketogenic diet (limited added 
value) and surgical interventions can also be considered. Seizures may be treated symptomatically 
with anticonvulsants. Use of ketogenic diet is reported to have early efficacy but poor long-term 
efficacy in controlling seizures in CDKL5 deficiency disorder. The use of vagus nerve stimulation for 
seizure control has been reported in 17% of patients. 
Corpus callosotomy, a palliative procedure in which hemispheric connections are severed to limit 
seizure spread, is a treatment of last resort, which can occasionally offer seizure control of secondary 
generalised seizures (Olson 2019). 
There is no standard-of-care for the treatment of the behavioural aberrations associated with the 
encephalopathy. 
The COMP considered that there are no authorized medicinal products available in the EU that are 
specifically indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with CDKL5, however, the anti-seizure 
medications used as standard of care to manage the seizures are considered as satisfactory methods 
to treat seizures in CDD and will be discussed further under significant benefit section below.   
Significant benefit 
The sponsor claimed the significant benefit on the basis that ganaxolone, when added to a background 
regimen of ASMs and/or other non
pharmacological therapies (ketogenic diet or VNS), provides a 
clinically relevant advantage in terms of improved efficacy (with acceptable safety) over those same 
ASMs alone.  
‑
The efficacy to treat seizures associated with CDD in paediatric patients 2 years and older was 
confirmed in a single, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of 17 weeks in patients aged 
2 to 19 years (Study 1042- CDD-3001). The blinded study consisted of a titration phase of 4 weeks, 
followed by a maintenance phase of 13 weeks using a stable dose of the study drug. Subjects were 
required to continue their concomitant background ASM regimen at constant dose for the duration of 
the 17week DB period of the Phase 3 study.  Patients were eligible for Study 1042-CDD-3001, if they 
had a molecular confirmation of pathogenic or likely pathogenic CDKL5 variant, their seizures were 
inadequately controlled by at least 2 previous concomitant ASM medicinal products, and they had a

minimum of 16 seizures of primary seizure type per 28 days in each 1-month period during the 2-
month period prior to screening. 
In total, 101 patients were enrolled into the study (51 placebo and 50 ganaxolone (GNX)). Patients 
were mostly female (79.2%; consistent with the demographics of CDD) and aged between 2 and 19 
years (mean [standard deviation (SD)]: 7.26 [4.55]) with the majority being paediatric (children 2 to 
11 years [82.2%], adolescents [16.8%]). Concomitant ASMs were given to 96% patients. The median 
number of concomitant ASM medicines used by subjects was 2 (range 0-5) in the placebo group and 2 
(range 0-6) in the Ztalmy group. The median number of ASM taken and stopped prior to treatment for 
all subjects was 7 (range: 1 to 16). The most frequent (≥ 10 patients) concomitant ASM medicines 
were valproate, levetiracetam, clobazam and vigabatrin (see Table 3).  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in 28-day frequency of major 
motor seizures (i.e. bilateral tonic (sustained motor activity ≥ 3 seconds), generalized tonic-clonic, 
bilateral clonic, atonic/drop seizures and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures)) during the 17-week 
double blind treatment phase.  At baseline, the mean (SD) number of major motor seizures over 28-
days was 104.8 (173.53) for placebo and 117.2 (138.62) for Ztalmy. The median number of seizures 
were 49.2 (Q1, Q3 18.7, 120.0) in the placebo group and 54.0 (31.3,147.3) at baseline.  
There was a broadly comparable frequency of use of each individual ASM across the two treatment 
arms, and especially so for the four most taken concomitant ASMs (Table 2).

Clinical relevance is supported by responder analyses (>= 50% reduction of MMS frequency from 
baseline at Week 17), which was 24.5% for GNX and 9.8% for placebo (difference 14.7%, 95% CI -
4.7, 33.8, p-value (Fisher exact test) 0.0643).  
Furthermore, in different subgroups of the four most commonly used ASM in the study population, in 
the in general balanced treatment arms, there was a tendency that ganaxolone provided a shift in MMS 
as compared to placebo, supporting the robustness of the treatment effect (see Table 3 above).   Since 
the subgroups based on background ASM were small, statistical significance was not always achieved 
for each subset. However, efficacy can be considered shown for the whole target population,

independent from the background therapy, as the data from the subsets all pointed at the same 
positive direction for GNX.  
According to the sponsor, a reduction in median 28-day seizure frequency for MMS types of -27% and 
reductions relative to 'standard of care' ASM regimens including valproate semisodium, levetiracetam, 
clobazam, and/or vigabatrin of between 16% and 53% represent a clinically relevant advantage over 
existing satisfactory methods. Furthermore, the sponsor claims that data from the on-going open-label 
extension of the Phase 3 study support that ganaxolone at least retains a similar level of efficacy in 
reducing seizure frequency for MMS types over a period of up to 24 months. From the originally 
randomised 101 subjects, 48 (48%) who have already completed month 11-12 visits in the open-label 
extension experienced a median 50% reduction from Baseline in 28-day seizure frequency for MMS 
types. This in contrast to what has been reported previously for other treatments in a study by Müller 
2016, which suggests that no other ASM remains similarly effective over a period of time of more than 
6 months. However, due to the retrospective and non-randomised nature of the study by Müller 
(2016), and the small sample size, the COMP considered that no clear conclusions can be drawn 
regarding the duration of response from this study. Moreover, it is unclear whether the study 
populations were comparable.   
The COMP considered that that the statistically significant reduction in major motor seizures, in favour 
of ganaxolone treatment in patients who had a history of failure to control seizures despite an 
appropriate trial of 2 or more anti-seizure medications at therapeutic doses can justify the significant 
benefit. The claim of a better maintenance of efficacy is not considered acceptable based on the 
ongoing uncontrolled phase of the study. In conclusion, the COMP concluded that the significant benefit 
is justified based on the significant reduction of seizures, as shown in patients who received 
ganaxolone an adjunctive therapy to standard of care.

5.  COMP position adopted on 26 May 2023 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of CDKL5 deficiency disorder (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be less than 0.6 in 10,000 persons in 
the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to early-onset pharmaco-resistant 
seizures, global developmental delay, abnormal muscle tone and hand stereotypies. A reduction of 
life expectancy is mainly due to respiratory complications; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union for all the patients covered by Ztalmy, the assumption that Ztalmy will be of 
significant benefit to those affected by the orphan condition when it is used as an adjunctive 
therapy to standard of care still holds. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Ztalmy, ganaxolone for 
treatment of CDKL5 deficiency disorder (EU/3/19/2224) is not removed from the Community Register 
of Orphan Medicinal Products.

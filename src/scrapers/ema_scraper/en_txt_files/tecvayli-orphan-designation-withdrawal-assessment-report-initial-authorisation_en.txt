Proposed therapeutic indication 
Tecvayli is indicated as monotherapy for the 
treatment of adult patients with relapsed and 
refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at 
least three prior therapies, including an 
immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, 
and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated 
disease progression on the last therapy.

2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2020 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing teclistamab was 
considered justified based on preliminary clinical observations showing responses in heavily 
pretreated relapsed/refractory patients;  
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening in particular due to the development of 
hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anaemia and bone lesions;  
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 4 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made.  
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, the 
sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing teclistamab will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor 
has provided clinical data that support higher response rates in last line multiple myeloma patients 
compared to the expectations with the currently authorised products. The Committee considered 
that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Multiple myeloma (MM; also called plasma cell myeloma) is a malignant neoplasm of plasma cells that 
clonally expand and accumulate in the bone marrow and/or extramedullary sites, leading to bone 
destruction, infections, renal insufficiency, and marrow failure (Dimopoulos et al., 2015). The disease 
is often asymptomatic for a long period of time and therefore often advanced at the time of diagnosis 
(Rajkumar et al., 2014). MM is most frequently diagnosed among people >65 years of age and the 
median age at onset in Europe is 72 years. The incidence rates increase with age, particularly after the 
age of 40 years, and men are more likely to develop the disease than women with a ratio of around 
3:2. The aetiology is unknown with no established lifestyle, occupational or environmental risk factors. 
The clinical course of MM can be highly variable due to the heterogeneity of the disease with some 
patients progressing rapidly despite treatment and others remaining stable without therapy for a 
number of years. Common symptoms of MM include, but are not limited to, fatigue, persistent bone 
pain, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression (from pathologic fracture), weakness, malaise, 
anaemia and/or bleeding, frequent infections (often pneumococcal), hypercalcemia, renal failure, and 
neuropathies (Shah and Besa, 2018). 
The approved therapeutic indication “Teclistamab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least three prior therapies, including 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000083072 
Page 4/14 
 
 
 
 
 
an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody and have 
demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy” falls within the scope of the designated orphan 
condition “Treatment of multiple myeloma”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Multiple myeloma is a largely incurable blood cancer characterized by the clonal proliferation of 
malignant plasma cells both within the bone marrow and at localized extramedullary sites termed 
plasmacytomas (Rajkumar et al., 2016a). The malignant proliferation of the plasma cell clone causes 
increasing levels of monoclonal protein (M-protein) in the serum and urine and may result in bone 
marrow failure, suppression of uninvolved immunoglobulin levels, and skeletal destruction. Clinical 
complications of progressive MM include recurrent infections due to decreased production of antibodies, 
cytopenias (especially anaemia, but also thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia), renal failure due to the 
protein overload, hyperviscosity syndrome, hypercalcemia, bone pain, and pathologic fractures (Munshi 
et al., 2012). 
Substantial progress has been made during the last decade in improving the overall survival (OS) of 
patients with MM through the development and availability of new approved treatment options. Still, 
even with optimal upfront therapy and advances in treatment, most MM patients progress or relapse, 
and further treatment is needed. 
The sponsor has not identified any changes in the seriousness of MM since the orphan designation was 
granted in 2020. The COMP has previously acknowledged that MM is chronically debilitating due to the 
development of hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anaemia and/or bleeding, frequent infections, and 
bone lesions, and life-threatening due to the poor survival of patients with r/r disease. The seriousness 
of MM earlier accepted by the COMP remains acceptable for this procedure. 
Number of people affected or at risk  
At time of initial orphan designation in 2020, the COMP concluded that the condition was estimated to 
be affecting approximately 4 in 10,000 persons in the European Union. 
The sponsor performed an updated comprehensive search to determine the prevalence of MM in the 
EU, including publications from population-based cancer registry databases. Prevalence estimates 
(both limited-duration prevalence and complete prevalence) reported by population-based registries 
(i.e., direct method) were found in published reports by the International Agency for Research on 
Cancer (IARC)’s GLOBOCAN surveillance project (2020 data) and the Association of the Nordic Cancer 
Registries (NORDCAN; 2020 data). Furthermore, the sponsor reported relevant MM prevalence data 
from the CancerMPact® project, comprising data from the 4 most populous EU countries, specifically 
Germany, France, Italy, and Spain (including the Robert Koch Institute, ITACAN, InVS in France, and 
IARC), which represent 58% of the EU population (2020 data). Additionally, the sponsor considered 
the latest available MM incidence figure according to the European Cancer Information System (ECIS; 
2020 data). 
According to NORDCAN (2020), the complete prevalence can be calculated for these countries because 
the full history of MM can be determined from population-based registries. The complete prevalence of 
MM ranged from 3.21 per 10,000 persons in Finland to 4.19 per 10,000 in Denmark, with an average 
of 3.68 per 10,000 across the 3 countries. GLOBOCAN provides a 5-year prevalence of 3.08 per 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000083072 
Page 5/14 
 
 
 
 
 
10,000. EU country registries provide slightly higher 10-year and total prevalence estimates, with an 
average 10-year prevalence in 4 of the most populous EU countries of 3.52 per 10,000 and an average 
total prevalence in the 3 Nordic EU countries of 3.68 per 10,000. However, when estimating prevalence 
using the most contemporary and conservative European incidence and survival data, the prevalence 
of multiple myeloma is 4.34 per 10,000 persons. Prevalence estimates will vary from this value 
according to age group and treatment line. The sponsor considered that 4.34 per 10,000 persons is the 
most contemporary, conservative estimate of the prevalence of MM in the EU. This estimate was 
derived from the following source data: 
The estimated crude incidence for the 27 EU member states (EU27) was reported to be 0.80 per 
10,000 persons in 2020 (ECIS 2020). The sponsor noted that males have a higher estimated crude 
incidence of MM than females in the EU27 with 0.92 versus 0.69 per 10,000 persons, respectively. 
The reported survival differed by both age at MM diagnosis and the line of treatment received. A recent 
global review reported that the median survival among patients diagnosed at less than 65 years varied 
from <2.75 to 5.42 years and the median survival among patients diagnosed at 65 years and older 
ranged from 2.17 to 2.67 years (Turesson et al., 2018). The sponsor then chose the highest median 
survival duration of 5.42 years reported in this review for their final prevalence calculation. However, 
this estimate was based on the survival duration reported among MM patients aged 65 years or 
younger who were diagnosed between 2001-2006 at the Mayo Clinic in the US (Kumar et. al., 2008), 
and is therefore considered to be outdated. 
According to the sponsor, a conservative prevalence estimate for MM is proposed which considered the 
highest median survival duration of 5.42 years among patients aged less than 65 years together with 
the most recent ECIS crude incidence data for MM from 2020 of 0.8. This resulted in an estimated 
prevalence of 4.34 per 10,000 persons in the EU (0.80 per 10,000 * 5.42 years = 4.34 per 10,000). 
Previously COMP accepted higher disease duration of 5.8 years which is derived from the following 
publications (Greipp 2005; Cho 2017; Kastritis 2017; Usmani 2018). Based on these data, the median 
OS for International Staging System (ISS) stage I/II patients, who represent 60-70% of all MM 
patients, is approximately 7 years. For ISS stage III patients, who represent 30-40% of all MM 
patients, the median OS is approximately 1-4 years, i.e. using a 7-year mOS for ISS stage I/II, 
representing 60% of the population and 4-year mOS for ISS stage III, representing 40%. 
Combining this updated and slightly higher OS estimate in MM together with the ECIS 2020 incidence 
data of MM of 0.8, the estimated prevalence results in 4.6 per 10,000 persons, i.e. (0.8*5.8) = 4.64 
per 10,000 persons. This estimate was accepted by the COMP for the recent orphan maintenance 
designations of Abecma and Carvykti and is also relevant and preferable for this procedure, based on 
the above outlined recent data.  
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
There are several medicinal products authorised in the European Community for treatment of MM. 
Central marketing authorisations (MAs) include daratumumab (Darzalex), carfilzomib (Kyprolis), 
bortezomib (Velcade and generics), doxorubicin (Caelyx), interferon-α-2b (IntronA/ Alfatronol), 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000083072 
Page 6/14 
 
 
 
 
 
lenalidomide (Revlimid and generics), thalidomide (generics), panobinostat (Farydak), elotuzumab 
(Empliciti), ixazomib (Ninlaro), pomalidomide (Imnovid), dexamethasone (generics), isatuximab 
(Sarclisa), belantamab mafodotin (Blenrep), selinexor (Nexpovio) and the two recently approved CAR-
T cell products idecabtagene vicleucel (hereinafter referred to as ide-cel, Abecma; CMA in August 
2021) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (hereinafter referred to as cilta-cel, Carvykti; CMA May 2022). In 
addition, several products are authorised at the national level for the treatment of MM, including 
carmustine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, bendamustine, epirubicin, melphalan and vincristine. As 
defined by their approved therapeutic indications, these medicines are approved for use across the MM 
continuum (i.e., from newly diagnosed to heavily r/r disease) and are often used in combination. 
The recently updated European Hematology Association (EHA) and European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO) clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of MM describe 
recommended treatment options available for r/r MM patients in the third- and later lines setting 
(Dimopoulos, Ann Oncol. 2021; 32(3): 309-322). The EHA-ESMO guidelines distinguishes between 
treatment of elderly patients in the non-transplant setting, and younger or more fit patients in good 
clinical condition who are eligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) in the transplant 
setting. Treatments are discussed as regards to front-line treatment, consolidation, maintenance, and 
r/r disease. According to the guidelines, the selection of a suitable regimen in third- or subsequent 
lines of therapy for any given patient depends on several parameters such as prior exposure, 
refractoriness, and sensitivity to specific agents or classes of agents in prior lines of therapy. 
The treatment algorithm for MM is evolving rapidly and the therapeutic field for the management of the 
condition is continuously changing. Currently, the following agents are specifically authorised in the r/r 
MM setting in the EU: 
•  Second- and later lines: bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, 
daratumumab, isatuximab, and elotuzumab. 
• 
• 
• 
Third- and later lines: pomalidomide, daratumumab, isatuximab, elotuzumab, and panobinostat. 
Fourth- and later lines: ide-cel and cilta-cel. 
Fifth- and later lines: belantamab and selinexor. 
Satisfactory methods for the target patient population 
Teclistamab is indicated for triple-class exposed (to a proteasome inhibitor [PI], an immunomodulatory 
drug [IMiD], and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody [mAb]) patients with r/r MM who have received at 
least 3 prior lines of therapy and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. In this 
specific therapeutic area, ide-cel and cilta-cel are considered satisfactory methods as these medicines 
are approved for triple-class exposed r/r MM patients in fourth- or later lines. 
The medicinal products belantamab and selinexor have more restricted therapeutic indications as 
compared to that for teclistamab. These agents are approved as fifth- and later lines of therapy in 
more refractory MM patients being either triple-class refractory (to a PI, an IMiD, and an anti-CD38 
mAb) for belantamab or penta-class refractory (to 2 PIs, 2 IMiDs, and 1 anti-CD38 mAb) for selinexor, 
while teclistamab is approved for use in a less refractory patient population and already from fourth 
line of therapy. It is therefore considered that teclistamab does in principle include a broader patient 
population, which is not covered by belantamab and selinexor. 
With regards to elotuzumab, which is an anti-SLAM7 mAb, it is pointed out that its use is authorized in 
combination with a class of products to which a significant part of the target patient population for 
teclistamab was largely refractory to, i.e. IMiDs (lenalidomide, pomalidomide), (Empliciti EPAR 2021). 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000083072 
Page 7/14 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, elotuzumab is not recommended for triple-class refractory patients with r/r MM according 
to the EHA-ESMO guideline (Dimopoulos et al., 2021). 
Foresighted the sponsor also considered the product melphalan flufenamide (Pepaxti) with an expected 
indication in r/r MM as satisfactory method. However, the notification of MA for melphalan flufenamide 
has not been published in the Official Journal of the European Union at the time of the re-evaluation of 
the designation criteria of teclistamab for the treatment of MM. Melphalan flufenamide is therefore not 
considered a satisfactory method. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor argued that teclistamab will be of significant benefit based on a clinically relevant 
advantage in terms of the clinical efficacy observed in the pivotal study MajesTEC-1 and provide a 
major contribution to patient care compared to existing methods of treatment for the target patient 
population. As explained in the previous section, significant benefit of teclistamab has to be evaluated 
over the two satisfactory methods ide-cel and cilta-cel for the target patient population. The sponsor 
also proposed belantamab, selinexor, elotuzumab, and melphalan flufenamide as satisfactory methods, 
however this view is not supported (please see the section on Existing methods above). 
The sponsor received EMA protocol assistance dated 11-Nov-2021 with regards to the evidence needed 
to justify significant benefit of teclistamab over existing treatments used for the treatment of patients 
with r/r MM. Since the treatment landscape in MM are changing rapidly, the sponsor was reminded by 
the EMA that that the most recent therapeutic options for the intended patient population will need to 
be evaluated for demonstrating significant benefit at the time of MA to maintain the orphan medicinal 
product status. The sponsor confirmed that they have used the same approach as described during the 
protocol assistance and, where applicable, complied with the EMA recommendations (Case No. 
EMA/SA/0000069104). 
The sponsor has conducted 2 types of efficacy analyses to establish significant benefit of teclistamab 
compared with their proposed selection of satisfactory methods for patients with relapsed and 
refractory MM (Analysis 1 and Analysis 2). Additionally, the sponsor has more broadly compared 
teclistamab with available CAR-T cell therapies to demonstrate that teclistamab provides a significant 
benefit versus this class of products. In line with the above discussion on satisfactory methods for the 
purpose of this procedure, only parts of the provided analyses are of relevance and will be reflected 
below accordingly. 
The primary data supporting the efficacy and safety of teclistamab in MM in the CMA application were 
obtained from the ongoing, open-label, multicentre, single-arm phase 1/2 study 64007957MMY1001 
(also called MajesTEC-1). The study was designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy of 
teclistamab monotherapy (1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous [SC] administered weekly with the first treatment 
dose preceded by step-up doses of 0.06 and 0.3 mg/kg) in adult patients with r/r MM. The study was 
conducted in 3 parts, which constituted the dose escalation (Part 1) to identify the recommended 
phase 2 dose(s) [RP2D(s)], dose expansion to evaluate the tolerability of the proposed RP2Ds (Part 2), 
and phase 2 dose expansion to further study teclistamab SC at the RP2D in cohorts of patients with r/r 
MM who had previously received at least 3 prior lines of therapy and were triple class exposed (Part 3). 
The pivotal population with regards to efficacy were patients treated at the RP2D in the phase 1 part 
and patients treated in Cohort A in the phase 2 (n=165), part 3 of the study, with previous exposure 
to at least one PI, one IMiD, and one anti-CD38 mAb. Efficacy data especially supporting the efficacy in 
patients who had received previous BCMA-targeting treatment was provided from Cohort C. 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000083072 
Page 8/14 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the phase 2 part 3 of the study was overall response rate (ORR), 
defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a partial response (PR) or better (i.e., stringent 
complete response [sCR] + complete response [CR] + very good PR [VGPR] + PR) according to the 
International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria (Kumar et al., 2016) as assessed by 
an independent review committee (IRC). Secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of response 
(DOR), rates of VGPR or better/CR or better/sCR, minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate (as 
defined by the IMWG criteria), time to response (TTR), progression-free survival (PFS), and OS. 
Analysis 1: Efficacy of teclistamab from MajesTEC-1 based on prior therapies 
The aim of the first analysis was to demonstrate that teclistamab provided efficacy for patients who are 
refractory to previous treatments. 
The data that were presented represented the respective efficacy analysis sets for the 2 populations 
from the pivotal study MajesTEC-1 that received the RP2D, i.e. including Phase 1 subjects treated at 
the RP2D (n= 40) and Phase 2 subjects treated in Cohort A (n= 110), as well as subjects from an 
additional Cohort C (n = 25). The pivotal RP2D cohorts (n =150) included subjects who had previously 
received pomalidomide, lenalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib, daratumumab, isatuximab, 
elotuzumab, panobinostat, selinexor, and melphalan flufenamide. Importantly, in the exploratory 
Cohort C of the MajesTEC-1 study, patients were enrolled with prior BCMA-targeted therapies, 
including those who had previously received the CAR-T cell therapies ide-cel and cilta-cel. 
The median age of the patients who received the RP2D of teclistamab in the MajesTEC-1 study was 
64.5 years (range: 33 to 84) and 15.3% (23/150) of subjects were ≥75 years of age. Most subjects 
were males (58.7%; 88/150) and White (89.3%; 134/150). All subjects had an ECOG performance 
score of 0 (35.3%; 53/150) and 1 (64.7%; 97/150). The study population was both heavily pretreated 
with a median of 5 prior lines of therapy (range: 2 to 14) for the pivotal RP2D cohorts, and a median 
of 6 prior lines (range: 3 to 13) for Cohort C, and highly refractory. Of the patients in the pivotal RP2D 
cohorts, 89.3% (134/150) were refractory to their last line of prior therapy, 77.3% (116/150) were 
triple-class refractory and 29.3% (44/150) were penta-class refractory. Of the patients in Cohort C, 
80.0% (20/25) were refractory to their last line of prior therapy, 84.0% (21/25) were triple-class 
refractory, and 32.0% (8/25) were penta-class refractory. 
Table 2 provides a summary of exposure and refractoriness to the prior therapies received by subjects 
included in the pivotal RP2D Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS) and the EAS of the exploratory Cohort C for 
the MajesTEC-1 study. Within this table, the sponsor has also reported the ORRs from the MajesTEC-1 
study for those subjects who were exposed to and whose disease was refractory to the prior therapies 
listed.

Cohort C efficacy analysis set, n=25. 
* All subjects who received CAR-T therapy had disease progression prior to next line of therapy. 
The sponsor has prepared a separate subset analysis for the entire exploratory Cohort C, including not 
only the CAR-T cell therapies ide-cel and cilta-cel but also the BCMA-targeting antibody drug conjugate 
belantamab. The sponsor pooled the data from Cohort C to support their claim of teclistamab providing 
a benefit for patients with prior therapy targeting BCMA, including ADC and CAR-T cell products. 
However, for the purpose of evaluating significant benefit within this procedure, only data from a 
subset of this exploratory Cohort C is of relevance, i.e., patients previously treated with the two 
approved CAR-T cell products for MM (ide-cel and cilta-cel). Nevertheless, for sake of completeness 
and for providing a comprehensive overview of the pivotal licensing study (MajesTEC-1), the whole 
Table 1 is included in this report. 
The sponsor concluded that preliminary response data from Cohort C suggested that teclistamab may 
provide benefit for patients with prior CAR-T cell therapy. The ORR in patients previously treated with 
CAR-T cell therapy was reported to be 45.5% (5/11; including 8 patients who had received prior 
treatment with ide-cel, 2 patients who had received cilta-cel, and 1 patient for whom the exact CAR-T 
cell therapy was not specified and whose response data is therefore not reflected in Table 1). The DOR

in patient who had received CAR-T cell therapies was not separately reported. Of note, the two 
patients who had previously received cilta-cel did not obtain an ORR in response to teclistamab. 
The COMP considered the teclistamab efficacy data from the subset of patients in Cohort C who 
received prior CAR-T cell therapy with ide-cel and cilta-cel of great relevance for the discussion of 
significant benefit. The sponsor should therefore provide an updated sub-analysis of all efficacy 
parameters measured and available to date for patients previously receiving ide-cel and cilta-cel. 
Analysis 2: Comparative analysis of efficacy for teclistamab versus other novel therapies based on 
matching-adjusted indirect comparisons 
The sponsor acknowledged that interpretation of the results for Analysis 1 for ide-cel and cilta-cel is 
limited by the small numbers of subjects exposed and whose disease was refractory to these agents 
prior to enrollment in MajesTEC-1. Hence, the sponsor has undertaken further analyses of the efficacy 
of these newer agents relative to teclistamab using a matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAIC) 
approach (Analysis 2). The sponsor has conducted MAICs of the outcomes between subjects treated 
with ide-cel (Abecma) in KarMMa and cilta-cel (Carvykti) in CARTITUDE-1 versus subjects treated with 
teclistamab in the pivotal RP2D EAS for MajesTEC-1 (n=150). The MAIC analyses of teclistamab versus 
ide-cel, as described in the sponsor’s initial maintenance report based on an earlier data-cut 
(November 2021) from the MajesTEC-1 study, favored ide-cel with statistical significance on ORR and 
OS, and were numerically in favor of ide-cel for CR or better rate and PFS. However, DOR was 
significantly longer with teclistamab compared to ide-cel. Comparisons of teclistamab versus cilta-cel, 
based on the November 2021 data cut-off, generally favored cilta-cel, with statistical significance for 
ORR, CR or better rate, PFS and OS. For DOR, results were numerically in favor of teclistamab. The 
sponsor concluded that the reported results suggested that the efficacy of teclistamab is not 
significantly better as compared to ide-cel and cilta-cel and hence cannot be used in support of 
establishing significant benefit of teclistamab over these two therapies.

The interpretation of the results needs to take into account that the matching of the MajesTEC-1 
population versus the populations of the comparator studies reduced the effective sample size of the 
study, which may have limited the power for observed differences in outcomes between studies to 
reach statistically significant differences between studies. 
The sponsor therefore proposed to base significant benefit for teclistamab versus the two approved 
CAR-T cell comparators on major contribution to patient care. This is discussed in the following section. 
Differentiation from CAR-T cell therapies 
The sponsor pointed out that teclistamab will provide a major contribution to patient care as compared 
to the authorized CAR-T cell therapies ide-cel and cilta-cel, as these have limitations with regards to 
patient eligibility, safety, logistical, and accessibility considerations that may prevent them from being 
practical and clinically appropriate for all patients with heavily pretreated MM. According to the 
sponsor, teclistamab confers a clinically relevant advantage in this respect and will provide a major 
contribution to patient care as the most efficacious, off-the-shelf treatment option without 
compromising on efficacy for all triple-class exposed patients with r/r MM, including those who are 
unable to receive CAR-T cell therapy. 
The sponsor’s arguments are acknowledged and supported from a clinical perspective. However, from 
a regulatory perspective within the remits of this procedure it is reminded that a (minimal) prerequisite 
for the claim of major contribution to patient care is the demonstration of the product’s equivalence in 
terms of efficacy, safety and benefit/risk balance as compared with relevant authorized medicinal 
products for the target patient population, i.e., in this case ide-cel and cilta-cel. Reference is made to 
the “Commission notice on the application of Articles 3, 5 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on 
orphan medicinal products”:  
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:JOC_2016_424_R_0003&from=EN

Page 13/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the data provided by the sponsor, a positive conclusion on the product’s (teclistamab) 
equivalence in terms of efficacy, safety and benefit/risk balance vis a vis the satisfactory methods ide-
cel and cilta-cel cannot be drawn. 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, significant benefit of teclistamab over the authorized CAR-T cell therapies ide-cel and 
cilta-cel is not considered to be established based on the data presented. The COMP therefore adopted 
a question on significant benefit. 
4.  COMP list of issues 
•  Significant benefit  
Significant benefit of teclistamab over the authorised medicinal products Abecma (ide-cel) and Carvykti 
(cilta-cel) is not considered established, based on the data presented. The sponsor should therefore 
further justify the claim of significant benefit of teclistamab over these two medicinal products in the 
fourth- and later lines setting for the target patient population.

Change or addition of a new strength/potency. 
22/10/2009

SmPC, Annex 
The MAH applied for a new strength (Lumigan 0.1 mg/ml 
Annex I_2.(c) Change or addition of a new 
and PL 
the other approved formulation (0.3 mg/ml). The product 
II, Labelling 
eye drops, solution) to provide a therapeutic alternative to 
strength/potency 
line will now have two options, one with a reduced 
concentration of bimatoprost or one with a low 
benzalkonium chloride concentration. Choice between two 
formulations will depend on the patient's ocular status and 
ability to tolerate the product.   
The new presentation is aimed at improving the ocular 
surface tolerability, mainly conjunctival hyperaemia 
(redness of the eye), by reducing to one third the content 
of bimatoprost (i.e. from 0.03% to 0.01%). This leads to a 
4-fold increase of the preservative BAK in order to achieve 
a greater absorption of the active substance. 
The CHMP considered the benefits of Lumigan 0.01 % 
formulation outweigh the potential risks. 
II/0028 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
23/07/2009

The rationale in support of the changes was based on a

cumulative safety analysis of adverse events (collected up 
to 31 August 2008) as part of a revision of the Company

Data Sheet. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
Core Data Sheet for Lumigan. The review provided by the 
MAH was considered to be adequate and the MAH proposals 
were endorsed. The following two adverse events have 
been included: 'Nausea' and 'enophthalmos'. The following 
three adverse events have been deleted: 'Peripheral 
oedema', 'infection' (primarily colds and upper respiratory 
infections), and 'cataract'.  
In addition, aspects of section 4.4 concerning iris and 
periorbital tissue pigmentation have been updated. 
The recommendations on lactation in section 4.6 were also 
updated in line with the recommendations of the Guideline 
on risk assessment of medicinal products on human 
reproduction and lactation.

SmPC, 
Based on their review of the available information and on 
Labelling and 
the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, the 
PL 
CHMP was of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy continue to be adequately and sufficiently 
demonstrated. Therefore, the benefit/risk profile of 
Lumigan continues to be favourable. The CHMP 
recommended the renewal of the Marketing Authorisation 
for Lumigan with unlimited validity.

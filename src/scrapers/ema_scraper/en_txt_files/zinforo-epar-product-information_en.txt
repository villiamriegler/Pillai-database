Hepatic impairment
No dosage adjustment is considered necessary in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Method of administration
Intravenous use. Zinforo is administered by intravenous infusion over 5 to 60 minutes for standard 
dose or 120 minutes for high dose (for cSSTI caused by S. aureus with MIC of 2 or 4 mg/L to 
ceftaroline) in infusion volumes of 50 mL, 100 mL or 250 mL (see section 6.6). Infusion related 
reactions (such as phlebitis) can be managed by prolonging the infusion duration.
Infusion volumes for paediatric patients will vary according to the weight of the child. The infusion 
solution concentration during preparation and administration should not exceed 12 mg/mL ceftaroline 
fosamil.
For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Hypersensitivity to the cephalosporin class of antibacterials.
Immediate and severe hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylactic reaction) to any other type of beta-lactam 
antibacterial agent (e.g. penicillins or carbapenems).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Hypersensitivity reactions
Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions are possible (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and 
acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with
beta-lactam antibiotics (including cephalosporins) treatment.
Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to cephalosporins, penicillins or other beta-lactam 
antibacterials may also be hypersensitive to ceftaroline fosamil. Ceftaroline should be used with 
caution in patients with a history of non-severe hypersensitivity reactions to any other beta-lactam 
5
antibiotics (e.g. penicillins or carbapenems). If a severe allergic reaction or SCAR occurs during 
treatment with Zinforo, the medicinal product should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken.
With other beta-lactam antibiotics there have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions which 
progressed to Kounis syndrome (acute allergic coronary arteriospasm that can result in myocardial 
infarction, see section 4.8).
Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea 
Antibacterial-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported with ceftaroline 
fosamil and may range in severity from mild to life threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider 
this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of 
ceftaroline fosamil (see section 4.8). In such circumstance, the discontinuation of therapy with 
ceftaroline fosamil and the use of supportive measures together with the administration of specific 
treatment for Clostridium difficile should be considered.
Non-susceptible organisms
Superinfections may occur during or following treatment with Zinforo.
Patients with pre-existing seizure disorder 
Seizures have occurred in toxicology studies at 7-25 times human ceftaroline Cmax levels (see 
section 5.3). Clinical study experience with ceftaroline fosamil in patients with pre-existing seizure 
disorders is very limited. Therefore, Zinforo should be used with caution in this patient population. 
Direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) seroconversion and potential risk of haemolytic anaemia
The development of a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAGT) may occur during treatment with 
cephalosporins. The incidence of DAGT seroconversion in patients receiving ceftaroline fosamil was 
11.2% in the five pooled pivotal studies with administration every 12 hours (600 mg administered over 
60 minutes every 12 hours) and 32.3% in a study in patients receiving ceftaroline fosamil every 
8 hours (600 mg administered over 120 minutes every 8 hours), (see section 4.8). In clinical studies 
there was no evidence of haemolysis in patients who developed a positive DAGT on treatment. 
However, the possibility that haemolytic anaemia may occur in association with cephalosporins 
including Zinforo treatment cannot be ruled out. Patients experiencing anaemia during or after 
treatment with Zinforo should be investigated for this possibility.
Limitations of the clinical data
There is no experience with ceftaroline in the treatment of CAP in the following patient groups: the 
immunocompromised, patients with severe sepsis/septic shock, severe underlying lung disease (e.g. 
cystic fibrosis, see section 5.2), those with PORT Risk Class V, and/or CAP requiring ventilation at 
presentation, CAP due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus or patients requiring intensive care. Caution is 
advised when treating such patients. 
There is no experience with ceftaroline in the treatment of cSSTI in the following patient groups: the 
immunocompromised, patients with severe sepsis/septic shock, necrotizing fasciitis, perirectal abscess 
and patients with third degree and extensive burns. There is limited experience in treating patients with 
diabetic foot infections. Caution is advised when treating such patients.
There are limited clinical trial data on the use of ceftaroline to treat cSSTI caused by S. aureus with an 
MIC of > 1 mg/L. The recommended dosages of Zinforo shown in Tables 1 to 4 for the treatment of 
cSSTI caused by S. aureus with ceftaroline MIC of 2 or 4 mg/L are based on pharmacokinetic-
pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). Zinforo should not be used to 
treat cSSTI due to S. aureus for which the ceftaroline MIC is > 4 mg/L.
The recommended dosage of Zinforo shown in Table 2 for paediatric patients < 2 months of age are 
based on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation.
6
Infusion times of less than 60 minutes are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses 
only.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with ceftaroline fosamil.
The interaction potential of ceftaroline or ceftaroline fosamil on medicinal products metabolised by 
CYP450 enzymes is expected to be low since they are not inhibitors nor inducers of CYP450 enzymes 
in vitro. Ceftaroline or ceftaroline fosamil are not metabolised by CYP450 enzymes in vitro, therefore 
co-administered CYP450 inducers or inhibitors are unlikely to influence the pharmacokinetics of 
ceftaroline.
Ceftaroline is neither a substrate, nor an inhibitor of renal uptake transporters (OCT2, OAT1, and 
OAT3) in vitro. Therefore, interactions of ceftaroline with medicinal products that are substrates or 
inhibitors (e.g. probenecid) of these transporters would not be expected.
Paediatric population
As with adults, the interaction potential is expected to be low in paediatrics.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of ceftaroline fosamil in pregnant women. Animal 
studies conducted in rat and rabbit do not indicate harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
at exposures similar to therapeutic concentrations. Following administration throughout pregnancy and 
lactation in the rat, there was no effect on pup birth weight or growth, although minor changes in 
foetal weight and delayed ossification of the interparietal bone were observed when ceftaroline 
fosamil was administered during organogenesis (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Zinforo during pregnancy unless the 
clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with an antibiotic with Zinforo’s antibacterial 
profile.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether ceftaroline fosamil or ceftaroline is excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
or to discontinue/abstain from Zinforo therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the 
child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
Fertility
The effects of ceftaroline fosamil on fertility on humans have not been studied. Animal studies with 
ceftaroline fosamil do not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Undesirable effects e.g. dizziness may occur and this may have an effect on the ability to drive and use 
of machines (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 3% of approximately 3242 patients treated with 
Zinforo in clinical studies were diarrhoea, headache, nausea, and pruritus, and were generally mild or 
7
moderate in severity. Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) and severe hypersensitivity
reactions may also occur.
A greater incidence of rash in Asian patients (see below) and a greater incidence of DAGT 
seroconversion (see section 4.4) were observed in a study of adult patients with cSSTI conducted with 
Zinforo 600 mg administered over 120 minutes every 8 hours.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions have been identified during clinical trials and post-marketing 
experience with Zinforo. Adverse reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and 
frequency. Frequency categories are derived according to the following conventions: very common 
(≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to 
< 1/1,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions
SCARs (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and 
systemic symptoms, acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis) have been reported with beta-lactam 
antibiotics, including cephalosporins (see section 4.4).
Kounis Syndrome
Acute coronary syndrome associated with an allergic reaction (Kounis syndrome) has been reported 
with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
Rash
Rash was observed at a common frequency in both the pooled Phase III studies in cSSTI with 
administration of Zinforo every 12 hours (600 mg administered over 60 minutes every 12 hours) and 
the study in cSSTI with administration every 8 hours (600 mg administered over 120 minutes every 
8 hours). However, the frequency of rash in the subgroup of Asian patients receiving Zinforo every 
8 hours was very common (18.5%).
Paediatric population
The safety assessment in paediatric patients is based on the safety data from 2 trials in which 
227 patients aged from 2 months to 17 years with cSSTI or CAP received Zinforo. Overall, the safety 
profile in these 227 patients was similar to that observed in the adult population.
In addition, the safety assessment in neonates is based on the safety data from 2 trials in which 
34 patients (age range from birth to less than 60 days) received Zinforo; 23 of these patients received 
only a single dose of Zinforo. Overall, the adverse events reported in these studies were consistent 
with the known safety profile for Zinforo.
9
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Limited data in patients receiving higher than recommended Zinforo dosages show similar adverse 
reactions as observed in the patients receiving recommended dosages. Treatment of overdose should 
follow standard medical practice.
Patients with renal impairment
Relative overdosing could occur in patients with moderate renal impairment. Neurological sequelae, 
including encephalopathy, have been noted in cases where beta-lactam antibiotics (including 
cephalosporins) have been given to patients with impaired renal function without reducing the dose 
(see section 4.2).
Ceftaroline can be removed by haemodialysis; over a 4 hour dialysis period, approximately 74% of a 
given dose was recovered in the dialysate.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, other cephalosporins and penems, 
ATC code: J01DI02
The active moiety after Zinforo administration is ceftaroline.
Mechanism of action
Ceftaroline is a cephalosporin antibacterial with in vitro activity against Gram-positive and -negative 
bacteria. The bactericidal action of ceftaroline is mediated through binding to essential penicillin-
binding proteins (PBPs). Biochemical studies have shown that ceftaroline has high affinity for PBP2a 
of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and PBP2x of penicillin non-susceptible 
Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNSP). As a result, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 
ceftaroline against a proportion of these organisms tested fall into the susceptible range (see 
Resistance section below).
Resistance
Ceftaroline is not active against strains of Enterobacterales producing extended-spectrum beta-
lactamases (ESBLs) from the TEM, SHV or CTX-M families, serine carbapenemases (such as KPC), 
class B metallo-beta-lactamases or class C (AmpC) cephalosporinases. Organisms that express these 
enzymes and which are therefore resistant to ceftaroline occur at very variable rates between countries 
and between healthcare facilities within countries. If ceftaroline is commenced before susceptibility 
test results are available then local information on the risk of encountering organisms that express 
these enzymes should be taken into consideration. Resistance may also be mediated by bacterial 
impermeability or drug efflux pump mechanisms. One or more of these mechanisms may co-exist in a 
single bacterial isolate.
Interaction with other antibacterial agents
In vitro studies have not demonstrated any antagonism between ceftaroline in combination with other 
commonly used antibacterial agents (e.g. amikacin, azithromycin, aztreonam, daptomycin, 
levofloxacin, linezolid, meropenem, tigecycline, and vancomycin).
10
Susceptibility testing breakpoints
MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) interpretive criteria for susceptibility testing have been 
established by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for 
ceftaroline fosamil and are listed here: https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/other/minimum-
inhibitory-concentration-mic-breakpoints_en.xlsx
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship
As with other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the percent time above the minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) of the infecting organism over the dosing interval (%T > MIC) has been shown to 
be the parameter that best correlates with the efficacy of ceftaroline.

5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The Cmax and AUC of ceftaroline increase approximately in proportion to dose within the single dose 
range of 50 to 1000 mg. No appreciable accumulation of ceftaroline is observed following multiple 
intravenous infusions of 600 mg every 8 or 12 hours in healthy adults with CrCL > 50 mL/min.
Distribution
The plasma protein binding of ceftaroline is low (approximately 20%) and ceftaroline is not 
distributed into erythrocytes. The median steady-state volume of distribution of ceftaroline in healthy 
adult males following a single 600 mg intravenous dose of radiolabelled ceftaroline fosamil was 
20.3 l, similar to the volume of extracellular fluid.
Biotransformation
Ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug) is converted into the active ceftaroline in plasma by phosphatase 
enzymes and concentrations of the prodrug are measurable in plasma primarily during intravenous 
infusion. Hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring of ceftaroline occurs to form the microbiologically 
inactive, open-ring metabolite, ceftaroline M-1. The mean plasma ceftaroline M-1 to ceftaroline AUC 
ratio following a single 600 mg intravenous infusion of ceftaroline fosamil in healthy subjects is 
approximately 20-30%.
In pooled human liver microsomes, metabolic turnover was low for ceftaroline, indicating that 
ceftaroline is not metabolised by hepatic CYP450 enzymes.
Elimination
Ceftaroline is primarily eliminated by the kidneys. Renal clearance of ceftaroline is approximately 
equal, or slightly lower than the glomerular filtration rate in the kidney, and in vitro transporter studies 
indicate that active secretion does not contribute to the renal elimination of ceftaroline.
The mean terminal elimination half-life of ceftaroline in healthy adults is approximately 2.5 hours.
Following the administration of a single 600 mg intravenous dose of radiolabelled ceftaroline fosamil 
to healthy male adults, approximately 88% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 6% in faeces.
Special populations
Renal impairment
Dosage adjustments are required in adults, adolescents and children with CrCL ≤ 50 mL/min (see 
section 4.2).
There is insufficient information to recommend dosage adjustments in adolescents with ESRD aged 
from 12 to < 18 years and with bodyweight < 33 kg and in children with ESRD aged from 2 to 
< 12 years. There is insufficient information to recommend dosage adjustments in paediatric patients
aged < 2 years with moderate or severe renal impairment or ESRD.
Hepatic impairment
The pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline in patients with hepatic impairment has not been established. As 
ceftaroline does not appear to undergo significant hepatic metabolism, the systemic clearance of 
ceftaroline is not expected to be significantly affected by hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dosage 
adjustment is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment.
12
Elderly
Following administration of a single 600 mg intravenous dose of ceftaroline fosamil, the 
pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline were similar between healthy elderly subjects (≥ 65 years of age), and 
healthy young adult subjects (18-45 years of age). There was a 33% increase in AUC0-∞ in the elderly 
that was mainly attributable to age-related changes in renal function. Zinforo dose adjustment is not 
required in elderly patients with creatinine clearance above 50 mL/min.
Paediatric population
Dose adjustments are required for neonates, infants, children and adolescents with bodyweight < 33 kg 
(see section 4.2). 
Patients with cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis patients were excluded from CAP clinical trials. 
Some case reports and published studies suggest the need for a higher dose of ceftaroline fosamil in 
cystic fibrosis patients due to possibility of altered ceftaroline pharmacokinetics leading to 
sub-therapeutic levels. Results from a population pharmacokinetic study, based on data pooled from
various studies, overall showed no significant, clinically relevant differences in ceftaroline 
pharmacokinetic parameters in cystic fibrosis patients (age 6 years and above). Ceftaroline clearance 
was similar between cystic fibrosis patients and patients with CAP or cSSTI while ceftaroline central 
volume was similar to healthy subjects.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
The kidney was the primary target organ of toxicity in both the monkey and rat. Histopathologic 
findings included pigment deposition and inflammation of the tubular epithelium. Renal changes were 
not reversible but were reduced in severity following a 4 week recovery period.
Convulsions have been observed at relatively high exposures during single and multi-dose studies in 
both the rat and monkey (≥ 7 times to the estimated ceftaroline Cmax level of a 600 mg twice a day).
Other important toxicologic findings noted in the rat and monkey included histopathologic changes in 
the bladder and spleen.
Genetic toxicology
Ceftaroline fosamil and ceftaroline were clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay, 
however there was no evidence of mutagenic activity in an Ames test, mouse lymphoma and 
unscheduled DNA synthesis assay. Furthermore, in vivo micronucleus assays in rat and mouse were 
negative. Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted.
Reproductive toxicology
Overall, no adverse effects on fertility or post-natal development were observed in the rat at up to 
5 times the observed clinical exposure. When ceftaroline was administered during organogenesis, 
minor changes in foetal weight and delayed ossification of the interparietal bone were observed in the 
rat at exposures below that observed clinically. However, when ceftaroline was administered 
throughout pregnancy and lactation, there was no effect on pup weight or growth. Ceftaroline 
administration to pregnant rabbits resulted in an increased foetal incidence of angulated hyoid alae, a 
common skeletal variation in rabbit fetuses, at exposures similar to those observed clinically.
Juvenile toxicity
Intravenous bolus dosing of ceftaroline fosamil to suckling rats from post-natal day 7 to 20 was well 
tolerated at plasma exposures approximately 2-fold higher than those for paediatric patients. Renal 
cortical cysts were observed in all groups, including controls, on PND50. The cysts involved a small 
portion of the kidney and occurred in the absence of significant changes in either renal function or 
urinary parameters. Therefore, these findings were not considered to be adverse.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Zinforo is and what it is used for
What Zinforo is
Zinforo is an antibiotic medicine that contains the active substance ceftaroline fosamil. It belongs to a 
group of medicines called ‘cephalosporin antibiotics.’
What Zinforo is used for
Zinforo is used to treat children (from birth) and adults with:


infections of the skin and the tissues below the skin
an infection of the lungs called ‘pneumonia’
How Zinforo works
Zinforo works by killing certain bacteria, which can cause serious infections.
2. What you need to know before you use Zinforo
Do not use Zinforo:

If you are allergic to ceftaroline fosamil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6).
If you are allergic to other cephalosporin antibiotics
If you have had previous severe allergic reactions to other antibiotics like penicillin or 
carbapenem. 


Do not use Zinforo if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse 
before using Zinforo.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Zinforo:



If you have kidney problems (your doctor may have to prescribe a lower dose)
If you have ever had fits (seizures or convulsions)
If you have ever had any non-severe allergic reactions to other antibiotics like penicillin or 
carbapenem
24

If you have had severe diarrhoea whilst taking antibiotics in the past
You may get another infection caused by another bacteria during or following treatment with Zinforo.
You may develop signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions such as fever, joint pain, skin rash, red 
scaly rash, skin bumps that contain pus, blisters or peeling of skin, red circular patches often with 
central blisters on the trunk, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes. If this happens talk to 
your doctor or nurse immediately.
Lab Test
You may develop an abnormal lab test (called Coombs test) that looks for certain antibodies which 
may act against your red blood cells. If the level of your red blood cells fall your doctor may check to 
see if these antibodies have caused this.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before using 
Zinforo.
Other medicines and Zinforo
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tell your doctor before using Zinforo if you are pregnant. Do not use this medicine during pregnancy 
unless your doctor has told you to.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Zinforo may cause side effects such as dizziness. This may impair your ability to drive or operate 
machinery.
3.
How to use Zinforo
Zinforo will be given to you by a doctor or nurse. 
How much to use
The usual recommended dose for adults is 600 mg every 12 hours. Your doctor may increase your 
dose to 600 mg every 8 hours for some infections. The usual recommended dose for children depends 
on the age and weight of the child and is given every 8 or 12 hours. It is given as a drip into a vein 
lasting 5 to 60 minutes if you receive the usual dose or 120 minutes if you receive an increased dose. 
A course of treatment usually lasts for 5 to 14 days for skin infections and 5 to 7 days for pneumonia.
Patients with kidney problems
If you have kidney problems your doctor may lower your dose because Zinforo is removed from your 
body by the kidneys.
If you use more Zinforo than you should
If you think you have been given too much Zinforo, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.
If you miss a dose of Zinforo
If you think you have missed a dose, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

RMP version to be assessed as part of this application: 
RMP Version number:  
3.1 
Data lock point: 
17 September 2020 
Date of final signoff:   
20 October 2023 
Rationale for submitting an updated RMP: 
In agreement with the EMA (Seq 0016 dated 9 June 2023), a new study code for the EU LEAP 
study (MRX-311 in place of MRX-310) has been implemented to allow for the MAH to 
differentiate between the LEAP study performed in the EU from the one performed in the 
United States. Additionally, the Study MRX-801 milestones have been revised to allow for the 
MAH to collect safety and efficacy data in ALGS participants for a full 1-year and to then issue 
the final report of the study results.  
Summary of significant changes in this RMP: 
The study code for the EU LEAP study (MRX-311) and the Study MRX-801 milestones have 
been updated throughout the RMP.

Livmarli® 
Centralised Procedure 
Chemical class: inhibitor of the apical sodium-dependent bile 
acid transporter/ileal bile acid transporter/solute carrier family 
10 (sodium/bile acid cotransporter family) member 2 
(ASBT/IBAT/SLC10A2) 
Summary of mode of action: Maralixibat (formerly known as 
SHP625, LUM001, and SD-5613) is an inhibitor of the 
ASBT/IBAT/SLC10A2, a transmembrane protein localised on 
the luminal surface of ileal enterocytes. By virtue of its ability 
to inhibit bile acid absorption, it thereby increases faecal bile 
acid excretion and lowers serum bile acid. 
Important information about its composition: Contains 
maralixibat drug substance (Maralixibat chloride) and 
excipients, including propylene glycol, sucralose, grape 
flavour, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 
dihydrate, and purified water. For each excipient, the 
projected daily intake of the excipient at the highest proposed 
clinical dose of Maralixibat is well below the acceptable  daily 
intake of the substance established for foods. 
Maralixibat was designed to be minimally absorbed after oral 
administration by virtue of its large molecular weight 
(~710 Da) and the presence of a positively charged quaternary 
nitrogen atom. 
See Module 1.3.1 for Prescribing Information provided in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
Current: The indication for maralixibat is for the “Treatment of 
cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) 
2 months of age and older.” 
Proposed: Not applicable.

Is/will the product be 
subject to additional 
monitoring? 
Current: Mirum is proposing a dose of 400 µg/kg once daily 
for cholestatic disease in patients with ALGS. Dosing is 
proposed to begin at 200 µg/kg once daily as the starting dose 
before (up to 30 minutes) or with a meal, in the morning, 
followed by an increase to the proposed marketed dose of 
400 µg/kg once daily after 1 week, in the absence of safety or 
tolerability concerns that would preclude dose increase. 
The doses described in this document are of Maralixibat 
chloride but are presented as “maralixibat.” For example, 
400 µg/kg Maralixibat chloride is equivalent to 380 µg/kg 
maralixibat but will be referred to as 400 µg/kg maralixibat 
throughout this document. 
Proposed: Not applicable. 
Current: Maralixibat is available as a ready-to-use oral 
solution (10 mg/mL).

Part II:   Module SI - Epidemiology of the Indication and Target Population 
Alagille Syndrome 
Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is an autosomal dominant disease with variable penetration 
multisystem disorder. The estimated prevalence of patients with ALGS with liver disease is 
1 in 30,000 to 50,000 live births worldwide (Kamath et al. 2018b). The diagnosis is based on 
the presence of intrahepatic bile duct paucity on liver biopsy in association with at least 3 of 
the major clinical features: chronic cholestasis, cardiac disease, skeletal abnormalities, ocular 
abnormalities, vascular abnormalities, and characteristic facial features. Blood levels of 
markers of bile duct obstruction, including gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP), usually are significantly elevated. Elevations of serum bilirubin up to 
30 times normal and serum bile salts up to 100 times normal are not uncommon. Cholesterol 
levels may exceed 1000–2000 mg/dL. Multiple xanthomas are common sequelae of the 
disease (Coates et al. 1986). The symptoms of ALGS usually present in the first 3 months of 
life (Kamath et al. 2018b). The 20-year predicted life expectancy is 75% for all patients, 
80% for those not requiring liver transplantation, and 60% for those who required liver 
transplantation (Emerick et al. 1999). 
Cholestasis often leads to hepatocellular injury and progressive liver disease that ultimately 
requires liver transplantation. It has been reported that only 24% to 41% of patients with 
ALGS survive with their native liver into adulthood (Kamath et al. 2020; Vandriel et al. 2020). 
Pruritus represents a significant unaddressed clinical burden in ALGS, affecting 59% to 88% 
of patients with ALGS, of whom up to 45% experience severe pruritus (Kamath et al. 2018b). 
Liver transplant is a main indication for intractable pruritus even in the absence of liver failure 
(Mattei et al. 2006). 
Pruritus in ALGS is associated with a significant burden on the quality of life. In a recently 
published study of pruritus in 32 patients with ALGS, the majority of patients and caregivers 
reported difficulty staying and falling asleep despite the use of anti-pruritic medication in over 
70% of patients. In addition, over one-third of patients reported skin lesions due to scratching 
(Kamath et al. 2018a). Xanthomas can also be burdensome and cause cosmetic or even 
functional problems. Both pruritus and xanthomas may warrant biliary diversion or liver 
transplant in their own right, but both interventions have significant costs and a lifelong burden 
for the patients and families (Kamath et al. 2018a). 
The management of cholestasis in patients with ALGS remains largely supportive. 
Surgical interruption of the enterohepatic circulation by ileal bypass (ileal exclusion) or partial 
external biliary diversion has been successfully used to treat cholestasis, 
hypercholesterolaemia, and pruritus (Emerick and Whitington 2002; Modi et al. 2007). 
However, both carry procedural risks (e.g., bleeding, infections, and surgical complications). 
External diversion also presents the long-term burden of caring for patients with a stoma and 
often an impact on the patient’s psychosocial development, especially during adolescence 
(Emerick et al. 1999; Kamath et al. 2018b). 
Significantly fluctuating and elevated transaminase levels are a hallmark of ALGS, and 
elevations approaching 300 U/L have been reported (Liu et al. 2018). Tremendous intrapatient 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) variability has been identified in patients with ALGS-related 
cholestasis. In an analysis of 293 children with ALGS from a multicenter observational study 
(Kamath et al. 2020), the SD of the variation of the log10 base–transformed ALT was 
approximately 0.18, which means that ALT can vary from 56% lower to 129% higher for 
95% of the time in a given individual. Changes in median ALT and aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) with age reached statistical significance in this analysis.

Part II:   Module SII - Nonclinical Part of the Safety Specification 
The nonclinical development of maralixibat for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease is 
supported by a series of toxicology studies in mice, rats, dogs, rabbits, and monkeys, including 
single-dose toxicity studies, repeat-dose toxicity studies, genotoxicity studies, reproductive 
toxicity studies, carcinogenicity studies, and juvenile toxicity studies. To support the chronic 
dosing of maralixibat in the proposed clinical indication, chronic toxicity testing was 
completed in 2 animal species, up to 6 months in rats and up to 1 year in dogs. The oral route 
of administration was selected for the definitive in vivo toxicity studies since it is the intended 
clinical route of administration. Module 2.4 discusses the in vitro; in vivo; safety 
pharmacology; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME); pharmacokinetic; 
and toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and development and reproductive toxicity 
nonclinical studies conducted. 
Nonclinical pharmacology studies indicate that maralixibat inhibits bile acid reabsorption and 
lowers serum total cholesterol. In vivo, maralixibat increases total bile acid excretion in rats, 
dogs, and monkeys in a dose-dependent manner. Maralixibat increases the activities of hepatic 
cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- coenzyme A reductase in dogs, 
consistent with inhibition of bile acid reabsorption. 
No significant changes were observed in rat neurobehavioral, dog cardiovascular, or guinea pig 
pulmonary function safety pharmacology studies following single oral or intravenous (IV) 
administration of maralixibat. 
Maralixibat was determined to have a very low bioavailability (≤0.5%) in the mouse, rat, 
rabbit, and dog. Exposures (maximum observed concentration occurring at the time sampled 
during a dosing interval and area under the curve) to maralixibat free form, although low after 
oral administration, increased after repeat-dose administration at the highest doses tested 
(500 mg/kg/day in the rat and 600 mg/kg/day in the dog). There was no evidence of 
pronounced sex-related differences in plasma concentrations of maralixibat free form. The 
bioavailability of maralixibat free form did not markedly differ in fed and fasted animals, and 
the exposure of dogs to maralixibat free form was similar after administration of maralixibat as 
either a solution or as neat chemical in a capsule. The low bioavailability results from low or 
negligible absorption and not from a hepatic first-pass effect. 
The available data support the description of maralixibat as being minimally absorbed into the 
systemic circulation after oral administration. 
The most significant effect observed in rodents administered oral maralixibat was a 
prolongation of coagulation times. Prolongation of coagulation times was observed primarily in 
male rats and was reversible, and available data suggest it is a rodent-specific effect. 
Oral gavage administration of maralixibat to rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day (males)  and 
500 mg/kg/day (females) for 13 weeks resulted in mild elevations of prothrombin time (PT) 
and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) with no associated haemorrhage (no 
observed-adverse-effect level [NOAEL] 150 mg/kg/day). Minimal prolongation of PT was 
observed in dogs in the 100-mg/kg/day group after 12 months of dosing. 
Several reversible changes were observed in rats and were considered to be related to the 
pharmacologic activity of maralixibat. These included minimal increases in serum levels of 
hepatic transaminases (AST, ALT) and mild to moderate decreases in absolute and relative 
liver weights. An increased frequency of emesis was observed in dogs administered 
100 mg/kg/day of maralixibat (NOAEL 20 mg/kg/day). 
Emesis was the primary toxicity observed in the dog and usually was dose-limiting. Acute oral 
doses up to 200 mg/kg maralixibat were well tolerated in dogs. Acute IV administration of 
Final V3.1

maralixibat in dogs and rats caused tremors, reduced activity, and transient ataxia. Oral 
administration of maralixibat for up to 26 weeks in rats (at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day) and 
2 weeks in monkeys (at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day) was clinically well tolerated without signs 
of emesis, diarrhoea, or weight loss. 
Two juvenile rat toxicokinetic studies were conducted with oral gavage administration of 
maralixibat in single and consecutive doses. In the first study, maralixibat was well tolerated 
in weanling rats even at high dose levels. Juvenile rats were administered maralixibat at doses 
of up to 200 mg/kg/day in the males and up to 1000 mg/kg/day in the females; no 
maralixibat-related effects on clinical observations, body weights, food consumption, 
behaviour, ophthalmology parameters, or sexual maturation were observed. There were no 
test-article–related effects on any parameter examined except for minor decrease in adrenal 
gland weights in males and increased liver weights in females. 
In the second study, juvenile rats were administered maralixibat for 15 days (postnatal day 
(PND)7 through PND21) at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day in males and up to 1000 mg/kg/day in 
females. Four deaths (1 female at 500 mg/kg/day and 3 females at 1000 mg/kg/day) were 
attributed to the test article. Clinical observations and decreased body weight and body weight 
gain were noted in females at ≥500 mg/kg/day. Increased mean ALP and triglyceride values 
were observed in the 1000-mg/kg/day females and decreased mean globulin with increased 
albumin to globulin ratios was observed in all female groups. 
A full development and reproductive toxicity (DART) package is complete for maralixibat. In 
the female portion of the rat fertility study, there was a slight reduction in the mean numbers of 
corpora lutea, implantation sites, and viable foetuses per dam in the 500- and 2000-mg/kg/day 
groups. No treatment-related effects were seen at any dose level on male fertility, and no 
effects on mating were noted in either sex. Results from rat and rabbit embryo/fetal 
development studies with doses up to 1000 and 250 mg/kg/day, respectively, demonstrated no 
observed adverse effects on fetal growth or development. In the pre- and postnatal 
development study at doses up to 750 mg/kg/day, there was no reported maternal toxicity (F0), 
F1 developmental/neonatal toxicity, F1 parental systemic toxicity, F1 reproductive toxicity, or 
F2 neonatal toxicity when maralixibat was administered continuously in the diet to F0 female 
rats during gestation and lactation. 
Maralixibat demonstrated no evidence of mutagenic activity in vitro and no clastogenic 
activity in vitro or in vivo. However, 3 impurities tested positive (mutagenic) in the bacterial 
reverse mutation assay and are being tested and controlled through specifications in the drug 
substance. 
In conclusion, repeat oral dosing of maralixibat for up to 26 weeks in rats and 12 months in 
dogs revealed no direct adverse effects on clinical pathology parameters, ophthalmology, 
electrocardiography (dogs) or macroscopic and histopathology parameters. Additionally, 
maralixibat did not demonstrate genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. In the juvenile rat, 
maralixibat was well tolerated when administered during neonatal development.

Alagille Syndrome Programme 
Page 10 of 47 
Maralixibat (also known as SD-5613, LUM001, or SHP625) has been studied in over 
1600 participants, including over 180 paediatric or adult participants with cholestatic liver 
disease. Over 120 paediatric participants have been exposed to maralixibat. Some of these 
participants have reached over 5 years of total maralixibat exposure. 
The clinical program in patients with ALGS includes five completed Phase 2 studies in 
paediatric participants with ALGS (LUM001-301, -302, -303, -304, -305), one ongoing 
Phase 2 study in paediatric participants with ALGS or PFIC (MRX-800), one ongoing Phase 2 
study in infants with ALGS or PFIC (MRX-801), and an ongoing expanded-access program for 
patients with ALGS. 
Given that the safety profile of maralixibat in ALGS was based upon an analysis conducted on 
the five completed Phase 2 studies in ALGS, all presented cumulative exposure data are based 
upon this pooled population for the ALGS indication. Cumulative exposure for the ALGS 
indication is presented in Table 1. Exposure data in years and months for the ALGS indication 
are presented in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. 
Cumulative exposure by age, sex, and racial group is presented in Table 4 and Table 5 for the 
ALGS indication.

Part II:   Module SIV - Populations Not Studied in Clinical Trials 
As of September 2020, a total 86 paediatric participants have received maralixibat in 
completed studies of ALGS. 
As shown in Table 5, there is limited exposure to date among diverse ethnicities. It is not 
anticipated that there would be any meaningful differences in the safety of maralixibat across 
different ethnicities. 
Maralixibat has not been studied in the elderly, in participants with renal impairment or 
end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis, or in participants with end-stage liver failure 
or advanced cirrhosis; these patients are not expected to receive maralixibat. 
Maralixibat has also not been studied in pregnant or lactating women.

Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies within the Development 
Programme 
In the completed pivotal clinical study (LUM001-304) as well as the completed supporting 
studies (LUM001-301, -302, -303, -305), the primary exclusion criteria included 
hypersensitivity to maralixibat or any of its excipients, current or sequelae from chronic 
diarrhoea, presence of other liver disease or history of or planned transplant, history of or 
current alcohol or substance abuse, abnormal liver function tests at screening, and subjects 
with a history of or current atopic dermatitis or other noncholestatic diseases associated with 
pruritus (see Table 6).

SIV.2  Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programmes 
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions, 
such as adverse reactions that are uncommon, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those 
caused by prolonged or cumulative exposure. 
SIV.3  Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under-Represented in 
Clinical Trial Development Programs 
The clinical programme has excluded pregnant or breastfeeding women. In addition, to date, 
patients with renal impairment or end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis, end-stage 
liver failure or advanced cirrhosis, or immune or cardiac impairment (other than those 
associated with ALGS) have also been excluded from clinical trial participation; therefore, data 
in these populations are not available. Maralixibat has not been studied in the elderly. 
The exposure of special populations in the clinical development programmes is displayed in

Cardiovascular anomalies are present in more 
than 90% of patients with ALGS. Involvement 
of the pulmonary outflow tract is the most 
common type of congenital heart disease, with 
some form of peripheral pulmonary stenosis 
(PPS) affecting at least two-thirds of cases 
(Turnpenny and Ellard 2012). 
Patients with comorbid cardiovascular 
impairment as part of the diagnosis of ALGS 
were included in the clinical development 
program. Patients with mild, moderate, and 
severe hepatic impairment as defined by 
NCI-ODWG criteria (Synold et al. 2007) were 
also included in the clinical development 
program, see SmPC Sections 4.2 and 5.2. 
The remaining comorbidities have not been 
included in the clinical development programme. 
The current clinical development programme for 
maralixibat has been focused on rare cholestatic 
liver diseases, primarily in the paediatric patient 
population, which includes 86 patients in ALGS 
studies. 
The current global programme has been 
conducted in primarily White participants in 
those studies where race was available or 
collected. To date, 6 Black/African American 
participants and 2 Asian participants have been 
treated in the ALGS studies. Race information 
was not collected in Study LUM001-304. No 
participants known to be of Latino/Hispanic 
origin have been treated in ALGS studies to

Part II:  Module SV - Post-Authorisation Experience 
As of the data lock point of this RMP, maralixibat is an investigational product. Maralixibat is 
not approved in any country, and it has not been withdrawn from any market. There has been no 
marketing experience with this drug to date. 
Part II:  Module SVI - Additional EU Requirements for the Safety 
Specification 
Based on the mechanism of action, maralixibat is not anticipated to show a potential for drug 
abuse or dependence; hence, there is no anticipated potential for misuse for illegal purposes. 
Part II:  Module SVII - Identified and Potential Risks 
Mirum Pharmaceuticals performed a review and analysis of adverse event (AE) data from 
clinical studies included in the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) evaluating 
maralixibat for the treatment of patients with ALGS. Safety data were reviewed from a pooled 
population (Integrated Summary of Safety population) comprising five Phase 2 studies in ALGS 
(Studies LUM001-301, LUM001-302, LUM001-303, LUM001-304, and LUM001-305). The 
database cutoff date for data to be included in this adverse drug reaction (ADR) analysis is 
17 September 2020. 
Based on the nonclinical and clinical research available to date, the identified risks (ADRs) 
associated with the use of maralixibat in the indication of ALGS are diarrhoea and abdominal 
pain; neither is considered an important safety concern at this time. Hepatotoxicity is considered 
an important potential risk for maralixibat.

Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission 
Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety 
Concerns in the RMP 
The identified risks (ADRs) associated with the use of maralixibat in the indication of ALGS are 
diarrhoea and abdominal pain; neither is considered an important safety concern at this time. 
With data from up to 4 years on treatment, these effects are not shown to increase with increased 
dosing or time on treatment, and they typically resolve in less than a week, which demonstrates 
that these effects are transient in nature. 
Hepatotoxicity is the only important potential risk for maralixibat.  Reason for not including an 
identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in the RMP: 
Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the 
indication treated): 
The gastrointestinal (GI)-related AEs observed with maralixibat—diarrhoea and abdominal 
pain—are mechanism-based due to elevated bile acid concentrations in the colon and, 
therefore, are not unexpected. They are considered to have minimal clinical impact on 
patients in relation to the severity of the indications treated. 
Consistent with the previous clinical programme of hypercholesterolaemia in adults, the most 
commonly reported ADRs in the current clinical programme of cholestatic liver diseases are 
abdominal cramping/pain and diarrhoea/loose stools. No treatment-related events of diarrhea 
or abdominal pain were serious, no treatment-related events of diarrhea were severe (i.e., 
Grade ≥3), and only one patient (1.2% of the ALGS safety population, N=86) had a 
treatment-related event of Grade ≥3 abdominal pain. Additionally, these events were 
transient (median duration 2 days for diarrhoea, 1 day for abdominal pain) and resolved for 
the majority of participants while remaining on treatment. No events of abdominal pain or 
diarrhoea resulted in discontinuation of maralixibat in the clinical studies comprising the 
current development programme. 
Known risks that require no further characterization and are followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance—namely, through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting—and 
for whom the risk minimisation message in the product information is adhered by prescribers 
(e.g., actions being part of standard clinical practice in each EU Member state where the 
product is authorised): 
The above GI risks, diarrhoea and abdominal pain, require no further characterisation and 
will be followed up via routine pharmacovigilance—namely, through signal detection and 
adverse reaction reporting. Risk-minimisation measures recommended in the product 
information (SmPC) are considered part of standard clinical practice and are as follows: 
•  From Section 4.4:  “Diarrhoea has been reported as a very common adverse reaction 
when taking maralixibat (section 4.8). Diarrhoea may lead to dehydration. Patients 
should be monitored regularly to ensure adequate hydration during episodes of 
diarrhoea.” 
•  From Section 4.8:   “If diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain persist and no other 
etiologies are found, reducing the dose or interrupting treatment should be 
considered. Dehydration should be monitored and treated promptly. If dosing with 
Livmarli is interrupted, Livmarli can be restarted as tolerated when diarrhoea or 
abdominal pain improve (Section 4.2).”

In addition, the following guidance is provided to patients and caregivers in the Package 
leaflet, (Section 2): 
•  Talk to your doctor if your diarrhoea gets worse while taking Livmarli. If you get 
diarrhoea, drink plenty of liquids so you do not become dehydrated. 
SVII.1.2. 
Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP 
Important Potential Risk: Hepatotoxicity 
Data from the long-term extension studies in participants with ALGS shows that ALT 
increased was the most commonly reported event (6 participants; 7.1%) that led to 
discontinuation of maralixibat. Events were considered related or possibly related to 
maralixibat; however, the large underlying intrapatient ALT variability observed in the 
natural history of ALGS (Kamath et al. 2020), is an alternative explanation. Given the 
limited data in the target population, the potential risk of hepatotoxicity requires further 
characterization.   
Continued surveillance of hepatic safety is recommended in the product information, and 
evaluation is planned via additional pharmacovigilance measures to further characterize this 
risk. If confirmed, hepatoxicity will have an impact on the benefit/risk ratio.  Therefore, 
hepatotoxicity is included as an important potential risk in the RMP.

Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, and 
Missing Information 
Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential 
Risks 
Important Potential Risk:  Hepatotoxicity 
Potential mechanisms: 
No mechanism of action for maralixibat to potentially cause hepatoxic effects is currently 
known.  
There is currently no evidence that maralixibat causes bilirubin elevations in patients with 
ALGS. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
Laboratory data showed elevations in transaminases in some ALGS participants during 
treatment; most of the values were considered non-serious. Serious adverse events or 
autoimmune hepatitis (1 participant) and chronic hepatic failure (1 participant) were reported. 
However, involvement of the underlying disease cannot be excluded.  During the long-term 
extension trials, 6 (7.1%) participants discontinued the trial due to ALT increases that were all 
assessed as related or possibly related to study drug. However, it is a difficult population to 
assess because of wide variability in the severity of the underlying disease and the preexistence 
or development of advanced liver disease. Due to the small overall sample size in the clinical 
studies in ALGS participants, further evaluation is needed.  
Characterization of the risk: 
A group of paediatric hepatologists adjudicated 27 suspected cases within the maralixibat 
development programme for ALGS treatment. The group reached the conclusion that of the 
27 cases, 6 were considered possibly and 1 probably related to the study drug. One case was 
considered as probably drug-associated liver injury. They assessed 24 of 27 cases as of low 
concern and 3 as of medium concern. In addition, during the long-term extension trials, 
6 participants (7.1%) discontinued the trial due to ALT increases that were all assessed as related 
or possibly related to drug.  
However, due to the overall small sample size of the clinical studies and the underlying disease 
also potentially affecting liver function parameters, a final conclusion cannot be drawn and 
further evaluation is needed. Hepatotoxicity will be further evaluated post-marketing in the EU 
LEAP study (MRX-311), MRX-800, and MRX-801. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Currently, there are no risk factors or groups that have been observed to be at risk for 
hepatotoxicity with maralixibat treatment. The natural history comparison by Kamath et al. 
(2020) demonstrated that elevation of ALT is common in the ALGS population (varying from 
56% lower to 129% higher for 95% of the time in a given individual), that this increase is 
associated with increased age, and that there was no significant difference in such elevations with 
or without maralixibat treatment.  
No dose-relationship has been seen in patients with ALGS who experienced elevated 
transaminases while on treatment with maralixibat. No additive or synergistic effects with other 
drugs are known to occur with the introduction of maralixibat treatment. 
Final V3.1 
 
 
Mirum Pharmaceuticals International B.V. 
Risk Management Plan for Maralixibat Chloride 
Preventability: 
Page 22 of 47
40 
Currently, there are no data on predictability of hepatotoxicity or factors that could increase the 
risk of hepatotoxicity with administration of maralixibat. However, early detection of elevations 
of liver enzymes could mitigate occurrence of hepatotoxicity.  
Therefore, liver function should be monitored in patients prior to start and during treatment with 
maralixibat. Additionally, close monitoring is advised for patients with end-stage liver disease or 
(progression to) decompensation. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Elevations in transaminases have been seen in the ALGS development programme for 
maralixibat that may be a sign of hepatotoxicity. However, due to the underlying disease 
affecting the liver and since the population is very limited, more data are needed to conclude 
whether there is a hepatotoxicity risk with maralixibat. If the risk will be confirmed, this will 
have an impact on the benefit/risk of the product; accordingly, it is considered important and, as 
such, included in the RMP as an important potential risk. Further characterization for the 
potential risk of hepatotoxicity via the proposed EU LEAP study (MRX-311; Long-Term Safety 
and Clinical Outcomes of Livmarli in Patients with Alagille Syndrome) and within the ongoing 
Studies MRX-800 and MRX-801 is expected to provide additional data that may help in the 
clarification of the nature of the hepatic findings in patients with ALGS being treated with 
maralixibat. The data are expected to allow a more thorough analysis to determine whether 
maralixibat is hepatotoxic. With the current data on efficacy, the benefit/risk balance is 
considered to be favorable for patients with ALGS. 
Public health impact: 
The indication for use of maralixibat in the post-market setting includes ALGS in children 
2 months of age and older wherein elevations of liver enzymes in this specific population is 
common. The estimate of events of hepatotoxicity or elevated liver enzymes in patients treated 
with maralixibat is anticipated to be similar to the background rate of these events in patients not 
treated with maralixibat. 
SVII.3.2. 
Presentation of the Missing Information  
Carcinogenic Potential 
There were higher incidences of bronchiolo-alveolar adenoma and carcinoma in male RasTG 
mice administered 25 mg/kg/day maralixibat compared with concurrent study vehicle controls. 
However, the incidences of these findings were still within the range of those observed in 
historical controls of this mouse strain, and while the implication of this finding for human risk 
assessment is unknown, it cannot be ruled out that these findings are maralixibat-related. In rat 
repeat-dose toxicity studies, GI mucosal epithelial alterations (e.g., crowding/proliferation of 
crypt cells) were observed that may theoretically indicate a risk of future carcinogenic 
transformation. No gastrointestinal cancers have been observed in humans to date for 5 years. 
Based on this situation, “carcinogenic potential” is considered as Missing Information. A 2-year 
rat carcinogenicity study is ongoing, with final report expected in late 2023.

Part VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Livmarli (Maralixibat Chloride) 
This is a summary of the RMP for Livmarli. The RMP details important risks for Livmarli 
and how more information will be obtained about Livmarli’s risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
The Livmarli SmPC and its package leaflet give essential information to healthcare 
professionals and patients on how Livmarli should be used. 
This summary of the RMP of Livmarli should be read in the context of all this information, 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of 
which are part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates to the 
Livmarli RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Livmarli is authorized for the “treatment of cholestastic pruritus in patients with Alagille 
syndrome (ALGS) 2 months of age and older.” (see the SmPC for the full indication). It 
contains maralixibat chloride as the active substance, and it is given as ready-to-use oral 
solution. 
Further information about the evaluation of Livmarli’s benefits can be found in 
Livmarli’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage. 
II.  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise 
the risks 
Important risks of Livmarli, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Livmarli’s risks, are outlined below: 
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging, including a package leaflet; 
The authorised pack size—the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status—the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. In addition to these 
measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and regularly 
analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report assessment, so that timely and appropriate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Livmarli is not yet available, it is 
listed under “Missing Information” below.

II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Livmarli are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. 
Page 33 of 47
40 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Livmarli. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further 
evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of 
the medicine):

Final V3.1 
Laboratory data showed elevations in transaminases in some 
ALGS participants during treatment; most of the values were 
considered non-serious. Serious adverse events or 
autoimmune hepatitis (1 participant) and chronic hepatic failure 
(1 participant) were reported. However, involvement of the 
underlying disease cannot be excluded. During the long-term 
extension trials, 6 (7.1%) participants discontinued the trial due 
to ALT increases that were all assessed as related or possibly 
related to study drug. However, it is a difficult population to 
assess because of wide variability in the severity of the 
underlying disease and the preexistence or development of 
advanced liver disease. Due to the small overall sample size in 
the clinical studies in ALGS participants, further evaluation is 
needed.  
Currently, there are no risk factors and risk groups that have 
been observed to be at risk for hepatotoxicity with maralixibat 
treatment. The natural history comparison by Kamath et al. 
(2020) demonstrated that elevation of ALT is common in the 
ALGS population, (varying from 56% lower to 129% higher 
for 95% of the time in a given individual), that this increase is 
associated with increased age, and that there was no 
significant difference in such elevations with or without 
maralixibat treatment. 
No dose-relationship has been seen in patients with ALGS 
who experienced elevated transaminases while on treatment 
with maralixibat. No additive or synergistic effects with other 
drugs are known to occur with the introduction of maralixibat 
treatment.

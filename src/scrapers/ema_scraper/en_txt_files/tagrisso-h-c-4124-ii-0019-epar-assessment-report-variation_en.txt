2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Osimertinib  (TAGRISSO™2)  is  an  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor-tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  (EGFR-
TKI),  first  approved  by  the  EMA  in  2016  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)  T790M  mutation-positive  non-small  cell  lung 
cancer (NSCLC).  
This application is being submitted to support the additional indication for use of osimertinib 80 mg (40 
mg and 80 mg oral tablets) once daily (QD), as first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC whose tumours have EGFR exon 19 deletions (Ex19del) or substitution of a leucine 
with an arginine at position 858 in exon 21 (L858R) mutations. 
Disease background 
Despite progress in early detection and treatment, in 70% to 80% of patients, NSCLC is diagnosed at a 
locally  advanced  or  metastatic  stage  (AJCC  Stage  IIIB  and  IV;  referred  to  as  advanced  hereafter), 
when it is no longer amenable to curative surgery or chemoradiation (Besse et al 2014). Furthermore, 
a  significant  percentage  of  early-stage  NSCLC  patients  who  have  undergone  surgery  subsequently 
have recurrence with distant metastases and die as a result of their lung cancer, with 30% to 49% of 
early-stage  patients  surviving  for  5  years  (Carnio  et  al  2011,  Hung  et  al  2012,  Uramoto  &  Tanaka 
2014, Varela & Thomas 2014) and a much lower 5- year survival rate was observed for patients who 
did not undergo surgery (Rosen et al 2016). In summary, advanced NSCLC is an incurable condition. 
Recent  advances  in  the  knowledge  of  tumour-specific  genomic  abnormalities  have  enabled  the 
identification of specific molecular targets for NSCLC treatment in the current clinical practice (Keedy et 
al 2011, Leighl et al 2014, NCCN 2017, Novello et al 2016, Travis et al 2011). Several biomarkers have 
shown  to  be  predictive  of  therapeutic  efficacy  of  molecularly  targeted  agents  and  immune-oncology 
agents, including the presence of sensitising EGFR mutations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene 
rearrangement,  ROS  proto-oncogene  1  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  (ROS1)  gene  rearrangement  and 
overexpression of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and all these biomarkers are now routinely 
tested to establish the optimal treatment choice. 
The  EGFR  is  a  member  of  the  ErbB  family  of  receptors  tyrosine  kinases  that  are  essential  to  cell 
proliferation  and  survival  (Shea  et  al  2016).  The  sensitising  mutations  in  the  kinase  domain  of  EGFR 
increase  the  affinity  of  EGFR  towards  EGFR-TKIs  over  ATP  and  are  found  in  approximately  15%  of 
patients  with  lung  cancer  in  the  US  (Keedy  et  al  2011),  10%  of  patients  with  lung  cancer  in  the 
European Economic Area (Barlesi et al 2013, Esteban et al 2015, Gahr et al 2013, Herbst et al 2008, 
Rosell  et  al  2009),  and  30%  to  50%  of  patients  with  lung  cancer  in  Asia  (Ahn  et  al.  2015,  Han  et  al 
2015, Shi et al 2014, Tokumo et al 2005, Yoshida et al 2007). 
In addition to the higher prevalence of EGFR mutations in Asian patients, overall, EGFR mutations have 
been  found  to  be  more  frequent  in  never-smokers,  patients  with  the  adenocarcinoma  histological 
subtype, and in women (Marchetti et al 2005, Novello et al 2016). 
The two most frequent sensitising mutations are Ex19del and L858R that account for 85-90% of EGFR-
TKI-sensitising  mutations  found  in  NSCLC  (Lynch  et  al  2004;  Paez  et  al  2004).  Tumours  harbouring 
these  mutations  are  particularly  sensitive  towards  EGFR-TKIs  and  undergo  significant  apoptosis  in 
response  to  exposure  to  these  agents  (Mitsudomi  and  Yatabe  2010).  Multiple  randomised  clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/396618/2018 
Page 8/131 
 
  
 
 
studies  have  shown  that  the  presence  of  common  sensitising  EGFR  mutations  in  patients  with 
advanced  NSCLC  is  predictive  of  response  and  improved  treatment  outcome  to  EGFR-TKIs.  Patients 
with  less  common  sensitising  EGFR  mutations  such  as  L861Q  or  G719X,  while  still  benefitting  from 
EGFR-TKIs, have a lesser magnitude of benefit. 
Current standard of care in the proposed indication 
Molecular testing of tumours in patients with advanced NSCLC is now established practice to determine 
the preferred choice as first-line therapy. 
Epidermal  growth  factor  receptor-  TKIs  such  as  such  as  gefitinib,  erlotinib,  afatinib  are  the  current 
standard of care (SoC) as first-line therapy for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC (NCCN 2017, Novello et 
al 2016). 
Though  most  tumours  initially  respond  well  systemically  to  the  currently  approved  EGFRTKIs  in  first-
line setting, the vast majority of patients develop TKI resistance with a median PFS of 9 to 13 months. 
In  approximately  50%  to 65%  of  the  patients  the  resistance  is  due  to  the  development of  a  second-
site  EGFR-TKI  resistance-conferring  'gatekeeper'  point  mutation,  T790M  leading  to  treatment  failure 
and disease progression (Jackman et al 2009, Maemondo et al 2010, Mitsudomi et al 2010, Mok et al 
2009, Oxnard et al 2011, Rosell et al 2012, Sebastian et al 2014). 
Patients who develop, or are diagnosed with, central nervous system (CNS) metastases currently have 
limited treatment options resulting in poorer outcomes (Mak et al 2015). Limited data are available on 
the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs against CNS metastases in first-line setting, given that CNS metastases have 
been a typical exclusion criterion in historical studies involving these agents (Bartolotti et al 2012). A 
selection  of  trials  studying  the  activity  of  EGFR-TKIs  in  patients  with  NSCLC  harbouring  EGFR 
mutations and CNS metastases report response rates of 70-85% (Zimmermann et al 2014). 
Despite  significant  progress  achieved  since  the  introduction  of  EGFR-TKIs  into  clinical  practice  more 
than  a  decade  ago,  there  is  still  a  considerable  unmet  medical  need  for  new  treatment  options  for 
patients in this disease setting. Inevitably, a majority of patients develop resistance to EGFR-TKIs with 
the  most  common  resistance  being  associated  with  secondary  T790M  mutation.  In  sites  of  very 
common metastatic disease such as the CNS, the suboptimal exposure provided by currently approved 
EGFR-TKIs allows the disease to spread into the CNS and the formation of CNS metastases. 
The applicant requested the approval for the following indication:  
TAGRISSO is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  whose  tumours  have  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR) 
exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations. 
The  indication  approved by  the  CHMP  was  as  follows:  TAGRISSO  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for the 
first-line  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer 
(NSCLC) with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Conclusion 
>  0.01  threshold 
(N) 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted with this new indication of Tagrisso, which is considered 
acceptable. 
In relation to the ERA, due to the lack of robust epidemiology data available for the prevalence of exon 
19  deletions  and  exon  21  (L858R)  substitution  mutations,  the  prevalence  rate  was  not  refined  for 
mutation status of EGFR NSCLC and the revised assessment uses a worst-case scenario and is based 
on the incidence of all EGFR mutations (7-13%).  
Thus, the highest reported incidence rates of NSCLC (89%) and EGFR mutation (13%) were applied to 
the overall prevalence rate of lung cancer for Hungary (European member state with the highest single 
year prevalence of lung cancer) to calculate the market penetration factor (Fpen = 0.000058). 
The data show that the refined PECsurfacewater value for osimertinib mesylate is below the action limit 
of 0.01 µg/L and it is not a PBT substance, as log Dow does not exceed the trigger value of 4.5. The 
octanol-water partition values indicate that the risk of bioaccumulation is low.  
Thus, osimertinib mesylate is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
In  addition,  as  required  by  Directive  2001/83/EC  and  EMA  Quality  Review  Document,  the  following 
statement  has  been  included  in  the  Tagrisso  package  leaflet:  Do  not  throw  away  any  medicines  via 
wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. 
These measures will help protect the environment.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of osimertinib.  
Considering the above data, osimertinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) of osimertinib and its main metabolite (AZ5104) in NSCLC patients with the 
T790M mutation have been characterised in the initial MA and variations submitted post authorisation. 
This submission provides an updated population PK analysis where the FLAURA data have been added 
to the data set. As in the previous submissions, data from paediatric subjects were not available.  
Plasma  samples  for  osimertinib  and  AZ5104  were  assayed  using  a  liquid  chromatographic-tandem 
mass  spectrometric  (LC-MS/MS)  method.  The  lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLOQ)  was  0.05  nM  for 
osimertinib and 0.0515 nM for AZ5104. The bioanalytical methods used in FLAURA were appropriately 
validated and the results were consistent with the previous analysis. 
The objectives of the updated analysis were to 
• 
Characterize  the  PK  of  osimertinib  and  its  main  metabolite  of  interest  (AZ5104)  in  NSCLC 
patients, following oral once daily administration. 
• 
• 
Evaluate the impact of line of therapy on the PK of osimertinib. 
Update the impact of selected intrinsic and extrinsic covariates of interest on the PK variability 
of osimertinib. 
Nonlinear  mixed  effects  modelling  was  performed  using  NONMEM  v  7.3  (SAEM  estimation  method). 
Model  development  and  final  model  selection  was  driven  by  data  and  based  on  goodness-of-fit 
indicators,  including  visual  inspection  of  diagnostic  and  covariate  scatter  plots,  parameter  estimate 
precision and minimum objective function value. 
Osimeritinib  and  its  main  metabolite  (AZ5104)  have  been  characterized  by  a  linear  1-compartmental 
disposition  model  for  both  parent  and  metabolite,  with  first  order  oral  absorption  of  osimeritinib  into 
the central compartment and the formation of AZ5104 from osimeritinib (Figure 2).

Diagnostics  of  the  final  model  showed  that  the  random  effects  were  adequately  normally  distributed 
and  the  predicted  and  observed  individual  concentrations  were  generally  symmetrically  distributed 
around  the  line  of  identity.  The  different  residuals  and  the  normalized  prediction  distribution  errors 
(NPDE)  did  not  show  any  trends,  both  over  time  and  over  the  population  prediction.  The  VPCs 
suggested that the final model reasonably described the main part of the observed data. The VPCs also 
showed  that observations in  second-line  patients  are  slightly  overpredicted.  This  is  as  expected,  as it 
already  had  been  seen  in  Figure  5 that pre-dose  steady-state  concentrations  at  80  mg  were lower in 
second-line patients than in third-line patients. Additionally, the covariate analysis showed that line of 
therapy  as  a  covariate  on  CL/F  and  CLM/F  was  not  statistically  significant  and  that  the  median  effect 
was  clearly  below  20%.  The  typical  predicted  half-life  of  osimertinib  was  calculated  with  a  median  of 
44.4 hours (95% confidence interval: [41.2, 47.7] hours), which is consistent with the results from the 
previous analysis (Johnson and Schmidt 2016), in which 48 hours was determined. 
A  non-parametric  bootstrap  analysis  using  1000  bootstrapped  datasets  was  performed.  In  this 
bootstrap  analysis,  all  the  models  converged  successfully.  The  median  and  confidence  intervals  of 
parameter  estimates  derived  from  this  bootstrap  analysis  were  consistent  with  the  parameter 
estimates and confidence intervals (CI) derived from the final population PK model.

Simulations  were  conducted  to  assess  the  impact  of  identified  important  covariate/parameter 
relationships  in  the  final  PK  model.  These  simulations  considered  only  the  80  mg  dose  level.  The 
simulation  based  analysis  suggested  that  at  typical  patient  level  the  changes  in  exposure  metrics 
related  to  covariates  are  not  expected  to  show  clinically  impactful  differences.  Considering  the 
therapeutic  dose  (80  mg  once  daily),  the  worst-case  combination  of  covariates  (worst-case  selected 
based on safety considerations to obtain the highest values for osimertinib Cmax) consists of patients 
that  have  a  low  bodyweight  and  low  albumin  levels  and  are  of  Asian  (no  Chinese,  no  Japanese) 
ethnicity.  The  worst-case  combination  of  covariates  considering  the  5th  percent  of  covariate 
distribution  of  bodyweight  (43  kg)  and  baseline  albumin  (29.3  g/L)  in  the  dataset,  predicted  an 
increase  in  median  steady-state  osimertinib  Cmaxss  and  AUCss  of  approximately  59%  and  49%, 
respectively, in relation to the typical patient.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Both  population  pharmacokinetic  models  supported  dose  proportionality  of  the  dose-concentration 
relationship  (parent  and  metabolite)  across  the  20  to  240  mg  dose  range  that  was  available  in  the 
previous analysis.  
Dose-proportionality  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  osimertinib  and  AZ5104  was  already  assessed  in 
previous reports (Comisar et al 2015, Johnson and Schmidt 2016) and is not repeated in this analysis, 
as the only change was to add data from FLAURA with a planned single dose level of 80 mg. 
Special populations 
Based on in vitro data and the human ADME study (Study D5160C00011), osimertinib has been shown 
to  undergo  significant  metabolic  clearance  via  the  liver  and  hence,  a  clinical  study  to  evaluate  the 
impact  of  hepatic  impairment  (mild  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment)  on  osimertinib  exposure  has 
been completed  (study D5160C00008). The MAH has  submitted the CSR of study D5160C00008 CSR 
which is currently under evaluation (EMEA/H/C/004124/II/0024). 
Renal elimination contributes minimally to total osimertinib clearance; however, at the request of EMA, 
and  based  on  renal  impairment  maybe  affecting  some  pathways  of  hepatic  metabolism,  a  reduced 
design  study  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  severe  renal  impairment  on  osimertinib  exposure  is  ongoing 
(Study D5160C00035) as reflected in the RMP.  
Furthermore,  at  the  request  of  EMA,  a  study  to  evaluate  the  single  and  multiple  dose  effect  of 
osimertinib on the exposure of a non-CYP3A4 mediated Pregnane X receptor substrate (P-glycoprotein 
[P-gp]  substrate,  fexofenadine)  (D5160C00036)  has  been  submitted  and  is  currently  under 
assessment (EMEA/H/C/004124/II/0021).

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Osimertinib  is  an  oral,  potent,  irreversible  central  nervous  system  active  EGFR-TKI,  effective  against 
NSCLC  with  both  EGFR-TKI-sensitizing  mutations  (EGFRm+)  as  well  as  T790M  mutation  positive  (TKI 
resistance conferring mutation) forms of EGFR, but designed to have limited activity against wild type 
(WT)  EGFR  at  clinically  relevant  doses.  As  a  result,  osimertinib  can  effectively  block  EGFR  signaling 
both  in  EGFRm+  and  EGFRm+/T790M  mutation  positive  cells.  In  Phase  I,  II,  and  III  studies, 
osimertinib  has  shown  to  provide  clinically  meaningful  benefit  to  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC 
harboring the EGFR T790M resistance mutation after prior treatment with an EGFR-TKI.

Relation between PK and safety 
Left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  (LVEF)  is  considered  the  most  important  measurement  of  ventricular 
function  for  distinguishing  patients  with  cardiac  systolic  dysfunction  from  patients  with  preserved 
systolic function (Swedberg et al 2005).  
The below analysis demonstrated that there is no evidence of any quantifiable exposure-related effects 
on change from baseline LVEF value and incidence of LVEF event.

Rash and diarrhoea are the most common side effects observed with EGFR-TKIs due to wild-type EGFR

Efficacy analysis 
Although profound efficacy (BRS, DoR, BPCT and PFS) was observed upon treatment with osimertinib, 
the  magnitude  of  this  efficacy  was  generally  not  found  to  be  related  to  drug  exposure  (osimertinib 
AUCss  or  AZ5104  AUCss)  observed  in  FLAURA  and  AURA  Phase  1  studies.  This  may  possibly  be 
explained by the limited AUCss range in the analysis data. For both osimertinib and AZ5104, the AUCss 
range is predominantly determined by patients receiving the 80 mg dose. 
In  order  to  further  investigate  the  magnitude  of  efficacy  in  relation  to  drug  exposure,  a  Cox-
proportional  hazard  model  has  been  used  to  assess  the  relative  HRs  between  SoC  treatment,  and 
AUCss quartiles of osimertinib. A similar analysis for AZ5104 has been conducted for AZ5104, showing 
HRs range from 0.37 to 0.42 for the lower 3 AZ5104 AUCss quartiles and 0.64 for the highest AZ5104 
AUCss quartile.

A  Cox  regression  analysis  was  performed,  considering  these  covariates  one-by-one  and  the  most 
important  ones  in  combination  with  AUCss  of  both  osimertinib  and  AZ5104.  With  respect  to  the  pre-
defined level for detection of statistical significance in the analysis plan of p<0.001, only baseline sum 
of longest tumour diameter was retained in the covariate model. 
The  relationship  between  PFS  vs  osimertinib  Cssmax  or  Cssmin  as  a  predictor  variable  was  assessed 
and is shown in the below table.

Overall,  this  analysis  indicates  that  there  is  no  evidence  that  increasing  exposure  (AUCss)  of 
osimertinib and AZ5104 is associated with increased efficacy (PFS, BPCT, DoR and BRS).  
Safety analysis 
A  model  based  analysis  was  conducted  to  assess  the  potential  exposure  dependency  of  LVEF  events 
and  a  potential  influence  of  covariates.  This  analysis  did  not  support  an  AUC  dependency  of  LVEF 
events  on  the  pre-defined  significance  level  (p<0.001).  The  only  identified  statistically  significant 
covariate  was  baseline  LVEF.  The  models  using  log-transformed  osimertinib  or  AZ5104  AUCss  with 
baseline  LVEF  as  covariate  were  chosen  as  final  models.  These  models  indicated  an  exposure 
dependency of LVEF events even if not meeting the pre-defined level of significance.

Since  the  graphical  analysis  suggested  a  relationship  between  osimertinib  exposure  and  ILD  events, 
model  based  analysis  was  conducted.  This  analysis  showed  that  increasing  osimertinib  (or  AZ5104) 
exposure  increases  the  probability  to  develop  ILD-like  events.  However,  this  relationship  was  not 
statistically  significant  (according  to  the  pre-defined  criterion;  p<0.001).  None  of  the  additional 
covariates  (age,  weight,  BMI,  gender,  WHO  performance  status,  history  of  hypertension,  line  of 
therapy, nicotine use and statin use) showed any statistically significant effect on the occurrence of ILD 
events.  
The  final  models  included  AUCss  (for  osimertinib  or  AZ5104),  Japanese,  and  Asian  non-Japanese  as 
predictive  variables.  Visual  predictive  checks  suggested  that  both  final  models  (osimertinib  and 
AZ5104) are able to well describe the observed occurrence of ILD across various subpopulations.  
The parameter estimates for the final model of the relationship between osimertinib AUCss or Cssmax 
and ILD are shown in the table below.

Figure 14: Visual predictive checks for the frequency of ILD events in different populations – for the 
(osimertinib) final model accounting for ethnicity differences (left), and for the (osimertinib) base 
model not accounting for ethnicity differences (right) 
The  incidence  and  severity  of  rash  appears  to  increase  with  increasing  dose  (and  exposure)  of 
osimertinib.  
Similar  to  the  observation  for  rash,  the  incidence  and  severity  of  diarrhoea  appear  to  increase  with 
increasing  dose  (and  exposure)  of  osimertinib.  In  the  group  of  first-line  160  mg  osimertinib  treated 
patients  86.7%  of  the  patients  experienced  diarrhoea  as  compared  to  58.1%  in  the  first-line  80  mg 
osimertinib treated patients. 
The relationship between corrected QT interval (QTc) and plasma concentrations upon multiple dosing 
was  assessed  via  modelling  intensive  digital  electrocardiogram  and  PK  data  generated  in  AURA2  and 
was included in the previous submissions. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The population pharmacokinetic model describes the concentration-time course profiles of osimertinib 
and its metabolite (AZ5104) orally administered at 80 mg. The same structural pharmacokinetic model 
as  in  the  previous  clinical  trials  has  been  proposed  in  order  to  characterize  the  experimental 
observations  from  all  available  clinical  trial.  Linear  absorption,  distribution  and  elimination  processes 
were  assumed  in  a  one-compartment  model  for  the  parent  and  metabolite  analyte.  Inter-individual

variability was incorporated in all PK parameters (ka, V/F, CL/F, CLM/F and VM/F). Several covariates 
were  included  in  CL/F,  CLM/F,  V/F,  VM/F  with  the  aim  of  partially  explaining  the  inter-individual 
variability  on  osimertinib’s  PK.  Model  evaluation  was  performed  through  prediction-corrected  VPC, 
showing the population PK model developed is able to reproduce in general the observations after the 
administration  of  osimertinib  at  80  mg.  All  parameters  in  the  model  were  adequately  qualified  as 
indicated  by 
the  95% 
confidence 
interval 
from 
the  non-parametric  bootstrap.  All 
experimental/predicted  ratios  obtained  from  the  osimertinib  PK  parameters  (AUCss,  Cminss,  and 
Cmaxss) were within the ±20% range. 
Then, a dose-exposure response analysis on efficacy and several safety endpoints (LVEF and ILD) have 
been performed investigating the relationship between osimertinib exposure and PFS or the incidence 
of safety events for osimertinib treated patients. Once the results from the exposure-response analysis 
were  obtained,  AUCss  was  selected  as  the  most  relevant  PK  variable.  A  covariate  analysis  was 
performed  on  each  exposure-safety  model  in  order  to  better  explain  individual  differences  on  safety 
based on the studied population. 
Data management, model development, and model evaluation/qualification procedures seem adequate 
and acceptable. Condition number of 274.8 indicates no over-parametrization and model stability and 
the  shrinkage  values  (ETA-  and  EPS-shrinkage)  were  low,  except  for  ka  and  VM/F  (38.6  and  38.1%, 
respectively).  
Population PK model 
-Line  of  therapy  was  not  considered  as  a  covariate  on  absorption  rate  or  bioavailability.  During  the 
absorption  phase the  median  observation  in  1st  line  patients  is below  the 95%  confidence  interval  of 
the model-predicted median, indicating that the model slightly overpredicts the central tendency. Due 
to the sparse PK sampling in FLAURA, the absorption profile could not be fully characterized in 1st line 
patients.  The  observed  prediction  bias  is  acceptable  considering  the  low  regulatory  impact  of  the 
modelling results.  
Simulation of the impact of covariate differences on osimertinib exposure 
-  The  impact  of  the  identified  covariates  in  typical  patients  is  too  small  to  be  clinically  relevant.  This 
supports  that  the  initial  fixed  dose  approach  is  appropriate.  However,  due  to  large,  unexplained 
variability  in  osimertinib  PK,  a  considerable  proportion  of  patients  weighing  43  kg,  and  even  more  of 
the  “worst-case”  patient  group  (with  baseline  albumin  equal  to  29.3  g/L),  will  have  exposures  above 
the suggested target range (approximately Cmaxss and AUCss of 59% and 49%, respectively), defined 
by  the  applicant  as  exposure  between  the  mean  expected  exposure  at 40  and  160  mg. Patients  with 
low body weight (<50 kg) may be at increased risk of developing adverse events of Grade 3 or higher. 
Close monitoring is therefore recommended in these patients  
Special populations 
-Studies  investigating  severe  renal  impaired  population  and  P-gp  interaction  study  are  ongoing. 
Therefore,  no  specific  recommendations  can  be  made  on  these  special  populations  until  results  are 
available.  
-No specific dose recommendations can be derived on moderate and severe hepatic population based 
on  the  low  number  of  individuals  included  in  the  dataset  (moderate=8  individuals,  severe=0 
individuals). 
No  interaction  studies  have  been  submitted  which  is  acceptable  as  osimertinib  exposure  is  consistent 
between 1st and ≥2nd line of therapy. The results of the previous interaction studies are applicable for 
all lines of therapy.

EMA/396618/2018

Exposure-safety relationship 
-The  exposure-safety  model  that  accounts  for  the  relationship  between  AUC-LVEF  levels  is  able  to 
characterize the proportion of patients with LVEF events at 80mg, but no information is provided on 40 
and  160  mg.  Additionally,  the  95%  CI  of  the  intercept  includes  the  zero,  which  indicates  lack  of 
significance. Therefore, the model should not be used for simulation or extrapolation purposes. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The population PK model is in general adequate.  
Based  on  results  from  osimertinib  and  metabolite  (AZ5104)  exposure  (PK)  and  efficacy/safety 
relationship  from  studies  AURA1,  AURA2,  AURA3,  and  FLAURA,  the  recommended  dose  of  80  mg  is 
acceptable.  In  terms  of  efficacy,  no  exposure-efficacy  relationship  could  be  detected,  which  reduces 
the impact of model-based predictions in future assessments (dose selections, special populations). An 
evaluation  of  other  exposure  metrics  did  not  increase  the  prediction  of  the  model  in  regards  to  the 
efficacy endpoints selected.  
A model-based assessment was performed to detect any relationship between exposure and incidence 
of  LVEF  events,  but  failed  to  achieve  the  significance  criterion.  The  Applicant,  however,  applied  the 
model in order to simulate different dose regimens and scenarios since the significance of the AUCss as 
a predictor was borderline non-significant. This approach is fully endorsed as it provides more accurate 
conclusions and allows for a model-informed drug development process. The incidence of ILD, rash and 
diarrhoea  is  low  and,  in  general,  comparable  to  EGFR-TKI  SoC  treated  patients.  For  ILD  events, 
Japanese  and  Asian  non-Japanese  populations  were  included  as  significant  covariates  in  the  model, 
and differences between those sub-groups of populations might be explained due to constitutional and 
environmental  factors.  Additionally,  the  more  intensive  monitoring  for  ILD  and  ILD-like  incidences  in 
Japanese population could have also contributed to identify more incidences of ILD events. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dose response studies specifically in 1st line NSCLC patients were conducted. Using the same dose 
as the registered dose in ≥2nd line patients is reasonable.

A Phase III, Double-blind, Randomised Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of 
AZD9291 versus a Standard of Care Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Tyrosine 
Kinase Inhibitor as First-line Treatment in Patients with Epidermal Growth Factor 
Receptor Mutation-positive, Locally-advanced or Metastatic Non-small-cell Lung 
Cancer (FLAURA) 
Figure 15: Flow chart of study design. 
Efficacy  and  safety  data  from  FLAURA  presented  in  this  submission  are  from  the  556  patients 
randomised globally. As per protocol amendment 1, a China extension cohort of 136 patients was also 
enrolled  in  FLAURA  to  meet  China  regulatory  requirements:  this  cohort  included  19  patients 
randomised in the global study prior to the end of global recruitment as well as 117 additional patients 
to be recruited as part of the China extension cohort. Data for the 19 patients randomised in the global 
study prior to the end of global recruitment are included in the global analysis set. Data for the entire 
136-  patient  China  extension  cohort  will  be  analysed  separately  once  the  PFS  data  for  the  China 
extension  cohort  has  reached  similar  maturity  to  that  used  in  the  primary  analysis  of  PFS  based  on 
Investigator  assessment  in  the  globally-recruited  patients    and  will  be  submitted  to  the  Chinese 
regulatory authority only.

Treatments 
After randomization, the investigational products osimertinib 80 mg or the SoC EGFR-TKI (either 
gefitinib [250 mg] or erlotinib [150 mg]) were administered orally once daily. 
Patients were to continue their randomised treatment until disease progression (RECIST v1.1), or until 
a treatment discontinuation criterion was met. However, patients could continue to receive their 
randomised treatment beyond RECIST v1.1-defined progression if the Investigator judged the patient 
was continuing to show clinical benefit on treatment. As per protocol Amendment 1 (13-Apr-2015) 
after Investigator-assessed objective disease progression, patients randomised to the SoC arm had the

option to crossover to treatment with open-label osimertinib provided they met predefined criteria 
(confirmation of disease progression by BICR prior to unblinding; no subsequent intervention therapy 
following discontinuation of randomised treatment; and tissue or plasma confirmation that the tumour 
was T790M mutation-positive after disease progression). 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To assess the efficacy of single-agent osimertinib compared with SoC EGFR-TKI therapy as measured 
by PFS, by investigator.  
Key secondary objectives: 
To  assess  the  efficacy  of  osimertinib  compared  with  SoC  EGFR-TKI  therapy  by  assessment  of  PFS  in 
patients  with  EGFR  Ex19del  or  L858R  mutations,  and  with  EGFRm  (Ex19del  or  L858R)  detectable  in 
plasma-derived  ctDNA;  to  further  assess  the  efficacy  of  osimertinib  compared  with  SoC  EGFR-TKI 
therapy in terms of ORR, DoR, DCR, depth of response, and OS; to characterise the pharmacokinetics 
(PK)  of  osimertinib  and  its  metabolites;  and  to  assess  the  impact  of  osimertinib  compared  to  SoC  on 
patient-reported outcomes.  
To  compare  the  efficacy  of  osimertinib  with  SoC  EGFR-TKIs  based  on  presence  or  absence  of  CNS 
metastases at study entry (CNS MTS subgroup analysis) 
The safety objective was to assess the safety and tolerability profile of osimertinib compared with SoC 
EGFR-TKI therapy.  
Key exploratory objectives: 
To  further  assess  the  efficacy  of  osimertinib  compared  to  SoC  EGFR-TKI  on  post-progression 
outcomes; to assess the agreement between local and central EGFR tumour tissue testing results; and 
to  compare the  baseline  tumour  EGFR  mutation  status  in  all  screened  patients  with  evaluable  results 
from  baseline  plasma in  all  screened  patients.  Furthermore,  CNS  efficacy  analyses  were  pre-specified 
in the SAP finalised prior to database lock for the primary PFS analysis. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  PFS  based  on  Investigator  assessment  of  radiological  data  with  a 
sensitivity analysis based on BICR assessment using RECIST v1.1. 
The main secondary endpoints were: 
• 
overall survival compared to SoC EGFR-TKI therapy, 
•  ORR,  DoR,  DCR,  and  depth  of  response  compared  to  SoC  EGFR-TKI  therapy.  All  according  to 
RECIST v1.1 using Investigator assessments 
• 
To  compare  the  efficacy  of  osimertinib  with  SoC  EGFR-TKIs  based  on  presence  or  absence  of 
CNS  metastases  at  study  entry  (CNS  MTS  subgroup  analysis).  Systemic  PFS  by  Investigator 
assessment;  reason  for  systemic  progression  (TL,  NTL  [CNS  NTL  or  non-CNS  NTL],  NL  [new 
CNS lesion or no new CNS lesion]); reason for CNS progression, systemic ORR by Investigator 
assessment; and systemic DoR and onset of response by Investigator assessment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/396618/2018

• 
Patient reported outcomes, as measured via the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the complementary lung 
cancer questionnaire EORTC QLQ-LC13. 
The main exploratory endpoints were: 
• 
• 
efficacy of osimertinib compared to SoC EGFR-TKI post-progression as measured by PFS2 and 
time  to  subsequent  treatments,  including  time  from  randomisation  to  discontinuation  of  any 
EGFR-TKI or death. 
Tumour and ctDNA were gathered to explore biomarker effects on efficacy of both osimertinib 
and SoC, these data will be reported at a later time.   
Sample size 
Per protocol, approximately 530 patients (265 per treatment arm) were to be randomised globally. In 
order to randomise 530 patients, it is estimated that 980 EGFRm+ patients will need to be screened. 
The DCO1 for the primary analysis of PFS was pre-specified to occur after approximately 359 PFS 
events had occurred in the 530 patients randomised globally, representing approximately 65% 
maturity. 
If the true PFS HR for the comparison of osimertinib and SoC EGFR-TKI is 0.71, 359 PFS events would 
provide 90% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in PFS at a 5% two-sided 
significance level, translating into an approximate improvement in median PFS from 10 months to 14.1 
months assuming exponential data distribution and proportional hazards. The minimum critical HR is 
0.81 (e.g. 10 to 12 months). 
For the key secondary endpoint of PFS in patients with T790M+ NSCLC confirmed using a highly 
sensitive assay, there will be approximately 72% power to detect a PFS HR=0.55 (i.e. 10 to 18 
months), assuming a prevalence of 20%. 
For the OS analysis, there will be approximately 72% power to demonstrate a HR <0.75 (i.e. 25 to 
33.3 months) with two-sided 5% significance level. If the 4 month improvement as detailed for PFS is 
maintained for OS, then there will be approximately 27% power to demonstrate a HR of 0.86 (median 
OS of 25 months for SOC and 29 months for AZD9291) with two-sided 5% significance level.  
Following randomisation of 530 patients in the global portion of the study, additional mainland China 
patients (until approximately 120 in total) will be randomized to facilitate the China-only analysis 
dataset. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were centrally randomised in a 1:1 ratio, using the IVRS/IWRS, to receive either 
osimertinib 80 mg orally once daily or the EGFR-TKI chosen by the site based on site preference and 
marketing authorisation in the particular country (ie, gefitinib 250 mg orally once daily or erlotinib 150 
mg orally once daily). The actual EGFR-TKI had to be selected at a site/country level according to the 
country's marketing authorisation prior to the site initiation. 
Patients were stratified at randomisation based on EGFR mutation status (Ex19del or L858R) and 
ethnicity (Asian or Non-Asian).

Blinding (masking) 
This  was  a  double-dummy  study  wherein  each  patient  received  either  the  active  AZD9291  plus 
comparator-matching placebo (SoC) or the active comparator (SoC) plus AZD9291-matching placebo. 
The active and placebo tablets were identical and presented in the same packaging to ensure blinding 
of the medication. The treatment code could be broken if the appropriate management of the patient 
required knowledge of the treatment randomisation for medical emergencies or for treatment decisions 
(eg, cross-over). Study sites were required to select either gefitinib or erlotinib as the sole comparator 
prior to site initiation, except for the US where all sites used erlotinib (the most commonly used EGFR-
TKI for first-line EGFRm NSCLC in the US at the time of study start, in 2014).  
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  the  study  was  PFS  based  on  Investigator  assessment  according  to 
RECIST  v1.1,  with  a  sensitivity  analysis  based  on  blinded  independent  central  review  (BICR)  of  the 
imaging data.  
Statistical methods 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  PFS  based  on  Investigator  assessment  according  to  RECIST  v1.1. 
One analysis of the primary endpoint of PFS was planned. The DCO for the primary analysis of PFS was 
pre-specified to occur after approximately 359 PFS events had occurred in the planned 530 patients to 
be  randomised  globally,  representing  approximately  65%  maturity.  Progression-free  survival  was 
established  from  programmatically  calculated  response  based  on  the  Investigator  assessment  for 
patients  in  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  using  a  log-rank  test  stratified  by  mutation  type  (Ex19del  or 
L858R)  and  ethnicity  (Asian  vs.  Non-  Asian)  to  generate  p-value  and  using  the  Breslow  approach  for 
handling ties. The HR and its confidence interval (CI) were obtained directly from the U and V statistics 
from a stratified log-rank test.  
A sensitivity analysis of PFS based on assessment of response by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 was 
also  conducted.  Other  PFS  sensitivity  analyses  included  the  possibility  of  bias  in  assessment  and 
measurements  by  Investigators  (ascertainment  bias);  the  possible  bias  in  evaluation-time  if  scans 
were not performed at the protocol-scheduled time points (evaluation-time bias); attrition bias; and a 
post-hoc  analysis  to  assess  the  potential  impact  of  change  in  scanning  schedule  at  Month  18  falling 
close  to  the  median  PFS.  A  posthoc  sensitivity  analysis  was  added  to  assess  the  impact  of  change  in 
scanning  schedule  at  Month  18  falling  close  to  the  median  PFS.  Sensitivity  analyses  were  to  be 
performed as per the primary reporting of PFS.  
In  addition  to  the  primary  analysis  of  PFS,  subgroup  analyses  were  conducted  by  comparing  PFS 
between  treatment  arms  using  a  Cox-proportional  hazards  model  in  the  following  subgroups:  gender 
(male/female); ethnicity (Asian/Non-Asian); age at screening (<65 years/≥65 years); CNS metastases 
(CNS  MTS)  status  at  study  entry  (Yes/No);  smoking  history  (Yes/No);  baseline  WHO  performance 
status  (0  or  1);  pre-treatment  T790M  status  (positive/negative);  EGFR  mutation  (Ex19del/L858R); 
EGFR mutation-positive by ctDNA (Yes/No); and centrally-confirmed EGFR mutation-positive (Yes/No). 
The  analyses  of  the  secondary  endpoints  of  ORR,  DoR,  DCR,  and  depth  of  response  also  occurred  at 
the time of the primary PFS analysis.  
Two OS analyses are planned: an initial interim analysis at the time of the primary PFS analysis and a 
final  analysis  when  the  OS  data  are  approximately  60%  mature  (approximately  318  deaths).  In 
addition, an analysis of PROs was conducted. 
An analysis to establish any efficacy benefit of osimertinib on the CNS (CNS BICR) was also added to 
the  SAP  (Amendment  to  the  SAP  dated  16  December  2016)  and  occurred  at  the  time  of  the  primary 
analysis  of  PFS.  The  following  variables  were  evaluated  by  CNS  BICR  on  the  CNS  full  analysis  set 
Assessment report

(cFAS)  and  CNS  evaluable-for-response  (cEFR)  analysis  sets:  CNS  PFS  on  the  cFAS;  CNS  PFS  by 
number  of  CNS  lesions  at baseline  on  cFAS;  CNS  ORR  on  the  cFAS  and  cEFR;  CNS  DoR  and onset  of 
response  on  the  cFAS  and  cEFR;  CNS  DCR  on  the  cFAS  and  cEFR;  and  CNS  ORR  by  prior  brain 
radiotherapy on cFAS. 
A  hierarchical  procedure  was  used  to  adjust  for  multiplicity  in  testing  the  key  endpoints  of  PFS,  OS, 
and CNS PFS. To provide strong control of the Type I error rate (5% two-sided), the primary endpoint 
of  PFS,  and  the  endpoints  of  OS  and  CNS  PFS  were  tested  in  this  sequential  order.  If  any  previous 
analysis  in  the  sequence  was  not  statistically  significant,  the  alpha  was  not  to  be  transferred  to 
subsequent analyses. If the OS analysis was statistically significant at the time of the PFS analysis or 
the  final  OS  analysis,  then  the  significance  testing  of  CNS  PFS  was  to  be  performed  at  the  full  alpha 
(5% two-sided) significance level. 
If  the  OS  analysis  was  not  statistically  significant  at  the  time  of  the  PFS  analysis  or  the  final  OS 
analysis, then the significance testing of CNS PFS was not to be performed. Only 1 CNS BICR statistical 
analysis  was  to  be  performed:  either  at  the  time  of  the  primary  PFS  analysis  or  at  the  later  OS 
analysis. A 2-sided 5% alpha was used in all testing, except for the OS endpoint. Since 2 analyses of 
OS  are  planned,  the  Lan  DeMets  approach  that  approximates  the  O'Brien  and  Fleming  spending 
function was used to maintain an overall 2-sided 5% Type I error across the 2 planned OS analyses. 
Any  non-statistically  significant  OS  analysis  at  the  time  of  the  primary  PFS  analysis  did  not  preclude 
further testing of OS. 
The China extension cohort enrolled 136 patients: 19 patients from China who were randomised in the 
global  study  prior  to  the  end  of  global  recruitment  and  an  additional  117  patients  recruited  in  China 
specifically  for  the  China  extension  cohort.  Data  for  the  19  patients  randomised  in  the  global  study 
prior  to  the  end of  global recruitment  are  included in  the  global  analysis  set presented  in  this  report. 
Data  for  the  entire  136-patient  China  extension  cohort  (ie,  the  19  China  patients  in  the  global  study 
and the additional 117 China extension cohort patients) will be analysed separately and submitted to 
the  Chinese  regulatory  authority  only  once  the  PFS  data  for  the  entire  China  extension  cohort  has 
reached similar maturity to that used in the primary analysis of PFS based on Investigator assessment 
in  the  globally-recruited  patients  (ie,  approximately  65%).  Thus,  data  from  the  19  Chinese  patients 
randomised prior to the end of global enrolment will be part of both the main global analysis and the 
China extension cohort analysis.

Recruitment 
A  total  of  556  patients  were  randomised  to  treatment  at  132  study  centres  in  29  countries  (global 
recruitment). An additional 17 centres in China enrolled patients into the China extension cohort only. 
The first patient was randomised in the global study and dosed on 19 February 2015. The last patient's 
first dose was administered on 11 March 2016. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments: 
The study protocol was amended two times. In addition to minor clarifications, the main amendments 
are described below. 
Amendment  1  (13  Apr  2015)  was  introduced  due  to  advice  from  the  FDA,  regulatory  requirements 
from Chinese authorities and emerging data from use of osimertinib after treatment with other EGFR-
TKIs. The main changes were: 
•  Addition  of option  to  continue  recruitment in  mainland  China,  following  achievement  of global 
recruitment target of 650 
•  Allow post-progression cross-over for patients receiving SoC to open-label osimertinib provided 
specific criteria are satisfied. 
•  Removal of efficacy interim analysis

EMA/396618/2018 
Page 39/131 
 
  
 
 
Amendment  2  (24  Sep  2015)  was  introduced  due  to  data  from  the  phase  I  trial.  The  main  changes 
were: 
•  Sample size has been reduced from 650 to 530 patients 
• 
The number of patients in each treatment group has been updated based on the change in the 
sample size 
•  Disease  Control  Rate  (DCR)  has  been  added  to  the  list  of  RECIST-based  endpoints  for 
completeness. 
Protocol deviations 
The most frequent of the important protocol deviations in both treatment arms was the nonadherence 
to a protocol-required procedure, including, in decreasing order of frequency:  
•  Missing  RECIST  assessments  for  efficacy:  67  (12.1%)  patients  overall  (osimertinib:  41 
[14.7%];  SoC:  26  [9.4%]).  This  was  the  most  frequently  reported  protocol  deviation  in  both 
treatment arms. None of the missing scans  were baseline scans and the majority were single 
missing assessments. 
•  RECIST scan performed outside the visit window on more than 2 occasions: 27 (4.9%) patients 
overall (osimertinib: 18 [6.5%]; SoC: 9 [3.2%]) 
•  Baseline tumour RECIST assessments performed more than 28 days before randomisation: 15 
(2.7%) patients overall (osimertinib: 7 [2.5%]; SoC: 8 [2.9%]) 
• 
Tumour assessment methods and procedures not compliant with protocol or RECIST  v1.1: 14 
(2.5%) patients overall (osimertinib: 7 [2.5%]; SoC: 7 [2.5%]) 
•  Administration of prohibited other anti-cancer agents, investigational products or radiotherapy 
(for  reasons  other  than  bone  metastases)  while  the  patient  was  on  treatment:  2  (0.4%) 
patients overall, 1 patient in each arm 
The  second  most  frequent  important  protocol  deviation  category  included  patients  who  did  not  meet 
eligibility criteria, including:  
•  No confirmation that the tumour harboured an EGFR sensitising mutation (Ex19del or L858R): 
7 (1.3%) patients (osimertinib: 3 [1.1%]; SoC: 4 [1.4%]).  
o 
 The  investigators’  interpretation  of  inclusion  criterion  5  (Section  5.3.1)  led  them  to 
classify these 7 patients as not meeting the criterion. However, based on review of the 
local  and/or  central  test  results,  all  7  patients  did  have  tumours  harbouring  EGFR 
sensitising mutations. The nature of the deviation was that either the mutation analysis 
was  performed  on  a  biopsy  taken  from  an  early  disease  stage  sample  (5  patients)  or 
was performed in a local laboratory at a date preceding the laboratory accreditation (2 
patients) 
•  No  pathological  confirmation  that  the  patient  had  an  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung:  5  (0.9%) 
patients (osimertinib: 2 [0.7%]; SoC: 3 [1.1%]) 
• 
Patient was not treatment-naïve for locally-advanced or metastatic NSCLC: 3 (0.5%) patients 
overall (osimertinib: 2 [0.7%]; SoC: 1 [0.4%]) 
•  No lesions not previously irradiated or chosen for biopsy during the screening period that could 
be accurately measured at baseline as being 10 mm in longest diameter by CT or MRI (except 
lymph  nodes,  which  had  to  have  a  short  axis  of  15  mm)  and  were  suitable  for  accurate 
Assessment report

Page 40/131 
 
  
 
repeated measurements: 2 (0.4%) patients, both on osimertinib: 1 patient had no measurable 
lesion and 1 patient provided measurements, but from a previously irradiated lesion  
•  During data review, it was discovered that 1 patient in each treatment arm had a mean (from 
triplicate  measurements)  QTcF  value  above  470  msec  at  study  entry.  In  both  patients 
(E1403008 in the osimertinib arm and E3603004 in the SoC arm), a mean QTcF value of 483.3 
msec was recorded at screening.  
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics  
The  study  enrolled  the  population  intended  by  protocol.  Demographic  characteristics  were  generally 
well balanced between the treatment arms.

Baseline disease characteristics  
All  randomized  patients,  except  for  1  patient  in  the  osimertinib  arm  with  missing  data,  had  locally 
advanced  NSCLC  that  was  not  amenable  to  curative  surgery  or  radiotherapy  (29  [5.2%]  patients 
overall) or metastatic NSCLC (526 [94.6%] patients overall). 
Per  protocol,  all  patients  were  to  receive  study  treatment  as  first-line  therapy.  However,  3  (0.5%) 
patients  (osimertinib:  2  [0.7%];  SoC:  1  [0.4%]),  all  enrolled  at  the  same  US  study  site,  were  not 
treatment-naïve  for  locally-advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  at  study  entry,  an  important  protocol 
deviation. Baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced between the 2 treatment arms.

Determination of EGFR mutation status 
Of the 994 patients screened in the FLAURA study, 556 were randomised. Of those 556 patients, 267 
were  randomised  based on  local  testing  performed at  certified/accredited laboratories.  The  remaining 
289  patients  were  randomised  based  on  an  EGFRm  status  identified  via  the  cobas®  EGFR  Mutation 
Test performed at designated central laboratories (Figure 3). 
Figure 17: Summary of EGFR local and central testing results. 
Patients who were randomised based on a local EGFRm positive result were also required to provide a 
tissue specimen for central testing to compare the local testing results with the central cobas® EGFR 
Mutation  Test.  Investigators  were  not  required to  submit  samples  for  central testing  for  patients  who 
failed screening based on local EGFR test results. 
Of  the  267  patients  randomised  based  on  a  local  result,  226  (85%)  also  had  evaluable  tumour 
specimens  tested  by  the  central  cobas®  EGFR  Mutation  Test.  Of  these  226  patients,  217  yielded  a 
Assessment report

valid  central  cobas  test  result,  of  whom  211/217  (97%)  patients  were  retrospectively  confirmed  to 
have EGFRm tumours based on central testing (osimertinib: 110 [52%]; SoC: 101 [48%]). The central 
test  did  not  confirm  the  presence  of  an  EGFRm  mutation  in  6  patients  (osimertinib:  3;  SoC:  3).  A 
further 41 patients were not tested by the central cobas® EGFR Mutation Test; this included patients 
for whom no sample was supplied and patients for whom the supplied sample did not meet the testing 
requirements. 
The  PPA  between  the  cobas®  EGFR  Mutation  Test  and  the  local  tests  was  97.2%  for  the  2  EGFR 
sensitising  mutations  (Ex19del  and  L858R)  in  aggregate,  99.2%  for  Ex19del,  and  94.5%  for  L858R, 
excluding invalid test results and no or inadequate samples. The cobas® EGFR Mutation Test showed a 
high percent agreement with the local tests. 
Of  the  556  patients  randomised  into  the  FLAURA  study,  500  (89.9%)  were  confirmed  to  have  EGFR 
mutation-positive  tumours  according  to  the  cobas  EGFR  Mutation  Test  (performed  centrally).  An 
additional 41 (7.4%) patients had no or inadequate samples, 9 (1.6%) had invalid tests, and 6 (1.1%) 
had mutations not detected. 
Prior anti-cancer therapy 
Per  protocol,  all  randomised  patients  were  to  be  treatment-naïve  for  their  advanced  NSCLC.  Three 
patients  (2  in  the  osimertinib  arm,  1  in  the  SoC  arm)  had  received  prior  treatment  for  advanced 
cancer, an important protocol deviation. 
Patients could have received prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapy at an earlier stage of the disease: 
overall,  37/556  (6.7%)  patients  had  received  prior  adjuvant  or  neoadjuvant  cytotoxic  chemotherapy 
(osimertinib: 21 [7.5%]; SoC: 16 [5.8%]). 
Prior  radiotherapy  had  been  administered  to  104/556  (18.7%)  patients  overall  (osimertinib:  47 
[16.8%]; SoC: 57 [20.6%]). Fifteen (2.7%) patients overall had prior brain radiotherapy (osimertinib: 
8 [15.1%]; SoC: 7 [11.1%]). 
Use of concomitant medication 
The vast majority of patients (274 [98.2%] in the osimertinib arm and 272 [98.2%] in the SoC arm) 
received  concomitant  medications  during  the  study.  Concomitant  medications  were  generally 
representative of medications commonly administered to patients with advanced NSCLC, in alignment 
with  the  concomitant  medical  conditions,  were  well  balanced  between  treatment  arms,  and  were  not 
considered to affect the study results. 
Radiotherapy while on treatment was administered to 8 (2.9%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 10 
(3.6%) patients in the SoC arm.  
Two  (0.4%)  patients  (1  in  each  arm)  received  a  disallowed  concomitant  medication,  an  important 
protocol deviation.

All the results included in this table are based on investigator assessment unless otherwise stated. PFS, ORR and DoR results 
by investigator assessment were consistent with those reported via Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR); PFS by 
BICR assessment was 17.7 months [95% CI: 15.1, 21.4] on osimertinib and 9.7 months [95% CI: 8.5, 11.0] on SoC; ORR by

Table 20: Analysis of progression-free survival (full analysis set) 
A greater proportion of patients treated with osimertinib were alive and progression-free at 6 months 
(88.4%  [95%  CI:  83.9,  91.7]),  12  months  (68.2%  [95%  CI:  62.3,  73.5]),  and  18  months  (50.9% 
(95% CI: 44.5, 57.0]) compared to those treated with SoC (6 months: 75.2% [95% CI: 69.5, 79.9]; 
12 months: 42.3% [95% CI: 36.3, 48.2]; and 18 months: 24.4% [95% CI: 19.2, 30.0]). 
Figure 19: Kaplan-Meier plot of progression-free survival – investigator assessment (full analysis set). 
Most of the PFS events were due to progression by RECIST criteria; 11 (3.9%) patients on osimertinib 
and 14 (5.1%) patients on SoC died in the absence of RECIST progression.

There  was  no  evidence  of  evaluation-time  bias  affecting  PFS,  which  could occur  if  scans  were 
not performed at the protocol-scheduled time intervals. The HR of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.57; 
p-value <0.0001) was consistent with the primary analysis. 
The  results  of  the  attrition  bias  sensitivity  analysis  indicated  that  the  censoring  rules  applied 
did not introduce a bias in the outcome of the primary analysis of PFS. The HR was 0.47 (95%

•  An additional sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of the change in RECIST 
scanning schedule at Month 18 from every 6 weeks to every 12 months, which fell close to the 
median PFS of 18.9 months in the osimertinib arm. The impact of the change in visit schedule 
was  very  minor.  The  median  PFS  in  the  osimertinib arm  decreased  to  18.4  months  (95%  CI: 
15.2,  22.1)  from  18.9  months,  with  no  change  in  the  median  for  the  SoC  arm.  The  HR  and 
95%  CI  remained  unchanged.  The  median  total  number  of  RECIST  assessments  per  patient 
after Month 18 was 1.0 (range: 1-5). 
Secondary efficacy endpoint: Overall survival (interim analysis) 
The  first  of  2  analyses  of  OS  was  conducted  at  the  DCO1  for  the  primary  analysis  of  PFS.  A  survival 
status check was conducted on all randomised patients without a death reported 7 days after database 
DCO  date  (12  June  2017).  A  second  and  final  OS  analysis  will  be  conducted  when  data  are 
approximately 60% mature (~334 deaths). 
The  maturity  for  OS  was  25.4%  overall.  A  majority  of  patients  (osimertinib:  51/58  [87.9%];  SoC 
65/83 [78.3%]) died of the disease under study. 
Table 23: Overall survival analysis (full analysis set) 
The analysis was performed using a log rank test stratified by stratification factors. 
Compared to patients treated with SoC, a greater proportion of patients treated with osimertinib were 
alive at 12 months (osimertinib: 89.1% [95% CI: 84.7, 92.2]; SoC: 82.5% [95% CI: 77.4, 86.5]) and 
18 months (osimertinib: 82.8% [95% CI: 77.7, 86.8]; SoC: 70.9% [95% CI: 64.8, 76.1]). At the time 
of DCO1, every patient had the opportunity for a minimum of 15-month follow-up.

The  BICR  assessment  was  consistent  with  the  Investigator  assessment.  The  ORR  was  78.1%  in  the 
osimertinib  arm  and  70.4%  in  the  SoC  arm.  Based  on  assessment  by  BICR,  no  patients  had  CR  and 
218 (78.1%) had PR in the osimertinib arm vs. 3 (1.1%) patients with CR and 192 (69.3%) patients 
with  PR  in  the  SoC  arm.  The  ORR  (adjusted  for  ethnicity  and  mutation  type)  was  78.6%  in  the 
osimertinib arm vs. 70.8% in the SoC arm (OR: 1.52 [95% CI: 1.03, 2.24]; p-value = 0.0344). 
ORR based on Investigator assessment for patients with centrally-confirmed EGFRm 
The  ORR  results  based  on  Investigator  assessment  in  patients  with  centrally-confirmed  EGFRm  were 
consistent  with  those  in  the  study  FAS.  The  ORR  in  patients  with  centrally-confirmed  positive  EGFRm 
was 79.6% in the osimertinib arm and 77.1% in the SoC arm. The ORR (adjusted) was 80.5% in the 
osimertinib  arm  vs.  77.9%  in  the  SoC  arm  (OR  [adjusted]:  1.17  [95%  CI:  0.76,  1.81];  2-sided  p-
value: 0.4728). 
Secondary efficacy endpoint: Duration and onset of response based on Investigator 
assessment 
The median DoR based on Investigator assessment (calculated using KM technique) was 17.2 months 
(95% CI: 13.8, 22.0) in the osimertinib arm vs. 8.5 months (95% CI: 7.3, 9.8) in the SoC arm.  
A  greater  proportion  of  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  remained  in  response  at  12  months 
(osimertinib:  64.4%  [95%  CI:  57.5,  70.5];  SoC:  37.3%  [95%  CI:  30.6,  44.1])  and  18  months 
(osimertinib: 48.8% [95% CI: 41.1, 56.0]; SoC: 19.1% [95% CI: 13.3, 25.7]) compared to patients in 
the SoC arm. 
The  DoR  analysis  by  BICR  was  consistent  with  the  Investigator  DoR  analysis  and  in  line  with  the 
improvement in PFS.  
Figure 21: Kaplan-Meier plot of duration of response - investigator assessment (full analysis set) 
The median time to onset of response from randomisation was similarly rapid in both treatment arms 
and aligned with the first response assessment at Week 6 (osimertinib, 6.1 weeks [95% CI: 6.0, 6.1]; 
SoC, 6.1 weeks [95% CI: NC, NC]).

Secondary efficacy endpoint: DCR based on Investigator assessment 
The  DCR  (defined  as  complete  response  [CR]+  PR+stable  disease  [SD]  ≥6  weeks)  based  on 
Investigator assessment was similar and >90% in both arms.  
Secondary efficacy endpoint: Depth of response (tumour shrinkage) 
A similar proportion of patients had tumour shrinkage (reduction of the sum of tumour lesion size) in 
both treatment arms, based on Investigator assessment according to RECIST v1.1, with a similar mean 
shrinkage of TLs in both arms. The BICR analysis was consistent with the Investigator analysis.

Secondary endpoint of patient-reported outcomes 
Overall, compliance rates for EORTC QLQ-C30 were ≥70% up to Week 96 in the osimertinib arm and 
up to Week 60 in the SoC arm. Compliance rates for EORTC QLQ-LC13 were ≥70% up to Week 93 in 
the  osimertinib  arm  and  up  to  Week  75  in  the  SoC  arm  (with  an  exception  for  Week  66  when  the 
compliance rate was 69.2%).

Post progression outcomes 
Overall, the positive impact of first-line osimertinib therapy continued beyond first RECIST progression, 
as demonstrated by the analyses of post-progression outcomes.

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analysis of PFS 
The  superiority  of  osimertinib  over  SoC  was  maintained  and  consistent  across  the  randomisation 
stratification factors and all the predefined subgroups with available data for statistical analysis. All PFS 
HRs  were  <0.60  in  favour  of  osimertinib  for  all  but  the  subgroup  of  patients  without  a  valid  EGFRm 
central test result (HR of 0.85).

DCO1: 12 June 2017 
Subgroup analysis for EGFR mutation status 
At baseline, patients were enrolled and stratified by EGFR mutation type, as determined either by local 
testing or by central testing. Overall, 349 (62.8%) patients had tumours harbouring Ex19del mutation 
and 207 (37.2%) patients had tumours harbouring L858R mutation. 
Progression-free  survival,  as  assessed  by  the  Investigator,  was  prolonged  for  patients  who  received 
osimertinib compared to patients on SoC irrespective of the EGFR mutation type (Figure 10). Patients 
with NSCLC harbouring Ex19del in the EGFR gene had numerically longer median PFS in both arms, in 
line with previous observations (Sebastian et al 2014). However, patients with NSCLC  harbouring the 
less  EGFR-TKI  responsive  L858R  treated  with  osimertinib  have  better  outcomes  than  patients  with 
NSCLC harbouring the more responsive Ex19del when treated with SoC.

Subgroup of patients with locally advanced NSCLC 
In  29/556  (5%)  patients  with  locally  advanced  EGFRm  NSCLC  (osimertinib:  14  patients;  SoC:  15 
patients),  the  ORR,  as  assessed  by  the  Investigator,  was  92.9%  (95%  CI:  66.1,  99.8)  for  patients 
receiving osimertinib and 60.0% (95% CI: 32.3, 83.7) for patients receiving SoC. 
The duration of response in this population was not assessed. 
Patients with locally advanced disease 
Among  the  29  patients  with  locally  advanced  disease,  20  reported  a  PFS  event  by  investigator.  No 
formal analysis of PFS in this subgroup has been performed. The Applicant provided a summary table 
(data not shown) with the relevant PFS data. The results are in line with the overall population. 
Central nervous system efficacy analyses 
The  prespecified  CNS  analyses  conducted  on  the  CNS  MTS  and  CNS  BICR  (cFAS,  cEFR)  populations 
were all prospectively defined. 
Subgroup analysis by CNS metastases status at baseline (CNS MTS) 
At baseline, 116/556 (20.9%) patients were determined programmatically from eCRF pages to have a 
CNS  MTS  status  of  "Yes"  based  on  Investigator  assessment:  53/279  (19.0%)  patients  in  the 
osimertinib  arm  and  63/277  (22.7%)  patients  in the  SoC  arm.  Twenty  patients  were part only  of the 
subgroup with a CNS MTS status of “Yes” at baseline, but not of the cFAS subgroup, due to either the 
absence  of  a  CNS  CT  or  MRI  scan  for  CNS  BICR  assessment  or  BICR  not  identifying  CNS  lesions. 
Conversely, 32 patients were part only of the cFAS as they were not considered by the Investigator to 
have  baseline  CNS  metastases  and,  therefore,  were  not  included  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  a 
CNS MTS status of “Yes” at baseline.

DCO1: 12 June 2017 
Figure 26: Kaplan-Meier plot of subgroup analysis of PFS: CNS MTS status at baseline (full analysis set) 
Irrespective  of  the  CNS  MTS  status  at  baseline,  based  on  Investigator  assessment,  there  were  fewer 
patients with new CNS lesions in the osimertinib arm than in the SoC arm. 
An  analysis  of  efficacy  by  CNS  MTS  status  at  baseline  based  on  study  CNS  BICR  was  consistent  with 
the analysis by the Investigator: the HR for PFS in patients with a CNS MTS status of "Yes" based on 
BICR  was  0.48  (95%  CI:  0.30,  0.75;  p  =  0.001) in  favour  of  osimertinib.  The  HR  for  PFS  in  patients 
with a CNS MTS status of “No” based on BICR was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.61; p<0.0001). 
The median DoR and proportion of patients remaining in response at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 
and 12 months favoured osimertinib, irrespective of CNS MTS status at entry. The interpretation of an 
OR of 0.5 in favour of SoC for patients with a CNS MTS status of “Yes” should therefore take all data 
into  account.  Hence,  taking  all  efficacy  assessments  together,  this  subgroup  analysis  demonstrates 
that  irrespective  of  CNS  MTS  status  at  entry,  patients  receive  greater  benefit  from  osimertinib 
treatment that from treatment with SoC. 
Efficacy on CNS metastases based on CNS BICR 
The  2  analysis  sets  evaluated  by  CNS  BICR  were  the  cFAS  (patients  with  measurable  and  non-
measurable CNS metastases at baseline); and the cEFR (patients with measurable CNS metastases at 
baseline).

Supportive study(ies) 
Proof-of-concept of the efficacy of osimertinib in the first-line setting came from a cohort of 30 patients 
with EGFRm NSCLC treated with osimertinib 80 mg in the Phase I component of Study D5160C00001 
(AURA  Phase  I  component).  At  the  time  the  FLAURA  study  was  designed,  results  from  the  first  DCO 
date (2 December 2014) were available. Further confirmation of an efficacy signal was observed with 
longer follow-up in these patients in first-line, showing, at the third DCO (1 November 2016), a median 
PFS of 22.1 months (95% CI: 13.7, 30.2); an ORR of 66.7% (95% CI: 47.2, 82.7); a reduction in size 
of target lesions (TLs) in 97% of patients; and a median DoR at 75% maturity of 19.3 months (95% 
CI:  12.3,  24.7).  As  this  was  a  Phase  I  study  without  a  protocol-mandated  scheduled  collection  of  OS 
throughout  the  study,  full  survival  follow-up  may  have  been  incomplete;  thus,  OS  analysis  was  not 
conducted. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
FLAURA is a Phase III, double-blind, randomised study (1:1 ratio) specifically designed to compare the 
efficacy  of  osimertinib  vs.  SoC  (either  gefinitib  or  erlotinib)  as  first-line  treatment  in  patients  with 
locally-advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC. 
Patient population 
Patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  (Pathologically-confirmed  adenocarcinoma)  not 
amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy with a documented (centrally or locally) EGFR mutation 
known to be associated with EGFR-TKI sensitivity (Ex19del, L858R), were recruited.  Patients had to be 
treatment naïve for advanced cancer although adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapy at an earlier stage of 
the NSCLC was permitted.  
While it is acknowledged that 85 % - 90 % of the patients with activating mutations harbour Ex19del 
or  L858R  mutations,  no  patients  with  less  common  mutations  were  included  in  FLAURA  trial.  All 
patients  were  to  have  adequate  cardiac,  hepatic  and  renal  function,  WHO-PS  of  0  or  1  with  no 
deterioration  over  the  previous  2  weeks  and  a  minimum  life  expectancy  of  12  weeks.  Patients  were 
required  to  have  at  least  1  measurable  lesion  at  baseline  according  to  the  investigator.  Patients  with 
CNS metastases were eligible if they were asymptomatic, stable and not requiring steroids for at least 
2  weeks  prior  to  start  of  study  treatment,  this  is  relevant  as  osimertinib  is  claimed  to  have  superior 
blood  barrier  penetration  than  other  licensed  TKIs  which  are  considered  to  have  limited  efficacy  on 
CNS metastases. 
The exclusion of patients with poor general condition (WHO PS 2 or higher), and short life expectancy 
is a limitation in the study design. 
Assessment report  
EMA/396618/2018 
Page 69/131 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Treatments 
Osimertinib was administered at the same dose as that currently authorised one for patients with the 
T790M mutation, 80 mg once a day. 
Erlotinib  and  gefitinib  are  considered  suitable  comparators  as  both  together  with  afatinib  are  the 
standard of care for first-line EGFRm NSCLC. The absence of afatinib is justified based on the fact that 
it was not widely available at the time of FLAURA trial start. Study centres had to declare their choice 
of comparator prior to site initiation. In some regions there was only one drug of choice such as in the 
US  (where  erlotinib  was  the  only  licensed  drug  at  the  time  of  start  of  the  trial)  or  Japan  (where 
gefitinib was the only investigator´s choice). Both erlotinib and gefitinib, were administered according 
to SmPC recommended doses and schedules. 
Patients progressing in the SoC arm as determined by the investigator, with confirmation by BICR, who 
had  not  received  any  subsequent  therapy  after  discontinuation  of  study  therapy  and  who  had 
confirmation of T790M mutation, were given the opportunity to be treated with osimertinib 80 mg once 
daily. This is in line with the currently authorised indication of osimertinib and cross-over is considered 
ethical, although it will affect OS data.  
Endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  FLAURA  was  PFS  based  on  investigator  assessment  according  to 
RECIST v1.1. For this first-line setting PFS is an acceptable primary endpoint. OS, ORR, DoR, QoL and 
post progression outcomes (PFS2) were included as secondary endpoints. 
OS data as well as PFS2 data are considered of great value in order to assess how osimertinib acts on 
the development of secondary resistances and whether the early introduction of osimertinib could have 
some impact on subsequent lines of therapy.. 
An analysis in a predefined subgroup of patients presenting CNS metastases at baseline was planned. 
CNS BIRC assessment of PFS and ORR was also performed. 
Randomisation and SAP 
Suitable patients were centrally randomised to receive either osimertinib 80 mg or SoC in a 1:1 ratio. 
Patients were stratified at randomisation based on EGFR mutation status (Ex19del or L858R) ethnicity 
(Asian/Non-Asian). 
The DCO for the main PFS analysis (after approximately 359 PFS events) was performed at the DCO of 
12-Jun-2017. The first IA on OS was performed at that time. The final analysis for OS has not yet been 
conducted. 
Results 
The overall patient population seems reasonably representative for the intended patient population.  
As of DCO1 for the primary PFS analysis, 141 (50.5%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 64 (23.1%) 
patients in the SoC arm patients were ongoing on their randomised treatment. 
Two amendments to protocol were carried out, mainly related to the inclusion of the China cohort (as 
recommended  by  Chinese  regulatory  authority),  and  to  allow  post  progression  cross-over  to 
osimertinib for patients in the SoC arm and statistical issues. The MAH is recommended to submit data 
from the Chinese cohort when available.  
The number of protocol deviations is overall high (23.3% osimertinib vs 18.1% SoC) however none is 
considered to have meaningful impact on study results.  
•  Baseline characteristics 
Patient demographic seem to be well-balanced between arms. The median age was 63 years (range 26 
to  93  years),  with  79  patients  (14.2%)  aged  ≥75  years.  There  was  a  greater  proportion  of  female 
Assessment report

patients  (62.9%)  and  the  population  was  predominantly  Asian  (62.4%)  and  white  (36.2%).  The 
proportion  of  Asian  population  is  consistent  with  previous  trials  with  osimertinib  (in  AURA  3  trial 
(second  line  of  T790M+  NSCLC)  65.4%  of  patients  were  Asian).  Pivotal  trials  with  first  and  second-
generation  TKIs,  on  the  contrary,  were  either  conducted  in  Asian  population  (IPASS  trial)  or  in 
Caucasic  patients  (EURTAC  trial).  Two-thirds  of  patients  had  never  smoked  (64.2%)  and  a  low 
percentage of patients (3.1%) were current smokers. This is consistent with the known prevalence of 
sensitising EGFR mutations. 
Most patients had a WHO performance status of 1 (58.8%). As per inclusion criteria all patients should 
have  had  histological  type  of  adenocarcinoma  (or  mixed  histology  with  predominance  of 
adenocarcinoma).  Based  on  confirmation  by  both  central  and  local  test,  the  most  common  EGFR 
sensitising mutations were exon 19 deletion (62.7% in osimertinib arm vs. 62.8 in SoC) and exon 21 
L858R (37.3% osimertinib vs. 37.2% SoC).  
Of the 556 patients randomised in the trial 267 (48%) were randomised based on local testing of EGFR 
mutations  and  289  (52%)  based  on  status  identified  by  central  laboratories  (cobas®  EGFR  Mutation 
Test).  All  patients  centrally  analysed  were  positive  for  EGFR  mutations.  From the  267  patients  locally 
analysed,  samples  from  226  patients  were  also  sent  for  central  confirmation  of  mutations  (84.6%).  
Mutations were centrally confirmed in 211 patients (211/267; 80%) whereas absence of mutation was 
centrally  confirmed  for  6  patients  and  the  sample  was  invalid  for  testing  in  9  patients.  Concordance 
between central and local test sites was high.  
EGFR mutations by cobas central test classified 56.6% of patients in the osimertinib arm vs. 56.0% in 
the SoC as having exon 19 deletion, 34.8% and 32.5% respectively as exon 21 L858R, 1.1% in each 
study  arm  (3  patients  each)  as  EGFRm  not  detected  and  1.4%  and  1.8%  of  patients  respectively  as 
invalid test. 
Most  patients  had  metastatic  disease  (94.6%)  while  only  5.2%  (n=29)  had  locally  advanced  (stage 
IIIb)  NSCLC  not  suitable  for  definitive  multimodality  therapy.  The  proportion  is  in  line  with  what  was 
seen in other recent trials in lung cancer.  
Sites of metastases were comparable between study arms.  
Central  nervous  system  (CNS)  metastases  as  collected  by  investigators  in  the  sCRF  pages  were 
present in 19% of patients in osimertinib arm (n=53) and 22.7% of patients (n=63) in the SoC arms, 
however  these  were  required  to  be  asymptomatic,  stable  and  not  requiring  steroids  for  at  least  2 
weeks prior to the start of study treatment.  
Overall the main demographic and disease characteristics can be considered representative of targeted 
population. 
8.6%  of  patients  (n=24)  from  the  osimertinib  arm  and  14.1%  from  SoC  received  second  post-
treatment anticancer therapy.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in terms of the primary endpoint, PFS per 
investigator assessment (HR: 0.46 [95% CI: 37, 0.57]; p-value: <0.0001), was shown by osimertinib 
compared  to  the  SoC  arm.  Data  can  be  considered  mature  enough  with  48.7%  of  events  in  the 
osimertinib  arm  and  74.4%  in  SoC  arm.  Treatment  with  osimertinib  resulted  in  a  8.7-month 
improvement  in  median  PFS  compared  to  SoC  (18.9  months  [95%  CI:  15.2,  21.4]  vs.  10.2  months 
[95% CI: 9.6, 11.1]). PFS rates consistently favoured osimertinib treatment arm at 6 months (88.4% 
vs.  75.2%),  12  months  (68.2%  vs.  42.3%)  and  18  months  (50.9%  vs.  24.4%).  K-M  curves  show  a

clear and early separation almost from the beginning of the trial. 
PFS results according to BICR on the FAS are consistent with main analysis, HR: 0.45 (95% CI: 0.36, 
0.57;  p-value  <0.0001).  Median  estimates  were  close  to  those  estimated  by  investigator  but  slightly 
lower in both arms, 17.7 months (95% CI: 15.1, 21.4) in the osimertinib arm vs. 9.7 months (95% CI: 
8.5,  11.0)  in  the  SoC  arm.  Exploratory  analyses  carried  out  in  order  to  estimate  the  discrepancy 
degree between BICR and investigator (early discrepancy rate (EDR) and late discrepancy rate (LDR)) 
did not raise concerns. 
Although an analysis in the subgroup of patients presenting at baseline with T790M+ was initially pre-
planned,  it  was  finally  not  performed  given  the  low number  of  patients  (4  patients  in  the  osimertinib 
arm and 1 patient in the SoC arm).  This is compliant with the amended study protocol and SAP. 
Different  sensitivity  analyses  were  carried  out in  order  to  assess  robustness of  results.  They  included 
assessment  of  ascertainment  bias,  evaluation-time  bias,  attrition  bias  as  well  as  assessment  of  the 
impact  of  the  change  in  RECIST  scanning  schedule  at  Month  18  from  every  6  weeks  to  every  12 
months,  which  fell  close  to  the  median  PFS  of  18.9  months  in  the  osimertinib  arm.  All  sensitivity 
analyses  supported  the  main  one  with  HR  between  0.45-0.47  and  upper  bounds  of  the  95%  CI  no 
greater than 0.58. 
A  sensitivity  analysis  comparing  the  differences  in  PFS  data  between  osimertinib  and  gefitinib  vs. 
osimertinib  and  erlotinib  was  not  planned  or  performed.  The  study  was  not  designed  or  powered  to 
allow a meaningful interpretation of this analysis: randomization into the two study arms was stratified 
by ethnicity and EGFR mutations, both factors known to impact outcome, however patients randomized 
into  the  comparator  arms  were  not  stratified  to  also  generate  an  equal  distribution  of  these  factors 
over the two SoC choices. Taking into account that  a separate analysis for gefitinib and erlotinib was 
likely  to  be  heavily  confounded  by  the  unequal  distribution  of  ethnicity  and  that  other  previously 
conducted  head-to-head  studies  of  erlotinib  versus  gefitinib  showed  no  statistically  significant 
difference  for  efficacy,  this  issue  was  not  further  pursued.    Furthermore,  no  unexpected  change  in 
WHO performance status was observed in either arm of the study. 
Subgroup  analyses  for  PFS  showed  consistent  results  in  all  subgroups  analysed.  Previous  experience 
with  first  and  second-generation  TKIS  suggested  better  efficacy  in  patients  with  Exon19  mutation 
compared to those with L858R mutations. A similar trend has been observed in the FLAURA trial and 
the benefit over the SoC is clear for both subgroups. Regarding the analysis of subgroups according to 
EFGR  mutation  by  ctDNA  was  also  consistent  with  main  findings  although  CI  in  some  subgroups  are 
widened likely because of the limited sample size (HR of 0.44 (95% CI: 0.34-0.57) for EGFR m+; HR 
of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.28-0.80) EGFR m-; HR of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.21-0.78) EGFR missing). The HR in the 
subgroup of patients with centrally confirmed mutation was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.34-0.54). 
There were 14% of patients aged ≥75 years. The treatment effect in patients older than 75 years old 
is not considered critically dissimilar to that of the overall population. Results in terms of PFS for this 
subgroup  are  borderline  statistically  significant  (upper  limit  95%CI:  1.02)  which  could  be  due  to  the 
limited sample size. 
Osimertinib performed better in the non-Asian population compared to the Asian population with a PFS 
of  24.3  months  (95%CI:  16.4,  NC)  vs.  16.6  months  (95%CI:  13.8,  20.7),  respectively.  The  existing 
PFS data demonstrated a statistically and clinically relevant benefit over SoC in both Asians and non-
Asians. 
PFS in patients with locally advanced disease seemed to be in line with the overall population, although 
the data set is too small to conclude.  
PFS  results  in  the  comparator  arm  observed  in  the  FLAURA  trial  (10.2  months)  can  be  considered  in

line with data from previous trials of TKI inhibitors, including those of afatinib, where medians ranging 
from 8.2 to 13.7 months at best were observed. The most recent phase III trial (ARCHER 1050; Wu et 
al  2017)  compared  a  new  TKI  inhibitor  with  gefitinib  and  a  median  PFS  of  11.0  months  was 
documented  for  the  latter.  PFS  results  for  osimertinib  (median  18.9  months)  compare  favourably  to 
the  best outcomes documented in the literature for TKI alternatives (13.7 months).  
The  first  OS  interim  analysis  was  submitted  showing  a  HR  of  0.63  (CI  95%  0.45,  0.88)  that  did  not 
reach  the  pre-specified  threshold  for  statistical  significance.  Superior  rates  at  different  time  points 
consistently favoured osimertinib arm (OS rates at 12 months: 89.1% vs. 82.5%; 18 months: 82.8% 
vs. 70.9%). 
Results  from  the  final  analysis  would  further  support  the  efficacy  including  subgroup  analyses  of  OS. 
The MAH is recommended to submit the final OS analysis expected to be available by Q4 2019.  
OS data will be submitted together with updates of other relevant endpoints such as TFST and TSST. 
Although it is acknowledged that the cross-over of patients will unavoidably confound study results. 
Regarding  secondary  endpoints,  the  superiority  in  terms  of  PFS  is  however  not  supported  by  a 
statistically  significant  difference  in  terms  of  response  rates.  The  ORR  (not  confirmed)  was  79.9% 
(95%  CI:  74.7,  84.5)  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  75.8%  (95%  CI:  70.3,  80.7)  in  the  SoC  arm.  The 
confirmed responses were consistent with the unconfirmed ORR data. Acknowledging the limitations of 
cross-study comparisons, the ORR results observed in this study are in line with the ORRs observed in 
randomized controlled studies with currently approved EGFR-TKIs (58%-83%, reviewed in Sebastian et 
al 2014). A longer duration of response has been observed with osimertinib compared to SoC (median 
17.2  months  vs.  8.5  months).  The  BICR  assessment  of  ORR  was  consistent  with  the  Investigator 
assessment as it was the analysis of ORR according to centrally confirmed EGFRm. 
CNS analyses (by BICR and Investigator) 
Efficacy analyses were conducted in the subset of patients with CNS metastases at baseline.  
Of  556  patients  randomized,  200  had  available  baseline  brain  scans.  CNS  efficacy  by  RECIST  v1.1  in 
FLAURA  demonstrated  a  nominal  statistically  significant  improvement  in  CNS  PFS  HR:  0.48  (95%  CI: 
0.26,  0.86).  An  ORR  of  65.6%  (95%  CI:  52.3,  77.3)  was  documented  in  the  osimertinib  arm  vs. 
43.3%  (95%  CI:  31.2,  56.0)  in  the  SoC  arm  in  the  subset  of  patients  with  brain  metastasis.  These 
findings confirm preclinical investigation suggesting that osimertinib has higher BBB than other TKIs. 
Patients reported outcome data 
The  overall  compliance  in  terms  of  PRO  data  over  the  first  9  months  was  similar  between  treatment 
arms, and ≥60%.  
The  presented  PRO  data  collected  up  to  nine  months  showed  no  significant  differences  between 
treatment arms. A clinically relevant improvement from baseline in cough in both treatment arms was 
shown, and a clinically relevant worsening in diarrhoea in both treatments was also observed and could 
be expected considering the mechanism of action and safety profile of the studied medicinal products. 
Post-progression outcomes (exploratory endpoints) 
At  DCO1,  73  (26.2%)  patients  from  osimertinib  and  106  (38.3%)  patients  from  SoC  had  second 
progression  events  after  the  start  of  subsequent  therapy  or  died.  The  majority  of  patients  in  the 
osimertinib arm received platinum-based therapy after progression on trial treatment and the majority 
of  patients  in  SoC  arm  received  EGFR-TKI  therapy  (including  48  patients  that  were  eligible  to  cross-
over to osimertinib). Median PFS2 is longer in the osimertinib arm however data are still immature with 
low percentage of events.  
Assessment report  
EMA/396618/2018 
Page 73/131 
 
  
 
TFST  and  TSST  favoured  osimertinib  arm.  Median  TSST  was  not  reached  in  both  arms  (0.60  (0.45, 
0.80);  P=0.0005)  as  data  are  still  immature  (limited  number  of  patients  with  second  subsequent 
therapy). 
The potential mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib have not been investigated in the FLAURA trial. 
Blood  samples  for  ctDNA  testing  and  optional  tumour  samples  were  collected  from  patients  in  both 
treatment  arms  at  time of  progression  to  explore the  potential  mechanisms  of  resistance,  results  are 
anticipated to be available by the 3/4Q 2018 and the MAH is recommended to submit them.  
Although  more  mature  OS  data  is  still  awaited,  preliminary  data  together  with  post-progression 
measures (PFS2, TFST) are in favour of osimertinib treatment. This reflects that osimertinib does not 
negatively impact next-line therapies. Twenty nine (29) patients received an EFGR-TKI as subsequent 
therapy  to  osimertinib.  Median  PFS  for  this  subset  of  patients  was  lower  than  for  the  overall 
population.  No  reliable  conclusion  can  be  made  on  the  possible  impact  of  osimertinib  treatment  on 
next-line TKI therapies or development of cross-resistances due to the limited sample size. 
A broadening of the indication to mutations other than Ex19del or L858R has been considered.  
Available evidence, including early preclinical data with mutant cell lines shows activity of osimertinib, 
against  the  rare  EGFR  mutations  G719S,  L861Q,  and  the  exon  19  insertion  mutations  (Cross  et  al 
2014).  Publications  have  also  reported  activity  in  exon  20  mutations  (Lee  et  al  2017;  Kohsaka  et  al 
2017; Ward et al 2016). Clinical data with osimertinib in other mutations are limited, although ongoing 
clinical  trials  could  provide  additional  information  in  the  future.  It  is  not  expected  that  osimertinib 
would  have  a  lower  efficacy  in  other  mutations.  Alternatives  authorised  in  the  treatment  of  EGFR 
activating mutations do not have a restricted use based on specific EGFR mutations despite very little 
or no clinical data in rare mutations.  
Based on the above, the CHMP considered that the use of Tagrisso should not be restricted to Ex19del 
or L858R mutations. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Osimertinib  prolong  PFS  in  a  clinically  relevant  manner  when  compared  to  SoC  (gain  8.7  months), 
which  could  likely  translate  into  longer  OS  for  patients  (as  pointed  out  by  preliminary  data).  PFS 
results are well-above findings of first and second-generation TKIs, and although rather similar results 
in terms of ORR are observed, the duration of responses was significantly longer for osimertinib.  This 
could  potentially  be  due  to  a  delay  in  TKI  resistance  development,  however  no  data  confirming  this 
hypothesis has been submitted and the potential mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib remain to be 
investigated.  
Although more mature OS data are will be available post authorisation (final OS results expected to be 
provided by Q4 2019), preliminary data together with post-progression measures (PFS2, TFST) are in 
favour  of  osimertinib  treatment.  On  the  basis  of  the  available  data,  it  is  considered  that  osimertinib 
does not negatively impact next-line therapies. 
The  benefit  of  osimertinib  as  first-line  for  the  overall  population  of  EGFR  mutated  patients  therapy 
overcomes  the  potential  uncertainties  about  treatment  sequencing  as  it  is  currently  not  possible  to 
predict  in  advance  which  patients  will  develop  T790M  resistance  prior  to  receiving  any  EGFR-TKI 
therapy.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety review is based primarily on the results of the Phase III study FLAURA (D5160C00007). 
FLAURA safety data are based on the DCO date for the primary efficacy analysis of PFS: 12 June 2017. 
Moreover, updated data, with an additional follow-up of 90 days have been provided (90 DSU DCO – 
25 September 2017).  
Safety  findings  in  FLAURA  (first-line  therapy)  were  supported  by  a  pooled  dataset  (N  =  1142)  that 
includes  data  from  Phase  I-III  studies  in  patients  treated  with  80  mg  osimertinib  as  first-line  (309 
patients)  or  ≥  second-line  therapy  (833  patients)  for  EGFR  mutation-positive  NSCLC:  FLAURA  (N  = 
279), AURA3 (N = 279), AURA2 (N = 210), AURA extension (N = 201), and AURA Phase 1 (N =173). 
The  pooled  population  did  not  include  patients  who  crossed  over  to  osimertinib  after  disease 
progression on their initial treatment.

Patient exposure 
Study FLAURA 
All patients randomised to osimertinib or SoC received at least 1 dose of study medication. At the time 
of  the  12  June  2017  DCO1,  141/279  (50.5%)  patients  were  still on  treatment  in  the osimertinib  arm 
and 64/277 (23.1%) were still on treatment in the SoC arm. In comparison, at the time of the 90 DSU 
DCO, 25 September 2017, 127 (45.5%) patients were still on treatment in the osimertinib arm and 50 
(18.1%) were still on treatment in the SoC arm. 
Exposure to osimertinib and SoC is summarized in the table below.  
Table 34: Duration of exposure in FLAURA (Safety analysis set) 
Pooled dataset 
In  the  pooled  population,  the  median  duration  of  osimertinib  therapy  was  12.9  months  (mean,  13.9 
months;  range,  <0.1  –  40.1  months).  Actual  exposure  was  similar  to  intended  exposure  (median: 
12.7;  range:  0.0-17.6  months),  indicating  that  the  frequency  and  median  duration  interruptions  had 
low impact on exposure.

1%  of  patients:  pneumonia  (32  [2.8%]),  pulmonary  embolism  (32  [2.8%]),  anaemia  (24  [2.1%]), 
neutrophil count decreased (23 [2.0%]), neutropenia (20 [1.8%]), alanine aminotransferase increased 
(17  [1.5%]),  decreased  appetite  (16  [1.4%]),  dyspnoea  (15  [1.3%]),  hyponatraemia  (15  [1.3%]), 
diarrhoea (14 [1.2%]), electrocardiogram QT prolonged (13 [1.1%]), asthenia (12 [1.1%]), aspartate

Interstitial lung disease 
Study FLAURA 
ILD  (grouped  term)  was  reported  in  a  low  but  numerically  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the 
osimertinib  arm  than  the  SoC  arm:  12/279  (4.3%)  patients  vs.  6/277  (2.2%)  patients.  The  overall 
event  rate  per  100  patient-years  was  similar  between  the  2  treatment  arms:  3.14  in  the  osimertinib 
arm and 2.21 in the SoC arm.  
In all 11 patients with ILD in the osimertinib arm, the outcome was reported as either resolved (7/11 
[63.6%]) or resolving (4/11 [36.4%]) at the time of DCO1. ILD grouped terms were reported as SAEs 
in 6 (2.2%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 4 (1.4%) patients in the SoC arm. 
The  median  time  to  onset  of  ILD  grouped-term  events  (first  occurrence  per  patient)  was  106.0  days 
(range:  9-425)  in  the  11  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  83.5  days  (range:  11-253)  in  the  6 
patients in the SoC arm. 
Table 43: ILD grouped term adverse events in FLAURA, by preferred term and maximum CTCAE grade 
(Safety analysis set) 
Pooled dataset 
The ILD events reported in FLAURA were generally similar to those in the pooled population in terms of 
incidence  (11  [3.9%]  and  45  [3.9%],  respectively)  and  severity,  with  most  events  being  of  CTCAE 
grade 1 or grade 2 in each arm. There were 4 patients with CTCAE grade 5 AEs in AURA2/AURA1C and 
1  patient  with  grade  5  ILD  in  AURA3.  The  incidence  of  ILD  reported  in  Japanese  patients  in  FLAURA 
(12.3%) was similar to that seen in previous studies (10.4%), with events remained primarily CTCAE 
grade 1 or grade 2 with evidence of reversibility.

Dose interruptions for AEs of ECG QT prolonged were reported in 8 (2.9%) patients in the osimertinib 
arm  and  6  (2.2%)  patients  in  the  SoC  arm.  Dose  reductions  for  AEs  of  ECG  QT  prolonged  were 
reported in 5 (1.8%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 1 (0.4%) patient in the SoC arm.

CTCAE grade in FLAURA at Safety analysis set) 
A total of 257 (92.1%) patients in the osimertinib arm vs. 253 (91.3%) patients in the SoC arm had 
both a baseline and a post-baseline assessment. The median maximum change from baseline in LVEF 
was −3.0% in both treatment arms: in the osimertinib arm at Week 48 and Week 72 (range: −3% to -
1%) and in the SoC arm at Week 96 (range: -3% to 0%).

Among  all  patients  who  had  baseline  and  post-baseline  LVEF  assessment  (regardless  of  whether  the 
assessments were within the ±7-day visit window), 8/257 (3.1%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 
3/253 (1.2%) patients in the SoC arm had a LVEF decrease from baseline of ≥10 pp, to an LVEF value 
of  <50%.  An  LVEF  decrease  of  ≥15  pp  to  an  absolute  value  of  ≥50%  was  seen  in  26/257  (10.1%) 
patients in the osimertinib arm vs. 18/253 (7.1%) patients in the SoC arm. 
Patients treated in FLAURA who experienced asymptomatic decreases in LVEF while taking osimertinib 
recovered  from  these  decreases  whilst  on  full  dose  of  osimertinib,  without  occurrence  of  cardiac 
symptoms. 
The  median  time  to  onset  for  AEs  in  the  Cardiac  effects  (cardiac  failure)  category  was  166.0  days 
(range: 18-504) in the osimertinib arm and 109.5 days (range: 84-750) in the SoC arm. 
Cardiac effects outside the cardiac failure and cardiomyopathy SMQs 
Adverse  events  in  the  Cardiac  Disorders  MedDRA  SOC  were  reported  for  24  (8.6%)  patients  in  the 
osimertinib  arm  and  19  (6.9%)  patients  in  the  SoC  arm  at  DCO1.  Most  of  the  AEs  in  the  Cardiac 
Disorders  SOC  at  the  90  DSU  DCO  were  either  CTCAE  grade  1  (14/26  [53.8%]  osimertinib;  15/21 
[71.4%]  SoC)  or  CTCAE  grade  2  (7/26  [26.9%] osimertinib  and  2/21  [9.5%]  SoC).  CTCAE  ≥grade  3 
cardiac  AEs  were  reported  in  4  (1.4%)  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  4  (0.4%)  patients  in  the 
SoC arm. In the osimertinib arm, 2 patients had CTCAE grade 3 AEs (acute myocardial infarction, atrial 
fibrillation); 1 patient had a CTCAE grade 4 AE (cardiac arrest) and 1 patient had a CTCAE grade 5 AE 
(myocardial  infarction).  In  the  SoC  arm,  4  patients  had  CTCAE  grade  3  AEs  (angina  pectoris,  left 
bundle branch block, pericardial effusion, and ventricular extrasystoles). 
Pooled dataset 
There was a similar incidence of AEs of ECG QT prolongation in FLAURA than in the pooled population 
(28/279  [10.0%]  vs.  70/142  [6.1%],  respectively)  and  LVEF  decreases  (10/279  [3.6%]  vs.  22/1142 
[1.9%]).  In  both  populations,  the  events  were  primarily  CTCAE  grade  1  or  grade  2.  One  (<0.1%) 
patient had CTCAE grade 5 cardiac failure reported in AURA2/AURA1C. Similar proportions of patients 
had a QTcF value ≥500 msec (10 (0.9%) pooled population and 3 (1.1%) FLAURA), QTcF increase > 
60 msec (41 [3.6%] pooled population and 14 [5%] FLAURA) or an LVEF value with a ≥10 pp change 
from  baseline  and  an  absolute  value  <50%  (35  (3.9%)  pooled  population  vs.  8  (3.1%)  FLAURA). 
Therefore, the differences between the 2 populations are not considered to constitute a change in this 
safety topic when FLAURA results are included in the pooled population. 
Diarrhoea 
Study FLAURA 
Diarrhoea  was  the  most  commonly  reported  AESI  in  FLAURA.  The  incidence  of  diarrhoea  was  similar 
between the 2 treatment arms: 161 (57.7%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 161 (58.1%) patients 
in the SoC arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/396618/2018 
Page 89/131 
 
  
 
Table 47: Diarrhoea adverse events by treatment arm and CTCAE grade (safety analysis set) 
Diarrhoea led to dose interruption in 7 (2.5%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 4 (1.4%) patients in 
the SoC arm. No AEs of diarrhoea led to dose reduction or treatment discontinuation in the osimertinib 
arm. In the SoC arm, 1 (0.4%) patient had a dose reduction due to an AE of diarrhoea, and 5 (1.8%) 
patients discontinued SoC dosing due to diarrhoea 
The  median  time  to  onset  of  first  event  of  diarrhoea  was  similar  between  the  2  treatment  arms:  17 
days (range: 1 to 536) in the osimertinib arm vs. 19 days (range: 1 to 631 days) in the SoC arm. 
Events of diarrhoea were of same duration between the 2 treatment arms (median of 44.0 days). 
On an episode level, 233 events of diarrhoea were reported among the 161 patients who experienced 
diarrhoea  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  236  events  were  reported  among  the  159  patients  who 
experienced  diarrhoea  in  the  SoC  arm  at  DCO1.  After  3  months,  the  diarrhoea  event  rate  in  both 
treatment arms remained relatively constant (<5%). The overall event rate per 100 patient years was 
lower in the osimertinib arm compared to the SoC arm: 46.0 and 58.5, respectively. 
The majority of episodes of diarrhoea resolved without treatment.  
Pooled dataset 
Incidence  was  higher  in  FLAURA  (161  [57.7%])  than  in  the  pooled population  (555  [48.6%]).  Nearly 
all events in the 2 populations were either CTCAE grade 1 or grade 2: 155/161 (96.3%) patients with 
diarrhoea  in  FLAURA  and  541/555  (97.5%)  patients  with  the  event  in  the  pooled  population.  CTCAE 
grade 3-4 was reported in 6 patients (2.2%) in the osimertinib arm in FLAURA and 14 patients (1.2%) 
in the pooled population.  
Diarrhoea  led  to  dose  reductions  in  no  patients  in  FLAURA  and  0.2%  of  patients  in  the  pooled 
population; to dose interruption in 2.5% and 1.4% of patients, respectively; and to discontinuation in 
no patients and 0.1% of patients, respectively. No events of haemorrhagic diarrhoea or GI perforation 
were reported in the osimertinib arm. 
Skin effects 
Study FLAURA 
The AESI of Skin effects was evaluated by review of 4 subgroups: Rashes & acnes, Pruritus, Dry skin, 
and Exfoliative rash. 
No  severe  bullous,  severe  blistering  or  severe  exfoliative  skin  events,  or  severe  hypersensitivity 
reactions,  including  Stevens-Johnson  Syndrome,  were  reported  in  either  treatment  arm.  One  CTCAE 
grade 4 SAE of toxic epidermal necrolysis was reported in the SoC arm.

Table 48: Skin effects grouped term adverse events in FLAURA, by subgrouped term and maximum 
CTCAE grade (safety analysis set) 
Rashes and acnes 
The  most  commonly  reported  PTs  were  dermatitis  acneiform  and  rash  maculo-papular.  The  median 
time to onset of first event in the Rashes and acnes subgroup was 18.0 days (range: 1 to 709 days) in 
the osimertinib arm vs. 14.5 days (range: 1-379 days) in the SoC arm. 
A  majority  of  the  episodes  of  rash  required  medication  (59.6%  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  79.5%  in 
the SoC arm). None of the untreated AEs of rash resulted in dose modification. In the osimertinib arm 
173 (67.8%) of the AEs of rash resolved and 82 (32.2%) were ongoing at DCO1. 
Dry skin 
The  only  PT  in  this  subgroup  reported  by  at  least  10%  of  patients  was  dry  skin  (osimertinib:  88 
[31.5%] patients; SoC: 90 [32.5%] patients.  
The median time to onset of first event in the Dry skin subgroup was 33.5 days (range: 1 to 667 days) 
in the osimertinib arm vs. 26.0 days (range: 1 to 492 days) in the SoC arm. 
Pruritus 
The  median  time  to  onset  of  first  event  of  Pruritus  (grouped  term)  AEs  was  lower  in  the  osimertinib 
arm than the SoC arm: 16.5 days (range: 1 to 616 days) vs. 48 days (range: 5 to 676 days). 
One  (0.4%)  patient  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  no  patient  in  the  SoC  arm  had  an  AE  in  the  Pruritus 
subgrouped term reported as an SAE. Events led to discontinuation of treatment in 1 (0.4%) patient in 
the osimertinib arm and no patients in the SoC arm. 
Pooled dataset 
The incidence of AEs in the Skin Effects (grouped term) was higher in the osimertinib arm of FLAURA 
(207  [74.2%])  than  in  the  pooled  population  (746  [65.3%]).  The  incidence  of  Rashes  &  acnes  was 
higher in the osimertinib arm in FLAURA (57.7%) than in the pooled population (46.8%) whereas the 
incidence  of  Dry  skin  was  similar  between  the  osimertinib  arm  in  FLAURA  (35.8%)  and  the  pooled 
population (32.6%). The other two subgroups were similar among both arms. 
In the majority of patients Skin Effects AEs were CTCAE grade 1: 168 (60.2%) patients in FLAURA and 
605 (53.0%) in the pooled population and grade 2: 35 patients (12.5%) in FLAURA and 130 (11.4%) 
in the pooled population. CTCAE grade 3 were reported in 4 patients (1.4%) in the osimertinib arm in 
FLAURA  and  11  patients  (1.0%)  in  the  pooled  population.  The  CTCAE  grade  3  events  in  the  pooled 
population consisted on erythema (3 patients [0.3%]), rash maculo-papular (3 patients [0.3%]), rash 
erythematous (2 patients [0.2%]), rash macular (2 patients [0.1%]) and dry skin (1 [0.4%]).

Upper gastrointestinal tract inflammatory events 
Study FLAURA 
The Upper GI Tract Inflammatory Events grouped term included 3 subgroup terms: Oral inflammation, 
Non-oral upper GI tract inflammatory events, and GI tract inflammation of unspecified location.  
The  median  time  to  onset  of  first  event  of  Upper  GI  Tract  Inflammatory  Events  (grouped  term)  was 
similar  in  the  osimertinib  arm  (26.0  days  [range:  2  to  603])  and  the  SoC  arm  (20.0  days  [range:  1 
to540 days]). 
The CTCAE grade 4 AE of stomatitis in the osimertinib arm was classified as an SAE; it was considered 
to  be  unrelated  to  osimertinib  by  the  Investigator.  None  of  the  other  AEs  in  the  Upper  Gi  tract 
inflammatory events category were SAEs. In the SoC arm, 2 AEs of mouth ulceration were classified as 
SAEs. 
Table 49: Upper GI tract inflammatory events grouped term adverse events in FLAURA, by subgroup and 
maximum CTCAE grade (Safety analysis set) 
The  median  time  to  onset  of  first  event  of  Oral  inflammation  events  (grouped  term)  was  similar 
between  the  2  treatment  arms:  22.0  days  (range:  2  to  595  days)  and  16.0  days  (range:  1  to  383 
days). 
One patient in the osimertinib arm discontinued treatment due to oral pain; no patient in the SoC arm 
discontinued due to an AE in this grouped term.

The median time to onset of first event of Non-oral upper GI inflammatory events (grouped term) was 
higher in the osimertinib arm (133 days [range: 6 to 603]) than in the SoC arm (66.0 days [range: 1 
to 540 days]). 
Pooled dataset 
AEs  in  the  grouped  term  of  Upper  GI  inflammatory  events  were  reported  in  115  patients  (41.2%)  in 
the  osimertinib  arm  in  FLAURA  and  381  patients  (33.4%)  in  the  pooled  population.  The  incidence  of 
oral  inflammation  was  higher  in  the  osimertinib  arm  in  FLAURA  than  in  the  pooled  population  (94 
[33.7%] vs. 277 [24.3%]). In both populations, the incidence of Oral inflammation events was driven 
primarily by the PT of stomatitis, which was reported in 80 (28.7%) of patients in the osimertinib arm 
in FLAURA and 229 (20.1%) of patients in the overall pooled population. However, incidence of CTCAE 
≥ 3 was similar in both treatment arms (0.2% pooled population vs. 0,7% FLAURA). 
AEs  reported  within  the  other  subgroups  were:  Non-oral  upper  GI  tract  inflammatory  events  (12.5% 
FLAURA  vs.  14.0%  pooled  population)  and  GI  Tract  Inflammation  Of  Unspecified  Location  (0.4%  vs. 
1.1%). 
Nail effects 
Study FLAURA 
Adverse  events  in  the  Nail  effects  grouped  term  were  reported  in  100  (35.8%)  patients  in  the 
osimertinib  arm  and  93  (33.6%)  patients  in  the  SoC  arm,  with  a  lower  event  rate  per  100  patient-
years in the osimertinib arm than in the SoC arm: 27.7 and 33.5, respectively. 
The  vast  majority  of  Nail  effects  AEs  were  either  CTCAE  grade  1  (osimertinib:  52  [18.6%]  patients; 
SoC:  55  [19.9%]  patients)  or  CTCAE  grade  2  (osimertinib:  44  [15.8%];  SoC:  34  [12.3%]).  CTCAE 
grade  3  events  in  the  Nail  effects  grouped  term  were  reported  in  only  1  (0.4%)  patient  in  the 
osimertinib arm and 2 (0.7%) patients in the SoC arm. There was no AE greater than CTCAE grade 3 
in  severity  in  either  treatment  arm.  No  event  was  reported  as  an  SAE  in  either  treatment  arm.  One 
(0.4%) patient in the osimertinib arm discontinued treatment due to an AE of paronychia; no patient in 
the SoC arm discontinued due to an AE in this grouped term. 
The  median  time  to  onset  of  first  event  of  Nail  effects  (grouped  term)  was  similar  in  the  osimertinib 
arm (104.0 days [range: 7 to 632]) and the SoC arm (120.0 days [range: 10 to 588 days]). 
Pooled dataset 
The  incidence  of  Nail  effects  was  similar  between  the  osimertinib  arm  in  FLAURA  (34.8%)  and  the 
pooled population (31.3%), with the majority of events being CTCAE grade 1 or grade 2 in each arm. 
Ocular effects 
Study FLAURA 
The  Ocular  effects  grouped  term  was  evaluated  by  review  of  4  narrow  SMQs  (Conjunctival  disorders, 
Corneal  disorders,  Lacrimal  disorders,  and  Periorbital  &  eyelid  disorders)  and  the  grouped  terms  of 
Keratitis and Miscellanous ocular terms.  
Adverse  events  in the  Ocular  effects grouped  term were  reported in  fewer  patients  in  the  osimertinib 
arm  than  the  SoC  arm:  48/279  (17.2%)  patients  and  64/277  (23.1%)  patients,  respectively.  The 
event rate per 100 patient-years was lower in the osimertinib arm than in the SoC arm: 13.7 and 23.2 
respectively. 
There was 1/279 (0.4%) patient in the osimertinib arm that reported grade 1 AE of keratitis grouped 
term  (corneal  erosion  PT)  and  4/277  (1.4%)  patients  in  the  SoC  arm  reported  one  grade  1  (corneal 
erosion PT) and three grade 2 AEs of keratitis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/396618/2018

The  severity  of  the  events  was  similar  to  those  of  the  SoC  arm.  In  most  patients,  the  events  were 
either  CTCAE  grade  1  (14.7%  osimertinib  vs.  17.3%  SoC)  or  CTCAE  grade  2  (2.5%  osimertinib  vs. 
5.1%  SoC).  CTCAE  grade  3  events  in  the  Ocular  effects  grouped  term  were  similar  between  the  2 
treatment  arms:  0  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  1/277  (0.4%)  patient  in  the  SoC  arm.  No 
CTCAE grade 4 or grade 5 events were reported in either treatment arm. 
The  median  time  to  onset  of  first  event  of  Ocular  effects  AEs  (grouped  term)  was  lower  in  the 
osimertinib  arm  (48.0  days  [range:  1  to  681])  than  in  the  SoC  arm  (103.0  days  [range:  7  to  585 
days]). 
No patient in either treatment had an AE in this grouped term that was reported as an SAE or led to 
discontinuation of treatment. 
Within  the  MedDRA  SOC  of  Eye  Disorders,  at  DCO1  AEs  were  reported  in  a  similar  proportion  of 
patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  (45  [16.1%])  than  in  the  SoC  arm  (55  [19.9%]),  with  the  most 
common  PT  being  dry  eye  (21  [7.5%]  osimertinib  vs.  18  [6.5%]  SoC)  and  conjunctivitis  (14  [5.0%] 
osimertinib  vs.  20  [7.2%]  SoC).  Except  for  2  (0.7%)  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  with  a  CTCAE 
grade  3  cataract  and  1  (0.4%)  patients  each  in  the  SoC  arm  with  CTCAE  grade  3  blepharitis  and 
vitreous  detachment,  no  events  of  CTCAE  ≥grade  3,  no  SAEs,  and  no  treatment  discontinuations  or 
dose  reductions  due  to  AEs  in  the  Eye  Disorders  SOC  were  reported  in  either  treatment  arm.  Dose 
interruptions  due  to  Eye  disorders  AEs  were  reported  in  1  (0.4%)  patient  with  cataract  in  the 
osimertinib arm and 2 (0.7%) patients (1 with blepharitis and 1 with vitreous detachment) in the SoC 
arm. 
Pooled dataset 
The  incidence  of  Ocular  effects  grouped  term  was  48  (17.2%)  in  the  osimertinib  arm  in  FLAURA  and 
201 (17.6%) in the pooled population. The majority of events were CTCAE grade 1 (14.7% FLAURA vs. 
14.0% pooled population) or grade 2 (2.5% FLAURA vs. 3.5% pooled population). One patient (0.1%) 
in  the  pooled  population  had  a  CTCAE  grade  3  adverse  event  (2  patients  in  osimertinib  arm  in 
FLAURA). 
Hepatobiliary 
Study FLAURA 
Overall, hepatic-related AEs (in the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC or Investigations SOC) were reported 
in  a  lower  proportion  of  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  than  the  SoC  arm:  41  (14.7%)  vs  101 
(36.5%).

Additional  AEs  related  to  hepatic  function  from  the  Investigations  SOC  were  also  reported  in  a  lower 
proportion  of  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  than  the  SoC  arm:  35  (12.5%)  vs  86  (31.0%), 
respectively.  The  majority  of  the  events  were  either  CTCAE  grade  1  or  grade  2,  with  CTCAE  grade  4 
events reported in no patients in the osimertinib arm and in 4 (1.4%) patients in the SoC arm (all in 
the PT of ALT increased).  
Dose  reductions  due  to  hepatic-related  AEs  in  this  SOC  were  reported  in  1  (0.4%)  patient  in  the 
osimertinib arm (GGT increased) and 2 (0.7%) patients in the SoC arm (1 ALT increased and 1 AST 
increased). Dose interruptions for hepatic AEs in the Investigations SOC were reported as follows: ALT 
increased  (osimertinib:  3  [1.1%]  patients;  SoC:  18  [6.5%]  patients);  AST  increased  (osimertinib:  3 
[1.1%];  SoC:  12  [4.3%]);  and  blood  bilirubin  increased  (osimertinib:  1  [0.4%];  SoC:  0).  In  the 
osimertinib arm, no patients discontinued treatment due to hepatic AEs in this SOC. In contrast, in the 
SoC  arm,  8  (2.9%)  patients  discontinued  due  to  AEs  of  both  ALT  increased  and  AST  increased,  4 
(1.4%)  patients  due to  an  AE  of  ALT  increased,  and  1  (0.4%)  patient  due to an  AE  of  blood bilirubin 
increased. 
In  the  osimertinib  arm,  2  (0.7%)  patients  had  hepatic  AEs  that  were  classified  as  SAEs:  1  (0.4%) 
patient  had  SAEs  of  both  ALT  increased  and  AST  increased,  and  1  (0.4%)  patient  had  an  SAE  of 
transaminase increased. In the SoC arm, 5 (1.8%) patients had hepatic events that were classified as 
SAEs: 1 (0.4%) patient had SAEs of both AST increased and ALT increased, 1 (0.4%) had an SAE of 
ALT increased, and 3 (1.1%) patients had SAEs of drug induced liver injury. 
Pooled dataset 
The incidence of hepatic related AEs events in the osimertinib arm in FLAURA (14.3%) was similar to 
the  pooled  population  (13.9%);  with  the  majority  of  events  being  CTCAE  grade  1  or  grade  2  in  each 
arm. Proportion of CTCAE grade 3 adverse events were similar between both arms (2.2% FLAURA vs. 
2.7%  pooled  population).  In  the  pooled  population,  2  patients  (0.2%)  had  a  CTCAE  grade  4  and  2 
patients  (0.2%)  had  CTCAE  grade  5.  No  patient  reported  CTCAE  grade  4  in  the  osimertinib  arm  in 
FLAURA.

Renal effects 
Study FLAURA 
A  total  of  21  (7.5%)  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  33  (11.9%)  patients  in  the  SoC  arm  had  a 
history of Renal and urinary disorders at baseline. No patient in either treatment arm had a history of 
renal metastases. 
Renal-related  AEs  were  reported  in  42/279  (15.1%)  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  27/277 
(9.7%)  patients  in  the  SoC  arm,  with  a  similar  event  rate  per  100  patient  years:  10.3  and  9.9, 
respectively. 
In  both  treatment  arms,  the  vast  majority  of  Renal  AEs  were  either  CTCAE  grade  1  (osimertinib:  27 
[9.7%] patients; SoC: 20 [7.2%] patients) or CTCAE grade 2 (osimertinib: 12 [4.3%] patients; SoC: 6 
[2.2%] patients). Two patients (0.7%) in the osimertinib arm (acute kidney injury and proteinuria) and 
one patient in the SoC arm (proteinuria) had a CTCAE grade 3 Renal AE. One patient in the osimertinib 
arm experienced a CTCAE grade 5 of renal failure. 
Two  (0.7%)  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  1  (0.4%)  patient  in  the  SoC  arm  had  Renal  AEs 
classified  as  SAEs,  which  included  acute  kidney  injury  and  renal  failure  in  1  patient  each  in  the 
osimertinib arm, and ureterolithiasis in 1 patient in the SoC arm. 
Renal  AEs  did  not  lead  to  dose  reductions  in  either  arm.  The  following  Renal  AEs  led  to  dosing 
interruptions: acute kidney injury and creatinine renal clearance decreased (1 [0.4%] patient each) in 
the  osimertinib  arm;  and  blood  creatinine  increased  (1  [0.4%]  patient)  in  the  SoC  arm.  One  AE  of 
proteinuria in the SoC arm led to treatment discontinuation; no Renal AE led to discontinuation in the 
osimertinib arm. 
Patients with grade shifts in creatinine were identified by applying the CTCAE version 4.03 definition of 
creatinine  increases.  At  DCO1,  grade  shifts  in  creatinine  (increased)  from  baseline  were  seen  in  the 
majority of patients during treatment: 263 (96.7%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 256 (95.2%) 
patients in  the  SoC  arm.  A  total of  214  (78.7%)  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  238  (88.5%)  in 
the  SoC  arm  had  a  1-grade  shift;  48  (17.6%)  and  16  (59%),  respectively,  had  a  2-grade  shift;  1 
(0.4%) patient and 2 (0.7%), respectively, had a 3-grade shift. 
Pooled dataset 
Renal effects were reported in 36 patients (12.9%) in the osimertinib arm in FLAURA and 166 patients 
(14.5%)  in  the  pooled  population:  with  most  of  the  events  being  CTCAE  grade  1  (8.2%  FLAURA  vs. 
9.5% pooled population) or grade 2 (4.3% FLAURA vs. 4.2% pooled population). Incidence of CTCAE 
grade 3 in the pooled population was 7 (0.6%). 
Other AESI 
Asthenic conditions 
Study FLAURA 
AEs in the Asthenic conditions grouped term (DCO1) were reported in a slightly greater proportion of 
patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  (69  [24.7%])  than  in  the  SoC  arm  (50  [18.1%]).  The  event  rate  per 
100 patient-years was similar between the 2 treatments: 19.7 and 18.4, respectively. 
In  the  osimertinib  arm,  AEs  were  generally  mild,  with  no  CTCAE  grade  4  or  grade  5  events.  The 
frequency and severity of events were similar to those in the SoC arm. 
Two  (0.7%)  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  3  (1.1%)  in  the  SoC  arm  had  AEs  in  the  Asthenic 
conditions  grouped  term  reported  as  SAEs.  Events  led  to  discontinuation  of  treatment  in  2  (0.7%) 
patients in the osimertinib arm (PT of asthenia) and 1 (0.4%) patient in the SoC arm (PT of fatigue).

Anorexia 
Study FLAURA 
Adverse events in the Anorexia grouped term (DCO1) were reported in a similar proportion of patients 
in the 2 treatment arms: 56 (20.1%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 52 (18.8%) patients in the 
SoC  arm.  The  event  rate  per  100  patient-years  was  lower  in  the  osimertinib  arm  than  the  SoC  arm: 
16.0 and 19.1, respectively. 
In the osimertinib arm, AEs in the Anorexia grouped term were generally mild, with no CTCAE grade 4 
or grade 5 events. The frequency and severity of events were similar to those in the SoC arm. 
Two (0.7%) patients in each treatment arm had AEs in the Anorexia grouped term reported as an SAE, 
neither of which led to treatment discontinuation. 
Nausea 
Study FLAURA 
Nausea  was  a  single-PT  AESI  in  this  evaluation  and  was  reported  in  39  (14.0%)  patients  in  the 
osimertinib  arm  and  52  (18.8%)  patients  in  the  SoC  arm,  with  a  lower  event  rate  per  100  patient-
years in the osimertinib arm than in the SoC arm: 11.2 and 19.1, respectively. In the osimertinib arm, 
reports of nausea  were generally mild (all CTCAE grade 1 or grade 2). The frequency and severity of 
events were similar to those in the SoC arm. None of the events was classified as an SAE. 
Nausea led to dosing interruption in 2 (0.7%) patients on osimertinib vs. 1 (0.4%) patient on SoC. No 
patient  had  a  dosing  reduction  due  to  an  AE  of  nausea  in  either  arm.  Nausea  led  to  treatment 
discontinuation in 1 (0.4%) patient in each treatment arm. 
Vomiting 
Study FLAURA 
Vomiting  was  a  single-PT  AESI  in  this  evaluation  and  was  reported  in  31  (11.1%)  patients  in  the 
osimertinib  arm  and  29  (10.5%)  patients  in  the  SoC  arm  (DCO1),  with  a  similar  event  rate  per  100 
patient-years:  8.9  and  10.7,  respectively.  In  the  osimertinib  arm,  reports  of  vomiting  were  generally 
mild (all CTCAE grade 1 or grade 2). The frequency and severity of the events were similar to those in 
the SoC arm. 
One  (0.4%)  patient  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  5  (1.8%)  patients  in  the  SoC  arm  had  vomiting  AEs 
reported as an SAE. 
Vomiting led to dosing interruption in 1 (0.4%) patient in the osimertinib arm and 3 (1.1%) patients in 
the SoC arm, and to treatment discontinuation in 1 (0.4%) and 2 (0.7%) patients, respectively. 
Pancreatitis 
Study FLAURA 
No event of Pancreatitis (HLT of Acute and chronic pancreatitis) was reported in either treatment arm. 
Dry mouth 
Study FLAURA 
Dry  mouth  was  a  single-PT  AESI  in  this  evaluation  and  was  reported  in  a  similar  proportion  of  the  2 
treatment  arms:  12  (4.3%)  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  14  (5.1%)  patients  in  the  SoC  arm, 
with a similar event rate per 100 patient-years: 3.4 and 5.2, respectively (DCO1). 
In  the  osimertinib  arm,  reports  of  dry  mouth  were  mild  (all  CTCAE  grade  1).  The  frequency  and 
severity of the events were similar to those in the SoC arm. 
No patients in either treatment arm had an AE of dry mouth reported as an SAE. and no events led to 
dose interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of treatment in either arm.

Abdominal pain 
Study FLAURA 
AEs in the GI and abdominal pains HLT were reported in a similar proportion of the 2 treatment arms: 
23 (8.2%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 23 (8.3%) patients in the SoC arm (DCO1). The event 
rate per 100 patient-years was also similar: 6.6 and 8.5, respectively. In the osimertinib arm, reports 
of this HLT were generally mild, with no CTCAE grade 4 or grade 5 events, and led to dose interruption 
in  1  patient,  no  dose  reductions,  and  no  discontinuation  of  treatment.  The  frequency  and  severity  of 
events were similar to those in the SoC arm. 
One (0.4%) patient in the osimertinib arm had an event of abdominal pain reported as an SAE that led 
to  dose  interruption  but  not  discontinuation  of  treatment.  No  patient  in  the  SoC  arm  had  an  event 
reported as an SAE. 
Pyrexia 
Study FLAURA 
Pyrexia  was  a  single-PT  AESI  in  this  evaluation  and  was  reported  in  28  (10.0%)  patients  in  the 
osimertinib arm and 11 (4.0%) patients in the SoC arm (DCO1). 
In the osimertinib arm, reports of pyrexia were generally mild (all CTCAE grade 1 or grade 2), and led 
to dose interruption in 1 patient, no dose reductions or discontinuation of treatment.  
One (0.4%) patient in the osimertinib arm and no patients in the SoC arm had a dose interruption due 
to pyrexia. Two (0.7%) patients in each treatment arm had an AE of pyrexia reported as an SAE; no 
events led to discontinuation of treatment in either arm. 
Infections and infestations 
Study FLAURA 
The Infections and Infestations SOC is a large AESI grouping that includes over 100 PTs that cover a 
wide range of common conditions. 
Within this SOC, AEs reported in the osimertinib arm and in the SoC arm were: 185 (66.3%) and 168 
(60.6%)  patients,  respectively  (DCO1).  The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  (≥5%  of  patients)  were 
paronychia  (osimertinib:  81  [29%]  patients;  SoC:  80  [28.9%]  patients);  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection (osimertinib: 28 [10.0%]; SoC: 18 [6.5%]); viral upper respiratory infection (osimertinib: 27 
[9.7%];  SoC:  20  [7.2%]);  pneumonia  (osimertinib:  18  [6.5%];  SoC:  9  [3.2%]);  and  conjunctivitis 
(osimertinib: 14 [5.0%]; SoC: 20 [7.2%]).The overall event rate per 100 patient-years of AEs in the 
Infections and Infestations SOC was lower in the osimertinib arm than in the SoC arm: 52.9 and 61.8, 
respectively. In both treatment arms, the vast majority of infectious AEs were CTCAE grade 1 or grade 
2. CTCAE grade 3 AEs were reported in 16 (5.7%) patients on osimertinib and 17 (6.1%) patients on 
SoC. There was 1 (0.4%) patient with CTCAE grade 4 AE of pneumonia in the SoC arm. CTCAE grade 5 
AEs in the Infections & Infestations SOC were reported in 2 (0.7%) patients on osimertinib (pneumonia 
[1]  and  respiratory  tract  infection  [1],  both  unrelated  to  osimertinib)  and  5  (1.8%)  patients  on  SoC 
(pneumonia and sepsis [2 each], and endocarditis).  
A total of 18 (6.5%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 26 (9.4%) patients in the SoC arm had AEs in 
this SOC reported as an SAE, with the most common SAE being pneumonia (7 [2.5%] patients in each 
treatment arm). 
Dose interruptions due to AEs in the Infections & Infestations SOC were reported in 21 (7.5%) patients 
in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  14  (5.1%)  patients  in  the  SoC  arm.  Events  led  to  dose  reduction  in  1 
(0.4%)  patient  in  the  osimertinib  arm  (AE  of  paronychia)  and  no  patients  in  the  SoC  arm.  Three 
(1.1%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 5 (1.8%) patients in the SoC arm discontinued treatment 
due to AEs in the Infections & Infestations SOC.

Pooled population 
Adverse  events  of  Infections  and  infestations  (SOC)  in  the  pooled  population  were  reported  in  712 
(62.3%)  patients.  The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  (≥  3%)  were:  paronychia  (276  [24.2%]  vs.  81 
[29.0%] in FLAURA), Upper respiratory tract infection (142 [12.4%] vs. 28 [10.0%] in FLAURA), Viral 
upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (132  [11.6%]  vs.  27  [9.7%]  in  FLAURA),  Urinary  tract  infection  (89 
[7.8%] vs. 12 [4.3%] in FLAURA), pneumonia (67 [5.9%] vs. 18 [6.5%] FLAURA), conjunctivitis (46 
[4.0%] vs. 14 [5.0%] in FLAURA) and pharyngitis (35 [3.1%] vs. 10 [3.6%] in FLAURA). Most of the 
AEs were grade 1 (26.3% vs. 23.7% FLAURA) or grade 2 (28.1% vs. 35.8%). CTAE grade 5 AEs were 
reported in 13 (1.1%) patients in the pooled population and 2 (0.7%) patients in the osimertinib arm 
in FLAURA.  
Haemorrhages  
Study FLAURA 
Adverse  events  in  the  Haemorrhages  SMQ  were  reported  in  a  similar  proportion  of  patients  in  the  2 
treatment arms: 39 (14.0%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 51 (18.4%) patients in the SoC arm 
(DCO1). The event rate per 100 patient-years was lower in the osimertinib arm than in the SoC arm: 
11.2 and 18.8, respectively. Aside from epistaxis (17 [6.1%] osimertinib vs. 14 [5.1%] SoC), no single 
PT in this SMQ was reported in >5% of patients in either treatment arm. 
In  most  patients,  the  events  were  either  CTCAE  grade  1  or  CTCAE  grade  2,  with  1  (0.4%)  patient  in 
the osimertinib arm having a CTCAE grade 4 subdural haematoma. In the SoC arm, 1 (0.4%) patient 
had a CTCAE grade 4 pulmonary haemorrhage and 2 (0.7%) patients had grade 5 events (1 each of GI 
haemorrhage and haemoptysis). 
Haemorrhages  AEs  were  classified  as  SAEs  in  3  (1.1%)  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  (PTs  of 
haemorrhagic  stroke,  haemorrhoidal  haemorrhage,  and  subdural  haematoma)  and  5  (1.8%)  patients 
in  the  SoC  arm  (PTs  of  GI  haemorrhage,  haemoptysis,  melena,  pulmonary  haemorrhage,  and 
subarachnoidal haemorrhage). 
The  AE  of  subarachnoidal  haemorrhage  in  the  SoC  arm  led  to  dosing  interruption;  no  other 
Haemorrhages AEs led to dose interruption. There were no dose reductions due to events in this SMQ. 
Events  led  to  discontinuation  of  1  (0.4%)  patient  in  the  osimertinib  arm  (PT  of  subdural  haematoma 
reported the same day as a head injury) and of 3 (1.1%) patients in the SoC arm (PTs of haemoptysis, 
GI haemorrhage, and Henoch-Schonlein purpura). 
Pooled population 
The  incidence  of  Hemorrhages  SOC  AEs  in  the  osimertinib  arm  in  FLAURA  was  similar  to  the  pooled 
population: 39 (14.0%) and 191 (16.7%), respectively. Epistaxis (63 (5.5%) pooled population vs. 17 
(6.1%) FLAURA) was the only PT reported in ≥ 5% of patients.

Laboratory findings 
Study FLAURA 
Haematology 
Decreases  from  baseline  in  median  values  for  platelets,  neutrophils,  and  leukocytes  were  observed 
early in treatment with osimertinib. Median values appeared to stabilise after the initial drop, with the 
majority of patients experiencing no change in CTCAE grade, or a single grade change. 
Haemoglobin 
For  haemoglobin-related  changes  reported  as  AEs  (anaemia  and  haemoglobin  decreased),  the 
incidence and severity of AEs were similar in the 2 treatment arms, with no CTCAE grade 4 or grade 5 
events and only 1 AE reported as an SAE (CTCAE grade 3 anaemia in the SoC arm). In both treatment 
arms, there were few dose modifications or discontinuation of treatment.  
Worsening in CTCAE grade shifts in haemoglobin was recorded in a higher proportion of patients in the 
osimertinib arm (60.1%) than in the SoC arm (47.0%), with no 4-grade shifts reported in either arm. 
Platelets 
Worsening  in  CTCAE  grade  shifts  in  platelets  was  recorded  in  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the 
osimertinib arm (51.6%) than in the SoC arm (11.9%). Almost all shifts in both treatment arms were 
1-grade  (osimertinib:  134  [49.1%]  patients;  SoC:  30  [11.2%]  patients).  CTCAE  2-grade  shifts 
occurred  in  4  (1.5%)  patients  on  osimertinib  and  1  (0.4%)  patient  on  SoC,  and  3-grade  shifts  in  1 
(0.4%) patient in each arm. One (0.4%) osimertinib patient had a 4-grade shift in platelets.  
A higher proportion of patients in the osimertinib arm experienced platelet counts below the LLN: 151 
(54.1%)  osimertinib,  36  (13.0%)  SoC.  Of  the  patients  who  had  a  shift  from  baseline  in  grade  of  the 
laboratory  parameter  of  platelets  (decreased),  134/141  (95.0%)  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  30/32 
(93.8%) in the SoC arm were CTCAE grade 1.

Adverse  events  related  to  a  reduction  in  platelet  count  (ie,  thrombocytopenia  and  platelet  count 
decreased) were reported in a higher proportion of patients in the osimertinib arm than the SoC arm: 
14.7%  vs  1.8%,  respectively.  Most  of  the  events  in  both  treatment  arms  were  reported  as  CTCAE 
grade  1.  CTCAE  grade  3  events  were  reported  in  2  (0.7%)  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  no 
patients in the SoC arm. No CTCAE ≥grade 4 events were reported in the osimertinib arm vs. 1 (0.4%) 
in the SoC arm. One SAE event of platelet count decreased was reported in each treatment arm.  
AEs  of  bleeding,  bruising  or  haemorrhage  were  reported  concomitantly  with  platelet  count  below  the 
LLN  in  9  (3.2%)  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  in  6  (2.2%)  patients  in  the  SoC  arm.  In  the 
osimertinib arm, the patients with bleeding AEs included 3 patients with epistaxis; and 1 patient each 
with  conjunctival  haemorrhage,  contusion,  gingival  bleeding,  haematoma,  haematuria,  haemoptysis, 
haemorrhoidal  haemorrhage,  and  vaginal  haemorrhage.  In  the  SoC  arm,  bleeding  AEs  occurring 
concomitantly  with  platelet  counts  below  the  LLN  were  haemoptysis  (2  patients);  and  diarrhoea 
haemorrhagic,  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation,  epistaxis,  haematochezia,  haematuria,  and 
purpura (1 patient each). 
Leucocytes 
Worsening in CTCAE grade shifts in leukocytes values were reported in a higher proportion of patients 
in the osimertinib arm (72.6%) than in the SoC arm (32.2%). A majority of grade shifts in leukocytes 
were  1-grade  shifts  (osimertinib:  133  [50.0%]  patients;  SoC:  72  [27.6%]  patients),  with  2-grade 
shifts  reported  in  58  (21.8%)  patients on  osimertinib  and  11  (4.2%)  patients  on  SoC.  One  patient in 
the osimertinib arm had a 3-grade shift and one patient in each treatment arm had a 4-grade shift in 
leukocytes. 
Adverse events of leukopenia or WBC count decreased were reported in a higher proportion of patients 
in  the  osimertinib  arm  (45  [16.1%])  than  the  SoC  arm  (8  [2.9%]).  Most  patients  in  both  treatment 
arms had events that were CTCAE grade 1 or grade 2, with no SAEs and only 1 (0.4%) patient in the 
osimertinib  arm  reporting  a  CTCAE  ≥  grade  3  event.  The  majority  of  the  AEs  (71/80  [88.8%]  in  the 
osimertinib  arm  and  8/9  [88.9%]  in  the  SoC  arm)  did  not  require  medication.  Three  events  required 
dose  interruption  and  1  event  required  dose  reduction  in  the  osimertinib  arm;  no  event  led  to 
discontinuation. No event required dose interruption, modification or led to discontinuation in the SoC 
arm. 
Adverse  events  in  the  Infections  &  Infestations  SOC  occurred  concomitantly  with  leukocyte  counts 
below the LLN in 35.1% of patients on osimertinib and 7.9% of patients on SoC.  
Neutrophils 
Worsening  in  CTCAE  grade  shifts  in  neutrophils  was  recorded  in  110  (41.2%)  patients  in  the 
osimertinib arm vs. 26 (9.9%) patients in the SoC arm. The vast majority of grade shifts in neutrophils 
were  1-grade  shifts  (osimertinib:  52  [19.5%]  patients;  SoC:  15  [5.7%]  patients)  and  2-grade  shifts 
(osimertinib: 50 [18.7%]; SoC: 10 [3.8%]). Eight (3.0%) patients on osimertinib (one patient on SoC) 
had 3-grade shifts in neutrophils. There were no 4-grade shifts in neutrophils in either arm. 
Adverse  events  of  neutropenia  or  neutrophil  count  decreased  were  reported  in  a  higher  proportion  of 
patients in the osimertinib arm (31 [11.1%]) than in the SoC arm (3 [1.1%]). Six (2.2%) patients in 
the osimertinib arm and one (0.4%) patient in the SoC arm had a CTCAE ≥  grade 3 event. No event 
was reported as an SAE.  
Adverse  events  in  the  Infections  &  Infestations  SOC  occurred  concomitantly  with  neutrophil  counts 
below the LLN in 33 (11.8%) patients on osimertinib and 5 (1.8%) patients on SoC.

Lymphocytes 
Adverse events of lymphocyte count decreased were reported in a higher proportion of patients in the 
osimertinib  arm  (3.2%)  than  the  SoC  arm  (0.4%),  as  were  AEs  of  lymphopenia  (2.2%  and  1.1%, 
respectively). No serious AEs of lymphocyte count decreased or lymphopenia were reported.  
Worsening CTCAE grade shifts in lymphocyte values were reported in higher percentage of patients in 
the  osimertinib  arm  than  the  SoC  arm  (65.2%  vs.  35.7%,  respectively).  The  vast  majority  of  grade 
shifts in lymphocytes were either 1-grade shifts (osimertinib: 82 [30.7%] patients; SoC: 44 [16.7%]) 
or  2-grade  shifts  (osimertinib:  76  [28.5%];  SoC:  39  [14.8%]).  14  (5.2%)  patients  in the  osimertinib 
arm and 11 (4.2%) patients in the SoC arm had 3-grade shifts in lymphocytes. Two (0.7%) patients in 
the osimertinib arm had 4-grade shifts in lymphocytes (no patients in the SoC arm). 
Pooled population 
Results from the pooled dataset show a consistent safety profile for osimertinib as that demonstrated 
in FLAURA.  
The  most  commonly  reported  haematology-related  AEs  PTs  were  anaemia  (13.1%  pooled  population 
vs.  12.2%  FLAURA),  platelet  count  decreased  (8.9%  pooled  population  vs.  5.0%  FLAURA), 
thrombocytopenia (8.1% pooled population vs. 9.3% FLAURA), white blood cell count decreased (7.7% 
pooled population vs. 8.6% FLAURA) and neutropenia (6.5% pooled population vs. 6.8%).  
In the pooled population, neutrophils decreased grade shifts incidence was 34.7%, mostly grade 1 and 
grade  2  [15%]  each;  Lymphocytes  decreased  was  67.1%,  mostly  grade  1  (33.3%)  and  grade  2 
(26.6%); leukocytes decreased grade shifts incidence was 67.8% mostly grade 1 (47.8%) and platelet 
count decreased events grade shifts incidence was 54.1%, mostly grade 1 (49.9%). 
General clinical chemistry 
Analysis of reported clinical chemistry values have been considered in conjunction with any relevant or 
related clinical biochemistry AEs. 
In  the  osimertinib  arm,  values  remained  generally  consistent  over  time  and  there  were  no  clinically 
significant  changes  in  median  values  of  albumin,  calcium,  glucose,  magnesium,  potassium  or  sodium 
observed during treatment in the majority of patients. The majority of CTCAE grade shifts seen  were 
1-grade shifts, with only a small percentage of patients in the osimertinib arm developing a 3-grade or 
4-grade shift. 
There was a low frequency of reports of abnormal clinical biochemistry AEs. As would be expected with 
the small magnitude of these changes, no clinically significant sequelae were observed. 
Safety in special populations 
Effect of gender 
Study FLAURA 
The 2 groups were broadly consistent in terms of the most commonly reported PTs, with only vomiting 
(4.0%  males  vs.  15.2%  females)  and  ECG  QT  prolonged  (3  [3.0%]  males  vs.  25  [14.0%]  females) 
having  a  difference  of  ≥10  pp  between  genders.  There  was  a  doubling  of  incidence  between  genders 
for the PTs pneumonia (11.9% male vs. 3.4% female) and anaemia (6.9% male vs. 15.2% female). 
The  only  key  safety  topic  grouped  term  of  interest  with  a  difference  of  >10  pp  between  male  and 
female patients was Cardiac effects (QT) (4.0% males vs. 14.0% females). This difference was driven 
largely by the PT of ECG QT prolonged.

Consistent  with  FLAURA,  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  similar  across  male  (N=400)  and  female 
(N=742) patients (98.5% vs. 98.7%, respectively) as well as the incidence of AEs of CTCAE ≥ grade 3 
(37.3% vs. 38.4%). AEs  of CTCAE ≥ grade 3 that were considered by the investigator to be causally 
related to treatment were slightly higher among female patients (10.5% vs. 16%).

Effect of age 
Study FLAURA 
Table 55: Adverse events in any category, by age group at baseline among patients in the osimertinib 
arm in FLAURA (Safety analysis set) 
There  was  at  least  a  10-pp  difference  in  incidence  among  patients  <  65  years,  patients  65-74  years 
and patients ≥ 75 years of age in the following PTs: diarrhoea (58.8%, 50.0%, 72.2%, respectively), 
dermatitis  acneiform  (30.7%,  23.3%,  8.3%),  headache  (17.0%,  4.4%,  8.3%),  dyspnoea  (15.7%, 
10.0%,  5.6%), decreased  appetite  (13.1%,  28.9%,  27.8%),  weight  decreased  (4.6%,  1.1%,  16.7%) 
conjunctivitis (3.9%, 3.3%, 13.9%) and pulmonary embolism (1.3%, 2.2, 13.9%). 
The  key  safety  topics  grouped  terms  of  interest  with  a  difference  of  >10  pp  between  patients  <65 
years of age, patients 64-75 years, and patients ≥75 years, respectively, were: diarrhoea (58.8% vs. 
50.0% vs. 72.2% ≥75), nail effects (33.3% vs. 40.0% vs. 27.8%), renal effects (13.7% vs. 7.8% vs. 
22.2%, with the PT of acute kidney injury reported in no patients <65 or 65-74 and in 8.3% patients 
≥75),  skin  effects  (78.4%  vs.  71.1%  vs.  63.9%,  with  the  difference  driven  primarily  by  the  PT  of 
dermatitis  acneiform:  30.7%  vs.  23.3%  vs.  8.3%)  upper  GI  tract  inflammatory  events  (46.4%  vs. 
34.4% vs. 36.1%). 
Pooled population 
Consistent  with  FLAURA,  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  similar  (>  98%)  among  the  3  groups: 
patients < 65 years (N=657), patients 65-74 years (N=338) and patients ≥ 75 years (N=147). As well 
as in FLAURA study, the incidence of AEs in each category, except AEs causally related to osimertinib, 
appeared to be age-dependent: AEs of CTCAE grade ≥ 3 (33.3%, 40.5%, 53.1%, respectively), AEs of 
CTCAE grade ≥ 3 considered by the Investigator to be possibly related to osimertinib (10.7%, 16.3% 
24.5%),  SAE  (25.6%,  29.3%,  36.7%)  and  SAE  considered  to  be  possibly  causally  related  to 
osimertinib (4.0%, 8.9%, 9.5%). 
Effect of baseline performance status 
Assessment report

Study FLAURA 
Assessment  of  the  safety  profile  of  osimertinib  at  the  AE  category  level  among  patients  with  WHO 
performance  status  (PS)  at  baseline  of  0  (N=112)  and  WHO  score  of  1  (N=167)  in  FLAURA  showed 
alignment with the overall safety profile. With the exception of a higher incidence of AEs of CTCAE ≥ 
grade 3 in patients with the higher baseline WHO score (29.5% score 0 vs. 37.1% score 1).  
The only key safety topic grouped terms of interest with a difference of >10 pp between WHO score of 
0  and  WHO  score  or  1  patients  was  Upper  GI  tract  inflammatory  events  (50.9%  for  patients  with  a 
WHO score of 0 vs. 34.7% for patients with a WHO score of 1). The difference was driven primarily by 
the  PT  of  stomatitis,  which  was  reported  in  39.3%  of  WHO  score  of  0  patients  and  21.6%  of  WHO 
score of 1 patients. 
Pooled population 
Consistent  with  FLAURA,  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  similar  (>  98%)  among  the  2  groups: 
patients  with  WHO  PS  of  0  (N=420)  and  PS  of  1  (N=721).  The  incidence  of  CTCAE  grade  ≥  3  AEs 
(31.2%  score  0  vs.  41.9%  score  1)  and  the  incidence  of  CTCAE  grade  ≥  3  AEs  considered  by  the 
Investigator  possibly  related  to  osimertinib  (10.0%  vs.  16.5%)  was  higher  in  patients  with  higher 
baseline  WHO  score.  The  incidence  of  SAE  was  also  higher  in  patients  with  WHO  score  1  (23.6%  vs. 
30.7%). SAE considered to be possibly related to osimertinib were similar between both groups (5.0% 
WHO score 0 vs. 6.8% WHO score 1). 
Effect of comorbidity of hypertension 
Study FLAURA 
Assessment of the safety profile of osimertinib at the AE category level among patients with a history 
of hypertension (N=109)  and those with no  hypertension (N=170) in FLAURA showed alignment with 
the overall safety profile. The overall incidence of AEs was similar between the 2 groups; AEs causally 
related to osimertinib were broadly similar for patients with and those without hypertension (89% vs. 
91.8%,  respectively).  A  greater  proportion  of  patients  with  hypertension  than  patients  without 
hypertension had AEs that were CTCAE ≥ grade 3 (39.8% hypertension vs. 30.6% no hypertension) or 
were reported as SAEs (29.4% hypertension vs. 16.5% no hypertension). 
The  2  groups  were  broadly  consistent  in  terms  of  the  most  commonly  reported  PTs,  with  only 
decreased  appetite  (26.6%  hypertension  vs.  15.9%  no  hypertension)  and  headache  (3.7% 
hypertension  vs.  17.1%  no  hypertension)  having  a  difference  of  ≥  10  pp.  The  only  key  safety  topic 
grouped  terms  of  interest  with  a  difference  of  >10  pp  between  patients  with  a  co-morbidity  of 
hypertension  and  those  without  was  Upper  GI  tract  inflammatory  events  (33.9%  co-morbidity  of 
hypertension  vs.  45.9%  those  without).  The  difference  was  driven  primarily  by  the  PT  of  stomatitis, 
which  was  reported  in  27  (24.8%)  patients  with  a  co-morbidity  of  hypertension  and  53  (31.2%) 
patients without. 
Pooled population 
Consistent  with  FLAURA  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  similar  (>  98%)  between  patients  with 
comorbidity of hypertension (N=393) and patients without comorbidity of hypertension (N=746). The 
incidence  of  AEs  that  were  CTCAE  ≥  grade  3  was  slightly  higher  in  patients  with  hypertension  than 
patients  without  hypertension  (42.4%  vs.  35.7%,  respectively).  There  were  no  notable  differences 
between the 2 groups in any other of the categorical parameters.

Effect of baseline renal function 
Study FLAURA 
Table 56: Adverse events in any category, by baseline renal function among patients in the osimertinib 
arm in FLAURA (Safety analysis set) 
Pooled population 
Consistent  with  FLAURA  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  similar  (>  98%)  between  patients  with 
normal  renal  function  (N=407),  mild  renal  function  (N=497)  and  moderate  renal  function  (N=220). 
The  incidence  of  AEs  of  CTCAE  ≥  grade  3  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  posibly  related  to 
osimertinib was higher in patiens with moderate impairment (19.5%) than in patiens with normal renal 
function  (10.3%)  or  mild  renal  function  (14.9%).  SAE  were  numerically  higher  in  patients  with 
moderate renal impairment (32.7%) than in patients with normal function (28%) or mild renal function 
(26.4%).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
At DCO1 A total of 351 (63.1%) patients had discontinued their randomised treatment: 138 (49.5%) in 
the osimertinib arm and 213 (76.9%) in the SoC arm. In both treatment arms, the most frequent 
reason for treatment discontinuation was worsening of the condition under investigation (osimertinib: 
87 patients [31.2%]; SoC: 151 patients [54.5%]). Other reasons for treatment discontinuation, 
summarised by primary reason, were: adverse events (osimertinib: 36 [12.9%]; SoC: 50 [18.1%]); 
subject decision: (osimertinib: 12 [4.3%]; SoC: 8 [2.9%]); severe non-compliance to protocol 
(osimertinib: 0; SoC: 1 [0.4%]); other reasons: 6 (1.1%) patients (osimertinib: 3 [1.1%]; SoC: 3 
[1.1%]).  
Adverse events leading to discontinuation 
Study FLAURA 
The majority of discontinuations were due to single events.

Table 60: Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug in more than 1% of patients in either 
treatment arm in FLAURA, by preferred term (Safety analysis set) 
Pooled population 
AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  osimertinib  in  the  pooled  population  was  reported  by  109  patients 
(9.5%). AEs events leading of study discontinuation causally related to osimertinib were 64 (5.6%).  
Adverse events leading to dose reduction  
FLAURA 
AEs  leading  to  dose  reduction  were  reported  in  a  low  proportion  of  patients  in  each  treatment  arm, 
although the SoC arm had a numerically higher proportion: 11 (3.9%) osimertinib vs. 17 (6.1%) SoC. 
Adverse events leading to dose interruption 
FLAURA 
Adverse  events  with  an  action  taken  of  dose  interruption  were  reported  in  similar  proportion  of 
patients: 72 (25.8%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 70 (25.3%) patients in the SoC arm. There 
did not appear to be any single AE driving the interruption rate in the osimertinib arm, as 17 events led 
to dose interruption in more than 1 patient each in the osimertinib arm, none of which was reported in 
more  than  3%  of  patients.  In  the  SoC  arm,  increases  in  transaminases  were  the  primary  reason  for 
drug interruptions. 
Analysis of safety after crossover in Phase III study FLAURA 
48  (17.3%)  patients  in  FLAURA  crossed  over  to  osimertinib  treatment  after  BICR-confirmed  objective 
progression  on  SoC  and  a  T790M  positive  test  result  based  on  tissue  or  plasma.  A  new  baseline  was 
determined at the start of osimertinib treatment for these patients. 
Common adverse events  
Adverse  events  were  reported  in  37  (77.1%)  of  the  48  patients  randomised  to  the  SoC  arm  who 
crossed over to osimertinib following confirmed objective progression on SoC.  
The  most  frequently  reported  PTs  (≥10%  of  crossover  patients)  were  diarrhoea  (9  [18.8%]),  and 
paronychia,  cough,  dry  skin,  and  nausea  (5  [10.4%]).  Adverse  events  of  CTCAE  ≥grade  3  were 
Assessment report

reported in 6/48 (12.5%) patients. The CTCAE ≥grade 3 AEs included pneumonia in 2 (4.2%) patients; 
and bacteraemia, febrile infection, oesophageal candidiasis, oral candidiasis, anxiety, atrial thrombosis, 
and  septic  shock  in  1  (2.1%)  patient  each.  There  were  no  CTCAE  grade  4  AEs  in  patients  after 
crossover.  One  case  of  pneumonia  and  the  case  of  septic  shock  were  CTCAE  grade  5  AEs,  both  of 
which were considered to be unrelated to osimertinib. 
Adverse events of special interest 
In general, no new safety findings were seen in AESIs after crossover. Within the key safety topic AEs, 
the only PTs reported in >10% of patients after crossover were diarrhoea (9 [18.8%]) and paronychia 
and  dry  skin  (5  [10.4%]  each).  No  CTCAE  ≥grade  3  key  safety  topic  AESIs  were  reported  in  any 
patient after crossover. 
Serious adverse events 
Serious AEs were reported for 8 (16.7%) of the 48 crossover patients. The only SAE reported in more 
than 1 patient was pneumonia, in 2 (4.2%) patients. In neither patient was the SAE considered by the 
Investigator to be possibly related to osimertinib. 
Deaths  
A  total  of  9  deaths  were  reported  after  patients  crossed  over  to  osimertinib  following  confirmed 
objective  disease  progression  on  the  SoC  treatment,  either  during  the  crossover  period  or  its  28-day 
follow-up.  Seven  (77.8%)  of  the  9  deaths  were  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  related  to  the 
disease under investigation only. In 2 (22.2%) of the 9 patients, the death was considered to be due 
to an AE only.  
Clinical laboratory results 
Adverse events in the Blood & lymphatic disorders SOC included CTCAE grade 2 anaemia in 1 (2.1%) 
patient. Adverse events related to haematology tests in the Investigations SOC were neutrophil count 
decreased in 2 (4.2%) patients (both CTCAE grade 2) and WBC count decreased (CTCAE grade 2) in 1 
(2.1%) patient. No SAEs were reported in these SOCs. 
Discontinuations and dose modification 
Adverse  events  led  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  osimertinib  in  2  (4.2%)  of  the  48  patients  who 
crossed  over  to  osimertinib  after  PD:  pneumonia  in  Patient  E2205008  and  septic  shock  in  Patient 
E3402006, each of which led to the patient’s death. Neither AE was considered by the Investigator to 
be possibly related to osimertinib. 
In  the  48  SoC  patients  who  crossed  over  to  osimertinib  therapy  after  PD,  only  1  patient  had  a  dose 
interruption due to an AE (weight decreased). Adverse events of rash and oral candidiasis each led to 
dose reduction to 40 mg osimertinib in 1 (2.1%) patient after crossover.

Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing  data  have  been  summarised  in  the  latest  PBRER,  which  included  data  from  13 
November  2016  to  12  May  2017.  In  this  PBRER,  the  total  cumulative  post-marketing  exposure  to 
osimertinib for all doses and all countries as of 12 May 2017 was 7295.5 patient-years. 
In  the  PBRER  period  from  13  November  2016  to  12  May  2017,  the  majority  of  postmarketing  cases 
received  were  in  keeping  with  the  patient  population  being  treated  and  the  known  safety  profile  of 
osimertinib.  Cumulatively,  the  most  frequent  spontaneously  reported  events  were  from  the 
Investigations  SOC  (n=188),  the  majority  of  which  were  non-serious  (n=164).  The  most  frequently 
reported event in this SOC was platelet count decreased (n=38), of which 37 were non-serious. Events 
in the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC were the next most frequently reported (n=179), the majority of 
which  were  non-serious  (n=147).  The  most  commonly  reported  event  was  dry  mouth  (n=73;  non-
serious  =61).  The  third  most  frequent  SOC  in  terms  of  reported  events  was  Skin  and  subcutaneous 
tissue  disorders  (n=178;  non-serious  =  169),  with  rash  being  the  most  commonly  reported  event 
(n=59; non-serious = 54).  
No  further  changes  to  the  reference  safety  information  have  been  made  since  marketing  approval  of 
osimertinib.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  assessment  is  based  mainly  on  556  patients  from  the  FLAURA  study  (279  received 
80 mg osimertinib [DCO 12 June 2017] and 277 patients received SoC). All patients randomised to the 
SoC  arm  in  the  US  received  erlotinib  and  all  patients  randomised  in  Japan  received  gefitinib.  The 
results have not been split on gefitinib and erlotinib, but are combined to SoC group.  
The accumulated safety population consists of 1142 patients from Phase I-III studies treated with 80 
mg osimertinib, including the 279 patients in the FLAURA study. 
A total of 48 patients crossed over to osimertinib treatment within the study after confirmed objective 
disease progression on SoC and a T790M positive test result based on tissue or plasma. 
Adverse events (AEs) 
No new safety signals have been detected from the FLAURA study. The safety profile reported is in line 
with the adverse reactions that have previously been described. 
Generally, the safety profile of osimertinib appears similar to that of the SoC (erlotinib and gefitinib). 
However, osimertinib had a more favourable profile regarding severity of AEs with a lower frequency of 
AEs CTCAE grade 3 or higher causally related to treatment of 18.3% compared to 28.2% for SoC.  
The most frequently reported AEs (≥ 50%) in either arm were in the SOCs of Gastrointestinal disorders 
(78.5%  vs.  87.0%,  osimertinib  and  SoC  respectively),  Skin  &  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (77.4% 
vs.  87.0%)  and  Infections  and  Infestations  (66.3%  vs.  60.6%).  The  incidence  of  AEs  was  generally 
similar  between  the  two  treatment  arms,  except  for  the  AEs  in  the  skin  &  subcutaneous  tissue 
disorders, which were reported in a greater proportion of patients in the SoC arm. 
The most commonly reported PTs in the osimertinib arm (≥ 20%) were diarrhoea (58.1% vs. 58.1%, 
osimertinib  and  SoC  respectively),  dry  skin  (31.5  vs.  32.5%),  paronychia  (29.4%  vs.  29.6%), 
stomatitis  (28.7%  vs.  20.2%),  dermatitis  acneiform  (25.4%  vs.  48.4%)  and  decreased  appetite 
(22.2% vs. 19.5%).  
Among  these  most  common  AEs  stomatitis  was  more  frequent  in  the  osimertinib  arm  whereas 
dermatitis  acneiform  was  more  frequent  in  the  SoC.  Other  PTs  more  frequent  in  the  osimertinib  arm

were:  ECG  QT  prolonged  (10.0%  vs.  4.3%),  pyrexia  (10.4%  vs.  4.0%)  and  dyspnoea  (12.9%  vs. 
7.6%).  In  the  SoC  arm  the  incidence  of  AST  increased  (9.3%  vs.  24.5%),  ALT  increased  (6.5%  vs. 
27.1%)  and  alopecia  (7.2%  vs.  12.6%)  was  higher  than  in  the  osimertinib  arm.  In  general,  the 
incidence  of  most  common  AEs  was  similar  in  both  treatment  arms.  Other  differences  of  notice  are 
decrease  in  platelet  count,  leucocytes,  lymphocytes  and  neutrophils  (some  associated  with  AEs)  and 
cardiac failure (4.7% osimertinib vs 2.2% SoC). 
AEs  of  CTCAE  ≥  grade  3  was  lower  in  the  osimertinib  arm  than  in  the  SoC  arm  (36.9%  vs.  45.1%, 
respectively)  as  well  as  those  AEs  of  CTCAE  ≥  grade  3  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  possibly 
related to study treatment (18.3% vs. 28.2%). Differences observed between treatment arms seem to 
be  driven  to  a  great  extent  by  hepatic  (transaminases  increased)  and  skin  related events  (dermatitis 
acneiform mainly), more frequent in the SoC arm. The most frequently reported AEs of CTCAE ≥ grade 
3 considered to be possibly related to osimertinib were diarrhoea (2.2%), decreased apetite and ECG 
QT  prolonged  (1.8%  each),  ILD  and  GGT  increased  (1.1%  each),  asthenia,  fatigue,  AST  increased, 
ejection fraction decreased, neutrophil count decreased and platelet count decreased (0.7% each).  
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
ILD/pneumonitis: ILD grouped term (ILD and pneumonitis) has a low but numerically higher incidence 
in the osimertinib arm than in the SoC arm (4.3% vs. 2.2%, respectively).  
Cardiac effects (QT): adverse events in the overall cardiac effect grouped term (QT) were reported in a 
higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  than  in  the  SoC  arm  (11.5%  vs.  5.4%, 
respectively).  
Cardiac  effects  (cardiac  failure):  cardiac  failure  AEs  were  reported  in  a  low  but  numerically  higher 
proportion in the osimertinib arm (4.7%) than in the SoC arm (2.2%). 
None of the comparators gefitinib and erlotinib have included cardiac effects as adverse reaction in the 
SmPCs (section 4.8) or mentioned it in special warnings and precautions (section 4.4). Cardiac failure 
is  included  in  the  RMP  of  osimertinib  as  an  important  potential  risk,  QT  prolongation  is  listed  as  an 
adverse  reaction  and  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  (LVEF)  decrease  is  mentioned  in  section  4.4  of 
the  SmPC.  QT  prolongation  is  much  higher  for  females  compared to  males  (14.0%  females  vs.  3.0% 
males) and Asian compared to white population (14.4% Asian vs. 3.0% white). The analysis of a large 
number  of  potential  risk  factors  using  the  LVEF  decrease  data  together  with  osimertinib  PK  exposure 
did  not  identify  any  covariates  potentially  confounding  the  exposure-to-LVEF  event  probability 
relationship. 
Diarrhoea: diarrhoea was the most commonly reported AE in either treatment arm (58.1%, each), with 
a low incidence of AEs of CTCAE ≥ grade 3 (2.2% osimertinib vs. 2.5% SoC). 
Skin effects: incidence of Skin Effects grouped term was lower in the osimertinib arm than in the SoC 
arm  (74.2%  vs.  85.2%,  respectively);  differences  observed  between  treatment  arms  were  driven 
mainly by PT dermatitis acneiform. 
Upper gastrointestinal tract inflammatory events: incidence of AEs in this grouped term was higher in 
the osimertinib arm than in the SoC arm (41.2% vs. 32.5%, respectively). 
Nail  effects:  AEs  in  this  grouped  term  were  reported  in  35.8%  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and 
33.6% patients in the SoC arm. 
Ocular effects: incidence of AEs ocular effects grouped term was lower in the osimertinib arm than in 
the SoC arm (17.2% vs. 23.1%), being all of them grade 1 or grade 2 in the osimertinib arm. No SAEs 
were reported.

Renal  effects:  renal-related  AEs  were  reported  in  15.1%  patients  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  9.7% 
patients in the SoC arm.  
Hepatobiliary  effects:  hepatic-related  AEs  were  reported  in  a  lower  proportion  of  patients  in  the 
osimertinib  arm  than  in  the  SoC  arm  (14.7%  vs.  36.5%,  respectively),  driven  most  of  them  by  the 
Investigations SOC (12.5% vs. 31.0%, osimertinib and SoC respectively). 
Infections  and  infestations:  infections  and  infestations  were  reported  in  185  (66.3%)  patients  in  the 
osimertinib arm and 168 (60.6%) in the SoC arm. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
The  incidence  of  SAEs  was  similar  between  the  osimertinib  and  SoC  arms  (22.6%  vs.  26.0%, 
respectively). The most frequently reported SAEs considered to be possibly related to osimertinib were 
interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis, diarrhoea, enterocolitis and pyrexia. 
Deaths  
Overall  71  patients  (25.4%)  in  the  osimertinib  arm  and  97  patients  (35.0%)  in  the  SoC  arm  died. 
There  were  16  deaths  reported  as  AEs  (8  osimerinib,  8  SoC)  of  which  one  in  the  SoC  arm  was 
considered possibly related to study drug. None of the deaths in the osimertinib arm were considered 
to be possibly related to study treatment. 
Laboratory findings  
Early reductions in the median laboratory counts of leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils and platelets 
have been observed in patients treated with TAGRISSO, which stabilised over time and then remained 
above  the  lower  limit  of  normal.  Adverse  events  of  leukopenia,  lymphopenia,  neutropenia  and 
thrombocytopenia  have  been  reported,  most  of  which  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity  and  did  not 
lead to dose interruptions.  
Special populations  
The MAH has conducted additional analyses based on updated data from 1142 patients, of which 197 
patients  were  below  50  kg.  Low  weight  (<50  kg)  and  high  age  (>65  years)  were  identified  as 
significant  predictors  of  developing  AEs  of  CTCAE  grade≥  3.  Gender  and  race  were  not  significant 
predictors after these effects were accounted for.  
According to logistic regression analyses, a patient weighing <50 kg is approximately twice as likely to 
develop  CTCAE  grade≥  3  AE  and  2-4  times  as  likely  to  develop  QT  prolongation  compared  with 
patients  in  the  higher  weight  categories.  In  the  QT  prolongation  analysis,  there  was  also  a  gender-
related difference, with the probability of QT prolongation being 2.3 higher in females compared with 
males.  This  gender-related  QT  prolongation  difference  is  well  described  in  the  literature.  No  effect  of 
race was seen. 
At 80 mg dose, patients with low body weight (<50 kg) had higher frequencies of Grade ≥3 adverse 
events (52% vs. 35%) and QT prolongation (14% vs. 4%) than patients with higher body weight (≥50 
kg). 
Patients  with  high  age  (>65  years)  and/or  low  body  weight  (<50  kg)  are  at  increased  risk  of 
developing adverse events of Grade 3 or higher. Closer monitoring is recommended in these patients. 
It  is  reported  that  renal  events  are  more  than  doubled  when  normal  renal  function  is  compared  to 
moderate renal impairment.   
Given the low grade of severity of events (mostly grade 1 or 2) and the limited number of cases at this 
time no further changes to the product information is warranted. The MAH is currently running a phase 
I study in patients with advanced solid tumours and normal as well as severe renal impairment where 
PK,  safety  and  tolerability  of  osimertinib  are  investigated.  The  MAH  is  recommended  to  submit  the 
results which will provide additional data on patients with renal impairment.

Discontinuation of study treatment due to AEs appears similar among treatment arms: 37 (13.3%) in 
the  osimertinib  arm  and  49  (17.7%)  in  the  SoC  arm.  In  the  osimertinib  arm,  27  (9.7%)  were 
considered  to  be  possibly  related  to  study  treatment.  In  relation  to  dose  modifications  (interruptions 
and dose reductions), no differences were reported between osimertinib arm and SoC arm (38.7% vs. 
38.6%), however, modifications due to AEs were lower in the osimertinib arm than in SoC arm (25.4% 
vs. 32.1%).  
Overall,  safety  profile  and  tolerability  of  osimertinib  in  FLAURA  study  seems  similar  to  that  reported 
from previous studies. No new signals have been identified.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall  the  safety  profile  of  osimertinib  in  first  line  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  with  EGFR 
mutations  (exon  19  deletions  or  exon  21  substitution)  is  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  in 
patients with the T790M mutation. No new safety signals have been identified in the FLAURA study. 
Cardiac effects, QT prolongation, cardiac failure and cardiomyopathy seem to be reported at a higher 
frequency  in  FLAURA  compared  to  the  pooled  population,  both  regarding  total  number  and  numbers 
with  grade  3-4.  Cardiac  and  haematological  effects  associated  with  a  decrease  in  counts  of  platelets, 
leucocytes,  neutrophils  and  lymphocytes  are  consistently  reported  at  higher  frequencies  in  the 
osimertinib arm compared to the gefitinib or erlotinib arm. The majority of these effects were of lower 
grade and manageable with few SAEs.  
AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  treatment  and  AEs  of  CTCAE  grade  3  or  higher  causally  related  to 
treatment were reported in a lower proportion of patients in the osimertinib arm than in the SoC arm.  
The proportion of SAEs  were similar between treatment arms. The totality of the safety data indicate 
that osimertinib was at least as well tolerated as the SoC comparator. 
The present data confirms that osimertinib is well tolerated considering the disease being treated.

•  Use in very elderly patients (≥75 years old) 
No  new  safety  concerns  were  identified  as  a  result  of  this  extension  of  indication,  but  some  of  the 
existing safety concerns were deleted based on: 
-  the  results  of    the  FLAURA  and  the  re-evaluation  of  the  overall  safety  profile  of  osimertinib  (using 
updated pooled datasets comprising integrated safety data from cross-programme osimertinib Phase I 
to III studies).  
- the revised GVP module V guideline and RMP template (rev.2) 
The important identified risk “QT prolongation”, while also observed in the Flaura study, was removed 
from  the list  because there  was  no  evidence  to  suggest that  the  effects of  osimertinib on  QT  interval 
leads to any undesirable clinical outcomes. Extensive information on risk of QT prolongations will still 
be provided in the product information.

Routine risk minimisation activities remain sufficient to manage the safety concerns of osimertinib also 
in this indication.  
This section was updated in line with the amendments proposed for the safety specification, and was 
also brought in line with the new RMP template. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to increased risk of developing adverse events 
of Grade 3 or higher in patients > 65 years and <50 kg has been added to the product information. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and 
do not require user consultation with target patient groups.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication of osimertinib is for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC whose tumours have EGFR exon 19 deletions (Ex19del) or substitution of a leucine 
with an arginine at position 858 in exon 21 (L858R) mutations. 
Lung cancer is the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer in the EU, but remains the leading cause of 
cancer related deaths. Despite progress in early detection and treatment, in 70% to 80% of patients, 
NSCLC is diagnosed at a locally advanced or metastatic stage, when it is no longer amenable to 
curative surgery or chemoradiation (Besse et al 2014).  
Recent advances in the knowledge of tumour-specific genomic abnormalities have enabled the 
identification of specific molecular targets for NSCLC treatment in the current clinical practice (Keedy et 
al 2011, Leighl et al 2014, NCCN 2017, Novello et al 2016, Travis et al 2011). Several biomarkers have 
shown to be predictive of therapeutic efficacy of molecularly targeted agents and immune-oncology 
agents, including the presence of sensitising EGFR mutations. 
Sensitising mutations in the EGF-receptor are found in 10% of patients with lung cancer in the 
European Economic Area and 30% to 50% of patients with lung cancer in Asia. In addition to the 
higher prevalence of EGFR mutations in Asian patients, overall, EGFR mutations have been found to be 
more frequent in patients with the adenocarcinoma histological subtype and in women. Smoking is the 
main cause of lung cancer in general, but is not a risk factor for developing activating mutations in the 
EGF-receptor, in fact the incidence seems higher in never-smokers than in smokers. 
In summary, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations is an incurable 
condition with poor prognosis. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Epidermal growth factor receptor- TKIs such as such as gefitinib (Iressa), erlotinib (Tarceva), afatinib 
(Giotrif) are the current standard of care as first-line therapy for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Such 
treatments result in improved response rate (RR) and progression free survival (PFS), better 
tolerability and superior quality of life (QoL) compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in the first 
line setting, as demonstrated in several randomised trials. 
Although most tumours initially respond well systemically to the currently approved EGFR TKIs in first-
line setting, the vast majority of patients develop TKI resistance with a median PFS of 9 to 13 months. 
In approximately 50% to 65% of the patients the resistance is due to the development of a second-
site EGFR-TKI resistance-conferring 'gatekeeper' point mutation, T790M leading to treatment failure 
and disease progression. 
Limited data are available on the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs against CNS metastases in first-line setting, 
given that CNS metastases have been a typical exclusion criterion in historical studies involving these 
agents. A selection of trials studying the activity of EGFR-TKIs in patients with NSCLC harbouring EGFR 
mutations and CNS metastases report response rates of 70-85%, but these trials were of limited 
quality. 
Assessment report  
EMA/396618/2018 
Page 127/131 
 
  
 
Despite the progress in treating lung cancer patients with activating mutations in the EGF-receptor, the 
prognosis of patients with this indication is still poor, demonstrating the need for improved treatment 
in these patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
To support the application, the MAH submitted efficacy data from one single clinical study. FLAURA is a 
Phase III, double-blind, randomised study (1:1 ratio) designed to compare the efficacy of osimertinib 
vs. SoC (either gefinitib or erlotinib) as first-line treatment in patients with locally-advanced or 
metastatic EGFRm NSCLC. 
Stratification factors included EGFR mutation status (Ex19del or L858R) ethnicity (Asian/Non-Asian). 
The primary efficacy endpoint of FLAURA was PFS based on investigator assessment (RECIST v1.1). 
OS, ORR, DoR, QoL and post progression outcomes (PFS2) were included as secondary endpoints. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At the time of the primary analysis for PFS (per investigator assessment; 48.7% of events in the 
osimertinib arm and 74.4% in SoC arm) a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement 
was shown for osimertinib compared to the SoC arm (HR: 0.46 [95% CI: 37, 0.575]; p-value: 
<0.0001). Treatment with osimertinib resulted in a 8.7-month improvement in median PFS compared 
to SoC. 
PFS results according to BICR on the FAS are consistent with main analysis. Different sensitivity 
analyses also support robustness of results. Subgroup analyses for PFS showed consistent results in all 
subgroups analysed.  
Regarding OS, a HR of 0.63 (CI 95% 0.45, 0.88) that did not reach the pre-specified threshold for 
statistical significance at this interim analysis was observed. Superior rates at different time points 
consistently favoured osimertinib arm (OS rates at 12 months: 89.1% vs. 82.5%; 18 months: 82.8% 
vs. 70.9%). 
A numerical trend favouring osimertinib was observed for ORR (79.9% (95% CI: 74.7, 84.5) in the 
osimertinib arm and 75.8% (95% CI: 70.3, 80.7) in the SoC arm). Responses were twice longer in the 
osimertinib arm than in SoC (median 17.2 months vs. 8.5 months). 
CNS efficacy by RECIST v1.1 in FLAURA demonstrated an improvement in CNS PFS HR: 0.48 (95% CI: 
0.26, 0.86). An ORR of 65.6% (95% CI: 52.3, 77.3) was documented in the osimertinib arm vs. 
43.3% (95% CI: 31.2, 56.0) in the SoC arm in the subset of patients with brain metastasis.  
The median PFS2 on subsequent treatment was not reached in the osimertinib arm, with a lower limit 
of the 95% CI of 23.7 months, and was 20.0 months (95% CI: 18.2, NR) in the SoC arm. A HR of 0.58 
(95% CI: 0.44, 0.78; p-value = 0.0004), was observed. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Os data submitted were immature. Final OS data will be submitted together with other relevant 
endpoints such as TFST and TSST when available.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Generally, the safety profile of osimertinib appears similar to that of the SoC (erlotinib and gefitinib). 
Overall incidence of AEs was 97.8% in both treatment arms, with most of the AEs being considered by 
the Investigator to be possibly related to study treatment.  
The most commonly reported PTs in the osimertinib arm (≥ 20%) were diarrhoea (57.7% vs. 57.4%, 
osimertinib and SoC respectively), dry skin (31.5 vs. 32.5%), paronychia (29.0% vs. 28.9%), 
stomatitis (28.7% vs. 20.2%), dermatitis acneiform (25.4% vs. 48.4%) and decreased appetite 
(20.1% vs. 18.8%). Other PTs more frequent in the osimertinib arm were: ECG QT prolonged (10.0% 
vs. 4.0%), pyrexia (10.0% vs. 4.0%) and dyspnoea (12.5% vs. 7.2%).  
The most frequently reported AEs of CTCAE ≥ grade 3 considered to be possibly related to osimertinib 
were diarrhoea (2.2%), decreased apetite and ECG QT prolonged (1.8% each), ILD and GGT increased 
(1.1% each), asthenia, fatigue, AST increased, ejection fraction decreased, neutrophil count decreased 
and platelet count decreased (0.7% each).  
ILD grouped term (ILD and pneumonitis) in the osimertinib was 3.9%, AEs grade 3 was 1.1%.   
Adverse events in the overall cardiac effect grouped term (QT) were reported in 10.4% of patients.  
Incidence of Skin Effects grouped term was 74.2% of patients.  
The incidence of AEs in the Upper gastrointestinal tract inflammatory events was 41.2% of patients. 
Stomatitis was the most frequent PT in the osimertinib arm (28.7%).  
The incidence of SAEs was 21.5% with osimertinib. The most frequently reported SAEs (≥ 1%) were 
pneumonia (7 [2.5%] patients), ILD and pulmonary embolism (4 [1.4%] each), and pleural effusion (3 
[1.1%]). 
The majority of deaths in the osimertinib arm were considered to be related to the disease under 
investigation. None of deaths in the osimertinib arm were considered to be possibly related to study 
treatment. 
Safety profile in males and females was overall similar, although AEs ≥ grade 3 was higher in females 
than in males. A higher incidence of ECG QT prolonged was also reported in female patients (3.0% vs. 
14%). Incidence of AEs causally related to osimertinib was higher in Asian patients than in White 
patients as well as AE of CTCAE ≥  grade 3. Moreover, a higher incidence of ECG QT prolonged (3.0% 
vs. 14.4%) and dermatitis acneiform (17.8% vs. 29.3%) was also reported in Asian patients than in 
White patients. In patients ≥  75 years incidence of AE of CTCAE ≥  grade 3, SAEs and SAEs possibly 
related to osimertinib was higher.  
Discontinuation of study treatment due to AEs was 13.3% in the osimertinib arm, and 9.7% were 
considered to be possibly related to study treatment. AEs leading to dose interruption were 25.1%, 
AEs leading to dose reduction were 3.9%. No new signals have been identified. 
Patients aged >65 years and/or low body weight (<50 kg) are at increased risk of developing adverse 
events of Grade 3 or higher.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
No additional key uncertainties and limitations have been identified.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The use of EGFR TKIs in patients with activating (sensitising) EGFR mutations NSCLC, have improved 
the clinical outcomes of these patients, with higher antitumor activity, greater delay in the tumour 
progression and better quality of life as compared to traditional platinum based chemotherapy. TKIs of 
first or second generation have been considered the SoC in this patient population. 
Osimertinib has now proven to prolong PFS in a clinically relevant manner when compared to SoC, 
erlotinib or gefitinib, which could likely translate into longer OS for patients (as pointed out by 
preliminary data). The efficacy was observed regardless of CNS metastases, and across other sub-
groups. The better clinical outcomes could be a new milestone in the SoC, moving the first choice in 
the current treatment armamentarium. The uncertainties related to the FLAURA study, lack of mature 
OS data, do not overcome the benefits associated to this therapy as a clear effect is evident from the 
preliminary data.  
Generally, the safety profile of osimertinib appears similar to that of the SoC (erlotinib and gefitinib). 
Overall the safety profile of osimertinib in first line locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR 
mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 substitution) is consistent with the known safety profile in the 
currently authorised indication, in patient harbouring the T790M mutation. No new signals have been 
identified. Additionally, safety profile and tolerability of osimertinib appear similar to other TKIs 
(erlotinib and gefitinib), with a lower incidence of severe (CTCAE ≥ grade 3) AEs reported with 
osimertinib. 
Although only patients with Ex19del or L858R mutations were included in the FLAURA study, the 
available preclinical data and limited clinical data support a broad indication regardless of the type of 
activating EGFR mutations.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Results from FLAURA trial are considered to demonstrate a clinically relevant and significant advantage 
over the current SoC as first-line treatment of patients with EGFR+ NSCLC whereas the safety profile 
remains in line with what has been previously described.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Tagrisso as first-line therapy in EGFR mutation-positive patients with metastatic or 
locally advanced NSCLC is considered to be positive. 
4.  Recommendations

Extension of Indication to include (as monotherapy) first-line treatment of adult patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with activating epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) mutations, based on data from the FLAURA study (D5160C00007): a phase III, double-blind, 
randomised study to assess the efficacy and safety of AZD9291 versus a standard of care epidermal 
growth factor receptor-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor as first-line treatment in patients with epidermal 
growth factor receptor mutation-positive, locally-advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer; as 
a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package 
Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Further, sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC have been updated 
with a new warning with regard to increased risk of developing adverse events of Grade 3 or higher in 
patients > 65 years and <50 kg. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update sections 2 and 
4.4 of the SmPC with information regarding the excipient sodium, and to implement editorial changes 
in the SmPC and Package Leaflet. An updated RMP version 10.0 was agreed during the procedure. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Tractocile is indicated to delay imminent pre-term birth in pregnant adult women with: 
− 
− 
− 
− 
regular uterine contractions of at least 30 seconds duration at a rate of ≥ 4 per 30 minutes 
a cervical dilation of 1 to 3 cm (0-3 for nulliparas) and effacement of ≥ 50% 
a gestational age from 24 until 33 completed weeks 
a normal foetal heart rate 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Treatment with Tractocile should be initiated and maintained by a physician experienced in the treatment of 
pre-term labour. 
Tractocile is administered intravenously in three successive stages: an initial bolus dose (6.75 mg), 
performed with Tractocile 6.75 mg/0.9 ml solution for injection, immediately followed by a continuous high 
dose infusion (loading infusion 300 micrograms/min) of Tractocile 37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion during three hours, followed by a lower dose of Tractocile 37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion (subsequent infusion 100 micrograms/min) up to 45 hours. The duration of the treatment should not 
exceed 48 hours. The total dose given during a full course of Tractocile therapy should preferably not exceed 
330.75 mg of atosiban. 
Intravenous therapy using the initial bolus injection should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis of 
pre-term labour. Once the bolus has been injected, proceed with the infusion (See Summary of Product 
Characteristics of Tractocile 37.5 mg/5 ml, concentrate for solution for infusion). In the case of persistence 
of uterine contractions during treatment with Tractocile, alternative therapy should be considered. 
The following table shows the full posology of the bolus injection followed by the infusion:

Re-treatment: 
In case a re-treatment with atosiban is needed, it should also commence with a bolus injection of Tractocile 
6.75 mg/0.9 ml, solution for injection followed by infusion with Tractocile 37.5 mg/5 ml, concentrate for 
solution for infusion. 
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
There is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or kidneys. 
Renal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of atosiban is excreted 
in the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used with caution. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Tractocile in pregnant women aged less than 18 years have not been established.  
No data are available. 
Method of administration  
For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Tractocile must not be used in the following conditions: 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
Gestational age below 24 or over 33 completed weeks 
Premature rupture of the membranes >30 weeks of gestation 
Abnormal foetal heart rate 
Antepartum uterine haemorrhage requiring immediate delivery 
Eclampsia and severe pre-eclampsia requiring delivery 
Intrauterine foetal death 
Suspected intrauterine infection 
Placenta praevia 
Abruptio placenta 
Any other conditions of the mother or foetus, in which continuation of pregnancy is hazardous 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
When atosiban is used in patients in whom premature rupture of membranes cannot be excluded, the benefits 
of delaying delivery should be balanced against the potential risk of chorioamnionitis. 
There is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or kidneys. 
Renal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of atosiban is excreted 
in the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used with caution (see sections 
4.2 and 5.2). 
There is only limited clinical experience in the use of atosiban in multiple pregnancies or the gestational age 
group between 24 and 27 weeks, because of the small number of patients treated. The benefit of atosiban in 
these subgroups is therefore uncertain. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Re-treatment with Tractocile is possible, but there is only limited clinical experience available with multiple 
re-treatments, up to 3 re-treatments (see section 4.2). 
In case of intrauterine growth retardation, the decision to continue or reinitiate the administration of 
Tractocile depends on the assessment of fetal maturity. 
Monitoring of uterine contractions and fetal heart rate during administration of atosiban and in case of 
persistent uterine contractions should be considered. 
As an antagonist of oxytocin, atosiban may theoretically facilitate uterine relaxation and postpartum bleeding 
therefore blood loss after delivery should be monitored. However, inadequate uterus contraction postpartum 
was not observed during the clinical trials. 
Multiple pregnancy and medicinal products with tocolytic activity like calcium channel blockers and beta-
mimetics are known to be associated with increased risk of pulmonary oedema. Therefore, atosiban should 
be used with caution in case of multiple pregnancy and/or concomitant administration of other medicinal 
products with tocolytic activity (see section 4.8). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
It is unlikely that atosiban is involved in cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug interactions as in vitro 
investigations have shown that atosiban is not a substrate for the cytochrome P450 system, and does not 
inhibit the drug metabolising cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
Interaction studies have been performed with labetalol and betamethasone in healthy, female 
volunteers. No clinically relevant interaction was found between atosiban and bethamethasone or labetalol. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Atosiban should only be used when pre-term labour has been diagnosed between 24 and 33 completed weeks 
of gestation. If during pregnancy the woman is already breast-feeding an earlier child, then breast-feeding 
should be discontinued during treatment with Tractocile, since the release of oxytocin during breast-feeding 
may augment uterine contractility, and may counteract the effect of tocolytic therapy. 
In atosiban clinical trials no effects were observed on breast-feeding. Small amounts of atosiban have been 
shown to pass from plasma into the breast milk of breast-feeding women. 
Embryo-fetal toxicity studies have not shown toxic effects of atosiban. No studies were performed that 
covered fertility and early embryonic development (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Not relevant. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Possible adverse reactions of atosiban were described for the mother during the use of atosiban in clinical 
trials. In total 48% of the patients treated with atosiban experienced adverse reactions during the clinical 
trials. The observed adverse reactions were generally of a mild severity. The most commonly reported 
adverse reaction in the mother is nausea (14 %).  
For the newborn, the clinical trials did not reveal any specific adverse reactions of atosiban. The infant 
adverse reactions were in the range of normal variation and were comparable with both placebo and beta-
mimetic group incidences. 
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: Very common 
(≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

mimetics, and/or in women with multiple pregnancy, have been reported post-marketing. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Few cases of atosiban overdosing were reported, they occurred without any specific signs or symptoms. 
There is no known specific treatment in case of an overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other gynecologicals, ATC code: G02CX01 
Tractocile contains atosiban (INN), a synthetic peptide ([Mpa1,D-Tyr(Et)2,Thr4,Orn8]-oxytocin) which is a 
competitive antagonist of human oxytocin at receptor level. In rats and guinea pigs, atosiban was shown to 
bind to oxytocin receptors, to decrease the frequency of contractions and the tone of the uterine musculature, 
resulting in a suppression of uterine contractions. Atosiban was also shown to bind to the vasopressin 
receptor, thus inhibiting the effect of vasopressin. In animals atosiban did not exhibit cardiovascular effects. 
In human pre-term labour, atosiban at the recommended dosage antagonises uterine contractions and induces 
uterine quiescence. The onset of uterus relaxation following atosiban is rapid, uterine contractions being 
significantly reduced within 10 minutes to achieve stable uterine quiescence (≤ 4 contractions/hour) for 
12 hours.

Phase III clinical trials (CAP-001 studies) include data from 742 women who were diagnosed with pre-term 
labour at 23–33 weeks of gestation and were randomised to receive either atosiban (according to this 
labelling) or β-agonist (dose-titrated). 
Primary endpoint: the primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of women remaining undelivered and 
not requiring alternative tocolysis within 7 days of treatment initiation. The data show that 59.6% (n=201) 
and 47.7% (n=163) of atosiban- and β-agonist-treated women (p=0.0004), respectively, were undelivered 
and did not require alternative tocolysis within 7 days of starting treatment. Most of the treatment failures in 
CAP-001 were caused by poor tolerability. Treatment failures caused by insufficient efficacy were 
significantly (p=0.0003) more frequent in atosiban (n=48, 14.2%) than in the β-agonist-treated women 
(n=20, 5.8%). 
In the CAP-001 studies the probability of remaining undelivered and not requiring alternative tocolytics 
within 7 days of treatment initiation was similar for atosiban and beta-mimetics treated women at gestational 
age of 24-28 weeks. However, this finding is based on a very small sample (n=129 patients). 
Secondary endpoints: secondary efficacy parameters included the proportion of women remaining 
undelivered within 48 h of treatment initiation. There was no difference between the atosiban and beta-
mimetic groups with regard to this parameter. 
Mean (SD) gestational age at delivery was the same in the two groups: 35.6 (3.9) and 35.3 (4.2) weeks for 
the atosiban and β-agonist groups, respectively (p=0.37). Admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) 
was similar for both treatment groups (approximately 30%), as was length of stay and ventilation therapy. 
Mean (SD) birth weight was 2491 (813) grams in the atosiban group and 2461 (831) grams in the β-agonist 
group (p=0.58). 
Fetal and maternal outcome did apparently not differ between the atosiban and the β-agonist group, but the 
clinical studies were not powered enough to rule out a possible difference. 
Of the 361 women who received atosiban treatment in the phase III studies, 73 received at least one re-
treatment, 8 received at least 2 re-treatments and 2 received 3 re-treatments (see section 4.4). 
As the safety and efficacy of atosiban in women with a gestational age of less than 24 completed weeks has 
not been established in controlled randomised studies, the treatment of this patient group with atosiban is not 
recommended (see section 4.3). 
In a placebo-controlled study, fetal/infant deaths were 5/295 (1.7%) in the placebo group and 15/288 (5.2%) 
in the atosiban group, of which two occurred at five and eight months of age. Eleven out of the 15 deaths in 
the atosiban group occurred in pregnancies with a gestational age of 20 to 24 weeks, although in this 
subgroup patient distribution was unequal (19 women on atosiban, 4 on placebo). For women with a 
gestational age greater than 24 weeks there was no difference in mortality rate (1.7% in the placebo group 
and 1.5% in the atosiban group). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In healthy non-pregnant subjects receiving atosiban infusions (10 to 300 micrograms/min over 12 hours), the 
steady state plasma concentrations increased proportionally to the dose. 
The clearance, volume of distribution and half-life were found to be independent of the dose. 
In women in pre-term labour receiving atosiban by infusion (300 micrograms/min for 6 to 12 hours), steady 
state plasma concentrations were reached within one hour following the start of the infusion (mean 442 
± 73 ng/ml, range 298 to 533 ng/ml). 
Following completion of the infusion, plasma concentration rapidly declined with an initial (tα) and terminal 
(tβ) half-life of 0.21 ± 0.01 and 1.7 ± 0.3 hours, respectively. Mean value for clearance was 41.8 
± 8.2 litres/h. Mean value of volume of distribution was 18.3 ± 6.8 litres. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Plasma protein binding of atosiban is 46 to 48% in pregnant women. It is not known whether the free 
fraction in the maternal and fetal compartments differs substantially. Atosiban does not partition into red 
blood cells. 
Atosiban passes the placenta. Following an infusion of 300 micrograms/min in healthy pregnant women at 
term, the fetal/maternal atosiban concentration ratio was 0.12. 
Two metabolites were identified in the plasma and urine from human subjects. The ratios of the main 
metabolite M1 (des-(Orn8, Gly-NH2
9)-[Mpa1, D-Tyr(Et)2, Thr4]-oxytocin) to atosiban concentrations in 
plasma were 1.4 and 2.8 at the second hour and at the end of the infusion respectively. It is not known 
whether M1 accumulates in tissues. Atosiban is found in only small quantities in urine, its urinary 
concentration is about 50 times lower than that of M1. The proportion of atosiban eliminated in faeces is not 
known. The main metabolite M1 is approximately 10 times less potent than atosiban in inhibiting oxytocin-
induced uterine contractions in vitro. Metabolite M1 is excreted in milk (see section 4.6). 
There is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or kidneys. 
Renal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of atosiban is excreted 
in the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used with caution (see sections 
4.2 and 4.4). 
It is unlikely that atosiban inhibits hepatic cytochrome P450 isoforms in humans (see section 4.5). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No systemic toxic effects were observed during the two-week intravenous toxicity studies (in rats and dogs) 
at doses which are approximately 10 times higher than the human therapeutic dose, and during the three-
months toxicity studies in rats and dogs (up to 20 mg/kg/day s.c.). The highest atosiban subcutaneous dose 
not producing any adverse effects was approximately two times the therapeutic human dose. 
No studies were performed that covered fertility and early embryonic development. Reproduction toxicity 
studies, with dosing from implantation up to late stage pregnancy, showed no effects on mothers and fetuses. 
The exposure of the rat fetus was approximately four times that received by the human fetus during 
intravenous infusions in women. Animal studies have shown inhibition of lactation as expected from the 
inhibition of action of oxytocin. 
Atosiban was neither oncogenic nor mutagenic in in vitro and in vivo tests.

4.2 and 5.2). 
There is only limited clinical experience in the use of atosiban in multiple pregnancies or the gestational age 
group between 24 and 27 weeks, because of the small number of patients treated. The benefit of atosiban in 
these subgroups is therefore uncertain.

Re-treatment with Tractocile is possible, but there is only limited clinical experience available with multiple 
re-treatments, up to 3 re-treatments (see section 4.2). 
In case of intrauterine growth retardation, the decision to continue or reinitiate the administration of 
Tractocile depends on the assessment of fetal maturity. 
Monitoring of uterine contractions and fetal heart rate during administration of atosiban and in case of 
persistent uterine contractions should be considered. 
As an antagonist of oxytocin, atosiban may theoretically facilitate uterine relaxation and postpartum bleeding 
therefore blood loss after delivery should be monitored. However, inadequate uterus contraction postpartum 
was not observed during the clinical trials. 
Multiple pregnancy and medicinal products with tocolytic activity like calcium channel blockers and beta-
mimetics are known to be associated with increased risk of pulmonary oedema. Therefore, atosiban should 
be used with caution in case of multiple pregnancy and/or concomitant administration of other medicinal 
products with tocolytic activity (see section 4.8). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
It is unlikely that atosiban is involved in cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug interactions as in vitro 
investigations have shown that atosiban is not a substrate for the cytochrome P450 system, and does not 
inhibit the drug metabolising cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
Interaction studies have been performed with labetalol and betamethasone in healthy, female 
volunteers. No clinically relevant interaction was found between atosiban and bethamethasone or labetalol. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Atosiban should only be used when pre-term labour has been diagnosed between 24 and 33 completed weeks 
of gestation. If during pregnancy the woman is already breast-feeding an earlier child, then breast-feeding 
should be discontinued during treatment with Tractocile, since the release of oxytocin during breast-feeding 
may augment uterine contractility, and may counteract the effect of tocolytic therapy. 
In atosiban clinical trials no effects were observed on breast-feeding. Small amounts of atosiban have been 
shown to pass from plasma into the breast milk of breast-feeding women. 
Embryo-fetal toxicity studies have not shown toxic effects of atosiban. No studies were performed that 
covered fertility and early embryonic development (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Not relevant. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Possible adverse reactions of atosiban were described for the mother during the use of atosiban in clinical 
trials. In total 48% of the patients treated with atosiban experienced adverse reactions during the clinical

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other gynecologicals, ATC code: G02CX01 
Tractocile contains atosiban (INN), a synthetic peptide ([Mpa1,D-Tyr(Et)2,Thr4,Orn8]-oxytocin) which is a 
competitive antagonist of human oxytocin at receptor level. In rats and guinea pigs, atosiban was shown to 
bind to oxytocin receptors, to decrease the frequency of contractions and the tone of the uterine musculature, 
resulting in a suppression of uterine contractions. Atosiban was also shown to bind to the vasopressin 
receptor, thus inhibiting the effect of vasopressin. In animals atosiban did not exhibit cardiovascular effects. 
In human pre-term labour, atosiban at the recommended dosage antagonises uterine contractions and induces 
uterine quiescence. The onset of uterus relaxation following atosiban is rapid, uterine contractions being

significantly reduced within 10 minutes to achieve stable uterine quiescence (≤ 4 contractions/hour) for 
12 hours. 
Phase III clinical trials (CAP-001 studies) include data from 742 women who were diagnosed with pre-term 
labour at 23–33 weeks of gestation and were randomised to receive either atosiban (according to this 
labelling) or β-agonist (dose-titrated). 
Primary endpoint: the primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of women remaining undelivered and 
not requiring alternative tocolysis within 7 days of treatment initiation. The data show that 59.6% (n=201) 
and 47.7% (n=163) of atosiban- and β-agonist-treated women (p=0.0004), respectively, were undelivered 
and did not require alternative tocolysis within 7 days of starting treatment. Most of the treatment failures in 
CAP-001 were caused by poor tolerability. Treatment failures caused by insufficient efficacy were 
significantly (p=0.0003) more frequent in atosiban (n=48, 14.2%) than in the β-agonist-treated women 
(n=20, 5.8%). 
In the CAP-001 studies the probability of remaining undelivered and not requiring alternative tocolytics 
within 7 days of treatment initiation was similar for atosiban and beta-mimetics treated women at gestational 
age of 24-28 weeks. However, this finding is based on a very small sample (n=129 patients). 
Secondary endpoints: secondary efficacy parameters included the proportion of women remaining 
undelivered within 48 h of treatment initiation. There was no difference between the atosiban and beta-
mimetic groups with regard to this parameter. 
Mean (SD) gestational age at delivery was the same in the two groups: 35.6 (3.9) and 35.3 (4.2) weeks for 
the atosiban and β-agonist groups, respectively (p=0.37). Admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) 
was similar for both treatment groups (approximately 30%), as was length of stay and ventilation therapy. 
Mean (SD) birth weight was 2491 (813) grams in the atosiban group and 2461 (831) grams in the β-agonist 
group (p=0.58). 
Fetal and maternal outcome did apparently not differ between the atosiban and the β-agonist group, but the 
clinical studies were not powered enough to rule out a possible difference. 
Of the 361 women who received atosiban treatment in the phase III studies, 73 received at least one re-
treatment, 8 received at least 2 re-treatments and 2 received 3 re-treatments (see section 4.4). 
As the safety and efficacy of atosiban in women with a gestational age of less than 24 completed weeks has 
not been established in controlled randomised studies, the treatment of this patient group with atosiban is not 
recommended (see section 4.3). 
In a placebo-controlled study, fetal/infant deaths were 5/295 (1.7%) in the placebo group and 15/288 (5.2%) 
in the atosiban group, of which two occurred at five and eight months of age. Eleven out of the 15 deaths in 
the atosiban group occurred in pregnancies with a gestational age of 20 to 24 weeks, although in this 
subgroup patient distribution was unequal (19 women on atosiban, 4 on placebo). For women with a 
gestational age greater than 24 weeks there was no difference in mortality rate (1.7% in the placebo group 
and 1.5% in the atosiban group). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In healthy non-pregnant subjects receiving atosiban infusions (10 to 300 micrograms/min over 12 hours), the 
steady state plasma concentrations increased proportionally to the dose. 
The clearance, volume of distribution and half-life were found to be independent of the dose. 
In women in pre-term labour receiving atosiban by infusion (300 micrograms/min for 6 to 12 hours), steady 
state plasma concentrations were reached within one hour following the start of the infusion (mean 442 
± 73 ng/ml, range 298 to 533 ng/ml). 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following completion of the infusion, plasma concentration rapidly declined with an initial (tα) and terminal 
(tβ) half-life of 0.21 ± 0.01 and 1.7 ± 0.3 hours, respectively. Mean value for clearance was 41.8 
± 8.2 litres/h. Mean value of volume of distribution was 18.3 ± 6.8 litres. 
Plasma protein binding of atosiban is 46 to 48% in pregnant women. It is not known whether the free 
fraction in the maternal and fetal compartments differs substantially. Atosiban does not partition into red 
blood cells. 
Atosiban passes the placenta. Following an infusion of 300 micrograms/min in healthy pregnant women at 
term, the fetal/maternal atosiban concentration ratio was 0.12. 
Two metabolites were identified in the plasma and urine from human subjects. The ratios of the main 
metabolite M1 (des-(Orn8, Gly-NH2
9)-[Mpa1, D-Tyr(Et)2, Thr4]-oxytocin) to atosiban concentrations in 
plasma were 1.4 and 2.8 at the second hour and at the end of the infusion respectively. It is not known 
whether M1 accumulates in tissues. Atosiban is found in only small quantities in urine, its urinary 
concentration is about 50 times lower than that of M1. The proportion of atosiban eliminated in faeces is not 
known. The main metabolite M1 is approximately 10 times less potent than atosiban in inhibiting oxytocin-
induced uterine contractions in vitro. Metabolite M1 is excreted in milk (see section 4.6). 
There is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or kidneys. 
Renal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of atosiban is excreted 
in the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used with caution (see sections 
4.2 and 4.4). 
It is unlikely that atosiban inhibits hepatic cytochrome P450 isoforms in humans (see section 4.5). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No systemic toxic effects were observed during the two-week intravenous toxicity studies (in rats and dogs) 
at doses which are approximately 10 times higher than the human therapeutic dose, and during the three-
months toxicity studies in rats and dogs (up to 20 mg/kg/day s.c.). The highest atosiban subcutaneous dose 
not producing any adverse effects was approximately two times the therapeutic human dose. 
No studies were performed that covered fertility and early embryonic development. Reproduction toxicity 
studies, with dosing from implantation up to late stage pregnancy, showed no effects on mothers and fetuses. 
The exposure of the rat fetus was approximately four times that received by the human fetus during 
intravenous infusions in women. Animal studies have shown inhibition of lactation as expected from the 
inhibition of action of oxytocin. 
Atosiban was neither oncogenic nor mutagenic in in vitro and in vivo tests.

Store in the original package in order to protect from light. 
For storage conditions after first opening and dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container  
One vial of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 5 ml solution, corresponding to 37.5 mg atosiban. 
Colourless glass vials, clear borosilicated (type I) sealed with grey siliconised bromo-butyl rubber stopper, 
type I, and flip-off cap of polypropylene and aluminium. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
The vials should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. 
Preparation of the intravenous infusion solution: 
For intravenous infusion, following the bolus dose, Tractocile 37.5 mg/5 ml, concentrate for solution for 
infusion should be diluted in one of the following solutions: 
− 
− 
− 
sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection  
Ringer's lactate solution 
5% w/v glucose solution. 
Withdraw 10 ml solution from a 100 ml infusion bag and discard. Replace it by 10 ml Tractocile 
37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion from two 5 ml vials to obtain a concentration of 75 mg 
atosiban in 100 ml. 
The reconstituted product is a clear, colourless solution without particles. 
The loading infusion is given by infusing 24 ml/hour (i.e. 18 mg/h) of the above prepared solution over the 
3 hour period under adequate medical supervision in an obstetric unit. After three hours the infusion rate is 
reduced to 8 ml/hour. 
Prepare new 100 ml bags in the same way as described to allow the infusion to be continued. 
If an infusion bag with a different volume is used, a proportional calculation should be made for the 
preparation. 
To achieve accurate dosing, a controlled infusion device is recommended to adjust the rate of flow in 
drops/min. An intravenous microdrip chamber can provide a convenient range of infusion rates within the 
recommended dose levels for Tractocile. 
If other medicinal products need to be given intravenously at the same time, the intravenous cannula can be 
shared or another site of intravenous administration can be used. This permits the continued independent 
control of the rate of infusion.

Package leaflet: Information for the user 
Tractocile 6.75 mg/0.9 ml solution for injection 
atosiban 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important 
information for you. 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, midwife or pharmacist. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tractocile is and what it is used for 
Tractocile contains atosiban. Tractocile can be used to delay the premature birth of your baby. Tractocile is 
used in pregnant adult women, from week 24 to week 33 of the pregnancy.  
Tractocile works by making the contractions in your womb (uterus) less strong. It also makes the 
contractions happen less often. It does this by blocking the effect of a natural hormone in your body called 
“oxytocin” which causes your womb (uterus) to contract. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Tractocile  
Do not use Tractocile 
- 
- 
- 
if you are less than 24 weeks pregnant. 
if you are more than 33 weeks pregnant. 
if your waters have broken (premature rupture of your membranes) and you have completed 30 weeks 
of your pregnancy or more. 
if your unborn baby (foetus) has an abnormal heart rate. 
if you have bleeding from your vagina and your doctor wants your unborn baby to be delivered 
straight away.  
if you have something called “severe pre-eclampsia” and your doctor wants your unborn baby to be 
delivered straight away. Severe pre-eclampsia is when you have very high blood pressure, fluid 
retention and/or protein in your urine. 
if you have something called “eclampsia” which is similar to “severe pre-eclampsia” but you would 
also have fits (convulsions). This will mean your unborn baby needs to be delivered straight away. 
if your unborn baby has died. 
if you have or could have an infection of your womb (uterus). 
if your placenta is covering the birth canal. 
if your placenta is detaching from the wall of your womb. 
if you or your unborn baby have any other conditions where it would be dangerous to continue with 
your pregnancy. 
if you are allergic to atosiban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Do not use Tractocile if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, midwife or 
pharmacist before you are given Tractocile. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before you are given Tractocile: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you think your waters might have broken (premature rupture of your membranes). 
if you have kidney or liver problems. 
if you are between 24 and 27 weeks pregnant. 
if you are pregnant with more than one baby. 
if your contractions start again, treatment with Tractocile can be repeated up to three more times. 
if your unborn baby is small for the time of your pregnancy. 
Your womb may be less able to contract after your baby has been born. This may cause bleeding. 
if you are pregnant with more than one baby and/or are given medicines that can delay the birth of 
your baby, such as medicines used for high blood pressure. This may increase the risk of lung oedema 
(accumulation of fluid in the lungs). 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before you 
are given Tractocile. 
Children and adolescents 
Tractocile has not been studied in pregnant women less than 18 years old. 
Other medicines and Tractocile 
Tell your doctor, midwife or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant and breast-feeding an earlier child, you should stop breast-feeding while you are given 
Tractocile. 
3. 
How Tractocile will be given 
Tractocile will be given to you in a hospital by a doctor, nurse or midwife. They will decide how much you 
need. They will also make sure the solution is clear and free from particles. 
Tractocile will be given into a vein (intravenously) in three stages: 
- 
- 
- 
The first injection of 6.75 mg in 0.9 ml will be slowly injected into your vein over one minute. 
Then a continuous infusion (drip) will be given at a dose of 18 mg per hour for 3 hours. 
Then another continuous infusion (drip) at a dose of 6 mg per hour will be given for up to 45 hours, or 
until your contractions have stopped. 
Treatment should last no longer than 48 hours in total. 
Further treatment with Tractocile can be used if your contractions start again. Treatment with Tractocile can 
be repeated up to three more times. 
During treatment with Tractocile, your contractions and your unborn baby’s heart rate may be monitored. 
It is recommended that no more than three re-treatments should be used during a pregnancy.

Package leaflet: Information for the user 
Tractocile 37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion 
atosiban 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important 
information for you. 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, midwife or pharmacist. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. 
What is in this leaflet 
1.  What Tractocile is and what it is used for  
2.  What you need to know before you are given Tractocile  
3.  How Tractocile will be given  
4.  Possible side effects  
5.  How to store Tractocile  
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tractocile is and what it is used for 
Tractocile contains atosiban. Tractocile can be used to delay the premature birth of your baby. Tractocile is 
used in pregnant adult women, from week 24 to week 33 of the pregnancy.  
Tractocile works by making the contractions in your womb (uterus) less strong. It also makes the 
contractions happen less often. It does this by blocking the effect of a natural hormone in your body called 
“oxytocin” which causes your womb (uterus) to contract. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Tractocile  
Do not use Tractocile 
- 
- 
- 
if you are less than 24 weeks pregnant. 
if you are more than 33 weeks pregnant. 
if your waters have broken (premature rupture of your membranes) and you have completed 30 weeks 
of your pregnancy or more. 
if your unborn baby (foetus) has an abnormal heart rate. 
if you have bleeding from your vagina and your doctor wants your unborn baby to be delivered 
straight away.  
if you have something called “severe pre-eclampsia” and your doctor wants your unborn baby to be 
delivered straight away. Severe pre-eclampsia is when you have very high blood pressure, fluid 
retention and/or protein in your urine. 
if you have something called “eclampsia” which is similar to “severe pre-eclampsia” but you would 
also have fits (convulsions). This will mean your unborn baby needs to be delivered straight away. 
if your unborn baby has died. 
if you have or could have an infection of your womb (uterus). 
if your placenta is covering the birth canal. 
if your placenta is detaching from the wall of your womb. 
if you or your unborn baby have any other conditions where it would be dangerous to continue with 
your pregnancy. 
if you are allergic to atosiban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Do not use Tractocile if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, midwife or 
pharmacist before you are given Tractocile. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before you are given Tractocile: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you think your waters might have broken (premature rupture of your membranes). 
if you have kidney or liver problems. 
if you are between 24 and 27 weeks pregnant. 
if you are pregnant with more than one baby. 
if your contractions start again, treatment with Tractocile can be repeated up to three more times. 
if your unborn baby is small for the time of your pregnancy. 
Your womb may be less able to contract after your baby has been born. This may cause bleeding. 
if you are pregnant with more than one baby and/or are given medicines that can delay the birth of 
your baby, such as medicines used for high blood pressure. This may increase the risk of lung oedema 
(accumulation of fluid in the lungs). 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before you 
are given Tractocile. 
Children and adolescents 
Tractocile has not been studied in pregnant women less than 18 years old. 
Other medicines and Tractocile 
Tell your doctor, midwife or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant and breast-feeding an earlier child, you should stop breast-feeding while you are given 
Tractocile. 
3. 
How Tractocile will be given 
Tractocile will be given to you in a hospital by a doctor, nurse or midwife. They will decide how much you 
need. They will also make sure the solution is clear and free from particles. 
Tractocile will be given into a vein (intravenously) in three stages: 
- 
- 
- 
The first injection of 6.75 mg in 0.9 ml will be slowly injected into your vein over one minute. 
Then a continuous infusion (drip) will be given at a dose of 18 mg per hour for 3 hours. 
Then another continuous infusion (drip) at a dose of 6 mg per hour will be given for up to 45 hours, or 
until your contractions have stopped. 
Treatment should last no longer than 48 hours in total. 
Further treatment with Tractocile can be used if your contractions start again. Treatment with Tractocile can 
be repeated up to three more times. 
During treatment with Tractocile, your contractions and your unborn baby’s heart rate may be monitored. 
It is recommended that no more than three re-treatments should be used during a pregnancy.

Instructions for use 
Before using Tractocile, the solution should be examined to ensure it is clear and free from particles. 
Tractocile is given intravenously in three successive stages: 
- 
The initial intravenous injection of 6.75 mg in 0.9 ml is slowly injected into a vein over one minute. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
A continuous infusion at a rate of 24 ml/hour is given for 3 hours. 
A continuous infusion at a rate of 8 ml/hour is given for up to 45 hours, or until the contractions of the 
uterus have subsided. 
The total duration of the treatment should be no more than 48 hours. Further treatment cycles of Tractocile 
can be used should contractions recur. It is recommended that no more than three retreatments should be 
used during a pregnancy. 
Preparation of the intravenous infusion 
The intravenous infusion is prepared by diluting Tractocile 37.5 mg/5 ml, concentrate for solution for 
infusion in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, Ringer's lactate solution or 5% w/v 
glucose solution. This is done by removing 10 ml of solution from a 100 ml infusion bag and replacing it 
with 10 ml Tractocile 37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion from two 5 ml vials to obtain a 
concentration of 75 mg atosiban in 100 ml. If an infusion bag with a different volume is used, a proportional 
calculation should be made for the preparation. 
Tractocile should not be mixed with other medicinal products in the infusion bag.

2.2 Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 17 July 2017 
designation was based on the following grounds: 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the Sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing autologous CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells expressing a CD19-specific CAR was considered justified based on clinical data 
showing that complete responses (CRs) may be achieved in patients with disease relapsed and 
refractory to the second line treatment; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to involvement of single or multiple nodal or extra nodal 
sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow and life-threatening with 5-year survival 
rates reported as low as 26% for the high risk patients; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 4.3 in 10,000 persons in the EU, at the 
time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the Sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing a CD19-specific CAR will be of 
significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The Sponsor has provided clinical data that 
demonstrate that patients who are relapsed and refractory to the second line (2L) treatment achieved 
either partial or complete responses. The overall response rate compared favourably at 3 months of 
treatment to that of the currently authorised products. The Committee considered that this constitutes 
a clinically relevant advantage.

2.3 Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of marketing 
authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The sponsor is proposing that diffuse large B-cell lymphoma continues to be an orphan condition. 
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common histologic subtype of non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (NHL) accounting for about 35% of NHL and 80% of aggressive lymphomas. 
A family history of lymphoma, autoimmune disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) seropositivity, a high body mass as a young adult and some occupational 
exposures have been identified as risk factors of DLBCL. Histologic transformation of FL to DLBCL (TFL) 
occurs in approximately 15% of patients and is generally associated with a poor clinical outcome. 
Most cases of DLBCL appear to result at least in part from the stepwise development of gene changes 
such as mutations, altered expressions, amplifications (i.e. increases in the number of copies of 
specific genes), and translocations from normal sites to other chromosomal sites. These changes often 
result in gains or losses in the production or function of the product of these genes and thereby the 
activity of cell signalling pathways that regulate the maturation, proliferation, survival, spread, evasion 
of the immune system, and other malignant behaviours of the cells in which they occur. While scores 
of genes have been reported to be altered in DLBCL many of these may not contribute to DLBCL. 
Changes in the following genes occur frequently in, and are suspected of contributing to, this disease's 
development and/or progression. 
Microscopic examinations of involved tissues reveal large neoplastic cells that are typically classified as 
B-cells based on their expression of B-cell marker proteins (e.g. CD20, CD19, CD22, CD79, PAX5, 
BOB1, OCT2, an immunoglobulin [usually IgM but occasionally IgG or IgA)], CD30, and in ~20–25% of 
cases PD-L1 or PD-L2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2 are transmembrane proteins that normally function to 
suppress attack by the immune system). These cells arrange in a diffuse pattern, efface the tissues' 
architecture, and resemble Centroblast cells (80% of cases), Immunoblast cells (8–10% of cases), or 
anaplastic cells (9% of cases; anaplastic cells have bizarre nuclei and other features that may mimic 
the Reed–Sternberg cells of Hodgkin disease or the neoplastic cells of anaplastic large cell lymphoma). 
Rarely, these neoplastic cells are characterized as having signet ring or spindle shaped nuclei, 
prominent cytoplasmic granules, multiple microvillus projections, or, when viewed by electron 
microscopy, tight junctions with other cells. These neoplastic tissue infiltrates are often accompanied 
by small non-malignant T-cell lymphocytes and histiocytes that have a reactive morphology 
The proposed therapeutic indication “Breyanzi is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell 
lymphoma (PMBCL) and follicular lymphoma grade 3B (FL3B), after two or more lines of systemic 
therapy. ” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma”  
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
Page 6/36 
 
 
 
 
 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP.  
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
At the time of initial designation and review at initial marketing authorisation, the COMP agreed that 
the condition was chronically debilitating and life-threatening.  
At the time of this review DLBCL was presented to the COMP to remain chronically debilitating and life-
threatening disease with a median survival of less than one year if left untreated. Approximately 60% 
of patients may be cured with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone 
(R-CHOP), the current standard of care. The clinical course can be debilitating due to constitutional 
symptoms, local symptoms of lymphadenopathy, end-organ damage from disease involvement, and 
bone marrow failure that may lead to infections, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia.  
The COMP concluded that the condition remains chronically debilitating and life-threatening. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has provided a prevalence estimate based on the European Cancer Information System 
(ECIS). ECIS is the reference source for European cancer estimates. This data source reports cancer 
incidence and mortality data for the 27 member states of the EU only. The ECIS definition of NHL 
includes ICD-10 (2010 version) codes C82-86, C88.4, and C96 (ECIS, 2020). According to ECIS, the 
number of incident cases of NHL in EU27 was 86,321 persons.  
Based on recent publications and using the same definition of NHL as ECIS, or one as close as possible, 
the proportion of DLBCL in European countries was: 
•  33.6% in Girona (Spain) in 1996-2015 (Solans, 2019) 
•  35.5% in Sweden in 2000-2016 (Ekberg, 2020) 
•  34.6% in France in 2010-2013 (Laurent, 2017) 
•  38.8% in the Netherlands, estimate for 2020 (Netherlands Cancer Registry) 
•  39.5% in the UK in 2010-2016 (Haematological Malignancy Research Network) 
For this range (34% to 40%), the corresponding incident cases of DLBCL in 2020 would be between 
29,349 (86,321 × 0.34) and 34,528 (86,321 × 0.40). The population estimate for EU in 2020 from 
Eurostat is 447,671,046 (Eurostat Population Statistics, 2021). Therefore, the incidence rate for the 
DLBCL population ranges from 0.66 per 10,000 (29,349 / 447,671,046) to 0.77 per 10,000 (34,528 / 
447,671,046). Note that all calculations in this section, aimed at evaluating the prevalences, have 
been rounded at the end of the process. 
The sponsor notes that DLBCL is readily curable with first-line immunochemotherapy (rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [R-CHOP]) in 50 to 70% of patients 
(Crump, 2017; Coiffier, 2016). Based on real-world data, there is also a proportion of 8% to 14% of 
patients who do not start treatment with curative intent and have a median OS of less than 3 months 
(Arboe, 2019; Harrysson, 2021). According to literature, the proportion of R/R DLBCL is approximately 
24% to 44% of the entire DLBCL population (Harrysson, 2021; Ermann, 2020; Sarkozy, 2018; Rovira, 
2015). For R/R DLBCL patients, the prognosis is dismal. The reported median overall survival after 
second-line treatment from the time of relapse is less than 1 year (Farooq, 2017; Crump, 2017; 
Filliatre-Clement, 2018; Ayers, 2020). In conclusion, at least half of the DLBCL patients are cured 5

Page 7/36 
 
 
 
 
 
years after diagnosis, and the remainder of the patients have survived for a mean duration well below 
5 years. The Sponsor concludes it is reasonable to consider the maximum mean duration of the 
disease to be 5 years. 
The sponsor notes that there is scarce recent evidence of increasing trends in incidence of DLBCL in 
Europe. Only some data for Western Europe were found. In Sweden, the incidence of DLBCL increased 
by 2.2% annually between 2000 and 2016 (Ekberg, 2020). Whereas, in France, incidence rates for 
DLBCL increased annually by 1.2% in men and decreased by 3.3% in women from 2005-2012 (Le 
Guyader-Peyrou, 2016).  
Published sources for the estimates of the prevalence of DLBCL  
In Belgium, the number of 5-year and 10-year prevalent cases alive in 2018 was reported from the 
Belgian Cancer Registry (2021): namely, 2674 five-year cases (2014-2018) and 4495 ten-year cases 
(2009-2018). Using the 2018 Belgian population (11,427,054) (Eurostats, 2021), the corresponding 5-
year and 10-year prevalence per 10,000 in 2018 is 2.34 and 3.9, respectively.   
In conclusion, the 5-year prevalence, which is considered the most appropriate to ascertain the 
prevalence of patients living with the disease, ranges from 2.34 per 10,000 persons (from the Belgian 
Cancer Registry) to 3.85 per 10,000 persons (from our calculation based on ECIS data), which is below 
the threshold of orphan disease of 5 per 10,000. 
With the uncertainties of both the duration of disease and the percentage of NHL the COMP accepted 
the prevalence estimate rounded off to 4 in 10,000.  
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
There are authorised products in the EU for the treatment of DLBCL:  
•  Rituximab (Mabthera) is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B 
cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine, prednisolone) chemotherapy.  
• 
Pixantrone (Pixuvri) is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiply 
relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas (NHL). Some chemotherapy 
agents are approved nationally in several EU countries under different trade names for the 
treatment of certain cancer types. 
•  Axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy.  
• 
• 
Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy.  
Polatuzumab vedotin (Polivy) in combination with bendamustine and rituximab is indicated for 
the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 
who are not candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplant.” 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
Page 8/36 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Tafasitamab MINJUVI is indicated in combination with lenalidomide followed by MINJUVI 
monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). 
Several medicinal products are authorised and used for the treatment of Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. 
These include cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, bendamustine, bleomycin, vincristine, vindesine, 
etoposide, iphosphamide, chlorabucil, lomustine, prednisone, and prednisolone, docetaxel, 
mitoxantrone, methotrexate, epirubicin, dexamethasone, cytarabine. 
There is an ESMO treatment guideline on DLBCL (Tillly et al, Ann Oncol (2015) 26 (suppl 5): v116-
v125) outlining the best standard of care of patients affected by the condition. The treatment 
guidelines are not updated to reflect currently authorised treatment options, i.e. tisagenlecleucel and 
axicabtagene ciloleucel or polatuzumab vedotin. 
Recently ESMO has provided additional recommendations regarding DLBCL within the context of the 
Covid 19 pandemic. They recommend that both clinical practice including CAR-T treatment (when 
indicated) as well as clinical trials should continue with special attention to prophylaxis of infections.  
Significant benefit 
The sponsor is proposing that significant benefit is based on a clinically relevant advantage. Two 
different maintenance reports were submitted one in July 2020 and a revised follow-up report in 
November 2021. Assessment involved both reports for the sake of completeness. 
Protocol Assistance was sought by the Sponsor on the proposed clinical development plan of JCAR017 
in DLBCL, PMBCL, and FL in support of significant benefit over existing therapies.  
A summary of the advice received from the COMP and how this was considered is provided below. 
For the demonstration of significant benefit based on improved efficacy through indirect comparisons, 
the COMP recommended to provide indirect comparisons of adequate methodology and encouraged the 
Sponsor to explore the possibility to use data from real world evidence (RWE) from patients that are 
treated with the currently authorised products to support significant benefit. 
With the indication targeted by the sponsor, the following products listed below are approved in 3L+ 
DLBCL: 
• 
Yescarta 
•  Kymriah 
•  Minjuvi 
• 
• 
Polivy  
Pixuvri 
•  Rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone (R-CHOP 
chemotherapy) 
•  Salvage therapies 
Indirect comparisons of efficacy and safety between JCAR017 and the approved products in 3L+ DLBCL 
were discussed to support the significant benefit of JCAR017 over currently authorised treatments.  
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
Page 9/36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Polivy’s and Minjuvi’s therapeutic indications may be regarded as broader compared to Breyanzi in 
view that they may include patients who only failed one prior line of treatment.  
The difficulty of providing indirect and unbiased comparisons versus the outcomes of studies with the 
authorised CAR-T cell products is acknowledged in view of the general challenges when performing 
indirect comparisons of results from single-arm trials. In addition, differences of the population 
characteristics and study designs are noted vis-à-vis the pivotal studies on Kymriah and Yescarta 
(enrolled conditions, proportion and type of bridging therapy; proportion of enrolled patients 
undergoing leukaphereses and being treated; time of follow-up). 
The recommendation in the Protocol assistance was to use RWE but the sponsor states that only 
limited RWE data were available from patients treated with authorised CAR-T therapies. Thus, for 
significant benefit comparison with Yescarta and Kymriah, the SmPCs and EPAR data have been 
utilised instead. 
Yescarta: 
In their submission the sponsor makes claims of improved safety with “at least comparable efficacy” 
and a major contribution to patient care.  
In their support of comparable efficacy, the sponsor provides an indirect comparison to the ZUMA-1 
study (Yescarta pivotal study) where bridging therapy between leukapheresis and lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy was not permitted. In the Breyanzi 017001 study, 59% of the included patients received 
bridging therapy before infusion of CAR-T cells.  
This leads the sponsor to compare results from Yescarta study ZUMA-1 (DLBCL subset only; 12-month 
follow-up results as described in OMAR) with a patient subset from Breyanzi study 017001 (patients 
without prior bridging therapy, to approximate the ZUMA-1 population).

mOS (months)

The sponsor did not present results in the full DLBCL population from study 017001 (including patients 
who receive bridging therapy following leukapheresis) in Table submitted. However, these results were 
presented in the Table  for the comparison against Kymriah.  
It was noted that when the ZUMA-1 DLBCL data are compared to the full DLBCL dataset from study 
017001 (including patients with bridging therapy), Breyanzi results are slightly worse in terms of ORR 
(72% vs. 84%) and CR rate (52.3% vs. 57%), and OS rates (cave: different follow-up time), and 
slightly better for mDoR (11.1m vs. 8.1m).  
The sponsor has also submitted some retrospective RWD analyses (Jain 2019, Nastoupil 2018, 
Jacobson 2018), which suggest that patients who received bridging therapy prior to Yescarta treatment 
had worse outcomes (ORR, CR, PFS, OS) compared to those who did not. 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
Page 10/36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The RWE study performed by the sponsor included only 7 Yescarta-treated patients (4 evaluable for 
efficacy: 1x CR, 3x PD) and is thus considered not appropriate for a meaningful comparison. 
To support the claim of comparable efficacy results for Breyanzi to Yescarta, the sponsor further 
provided results from a matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison (MAIC). This was performed 
based on the 017001 subset without prior bridging therapy and the ZUMA-1 population, including two 
sensitivity analyses. A report describing the methodology for the MAIC was not submitted in the 
context of the orphan maintenance assessment..  
To support improved safety as the basis for significant benefit the sponsor excluded the subset of 017001 
patients who received a bridging therapy in order to provide a more valid comparison to Yescarta. As 
highlighted by the sponsor, the presented ZUMA-1 safety data set for Yescarta includes DLBCL as well 
as PMBCL patients, whereas the 017001 data set for Breyanzi included only DLBCL patients. This leads 
to the following observations as presented by the sponsor:

bridging therapy before liso-
ZUMA-1 study) 
infusion from study 01700)

30.7% 
1% 
9.9%   
98.1%

11% 
26% 
They also report adverse events for which at least a 20% difference between Breyanzi and Yescarta was 
detected  (in  favour  of  Breyanzi).  These  included:  pyrexia,  hypotension,  tachycardia,  encephalopathy, 
febrile neutropenia, chills, hypoxia, and nausea. 
The  sponsor  puts  forward  the  observation  that  for  the total  dataset  of  017001  (including  PMBCL  and 
FL3B patients and patients who received prior bridging therapy), higher percentages of adverse events 
are reported, which were still lower than those reported for Yescarta.   
A  report  describing  the  methodology  for  the  MAIC  was  not  submitted  in  the  context  of  the  orphan 
maintenance assessment. 
Major contribution of patient care (MCPC) was claimed by a comparison regarding quality of life (QoL) 
assessment  in  the  pivotal  study.  In  this  comparison  the  sponsor  discusses  the  clinically  meaningful 
improvements in QoL of Breyanzi-treated patients based on two validated questionnaires. In Yescarta 
ZUMA-1  study,  only n=34  patients  were  assessed  for  QoL,  but  with  a  different  questionnaire.  These, 
patient also showed an improvement of QoL. However, these findings are insufficient to assume a MCPC 
over Yescarta. 
The COMP noted that regarding their claim of improved safety for DLBCL versus Yescarta, the 
relevance of the quantitative difference of the adverse events should be further discussed in view of 
the high risk of selective reporting of safety outcomes noted and the general challenges when 
performing an indirect comparison based on results from single-arm trials. The methods used for the 
MAIC should be further clarified.

Regarding significant benefit to Kymriah, the sponsor has claimed significant benefit due to a clinically 
relevant advantage which is based on improved efficacy and at least comparable safety. The sponsor 
also presents arguments in support of claiming a major contribution to patient care.  
The submitted descriptive efficacy comparison of Breyanzi to Kymriah was noted to be hampered due 
to differences in the proportion of patients with prior bridging therapy (59% in Breyanzi trial, 90% in 
Kymriah trial). Unlike for the comparison of Breyanzi vs. Yescarta (discussed above), the sponsor does 
not limit the analysis to the subpopulation of 017001 patients who received bridging therapy. The 
sponsor is asked to explain the reasons for this.  
According  to  table  11  of the  most  current maintenance  report,  Breyanzi  shows  a  better  efficacy  than 
Kymriah in terms of ORR, CR, and mOS in the 017001 study among DLBCL patients. Of note, there is 
an approximate 20% difference with respect to bridging therapy before CAR-T-cell infusion between the 
JULIET and the 017001 trial.   
In their submission, the sponsor highlights the outcomes of the high-grade lymphoma (HGL) patients 
who  were  included  in  both  trials  (Breyanzi  ORR  76%  (25/33),  Kymriah  ORR  42%  (5/12)).  They  also 
emphasised  that  patients  with  adverse  prognostic  features  were  excluded  from  JULIET  trial  (CNS 
secondary  lymphoma,  renal  impairment,  ECOG  2),  resulting  in  a  population  with  a  more  favourable 
prognosis  compared  to  Breyanzi.  They  do not,  however,  describe  how  many  of  the  analysed  patients 
received bridging therapy making this comparison likely to be biased as well.  
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
Page 12/36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Finally, a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was performed. The MAIC confirmed improved 
efficacy of Breyanzi compared to Kymriah for ORR, CR, OS. A report describing the methodology for the 
MAIC was not submitted in the context of the orphan maintenance assessment. 
The  comparison  of  safety  data  between  Study  017001  and  JULIET  demonstrates  overall  comparable 
safety of JCAR017 to Kymriah. This is supported by a detailed indirect comparison of data from Study 
017001 to published data from JULIET (without adjustment), as well as an MAIC of the two studies. The 
sponsor indicates that they believe this comparison supports comparable safety between Breyanzi and 
Kymriah.  
Major contribution to patient care is based on a comparison of QoL in 017001 study (Breyanzi) versus 
the JULIET study (Kymriah). Both showed improvements in QoL, however, different questionnaires were 
used and data are not comparable. The claim of MCPC over Kymriah in terms of QoL is therefore not 
adequately substantiated.  
In conclusion, the sponsor claims improved efficacy of Breyanzi versus Kymriah. The methods for indirect 
comparison, are not presented with sufficient details. The analysis was performed only for the full patient 
dataset, even though the proportion of patients who received prior bridging therapy differs significantly 
(which was considered a relevant aspect in the SB discussion over Yescarta). The COMP therefore invites 
the sponsor to compare only the patient subsets who received prior bridging therapy, in a similar manner 
to that described in the significant benefit discussion versus Yescarta. The methods used for the MAIC 
should be further clarified. 
Pixuvri: 
The sponsor claimed a significant benefit of Breyanzi based on improved efficacy over pixantrone. 
The patient populations were similar with respect to the type of lymphoma in the Breyanzi 017001 study 
(n=239) and the Pixuvri study PIX301 (n=70 randomised to treatment arm). However, it is noted that 
the  presented  analysis  sets  favour  Breyanzi  since  data  on  Pixuvri  includes  all  patients  randomised  to 
Pixuvri (which would be most comparable to all patients enrolled in the JCAR017 trial), whereas data for 
Breyanzi are only presented in the efficacy evaluable analysis set. This results in the following comparison 
as presented by the sponsor: 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
Page 13/36 
 
 
 
 
 
The COMP noted that data on Pixuvri patients from the RWE study NDS-NHL-001 were not included.  
The COMP however, concluded that significant benefit through an indirect comparison to Pixuvri can be 
accepted as the treatment effect differences appear large enough for a descriptive cross-trial 
comparison. 
Rituximab and other salvage therapies:  
The final comparisons made by the sponsor were to rituximab and other salvage therapies: 
R-CHOP  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  first-line  patients.  Rituximab  in  combination  with  other 
chemotherapy regimens (ICE, DHAP, GDP) is also recommended in R/R DLBCL (ESMO guideline 2015). 
The  COMP  noted  that  the  inclusion  criterion  for  Breyanzi  study  017001  was  prior  treatment  with  an 
anthracycline regimen and anti-CD20, the majority received a platinum-containing second-line therapy. 
The  responses  in  a  population  R/R  to  these  treatments  was  therefore  considered  sufficient  to 
demonstrate significant benefit. 
The sponsor also submitted an efficacy comparison to SCHOLAR-1. This was accepted as a valid external 
control for significant benefit submission in the Yescarta orphan maintenance procedure. SCHOLAR-1 is 
a large, retrospective study with results pooled from RCTs and additional clinical databases, which also 
encompasses R/R DLBCL. 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
Page 14/36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The data on salvage therapy/R-CHOP treated patients from the RWE study NDS-NHL-001 were shown 
and although outcomes were better than those described in the SCHOLAR-1 study, Breyanzi still seems 
clearly superior in terms of ORR, CR rate, DOR, and mOS. 
In  conclusion,  the  COMP  considered  that  the  basis  for  significant  benefit  had  not  been  adequately 
addressed  and  the  sponsor  was  invited  to  elaborate  further  on  several  methodological  issues  and 
inconsistencies noted in the assessment. 
2.4 COMP list of issues 
Significant Benefit 
The justification for significant benefit over authorised CAR-T cell products requires further discussion.  
The sponsor is asked to provide the results of the pivotal studies for Breyanzi and the authorised CAR-
T-cell products in a structured way and to aim at optimal comparability of analyses juxtaposed with 
respect to definitions of population and follow up time. If available, outcomes should be reported 
according to disease subtype and the same/similar timepoints (12 mo/24 mo). 
The reasoning for the matching with respect to bridging therapy are understood and further 
justification for not performing such analyses in the comparison to Kymriah with respect to efficacy 
should be provided.  
In order to justify comparable or improved efficacy the sponsor is asked to provide a table with listings 
of the following analyses of all CAR-T products (per pivotal study): 
a)  enrolled patients 
b)  treated patients (i.e. having received an infusion of CAR-T-cells)   
      c)  long-term experience with authorised products.   
With respect to the claim of an improved safety for DLBCL, the sponsor is asked to provide more detail 
on the methods used for the MAIC (e.g. clear description of adjustments made per comparison beyond 
bridging chemotherapy). The relevance of the quantitative difference of the adverse events should be 
discussed in view of the high risk of selection bias.

3.2 Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 25 May 2018. The 
designation was based on the following grounds: 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following:  
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing autologous CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells expressing a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor was considered justified based 
on preliminary clinical observations in relapsed or refractory (R/R) patients who responded to 
treatment with the proposed product; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to due to lymphadenopathy, 
splenomegaly, bone marrow dysfunction and the potential of transformation to aggressive 
lymphoma; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 3.8 in 10,000 persons in the EU, at the 
time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled.  
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the EU, the sponsor has 
provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product containing autologous 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing a CD19-specific CAR will be of significant benefit to those affected by 
the condition. The sponsor has provided preliminary clinical observations in R/R patients who had 
durable responses. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage.

3.3 Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of marketing 
authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent B cell lymphoproliferative disorder of transformed follicular 
center B cells consisting of a mixture of centrocytes (small to medium-sized cells) and centroblasts 
(large cells), mixed with non-malignant cells such as T cells, follicular dendritic cells and macrophages. 
Almost all FLs carry breaks at 18q21, with > 85% of them having a translocation involving 
chromosomes 14 and 18 (t[14;18][q32;q21]).  The t(14;18) translocation ultimately results in the 
juxtaposition of the apoptosis regulating gene B-cell lymphoma (BCL) 2 on chromosome 18 with the 
IGH transcriptional enhancer of immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on chromosome 14.  This leads to 
the constitutive overexpression of BCL-2, which blocks apoptosis and gives the cells a survival 
advantage.   
The aetiology of follicular lymphoma is still poorly understood. It has been suggested that age, gender 
and ethnicity may affect a person’s likelihood of developing follicular lymphoma. The incidence 
increases with age; although in principle follicular lymphoma may occur at any age, it is extremely rare 
in children.  
Follicular lymphoma involves lymph nodes, but also spleen, bone marrow, peripheral blood and 
Waldeyer ring. Involvement of non-haematopoietic extranodal sites, such as the gastrointestinal tract 
or soft tissue may occur in a setting of widespread nodal disease. Follicular lymphoma may 
occasionally be primary in extranodal sites, including skin, gastrointestinal tract, particularly the 
duodenum, ocular adnexa, breast and testis.  
Most patients have widespread disease at diagnosis, including peripheral and central (abdominal and 
thoracic) lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. The bone marrow is involved in 40-70% of cases. As an 
intrinsic disease characteristic, FL typically evolve over time to an aggressive subtype, in 15% of 
cases.  Disease relapse is usually rapid, where remissions become a serious challenge despite multiple 
interventions.  Eventually, patients succumb to the refractory, high-grade disease transformation and 
the complications driven by treatments. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Breyanzi is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell 
lymphoma (PMBCL) and follicular lymphoma grade 3B (FL3B), after two or more lines of systemic 
therapy.” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of follicular lymphoma”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
Page 18/36 
 
 
 
 
 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
No changes have occurred in the chronically debilitating and life-threatening nature of the condition 
since the designation. Follicular lymphoma remains life-threatening and chronically debilitating, mainly 
due to lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, bone marrow dysfunction and the potential of transformation 
into aggressive lymphoma. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has provided a current prevalence estimate which is based on the ECIS database. They 
report that the proportion of FL cases in NHL was searched from recent European population-based 
studies. Based on cancer registries, or a nationwide lymphoma registry, the proportion of incident FL 
cases (time period) was:  
•  16.23% (2000-2014) in Poland (Szumera-Ciećkiewicz, 2020) 
•  20.23% (1996-2015) Girona, Spain (Solans, 2019) 
•  14.76% (1997-2003) in Italy (Luminari, 2007) 
•  17.15% (2000-2016) in Sweden (Ekberg, 2020) 
The proportion of FL based on the French Lymphopath Network, which captured 70% of the lymphoma 
cases diagnosed in 2010 to 2013 in France (Laurent, 2017), was 17.08% (5208 FL/ 30,496 NHL). 
Another report from France was identified that provided incidence of FL; however, it was not possible 
to determine a denominator similar to the ECIS definition of NHL for the FL proportion calculation (Le 
Guyader-Peyrou, 2019). 
Based on the calculation presented by the Sponsor below, the estimated incidence rate of FL in EU27 is 
0.326 per 10,000 population (assuming a proportion of FL of 16.8% within NHL). Details of the 
calculation are presented below.   
The proportions of FL derived from Poland, Spain, Italy, Sweden, and France were extrapolated to 
vicinity countries. The geographical division of Europe in 4 geographic areas defined by ECIS was used 
(Randi, 2018) – namely:  
•  Central and Eastern Europe (C&E) 
•  Northern Europe (N)  
•  Southern Europe (S)  
•  Western Europe (W)  
The EU27 countries corresponding to each region are displayed on Table 1. 
As shown in Table 1, the proportion from Poland was extrapolated to Central and Eastern Europe, the 
proportion from Sweden was extrapolated to Northern Europe, the proportion of Spain was 
extrapolated to Portugal and that of Italy to Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Malta, and Slovenia, and the 
proportion from France was extrapolated to Western Europe.

Survival 
It has been noted that there is substantial evidence that survival has considerably increased in FL over 
the past 3 decades (Mozas, 2020; Dinnessen, 2021; Junlén, 2015). This increase is partly due to the 
uptake of rituximab in the 2000s. Although incidence of FL has stabilized in some European countries, 
prevalence is likely to increase as survival increases (Ekberg, 2020).  
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
Page 20/36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The sponsor has used 2 studies which they consider the most appropriate to use in the prevalence 
calculation, as they are population-based studies in ‘all FL’ populations diagnosed after 2000 (Junlén, 
2015; Smith, 2015). In the study of the Swedish Lymphoma Registry (Junlén, 2015), the 5-year OS 
was 74% (95% CI: 71–76%) in those diagnosed with any grade FL in 2003-2007, and 77% (95% CI: 
73–80%) in those diagnosed in 2008-2010 (Figure 1). 
Figure 1: 
Overall Survival of FL in Sweden. Kaplan–Meier graphs by Calendar Period of 
Diagnosis 
Source: Junlén, 2015 
The sponsor indicates that one may speculate based on this figure that the OS for those diagnosed in 
2003-2007 is just under 15 years and for those diagnosed in 2008-2010 may reach around 15 years. 
It is also reasonable to believe that after the advent of rituximab, which considerably increased 
survival between 2000 and 2010, no other major advances in therapy have occurred, so it is likely that 
survival has stabilized in the past decade.   
Therefore, an OS of 15 years is the most relevant estimate to use in the prevalence calculation. 
Based on the presented data originated from unselected populations of FL patients in countries with 
high-quality healthcare and using the formula [prevalence= incidence × duration of disease], one can 
speculate that the maximum median OS may currently be 15 years in the EU, which would yield a 
maximum complete prevalence of (0.326 × 15) = 4.89 per 10,000. 
The COMP accepted the final prevalence estimate of 4.89 in 10,000, rounded off to 4.9 in 10.000.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor described the treatment methods available to patients with FL based on European and 
American treatment guidelines (Dreyling et al. 2021; NCCN 2020). Several therapies are authorised 
both centrally and nationally in the EU for treatment of adult patients with FL, NHL, and lymphomas. 
These medicines include rituximab (MabThera), yttrium-90 [90Y]-radiolabelled ibritumomab tiuxetan 
(Zevalin), idelalisib (Zydelig), duvelisib (Copiktra), obinutuzumab (Gazyvaro), lenalidomide (Revlimid), 
bendamustine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, etopophos, interferon-
alpha-2a/b, prednisolone, and vincristine. Other treatment options also exist, such as radiotherapy and 
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or allogenic SCT. 
The clinical course of follicular lymphoma is characterized by recurrences requiring multiple lines of 
treatment until eventually patients run out of treatment options and develop fatal disease resistant to 
any available treatment.  
Patients with newly diagnosed FL are generally treated with an anti-CD20 antibody in monotherapy, 
rituximab (R) or obinutuzumab (G), or an anti-CD20-containing regimen (e.g., G/R-B, G/R-CHOP, and 
G/R-CVP). Available treatment options for r/r FL patients depends on the patient’s health, age, stage of 
disease, comorbidities, tumour burden, and the type and duration of response to prior therapy. The 
most recent European Society of Medical oncology (ESMO) guidelines for newly diagnosed and relapsed 
FL describe the current standard of care for these patients (Dreyling, Ann Oncol. 2021; 32(3): 298-
308). According to the guidelines, therapy should be initiated only upon the development of symptoms. 
The guideline identifies two types of FL patient populations that are offered two different treatment 
algorithms depending on their tumour burden, being either low (Figure 1) or high (Figure 2).

First-line treatment 
Induction. In the majority of patients with advanced stage III and IV disease, no curative therapy is 
yet established. Because the natural course of the disease is characterised by spontaneous regressions 
in 10%-20% of cases and varies significantly from case to case, therapy should be initiated only upon 
the development of symptoms, including B symptoms (unexplained fever >38C, drenching night 
sweats or loss of >10% body weight within 6 months), hematopoietic impairment, bulky disease, vital 
organ compression, ascites, pleural effusion or rapid lymphoma progression [I, A]. In three 
randomised trials conducted before the rituximab era, early initiation of therapy in asymptomatic 
patients did not result in any improvement in disease-specific survival or overall survival (OS) [I, D].In 
a more recent study, early initiation of rituximab resulted in improved PFS (82% versus 36% at 3 
years, P < 0.0001), but no survival benefit has been demonstrated to date,19 and the benefit of 
rituximab maintenance in this setting appears doubtful. Thus, the currently recommended therapeutic 
approach is based on clinical risk factors, symptoms and patient perspective. Four prospective first-line 
trials, two salvage trials and a systematic meta-analysis confirmed an improved overall response rate, 
PFS and OS if rituximab was added to ChT [I, A]. If complete remission and long PFS are the 
therapeutic goals, rituximab in combination with ChT such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) or bendamustine should be used [I, B]. Cyclophosphamide, 
vincristine and prednisone (CVP) is inferior to these two regimens in terms of PFS but similar in OS. If 
there is evidence (histological grade 3B or clinical signs of transformation) of more aggressive 
lymphoma, an anthracycline-based regimen (rituximab-CHOP) should be applied. Extended anti-
infectious prophylaxis should be considered, especially after bendamustine-containing induction 
therapy, as long-term CD4-positive T lymphocytopaenia has been observed [IV, B]. Awareness of a 
potential adverse impact on future cellular immunotherapeutic options, such as chimeric antigen 
receptor T-cell (CAR-T) treatment (see below), is important. In a large randomised trial, the anti-CD20 
antibody obinutuzumab (immunochemotherapy and maintenance for 2 years) resulted in significantly 
prolonged PFS in comparison with rituximab and, therefore, is considered as an additional, potentially 
more efficacious option, although no OS benefit was observed [I, B]. In another international phase III 
trial, lenalidomideerituximab appeared to have a similar efficacy as immunochemotherapy [I, C]. 
Similarly, lenalidomide + rituximab achieve a longer PFS in comparison to rituximab monotherapy. 
Antibody monotherapy (rituximab, radioimmunotherapy) or chlorambucil plus rituximab remain 
alternatives for patients with a low-risk profile or when conventional ChT is contraindicated [III, C]. 
Consolidation/maintenance. Rituximab maintenance every 2 months for 2 years improves PFS after 
various induction regimens (median PFS 10.5 years versus 4.1, P < 0.0001), but there is no impact on 
OS [I, B] whereas a shorter maintenance period results in inferior benefit. Radioimmunotherapy 
consolidation also prolongs PFS after ChT, but its benefit seems to be inferior in comparison to 
rituximab maintenance for 2 years [II, B]. However, a recent study showed an improved PFS but no 
difference in OS and an increased cumulative risk of myeloid malignancies after iodine-131 
(131I)etositumomab radioimmunotherapy consolidation in comparison to rituximab in combination 
with ChT. Myeloablative consolidation followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) 
prolongs PFS after ChT, but its benefit after a rituximab-containing induction is minor and no OS 
advantage has been observed. Therefore, such an approach is not recommended in first-line therapy of 
responding patients [I, D] 
This indication extension of Yescarta targets the adult patient population of FL relapsed and refractory 
after at least three prior lines of systemic therapy. The authorised treatment options in this setting 
include rituximab and obinutuzumab either in monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy for 
patients who did not receive them previously, idelalisib, duvelisib, lenalidomide plus rituximab, and

The  COMP  noted  that  FL  Grade  1-3a  comprises  the  most  prevalent  indolent  (low-grade)  lymphoma 
subtype of NHL. FL grade 3b is categorised with other FLs but is at an intermediate stage of large cell 
transformation and is typically treated as an aggressive (high-grade lymphoma. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor is proposing that their product can be used to target relapsed/refractory patients who 
failed two lines of prior therapy. They are seeking the following indication:  Breyanzi is indicated for 
the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 
primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and follicular lymphoma grade 3B (FL3B), after 
two or more lines of systemic therapy”. The CHMP has also requested that the follicular lymphoma 
subtype identified by the FL3B should be included into the therapeutic indication so this may need to 
be considered for the assessment of a clinically relevant advantage to support significant benefit.  
Currently the following products have overlapping indications with the one proposed by the sponsor. 
•  Zydelig (idelalisib) is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with follicular 
lymphoma (FL) that is refractory to two prior lines of treatment 
•  Copiktra (duvelisib) monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Follicular 
lymphoma (FL) that is refractory to at least two prior systemic therapies 
•  MabThera (rituximab) monotherapy is indicated for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular 
lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after 
chemotherapy 
•  Zevalin [90Y]-radiolabelled ibritumomab tiuxetan is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with rituximab relapsed or refractory CD20+ follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).

Pixantrone is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiple relapsed 
or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas. The benefit of pixantrone treatment has 
not been established in patients when used as fifth line or greater chemotherapy in patients who 
are refractory to last therapy 
The sponsor identifies pixantrone (authorised for multiply R/R, aggressive NHL) as the only product 
applicable for significant benefit assessment. For all other authorised products with later line 
therapeutic indications (ibritumomab, rituximab, obinutuzumab, idelalisib and duvelisib), the 
registrational studies were conducted in indolent FL and/or do not cover the 3L+ FL3B indication. 
Therefore, the sponsor states that a comparison of data is thus not possible. Furthermore, as 
treatment with anti-CD20 was an inclusion criterion for study 017001, responses in this population can 
be regarded as sufficient to establish SB over rituximab. However, as the therapeutic indications do not 
rule out FL3B patients they still have to be considered for the purpose of significant benefit. 
With regards to the comparison to pixantrone only very little data on FL3B patients are available from 
the registrational trials (n=1 for Pixuvri, n=8 for Breyanzi) and the SB comparison is based on data on 
the larger study populations (mainly DLBCL for both products).  
ORR:    
72.8% [66.9, 78.1] vs. 37.1% [25.9, 49.5]

Additionally, the sponsor emphasises the favourable responses and DOR of the 8 patients with FL3B .  
No data on Pixuvri-treated patients from the RWE study NDS-NHL-001 are provided.   
The COMP discussed the proposed indirect comparison and concluded that significant benefit to Pixuvri 
had been established. Based on the same reasoning with regards to a descriptive comparison of high 
efficacy in a largely different patient population the significant benefit over Zevalin can also be 
accepted. During further discussions it was noted that the COMP was at variance with the assumptions 
the sponsor has made for copanlisib and idelalisib considering that an indirect comparison should also 
have been provided in view that the therapeutic indications of the other more recently approved 
products do not mention the subtype of FL. 
3.4 COMP list of issues 
Significant Benefit 
The sponsor is asked to justify significant benefit over all treatments authorised for follicular lymphoma 
in greater than second line therapy including copanlisib and idelalisib.

4.2 Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2018 was 
based on the following grounds: 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following:  
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing lisocabtagene maraleucel 
was considered justified based on clinical observations in relapsed/refractory patients who 
responded to treatment with the proposed product;  
the condition is life-threatening due to relapses in 20-30% of patients who have poor prognosis 
and chronically debilitating in particular due to superior vena cava syndrome, night sweats, fever 
and weight loss;  
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 0.5 in 10,000 persons in the EU, at the 
time the application was made.  
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled.  
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the EU, the sponsor 
has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product containing 
lisocabtagene maraleucel will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor 
has provided clinical data in heavily pretreated relapsed or refractory (R/R) patients, who responded to 
treatment with the proposed product. Moreover, the rates of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in the 
treated patients were reported to be lower in comparison to the currently authorised chimeric antigen 
receptor (CAR) T-cell product. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
advantage.

4.3 Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of marketing 
authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is a relatively rare lymphoma subtype affecting mainly 
young adults. Its molecular signature and clinical features resemble classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Gene 
expression profile studies showed that it shares common features with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. 
Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) represents 
10% of all DLBCLs and it is more 
commonly seen in women in their third to fourth decades of life.  
∼
PMBCL arises in the thymus from a so-called thymic B-cell originating either from a germinal center or 
a nongerminal center but with an expression of an activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene. 
Cells are heterogenous, medium-sized to large-sized, with a pale, abundant cytoplasm. Their nuclei 
also show a degree of heterogeneity. They could be oval, irregular, pleomorphic like Reed-Sternberg 
cells or multilobated like in DLBCL. Characteristic feature of PMBCL is sclerosis dividing tumour tissue 
into compartments. Collagen bands are fine and not as broad as in cHL nodular sclerosis (NS) types.
Curr Hematol Malig Rep (2014) 9:273–283) 
(
PMBCL typically presents as a large, fast-growing tumour with invasion usually limited to the anterior-
upper mediastinum although it tends to infiltrate adjacent thoracic structures like the chest wall, 
pleura, lungs, pericardium, and heart causing pleural/pericardial effusion in approximately 30–50 % of 
cases. The disease is mainly locally advanced. Eighty percent of patients have clinical stage I and II 
and 75 % of them have bulky disease with a tumour mass exceeding 10 cm. Enlarged lymph nodes 
localized outside the mediastinum are rarely found. Bone marrow infiltration is seen in few cases. 
The World Health Organization has classified PMBCL as a unique entity on the basis of its unique 
clinical and immunophenotypic presentation and molecular features. (Zhou et al. Blood Cancer Journal 
(2020) 10:49) 
The COMP continues to designate this condition. 
The proposed therapeutic indication “Treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and follicular 
lymphoma Grade 3B (FL3B) after two or more lines of systemic therapy” falls within the scope of the 
designated orphan condition “Treatment of primary mediastinal large-B-cell lymphoma”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
PMBCL is an aggressive lymphoma and if left untreated, results in survival of weeks to months 
(Cultrera and Dalia 2012). Patients with PMBCL often present with a bulky tumour in the anterior 
mediastinum that is rapidly progressive and gives rise to local compressive symptoms, including early 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
Page 30/36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dyspnoea, cough, dysphagia and compromising the airway or great vessels, producing a superior vena 
cava syndrome. It can be accepted that the condition is life-threatening due to relapses in 20-30% of 
patients who have poor prognosis and chronically debilitating in particular due to superior vena cava 
syndrome, night sweats, fever and weight loss. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has consulted the European Cancer Information System (ECIS). According to the most 
recent data release, the number of NHL incident cases in the EU-27 was 86,321 in 2020 (ECIS, 2020). 
They indicate that the reported proportion of PMBCL cases in NHL is 2% to 4% (Dabrowska-Iwanicka, 
2014).  
A conservative approach was applied using 4% as the proportion of PMBCL and would indicate that the 
number of PMBCL cases in the EU-27 is 3,453. Using recently published Eurostat data, the population 
in the EU-27 was 447,671,046 in January 2020 (Eurostat Population Statistics, 2021), so the estimated 
annual incidence rate per 10,000 population is 0.077 (3453 / 447,671,046). 
The sponsor notes that median duration of survival varies among patient groups, particularly with age 
of disease onset. The only estimate of mean survival duration was found in one study based on 28 
patients (Al Shemmari, 2014). Other literature reported 5-year survival (both OS and PFS) ranging 
from 50% to 100% with most around 70% to 90% (Dabrowska-Iwanicka, 2014; Al Shemmari, 2014). 
With such high 5-year survival estimates, the median survival for PMBCL may be indeterminate due to 
censoring. One published review on PMBCL included data from various regimens for PMBCL which 
included survival estimates. In one trial, the investigators reported a 10.9-year OS of 66% and PFS of 
50% (Dabrowska-Iwanicka, 2014). This is the closest estimate to the median survival that could be 
found in the literature; therefore, for the calculation of the point prevalence, 10.9 years was used as 
the average duration. There have not been any recent publications reporting median survival for 
PMBCL. PMBCL is currently considered a highly curable disease (Fakhri, 2021; Shah, 2018) and the 
favored initial treatment with dose-adjusted EPOCH-R without radiotherapy, results in over 90% of the 
patients cured at 5 years (Figure 1)  
Kaplan–Meier Estimates of Overall Survival of Patients following Treatment with DA-EPOCH-R 
CI = confidence interval; DA-EPOCH-R = dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and rituximab. Overall survival 
94.7% (95% CI, 86.3-98.0) at 8 years for the total cohort. Source: Melani, 2018 
Despite excellent responses to first-line therapy, outcomes of RR PMBCL remain dismal (Ahmed, 
2021).  
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
Page 31/36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In view of the high cure rates, taking 10.9 years as the average duration is a very conservative 
approach that overestimates the true duration of disease, which is likely not above 5 years. However, 
even if the hypothetical median survival were 5 times longer than 10.9 years, the prevalence would 
still be well below the threshold for orphan condition of 5 per 10,000 people. Using the guidance 
calculation method of Prevalence = Incidence × Disease duration, the updated 2020 prevalence for 
PMBCL is 0.84 per 10,000 (0.077 x 10.9) in the EU27 which is below the threshold for orphan condition 
of 5 per 10,000 people (EMA, 2019) 
The COMP accepted the proposed prevalence calculation of 0.8 in 10,000. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Yescarta has received a centralised marketing authorisation for “for the treatment of adult patients 
with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell 
lymphoma (PMBCL), after two or more lines of systemic therapy”. In addition to that, the COMP 
considered that products authorised for broader indications, including e.g. DLBCL or NHL indications, 
should be taken into consideration as existing authorised treatments.  
As per the ESMO guidelines (Vitolo et al, Annals of Oncology, Volume 27, Issue suppl_5, 1 September 
2016, Pages v91–v102), the combination of rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine 
and prednisolone (R-CHOP) or with VACOP-B (etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, 
prednisolone and bleomycin)/MACOP-B (methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, 
prednisolone and bleomycin) (R-V/MACOP-B), dose-dense CHOP (R-CHOP14) or more intensive 
regimens such as DA-EPOCH-R (dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin and rituximab) are the current standard treatments. 
Consolidative mediastinal RT is recommended in responding patients treated with standard-dose 
chemoimmunotherapy (R-CHOP/R-V/MACOP-B). HDCT followed by ASCT is not recommended in 
patients who achieved complete remission, but in young patients who do not obtain an adequate 
response, an intensification therapy with HDCT/ASCT is recommended (Vitolo et al, Annals of 
Oncology, Volume 27, Issue suppl_5, 1 September 2016, Pages v91–v102).  
In particular for relapsed/refractory PMBCLs, ESMO guidelines note that salvage treatment strategies 
of similar to nodal DLBCLs and include attempting reinduction with non-cross-resistant agents followed 
by consolidation with HDCT/ASCT in patients with chemosensitive disease. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor is proposing that their product will offer a clinically relevant advantage in patients who are 
relapsed or refractory after 2 previous lines of therapy. 
Breyanzi is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and follicular lymphoma 
grade 3B (FL3B), after two or more lines of systemic therapy.  
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
Page 32/36 
 
 
 
 
 
With the indication targeted by the Sponsor, the following products as listed in their submission are 
approved in 3L+ PMBCL:  
• 
• 
Yescarta   
Pixuvri   
•  Salvage therapies  
The only product which has a similar indication is Yescarta:  
Yescarta is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), after two or more lines of 
systemic therapy. 
As there is a full overlap of the therapeutic indications an assessment of significant benefit is required.  
Protocol Assistance was sought by the Sponsor on the proposed clinical development plan of JCAR017 
in DLBCL, PMBCL, and FL in support of significant benefit over existing therapies  
The COMP suggested that: For the demonstration of significant benefit based on improved efficacy 
through indirect comparisons, the COMP recommended to provide indirect comparisons of adequate 
methodology and encouraged the Sponsor to explore the possibility to use data from real world 
evidence (RWE) from patients that are treated with the currently authorized products to support 
significant benefit. 
The sponsor has submitted indirect comparisons of efficacy and safety between JCAR017 and the 
approved products in 3L+ previously treated PMBCL.  
Yescarta:  
The sponsor claims a clinically relevant advantage based on safety versus Yescarta and that their 
product is at least comparable in efficacy.  
Improved safety:   
The sponsor performs a safety comparison of the total populations (including DLBCL (and FL) patients) 
of Yescarta ZUMA-1 trial (n=109, 24 month follow-up analysis) and Breyanzi 017001 study (n=270).   
Grade ≥3 TEAEs:  78.9% vs. 98.1%  
Serious TEAEs: 45.2% vs. 51.9%  
All grade CRS:  41.9% vs. 92.6%  
Grade ≥3 infections: 12.2% vs. 25.9%  
Grade ≥3 neurological toxicities: 10.0% vs 32.4%  
ICU admissions:  7.0% vs. 16%  
Further adverse events for which at least 20% difference between Breyanzi and Yescarta could be 
detected (in favour of Breyanzi), include: pyrexia, hypotension, tachycardia, encephalopathy, febrile 
neutropenia, chills, hypoxia, and nausea.  
In addition, a matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison (MAIC) was performed based on study 
017001 (Breyanzi pivotal study) and ZUMA-1 (Yescarta pivotal study), which demonstrated 
significantly lower odds of a broad number of AEs.  
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
Page 33/36 
 
 
 
 
 
At least comparable efficacy:   
In the ZUMA-1 study (Yescarta), bridging therapy was not permitted between leukapheresis and 
infusion . In contrast, in the Breyanzi 017001 study, 
59% of the patients included did receive prior bridging therapy.   
Thus, the sponsor compares results from Yescarta study ZUMA-1 (n=8 PMBCL, 12-month follow-
up results as described in the OMAR) 
with a patient subset from Breyanzi study 017001  (n=6 PMBCL patients without prior bridging therap
y, to approximate the ZUMA-1 population).  
ORR:  83% (5/6) vs. 75% (6/8)  
CR:  67% (4/6) vs. 75% (6/8)  
mDoR: NR vs. NR  
1y-OS: 83% (5/6) vs. 75% (6/8)   
Efficacy data of the whole study populations (including DLBCL) is not mentioned, however, in the 
maintenance report for DLBCL, efficacy data for the whole populations are shown and can be 
regarded as comparable.  
Finally, a matching-adjusted indirect treatment analysis (MAIC) was performed based on the 017001 
subset without prior bridging therapy and the ZUMA-1 population, including two sensitivity 
analyses which included the patients with bridging therapy. The analysis yielded comparable efficacy 
results for Breyanzi and Yescarta.  
The COMP could conclude the following regarding significant benefit over Yescarta:  
The significant benefit claim over Yescarta was discussed during the plenary. At the time of orphan 
designation, significant benefit over Yescarta was accepted based on improved safety. It was also 
supported by non-clinical data showing the possibility of B-cell ablation in view of the inclusion of a 
truncated EGFR into the viral vector. However, the COMP noted that no clinical data was submitted to 
demonstrate the clinical utility of this difference. While this would be in line with what is expected for 
such a rare clinical situation at the time of initial registration,  the clinically relevant advantage versus 
Yescarta based on safety using so few patients affected by PMLBC would not be acceptable to the 
COMP without additional support from a similar setting (in this case R/R DLBCL). 
The COMP considered that significant benefit based on a clinically relevant safety advantage had not 
been shown and that the sponsor should be invited to elaborate further on this point.

Pixuvri:  
In their comparison to Pixuvri the sponsor makes claim of improved efficacy. Pixuvri (pixantrone), an 
anthraquinone-based inhibitor of topoisomerase II, which was approved by the EMA in the broad 
indication of R/R aggressive B-
NHL: “Pixantrone is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiple relapse
d or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas. 
The benefit of pixantrone treatment has not been established in patients when used as fifth line or gre
ater chemotherapy in patients who are refractory to last therapy.”  
The COMP noted that PMBCL patients were not included in the Pixuvri registration study and 
that the sponsor assumes that results in PMBCL patients would be similar to those reported in the whol
e study population (mainly DLBCL patients). 
Thus, the whole Pixuvri study population (n=70) is compared to the subset of PMBCL patients included 
in Breyanzi study 017001 (n=14). 
ORR:  78.6% [49.2, 95.3] vs. 37.1% [25.9, 49.5]  
CR:  50.0% [23.0, 77.0] vs. 20.0% [11.4, 31.3]  
mDOR: NR [4.4, NR] vs. 7.0m [3.8, 11.6]  
mOS: NR [12.1, NR] vs. 10.2m [6.4, 15.7]   
Data from Pixuvri patients in the RWE study NDS-NHL-001 are not mentioned. No data regarding the 
efficacy of Pixuvri in PMBCL were presented. The COMP however, considered that the large difference 
in efficacy between Breyanzi vs. Pixuvri in the DLBCL dataset could be regarded as sufficient to 
establish significant benefit based on a clinically relevant advantage for the PMBCL indication.  
Rituximab and other salvage therapies  
R-CHOP is authorised for the treatment of first-line patients. Rituximab in combination with other 
chemotherapy regimens (ICE, DHAP, GDP) is also recommended in R/R PMBCL (ESMO guideline 2016).  
The inclusion criterion for the Breyanzi study 017001, was prior treatment with an anthracyclin 
regimen and anti-CD20 with the majority received a platinum-containing second-line therapy. The 
responses reported in a population who were relapsed or refractory to these treatments was 
considered sufficient to demonstrate SB.  
In addition, the sponsor performed and presented an efficacy comparison to SCHOLAR-1 and to the 
RWE study NDS-NHL-001. This approach was accepted as a valid external control for SB in the 
Yescarta orphan maintenance procedure. SCHOLAR-1 is a large, retrospective study with results pooled 
from RCTs and databases, which also encompasses R/R PMBCL (n=10). In NDS-NHL-001, n=17 PMBCL 
patients were included 
Breyanzi compares favourably to salvage therapies as described above:   
ORR:  78.6% (11/14) vs. 20% (2/10) vs. 41.6% (7/17)  
CR:  67% (4/6) vs. 0% (0/10) vs. 23.5% (4/17)  
mOS: NR (12.1, NR) vs. 7.7m (4.3, NR) vs. 6.1m (4.0, NR)  
The COMP considered that significant benefit to Rituximab + salvage therapies as proposed by the 
sponsor could be accepted.

During the the plenary discussion, the COMP considered that the sponsor had adequately addressed 
significant benefit criteria over Pixuvru and salvage therapies. They, however, were of the opinion that 
while equivalent efficacy to Yescarta had been established, a clinically relevant advantage regarding 
safety had not been shown that would support their significant benefit claim. The sponsor was 
therefore invited to further elaborate on what this significant benefit based on safety could be versus 
Yescarta.  
4.4 COMP list of issues 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor is invited to further elaborate on the indirect comparison regarding better safety to 
Yescarta.  
In view of the low number of patients included with PMBCL, significant benefit for PMBCL needs to be 
supported by an agreement on the justification of significant benefit for DLBCL.

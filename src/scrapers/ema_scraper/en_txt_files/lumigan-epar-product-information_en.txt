Colourless solution.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension in 
adults (as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
The recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily, administered in the evening. The 
dose should not exceed once daily, as more frequent administration may lessen the intraocular pressure 
lowering effect. 
Paediatric population: 
The safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to 18 years has not yet been established.
Patients with hepatic and renal impairment:
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with renal or moderate to severe hepatic impairment and 
should therefore be used with caution in such patients. In patients with a history of mild liver disease 
or abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or bilirubin at 
baseline, bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution had no adverse effect on liver function over 24
months.
Method of administration
If more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, each one should be administered 
at least 5 minutes apart.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml is contraindicated in patients who have had a suspected previous adverse 
reaction to benzalkonium chloride that has led to discontinuation.

4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Ocular
Before treatment is initiated, patients should be informed of the possibility of prostaglandin analogue 
periorbitopathy (PAP) and increased iris pigmentation, since these have been observed during 
treatment with LUMIGAN. Some of these changes may be permanent, and may lead to impaired field 
of vision and differences in appearance between the eyes when only one eye is treated (see section 
4.8). 
Cystoid macular oedema has been uncommonly reported (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) following treatment 
with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. Therefore, LUMIGAN should be used with caution in 
patients with known risk factors for macular oedema (e.g. aphakic patients, pseudophakic patients with 
a torn posterior lens capsule).
There have been rare spontaneous reports of reactivation of previous corneal infiltrates or ocular 
infections with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. LUMIGAN should be used with caution in 
patients with a prior history of significant ocular viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex) or uveitis/iritis.
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with inflammatory ocular conditions, neovascular, 
inflammatory, angle-closure glaucoma, congenital glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma. 
Skin
There is a potential for hair growth to occur in areas where LUMIGAN solution comes repeatedly in 
contact with the skin surface. Thus, it is important to apply LUMIGAN as instructed and avoid it 
running onto the cheek or other skin areas. 
Respiratory
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with compromised respiratory function.  While there is 
limited information available on patients with a history of asthma or COPD, there have been reports of 
exacerbation of asthma, dyspnoea and COPD, as well as reports of asthma, in post marketing 
experience. The frequency of these symptoms is not known. Patients with COPD, asthma or 
compromised respiratory function due to other conditions should be treated with caution.
Cardiovascular
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with heart block more severe than first degree or 
uncontrolled congestive heart failure. There have been a limited number of spontaneous reports of 
bradycardia or hypotension with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. LUMIGAN should be 
used with caution in patients predisposed to low heart rate or low blood pressure.
Other Information
In studies of bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, it has been 
shown that the more frequent exposure of the eye to more than one dose of bimatoprost daily may 
decrease the IOP-lowering effect (see section 4.5). Patients using LUMIGAN with other prostaglandin 
analogues should be monitored for changes to their intraocular pressure. 
LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml contains the preservative benzalkonium chloride (200 ppm), which may be 
absorbed by soft contact lenses. Eye irritation and discolouration of the soft contact lenses may also 
occur because of the presence of benzalkonium chloride. Contact lenses should be removed prior to 
instillation and may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration. 
Benzalkonium chloride, which is commonly used as a preservative in ophthalmic products, has been 
reported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative keratopathy. Since 
LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml contains 200 ppm benzalkonium chloride (four times the concentration in 
bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops), it should be used with caution in dry eye patients, in patients where 
the cornea may be compromised and in patients taking multiple BAK-containing eye drops. In 
addition, monitoring is required with prolonged use in such patients. 
3
There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple dose containers of 
topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, 
in most cases, had a concurrent ocular disease. Patients with a disruption of the ocular epithelial 
surface are at greater risk of developing bacterial keratitis.
Patients should be instructed to avoid allowing the tip of the dispensing container to contact the eye or 
surrounding structures, to avoid eye injury and contamination of the solution. 
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
No interactions are anticipated in humans, since systemic concentrations of bimatoprost are extremely 
low (less than 0.2 ng/ml) following ocular dosing with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. 
Bimatoprost is biotransformed by any of multiple enzymes and pathways, and no effects on hepatic 
drug metabolising enzymes were observed in preclinical studies. 
In clinical studies, bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml, eye drops, solution was used concomitantly with a number 
of different ophthalmic beta-blocking agents without evidence of interactions. 
Concomitant use of LUMIGAN and antiglaucomatous agents other than topical beta-blockers has not 
been evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy. 
There is a potential for the IOP-lowering effect of prostaglandin analogues (e.g. LUMIGAN) to be 
reduced in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension when used with other prostaglandin 
analogues (see section 4.4).
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no adequate data from the use of bimatoprost in pregnant women. Animal studies have 
shown reproductive toxicity at high maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3).
LUMIGAN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether bimatoprost is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown 
excretion of bimatoprost in breast milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue from LUMIGAN therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-
feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
Fertility
There are no data on the effects of bimatoprost on human fertility.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
LUMIGAN has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. As with any ocular 
treatment, if transient blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient should wait until the vision clears 
before driving or using machines. 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
In a 12-month Phase III clinical study approximately 38 % of patients treated with 
LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye drops, solution experienced adverse reactions. The most frequently 
reported adverse reaction was conjunctival hyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and of a 
4
non-inflammatory nature) occurring in 29 % of patients. Approximately 4 % of patients discontinued 
due to any adverse event in the 12-month study. 
The following adverse reactions were reported during clinical trials with LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye 
drops, solution or in the post-marketing period. Most were ocular, mild and none was serious.
Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 
to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available data) adverse 
reactions are presented according to System Organ Class in Table 1 in order of decreased seriousness 
within each frequency grouping.

Prostaglandin analogues including LUMIGAN can induce periorbital lipodystrophic changes which 
can lead to deepening of the eyelid sulcus, ptosis, enophthalmos, eyelid retraction, involution of 
dermatochalasis and inferior scleral show. Changes are typically mild, can occur as early as one month 
after initiation of treatment with LUMIGAN, and may cause impaired field of vision even in the 
absence of patient recognition. PAP is also associated with periocular skin hyperpigmentation or 
5
discoloration and hypertrichosis. All changes have been noted to be partially or fully reversible upon 
discontinuation or switch to alternative treatments.
Iris hyperpigmentation
Increased iris pigmentation is likely to be permanent. The pigmentation change is due to increased 
melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. The long-
term effects of increased iris pigmentation are not known. Iris colour changes seen with ophthalmic 
administration of bimatoprost may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown 
pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire 
iris or parts become more brownish. Neither naevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by the 
treatment. At 12 months, the incidence of iris hyperpigmentation with bimatoprost 0.1 mg/ml eye 
drops, solution was 0.5%. At 12 months, the incidence with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution 
was 1.5% (see section 4.8 Table 2) and did not increase following 3 years treatment.
In clinical studies, over 1800 patients have been treated with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml. On combining 
the data from phase III monotherapy and adjunctive LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml usage, the most frequently 
reported adverse reactions were: 
 growth of eyelashes in up to 45 % in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing 
to 7 % at 2 years and 2 % at 3 years
 conjunctival hyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and thought to be of a non-inflammatory nature) 
in up to 44 % in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 13 % at 2 years 
and 12 % at 3 years 
 ocular pruritus in up to 14 % of patients in the first year with the incidence of new reports 
decreasing to 3 % at 2 years and 0 % at 3 years. Less than 9 % of patients discontinued due to 
any adverse event in the first year with the incidence of additional patient discontinuations 
being 3 % at both 2 and 3 years.
Additional adverse reactions reported with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml are presented in Table 2. The table 
also includes those adverse reactions which occurred with both formulations but at a different 
frequency. Most were ocular, mild to moderate, and none was serious: With each frequency grouping, 
adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Adverse reactions reported in phosphate containing eye drops:
Cases of corneal calcification have been reported very rarely in association with the use of phosphate 
containing eye drops in some patients with significantly damaged corneas.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported, and is unlikely to occur after ocular administration.
If overdose occurs, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. If LUMIGAN is accidentally 
ingested, the following information may be useful: in two-week oral rat and mouse studies, doses up to 
100 mg/kg/day did not produce any toxicity. This dose expressed as mg/m2 is at least 210 times higher 
than the accidental dose of one bottle of LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye drops, solution in a 10 kg child.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, prostaglandin analogues, ATC code: S01EE03. 
Mechanism of action
The mechanism of action by which bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure in humans is by 
increasing aqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and enhancing uveoscleral 
outflow. Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 4 hours after the first 
administration and maximum effect is reached within approximately 8 to 12 hours. The duration of 
effect is maintained for at least 24 hours.
Bimatoprost is a potent ocular hypotensive agent. It is a synthetic prostamide, structurally related to 
prostaglandin F2 (PGF2), that does not act through any known prostaglandin receptors. Bimatoprost 
selectively mimics the effects of newly discovered biosynthesised substances called prostamides. The 
prostamide receptor, however, has not yet been structurally identified.
During a 12-month pivotal study in adults with LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye drops, the mean diurnal 
IOP values measured at any visit over the 12-month study period differed by no more than 1.1 mmHg 
throughout the day and were never greater than 17.7 mmHg. 
LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye drops contains BAK in a concentration of 200 ppm.
Limited experience is available with the use of LUMIGAN in patients with open-angle glaucoma with 
pseudoexfoliative and pigmentary glaucoma, and chronic angle-closure glaucoma with patent 
iridotomy.
No clinically relevant effects on heart rate and blood pressure have been observed in clinical trials. 
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to less than 18 years has not been 
established.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties 
7
Absorption
Bimatoprost penetrates the human cornea and sclera well in vitro. After ocular administration in 
adults, the systemic exposure of bimatoprost is very low with no accumulation over time. After once 
daily ocular administration of one drop of 0.3 mg/ml bimatoprost to both eyes for two weeks, blood 
concentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and declined to below the lower limit of 
detection (0.025 ng/ml) within 1.5 hours after dosing. Mean Cmax and AUC 0-24hrs values were similar 
on days 7 and 14 at approximately 0.08 ng/ml and 0.09 nghr/ml respectively, indicating that a steady 
bimatoprost concentration was reached during the first week of ocular dosing. 
Distribution
Bimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues and the systemic volume of distribution in 
humans at steady-state was 0.67 l/kg. In human blood, bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma. The 
plasma protein binding of bimatoprost is approximately 88 %. 
Biotransformation
Bimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation 
following ocular dosing. Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation, N-deethylation and glucuronidation to 
form a diverse variety of metabolites.
Elimination
Bimatoprost is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, up to 67 % of an intravenous dose 
administered to healthy adult volunteers was excreted in the urine, 25 % of the dose was excreted via 
the faeces. The elimination half-life, determined after intravenous administration, was approximately 
45 minutes; the total blood clearance was 1.5 l/hr/kg. 
Characteristics in elderly patients
After twice daily dosing with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution, the mean AUC0-24hr value of 
0.0634 nghr/ml bimatoprost in the elderly (subjects 65 years or older) were significantly higher than 
0.0218 nghr/ml in young healthy adults. However, this finding is not clinically relevant as systemic 
exposure for both elderly and young subjects remained very low from ocular dosing. There was no 
accumulation of bimatoprost in the blood over time and the safety profile was similar in elderly and 
young patients.
5.3
Preclinical safety data 
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the 
maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.
Monkeys administered ocular bimatoprost concentrations of 0.3 mg/ml daily for 1 year had an 
increase in iris pigmentation and reversible dose-related periocular effects characterised by a 
prominent upper and/or lower sulcus and widening of the palpebral fissure. The increased iris 
pigmentation appears to be caused by increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes and 
not by an increase in melanocyte number. No functional or microscopic changes related to the 
periocular effects have been observed, and the mechanism of action for the periocular changes is 
unknown. 
Bimatoprost was not mutagenic or carcinogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies. 
Bimatoprost did not impair fertility in rats up to doses of 0.6 mg/kg/day (at least 103-times the 
intended human exposure). In embryo/foetal developmental studies abortion, but no developmental 
effects were seen in mice and rats at doses that were at least 860-times or 1700-times higher than the 
dose in humans, respectively. These doses resulted in systemic exposures of at least 33- or 97-times 
higher, respectively, than the intended human exposure. In rat peri/postnatal studies, maternal toxicity 
caused reduced gestation time, foetal death, and decreased pup body weights at  0.3 mg/kg/day (at 
least 41-times the intended human exposure). Neurobehavioural functions of offspring were not 
affected.

Concomitant use of LUMIGAN and antiglaucomatous agents other than topical beta-blockers has not 
been evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy. 
There is a potential for the IOP-lowering effect of prostaglandin analogues (e.g. LUMIGAN) to be 
reduced in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension when used with other prostaglandin 
analogues (see section 4.4). 
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no adequate data from the use of bimatoprost in pregnant women. Animal studies have 
shown reproductive toxicity at high maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3).
LUMIGAN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
Breast-feeding

LUMIGAN has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. As with any ocular 
treatment, if transient blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient should wait until the vision clears 
before driving or using machines. 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
In clinical studies, over 1800 patients have been treated with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, 
solution. On combining the data from phase III monotherapy and adjunctive LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml 
eye drops, solution usage, the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events were: growth 
of eyelashes in up to 45% in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 7% at 2 
years and 2% at 3 years, conjunctival hyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and thought to be of a non-
inflammatory nature) in up to 44% in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 
13% at 2 years and 12% at 3 years and ocular pruritus in up to 14% of patients in the first year with the 
13
incidence of new reports decreasing to 3% at 2 years and 0% at 3 years. Less than 9% of patients 
discontinued due to any adverse event in the first year with the incidence of additional patient 
discontinuations being 3% at both 2 and 3 years.
The following adverse reactions were reported during clinical trials with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml eye 
drops, solution or in the post-marketing period. Most were ocular, mild to moderate, and none was 
serious:
Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 
to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data) adverse 
reactions are presented according to System Organ Class in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, 
undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Prostaglandin analogue periorbitopathy (PAP) 
Prostaglandin analogues including LUMIGAN can induce periorbital lipodystrophic changes which 
can lead to deepening of the eyelid sulcus, ptosis, enophthalmos, eyelid retraction, involution of 
dermatochalasis and inferior scleral show. Changes are typically mild, can occur as early as one month 
14
after initiation of treatment with LUMIGAN, and may cause impaired field of vision even in the 
absence of patient recognition. PAP is also associated with periocular skin hyperpigmentation or 
discoloration and hypertrichosis. All changes have been noted to be partially or fully reversible upon 
discontinuation or switch to alternative treatments.
Iris hyperpigmentation
Increased iris pigmentation is likely to be permanent. The pigmentation change is due to increased 
melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. The long 
term effects of increased iris pigmentation are not known. Iris colour changes seen with ophthalmic 
administration of bimatoprost may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown 
pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire 
iris or parts become more brownish. Neither naevi nor freckles of the iris appears to be affected by the 
treatment. At 12 months, the incidence of iris pigmentation with bimatoprost 0.3mg/ml was 1.5% (see 
section 4.8) and did not increase following 3 years treatment.
Adverse reactions reported in phosphate containing eye drops:
Cases of corneal calcification have been reported very rarely in association with the use of phosphate 
containing eye drops in some patients with significantly damaged corneas.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported, and is unlikely to occur after ocular administration.
If overdose occurs, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. If LUMIGAN is accidentally 
ingested, the following information may be useful: in two-week oral rat and mouse studies, doses up to 
100 mg/kg/day did not produce any toxicity. This dose expressed as mg/m2 is at least 70-times higher 
than the accidental dose of one bottle of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution in a 10 kg child.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, prostaglandin analogues, ATC code: S01EE03.
Mechanism of action
The mechanism of action by which bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure in humans is by 
increasing aqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and enhancing uveoscleral 
outflow. Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 4 hours after the first 
administration and maximum effect is reached within approximately 8 to 12 hours. The duration of 
effect is maintained for at least 24 hours.
Bimatoprost is a potent ocular hypotensive agent. It is a synthetic prostamide, structurally related to 
prostaglandin F2 (PGF2), that does not act through any known prostaglandin receptors. Bimatoprost 
selectively mimics the effects of newly discovered biosynthesised substances called prostamides. The 
prostamide receptor, however, has not yet been structurally identified.
During 12 months’ monotherapy treatment with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml in adults, versus timolol, mean 
change from baseline in morning (08:00) intraocular pressure ranged from -7.9 to -8.8 mm Hg. At any 
15
visit, the mean diurnal IOP values measured over the 12-month study period differed by no more than 
1.3 mmHg throughout the day and were never greater than 18.0 mmHg.
In a 6-month clinical study with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml, versus latanoprost, a statistically superior 
reduction in morning mean IOP (ranging from -7.6 to -8.2 mmHg for bimatoprost versus –6.0 to 
-7.2 mmHg for latanoprost) was observed at all visits throughout the study. Conjunctival hyperaemia, 
growth of eyelashes, and eye pruritus were statistically significantly higher with bimatoprost than with 
latanoprost, however, the discontinuation rates due to adverse events were low with no statistically 
significant difference.
Compared to treatment with beta-blocker alone, adjunctive therapy with beta-blocker and 
LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml lowered mean morning (08:00) intraocular pressure by -6.5 to -8.1 mmHg.
Limited experience is available in patients with open-angle glaucoma with pseudoexfoliative and 
pigmentary glaucoma, and chronic angle-closure glaucoma with patent iridotomy.
No clinically relevant effects on heart rate and blood pressure have been observed in clinical trials.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to less than 18 years has not been 
established. 
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption
Bimatoprost penetrates the human cornea and sclera well in vitro. After ocular administration in 
adults, the systemic exposure of bimatoprost is very low with no accumulation over time. After once 
daily ocular administration of one drop of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml to both eyes for two weeks, blood 
concentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and declined to below the lower limit of 
detection (0.025 ng/ml) within 1.5 hours after dosing. Mean Cmax and AUC 0-24hrs values were similar 
on days 7 and 14 at approximately 0.08 ng/ml and 0.09 nghr/ml respectively, indicating that a steady 
bimatoprost concentration was reached during the first week of ocular dosing. 
Distribution
Bimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues and the systemic volume of distribution in 
humans at steady-state was 0.67 l/kg. In human blood, bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma. The 
plasma protein binding of bimatoprost is approximately 88%. 
Biotransformation
Bimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation 
following ocular dosing. Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation, N-deethylation and glucuronidation to 
form a diverse variety of metabolites.
Elimination
Bimatoprost is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, up to 67% of an intravenous dose administered 
to healthy adult volunteers was excreted in the urine, 25% of the dose was excreted via the faeces. The 
elimination half-life, determined after intravenous administration, was approximately 45 minutes; the 
total blood clearance was 1.5 l/hr/kg. 
Characteristics in elderly patients
After twice daily dosing of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml, the mean AUC0-24hr value of 0.0634 nghr/ml 
bimatoprost in the elderly (subjects 65 years or older) were significantly higher than 0.0218 nghr/ml 
in young healthy adults. However, this finding is not clinically relevant as systemic exposure for both 
elderly and young subjects remained very low from ocular dosing. There was no accumulation of 
bimatoprost in the blood over time and the safety profile was similar in elderly and young patients.
5.3
Preclinical safety data 
16
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the 
maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.
Monkeys administered ocular bimatoprost concentrations of 0.3 mg/ml daily for 1 year had an 
increase in iris pigmentation and reversible dose-related periocular effects characterised by a 
prominent upper and/or lower sulcus and widening of the palpebral fissure. The increased iris 
pigmentation appears to be caused by increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes and 
not by an increase in melanocyte number. No functional or microscopic changes related to the 
periocular effects have been observed, and the mechanism of action for the periocular changes is 
unknown. 
Bimatoprost was not mutagenic or carcinogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies. 
Bimatoprost did not impair fertility in rats up to doses of 0.6 mg/kg/day (at least 103-times the 
intended human exposure). In embryo/foetal developmental studies abortion, but no developmental 
effects were seen in mice and rats at doses that were at least 860-times or 1700-times higher than the 
dose in humans, respectively. These doses resulted in systemic exposures of at least 33- or 97-times 
higher, respectively, than the intended human exposure. In rat peri/postnatal studies, maternal toxicity 
caused reduced gestation time, foetal death, and decreased pup body weights at 0.3 mg/kg/day (at 
least 41-times the intended human exposure). Neurobehavioural functions of offspring were not 
affected.

Colourless solution.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension in 
adults (as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers). 
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
The recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily, administered in the evening. The 
dose should not exceed once daily as more frequent administration may lessen the intraocular pressure 
lowering effect. 
For single use only, one container is sufficient to treat both eyes. Any unused solution should be 
discarded immediately after use.
Paediatric population:
The safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to 18 years has not yet been established.
Patients with hepatic and renal impairment:
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with renal or moderate to severe hepatic impairment and 
should therefore be used with caution in such patients. In patients with a history of mild liver disease 
or abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or bilirubin at 
baseline, bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL eye drops (multi-dose formulation), solution had no adverse effect 
on liver function over 24 months.
Method of administration
If more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, each one should be administered 
at least 5 minutes apart.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
19
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Ocular
Before treatment is initiated, patients should be informed of the possibility of prostaglandin analogue 
periorbitopathy (PAP) and increased iris pigmentation, since these have been observed during 
treatment with LUMIGAN. Some of these changes may be permanent, and may lead to impaired field 
of vision and differences in appearance between the eyes when only one eye is treated (see section 
4.8). 
Cystoid macular oedema has been uncommonly reported (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) following treatment 
with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL eye drops (multi-dose formulation). Therefore, LUMIGAN should be 
used with caution in patients with known risk factors for macular oedema (e.g. aphakic patients, 
pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule).
There have been rare spontaneous reports of reactivation of previous corneal infiltrates or ocular 
infections with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL eye drops, solution (multi-dose formulation). LUMIGAN 
should be used with caution in patients with a prior history of significant ocular viral infections (e.g. 
herpes simplex) or uveitis/iritis.
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with inflammatory ocular conditions, neovascular, 
inflammatory, angle-closure glaucoma, congenital glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma. 
Skin
There is a potential for hair growth to occur in areas where LUMIGAN solution comes repeatedly in 
contact with the skin surface. Thus, it is important to apply LUMIGAN as instructed and avoid it 
running onto the cheek or other skin areas.
Respiratory
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with compromised respiratory function. While there is 
limited information available on patients with a history of asthma or COPD, there have been reports of 
exacerbation of asthma, dyspnoea and COPD, as well as reports of asthma, in post marketing 
experience. The frequency of these symptoms is not known. Patients with COPD, asthma or 
compromised respiratory function due to other conditions should be treated with caution.
Cardiovascular
LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with heart block more severe than first degree or 
uncontrolled congestive heart failure. There have been a limited number of spontaneous reports of 
bradycardia or hypotension with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL eye drops, solution (multi-dose formulation). 
LUMIGAN should be used with caution in patients predisposed to low heart rate or low blood 
pressure.
Other Information
In studies of bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, it has been 
shown that the more frequent exposure of the eye to more than one dose of bimatoprost daily may 
decrease the IOP-lowering effect. Patients using LUMIGAN with other prostaglandin analogues 
should be monitored for changes to their intraocular pressure.
LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose has not been studied in patients wearing contact lenses. 
Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation and may be reinserted 15 minutes following 
administration. 
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
No interactions are anticipated in humans, since systemic concentrations of bimatoprost are extremely 
low (less than 0.2 ng/mL) following ocular dosing with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL eye drops, solution 
20
(multi-dose formulation). Bimatoprost is biotransformed by any of multiple enzymes and pathways, 
and no effects on hepatic drug metabolising enzymes were observed in preclinical studies. 
In clinical studies, LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) was used concomitantly with a 
number of different ophthalmic beta-blocking agents without evidence of interactions. 
Concomitant use of LUMIGAN and antiglaucomatous agents other than topical beta-blockers has not 
been evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy.
There is a potential for the IOP-lowering effect of prostaglandin analogues (e.g. LUMIGAN) to be 
reduced in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension when used with other prostaglandin 
analogues (see section 4.4).
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no adequate data from the use of bimatoprost in pregnant women. Animal studies have 
shown reproductive toxicity at high maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3).
LUMIGAN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether bimatoprost is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown 
excretion of bimatoprost in breast milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-
feeding or to discontinue from LUMIGAN therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for 
the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
Fertility
There are no data on the effects of bimatoprost on human fertility.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
LUMIGAN has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. As with any ocular 
treatment, if transient blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient should wait until the vision clears 
before driving or using machines. 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
In a 3 month clinical study, approximately 29% of patients treated with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-
dose experienced adverse reactions. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were conjuctival 
hyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and of a non-inflammatory nature) occurring in 24% of patients, and 
eye pruritis occurring in 4% of patients. Approximately 0.7% of patients in the LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL 
single-dose group discontinued due to any adverse event in the 3 month study. 
The following adverse reactions were reported during clinical trials with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL 
single-dose or in the post-marketing period. Most were ocular, mild and none was serious:
Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 
to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data) adverse 
reactions are presented according to System Organ Class in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, 
undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Prostaglandin analogue periorbitopathy (PAP) 
Prostaglandin analogues including LUMIGAN can induce periorbital lipodystrophic changes which 
can lead to deepening of the eyelid sulcus, ptosis, enophthalmos, eyelid retraction, involution of 
dermatochalasis and inferior scleral show. Changes are typically mild, can occur as early as one month 
after initiation of treatment with LUMIGAN, and may cause impaired field of vision even in the 
absence of patient recognition. PAP is also associated with periocular skin hyperpigmentation or 
discoloration and hypertrichosis. All changes have been noted to be partially or fully reversible upon 
discontinuation or switch to alternative treatments.
Iris hyperpigmentation
Increased iris pigmentation is likely to be permanent. The pigmentation change is due to increased 
melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. The long 
term effects of increased iris pigmentation are not known. Iris colour changes seen with ophthalmic 
administration of bimatoprost may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown 
pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire 
iris or parts become more brownish. Neither naevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by the 
treatment. At 3 months, the incidence of iris hyperpigmentation with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL single 
dose was 0.3%. At 12 months, the incidence of iris pigmentation with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL (multi-
dose formulation) was 1.5% (see section 4.8) and did not increase following 3 years treatment.
In clinical studies, over 1800 patients have been treated with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose 
formulation). On combining the data from phase III monotherapy and adjunctive 
22
LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) usage, the most frequently reported adverse reactions 
were: 
 growth of eyelashes in up to 45% in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing 
to 7% at 2 years and 2% at 3 years
 conjunctival hyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and thought to be of a non-inflammatory nature) 
in up to 44% in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 13% at 2 years and 
12% at 3 years
 ocular pruritus in up to 14% of patients in the first year with the incidence of new reports 
decreasing to 3% at 2 years and 0% at 3 years. 
Less than 9% of patients discontinued due to any adverse event in the first year with the incidence of 
additional patient discontinuations being 3% at both 2 and 3 years.
Table 2 lists adverse reactions that were seen in a 12 month clinical study with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL 
(multi-dose formulation), but were reported at a higher frequency than with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL 
(single-dose). Most were ocular, mild to moderate, and none were serious.

4.9 Overdose
No information is available on overdose in humans; overdose is unlikely to occur after ocular 
administration. 
If overdose occurs, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. If LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-
dose is accidentally ingested, the following information may be useful: In short term oral (by gavage) 
mouse and rat studies, doses up to 100 mg/kg/day of bimatoprost did not produce any toxicity. This 
dose is at least 22 times higher than an accidental dose of the entire content of a pack of LUMIGAN 
0.3 mg/mL single-dose (30 x 0.4 mL single-dose containers; 12 mL) in a 10 kg child.

Clinical efficacy
A 12 week (double-masked, randomized, parallel group ) clinical study compared the efficacy and 
safety of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation). 
LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose achieved non-inferior IOP-lowering efficacy to LUMIGAN 0.3 
mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) for worse eye IOP change from baseline in patients with glaucoma or 
ocular hypertension. LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose also achieved equivalent IOP lowering 
efficacy with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) in average eye IOP at each follow-up 
timepoint at weeks 2, 6 and 12.
During 12 months’ monotherapy treatment with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) in 
adults, versus timolol, mean change from baseline in morning (08:00) intraocular pressure ranged from 
-7.9 to -8.8 mmHg. At any visit, the mean diurnal IOP values measured over the 12-month study 
period differed by no more than 1.3 mmHg throughout the day and were never greater than 18.0 
mmHg.
In a 6-month clinical study with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation), versus latanoprost, 
a statistically superior reduction in morning mean IOP (ranging from -7.6 to -8.2 mmHg for 
bimatoprost versus –6.0 to -7.2 mmHg for latanoprost) was observed at all visits throughout the study. 
24
Conjunctival hyperaemia, growth of eyelashes, and eye pruritus were statistically significantly higher 
with bimatoprost than with latanoprost, however, the discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 
low with no statistically significant difference.
Compared to treatment with beta-blocker alone, adjunctive therapy with beta-blocker and 
LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) lowered mean morning (08:00) intraocular pressure 
by -6.5 to -8.1 mmHg.
Limited experience is available in patients with open-angle glaucoma with pseudoexfoliative and 
pigmentary glaucoma, and chronic angle-closure glaucoma with patent iridotomy.
No clinically relevant effects on heart rate and blood pressure have been observed in clinical trials.

Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the 
maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.
25
Monkeys administered ocular bimatoprost concentrations of 0.3 mg/mL daily for 1 year had an 
increase in iris pigmentation and reversible dose-related periocular effects characterised by a 
prominent upper and/or lower sulcus and widening of the palpebral fissure. The increased iris 
pigmentation appears to be caused by increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes and 
not by an increase in melanocyte number. No functional or microscopic changes related to the 
periocular effects were observed, and the mechanism of action for the periocular changes is unknown. 
Bimatoprost was not mutagenic or carcinogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies. 
Bimatoprost did not impair fertility in rats up to doses of 0.6 mg/kg/day (at least 103-times the 
intended human exposure). In embryo/foetal developmental studies abortion, but no developmental 
effects were seen in mice and rats at doses that were at least 860-times or 1700-times higher than the 
dose in humans, respectively. These doses resulted in systemic exposures of at least 33- or 97-times 
higher, respectively, than the intended human exposure. In rat peri/postnatal studies, maternal toxicity 
caused reduced gestation time, foetal death, and decreased pup body weights at 0.3 mg/kg/day (at 
least 41-times the intended human exposure). Neurobehavioural functions of offspring were not 
affected.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml is and what it is used for
LUMIGAN is an antiglaucoma preparation. It belongs to a group of medicines called prostamides. 
LUMIGAN eye drops are used to reduce high pressure in the eye. This medicine may be used on its 
own or with other drops called beta-blockers which also reduce pressure.
Your eye contains a clear, watery liquid that feeds the inside of the eye. Liquid is constantly being 
drained out of the eye and new liquid is made to replace this. If the liquid cannot drain out quickly 
enough, the pressure inside the eye builds up. This medicine works by increasing the amount of liquid 
that is drained. This reduces the pressure inside the eye. If the high pressure is not reduced, it could 
lead to a disease called glaucoma and eventually damage your sight.
2. What you need to know before you use LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml
Do not use LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml:
-
if you are allergic to bimatoprost or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6).
if you have had to stop using eye drops in the past because of a side effect of the preservative 
benzalkonium chloride.
-
Warnings and precautions:
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you use LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml
Talk to your doctor, if:
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
You have any breathing problems
You have liver or kidney problems
You have had a cataract surgery in the past
You have dry eye
You have or have had any problems with your cornea (front transparent part of the eye) 
You wear contact lenses (see “LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml contains benzalkonium chloride”)
You have or have had low blood pressure or low heart rate
You have had a viral infection or inflammation of the eye
51
During treatment, LUMIGAN may cause a loss of fat around the eye, which may cause your eyelid 
crease to deepen, your eye to appear sunken (enophthalmos), your upper eyelid to droop (ptosis), the 
skin around your eye to tighten (involution of dermatochalasis) and the lower white part of your eye to 
become more visible (inferior scleral show). The changes are typically mild, but if pronounced, they 
can affect your field of vision. The changes may disappear if you stop taking LUMIGAN. LUMIGAN
may also cause your eyelashes to darken and grow, and cause the skin around the eyelid to darken too. 
The colour of your iris may also go darker. These changes may be permanent. The changes may be 
more noticeable if you are only treating one eye.
Children and adolescents
LUMIGAN has not been tested in children under the age of 18 and therefore should not be used by 
patients under 18 years.
Other medicines and LUMIGAN
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast feeding, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
LUMIGAN may get into breast milk so you should not breast-feed while you are taking LUMIGAN.
Driving and using machines
Your sight may become blurred for a short time just after using LUMIGAN. You should not drive or 
use machines until your sight is clear again.
LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml contains benzalkonium chloride
This medicine contains 0.6 mg benzalkonium chloride in each 3 ml of solution which is equivalent to 
0.2 mg/ml.
Do not use the drops when you are wearing your lenses. A preservative in LUMIGAN, benzalkonium 
chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may change the colour of the contact lenses.  You 
should remove contact lenses before using this medicine and wait 15 minutes after using the drops 
before you put your lenses back in. Benzalkonium chloride may also cause eye irritation, especially if 
you have dry eyes or disorders of the cornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye).  If you feel 
abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this medicine, talk to your doctor.
3.
How to use LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.
LUMIGAN should only be applied to the eye. The recommended dose is one drop of LUMIGAN in 
the evening, once daily in each eye that needs treatment.
If you use LUMIGAN with another eye medicine, wait at least five minutes between using 
LUMIGAN and the other eye medicine.
Do not use more than once a day as the effectiveness of treatment may be reduced.
Instructions for use:
You must not use the bottle if the tamper-proof seal on the bottle neck is broken before you first use it. 
52
1. Wash your hands. Tilt your head back and look at the ceiling.
2. Gently pull down the lower eyelid until there is a small pocket.
3. Turn the bottle upside down and squeeze it to release one drop into each eye that needs treatment.
4. Let go of the lower lid, and close your eye for 30 seconds.
Wipe off any excess that runs down the cheek.
If a drop misses your eye, try again.
To help prevent infections and avoid eye injury, do not let the tip of the bottle touch your eye or 
anything else. Put the cap back on and close the bottle straight after you have used it.
If you use more LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml than you should
If you use more LUMIGAN than you should, it is unlikely to cause you any serious harm. Put your 
next dose in at the usual time. If you are worried, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you forget to use LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml 
If you forget to use LUMIGAN, use a single drop as soon as you remember, and then go back to your 
regular routine. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop using LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml
LUMIGAN should be used every day to work properly. If you stop using LUMIGAN the pressure 
inside your eye may go up, therefore talk to your doctor before stopping this treatment.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

How to store LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml
Contents of the pack and other information
1. What LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml is and what it is used for 
LUMIGAN is an antiglaucoma preparation. It belongs to a group of medicines called prostamides. 
LUMIGAN is used to reduce high pressure in the eye. This medicine may be used on its own or with 
other drops called beta-blockers which also reduce pressure. 
Your eye contains a clear, watery liquid that feeds the inside of the eye. Liquid is constantly being 
drained out of the eye and new liquid is made to replace this. If the liquid cannot drain out quickly 
enough, the pressure inside the eye builds up. This medicine works by increasing the amount of liquid 
that is drained. This reduces the pressure inside the eye. If the high pressure is not reduced, it could 
lead to a disease called glaucoma and eventually damage your sight.
2. What you need to know before you use LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml
Do not use LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml:
-
if you are allergic to bimatoprost or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6).
if you have had to stop using eye drops in the past because of a side effect of the preservative 
benzalkonium chloride.
-
Warnings and precautions:
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you use LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml:
-
Talk to your doctor, if:
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
You have any breathing problems
You have liver or kidney problems
You have had a cataract surgery in the past 
You have dry eye
You have or have had any problems with your cornea (front transparent part of the eye) 
You wear contact lenses (see “LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml contains benzalkonium chloride”)
You have or have had low blood pressure or low heart rate
58
-
You have had a viral infection or inflammation of the eye
During treatment, LUMIGAN may cause a loss of fat around the eye, which may cause your eyelid 
crease to deepen, your eye to appear sunken (enophthalmos), your upper eyelid to droop (ptosis), the 
skin around your eye to tighten (involution of dermatochalasis) and the lower white part of your eye to 
become more visible (inferior scleral show). The changes are typically mild, but if pronounced, they 
can affect your field of vision. The changes may disappear if you stop taking LUMIGAN. LUMIGAN 
may also cause your eyelashes to darken and grow, and cause the skin around the eyelid to darken too. 
The colour of your iris may also go darker. These changes may be permanent. The changes may be 
more noticeable if you are only treating one eye.
Children and adolescents
LUMIGAN has not been tested in children under the age of 18 and therefore LUMIGAN should not be 
used by patients under 18 years.
Other medicines and LUMIGAN
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, or have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast feeding, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
LUMIGAN may get into breast milk so you should not breast-feed while you are taking LUMIGAN.
Driving and using machines
Your sight may become blurred for a short time just after using LUMIGAN. You should not drive or 
use machines until your sight is clear again.
LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml contains benzalkonium chloride
This medicine contains 0.15 mg benzalkonium chloride in each 3 ml of solution which is equivalent to 
0.05 mg/ml.
Do not use the drops when you are wearing your lenses. A preservative in LUMIGAN, benzalkonium 
chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may change the colour of the contact lenses.  You 
should remove contact lenses before using this medicine and wait 15 minutes after using the drops 
before you put your lenses back in. Benzalkonium chloride may also cause eye irritation, especially if 
you have dry eyes or disorders of the cornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye).  If you feel 
abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this medicine, talk to your doctor..
3.
How to use LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.
LUMIGAN should only be applied to the eye. The recommended dose is one drop of LUMIGAN in 
the evening, once daily in each eye that needs treatment.
If you use LUMIGAN with another eye medicine, wait at least five minutes between using 
LUMIGAN and the other eye medicine. 
Do not use more than once a day as the effectiveness of treatment may be reduced. 
Instructions for use:
You must not use the bottle if the tamper-proof seal on the bottle neck is broken before you first use it. 
59
1. Wash your hands. Tilt your head back and look at the ceiling.
2. Gently pull down the lower eyelid until there is a small pocket.
3. Turn the bottle upside down and squeeze it to release one drop into each eye that needs 
treatment.
4. Let go of the lower lid, and close your eye for 30 seconds.
Wipe off any excess that runs down the cheek. 
If a drop misses your eye, try again. 
To help prevent infections and avoid eye injury, do not let the tip of the bottle touch your eye or 
anything else. Put the cap back on and close the bottle straight after you have used it. 
If you use more LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml than you should
If you use more LUMIGAN than you should, it is unlikely to cause you any serious harm. Put your 
next dose in at the usual time. If you are worried, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you forget to use LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml
If you forget to use LUMIGAN, use a single drop as soon as you remember, and then go back to your 
regular routine. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop using LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml
LUMIGAN should be used every day to work properly. If you stop using LUMIGAN the pressure 
inside your eye may go up, therefore talk to your doctor before stopping this treatment.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Introduction 
On 09 December 2022, the MAH submitted a clinical study report for Study EFC13995, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. A short critical expert overview has also 
been provided.  
The provided critical expert overview is being submitted to provide the Agency with an outline of the 
EFC13995 study results in the single adolescent participant exposed to dupilumab.  
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study EFC13995, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group study designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab over 24 weeks in 
Chinese and Indian patients with persistent asthma in need of an additional treatment added to their 
standard of care management is a stand-alone study. 
Dupilumab was approved by the EC for the asthma indication (as described above) for adults and 
adolescents 12 years and older on 06 May 2019 and for children 6 to 11 years old on 04 April 2022. 
In the European Union (EU), Dupixent is approved for the treatment of the following Type 2 
inflammatory diseases: 
• Atopic dermatitis: 
- Adults and adolescents 12 years and older: Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-
severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for 
systemic therapy, 
- Children 6 to 11 years of age: Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of severe AD in children 6 to 11 
years old who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
• Asthma: 
- Adults and adolescents 12 years and older: Dupixent is indicated as add-on maintenance treatment 
for severe asthma with Type 2 inflammation characterised by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised 
fraction of exhaled fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), who are inadequately controlled with high 
dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment, 
- Children 6 to 11 years of age: Dupixent is indicated as add-on maintenance treatment for severe 
asthma with Type 2 inflammation characterised by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fraction of 
exhaled FeNO, who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose ICS plus another medicinal 
product for maintenance treatment. 
• Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP): 
- Dupixent is indicated as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of adults 
with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) for whom therapy with systemic 
corticosteroids and/or surgery do not provide adequate disease control. 
In addition, dupilumab is being investigated for the treatment of several other Type 2 inflammatory 
diseases in adult and pediatric populations.

1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Each prefilled syringe (PFS) contained 2 mL of dupilumab at the concentration of 150 mg/mL to deliver 
300 mg or 1.14 mL at a concentration of 175 mg/mL to deliver 200 mg. Matching placebo containing 
the identical formulation to the active formulation without dupilumab was administered via PFS (see 
study treatment).

1.3.2.  Clinical study 
A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 3 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with 
persistent asthma (EFC13995) 
Description 
Study EFC13995 was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group, Phase 3 study assessing the effect of dupilumab as an add-on therapy in participants 
with persistent asthma when administered for 24 weeks by bi-weekly (q2w) subcutaneous (SC) 
injection. Adult and adolescent participants with persistent asthma on a stable dose of ICS in 
combination with one or two other controller medications with or without OCS were randomized to 
receive dupilumab (200 mg q2w for participants without OCS maintenance, or 300 mg q2w for 
participants on OCS maintenance) or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio. 
The total duration of study per participant was up to 41 weeks and included the following 3 periods: 
• Screening Period (4 ±1 weeks): determine a participant’s eligibility status and establish level of 
asthma control before randomization. 
• Treatment Period (24 weeks): treat with dupilumab or placebo SC injection. 
• Post-treatment Period (12 weeks): monitor a participant’s status when off study drug treatment. 
A total of 67 sites (China: 54 sites, India: 13 sites) enrolled 486 participants in the study.

Methods 
Study participants 
This study enrolled adults and adolescent participants (≥12 years of age) with a physician diagnosis of 
asthma for ≥12 months, based on the GINA 2017 Guidelines.  
Main criteria included:  
• Existing treatment with medium to high dose ICS (≥250 μg of fluticasone propionate twice daily or 
equipotent ICS daily dosage to a maximum of 2000 μg/day of fluticasone propionate or equivalent) in 
combination with a second controller (eg, LABA, LTRA, LAMA, or theophylline, etc.) for at least 3 
months with a stable dose ≥1 month prior to the screening visit (Visit 1). Participants on 
budesonide/formoterol combo with budesonide 640 μg/day were considered as medium dose ICS and 
were eligible. 
- Participants requiring a third controller for their asthma were considered eligible for this study, and it 
was also to be used for at least 3 months with a stable dose ≥1 month prior to the screening visit 
(Visit 1). 
- Participants requiring maintenance OCS with a stable dose ≤10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent 
were allowed; OCS was to be used for at least 3 months with a stable dose ≥1 month prior to the 
screening visit (Visit 1). 
• Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ≤80% of predicted normal for adults and ≤90% of predicted normal for 
adolescents at the screening visit and the randomization visit (Visits 1 and 2), prior to randomization.

least twice the previous dose (for participants on OCS maintenance) for worsening asthma at 
least once. 
- Hospitalization or emergency medical care visit for worsening asthma, requiring systemic 
steroids. 
• For participants not requiring maintenance OCS, screening blood eosinophil count ≥0.15 Giga/L or 
FeNO ≥25 ppb was required; for participants requiring maintenance OCS, there was no minimum 
requirement for blood eosinophil count or FeNO level. 
Main exclusion criteria 
• Pregnant or breast-feeding women. 
• Weight was less than 30 kg at the screening visit (Visit 1) or the randomization visit (Visit 2).

- ALT >3 ULN 
• Anti-IgE therapy (omalizumab) within 130 days prior to the screening visit (Visit 1) or any other 
biologic therapy/immunosuppressant to treat inflammatory disease or autoimmune disease (eg, 
rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis) as well as other diseases within 2 months or 5 half-lives prior to 
the screening visit (Visit 1), whichever was longer.  
• Participants who had previously been treated in any clinical trial of dupilumab. 
Study design  
The study design is depicted in Figure 1. Dupilumab was to be added-on to an existing ICS treatment 
in combination with one or two other controller medications with or without OCS. Participants were 
randomized using a 1:1 ratio to dupilumab (200 mg q2w or 300 mg q2w) or matching placebo, the 
approved doses for asthma in the EU and US. The study periods are described above. 
The primary population for this study was non-OCS maintenance participants with evidence of Type 2 
inflammation (blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L or FeNO ≥25 ppb), consistent with the dupilumab 
mechanism of action, which lead to suppression of Type 2 inflammation as demonstrated in the pivotal 
asthma Phase 3 study EFC13579.

Sample size 
The sample size of the study was determined based on power calculations for the primary endpoint in 
patients with evidence of type 2 inflammation not on OCS maintenance. Assuming a common standard 
deviation of 0.44 L and a drop-out rate of approximately 5% prior to the Week 12, with 384 
randomized patients with evidence of type 2 inflammation (randomization ratio of 1:1, 192 in 
dupilumab 200 mg q2w group, and 192 in the matching placebo group) the study was considered to 
have 90% power to detect a 0.15 L difference in terms of absolute change from baseline in pre-
bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12 at the 2 tailed significance level of α = 0.05. The study also enrolled 
OCS-maintenance patients treated with 300 mg q2w regimen with a cap of 48 patients (approximately 
10% of the total population). The overall study recruitment continued until at least 384 non-OCS-
maintenance type 2 inflammatory patients have been randomized. In addition, a maximum of 48 OCS-
maintenance patients were planned to be enrolled. Considering that non-OCS-maintenance non-type 2

inflammatory patients were enrolled in this study prior to implementation of the amended protocol 02, 
the study includes approximately 54 non-OCS-maintenance non-type 2 inflammatory patients.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Participants were randomized in an automated manner to either dupilumab or matching placebo 
treatment, following specific stratification rules in order to avoid treatment assignment bias and 
confounding effects of age, eosinophil count, country, and baseline OCS maintenance.  
Randomization was stratified by age (<18 years, ≥18 years), central lab blood eosinophil count at 
screening (<150 cells/μL, 150-299 /cells/μL, and ≥300 cells/μL), baseline OCS maintenance (yes or 
no), and region (China versus non-China).  
Dupilumab and placebo were provided in identically matched 2 mL or 1.14 mL pre-filled syringes. Both 
the patient and Investigator were blinded to assigned active drug or placebo, but not to the dose levels 
due to different volume sizes. Study patients, Investigators, and study site personnel did not have 
access to the treatment codes except for emergency unblinding. 
Statistical Methods 
Analysis population 
The efficacy endpoints were primarily based on the type 2 inflammatory population not on OCS 
maintenance defined as all randomized non-OCS maintenance patients with central lab blood 
eosinophils count at screening ≥150 cells/μL or FENO level at screening ≥25 ppb. The Sponsor 
performed additional analysis on the population with blood eosinophils count ≥150 cells/μL at 
screening and on the combination of type 2 inflammatory population not on OCS maintenance and OCS 
maintenance population. The efficacy analyses were conducted according to the treatment group 
allocated by randomization. The analysis population for the safety endpoints were the safety 
population, defined as all randomized patients exposed to study medication, regardless of the amount 
of treatment administered. The safety analyses were conducted according to the treatment that 
patients actually received. 
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint 
The absolute change from baseline in FEV1 at Week 12 were analyzed using a mixed-effect model with 
repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The model included change from baseline FEV1 values up to 
Week 12 as response variables, and factors for treatment, age, sex, height, screening blood eosinophil 
level (<300 cells/μL or ≥300 cells/μL), screening FENO level (<25 ppb or ≥25 ppb), baseline OCS 
maintenance (yes or no, if applicable), region (China versus non-China), baseline ICS dose level 
(medium or high), visit, treatment by-visit interaction, baseline FEV1 value, and baseline-by-visit 
interaction as covariates. An unstructured correlation matrix was used to model the within-patient 
errors. Parameters will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood method using the Newton-
Raphson algorithm. Statistical inferences on treatment comparisons for the change from baseline in 
FEV1 at Week 12 were derived from the mixed-effect model. For patients discontinuing the treatment 
before Week 12, off study-treatment FEV1 values measured up to Week 12 were included in the 
primary analysis. 
Multiplicity considerations 
The hypothesis on the primary efficacy endpoint of absolute change from baseline in pre-
bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12 in type 2 inflammatory population not on OCS maintenance were 
controlled with a two-sided type I error of 0.05. If the primary endpoint is significant at the 0.05 level,

the secondary endpoints in the hierarchy was tested following the hierarchical testing procedure with a 
pre-specified order, that is, inferential conclusions about successive secondary endpoints require 
statistical significance at the 0.05 significance level of the prior one (see SAP).  
Analysis of secondary endpoints 
The annualized rate of severe exacerbation events was analyzed using a negative binomial regression 
model. The model will include the total number of events occurring during the 24 week treatment 
period as the response variable, with the treatment group, age, screening blood eosinophil level (<300 
cells/μL or ≥300 cells/μL), screening FENO level (<25 ppb or ≥25 ppb), baseline OCS maintenance 
(yes or no, if applicable), region (China versus non-China), baseline ICS dose level (medium or high), 
and number of severe exacerbation events within 1 year prior to the study as covariates. Log 
transformed treatment duration will be the offset variable. The annualized rate of exacerbation events, 
including severe exacerbation events resulting in hospitalization or emergency room visit and LOAC 
events, will be analyzed with a similar methodology as for the severe exacerbation events. 
Time to first event (eg, severe exacerbation, LOAC) will be analyzed using a Cox regression model with 
time to event as the dependent variable, and treatment, age, region, screening blood eosinophil level 
(<300 cells/μL or ≥300 cells/μL), screening FENO level (<25 ppb or ≥25 ppb), baseline OCS 
maintenance (yes or no, if applicable), baseline ICS dose level (medium or high), and number of 
severe exacerbation events within 1 year prior to the study as covariates. The Kaplan-Meier method 
will be used to derive the proportion of patients with a severe asthma exacerbation event at Weeks 12 
and 24, specific to each treatment group. The change from baseline for continuous endpoints will be 
analyzed using a MMRM in the same fashion as for the endpoint of FEV1. Sex and height will be 
included as covariates only in the models for spirometry parameters. The safety variables, including 
AEs, laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECG, and physical examinations will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. 
Results 
A total of 1022 participants were screened for study eligibility and 486 were enrolled, with a screen 
failure rate of 52.4%. The most common reason for screen failure was failure to meet inclusion 
criterion I01B (16.0%): pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ≤ 80% of predicted normal for adults and ≤90% of 
predicted normal for adolescents at the screening visit and the randomization visit (Visits 1 and 2), 
prior to randomization. A total of 486 participants (ITT population) were randomized to study 
intervention: 242 in the overall dupilumab group and 244 in the overall placebo group (Table 3). The 
primary analysis population of the study was the type 2 inflammatory asthma population without OCS 
maintenance (referred to as the type 2 non-OCS maintenance population hereafter) and was 
comprised of 414 participants (85.2% of the ITT population), including 205 participants in the 
dupilumab 200 mg q2w group and 209 participants in the matching placebo group. The OCS 
maintenance population was comprised of 35 participants, with 17 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group 
and 18 in the matching placebo group. There were 37 participants without type 2 inflammation or OCS 
maintenance, with 20 in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w group and 17 in the matching placebo group. 
Participant flow 
A total of 236 (97.5%) participants in the overall dupilumab group and 230 (94.3%) participants in the 
overall placebo group completed the study period. Participants who permanently discontinued the 
study intervention were encouraged to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits.

Overall population 
The efficacy of dupilumab in this study was primarily evaluated in the Type 2 non-OCS maintenance 
population. Efficacy was also evaluated in the population on OCS maintenance. Dupilumab treatment 
added to standard of care background therapy of medium to high dose ICS plus 1 or 2 additional 
controllers improved lung function (pre-bronchodilator FEV1) and asthma control (ACQ-5 score); and 
both of these improvements were statistically significant and clinically meaningful in a multiplicity-
controlled analysis conducted in the Type 2 non-OCS maintenance population. 
• Pre-bronchodilator FEV1: compared to the matching placebo group, the dupilumab 200 mg q2w 
group showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in pre-bronchodilator 
FEV1 at Week 12 in the Type 2 non-OCS maintenance population. At 12 weeks, the least squares (LS) 
mean difference in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 change from baseline with dupilumab 200 mg q2w 
compared with placebo was 0.31 L, with a 95% CI of 0.23 to 0.39 (p<0.0001) in the Type 2 non-OCS 
maintenance population. The robustness of the primary endpoint finding was confirmed by multiple 
sensitivity analyses and supplementary analyses. 
• ACQ-5: dupilumab 200 mg q2w improved asthma control, as demonstrated by a statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful greater reduction (improvement) from baseline in ACQ-5 score at 
Week 24 compared with placebo, with a LS mean difference versus placebo of -0.20 (95% CI: -0.35 to 
-0.05, p=0.0097) in the Type 2 non-OCS maintenance population. 
• Severe exacerbation rate: dupilumab 200 mg q2w reduced the risk of severe asthma 
exacerbations compared to placebo by 62.0% (nominal p=0.0020) and delayed the time to 
first severe exacerbation event (hazard ratio [HR]=0.359 [95% CI: 0.195 to 0.658], nominal 
p=0.0009) compared to placebo. The risk of severe exacerbation events resulting in hospitalization or 
emergency room visit was also numerically reduced by 57.7% (nominal p=0.0748) compared to 
placebo. The onset of action of dupilumab 200 mg q2w was rapid across multiple efficacy endpoints, 
with a substantial difference versus placebo observed in many cases as early as 2 weeks after initiation 
of treatment and a continued improvement sustained through Week 24. For the OCS maintenance 
population treated with dupilumab 300 mg q2w, similar trends of improvement in lung function, 
improved asthma control, and consistent reduced asthma exacerbations were observed compared to 
placebo. 
Adolescent 
For the single adolescent participant, the absolute change in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline 
(2.76 L) to Week 12 (3.42 L) was 0.66 L; the reduction (improvement) in ACQ-5 score from baseline 
(2.80) to Week 24 (0.20) was 2.60; and no severe asthma exacerbation events were reported for the 
single adolescent participant during the study. 
Safety results 
EXPOSURE 
Overall population 
The majority of participants (74.3% and 72.0% in the overall dupilumab group and the overall placebo 
group, respectively) received a total of 13 injections, corresponding to the planned treatment duration 
of 24 weeks.

Adolescent 
The single adolescent participant received 9 injections of dupilumab 200 mg q2w and missed injections 
on Week 4, Week 6, Week 8 (reasons unknown for these 3 missing injections), and Week 22 (due to 
COVID-19). 
Overall population 
In EFC13995, dupilumab was well tolerated across both studied doses (dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 
300 mg q2w) in participants with asthma and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile consistent 
with the known dupilumab safety profile. No new safety concerns were identified. The percentages of 
participants with any treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar between intervention 
groups (203 [84.2%] participants in the combined dupilumab group versus 190 [78.2%] participants 
in the combined placebo group). 
The highest overall incidence of TEAEs reported by SOC was Infections and Infestations, with a similar 
incidence between the combined dupilumab group and the combined placebo group (129 [53.5%] 
versus 127 [52.3%]). Under this SOC, the 3 most common TEAEs by preferred term (PT) were Upper 
respiratory tract infection (62 [25.7%] versus 62 [25.5%]) and Nasopharyngitis (14 [5.8%] versus 13 
[5.3%]), both with balanced rates between the combined dupilumab and the combined placebo 
groups, and Pneumonia (3 [1.2%] versus 13 [5.3%]) with lower incident rate in the combined 
dupilumab group compared to the combined placebo group. The percentages of participants with any 
treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) were similar between intervention groups (21 
[8.7%] participants in the combined dupilumab group versus 23 [9.5%] participants in the combined 
placebo group). The incidence of TEAEs leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation as per 
the Investigator was low in both intervention groups, including 4 [1.7%] participants in the combined 
dupilumab group with PTs: Pneumonia, Arthralgia, Thyroiditis, and Cor pulmonale chronic and 2 
[0.8%] participants in the combined placebo group with PTs: Rash and Thrombocytopenia. The 
incidence of adverse events of special interest (AESIs) was similar in the combined dupilumab group 
(10 [4.1%]) and the combined placebo group (9 [3.7%]), including hypersensitivity reactions 
(medically reviewed) (6 [2.5%] versus 4 [1.6%]) and severe or serious infections (4 [1.7%] versus 6 
[2.5%]). 
Eosinophilia (PT) was reported in 6 (2.5%) participants in the combined dupilumab group and none in 
the combined placebo group. Eosinophil count increased (PT) was reported in 1 (0.4%) participant in 
the combined dupilumab group and 4 (1.6%) participants in the combined placebo group. All these 
events were asymptomatic. None of the events were serious or led to permanent study intervention 
discontinuation. 
Adolescent 
In the single adolescent participant in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w group, 2 mild, non-serious AEs 
(Epistaxis and Rhinitis allergic) were reported. Neither of the events were assessed as related to 
dupilumab by the Investigator. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
According to Article 46 requirements, the MAH submitted paediatric study data of a single adolescent 
participant that had been included in study EFC13995, a multinational, multicenter, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, Phase 3 study which assessed the effect of dupilumab 
as an add-on therapy in participants with persistent asthma over a treatment period of 24 weeks by bi-
weekly subcutaneous injections. This study was conducted to support the registration of the dupilumab

asthma indication in China and was conducted in 67 centers in China and India. Overall, 486 
participants were enrolled.  
The primary analysis population of the study was the type 2 inflammatory asthma population without 
OCS maintenance. The single adolescent participant, however, was enrolled in the dupilumab 200 mg 
q2w group and belonged to the subgroup of 37 patients who neither had evidence of Type 2 
inflammation nor were receiving OCS maintenance. 
As this is an individual case, very sparse data is available and no meaningful conclusion on efficacy and 
safety is to be drawn. The provided efficacy and safety results of this single patient, who received 9/13 
injections, indicate an adequate efficacy and acceptable safety.  
2.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Data from one single patient was provided that do not raise specific concerns. However, the provided 
case report is not more than of informative character.

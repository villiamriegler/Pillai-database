Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for azacitidine (injectable 
formulations), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on risk(s) from clinical trial(s), the literature, spontaneous reports including in 
some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge and in view of a 
plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between 
azacitidine and differentiation syndrome is at least reasonable possibility. The PRAC Rapporteur 
concluded that the product information of products containing azacitidine should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for azacitidine (injectable formulations) the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing azacitidine is unchanged 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

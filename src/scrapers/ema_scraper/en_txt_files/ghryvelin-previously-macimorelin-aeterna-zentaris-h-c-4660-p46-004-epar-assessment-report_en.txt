Study No.: AEZS-130-P01 
Title of trial: Open label, group comparison, dose escalation trial to investigate safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of macimorelin acetate after single oral dosing of 
0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg in pediatric patients with suspected growth hormone deficiency 
(GHD). 
Description 
Methods 
Objective 
Primary: 
−  To investigate the safety and tolerability of macimorelin acetate after ascending single oral doses 
of macimorelin (0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg) in pediatric patients with suspected growth 
hormone deficiency (GHD). 
Secondary: 
−  To investigate the PK of macimorelin acetate in pediatric patients with suspected GHD, 
−  To investigate the PD of macimorelin acetate as measured by growth hormone (GH) release in 
pediatric patients with suspected GHD, 
−  To explore the PK/PD relationship following single oral dose administration of macimorelin acetate 
in pediatric patients with suspected GHD. 
Study design 
This is an open label, group-comparison, single dose, dose-escalation, multicenter trial that was 
performed in pediatric patients in whom, based on auxological and clinical criteria, a provocative 
growth hormone stimulation test (GHST) was indicated as part of the diagnostic work-up of a 
suspected growth hormone deficiency (GHD).  
The investigational macimorelin GHST was performed after the first standard GHST had been 
completed. A recovery period of at least 1 week and a maximum of 4 weeks was introduced between 
GHSTs to avoid carry-over effects or interference between subsequent GHSTs and to provide an 
adequate follow-up period for observation of possibly drug-related adverse events to the previously 
used provocative agents. 
Sequential cohorts of trial participants received macimorelin at ascending single oral doses, ranging 
from 0.25 mg/kg body weight, which is 50% of the dose used for testing in adults, up to a planned 
maximum of 1 mg/kg body weight (which is 50% of the highest tested and well tolerated dose in 
adults). 
For determination of the macimorelin PK and PD (GH stimulation) profile, blood samples were collected 
pre-dose, then 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 360 minutes after the administration of macimorelin. 
The dose titration program was reconsidered after completion of each dose step and would proceed 
only if the previous dose step reviewed and confirmed by Data Review Committee (DRC) had shown 
acceptable safety and tolerability.

The selection, performance and evaluation of standard GHSTs followed the established procedures of 
each participating institution. However, blood samples for GH were analysed at the central laboratory. 
The analysis of serum samples for GH concentration were carried out at a central laboratory by a 
validated immunochemiluminometric assay (IDS-iSYS Human Growth Hormone, Immunodiagnostic 
Systems Ltd [UK]) (Manolopoulou et al., 2012). This assay is standardized to the recombinant growth 
hormone calibration standard WHO 98/574, and complies with recommendations on assay 
standardization as outlined by Clemmons (Clemmons et al., 2011). 
Study population /Sample size 
24 pediatric patients with suspected GHD (8 patients per dose group) were enrolled. Of these 8 
patients, at least 3 patients per dose group were pre-pubertal (Tanner Stage I) and pubertal (Tanner 
Stage II-IV), respectively.

Batch number: C1810001 
Reference therapy, dose and mode of administration, batch number: 
Two standard growth hormone stimulation tests (sGHSTs) had to be performed in a patient according 
to local practice. The sGHST agents were considered as ‘background’ and not as IMPs. 
The following pharmacological agents were accepted for sGHSTs: insulin (insulin tolerance test (ITT)), 
arginine, arginine/growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), clonidine, glucagon, L-dopa. 
Single dose of an sGHST agent was administered i.m./i.v./s.c. or peroral (depending on formulation) 
on the day of the sGHST. sGHST agents were taken from the sites’ pharmacy stocks. Batch numbers 
were recorded on-site in Patient Records and ‘standard GHST Patients Accountability Logs’.

Statistical Methods 
All statistical analyses were considered exploratory in nature. Datasets were analyzed using SAS 
version 9.3 or above. 
In general, summary statistics (n, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum) for quantitative variables and frequency tables for qualitative data are presented by dose 
group. 
Macimorelin PK: PK parameters were analyzed for the PK Analysis Set (PKS) and are summarized by n 
(number of measurements), arithmetic mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation (CV), 
median, minimum, maximum value and, in addition (Tmax excluded) by geometric mean, geometric 
standard deviation, and geometric CV. For Tmax additionally frequency counts as well as median, 
minimum, and maximum are presented. 
Macimorelin PD: irrespective of the availability of PK data, GH concentration data were analyzed for the 
PD Analysis Set (PDS). GH peak concentrations were correlated with the outcome of the clinical 
diagnostic procedure (diagnosis of GHD confirmed or not confirmed). 
PK/PD Analysis: Plasma concentrations of macimorelin of individual patients were correlated with the 
respective GH concentrations at the same time points, as well as the outcome of the clinical diagnostic 
procedure (diagnosis of GHD confirmed or not confirmed). 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Out of a total of 27 patients screened, 24 patients were administered the macimorelin test, with 8 
patients in each of the three dosing cohorts (C1, C2, and C3). 
Thus, the safety population (SAF) as well as the PK analysis set (PKS), PD analysis set (PDS), and 
PK/PD set consisted of 24 patients. 
Baseline data 
In total, 17 (70.8%) of patients were male, 7 (29.2%) female, and 100% were of white origin. At 
screening, the median parameters for all three dosing cohorts were for age 10.5 years (range: 4 – 15 
years), height 123.35 cm (range: 46.0 – 152.5 cm), weight 25.5 kg (range: 12 – 43 kg) and body 
mass index (BMI) 16.1 kg/m2 (range: 12.4– 21.4 kg/m2).

The Tanner status was distributed as following: in C1 as well as C3, 4 patients showed Tanner I and 4 
patients Tanner II , and in C2 5 patients showed Tanner I and 3 patients Tanner II. Sex steroid 
priming was applied in two male patients in C3 by i.m. administration of a testosterone depot 
preparation. 
Concerning the baseline medical history, only for two patients in C2 a deficiency of other pituitary axes 
(i.e., thyroidal deficiency) was reported. As part of the standard ‘diagnostic work-up’, IGF-1 and IGF-
BP3 values were captured in the electronic case report form (eCRF) as collected according to the local 
diagnostic standard. IGF-1 values were presented for 7 patients in C1, and for 8 patients each in C2 
and C3, with a median of 88.00 μg/L (SD 68.72) in C1, 100.00 μg/L (SD 97.90) in C2, and 119.50 
μg/L (SD 68.88) in C3. IGF-BP3 values became available for one patient in C3. 
The bone age showed in median a value of 102.2 months (range: 24 – 156 months). As part of 
auxology parameters, height SDS was in median -2.35 (range -3.2 – 1.7), BMI SDS -0.60 (range -2.1 
– 2.0), and annualized height velocity SDS -1.50 (range: -3.3 – 0.5). 
Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) results 
Pharmacokinetic results: 
The AUCs and Cmax of macimorelin show a dose-dependent increase with an arithmetic mean AUC0-6 
of 6.69 h*ng/mL in C1, 18.02 h*ng/mL in C2, 30.92 h*ng/mL in C3, and an arithmetic mean Cmax of 
3.46 ng/mL in C1, 8.13 ng/mL in C2, and 12.87 ng/mL in C3 (Table 1). 
Mean Tmax is comparable between all three groups with an arithmetic mean of 45.5 min in C1, 40.6 
min in C2, and 31.9 min in C3. Mean T1/2 shows a slight increase with higher doses, i.e. 73.18 min in 
C1, 96.31 min in C2, and 102.85 min in C3. 
Table 1: Summary of main pharmacokinetic parameters of macimorelin (PK Set, N=24) 
Pharmacodynamic results: 
Following macimorelin administration, peak GH levels were observed in C1 within 0.5 – 1 h (mean 
Tmax at 52.5 min (SD 11.3)), in C2 within 0.25 – 1 h (mean Tmax 37.5 min (SD 13.9)) , and in C3 
within 0.5 – 0.75 h (mean Tmax 37.5 min (SD 8.0)) (cf. Table 2).

Table 2: Summary of pharmacodynamic parameters/ peak GH levels (PK/PD Set, N=24) 
Exploratory Analyses for the GH cut-off point: 
Peak GH values by GHD diagnosis were compared based on GHST results and investigator’s 
assessment. Diagnostic characteristics of GH values (i.e. sensitivity, specificity, and Youden indices 
(non-weighted, weighted)) tested as cut-off points were listed with the most solid expression of 
diagnostic characteristics to be noted for C1 at a peak GH of 10.03 ng/mL, for C2 at a peak GH of 
10.43 ng/mL, and for C3 at 17.13 ng/mL. 
Furthermore, the diagnostic results can be summarized as following (Table 3): the macimorelin GHST 
shows ‘GHD not confirmed’ only in 1 (9.09%) patient in C2 from overall 11 patients assessed as ‘GHD’ 
by the investigator in all three cohorts. 
From a total of 13 patients assessed by the investigator as ‘not confirmed’ of having GHD, the 
macimorelin GHST confirmed GHD in 3 (23.08%) patients in C1 and in 1 (7.69%) patient in C3, 
respectively.

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Analysis 
For all GH cut-off points tested, the ROC curve for C1 shows the lowest sensitivity and specificity if 
being compared with C2 and C3 (Figure 2). The related area under the curve (AUC) is increasing with 
ascending dose. 
Figure 2: ROC of Macimorelin GHST by Cohort (PDS, N=24) 
When comparing the characteristics of GH cut-off points between the three cohorts, the cut-off point of 
17.130 ng/mL GH for C3 shows the strongest test characteristics with a sensitivity of 1.0, specificity of 
0.8, Youden indices ≥ 0.80, and a ROC AUC of 0.93 (cf. Table 4). 
A sensitivity analysis was performed observing the ROC AUC development based on the test outcome 
of the sGHSTs categorized as ‘confirmed’ vs. ‘not-confirmed’. Again, strongest test characteristics are 
expressed for C3, with e.g. a sensitivity of 1.00, specificity of 0.80, and a ROC AUC of 0.933, in 
comparison with C2 (sensitivity 0.75, specificity 0.75, ROC AUC 0.563) and C1 (sensitivity 1.0, 
specificity o.71, ROC AUC 0.714). 
Table 4: Summary of ROC Analysis: AUC and Characteristics of Cut-off Points by Cohort 
(PDS, N=24) 
PK and PD Summary 
Overall, the macimorelin PK and PD of C1, C2, and C3 show comparable profiles: 
• the macimorelin Tmax is comparable for all three groups with mean Tmax values of about 0.5–0.75 h 
• the mean macimorelin Cmax shows a dose-proportional increase; 
• the AUC increases with the macimorelin dose; 
• maximum GH release is observed at 0.25 – 2 h after macimorelin administration, with mean Tmax 
values of about 0.5 – 1 h.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Maximum values for AUC and Cmax are observed in C3 at a macimorelin dosing of 1.0 mg/kg body 
weight. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis supports the dosing in C3 with strongest test 
characteristics expressed at a cut-off point of approximately 17 ng/mL GH, with a specificity of 0.80, a 
sensitivity of 1.00, a Youden-index of 0.80 and an ROC AUC of 0.933. 
Safety results 
Overall, all three macimorelin doses (i.e. 0.25 mg/kg in Cohort 1 (C1), 0.5 mg/kg in Cohort 2 (C2), 
and 1 mg/kg in Cohort 3 (C3) were found to be safe and well tolerated in the pediatric population 
observed. Not any TEAE was reported in causal relationship to macimorelin. Especially, neither 
vomiting nor nausea were to be noted in children after swallowing of the macimorelin suspension. 
No SAEs or serious TEAEs were reported in the course of this trial. 
In adult trials, the most frequently reported adverse events judged likely related to oral macimorelin 
0.5 mg/kg were dysgeusia (7%), diarrhea and headache (2% each). In the pediatric population 
observed, bitter taste was commented by two patients in C3 on the GHST Tolerability Questionnaire. 
These comments were not assessed as AEs by the investigator but as characteristic of the suspension 
only and thus considered as a technical complaint. 
Clinical laboratory, vital signs, physical findings, ECG: 
No clinically significant changes were observed for the safety clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs 
and physical examination. No clinically significant abnormalities and no significant changes in ECG 
parameters were described. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This trial was performed to investigate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of macimorelin acetate after 
single oral dosing of 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1.0 mg/kg in pediatric patients with suspected 
growth hormone deficiency (GHD). Furthermore, it served to identify a suitable macimorelin dose for 
further testing in a test validation trial, and to explore a GH cut-off point for testing. 
In general, the PK parameters in the pediatric population were in a similar range to those in adults. 
Tmax of macimorelin was comparable for all three groups with mean Tmax values of about 0.5–0.75 h. 
A dose-dependent increase of macimorelin Cmax (3.46 vs. 8.13 vs. 12.87 ng/mL) as well as of the 
mean AUC0-6h (6.69 vs. 18.02 vs. 30.92 h*ng/mL) was observed. The elimination half-lives t1/2 were in 
the range of 1.25 – 1.75 h. Maximum GH release occurred at 0.25 – 2 h after macimorelin 
administration, with mean Tmax values of about 0.5 – 1 h. 
A macimorelin dose of 0.25 mg/kg (C1) has not resulted in a maximum stimulation of GH secretion in 
children, which becomes evident in the review of PK/PD data as well as comparison with the 
agreement between an explored GH cut-off point versus PI assessment and results of sGHSTs. 
A dose of 0.5 mg/kg (C2) showed strong GH release, a high level of agreement between the principal 
investigator (PI) assessment based on the macimorelin GHST vs. sGHST as well as a ROC AUC of 0.80.  
However, a dose of 1.0 mg/kg (C3) appears to lead to a more consistent, strong GH stimulation, most 
probably due to sufficiently high macimorelin exposure in all subjects. 
Finally, the sensitivity analysis supports a dose of 1.0 mg/kg (C3) with strongest test characteristics 
expressed at a cut-off point of approximately 17 ng/mL GH, with a specificity of 0.80, a sensitivity of 
1.00, a Youden-index of 0.80 and a ROC AUC of 0.93.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
In all three dosing cohorts, i.e. 0.25 mg/kg body weight in Cohort 1 (C1), 0.5 mg/kg body weight in 
Cohort 2 (C2), and 1 mg/kg body weight in Cohort 3 (C3), macimorelin has shown good safety and 
tolerability without any TEAEs or SAEs reported in the course of this trial. The PK/PD profiles are in a 
range expected from the adult development program. The overall characterization of macimorelin in 
this first pediatric trial supports the choice of a macimorelin dose of 1.0 mg/kg for the investigation in 
a Phase 3 trial on test validity. 
Recommendation 
The regulatory requirement according to Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 which sets out 
the obligation for marketing-authorisation holders (MAHs) to submit any MAH-sponsored studies 
involving the use of an authorised medicinal product in the paediatric population to the competent 
authority, whether or not they are part of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP), has been: 
  Fulfilled: 
No further regulatory action required.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
ISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the
treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.
Posology
ISENTRESS should be used in combination with other active anti-retroviral therapies (ARTs) (see
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Adults
The recommended dosage is 400 mg (one tablet) twice daily.
Paediatric population
The recommended dosage for paediatric patients of at least 25 kg body weight is 400 mg (one tablet)
twice daily. If unable to swallow a tablet, consider the chewable tablet.
Additional formulations and strengths available:
ISENTRESS is also available in a chewable tablet formulation and in granules for oral suspension
formulation Refer to the chewable tablet and granules for oral suspension SmPCs for additional dosing
information.
The safety and efficacy of raltegravir in preterm (<37 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight
(<2,000 g) newborns have not been established. No data are available in this population and no dosing
recommendations can be made.
The maximum dose of the chewable tablet is 300 mg twice daily. Because the formulations have
different pharmacokinetic profiles neither the chewable tablets nor the granules for oral suspension
should be substituted for the 400 mg tablet or 600 mg tablet (see section 5.2). The chewable tablets
2
and the granules for oral suspension have not been studied in HIV-infected adolescents (12 to
18 years) or adults.
ISENTRESS is also available for adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg), as a 600 mg
tablet to be administered as 1,200 mg once daily (two 600 mg tablets) for treatment-naïve patients or
patients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily.
The 400 mg tablet should not be used to administer the 1,200 mg once daily regimen. Refer to the
600 mg Summary of Product Characteristics for additional dosing information.
Elderly
There is limited information regarding the use of raltegravir in the elderly (see section 5.2). Therefore,
ISENTRESS should be used with caution in this population.
Renal impairment
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The safety
and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders.
Therefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see
sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Method of administration
Oral use.
ISENTRESS 400 mg tablets can be administered with or without food.
The tablets should not be chewed, crushed or split due to anticipated changes in the pharmacokinetic
profile.
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
General
Patients should be advised that current anti-retroviral therapy does not cure HIV and has not been
proven to prevent the transmission of HIV to others through blood contact. 
Raltegravir has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance. Therefore, whenever possible, raltegravir
should be administered with two other active ARTs to minimise the potential for virological failure
and the development of resistance (see section 5.1).
In treatment-naïve patients, the clinical study data on use of raltegravir are limited to use in
combination with two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (emtricitabine and tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate).
Depression
Depression, including suicidal ideation and behaviours, has been reported, particularly in patients with
a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Caution should be used in patients with a
pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness.
3
Hepatic impairment
The safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver
disorders. Therefore, raltegravir should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic
impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased frequency of
liver function abnormalities during combination anti-retroviral therapy and should be monitored
according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients,
interruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination anti-retroviral therapy are at an
increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.
Osteonecrosis
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been
reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination
anti-retroviral therapy. Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches
and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.
Immune reactivation syndrome
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination anti-
retroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic
pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically,
such reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant
examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and
pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any
inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to
occur in the setting of immune reactivation: however, the reported time to onset is more variable and
these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
Antacids
Co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and magnesium antacids resulted in reduced
raltegravir plasma levels. Co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium antacids
is not recommended (see section 4.5).
Rifampicin
Caution should be used when co-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of uridine diphosphate
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces plasma levels of
raltegravir; the impact on the efficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if co-administration with
rifampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of the dose of raltegravir can be considered in adults. There are
no data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in patients below 18 years of age (see
section 4.5). 
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had
myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal
products associated with these conditions (see section 4.8).
4
Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions
Severe, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported in patients taking
raltegravir, in most cases concomitantly with other medicinal products associated with these reactions.
These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity
reactions have also been reported and were characterised by rash, constitutional findings, and
sometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue raltegravir and other suspect
agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop
(including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue,
muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia,
angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate
therapy initiated. Delay in stopping raltegravir treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of
severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.
Rash
Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing
raltegravir and darunavir compared to patients receiving raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir
without raltegravir (see section 4.8).
Lactose
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In vitro studies indicate that raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, does
not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A, does not inhibit
UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A1 and 2B7, does not induce CYP3A4 and does not inhibit
P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Based on these data, raltegravir is not expected to affect the
pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or P-glycoprotein.
Based on in vitro and in vivo studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a
UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway.
Considerable inter- and intra-individual variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of
raltegravir.
Effect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products
In interaction studies, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics
of etravirine, maraviroc, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, hormonal contraceptives, methadone,
midazolam or boceprevir. 
In some studies, co-administration of raltegravir with darunavir resulted in a modest decrease in
darunavir plasma concentrations; the mechanism for this effect is unknown. However, the effect of
raltegravir on darunavir plasma concentrations does not appear to be clinically meaningful.
5
Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir
Given that raltegravir is metabolised primarily via UGT1A1, caution should be used when
co-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of UGT1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces
plasma levels of raltegravir; the impact on the efficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if
co-administration with rifampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of the dose of raltegravir can be
considered in adults. There are no data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in
patients below 18 years of age (see section 4.4). The impact of other strong inducers of drug
metabolizing enzymes, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, on UGT1A1 is unknown. Less potent
inducers (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, rifabutin, glucocorticoids, St. John's wort,
pioglitazone) may be used with the recommended dose of raltegravir.
Co-administration of raltegravir with medicinal products that are known to be potent UGT1A1
inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir) may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Less potent UGT1A1 inhibitors
(e.g., indinavir, saquinavir) may also increase plasma levels of raltegravir, but to a lesser extent
compared with atazanavir. In addition, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may increase plasma levels of
raltegravir, however, the mechanism for this effect is unknown (see Table 1). From the clinical trials, a
large proportion of patients used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, both agents that
result in increases in raltegravir plasma levels, in the optimised background regimens. The safety
profile observed in patients who used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was generally
similar to the safety profile of patients who did not use these agents. Therefore, no dose adjustment is
required.
Co-administration of raltegravir with antacids containing divalent metal cations may reduce raltegravir
absorption by chelation, resulting in a decrease of raltegravir plasma levels. Taking an aluminium and
magnesium antacid within 6 hours of raltegravir administration significantly decreased raltegravir
plasma levels. Therefore, co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium
containing antacids is not recommended. Co-administration of raltegravir with a calcium carbonate
antacid decreased raltegravir plasma levels; however, this interaction is not considered clinically
meaningful. Therefore, when raltegravir is co-administered with calcium carbonate containing
antacids no dose adjustment is required.
Co-administration of raltegravir with other agents that increase gastric pH (e.g., omeprazole and
famotidine) may increase the rate of raltegravir absorption and result in increased plasma levels of
raltegravir (see Table 1). Safety profiles in the subgroup of patients in Phase III trials taking proton
pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists were comparable with those who were not taking these antacids.
Therefore, no dose adjustment is required with use of proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists.
All interaction studies were performed in adults.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
A large amount of data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily during the
first trimester (more than 1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes) indicates no malformative toxicity.
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily
during the second and/or third trimester (between 300-1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes)
indicates no increased risk of feto/neonatal toxicity.
Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily can be used during pregnancy if clinically needed.
Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry
To monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients inadvertently administered raltegravir while pregnant,
an Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register
patients in this registry.
As a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in
pregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn,
the animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in
order to characterise the safety for the foetus.
9
Breast-feeding
Raltegravir/metabolites are excreted in human milk to such an extent that effects on the breastfed
newborns/infants are likely. Available pharmacodynamics/toxicological data in animals have shown
excretion of raltegravir/metabolites in milk (for details see section 5.3).
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.
It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid
transmission of HIV.
Fertility
No effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in
3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose.
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Dizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens containing raltegravir.
Dizziness may influence some patients' ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8).
4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In randomised clinical trials raltegravir 400 mg twice daily was administered in combination with
fixed or optimised background treatment regimens to treatment-naïve (N=547) and treatment-
experienced (N=462) adults for up to 96 weeks. A further 531 treatment-naïve adults have received
raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for up to
96 weeks. See section 5.1.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache, nausea and
abdominal pain. The most frequently reported serious adverse reaction was immune reconstitution
syndrome and rash. The rates of discontinuation of raltegravir due to adverse reactions were 5% or less
in clinical trials.
Rhabdomyolysis was an uncommonly reported serious adverse reaction in post-marketing use of
raltegravir 400 mg twice daily.
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions
Cancers were reported in treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve patients who initiated raltegravir
in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. The types and rates of specific cancers were those
expected in a highly immunodeficient population. The risk of developing cancer in these studies was
similar in the groups receiving raltegravir and in the groups receiving comparators.
Grade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in patients treated with raltegravir.
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had
myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal
products associated with these conditions (see section 4.4).
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic
infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have
also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur
many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).
For each of the following clinical adverse reactions there was at least one serious occurrence: genital
herpes, anaemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, depression, mental disorder, suicide attempt,
gastritis, hepatitis, renal failure, accidental overdose.
In clinical studies of treatment-experienced patients, rash, irrespective of causality, was more
commonly observed with regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to those containing
raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir. Rash considered by the investigator to
be drug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9,
4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3
per 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity
and did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).
Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus
In clinical trials, there were 79 patients co-infected with hepatitis B, 84 co-infected with hepatitis C,
and 8 patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C who were treated with raltegravir in combination
with other agents for HIV-1. In general, the safety profile of raltegravir in patients with hepatitis B
and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in patients without hepatitis B and/or
hepatitis C virus co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were somewhat
higher in the subgroup co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus.
At 96-weeks, in treatment-experienced patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that
represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29 %, 34 % and
13 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 11 %, 10 % and 9 %
of all other patients treated with raltegravir. At 240-weeks, in treatment-naïve patients, Grade 2 or
higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total
bilirubin occurred in 22 %, 44 % and 17 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with
raltegravir as compared to 13 %, 13 % and 5 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir.
Paediatric population
Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age
Raltegravir has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and
adolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066
(see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of raltegravir.
13
In these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions
through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.
One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity,
abnormal behaviour and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic
rash.
One patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which
were considered serious.
Infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age
Raltegravir has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than
2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1
and 5.2).
In these 26 infants and toddlers, the frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions
through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.
One patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment
discontinuation.
HIV-1 Exposed Neonates
In IMPAACT P1110 (see section 5.2) eligible infants were at least 37 weeks gestation and at least 2 kg
in weight. Sixteen (16) neonates received 2 doses of ISENTRESS in first 2 weeks of life, and
26 neonates received 6 weeks of daily dosing; all were followed for 24 weeks. There were no drug
related clinical adverse experiences and three drug-related laboratory adverse experiences (one a
transient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine containing prevention of mother to
child transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered
non-serious and not requiring specific therapy). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with raltegravir.
In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the standard supportive measures, e.g., remove
unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an
electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. It should be taken into account that
raltegravir is presented for clinical use as the potassium salt. The extent to which raltegravir may be
dialysable is unknown.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, integrase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AJ01.
Mechanism of action
Raltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor active against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV-1). Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of integrase, an HIV-encoded enzyme that is
14
required for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of
the HIV genome into the host cell genome. HIV genomes that fail to integrate cannot direct the
production of new infectious viral particles, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral
infection. 
Antiviral activity in vitro
Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 
 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition (IC95) of HIV-1 replication
(relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the
cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, raltegravir inhibited viral replication in cultures of
mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with diverse, primary clinical
isolates of HIV-1, including isolates from 5 non-B subtypes, and isolates resistant to reverse
transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited
infection of 23 HIV isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes and 5 circulating recombinant forms with
IC50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM.
Resistance
Most viruses isolated from patients failing raltegravir had high-level raltegravir resistance resulting
from the appearance of two or more mutations in integrase. Most had a signature mutation at amino
acid 155 (N155 changed to H), amino acid 148 (Q148 changed to H, K, or R), or amino acid 143
(Y143 changed to H, C, or R), along with one or more additional integrase mutations (e.g., L74M,
E92Q, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, S230R). The signature mutations decrease viral
susceptibility to raltegravir and addition of other mutations results in a further decrease in raltegravir
susceptibility. Factors that reduced the likelihood of developing resistance included lower baseline
viral load and use of other active anti-retroviral agents. Mutations conferring resistance to raltegravir
generally also confer resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir. Mutations at
amino acid 143 confer greater resistance to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q mutation
confers greater resistance to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harbouring a mutation at amino
acid 148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance mutations, may also have clinically
significant resistance to dolutegravir.
Clinical experience
The evidence of efficacy of raltegravir was based on the analyses of 96-week data from two
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2,
Protocols 018 and 019) in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adult patients and the
analysis of 240-week data from randomised, double-blind, active-control trial (STARTMRK,
Protocol 021) in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients. 
Efficacy
Treatment-experienced adult patients
BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trials) evaluated the safety and anti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. placebo in a
combination with optimised background therapy (OBT), in HIV-infected patients, 16 years or older,
with documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs) of
anti-retroviral therapies. Prior to randomisation, OBT were selected by the investigator based on the
patient's prior treatment history, as well as baseline genotypic and phenotypic viral resistance testing.
Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the
groups receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and placebo. Patients had prior exposure to a median
of 12 anti-retrovirals for a median of 10 years. A median of 4 ARTs was used in OBT. 
Results 48 week and 96 week analyses
Durable outcomes (Week 48 and Week 96) for patients on the recommended dose raltegravir 400 mg
twice daily from the pooled studies BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are shown in Table 2.

‡
§
 For analysis by prognostic factors, virologic failures were carried forward for percent < 400 and 50 copies/mL. For mean CD4 changes, baseline-carry-
forward was used for virologic failures.
 The Genotypic Sensitivity Score (GSS) was defined as the total oral ARTs in the optimised background therapy (OBT) to which a patient's viral isolate
showed genotypic sensitivity based upon genotypic resistance test. Enfuvirtide use in OBT in enfuvirtide-naïve patients was counted as one active drug in
OBT. Similarly, darunavir use in OBT in darunavir-naïve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT.
Raltegravir achieved virologic responses (using Not Completer=Failure approach) of HIV RNA
< 50 copies/mL in 61.7 % of patients at Week 16, in 62.1 % at Week 48 and in 57.0 % at Week 96.
Some patients experienced viral rebound between Week 16 and Week 96. Factors associated with
failure include high baseline viral load and OBT that did not include at least one potent active agent.

Switch to raltegravir
The SWITCHMRK 1 & 2 (Protocols 032 & 033) studies evaluated HIV-infected patients receiving
suppressive (screening HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL; stable regimen > 3 months) therapy with lopinavir
200 mg (+) ritonavir 50 mg 2 tablets twice daily plus at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors and randomised them 1:1 to continue lopinavir (+) ritonavir 2 tablets twice daily (n=174 and
n=178, respectively) or replace lopinavir (+) ritonavir with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (n=174 and
n=176, respectively). Patients with a prior history of virological failure were not excluded and the
number of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited. 
These studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they failed to
demonstrate non-inferiority of raltegravir versus lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In both studies at Week 24,
suppression of HIV RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 84.4 % of the raltegravir group
versus 90.6 % of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group, (Non-completers = Failure). See section 4.4
regarding the need to administer raltegravir with two other active agents.
Treatment-naïve adult patients
STARTMRK (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-control trial) evaluated the safety and
anti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime, in a
combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-naïve HIV-infected
patients with HIV RNA > 5,000 copies/mL. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV RNA
level (≤ 50,000 copies/mL; and > 50,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B or C status (positive or
negative).
Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the
group receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and the group receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime. 
Results 48-week and 240-week analyses
With respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA
< 50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 241/280 (86.1 %) in the group receiving raltegravir and 230/281
(81.9 %) in the group receiving efavirenz. The treatment difference (raltegravir – efavirenz) was 4.2 %
with an associated 95 % CI of (-1.9, 10.3) establishing that raltegravir is non-inferior to efavirenz (p-
value for non-inferiority < 0.001). At Week 240, the treatment difference (raltegravir – efavirenz) was
9.5 % with an associated 95 % CI of (1.7, 17.3). Week 48 and Week 240 outcomes for patients on the
recommended dose of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily from STARTMRK are shown in Table 3.

Paediatric population
Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age
IMPAACT P1066 is a Phase I/II open label multicenter trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile,
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of raltegravir in HIV infected children. This study enrolled
126 treatment experienced children and adolescents 2 to18 years of age. Patients were stratified by
age, enrolling adolescents first and then successively younger children. Patients received either the
400 mg tablet formulation (6 to 18 years of age) or the chewable tablet formulation (2 to less than
12 years of age). Raltegravir was administered with an optimised background regimen.
The initial dose finding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Dose selection was based
upon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough concentration as seen in adults, and
acceptable short-term safety. After dose selection, additional patients were enrolled for evaluation of
long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy. Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of
raltegravir (see section 4.2).

As demonstrated in healthy volunteers administered single oral doses of raltegravir in the fasted state,
raltegravir is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 3 hours postdose. Raltegravir AUC and
Cmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Raltegravir C12 hr increases
dose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose
proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Dose proportionality has not been established
in patients.
With twice-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved rapidly, within approximately the
first 2 days of dosing. There is little to no accumulation in AUC and Cmax and evidence of slight
accumulation in C12 hr. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established.
Raltegravir may be administered with or without food. Raltegravir was administered without regard to
food in the pivotal safety and efficacy studies in HIV-infected patients. Administration of multiple
doses of raltegravir following a moderate-fat meal did not affect raltegravir AUC to a clinically
meaningful degree with an increase of 13 % relative to fasting. Raltegravir C12 hr was 66 % higher and
Cmax was 5 % higher following a moderate-fat meal compared to fasting. Administration of raltegravir
following a high-fat meal increased AUC and Cmax by approximately 2-fold and increased C12 hr by
4.1-fold. Administration of raltegravir following a low-fat meal decreased AUC and Cmax by 46 % and
52 %, respectively; C12 hr was essentially unchanged. Food appears to increase pharmacokinetic
variability relative to fasting. 
Overall, considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. For observed
C12 hr in BENCHMRK 1 and 2 the coefficient of variation (CV) for inter-subject variability = 212 %
and the CV for intra-subject variability = 122 %. Sources of variability may include differences in
co-administration with food and concomitant medicines.
Distribution
Raltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to
10 µM.
Raltegravir readily crossed the placenta in rats, but did not penetrate the brain to any appreciable
extent.
In two studies of HIV-1 infected patients who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was
readily detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the first study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid
concentration was 5.8 % (range 1 to 53.5 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. In the second
study (n=16), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 3 % (range 1 to 61 %) of the
corresponding plasma concentration. These median proportions are approximately 3- to 6-fold lower
than the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma.
20
Biotransformation and excretion
The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter α-phase half-life
(~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled
raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively. In
faeces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely to be derived from hydrolysis of
raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely
raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and
23 % of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented
approximately 70 % of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for
by raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the
formation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus, the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of
raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.
UGT1A1 Polymorphism
In a comparison of 30 subjects with *28/*28 genotype to 27 subjects with wild-type genotype, the
geometric mean ratio (90 % CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09) and the geometric mean ratio of C12 hr
was 1.91 (1.43, 2.55). Dose adjustment is not considered necessary in subjects with reduced UGT1A1
activity due to genetic polymorphism.
Special populations
Paediatric population
Based on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers, the chewable tablet and granules
for oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg tablet. In this study,
administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6 % decrease in AUC,
62 % decrease in Cmax, and 188 % increase in C12hr compared to administration in the fasted state.
Administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir pharmacokinetics
to a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered without regard to food.
The effect of food on the granules for oral suspension formulation was not studied.

granules for oral suspension, by body weight.

21
 Elderly
There was no clinically meaningful effect of age on raltegravir pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects
and patients with HIV-1 infection over the age range studied (19 to 84 years, with few individuals over
the age of 65).
Gender, race and BMI
There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences due to gender, race or body mass
index (BMI) in adults.
Renal impairment
Renal clearance of unchanged medicinal product is a minor pathway of elimination. In adults, there
were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with severe renal
insufficiency and healthy subjects (see section 4.2). Because the extent to which raltegravir may be
dialysable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided.
Hepatic impairment
Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. In adults, there were no clinically
important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency and
healthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has
not been studied (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical toxicology studies, including conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose
toxicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity and juvenile toxicity, have been conducted with
raltegravir in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Effects at exposure levels sufficiently in excess of clinical
exposure levels indicate no special hazard for humans.
Mutagenicity
No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames)
tests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal
aberration studies.
Carcinogenicity
A carcinogenicity study of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential. At the highest
dose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was similar to
that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. In rats, tumours (squamous cell carcinoma) of the
nose/nasopharynx were identified at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day in females and at 300 mg/kg/day in
males. This neoplasia could result from local deposition and/or aspiration of drug on the mucosa of the
nose/nasopharynx during oral gavage dosing and subsequent chronic irritation and inflammation; it is
likely that it is of limited relevance for the intended clinical use. At the NOAEL, systemic exposure
was similar to that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. Standard genotoxicity studies to evaluate
mutagenicity and clastogenicity were negative.
Developmental toxicity
Raltegravir was not teratogenic in developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. A slight increase
in incidence of supernumerary ribs, a variant in the normal developmental process, was observed in rat
foetuses of dams exposed to raltegravir at approximately 4.4-fold human exposure at the
recommended human dose (RHD) based on AUC0-24 hr. No development effects were seen at 3.4-fold
human exposure at the RHD. Similar findings were not observed in rabbits.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
ISENTRESS 600 mg film-coated tablets is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral
medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adults,
and paediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.
Posology
ISENTRESS should be used in combination with other active anti-retroviral therapies (ARTs) (see
sections 4.4 and 5.1).
Adults and paediatric population
In adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg), the recommended dosage is 1,200 mg (two
600 mg tablets) once daily for treatment-naïve patients or patients who are virologically suppressed on
an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily.
Additional formulations and strengths available:
ISENTRESS is also available as a 400 mg tablet for twice daily use in HIV infected adults or children
and adolescents at least 25 kg. The 400 mg tablet should not be used to administer 1,200 mg once
daily regimen (please refer to the 400 mg Summary of Product Characteristics).
ISENTRESS is also available in a chewable tablet formulation and in granules for oral suspension
formulation. Refer to the chewable tablet and granules for oral suspension SmPCs for additional
dosing information. 
The safety and efficacy of raltegravir in preterm (<37 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight
(<2,000 g) newborns have not been established. No data are available in this population and no dosing
recommendations can be made.
25
The maximum dose of the chewable tablet is 300 mg twice daily. Because the formulations have
different pharmacokinetic profiles neither the chewable tablets nor the granules for oral suspension
should be substituted for the 400 mg tablet or the 600 mg tablet (see section 5.2). The chewable tablets
and the granules for oral suspension have not been studied in HIV-infected adolescents (12 to
18 years) or adults.
Elderly
There is limited information regarding the use of raltegravir in the elderly (see section 5.2). Therefore,
ISENTRESS should be used with caution in this population.
Renal impairment
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The safety
and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders.
Therefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see
sections 4.4 and 5.2).
ISENTRESS 600 mg film-coated tablet formulation should not be used in children weighing less than
40 kg.
Method of administration
Oral use.
ISENTRESS 600 mg tablets can be administered with or without food as a 1,200 mg once daily dose.
The tablets should not be chewed, crushed or split due to anticipated changes in the pharmacokinetic
profile.
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
General
Patients should be advised that current anti-retroviral therapy does not cure HIV and has not been
proven to prevent the transmission of HIV to others through blood contact. 
Raltegravir has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance. Therefore, whenever possible, raltegravir
should be administered with two other active ARTs to minimise the potential for virological failure
and the development of resistance (see section 5.1).
In treatment-naïve patients, the clinical study data on use of raltegravir are limited to use in
combination with two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (emtricitabine and tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate).
Depression
Depression, including suicidal ideation and behaviours, has been reported, particularly in patients with
a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Caution should be used in patients with a
pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness.
26
Hepatic impairment
The safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver
disorders. Therefore, raltegravir should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic
impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased frequency of
liver function abnormalities during combination anti-retroviral therapy and should be monitored
according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients,
interruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination anti-retroviral therapy are at an
increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.
Osteonecrosis
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been
reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination
anti-retroviral therapy. Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches
and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.
Immune reactivation syndrome
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination anti-
retroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic
pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically,
such reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant
examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and
pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any
inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to
occur in the setting of immune reactivation: however, the reported time to onset is more variable and
these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
Atazanavir
Co-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with atazanavir resulted in increased raltegravir
plasma levels; therefore, co-administration is not recommended (see section 4.5).
Tipranavir/ritonavir
Co-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with tipranavir/ritonavir could result in decreased
raltegravir trough plasma levels; therefore, co-administration is not recommended (see section 4.5).
Antacids
Co-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with calcium carbonate and
aluminium/magnesium containing antacids resulted in reduced raltegravir plasma levels; therefore,
co-administration is not recommended (see section 4.5).
Strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes
Strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes (e.g., rifampicin) have not been studied with raltegravir
1,200 mg once daily, but could result in decreased raltegravir trough plasma levels; therefore,
co-administration with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is not recommended.
27
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had
myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal
products associated with these conditions (see section 4.8).
Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions
Severe, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported in patients taking
raltegravir, in most cases concomitantly with other medicinal products associated with these reactions.
These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity
reactions have also been reported and were characterised by rash, constitutional findings, and
sometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue raltegravir and other suspect
agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop
(including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue,
muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia,
angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate
therapy initiated. Delay in stopping raltegravir treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of
severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.
Rash
Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing
raltegravir and darunavir compared to patients receiving raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir
without raltegravir (see section 4.8).
Lactose
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In vitro, raltegravir is a weak inhibitor of organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 (IC50 of 109 µM) and
OAT3 (IC50 of 18.8 µM). Caution is recommended when co-administering raltegravir 1,200 mg once
daily with sensitive OAT1 and/or OAT3 substrates.
In vitro studies indicate that raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, does
not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A, does not inhibit
UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A1 and 2B7, does not induce CYP3A4 and is not an inhibitor
of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion-transporting
polypeptides (OATP) 1B1, OATP1B3, organic cation transporters (OCT)1 and OCT2, or multidrug
and toxin extrusion proteins (MATE)1 and MATE2-K. Based on these data, raltegravir is not expected
to affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or
transporters.
Based on in vitro and in vivo studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a
UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway.
Considerable inter- and intra-individual variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of
raltegravir.
28
Effect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products
In drug interaction studies performed using raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir did not have a
clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of etravirine, maraviroc, tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate, hormonal contraceptives, methadone, midazolam or boceprevir. These findings can be
extended to raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily and no dosage adjustment is required for these agents.
In some studies, co-administration of raltegravir 400 mg tablets twice daily with darunavir resulted in
a modest but clinically insignificant decrease in darunavir plasma concentrations. Based on the
magnitude of effect seen with raltegravir 400 mg tablets twice daily, it is expected that the effect of
raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily on darunavir plasma concentrations is likely to be not clinically
meaningful.
Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir
Inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes
The impact of medicinal products that are strong inducers of UGT1A1 such as rifampicin on
raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is unknown, but co-administration is likely to decrease raltegravir
trough levels based on the reduction in trough concentrations observed with raltegravir 400 mg twice
daily; therefore, co-administration with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is not recommended. The
impact of other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital,
on UGT1A1 is unknown; therefore, co-administration with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is not
recommended. In drug interaction studies, efavirenz did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the
pharmacokinetics of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily; therefore, other less potent inducers (e.g.,
efavirenz, nevirapine, rifabutin, glucocorticoids, St. John's wort, pioglitazone) may be used with the
recommended dose of raltegravir.
Inhibitors of UGT1A1
Co-administration of atazanavir with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily significantly increased plasma
levels of raltegravir; therefore, co-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily and atazanavir is
not recommended.
Antacids
Co-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with aluminium/magnesium and calcium
carbonate containing antacids are likely to result in clinically meaningful reductions in the plasma
trough levels of raltegravir. Based on these findings, co-administration of aluminium/magnesium and
calcium carbonate containing antacids with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is not recommended.
Agents that increase gastric pH
Population pharmacokinetic analysis from ONCEMRK (Protocol 292) showed that co-administration
of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with PPIs or H2 blockers did not result in statistically significant
changes in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. Comparable efficacy and safety results were obtained
in the absence or presence of these gastric pH-altering agents. Based on these data, proton pump
inhibitors and H2 blockers may be co-administered with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily.
Additional considerations
No studies have been conducted to evaluate the drug interactions of ritonavir, tipranavir/ritonavir,
boceprevir or etravirine with raltegravir 1,200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once daily. While the magnitudes of
change on raltegravir exposure from raltegravir 400 mg twice daily by ritonavir, boceprevir or
etravirine were small, the impact from tipranavir/ritonavir was greater (GMR Ctrough=0.45, GMR
AUC=0.76). Co-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily and tipranavir/ritonavir is not
recommended.
Previous studies of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily showed that co-administration of tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate (a component of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) increased raltegravir
exposure. Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was identified to increase raltegravir 1,200 mg
29
once daily bioavailability by 12%, however its impact is not clinically meaningful. Therefore, co-
administration of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is
permitted.
All interaction studies were performed in adults.
Comprehensive drug interaction studies were performed with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and a
limited number of drug interaction studies were performed for raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily.
Table 1 displays all available interaction study data along with recommendations for
co-administration.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no data for the use of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily in pregnant women. A large amount of
data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily during the first trimester
(more than 1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes) indicates no malformative toxicity. Animal studies
have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily
during the second and/or third trimester (between 300-1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes)
indicates no increased risk of feto/neonatal toxicity.
Raltegravir 1,200 mg is not recommended during pregnancy.
Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry
To monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients inadvertently administered raltegravir while pregnant,
an Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register
patients in this registry.
As a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in
pregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn,
the animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in
order to characterise the safety for the foetus.
Breast-feeding
Raltegravir/metabolites are excreted in human milk to such an extent that effects on the breastfed
newborns/infants are likely. Available pharmacodynamics/toxicological data in animals have shown
excretion of raltegravir/metabolites in milk (for details see section 5.3).
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.
It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid
transmission of HIV.
Fertility
No effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in
3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose.
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Dizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens containing raltegravir. 
Dizziness may influence some patients' ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8).
4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In randomised clinical trials raltegravir 400 mg twice daily was administered in combination with
fixed or optimised background treatment regimens to treatment-naïve (N=547) and treatment-
experienced (N=462) adults for up to 96 weeks. A further 531 treatment-naïve adults have received
raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for up to
96 weeks. See section 5.1.
34
The most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache, nausea and
abdominal pain. The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were immune reconstitution
syndrome and rash. The rates of discontinuation of raltegravir due to adverse reactions were 5% or less
in clinical trials. 
Rhabdomyolysis was an uncommonly reported serious adverse reaction in post-marketing use of
raltegravir 400 mg twice daily.

Description of selected adverse reactions
In studies of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, cancers were reported in treatment-experienced and
treatment-naïve patients who initiated raltegravir in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. The
types and rates of specific cancers were those expected in a highly immunodeficient population. The
risk of developing cancer in these studies was similar in the groups receiving raltegravir and in the
groups receiving comparators.
Grade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in patients treated with raltegravir.
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had
myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal
products associated with these conditions (see section 4.4).
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic
infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have
also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur
many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).
For each of the following clinical adverse reactions there was at least one serious occurrence: genital
herpes, anaemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, depression, mental disorder, suicide attempt,
gastritis, hepatitis, renal failure, accidental overdose.
In clinical studies of treatment-experienced patients, rash, irrespective of causality, was more
commonly observed with regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to those containing
raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir. Rash considered by the investigator to
be drug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9,
4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3
37
per 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity
and did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).
Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus
In clinical trials, there were 79 patients co-infected with hepatitis B, 84 co-infected with hepatitis C,
and 8 patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C who were treated with raltegravir in combination
with other agents for HIV-1. In general, the safety profile of raltegravir in patients with hepatitis B
and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in patients without hepatitis B and/or
hepatitis C virus co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were somewhat
higher in the subgroup co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus. 
At 96-weeks, in treatment-experienced patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that
represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29 %, 34 % and
13 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 11 %, 10 % and 9 %
of all other patients treated with raltegravir. At 240-weeks, in treatment-naïve patients, Grade 2 or
higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total
bilirubin occurred in 22 %, 44 % and 17 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with
raltegravir as compared to 13 %, 13 % and 5 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir.
Paediatric population
ISENTRESS 600 mg tablet formulation has not been studied in paediatric patients (see section 4.2).
Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age
Raltegravir twice daily has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected
children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in
IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose
of raltegravir twice daily.
In these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions
through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.
One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity,
abnormal behaviour and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic
rash.
One patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which
were considered serious.
Infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age
Raltegravir twice daily has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less
than 2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see
sections 5.1 and 5.2).
In these 26 infants and toddlers, the frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions
through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.
One patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment
discontinuation.
HIV-1 Exposed Neonates
In IMPAACT P1110 (see section 5.2) eligible infants were at least 37 weeks gestation and at least 2 kg
in weight. Sixteen (16) neonates received 2 doses of ISENTRESS in first 2 weeks of life, and
26 neonates received 6 weeks of daily dosing; all were followed for 24 weeks. There were no drug
related clinical adverse experiences and three drug-related laboratory adverse experiences (one a
transient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine containing prevention of mother to
38
child transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered
non-serious and not requiring specific therapy). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with raltegravir.
In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the standard supportive measures, e.g., remove
unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an
electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. It should be taken into account that
raltegravir is presented for clinical use as the potassium salt. The extent to which raltegravir may be
dialysable is unknown.
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, integrase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AJ01.
Mechanism of action
Raltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor active against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV-1). Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of integrase, an HIV-encoded enzyme that is
required for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of
the HIV genome into the host cell genome. HIV genomes that fail to integrate cannot direct the
production of new infectious viral particles, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral
infection. 
Antiviral activity in vitro
Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 
 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition (IC95) of HIV-1 replication
(relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the
cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, raltegravir inhibited viral replication in cultures of
mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with diverse, primary clinical
isolates of HIV-1, including isolates from 5 non-B subtypes, and isolates resistant to reverse
transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited
infection of 23 HIV isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes and 5 circulating recombinant forms with
IC50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM.
Resistance
Most viruses isolated from patients failing raltegravir had high-level raltegravir resistance resulting
from the appearance of two or more mutations in integrase. Most had a signature mutation at amino
acid 155 (N155 changed to H), amino acid 148 (Q148 changed to H, K, or R), or amino acid 143
(Y143 changed to H, C, or R), along with one or more additional integrase mutations (e.g., L74M,
E92Q, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, S230R). The signature mutations decrease viral
susceptibility to raltegravir and addition of other mutations results in a further decrease in raltegravir
susceptibility. Factors that reduced the likelihood of developing resistance included lower baseline
viral load and use of other active anti-retroviral agents. Mutations conferring resistance to raltegravir
generally also confer resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir. Mutations at
39
amino acid 143 confer greater resistance to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q mutation
confers greater resistance to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harbouring a mutation at amino
acid 148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance mutations, may also have clinically
significant resistance to dolutegravir.
Clinical experience
The evidence of efficacy of raltegravir was based on the analyses of 96-week data from two
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2,
Protocols 018 and 019) in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adult patients, the
analysis of 240-week data from randomised, double-blind, active-control trial (STARTMRK,
Protocol 021) in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients and the analysis of
96-week data from randomised, double-blind, active-control trial (ONCEMRK, Protocol 292) in
antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients.
Efficacy
Treatment-experienced adult patients (400 mg twice daily)
BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trials) evaluated the safety and anti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. placebo in a
combination with optimised background therapy (OBT), in HIV-infected patients, 16 years or older,
with documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs) of
anti-retroviral therapies. Prior to randomisation, OBT were selected by the investigator based on the
patient's prior treatment history, as well as baseline genotypic and phenotypic viral resistance testing.
Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the
groups receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and placebo. Patients had prior exposure to a median
of 12 anti-retrovirals for a median of 10 years. A median of 4 ARTs was used in OBT. 
Results 48-week and 96-week analyses
Durable outcomes (Week 48 and Week 96) for patients on the recommended dose raltegravir 400 mg
twice daily from the pooled studies BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are shown in Table 2.

‡
§
 For analysis by prognostic factors, virologic failures were carried forward for percent < 400 and 50 copies/mL. For mean CD4 changes, baseline-carry-
forward was used for virologic failures.
 The Genotypic Sensitivity Score (GSS) was defined as the total oral ARTs in the optimised background therapy (OBT) to which a patient's viral isolate
showed genotypic sensitivity based upon genotypic resistance test. Enfuvirtide use in OBT in enfuvirtide-naïve patients was counted as one active drug in
OBT. Similarly, darunavir use in OBT in darunavir-naïve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT.
Raltegravir achieved virologic responses (using Not Completer=Failure approach) of HIV RNA
< 50 copies/mL in 61.7 % of patients at Week 16, in 62.1 % at Week 48 and in 57.0 % at Week 96.
Some patients experienced viral rebound between Week 16 and Week 96. Factors associated with
failure include high baseline viral load and OBT that did not include at least one potent active agent. 
Switch to raltegravir (400 mg twice daily)
The SWITCHMRK 1 & 2 (Protocols 032 & 033) studies evaluated HIV-infected patients receiving
suppressive (screening HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL; stable regimen > 3 months) therapy with lopinavir
200 mg (+) ritonavir 50 mg 2 tablets twice daily plus at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors and randomised them 1:1 to continue lopinavir (+) ritonavir 2 tablets twice daily (n=174 and
n=178, respectively) or replace lopinavir (+) ritonavir with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (n=174 and
n=176, respectively). Patients with a prior history of virological failure were not excluded and the
number of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited.
These studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they failed to
demonstrate non-inferiority of raltegravir versus lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In both studies at Week 24,
suppression of HIV RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 84.4 % of the raltegravir group
versus 90.6 % of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group, (Non-completers = Failure). See section 4.4
regarding the need to administer raltegravir with two other active agents.

Treatment-naïve adult patients (400 mg twice daily)
STARTMRK (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-control trial) evaluated the safety and
anti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime, in a
combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-naïve HIV-infected
patients with HIV RNA > 5,000 copies/mL. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV RNA
level (≤ 50,000 copies/mL; and > 50,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B or C status (positive or
negative).
Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the
group receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and the group receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime. 
Results 48-week and 240-week analyses
With respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA
< 50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 241/280 (86.1 %) in the group receiving raltegravir and 230/281
(81.9 %) in the group receiving efavirenz. The treatment difference (raltegravir – efavirenz) was 4.2 %
with an associated 95 % CI of (-1.9, 10.3) establishing that raltegravir is non-inferior to efavirenz
(p-value for non-inferiority < 0.001). At Week 240, the treatment difference (raltegravir – efavirenz)
was 9.5 % with an associated 95 % CI of (1.7, 17.3). Week 48 and Week 240 outcomes for patients on
the recommended dose of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily from STARTMRK are shown in Table 3.

Treatment-naïve adult patients (1,200 mg [2 x 600 mg] once daily)
ONCEMRK (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-control trial; Protocol 292) evaluated the
safety and anti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate vs. raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients with HIV RNA > 1,000 copies/mL.
Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV RNA level (≤ 100,000 copies/mL; and
> 100,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B or C status (positive or negative).
Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the
group receiving raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily and the group receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice
daily.
Results of Week 48 and 96 analyses
With respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA
< 40 copies/mL at Week 48 was 472/531(88.9 %) in the group receiving raltegravir 1,200 mg once
daily and 235/266 (88.3 %) in the group receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily. The treatment
difference (raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily-raltegravir 400 mg twice daily) was 0.5 % with an
associated 95 % CI of (-4.2, 5.2) establishing that raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is non-inferior to
raltegravir 400 mg twice daily. 
At Week 96, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA < 40 copies/mL was 433/531(81.5 %) in
the group receiving raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily and 213/266 (80.1 %) in the group receiving
raltegravir 400 mg twice daily. The treatment difference (raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily-raltegravir
400 mg twice daily) was 1.5 % with an associated 95 % CI of (-4.4, 7.3). Week 48 and Week 96

Raltegravir 1,200 mg QD and raltegravir 400 mg BID were administered with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
As demonstrated in healthy volunteers administered single oral doses of raltegravir in the fasted state,
raltegravir is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 3 hours postdose. Raltegravir AUC and
Cmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Raltegravir C12 hr increases
dose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose
proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg.
With twice-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved rapidly, within approximately the
first 2 days of dosing. There is little to no accumulation in AUC and Cmax and evidence of slight
accumulation in C12 hr. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established.
Raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is also rapidly absorbed with median Tmax ~1.5 to 2 hours in the fasted
state and generates a sharper absorption peak with a tendency to higher Cmax in comparison to
raltegravir twice daily (1 x 400 mg tablet twice daily). In addition, relative to the raltegravir 400 mg
formulation the raltegravir 600 mg formulation used in the 1,200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once daily dosing
regimen has higher relative bioavailability (by 21 to 66%). Once absorbed, both formulations of
raltegravir exhibit similar systemic pharmacokinetics. In patients, after 1,200 mg once daily raltegravir
dosing, steady state AUC0-24 was 53.7 h·μM, C24 was 75.6 nM, and median Tmax was 1.50 h.
Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily may be administered with or without food. Raltegravir was
administered without regard to food in the pivotal safety and efficacy studies in HIV-infected patients.
Administration of multiple doses of raltegravir following a moderate-fat meal did not affect raltegravir
AUC to a clinically meaningful degree with an increase of 13 % relative to fasting. Raltegravir C12 hr
was 66 % higher and Cmax was 5 % higher following a moderate-fat meal compared to fasting.
Administration of raltegravir following a high-fat meal increased AUC and Cmax by approximately
2-fold and increased C12 hr by 4.1-fold. Administration of raltegravir following a low-fat meal
decreased AUC and Cmax by 46 % and 52 %, respectively; C12 hr was essentially unchanged. Food
appears to increase pharmacokinetic variability relative to fasting.
Raltegravir 600 mg tablets (2 x 600 mg once daily) may be administered with or without food. A
single dose food effect study demonstrated that the 1,200 mg once daily had similar or smaller food
effects when studied under high-fat and low-fat meal conditions when compared to the 400 mg twice
44
 
 
                                 
daily. Administration of a low-fat meal with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily resulted in a 42%
decrease in AUC0-last, 52% decrease in Cmax, and 16% decrease in C24 hr. Administration of a high fat
meal resulted in a 1.9% increase in AUC0-last, 28% decrease in Cmax, and 12% decrease in C24 hr.
Overall, considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. For observed
C12 hr in BENCHMRK 1 and 2 the coefficient of variation (CV) for inter-subject variability = 212 %
and the CV for intra-subject variability = 122 %. Sources of variability may include differences in
co-administration with food and concomitant medicines.
Distribution
Raltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to
10 µM.
Raltegravir readily crossed the placenta in rats, but did not penetrate the brain to any appreciable
extent.
In two studies of HIV-1 infected patients who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was
readily detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the first study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid
concentration was 5.8 % (range 1 to 53.5 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. In the second
study (n=16), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 3 % (range 1 to 61 %) of the
corresponding plasma concentration. These median proportions are approximately 3- to 6-fold lower
than the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma.
Biotransformation and excretion
The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter α-phase half-life
(~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled
raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively. In
faeces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely to be derived from hydrolysis of
raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely
raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and
23 % of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented
approximately 70 % of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for
by raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the
formation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus, the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of
raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.
UGT1A1 Polymorphism
In a comparison of 30 subjects with *28/*28 genotype to 27 subjects with wild-type genotype, the
geometric mean ratio (90 % CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09) and the geometric mean ratio of C12 hr
was 1.91 (1.43, 2.55). Dose adjustment is not considered necessary in subjects with reduced UGT1A1
activity due to genetic polymorphism.
Special populations
Paediatric population
Based on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers, the chewable tablet and granules
for oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg tablet. In this study,
administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6 % decrease in AUC,
62 % decrease in Cmax, and 188 % increase in C12 hr compared to administration in the fasted state.
Administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir pharmacokinetics
to a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered without regard to food.
The effect of food on the granules for oral suspension formulation was not studied.

Elderly
There was no clinically meaningful effect of age on raltegravir pharmacokinetics over the age range
studied with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily. There was no clinically meaningful effect of age on
raltegravir pharmacokinetics over the age range studied in ONCEMRK with raltegravir 1,200 mg
(2 x 600 mg) once daily.
Gender, race, ethnicity and body weight
There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences due to gender, race, ethnicity or body
weight in adults for raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, and no clinically meaningful effect on raltegravir
pharmacokinetics was concluded. For raltegravir 1,200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once daily, population
PK analysis also demonstrated that the impacts of gender, race, ethnicity and body weight are not
clinically meaningful.
Renal impairment
Renal clearance of unchanged medicinal product is a minor pathway of elimination. In adults, there
were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with severe renal
insufficiency and healthy subjects (see section 4.2 of the 400 mg twice daily SmPC). Because the
extent to which raltegravir may be dialysable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be
avoided. No renal impairment study was conducted with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily however,
based on results with the 400 mg twice daily tablet, no clinically meaningful effect is anticipated.
Hepatic impairment
Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. In adults, there were no clinically
important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency and
healthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has
not been studied (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the 400 mg twice daily SmPC). No hepatic impairment
study has been conducted with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily, however, based on results with the
400 mg twice daily tablet, no clinically meaningful effect is expected for mild and moderate hepatic
impairment.
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical toxicology studies, including conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose
toxicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity and juvenile toxicity, have been conducted with
raltegravir in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Effects at exposure levels sufficiently in excess of clinical
exposure levels indicate no special hazard for humans.
46
Mutagenicity
No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames)
tests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal
aberration studies.
Carcinogenicity
A carcinogenicity study of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential. At the highest
dose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was similar to
that at the clinical dose of 1,200 mg once daily. In rats, tumours (squamous cell carcinoma) of the
nose/nasopharynx were identified at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day in females and at 300 mg/kg/day in
males. This neoplasia could result from local deposition and/or aspiration of drug on the mucosa of the
nose/nasopharynx during oral gavage dosing and subsequent chronic irritation and inflammation; it is
likely that it is of limited relevance for the intended clinical use. At the NOAEL, systemic exposure
was similar to that at the clinical dose of 1,200 mg once daily. Standard genotoxicity studies to
evaluate mutagenicity and clastogenicity were negative.
Developmental toxicity
Raltegravir was not teratogenic in developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. A slight increase
in incidence of supernumerary ribs, a variant in the normal developmental process, was observed in rat
foetuses of dams exposed to raltegravir at approximately 4.4-fold human exposure at the
recommended human dose (RHD) based on AUC0-24 hr. No development effects were seen at 3.4-fold
human exposure at the RHD. Similar findings were not observed in rabbits.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
ISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the
treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.
Posology
ISENTRESS should be used in combination with other active anti-retroviral therapies (ARTs) (see
sections 4.4 and 5.1).
The maximum dose of the chewable tablet is 300 mg twice daily.
Because the formulations have different pharmacokinetic profiles neither the chewable tablets nor the
granules for oral suspension should be substituted for the 400 mg tablet or 600 mg tablet (see
section 5.2). The chewable tablets and the granules for oral suspension have not been studied in
HIV-infected adolescents (12 to 18 years) or adults.
49
Paediatric Population
Children at least 11 kg: weight-based dose of the chewable tablet to a maximum dose of 300 mg, twice
daily as specified in Tables 1 and 2. The chewable tablets are available in 25 mg and scored 100 mg
strengths.

Additional formulations and strengths available
ISENTRESS is also available in a 400 mg tablet and as granules for oral suspension for use. Refer to
the 400 mg tablet and granules for oral suspension SmPCs for additional dosing information. 
The safety and efficacy of raltegravir in preterm (<37 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight
(<2,000 g) newborns have not been established. No data are available in this population and no dosing
recommendations can be made.
ISENTRESS is also available for adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg), as a 600 mg
tablet to be administered as 1,200 mg once daily (two 600 mg tablets) for treatment-naïve patients or
patients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily.
Refer to the 600 mg tablet SmPCs for additional dosing information.
Elderly
There is limited information regarding the use of raltegravir in the elderly (see section 5.2). Therefore,
ISENTRESS should be used with caution in this population.
Renal impairment
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The safety
and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders.
Therefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see
sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Method of administration
Oral use.
ISENTRESS chewable tablets can be administered with or without food (see section 5.2).
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
General
Patients should be advised that current anti-retroviral therapy does not cure HIV and has not been
proven to prevent the transmission of HIV to others through blood contact. 
Raltegravir has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance. Therefore, whenever possible, raltegravir
should be administered with two other active ARTs to minimise the potential for virological failure
and the development of resistance (see section 5.1).
In treatment-naïve patients, the clinical study data on use of raltegravir are limited to use in
combination with two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (emtricitabine and tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate). 
Depression
Depression, including suicidal ideation and behaviours, has been reported, particularly in patients with
a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Caution should be used in patients with a
pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness.
51
Hepatic impairment
The safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver
disorders. Therefore, raltegravir should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic
impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased frequency of
liver function abnormalities during combination anti-retroviral therapy and should be monitored
according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients,
interruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination anti-retroviral therapy are at an
increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.
Osteonecrosis
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been
reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination
anti-retroviral therapy. Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches
and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.
Immune reactivation syndrome
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination anti-
retroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic
pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically,
such reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant
examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and
pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any
inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to
occur in the setting of immune reactivation: however, the reported time to onset is more variable and
these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
Antacids
Co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and magnesium antacids resulted in reduced
raltegravir plasma levels. Co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium antacids
is not recommended (see section 4.5).
Rifampicin
Caution should be used when co-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of uridine diphosphate
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces plasma levels of
raltegravir; the impact on the efficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if co-administration with
rifampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of the dose of raltegravir can be considered in adults. There are
no data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in patients below 18 years of age (see
section 4.5).
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had
myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal
products associated with these conditions (see section 4.8).
52
Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions
Severe, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported in patients taking
raltegravir, in most cases concomitantly with other medicinal products associated with these reactions.
These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity
reactions have also been reported and were characterised by rash, constitutional findings, and
sometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue raltegravir and other suspect
agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop
(including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue,
muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia,
angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate
therapy initiated. Delay in stopping raltegravir treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of
severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.
Rash
Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing
raltegravir and darunavir compared to patients receiving raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir
without raltegravir (see section 4.8).

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In vitro studies indicate that raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, does
not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A, does not inhibit
UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A1 and 2B7, does not induce CYP3A4 and does not inhibit
P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Based on these data, raltegravir is not expected to affect the
pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or P-glycoprotein.
Based on in vitro and in vivo studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a
UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway.
Considerable inter- and intra-individual variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of
raltegravir.
Effect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products
In interaction studies, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics
of etravirine, maraviroc, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, hormonal contraceptives, methadone,
midazolam or boceprevir. 
In some studies, co-administration of raltegravir with darunavir resulted in a modest decrease in
darunavir plasma concentrations; the mechanism for this effect is unknown. However, the effect of
raltegravir on darunavir plasma concentrations does not appear to be clinically meaningful.
54
Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir
Given that raltegravir is metabolised primarily via UGT1A1, caution should be used when
co-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of UGT1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces
plasma levels of raltegravir; the impact on the efficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if
co-administration with rifampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of the dose of raltegravir can be
considered in adults. There are no data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in
patients below 18 years of age (see section 4.4). The impact of other strong inducers of drug
metabolizing enzymes, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, on UGT1A1 is unknown. Less potent
inducers (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, rifabutin, glucocorticoids, St. John's wort,
pioglitazone) may be used with the recommended dose of raltegravir.
Co-administration of raltegravir with medicinal products that are known to be potent UGT1A1
inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir) may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Less potent UGT1A1 inhibitors
(e.g., indinavir, saquinavir) may also increase plasma levels of raltegravir, but to a lesser extent
compared with atazanavir. In addition, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may increase plasma levels of
raltegravir, however, the mechanism for this effect is unknown (see Table 3). From the clinical trials, a
large proportion of patients used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, both agents that
result in increases in raltegravir plasma levels, in the optimised background regimens. The safety
profile observed in patients who used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was generally
similar to the safety profile of patients who did not use these agents. Therefore, no dose adjustment is
required.
Co-administration of raltegravir with antacids containing divalent metal cations may reduce raltegravir
absorption by chelation, resulting in a decrease of raltegravir plasma levels. Taking an aluminium and
magnesium antacid within 6 hours of raltegravir administration significantly decreased raltegravir
plasma levels. Therefore, co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium
containing antacids is not recommended. Co-administration of raltegravir with a calcium carbonate
antacid decreased raltegravir plasma levels; however, this interaction is not considered clinically
meaningful. Therefore, when raltegravir is co-administered with calcium carbonate containing
antacids no dose adjustment is required.
Co-administration of raltegravir with other agents that increase gastric pH (e.g., omeprazole and
famotidine) may increase the rate of raltegravir absorption and result in increased plasma levels of
raltegravir (see Table 3). Safety profiles in the subgroup of patients in Phase III trials taking proton
pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists were comparable with those who were not taking these antacids.
Therefore, no dose adjustment is required with use of proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists.
All interaction studies have been performed in adults.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no data for the use of raltegravir chewable tablets in pregnant women. A large amount of
data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily during the first trimester
(more than 1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes) indicates no malformative toxicity. Animal studies
have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily
during the second and/or third trimester (between 300-1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes)
indicates no increased risk of feto/neonatal toxicity.
Raltegravir chewable tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit justifies the
potential risk to the fetus. See section 4.2 for dosing recommendations.
Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry
To monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients inadvertently administered raltegravir while pregnant,
an Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register
patients in this registry.
As a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in
pregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn,
the animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in
order to characterise the safety for the foetus.
58
Breast-feeding
Raltegravir/metabolites are excreted in human milk to such an extent that effects on the breastfed
newborns/infants are likely. Available pharmacodynamics/toxicological data in animals have shown
excretion of raltegravir/metabolites in milk (for details see section 5.3).
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.
It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid
transmission of HIV.
Fertility
No effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in
3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose.
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Dizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens containing raltegravir.
Dizziness may influence some patients' ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8).
4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In randomised clinical trials raltegravir 400 mg twice daily was administered in combination with
fixed or optimised background treatment regimens to treatment-naïve (N=547) and treatment-
experienced (N=462) adults for up to 96 weeks. A further 531 treatment-naïve adults have received
raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for up to
96 weeks. See section 5.1.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache, nausea and
abdominal pain. The most frequently reported serious adverse reaction was immune reconstitution
syndrome and rash. The rates of discontinuation of raltegravir due to adverse reactions were 5 % or
less in clinical trials.
Rhabdomyolysis was an uncommonly reported serious adverse reaction in post-marketing use of
raltegravir 400 mg twice daily.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Cancers were reported in treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve patients who initiated raltegravir
in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. The types and rates of specific cancers were those
expected in a highly immunodeficient population. The risk of developing cancer in these studies was
similar in the groups receiving raltegravir and in the groups receiving comparators.
61
Grade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in patients treated with raltegravir.
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had
myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal
products associated with these conditions (see section 4.4).
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic
infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have
also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur
many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).
For each of the following clinical adverse reactions there was at least one serious occurrence: genital
herpes, anaemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, depression, mental disorder, suicide attempt,
gastritis, hepatitis, renal failure, accidental overdose.
In clinical studies of treatment-experienced patients, rash, irrespective of causality, was more
commonly observed with regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to those containing
raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir. Rash considered by the investigator to
be drug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9,
4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3
per 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity
and did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).
Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus
In clinical trials, there were 79 patients co-infected with hepatitis B, 84 co-infected with hepatitis C,
and 8 patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C who were treated with raltegravir in combination
with other agents for HIV-1. In general, the safety profile of raltegravir in patients with hepatitis B
and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in patients without hepatitis B and/or
hepatitis C virus co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were somewhat
higher in the subgroup co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus 
At 96-weeks, in treatment-experienced patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that
represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29 %, 34 % and
13 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 11 %, 10 % and 9 %
of all other patients treated with raltegravir. At 240-weeks, in treatment-naïve patients, Grade 2 or
higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total
bilirubin occurred in 22 %, 44 % and 17 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with
raltegravir as compared to 13 %, 13 % and 5 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir.
Paediatric population
Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age
Raltegravir has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and
adolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066
(see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of raltegravir.
In these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions
through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.
One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity,
abnormal behaviour and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic
rash.
62
One patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which
were considered serious.
Infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age
Raltegravir has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than
2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1
and 5.2).
In these 26 infants and toddlers, the frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions
through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.
One patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment
discontinuation.
HIV-1 Exposed Neonates
In IMPAACT P1110 (see section 5.2) eligible infants were at least 37 weeks gestation and at least 2 kg
in weight. Sixteen (16) neonates received 2 doses of ISENTRESS in first 2 weeks of life, and
26 neonates received 6 weeks of daily dosing; all were followed for 24 weeks. There were no drug
related clinical adverse experiences and three drug-related laboratory adverse experiences (one a
transient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine containing prevention of mother to
child transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered
non-serious and not requiring specific therapy). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with raltegravir. 
In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the standard supportive measures, e.g., remove
unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an
electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. It should be taken into account that
raltegravir is presented for clinical use as the potassium salt. The extent to which raltegravir may be
dialysable is unknown.
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, integrase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AJ01.
Mechanism of action
Raltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor active against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV-1). Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of integrase, an HIV-encoded enzyme that is
required for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of
the HIV genome into the host cell genome. HIV genomes that fail to integrate cannot direct the
production of new infectious viral particles, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral
infection. 
63
Antiviral activity in vitro
Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 
 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition (IC95) of HIV-1 replication
(relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the
cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, raltegravir inhibited viral replication in cultures of
mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with diverse, primary clinical
isolates of HIV-1, including isolates from 5 non-B subtypes, and isolates resistant to reverse
transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited
infection of 23 HIV isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes and 5 circulating recombinant forms with
IC50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM.
Resistance
Most viruses isolated from patients failing raltegravir had high-level raltegravir resistance resulting
from the appearance of two or more mutations in integrase. Most had a signature mutation at amino
acid 155 (N155 changed to H), amino acid 148 (Q148 changed to H, K, or R), or amino acid 143
(Y143 changed to H, C, or R), along with one or more additional integrase mutations (e.g., L74M,
E92Q, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, S230R). The signature mutations decrease viral
susceptibility to raltegravir and addition of other mutations results in a further decrease in raltegravir
susceptibility. Factors that reduced the likelihood of developing resistance included lower baseline
viral load and use of other active anti-retroviral agents. Mutations conferring resistance to raltegravir
generally also confer resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir. Mutations at
amino acid 143 confer greater resistance to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q mutation
confers greater resistance to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harbouring a mutation at amino
acid 148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance mutations, may also have clinically
significant resistance to dolutegravir. 
Clinical experience
The evidence of efficacy of raltegravir was based on the analyses of 96-week data from two
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2,
Protocols 018 and 019) in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adult patients and the
analysis of 240-week data from a randomised, double-blind, active-control trial (STARTMRK,
Protocol 021) in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients.
Efficacy
Treatment-experienced adult patients
BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trials) evaluated the safety and anti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. placebo in a
combination with optimised background therapy (OBT), in HIV-infected patients, 16 years or older,
with documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs) of
anti-retroviral therapies. Prior to randomisation, OBT were selected by the investigator based on the
patient's prior treatment history, as well as baseline genotypic and phenotypic viral resistance testing
Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the
groups receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and placebo. Patients had prior exposure to a median
of 12 anti-retrovirals for a median of 10 years. A median of 4 ARTs was used in OBT. 
Results 48 week and 96 week analyses
Durable outcomes (Week 48 and Week 96) for patients on the recommended dose raltegravir 400 mg
twice daily from the pooled studies BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are shown in Table 4.

§
 For analysis by prognostic factors, virologic failures were carried forward for percent < 400 and 50 copies/mL. For mean CD4 changes, baseline-carry-
forward was used for virologic failures.
 The Genotypic Sensitivity Score (GSS) was defined as the total oral ARTs in the optimised background therapy (OBT) to which a patient's viral isolate
showed genotypic sensitivity based upon genotypic resistance test. Enfuvirtide use in OBT in enfuvirtide-naïve patients was counted as one active
drug in OBT. Similarly, darunavir use in OBT in darunavir-naïve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT.
Raltegravir achieved virologic responses (using Not Completer=Failure approach) of HIV RNA
< 50 copies/mL in 61.7 % of patients at Week 16, in 62.1 % at Week 48 and in 57.0 % at Week 96.
Some patients experienced viral rebound between Week 16 and Week 96. Factors associated with
failure include high baseline viral load and OBT that did not include at least one potent active agent.

Switch to raltegravir
The SWITCHMRK 1 & 2 (Protocols 032 & 033) studies evaluated HIV-infected patients receiving
suppressive (screening HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL; stable regimen > 3 months) therapy with lopinavir
200 mg (+) ritonavir 50 mg 2 tablets twice daily plus at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors and randomised them 1:1 to continue lopinavir (+) ritonavir 2 tablets twice daily (n=174 and
n=178, respectively) or replace lopinavir (+) ritonavir with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (n=174 and
n=176, respectively). Patients with a prior history of virological failure were not excluded and the
number of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited. 
These studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they failed to
demonstrate non-inferiority of raltegravir versus lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In both studies at Week 24,
suppression of HIV RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 84.4 % of the raltegravir group
versus 90.6 % of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group, (Non-completers = Failure). See section 4.4
regarding the need to administer raltegravir with two other active agents.
Treatment-naïve adult patients
STARTMRK (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-control trial) evaluated the safety and
anti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime, in a
combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-naïve HIV-infected
patients with HIV RNA > 5,000 copies/mL. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV RNA
level (≤ 50,000 copies/mL; and > 50,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B or C status (positive or
negative).
Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the
group receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and the group receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime. 
Results 48-week and 240-week analyses
With respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA
< 50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 241/280 (86.1 %) in the group receiving raltegravir and 230/281
(81.9 %) in the group receiving efavirenz. The treatment difference (raltegravir – efavirenz) was 4.2 %
with an associated 95 % CI of (-1.9, 10.3) establishing that raltegravir is non-inferior to efavirenz (p-
value for non-inferiority < 0.001). At Week 240, the treatment difference (raltegravir – efavirenz) was
9.5 % with an associated 95 % CI of (1.7, 17.3). Week 48 and Week 240 outcomes for patients on the
recommended dose of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily from STARTMRK are shown in Table 5.

Paediatric population
Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age
IMPAACT P1066 is a Phase I/II open label multicenter trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile,
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of raltegravir in HIV infected children. This study enrolled
126 treatment experienced children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age. Patients were stratified by
age, enrolling adolescents first and then successively younger children. Patients received either the
400 mg tablet formulation (6 to 18 years of age) or the chewable tablet formulation (2 to less than
12 years of age). Raltegravir was administered with an optimised background regimen.
The initial dose finding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Dose selection was based
upon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough concentration as seen in adults, and
acceptable short-term safety. After dose selection, additional patients were enrolled for evaluation of
long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy. Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of
raltegravir (see section 4.2).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
As demonstrated in healthy volunteers administered single oral doses of raltegravir in the fasted state,
raltegravir is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 3 hours postdose. Raltegravir AUC and
Cmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Raltegravir C12 hr increases
dose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose
proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Dose proportionality has not been established
in patients.
With twice-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved rapidly, within approximately the
first 2 days of dosing. There is little to no accumulation in AUC and Cmax and evidence of slight
accumulation in C12 hr. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established.
Raltegravir may be administered with or without food. Raltegravir was administered without regard to
food in the pivotal safety and efficacy studies in HIV-infected patients. Administration of multiple
doses of raltegravir following a moderate-fat meal did not affect raltegravir AUC to a clinically
meaningful degree with an increase of 13 % relative to fasting. Raltegravir C12 hr was 66 % higher and
Cmax was 5 % higher following a moderate-fat meal compared to fasting. Administration of raltegravir
following a high-fat meal increased AUC and Cmax by approximately 2-fold and increased C12 hr by
4.1-fold. Administration of raltegravir following a low-fat meal decreased AUC and Cmax by 46 % and
52 %, respectively; C12 hr was essentially unchanged. Food appears to increase pharmacokinetic
variability relative to fasting. 
Overall, considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. For observed
C12 hr in BENCHMRK 1 and 2 the coefficient of variation (CV) for inter-subject variability = 212 %
and the CV for intra-subject variability = 122 %. Sources of variability may include differences in
co-administration with food and concomitant medicines.
Distribution
Raltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to
10 µM.
Raltegravir readily crossed the placenta in rats, but did not penetrate the brain to any appreciable
extent.
In two studies of HIV-1 infected patients who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was
readily detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the first study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid
concentration was 5.8 % (range 1 to 53.5 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. In the second
study (n=16), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 3 % (range 1 to 61 %) of the
corresponding plasma concentration. These median proportions are approximately 3- to 6-fold lower
than the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma.
Biotransformation and excretion 
The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter α-phase half-life
(~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled
raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively. In
faeces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely to be derived from hydrolysis of
raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely
raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and
23 % of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented
approximately 70 % of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for
by raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the
69
formation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus, the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of
raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.
UGT1A1 Polymorphism
In a comparison of 30 subjects with *28/*28 genotype to 27 subjects with wild-type genotype, the
geometric mean ratio (90 % CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09) and the geometric mean ratio of C12 hr
was 1.91 (1.43, 2.55). Dose adjustment is not considered necessary in subjects with reduced UGT1A1
activity due to genetic polymorphism.
Special populations
Paediatric population
Based on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers, the chewable tablet and granules
for oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg tablet. In this study,
administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6 % decrease in AUC,
62 % decrease in Cmax, and 188 % increase in C12hr compared to administration in the fasted state.
Administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir pharmacokinetics
to a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered without regard to food.
The effect of food on the granules for oral suspension formulation was not studied.

†Geometric coefficient of variation.
Elderly
There was no clinically meaningful effect of age on raltegravir pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects
and patients with HIV-1 infection over the age range studied (19 to 84 years, with few individuals over
the age of 65).
Gender, race and BMI
There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences due to gender, race or body mass
index (BMI) in adults.
Renal impairment
Renal clearance of unchanged medicinal product is a minor pathway of elimination. In adults, there
were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with severe renal
insufficiency and healthy subjects (see section 4.2). Because the extent to which raltegravir may be
dialysable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided.
70
Hepatic impairment
Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. In adults, there were no clinically
important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency and
healthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has
not been studied (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical toxicology studies, including conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose
toxicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity and juvenile toxicity, have been conducted with
raltegravir in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Effects at exposure levels sufficiently in excess of clinical
exposure levels indicate no special hazard for humans.
Mutagenicity
No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames)
tests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal
aberration studies.
Carcinogenicity 
A carcinogenicity study of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential. At the highest
dose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was similar to
that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. In rats, tumours (squamous cell carcinoma) of the
nose/nasopharynx were identified at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day in females and at 300 mg/kg/day in
males. This neoplasia could result from local deposition and/or aspiration of drug on the mucosa of the
nose/nasopharynx during oral gavage dosing and subsequent chronic irritation and inflammation; it is
likely that it is of limited relevance for the intended clinical use. At the NOAEL, systemic exposure
was similar to that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. Standard genotoxicity studies to evaluate
mutagenicity and clastogenicity were negative.
Developmental toxicity
Raltegravir was not teratogenic in developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. A slight increase
in incidence of supernumerary ribs, a variant in the normal developmental process, was observed in rat
foetuses of dams exposed to raltegravir at approximately 4.4-fold human exposure at 400 mg twice
daily based on AUC0-24 hr. No development effects were seen at 3.4-fold human exposure at 400 mg
twice daily based on AUC0-24 hr. Similar findings were not observed in rabbits.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
ISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the
treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.
Posology
ISENTRESS should be used in combination with other active anti-retroviral therapies (ARTs) (see
sections 4.4 and 5.1).
Because the formulations have different pharmacokinetic profiles neither the granules for oral
suspension nor the chewable tablets should be substituted for the 400 mg tablet or 600 mg tablet (see
section 5.2). The granules for oral suspension and the chewable tablets have not been studied in
HIV-infected adolescents (12 to 18 years) or adults.
Neonates, Infants and Toddlers 
Dosing is weight based from birth as specified in Table 1 and Table 2. Patients can remain on the
granules for oral suspension as long as their weight is below 20 kg.
For patients weighing between 11 and 20 kg, either the granules for oral suspension or the chewable
tablet can be used as specified in Table 1 (see section 5.2). Refer to the chewable tablet SmPC for
additional dosing information.
The safety and efficacy of raltegravir in preterm (<37 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight
(<2,000 g) newborns have not been established. No data are available in this population and no dosing
recommendations can be made.

adjusted as the child grows.
75
 
Additional formulations and strengths available:
ISENTRESS is also available in a 400 mg tablet for use in adults, adolescents and children weighing
at least 25 kg and able to swallow a tablet. For patients weighing at least 25 kg but are unable to
swallow a tablet, consider the chewable tablet. Refer to the 400 mg and chewable tablet SmPCs for
additional dosing information.
ISENTRESS is also available for adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg), as a 600 mg
tablet to be administered as 1,200 mg once daily (two 600 mg tablets) for treatment-naïve patients or
patients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily.
Refer to the 600 mg tablet SmPC for additional dosing information.
Elderly
There is limited information regarding the use of raltegravir in the elderly (see section 5.2). Therefore,
ISENTRESS should be used with caution in this population.
Renal impairment
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The safety
and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders.
Therefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see
sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Method of administration
Oral use.
ISENTRESS granules for oral suspension can be administered with or without food (see section 5.2).
For details on preparation and administration of the suspension, see section 6.6.
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
General
Patients should be advised that current anti-retroviral therapy does not cure HIV and has not been
proven to prevent the transmission of HIV to others through blood contact. 
Raltegravir has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance. Therefore, whenever possible, raltegravir
should be administered with two other active ARTs to minimise the potential for virological failure
and the development of resistance (see section 5.1).
In treatment-naïve patients, the clinical study data on use of raltegravir are limited to use in
combination with two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (emtricitabine and tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate).
Depression
Depression, including suicidal ideation and behaviours, has been reported, particularly in patients with
a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Caution should be used in patients with a
pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness.
76
Hepatic impairment
The safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver
disorders. Therefore, raltegravir should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic
impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased frequency of
liver function abnormalities during combination anti-retroviral therapy and should be monitored
according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients,
interruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination anti-retroviral therapy are at an
increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.
Osteonecrosis
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been
reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination
anti-retroviral therapy. Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches
and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.
Immune reactivation syndrome
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination anti-
retroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic
pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically,
such reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant
examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and
pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any
inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to
occur in the setting of immune reactivation: however, the reported time to onset is more variable and
these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
Antacids
Co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and magnesium antacids resulted in reduced
raltegravir plasma levels. Co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium antacids
is not recommended (see section 4.5).
Rifampicin
Caution should be used when co-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of uridine diphosphate
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces plasma levels of
raltegravir; the impact on the efficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if co-administration with
rifampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of the dose of raltegravir can be considered in adults. There are
no data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in patients below 18 years of age (see
section 4.5).
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had
myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal
products associated with these conditions (see section 4.8).
77
Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions
Severe, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported in patients taking
raltegravir, in most cases concomitantly with other medicinal products associated with these reactions.
These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity
reactions have also been reported and were characterised by rash, constitutional findings, and
sometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue raltegravir and other suspect
agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop
(including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue,
muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia,
angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate
therapy initiated. Delay in stopping raltegravir treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of
severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.
Rash
Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing
raltegravir and darunavir compared to patients receiving raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir
without raltegravir (see section 4.8).
Fructose
This medicinal product contains up to 0.5 mg fructose per sachet.
Fructose may damage teeth.
Sucrose
This medicinal product contains up to 4.7 mg sucrose per sachet.
Sucrose may be harmful to the teeth.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or
sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
Sorbitol
This medicine contains sorbitol (E 420) up to 1.5 mg per sachet.
In medicinal products for oral use, sorbitol may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products
for oral use administered concomitantly.
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In vitro studies indicate that raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, does
not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A, does not inhibit
UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A1 and 2B7, does not induce CYP3A4 and does not inhibit
P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Based on these data, raltegravir is not expected to affect the
pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or P-glycoprotein.
Based on in vitro and in vivo studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a
UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway.
Considerable inter- and intra-individual variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of
raltegravir. 
78
Effect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products
In interaction studies, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics
of etravirine, maraviroc, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, hormonal contraceptives, methadone,
midazolam or boceprevir. 
In some studies, co-administration of raltegravir with darunavir resulted in a modest decrease in
darunavir plasma concentrations; the mechanism for this effect is unknown. However, the effect of
raltegravir on darunavir plasma concentrations does not appear to be clinically meaningful.
Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir
Given that raltegravir is metabolised primarily via UGT1A1, caution should be used when
co-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of UGT1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces
plasma levels of raltegravir; the impact on the efficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if
co-administration with rifampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of the dose of raltegravir can be
considered in adults. There are no data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in
patients below 18 years of age (see section 4.4). The impact of other strong inducers of drug
metabolizing enzymes, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, on UGT1A1 is unknown. Less potent
inducers (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, rifabutin, glucocorticoids, St. John's wort,
pioglitazone) may be used with the recommended dose of raltegravir.
Co-administration of raltegravir with medicinal products that are known to be potent UGT1A1
inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir) may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Less potent UGT1A1 inhibitors
(e.g., indinavir, saquinavir) may also increase plasma levels of raltegravir, but to a lesser extent
compared with atazanavir. In addition, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may increase plasma levels of
raltegravir, however, the mechanism for this effect is unknown (see Table 3). From the clinical trials, a
large proportion of patients used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, both agents that
result in increases in raltegravir plasma levels, in the optimised background regimens. The safety
profile observed in patients who used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was generally
similar to the safety profile of patients who did not use these agents. Therefore, no dose adjustment is
required.
Co-administration of raltegravir with antacids containing divalent metal cations may reduce raltegravir
absorption by chelation, resulting in a decrease of raltegravir plasma levels. Taking an aluminium and
magnesium antacid within 6 hours of raltegravir administration significantly decreased raltegravir
plasma levels. Therefore, co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium
containing antacids is not recommended. Co-administration of raltegravir with a calcium carbonate
antacid decreased raltegravir plasma levels; however, this interaction is not considered clinically
meaningful. Therefore, when raltegravir is co-administered with calcium carbonate containing
antacids no dose adjustment is required.
Co-administration of raltegravir with other agents that increase gastric pH (e.g., omeprazole and
famotidine) may increase the rate of raltegravir absorption and result in increased plasma levels of
raltegravir (see Table 3). Safety profiles in the subgroup of patients in Phase III trials taking proton
pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists were comparable with those who were not taking these antacids.
Therefore, no dose adjustment is required with use of proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists.
All interaction studies were performed in adults.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no data for the use of raltegravir granules for oral suspension in pregnant women. A large
amount of data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily during the first
trimester (more than 1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes) indicates no malformative toxicity.
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily
during the second and/or third trimester (between 300-1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes)
indicates no increased risk of feto/neonatal toxicity.
Raltegravir granules for oral suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit
justifies the potential risk to the fetus. See section 4.2 for dosing recommendations.
Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry
To monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients inadvertently administered raltegravir while pregnant,
an Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register
patients in this registry.
82
As a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in
pregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn,
the animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in
order to characterise the safety for the foetus.
Breast-feeding
Raltegravir/metabolites are excreted in human milk to such an extent that effects on the breastfed
newborns/infants are likely. Available pharmacodynamics/toxicological data in animals have shown
excretion of raltegravir/metabolites in milk (for details see section 5.3).
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.
It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid
transmission of HIV.
Fertility
No effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in
3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose.
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Dizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens containing raltegravir.
Dizziness may influence some patients' ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8).
4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In randomised clinical trials raltegravir 400 mg twice daily was administered in combination with
fixed or optimised background treatment regimens to treatment-naïve (N=547) and treatment-
experienced (N=462) adults for up to 96 weeks. A further 531 treatment-naïve adults have received
raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for up to
96 weeks. See section 5.1. 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache, nausea and
abdominal pain. The most frequently reported serious adverse reaction was immune reconstitution
syndrome and rash. The rates of discontinuation of raltegravir due to adverse reactions were 5% or less
in clinical trials. 
Rhabdomyolysis was an uncommonly reported serious adverse reaction in post-marketing use of
raltegravir 400 mg twice daily.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Cancers were reported in treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve patients who initiated raltegravir
in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. The types and rates of specific cancers were those
expected in a highly immunodeficient population. The risk of developing cancer in these studies was
similar in the groups receiving raltegravir and in the groups receiving comparators.
Grade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in patients treated with raltegravir.
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had
myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal
products associated with these conditions (see section 4.4).
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic
infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have
also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur
many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).
For each of the following clinical adverse reactions there was at least one serious occurrence: genital
herpes, anaemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, depression, mental disorder, suicide attempt,
gastritis, hepatitis, renal failure, accidental overdose.
In clinical studies of treatment-experienced patients, rash, irrespective of causality, was more
commonly observed with regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to those containing
raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir. Rash considered by the investigator to
be drug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9,
4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3
86
per 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity
and did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).
Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus
In clinical trials, there were 79 patients co-infected with hepatitis B, 84 co-infected with hepatitis C,
and 8 patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C who were treated with raltegravir in combination
with other agents for HIV-1. In general, the safety profile of raltegravir in patients with hepatitis B
and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in patients without hepatitis B and/or
hepatitis C virus co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were somewhat
higher in the subgroup co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus 
At 96-weeks, in treatment-experienced patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that
represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29 %, 34 % and
13 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 11 %, 10 % and 9 %
of all other patients treated with raltegravir. At 240-weeks, in treatment-naïve patients, Grade 2 or
higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total
bilirubin occurred in 22 %, 44 % and 17 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with
raltegravir as compared to 13 %, 13 % and 5 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir.
Paediatric population
Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age
Raltegravir has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and
adolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066
(see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of raltegravir.
In these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions
through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.
One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity,
abnormal behaviour and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic
rash.
One patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which
were considered serious.
Infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age
Raltegravir has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than
2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1
and 5.2).
In these 26 infants and toddlers, the frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions
through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.
One patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment
discontinuation.
HIV-1 Exposed Neonates
In IMPAACT P1110 (see section 5.2) eligible infants were at least 37 weeks gestation and at least 2 kg
in weight. Sixteen (16) neonates received 2 doses of ISENTRESS in first 2 weeks of life, and
26 neonates received 6 weeks of daily dosing; all were followed for 24 weeks. There were no drug
related clinical adverse experiences and three drug-related laboratory adverse experiences (one a
transient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine containing prevention of mother to
child transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered
non-serious and not requiring specific therapy). 
87
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with raltegravir.
In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the standard supportive measures, e.g., remove
unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an
electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. It should be taken into account that
raltegravir is presented for clinical use as the potassium salt. The extent to which raltegravir may be
dialysable is unknown.
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, integrase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AJ01.
Mechanism of action
Raltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor active against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV-1). Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of integrase, an HIV-encoded enzyme that is
required for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of
the HIV genome into the host cell genome. HIV genomes that fail to integrate cannot direct the
production of new infectious viral particles, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral
infection.
Antiviral activity in vitro
Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 
 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition (IC95) of HIV-1 replication
(relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the
cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, raltegravir inhibited viral replication in cultures of
mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with diverse, primary clinical
isolates of HIV-1, including isolates from 5 non-B subtypes, and isolates resistant to reverse
transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited
infection of 23 HIV isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes and 5 circulating recombinant forms with
IC50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM. 
Resistance
Most viruses isolated from patients failing raltegravir had high-level raltegravir resistance resulting
from the appearance of two or more mutations in integrase. Most had a signature mutation at amino
acid 155 (N155 changed to H), amino acid 148 (Q148 changed to H, K, or R), or amino acid 143
(Y143 changed to H, C, or R), along with one or more additional integrase mutations (e.g., L74M,
E92Q, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, S230R). The signature mutations decrease viral
susceptibility to raltegravir and addition of other mutations results in a further decrease in raltegravir
susceptibility. Factors that reduced the likelihood of developing resistance included lower baseline
viral load and use of other active anti-retroviral agents. Mutations conferring resistance to raltegravir
generally also confer resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir. Mutations at
amino acid 143 confer greater resistance to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q mutation
confers greater resistance to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harbouring a mutation at amino
88
acid 148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance mutations, may also have clinically
significant resistance to dolutegravir.
Clinical experience
The evidence of efficacy of raltegravir was based on the analyses of 96-week data from two
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2,
Protocols 018 and 019) in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adult patients and the
analysis of 240-week data from a randomised, double-blind, active-control trial (STARTMRK,
Protocol 021) in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients.
Efficacy
Treatment-experienced adult patients
BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trials) evaluated the safety and anti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. placebo in a
combination with optimised background therapy (OBT), in HIV-infected patients, 16 years or older,
with documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs) of
anti-retroviral therapies. Prior to randomisation, OBT were selected by the investigator based on the
patient's prior treatment history, as well as baseline genotypic and phenotypic viral resistance testing.
Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the
groups receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and placebo. Patients had prior exposure to a median
of 12 anti-retrovirals for a median of 10 years. A median of 4 ARTs was used in OBT. 
Results 48 week and 96 week analyses
Durable outcomes (Week 48 and Week 96) for patients on the recommended dose raltegravir 400 mg
twice daily from the pooled studies BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are shown in Table 3.

forward was used for virologic failures.
§ The Genotypic Sensitivity Score (GSS) was defined as the total oral ARTs in the optimised background therapy (OBT) to which a patient's viral isolate
showed genotypic sensitivity based upon genotypic resistance test. Enfuvirtide use in OBT in enfuvirtide-naïve patients was counted as one active drug in
OBT. Similarly, darunavir use in OBT in darunavir-naïve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT.

Raltegravir achieved virologic responses (using Not Completer=Failure approach) of HIV RNA
< 50 copies/mL in 61.7 % of patients at Week 16, in 62.1 % at Week 48 and in 57.0 % at Week 96.
Some patients experienced viral rebound between Week 16 and Week 96. Factors associated with
failure include high baseline viral load and OBT that did not include at least one potent active agent.
Switch to raltegravir
The SWITCHMRK 1 & 2 (Protocols 032 & 033) studies evaluated HIV-infected patients receiving
suppressive (screening HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL; stable regimen > 3 months) therapy with lopinavir
200 mg (+) ritonavir 50 mg 2 tablets twice daily plus at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors and randomised them 1:1 to continue lopinavir (+) ritonavir 2 tablets twice daily (n=174 and
n=178, respectively) or replace lopinavir (+) ritonavir with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (n=174 and
n=176, respectively). Patients with a prior history of virological failure were not excluded and the
number of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited. 
These studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they failed to
demonstrate non-inferiority of raltegravir versus lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In both studies at Week 24,
suppression of HIV RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 84.4 % of the raltegravir group
versus 90.6 % of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group, (Non-completers = Failure). See section 4.4
regarding the need to administer raltegravir with two other active agents.
Treatment-naïve adult patients
STARTMRK (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-control trial) evaluated the safety and
anti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime, in a
combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-naïve HIV-infected
patients with HIV RNA > 5,000 copies/mL. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV RNA
level (≤ 50,000 copies/mL; and > 50,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B or C status (positive or
negative).
Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the
group receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and the group receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime.
Results 48-week and 240-week analyses
With respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA
< 50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 241/280 (86.1 %) in the group receiving raltegravir and 230/281
(81.9 %) in the group receiving efavirenz. The treatment difference (raltegravir – efavirenz) was 4.2 %
with an associated 95 % CI of (-1.9, 10.3) establishing that raltegravir is non-inferior to efavirenz (p-
value for non-inferiority < 0.001). At Week 240, the treatment difference (raltegravir – efavirenz) was
9.5 % with an associated 95 % CI of (1.7, 17.3). Week 48 and Week 240 outcomes for patients on the
recommended dose of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily from STARTMRK are shown in Table 5.

Paediatric population
Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age
IMPAACT P1066 is a Phase I/II open label multicenter trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile,
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of raltegravir in HIV infected children. This study enrolled
126 treatment experienced children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age. Patients were stratified by
age, enrolling adolescents first and then successively younger children. Patients received either the
400 mg tablet formulation (6 to 18 years of age) or the chewable tablet formulation (2 to less than
12 years of age). Raltegravir was administered with an optimised background regimen.
The initial dose finding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Dose selection was based
upon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough concentration as seen in adults, and
acceptable short-term safety. After dose selection, additional patients were enrolled for evaluation of
long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy. Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of
raltegravir (see section 4.2).

As demonstrated in healthy volunteers administered single oral doses of raltegravir in the fasted state,
raltegravir is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 3 hours postdose. Raltegravir AUC and
Cmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Raltegravir C12 hr increases
dose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose
proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Dose proportionality has not been established
in patients.
With twice-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved rapidly, within approximately the
first 2 days of dosing. There is little to no accumulation in AUC and Cmax and evidence of slight
accumulation in C12 hr. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established.
Raltegravir may be administered with or without food. Raltegravir was administered without regard to
food in the pivotal safety and efficacy studies in HIV-infected patients. Administration of multiple
doses of raltegravir following a moderate-fat meal did not affect raltegravir AUC to a clinically
meaningful degree with an increase of 13 % relative to fasting. Raltegravir C12 hr was 66 % higher and
Cmax was 5 % higher following a moderate-fat meal compared to fasting. Administration of raltegravir
following a high-fat meal increased AUC and Cmax by approximately 2-fold and increased C12 hr by
4.1-fold. Administration of raltegravir following a low-fat meal decreased AUC and Cmax by 46 % and
52 %, respectively; C12 hr was essentially unchanged. Food appears to increase pharmacokinetic
variability relative to fasting.
94
Overall, considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. For observed
C12 hr in BENCHMRK 1 and 2 the coefficient of variation (CV) for inter-subject variability = 212 %
and the CV for intra-subject variability = 122 %. Sources of variability may include differences in
co-administration with food and concomitant medicines.
Distribution
Raltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to
10 µM. 
Raltegravir readily crossed the placenta in rats, but did not penetrate the brain to any appreciable
extent.
In two studies of HIV-1 infected patients who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was
readily detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the first study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid
concentration was 5.8 % (range 1 to 53.5 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. In the second
study (n=16), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 3 % (range 1 to 61 %) of the
corresponding plasma concentration. These median proportions are approximately 3- to 6-fold lower
than the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma.
Biotransformation and excretion
The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter α-phase half-life
(~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled
raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively. In
faeces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely to be derived from hydrolysis of
raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely
raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and
23 % of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented
approximately 70 % of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for
by raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the
formation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus, the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of
raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.
UGT1A1 Polymorphism
In a comparison of 30 subjects with *28/*28 genotype to 27 subjects with wild-type genotype, the
geometric mean ratio (90 % CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09) and the geometric mean ratio of C12 hr
was 1.91 (1.43, 2.55). Dose adjustment is not considered necessary in subjects with reduced UGT1A1
activity due to genetic polymorphism.
Special populations
Paediatric population
Based on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers, the chewable tablet and granules
for oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg tablet. In this study,
administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6 % decrease in AUC,
62 % decrease in Cmax, and 188 % increase in C12 hr compared to administration in the fasted state.
Administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir pharmacokinetics
to a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered without regard to food.
The effect of food on the granules for oral suspension formulation was not studied.

HIV-1 Exposed Neonates
IMPAACT P1110 is a Phase I trial to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of raltegravir granules
for suspension (GFS) with standard care PMTCT in full term HIV-1-exposed neonates. Cohort 1
(N=16, 10 exposed and 6 unexposed to raltegravir in utero) received 2 single doses of raltegravir GFS
(within 48 hours and 7 - 10 days after birth); Cohort 2 (N=26, all raltegravir unexposed in utero)
received raltegravir GFS for 6 weeks: 1.5 mg/kg once daily starting within 48 hours of birth through
Week 1; 3 mg/kg twice daily Weeks 2 to 4; and 6 mg/kg twice daily Weeks 5 and 6.
Table 9 displays pharmacokinetic parameters for neonates in Cohort 2 at birth and at 2 weeks of age.
Elimination of raltegravir in vivo in human is primarily through the UGT1A1-mediated
glucuronidation pathway. UGT1A1 catalytic activity is negligible at birth and matures after birth. The
dose recommended for neonates less than 4 weeks of age takes into consideration the rapidly
increasing UGT1A1 activity and drug clearance from birth to 4 weeks of age.

Elderly
There was no clinically meaningful effect of age on raltegravir pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects
and patients with HIV-1 infection, over the age range studied (19 to 84 years, with few individuals
over the age of 65).
96
Gender, race and BMI
There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences due to gender, race or body mass
index (BMI) in adults.
Renal impairment
Renal clearance of unchanged medicinal product is a minor pathway of elimination. In adults, there
were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with severe renal
insufficiency and healthy subjects (see section 4.2). Because the extent to which raltegravir may be
dialysable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided.
Hepatic impairment
Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. In adults, there were no clinically
important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency and
healthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has
not been studied (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical toxicology studies, including conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose
toxicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity and juvenile toxicity, have been conducted with
raltegravir in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Effects at exposure levels sufficiently in excess of clinical
exposure levels indicate no special hazard for humans.
Mutagenicity
No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames)
tests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal
aberration studies.
Carcinogenicity
A carcinogenicity study of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential. At the highest
dose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was similar to
that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. In rats, tumours (squamous cell carcinoma) of the
nose/nasopharynx were identified at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day in females and at 300 mg/kg/day in
males. This neoplasia could result from local deposition and/or aspiration of drug on the mucosa of the
nose/nasopharynx during oral gavage dosing and subsequent chronic irritation and inflammation; it is
likely that it is of limited relevance for the intended clinical use. At the NOAEL, systemic exposure
was similar to that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. Standard genotoxicity studies to evaluate
mutagenicity and clastogenicity were negative.
Developmental toxicity
Raltegravir was not teratogenic in developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. A slight increase
in incidence of supernumerary ribs, a variant in the normal developmental process, was observed in rat
foetuses of dams exposed to raltegravir at approximately 4.4-fold human exposure at 400 mg twice
daily based on AUC0-24 hr. No development effects were seen at 3.4-fold human exposure at 400 mg
twice daily based on AUC0-24 hr. Similar findings were not observed in rabbits.

child.
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
This medicine has been prescribed for you or your child only. Do not pass it on to others. It may

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What Isentress is and what it is used for
What Isentress is
Isentress contains the active substance raltegravir. Isentress is an antiviral medicine that works against
the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This is the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS).
How Isentress works
The virus produces an enzyme called HIV integrase. This helps the virus to multiply in the cells in
your body. Isentress stops this enzyme from working. When used with other medicines, Isentress may
reduce the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your "viral load") and increase your CD4-cell
count (a type of white blood cells that plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system
to help fight infection). Reducing the amount of HIV in the blood may improve the functioning of
your immune system. This means your body may fight infection better. 
When Isentress should be used
Isentress is used to treat those who are infected by HIV. Your doctor has prescribed Isentress to help
control your HIV infection.
2.  What you need to know before you take Isentress
Do not take Isentress:
If you are allergic to raltegravir or to any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in
section 6).

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Isentress.
Remember that Isentress is not a cure for HIV infection. This means that you may keep getting
infections or other illnesses associated with HIV. You should keep seeing your doctor regularly while
taking this medicine.
Mental health problems
Tell your doctor if you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. Depression, including
suicidal thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking this medicine, particularly
in patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness.
Bone problems
Some patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called
osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of
combination anti-retroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe reduction of the
activity of the immune system, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk
factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains
(especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these
symptoms, please inform your doctor.
Liver problems
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have had problems with your liver before, including
hepatitis B or C. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can
take this medicine.
Infections
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection, such as
fever, and/or feeling unwell. In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of
opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon
after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the
body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no
obvious symptoms. 
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness,
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations,
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.
Muscle problems
Contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain,
tenderness, or weakness while taking this medicine.
Skin problems
Contact your doctor promptly if you develop a rash. Severe and life-threatening skin reactions and
allergic reactions have been reported in some patients taking this medicine.
Other medicines and Isentress
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines
with or without a prescription.
Isentress might interact with other medicines.
125
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take:
antacids (an agent that counteracts or neutralises the acid in the stomach to relieve indigestion
and heartburn). It is not recommended to take Isentress with certain antacids (those containing
aluminium and/or magnesium). Talk to your doctor about other antacids you can take.
iron salts (to treat and prevent iron deficiency or anemia). You should wait at least two hours
between taking iron salts and taking Isentress, as these medicines may reduce Isentress efficacy.
rifampicin (a medicine used to treat some infections such as tuberculosis), as it may decrease
your levels of Isentress. Your doctor may consider increasing your dose of Isentress if you are
taking rifampicin.
Taking Isentress with food and drink
See section 3.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be
passed on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your
doctor as soon as possible.
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant or
breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
Do not operate machines, drive or cycle if you feel dizzy after taking this medicine.
Isentress contains lactose
This medicine contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to
some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
Isentress contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
3.  How to take Isentress
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. You should check
with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. Isentress must be used in combination with
other medicines for HIV.
How much to take
Adults
The recommended dose is 1 tablet (400 mg) by mouth twice a day.
Use in children and adolescents
The recommended dose of Isentress is 400 mg by mouth, twice a day for adolescents and children
weighing at least 25 kg.
Do not chew, crush or split the tablets because it may change the level of medicine in your body. This
medicine can be taken with or without food or drink.
Isentress is also available in a 600 mg tablet, a chewable tablet and in granules for oral suspension. 
Do not switch between the 400 mg tablet, the 600 mg tablet, chewable tablet or granules for oral
suspension without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.


 
If you take more Isentress than you should
Do not take more tablets than the doctor recommends. If you do take too many tablets, contact your
doctor.
If you forget to take Isentress
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it.
However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular
schedule. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Isentress
It is important that you take Isentress exactly as your doctor has instructed. Do not change the dose or
stop taking this medicine without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Do not stop
taking it because:
It is very important to take all your HIV medicines as prescribed and at the right times of day.
This can help your medicines work better. It also lowers the chance that your medicines will
stop being able to fight HIV (also called "drug resistance").
  When your supply of Isentress starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacy. This is
because it is very important not to be without the medicine, even for a short time. During a short
break in taking the medicine the amount of virus in your blood may increase. This may mean
that the HIV virus will develop resistance to Isentress and become harder to treat.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What Isentress is and what it is used for
What Isentress is
Isentress contains the active substance raltegravir. Isentress is an antiviral medicine that works against
the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This is the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS).
How Isentress works
The virus produces an enzyme called HIV integrase. This helps the virus to multiply in the cells in
your body. Isentress stops this enzyme from working. When used with other medicines, Isentress may
reduce the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your "viral load") and increase your CD4-cell
count (a type of white blood cells that plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system
to help fight infection). Reducing the amount of HIV in the blood may improve the functioning of
your immune system. This means your body may fight infection better. 
When Isentress should be used
Isentress 600 mg film-coated tablets is used to treat adults and paediatric patients weighing at least
40 kg who are infected by HIV. Your doctor has prescribed Isentress to help control your HIV
infection.
2.  What you need to know before you take Isentress
Do not take Isentress:
If you are allergic to raltegravir or to any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in
section 6).

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Isentress.
Remember that Isentress is not a cure for HIV infection. This means that you may keep getting
infections or other illnesses associated with HIV. You should keep seeing your doctor regularly while
taking this medicine.
Mental health problems
Tell your doctor if you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. Depression, including
suicidal thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking this medicine, particularly
in patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness.
Bone problems
Some patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called
osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of
combination anti-retroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe reduction of the
activity of the immune system, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk
factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains
(especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these
symptoms, please inform your doctor.
Liver problems
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have had problems with your liver before, including
hepatitis B or C. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can
take this medicine.
Infections
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection, such as
fever, and/or feeling unwell. In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of
opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon
after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the
body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no
obvious symptoms. 
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness,
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations,
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.
Muscle problems
Contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain,
tenderness, or weakness while taking this medicine.
Skin problems
Contact your doctor promptly if you develop a rash. Severe and life-threatening skin reactions and
allergic reactions have been reported in some patients taking this medicine.
Other medicines and Isentress
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines.
Isentress might interact with other medicines. Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking,
have recently taken or might take:
antacids (an agent that counteracts or neutralises the acid in the stomach to relieve indigestion
and heartburn)
133

 
iron salts (to treat and prevent iron deficiency or anemia). You should wait at least two hours
between taking iron salts and taking Isentress, as these medicines may reduce Isentress efficacy
atazanavir (an antiretroviral medication)
rifampicin (a medicine used to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)
tipranavir/ritonavir (antiretroviral medicines)
Keep a list of all your medicines to show your doctor and pharmacist.
You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of medicines that interact with Isentress.
Do not start taking a new medicine without telling your doctor. Your doctor can tell you if it is
safe to take Isentress with other medicines.
Taking Isentress with food and drink
See section 3.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Isentress 1,200 mg (two 600 mg tablets once daily) is not recommended in pregnancy because it
has not been studied in pregnant women.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be
passed on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your
doctor as soon as possible.
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant or
breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
Do not operate machines, drive or cycle if you feel dizzy after taking this medicine.
Isentress contains lactose
This medicine contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to
some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
Isentress contains sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
3.  How to take Isentress
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. You should check
with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. Isentress must be used in combination with
other medicines for HIV.
How much to take
Adults, children and adolescents weighing at least 40 kg
The recommended dose is 1,200 mg taken as two 600 mg tablets taken by mouth once a day.
Do not chew, crush or split the tablets because it may change the level of medicine in your body. This
medicine can be taken with or without food or drink.
Isentress is also available in a 400 mg tablet, a chewable tablet and in granules for oral suspension.
Do not switch between the 600 mg tablet, 400 mg tablet, chewable tablet or granules for oral
suspension without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

If you take more Isentress than you should
Do not take more tablets than the doctor recommends. If you do take too many tablets, contact your
doctor.
If you forget to take Isentress
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. 
However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular
schedule. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Isentress
It is important that you take Isentress exactly as your doctor has instructed. Do not change the dose or
stop taking this medicine without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
Do not stop taking it because:
It is very important to take all your HIV medicines as prescribed and at the right times of day.
This can help your medicines work better. It also lowers the chance that your medicines will
stop being able to fight HIV (also called "drug resistance").
When your supply of Isentress starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacy. This is
because it is very important not to be without the medicine, even for a short time. During a short
break in taking the medicine the amount of virus in your blood may increase. This may mean
that the HIV virus will develop resistance to Isentress and become harder to treat.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

1.  What Isentress is and what it is used for
What Isentress is
Isentress contains the active substance raltegravir. Isentress is an antiviral medicine that works against
the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This is the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS).
How Isentress works
The virus produces an enzyme called HIV integrase. This helps the virus to multiply in the cells in
your body. Isentress stops this enzyme from working. When used with other medicines, Isentress may
reduce the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your "viral load") and increase your CD4-cell
count (a type of white blood cells that plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system
to help fight infection). Reducing the amount of HIV in the blood may improve the functioning of
your immune system. This means your body may fight infection better. 
When Isentress should be used
Isentress is used to treat those who are infected by HIV. Your doctor has prescribed Isentress to help
control your HIV infection.
2.  What you need to know before you take Isentress
Do not take Isentress
If you are allergic to raltegravir or to any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in
section 6).

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Isentress.
Remember that Isentress is not a cure for HIV infection. This means that you may keep getting
infections or other illnesses associated with HIV. You should keep seeing your doctor regularly while
taking this medicine.
Mental health problems
Tell your doctor if you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. Depression, including
suicidal thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking this medicine, particularly
in patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness.
Bone problems 
Some patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called
osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of
combination anti-retroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe reduction of the
activity of the immune system, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk
factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains
(especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these
symptoms, please inform your doctor. 
Liver problems
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have had problems with your liver before, including
hepatitis B or C. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can
take this medicine.
Infections
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection, such as
fever, and/or feeling unwell. In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of
opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon
after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the
body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no
obvious symptoms. 
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness,
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations,
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.
Muscle problems
Contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain,
tenderness, or weakness while taking this medicine.
Skin problems
Contact your doctor promptly if you develop a rash. Severe and life-threatening skin reactions and
allergic reactions have been reported in some patients taking this medicine.
Other medicines and Isentress
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines
with or without a prescription.
Isentress might interact with other medicines.
141
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take:
antacids (an agent that counteracts or neutralises the acid in the stomach to relieve indigestion
and heartburn). It is not recommended to take Isentress with certain antacids (those containing
aluminium and/or magnesium). Talk to your doctor about other antacids you can take.
iron salts (to treat and prevent iron deficiency or anemia). You should wait at least two hours
between taking iron salts and taking Isentress, as these medicines may reduce Isentress efficacy.
rifampicin (a medicine used to treat some infections such as tuberculosis), as it may decrease
your levels of Isentress. Your doctor may consider increasing your dose of Isentress if you are
taking rifampicin.
Taking Isentress with food and drink
See section 3.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Isentress chewable tablets are not recommended in pregnancy because they have not been
studied in pregnant women. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be
passed on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your
doctor as soon as possible.
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant or
breast-feeding.

Do not operate machines, drive or cycle if you feel dizzy after taking this medicine.

3.  How to take Isentress
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. You should check
with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. Isentress must be used in combination with
other medicines for HIV.
The 100 mg chewable tablet can be split into equal halves. However, breaking the tablets should be
avoided whenever possible.
How much to take
Dose for children of 2 through 11 years of age
The doctor will work out the right dose of the chewable tablet based on the age and weight of the
child. This dose must not exceed 300 mg twice a day. The doctor will tell you how many chewable
tablets the child must take.
Isentress is also available in a 400 mg tablet, a 600 mg tablet and in granules for oral suspension.
Do not switch between the chewable tablet, granules for oral suspension, 600 mg tablet or 400 mg
tablet without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
Children should keep scheduled doctor’s visits because their Isentress dosage should be adjusted as
they get older, grow or gain weight. Their doctor may also want to prescribe the 400 mg tablet when
they are able to swallow a tablet.
You can take this medicine with or without food or drink.
143
If you take more Isentress than you should
Do not take more tablets than the doctor recommends. If you do take too many tablets, contact your
doctor.
If you forget to take Isentress
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. 
However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular
schedule. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Isentress
It is important that you take Isentress exactly as your doctor has instructed. Do not change the dose or
stop taking this medicine without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Do not stop
taking it because:
It is very important to take all your HIV medicines as prescribed and at the right times of day.
This can help your medicines work better. It also lowers the chance that your medicines will
stop being able to fight HIV (also called "drug resistance").
  When your supply of Isentress starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacy. This is
because it is very important not to be without the medicine, even for a short time. During a short
break in taking the medicine the amount of virus in your blood may increase. This may mean
that the HIV virus will develop resistance to Isentress and become harder to treat.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

1.  What Isentress is and what it is used for
What Isentress is
Isentress contains the active substance raltegravir. Isentress is an antiviral medicine that works against
the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This is the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS).
How Isentress works
The virus produces an enzyme called HIV integrase. This helps the virus to multiply in the cells in
your body. Isentress stops this enzyme from working. When used with other medicines, Isentress may
reduce the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your "viral load") and increase your CD4-cell

to help fight infection). Reducing the amount of HIV in the blood may improve the functioning of
your immune system. This means your body may fight infection better. 
When Isentress should be used
Isentress is used to treat adults, adolescents, children, toddlers and infants who are infected by HIV
and to treat newborn babies exposed to HIV-1 infection from the mother. Your doctor has prescribed
Isentress to help control your HIV infection.
2.  What you need to know before you take Isentress
Do not take Isentress
If you are allergic to raltegravir or to any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in
section 6.).

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Isentress.
Remember that Isentress is not a cure for HIV infection. This means that you may keep getting
infections or other illnesses associated with HIV. You should keep seeing your doctor regularly while
taking this medicine.
Mental health problems
Tell your doctor if you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. Depression, including
suicidal thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking this medicine, particularly
in patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness.
Bone problems
Some patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called
osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of
combination anti-retroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe reduction of the
activity of the immune system, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk
factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains
(especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these
symptoms, please inform your doctor. 
Liver problems
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have had problems with your liver before, including
hepatitis B or C. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can
take this medicine.
Infections
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection, such as
fever, and/or feeling unwell. In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of
opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon
after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the

In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the

treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness,
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations,
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.
Muscle problems
Contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain,
tenderness, or weakness while taking this medicine.
Skin problems
Contact your doctor promptly if you develop a rash. Severe and life-threatening skin reactions and
allergic reactions have been reported in some patients taking this medicine.
Other medicines and Isentress
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines
with or without a prescription.
Isentress might interact with other medicines. 
150
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take:
antacids (an agent that counteracts or neutralises the acid in the stomach to relieve indigestion
and heartburn). It is not recommended to take Isentress with certain antacids (those containing
aluminium and/or magnesium). Talk to your doctor about other antacids you can take.
iron salts (to treat and prevent iron deficiency or anemia). You should wait at least two hours
between taking iron salts and taking Isentress, as these medicines may reduce Isentress efficacy.
rifampicin (a medicine used to treat some infections such as tuberculosis), as it may decrease
your levels of Isentress. Your doctor may consider increasing your dose of Isentress if you are
taking rifampicin.
Taking Isentress with food and drink

3.  How to take Isentress
Always give this medicine to your child exactly as their doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. You
should check with your child’s doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. Isentress must be used
in combination with other medicines for HIV.
See the instructions for use in the booklet for how to prepare and give a dose of Isentress. Keep
the booklet and follow it each time you prepare the medicine. Bring this booklet to your child’s
appointments.

Make sure the doctor, pharmacist or nurse explains how to mix and give the right dose to your
child. 
The granules need to be mixed with water before use. You must give to your child within
30 minutes of mixing.
The dose will change over time. Make sure to follow the instructions of your doctor. The doctor
will tell you if and when to stop giving Isentress to your baby.
How much to take
The doctor will work out the right dose of granules for oral suspension based on the age and weight of
the infant or toddler. The doctor will tell you how much of the oral suspension the infant or toddler
must take.
Your child can take this medicine with or without food or drink.
Isentress is also available in a 400 mg tablet, a 600 mg tablet and in a chewable tablet.
Do not switch between the granules for oral suspension, chewable tablet, 600 mg tablet or 400 mg
tablet without first talking to your child’s doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
Children should keep scheduled doctor’s visits because their Isentress dosage should be adjusted as
they get older, grow or gain weight. Their doctor may also want to prescribe the chewable tablet when
they are able to chew a tablet.
If you take more Isentress than you should
Do not take more Isentress than the doctor recommends. If you do take more than you should, contact
your doctor.
If you forget to take Isentress
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it.
However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular
schedule. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Isentress
It is important that you take Isentress exactly as your doctor has instructed. Do not change the dose or
stop taking this medicine without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Do not stop
taking it because:
It is very important to take all your HIV medicines as prescribed and at the right times of day.
This can help your medicines work better. It also lowers the chance that your medicines will
stop being able to fight HIV (also called "drug resistance").
When your supply of Isentress starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacy. This is
because it is very important not to be without the medicine, even for a short time. During a short
break in taking the medicine the amount of virus in your blood may increase. This may mean
that the HIV virus will develop resistance to Isentress and become harder to treat.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Step 2. Fill a glass with water
Fill the clean glass with room-temperature drinking water 
from your tap or using bottled still water.
Step 3. Fill the blue syringe with water
Push the plunger of the blue syringe
into the syringe as far as it goes. 
Put the tip of the syringe into the glass of water. 
Pull back the plunger. 
Stop when you get to the 10 mL mark.
Step 4. Check for air bubbles
Hold the syringe with tip up. 
Tap it with your finger to move any 
air bubbles up.
Slowly push up on the plunger to make the air come out.
159
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Re-check the amount of water in the
syringe. If it is less than 10 mL, put the tip
back into the water and pull back on the
plunger until you get to the 10 mL mark.
Step 5. Add the 10 mL of water to the mixing cup
Step 6. Add Isentress to the cup
Note before adding Isentress:
Make sure you and your child are ready! After mixing Isentress, use it within 30 minutes. 
Throw away any leftover Isentress after you have given the dose to your child.
Take 1 sachet of ISENTRESS and
shake the granules to the bottom of
the sachet.
Tear or cut open the sachet and 
add all of the granules to the water 
in the mixing cup. Make sure 
the sachet is completely empty.  
Step 7. Mix Isentress and water
Snap the lid of the mixing cup shut.
Gently swirl the mixing cup for
45 seconds in a circular motion to 
mix the granules and water. Use a 
clock or timer to time for 45 seconds. 
DO NOT SHAKE the mixture
160
 
 
 
 
Check to make sure the granules are mixed. 
If it is not mixed, swirl it some more. 
The mixture should look cloudy.
Step 8. Check your prescription
Use the dose amount in ‘mL’ prescribed by the doctor.
Remember that the dose may change each time you go to the doctor, so make sure you have all the
recent information. Be sure to go to all of your doctor’s appointments so your child gets the right dose!
Step 9. Choose the syringe you need 
Choose the correct syringe for your child’s dose:
WHITE
(1 mL)
for 1 mL or less
GREEN
(3 mL)
BLUE
(10 mL)
for 1.5 mL to 3 mL
for 3.5 mL to 10 mL
Move this part of 
the plunger
to the correct mark
on the syringe
Then find the mL mark on the syringe barrel that matches your child’s dose.
Step 10. Measure Isentress
Push the plunger into the barrel 
of the syringe as far as it goes.
161
 
 
 
 
 
 
Put the tip of the syringe into 
the cup of the prepared Isentress and pull back 
on the plunger.
Stop when you get to the line 
that matches your child’s 
prescribed dose.
IMPORTANT:
• 
• 
Your child’s dose may be different from the one shown in this figure.
There will usually be some leftover, prepared Isentress in the mixing cup.
Step 11. Check for air bubbles
Hold the syringe with tip up.
Tap it with your finger 
to move any air bubbles up.
Slowly push the plunger to make the air come out.
Re-check the amount of Isentress in the syringe. 
If it is less than the prescribed dose, put the tip back into the cup of prepared Isentress and pull back on
the plunger until you get to the right dose mark.
Step 12. Give Isentress to your baby
Place the tip of the syringe 
inside your child’s mouth so 
that it touches either the right 
or left cheek.
Slowly push in the plunger to give the prepared Isentress. If your child fusses, take the tip of the
syringe out of the mouth and try again. It is important that your child takes all of the prescribed dose
(a little left in the syringe tip is OK).
162
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IMPORTANT: If your child does not take all of the prescribed dose or spits some of it out, call
your doctor to find out what to do.
Step 13. Clean up
Pour the leftover prepared Isentress into the rubbish.
Do not pour it into the sink.
Pull the plungers out of any syringes you used.
Hand wash the syringes, plungers, and mixing cup 
with warm water and dishwashing soap. 
Do not wash in the dishwasher.
Rinse with water and air dry.
Put everything in a clean, dry place. 
How should I store Isentress?
Store in the original package in order to protect from moisture.
Do not open the Isentress sachets until you are ready to prepare a dose.
Be sure to keep your doctor’s appointments so you always know how much Isentress to give.

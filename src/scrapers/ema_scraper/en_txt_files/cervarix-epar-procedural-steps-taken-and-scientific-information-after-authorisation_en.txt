SmPC and PL 
Section 4.5 of the SmPC was updated to reflect that 
the concomitant administration of Cervarix with 
meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135, Y tetanus 
toxoid conjugate vaccine (Nimenrix), based on 
results from study MENACWY-TT-054. This is a phase 
III, open, randomised, controlled, multicentre study 
aimed to assess the immunogenicity and 
reactogenicity of Nimenrix administered alone as 
compared to Nimenrix co-administered with HPV 
vaccine Cervarix or co-administered with Cervarix 
and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and 
acellular pertussis vaccine adsorbed (Boostrix) in 
female adolescents and adults at 9 to 25 years of 
age; as requested in the CHMP conclusion of 
procedure P46/093. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. 
Cervarix may be administered concomitantly with 
meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135, Y tetanus toxoid 
conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT) based on results of study 
MENACWY-TT-054. The study data demonstrated that 
Cervarix can be given concomitantly with Nimenrix 
(MenACWY-TT vaccine) with no impact on the immune 
response to the human papilloma virus (HPV) 16/18 
antigens. In addition, co-administration of Cervarix with 
Nimenrix and/or Boostrix (diphtheria, tetanus and acellular 
pertussis (dTpa) vaccine) is well tolerated. The safety and 
reactogenicity data did not raise any concern. Data also 
show that co-administration of Cervarix, Nimenrix and 
Boostrix resulted in lower antibody concentrations against 
each pertussis antigen compared to co-administration of 
Cervarix and Boostrix. The immunological interference is 
not related to co-administration of Cervarix. Despite the

The efficacy of Cervarix was assessed in a double-blind, 
the clinical efficacy of Cervarix in women aged 26 
years and older, based on the submission of the final 
report for study HPV-015 (MEA 083); this is a phase 
III, double-blind, randomized, controlled study to 
evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of 
HPV16/18 L1/AS04 vaccine administered 
randomised Phase III clinical trial (HPV-015) that included 
a total of 5778 women aged 26-72 years (median: 37.0 
years). Final analysis was performed at study conclusion, 7 
years after 1st vaccination. At final analysis at 84 months 
post-vaccination (M84), a new medical review of new onset 
of adverse events collected up to 48 months post-
Page 11/39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
intramuscularly according to a three-dose schedule 
(0, 1, 6 month) in healthy adult female subjects 
aged 26 years and above. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered

of studies to the competent authority 
vaccination (M48) was performed at M84. An additional 
analysis on potential immune mediated diseases and 
pregnancy outcomes collected at M48 was also done at 
M84. 
The primary endpoint of study HPV-105 was a combination 
of a virological and a histopathological endpoint: human 
papilloma virus types (HPV-16/18) related 6 month 
persistence infection and/or cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia (CIN1+). The primary analyses of efficacy were 
performed on the according to protocol (ATP) cohort for 
efficacy and the total vaccinated cohort (TVC) which 
included a subset of up to 15% of women with a history of 
human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated infection or 
disease (defined as two or more abnormal smears in 
sequence, abnormal colposcopy, or biopsy or treatment of 
the cervix after abnormal smear or colposcopy findings). 
Inclusion of this subset allowed assessment of prophylactic 
efficacy in a population that is thought to reflect a real-
world setting, as adult women are the age group generally 
targeted for cervical screening. There is no evidence 
whether prevention of persistent infection that lasts for at 
least 6 months is a relevant surrogate marker for cervical 
cancer prevention in women aged 26 years and above.  
Amongst the adverse drug reations reported from study 
HPV-015 and present at a higher frequency in Cervarix 
than in control group, all were already listed or can be 
linked to already listed terms. All terms already listed were 
reported at frequencies inferior or equal to those currently 
reported in the SmPC. Overall, No new safety signals were 
observed.

12/01/2016 
726/2004, the European Commission requested on 
09 July 2015 the opinion of the European Medicines 
Agency on whether there is evidence of a causal 
association between HPV vaccination and CRPS 
and/or POTS, and if available information may 
require updates to the advice to healthcare 
professionals and patients, including changes to 
product information or other regulatory measures on 
the marketing authorisations concerned.

The purpose of this variation is to update the SmPC for 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Cervarix to 
extend the existing 0, 6 months vaccination schedule 
to a flexible 0, 5-13 months schedule in girls aged 9-
14 years old.  
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
Cervarix with a flexible 2-dose schedule (0, 5-13 months) 
in females aged 9-14 years old.  
In support of this variation application, results from the 
ongoing study HPV-070 up to Month 13 (six months post 
last vaccination in 2-dose [0,6-month] and 3-dose [0,1,6-
month] groups and one month post last vaccination in the 
2-dose [0,12-month] group) have been submitted . 
Study HPV-070 is a phase IIIb, open-label, randomised, 
age-stratified, multi-centre trial designed to assess the 
Page 18/39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
immunogenicity and safety of Cervarix when administered 
according to alternative 2-dose schedules (0, 6 or 0, 12 
months) in 9-14 years old healthy females compared to a 
standard 3-dose schedule of Cervarix in 15-25 years old 
healthy females. 
The acceptability of a 2-dose schedule for Cervarix was 
previously evaluated and approved based in the results of 
the proof-of-concept study HPV-048 and study HPV-070 
(with data up to week 7).  
Based on the available data, the CHMP endorsed in this 
variation the introduction of a flexible 2-dose schedule (0, 
5-13 months) in females aged 9-14 years.  
However, demonstrating persistent clinical protection (e.g. 
against persistent infection and premalignant lesions) 
among 9-14 years old girls vaccinated with the 2-dose 
schedule remains a major challenge. The value of statistical 
modeling in predicting antibody concentrations up to 20 
years, or beyond, after the first vaccine dose remains 
unknown. To address this, the MAH previously committed 
to perform an observational trial in the context of the 
previously approved 2-dose schedule of 0, 6 months.  
The CHMP was of the view that other options should be 
explored so as to address potential immunogenicity waning 
and/or demonstration of persistent clinical protection with 
the new, flexible 2-dose schedule. These issues are 
addressed and under assessment in dossier EMEA-H-C-
721-REC 076. 
The benefit-risk balance of Cervarix remains positive.

concept study HPV-048 showing that a 2-dose schedule of 
Cervarix administered at 0, 6 months in 9-14 years old 
females was non-inferior to the standard 3-dose schedule 
in females aged 15-25 years, the MAH conducted study 
HPV-070 as a phase III confirmatory immunobridging 
study. Efficacy data in subjects receiving 2-doses of 
Cervarix in 2 large phase III studies (studies HPV-008 and 
HPV-009) was provided as supportive evidence, along with 
data obtained from the surveillance of HPV-specific 
infection after introduction of the National HPV 
Immunisation Program in the UK in girls aged 12-13 years. 
The overall immunogenicity and safety data provided 
demonstrate the non-inferiority of a 0, 6 months schedule 
in 9-14 years old girls vs. the standard 3-dose schedule. 
The 2-dose schedule using an interval of 5 to 7 months 
provides a suitable alternative to the 3-dose schedule as it 
may improve the vaccine’s coverage.

efficacy was demonstrated in women 26 year and older 
against 6 month persistent infection and/or CIN1+ 
associated with HPV16/18 infection in both the ATP and 
TVC cohorts. Cross protection, measured as significant 
vaccine efficacy against 6 month persistent infection, was 
demonstrated against HPV-31 and HPV-45 in the ATP 
cohort, and with regard to immunogenicity, seropositivity 
was demonstrated at month 48 for HPV-16 and HPV-18 in 
the initially seronegative population. These data showed 
the overall efficacy of Cervarix in women 26 years and 
older. At the 48-month time point, i.e. 42 months after

the month 36 final analysis of the study HPV-023, 
which is the long-term follow-up for up to 9.4 years 
(113 months) of vaccine efficacy, immunogenicity 
and safety of the primary study, HPV-001. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
(pooled) analysis, the vaccine efficacy was in general 
similar or higher in the Total cohort than in the ATP cohort, 
mostly due to a higher incidence of cases in the placebo 
group. An overall efficacy against non-vaccine types could 
not be demonstrated due to the limited sample size and low 
prevalence of non-vaccine subtypes. 
HPV 023 long term study results showed high and 
sustained immunogenicity over 113 months of follow-up for 
both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies. No safety 
signals were identified during the course of Study HPV-023. 
The safety analysis did not show any clinically relevant 
differences between the vaccine and control groups

protection against other oncogenic HPV types, which 
generally confirmed the results observed at final analysis. 
No clinically differences in overall safety outcomes have 
been identified and compliance with the full vaccination 
course was equally high between treatment groups. The 
end-of-study analysis provides longer follow-up data and 
the risk/benefit balance of Cervarix remains favourable.

immunogenicity data. In study 023, 111 subjects in the 
vaccine group had immunogenicity data at the [M83-M88] 
interval after the first vaccine dose with a median follow-up 
of 7 years. Of these subjects, 100% remained seropositive 
for HPV-16 and HPV-18. Furthermore vaccine-induced IgG 
GMTs for both HPV-16 and HPV-18 peaked at month 7 and 
then declined to reach a plateau from month 18 up to the 
[M83-M88] interval with ELISA GMTs for both HPV-16 and

angioedema and syncope or vasovagal responses to 
injection, sometimes accompanied by tonic-clonic 
movements, as undesirable effects observed during 
postmarketing surveillance, following evaluation of 
the periodic safety update report (PSUR). 
The MAH also took this opportunity to update section

post-marketing experience: allergic reactions (including 
anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions), angioedema, 
lymphadenopathy and syncope or vasovagal responses to 
injection, sometimes accompanied by tonic-clonic 
movements. 
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any 
vaccination especially in adolescents as a psychogenic 
response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied 
by several neurological signs such as transient visual 
disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements 
during recovery. A warning was included to alert health 
care professionals to put procedures in place to avoid injury

The MAH has provided results obtained after 7 months of 
the study. The results show that Cervarix can be 
administered concomitantly with a combined booster 
vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis 
[acellular] with or without inactivated poliomyelitis, (dTpa, 
dTpa-IPV vaccines), with no clinically relevant interference 
with antibody response to any of the components of either 
vaccine. 
Safety data obtained in this study does not indicate a 
deterioration of the safety profiles of both vaccines if given 
concomitantly or in a sequential way. 
If Cervarix is to be given at the same time as another 
injectable vaccine, the vaccines should always be 
administered at a separate injection site (another part of 
your body, e.g. the other arm) during the same visit.

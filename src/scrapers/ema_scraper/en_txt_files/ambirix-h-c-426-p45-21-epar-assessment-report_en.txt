I. 
INTRODUCTION 
On  9th  December  2008  the  MAH  submitted  four  completed  paediatric  studies  relevant  to  Ambirix  and 
Twinrix Paediatric in accordance with Article 45 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended on 
medicinal products for paediatric use. 
A short critical expert overview was provided for each study. 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  submitted  paediatric  studies  do  not  influence  the  benefit  risk  for  Ambirix  or 
Twinrix Paediatric and that there is no consequential regulatory action. 
The  assessor  agrees  that  the  MAH  has  fulfilled  Article  45  for  the  two  vaccines  as  a  result  of  this 
submission and that there are no implications for the prescribing information.

II.1 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the clinical studies 
Ambirix  is  the  exact  same  product  as  Twinrix  Adult  and  therefore  contains  twice  as  much  inactivated 
HAV  (720  EL.U/ml  compared  to  360  EL.U/ml)  and  rHBsAg  (20  μg  rHBsAg  compared  to  10  µg)  as 
Twinrix Paediatric.  
Both products may be used to immunise children aged from 1-15 years against hepatitis A and B but offer 
the alternative of two doses of Ambirix administered at least 6 months apart versus a standard three-dose 
regimen of Twinrix Paediatric administered at 0, 1 and 6 months.  
The  advantage  of  the  Twinrix  Paediatric  three-dose  regimen  is  that  a  higher  degree  of  protection 
(especially against hepatitis B) can be expected between months 1 and 6 compared to that between months 
0  and  6-12  of  a  two-dose  Ambirix  regimen.  Therefore  the  choice  between  products  depends  on  how 
quickly it is desired to elicit a high level of immunity to both viruses. If there is no hurry then prescribers, 
parents and children may prefer the 2-dose Ambirix due to the lesser number of injections.    
Due to the overlapping nature of these products and their relevance to the paediatric population the 
Rapporteur has chosen to include the four studies in a single assessment report.

Clinical aspects 
1. 
Introduction 
The MAH submitted reports for: 
Ambirix: 
Twinrix Paediatric 
Studies HAB-051, -052 and -053 
Study HAB-164 Ext 038 Year 10  
2.  Clinical studies 
HAB-051 
The study was conducted in Taiwan in 1997-1998 and the study report is dated October 29th 1998. 
• 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
To compare the immunogenicity of Ambirix administered alone with that of Havrix and Engerix B (both 
adult dose versions) when given concomitantly into opposite arms.   
Secondary Objective 
To evaluate the reactogenicity after each dose of Ambirix compared to co-administration of Havrix and 
Engerix B. 
• 
Study design 
This was an open, randomised study in which 64 subjects were to receive Ambirix or Havrix + Engerix B 
with dosing at Month 0 and Month 6. Blood samples were obtained on the day of screening and at months 
1, 6, and 7 for assay of anti-HAV and anti-HBsAg antibodies. 
Approximately six hours post vaccination and in the morning for three subsequent days parents were to 
record  general  (systemic)  and  local  injection  site  signs  and  symptoms,  including  axillary  body 
temperature.   
• 
Study population /Sample size 
Subjects were to be between 1 and 11 years old and seronegative for anti-HAV and anti-HBs at screening. 
The  sample  size  calculation  was  based  on  the  primary  serological  end-points  but  was  not  fixed  by  a 
statistical  method.  The  number  selected  was  considered  sufficient  to  draw  valid  clinical  conclusions. 
Results  of  similar  studies  showed  that  seroconversion  rates  after  Havrix  and  seroprotection  rates  after 
Engerix-B were both 95 %. With 50 completed and evaluable subjects by group, a power of 80 % and an 
alpha level of 5 % using the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, a 25 % difference between the two 
groups could be detected for either the anti-HAV seroconversion rate or the anti-HBs seroprotection rate. 
• 
Treatments 
Group 1 received Ambirix and Group 2 received full strength Havrix + Engerix B. Single lots were used.

Seroconversion rates for hepatitis A and seroprotection rates for hepatitis B 
GMTs at month 7 
Nature and incidence of the reactions after each dose administration. 
Statistical Methods 
Two analyses were performed: ATP and ITT. 
Seropositivity was defined as the appearance of antibodies ≥ 1 mIU/ml for anti-HBs and ≥33mIU/ml for 
anti-HAV.  Seroprotection against  HBV  was  defined as  anti-HBs  ≥  10  mIU/ml.  The seroconversion and 
seroprotection rates were compared using Fisher’s exact test. The corresponding GMTs were compared by 
the ANOVA one-way test or by a nonparametric test (Kruskal-Wallis test). 
  Results 
• 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Two of the 64 volunteers enrolled were eliminated from the analysis of reactogenicity as one of the study 
vaccine doses was not administered. One subject was eliminated from the immunogenicity analysis as no 
blood sampling was done at month 7. Hence, 61 completed the study up to month 7. 
• 
Baseline data 
• 
Immunogenicity 
Hepatitis A  
All subjects seroconverted after a single dose of vaccine except for one in the Ambirix group. All subjects 
were seropositive at Month 7 with comparable GMTs between vaccine groups. The increases in anti-HAV 
GMTs from month 1 to month 7 were 88.7% and 91.8%.

Hepatitis B 
One month after the first dose > 90% had already seroconverted and about 80% were seroprotected. At 
month 7, all subjects were seropositive, all except one was seroprotected and the GMTs were comparable.

Safety  
Overall,  solicited  or  unsolicited  signs  and  symptoms  within  the  4-day  follow-up  periods  were  reported 
following  24.2%  of  doses  of  Ambirix  and  66.1%  of  doses  in  the  HAV+HBV  group.  Local  symptoms 
predominated. The rates of solicited symptoms can be summarised as follows: 
All solicited local signs and symptoms were assumed to be related to vaccination. After all doses, redness 
at  the  injection  site  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  local  symptom.  One  local  injection  site 
symptom was grade 3. All solicited local symptoms resolved within the 4-day follow-up period. 
Following  dose  1  and  dose  2,  the  concomitant  HAV+HBV  group  had  a  higher  incidence  of  local 
symptoms.

Headache  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  symptom.  All  general  solicited  signs  and 
symptoms except two cases of fatigue were considered to be unrelated to the vaccines. None was of grade 
3 and most lasted less than one day. 
One subject reported 3 unsolicited symptoms within 30 days of the first dose. All the three symptoms were 
grade 1 and were considered to be unrelated to vaccination. 
No serious adverse event was reported in the study and no subject received concomitant medication.

HAB-052 
This study was also conducted in Taiwan but from 1996-1998 at a different site and in adolescents aged 
from  10-19  years  that  were  seronegative  for  anti-HAV  and  anti-HBs  at  screening.  The  study  report  is 
dated November 9th 1998. 
The study design was essentially the same as that for HAB-051 described above. 
  Results 
• 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of the 103 enrolled four subjects were eliminated from the analysis of reactogenicity as a study vaccine 
dose was not administered. Three subjects were eliminated from the analysis of immunogenicity. Thus, 99 
completed the study up to month 7 and 96 were assessed for immune responses.

Immunogenicity 
Hepatitis A response 
At month 1 all except one subject in each group had already seroconverted.  All subjects were seropositive 
at  month  7  at  which  time  the  anti-HAV  GMT  in  the  Ambirix  group  was  more  than  twice  that  in  the 
concomitant HAV + HBV group and the 95% CI did not overlap. The increase in anti-HAV GMTs from 
month 1 to month 7 was 89.8 % for the Ambirix group and 87.2% for Group 2.

Hepatitis B response 
At  month  1,  61.2%  in  the  Ambirix  group  and  70.2%  in  the  concomitant  HAV  +  HBV  group  had 
seroconverted and about half the vaccinees in each group were seroprotected. At month 6, seropositivity 
had increased in both groups to 79.6% and 72.3% while seroprotection rates were 51.0% and 42.6%. At 
month 7 the seroprotection rate in the Ambirix group was 91.8% compared to 95.7% in the concomitant 
HAV + HBV group, yet the GMT was approximately 2 times higher in the Ambirix group. The increase in 
GMTs from month 1 to month 7 was 96.4% in the Ambirix group and 95.0% in the concomitant HAV + 
HBV group. 
The results of the total population immunogenicity analysis were consistent with those obtained from the 
analysis performed according to protocol. 
• 
Safety  
Solicited or unsolicited signs and symptoms occurring within the 4-day follow-up period after vaccination  
were  reported  following  22.0%  of  Ambirix  doses  and  33.7%  of  doses  in  the  concomitant  HAV+HBV 
vaccine group. Most symptoms were local in both vaccine groups.

After  dose  1  and  dose  2,  the  concomitant  HAV+HBV  vaccine  group  had  a  higher  incidence  of  local 
symptoms. After all doses, soreness at the injection site was the most frequently reported solicited local 
symptom (17% of Ambirix doses, 8.2% of Havrix and 27.6% of Engerix doses). One subject had a local 
injection  site  symptom  of soreness  that  was  of  grade  3,  which occurred  at both  the  Havrix  and  Engerix 
sites following the first dose. 
Headache  and  fatigue  were  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  symptoms.  The  investigator 
considered these general symptoms to be related or possibly related to the candidate vaccine in all cases 
reported. There were no incidences of malaise, nausea or vomiting following any of the doses. 
After  dose  2,  one  subject  from  group  2  reported  fatigue  that  was  scored  as  grade  3  and  considered  as 
related or possibly related to vaccination.  
The duration of most solicited symptoms was one to two days and all resolved within the four day follow-
up period. 
No unsolicited symptoms were reported in this study during the 30-day follow-up period. No SAEs were 
reported and no subjects from either group were reported to have received concomitant medications.

HAB-053 
Study  053  was  conducted  in  1997-1998  at  four  centres  –  two  in  Brazil,  one  in  Mexico  and  one  in 
Argentina. The study report is dated December 1999 but with an amendment made in June 2000 to correct 
the injection sites (right and left arms for Havrix and Engerix injections had been interposed) and to add 
that centres 1 and 2 (in Brazil) had been audited.  
This  study  was  essentially  of  the  same  design  as  051  and  052  described  above.  However,  2:1 
randomisation  was  used  for  Ambirix  versus  Havrix  +  Engerix  and  the  study  intended  to  enrol  subjects 
from 5-18 years (the actual enrolment was from 4-20 years). Also, the final blood draw was at 6 weeks 
after the second dose rather than at Month 7 (although the tables still refer to Month 7). 
All laboratory assays at the preliminary visit were done at the investigators’ laboratories. RIA was used to 
test  for  HBsAg  (Austria  II  –  Abbott)  and  anti-HBc  (Corab-Abbott).  Anti-HAV  was  tested  by  Enzymun 
(Boerhinger Mannheim) and anti-HBs using the RIA of Ausab-Abbott. ALT and AST were measured with 
a Merck kit or a Beckman Instruments analyzer. 
Samples  obtained  at  the  post-vaccination  visits  were  assayed  in  the  MAH’s  laboratories  using  a 
Boerhinger Mannheim commercial kit for anti-HAV and the Ausab-Abbott kit for anti-HBs. 
  Results 
• 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of the 248 subjects that received at least one dose of assigned vaccine 19 failed to complete the study due 
to drop-out. Subject disposition was as shown below. 
As shown below, the majority of subjects received both doses.

Immunogenicity 
Hepatitis A response 
After  the  second  doses  of assigned  vaccines  all  subjects in  group  1  and all  except  one in  group  2  were 
seropositive. The anti-HAV GMT for group 1 was significantly higher than that for group 2 (the 95% CI 
do not overlap). The results were comparable in all countries. 
The second table below shows that in the age group of 4-11 years all subjects were seropositive after the 
second doses and the difference in GMTs was even more marked. 
The third table shows the results for those aged 12-20 years, which were similar to the overall results.

At 2 months after the first dose > 80% had seroconverted and around half were seroprotected. After the 
second assigned  doses  all subjects  had  seroconverted  and  almost  all  were  seroprotected. The  GMT  was 
higher  in  group  1  but  the  95%  CI  overlapped  for  the  entire  study  population  results.  The  results  were 
comparable in all countries. 
The results in the age group 4-11 years were comparable to those for the entire study population although 
a slightly higher proportion was seroprotected after only one dose of assigned vaccine. 
Results were also comparable in the age group of 12-20 years with a smaller difference in GMTs after the 
second doses.

Safety 
Group  2  reported  a  higher  number  of  total  and  local  symptoms  (solicited/unsolicited  during  the  4-day 
follow-up period) than group 1 but the incidence of general symptoms (solicited/unsolicited) in the 4-day 
follow-up period was similar in the two groups. There was a decrease in incidence of local and general 
symptoms (solicited/unsolicited) with subsequent doses in both groups. 
Soreness at injection site was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom in both groups. Only 2 
solicited local symptoms of intensity grade 3 were reported. These two were cases of soreness at injection 
site  reported  by  subjects  in  group  1.  All  solicited  local  symptoms  occurred  within  two  days  of  vaccine 
administration and all resolved within the 4-day follow-up

Headache was the most frequently reported solicited general symptom in both groups and more than 50% 
of  the reported  cases  (17/30  in  group  1  and  7/13 in  group  2)  were  determined  by  the  investigator  to  be 
related/possibly related to the study vaccine(s).  
Only 2 solicited general symptoms of intensity grade 3 were reported (both in group 1). These concerned 
cases  of  fatigue  and  malaise  following  vaccine  dose  2.  The  majority  of  solicited  general  symptoms

reported occurred within two days of vaccine administration and all resolved within the 4-day follow-up 
period. 
Overall 19 subjects (9 in group 1 and 10 in group 2) reported 24 unsolicited symptoms during the 30-day 
follow-up period after the vaccination. Also, 24 doses (12 per group) were followed by at least one report 
of unsolicited symptoms and 7 doses (3 in group 1, 4 in group 2) were followed by at least one unsolicited 
symptom determined by the investigator to be related/possibly related to the vaccination. No unsolicited 
symptoms of intensity grade 3 were reported. All the unsolicited symptoms reported resolved within the 
30-day follow-up period after the vaccination. 
There were 18 subjects (11 in group 1 and 7 in group 2) who received concomitant medication during the 
study period but no medication was given prophylactically in anticipation of reaction to vaccination. 
One  pregnancy  was  reported  to  occur  at  5  months  after  the  first  dose  of  vaccination.  This resulted  in a 
healthy  child  and  no  complications  occurred  either  during  pregnancy  or  during  delivery.  The  study 
vaccination was discontinued. 
One subject reported a SAE of fever and urticaria with onset 10 days after the first dose of vaccination. A 
diagnosis  of  allergic  reaction  was  made  but  the  investigator  determined  that  the  event  was  unrelated  to 
study vaccination. This subject received the second dose of the vaccine and there were no SAEs following 
the second dose.

HAB-164 = Ext of original study HAB-038 to Year 10  
The first volunteer was enrolled in the primary study on 8 July 1994 and the last study visit in the primary 
study  was  28  March  1995.  The  long-term  follow-up  visits  at  Month  120  were  conducted  between  20 
September 2004 and 18 October 2004. The study completion date was 6 May 2005. The study report is 
dated February 2006. 
The original clinical study protocol 208127/044 (HAB-038) was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity 
and  reactogenicity  of  two  lots  of  Twinrix  Paediatric  (360/10)  when  administered  according  to  a  0,  1,  6 
month schedule to healthy children between 6 and 15 years of age. 
The  original  study  protocol  was  amended  three times  to  extend  the  serological follow  up  to  60,  90  and 
then 120 months. 
Results  from  the  primary  study  had  shown  an  anti-HAV  seropositivity  rate  of  100%  and  anti-HBs 
seroprotection  rate  of  100%  at  Month  7.  Data  obtained  up  to  Month  90  had  shown  an  anti-HAV 
seropositivity rate of 100% and an anti-HBs seroprotection rate of 92.9% (for pooled groups). 
• 
Objectives 
The objectives of the long-term follow-up study were: 
- 
To  evaluate  anti-HAV  and  anti-HBs  antibody  persistence  at  Month  120  (i.e.  Year  10)  after  the 
first dose of the primary series. 
To evaluate immune memory in subjects who became seronegative for anti-HAV (< 15 mIU/ml) 
or  had  anti-HBs  antibody  <  10  mIU/ml  at  Month  120  by  administration  of  a  single  dose  of 
Twinrix Adult between 6 to 12 months after the Month 120 visit. 
- 
• 
Study design 
See the table below. 
The primary study was a double-blind, randomised (to one of two vaccine lots), single centre study. 
The long-term follow-up at Month 120 was an open study with the same group allocation as in the primary 
study i.e. 
− Group 1: had received vaccine lot HAB101C2 in the primary study 
− Group 2: had received vaccine lot HAB102B2 in the primary study 
• 
Study population  and treatment 
At Month 120 the single subject who had anti-HBs antibody concentrations < 10 mIU/ml was offered and 
accepted a dose of Twinrix Adult and was followed up for safety.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Up to Month 60, anti-HBs antibody concentrations were measured by Radioimmunoassay (AUSAB RIA -
Abbott)  with  an  assay  cut-off  of  1  mIU/ml  and  anti-  HAV  antibody  concentrations  were  measured  by 
ELISA [Enzymun (Boehringer Mannheim)] with an assay cut-off of 33 mIU/ml.  
At Months 90 and 120 anti-HAV antibody was assayed using Enzygnost from Dade Behring with an assay 
cut-off of 15 mIU/ml and anti-HBs using AUSAB EIA from Abbott Laboratories with an assay cut-off at 
3.3  mIU/ml.  For  bridging  purposes  the  Month  60  samples  were  re-tested  with  the  new  EIA  assay  kits. 
Subjects with antibody concentrations above the assay cut-offs were considered seropositive.

The  immunogenicity  analysis  was  performed  on  the  long-term  total  cohort  and  the  long-term  ATP 
immunogenicity cohort (= primary analysis).  
  Results 
• 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Study 038 initially enrolled 120 subjects (60 subjects per group) of which 26 (14 in Group 1 and 12 in 
Group 2) came back for the long-term follow-up at Month 120 (Year 10).

Immunogenicity 
At Month 120 on pooling groups all subjects who returned were still seropositive for anti-HAV with only 
a small decrease in the GMC since Month 90. 
In  addition,  as  shown  below,  all  subjects  who  returned  were  seropositive  for  anti-HBs  while  21/22 
(95.5%) were seroprotected. There was a 44.4% decrease in GMC from Month 90 to Month 120. 
The single subject with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/ml at Month 120 and who received Twinrix Adult had a last 
recorded anti HBs antibody concentration of 13,553 mIU/ml.  
The  results  of  the  long-term  total  cohort  were  consistent  with  those  for  the  long-term  ATP 
immunogenicity cohort.

Safety  
In  the  retrospective  follow-up,  there  were  no  SAEs  or  pregnancies  reported  in  the  study  since  the  last 
study visit at Month 90. 
The subject who received Twinrix Adult did not report any SAEs. The subject returned the diary card and 
did not report local or general solicited/unsolicited symptoms in the pre-defined follow-up period (Day 0 
to Day 3 for solicited symptoms and Day 0 to Day 30 for unsolicited symptoms).

3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  three  studies  with  Ambirix  were  all  comparisons  against  two  doses  of  adult  strength  Havrix  and 
Engerix  co-administered  at  the  same  time  points.  The  relevance  of  these  comparisons  to  the  EU  is  low 
since the choice for immunisation of children against both HAV and HBV would lie between three doses 
of Twinrix Paediatric or two doses of Ambirix (i.e. Twinrix Adult). 
However,  all  three  studies  indicated  that  two  doses  of  Ambirix  elicited  satisfactory  immune  responses 
after the second dose. In addition, the safety profile of Ambirix appeared to be at least as good as that of 
co-administration of adult strength Havrix and Engerix. 
In the long-term follow-up of study 038 the interpretation of the 10-year data must be cautious due to the 
low numbers that returned. However, the fact that all were still seropositive for anti-HAV and all except 
one  was  seroprotected  against  HBV  in  this  population  that  had  been  aged  6-15  years  old  when  first 
vaccinated is in keeping with data from many other studies, including vaccines against HAV and/or HBV 
produced by other companies.  
The  data  do  not  raise  any  concerns  and  do  not  require  any  changes  to  the  prescribing  information  for 
Ambirix or Twinrix Paediatric. 
III.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for asparaginase (centrally authorised 
product), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
To aid traceability of rASNase batches and distinction between different ASNase and rASNase products, the 
product information should include in section 4.4 of the SmPC and relevant section of the PL a prominent 
statement that the name and batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the 
patient records.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for asparaginase (centrally authorised product) the CHMP is of 
the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing asparaginase (centrally 
authorised product) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

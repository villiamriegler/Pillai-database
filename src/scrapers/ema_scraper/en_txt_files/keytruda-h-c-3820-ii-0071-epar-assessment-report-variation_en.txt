and anti-tumour activity of pembrolizumab in paediatric participants (Measure 2 of PIP01). Additionally, 
the results of study Study PD018 / PA-0064; evaluation of expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 in 
archival paediatric tumour tissues, were submitted (Measure 1 of PIP01). 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The purpose of this submission is to fulfil the regulatory requirement to submit the results of all studies 
performed in compliance with the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan for pembrolizumab.  
The MAH presented the results (cut-off date 03-Sep-2018) of the ongoing phase 1/2 study KEYNOTE-051 
of pembrolizumab in paediatric patients aged 6 months-18 years with advanced melanoma or a PD-L1 
positive advanced, relapsed or refractory solid tumor or lymphoma. Overall, 154 paediatric patients were 
treated  with  pembrolizumab  2  mg  Q3W,  which  has  been  established  as  the  recommended  paediatric 
dosage. Observed PK concentrations in paediatric patients administered with 2 mg/kg Q3W were within 
the range of predicted concentration for adults administered with the same dose with 2 mg/kg Q3W. 
Based on KEYNOTE-051 results, antitumor activity was minimal in patients with PD-L1 positive paediatric 
solid tumours and other lymphomas. ORR in the 136 patients with solid tumour and other lymphoma was 
only 5.9%, and enrolment was stopped for most solid tumours. Moreover, no PD-L1 negative cohorts 
were enrolled as per futility rules; therefore, analysis of association of PD-L1 status with response was not 
warranted.  
A 50% ORR was on the contrary observed among patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, for which the MAH 
is planning a future extension of indication. The cohort of HL is still open. Moreover, the MAH informed 
that data on MSI-h population will be reported separately.  
No  new  safety  signals  emerged.  Based  on  comparative  safety  tables  of  paediatric  (KN-051)  vs  adult 
patients  (RSD),  the  safety  of  paediatric  patients  appeared  generally  similar  to  that  seen  in  adults 
according to available data. SmPC has been re-worded by the MAH accordingly. No paediatric therapeutic 
indication  is  proposed  at  this  stage,  but  only  SmPC  has  been  updated  to  reflect  the  results  of  study 
KEYNOTE-051. 
The changes to the SmPC are acceptable. 
The benefit-risk balance of Keytruda remains positive.

Scope 
Please refer to the Recommendations section above  
Summary 
In KEYNOTE-051, 154 paediatric patients were administered pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. 
Pembrolizumab concentrations in these patients were comparable to those of adults at the same dose. 
Participants were enrolled across 28 tumour types by primary diagnosis. The most common tumour types 
by histology were Hodgkin lymphoma (11.7%), glioblastoma multiforme (9.1%), neuroblastoma (6.5%), 
osteosarcoma (6.5%) and melanoma (5.2%). In patients with solid tumours and other lymphomas, the 
ORR was 5.9%, no patient had a complete response and 8 patients (5.9%) had a partial response. In the 
Hodgkin lymphoma population, the ORR was 50.0%, 2 patients (11.1%) had a complete response and 7 
patients (38.9%) had a partial response. The safety profile in these paediatric patients was generally 
similar to that seen in adults treated with pembrolizumab. The most common adverse reactions (reported 
in at least 20% of paediatric patients) were pyrexia (31%), vomiting (26%), headache (22%), abdominal 
pain (21%), anaemia (21%) and constipation (20%).

5.  Introduction 
The purpose of this submission is to fulfil the regulatory requirement to submit the results of all studies 
performed  in  compliance  with  the  agreed  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  for  pembrolizumab 
(EMEA-001474-PIP01-13-M01  for  treatment  of  all  conditions  included  in  the  category  of  malignant 
neoplasms [except nervous system, haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue]) by the time of the submission 
of the next indication for KEYTRUDA following the PIP completion due date (31 January 2019), as per 
Article 8 of the Paediatric Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. 
This submission is not intended to fulfill Article 46 requirement since KN-051 is not fully completed (some 
cohorts including the HL cohort still open). 
The results of the following studies have been provided: 
- Study PD018 / PA-0064 - Evaluation of expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 in archival paediatric 
tumor tissues (Measure 1 of PIP01) 
-  KEYNOTE-051  -  ongoing,  two-part  Phase  I/II,  nonrandomized,  open-label,  single-arm,  study  to 
evaluate  the  PK,  pharmacodynamics,  toxicity,  safety,  and  anti-tumour  activity  of  pembrolizumab  in 
paediatric participants aged 6 months to <18 years of age with advanced melanoma; advanced, relapsed 
or refractory PD-L1 positive malignant solid tumours or other lymphoma; Hodgkin Lymphoma (3 to <18 
years of age); or advanced, relapsed or refractory MSI-H solid tumours (Measure 2 of PIP01). 
The MAH is requesting to update the PI (sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2) of Keytruda with paediatric data 
from the study KEYNOTE-051. No pediatric therapeutic indication is proposed at this stage.   
6.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The Objective of PK report 052DCX was to evaluate serum concentrations of pembrolizumab in pediatric 
patients with an advanced solid tumor or lymphoma following administration of multiple I.V. doses of 2 
mg/kg Q3W in KN051 (KEYNOTE-051). KEYNOTE-051 is an ongoing, 2-part Phase 1/2, nonrandomized, 
open-label,  single-arm,  study  to  evaluate  the  PK,  pharmacodynamics,  toxicity,  safety,  and  antitumor 
activity of pembrolizumab in pediatric participants aged 6 months to <18 years of age with advanced 
melanoma; advanced, relapsed or refractory PD-L1 positive malignant solid tumors or other lymphoma; 
HL  (3  to  <18  years  of  age);  or  advanced,  relapsed  or  refractory  MSI-H  solid  tumors.  The  starting 
pembrolizumab dose and frequency was 2 mg/kg Q3W. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424195/2019  
Page 7/59 
 
 
 
In total, there were 151 participants with evaluable PK samples.  
PK samples in KN051 were scheduled as follow: Predose pembrolizumab serum concentrations (Ctrough) 
were  obtained  within  24  hours  prior  to  dosing  at  Cycles  1,  2,  4,  8  and  every  4  cycles  (12  weeks) 
thereafter. Postdose serum concentrations (Cmax) were drawn within approximately 30 minutes after the 
end of the infusion in Cycle 1 and Cycle 8. Additional PK samples were drawn in Cycle 1 between 72 to 168 
hours (4-8 days) postdose and at 264 to 408 hours (12-18 days) postdose. 
Phoenix™ WinNonlin® (Version 6.3.0.395) software was used for pharmacokinetic analysis. 
Immunogenicity Analysis 
An immunogenicity evaluation has been performed using data from study KN051. The objective of the 
immunogenicity report 052J8M was: 1) to evaluate the immunogenicity incidence in children treated with 
2  mg/kg  Q3W  pembrolizumab  (MK-3475)  in  study  KN051,  which  is  a  Phase  I/II  clinical  trial  of 
pembrolizumab  in  children  and  2)  to  compare  the  immunogenicity  incidence  after  pembrolizumab 
therapy in children with the immunogenicity incidence after pembrolizumab therapy in adults.  
6.1.  Results 
Pharmacokinetics 
Summary statistics of the observed pembrolizumab trough (pre-dose) and post-dose concentrations i  
pediatric subjects from KN051 are presented in the table below:

The  observed  and  predicted  pembrolizumab  concentration-time  profiles  following  200  mg  Q3W 
administration at postdose cycle 1 and and at steady state (at and after cycle 8) are illustrated in the 
following figure: 
Immunogenicity 
The table below presents an overview of the immunogenicity status of all assessable subjects. 
To  evaluate  immunogenicity,  the  overall  immunogenicity  was  defined  as  the  proportion  of  emergent 
positive subjects to the total number of evaluable subjects (treatment emergent positive, non-treatment 
emergent positive and negative immunogenicity status). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424195/2019  
Page 10/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Out of the 133 subjects included in the immunogenicity assessment, 125 subjects were evaluable. The 
evaluable subject group contains 2 subjects with non-treatment emergent positive status (1.6%), and 
123 with negative immunogenicity status (98.4%). There were no subjects with a treatment emergent 
positive status observed. 
Impact of ADA on Pembrolizumab Exposure 
The effect of ADA on pembrolizumab levels, for the subjects with ADA positive samples, is compared with 
the subjects treated with the same regimen that only have ADA negative samples. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424195/2019  
Page 11/59 
 
 
 
 
 
For all of the ADA positive subjects, the pembrolizumab exposure was similar to that for other subjects 
treated with the same regimen. 
6.1.  Discussion 
The purpose of this submission is to fulfil the regulatory requirement to submit the results of all studies 
performed  in  compliance  with  the  agreed  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  for  pembrolizumab  and  no 
pediatric therapeutic indication is proposed at this stage while SmPC section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 have been 
updated to reflect the results of  study KEYNOTE-051.  
A  substantial  characterization  of  the  key  clinical  pharmacology  and  immunogenicity  findings  of 
pembrolizumab as monotherapy in adults has been provided in previous submissions.  
Based  on  the  existing  robust  characterization  of  pembrolizumab  PK,  a  comparison  was  conducted 
between the observed PK of pembrolizumab in children from study KEYNOTE-051 and the predictions 
from the reference PK model developed with pembrolizumab monotherapy data (KEYNOTE-001, -002, 
-006, -010, and -024).  
Observed PK concentrations in pediatric patients administered with 2 mg/kg Q3W were within the range 
of predicted concentration for adults administered with the same dose with 2 mg/kg Q3W.

a   Melanoma cohorts from 6 months to <12 years were closed starting with Amendment 8 of the study protocol 
[16.1.1]. 
b   Participants with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) were initially enrolled into the “other lymphoma” cohort. 
Beginning with Amendment 7, participants with HL were enrolled in the dedicated rrcHL Cohort. 
c   For solid tumors or other lymphoma, enrollment of participants with PD-L1 negative tumors may have been 
initiated only if participants with PD-L1 positive tumors demonstrated efficacy (see Section 8.1.2.2.2 and 
Table 14 of the study protocol [16.1.1]). 
d   Included documented biallelic mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency (constitutional mismatch repair deficiency 
[CMMRD] or biallelic mismatch repair deficiency [BMMRD]) regardless of MSI-H testing.

Source:  Study protocol [16.1.1]. 
Although this study’s primary efficacy goals were to evaluate antitumor activity in PD-L1 positive tumors, 
preliminary exploration of antitumor activity was also to be conducted in a subset of PD-L1 negative solid 
tumors  and  other  lymphomas  based  upon  response  observed  in  PD-L1  positive  tumors  in  this  study. 
Melanoma, MSI-H solid tumor, and rrcHL Cohort participants were evaluated regardless of PD-L1 status. 
As of Amendment 08, per futility rules, signals of efficacy were not met in solid tumor target cohorts, 
hence enrollment was stopped for most solid tumors. The melanoma, rrcHL, and MSI-H tumor cohorts 
continue to enroll participants regardless of PD-L1  status. Enrollment to the melanoma cohort will be 
limited to adolescent participants (≥12 and ≤18 years old). 
Methodology: 
Part I: Phase 1 safety, PK, pharmacodynamic, and dose-finding and confirmation evaluation in pediatric 
participants. Part I utilized a modified 3+3 design (dose-finding) and dose confirmation design according 
to a modified Toxicity Probability Interval approach.  
Part  II  (ongoing):  Phase  2  safety  and  efficacy  evaluation  in  pediatric  participants  with  advanced 
melanoma; PD-L1 positive advanced relapsed or refractory solid tumors or other lymphoma; rrcHL, or 
advanced, relapsed or refractory microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) solid tumors. 
The  primary  efficacy  and  safety  population  was  the  All  Subjects  as  Treated  (ASaT)  population,  which 
includes all participants who received at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab.

7.2.  Results 
Patient disposition:  A total of up to 310 participants was planned to be enrolled. As of the data cutoff 
date for this report, 155 participants were enrolled and 154 received at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab. 
Two participants completed maximum treatment duration (35 cycles, approximately 2 years), while 22 
(14.3%)  were  still  continuing  on  study  treatment.  Of  the  132  (85.7%)  participants  who  discontinued 
study treatment, the majority discontinued due to progressive disease (93) or clinical progression (19). 
Baseline  characteristics: Median age was 13 years (range 1 to 17 years). The majority were white, 
non-Hispanic (79.9%), and had Stage IV cancer (about 60%), and received prior treatment (89%).  
Participants were enrolled across 28 tumor types by primary diagnosis. The most common tumor types by 
histology  were  HL  (11.7%),  glioblastoma  multiforme  (9.1%),  neuroblastoma  (6.5%),  and  melanoma 
(5.2%). A total of 29 patients (18.8%) have solid tumor nos, and 12 (7.8%) soft tissue neoplasm nos.

 # Overall Staging not required for diagnoses lacking standard staging systems. 
 * Those subjects who are naïve, or who received only adjuvant or neoadjuvant prior therapies are 
categorized as 0. (Data Cutoff Date: 03SEP2018). 
Dose  Limiting  Toxicities (part 1): the starting pembrolizumab dose and frequency of 2 mg/kg Q3W 
was maintained throughout the trial. There were no DLTs observed in the 12 participants in Part I of 
the study. Thus the pembrolizumab  2  mg/kg  Q3W dosing regimen was not changed and has been 
established as the recommended pediatric dosage. 
Efficacy  results:  Efficacy analyses were based on the ASaT population. Of the 154 participants in the 
ASaT population, 134 were enrolled with solid tumors, 18 with HL, and 2 with other lymphomas. 
•  Solid Tumors and Other Lymphomas (n=134+2) 
The  ORR  per  RECIST  1.1  by  investigator  assessment  in  the  solid  tumor  and  other  lymphoma 
population was 5.9%. The 8 confirmed responders (all PR) had the following tumor types (by histology):  
adenocarcinoma  and  mesothelioma  (2  participants  each),  and  malignant  ganglioglioma,  epithelioid 
sarcoma, lymphoepithelial carcinoma, and malignant rhabdoid tumor (1 participant each).

 (Data Cutoff Date: 03SEP2018). 
For the 8 responders in the solid tumor and other lymphoma population, the median time to response 
was 1.9 months. Median DOR had not been reached at the time of data cutoff; responses ranged from 
2.8+ to 23.2+ months. Per the KM estimate, 100% of responders had a response duration of at least 6 
months and 83.3% had a response durations of at least 9 months.

For the 9 responders in the HL population, the median time to response was 1.9 months. Median DOR 
was 17.3 months (although the median could vary due to the small number of responders around that 
time, and the single event at the end of the curve); responses ranged from 3.9+ to 17.5 months. Per the 
KM estimate, all responders had a response duration of at least 6 months and 83.3% had a response 
durations of at least 9 months.

§ From product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. 
(Data Cutoff Date: 03SEP2018). 
No death events occurred in the Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma group. Therefore, the median 
OS of the HL population had not been reached. OS rates at 6 and 12 months were both 100.0% by KM 
estimation. 
Biomarker  Evaluations:  Few  hotspot  mutations  were  observed  in  solid  tumor  samples  from 
participants in this study, therefore no correlative testing was performed. 
PD-L1  Expression  Level  and  Clinical  Response:  Initially,  only  participants  with  PD-L1  positive 
tumors could be enrolled in this study, with the exception of the melanoma cohort. Because no tumor 
cohort met the tumor response threshold defined by the futility rules in the study protocol, no PD-L1 
negative  cohorts  were  allowed  to  be  enrolled.  However,  5  of  the  8  participants  with  melanoma  who 
enrolled had PD-L1 negative tumors. Given that  no responses were observed in the entire melanoma 
cohort, analysis of association of PD-L1 status with response was not warranted. 
7.3.  Discussion-efficacy 
Within this variation, the MAH presented the results (cutoff date 03-Sep-2018) of the ongoing phase 1/2 
study  KEYNOTE-051  of  pembrolizumab  in  paediatric  patients  aged  6  months-18  years  with  advanced 
melanoma or a PD-L1 positive advanced, relapsed or refractory solid tumor or lymphoma. The number of 
study  participants  as  per  PIP01  was  met,  and  all  binding  elements  followed,  the  PIP  was  considered 
fulfilled  (PIP  compliance  check  EMEA-C-001474-PIP01-13-  M01  started  on  3  January  2019)  (no  new 
documents regarding PIP have been included in the submission). A separate specific HL cohort has not yet 
completed the accrual and will be presented separately. Additionally, it is reported that the participants in 
the MSI-H Cohort will also be analyzed in a separate report. 
Overall, 154 paediatric patients were treated in KEYNOTE-051 study. Median age was 13 years (3 patients 
were  6  months-2  years  aged).  The  most  common  tumor  types  by  histology were  Hodgkin  lymphoma 
(11.7%), glioblastoma multiforme (9.1%), soft tissue neoplasm NOS (7.8%),  neuroblastoma (6.5%), 
osteosarcoma  (6.5%)  and  melanoma  (5.2%),  although  it  is  noted  high  frequency  of  not  otherwise 
specified solid tumor (18.8%). Most tumors were stage III and IV.  
Part I of this study had rate of DLTs as primary endpoint. The starting dose was pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg 
Q3W. As no DLTs were observed in the 12 participants of part I, pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W dosing 
regimen was not changed and has been established as the recommended pediatric dosage. 
Of the 154 participants, 134 were enrolled with solid tumours, 18 with Hodgkin lymphoma, and 2 with 
other lymphomas.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424195/2019  
Page 20/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The ORR in participants with solid tumors and other lymphomas was 5.9% (95%CI 2.6, 11.3), with the 
responders split across multiple tumor histologies. Median time to response was 1.9 months, median DOR 
was not reached, median PFS was 1.9 months and median OS 9 months.  
Per futility rules, signals of efficacy were not met in solid tumor target cohorts, hence enrollment was 
stopped  for  most  solid  tumors.  The  melanoma,  rrcHL,  and  MSI-H  tumor  cohorts  continue  to  enroll 
participants regardless of PD-L1 status. Enrollment to the melanoma cohort was limited to adolescent 
participants (≥12 and ≤18 years old). Based on KEYNOTE-051 results, antitumor activity was minimal in 
patients with PD-L1 positive pediatric solid tumors and other lymphomas. 
In contrast, the ORR in the Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin lymphoma population (n=18) was 50% (95%CI 
26.0, 74.0). Median time to response was 1.9 months, median DOR was 17.3 months and median PFS 
12.2  months.  No  deaths  event  occurred.  The  Applicant  is  considering  submitting  an  indication  for 
paediatric patients with Hodgkin lymphoma as part of a future adult filing.  
No paediatric therapeutic indication is proposed with this variation, but only an update of the SmPC to 
reflect the results of KEYNOTE-051 to date is requested. This is accepted.   
Analysis  on  PD-L1  status  was  not  performed.  Indeed,  initially,  only  participants  with  PD-L1  positive 
tumors could be enrolled in this study, with the exception of the melanoma cohort. Because no tumor 
cohort met the tumor response threshold defined by the futility rules in the study protocol, no PD-L1 
negative  cohorts  were  allowed  to  be  enrolled.  However,  5  of  the  8  participants  with  melanoma  who 
enrolled had PD-L1 negative tumors. Given that  no responses were observed in the entire melanoma 
cohort, analysis of association of PD-L1 status with response was not warranted. This is acknowledged.  
8.  Clinical Safety aspects 
8.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
KEYNOTE-051 comprised 154 pediatric participants (aged 6 months-17 years) who received at least 1 
dose  of  study  intervention  (ASaT  population)  as  of  the  data  cutoff  of  03-SEP-2018,  constituting  the 
primary safety analysis population.  
8.2.  Results 
Exposure: The mean number of pembrolizumab administrations in the solid tumor and other lymphoma 
population was 6.1, with a median duration of exposure of 43 days (range: 1 to 720 days).  
Participants with HL experienced a higher response rate, and therefore received more study treatment, 
than other patients. In the HL population, the mean number of administrations was 14.4, with a median 
duration of exposure of 212 days (range: 1 to 712 days). At the data cut-off date, 10 out of 18 subjects 
with HL were still on treatment.  
Exposure by duration is presented below:

Two participants experienced 3 drug-related Grade 5 AEs: 1 participant had Grade 5 pulmonary edema, 
and 1 participant had Grade 5 pleural effusion and Grade 5 pneumonitis. 
Deaths:  
Six participants had 1 or more AEs that resulted in death. Two of these deaths were reported by the 
investigator to be related to study drug: 1 participant had pulmonary edema and another experienced 
pneumonitis and pleural effusion. According to the MAH, for the participant experiencing the fatal event 
of  pulmonary  edema,  the  event  was  confounded  by  concomitant  sepsis,  and  for  the  participant 
experiencing  the  fatal  events  of  pneumonitis/pleural  effusion,  the  outcome  of  these  events  was 
confounded by the extensive right chest involvement of the underlying epithelioid sarcoma.

Assessor’s comment 
Based on the narrative provided, one subject with solid tumor NOS (colloid carcinoma), received a total 
of 18 doses, however pembrolizumab was interrupted in response to worsening of anemia (Grade 3) and 
gastric ulcer (Grade 3), with approximately 6 weeks between Cycles 14 and 15; then discontinued in 
response to gastric adenocarcinoma (Grade 5). The investigator considered gastric ulcer related to study 
treatment (drug-related SAE), and it is reported that a biopsy on day 299 indicated a chronic gastritis with 
inflammatory infiltration with lymphoplasmacytoid cells. No corticosteroids were administered.  
One subject with renal medullary carcinoma, who received one dose of pembrolizumab, died for a grade 
5 pulmonary edema, considered by investigator related to study medication and immune related. The 
evaluation of the MAH that the event was confounded by sepsis is acknowledged, nevertheless a relation 
of the AE with study drug cannot be excluded.  
One subject with sarcoma developed pneumonitis after one cycle of pembrolizumab, which was 
considered immune-related by investigator and classified as AEOSI by the MAH. Pneumonitis, including 
fatal events, is a known ADR of pembrolizumab.

Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation and Treatment Interruption 
As of the data cutoff date, a total of 7 participants (4.5%) had an AE that resulted in treatment 
discontinuation. AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were adenocarcinoma gastric, aspartate 
aminotransferase increased, blood creatinine increased, hypertension, pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, 
and sepsis in 1 participant each (0.6%). Of the 7 participants who discontinued study treatment due to an 
AE, 4 participants had AEs reported as drug related by the investigator (aspartate aminotransferase 
increased, hypertension, pneumonitis, pulmonary edema). 
As of the data cutoff date, a total of 18 participants (11.7%) experienced at least 1 AE leading to 
interruption of study drug. The most frequently reported AE that led to interruption of study drug was 
alanine aminotransferase increased, experienced by 3 participants (1.9%). Of the 18 participants with 
treatment interruptions due to an AE, 8 participants (5.2%) had AEs considered to be drug-related per 
investigator assessment. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI) 
Twenty-eight participants (18.2%) experienced at least 1 AEOSI, most commonly involving the thyroid:  
hypothyroidism (8.4%), hyperthyroidism (3.9%), and thyroiditis (1.3%). Of 28 participants with AEOSI, 
19 had AEOSI reported as drug related by the investigator and 3 had AEOSI reported as Grade 3, 4, or 5 
(1 each of Grade 3 pruritus, Grade 3 colitis, and Grade 5 pneumonitis), all of which were reported as drug 
related. For 2 participants AEOSI (pneumonitis and pruritus) were reported by the investigator as serious 
and drug related. For the case of pneumonitis, it also lead to discontinuation, and ultimately was fatal.

As of the data cutoff date, AEOSI resolved for 12 of 28 participants (42.9%), were resolving for 3 (10.7%) 
participants, and resolved with sequelae in 1 participant (3.6%). AEOSI had not resolved for 10 
participants (35.7%). All events that had not resolved as of the data cutoff date were endocrinopathies 
that require long-term hormone replacement therapy (7 events of hypothyroidism, 2 events of 
hyperthyroidism, and 1 event each of thyroiditis and adrenal insufficiency). The AEOSI outcome status 
was unknown in 1 participant (3.6%, hypothyroidism).  
The most common AEOSI reported during pembrolizumab treatment was hypothyroidism, which occurred 
in 13 of 154 (8.4%) participants in the ASaT population. The median time to onset was 48.0 days. All 
events were Grade 1 or 2, and no participant received corticosteroid treatment. Hypothyroidism resolved 
for 2 participants. As of the data cutoff date, hypothyroidism had not resolved for 7 participants, was 
resolving in 3 participants, and the status of 1 was unknown. In the 13 participants with a reported AE of 
hypothyroidism during treatment, a total of 4 (30.8%) had a prior history of radiation therapy to the 
head, craniospinal, or lung, which may have contributed to the risk of hypothyroidism.

Other Events of Special Interest  
Complications Post-allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Participants Previously Treated 
With Pembrolizumab 
As of the data cutoff date, there was 1 participant with HL who received an allogeneic SCT after treatment 
with pembrolizumab. The participant was treated with pembrolizumab for approximately 12 weeks, then 
discontinued the study. The participant continued to receive “immune checkpoint blockade” (name and 
duration unknown). Approximately 11 months after stopping pembrolizumab, the participant received an 
allogeneic SCT. Approximately 4 months after the allogeneic SCT, the participant was diagnosed with 
Grade 2 chronic GvHD. As of the data cutoff date, the participant was alive, approximately 10 months 
after the allogeneic SCT. 
Immune System Function Analysis 
Measurements of immune system function revealed the following:  
• 
Minimal changes were observed in the concentration of vaccinated antibodies at posttreatment 
Cycle 4 compared to pretreatment.

• 
The total memory B- and T-cell counts showed an upward trend from pretreatment to 
posttreatment Cycle 4. 
Taken together, according to the MAH these data indicate that treatment with pembrolizumab in pediatric 
patients does not seem to affect immunological competence in this patient population. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
The most frequently reported liver laboratory abnormalities in the ASaT population were: elevated 
alkaline phosphatase ≥1.5 × ULN (15.0%) and elevated ALT ≥3 × ULN (12.4%). No liver function 
abnormalities were consistent with potential drug-induced liver injury criteria (Hy’s Law). 
Comparison between pembrolizumab safety in adult and paediatric patients 
Upon  CHMP  request,  the  MAH  provided  the  paediatric  data  for  adverse  events  compared  with  the 
pembrolizumab EU reference safety dataset (RSD), which is an internally validated dataset that includes 
adverse event data for the adult studies KEYNOTE-001 Part B1, B2, B3, D, C, F1, F2, F3; KEYNOTE-002

8.3.  Discussion - safety 
The safety database presented included 154 participants of KEYNOTE-051 who received at least one dose 
of pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg Q3W. Data cut off for the analysis is 03-SEP-2018.  
Median number of pembrolizumab administration was 3 for the 136 patients with solid tumor and other 
lymphoma, while higher exposure was observed in the 18 subjects with HL, experiencing higher response 
rate  (median  number  of  administration  was  11,  range  1-35).  Overall,  18  patients  were  exposed  to 
pembrolizumab for ≥12 months.  
Overall, 96.8% of patients experienced one or more adverse events, most common (reported in at least 
20%  of  paediatric  patients)  being  pyrexia  (31%),  vomiting  (26%),  headache  (22%),  abdominal  pain 
(21%), anaemia (21%) and constipation (20%). AEs considered as drug-related by investigator occurred 
in 56.5% of subjects, most common being anemia and fatigue (7.8% each), lymphocyte count decreased 
and  pyrexia  (7.1%  each),  AST  increased  (5.8%).  Grade  3-5  AEs  were  44.8%  (anemia  9.1%  and 
lymphocyte count decrease 5.8% the most common), drug-related Grade 3-5 8.4% (lymphocyte count 
decrease 1.9% and anemia 1.3% the most common). AEs lead to treatment discontinuation in 4.5% of

the  patient.  The  most  frequent  laboratory  abnormalities  pertain  to  transaminases,  however  the  MAH 
stated that no liver function abnormalities were consistent with potential drug-induced liver injury criteria 
(Hy’s Law). 
SAE  occurred  in  36.4%  of  subjects,  (drug-related  SAE  9.1%),  most  common  being  pyrexia.  A  drug 
related  SAE  of  gastric  ulcer  grade  3  was  reported,  and  a  biopsy  revealed  “a  chronic  gastritis  with 
inflammatory  infiltration  with  lymphoplasmacytoid  cells.”    Inflammation  of  the  upper  gastrointestinal 
tract, with gastric ulcers and inflammatory infiltrate on gastric biopsy, have been described in literature 
in  patients  receiving  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  (see  for  example  “Inflammatory  gastrointestinal 
diseases associated with PD-1 blockade antibodies. M Collins et al Annals of Oncology, Volume 28, Issue 
11,  November  2017,  Pages  2860–2865”).  While  colitis,  including  rare  cases  of  small  intestinal 
perforation, is reported in the SmPC of Keytruda, gastritis and gastric ulcers are not included. The MAH 
has been requested to perform a revision of the cases of gastric ulcer across the whole (adult) safety 
database (including evaluation of biopsy report when available), and to evaluate whether appropriate 
wording should be included in the SmPC. The MAH provided the requested data and did not consider a 
change of the SmPC warranted. Based on the data provided, it is agreed that several cases with biopsy 
available  lack  of  sufficient  information  or  present  confounding  factors,  although  a  relation  with 
pembrolizumab  cannot  be  totally  excluded  in  most  of  them.  In  particular,  one  spontaneous  report 
described  a  case  in  which  a  gastric  biopsy  after  one  month  of  pembrolizumab  showed  lymphocytic 
gastritis, which  was  not evident from a biopsy taken before starting pembrolizumab. The issue is  not 
further  pursued  in  the  context  of  this  procedure.  Indeed,  the  signal  of  gastrointestinal  ulcer  is  under 
investigation by the PRAC, therefore a more updated and extensive evaluation of this safety issue will be 
however performed.      
Six participants had 1 or more AEs resulting in death. Investigator considered a pulmonary edema and 
pneumonitis/pleural effusion as treatment-related. For the grade 5 pulmonary edema, the evaluation of 
the MAH that the event was confounded by sepsis is acknowledged, however a relation of the AE with 
study drug cannot be excluded. The event of pneumonitis was considered immune-related by investigator 
and  classified  as  AEOSI  by  the  MAH.  Pneumonitis,  including  fatal  events,  is  a  known  ADR  of 
pembrolizumab. It has been requested to mention in the SmPC that fatal events occurred in the paediatric 
population of KEYNOTE-051. 
Twenty-eight participants (18.2%) experienced at least 1 AEOSI, most commonly involving the thyroid 
(hypothyroidism 8.4%, hyperthyroidism 3.9%, and thyroiditis 1.3%). AEOSI were grade ≥3 in 3 patients 
(1 each of Grade 3 pruritus, Grade 3 colitis, and Grade 5 pneumonitis). 
Overall, no new safety signals have been reported in KEYNOTE-051 study.  
The  MAH  concluded  in  the  SmPC  section  4.8  that  “the  safety  profile  in  these  paediatric  patients  was 
generally similar to that seen in adults treated with pembrolizumab”. Upon CHMP request, the MAH has 
provided supporting data comparing the safety of paediatric patients in KEYNOTE-051 with safety of adult 
from the Reference Safety Dataset. Based on the available data, taking into account the limited number 
of paediatric subjects (154 paediatrics vs 4,948 adults), the above statement is agreed. 
9.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, section(s) 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated to include data 
from KEYNOTE-051.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
Background 
Immune-mediated  adverse  events  associated  with  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  (ICI)  including 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424195/2019  
Page 41/59 
 
 
 
 
pembrolizumab,  a  PD-1  inhibitor,  have  been  well-described  in  the  literature  and  are  thought  to  be 
generally caused by non-specific activation of the immune system. 
Pembrolizumab  has  been  associated  with  immune-mediated  colitis  as  well  as  other  immunemediated 
organ  disorders;  the  putative  mechanism  for  gastritis  or  gastric  ulcer  associated  with  pembrolizumab 
would be immune-mediated as well. It is important to understand the differential diagnosis of gastritis 
and  gastric  ulcer  and  consider  alternative  explanations  for  an  immune-mediated  event.  A  cumulative 
review of case reports of gastritis and/or gastric ulcer is provided below. 
Gastritis can be defined as an acute or chronic inflammation of the stomach resulting in epithelial damage 
of the mucosal lining. This term should be distinguished from  “gastropathy,”  which refers to mucosal 
damage without inflammation resulting from epithelial cell chemical injury (such as with NSAIDs, alcohol 
bile reflux), vascular gastropathy primarily due to portal hypertension, or ischaemic injury, such as is 
seen with burn injuries, sepsis, hypovolemia, trauma or cocaine, or auto-immune, as is seen with celiac 
disease.  Adverse  event  reports  received  by  the  MAH  that  described  clinical  disease  consistent  with 
gastropathy rather than gastritis would not be considered immune-mediated, and unlikely attributable to 
pembrolizumab. 
The etiologies of inflammatory gastritis/gastric ulcer are primarily infectious or autoimmune. Helicobacter 
pylori (H.pylori) bacteria are the most common infectious agents and are clearly associated with peptic 
ulcer disease, both duodenal and gastric ulcer disease. It is estimated that 50 to 75% of the world adult 
population is infected with H. pylori. 
Mucosal injury is induced by cytotoxic enzymes secreted by the organisms, which also produce number of 
antigenic substances, including heat shock protein, urease, and lipopolysaccharide, all of which can be 
taken up and processed by lamina propria macrophages and activated T-cells. H.pylori can be detected by 
non-invasive serologic or stool antigen testing, however, biopsy is necessary, especially for confirmation 
for patients on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) due to antimicrobial properties of PPIs [Ref. 5.4: 057M8J]. 
Gastritis cannot be confirmed by macroscopic observation alone: mucosal erythema seen on endoscopy 
is not proof of an inflammatory process. Histologically confirmed inflammation of the gastric mucosa is 
necessary  for  confirmation  of  an  inflammatory  pathology  [Ref.  5.4:  057MZ6].  Therefore,  the  MAH 
considers case reports with description of tissue biopsy as the most relevant for review. 
Review of Case Reports 
The MAH’s review includes the clinical trial database, which included non-serious and serious events, and 
the safety database, which includes serious adverse events and nonserious adverse events of interest 
from clinical trial as well as non-interventional and spontaneous reporting sources. The evaluation of the 
clinical database was performed using the pembrolizumab ongoing aggregate safety evaluation (OASE). 
OASE is the MAH’s largest source of unblinded aggregate monotherapy clinical trial safety data. The most 
recent  dataset  contains  all  safety  data  for  subjects  who  received  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  in  an 
open-label  or  unmasked,  completed  randomized trial  for  which  there  has  been  a  database  lock  on or 
before 31-Mar-2018 (n=9118).  Comparator safety data from these trials is also included in the OASE. At 
present,  comparators  include  ipilimumab,  cetuximab  and  chemotherapy  (all  cytotoxic  treatments 
combined). 
The reporting rates for gastritis in subjects who received pembrolizumab monotherapy was similar to 
patients who received chemotherapy or ipilimumab. There were 54 reports of gastritis in pembrolizumab, 
which represents 0.6% of all AEs reported for pembrolizumab monotherapy. The reporting rates gastritis 
in  1,324  patients  exposed  to  chemotherapy  was  0.4%  (n=5),  and  0.4%  for  256  patients  exposed  to 
ipilimumab (n=1), with no events reported in the placebo (n=502) or cetuximab (n=71) arms. Similarly, 
the reporting rate of gastric ulcer for pembro monotherapy was 0.1% (n=13) compared with 0.1% in the 
Assessment report

Page 42/59 
 
 
 
chemo group (n=1). No events of gastric ulcer were reported in the placebo, ipilimumab or cetuximab 
groups. 
The MAH’s adverse event reporting and review database included cumulative reports received by the MAH 
up to a data lock point (DLP) of 9 April 2019. Using MedDRA High Level Term (HLT) categories for “Gastric 
ulcers  and  perforations”  and  “gastritis”,  143  cases  were  evaluated  including  the  following  reported 
Preferred  Terms  (PTs):  chronic  gastritis,  gastric  perforation,  gastric  ulcer,  gastric  ulcer  haemorrhage, 
gastric  ulcer  perforation,  gastritis,  gastritis  erosive,  gastritis  haemorrhagic,  haemorrhagic  erosive 
gastritis, necrotizing gastritis, reflux gastritis and ulcerative gastritis These reports described patients 
who had received at least one dose of pembrolizumab in a clinical trial, or as a marketed drug. Overall, 
most  reports  were  from  clinical  trials  (75  serious,  1  non-serious),  21  reports  were  from 
non-interventional studies (17 serious and 4 non-serious) and 46 reports were spontaneous (42 serious 
and  4  non-serious)  cases.  The  median  age  was  65.3  years,  and  most  (83)  reports  were  from  male 
subjects. The median time to onset of the event was 129 days, with a range from 3 days to 1111 days. 
Melanoma was the most common indication reported with 39 reports, followed by NSCLC (36), gastric 
and  head  and  neck  cancers  (9  each).  This  distribution  roughly  reflects  the  composition  of  the  clinical 
development  population  studied,  and  currently  labelled  indications  for  Keytruda.  Review  of  the  128 
reports without biopsy did not suggest features concerning for an association with pembrolizumab. Most 
reports did include endoscopic descriptions of erythema, but this is a non-specific finding and cannot be 
interpreted as evidence of an immune-mediated process. As noted above, histopathology is critical for 
confirming  an  inflammatory  process;  therefore,  only  reports  that  contained  biopsy  results  were 
considered  evaluable  for  a  possible  immune-mediated  etiology.  Of  the  15  reports  that  included  a 
description of histopathology of the stomach, 7 reports contained insufficient information to reasonably 
conclude a causal association with pembrolizumab. Three reports attributed the gastric event with other 
medical conditions: 2 reports described progression of metastatic disease and  one report described a 
severe  H.  pylori  infection.  Two  reports  were  confounded  by  concomitant  use  of  NSAIDs  or  cytotoxic 
chemotherapy medications. Two reports were confounded by critical illness, and one report described a 
patient who recovered without corticosteroid treatment, suggesting a non-immune process. Reports with 
biopsy results are summarized below in Table 1. Of 11 reports which described outcomes, all subjects 
recovered or were recovering at the time of the report. Four subjects continued pembrolizumab treatment 
without interruption; three of these reports included outcome, which was recovered or recovering at the 
time of the report.

Summary 
In the MAH’s cumulative review of adverse events of PTs reported under the MedDRA HLTs of gastritis and 
gastric and duodenal ulcer, the clear majority of 143 reports described gastritis or gastric ulcer based on 
endoscopy alone, without tissue biopsy. It is  not possible to  ascribe an immune-mediated etiology to 
these events. Of the 15 reports which included biopsy results, confounding factors, reasonable alternative 
explanations  (such  as  other  medications,  H.pylori  infection,  metastatic  disease  or  critical  illness),  or 
limited  information  to  rule  out  common  explanations,  including  H.pylori  and  celiac  disease  precluded 
drawing a conclusion that pembrolizumab was primarily or causally associated with the clinical events 
reported. 
The referenced article (Collins et al., 2017) is also difficult to interpret, and does not provide satisfactory 
information  to implicate pembrolizumab  in  events  of  immune-mediated  gastritis.  The  paper describes 
upper GI tract inflammation in 4 patients exposed to PD-1 inhibitor therapy, either pembrolizumab or 
nivolumab, but does not specify which treatment the 2 patients with gastric biopsy results received. None 
of the 4 cases described information regarding prior history of GI disease, or description of testing/results 
for  H.pylori  or  celiac  disease.  Though  NSAID  use  was  denied  in  all  4  patients,  other  concomitant 
medication  exposure  (including  chemotherapy  and/or  radiation  therapy)  was  not  described  except  to 
note  that  ipilimumab  was  not  concurrently  given.  The  report  lacked  convincing  evidence  that  other 
pathologic  processes  were  excluded  before  concluding  that  the  disease  process  with  lymphocytic 
infiltration of the stomach was due to pembrolizumab and could not be attributed to other causes. 
Therefore, upon review of the totality of currently available information the MAH asserts that there is 
insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that pembrolizumab is causally associated with events of 
inflammatory gastritis or gastric ulcer. Therefore, no changes to the Company Core Data Sheet, or the 
SmPC are warranted at this time. The MAH continues to closely monitor all serious adverse event reports, 
especially reports of potentially immunemediated events using a vigorous pharmacovigilance system that 
Assessment report

includes both individual case report review, literature review and quarterly aggregate analyses of data, 
and will report any confirmed safety signals to regulatory authorities as required. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
As requested, the MAH performed a revision of the cases of gastric ulcer across the whole (adult) safety 
database from all sources, following the observation during the assessment of this procedure of a SAE of 
gastric ulcer grade 3 with stomach biopsy revealing inflammatory infiltration. The MAH did not further 
discuss this case, which was however considered drug-related by investigator. 
According to this review, made using MedDRA High Level Term (HLT) categories for “Gastric ulcers and 
perforations” and “gastritis”, the reporting rate for gastritis was 0.6% (n=54) and of gastric ulcer 0.1% 
(n=13) for pembrolizumab monotherapy. A total of 143 cases were evaluated. Of those, 76 were from 
clinical  trials  (75  serious  and  1  non-serious),  21  from  non-interventional  studies  (17  serious  and  4 
non-serious) and 46 from spontaneous report (42 serious and 4 non-serious). The MAH considered as 
evaluable  for  a  possible  immune  related  aetiology  only  15  cases  which  had  biopsy  report  available. 
According  to  the  MAH’s  assessment,  7  cases  lack  sufficient  information  to  conclude  on  a  causal 
relationship  with  pembrolizumab,  2  cases  described  progressive  disease,  2  were  confounded  by 
concomitant NSAID/cytotoxic chemotherapy and 2 confounded by critical illness, 1 was associated with 
H.Pylori  infection  and  1  case  recovered  without  corticosteroids.  The  MAH  concluded  that  there  is 
insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that pembrolizumab is causally associated with events of 
inflammatory gastritis or gastric ulcer, and does not consider changes of the SmPC warranted.  
It is agreed that several cases lack of sufficient information or present confounding factors, although a 
relation with pembrolizumab cannot be excluded for most of them. The spontaneous report [case number 
redacted] describes a case of gastritis in a subject with metastatic melanoma, who performed a gastric 
biopsy after one month of pembrolizumab showing lymphocytic gastritis, which was not evident from a 
biopsy taken two months before starting pembrolizumab. IHC for H.Pylori was negative in both biopsies. 
The outcome of this event is “unknown”. The MAH stated that information on prior GI or autoimmune 
history was not provided, as well as further infectious or autoimmune diagnostic work-up. Based on the 
available  data,  this  case  is  highly  suggestive  of  a  possible  causal  relationship  of  pembrolizumab  with 
gastritis, acknowledging the lack of some information on possible concomitant alternative explanations.  
Given the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, it is considered also that there is biological plausibility 
in the possible induction of inflammatory gastritis/gastric ulcer. Further, gastritis and duodenal ulcers are 
reported as ADRs for nivolumab. 
It is noted that the signal of gastrointestinal ulcer is included in the PRAC agenda of June 2019 published 
on EMA website 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/agenda/agenda-prac-draft-agenda-meeting-11-14-june-2
019_en.pdf) 
Conclusion: issue not further pursued within this procedure.  
Signal of gastrointestinal ulcer is currently under discussion by the PRAC.

Question 2  
The MAH concluded in the SmPC that “the safety profile in these paediatric patients was generally similar 
to that seen in adults treated with pembrolizumab”, however no supporting data to appropriately 
compare the safety of paediatric to adult patients have been found. The MAH is requested to provide the 
paediatric safety in KEYNOTE-051 with (please use the safety tables reported in the AR and report side by 
side the frequencies included in the most recent RSD of pembrolizumab monotherapy in adult patients). 
If relevant higher frequencies in single items are found in the paediatric compared to adult population, 
those should be discussed and, if appropriate, reflected in the SmPC. (OC) 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH provided the requested paediatric data for adverse events compared with the pembrolizumab 
EU reference safety dataset (RSD), which is an internally validated dataset that includes adverse event 
data for the adult studies KEYNOTE-001 Part B1, B2, B3, D, C, F1, F2, F3; KEYNOTE-002 (original phase), 
KEYNOTE-006, KEYNOTE-010, KEYNOTE- 012, KEYNOTE-013 Cohort 3, KEYNOTE-024, KEYNOTE-040, 
KEYNOTE-045, KEYNOTE-052, KEYNOTE-054, KEYNOTE-055, and KEYNOTE-087. 
The overall incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events, including drug-related adverse 
events, in the KEYNOTE-051 population was similar compared with the RSD. The most frequent 
drug-related adverse events in KEYNOTE-051 were anemia, fatigue, lymphocyte count decreased and 
pyrexia, consistent with what might be anticipated in a paediatric population or with the underlying 
disease conditions (See Tables 4,5 and 8). Overall, the rates of AEs and adverse events of special interest 
(AEOSI) in tables 10 and 11 reported in KEYNOTE-051 were comparable to those observed in the adult 
population treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy represented by the RSD. No new immunemediated 
events were identified in the paediatric population.  
The Applicant is of the opinion that these data support the proposed statement in section 4.8 that ‘the 
safety profile in these paediatric patients was generally similar to that seen in adults treated with 
pembrolizumab’.

Non-serious adverse events up to 30 days of last dose and serious adverse events up to 90 days of last dose are included. MedDRA 
preferred terms "Neoplasm Progression", "Malignant Neoplasm Progression" and "Disease Progression" not related to 
the drug are excluded. 
§ Includes all subjects who received at least one dose of MK-3475 in KN001 Part B1, B2, B3, D, C, F1, F2, F3; KN002 (original 
phase), KN006, KN010, KN012 HNSCC, KN013 Cohort 3, KN024, KN040, KN045, KN052, KN054, KN055 and KN087. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided the requested comparative tables (KN-051 in paediatrics vs RSD in adults). The 
overall incidence of (all causality and drug related) AEs, G3-5 AEs, SAE and AEOSI was similar in KN-051 
compared to RSD. No new immune-mediated events have been reported in the paediatric population. 
Based  on  the  available  data,  and  taking  into  account  the  limited  number  of  paediatric  subjects  (154 
paediatrics vs 4,948 adults), the statement “the safety profile in these paediatric patients was generally 
similar to that seen in adults treated with pembrolizumab” proposed by the MAH for inclusion in section 
4.8 of the SmPC is agreed. 
Conclusion: issue solved

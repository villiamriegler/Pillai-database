SUMMARY OF POSITIVE OPINION* 
for 
RIVASTIGMINE HEXAL 
International Non-proprietary Name (INN): rivastigmine 
On  24  September  2009  the  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  adopted  a 
positive opinion∗∗, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Rivastigmine Hexal 1.5 mg, 3 mg, 4.5 mg, 6 mg hard capsules and 2 mg / ml. oral solution intended 
for  the  symptomatic  treatment  of  mild  to  moderately  severe  Alzheimer’s  dementia  and  of  mild  to 
moderately severe dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease.  
The applicant for this medicinal product is Hexal AG. 
The active substance of Rivastigmine Hexal is rivastigmine an anticholinesterases medicinal product 
(N06DA03).  
Rivastigmine Hexal is the same as Exelon, which is already authorised in the European Union. The 
company that holds Exelon has agreed that its scientific data on Exelon can be used to assess 
Rivastigmine Hexal. 
The  approved  indication  is:  “Rivastigmine  is  indicated  for  the  symptomatic  treatment  of  of  mild  to 
moderately  severe  Alzheimer’s  dementia  and  mild  to  moderately  severe  dementia  in  patients  with 
idiopathic Parkinson’s disease.” 
Detailed  recommendations  for  the  use  of  this  product  will  be  described  in  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics (SPC) which will be published in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) and 
will be available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission. 
The CHMP, on the basis of the data submitted, considers that there is a favourable benefit risk balance 
for Rivastigmine Hexal, and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation.

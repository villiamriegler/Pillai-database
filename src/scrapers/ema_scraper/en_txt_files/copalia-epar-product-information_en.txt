4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose of Copalia is one tablet per day. 
Copalia 5 mg/80 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately 
controlled with amlodipine 5 mg or valsartan 80 mg alone. 
Copalia 5 mg/160 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately 
controlled with amlodipine 5 mg or valsartan 160 mg alone. 
Copalia 10 mg/160 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately 
controlled with amlodipine 10 mg or valsartan 160 mg alone or with Copalia 5 mg/160 mg. 
Copalia can be used with or without food. 
Individual dose titration with the components (i.e. amlodipine and valsartan) is recommended before 
changing to the fixed dose combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy 
to the fixed-dose combination may be considered. 
For convenience, patients receiving valsartan and amlodipine from separate tablets/capsules may be 
switched to Copalia containing the same component doses. 
Renal impairment 
There are no available clinical data in severely renally impaired patients. No dosage adjustment is 
required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Monitoring of potassium levels and 
creatinine is advised in moderate renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Copalia is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). 
Caution should be exercised when administering Copalia to patients with hepatic impairment or biliary 
obstructive disorders (see section 4.4). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without 
cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan. Amlodipine dosage 
recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. 
When switching eligible hypertensive patients (see section 4.1) with hepatic impairment to amlodipine 
or Copalia, the lowest available dose of amlodipine monotherapy or of the amlodipine component, 
respectively, should be used. 
Elderly (age 65 years or over) 
In elderly patients, caution is required when increasing the dosage. When switching eligible elderly 
hypertensive patients (see section 4.1) to amlodipine or Copalia, the lowest available dose of 
amlodipine monotherapy or of the amlodipine component, respectively, should be used. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Copalia in children aged below 18 years have not been established. No data 
are available. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
It is recommended to take Copalia with some water.

4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the 
excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. 
Concomitant use of Copalia with aliskiren-containing products in patients with diabetes mellitus 
or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
Severe hypotension. 
Shock (including cardiogenic shock). 
Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. hypertrophic obstructive 
cardiomyopathy and high grade aortic stenosis). 
Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established. 
Pregnancy 
Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless 
continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to 
alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. 
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if 
appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). 
Sodium- and/or volume-depleted patients 
Excessive hypotension was seen in 0.4% of patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with 
Copalia in placebo-controlled studies. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system (such as 
volume- and/or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics) who are receiving angiotensin 
receptor blockers, symptomatic hypotension may occur. Correction of this condition prior to 
administration of Copalia or close medical supervision at the start of treatment is recommended. 
If hypotension occurs with Copalia, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if 
necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood 
pressure has been stabilised. 
Hyperkalaemia 
Concomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing 
potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) should be 
undertaken with caution and with frequent monitoring of potassium levels. 
Renal artery stenosis 
Copalia should be used with caution to treat hypertension in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal 
artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney since blood urea and serum creatinine may increase in 
such patients. 
Kidney transplantation 
To date there is no experience of the safe use of Copalia in patients who have had a recent kidney 
transplantation.

Hepatic impairment 
Valsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile. The half life of amlodipine is prolonged and 
AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver function; dosage recommendations have not 
been established. Particular caution should be exercised when administering Copalia to patients with 
mild to moderate hepatic impairment or biliary obstructive disorders. 
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended 
dose is 80 mg valsartan. 
Renal impairment 
No dosage adjustment of Copalia is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment 
(GFR >30 ml/min/1.73 m2). Monitoring of potassium levels and creatinine is advised in moderate 
renal impairment. 
Primary hyperaldosteronism 
Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist 
valsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is affected by the primary disease. 
Angioedema 
Angioedema, including swelling of the larynx and glottis, causing airway obstruction and/or swelling 
of the face, lips, pharynx and/or tongue, has been reported in patients treated with valsartan. Some of 
these patients previously experienced angioedema with other medicinal products, including ACE 
inhibitors. Copalia should be discontinued immediately in patients who develop angioedema and 
should not be re-administered. 
Heart failure/post-myocardial infarction 
As a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal 
function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose 
renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with 
ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or 
progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar outcomes have been 
reported with valsartan. Evaluation of patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction should 
always include assessment of renal function. 
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New 
York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine 
was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the 
incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo. 
Calcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with 
congestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. 
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis 
As with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from mitral stenosis or 
significant aortic stenosis that is not high grade.

Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
There is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren increases the risk of 
hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual 
blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren is therefore not 
recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 
If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist 
supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. 
ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy. 
Copalia has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interactions common to the combination 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with Copalia and other medicinal products. 
To be taken into account with concomitant use 
Other antihypertensive agents 
Commonly used antihypertensive agents (e.g. alpha blockers, diuretics) and other medicinal products 
which may cause hypotensive adverse effects (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, alpha blockers for 
treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia) may increase the antihypertensive effect of the combination. 
Interactions linked to amlodipine 
Concomitant use not recommended 
Grapefruit or grapefruit juice 
Administration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as bioavailability 
may be increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood pressure lowering effects. 
Caution required with concomitant use 
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Concomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole 
antifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give rise to 
significant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these pharmacokinetic 
variations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus 
be required. 
CYP3A4 inducers (anticonvulsant agents [e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, 
fosphenytoin, primidone], rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) 
Upon co-administration of known inducers of the CYP3A4, the plasma concentration of amlodipine 
may vary. Therefore, blood pressure should be monitored and dose regulation considered both during 
and after concomitant medication particularly with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, 
hypericum perforatum). 
Simvastatin 
Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% 
increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It is recommended to limit the dose 
of simvastatin to 20 mg daily in patients on amlodipine. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dantrolene (infusion) 
In animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with 
hyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of 
hyperkalaemia, it is recommended that the co-administration of calcium channel blockers such as 
amlodipine be avoided in patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of 
malignant hyperthermia. 
To be taken into account with concomitant use 
Others 
In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, digoxin, 
warfarin or ciclosporin. 
Interactions linked to valsartan 
Concomitant use not recommended 
Lithium 
Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during 
concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists, including valsartan. Therefore, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is 
recommended during concomitant use. If a diurectic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may 
presumably be increased further with Copalia. 
Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other 
substances that may increase potassium levels 
If a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is to be prescribed in combination with valsartan, 
monitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised. 
Caution required with concomitant use 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, 
acetylsalicylic acid (>3 g/day), and non-selective NSAIDs 
When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs attenuation of the 
antihypertensive effect may occur. Furthermore, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and 
NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function and an increase in serum 
potassium. Therefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment is recommended, 
as well as adequate hydration of the patient. 
Inhibitors of the uptake transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux transporter (ritonavir) 
The results of an in vitro study with human liver tissue indicate that valsartan is a substrate of the 
hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1 and of the hepatic efflux transporter MRP2. Co-administration 
of inhibitors of the uptake transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux transporter (ritonavir) may 
increase the systemic exposure to valsartan. 
Dual blockade of the RAAS with ARBs, ACE inhibitors or aliskiren 
Clinical trial data have shown that dual blockade of the RAAS through the combined use of ACE 
inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as 
hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to 
the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Others 
In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the 
following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indometacin, 
hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Amlodipine 
The safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, 
reproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only 
recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the 
mother and foetus. 
Valsartan 
The use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first 
trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and 
third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors 
during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk 
cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II 
Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued 
AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative 
antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When 
pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, 
alternative therapy should be started. 
Exposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human 
foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal 
toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). 
Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check 
of renal function and skull is recommended. 
Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see 
sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
Amlodipine is excreted in human milk . The proportion of the maternal dose received by the infant has 
been estimated with an interquartile range of 3–7%, with a maximum of 15%. The effect of 
amlodipine on infants is unknown. No information is available regarding the use of Copalia during 
breast-feeding, therefore Copalia is not recommended and alternative treatments with better 
established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or 
preterm infant. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical studies on fertility with Copalia. 
Valsartan 
Valsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses 
up to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis 
(calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). 
Amlodipine 
Reversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients 
treated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of 
amlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Patients taking Copalia and driving vehicles or using machines should take into account that dizziness 
or weariness may occasionally occur. 
Amlodipine can have mild or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients 
taking amlodipine suffer from dizziness, headache, fatigue or nausea the ability to react may be 
impaired. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of Copalia has been evaluated in five controlled clinical studies with 5,175 patients, 2,613 
of whom received valsartan in combination with amlodipine. The following adverse reactions were 
found to be the most frequently occurring or the most significant or severe: nasopharyngitis, influenza, 
hypersensitivity, headache, syncope, orthostatic hypotension, oedema, pitting oedema, facial oedema, 
oedema peripheral, fatigue, flushing, asthenia and hot flush. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very 
common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Additional information on the combination 
Peripheral oedema, a recognised side effect of amlodipine, was generally observed at a lower 
incidence in patients who received the amlodipine/valsartan combination than in those who received 
amlodipine alone. In double-blind, controlled clinical trials, the incidence of peripheral oedema by 
dose was as follows:

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
There is no experience of overdose with Copalia. The major symptom of overdose with valsartan is 
possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in excessive 
peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged systemic 
hypotension, including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. 
Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema has rarely been reported as a consequence of amlodipine 
overdose that may manifest with a delayed onset (24-48 hours post-ingestion) and require ventilatory 
support. Early resuscitative measures (including fluid overload) to maintain perfusion and cardiac 
output may be precipitating factors. 
Treatment 
If ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of 
activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine 
has been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. Clinically significant hypotension 
due to Copalia overdose calls for active cardiovascular support, including frequent monitoring of 
cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and 
urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided 
that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in 
reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. 
Both valsartan and amlodipine are unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system; angiotensin II antagonists, 
combinations; angiotensin II antagonists and calcium channel blockers, ATC code: C09DB01 
Copalia combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood 
pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class 
and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines. The combination of these substances 
has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either 
component alone. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Amlodipine/Valsartan 
The combination of amlodipine and valsartan produces dose-related additive reduction in blood 
pressure across its therapeutic dose range. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose of the 
combination persisted for 24 hours. 
Placebo-controlled trials 
Over 1,400 hypertensive patients received Copalia once daily in two placebo-controlled trials. Adults 
with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure 
95 and <110 mmHg) were enrolled. Patients with high cardiovascular risks – heart failure, type I and 
poorly controlled type II diabetes and history of myocardial infarction or stroke within one year – were 
excluded. 
Active-controlled trials in patients who were non-responders to monotherapy 
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation 
of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients 
not adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg in 75% of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan 
10 mg/160 mg and 62% of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/160 mg, compared to 53% 
of patients remaining on valsartan 160 mg. The addition of amlodipine 10 mg and 5 mg produced an 
additional reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 6.0/4.8 mmHg and 3.9/2.9 mmHg, 
respectively, compared to patients who remained on valsartan 160 mg only. 
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation 
of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients 
not adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg in 78% of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan 
10 mg/160 mg, compared to 67% of patients remaining on amlodipine 10 mg. The addition of 
valsartan 160 mg produced an additional reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 
2.9/2.1 mmHg compared to patients who remained on amlodipine 10 mg only. 
Copalia was also studied in an active-controlled study of 130 hypertensive patients with mean sitting 
diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mmHg and <120 mmHg. In this study (baseline blood pressure 
171/113 mmHg), a Copalia regimen of 5 mg/160 mg titrated to 10 mg/160 mg reduced sitting blood 
pressure by 36/29 mmHg as compared to 32/28 mmHg with a regimen of 
lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/12.5 mg titrated to 20 mg/12.5 mg. 
In two long-term follow-up studies the effect of Copalia was maintained for over one year. Abrupt 
withdrawal of Copalia has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure. 
Age, gender, race or body mass index (≥30 kg/m2, <30 kg/m2) did not influence the response to 
Copalia. 
Copalia has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. Valsartan has been 
studied in patients with post myocardial infarction and heart failure. Amlodipine has been studied in 
patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary 
artery disease. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Amlodipine 
The amlodipine component of Copalia inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac 
and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a 
direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance 
and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and 
non-dihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth 
muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through 
specific ion channels. 
Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces 
vasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood 
pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with 
chronic dosing. 
Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. 
In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a 
decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal 
plasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. 
As with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and 
during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have 
generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on 
left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been 
associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact 
animals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans. 
Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals 
or humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta 
blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic 
parameters were observed. 
Use in patients with hypertension 
A randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering 
treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer therapies: 
amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-inhibitor) as 
first-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild to moderate 
hypertension. 
A total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of 
4.9 years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: 
previous myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), high density 
lipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed 
by electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%). 
The primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial 
infarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based 
therapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95% CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among 
secondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined 
cardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the 
chlorthalidone group (10.2% versus 7.7%, RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there was 
no significant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and chlorthalidone-
based therapy RR 0.96 95% CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Valsartan 
Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively 
on the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. The 
increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may 
stimulate the unblocked receptor subtype AT2, which appears to counterbalance the effect of the AT1 
receptor. Valsartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor and has much 
(about 20,000-fold) greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. 
Valsartan does not inhibit ACE, also known as kininase II, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin 
II and degrades bradykinin. Since there is no effect on ACE and no potentiation of bradykinin or 
substance P, angiotensin II antagonists are unlikely to be associated with coughing. In clinical trials 
where valsartan was compared with an ACE inhibitor, the incidence of dry cough was significantly (p 
<0.05) lower in patients treated with valsartan than in those treated with an ACE inhibitor (2.6% 
versus 7.9%, respectively). In a clinical trial of patients with a history of dry cough during ACE 
inhibitor therapy, 19.5% of trial subjects receiving valsartan and 19.0% of those receiving a thiazide 
diuretic experienced coughing, compared to 68.5% of those treated with an ACE inhibitor (p <0.05). 
Valsartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in 
cardiovascular regulation. 
Administration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without 
affecting pulse rate. 
In most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs 
within 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4–6 hours. The antihypertensive 
effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the maximum 
reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2–4 weeks and is sustained 
during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of valsartan has not been associated with rebound 
hypertension or other adverse clinical events. 
Other: dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET [ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in 
combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial] and VA NEPHRON-D [The Veterans Affairs 
Nephropathy in Diabetes]) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE inhibitor with an 
ARB. 
ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular 
disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-
D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. 
These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and 
mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as 
compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these 
results are also relevant for other ACE inhibitors and ARBs. 
ACE inhibitors and ARBs should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic 
nephropathy (see section 4.4). 
ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) 
was a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE inhibitor 
or an ARB in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular 
disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse outcomes. 
Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than in 
the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, 
hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the 
placebo group.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Linearity 
Amlodipine and valsartan exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. 
Amlodipine/Valsartan 
Following oral administration of Copalia, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan and amlodipine are 
reached in 3 and 6–8 hours, respectively. The rate and extent of absorption of Copalia are equivalent to 
the bioavailability of valsartan and amlodipine when administered as individual tablets. 
Amlodipine 
Absorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma 
concentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6–12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as 
between 64% and 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. 
Distribution: Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have 
shown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins. 
Biotransformation: Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive 
metabolites. 
Elimination: Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of 
approximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 
7–8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine. 
Valsartan 
Absorption: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan 
are reached in 2–4 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as measured 
by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, although 
from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted groups. 
This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the 
therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. 
Distribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is 
about 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is highly 
bound to serum proteins (94–97%), mainly serum albumin. 
Biotransformation: Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is 
recovered as metabolites. A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations 
(less than 10% of the valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. 
Elimination: Valsartan shows multiexponential decay kinetics (t½α <1 h and t½ß about 9 h). Valsartan is 
primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as 
unchanged drug. Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/h 
and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Paediatric population (age below 18 years) 
No pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. 
Elderly (age 65 years or over) 
Time to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly 
patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) 
and elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the 
young therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage. 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As expected 
for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no correlation 
was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan. 
Hepatic impairment 
Very limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic 
impairment. Patients with hepatic impairment have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting 
increase of approximately 40–60% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic 
liver disease exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers 
(matched by age, sex and weight). Caution should be exercised in patients with liver disease (see 
section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Amlodipine/Valsartan 
Adverse reactions observed in animal studies with possible clinical relevance were as follows: 
Histopathological signs of inflammation of the glandular stomach was seen in male rats at an exposure 
of about 1.9 (valsartan) and 2.6 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg 
amlodipine. At higher exposures, there were ulceration and erosion of the stomach mucosa in both 
females and males. Similar changes were also seen in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5–
11.0 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan). 
An increased incidence and severity of renal tubular basophilia/hyalinisation, dilation and casts, as 
well as interstitial lymphocyte inflammation and arteriolar medial hypertrophy were found at an 
exposure of 8–13 (valsartan) and 7–8 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 
10 mg amlodipine. Similar changes were found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5–11.0 times 
the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan). 
In an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, increased incidences of dilated ureters, malformed 
sternebrae, and unossified forepaw phalanges were noticed at exposures of about 12 (valsartan) and 10 
(amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine. Dilated ureters were 
also found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 12 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan). 
There were only modest signs of maternal toxicity (moderate reduction of body weight) in this study. 
The no-observed-effect-level for developmental effects was observed at 3- (valsartan) and 4- 
(amlodipine) fold the clinical exposure (based on AUC). 
For the single compounds there was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity.

Amlodipine 
Reproductive toxicology 
Reproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of 
labour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum 
recommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. 
Impairment of fertility 
There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females 
14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human 
dose of 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine 
besilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma 
follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in 
the number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. 
Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis 
Rats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to provide 
daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. The 
highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of 
10 mg on a mg/m2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. 
Mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. 
* Based on patient weight of 50 kg 
Valsartan 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development. 
In rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to 
lower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) 
in the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the 
maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 
320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). 
In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a 
reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of 
changes in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised blood urea nitrogen, and renal tubular hyperplasia 
and basophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 
18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose 
of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). 
In marmosets at comparable doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the 
kidney where the changes developed to a nephropathy including raised blood urea nitrogen and 
creatinine. 
Hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species. All changes were 
considered to be caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which produces prolonged 
hypotension, particularly in marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, the hypertrophy 
of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not seem to have any relevance.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Copalia is and what it is used for 
Copalia tablets contain two substances called amlodipine and valsartan. Both of these substances help 
to control high blood pressure. 
− 
Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine 
stops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from 
tightening. 
Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. 
Angiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the 
blood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. 
− 
This means that both of these substances help to stop the blood vessels tightening. As a result, the 
blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. 
Copalia is used to treat high blood pressure in adults whose blood pressure is not controlled enough 
with either amlodipine or valsartan on its own. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take Copalia 
Do not take Copalia 
− 
if you are allergic to amlodipine or to any other calcium channel blockers. This may involve 
itching, reddening of the skin or difficulty in breathing. 
if you are allergic to valsartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you think you may be allergic, talk to your doctor before taking Copalia. 
if you have severe liver problems or bile problems such as biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. 
if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Copalia in early pregnancy, 
see Pregnancy section). 
if you have severe low blood pressure (hypotension). 
if you have narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis) or cardiogenic shock (a condition 
where your heart is unable to supply enough blood to the body). 
if you suffer from heart failure after a heart attack. 
if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren. 
If any of the above applies to you, do not take Copalia and talk to your doctor. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Copalia: 
− 
− 
− 
if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea). 
if you have liver or kidney problems. 
if you have had a kidney transplant or if you had been told that you have a narrowing of your 
kidney arteries. 
if you have a condition affecting the renal glands called “primary hyperaldosteronism”. 
if you have had heart failure or have experienced a heart attack. Follow your doctor’s 
instructions for the starting dose carefully. Your doctor may also check your kidney function. 
if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called “aortic 
or mitral stenosis”) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called 
“obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy”). 
if you have experienced swelling, particularly of the face and throat, while taking other 
medicines (including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). If you get these symptoms, 
stop taking Copalia and contact your doctor straight away. You should never take Copalia 
again. 
if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: 
− 
an ACE inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems. 
aliskiren.

− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. 
See also information under the heading “Do not take Copalia”. 
If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Copalia. 
Children and adolescents 
The use of Copalia in children and adolescents is not recommended (aged below 18 years old). 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Copalia 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions. In some cases 
you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed 
below: 
− 
ACE inhibitors or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take Copalia” and 
“Warnings and precautions”); 
diuretics (a type of medicine also called “water tablets” which increases the amount of urine you 
produce); 
lithium (a medicine used to treat some types of depression); 
potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and 
other substances that may increase potassium levels; 
certain types of painkillers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) or 
selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors). Your doctor may also check your 
kidney function; 
anticonvulsant agents (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone); 
St. John’s wort; 
nitroglycerin and other nitrates, or other substances called “vasodilators”; 
medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir); 
medicines used to treat fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole); 
medicines used to treat bacterial infections (such as rifampicin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, 
telithromycin); 
verapamil, diltiazem (heart medicines); 
simvastatin (a medicine used to control high cholesterol levels); 
dantrolene (infusion for severe body temperature abnormalities);

Copalia with food and drink 
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should not be consumed by people who are taking Copalia. This is 
because grapefruit and grapefruit juice can lead to an increase in the blood levels of the active 
substance amlodipine, which can cause an unpredictable increase in the blood pressure lowering effect 
of Copalia. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking Copalia before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Copalia. Copalia is not recommended 
in early pregnancy (first 3 months), and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Amlodipine has been shown 
to pass into breast milk in small amounts. Copalia is not recommended for mothers who are breast-
feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if 
your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
This medicine may make you feel dizzy. This can affect how well you can concentrate. So, if you are 
not sure how this medicine will affect you, do not drive, use machinery, or do other activities that you 
need to concentrate on.

3. 
How to take Copalia 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. This will help you get the best results and lower the risk of side effects. 
The usual dose of Copalia is one tablet per day. 
− 
− 
− 
It is preferable to take your medicine at the same time each day. 
Swallow the tablets with a glass of water. 
You can take Copalia with or without food. Do not take Copalia with grapefruit or grapefruit 
juice. 
Depending on how you respond to the treatment, your doctor may suggest a higher or lower dose. 
Do not exceed the prescribed dose. 
Copalia and older people (age 65 years or over) 
Your doctor should exercise caution when increasing your dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you take more Copalia than you should 
If you have taken too many tablets of Copalia, or if someone else has taken your tablets, consult a 
doctor immediately. Excess fluid may accumulate in your lungs (pulmonary oedema) causing 
shortness of breath that may develop up to 24-48 hours after intake. 
If you forget to take Copalia 
If you forget to take this medicine, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at its 
usual time. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. 
If you stop taking Copalia 
Stopping your treatment with Copalia may cause your disease to get worse. Do not stop taking your 
medicine unless your doctor tells you to.

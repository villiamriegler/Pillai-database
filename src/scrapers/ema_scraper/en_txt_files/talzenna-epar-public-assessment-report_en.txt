1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Pfizer Europe MA EEIG submitted on 27 April 2018 an application for marketing authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Talzenna, through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 
3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was 
agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 13 October 2016.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: Talzenna is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) 
negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision CW/1/2011 on 
the granting of a class waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the 
proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance talazoparib contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal product 
previously authorised within the European Union. 
Scientific advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice on the development relevant for the approved indication from the CHMP 
on 27 June 2013 (EMEA/H/SA/2545/1/2013/III), 25 March 2015 (EMEA/H/SA/2545/2/2015/I, 
EMEA/H/SA/2545/1/FU/1/2015/II), and 22 June 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/2545/2/FU/1/2017/I, 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 7/140 
  
  
  
 
EMEA/H/SA/2545/1/FU/2/2017/II). The Scientific Advice pertained to the following quality, non-clinical and 
clinical aspects of the dossier: 
•  Definition of starting materials; dissolution methods to demonstrate comparability across strengths/CMC 
changes; in vitro analytical comparability for additional manufacturing site; bracketing approach for batch 
data; stability studies. 
•  Adequacy of the overall non-clinical toxicology programme to support MAA. 
•  A multicentre, multinational, randomised, active-controlled phase 3 study with physician’s choice as 
comparator: Proposed study population (patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with 
BRCA 1 and/or BRCA 2 mutation); selection of physician’s choice comparator arm; progression free survival 
as primary endpoint; safety assessments and monitoring approach; statistical assumptions and approach to 
testing primary and secondary endpoints, control of type 1 error, stratification factors.  
•  Adequacy of the clinical pharmacology package to support MAA. 
•  Overall registrational strategy: adequacy of the phase 3 study, supported by data from a Phase 2 open label 
study, and the overall safety database to support full MAA; applicability of a conditional marketing 
authorisation in the proposed indication. 
•  Clinical demonstration of comparability between 4 × 0.25 mg and 1 mg capsules.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is for treatment of adult patients with germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) 
mutated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Breast cancer is the 2nd most common cause of cancer deaths in women, despite improvements in screening 
and treatment regimens. According to the World Health Organization, in 2012, 1.7 million women were 
diagnosed with breast cancer and over 522,000 women died due to the disease1. In Europe in 2018 
approximately 522,513 subjects were diagnosed with breast cancer and approximately 137,707 subjects died 
due to the disease2. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features  
Breast cancer is a biologically diverse and genetically heterogeneous disease but approximately 20 - 25% of 
hereditary breast cancers and 5 - 10% of all breast cancers are associated with mutations in breast cancer 
susceptibility genes 1 and 2 (BRCA1 and BRCA2)3, which are key components in the repair pathway for DNA 
double-strand breaks. In the United States (US) and Europe, women in the general population have a 12% 
lifetime risk of developing breast cancer4,5. In contrast, 55% to 65% of women who inherit a BRCA1 mutation 
and approximately 45% of women who inherit a BRCA2 mutation will develop breast cancer by age 70 6, 7, 8. Poly 
(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) is an enzyme with essential role in recognition and repair of single-strand 
DNA breaks through base excision repair process. 
Approximately 70% of BRCA1 mutated breast cancers present as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). In 
contrast, breast cancer patients carrying mutations in the BRCA2 gene are more likely to be positive for 
expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) and only approximately 20% have 
TNBC9.

Deleterious gBRCA mutations increase the risk of breast (and ovarian) cancer through homologous repair 
deficiency which develops as a consequence of haplo-insufficiency or locus-specific loss of heterozygosity, i.e. 
the wild type BRCA allele is no longer sufficiently active to achieve homologous repair of DNA breaks.   
gBRCA may be known in the individual patient prior to the onset of cancer of the breast or ovary, but the cancer 
may manifest itself in ways not different from non-BRCA related disease.    
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The diagnosis of breast cancer is based on clinical examination in combination with imaging, and confirmed by 
pathological assessment. Disease stage is assessed according to the TNM system10.  
Well-known prognostic and predictive factors for breast cancer include hormone receptor and HER2 expression. 
Estrogen receptor-negative, PgR-negative, HER2-negative tumours, known as TNBC, are associated with a poor 
prognosis. 
Metastatic TNBC has the worst prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes, with a median PFS of 3 to 5 months and 
a median overall survival of <12 months with currently available therapies11, 12, 13, 14, 15. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Prophylactic surgery in gBRCA carriers is one way to reduce the lifetime risk of cancer. 
The choice of treatment is informed by tumour receptor and HER2 status at the time of initiation, as tumour 
characteristics can evolve over time. A variety of treatments are approved or recommended for hormone 
receptor-positive HER2-negative disease and TNBC without specification of BRCA mutation status. 
Initial therapy of gBRCA positive breast cancer still follows the standards of therapy in breast cancer, but early 
treatment with platinum compounds in e.g. triple negative breast cancer has emerged as an alternative in the 
standard of care in the present decade. The results of the olaparib, another PARPi, study in recurrent HER2 
negative, gBRCA positive breast cancer has influenced clinical practice16.   
Treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer is palliative and the aim of the treatment is to 
reduce  symptoms  and  prolong  life  with  preservation  of  quality  of  life.  Treatment  of  advanced  or  metastatic 
breast cancer can include surgery, radiotherapy, interventional radiology and systemic palliative treatment with 
number of different anti-neoplastic agents including anti-hormonal drugs, biologicals, targeted treatments and 
cytotoxic agents. In case of palliative treatment, the use of systemic treatments is generally sequential, mainly 
monotherapy, based on patient characteristics, patient previous medical history, previous treatments, disease 
biology, disease burden and both the patient and physician preferences and experience.

For patients with progressive germline BRCA mutated, HER2 negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer  and  indication  for  new  anti-neoplastic  treatment,  after  exhaustion  of  anti-hormonal  agents  and 
anti-CDK4/6 agents if indicated, treatment with PARP inhibitors or next line palliative chemotherapy, including 
capecitabine,  eribulin  and  platinum  containing  cytotoxic  agents,  can  be  considered  as  next  treatment 
option10,17. 
Regardless  of  the  available  treatment  options,  the  disease  condition  remains  incurable  with  limited  life 
expectancy and near continuous need for palliative systemic treatment with the side effects that generally follow 
cytotoxic treatments, including fatigue and general health deterioration, and intermittently progressive disease 
with  increasing  disease  related  symptoms.  There  is  an  unmet  medical  need  for  patients  with  advanced  or 
metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer.  
About the product 
Talazoparib (PF-06944076, formerly BMN 673 or MDV3800) is a PARP inhibitor. The chemical name of 
talazoparib free base is (8S,9R) 
5-fluoro-8-(4-fluorophenyl)-9-(1-methyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-2,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrido[4,3,2-de]phthal
azin-3-one. Talazoparib is provided as the 4 methyl-benzenesulfonate (tosylate) salt. 
Talazoparib is an inhibitor of PARP enzymes, PARP1, and PARP2. PARP enzymes are involved in cellular DNA 
damage response signalling pathways such as DNA repair, gene transcription, and cell death. PARP inhibitors 
(PARPi) exert cytotoxic effects on cancer cells by 2 mechanisms, inhibition of PARP catalytic activity and by PARP 
trapping, whereby PARP protein bound to a PARPi does not readily dissociate from a DNA lesion, thus preventing 
DNA repair, replication, and transcription, thereby resulting in apoptosis and/or cell death. Treatment of cancer 
cell lines that are harbouring defects in DNA repair genes with talazoparib single agent leads to increased levels 
of γH2AX, a marker of double stranded DNA breaks, and results in decreased cell proliferation and increased 
apoptosis. Talazoparib anti-tumour activity was also observed in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) BRCA 
mutant breast cancer model where the patient was previously treated with a platinum-based regimen. In this 
PDX model talazoparib decreased tumour growth and increased γH2AX level and apoptosis in the tumours (see 
SmPC section 5.1).  
The applicant applied for the following indication: Talzenna is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) 
negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. 
The recommended indication is as follows: Talzenna is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations, who have HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer. Patients should have been previously treated with an anthracycline and/or a taxane in the 
(neo)adjuvant, locally advanced or metastatic setting unless patients were not suitable for these treatments 
(see section 5.1). Patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer should have been treated with a 
prior endocrine-based therapy, or be considered unsuitable for endocrine-based therapy. 
The recommended dose is 1 mg talazoparib once daily. Patients should be treated until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity occurs.  
Talzenna is available as hard capsules (0.25 mg and 1 mg).

Treatment with Talzenna should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
medicinal products. 
Patients should be selected for the treatment of breast cancer with Talzenna based on the presence of 
deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutations determined by an experienced laboratory using 
a validated test method.  
Genetic counselling for patients with BRCA mutations should be performed according to local regulations, as 
applicable (see SmPC section 4.2). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 0.36 mg or 1.45 mg talazoparib tosylate, 
(equivalent to 0.25 mg or 1 mg of talazoparib free base, respectively).  
Other ingredient is silicified microcrystalline cellulose (sMCC). The capsule shells contain hypromellose (HPMC), 
titanium dioxide (E171), yellow iron oxide (E172) and red iron oxide (E172). 
The printing ink consists of shellac, propylene glycol, ammonium hydroxide, black iron oxide and potassium 
hydroxide. 
The product is available in High-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle and polypropylene (PP) closure with heat 
induction seal (HIS) liner and in polyvinyl chloride / polyvinylidene chloride (PVC/PVdC) blister with an aluminum 
peel off foil lidding in cartons, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of talazoparib tosylate is (8S,9R)-5-Fluoro-8-(4-fluorophenyl)-9-(1-methyl-1H-1,2,4- 
triazol-5-yl)-2,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrido[4,3,2-de]phthalazin-3-one 4-methylbenzenesulfonate (1:1) 
corresponding to the molecular formula C 26H22F2N6O4S (tosylate salt) or C19H14F2N6O (free base). It has a 
relative molecular mass 552.56 g/mol (tosylate salt) or 380.35 g/mol (free base) and has the structure shown 
in Figure 1. 
Figure 1 Structure of talazoparib tosylate 
The structure of the active substance (AS) was elucidated by a combination of NMR (1H, 13C and 19F; 1D and 2D 
experiments), mass spectrometry (ESI+ and MSMS), IR spectroscopy and UV spectrometry. The obtained 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 13/140 
  
  
  
  
spectra are in agreement with the assigned structure. Additionally, investigations on the polymorphic form were 
conducted by X-ray powder diffraction (P-XRD). 
Talazoparib tosylate appears as a white to yellow solid non-hygroscopic crystalline powder with a low solubility. 
Talazoparib has two asymmetric centres, giving four possible stereoisomers. The absolute configuration at the 
8-position is the S optical isomer. The absolute configuration at the 9-position is the R optical isomer. 
Talazoparib tosylate exists as a single crystal form and no other polymorphs have been observed through 
extensive screening studies during development including conditions covering the solvent compositions used in 
the final isolation process.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacturing process of talazoparib tosylate comprises eight consecutive manufacturing steps, of which 
three are true chemical transformations as defined in ICH Q11 (Steps 1, 2 and 5). The remaining steps are 
purification and salt-formation steps. The proposed starting materials are consistent with the general principles 
outlined in ICH Q11 and are controlled by sufficient specifications. Potential and actual impurities were well 
discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. The impurities present in the starting materials have 
been studied with fate and purge studies and this data, along with batch history, have been used to develop 
appropriate starting material specifications that, along with the talazoparib tosylate manufacturing process, 
ensure control of talazoparib tosylate quality. Specifications were established for selected isolated 
intermediates. 
An enhanced development program was executed to define the commercial manufacturing process of 
talazoparib tosylate. Critical quality attributes of the active substance, process knowledge and sound scientific 
judgement have been used to perform a preliminary assessment of the potentially significant process 
parameters. These parameters were evaluated in Design of Experiments (DOEs). Multivariate and univariate 
experiments have then been undertaken to deduce the final critical process parameters and IPC tests. No design 
space has been claimed. The control strategy applied in the manufacturing process is satisfactory and is 
considered sufficient to guarantee the quality of the final active substance.  
The active substance is packaged in a a container which is suitable for pharmaceutical or “in contact with food” 
use  and  complies  with  the  EU  Regulation  10/2011  and  amendments,  as  well  as  Ph.  Eur.  3.1.3.  Satisfactory 
specifications for the packaging materials are included in this section. 
Specification 
Talazoparib tosylate active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for appearance (visual), 
particle size (laser diffraction), identification (IR, chiral HPLC), enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC), assay (UPLC), 
counter ion (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (HS-GC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), water content (Karl-Fischer) 
and organic impurities (UPLC, HPLC). 
The specifications for the active substance are based on batch analyses of several batches of talazoparib tosylate 
manufactured by the commercial process, and batches used for clinical and toxicological, stability data as well 
as ICH recommended Guidelines (Q3A, Q3C, Q3D, Q6A and S9). The maximum daily dose (MDD) for talazoparib 
tosylate is 1.45 mg/day (corresponding to 1 mg of talazoparib base). As talazoparib tosylate is indicted for late 
stage cancer, the applicant’s proposal to control impurities at acceptance criteria higher than the ICH Q3A 
recommended thresholds is acceptable. 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 14/140 
  
  
  
The analytical procedures used in the control of the active substance have been satisfactorily described and 
non-compendial methods have been validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Information regarding the 
reference standards used in the analytical testing is satisfactory. 
Batch analysis results and certificates of analysis of a sufficient number of commercial scale batches of the active 
substance manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site have been presented. The results met the 
specification criteria and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process from batch to batch.  
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale batches of active substance stored in the intended commercial 
packaging for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 °C / 60 % RH), and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75 % RH) was provided according to the ICH guidelines.  
Samples were tested for appearance, water content, related substances, enantiomeric purity, assay and solid 
form. The test methods were the same as for release and are stability indicating. No significant changes to any 
of the measured parameters were observed under long term and accelerated conditions and all remained within 
specification.  
Supportive stability data are also available through 36 months and 6 months at 25°C/60% RH and 
40°C/75% RH, respectively. No significant change were observed in any of the monitored parameters through 
36 months and 6 months at 25°C/60% RH and 40°C/75% RH respectively, compared to the initial values. 
Photostability was investigated as per ICH Q1B on one commercial scale batch. The active substance did show 
slight signs of degradation after exposure to light without the protection of the primary packaging material and 
is hence considered to be photosensitive. This is mitigated by the use of an aluminium pouch as part of the 
container closure system. 
Stress testing was conducted in solution (acidic, alkaline and oxidizing conditions), as well as solid state (heat 
and light). Degradation was observed under acidic, peroxide oxidation and light exposed conditions; the highest 
degradation occurred under alkaline conditions. Results from mass balance demonstrate that the method for 
assay and related substances is stability indicating. 
Based on the presented stability data, the proposed re-test period of 36 months is considered acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Talzenna is provided as an immediate release 0.25 mg and 1 mg strengths hard hypromellose (HPMC), opaque 
capsules  for  oral  administration.  The  strengths  are  differentiated  by  capsule  shell  colour  and  printing.  The 
0.25 mg strength capsules are size 4, (white body/ivory cap) of which the body is printed with “TLZ 0.25” and 
the cap printed with “Pfizer” in black. The 1 mg strength capsules are size 4, (white body/light red cap) of which 
the body is printed with “TLZ 1” and the cap printed with “Pfizer” in black ink. 
The two capsule strengths are dose proportional with respect to the active substance (AS) content; the amount 
of filler is changed to account for the change in AS within the meaning of condition c i) and iii) of the 
bioequivalence guideline. The excipients and container closure system are common for this type of dosage form. 
Silicified microcrystalline cellulose NF (sMCC) is a co-processed material consisting of microcrystalline cellulose 
particles and colloidal silicon dioxide.  
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 15/140 
  
  
  
Compatibility of the AS with silicified microcrystalline cellulose was investigated by exposing capsules of both 
strengths under open dish conditions. 
The goal for formulation development across different drug product generations (DP Gen) was to improve 
capsule manufacturability and scalability suitable for each stage of clinical development, while minimising the 
potential impact on finished product performance.  This was accomplished by maintaining essentially the same 
qualitative formulation composition, but modifying the level and grade of sMCC, active susbtance loading, and 
the capsule fill weight.   
The manufacturing processes for DP Gen 2.0 and DP Gen 3.1 have similar manufacturing processes that include 
processing steps for screening, mixing, and encapsulation; DP Gen 3.1 has an additional blending step after the 
mixing step.  A detailed description of the formulation used in clinical studies throughout the development of 
talazoparib was provided.  
The applicant applied Quality by design (QbD) concepts to develop Talzenna hard capsules. The quality target 
product  profile  (QTPP),  was  defined  based  on  the  formulation  developed  for  clinical  studies,  manufacturing 
process considerations and the properties of the active substance.  
Identification of product critical quality attributes (CQAs) was based on the severity of harm to a patient (safety 
and  efficacy)  resulting  from  failure  to  meet  that  quality  attribute  of  the  finished  product.  Pharmaceutical 
development  focused  on  those  CQAs  that  could  be  impacted  by  a  realistic  change  to  the  finished  product 
formulation  or  manufacturing  process.  The  CQAs  were  selected  based  on  prior  information  and  knowledge 
gained from pharmaceutical development studies of the same or similar types of formulations.  
Attributes and parameters have been categorised as either critical or non-critical, based on their impact to the 
product quality.  Where a quality attribute has been designated as critical (CQA), associated elements of the 
control  strategy  have  been  explained  in  detail.    Ranges  where  acceptable  product  can  be  made  have  been 
identified for process parameters. The control strategy encompasses finished product specifications, compendial 
tests and GMP controls to ensure that the manufacturing process will consistently produce a finished product 
which fulfils all the quality attributes listed in the QTPP.  
The  process  understanding  developed  for  each  unit  operation  was  used  to  define  the  proposed  commercial 
manufacturing  process.  The  process  consists  of  manufacturing  a  simple  binary  dry  mix  of  the  API  with  the 
excipient silicified microcrystalline cellulose, followed by encapsulation. A series of experiments was conducted 
to study the influence of the selected process parameters on the critical quality attributes of the drug product. 
Based on these experiments, process target values and acceptable ranges were established. Experiments were 
conducted on full commercial scale. No design space is claimed. 
Talazoparib capsules are immediate release (IR) products designed to disintegrate and dissolve rapidly under 
the physiological conditions in the stomach. The solubility of talazoparib tosylate is low across the physiological 
pH range at 37 °C. The highest dose strength/clinical dose for talazoparib (1 mg), however, is soluble in less 
than 250 mL of aqueous media. Hence, talazoparib absorption is expected to be neither solubility-limited nor 
reliant on dissolution performance. 
A dissolution method was developed and validated for the release and stability testing of talazoparib capsules. 
Given the solubility of the active substance and the simplicity of the formulation as well as the tightening of the 
dissolution  specification  it  is  deemed  that  there  is  no  need  for  further  investigation  of  the  discriminatory 
properties of the dissolution method. 
Two container closure systems are proposed for Talzenna 0.25 mg and 1 mg hard capsules: 
•  High-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles and polypropylene (PP) closures with heat induction (HIS) 
seal liners 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 16/140 
  
  
  
• 
Polyvinyl chloride/polyvinylidene chloride (PVC/PVdC) blisters with aluminum peel off foil lidding 
Specifications and analytical procedures for control of the packaging material were provided in the dossier. The 
HDPE containers, the PP caps and the PVC/PVdC duplex film comply with EU Regulation 10/2011, as well as 
Ph.Eur.  3.1.3  and  3.2.2.  Compliance  of  the  aluminium  foil  (sealing  film)  with  EU  Regulation  10/2011  and 
Directive 94/62/EC has also been stated. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Talazoparib immediate release capsules are manufactured by a conventional manufacturing process which 
includes dry mixing/blending and encapsulation. Because of the low active substance load of both strengths (< 
2%), the manufacturing process is regarded as non-standard process (Guideline on Process Validation for 
Finished Products - Information and Data to be Provided in Regulatory Submissions, 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/BWP/70278/2012-Rev1,Corr.1). 
Critical process parameters have been identified and suitable in-proces controls are put in place.  
Talazoparib tosylate is a clastogenic agent therefore the manufacture and development of the capsules has to be 
performed within high containment facilities.  
The manufacturing process has been validated on three commercial scale batches of each strength. Process 
validation results comply with set acceptance criteria. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is sufficiently robust to provide assurance that hard 
capsules of consistent quality, complying with the designated specification, are produced. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for appearance 
(visual), identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur. - HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product is released on the market through traditional final product release testing. 
 The maximum daily dose (MDD) for Talzenna is 1.45 mg/day (corresponding to 1 mg of talazoparib base). The 
proposed limits for specified and unspecified impurities are in line with ICHQ3B and hence acceptable. 
A risk assessment on elemental impurities was performed on the talazoparib finished product as per ICH Q3D 
(Option 1). Based on the  outcome, no controls or acceptance criteria for individual elemental impurities are 
proposed for talazoparib finished product, as the risk of elemental impurities being present at levels above the 
oral PDEs has been established to be negligible.  
Chiral purity of talazoparib tosylate active substance is controlled via the active substance specification and this 
was  considered  sufficient  based  on  the  information  that  was  presented.  All  impurities,  including  chiral,  are 
appropriately controlled via the drug substance and drug product specifications.  
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of finished 
product has been presented. 
Batch analysis results for historical batches of both strengths used in the clinical program, as well as results of 
the most recent commercial scale batches for both strengths were provided in the dossier. All parameters are 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 17/140 
  
  
  
within the specified limits. Impurities are well controlled. It is concluded that the process is well controlled and 
that the finished product can be manufactured with consistent quality and meeting its specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 12 commercial scale batches of Talzenna (three batches of each strength and container closure 
system) were stored under long term conditions (25°C±2°C / 60%±5% RH) and intermediate conditions 
(30°C±2°C / 75%±5% RH) for up to 12 months and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40°C±2°C / 75%±5% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches were with two 
different batches of active substance. The primary packaging was representative of the one proposed for 
marketing.  
The following parameters have been investigated: appearance, assay, related substances, water content, 
dissolution and microbial quality. The methods used were the same as for release testing and are stability 
indicating.   
The  product  is  generally  very  stable  in  both  proposed  container  packaging  systems  and  only  slight  signs  of 
degradation are observable at higher temperatures and  humidity. The results  showed no general trends for 
degradation.  At  accelerated  and  intermediate  conditions,  an  increase  of  impurities  is  noticeable  over  time. 
Furthermore, a gradual increase in water content can be observed. No change in dissolution and assay is noticed 
for the time-frame covered so far under all storage conditions. 
Forced degradation studies were performed. The protocol included degradation in the solid state by heat (70°C), 
humidity (70°C/75%RH) and light (ICH Option 1). Results from mass balance demonstrate that the method for 
assay and related substances is stability indicating. 
A photostability study has been performed on unprotected Talzenna 0.25 mg and 1.0 mg hard capsules, as well 
as protected by the primary packaging (blisters and HDPE container). The conditions of the study were selected 
according to ICH Q1B. The samples were tested for appearance, degradation products, assay, dissolution and 
water content. The drug product did show signs of degradation after exposure to light without the protection of 
the respective primary packaging materials. The degradation is far more pronounced for the lower strength. All 
other  tested  quality  attributes  remain  unchanged,  except  for  a  slight  decrease  in  assay  which  balances  the 
increase in total impurities. No degradation trends were observed when the capsules were protected by the 
respective  primary  packaging  material.  As  no  significant  changes  were  observed  during  the  photostability 
studies, the finished product was concluded to be stable against light. 
Based on the provided stability data, the proposed shelf life of 2 years without special storage conditions, as 
stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients used in the manufacture of talazoparib capsules are of human or animal origin 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that from a quality perspective 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
EMA/270498/2019

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Non-clinical  primary  and  secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  and  safety  pharmacology  studies  were 
submitted.  All  pivotal  studies  (general  toxicity,  developmental  and  reproductive  toxicity,  genetic  toxicity, 
phototoxicity, hERG and safety pharmacology) were conducted in compliance with GLP. For in vitro assessment 
of DNA damage and cytotoxicity markers, non-GLP studies were provided. Talazoparib is also referred to as PF 
06944076, MDV3800, BMN 673, LT-00673 in some of these studies.

Effect of Talazoparib on PARP Trapping 
The potency to trap PARP–DNA complexes varies widely across the different PARPi and is not correlated with the 
potency of their PARP catalytic inhibition (Murai et al, 2012).  The varying cytotoxicity profile of PARPi was 
proposed to be correlated with the PARP trapping potency and not the catalytic activity (Shen et al, 2013).

PARP trapping was originally assessed in an assay of chromatin-bound PARP1 and PARP2 levels in damaged DNA 
in the prostate cancer DU145 cell line treated with 0.1% methyl methane sulfonate (MMS, a DNA alkylating 
agent that stimulates ssDNA breaks and potentiates PARP trapping) in the presence or absence of talazoparib, 
olaparib, or rucaparib.  Treatment with PARPi (talazoparib, olaparib, or rucaparib) was associated with a 
concentration-dependent increases in the levels of both PARP1 and PARP2 bound chromatin complexes.

Talazoparib (MDV3800) antitumour activity in BR-05-0028 breast cancer PDX model.  Balb/c nude mice (n = 7/group) bearing 
BR-05-0028 xenografts were dosed with vehicle, talazoparib (PO, 0.3 mg/kg QD), or carboplatin (IP, 30 mg/kg QWx1).  The 
study was terminated on Day 67.  Data are presented as the mean ± SEM.  PO = oral administration; QD = Once daily; QW x 
1 = Once weekly; SEM = Standard error of the mean.

Five patient-derived xenograft (PDX) triple negative breast cancer models were evaluated with a single agent 
dosing regimen of talazoparib at 0.07 mg/kg and 0.15 mg/kg. The 5 models tested were the BRCA1-mutated 
T168 PDX model, BRCA2-mutated HBC-x10 PDX model, and 3 PDX models that are wild type for BRCA1/2, 
HBC-x6, HBC-x9, and HBC-x12B.

Talazoparib MW = 380.35. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Talazoparib was profiled in vitro against a broad panel of over 70 receptors, enzymes and ion channels at a 
single concentration of 10 µM.  Less than 50% inhibition of binding or enzyme activity was observed against all 
targets (Studies AA86818 and AA87288). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
A battery of safety pharmacology studies was conducted with Talazoparib to examine potential effects on the 
cardiovascular,  respiratory  and  the  central,  peripheral  and  autonomic  nervous  systems.  These  studies  were 
conducted in accordance  with the  ICH Guidelines on  Safety  Pharmacology (ICH S7A, ICH S7B).  All of  these 
studies were conducted in compliance with GLP. 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 23/140 
  
  
  
 
CNS 
To evaluate potential effects on the central nervous system, talazoparib was administered as a single oral dose 
to male rats at 0, 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg, and were subjected to a modified Irwin battery to detect potential effects 
on central and peripheral nervous systems. There were no talazoparib-related effects on the parameters 
evaluated in modified Irwin battery of neurological assessments. Toxicokinetic parameters were not measured 
in this study, but based on the 5-day rat study (8227540), maximum mean unbound plasma concentration at 3 
mg/kg/day was 62.6 ng/kg and was 11.4x the observed unbound human Cmax concentration at the 1 
mg/dayclinical dose (5.46 ng/mL). 
Respiratory 
Talazoparib was administered as a single oral dose to male rats at 0, 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg to assess potential effects 
on the respiratory system (Study 8229153) over a 5.5-hour period using whole body plethysmography at 
baseline and then starting at 0.5 and 24 hours post dose.  Tidal volume was decreased as much as 12% (relative 
to control) in all dose groups administered talazoparib.  These generally non-dose dependent decreases in tidal 
volume were offset by the non-statistically significant increases in respiration rate so that there was no overall 
change in minute volume. Toxicokinetic parameters were not measured in this study, but based on the 5-day rat 
study (8227540), maximum mean unbound plasma concentration at 3 mg/kg (the highest dose tested) was 
62.6 ng/mL and was 11.4x the observed unbound human Cmax concentration at the 1 mg daily clinical dose 
(5.46 ng/mL). 
Cardiovascular 
Talazoparib was evaluated for its effect on binding to the hERG (human ether- à -go-go gene) potassium channel 
stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells (Study 8229172).  Talazoparib inhibited the hERG 
current 6.7%, 14.2% and 33.4% at concentrations of 10, 30 and 100 µM.  Due to solubility limitations the 
highest dose that could be tested was 100 µM and an IC50 could not be calculated since 50% inhibition was not 
achieved at the concentrations tested.  Thus the IC50 for hERG inhibition is considered >100 µM (38000 ng/mL) 
and is approximately >6996-fold above the observed unbound human clinical exposure at 1 mg daily human 
dose based on mean unbound steady state Cmax of 5.46 ng/mL. 
To further evaluate the potential for talazoparib to affect the cardiovascular system in vivo, electrocardiogram 
(ECG) assessments were added on to the repeat GLP dog studies (8227539, 8227532, 8279298).  No effects on 
ECG’s were noted at doses of up to the highest dose tested (0.1 mg/kg) with mean unbound plasma exposures 
corresponding to 3.5x above human clinical exposure at 1 mg daily dose based on mean unbound steady state 
Cmax of 5.46 ng/mL. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies were not submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
High-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) methods were developed for 
the quantitation of talazoparib in mouse, rat, and dog plasma for the determination of pharmacokinetic 
parameters.  
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 24/140 
  
  
  
Single dose pharmacokinetics 
The PK of talazoparib were characterized in rats, and dogs as having low plasma clearance relative to hepatic 
blood flow, moderate Vss that approximated or exceeded total body water, and moderate to high oral 
bioavailability. These results are summarized in the following tables:

Multiple dose pharmacokinetics 
Dogs 
In study 8227539, after 5 daily doses, from 0.003 to 0.1 mg/kg/day in beagle dogs. Increases in mean Cmax 
and AUC0-24 were observed that were greater than dose proportional. Sex differences were less than 2-fold in 
Talazoparib  mean Cmax and AUC0-24 values.   
In study 8227532, after 28 daily doses, Cmax in male and female dogs seem to reach a steady state in the 
0.0015 & 0.005 mg/kg/day groups with similar Cmax levels recorded at Day 15 and Day 28.  However, at 28 
days, a higher dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day did not achieve a Steady State Cmax value and a 1/3 higher Cmax values 
were recorded at Day 28 as compared to Day 15.  Similar trends were observed for the exposure (AUC(0-24)) 
of Talazoparib.  A clear relationship between Cmax and dose was observed for the<0.01 mg/kg/day dose.  
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 25/140 
  
  
  
 
 
 
In study 8279298, after 13 weeks of daily dosing in dogs,  accumulation of Talazoparib in plasma was observed 
with accumulation ratios generally similar for Cmax and AUC0-24 on Day 29 (range 1.98 to 4.25 and 2.30 to 
4.63 for Cmax and AUC0-24, respectively) and Day 91 (range 2.09 to 4.36 and 2.55 to 4.15 for Cmax and 
AUC0-24, respectively).  Differences in mean Cmax and AUC0-24 were less than 2-fold between males and 
females with the exception of the Group 4 M/F ratio for Cmax on Day 1 (0.49). The remainder of the M/F ratios 
in Cmax and AUC0-24 ranged from 0.58 to 1.36. 
Rats 
In study 8227540, after 5 daily doses, from 0.3 to 3.0 mg/kg/day in rats. Increases in mean Cmax and AUC0-24 
were observed that were greater than dose proportional on Day 5. Sex differences were less than 2-fold in 
Talazoparib  mean Cmax and AUC0-24 values.  No accumulation of Talazoparib was observed after multiple 
dosing of Talazoparib in rats. 
In the rat study 8227533, after 28 single daily oral doses, exposure to Talazoparib increased with the dose level 
from 0.005 to 0.05 mg/kg/day. The increases in mean Cmax for males and females were greater than dose 
proportional, while increases in mean AUC0-24 were roughly dose proportional. Sex differences were less than 
2-fold in Talazoparib mean Cmax and AUC0-24 values.  Similarly to study 8227532, higher than expected Cmax 
and Exposure (AUC0-24) values were recorded at the high dose level at Day 28.   
In study 8279299, after 13 weeks of daily dosing in rats,  exposure to Talazoparib increased with increase in 
dose from 0.005 to 0.050 mg/kg/day. Increases in Cmax were generally greater than proportional to increase in 
dose on Days 1, 29 and 91, while increases in AUC0-24 were generally greater than proportional to increase in 
on dose on Day 1, and proportional to increase in dose on Day 29 and Day 91.  With repeat daily dosing, 
accumulation of Talazoparib in plasma was observed with accumulation ratios generally greater for Cmax and 
AUC0-24 on Day 91 (range 3.81 to 4.98 and 3.52 to 4.10 for Cmax and AUC0-24, respectively) compared to Day 
29 (range 1.86 to 3.77 and 1.36 to 2.57 for Cmax and AUC0-24, respectively). 
Distribution 
Brain penetration in mice 
The pharmacokinetics and the ability of talazoparib to distribute to brain tissue were evaluated in male 
FVB/NTac wild type mice and the multi-drug resistant and breast cancer resistance protein (Mdr1a/b-Bcrp; FVB) 
constitutive triple knockout mice (n=4/sex/time point) after a single oral dose of 0.5 mg/kg (BMN673-14-043).  
Plasma and dilution corrected whole brain homogenate exposure (AUC24) to talazoparib in the Mdr1a/b-Bcrp 
knockout mice were 1.9x and 15x higher, respectively, to those observed in the wild-type mice.  The Kp values, 
based brain to plasma ratio (AUCbrain to AUCplasma), were 0.225 in the Mdr1a/b-Bcrp knockout mice and 0.0294 
in the wild-type mice.  These results further confirm that talazoparib is a substrate of the efflux transporters in 
rodent as well as the human MDR1 and BCRP isoforms. 
Tissue distribution in male rats 
Following oral administration of [14C]talazoparib to the male S-D rat, measurable concentrations of 
radioequivalents were observed in blood from 1 to 12 hours after dosing, with Cmax occurring at 1 hour.  
[14C]talazoparib-related radioequivalents were widely distributed to tissues.  Drug-related radioequivalents 
were present in approximately 41 tissues in the S-D rat at concentrations that were at least 0.1x to 14x their 
respective plasma values between 1 and 24 hours postdose.  Excluding the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the 
tissues with the highest [14C]talazoparib-related radioequivalents were mainly the organs of elimination, 
including liver, kidney medulla, kidney, kidney cortex, and adrenal gland.  By 48 hours after dosing 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 26/140 
  
  
  
[14C]talazoparib-related radioequivalents were completely eliminated from most, but not all tissues in the S-D 
rat. 
In pigmented male LE rats, the same initial distribution pattern was observed. Drug-related radioequivalents 
were eliminated from all tissues by 72 hours postdose, with the exception of GI contents, uveal tract, lymph 
nodes, pigmented and non-pigmented skin, and spleen.  The uptake and retention of [14C]talazoparib-related 
radioactivity was prominent with measureable concentrations in the pigmented uveal tract of the eye for up to 
72 hours after dosing, suggestive of talazoparib binding to melanin.  However, by 168 hours 
[14C]talazoparib-related radioequivalents was fully eliminated from all tissues, including the uveal tract, 
indicating that melanin association was reversible. 
Drug-related radioequivalents were generally below the limit of quantitation (BLQ; 30.6 ng 
equivalents 14C-talazoparib/g) in the tissues of the CNS in both the S-D and LE rats.  Radioactivity was only 
detected at low levels in the choroid plexus, external to the CNS, for the first hour only in LE rats and up to 4 
hours in the S-D rat. 
In vitro protein binding 
The binding of talazoparib to proteins in plasma from CD1 mice, S-D rats, beagle dogs, cynomolgus monkey and 
humans was assessed in vitro at nominal plasma concentrations of 0.01, 0.1 and 1 µM at approximately 37°C 
using the rapid equilibrium dialysis method (MDV3800P005). Talazoparib was highly protein bound in mouse 
and rat plasma, and moderately bound in dog, monkey, and human plasma with mean unbound fractions (f u) of 
0.0442, 0.101, 0.365, 0.329, and 0.260 in these respective species.  There was no marked change in the fu for 
talazoparib over the evaluated concentration range in the respective species. 
Red blood cell partitioning 
The mean Cb/C p of talazoparib in rats, dogs, and humans were 0.572, 0.931, and 1.05, respectively, suggesting 
that talazoparib showed a negligible preferential distribution into the red blood cells in rats and was evenly 
distributed between red blood cells and plasma in dog and human whole blood. 
Metabolism 
In vitro 
The in vitro metabolism of talazoparib was investigated after incubation with liver microsomes from rats, dogs 
and humans. There was negligible turnover of talazoparib when incubated with liver microsomes in all of the 
species evaluated.  The percent of parent remaining at 120 min in rat, dog and human microsomes was, 91.5%, 
100% and 100%, respectively. Minor amounts of the N-demethylated (M9, PF-07052922) and the 
dehydrogenated (M1, PF-07052386) metabolites, were observed in mouse hepatocytes after incubating for 240 
min, accounting for 1.16% and 1.33% 
In vivo 
In vivo metabolism of [14C]talazoparib was evaluated in rats, dogs, and humans following oral administration.  
In general, metabolism was a minor clearance pathway (<2% of the dose in rats and <20% of the dose in dogs) 
in the nonclinical species and humans (<15% of the dose) with talazoparib primarily eliminated from the body 
by excretion of unchanged drug in the urine and feces. The minor metabolites observed mainly involved 
hydroxylation and dehydrogenation. All minor oxidative metabolites observed in humans have also been 
observed in rats and/or dogs. 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 27/140 
  
  
  
 
[8S, 9R]-talazoparib was the only stereoisomer circulating in the plasma of rats.  Plasma concentrations of the 
[8R, 9S]-enantiomer (PF-07052027, MDV10244, LT-000674) were below the limit of quantitation and support 
that talazoparib did not undergo chiral inversion in the rat following oral administration. Similar observations 
were made when studying samples from the human mass balance study. 
Talazoparib was the only circulating drug-related product identified in humans after oral administration of a 
single 1 mg (100 µCi) dose of [14C]talazoparib 
Excretion 
In rats, the recovery of radioactivity was essentially complete by 240 hours (10-days) postdose with 95.1 and 
97.6%, of the dose collected in the excreta from bile-duct intact male and female rats, respectively.  The major 
route of elimination of radioactivity was by fecal excretion, accounting for 73.6% of the dose in male rats and 
70.9% of the dose in female rats.  Urinary excretion was a minor route of elimination and accounted for 19.4% 
of the dose in male rat and 25.8% of the dose in female rats.  Biliary excretion was low in bile duct cannulated 
male rats with 3.37% of the dose excreted in the bile over a 120 hour period and 24.2% of the dose in the urine 
and 64.1% in the feces, for a total recovery of 93.5% of the dose. 
In dogs, the recovery of radioactivity was essentially complete by 336 hours (14-days) postdose with 93.1% and 
94.0%, of the dose collected in the excreta from males and females respectively.  The major route of elimination 
of radioactivity was by fecal excretion, accounting for 68.0% of the dose in male dogs and 66.6% of the dose in 
female dogs.  Urinary excretion was a minor route of elimination and accounted for 21.1% of the dose in male 
dogs and 24.4% of the dose in female dogs. 
In female human patients with solid tumours, the majority of radioactivity was recovered in the first 168 hours 
(7-days) post-dose and essentially complete by 504 hours (21-days) postdose with approximately 88.3% of the 
dose recovered.  The major route of elimination of radioactivity was by urinary excretion, which accounted for a 
mean of 68.7% of the dose with the fecal route as a minor elimination pathways accounting for 19.7% of the 
dose in humans.

Micronucleus assay indicate that 
Talazoparib induced 
statistically-significant increases in 
the incidence of micronucleated 
polychromatic erythrocytes at all 
dose levels evaluated.  
In standard genotoxicity assays, talazoparib was not mutagenic, but was found to be clastogenic in the in vitro 
chromosome aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), and in the in vivo rat bone marrow 
micronucleus assay.  Additional investigative work was completed to further characterize the genotoxicity and 
the mechanism of action for talazoparib when combined with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ), which 
potentiates the pharmacological activity of talazoparib.  The studies were performed in the DNA Damage 
Response (DDR) deficient, BRCA2 mutant, PSA insensitive DU145 Prostate Cancer Cell line. 
Results showed that in DU145 cells, talazoparib alone induced double strand DNA (dsDNA) breaks (measured by 
γH2AX staining) as well as cell cycle arrest in S phase and inhibited cell growth starting at 0.0005 µM (0.5 nM).  
Micronucleus induction was assessed as a marker of clastogenicity (genotoxicity) and was observed starting at 
0.0007 µM (0.7 nM).  When DU145 cells were co-treated with 128 µM of TMZ, inhibition of cell growth and 
micronuclei formation occurred starting at 0.0004 (0.4 nM) and 0.0001 (0.1 nM) µM, respectively.  TMZ alone 
did not induce either cytotoxicity or clastogenicity in DU145 cells at the concentrations tested in this study (up 
to 128 µM).  However, both the cytotoxicity and clastogenicity of talazoparib was potentiated by TMZ.

At 0.15 mg/kg/day, 8/25 dams in the main study group were found dead or euthanized early (3 were euthanized 
due to adverse clinical observations on GD 17 (2 rats) and GD 18, respectively; and 5 were found dead on GD 
17, 19, 20 and 21 (2 rats), respectively).  Clinical observations prior to mortality or unscheduled euthanasia 
included dehydration, hunched posture, cold to touch, decreased activity, thin body condition due to reduced 
food consumption (40.5% reduction between GD 10 and 18), and partially closed and/or pale eyes. 
Pregnancy was observed in 24 to 25 of the rats in each dose group.  All pregnant dams at ≤0.05 mg/kg/day 
survived to scheduled euthanasia.  Due to the early deaths, the number of pregnant dams evaluated at 0 
(vehicle), 0.015, 0.05, and 0.15 mg/kg/day dose groups on GD 21 (scheduled euthanasia) were 24, 25, 25, and 
16, respectively.  There were no live   at ≥0.05 mg/kg/day and at 0.015 mg/kg/day, 90.7% of the fetuses were 
resorbed in the litters. Fetal body weights (male, female and total) at 0.015 mg/kg/day were reduced (≤28%) 
compared to the control group values.  At 0.015 mg/kg/day, litters with fetal malformations and variations 
included depressed eye bulge, small eye, misshapen zygomatic arch, incompletely ossified, split or misshapen 
sternebrae, supernumerary ribs, incompletely ossified, fused and/or misshapen cervical arch.

Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
In vitro 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the phototoxicity potential of talazoparib as measured by the relative 
reduction in viability of BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts exposed to talazoparib and ultraviolet radiation (+UVR), 
compared to the viability of fibroblasts exposed to talazoparib in the absence of ultraviolet radiation (-UVR).  
Promethazine was used as the positive control (Study 20054208).  The study design followed the OECD 
guideline for the testing of chemicals and the ICH S10 Guideline. In this definitive phototoxicity assay, 
talazoparib tosylate (all doses represent free base equivalents) and promethazine were tested up to the 
maximum solubility limits of 31.9 and 178 µg/mL 
In the DRF assay, the IC50 for phototoxicity (+UVR) was 6.163 µg/mL.  In the definitive assays (2 assays), the 
IC50 for talazoparib-induced phototoxicity (+UVR) was 9.389 µg/mL in assay 1 (PIF >3.408; MPE, 0.345) and 
9.015 µg/mL in assay 2 (PIF >3.540; MPE, 0.275) in the absence of cytotoxicity (cell survival was 90% and 
86%, respectively). The actual PIF could not be calculated for talazoparib and therefore a “>PIF” was calculated 
using the highest testable talazoparib concentration (-UVR). It is concluded that talazoparib has phototoxic 
potential (+UVR) in the absence of cytotoxicity in the BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. 
In vivo 
The objectives of this study are to determine the potential phototoxic effects of talazoparib, when administered 
by oral gavage once daily for 3 consecutive days, on the eyes and skin of female Crl:LE (Long-Evans, LE) 
pigmented rats, followed by exposure to ultraviolet B, ultraviolet A and visible light from a xenon lamp (Study 
20116618).

The female LE rats (5/dose in the main study, 3/dose for bioanalysis) were administered vehicle control or 
talazoparib tosylate at 0, 0.015, or 0.05 mg/kg/day once daily for 3 consecutive days. Approximately 3 hours 
following the last administration on Day 3, the rats were exposed to UVR. 
There were no talazoparib-related mortality or clinical observations, and all rats survived to scheduled 
euthanasia on Day 3.  There were no talazoparib-related cutaneous reactions or macroscopic or microscopic 
ocular findings that were indicative of phototoxicity. The NOAEL for the study is 0.05 mg/kg/day and the Cmax 
and AUC6 exposures on Day 3 are 18.5 (unbound:1.87) ng/mL and 84 (unbound: 8.48) ng•h/mL, respectively.  
The unbound Cmax exposure margin at the NOAEL is 0.34x to the unbound observed exposure at the clinical dose 
of 1 mg daily.  Due to limited bioanalysis conducted in the study (up to 6 hours), the AUC 24 margins could not 
be determined in the study. 
Mechanistic Investigation of Bone Marrow Suppression Associated with Talazoparib 
Bone marrow (BM) suppression resulting in hematological toxicity has been identified as the dose-limiting 
toxicity for talazoparib, in both nonclinical toxicology studies and in clinical trials. The molecular mechanism, 
cross species sensitivity, and potential for any lineage-specific effects were evaluated in vitro using peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells. No lineage specific effects on BM cell viability were seen with talazoparib and the 
outcome was similar among erythroid, myeloid and megakaryocyte lineages.  
To explore potential effects of Talazoparib on the bone marrow, a study 17LJ085 (non-GLP) was conducted using 
human bone marrow mononuclear cells (hBMMNCs, a heterogeneous population that includes hematopoietic 
lineage  cells  such  as  erythrocytes,  monocytes,  stem  cells  and  progenitor  cells)  and  human  bone  marrow 
hematopoietic  stem  cells  (CD34+)  as  well  as  human  PBMCs  from  normal  human  donors.    These  studies 
consisted of an in vitro PBMC and hBMMNCs viability assay measured by intracellular ATP content.  Cells were 
exposed to Talazoparib for 24 hours.  The results obtained show that up to 100 μM, Talazoparib did not impact 
on PBMC cell viability.  In contrast, positive control, dinaciclib, a CDK inhibitor cytotoxic to PBMCs, affected cell 
viability  dose-dependently.  When  PBMCs  were  dosed  with  talazoparib  or  talazoparib  and  temozolomide 
combination for up to 72 hours, decreased cell viability was observed only at talazoparib concentrations ≥ 10 μ
M in combination with temozolomide (a DNA alkylating agent).  
Evaluation of BMMNC from human, rat and mouse showed that rat BMMNC was most sensitive to the effect of 
talazoparib on cell viability (IC50 values were 2.9, 5.4, and 6.9 nM for rat, mouse, and human, respectively). 
The functional consequences of PARPi activity were further evaluated in multiparametric DDR assays in bone 
marrow cells treated with talazoparib.  The DNA alkylating agent TMZ was used as a molecular tool to induce 
DNA damage, including single stranded DNA (ssDNA) breaks, which stimulate a BER response and increase 
reliance on PARP for DNA repair and cell survival.  Induction of apoptosis (caspase activation) and synergistic 
cytotoxicity were observed when hBMMNCs were treated with talazoparib + TMZ.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacological rationale for the PARP inhibitors is to target tumour cell with BRCA gene defects, in which 
case, the combination of the PARP mediated inhibition of DNA repair and the BRCA gene defect results in 
synthetic lethality. Tumour selectivity would be achieved by that normal cells, expressing one functional BRCA 
allele would not be equally sensitive to the effect of the PARP inhibitor. 
The idea that essentially all tumour cells in cancers caused by the BRCA mutation have undergone loss of 
heterozygosity has however been challenged. In a recent paper from Maxwell and co. 18, it is shown that in a set 
of 160 BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation associated breast and ovarian tumours, retention of the normal 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 allele was observed in 7% of BRCA ovarian, 16% of BRCA2 ovarian, 10% of BRCA1 breast, and 
46% of BRCA2 breast tumours. While acknowledging that there are limitations to the study, the authors propose 
that the use of a BRCA locus-specific LOH assay could be valuable to predict the response to therapy with 
platinum or PARP inhibitors. The uncertainty around using LOH as a biomarker for susceptibility to a PARP 
inhibitor was discussed by the applicant. Most importantly, there is today no practical possibility to apply this 
biomarker in the clinical practice. It is certain that further characterisation of tumour characteristics could lead 
to identification of biomarkers which would enable better identification of patients likely to benefit from therapy 
(see clinical aspects).  
Talazoparib has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2 with relevant activity also at other 
members of the PARP family. No data was presented on PPARs from rat or dog. However, based on the 
conserved nature of these proteins and most importantly, the expected toxicity at exposure levels below clinical 
exposure in the toxicity studies, it can be concluded that findings in rat and dog well reflect the pharmacological 
activity in humans. 
In vitro anti-tumour activity was demonstrated in a number of cell lines. These data show that talazoparib is also 
active in tumour cells harbouring mutations in other genes involved in DNA repair, such as PTEN and MLH-1, 
with little activity in tumour cells with no known mutation affecting DNA repair. 
The cytotoxic activity of different PARP inhibitors is not directly correlated to the potency for enzyme inhibition. 
It has been proposed that cytotoxicity is more related to the PARP trapping potency, whereby PARP protein 
bound to the inhibitor does not readily dissociate from the DNA lesion, thus preventing DNA repair, replication 
and transcription. The applicant has provided data showing that talazoparib exhibits more potent PARP trapping, 
relative to PARP enzyme inhibition, in a BRCA1 mutant tumour cell that is sensitive to talazoparib cytotoxicity 
then in a BRCA1 tumour cell that is less sensitive to talazoparib cytotoxicity.  These data give some support to 
the view that PARP trapping is the more important activity for anti-tumour effect. 
In vivo anti-tumour activity has been demonstrated in mouse models with patient derived xenografts (PDX 
models). In these models talzoparib showed potent anti-tumour activity with xenografts from BRCA1 mutant 
and BRCA2 mutant breast cancers. Out of three BRCA1/2 wildtype tumours talazoparib showed potent activity 
in one case. Further data showed that for the BRCA1/2 wt tumour cell responding to talazoparib, BRCA1 
methylation was substantially lower than in two other nonresponsive WT cell lines (data not shown). While not

conclusive, these data indicate that BRCA-dependent tumour susceptibility to talazoparib can be present in 
absence of mutations. To some extent, these data support the concept that further biomarkers predictive for 
susceptibility to PARP inhibitors could be identified (see discussion on clinical aspects). 
A conventional screening assay for activity at a set of receptors, enzymes and ion channels did not show any 
evidence for a clinically relevant off-target activity (data not shown). 
No safety concerns were identified in a standard package of safety pharmacology studies (respiration, CNS and 
cardiovascular). In the in vivo dog study assessing ECG effects, the Cmax was only 3.5x clinical exposure. 
However, no effect was seen in the in vitro hERG studies at a concentration ~7000-fold the unbound clinical 
exposure. 
Local tolerance studies have not been submitted as the oral route is the clinical route of administration for 
Talazoparib which was considered acceptable. 
The nonclinical pharmacokinetics data provide evidence for the relevance of rat and dog for the safety studies. 
In these species and in humans, the parent compound is the dominating circulating form with minimal 
contribution of metabolites. 
Talazoparib derived radioactivity showed some retention in the pigmented uveal tract. This finding contributed 
to the need for a photosafety evaluation (see below). 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and in dogs, the main findings at subtherapeutic exposures included bone 
marrow hypocellularity with dose-dependent decrease in haematopoietic cells, depletion of lymphoid tissue in 
multiple organs and atrophy and/or degenerative changes in testes, epididymis and seminiferous tubules (see 
SmPC section 5.3).  
Haematological toxicity is the main clinical adverse event, and needs to be managed by appropriate monitoring 
and dose modifications (see discussion on clinical safety). 
Mechanistic investigation of bone marrow suppression associated with Talazoparib suggested that the 
talazoparib-induced hematological toxicities are due to induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation 
in bone marrow cells. 
Additional findings at higher exposures included dose-dependent increase in apoptosis/necrosis in the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, liver and ovary. Most of the histopathologic findings were generally reversible while 
the testes findings were partially reversible after 4 weeks of dosing cessation. These toxicity findings are 
consistent with the pharmacology of talazoparib and its tissue distribution  pattern (see SmPC section 5.3).  
Talazoparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test. Talazoparib was clastogenic in an in 
vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in an in vivo micronucleus 
assay in rats at exposures similar to clinically relevant doses. This clastogenicity is consistent with genomic 
instability resulting from the primary pharmacology of talazoparib, indicating the potential for genotoxicity in 
humans (see SmPC section 5.3). Talazoparib and may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to the foetus (see SmPC section 4.6). Women 
of childbearing potential should not become pregnant while receiving Talzenna and should not be pregnant at 
the beginning of treatment. A pregnancy test should be performed on all women of childbearing potential prior 
to treatment (see SmPC section 4.4). 
In accordance with ICH S9, carcinogenicity studies are not warranted for this indication. The mode of action and 
the positive findings in genotoxicity studies make it likely that talazoparib treatment is associated with an 
increased risk for secondary malignancies. 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 38/140 
  
  
  
In accordance with ICH S9, a study on fertility and early embryonic development is not warranted for this 
indication. The testicular findings in repeat dose toxicity studies are suggestive of a risk for male fertility.  
Section 4.6 of the SmPC reflects that Talzenna may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential (see also 
discussion on clinical safety). 
Talazoparib is a strong embryo-foetal toxicant. Severe embryofoetal lethality and malformations were observed 
in rat at a dose tolerated by the dam, and at an exposure far below clinical exposure. In particular, in the embryo 
foetal development study in rats, talazoparib resulted in embryo foetal death, foetal malformation (depressed 
eye bulge, small eye, split sternebrae, fused cervical vertebral arch) and structural variations in bones at a 
maternal systemic AUC24 exposure approximately 0.09-fold the relevant human exposure at the recommended 
dose (see SmPC section 5.3). Appropriate warnings and precautions about contraception have been reflected in 
section 4.4. and 4.6. of the SmPC (see also discussion on clinical safety). 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity is also adequately listed in the list of safety concerns as an important 
potential risk (see RMP). 
Talazoparib absorbs light in the visible region and retention in the pigmented uveal tract was observed in rats. 
An in vitro 3T3 assay demonstrated a photoxic potential. In an in vivo phototoxicity study in rats, there were no 
evidence for a phototoxic potential. In this study, the exposure was 0.34x clinical exposure (Cmax). Since higher 
doses are not readily tolerable, it is concluded that the phototoxicity potential is adequately addressed. 
Talazoparib PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and it is not a PBT substance as log Kow 
does not exceed 4.5. Considering the above data, Talazoparib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements 
(see SmPC section 6.6). Adequate warnings are also included in the package leaflet. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data package is considered adequate to support the marketing authorisation of talazoparib.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
Eight clinical studies were submitted (see Table 20). The single dose food effect study has been performed in 
healthy volunteers, whereas all other clinical pharmacology data were collected in patients with advanced 
cancer. There were also two ongoing studies, in hepatic impairment (Study No MDV3800-02) and in renal 
impairment (Study No MDV3800-01). 
A population PK analysis, an exposure-response (progression-free survival as well as haematological toxicity) as 
well as QTc modelling was also provided.  
A full in vitro package characterising in vitro metabolism, transport, protein binding as well as potential to inhibit 
or induce enzymes or transporters was also provided.  
Methods 
Plasma and urine concentrations of talazoparib were determined with LC-MS/MS methods and the 
pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with standard non-compartmental analysis. 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed, using data from the two phase I studies PRP-001 (rich 
sampling) and PRP-002 (rich sampling), the phase 2 study 673- 201 (sparse sampling) and the phase 3 study 
673-301 (sparse sampling). PK data from 490 patients who received dose levels from 0.25 to 2 mg once daily, 
were included in the final population pharmacokinetic analysis. A linear two-compartment model with first-order 
absorption and a lag time for absorption was used. Covariate effects included in the final model were age, race

and Clcrea on Cl/F, body weight on V2/F, food and formulation on ka and strong Pgp-inhibitors (PGPINH1) on F1. 
The parameter estimates of the final model is shown in Table 20. 
Table 17. Parameter estimates for the final population PK model 
Absorption  
Following oral administration of talazoparib, the median time to Cmax (Tmax) generally ranged from 1 to 2 
hours after single and multiple 1 mg oral dosing of talazoparib capsules in patients. The absolute bioavailability 
study has not been conducted in humans. However, based on urinary excretion data the absolute bioavailability 
is at least 41% with fraction absorbed of at least 69%. No significant effect of acid-reducing agents on 
talazoparib exposure is expected, given sufficient solubility of talazoparib at all pHs between 1 and 6.8. 
Twenty-eight percent (28%) of the patients in the pivotal study were taking acid-reducing agents, mainly proton 
pump inhibitors. 
Bioequivalence 
The two tablet strengths for marketing have not been formally compared in a PK study.  
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 43/140 
  
  
  
 
 
Food interaction 
Administration of a high-fat, high-calorie meal delayed the absorption of talazoparib relative to administration 
under overnight fasting conditions. The median t max was delayed with approximately 3 hours. The Cmax was 
approximately 46% lower under fed conditions compared to fasting conditions. The total plasma exposure 
(AUC0-t and AUC0-∞) was comparable following fasted and fed conditions. The excretion of unchanged 
talazoparib in urine following administration of a single 0.5 mg oral dose was similar under fed and fasting 
conditions. The plasma results from the food interaction study are presented below in Table 23, Table 24 and 
Figure 3.

Dose proportionality 
A dose-proportionality analysis was performed with multiple-dose data from both study PRP-001 and PRP-002. 
The estimated slope values for the Cmax and AUC24 were 1.06 (90% CI: 0.97, 1.15) and 0.92 (90% CI: 0.81, 
1.02), respectively thus indicating no major deviation from dose-proportionality in the dose range 0.025 to 2 
mg. 
Data from the single-dose part of the phase 1 study PRP-001 is shown in Figure 4, and the dose-proportionality 
analysis did not indicate deviations from dose-proportional increase in AUC with dose.

Distribution 
In the population PK analysis, the population mean apparent volume of distribution (Vss/F) of talazoparib was 
420 L.  
In vitro, talazoparib is approximately 74% bound to plasma proteins with no concentration dependence over the 
concentration range of 0.01 µM to 1 µM. 
The blood/plasma ratio was evaluated in human blood samples from the mass balance study MDV3800-03 and 
equal partitioning of 14C-Talazoparib was observed between the plasma and red blood cells compartments with 
a blood to plasma concentration ratio of 1.05. 
Elimination 
In vitro 
There was negligible turnover of talazoparib when incubated with human liver microsomes or hepatocytes. The 
percent of parent remaining at 120 min in human microsomes was 100%. Consistent with the metabolic stability 
in liver microsomes, there was no turnover of [14C]talazoparib in freshly isolated or cryopreserved human 
hepatocytes over 240 min incubations at 1 and 10 μM. 
In vivo 
In the pooled plasma samples for metabolic profiling from the mass balance study, talazoparib was the only 
detectable circulating radioactive component. 
No metabolites that individually represented more than 10% of the administered dose were recovered in the 
urine or faeces in the mass balance study. The percent of dose identified in urine and faeces is illustrated in 
Figure 5.  
Figure 5. Mean % of dose identified in urine and faeces following administration of 14C-talazoparib 
(Study MDV3800-03). 
Elimination 
The mean (±standard deviation) terminal plasma half-life of talazoparib was 90 (±58) hours and the population 
mean (inter-subject variability) apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 6.5 (31%) L/h in cancer patients. The 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 46/140 
  
  
  
 
 
 
results from the mass balance study showed that approximately 88% were recovered in excreta within 21 days. 
The mean cumulative recovery of 14C-radioactivity of all 6 patients given a single oral dose of [14C]talazoparib 
in urine was 68.7% (SD 8.59%), and in faeces 19.7% (SD 5.49%), see Figure 6. 
Figure 6. Mean (±SD) Cumulative Recovery of Radioactivity in Urine and Faeces Following 
Administration of 14C Talazoparib (Study MDV3800-03). 
The urinary excretion of unchanged talazoparib was the major route of elimination with a mean recovery in urine 
of 40.9% of the administered dose based on the liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS) data (Table 25). The geometric mean CLr of talazoparib was 3.44 L/hr (arithmetic mean 3.81 
L/hr).  
Table 20. Summary of Urine Talazoparib Pharmacokinetic Parameter Values (Study MDV3800-03). 
The applicant has made an assessment of the contribution of active renal clearance determined from the 
difference between the total renal clearance of 3.81 L/h, and the passive renal clearance of 1.95 L/h, estimated 
from the fraction of unbound talazoparib that is subjected to glomerular filtration (Fu,p x GFR = 0.26 x 7.5 L/h). 
Active renal clearance of talazoparib in humans was determined to be 1.86 L/h. This value is approximately 29% 
of the steady-state total apparent clearance in humans (6.37 L/h, PopPK) following a 1 mg/day, and suggests 
that talazoparib is both actively and passively cleared by the kidneys. 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 47/140 
  
  
  
 
 
The plasma pharmacokinetics of total radioactivity and talazoparib was characterised in the mass balance study 
MDV3800-03, see Table 26 and Table 27. 
Table 21. Summary of Talazoparib Pharmacokinetic Parameters- Plasma. 
Table 22. Summary of 14C Pharmacokinetic Parameters- Plasma. 
Geometric mean Cmax and AUC0–inf of unchanged talazoparib in plasma were approximately 70% and 60% of 
those for total 14C-radioactivity in plasma, respectively. The mean terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) was 
similar for plasma talazoparib and total 14C-radioactivity in plasma with values of 89.8 and 96.2 hours, 
respectively. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Talazoparib exposure generally increased proportionally with dose across the range of 0.025 mg to 2 mg after 
daily administration of multiple doses. Following repeated daily dosing of 1 mg talazoparib to patients, the 
geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and 
maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of talazoparib at steady-state was in the range of 126 (107) 
ng•hr/mL to 208 (37) ng•hr/mL and 11 (90) ng/mL to 19 (27) ng/mL, respectively. Following repeated daily 
dosing, plasma talazoparib concentrations reached steady-state within 2 to 3 weeks.  
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 48/140 
  
  
  
 
 
In studies PRP-001, PRP-002 and MDV3800-14 (QT-study), where multiple doses of 1 mg talazoparib was 
administered, the median accumulation ratio of talazoparib following repeated oral administration of 1 mg once 
daily was estimated to 2.33, 5.15 and 3.98, respectively.  
In study PRP-001 the average AUCinf after a single dose (196 ng•h/ml) was similar to the estimated average 
AUCΤ at day 35 (181 ng•h/ml), indicating no major time dependency in pharmacokinetics. In the same study, 
the estimated half-life was similar after a single dose (62 h) and multiple dosing (58 h) in the same study. 
Special populations 
The effect of gender, race, weight and age were evaluated in the popPK model.  
Impaired renal function 
Based on a population PK analysis that included 490 patients, where 132 patients had mild renal impairment (60 
mL/min ≤ CrCL < 90 mL/min), 33 patients had moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min ≤ CrCL < 60 mL/min), 
and 1 patient had severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min), talazoparib CL/F was decreased by 14% and 
37% in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively, when compared to patients with normal 
renal function (CrCL ≥ 90 mL/min).  
Impaired hepatic function 
Based on a population PK analysis that included 490 patients, where 118 patients had mild hepatic impairment 
(total bilirubin ≤ 1.0 × ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST), mild hepatic 
impairment had no effect on the PK of talazoparib. The PK of talazoparib have not been studied in patients with 
moderate (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3.0 × ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3.0 × 
ULN and any AST). 
Other special populations 
Age, sex, and body weight 
A population PK analysis was conducted using data from 490 patients with cancer to evaluate the impact of age 
(ranging from 18 to 88 years), sex (53 males and 437 females), and body weight (ranging from 35.7 kg to 
162 kg) on the PK of talazoparib. The results have shown that age, sex, and body weight had no clinically 
relevant effect on the PK of talazoparib.

Race 
Based on a population PK analysis that included 490 patients, where 41 patients were Asian and 449 patients 
were Non-Asian (361 White, 16 Black, 9 Others, and 63 Not reported), talazoparib CL/F was higher in Asian 
patients compared to Non-Asian patients, corresponding to 19% lower exposure (AUC) in Asian patients. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
Enzyme and transporter inhibitory potential 
In vitro CYP inhibition (Study BMN673-14-004) 
The ability of talazoparib to inhibit the catalytic activity of 7 major human CYP enzymes was evaluated in NADPH 
supplemented pooled human liver microsomes (HLM) with and without preincubation and specific CYP probe 
substrates. Specific inhibitors were used as positive controls. Results showed that talazoparib did not inhibit 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 up to the highest concentration of 10 μM, 
therefore the inhibitory concentration at 50% of the maximum value (IC50) values for CYP inhibition were 
estimated to be >10 μM, see Table 30. In addition, talazoparib did not show time-dependent inhibition (TDI) or 
metabolism-dependent inhibition (MDI) against these evaluated CYPs in HLM.

Table 25: Inhibition of CYP enzymes 
In vitro UGT inhibition (Study PF-06944076_18Aug17_035822) 
The potential of talazoparib to inhibit the catalytic activity of 6 major human UGT enzymes was evaluated in 
UDPGA supplemented pooled human liver microsomes with and without 2% BSA and specific UGT probe 
substrates. Results showed that talazoparib did not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, 
and/or UGT2B15 up to the highest concentration of 10 μM, regardless of the presence of BSA, therefore the IC50 
values were estimated to be >10 μM, see Table 31. 
Table 26: Inhibition of UGT enzymes 
In vitro transporter inhibition (Studies BMN673-13-070 and PF-06944076_19Oct17_051609) 
The potential for talazoparib to inhibit various intestinal, hepatic and renal transporters were evaluated in vitro. 
Overall, based on the in vitro results, talazoparib showed a low potential to cause DDI by inhibiting P-gp and 
BCRP both intestinally and systemically or inhibiting OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, BSEP, 
MATE1 and MATE2-K systemically at clinically relevant concentrations, see Table 32.

In vitro evaluation of the induction potential 
In vitro CYP induction (Study BMN673-14-003) 
The potential of talazoparib to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 mRNA expression and enzymatic activities 
were investigated in vitro in 3 different lots of cryopreserved human hepatocytes cultures with talazoparib 
concentrations ranging from 0.003 to 10 µM. The positive controls for induction were omeprazole (50 μM) for 
CYP1A2, phenobarbital (750 μM) for CYP2B6, and rifampin (20 μM) for CYP3A4, while flumazenil (25 μM) was 
used as a negative control. Following treatment for 3 days with talazoparib, there was little or no change in the 
hepatocyte cell morphology with talazoparib concentrations up to 10 μM, and little or no release of lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) as a measure of cell toxicity. Talazoparib did not cause induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or 
CYP3A4 mRNA levels and enzymatic activities at concentration up to 3 μM, see Table 33. However, at 10 µM, a 
greater than 2-fold change was seen in CYP2B6 mRNA levels for one of three lots of hepatocytes (7% of positive 
control) and greater than 2-fold change in CYP3A4 mRNA levels for two of three lots of hepatocytes (13% and 
39% of positive control, respectively), suggesting that talazoparib may have induced these isoforms in vitro. No 
increase in enzymatic activity was seen at 10 µM for any isoform, except for CYP3A4/5 activity in one lot of 
hepatocytes.

Table 28: Induction of CYP enzymes (Study BMN673-14-003) 
In vivo 
A drug-drug interaction study (Study No MDV3800-04) between a single dose talazoparib and multiple doses of 
itraconazole (Pgp inhibitor) and rifampicin (used as Pgp inducer) was performed. Coadministration of multiple 
daily doses of itraconazole 100 mg twice daily and a single 0.5 mg talazoparib dose increased the AUCinf and 
Cmax of talazoparib by approximately 56% (ratio 90% CI 1.38-1.77) and 40% (ratio 90% CI 1.13-1.73), 
respectively, relative to a single 0.5 mg talazoparib dose administered alone. Multiple daily doses of rifampicin 
600 mg and a single 1 mg talazoparib dose increased talazoparib Cmax by approximately 37% (ratio 90% CI 
1.03-1.81); whereas, AUCinf was not affected ratio (90% CI 0.94-1.11) relative to a single 1 mg talazoparib 
dose administered alone. 
The dataset for the population pharmacokinetics analysis included data from 18 patients taking strong Pgp 
inhibitors, and a covariate effect of strong Pgp inhibitors on Cl/F was detected. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) 
analysis has also shown that concomitant use of strong P-gp inhibitors increased talazoparib exposure by 45%, 
relative to talazoparib given alone. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Talazoparib is an inhibitor of PARP enzymes, PARP1, and PARP2. PARP enzymes are involved in cellular DNA 
damage response signalling pathways such as DNA repair, gene transcription, and cell death. PARP inhibitors 
(PARPi) exert cytotoxic effects on cancer cells by 2 mechanisms, inhibition of PARP catalytic activity and by PARP 
trapping, whereby PARP protein bound to a PARPi does not readily dissociate from a DNA lesion, thus preventing 
DNA repair, replication, and transcription and ultimately apoptosis and/or cell death. Treatment of cancer cell 
lines that are harbouring defects in DNA repair genes with talazoparib single agent leads to increased levels of 
γH2AX, a marker of double stranded DNA breaks, and results in decreased cell proliferation and increased 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 53/140 
  
  
  
 
apoptosis. Talazoparib anti-tumour activity was also observed in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) BRCA 
mutant breast cancer model where the patient was previously treated with a platinum-based regimen. In this 
PDX model talazoparib decreased tumour growth and increased γH2AX level and apoptosis in the tumours (see 
SmPC section 5.1).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Exposure-response modelling 
AEs associated with dose modifications (dose reductions or interruption) were reported in 62% of the patients at 
1 mg/day. Most common were anaemia (33%), neutropenia (16%) or thrombocytopenia (13%). In patients 
who received 1 mg once daily starting dose, one dose reduction (to 0.75 mg) was performed in 24% of the 
patients and two reductions (to 0.5 mg) in 16%. Permanent drug discontinuation due to AEs was done in 3.6% 
of the patients. 
Exposure-response analysis were evaluated for efficacy and safety for EMBRACA (pivotal phase III; 301) and 
ABRAZO (phase 2; 201). Time-to-event models utilizing Cox proportional hazard methodology were used to 
address the relationship between talazoparib exposure and progression-free survival (PFS) and the safety 
endpoints anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. A multivariate analysis was used to estimate the effect 
of talazoparib exposure adjusting for other covariates. The exposure metrics evaluated was Cavg,t, defined as 
the average daily dose intensity up to the time of each event in the study, divided by individual apparent 
talazoparib clearance from the popPK model. 
In the univariate efficacy analysis, several disease and treatment factors were significantly associated with PFS. 
In subsequent steps, several covariates were removed and in the final model baseline lactate dehydrogenase, 
visceral disease status and disease free interval were included together with Cavgt (hazard ratio 0.88, CI 
0.82-0.95). Capsule strength was not significant. 
In the exposure-toxicity modelling, data from both study 201 and 301 were modelled together. The same 
procedure as in the exposure-PFS modelling was applied. In the final cox proportional hazards models for 
anaemia and thrombocytopenia, Cavgt of talazoparib was found to be a significant covariate (hazard ratio 1.30 
and 1.16, respectively) whereas talazoparib concentration was not a significant predictor of neutropenia. 
When comparing drug exposure in patients with and without a toxic event on liver or kidney, no obvious 
difference was observed. The geometric mean of talazoparib within-subject talazoparib Ctrough in patients with 
renal toxicity events (3.93 ng/mL [38%]; n=15) was similar to and within the range of that in patients without 
renal toxicity (3.54 ng/mL [63%]; n=207). In addition, the geometric mean of talazoparib within-subject 
talazoparib Ctrough in patients with hepatotoxicity events (4.02 ng/mL [49%)]; n=18) was similar to and within 
the range of that in patients without hepatotoxicity (3.53 ng/mL [63%]; n=204). 
Modelling of the effect on cardiac electrophysiology 
The effect of talazoparib on cardiac repolarisation was evaluated using time-matched electrocardiograms 
(ECGs) in assessing the relationship between the change of the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) from 
baseline and the corresponding plasma talazoparib concentrations in 37 patients with advanced solid tumours 
receiving 1 mg talazoparib QD. The primary aim of the study was to perform a concentration-response analysis 
to examine the relationship between the change from baseline in QTcF interval, to classify the risk for cardiac 
effects of the drug. Time-matched change from baseline in QTcF was also addressed. 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 54/140 
  
  
  
The study did not suggest a clinically relevant effect of talazoparib on QT interval. The slopes (95% CI) of 
QTcF-concentration and QTcB-concentration relationships were -0.14 (-0.78 to 0.50) and -0.24 (-0.88 to 0.41) 
msec/ng/mL, respectively. These slopes were not statistically different from 0 (p-values were 0.67 and 0.47 for 
QTcF and QTcB, respectively). At the mean steady-state talazoparib Cmax (17.2 ng/mL), the predicted change 
from baseline value was 2.44 msec with a 1- sided upper 95% CI of 4.64 msec for QTcF, and was 2.09 msec with 
a 1-sided upper 95% CI of 4.59 msec for QTcB. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has performed a limited clinical pharmacology program to describe the pharmacokinetics and 
elimination of talazoparib, and to identify special populations or drug-drug interactions with risks for altered 
drug exposure.   
It appears difficult to define a therapeutic window of talazoparib. Only one dose has been tested and it has been 
chosen with an MTD principle. The exposure-response analyses performed did also not appear useful to define 
a therapeutic window. This difficulty is in general expected when modelling an endpoint like PFS when data is 
limited to a single initial dose level and dose adjustments are made on the basis of tolerability.  
A population PK model has been developed to describe the PK of talazoparib in the clinical program, and to 
estimate the effect of moderate renal impairment on drug exposure. Several limitations with the model were 
identified, but it was concluded that the model describes the present data sufficiently well and can be used to get 
a reasonable estimation of the effect of renal impairment. 
Talazoparib appears to have a relatively high absorption. Food intake decreased the rate but not the extent of 
talazoparib absorption. Following a single oral dose of talazoparib with high-fat, high-calorie food 
(approximately 827 calories, 57% fat), the mean Cmax of talazoparib was decreased by approximately 46%, 
the median Tmax was delayed from 1 to 4 hours, while the AUCinf was not affected. Based on these results, 
Talzenna can be administered with or without food (see section 4.2). 
Two dose strengths will be marketed, 0.25 and 1 mg, and there is no relative bioavailability study between the 
strengths. They are however both used in the pivotal phase III trial, and resulted in similar trough 
concentrations, therefore the lack of comparative bioavailability data is considered acceptable.  
A mass balance study was submitted. The total recovery was somewhat low (70-75%) in two of the patients but 
exceeds 90% in the remaining four, and the recovery and overall study is considered acceptable. A discrepancy 
was noted between the results from the radioactivity profiling data and the LC-MS/MS analysis, but it was 
concluded that this difference was not due to any unidentified metabolites but likely due to methodological 
differences. Data from the LC-MS/MS measurement was considered more reliable and included in the SmPC.  
Talazoparib undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism in humans. Following oral administration of a single 1 mg 
dose of [14C]talazoparib to humans, no major circulating metabolites were identified in plasma, and talazoparib 
was the only circulating drug-derived entity identified. No metabolites that individually represented more than 
10% of the administered dose were recovered in the urine or faeces (see SmPC section 5.2).. 
Renal elimination of unchanged drug (passive filtration and active secretion) is the major route of talazoparib 
elimination. P-gp is likely involved in talazoparib active renal secretion. Excretion of unchanged talazoparib in 
urine was the major route of elimination accounting for 55% of the administered dose, while unchanged 
talazoparib recovered in the faeces accounted for 14%.

Renal impairment impacts talazoparib clearance. A dedicated renal impairment study (Study MDV3800-01) is 
ongoing and it is agreed that no dose recommendations can currently be made for patients with severe renal 
impairment, as Talzenna has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) or 
patients requiring haemodialysis and insufficient data are available to estimate the impact of severe renal 
impairment on talazoparib CL/F in this patient population. A markedly decreased talazoparib clearance is 
expected in this subpopulation. Talzenna is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment 
or requiring haemodialysis. Talzenna may only be used in patients with severe renal impairment if the benefit 
outweighs the potential risk, and the patient should be carefully monitored for renal function and adverse events 
(see section 5.2). Study MDV3800-01 is a category 3 in the RMP.  
The population PK analysis has been used to estimate an effect of mild and moderate renal impairment on 
talazoparib clearance, and the estimates (Cl/F decreased 14% in mild RI and 37% in moderate RI) appear 
reasonable. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild renal impairment (60 mL/min ≤ creatinine 
clearance [CrCl] < 90 mL/min). 
Given that patients in phase III suffering from moderate renal impairment who were given a dose of 1 mg 
appeared to have a higher incidence of haematological toxicity, a modest starting dose reduction in these 
patients appears reasonable. This group is known to have a higher average plasma exposure to talazoparib 
(~50% predicted by the population PK analysis). The proposed dose adjustment in patients with moderate renal 
impairment (-25%) is predicted to result on average in 19% higher exposure levels than in patients with normal 
renal function. As the 0.75 mg dose is not predicted to result in a lower exposure than given a 1 mg to normal 
renal function patients, this dose adjustment is considered appropriate from a pharmacokinetic point of view. 
Therefore, for patients with moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 60 mL/min), the recommended 
starting dose of Talzenna is 0.75 mg once daily.  
Given that active renal secretion appears to be involved in Talzenna elimination, an investigation of potential 
transport proteins involved was performed. Talazoparib is an in vitro substrate for Pgp and BCRP, but not OAT1, 
OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE-2K. Given the high abundancy of Pgp in the kidney, it is agreed that Pgp is likely 
to contribute to the active renal secretion of talazoparib.  
The result from the interaction study indicates that the main effect of Pgp inhibition caused by itraconazol is 
inhibition of Pgp in the gastrointestinal tract, causing increased bioavailability. A somewhat longer half-life was 
however also observed after co-administration of itraconazol, which may be a sign of inhibition of renal 
secretion. In line with the above discussion on dose adjustments in patients with moderate renal impairment, 
Pgp inhibitors, resulting in a similar increase in talazoparib exposure, may also be assumed to increase the risk 
of toxicity and thus warrant a similar dose reduction. Section 4.2 of the SmPC reflects that strong inhibitors of 
P-gp may lead to increased talazoparib exposure. Concomitant use of strong P-gp inhibitors (including but not 
limited to amiodarone, carvedilol, clarithromycin, cobicistat, darunavir, dronedarone, erythromycin, indinavir, 
itraconazole, ketoconazole, lapatinib, lopinavir, propafenone, quinidine, ranolazine, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telaprevir, tipranavir, and verapamil) during treatment with talazoparib should be avoided. Co-administration 
should only be considered after careful evaluation of the potential benefits and risks. If coadministration with a 
strong P gp inhibitor is unavoidable, the Talzenna dose should be reduced to 0.75 mg once daily. When the 
strong P-gp inhibitor is discontinued, the Talzenna dose should be increased (after 3–5 half lives of the P-gp 
inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong P gp inhibitor (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.5).  
In addition to renal elimination, limited metabolism as well as possibly limited secretion into faeces contributes 
to the elimination of talazoparib. The applicant describes an ongoing study in subjects with different degrees of 
hepatic impairment. This is appreciated, but given that the role of hepatic elimination in the clearance of 
talazoparib appears limited, this study is not considered a category 3 study but is recommended to be 
EMA/270498/2019

submitted. Patients with mild hepatic impairment have been included in the pivotal trial and popPK analysis does 
not suggest an effect on PK. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment 
(total bilirubin ≤ 1 × upper limit of normal [ULN] and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN, or total bilirubin 
> 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST). Talzenna has not been studied in patients with moderate (total bilirubin > 1.5 
to 3.0 × ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3.0 × ULN and any AST) (see SmPC 
sections 4.2 and 5.2). Talzenna may only be used in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment if the 
benefit outweighs the potential risk, and the patient should be carefully monitored for hepatic function and 
adverse events.  
Data for other special populations are only available through the popPK model, which has its limitations, but it 
appears unlikely that gender, race, weight or age would have a clinically significant effect on talazoparib 
pharmacokinetics apart from the effect through renal function. No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly (≥ 65 
years of age) patients (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). Pharmacokinetics of talazoparib have not been 
evaluated in patients < 18 years of age (see SmPC section 4.2). 
The in vitro results show that talazoparib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP but not of any other enzymes or 
transporters. Regarding being a perpetrator on CYP-enzymes, no inhibition (neither direct or time-dependent or 
metabolism-dependent inhibition) was seen for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and 
CYP3A4/5 up to the highest concentration of 10 μM talazoparib and IC50 values were reported as >10µM.   
No induction was seen for CYP1A2 in the investigated concentration range 0.003 to 10 µM. For CYP2B6 and 
CYP3A4 no induction was seen in the concentration range 0.003 to 3 µM. However at 10 µM, a greater than 
two-fold change was seen in CYP2B6 mRNA and CYP3A4 mRNA in one of three lots and two of three lots of 
hepatocytes, respectively. Considering the cut-offs used for evaluation of interaction potential in vivo, the 
concentrations relevant for induction of systemically (50xCmax,u) and intestinally (0.1xDose/250 mL) 
expressed enzymes are lower than 3 µM and the potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interaction due to 
induction are considered low. 
The effect of BCRP inhibitors on PK of talazoparib has not been studied in vivo. Co-administration of talazoparib 
with BCRP inhibitors may increase talazoparib exposure. Concomitant use of strong BCRP inhibitors (including 
but not limited to curcumin and cyclosporine) should be avoided. If co administration of strong BCRP inhibitors 
cannot be avoided, patient should be monitored for potential increased adverse reactions. 
In vitro results also indicated that talazoparib did not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7 or 
UGT2B15 up to the highest concentration of 10 μM and IC50 values were estimated to >10µM. 
Population PK analysis indicates that co-administration of acid-reducing agents including proton pump inhibitors 
and histamine receptor 2 antagonists (H2RA), or other acid reducing agents had no significant impact on the 
absorption of talazoparib. 
Overall, the in vitro DDI studies appear sufficient and of acceptable quality, and do not indicate any inhibiting or 
inducing effects of talazoparib on enzymes or transporters.  
Given that hormonal contraceptives are not recommended to women with breast cancer, the lack of DDI data 
with hormonal contraceptives is acceptable. This is adequately reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Talazoparib has a pH dependent solubility, but as the solubility of the clinical dose is high at all pHs tested 
between 1.2 and 6.8, and the fraction absorbed is high and independent of food intake, a pharmacokinetic 
interaction with acid reducing agents appears unlikely.  
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 57/140 
  
  
  
Data from a drug-drug interaction study in patients with advanced solid tumours indicated that 
co-administration of single 1 mg talazoparib dose with multiple daily doses of a P-gp inducer, rifampin 600 mg, 
with rifampin co-administered 30 minutes before talazoparib on the day of talazoparib dosing, increased 
talazoparib Cmax by approximately 37% whereas AUCinf was not affected relative to a single 1 mg talazoparib 
dose administered alone. An increase in Cmax is not an expected result of P-gp induction, rather an indication 
of inhibition. This is probably the net effect of both P-gp induction and inhibition by rifampin under the tested 
conditions in the drug-drug interaction study. No talazoparib dose adjustments are required when co 
administered with rifampin. However, the effect of other P-gp inducers on talazoparib exposure has not been 
studied. Other P-gp inducers (including but not limited to carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John’s wort) may 
decrease talazoparib exposure. 
Deleterious gBRCA mutations increases the risk for ovarian and breast cancer and to a clearly lesser degree for 
some other solid tumours. The relationship between different gBRCA1 and 2 mutations, need for loss of 
heterozygosity (LOH) or haplotype insufficiency and homologous repair deficiency and tumour phenotype is still 
unclear. gBRCA1 is more related to hormone receptor negative tumours, basal phenotype and younger age, 
while the reverse is true for gBRCA2.  Talazoparib is an inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2, which play important roles 
in DNA repair. It is also a lower-potency inhibitor of PARP3, tankyrase 1 (TNKS1, PARP5a), and tankyrase 2 
(TNKS2, PARP5b). PARP inhibitors exert cytotoxic effects by at least 2 mechanisms: inhibition of PARP catalytic 
activity and PARP trapping. 
The rationale for using PARP inhibitors for the treatment of breast cancer was originally based on the sensitivity 
of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutant tumour cells. After the identification of synthetic lethality, however, it was found 
that defects in other DNA repair genes commonly found in human cancers also conferred PARPi sensitivity. 
These observations are considered to support the “BRCAness” hypothesis, i.e. that a subset of cancers in 
patients without BRCA1/2 mutations display histopathological, molecular and clinical similarities, including drug 
sensitive phenotypes, with BRCA cancers. 
Talazoparib did not have a clinically relevant effect on QTc prolongation at the maximum clinically recommended 
dose of 1 mg once daily (see SmPC section 5.1).  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Available clinical pharmacology data are considered to support the marketing authorisation of Talzenna. Further 
data in special populations, in particular in patients with renal impairment, are expected to be provided 
post-authorisation to further characterise the pharmacokinetic profiled of talazoparib (see RMP).  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
PRP-001 
This was a two-part, first in human study; Part 1 was a standard MTD study, part 2 a dose expansion cohort 
aiming at further defining RPIID. First patient treated Jan 2011, completion date Mar 2015. 
Part 1 enrolled patients with solid tumours without available standard therapy. Altogether 39 patients received 
talazoparib 0.025 to 1.1 mg /day in cohorts of 3 to 6 individuals. Three patients each received talazoparib at 1 
of the first 5 doses (0.025, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, or 0.40 mg/day), and 6 patients each received talazoparib at 1 of 
the next 4 doses (0.60, 0.90, 1.0, and 1.1 mg/day).  
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 58/140 
  
  
  
PARP activity was assayed in PBMC and showed inhibition (>2 fold lower than baseline) in 3/3 patients at a dose 
of 0.20 mg/day and 2/6 at 1.1 mg/day and 4/6 at 1.0 mg/day. Technical issues contributed.    
Thrombocytopenia was declared dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and was reported by 2/6 at 1.1 mg/day. 1.0 mg/day 
was therefore used as starting dose in part II.    
A total of 71 patients received talazoparib 1.0 mg/day in part 2. The median relative dose intensity across all 
cancer types was 97.2%, and the median daily dose received was 0.96 mg.

The protocol-specific physician’s choice treatment was to be determined prior to randomization for each 
individual subject. Talzenna 1 mg capsules once daily or chemotherapy at standard doses were given until 
progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Options for PCT´s included one of the following single-agent chemotherapies: 
•  Capecitabine: 1250 mg/m2, oral, twice daily from Day 1 through 14 of 21-day cycles, 30 minutes after 
meal. 
• 
Eribulin mesylate: 1.4 mg/m2 (equivalent to eribulin 1.23 mg/m2), infusion over 2-5 minutes, Days 1 
and 8 of 21-day cycles 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 62/140 
  
  
  
•  Gemcitabine: 1250 mg/m2, infusion over 30 minutes, Day 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles 
•  Vinorelbine: 30 mg/m2, weekly infusion over 6-10 minutes, Day 1, 8, and 15 of 21-day cycles 
Dose selection and dose modifications and reductions for PCT´s were to occur per the package insert and 
institutional practice unless institution dose and regimen guidelines differed in which case the site may utilize 
institution guidelines. 
Talazoparib was administered as a single agent orally daily for 21 days in repeated 21-day cycles at 1.0 mg/day 
with provision for dose reductions to 0.75 mg/day and 0.5 mg/day (or lower) in case of toxicity.  
Table 31: Talazoparib Dose Modifications Based on Haematologic or Non-haematologic Toxicity 
Toxicity 
Liver test abnormalities 
Recommended Dose Modification 
Dose may have been reduced or interrupted for Grade 2 AST or ALT 
values, depending on the liver test values at screening. 
Grade 1 or 2 toxicity (other 
than liver test abnormalities) 
Grade 3 nonhematologic 
toxicity (other than liver test 
abnormalities) 
Grade 3 hematologic toxicity 
No requirement for dosing interruption or reduction. 
For Grade 2 toxicities persisting ≥7 days, the dose could be reduced to 
the next lower dose (e.g., from 1.0 mg/day to 0.75 mg/day) at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
Daily dosing was to be interrupted for Grade 3 AEs, considered related 
to talazoparib.  Study drug could resume at the next lower dose when 
the toxicity resolved to Grade 1 or baseline. 
Supportive care could be implemented as appropriate (eg, antiemetics, 
antidiarrheal agents). 
Daily dosing was to be interrupted for Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities 
known to be associated with talazoparib as per the talazoparib IB. 
Study drug could resume at the next lower dose when the toxicity 
resolved to Grade 1 or met criteria for study entry.  Supportive care 
could be implemented as appropriate (eg, growth factor support, blood 
products). 
Grade 4 nonhematologic 
toxicity (other than liver test 
abnormalities) 
Daily dosing was to be interrupted for Grade 4 AEs (regardless of 
relationship to talazoparib).  Study drug could resume at a lower dose 
(1-2 dose level decrease) when toxicity resolved to Grade 1 or baseline. 
Supportive care could be implemented as appropriate (eg, antiemetics, 
antidiarrheal agents). 
Grade 4 hematologic toxicity 
Daily dosing was to be interrupted for Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities 
(regardless of relationship to talazoparib). Study drug must resume at a 
lower dose (1-2 dose level decrease as per investigator’s decision) 
when the toxicity resolved to Grade 1 or met criteria for study entry. 
Supportive care could be implemented as appropriate (eg, growth factor 
support, blood products). 
Objectives 
The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of continued administration of 
talazoparib monotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic gBRCA mutated, HER2 negative breast cancer, 
following disease progression on prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
The primary efficacy objective of the study was to compare PFS of patients treated with talazoparib as a 
monotherapy relative to those treated with protocol-specific physician’s choice treatment (PCT´s). 
Secondary objectives of the study were the assessment of: 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 63/140 
  
  
  
 
 
 
•  Objective response rate (ORR) 
•  Overall survival (OS) 
•  Safety of talazoparib 
• 
Pharmacokinetics of talazoparib 
Exploratory objectives were the following: 
•  Duration of response (DOR) for objective responders 
•  Quality of life for all enrolled subjects (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
[EORTC] Quality of Life Questionnaire [QLC-C30]/ EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire – Breast Cancer 
Module [QLQ-BR23]) 
•  Research assessments related to blood and tumour sampling that includes characterization of tumour 
sensitivity and resistance to talazoparib. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: 
•  Radiographic PFS 
Primary efficacy endpoint was progression free survival (PFS), defined as time from randomization until the date 
of radiologic progressive disease per modified RECIST 1.1, as determined by central IRF assessment, or death 
due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Radiographic disease assessment (CT and/or MRI) were performed 
within 28 days prior to randomization and patients received radiographic disease assessment every two 21-day 
cycles or 6 weeks (± 7 days) from the date of randomization for 30 weeks. Thereafter, imaging assessments 
were performed every 9 weeks (± 7 days) until radiographic progressive disease as determined by the IRF or the 
time of initiation of a new anti-neoplastic therapy. 
Clinical disease progression was verified by radiographic imaging as determined by the IRF before discontinuing 
study treatment (or the patient was not considered to have a progressive disease event for the purposes of the 
analysis). Imaging assessments continued according to the schedule of assessments until radiographic 
progression was observed by the IRF, unless the patient withdrew consent or initiated a new anti-neoplastic 
therapy. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
•  ORR 
•  OS 
•  Safety 
o  The incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events 
o  Change in clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry and hematology) 
o  Change in vital signs 
o  Concomitant medication use 
• 
PK of talazoparib 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 64/140 
  
  
  
The secondary efficacy measures included OS and ORR (RECIST v.1.1 with modifications) as assessed by the 
investigator. Confirmation of objective response (CR or PR) was not required. The ORR was defined as the 
proportion of patients with a CR or PR as defined by the modified RECIST 1.1 in the intent-to-treat (ITT) with 
measurable disease population by investigator. Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to 
death due to any cause. 
A population PK modelling approach was used to estimate individual values of apparent clearance 
(CL/F) and central volume of distribution (Vc/F). Individual CL/F estimates were used to estimate individual area 
under the concentration time curve over a dosing interval (AUCτ). Blood samples were collected on Day 1 of 
Cycles 1 through 4 for patients randomly assigned to talazoparib. 
Exploratory Endpoints: 
•  DOR 
• 
• 
Time to End of First Poststudy Therapy 
EORTC QLQ-C30/EORTC QLQ-BR23 QOL measures 
•  Research assessments related to blood and tumour sampling that includes characterization of tumour 
sensitivity and resistance to talazoparib 
DOR was defined as the time from first radiographic documentation of objective response (CR or PR) until 
radiographic disease progression by RECIST 1.1 based on investigator assessment, or to death due to any 
cause, whichever occurred first.  
The time to end of first post-study therapy was defined as the time from randomization to the end date of the 
first post-study antineoplastic therapy after the first documented disease progression by investigator 
assessment while on study treatment (talazoparib or PCT). 
Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) were assessed as an exploratory efficacy endpoint using the EORTC QLQ-C30 
and EORTC QLQ-BR23 at baseline, Day 1 of each cycle, and at the end of treatment. 
An analysis of TTD in Global Health Status/QoL was conducted based on survival analysis methods. TTD in Global 
Health Status/QoL was defined as the time from randomization to the first observation with a ≥10 point 
decrease and no subsequent observations with a <10 point decrease from baseline. 
Sample size 
For PFS, based on a 2:1 randomization allocation ratio (talazoparib : physician’s choice), a total of 288 PFS 
events were considered necessary to provide 90% power for a 2-sided log-rank test at a 0.05 significance level 
to detect a hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67. Assuming an exponential distribution of PFS, this should correspond to an 
increase in median PFS from 4.6 months in control arm to 6.9 months in active arm (from 20 to 30 weeks; a 50% 
increase in median PFS). Based on the study design, the minimum observed effect that should result in 
statistical significance for PFS was an 28% improvement in median PFS (HR = 0.78), from 4.6 to 5.9 months 
(from 20 to 25.6 weeks). Up to 429 patients were planned to be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups 
(talazoparib or PCT) in a 2:1 ratio and followed to observe the targeted number of 288 PFS events.  
For OS, approximately 321 death events would provide 80% power for a 2-sided log-rank test at an overall 0.05 
significance level to detect a HR = 0.72. Assuming an exponential distribution of OS, this would correspond to an 
increase in median OS from 20 months in control arm to 27.8 months in active arm.

Randomisation 
Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to talazoparib or PCT.  Randomization was central  and stratified as 
follows: 
•  Number of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced and/or metastatic disease 
(0 vs 1, 2, or 3). 
•  TNBC (ER-negative, PgR-negative, HER2-negative) status based on most recent biopsy (yes vs 
no). 
•  History of CNS metastases (yes vs no). 
For patients assigned to PCT, the protocol-specified PCT was to be  determined prior to randomization. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
Primary Efficacy Analysis: 
The primary efficacy analysis was the comparison of PFS in subjects treated with talazoparib versus treatments 
of protocol-specific physician’s choice. The primary analysis was to be conducted when at least 288 PFS events 
had been observed, and performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomized 
subjects. The primary analysis was to include only radiographic progression events as determined by the central 
IRF per RECIST v.1.1 with modifications and deaths. Clinical deterioration or radiographic progression 
determined by investigators were not to be considered progression events for the primary analysis. 
A stratified log-rank 2-sided test with a 0.05 level of significance was used to compare treatment groups. The 
stratification factors were the same as used to stratify the randomization schedule as documented in the 
interactive voice and Web response system (IXRS). The median PFS and the associated 95% confidence interval 
(CI) for each treatment arm were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard ratio (HR=λ 
talazoparib/ λ control) and the associated 95% CI were estimated using a Cox regression model with treatment 
group as the only main effect and stratifying by the same stratification factors as were used for the log-rank test. 
An unstratified HR and the associated 95% CI were presented. If the p-value for the stratified log-rank test was 
statistically significant (< 0.05, two-sided) and the observed HR (λ talazoparib/ λ control) was < 1, the null 
hypothesis of no difference in PFS was to be rejected and it was to be inferred that PFS was statistically 
prolonged in the group receiving talazoparib compared with the group receiving protocol-specific physician’s 
choice of therapy. 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis: 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included ORR and OS. To maintain experiment-wise 2-sided type I error at 0.05, 
a detailed multiplicity adjusted inferential procedure for the primary and secondary efficacy analysis for OS was 
provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The primary analysis of ORR was to be performed among the 
subjects with baseline measurable disease in the ITT population using Investigator assessment. In the analysis 
of ORR, patients who did not have any post-baseline adequate tumour assessments were to be counted as 
non-responders. Formal hypothesis testing of ORR was performed using the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
test. The stratification factors were the same used to stratify the randomization schedule as documented in the 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 66/140 
  
  
  
 
IXRS. The best overall response (BOR) for objective responders was reported separately for the non-measurable 
disease patients.  
OS was to be censored at the date the patient was last known to be alive on or before the data cut-off date. An 
interim analysis of OS was conducted at a 0.0001 significance level on the ITT population at the time of the 
primary analysis of PFS. The median OS was estimated for each treatment group using the Kaplan-Meier method 
and the 95% CIs was calculated using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method. The HR and the 95% CI was estimated 
using a stratified Cox regression model. No formal hypothesis testing was performed for interim OS.  
The final analysis of OS is planned when approximately 321 deaths occur using the stratified 2-sided log-rank 
test using the ITT population. The stratification factors were the same used to stratify the randomization 
schedule as documented in the IXRS. At the final OS analysis, median OS will be estimated for each treatment 
group using the Kaplan-Meier method and the 95% CIs will be calculated. The HR will be estimated using a 
stratified Cox regression model with treatment group as the only main effect. An un-stratified log-rank test, a 
stratified Wilcoxon’s rank sum test, and the HR and 95% CI from an un-stratified Cox regression model will be 
presented as sensitivity analyses. 
Exploratory analysis: 
PRO: No multiplicity adjustments were considered for the PRO analyses. PRO questionnaire completion rates 
were reported for the ITT population. All other analyses were performed using the PRO-evaluable population, 
defined as all patients who received any study drug and completed the PRO questionnaire at baseline and at 
least 1 visit post-baseline.  
Multiplicity Adjustment for Efficacy Analyses 
To maintain the overall 2-sided type I error rate at 0.05, the primary and secondary efficacy analyses for OS 
were protected under a multiplicity adjustment schema using gate-keeping methodology. The details of the 
3-step testing approach was as follows: 
Step 1: Compare PFS for talazoparib versus physician’s choice when approximately 288 PFS events by IRF 
occur. Compute the p-value for the PFS comparison. If the p-value is < 0.05 and the HR (λtalazoparib/ 
λphysician’s choice) is < 1, declare statistical significance for PFS with talazoparib versus physician’s choice and 
proceed to step 2. If the statistical significance for PFS cannot be declared, the formal hypothesis tests for OS 
will not be performed. 
Step 2: At the time of the PFS analysis (targeted 288 PFS events), compare OS for talazoparib versus physician’s 
choice as follows: Conduct an interim analysis of OS at a 0.0001 significance level using Haybittle-Peto boundary 
(Haybittle, 1971; Peto et al, 1976). Descriptive summaries including the HR and its 95% CIs will be presented 
for each treatment group. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed for interim OS. Final OS analysis will 
be performed in Step 3. 
Step 3: At the final analysis of OS (targeted 321 death events), compare OS for talazoparib versus physician’s 
choice as follows: If the result of the test specified in step 1 is statistically significant, conduct the OS analysis 
at a 2-sided 0.0499 significance level. If the p-value of the OS test is < 0.0499 and the HR (λ talazoparib/ λ 
physician’s choice) is < 1, declare superiority of treatment with talazoparib for OS. 
No adjustments were planned for multiple testing/comparisons in the secondary and exploratory hypothesis 
tests except OS. 
Safety Analysis: 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 67/140 
  
  
  
 
The analyses of safety included all patients who received any study drug (talazoparib or active control) 
throughout the study duration. All AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) version 20.0. The Investigator classified the severity of AEs using the CTCAE v 4.03. A treatment 
emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as any event with an onset date on or after date of first dose of 
study drug, or any event present before treatment that worsens after treatment. Only TEAEs with an onset date 
prior to date of last dose + 30 days or the date of initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurs 
first) were tabulated in summary tables. The number and percentage of patients who experienced AEs were 
summarized by system organ class, preferred term, relationship to study drug, and severity for each treatment 
group. A by–patient listing was provided for those patients who experienced an SAE, including death, or 
experienced an AE associated with discontinuation from study drug. Clinical laboratory data were summarized 
by the type of laboratory test. (see section on clinical safety). 
Study populations: 
Intent-to-Treat Population: The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis population was defined as all randomized patients. 
The ITT population was analyzed according to the treatment assigned at randomization (not by actual treatment 
received). 
ITT with Measurable Disease Population: The ITT with measurable disease analysis population was defined as all 
patients in the ITT population who have at least 1 target lesion identified at baseline. For analyses using IRF 
assessment, patients were included in the measurable disease population if at least 1 IRF reader identified at 
least 1 target lesion at baseline. For analyses using investigator assessment, patients were included in the 
measurable disease population if the investigator identified at least 1 target lesion at baseline. 
Safety Population: The safety analysis population was defined as all patients who receive any study drug 
(talazoparib or protocol-specified physician’s choice). The safety population was analyzed according to the 
actual treatment received (not by treatment assigned). 
Pharmacokinetics Population: The PK analysis population was defined as all patients who receive at least 1 dose 
of talazoparib and provide at least 1 evaluable PK assessment. 
PRO-Evaluable Population: The PRO-Evaluable Population was defined as all patients who have completed the 
PRO questionnaire at baseline and at least one visit post baseline. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
Sensitivity analyses of PFS based on different definitions of progression events and censoring rules were 
described. These analyses were performed for the ITT population, using the same statistical methods as the 
primary analysis. 
1. Impact of investigator radiographic assessment: To evaluate PFS by investigator assessment of radiographic 
progression, the PFS analysis included progression events by investigator assessment of radiographic 
progression or deaths. Clinical deterioration as assessed by investigator or radiographic progression determined 
by the IRF were not considered progression events. 
2. Impact of investigator radiographic and clinical deterioration assessments: To evaluate PFS by investigator 
assessments, the PFS analysis included progression events of radiographic progression or clinical deterioration 
as assessed by investigator or death. Clinical deterioration was determined by clinical review of treatment 
discontinuation reason recorded on the End of Treatment eCRF. 
3. Impact of clinical deterioration by investigator: To evaluate clinical deterioration by investigator assessment, 
the PFS analysis included radiographic progression as determined by IRF, clinical deterioration as assessed by 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 68/140 
  
  
  
investigator, or death. Clinical deterioration was determined by clinical review of treatment discontinuation 
reason recorded on the End of Treatment eCRF. 
4. Impact of radiographic progression after study drug discontinuation + 30 days: Patients who had radiographic 
progression as determined by IRF after 30 days following treatment discontinuation were also considered to 
have a PFS event. For this analysis, PFS events included radiographic progression as determined by IRF that 
occurs anytime (on, before, or after 30 days following treatment discontinuation) or death due to any cause. 
5. Impact of treatment discontinuation for any reason: Patients who discontinued study treatment before 
radiographic progression as determined by IRF or death were considered to have a PFS event at the time of the 
study treatment discontinuation. For this analysis, PFS was defined as the time from randomization until the 
date of radiographic progression as determined by IRF, study treatment discontinuation for any reason, or death 
due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 
6. Impact of post-baseline antineoplastic therapies: Patients who received any post-baseline antineoplastic 
therapy will be considered to have a PFS event. For this analysis PFS was defined as the time from randomization 
until the date of radiographic progression as determined by IRF, initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy, or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 
7. Impact of on-study radiotherapy: For patients who received any on-study radiotherapy before radiographic 
progression as determined by IRF, PFS was censored on the date of the last adequate tumour assessment on or 
before the radiotherapy. Date of on-study radiotherapy will be derived from the Prior and Concomitant Radiation 
Cancer Treatment eCRF. 
8. Impact of deaths after end of treatment + 126 days (2 scheduled scans, every 9 weeks after week 30): For 
patients who did not have radiographic progression and died more than 126 days following treatment 
discontinuation, PFS was censored on the date of the last adequate tumour assessment on or before 126 days 
following treatment discontinuation. 
9. Impact of capsule strength: Patients treated with a starting dose of 4 x 0.25 mg capsules were excluded from 
this analysis. The treatment effect was assessed in patients treated with a starting dose of 1 x 1 mg capsules. 
10. Impact of central genetic testing: This PFS by IRF analysis included only the subgroup of patients with a 
deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutation based on the FDA-approved MYRIAD 
BRACAnalysis assay (QSR assay) or CLIA assay and excluded patients with only a local result available. 
11. Impact of assessing eligibility with QSR assay: This PFS by IRF analysis included only the subgroup of 
patients with a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutation based on the MYRIAD 
BRACAnalysis assay (QSR assay) result and excluded patients enrolled based on a local test result or a CLIA 
result. Approximately 70% of the patients randomized in the study were expected to be included in this 
sensitivity analysis. 
Additional Analyses: 
As another analysis for PFS, the HR was estimated using a stratified Cox regression model with treatment group 
and selected baseline prognostic factors as the main effects, and using the same stratification factors as the 
primary analysis. The prognostic factors included ECOG score (0 vs > 0), BRCA status (BRCA1 vs BRCA2), prior 
platinum treatment (yes vs no), and time from initial diagnosis of breast cancer to initial diagnosis of advanced 
breast cancer (< 12 months vs ≥ 12 months). 
Handling of dropouts or missing data 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 69/140 
  
  
  
All analyses and descriptive summaries were based on the observed data. Unless otherwise specified, missing 
data were not imputed. Imputation for partial dates was documented in the SAP. Quality-of-life missing data: for 
multiple-item scales, missing items were to be imputed based on the mean of the completed items if ≥50% of 
contributing items were completed. No other adjustment or imputation for missing data was performed.

Study Completion Date: Ongoing at data cut-off 15 September 2017 (primary completion date) 
Between October 2013 and April 2017, 995 patients were screened for this study and 431 patients were 
randomized. A total of 145 study sites randomized at least 1 patient: 43 study sites in the US, 74 study sites in 
Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain, UK, Russia, Ukraine, and Israel), and 28 study 
sites in other countries (Australia, Brazil, South Korea, and Taiwan). A total of 156 patients (36.2%) were 
enrolled in the US, 190 patients (44.1%) in Europe, and 85 patients (19.7%) in the Rest of World. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The protocol was changed four times by administrative letters #1, #2, #3 and #4, dated respectively 14th of July 
2014, 23rd of July 2014, 1st of May 2015 and 09th of February 2017. The original protocol dated 17th July 2013 
was amended once (14th December 2015); this amendment incorporated the 3 protocol clarification letters 
(14th July 2014, 23rd July 2014, and 01st May 2015) previously issued by the initial Sponsor (BioMarin).  
Amendment 1 (14 December 2015) was finalized after 184 patients had been randomized. The main purpose of 
the amendment was to change the Sponsor from BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. to Medivation, Inc. and update 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 71/140 
  
  
  
 
 
 
all contact information (including for safety reporting and medical monitor). Other important changes expanded 
the eligibility criteria, extended safety monitoring (including new liver safety monitoring guidelines for all 
patients), updated dose modification guidelines based on the type of toxicity, adjusted the secondary efficacy 
endpoint analyses, and updated study procedures to accommodate study site practices.  
The most common  stratification error was secondary to incorrect counting of prior therapy (sites were not 
initially provided with a list of drugs considered to be “cytotoxic” therapy).  In addition, the initial randomization 
form did not use the phrase “for locally advanced/metastatic disease;” therefore, many sites included drugs 
used in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting when they counted cytotoxic drugs. The initial protocol did not clarify 
that the most recent biopsy data should be used for determination of TNBC or hormone receptor positive breast 
cancer status for stratification purposes, and sites variably used initial and most recent data; this was clarified in 
the December 2015 protocol amendment.

a. One patient was listed as having no tumour assessment performed on Week 24.  This deviation  should 
have been captured under the category “Imaging assessment not performed.” 
b. One patient had an approximate 4 month interruption (07 April 2016-15 August 2016) in eribulin dosing to

Changes in the Planned Analysis 
The SAP was finalized on 30 August 2017. Changes to the planned analysis after the finalization of the SAP 
(Appendix 16.1.9.1) were as follows: 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 72/140 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
o  The primary analysis of PFS performed for the ITT population was to be conducted when approximately 
288 PFS events were observed. As of the data cutoff date (15 September 2017), it was estimated that 
95% of the total anticipated PFS events would have occurred by database lock, and this would be 
sufficient to inform the primary analysis. 
o  The following new PK populations were added: 
o  PK population prior to first dose modification: all patients in the PK population prior to a dose 
reduction or dosing interruption. 
o  Dose-compliant PK population: all patients who had received 21 consecutive days of 1 mg 
talazoparib without dosing interruption prior to sample collection, and who had predose PK 
samples collected 24 hours ± 10% (2 hours and 24 minutes) after the previous day's dose and 
no more than 5 minutes after the dose on the day of sample collection. This population was 
added as an appropriate population to derive the steady state Ctrough. 
o  Stratified subgroup analyses of PFS and ORR were conducted to further assess the consistency of 
treatment effects across subgroups. 
o  Additional analyses were conducted to review the following: 
o  Prior therapies for patients with HR+ disease 
o  Evaluation of the interaction term for the covariate analysis 
o  Analysis of PFS excluding patients who withdrew consent prior to receipt of study drug (1 patient 
in the talazoparib arm and 18 patients in the PCT arm) 
o  Patients who received poststudy PARP inhibitors and/or platinum therapy 
o  PK analysis by starting dose capsule strength 
o  The SMQ of ‘embolic and thrombotic events, venous’ 
o  The proportion of patients in the PCT arm who received an adequate starting dose as per NCCN 
guidelines 
o  Evaluation of the hematologic safety profile for patients treated with Generation 3.1 (1 × 1 
mg/day capsules) and Generation 2.0 (4 × 0.25 mg/day capsules)

Exploratory endpoints 
•  DOR 
Figure 10: Kaplan-Meier Curves of DOR by Investigator Assessment (ITT with Measurable Disease 
Population) 
•  Time to the end of the first post study therapy 
As assessed by stratified Cox regression analysis, the HR was 0.678 (95% CI: 0.505, 0.912;  p=0.0096) and 
median time to the end of the first poststudy therapy was 11.9 months (95% CI: 10.7, 14.1) for patients in the 
talazoparib arm  and 10.1 months (95% CI: 8.6, 12.4) for patients in the PCT arm. 
•  Patient Reported Outcomes 
Up to Cycle 12, the percentage of eligible patients who completed at least 1 question on the EORTC QLQ-C30 
was ≥81% in the talazoparib arm and ≥73% in the PCT arm. 
Baseline mean scores for Global Health Status/QoL were similar for the talazoparib and PCT arms, and were 
moderately high in both treatment arms (61.9 [95% CI: 59.0, 64.7] vs 60.9 [95% CI: 56.9, 64.9], 
respectively). 
Results from the between-treatment comparison of overall Global Health Status/QoL scores from the repeated 
measures analyses (mixed-effect model) and the same analysis based on change from baseline scores were 
reported. The difference between the 2 treatment arms in Global Health Status/QoL was 8.4 [95% CI: 4.6, 
12.3]; p<0.0001). Based on interpretation from the 95% CIs, the overall change from baseline scores in Global 
Health Status/QoL was 3.0 [95% CI: 1.2, 4.8] within the talazoparib arm versus -5.4 [95% CI: -8.8, -2.0]) in 
the control arm. 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 83/140 
  
  
  
 
 
 
The median TTD in Global Health Status/QoL was 24.3 months (95% CI: 13.8, NR) in the talazoparib arm 
compared with 6.3 months (95% CI: 4.9, 12.2) in the PCT arm. The HR was 0.376 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.55; 
p<0.0001). 
Descriptive statistics for the observed means for the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale scores and change from baseline 
were presented by treatment arm and visit. Baseline scores for all 5 functional scales (EORTC QLQ-C30) were 
similar between the 2 treatment arms and showed high functional levels in both treatment arms. Mean baseline 
symptom scale scores (EORTC QLQ-C30) were similar in both treatment arms for all symptoms. Baseline 
symptom scores indicated low symptom severity in both treatment arms. 
Up to Cycle 12, the percentage of patients completing at least 1 question on the EORTC QLQ-BR23 was ≥81% 
in the talazoparib arm and ≥73% in the PCT arm. The mean scores for the functional scales (body image, sexual 
functioning, and future perspective) were generally similar in both treatment arms at baseline except for sexual 
enjoyment (59.2 in the talazoparib arm vs 48.8 in the PCT arm).  
Between-treatment comparisons of breast symptoms scale scores from the repeated measures analyses and 
analyses based on change from baseline scores were presented. The model estimated difference between the 2 
treatment arms in breast symptoms scale scores was -5.0 (95% CI: -8.1, -1.8) favouring talazoparib 
(p=0.0022). Based on interpretation of the 95% CI, the overall change from baseline for the talazoparib arm 
was -5.1 [95% CI: -6.7, -3.5]. 
An analysis of TTD in breast symptoms was conducted based on time-to-event analysis methods. A majority of 
patients in each treatment arm were censored from the analysis (238 patients [90.8%] in the talazoparib arm 
and 100 patients [87.7%] in the PCT arm). Talazoparib treatment significantly delayed TTD in breast symptoms 
compared with PCT. The HR was 0.392 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.78; p=0.0053). The median TTD in the breast symptom 
scale was not reached for either treatment arm.

Supportive studies 
Study 673-201 
Study 673-201 was a Phase 2, open-label, 2-stage, 2-cohort study of talazoparib in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer with deleterious gBRCA mutations. In July 2015, both cohorts met the 
criterion to proceed to Stage 2 based on investigator review of the objective responses in Stage 1 (central 
imaging data were not available at that time). 
Further enrolment was discontinued in February 2016 to facilitate enrolment in the Phase 3 Study 673-301, as 
the eligibility criteria for these 2 studies became overlapping with the issuance of Study 673-301 Protocol 
Amendment 1 in December 2015.

A total of 84 patients were included in the ITT population (49 patients in Cohort 1 and 35 patients in Cohort 2); 
83 of the 84 patients (48 patients in Cohort 1 and 35 patients in Cohort 2) were also included in the 
tumour-evaluable (by central IRF or investigator assessment), safety, and PK populations (1 patient in Cohort 1 
was excluded because the patient did not receive study drug).   
Table 49: Patient Disposition (ITT population) 
Table 50: Protocol Deviations 
In Study 673-201, patient median age was 50.0 years (range: 31.0-75.0 years). The majority of patients were 
White (72.6%) and approximately 58.3% had ECOG PS 0 and 41.7% had ECOG PS 1. All patients had positive 
gBRCA status. Further information on patient disease characteristics and prior treatment for breast cancer is 
presented. Overall, the percentage of patients who had TNBC was 59.2% in Cohort 1 and 17.1% in Cohort 2. 
In Cohort 1 and 2, 40.8% and 82.9% of patients, respectively, had hormone-receptor positive disease defined 
as either ER-positive disease or PR-positive disease. BRCA status results from the central assessment were 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 93/140 
  
  
  
 
 
presented unless the samples were not available for central assessment, in which case the local assessment was 
presented. 
A history of CNS metastasis was reported for 8 patients (16.3%) in Cohort 1 and for 1 patient (2.9%) in Cohort 
2. The median time since the initial diagnosis of breast cancer was longer in Cohort 2 (5.0 years in Cohort 1 and 
6.2 years in Cohort 2), as would be expected for the cohort with a higher incidence of hormone-receptor disease. 
The median time since the start date of first cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease and the median time since 
the start date of first antineoplastic therapy for metastatic breast cancer were 1.9 years in Cohort 1 and 3.6 
years in Cohort 2, as expected as Cohort 2 patients likely initiated therapy for metastatic disease with hormonal 
therapy. 
All patients in Cohort 1 and all but 1 patient in Cohort 2 (97.1%) had measurable disease by investigator 
assessment per RECIST 1.1 at baseline. By IRF assessment, measurable disease was reported for 93.9% of 
patients in Cohort 1 and 91.4% of patients in Cohort 2. 
Per local assessment, the majority of patients had visceral disease at baseline as assessed by the investigator 
(77.6% of Cohort 1 patients and 65.7% of Cohort 2 patients). The most common metastatic disease locations by 
investigator assessment were lymph nodes (61.2% in Cohort 1 and 57.1% in Cohort 2), bone (53.1% in Cohort 
1 and 54.3% in Cohort 2), and liver (46.9% in Cohort 1 and 54.3% in Cohort 2). At baseline, 55.1% of patients 
in Cohort 1 and 45.8% of patients in Cohort 2 had >2 metastatic sites. 
As specified in the protocol, no patients in Cohort 2 had prior treatment with a platinum agent in the metastatic 
setting. In Cohort 1, 87.8% and 20.4% of patients received prior carboplatin and cisplatin, respectively. Patients 
in Cohort 1 may have received more than 1 prior platinum treatment. In Cohort 1, the median platinum-free 
interval was 4.06 months (range, 0.03-49.15 months). As previously noted, the protocol-specified 
platinum-free interval was 2 months, and enrolment of a patient with a platinum-free interval of <2 months was 
considered a major protocol violation. 
In Cohort 1, patients had a median of 2 cytotoxic regimens (range, 1-10) for advanced breast cancer disease. 
In Cohort 2, patients had a median of 4 cytotoxic regimens (range, 1-9) for advanced breast disease. 
Efficacy results 
In Study 673-201, the data cut-off date for all efficacy analyses was 01 September 2016. In addition, an 
updated analysis of overall survival was performed with a data cutoff date of 07 April 2017. The primary efficacy 
analysis was ORR by blinded central IRF, and the secondary efficacy endpoints included CBR24 and DOR by IRF, 
PFS by investigator assessment, and overall survival. Objective response required confirmation of response by 
imaging obtained at least 4 weeks after the initial observation. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: ORR by IRF 
ORR required confirmation of response. The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was based on IRF 
assessment of response and used the tumour-evaluable population. ORR by IRF was 20.8% (95% CI: 10.47, 
34.99) in Cohort 1 and 37.1% (95% CI: 21.47, 55.08) in Cohort 2. For BOR in Cohort 1, 4.2% of patients had 
CR, 16.7% had PR, 37.5% had stable disease, 37.5% had progressive disease, and 4.2% had scans that were 
inevaluable. 
In Cohort 2, no patients had BOR of confirmed CR, 37.1% had PR, 51.4% had stable disease, and 11.4% had 
progressive disease. 
The sensitivity analysis indicated that post-baseline antineoplastic therapies had a negligible effect on the ORR 
by IRF assessment in either cohort or overall.

Concordance in Response Assessments Comparing the IRF and Investigator Assessments 
In the evaluation of objective response, the concordance between the IRF and the investigator (“assessors”) 
was 78.3% across both cohorts. The concordance between assessors was 81.3% in Cohort 1 and 74.3% in 
Cohort 2. All discordant results were reviewed by the Sponsor Medical Monitor with the IRF prior to database 
lock. Overall, there were 17 discordant cases (8 in Cohort 1; 9 in Cohort 2). All discordant cases were 
re-reviewed by IRF; no change in assessment was made. 
Subgroup analyses 
Among the subgroups analyzed, a few were identified where the ORR in 1 subgroup was excluded by the 95% 
CI of the ORR in the opposite subgroup, indicating a possible difference in ORRs. Subgroups with 2 or fewer 
patients are not discussed. 
The following observations were made in the subgroup analyses for Cohort 1: 
•  A higher proportion of patients who were White had an objective response compared with those who were 
non-White (White: 26.3% [95% CI: 13.40, 43.10]; non-White: 0% [95% CI: 0.0, 30.85]). 
• 
For subgroups of patients with 1-2 versus ≥ 3 prior antineoplastic chemotherapy regimens, the ORRs were 
30.8% (95% CI: 14.33, 51.79) and 9.1% (95% CI: 1.12, 29.16), respectively. 
•  A lower proportion of patients with visceral disease had an objective response (13.5% [95% CI: 4.54, 
28.77]) compared with patients without visceral disease (45.5% [95% CI: 16.75, 76.62]). 
•  A lower proportion of patients who received prior anthracycline, taxane, or eribulin treatment had an 
objective response compared with patients who did not receive those prior treatments. For patients who 
received prior anthracycline, the ORR was 17.5% (95% CI: 7.34, 32.78) compared with 37.5% (95% CI: 
8.52, 75.51) in patients who did not; for patients who received a prior taxane, the ORR was 18.6% (95% CI: 
8.39, 33.40) compared with 40.0% (95% CI: 5.27, 85.34) in patients who did not; for patients who received 
prior eribulin, the ORR was 10.0% (95% CI: 0.25, 44.50) compared with 23.7% (95% CI: 11.44, 40.24) in 
patients who did not. 
• 
Patients who had a <6-month disease-free interval from the last dose of platinum to disease progression 
had an ORR of 9.4% (95% CI: 1.98, 25.02), which was lower than among patients whose disease-free 
interval was ≥ 6 months (46.7% [95% CI: 21.27, 73.41]). A trend was observed of increasing ORRs with 
increasing disease-free intervals from last dose of platinum to disease progression: 0% ORR with interval <2 
months (includes 7 patients who had protocol violations), 6.7% with interval 2 to <4 months, 20.0% with 
interval 4 to <6 months, and 46.7% with interval ≥ 6 months. 
•  BRCA status or TNBC status did not have an effect on ORR in Cohort 1. 
The following observations were made in the subgroup analyses for Cohort 2: 
•  A higher proportion of patients with TNBC had an objective response (66.7% [95% CI: 22.28, 95.67] 
compared with 31.0% [95% CI: 15.28, 50.83] in patients without TNBC). 
• 
Patients in Cohort 2 who received prior treatment with a hormonal/aromatase inhibitor had a lower ORR 
than those who did not (31.0% [95% CI: 15.28, 50.83] vs. 66.7% [95% CI: 22.28, 95.67)]. 
•  BRCA status did not affect ORR in Cohort 2.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
CBR24 by IRF was 27.1% (95% CI: 15.28, 41.85) in Cohort 1 and 45.7% (95% CI: 28.83, 63.35) in Cohort 2. 
The higher CBR24 in Cohort 2 follows the trend of higher ORR by IRF assessment. 
DOR by IRF: Median DOR was 5.8 months (IQR: 3.8, 9.7) in Cohort 1 and 3.8 months (IQR: 2.9, 6.7) in Cohort 
2. 
PFS by investigator: Median PFS was 4.0 months (95% CI: 2.8, 5.4) in Cohort 1 and 5.6 months (95% CI: 5.5, 
7.8) in Cohort 2. For each cohort, the median follow-up time was 13.7 months (based on reverse Kaplan-Meier 
estimates). 
The updated overall survival analysis had a data cut-off date of 07 April 2017, which was later than that of the 
CSR as the data were immature at the time of the CSR analysis. As of the data cut-off date, 73.5% of patients 
in Cohort 1 and 62.9% in Cohort 2 had an overall survival event. The median overall survival in Cohort 1 was 
12.7 months (95% CI: 9.6, 15.8) and 14.7 months (95% CI: 11.0, 24.4) in Cohort 2. 
Selected Exploratory Endpoints 
ORR by investigator was 22.9% (95% CI: 12.03, 37.31) in Cohort 1 and 51.4% (95% CI: 33.99, 68.62) in 
Cohort 2, which was higher than ORR by IRF assessment. The ORR results were demonstrated to be robust 
through a sensitivity analysis that evaluated the impact of postbaseline antineoplastic therapies. This analysis 
used response by IRF assessment and included all tumour assessments obtained before initiation of a new 
antineoplastic therapy. Post-baseline antineoplastic therapies had a negligible effect on ORR by IRF assessment 
in both cohorts and overall. 
The median PFS in Cohort 1 was 4.0 months by investigator and 3.9 months by IRF assessment, and in Cohort 
2, PFS was 5.6 months by both investigator and IRF assessment; this suggests agreement between the 2 
methods of PFS assessment. 
CBR24 by investigator was 37.5% (95% CI: 23.95, 52.65) in Cohort 1 and 65.7% (95% CI: 47.79, 80.87) in 
Cohort 2. The higher CBR24 in Cohort 2 follows the trend of higher ORR by IRF assessment. 
Median DOR by investigator was 4.9 months (IQR: 2.8, 7.1) in Cohort 1 and 4.2 months (IQR: 3.2, 5.6) in 
Cohort 2. 
Median PFS by IRF was 3.9 months (95% CI: 2.6, 5.6) in Cohort 1 and 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.2, 5.6) in Cohort 
2. 
In the ITT population as of 01 September 2016, 45 of 84 patients (53.6%) of patients had an OS event. More 
patients in Cohort 1 had events (65.3%) than in Cohort 2 where fewer than half of the patients had an event 
(37.1%). Data for patients not known to have died as of the data cutoff date were censored at the date the 
patient was last known to be alive or the data cutoff date, whichever was first. 
In Cohort 1, the median duration of OS was 11.8 months (95% CI: 8.8, 15.0) and patients who did not have an 
OS event had a median follow-up time of 15.6 months. In Cohort 2, the median duration of OS was longer than 
Cohort 1 at 16.5 months (95% CI: 10.1, not yet reached) and patients who did not have an OS event had a 
median follow-up time of 17.2 months.

This completed first-in-human, single-arm, open-label Phase 1 study evaluated the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, 
and preliminary efficacy of talazoparib in patients with advanced tumours with DNA-repair pathway deficiencies. 
The primary objective was to establish the MTD of talazoparib during the dose-escalation (Part 1) phase of the 
study. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of talazoparib and determine the 
recommended dose for the dose-expansion phase (Part 2). In addition the PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of 
talazoparib were investigated. Exploratory objectives included analyzing tumour and DNA-repair pathway 
markers in blood or tumour tissue and performing pharmacogenomic or pharmacogenetic analysis using blood, 
surrogate, and/or tumour tissue. 
A total of 113 patients were enrolled and 110 were treated; 7 patients still on treatment were rolled into the 
open-label extension study (Study MDV3800-13) as of 31 January 2017. 
Across Parts 1 and 2 of Study PRP-001, 20 patients with breast cancer were enrolled (8 patients in Part 1 and 12 
patients in Part 2). Of these 20 patients, 14 patients (all with deleterious gBRCA mutations) received the 
recommended single-agent talazoparib dose of 1 mg/day and were considered evaluable patients with breast 
cancer (Evaluable BC Population). These 14 patients comprised the Evaluable BC Population in Study PRP-001. 
Efficacy Endpoints 
For the Evaluable BC Population (N=14), ORR (confirmed CR or PR) by RECIST 1.1 was 50.0% (1 CR and 6 PR). 
The ORR was 40.0% for patients with a deleterious gBRCA1 mutation (2 of 5 patients) and 55.6% for patients 
with a deleterious gBRCA2 mutation (5 of 9 patients). The ORR was 28.6% for patients with TNBC (2 of 7 
patients) and 71.4% for patients with non-TNBC (5 of 7 patients). The CBR24 (confirmed CR, PR, or stable 
disease lasting at least 24 weeks) by RECIST 1.1 was 85.7%.  
The median PFS was 8.0 months (95% CI: 6.2, 12.4); and median DOR was 7.4 months (IQR: 4.6, 14.7). The 
median reduction in breast tumour size was 50.7% (range: -100% to -7%).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
As for most anti-cancer drugs with a defined target hypothesis, the exploratory studies programme was 
designed to identify a reasonable starting dose from a safety perspective and to show that the compound was 
sufficiently active in the target population to merit further studies, i.e. in tumours with deleterious BRCA 
mutations. This was achieved.  
The main study supporting this application is study EMBRACA (673-301;C3441009), a Phase III, Open-Label, 
Randomized, Parallel, 2-Arm,  Multi-Centre Study of Talazoparib (BMN 673) Versus  Physician’s Choice in 
Germline BRCA Mutation Subjects With Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer, Who Have Received 
Prior Chemotherapy Regimens for  Metastatic Disease.  
The dose regimen for talazoparib in the EMBRACA study was chosen based on preliminary results from the Phase 
1 clinical trial (PRP-001; C3441007) involving breast cancer patients, which reported good tolerability of 
talazoparib up to 1000 μg/day but dose-limiting thrombocytopenia at higher doses (1100 μg/day). This is 
considered acceptable. 
The study accrual lasted approximately 3.5 years (45 months). A total of 196 study centres in 16 countries were 
involved but only 145 centres were able to recruit 1 or more patients during the 45 months of accrual (mean 3 
patients per centre in 45 months).  
A total of 995 patients were screened for the study, of which 564 patients failed screening and were not 
randomized into the study. Most common reasons for screen failure were absence of deleterious or suspected 
deleterious or pathogenic germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations (64 %) and presence of active CNS metastases 
that did not meet protocol defined exceptions at screening (11 %).  
It is noted that patients with HER2 negative breast cancer and deleterious gBRCA mutations were enrolled 
without actual proof that the tumour showed homologous repair deficiency (HRD).  
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 98/140 
  
  
  
 
Geographic regions were not pre-defined as stratification factor but participating centres were in North America, 
South America, Europe, Australia and Asia. A total of 190 patients (44.1%) were enrolled in Europe, 156 
patients (36.2%) in the USA, and 85 patients (19.7%) in the Rest of World.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are generally acceptable. According to the initial protocol (v1.0) dated 17th 
of July 2013 the Applicant enrolled only patients with ECOG performance score 0 or 1 but excluded patients with 
higher score which does not reflect the general patient population with progressive advanced or metastatic 
gBRCA mutated breast cancer after several lines of prior treatments. In a scientific advice the CHMP 
recommended the inclusion of patients with an ECOG performance score 2. After 29 months, or 2/3 of the 
recruitment time, the protocol was amended to include patients with ECOG PS 2 in order to better reflect the 
intended target population.  
Based on the initial protocol (v1.0), the Applicant excluded patients that had received platinum containing 
chemotherapy except in case of within adjuvant or neo-adjuvant treatment. The amended protocol v2.0 
broadened the inclusion to allow patients that had received platinum containing regimens for advanced or 
metastatic disease if more than 6 months prior to enrolment. It is noted that the CHMP agreed with the 
Applicant, in a scientific advice, on the patient population definition, with regard prior treatments, but advised to 
include platinum cytotoxic treatment as one of the control arm (physician choice treatment), which was not 
followed. The Applicant argued that at the time of design and initiation of the study this was not considered a 
regular treatment option for patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Whilst the lack of a platinum 
containing regimen in the PCT arm is considered a deficiency in the design of the study, the chosen reference 
arm is nevertheless considered adequate for comparison. The proportions of patients that had received prior 
platinum in the advanced setting were fairly similar between the two arms (6 % in the talazoparib arm vs. 8 % 
in the PCT arm).  
Several amendments that were made to the patient selection criteria, like i) shorten the time before prior 
anticancer cytotoxic treatment, radiotherapy or surgery, before study treatment initiation, ii) allowing 1st line 
patients, iii) softening the requirements regarding prior anthracyclines/taxanes and iv) softening requirements 
regarding CNS metastases, seem to have been made with the purpose to broaden the patient population and in 
some way reflect general practice. Overall, the protocol amendment is not considered to have impacted the 
integrity of the study. 
The treatment dose and schedules of the PCT´s options can be considered standard and based on the marketing 
authorization of each individual agent and in agreement with clinical practice. According to the protocol the 
treating physicians were allowed to deviate from the dose and / or schedule of the comparator physician choice 
treatment options if based on investigational centre own guidelines or practice. 
According to the study protocol the patient selection aimed at patients eligible for 2nd to 3d line of treatment for 
advanced or metastatic disease. Within the amendment to the protocol (v2.0) the inclusion criteria were 
expanded to allow 1st line treatment and up to 3 prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy, which would result in 
more late line patient population and both shorter expected PFS and overall survival. This however did not result 
in high proportion of patients receiving the study treatment as late line treatment.  
Prior treatment with a taxane and/or anthracycline in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, locally advanced, or 
metastatic setting unless medically contraindicated was required (unless contraindicated). Although the 
majority of the patients (331 [76.8%]) enrolled in the study were treated with both prior anthracycline and 
taxane, 27 (6.3%) patients received only prior anthracycline therapy, and 61 (14.2%) patients received only 
prior taxane therapy. In line with the studied population the indication reflects that patients should have been 
previously treated with an anthracycline and/or a taxane. 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 99/140 
  
  
  
Furthermore, sensitivity or resistance to prior hormonal treatment was not an eligibility criterion, however all 
patients considered for randomization had to be candidates to receive one of the chemotherapy agents available 
on the PCT arm suggesting that endocrine based therapy was not considered by the investigator as appropriate 
for these patients. The indication, therefore, reflects that patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast 
cancer should have been treated with a prior endocrine-based therapy, or be considered unsuitable for 
endocrine-based therapy. 
PFS was chosen as primary endpoint which is acceptable considering cross-over to PARPi is expected in the 
control arm and expected survival after progression is long (median >1 year). 
For PFS, based on a 2:1 randomization allocation ratio (talazoparib: PCT), a total of 288 PFS events were 
considered necessary to provide 90% power for a 2-sided log-rank test at a 0.05 significance level to detect a 
hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67. Assuming an exponential distribution of PFS, this should correspond to an increase in 
median PFS from 4.6 months in control arm to 6.9 months in active arm (from 20 to 30 weeks; a 50% increase 
in median PFS). The sample size calculations and assumptions are considered adequate.  
Secondary endpoints were standard for oncology trials. ORR was not subject to IRF (RECIST 1.1). 
As the study case report forms were not designed to collect response on subsequent lines of therapy, the time 
of the second progressive disease (PFS2) cannot be determined.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
At time of data cut-off, more patients were still ongoing within the allocated treatment, talazoparib vs PCT´s 
respectively (22.3 vs 4.9%). 
The baseline data reflects the patient selection as defined by the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the primary 
protocol and the intended indication and treatment, locally advanced and/or metastatic germline mutated 
breast cancer. The majority of patients (98.4%) were female. The overall median age of patients was 46 years 
(range, 24-88), with a lower median age in the talazoparib arm (45 years) than in the PCT arm (50 years). The 
majority (182 [63.4%]) of patients in the talazoparib arm were <50 years of age; fewer patients (67 [46.5%]) 
were aged <50 years in the PCT arm. The majority of patients (69.6%) were White; 10.9% were Asian, 3.0% 
were Black or African American, 1.4% reported race as Other, and race was not reported for 15.1% of patients. 
Weight and BMI were similar across both treatment arms. Median baseline weight was 66.0 kg (range, 
41.7-157.8) and median BMI was 24.9 kg/m2 (range 17.2- 56.2). ECOG performance scores were 0, 1, or 2 for 
55.0%, 42.7%, and 1.9% of the patients, respectively. The ECOG performance status scores of 1 or 2 were 
44.3% and 2.1%, respectively, in the talazoparib arm compared with 39.6% and 1.4%, respectively, in the PCT 
arm. 
Across both treatment arms, 241 patients (55.9%) had HR positive disease (54.7 vs 58.3%). BRCA mutation 
status was centrally assessed for 94.7% of the patients. For the remaining 23 patients (5.3%) whose samples 
were not available for central assessment, BRCA status was determined by local assessment. BRCA mutation 
status (BRCA1-positive or BRCA2-positive) was similar across both treatment arms; BRCA1 46.3 and 43.8% and 
BRCA2 53.7 and 56.3%. A reversed distribution of germline BRCA1 and 2 in triple negative and HR positive 
breast cancer was noted. gBRCA 1/2 frequencies vary with geographic area, age, and hormone receptor status. 
Thus, triple negative breast cancer is more likely occurring in a young woman with gBRCA1. 
The median time from initial diagnosis to randomization, and the median time from initial diagnosis to advanced 
disease, was shorter in the talazoparib arm than in the PCT arm, or respectively 3.9 and 1.9 years for the 
talazoparib arm and 5.0 and 2.7 years for the PCT arm. The proportion of patients whose breast cancer

Page 100/140 
  
  
  
progressed to advanced disease ≤ 12 months was higher in the talazoparib arm compared with the PCT arm 
(37.6% and 29.2%, respectively), suggesting somewhat more aggressive disease characteristics in the 
talazoparib arm. There was a difference between the treatment arms with regard to measureable disease (ITT 
population) by independent review facility (IRF), 75.6% vs 65.3%, but the disease burden seems to have been 
rather similar between treatment arms with visceral disease in 69.7 and 71.5% of patients, in respectively 
talazoparib and PCT arms, although somewhat more patients in the talazoparib arm had ≥ 3 metastatic sites, or 
respectively 45.6 vs 41.7%. Patients with bone only metastatic disease were respectively 8.7 and 11.1%. The 
histology of the primary breast cancer was primarily ductal (87.5%) but somewhat more patients in the 
talazoparib arm had either lobular or ducto-lobular compared with the PCT arm, or 10.8 vs 4.9%. 
Of the 241 patients with HR positive disease, 141 patients (58.5%) had received prior hormonal-based regimen 
for advanced breast cancer and this was similar between treatment arms. The proportion of patients that had 
not received any form of anti-hormonal treatment was respectively 9.6 and 16.7% for the talazoparib and PCT 
treatment arms. Overall, 60.8% of patients had received prior cytotoxic regimens for advanced breast cancer.  
The median number of prior cytotoxic regimens for advanced breast cancer was 1 and was similar across both 
treatment arms. In the talazoparib and PCT arms, 38.7% and 37.5% of patients received no prior regimens for 
advanced or metastatic disease, 37.3% and 37.5% received 1, 19.9% and 19.4% received 2 and 4.2% and 5.6% 
received >= 3 prior, respectively. Sixteen percent of patients in the talazoparib arm and 20.8% of patients in the 
chemotherapy arm had received prior platinum treatment.  
At median follow up of 11.2 months, more patients in the talazoparib arm had progressed or died compared with 
the PCT arm or 64.8 vs 57.6%. The difference seems to be due mainly to more patients with progressive disease 
at time of the cut-off or 54.7 vs 47.2%, but the number of deaths was similar 10.1 vs 10.4%.  
The median duration of PFS was 8.6 months (95% CI: 7.2, 9.3) in the talazoparib arm and 5.6 months (95% CI: 
4.2, 6.7) in the PCT arm. Based on stratified cox regression analysis the HR was 0.542 (95% CI: 0.413, 0.711; 
P < 0.0001) in favour of the talazoparib arm (Unstratified log-rank test with HR 0.587; 95% CI: 0.451, 0.764; 
P < 0.0001). The estimated 1y PFS rate was higher for the talazoparib arm vs PCT or 37 vs 20%. 
Overall, 162 patients (37.6%) were censored from the primary analysis: 101 patients (35.2%) in the talazoparib 
arm and 61 patients (42.4%) in the PCT arm. The main difference seems to be due to higher number of censored 
patients due to ’’No disease progression or death prior to start of new antineoplastic therapy’’ suggesting that 
more patients in the PCT arm were censored based on change to other anti-neoplastic treatment, possible due 
to clinical progressive disease, or chemotherapy toxicity and decision to change treatment. One patient (0.3%) 
in the talazoparib arm and 19 patients (13.2%) in the PCT arm were censored due to no adequate post-baseline 
tumour assessment. The difference in the proportion of patients censored between arms, 9.8 vs 20.1%, without 
evident disease progression or death before start new antineoplastic treatment, is not explained. 
At median follow up of 11.2 months more patients in the talazoparib arm had progressed or died, according to 
investigator assessment, compared with the PCT like in the IRF assessment although the difference is somewhat 
less or 75.6 vs 70.8%. The HR by stratified cox regression analysis was similar or 0.538 (95% CI: 0.420, 0.689; 
P < 0.0001).  
As sensitivity analysis the PFS by investigator was assessed. The median duration of PFS, according to 
investigator assessment, was 7.0 months (95% CI: 5.7, 7.6) in the talazoparib arm and 4.4 months (95% CI: 
2.9, 5.6) in the PCT arm (unstratified log-rank test: HR 0.558 (95% CI: 0.439, 0.710; P < 0.0001)). 
Interestingly the investigator assessment resulted in higher number of progression events or deaths, 75.6 vs 
64.8%, and less PFS improvement, 2.6 vs 3.0 months, compared to IRF assessment but investigator 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 101/140 
  
  
  
assessment is generally considered more optimistic and potentially more biased than IRF assessment in open 
label studies.  
Potential evaluation bias between the IRF and investigator assessments with respect to either the progression 
status of the patient or the timing at which progression occurred were evaluated using 2 measures, the early and 
late discrepancy rate (EDR and LDR). The differential discordance around each measure is defined as the rate on 
the experimental arm minus the rate on the control arm. A negative differential discordance for the EDR and/or 
positive differential discordance for the LDR are suggestive of a bias in the investigator favouring the 
experimental arm. The overall concordance rate was 77.7% for the talazoparib arm and 80.6% for the PCT arm. 
The EDR between IRF and investigator was 34.0% for the talazoparib arm and 31.6% for the PCT arm, and the 
LDR between IRF and investigator was 38.6% for the talazoparib arm and 43.4% for the PCT arm. 
Pre-specified subgroup analyses of PFS were conducted to assess the consistency of treatment effects across 
subgroups defined by the baseline variables listed below. The subgroup analyses used stratified log-rank tests 
of PFS. The median PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the 95% CI was calculated for each 
subgroup by treatment. The HR and associated 95% CI were estimated using a stratified Cox regression model 
and displayed in a forest plot. The sensitivity analyses are considered acceptable and supportive of the primary 
PFS analysis. 
In the subgroup of patients who have received prior platinum, all patients that have ever received platinum 
compound were included, thus not only for advanced or metastatic disease. The proportion of patients that 
received carboplatin or cisplatin as prior anti-neoplastic treatment for advanced or metastatic disease was low 
in both arms, or N = 31 (19 vs 12) or 7.2% for carboplatin and N = 9 (5 vs 4) or 2.1% for cisplatin; total of 40 
(9.3%) patients, reflecting the study protocol and the amendment in December 2015. 
In conclusion, discrepancy rates comparing IRF with Investigator were on the high side (40%), but early and 
late discrepancy rates indicated no bias. Censoring rates were therefore higher based on IRF and led, as 
expected, to prolonged medians to event. Investigator assessment of PFS is from this perspective the preferred 
metric.  
Overall, a rather convincing effect on PFS has been shown (HR 0.54, p<0.0001) which is considered sufficiently 
large to make it less likely that “missing data” would negatively impact the statistically significant treatment 
effect. However the magnitude of the effect could be affected. Sensitivity analyses indicating that the positive 
results are reasonably robust to conservative assumptions with regards to potential bias due to 
non-administrative censoring were provided. 
There were no conspicuous findings with respect to subgroup analyses of PFS, including age (>50,<50 y.) 
regions, BRCA1/2, hormone receptor status, capsules 4x025 or 1x1 mg).  
At the time of the IA for OS at the data cut-off time for the primary PFS analysis 15 September 2017 
approximately 38% had died in both treatment arms and 62% were censored. Approximately 58% were alive in 
the talazoparib arm compared with 45% in the PCT arm, which represents 12.7% difference but patients lost to 
follow up were less in the talazoparib arm or 4.5 vs 16.7%. OS data are still immature. A positive trend in OS is 
observed (p=0.1 at about 40% event rates). However, missing data somewhat hampers interpretation. There 
is, however, no indication of a detrimental effect. The planned final analyses at about 321 deaths (about 74% of 
ITT population) 
Approximately 77% of patients (N=333) had measurable disease and ORR by investigator assessment, without 
confirmation, was 62.6% in the talazoparib arm compared to 27.2% in the PCT arm, resulting in 35.4% 
difference in ORR, which was statistically significant with odds ratio of 4.99 (95% CI: 2.93 – 8.83; p < 0.0001). 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 102/140 
  
  
  
Of interest is that 5.5% (N=12) of the patients in the talazoparib arm achieved complete response compared to 
0 in the PCT arm. In the talazoparib arm only 14.6% had progressive disease as best response. Approximately 
2/3 of patients with measurable disease the response assessment was confirmed, resulting in 50.2% ORR (95% 
CI: 43.41, 57.04) in the talazoparib arm and 18.4% (95% CI: 11.78, 26.77) in the PCT arm, or an 31.8% (95% 
CI: 22.1, 41.5) difference in proportions (odds ratio of 4.85; 95% CI: 2.69, 9.10; p<0.0001).  
Based on subgroup analysis the ORR benefit seem to be more in patients with i) ECOG PS 0 with OR 6.06 vs 3.32 
in ECOG PS 1, ii) BRCA1 with OR 7.01 vs 4.15 in BRCA2, iii) TNBC with OR 11.89 vs 2.89 in HR+ status, iv) CNS 
metastasis with OR 8.95 vs 4.48 when not, v) No prior platinum treatment with OR 5.36 vs 3.16 in the (few) 
patients that had received prior platinum treatment for breast cancer but this is not specified further based on 
platinum treatment for primary vs metastatic disease , vi) time from initial diagnosis > 12 months with OR 6.33 
vs 4.86 in patients with shorter history of breast cancer and vii) less number of prior treatments with odds ratio  
6.86, 5.06 and 2.66 in patients with respectively 0, 1 or ≥ 2 prior treatments. 
With respect to ORR, more convincingly superior activity is shown in triple negative tumours (odds ratio 12) than 
in HR positive tumours (odds ratio 3). It is noticed that about 1/3 of the patients had received no prior cytotoxic 
therapy for advanced disease. 
The median DOR in the talazoparib arm was significantly longer (p = 0.0005) or 5.4 months (interquartile range: 
2.8, 11.2 months) vs 3.1 months (interquartile range: 2.4, 6.7 months) in the PCT arm and the responses were 
durable with 1-year response rate of 23% for patients in the talazoparib arm compared to 0% in the PCT arm. 
The definition of time to end of first post-study therapy as the time from randomization to the end date of the 
first post-study antineoplastic therapy after the first documented disease progression by investigator 
assessment while on study drug (talazoparib or PCT) is considered acceptable. 
Although more patients received post-study treatment in the PCT arm (68 % vs. 62 % in the talazoparib arm) 
the median time to the end of the first post-study therapy was nearly 2 months longer for the talazoparib arm 
vs PCT arm or 11.9 months (95% CI: 10.7, 14.1) vs 10.1 months (95% CI: 8.6, 12.4). Post study antineoplastic 
therapies, including platinum drugs (34.5 vs 33.3%) were similar between treatment groups, except PARP 
inhibitors, as expected. PARPi were used in 1 vs. 18 % of patients in respectively the talazoparib and PCT arm.  
A statistically significant overall change from baseline favouring talazoparib arm compared with PCT arm was 
observed for the symptoms of fatigue, pain, insomnia, appetite loss, systemic side effects, breast and arm 
symptoms. Notwithstanding these results, the reliability  of the PRO results are hampered by the open label 
study design, the high proportion of censoring / missing data, the lack of a SAP with type I error control and lack 
of compliance with HRQoL questionnaires. Therefore, HRQoL data are not considered interpretable.    
A biomarker research program in blood and tumour, based on the EMBRACA study, is ongoing. The Applicant has 
initiated next generation-based DNA sequence analysis of tumour tissue samples collected from patients 
enrolled in the Phase 3 Study 673-301 (EMBRACA; C3441009). Results from this analysis will include BRCA1/2 
tumour mutational status and the tumour mutational status of over 300 other genes. Additional parameters that 
will be analysed include Somatic Germline Zygosity (derived from a computational method for predicting 
somatic versus germline origin, zygosity, and subclonality for a subset of variants; Sun et al, 2018), genomic 
loss of heterozygosity, and tumour mutational burden. The applicant is recommended to submit the biomarker 
report containing the final results by 31 March 2020. 
Supportive efficacy data were provided from a phase II Study 673-201 (C3441008, ABRAZO) and a phase I 
study PRP-001 (C3441007).

The efficacy of Talzenna in children and adolescents < 18 years of age have not been established. No data are 
available. 
Additional expert consultation 
The SAG Oncology was consulted on the following questions. 
1.  Can the efficacy of talazoparib, demonstrated by selecting patients through gBRCA 
mutations in blood samples, be extrapolated to patients with tumours exhibiting only sBRCA 
mutations? 
The majority of the SAG agreed that the validity of extrapolating the efficacy associated with PARP inhibitors 
observed in patients with germline BRCA mutations to patients with tumours with somatic BRCA mutations 
is only a hypothesis. Clinical data are lacking and extrapolating from the experience in ovarian cancer mainly 
based on the mechanism of action may not be appropriate in view of potential different tumour biology in 
terms of tumour microenvironment, immune system involvement, etc., between gBRCA- and 
sBRCA-associated breast cancers, and also considering that previous exposure to platinum differs in ovarian 
and breast cancer. Even if the BRCA-mutation is likely to be of great biological importance, the BRCA 
mutations per se may not be a sufficient “driver” for tumorigenesis in sBRCA-associated breast cancer. 
Other factors are probably involved, such as the extent of tumour heterogeneity and if somatic BRCA loss is 
an early or late event, TP53 abnormalities, etc. Thus, the effect of talazoparib in tumours harbouring only a 
somatic mutation, although an effect is biologically plausible, might be qualitatively or quantitatively 
different from the effect in gBRCA-associated breast cancer. In conclusion, there is uncertainty about both 
the treatment effect and a potentially differential side effect profile for sBRCA-associated breast cancer in 
comparison with gBRCA-associated disease. 
According to a minority of SAG members, however, although acknowledging the challenges expressed 
above, given that the effect of somatic mutation is in terms of phenotype is similar to what is seen with a 
germline mutation, it seems counter-intuitive that the response would be different for somatic vs. germline 
BRCA mutated breast cancer. Safety advantages might also be hypothesized as the drug would act more 
specifically on cancer cells (albeit not observed in ovarian cancer).  
The SAG agreed that further clinical studies, even just looking at response rate and duration in patients with 
tumours harbouring somatic mutations, are needed in order to support the hypothesis of sBRCA as a 
treatment predictive factor in patients with breast cancer. Observational studies (registries) might also be 
useful to explore this hypothesis. Studies should also investigate the incidence of MDS and AML. 
The SAG further noted that the control group of the pivotal clinical study excluded the use of a 
platinum-containing regimen, which is considered more efficacious than the physician’s choice 
monotherapies used in the pivotal trial. Thus, a smaller effect of PARP-inhibition would be expected 
compared to current standard treatments (although the toxicity profile is likely improved compared to 
platinum-containing regimen). Furthermore, the compliance in the physician’s choice arm indicated 
problems. Whether a PARP-inhibitor is more efficacious than platinum-containing regimens in the population 
of gBRCA-associated metastatic breast cancer has not been established. 
 Can efficacy be extrapolated from patients with gBRCA mutations to those with tumours 
displaying germline/somatic mutations in other genes potentially impacting HRD status? 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 104/140 
  
  
  
Given the challenges expressed above regarding extrapolation to tumours harbouring somatic mutations 
and the less clear role for other mutations and other mechanisms causing HRD, further extrapolation is not 
considered justified. 
2.  What methods for establishing the HRD status of breast cancers are appropriate and 
available? 
Currently, multiple different HRD assays have been explored. No studies of the effect of PARP-inhibitors 
using HRD as a treatment predictive marker has been presented. Thus, no HRD assay can be considered 
having clinical validity and utility for predicting PARP inhibitor sensitivity. 
3.  What methods for establishing the BRCA1/2 locus-specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) are 
appropriate and available? Is there an established relationship between the extent of LOH 
and the degree HRD in BRCA1/2 germline mutation-associated and sporadic breast 
tumours? 
There are methods available in a research setting, to test for BRCA1/2 locus-specific loss of heterozygosity; 
however, the SAG could not confirm to what extent any particular test is well-established. Furthermore, the 
relationship between LOH and HRD in germline mutation-associated and sporadic breast tumours is unclear, 
and mechanisms apart from LOH do operate in gBRCA-associated breast cancer as a mechanism for biallelic 
inactivation of BRCA1 and BRCA2, so the clinical utility of such tests over BRCA testing is not likely to be 
important in the context of treatment effect with PARP inhibition. 
4.  What is the likelihood of non-HRD tumours in patients with gBRCA mutations and 
HER2-/hormone-receptor positive disease? Does this possibility give rise to further 
diagnostic considerations?  
There are no data to quantify the rate of “sporadic” cancer in germline mutation carriers, i.e. non-hereditary 
breast cancers occurring as a consequence of other mechanisms apart from the BRCA mutation in a 
germline mutation carrier. Such cancers certainly exist, but in general, this is not considered to be of such 
clinical importance as to warrant further diagnostic considerations. 
5.  Could other genotype/phenotype features of breast tumours (e.g. molecular subtype, 
tumour grade, concomitant mutations, platinum/other chemotherapy sensitivity) indicate 
HRD, similarly to ovarian cancers? 
The SAG was not aware of any patient, tumour, or treatment characteristics that could be used as a present 
valid indication of HRD; further clinical data are required. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results indicate a clinically relevant impact on PFS as well as no detrimental effect on OS. A number of 
sensitivity analyses indicated that the main outcomes are reasonably robust to assumptions of informative 
censoring.  
Furthermore, the CHMP does not consider extrapolating the efficacy associated with PARP inhibitors observed in 
patients with germline BRCA mutations to patients with tumours with somatic BRCA mutations acceptable due 
to residual uncertainties about activity.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety database with data cut-off date of 15th of September 2017 encompasses data from 11 
sponsor-initiated clinical studies (7 studies completed and 4 ongoing) in which 494 patients received at least 1 
dose of talazoparib 1 mg/day thus constituting the “Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population”. This population includes 
the 286 patients from the pivotal Phase III 673-301 study (acronym EMBRACA) pertinent to the applied 
indication and in which talazopraib 1 mg/day was compared to one of four physician’s choice treatments 
(N=126; PCTs; capecitabine (44 %), eribulin (40 %), gemcitabine (10 %), or vinorelbine (6 %).

Table 53: Dose Modifications Due to Adverse Events (Integrated Safety Population) 
Adverse events 
AEs were coded using the MedDRA version 20.0 and graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. 
Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as any AEs that newly developed or worsened in severity 
following initiation of study drug. The treatment-emergent period was defined as the period of time from the 
date and time of the first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose (permanent discontinuation of 
study drug) or the day before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurred first. All AEs of any 
grade, regardless of relationship to study drug are presented by decreasing frequency of preferred term. 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 107/140 
  
  
  
 
 
 
AEs that changed CTCAE grade were reported as separate events, with the start date of the event at a new grade 
corresponding to the stop date of the event at the previous grade. Patients with multiple occurrences of events 
for a given preferred term (PT) were counted once at the worst severity for the PT. If relationship to study drug 
was missing from the CRF, the AE was counted as related in summary tables. AE listings showed the missing 
relationship as missing, if applicable.

Adverse Drug Reactions 
In the analysis of adverse drug reactions, cluster terms were used as summarized in the table below. 
Table 58: Cluster Terms Used in ADR Analyses 
ADRs were identified based on whether they were reasonably associated with talazoparib treatment. The 
applicant evaluated potential association by examining the reporting frequency for all-causality AEs for the 
talazoparib arm in comparison with the PCT arm in Study 673-301. Further, the applicant also considered the 
mechanism of action of talazoparib, the available nonclinical toxicology data, and the overall assessment of AEs 
by the investigators in determining whether AEs were reasonably associated with talazoparib treatment. As the 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 110/140 
  
  
  
 
 
 
safety profile of talazoparib was generally similar in patients who received 1 mg/day in Studies 673-301, 
673-201, PRP-001, MDV3800-14, and MDV3800-13, the applicant considered the pooling of the respective ADRs 
to provide the best representation of the safety of talazoparib.  
The overall safety profile of Talzenna is based on pooled data from 494 patients who received talazoparib at 
1 mg daily in clinical studies for solid tumours, including 286 patients from a randomised Phase 3 study with 
germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm), HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and 
83 patients from a nonrandomised Phase 2 study in patients with germline BRCA-mutated locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer. 
The most common (≥ 25%) adverse reactions in patients receiving talazoparib in these clinical studies were 
fatigue (57.1%), anaemia (49.6%), nausea (44.3%), neutropenia (30.2%), thrombocytopenia (29.6%), and 
headache (26.5%). The most common (≥ 10%) Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions of talazoparib were anaemia 
(35.2%), neutropenia (17.4%), and thrombocytopenia (16.8%). 
Dose modifications (dose reductions or dose interruptions) due to any adverse reaction occurred in 62.3% of 
patients receiving Talzenna. The most common adverse reactions leading to dose modifications were anaemia 
(33.0%), neutropenia (15.8%), and thrombocytopenia (13.4%). 
Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 3.6% of patients receiving Talzenna. The 
median duration of exposure was 5.4 months (range 0.03-61.1). 
Table 3 summarises adverse reactions based on pooled dataset listed by system organ class, and frequency 
category. Frequency categories are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10) and common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The Applicant has adjudicated hepatotoxicity and MDS/AML as adverse events of special interest which were 
selected following the CIOMS VI guidelines and taking into consideration the known safety data from the PARP 
inhibitor class of compounds. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Table 60: Hepatotoxicity-Related TEAEs Assessed by the Modified SMQ of ‘Drug-Related Hepatic 
Disorders – Comprehensive Search’, by PT (Integrated Safety Population) 
Hepatotoxicity-related AEs were evaluated using a modified SMQ of ‘Drug-Related Hepatic Disorders – 
Comprehensive Search’ which excluded terms within the ‘Liver Neoplasms, Benign (Including Cysts and Polyps)’ 
SMQ and ‘Liver Neoplasms, Malignant and Unspecified’ SMQ. Hepatotoxicity-related TEAEs were reported to a 
lesser extent in talazoparib exposed patients in the 673-301 study than in the control (9.1 % and 19.8 % 
respectively). Most commonly reported are increases of ASAT (4.2 %), ALAT (2.8 %) and ALP 2.8 %). One case 
of liver disorder was associated with death in the talazoparib arm of study 673-301 which was not considered 
related to study drug by the investigator due to progression of the disease under study.   
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) 
MDS and AML have been reported for other PARP inhibitors (<2%) including fatal outcomes (olaparib [Lynparza 
SmPC], rucaparib [Rubraca SmPC], niraparib [Zejula SmPC]).

MDS 
Table 61: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of ‘Myelodysplastic Syndrome SMQ [Broad]’ by PT 
(Integrated Safety Population) 
In the talazoparib arm of study 673-301 two events of pancytopenia were reported (whilst none in the control 
arm). One of them was considered related to study drug.  
AML

Safety Population) 
No reports of cases identified as AML were reported in the `Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population´.

Other Significant AEs by Organ System or Syndrome 
Myelosuppression 
Table 63: TEAEs of Myelosuppression by PT in the 673-301 study (safety population) 
Whilst most chemotherapy are expected to have a (more or less) negative impact on the bone marrow, it is 
noted that in the 673-301 study anaemia of all grades appeared at a higher incidence with talazoparib as 
compared to the control arm (52.4 % and 18.3 % respectively) as did thrombocytopenia (26.9 % and 7.1 % in 
the respective arms [frequencies based on the composite of PTs for selected cluster terms]).  Neutropenia was 
slightly less common in the talazoparib arm (34.6 %) as compared to the control arm (42.9 %). There was one 
case of febrile neutropenia reported in each treatment arm but no cases of neutropenic sepsis.  
Myelosuppression-related AEs associated with permanent discontinuations of talazoparib in study 673-301 were 
anaemia (0.7%), neutropenia (0.3%), and thrombocytopenia (0.3%). Corresponding proportions in regard to 
dose modifications were anaemia (38.1%), neutropenia (19.2%), thrombocytopenia (10.5%), decreased 
platelet count (6.6%), decreased neutrophil count (4.5%), decreased white blood cell count (4.2%), and febrile 
neutropenia (0.3%). 
A total of 25 patients (8.7 %) in the talazoparib arm required growth factor support (G-CSF, mainly filgrastim) 
compared to 22 patients (17.5 %) in the control arm. In the talazoparib arm, about 3 % required a platelet 
transfusion and 38 % RBC transfusions with a median number of two RBC transfusions per patient. In the PCT 
arm no patients required any platelet transfusions whilst 5.6 % required a RBC transfusion with a median of one 
per patient. 
In total about 10 % received EPO in the talazoparib group as compared to 1.6 % in the PCT group (2 patients in 
the eribulin treatment group). 
The incidence of TEAEs of anaemia (all grades and Grade 3/4) peak at about 3-4 months after start of study drug 
and thereafter subsides. In terms of incidence of TEAEs for anaemia after dose reductions (all grades and Grade 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 115/140 
  
  
  
 
3/4) it is clear that dose reductions are indicated up to and during the first 2 months. The same pattern is evident 
also in relation to thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.  
Pneumonitis 
One case of pneumonitis (0.2%) occurred in the 673-201 study. The event was a Grade 1 pneumonitis and 
considered treatment related. Concurrently, the patient had a dosing interruption of talazoparib due to Grade 3 
pneumonia, which was not considered related to study drug by the investigator. Study drug was resumed after 
resolution of pneumonia, and the AE of pneumonitis resolved by Day 85.   
Second Primary Malignancies 
Based on non-clinical studies, talazoparib is considered clastogenic indicating the potential for genotoxicity in 
humans. In the `Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population´, seven AEs of second primary malignancies were reported 
for six patients (squamous cell carcinoma of skin [2 patients], and basal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma 
multiforme, intraductal proliferative breast lesion, neoplasm skin, and ovarian neoplasm [1 patient each]. Of 
these events, three were reported in three patients in the talazoparib arm of Study 673-301.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events (SAE) 
Table 64: SAEs in Study 673-301 and Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population Occurring in ≥1% of 
patients in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population by Preferred Term (Integrated Safety Population) 
Similar overall proportions in terms of SAE reports are recognised between the two treatment-arms (31.8 % and 
29.4 %, talazoparib and PCT respectively). For the talazoparib treated patients in the pivotal study, anaemia is 
the most common cause for SAE (5.9 %) with pyrexia second (2.4 %).

Deaths

A total of 37.8 % died in the talazoparib arm in the 673-301 study as compared to 42.1 % in the control arm, the 
majority due to disease progression. The proportion of deaths occurring within 30 days after last dose of study 
drug was similar  between treatment arms (9.3 % and 9.4 % respectively) with the majority due to progressive 
disease (6.5 % and 7.5 % respectively).  
EMA/270498/2019

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In the 673-301 study, the haematology laboratory abnormalities that increased ≥2 toxicity grades from baseline 
were low neutrophils (50.3 %), low leukocytes (47.2 %), low haemoglobin (44.4 %), low platelets (24.8 %), and 
low lymphocytes (25.9 %). In terms of severity, the overall majority of reports were of Grade 1 or 2 but for 
decreased haemoglobin it amounted to 38.8 % Grade 3 or 4 reports with 14.7 % for platelets and 21.0 % for 
neutrophils.  
Chemistry 
The proportion of ≥ 2 toxicity grade increases from base-line regarding chemistry laboratory abnormalities was  
fairly low. In talazoparib treated patients in the 673-301 study the proportions were: ALT 2.1 %, AST 1.7 %, ALP 
2.4 %, TBL 2.1 % and creatinine 0.3 %. THe overall the majority of events in talazoparib treated patients in the 
pivotal study were of Grade 1 or 2 with a further low proportion of Grade 3/ 4 events (ALT 1.0 %, AST 1.7 %, ALP 
2.1, TBL 1.4 % and creatinine none).

Based on the liver test findings, no patients met the criteria for Hy’s law. 
Electrocardiograms 
Local investigators assessed the clinical relevance of locally obtained ECG findings in most studies. Limited ECG 
assessments were obtained in Studies 673-301 and 673-201. In the Phase I, FIH, dose escalation study 
PRP-001 study, the effect of talazoparib on cardiac repolarization was investigated. There were no clear 
indications that talazoparib negatively affects cardiac repolarization (see non clinical and pharmacology 
sections). 
Safety in special populations 
Gender 
Safety data were analysed for males (10.3%) and females (89.7%) in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day population 
(N=494). Of AEs reported for ≥10% of patients in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population, AEs reported at a ≥10% 
higher incidence in females compared with males were anemia, nausea, headache, neutropenia, diarrhea, 
alopecia, vomiting, back pain, and pain in extremity. In males compared with females, no events were reported 
at a ≥10% higher incidence. 
Age 
Safety data by age was dichotomised according to patients <65 years and ≥ 65 years. In the 673-301 study only 
27 patients were 65 or older in the talazoparib arm and eight in the control arm.

Race 
Because of the imbalances of race among patients in Study 673-301 (69.4% White, 10.7% Asian, 2.9% Black or 
African American, and 1.5% other), coupled with the high proportion of patients whose race was unknown 
(15.5%), the impact of race on the safety of talazoparib treatment could not be adequately assessed in either 
Study 673-301 or the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population.

Body mass Index (BMI) 
Safety data by BMI were analysed for the following three groups of patients in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day 
Population based on BMI: ≤18 kg/m2 (N=10; 2.0%), >18-30 kg/m2 (N=383; 77.7%), and >30 kg/m2 (N=100; 
20.3%). In the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population, AEs reported for ≥20% of patients with BMI >18-30 kg/m2 
were anemia, fatigue, nausea, headache, neutropenia, diarrhea, alopecia, vomiting, constipation, decreased 
appetite, and thrombocytopenia. AEs reported for ≥20% of patients with BMI >30 kg/m2 were similar, but 
constipation and thrombocytopenia were reported for <20% of patients and cough and dyspnea were also 
reported for ≥20% of patients. As only 2.0% of patients in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population had a BMI ≤18 
kg/m2, no comparison with this BMI group was possible. 
Renal impairment 
Mild renal impairment was defined as a creatinine clearance of 60-89 mL/min (N=157 [32 % of the Talazoparib 
1 mg/day population]), moderate renal impairment 30-59 mL/min (N=36 [7 %]) and severe impairment ≤29 
mL/min (N=1).  
In the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population, 60.7% of patients had normal renal function at study baseline, 31.8% 
had mild renal impairment, 7.3% had moderate renal impairment, and 0.2% (1 patient) had severe renal 
impairment. AEs reported for ≥20% of patients in the normal renal function group were anemia, fatigue, nausea, 
headache, neutropenia, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation. AEs reported for ≥20% of patients in the mild 
renal impairment group were similar but additionally included decreased appetite, while headache, vomiting, 
and constipation were reported for <20% of patients. AEs reported for ≥20% of patients in the moderate renal 
impairment group were also similar to those reported for ≥20% of patients with normal renal function, but with 
the addition of thrombocytopenia and decreased platelet count, while headache and diarrhea were reported for 
<20% of patients. Only 1 patient in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population had severe renal impairment so 
comparisons with this group were not possible. 
Hepatic impairment 
Hepatic  impairment  was  defined  as  TBL  or  AST  >  ULN  at  baseline.  Patients  in  the  `Talazoparib  1  mg/day´ 
population had baseline TBL up to 1.5× ULN (up to 3× ULN for patients with Gilbert’s syndrome) and ALT or AST 
up to 2.5× ULN (or up to 5× ULN if due to liver metastases). Of this population (N=494), 127 patients (25.7 %) 
had hepatic impairment at study baseline. AEs reported for ≥20% of patients in the normal hepatic function 
group were anemia, fatigue, nausea, headache, neutropenia, diarrhea, alopecia, vomiting, constipation, and 
decreased  appetite.  AEs  reported  for  ≥20%  of  patients  in  the  hepatic  impairment  group  were  similar,  but 
alopecia and decreased appetite were reported for <20% of patients, and thrombocytopenia was also reported 
for ≥20% of patients. 
Thrombocytopenia was the only AE reported at a ≥10% higher incidence in patients with hepatic impairment 
than  patients  with  normal  hepatic  function  in  the  talazoparib  arm  of  Study  673-301  (27.8%  in  the  hepatic 
impairment  group  vs  12.1%  in  normal  hepatic  function  group).  No  AEs  were  reported  at  a  ≥10%  higher 
incidence in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population; the biggest difference between hepatic function groups was 
for thrombocytopenia (26.8% in the hepatic impairment group vs 17.2% in the normal hepatic function group), 
which  was  also  reported  at  a  higher  incidence  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  in  the  PCT  arm  of  Study 
673-301 (11.1% vs 3.3%).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Table 67: TEAEs That Were the Primary Reason for Permanent Study Drug Discontinuation, by 
Descending Frequency of PT (Integrated Safety Population) 
The proportion of permanent discontinuations of talazoparib due to TEAEs is overall reassuringly low (4.5 % in 
study 673-301 and 3.6 % in the overall `Talazoparib 1 mg/day´ population). In the 673-301 study, anaemia 
was the reason for discontinuation of talazoparib in two patients. Otherwise there were isolated miscellaneous 
reasons for permanent discontinuation.  
Safety update 
Updated safety data were submitted for the 1 mg dataset (494 patients in the initial submission and 502 patients 
in the updated data set; all 8 additional patients were in the open-label extension Study MDV3800-13 [Study 
C3441010]). The overall data cutoff date for the updated safety review was 31 January 2018. Earlier data cutoff 
dates were used for studies with no active patients as of the safety update data cutoff date (Talazoparib NDA 
90-Day Safety Update Report).

Table 68: Clinical study data cut-off dates for the safety update 
Adverse Events 
The most frequently reported AEs (≥ 25%) in patients treated with talazoparib 1 mg/day were anemia, fatigue, 
nausea, and headache, as in the initial submission. In the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population, for 
myelosuppression-related AEs, Grade 3 anemia was reported for 34.9% of patients (0.5% increase from initial 
submission), Grade 3 neutropenia for 12.7% of patients (0.1% decrease), and Grade 3 thrombocytopenia for 
8.8% of patients (0.1% decrease); Grade 4 occurrences of these myelosuppression-related AEs were reported 
in 0.6% of patients for anemia, 2.0% of patients for neutropenia, and 2.4% of patients for thrombocytopenia 
(0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.2% increases from initial submission, respectively). 
Myelosuppression-related AEs were manageable through dosing interruption, dose reduction, and/or supportive 
care. Permanent discontinuation of talazoparib treatment associated with an AE was reported for 4.0% of 
patients in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population (increase 0.4%), including permanent discontinuations due to 
anemia in 0.6% of patients (% unchanged). 
Deaths 
In the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population, the percentage of patients who died (including deaths that occurred 
both ≤ 30 days after and deaths >30 days after the last dose of study drug) increased by approximately 8% (42 
patients) from the initial submission to the safety update data cutoff date (36.4% of patients [180/494] in the 
initial submission and 44.2% of patients [222/502] in this safety update). Deaths attributed to progressive 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 123/140 
  
  
  
 
disease increased from 31.6% of patients (156/494) in the initial submission to 38.6% of patients (194/502) in 
this safety update. 
Since the initial submission, 2 new deaths (one patient with Grade 5 ovarian cancer and one patient with Grade 
5 failure to thrive) occurred within 30 days after the last dose of study drug (24 patients [4.9%] in the initial 
submission and 26 patients [5.2%] in this Safety update). 
AEs of Special Interest 
Hepatotoxicity 
Overall, the frequency and severity of hepatotoxicity-related AEs were similar to those reported in the initial 
submission. In summary, based on the liver test findings and other patient data, no patients met the criteria for 
Hy’s law. 
MDS 
There were no additional reports of MDS AEs since the initial submission. Two patients with AEs coded with the 
PT of pancytopenia were reported in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population, which on medical review, were 
considered not consistent with MDS. 
AML 
In patients in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population, no AEs that possibly represented AML were reported in the 
initial submission or up to the clinical database snapshot date for this safety update. 
In patients who received talazoparib at doses other than 1 mg/day, an AE of Grade 4 leukemia was reported in 
1 patient in the initial submission. The event was consistent with a diagnosis of AML, and a diagnosis of AML 
evolving from MDS was subsequently established. No additional AEs that possibly represented AML were 
reported since the initial submission in patients who received talazoparib at doses other than 1 mg/day. There 
was 1 patient in the PCT arm with a reported AE of Grade 4 AML. 
Subsequent to the clinical database snapshot for this safety update, an AE of AML was reported for a patient 
from Study 673-301 in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population. This patient received prior systemic anticancer 
treatment that included 6 cycles of neoadjuvant cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, doxorubicin, and 6 cycles of 
carboplatin and paclitaxel albumin for her advanced disease. The patient also received prior radiation therapy.  
The Investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that Acute myeloid leukaemia was related to the 
study drug, but unrelated to concomitant drugs and clinical trial procedure. The Sponsor considered that the 
patient’s prior systemic anticancer treatment that included 6 cycles of neoadjuvant cyclophosphamide, 
docetaxel, doxorubicin, and 6 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel albumin for her advanced disease and prior 
radiation therapy provide an alternative etiology for Acute myeloid leukaemia. 
Myelosuppression-Related AEs 
Myelosuppression-related AEs were defined by the modified SMQ of ‘Haematopoietic Cytopenias’ (SMQ 
modifications) as in the initial submission. The incidence of myelosuppression-related AEs was similar to those 
reported in the initial submission.  
Pneumonitis 
In the initial submission, Grade 1 non serious pneumonitis was reported in 1 patient in Study 673-201; no 
additional AEs of pneumonitis have been reported in patients at any dose since the initial submission. 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 124/140 
  
  
  
Second Primary Malignancies 
In the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population, second primary malignancies were reported in 6 patients in the initial 
submission; no new cases were reported since the initial submission. 
Post marketing experience 
Talazoparib received first regulatory approval on 16 October 2018 in the United States (US) and is not currently 
marketed in any other countries/territories. Very limited post-marketing data is available. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database with data cut-off date 15th of September 2017 consists of data from 494 patients that 
received at least 1 dose of talazoparib 1 mg/day including the 286 patients from the 673-301 study (acronym 
EMBRACA) where talazoparib 1 mg/day was compared to one out of four physician’s choices. As the control arm 
consisted of these four alternatives representing conventional chemotherapy, any comparisons of its composite 
safety profile to that of talazoparib in this open label study is not considered of any clinical relevance. 
Overall, there were no clinically relevant differences identified between the findings in the 673-301 study 
compared to the composite talazoparib 1 mg/day population. 
The 673-301 study (EMBRACA) 
The mean and median duration of exposure in the 673-301 study was 8.4 months and 6.1 months respectively 
in the talazoparib arm as compared to 4.5 months and 3.9 months for the control arm. A total of 32.5 % and 
18.5 % received talazoparib between 6 and 12 months and ≥ 12 months respectively. There was no difference 
between mean and median for the talazoparib actual dose intensity (0.9 mg/day) and the mean and median for 
relative dose intensity (%) was 91.7 % and 87.2 % respectively. From the dose intensity perspective, 
talazoparib appears reasonably tolerable. 
The actual dose intensity of capecitabine, approximately 2000mg/m2/day, can be considered adequate in case 
of palliative treatment, reflecting the most accepted starting dose of 1000mg/m2 BID, although the protocol 
prescribed 1250mg/m2 BID. Among patients who received capecitabine (n=55), 81.8% received a starting dose 
of between 1000 to 1250 mg/m2 BID for 14 days out of a 21-day cycle. 
Similar proportions of patients receiving either talazoparib or capecitabine, or approximately 50% of patients, 
needed dose reductions due to AE´s but the median time to first dose reduction was twice longer for the 
talazoparib patients (19.3 vs 9.3 weeks). Dose interruptions were significantly more common for the talazoparib 
arm compared to the capecitabine arm, which may reflect the continuous treatment regimen. 
The difference in study drug exposure between talazoparib and PCT was approximately 4 months for the mean 
value (8.4 vs 4.5) but 2 months for the median value (6.1 vs 3.9) which is explained by more patients remaining 
on treatment with talazoparib beyond 14 months as compared with the PCT arm.  
A high proportion of TEAEs leading to talazoparib dose modifications (defined as any dose reduction or dosing 
interruption) was reported in the 673-301 study (66.4 %). Over 50 % of the talazoparib treated patients had at 
least one dose reduction due to AEs whereof about 25 % had one and 20 % had two dose reductions whilst a few 
were in need of 3 or more (~7 %).  
A high proportion of dose modifications (defined as any dose reduction or dosing interruption) due to TEAEs was 
reported in talazoparib exposed patients (66.4 %) with 52.1 % in need of (at least one) dose reduction (the 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 125/140 
  
  
  
median time to first AE associated dose reduction is close to 5 months i.e. occurs rather late) and 60.1 % 
requiring dose interruptions (mean and median time was 10.7 and 8.0 days respectively). In about half of the 
patients the talazoparib dose was reduced to 0.75 mg/day (1st step in the dose reduction algorithm in Section 
4.2 of the SmPC) whilst 28% were reduced to 0.50 mg/day and a limited number of patients (7.7 %) had a dose 
reduction to 0.25 mg/day due to AEs. Notably, the high rates of dose modifications did not translate into a 
corresponding magnitude of AE associated treatment discontinuations which are considered reassuringly low 
(4.5 %) and indicative of a manageable toxicity with appropriate risk minimisation measures. 
Report rates were high in the talazoparib arm for any TEAE (98.6 %), Grade 3 or 4  (67.5 %) and a fairly high 
for SAE reports (31.8 %). The reliability in regard to the adjudication of drug-relatedness is likely to be 
hampered by the fact that this is an open label study. It is recognised that the findings in the 673-301 study were 
in line with the observations in the overall “Talazoparib 1 mg/day” population.  
Almost all patients reported at least one TEAE, similar between treatment arms. For talazoparib treated 
patients, anaemia was the most common reported TEAE (52.4 %) followed by fatigue (50.3 %) and nausea 
(48.6 %). For the control arm nausea was the most common reported TEAE (46.8 %) followed by fatigue (42.9 
%) and neutropenia (29.4 %) which may be as expected with conventional chemotherapy. The majority of 
hematologic AEs in both treatment arms were Grade 3 or 4 (46.9% and 4.9%, respectively, in the talazoparib 
arm and 17.5% and 11.9%, respectively, in the PCT arm). Non-hematologic AEs were generally Grade 1 or 2. In 
terms of GI disorders, the rates of TEAEs between talazoparib treated patients and patients in the control arm 
were fairly similar: nausea (48.6 % in both arms), diarrhoea (22.0 % and 26.2 % respectively), vomiting (24.8 
% vs. 23.0 %) and constipation (22.0 % vs. 21.4 %). 
The Applicant evaluated the potential association with talazoparib by examining the reporting frequency for 
all-causality AEs for the talazoparib arm in comparison with the PCT arm in addition to consider the mechanism 
of action of talazoparib, available nonclinical toxicology data and the overall assessment of AEs by the 
investigators in determining whether AEs were reasonably associated with talazoparib treatment. The approach 
for the adjudication of ADRs appears overall reasonable. 
The predominant ADRs for talazoparib are related to bone marrow toxicity and anaemia of all grades appeared 
at a higher incidence with talazoparib as compared to the control arm consisting of conventional chemotherapy 
(52.4 % and 18.3 % respectively) as did thrombocytopenia (26.9 % and 7.1 % respectively).  Neutropenia was 
slightly less common in the talazoparib arm (34.6 %) as compared to the control arm (42.9 %). Dose 
modifications due to myelosuppression included anaemia 38.1%, neutropenia 19.2%, thrombocytopenia 
10.5%, decreased platelet count 6.6%, decreased neutrophil count 4.5%, decreased white blood cell count 
4.2%, and febrile neutropenia 0.3%. Corresponding proportions for permanent discontinuations of talazoparib 
are however low (anaemia 0.7%, neutropenia 0.3%, and thrombocytopenia 0.3%). In terms of neutropenia 
only one case of febrile neutropenia was reported but no cases of neutropenic sepsis. In terms of administered 
support, about 9 % in the talazoparib arm required growth factors (G-CSF, mainly filgrastim) and 38 % RBC 
transfusions (median number of two RBC transfusions per patient) and about 3 % required a platelet 
transfusion. In the PCT arm 22 patients (17.5 %) received growth factor support whilst 5.6 % required a RBC 
transfusion (median of one per patient) but none any platelet transfusions. 
Myelosuppression-related adverse reactions of anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were very 
commonly reported in patients treated with talazoparib 1 mg/day.  
Other common TEAEs reported for talazoparib were fatigue (50.3 %) and nausea (48.6 %). For the control arm 
nausea was the most common reported TEAE (46.8 %) followed by fatigue (42.9 %) and neutropenia (29.4 %) 
which is as expected with conventional chemotherapy.  
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 126/140 
  
  
  
In terms of GI disorders, the rates of TEAEs between talazoparib treated patients and patients in the control arm 
were fairly similar: nausea (48.6 % in both arms), diarrhoea (22.0 % and 26.2 % respectively), vomiting (24.8 
% vs. 23.0 %) and constipation (22.0 % vs. 21.4 %). 
Most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 events for talazoparib pertain to its exertion on the bone marrow. Grade 
3 and Grade 4 myelosuppression related events were reported for anaemia 34.8% and 0.4%, neutropenia 
15.6% and 1.8%, and thrombocytopenia 12.8% and 4.0%. Neutropenia was more frequently reported for the 
control arm (24.6 %). Notably Grade 3 or 4 infections were infrequent in both arms (4.2% in the talazoparib arm 
vs 6.3% in the PCT arm). 
No deaths were reported due to myelosuppression related adverse events. Myelosuppression related adverse 
drug reactions associated with dose modifications were reported for up to approximately 30% of patients in the 
talazoparib 1 mg/day population and those associated with permanent study drug discontinuation were reported 
for less than 1% of patients. 
The SmPC adequately reflects that myelosuppression consisting of anaemia, leucopenia/neutropenia, and/or 
thrombocytopenia, have been reported in patients treated with talazoparib (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Talazoparib should not be started until patients have recovered from haematological toxicity caused by previous 
therapy (≤ Grade 1). Precautions should be taken to routinely monitor haematology parameters and signs and 
symptoms associated with anaemia, leucopenia/neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia in patients receiving 
talazoparib. If such events occur, dose modifications (reduction or interruption) are recommended (see SmPC 
section 4.2). Supportive care with or without blood and/or platelet transfusions and/or administration of colony 
stimulating factors may be used as appropriate. 
It is noted that pulmonary embolism was reported in 6 patients (2.1 %) in the talazoparib arm as compared to 
none in the control arm however further data revealed 9 patients (3.1%) in the talazoparib arm that were 
reported for a VTE compared with 8 patients (6.3%) in the PCT arm in the 673-301 study. A search of VTE in the 
1 mg/day talazoparib Population (N=494) has furthermore been conducted that showed an overall frequency of 
VTEs of 2.8%. Hence available data is not suggestive of an increased risk of VTEs by talazoparib. 
Similar overall proportions in terms of SAE reports were reported between the two treatment-arms (31.8 % and 
29.4 %, talazoparib and PCT respectively). For the talazoparib treated patients, anaemia is the most common 
cause for SAE (5.9 %) with pyrexia second (2.4 %). 
Hepatotoxicity-related TEAEs occurred to a lesser extent in the talazoparib exposed patients in the 673-301 
study than in the control (9.1 % and 19.8 % respectively). Most commonly reported are increases of ASAT (4.2 
%), ALAT (2.8 %) and ALP 2.8 %).  
One case of pneumonitis (0.2%) occurred in the 673-201 study. The event was a Grade 1 pneumonitis and 
considered treatment related. However this was not considered to warrant inclusion in the SmPC.  
A total of 37.8 % died in the talazoparib arm in the 673-301 study as compared to 42.1 % in the control arm, the 
vast majority due to disease progression. The proportion of deaths occurring within 30 days after last dose of 
study drug was similar  between treatment arms (9.3 % and 9.4 % respectively) with the majority due to 
progressive disease (6.5 % and 7.5 % respectively). The proportion of AE associated deaths occurring during 
this period of study time does not evoke any immediate concern (3 patients; 2.8 % in the talazoparib arm).  
It is recognised that the studies programme included also patients with non-BRCA disease status, however due 
to the very limited number of these patients enrolled no conclusions can be drawn with  regards to safety 
between gBRCA vs. non-BRCA.

Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (MDS/AML) have been reported in patients who received 
poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, including talazoparib. Overall, MDS/AML has 
been reported in 2 out of 584 (0.3%) solid tumour patients treated with talazoparib in clinical studies. Potential 
contributing factors for the development of MDS/AML include previous platinum-containing chemotherapy, 
other DNA damaging agents or radiotherapy. Complete blood counts should be obtained at baseline and 
monitored monthly for signs of haematologic toxicity during treatment. If MDS/AML is confirmed, talazoparib 
should be discontinued (see SmPC section 4.4). 
The risk of MDS/AML is addressed in section 4.4 of the Talzenna SmPC and included in the Safety Specification 
for talazoparib as an important potential risk.  
For the important potential risks myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia and second primary 
malignancies (other than MDS/AML) a causal relationship with talazoparib has not been established. Cases 
reported in the continuing development talazoparib program and in post-marketing surveillance will be 
continually reviewed and patient monitoring guidance is provided to healthcare professionals in the SmPC to 
increase awareness of HCPs on this important potential risk, as applicable. 
A safety update has been submitted providing an additional 4.5 months of data (from 15 September 2017 to 31 
January 2018). The limited availability of post-marketing data is recognised (first regulatory approval on 16 
October 2018 in the US and the product is not currently marketed in any other countries/territories). It is agreed 
however, that overall the data from this update are in line with the observations made in the initial submission. 
There were no new cases reported in terms of second primary malignancies, pneumonitis and MDS. In terms of 
AML, no AEs that possibly represented AML were reported in the initial submission or up to the clinical database 
snapshot date for this safety update in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population. However, subsequent to this 
snapshot date, an AE of AML was reported for one patient from Study 673-301 in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day 
Population. The Investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility whilst the Applicant considered that 
the patient’s prior systemic anticancer treatment provided an alternative etiology for AML. As mentioned further 
above, MDS/AML is classified as important potential risks in the RMP which is supported. 
A comparison in regard to TEAEs between patients with normal renal function and mild renal impairment did not 
reveal any clinical relevant differences. The proportion of patients with moderate renal impairment and certainly 
in severe renal impairment is too limited to draw any firm conclusion. However, a population PK analysis showed 
that talazoparib CL/F decreased by 37 % in patients with moderate renal impairment corresponding to a 59% 
increase in exposure (AUC) compared to patients with normal renal function. Exposure-safety analysis indicated 
that higher talazoparib exposure was associated with a higher risk for Grade 3 or higher anaemia and 
thrombocytopenia, and had a trend for association with Grade 3 or higher neutropenia. Given talazoparib higher 
exposure in patients with moderate renal impairment which was associated with increased incidence of 
haematological AEs, a reduced starting dose of 0.75 mg once daily is recommended for this subpopulation (see 
discussion on clinical pharmacology and SmPC section 4.2). The use in Severe Renal Impairment is included 
under missing information in the list of safety concerns. A study of talazoparib in patients with renal impairment 
(Study MDV3800-01) is ongoing to further elucidate the effect of varying degrees of renal impairment on the PK 
and safety of talazoparib in patients with solid tumours (see RMP, category 3 study). 
No clinically relevant difference was observed except possibly thrombocytopenia that was more commonly 
reported in patients with hepatic impairment (26.8 %) as compared to patients with normal hepatic function 
(17.2 %). TEAE reports of anaemia and thrombocytopenia were similar between the populations (~49 % and 23 
% respectively). A study of talazoparib in patients with hepatic impairment (Study MDV3800-02) is ongoing to 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 128/140 
  
  
  
further elucidate the effect of hepatic impairment on the safety of talazoparib. The applicant is recommended to

Thrombocytopenia was reported at a ≥10% higher incidence in patients with hepatic impairment than patients 
with normal hepatic function in the talazoparib arm of Study 673-301 (27.8% in the hepatic impairment group 
vs 12.1% in normal hepatic function group). As talazoparib undergoes only minimal hepatic metabolism and 
further based on the PK/PD profile of talazoparib, this is not considered to be of any major clinical relevance.  
Safety data were analysed for males (10.3%) and females (89.7%) in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day population 
(N=494). Due to the overall limited number of male patients (only seven male patients were enrolled in the 
673-301 study) no firm conclusion can be drawn as regards the safety profile of talazoparib according to gender. 
Safety data by age was dichotomised according to patients <65 years and ≥ 65 years. In the 673-301 study only 
27 patients were 65 or older in the talazoparib arm and eight in the control arm. This discrepancy is as can be 
expected in a study population with BRCA mutated breast cancers as these patients tend to develop their 
tumours at an younger age compared to breast cancer in general (especially associated with BRCA 1 mutated 
cancers). Based on the presented data it is recognised that increased age appears not to be specifically 
associated with increased risk of talazoparib associated AEs. Given however the low number of patients no firm 
conclusion can be drawn.  
There were very few patients enrolled in the age cohorts of 75-84 (N= 14) and ≥85 to draw any firm conclusion. 
No differences of any major clinical relevance between the < 65 and 65-74 age groups were observed. 
Because of the imbalances of race among patients in Study 673-301 (69.4% White, 10.7% Asian, 2.9% Black or 
African  American,  and  1.5%  other),  coupled  with  the  high  proportion  of  patients  whose  race  was  unknown 
(15.5%), the impact of race on the safety of talazoparib treatment could not be adequately assessed in either 
Study  673-301  or  the  Talazoparib  1  mg/day  Population.  Based  on  the  population  PK  analysis,  talazoparib 
exposure was 19.2% lower in Asian patients compared with non-Asian patients. The effect of race on talazoparib 
exposure was not considered clinically relevant. Based on the population PK analysis talazoparib exposure was 
19.2% lower in the Asian  (10.7% of patients in the 673-301 study) compared with non-Asian patients (see 
SmPC section 5.2).  
Safety data by BMI were analysed for the following three groups of patients in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day 
Population based on BMI: ≤18 kg/m2 (N=10; 2.0%), >18-30 kg/m2 (N=383; 77.7%), and >30 kg/m2 (N=100; 
20.3%). The proportion of patients in the BMI ≤18 kg/m2 (N=10; 2.0%) wasis too limited to draw any 
conclusions. Although overall no clinically relevant differences were observed between the BMI >18-30 kg/m2 
(77.7%) and the BMI >30 kg/m2 (20.3%) cohorts aside from anaemia (45.7 % and 56.0 % respectively) and 
fatigue (45.4 % and 56.0 % respectively), some AEs were more common in patients with BMI of > 30 kg/m2 
compared to lower BMI. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity is based in findings from animal studies and has been included as an 
important potential risk in the RMP (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). Talazoparib may cause foetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman based on non-clinical findings. Based on non-clinical findings in testes 
(partially reversible) and ovary (reversible), Talzenna may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential (see 
section 5.3). There are no available clinical data on talazoparib use in pregnant women or any information on 
fertility in patients to confirm a drug-associated risk. Talzenna is not recommended during pregnancy or for 
women of childbearing potential not using contraception (see SmPC section 4.4). The SmPC contains adequate 
instructions to avoid pregnancy and utilise contraception in male and female patients.  
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 129/140 
  
  
  
Women of childbearing potential should not become pregnant while receiving Talzenna and should not be 
pregnant at the beginning of treatment. A pregnancy test should be performed on all women of childbearing 
potential prior to treatment (see SmPC section 4.4).  
Women of childbearing potential must use two highly effective and complementary forms of contraception prior 
to starting treatment with talazoparib, during treatment, and for 7 months after stopping treatment with 
talazoparib. Since the use of hormonal contraception is not recommended in patients with breast cancer, two 
non-hormonal and complementary contraception methods should be used (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
Regular pregnancy tests could be considered during treatment. Male patients with female partners of 
reproductive potential or pregnant partners should be advised to use effective contraception (even after 
vasectomy), during treatment with Talzenna and for at least 4 months after the final dose. 
Regarding breastfeeding, it is unknown whether talazoparib is excreted in human breast milk. A risk to breast 
fed children cannot be excluded and therefore breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with 
Talzenna and for at least 1 month after the final dose (see SmPC section 4.6).  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in the SmPC section 6.1 is a 
contraindication. 
Talzenna may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue/asthenia or dizziness 
may occur following administration of talazoparib. 
There is limited experience of overdose with talazoparib. No adverse reactions were reported in one  patient who 
accidentally self-administered thirty 1 mg capsules of talazoparib on Day 1 and was immediately treated with 
gastric decontamination. Symptoms of overdose are not established. In the event of overdose, treatment with 
talazoparib should be stopped, and physicians should consider gastric decontamination, follow general 
supportive measures and treat symptomatically (see SmPC section 4.9).  
The safety of Talzenna in children and adolescents < 18 years of age has not been established. No data are 
available (see SmPC section 4.2). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. Adequate recommendations in terms of dose adjustments 
have been reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC to manage adverse drug reactions. Interruption of treatment or 
dose reduction based on severity and clinical presentation should be considered (see SmPC section 4.2, Table 1 
and Table 2). Complete blood count should also be obtained prior to starting Talzenna therapy and monitored 
monthly and as clinically indicated (see SmPC section 4.2 Table 2 and SmPC section 4.4).

See clinical efficacy section. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of talazoparib (mainly characterised by myelosuppression) appears to be manageable with 
appropriate risk minimization measures as evidenced by the low treatment discontinuation rate. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
To address the use in patients with severe renal impairment, the applicant should provide the results of study 
MDV3800-01 (C3441001) evaluating the PK and safety profile of talazoparib multiple daily oral doses of 0.5 mg 
in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment as compared to patients with normal renal function (see

The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.2 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 16 October 2018. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of talazoparib with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers talazoparib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.   Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Talzenna (talazoparib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
EMA/270498/2019

information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication is for Talzenna as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with breast cancer 
susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer. 
About 5% of breast cancers arise in women carrying deleterious heterozygous germline mutations in the cancer 
susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Whilst women in the general European population have a 12% lifetime 
risk of developing breast cancer, about 55% to 65% of women who inherit a BRCA1 mutation and approximately 
45% of women who inherit a BRCA2 mutation will develop breast cancer by the age of 70. gBRCA mutations are 
found in 10% of male breast cancer patients with the majority with mutations in BRCA2. gBRCA2 mutations are 
associated with a lifetime risk of breast cancer between 5% to 10% in men. 
Heterozygous germline BRCA mutations, however, are insufficient to compromise DNA repair, with loss of 
heterozygosity required for homologous repair deficiency to be manifested in BRCA-mutant breast cancer, along 
with presumed high sensitivity to PARPi (or platinum compounds).  
BRCA1 is associated with younger age, HR negative status and basal phenotype, whilst the opposite is true for 
BRCA2. This means that middle aged HR positive breast cancer in BRCA1 carriers may not be related to the 
gBRCA carrier state.    
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer is palliative and the aim of the treatment is to 
reduce symptoms and prolong life with preservation of quality of life. Treatment of advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer can include surgery, radiotherapy, interventional radiology and systemic palliative treatment with 
number of different anti-neoplastic agents including anti-hormonal drugs, biologicals, targeted treatments and 
cytotoxic agents. The use of systemic treatments is generally sequential, mainly monotherapy, based on patient 
characteristics, patient previous medical history, previous treatments, disease biology, and disease burden.  
For patients with progressive germline BRCA mutated, HER2 negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer and indication for new anti-neoplastic treatment, after exhaustion of anti-hormonal agents and 
anti-CDK4/6 agents if indicated, treatment with PARP inhibitors or next line palliative chemotherapy, including 
capecitabine, eribulin and platinum containing cytotoxic agents, can be considered as next treatment option. 
First-line therapy of gBRCA associated breast cancer still follows similar clinical guidelines as for non-BRCA 
tumours. Platinum compounds and recently the PARPi olaparib (NEJM 2017) are increasingly used as second or 
later lines of therapy. 
Regardless the available treatment options the disease condition remains incurable with limited life expectancy 
and near continuous need for palliative systemic treatment with the side effects that generally follow cytotoxic 
treatments, including fatigue and general health deterioration, and intermittently progressive disease with 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 134/140 
  
  
  
 
increasing disease related symptoms. There is an unmet medical need for patients with advanced or metastatic 
incurable gBRCA HER2 negative breast cancer.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The EMBRACA study is an open-label, randomised, parallel, 2-arm multicentre Phase 3 study of talazoparib 
versus chemotherapy (capecitabine [44%], eribulin [40%], gemcitabine [10%], vinorelbine [7%]) in patients 
with germline BRCA mutated HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who received no more 
than 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic or locally advanced disease. Patients were 
required to have received treatment with an anthracycline and/or a taxane (unless contraindicated) in the 
neoadjuvant, adjuvant and/or metastatic setting. Patients with prior platinum therapy for advanced disease 
were required to have no evidence of disease progression during platinum therapy. No prior treatment with a 
PARP inhibitor was permitted.    
The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated according to Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1, as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS based on IRF for talazoparib compared 
with chemotherapy at event rates of 65% (talazoparib)  and 58% (control) with a median PFS of 8.6 months 
(95% CI 7.2, 9.3) vs 5.6 months (95%CI 4.2, 6.7) (HR 0.54 (95% CI 0.4; 0.7, p<0.0001).  
The investigator assessment at event rates of 76% (tazoparib) and 71% (control) reported a HR of 0.54 (95% 
CI 0.4; 0.7, p<0.0001) and median PFS of 7.0 and 4.4 months respectively. 
ORR (investigator, confirmation not required) was 63% in the talazoparib arm vs. 27% in the control arm (Odds 
ratio 4.99 (2.9, 8.8), p< 0.0001). 
Median duration of response by investigator was 5.4 (interquartile range 2.8; 11.2) months in the talazoparib 
arm vs 3.1 (interquartile range 2.4; 6.7) months in the chemotherapy arm. 
The overall survival conducted at 38% event rates reported a HR of 0.76, p=0.11, with median OS of 22 months 
vs. 19.5 months respectively. Survival rates at 2-year were 45% and 37%, respectively. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Imbalances in withdrawal rates at baseline and prior to endpoints constitute the main uncertainties, both with 
respect to PFS and OS. During the review, the applicant provided a number of sensitivity analyses indicating that 
the metrics are reasonably robust to assumptions of informative censoring. As the extent of bias that might be 
introduced cannot be precisely defined there is a residual uncertainty in the effect estimates due to the amount 
of missing data; however, the uncertainty and extent of potential bias, given the sensitivity analyses provided, 
is not large enough to questions the beneficial effect of talazoparib. 
The duration of response is in relation to the high response rate shorter than expected, i.e. resistance develops 
fast. Factors determining secondary resistance is one of the objectives of exploratory trials, not yet reported. 
Due to the lack of a direct comparison with platinum chemotherapy, the relative efficacy of PARPi compared to 
platinum chemotherapy has not been defined.  Further, efficacy has not been evaluated in platinum refractory 
patients. Thus there is a general uncertainty on the appropriate positioning of talazoparib in a treatment context 
where platinum based chemotherapy is an option. The applicant is recommended to investigate predictive 
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 135/140 
  
  
  
biomarkers that could impact the efficacy of Talzenna in different lines of therapy in patients with BRCA1- and 
BRCA2-mutated tumours and breast tumours of particular histological and molecular subtypes. The 
investigation of efficacy in platinum-resistant tumours and comparative efficacy to platinum agents is 
recommended. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety is based on data from 494 patients that have received at least one dose of talazoparib 1 mg daily 
including the 286 patients from the 673-301 study. The safety observations in this study compares well with the 
findings in the overall `Talazoparib 1 mg/day´ population. The mean and median duration of talazoparib 
exposure was 8.4 months and 6.1 months respectively. A rather limited 18.5 % have received talazoparib for ≥ 
12 months at time of data cut-off date. A high proportion of dose modifications (defined as any dose reduction 
or dosing interruption) due to TEAEs was reported in talazoparib exposed patients (66.4 %) with 52.1 % in need 
of (at least one) dose reduction (median time to first AE associated dose reduction is close to 5 months i.e. 
occurs rather late) and 60.1 % requiring dose interruptions (mean and median time was 10.7 and 8.0 days 
respectively). Notably, the high rates of dose modifications did not translate into a corresponding magnitude of 
AE associated treatment discontinuations which are considered reassuringly low (4.5 %) and indicative of a 
manageable toxicity with appropriate risk minimisation measures. 
The predominant ADRs for talazoparib are related to bone marrow toxicity. Anaemia of all grades appeared at a 
higher incidence with talazoparib as compared to the control arm (52.4 % and 18.3 % respectively) as did 
thrombocytopenia (26.9 % and 7.1 % respectively).  Neutropenia was slightly less common in the talazoparib 
arm (34.6 %) as compared to the control arm (42.9 %) however only one case of febrile neutropenia was 
reported in each arm and no cases of neutropenic sepsis. Aside from frequent dose modifications in order to 
manage the bone marrow toxicity, supportive measures were required. About 9 % required growth factors 
(G-CSF) and 38 % RBC transfusions (median number of two RBC transfusions per patient) and about 3 % 
required a platelet transfusion. In the PCT arm 22 patients (17.5 %) received growth factor support whilst 5.6 
% required a RBC transfusion (median of one per patient) but none any platelet transfusions.  
Other common TEAEs reported for talazoparib were fatigue (50.3 %) and nausea (48.6 %). For the control arm 
nausea was the most common reported TEAE (46.8 %) followed by fatigue (42.9 %) and neutropenia (29.4 %) 
which is as expected with conventional chemotherapy. In terms of GI disorders, the rates of TEAEs between 
talazoparib treated patients and patients in the control arm were fairly similar: nausea (48.6 % in both arms), 
diarrhoea (22.0 % and 26.2 % respectively), vomiting (24.8 % vs. 23.0 %) and constipation (22.0 % vs. 21.4 
%). 
Most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 events for talazoparib in the 673-301 study were anaemia (38.8 %), 
neutropenia (17.8 %) and thrombocytopenia (8.0 %). Notably Grade 3 or 4 infections were infrequent in both 
arms (4.2% in the talazoparib arm vs 6.3% in the PCT arm). 
Hepatotoxicity-related TEAEs were reported in a lesser extent in talazoparib exposed patients in the 673-301 
study than in the control (9.1 % and 19.8 % respectively). Most commonly reported are increases of ASAT (4.2 
%), ALAT (2.8 %) and ALP (2.8 %).  
A total of 37.8 % died in the talazoparib arm in the 673-301 study as compared to 42.1 % in the control arm, the 
vast majority due to disease progression. The proportion of deaths occurring within 30 days after last dose of 
study drug was similar  between treatment arms (9.3 % and 9.4 % respectively) with the majority due to 
progressive disease (6.5 % and 7.5 % respectively). A total of 3 patients (2.8 %) died due to AEs in the 
talazoparib arm.  
EMA/270498/2019 
Page 136/140 
  
  
  
MDS/AML has been reported in 2 out of 584 (0.3%) solid tumour patients treated with talazoparib in clinical 
studies. Potential contributing factors for the development of MDS/AML include previous platinum-containing 
chemotherapy, other DNA damaging agents or radiotherapy. The risk of MDS/AML is addressed in section 4.4 of 
the Talzenna SmPC. In the “Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population”, seven AEs of second primary malignancies were 
reported for six patients. Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia and second primary malignancies 
(other than MDS/AML) are classified as important potential risk in the RMP.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The precise risk of second primary malignancies is not well characterised. Cases reported in the continuing 
development talazoparib program and in post-marketing surveillance will be continually reviewed (RMP) and 
patient monitoring guidance is provided to healthcare professionals in the SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The prolongation of PFS compared with chemotherapy is modest, but the positive study result established 
talazoparib as an effective treatment within the scope of the indication. Withdrawal, excluding administrative 
censoring, prior to event is imbalanced with a clearly higher rate in the control group. OS data indicate no 
detrimental effect. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses indicate that the PFS and OS outcomes are reasonably 
robust to assumptions of informative censoring.

It is apparent that exposure to talazoparib requires to rather a high extent dose modifications, but the rate of 
treatment discontinuations is reassuringly low meaning that toxicity (mainly bone marrow toxicity and in 
particular anaemia) can be reasonably well managed with appropriate risk minimisation measures such as dose 
reductions, interruptions and standard supportive care. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In light of the poor prognosis of BRCA1/2 mutated HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, 
the efficacy results of the EMBRACA study are considered clinically relevant and outweigh the risks associated 
with the treatment which can be managed with risk minimisation measures (see SmPC and RMP). 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Substantial clinical benefit including OS benefit has been shown for anthracyclines and taxanes that are current 
standard of care. It is considered that anthracycline and/or a taxane should be specified prior regimens in the 
indication unless patients were not suitable for these treatments. The indication also reflects that HR+ breast 
cancer patients should have been treated with a prior endocrine-based therapy or be considered unsuitable for 
endocrine-based therapy in line with the studied population. 
Further to a SAG oncology consultation, the CHMP considered that it was not possible to extrapolate results also 
to patients with sBRCA mutations and therefore the indication is limited to patients with gBRCA mutations, 
according to inclusion criteria. While the proportion of men in the study program is very low, it is still considered 
possible to extrapolate results to men, based on the common biological and pharmacological rationale. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall Benefit/Risk balance of Talzenna is positive for the following indication: Talzenna is indicated as 
monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations, who have HER2 negative 
locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients should have been previously treated with an 
anthracycline and/or a taxane in the (neo)adjuvant, locally advanced or metastatic setting unless patients were 
not suitable for these treatments (see SmPC section 5.1). Patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast 
cancer should have been treated with a prior endocrine-based therapy, or be considered unsuitable for 
endocrine-based therapy. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Talzenna is favourable in the following indication: 
Talzenna is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with germline BRCA1/2-mutations, 
who have HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients should have previously been 
treated with an anthracycline and a taxane in the (neo)adjuvant, locally advanced or metastatic setting unless 
patients were not suitable for these treatments.  
Patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer should also have progressed on or after prior 
endocrine therapy, or be considered unsuitable for endocrine therapy.

The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, 
section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 6 
months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that talazoparib is a new active substance 
as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory-demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) 
that is characterised by inflammation, demyelination, and degenerative changes (National MS Society 
2020).  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
According  to  the  MS  International  Federation,  approximately  2.8  million  people  worldwide  have  been 
diagnosed with MS (Atlas of MS 3rd Edition 2020). In Europe, Germany (303 per 100,000) and Denmark 
(282 per 100,000) have the highest prevalence. The incidence of MS varies across regions, with rates 
as high as 8 to 10 new cases per 100,000 in high latitudinal regions. 
MS usually begins between 20 and 40 years of age. Rates of MS are 2 to 3 times higher in women than 
in men and higher in regions that are further from the equator. Comorbidities are frequent in MS and 
have  an  adverse  influence  on  outcome  and  adherence  to  treatment.  MS  is  one  of  the  most  common 
causes of non-traumatic neurologic disability in young adults, and therefore, the economic impact of MS 
is quite significant (Wallin et al. 2019, Reich et al. 2018). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The cause is not known. It is believed that a combination of genetic factors, immune system 
abnormalities, and environmental factors triggers the disease. 
The pathophysiology of RRMS includes a well-described inflammatory component, which predominates 
earlier in the disease, and a degenerative component for both myelin and neurons, from the beginning 
of the disease but whose clinical consequences plays a more significant role as time goes on (Compston 
and Coles 2008, Reich et al. 2018). Approximately 85% of people who develop MS begins with Relapsing 
Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), which is characterised by recurrent inflammatory episodes in which 
autoreactive lymphocytes marginate across the blood-brain barrier and enter the CNS, leading to acute 
injury  to  myelin,  oligodendrocytes,  and  axons,  and  potentially  causing  new  or  worsening  neurologic 
deficits. Without a disease-modifying treatment (DMT), over the course of 2 decades, more than half of 
untreated patients transitioned to a phase of gradual worsening independent of acute attacks and likely 
the acute inflammatory changes, known as progressive MS. Progressive forms of MS can be present as 
the initial disease course in approximately 10% to 15% of patients (Lublin et al. 2020). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Previously,  MS  was  classified  into  4  clinical  subtypes:  RRMS,  secondary  progressive  MS,  primary 
progressive MS, and progressive relapsing MS (Lublin and Reingold 1996). In 2014, the International 
Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS revised the MS phenotypes to the following disease-modifier 
phenotypes:  clinically  isolated  syndrome  (not  active  or  active),  RRMS  (not  active  or  active),  and 
progressive  disease  (active  and  with  progression;  active  but  without  progression;  not  active  with 
progression; not active and without progression) (Lublin et al. 2014). 
Assessment report  
EMA/173313/2023  
Page 10/129 
 
 
 
The  main  clinical  feature  of  RRMS  is  the  relapse  defined  as  the  occurrence  new  symptoms  or  the 
worsening of old symptoms, lasting more than 24 hours, and be separated from the previous attack by 
at least 30 days.  
The diagnosis of MS is based on clinical manifestations as well as on findings in paraclinical diagnostic 
tests  including  Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  (MRI)  and  evaluation  of  the  oligoclonal  bands  in  the 
cerebrospinal fluid.  
2.1.5.  Management 
A  variety  of  DMTs  have  been  approved  by  the  US  FDA  and  the  EMA  to  treat  MS,  including  RMS.  The 
primary target for the majority of DMTs developed to date has been T cells. Recent immunopathologic 
and clinical studies have demonstrated that B cells also play a central role in the pathogenesis of the 
disease, perhaps upstream of the T cell-mediated pathology (Greenfield and Hauser 2018, Hauser and 
Cree 2020). 
Available DMTs include injectable, oral, and infusion therapies. Monoclonal antibodies for RRMS include 
natalizumab, ocrelizumab, rituximab (off-label use), ofatumumab, and alemtuzumab. The FDA and EMA 
have approved two B cell-targeted therapies to treat MS, namely ocrelizumab (OCREVUS [ocrelizumab] 
USPI  2021,  OCREVUS  [ocrelizumab]  SmPC  2021)  and  ofatumumab  (ALIQOPA™package  insert  2017, 
KESIMPTA [ofatumumab] USPI 2020, KESIMPTA [ofatumumab] SmPC 2021). 
2.2.  About the product 
Ublituximab is a recombinant immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets 
the  cluster  of  differentiation  20  (CD20)  antigen  expressed  on  the  surface  of  pre-B  and  mature  B 
lymphocytes. The mAb has 2 glycosylated heavy and light chains including 16 correctly paired disulfide 
bonds (12 intrachain and 4 interchain disulfide bonds). 
It  is  composed  of  a  total  of  1,322  amino-acids.  The  human  (62.8%  of  total amino-acids)  and  murine 
(37.2%) parts of ublituximab are represented in Figure 1.  
Figure 1: Murine and Human Parts of Ublituximab 
The murine and human regions come respectively from the following clones: 
• CAT 13.6E12 (murine hybridoma, available as ACC 474); and  
• T125A2 (human hybridoma, LFB Biotechnologies internal reference).

The measured molecular weight of 147 kDa is consistent with the theoretical molecular weight deduced 
from  the  amino  acid  sequence  and  the  glycosylation  of  the  glycoprotein.  It  is  produced  by  stable 
expression in a clone after transfection of the rat myeloma cell line YB2/0. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The  applicant  requested  a  centralised  scientific  advice  regarding  the  clinical  development  for  the 
treatment of relapsing  MS (see above). Further, a Joint Rapporteur MAA Pre-submission  Meeting was 
held in order to discuss the preparation of the marketing authorisation application. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Ublituximab, the active substance contained in Briumvi, is a chimeric monoclonal antibody produced in 
a clone of the rat myeloma cell line YB2/0 by recombinant DNA technology. 
Briumvi is presented as a concentrate for solution for infusion in a single-use vial containing 150 mg of 
ublituximab in 6 mL at a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Pack size of 1 vial. 
Other  ingredients  are:  sodium  chloride,  sodium  citrate,  polysorbate  80,  hydrochloric  acid,  water  for 
injections.  
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
Ublituximab is a recombinant IgG1 chimeric monoclonal antibody which binds to CD20. It is a potent B 
cell depleting antibody with both antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC). The antibody is glycoengineered by its production in the rat cell line YB2/0. This cell 
line  has  reduced  levels  of  fucosyl-transferase  activity.  This  feature  leads  to  lower  overall  levels  of 
fucosylation leading to higher levels of ADCC mediated potency and B-cell depletion. 
Ublituximab has two glycosylated heavy and light chains including sixteen correctly paired disulfide bonds 
(12 intra-chain and 4 inter-chain disulfide bonds). The predominant N-termini species for both the heavy 
chain (HC) and the light chain (LC) are modified to pyro-Glu and the predominant C-termini of the HCs 
include C-terminal lysine truncations. The molecular mass of the predominant species is 146781.3 Da 
(with glycosylation). The amino acid sequence is described in Module 3.2.S.3.1.  
A glycosylation site is present on Asn298 of each HC. N-linked glycosylation sites are nearly completely 
occupied with predominately biantennary agalactosylated (80%), galactosylated (20%), fucosylated and 
non-fucosylated structures. There are less than 0.5% Man 5 and no significant levels of sialylated or O-
linked glycoforms. 
Additional  post-translational  modifications  observed  include  methionine  oxidation  and  asparagine 
deamidation at low levels at a limited number of sites. The information provided in General Information 
section is acceptable.

2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing process and process controls 
The  active  substance  is  manufactured  at  Samsung  Biologics  Co.,  Ltd.  (SBL),  300  Songo  bio-daero, 
Yeonsu-gu Incheon 21987, Republic of Korea. It was confirmed that all sites involved in manufacture 
and quality control of the active substance operate in accordance with EU GMP. 
The manufacturing process of ublituximab is composed of an upstream cell culture process resulting in 
the harvest of the cell culture fluid containing ublituximab and a downstream purification and formulation 
process resulting in the purified antibody. Ublituximab is manufactured at the production bioreactor scale 
using cell line cultured from the working cell bank (WCB). One vial from the WCB is thawed to generate 
culture.  The  culture  is  expanded  through  a  series  of  shake  flasks  and  seed  bioreactors  to  meet  the 
inoculum  requirements  of  the  production  bioreactor.  The  manufacturing  process  is  described  in  the 
dossier 3.2.S.2.2 in sufficient detail – flow charts and narrative descriptions are provided. Comments to 
the list of process parameters are provided under section 3.2.S.2.4. 
Process is typical for a monoclonal antibody and involves upstream process (vial thawing, seed expansion 
in  flasks  and  seed  bioreactors,  production  in  bioreactor,  harvest  by  depth  filtration)  and  downstream 
process (Protein A affinity chromatography, solvent/detergent (s/d) viral inactivation, cation exchange 
chromatography  (CEX),  anion  exchange  chromatography  (AEX),  virus  removal  filtration,  and 
conditioning with ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) followed by a final filtration of the bulk material into 
the  final  storage  container  which  is  frozen).  After  the  addition  of  the  stabilisation  buffer,  the  pool  is 
diluted to a target of 23.5 to 26.5 mg/mL with sodium citrate  NaCl, polysorbate 80, pH 6.5 resulting in 
a ready-to-fill active substance in the formulation buffer.  
Virus reduction is achieved with solvent-detergent  inactivation, chromatography steps and virus 20 nm 
nanofiltration steps.  
Bioburden-control  filtrations  (0.2 µm  filtrations)  occur  between  several  of  these  steps  also  for 
preparation of media and buffers. Bioburden and endotoxin tests are performed routinely throughout the 
process; bioburden sampling is conducted before 0.2 μm filtration steps (pre-filtration) where possible. 
Reprocessing is not allowed at any step. 
Maximum  resins  life-time  –  number  of  cycles  and  validated  process  hold  times  are  provided  in  the 
dossier, validation reports to support them are submitted. 
Critical process parameters (CPPs) have been identified for both the upstream and downstream process. 
The choice of CPPs is explained under 3.2.S.2.4 section. The assignment of CPPs is adequately discussed 
with supporting data. 
The total duration of cell culture from vial thaw until harvest is considered critical to define the acceptable 
maximum culture time according to proven cell line stability and duration of each upstream step is stated. 
Pool conductivity is not monitored during Protein A step, load conductivity is not monitored during AEX 
step.  This  approach  is  justified  by  the  applicant.  Number  of  diavolumes  for  UF/DF  step  is  listed  as 
operational parameter, this parameter is classified as CPP. It was further sufficiently clarified how the 
composition of the solvent/detergent buffer is controlled.  
Cleaning and storage procedures for resins and membranes are briefly outlined in 3.2.S.2.2. Information 
on  bed  heights,  equilibration/elution  buffers  pH  and  conductivity  are  included  in  the  description  for 
chromatography steps.

Control of materials 
Raw  materials  are  adequately  discussed.  All  raw  materials  with  the  exception  of  the  cells  used  to 
recombinantly express ublituximab used in the manufacturing process of ublituximab are of non-animal 
and non-human origin. Raw materials are listed, all them are NF, Ph.Eur or USP grade. If neither, the 
in-house  specifications  are  specified.  The  non-compendial  items  listed  include  cell  culture  media, 
purification resins, membranes and filters. The in-house specifications for non-compendial raw materials 
are included in 3.2.S.2.3. Compositions of buffers/media/stock solutions and components are provided 
in 3.2.S.2.2.  
Description of the development of rat myeloma host cell line, YB2/0 is sufficiently described. A list of the 
animal-derived components used for cell line/bank generation is shown in the dossier. All these materials 
are subject to EU TSE certification and have been appropriately treated, tested and are from low-risk 
sources. 
The expression vector is 11.1 kb in size and contains five open reading frames for the antibody heavy 
chain, light chain, Dhfr, NeoR and AmpR genes in the same orientation. The entire construct was verified 
by sequencing of both DNA strands. The restriction sites (that are shown in the figure provided in the 
dossier) were used for Southern blot analysis of the integration of the construct. The functional regions 
of  the  expression  vector  are  summarised  adequately.  The  resulting  expression  construct  sequence  is 
presented in the dossier – presentation of the development of expression vector is found sufficient.  
The production cell line was generated after transfection of the host cell line, selection and screening of 
transfectants, and then limiting dilution cloning. The clones were screened, production cell line R603-
12D11 was selected and adapted to serum free medium. A pre-seed stock (PSS) cell bank was prepared. 
The description of the generation of production cell line raises no concerns. 
Preparation of master cell bank (MCB) and WCB is described in sufficient detail. The MCB and WCB were 
tested  to  confirm  species  identity  and  safety  from  adventitious  agents  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q5A 
requirements.  MCB/WCB  testing  results  are  provided  (for  adventitious  viruses  in  3.2.A.2  section). 
Genotypic characterisation and testing of the cell banks are in line with ICH Q5D and ICH Q5A.  
An  end-of-production  cell  bank  (EPCB)  was  prepared  from  an  ublituximab  active  substance  batch  by 
removing a sample of the culture from the production bioreactor at day 9. The EPCB underwent 14 and 
3 population doublings beyond what is typical for the process. The EPCB was genetically characterised 
alongside the MCB to confirm the genetic stability of the cell line over a period of time sufficient to cover 
the cell culture commercial manufacturing process plus a margin. Genotypic characterisation and testing 
of the EPCB bank are in line with ICH Q5D. 
A EPCB was also prepared from ublituximab active substance of Process C2 by removing a sample of the 
culture from the production bioreactor at day 9. The EPCB underwent 22 and 11 population doublings 
beyond what is typical for the process.   
Cell bank storage is addressed and described. A description how stability of the cell banks is routinely 
monitored is included in 3.2.S.2.3. 
Generation of cell line and cell banking system is generally adequately described.  
The genetic characterisation and adventitious agent testing results for a EPCB from ublituximab active 
substance is provided. Summary of analytical methods used to characterise and test MCB and WCBs are 
provided.  The  correlation  of  maximum in  vitro  cell  age,  qualified  passage  number  and  number  of  cell 
generations  from  MCB  to  which  manufacturing  process  at  commercial  scale  will  be  limited  is  clearly 
declared in 3.2.S.2.3 section. The requirements for  establishment and qualification (retesting scheme 
with acceptance criteria) of future new WCB are provided. The protocol for preparation and qualification 
of future WCB includes genetic stability.

Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Section 3.2.S.2.4 provides a description of the tests, acceptance criteria and action limits for in-process 
control (IPC) of critical process steps (production bioreactor, s/d and viral filtration) and other process 
steps  employed  during  manufacture  of  ublituximab  to  ensure  that  process  performance  and  product 
quality are maintained.  
In addition to viral adventitious agents, bioburden and endotoxin are tested at many points in the process 
using validated assays. Action limits for bioburden and endotoxin testing are provided. Microbial IPCs do 
not raise objections. Discussion for viral testing is under Module 3.2.A.2  
There are no intermediates isolated during the ublituximab manufacturing process. 
The  control  strategy  is  described  (in  3.2.S.2.2  and  3.2.S.2.4)  as  set  of  parameters  (operational  and 
performance) and controls. The parameters are either CPPs, key process parameters (KPPs) or non-key 
process  parameters.  In-process  tests  are  conducted  during  manufacturing  to  ensure  that  the 
intermediate or final product conforms to its specifications. All parameters are controlled by NORs and 
ARs (or actions limits).  
The applicant described the management of KPPs and CPPs. In the event of an excursion of a CPP from 
an acceptance range, a deviation is initiated with a formal root cause analysis and impact assessment. 
CPPs are also subject to required monitoring in the context of a Continued Process Verification (CPV). 
KPPs are non-critical process parameters that only impact process performance; these are controlled but 
not subjected to CPV.  
As per definition of a parameter - which is not a CPP - its variability is considered to have no impact on 
a critical quality attribute (CQA). Based on this, the criticality for the following operational parameters 
was revised to CPPs in the applicant’s response. It is also briefly described how excursions from defined 
action limits are addressed.  
No design space is claimed. 
The  methods  for  mycoplasma,  adventitious  viruses  and  filter  integrity  testing  are  provided.  The 
qualification reports that demonstrate the suitability of the in-process analytical methods are included in 
this section or reference to other sections is provided. 
In response to a major objection raised during the procedure, the applicant provided a justification about 
the  selected  CQAs  and  CPPs.  Risk  assessments  were  provided.  The  rationale  provided  along  with  the 
support  of  scale-down  studies  (SDM)  studies  and  process  characterisation  reports  presented,  is 
considered adequate to justify the choice of CQAs and CPPs. 
Process validation 
The  process  validation  strategy  for  ublituximab  is  based  on  a  traditional  approach  that  includes  the 
process  design,  process  performance  qualification  (PPQ)  stage  and  CPV.  A  risk  assessment  was 
performed prior to validation. The risk analysis was based on three rating factors: severity, occurrence 
and detection. The severity rating factor accounts for the potential impact on CQAs, listed in the dossier. 
The CQAs were identified in line with ICH Q8, Pharmaceutical Development guideline and ICH Q9. Section 
3.2.S.2.6 was updated with the list of declared CQAs.  
The  upstream  process  from  vial  thaw  to  production  bioreactor  and  harvest  of  all  4  PPQ  batches  were 
successfully  executed.  PPQ  results  for  four  batches  are  provided.  The  applicant  did  not  mention  any 
excursions that have occurred during validation.

The upstream and downstream process including all steps described in 3.2.S.2.2. for 4 PPQ batches were 
successfully  executed.  All  CPPs  and  IPCs  results  were  within  their  respective  acceptable  ranges. 
Additional  and  characterisation  tests  (after  consecutive  downstream  steps)  were  also  performed  and 
results are provided. 
The  applicant  presented  data  for  process  parameters  for  upstream  and  downstream  process.  Process 
parameters  were  within  acceptable  ranges.  The  approach  generally  conforms  to  the  guideline 
EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014.  The  overall  approach  to  validation  is  acceptable.  Process  validation 
results to support the commercial scale (production bioreactor) manufacturing process are provided. 
The  results  from  the  PPQ  runs  for  in-process  bioburden  and  endotoxin  are  provided.  Results  from 
microbial testing of the PPQ process intermediates, tested using validated bioburden and endotoxin tests, 
are provided together with hold times acceptance range values. The microbial stability of each in-process 
pool (singularly) has been validated in the small-scale vessels. Based on the data provided, the maximum 
hold time for each in-process pool is set. Data from small scale pool hold storage study is in 3.2.S.2.6. 
Pool  hold  times  for  virus  filtration  filtrate,  AEX  pool,  Protein  A  pool  and  clarified  harvest  pool  are 
considered justified. 
A  small-scale  study  was  performed  to  evaluate  the  lifetime  of  resins.  Each  resin  will  be  concurrently 
validated  for  use  in  the  ublituximab  commercial  manufacturing  process.  To  accept  the  concurrent 
validation approach for resins, the actions taken in case results do not comply with the defined acceptable 
ranges. are provided.  
There is a lack of a scale down study for the UF/DF membranes. The applicant considers it as low risk. 
The applicant justified its position in 3.2.S.2.6 section. The criteria for determining acceptance of re-use 
of  the  membrane  are  generic  and  the  same  for  all  antibody  processes-  e.g.  membrane  flux, 
breakthrough, residual contaminating protein and bioburden/endotoxin after cleaning. The methods used 
at Samsung (SBL) are robust as they leverage multiple product experience. The cleaning step is robust, 
the loading of the membrane is low, the concentration is low in comparison to other products during the 
UF steps and the membrane is resistant to fouling. Additionally, at present these membranes have been 
successfully validated for reuse in other products at SBL for a range of re-uses. As a result, a concurrent 
validation  approach  is  justified  for  the  membrane  lifetime  study  validation  protocol  testing  and 
acceptance  criteria.  This  approach  is  accepted,  validation  protocol  for  concurrent  validation  for 
membrane lifetime study is provided in 3.2.S.2.5. 
It is indicated in the dossier that mixing studies were performed to validate the mixing in the full-scale 
solution  preparation  vessels  used  for  solution  preparation  in  the  upstream  and  downstream 
manufacturing processes. Results of mixing studies are provided to support the operational ranges for 
mixing. 
A chemical stability study was performed to validate the maximum hold time of the buffers used in the 
downstream process. The maximum hold times of the buffers were based on the last timepoint at which 
the results met the acceptance criteria. Validation data for buffers can be accepted. 
Microbiological data performed to validate the holding times along the manufacturing process have been 
presented. At commercial scale, the applicant verifies the holding times using “surrogate liquid”.  
Hold time for AEX eluate has not been defined. However, acceptable range for diluted neutralised eluate 
pool hold time during process validation is reported. The applicant has provided a clear table listing all 
the hold time AR in place for SBL process, along with the validated hold times in the small-scale studies.

To support validation exercise, the applicant has provided: i) Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) 
for upstream and downstream process, reporting identification of CPP and key/non-key parameters, ii) 
UF/DF Membrane Lifetime and storage studies; iii) Resin life-time study. A high-level tabled summary 
was included in module 3.2.S.2.6. The small-scale studies were used to challenge the process parameter 
over the entire range, while full scale data have been obtained working inside the target range. 
The  active  substance  manufacturing  process  has  been  shown  to  effectively  and  consistently  remove 
process-related  impurities  to  acceptable  safety  levels.  For  product-related  impurities,  no  significant 
changes  were  seen  through  the  downstream  manufacturing  process  (3.2.S.2.5  and  3.S.2.6).  The 
clearance  of  process-related  impurities  was  consistent  across  the  validation  batches  with  active 
substance meeting all batch release specifications. The manufacturing-scale data demonstrate consistent 
removal of product variants to acceptable levels. 
Risk  assessment 
for 
leachables 
from  single-use  equipment 
is  presented  according 
to 
EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014.  The  analytical  procedures  for  the  quantitation  of  process  and  product 
related  impurities  in  in-process  and  ublituximab  samples  are  validated  or  qualified  according  to  ICH 
Q2R1.  
Overall,  the  applicant  has  provided  data  to  assure  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  appropriately 
validated and can produce ublituximab batches of consistent quality.  
Manufacturing process development 
Commercial process C2 is currently run at SBL at bioreactor scale. Process C1 was run in bioreactors. 
Prior to Process C, Process B1 was first manufactured bioreactors and then bioreactors (Process B2/B3). 
Process  A  was  manufactured  in  four  sequential  bioreactors  for  early  phase  material  needs.  Process  A 
materials  were  used  in  non-clinical  and  phase  1  studies.  Process  B  and  C  materials  were  used  in  all 
phases of clinical trials and additional nonclinical studies. Changes were made to increase manufacturing 
scale and productivity and as needed for increased robustness, to fit into equipment at new facilities. 
Development, processes descriptions and changes between manufacturing processes are transparently 
described in sufficient detail. 
Comparability studies between materials derived from processes A, B and C material has been conducted.  
The analytical comparability among ublituximab batches manufactured by different processes have been 
assessed through batch release testing, extended characterisation and stability programs. Batches used 
in  the  pivotal  trials  RMS-301  and  RMS-302  were  manufactured  by  the  process  B2/B3  and  C1.  The 
analytical methodologies used for these batches are those described in 3.2.S.4. Data comparing early 
process  materials,  Process  A,  Process  B1,  and  Process  B2  are  summarised  as  well.  Stability  data 
comparison for batches from all processes are provided. The applicant concludes that data demonstrate 
that all ublituximab batches are highly similar. The level of fucosylation in the pivotal trial and commercial 
materials are different than the earlier materials.  The comparability data to evaluate ublituximab quality 
between batches manufactured by Process B2/B3, Process C1 and Process C2 is provided in 3.2.S.2.6. 
The  investigated  batches  exhibited  comparable  physicochemical  and  biological  properties  and  showed 
the consistent stability profiles. The applicant’s conclusion that Process B2/B3 and Process C1 and C2 
yield materials of comparable product quality is accepted. 
The batches used in pivotal trials RMS-301 and RMS-302 are clearly listed in Module 3. The choice of 
batches only from B2/B3 process for comparability study (6.3.2 part of 3.2.S.2.6 section) is justified (not 
all batches are indicated).  
Detailed comparability data for single batches from processes B2/B3, C1 and C2 is provided, in graphical 
format where applicable.

Several  differences  are  observed  across  the  subsequent  process  versions,  particularly  a  significant 
change in the glycosylation profile and in the binding to FcγRIIIa (158V) and ADCC. The differences seen 
in  the  level  of  fucosylation  in  the  pivotal  trial  material  and  commercial  materials  are  justified.  The 
applicant  discussed  the  observed  difference  in  fucosylation  between  the  clinical  batches  and  the 
commercial  batches  with  respect  to  clinical  performance  and  patient  safety.  The  applicant  provided 
adequate discussion of the observed differences between material from Process B2/B3 and Process C1 
and  C2.  It  was  also  further  elaborated  which  analytical  methods  were  used  for  analysis  (from 
development stage or commercial) for fucosylation level, FcγRIIIa binding activity and ADCC.  
It is noted that the acceptance criterion for cell viability is less for process C2 harvest than for process 
C1 harvest. The applicant discussed the effect of the prolonged culture in the production bioreactor on 
the observed significant drop in fucosylation levels on process C2 batches showing apparently no direct 
correlation to observed ADCC increase and CDC decrease (more pronounced in C2 batches). However, 
it is still clearly stated that culture duration may influence the fucosylation level.  
Overall, the data provided in the responses in support of the above considerations sufficiently reassures 
about the control of fucosylation levels in process C2-derived material. 
The comparability data to evaluate ublituximab quality between batches manufactured by Process B2/B3, 
Process C1 and Process C2 also reveals differences in glycan levels. These differences are discussed and 
justified that they do not impact the final conclusion of the comparability study.  
Analytical methods used in comparability studies are briefly described. Qualification data for analytical 
methods used in comparability testing is provided. 
A  comprehensive  comparability  study  between  materials  derived  from  Processes  A  and  B1  and  B2 
material has been conducted. Comparative batch data comparing Process A and Process B1 are provided. 
The comparison of the data for Process A and B1 batches shows that the two processes materials are 
indistinguishable  from  each  other,  except  for  glycan  species  distribution  and  relative  potency  by  the 
CD16  activity  assay.  The  comparison  of  the  data  for  Process  B1  and  B2  batches  shows  that  these 
processes  materials  are  indistinguishable  from  each  other  for  all  attributes.  All  of  the  data  obtained 
during  these  comparison  studies  are  corroborative,  and  sufficient  for  the  conclusion  that  ublituximab 
manufactured in Process A is similar to that from Process B1 and B2.  
Data from different process batches and the same stability conditions are compared. Comparison was 
provided to indicate that all ublituximab process batches have highly similar stability and degradation 
kinetics. Stability data package is overall acceptable.   
The  applicant  provided  data  (mean/range  result  for  parameters,  conditions,  IPCs  together  with 
acceptance  ranges)  for  upstream  and  downstream  B2-C2  processes.  Process  C  laboratory-scale 
development studies were run similarly to the commercial process in a qualified scale down models. It 
is stated that several process development and characterisation studies in support of acceptance ranges 
were  performed  (production  bioreactor  step,  harvest,  Protein  A  chromatography  step,  s/d,  CEX  step, 
AEX step, virus filtration, UF/DF and formulation and filling step). The rationale for setting the acceptance 
range  values  and  only  the  references  to  the  underlying  supporting  characterisation  data  and 
documentation are shown. The active substance process control strategy is justified. The potential CPPs 
for  the  ublituximab  upstream  and  downstream  manufacturing  process  are  evaluated  or  characterised 
through  process  characterisation  studies  designed  to  identify  the  final  list  of  CPPs.  The  results  of  the 
small  scale  studies  (process  characterisation  studies)  supporting  the  process  risk  assessment  are 
provided. The impact of investigated process parameters on certain CQAs is shown. Scale-down models’ 
qualification data are provided.

Overall,  process  control  strategy  development  and  comparability  data  are  acceptable.  The  applicant 
adequately  addressed  issues  raised  during  the  procedure  (Major  Objection)  regarding  observed 
differences between process versions (e.g. fucosylation levels, see above). 
Characterisation 
The  aim  of  the  structural  characterisation  was  to  confirm  the  primary  structure  and  the  higher  order 
structure  of  ublituximab.  The  structural  and  functional  attributes  of  ublituximab  are  described  for  the 
primary  reference  standard  (PRS)).  This  primary  reference  standard  was  produced  by  the  intended 
commercial  Process  C.  As  this  primary  reference  standard  was  produced  by  process  C1,  it  is  further 
compared  to  process  C2  and  the  previous  reference  standard  (process  B).  Separately,  analytical 
characterisation of process A and B batches are summarised. The molecule heterogeneity was defined 
and  characterised.  Various  orthogonal  analytical  techniques  were  used  to  characterise  the  primary 
structure,  carbohydrate  structure,  mass  heterogeneity,  disulfide  bridge  patterns,  size  heterogeneity, 
charge heterogeneity, biological functions and degradation pathways. Adequate and sufficient raw data 
(chromatograms, results) are provided.  
Molecular weights of ublituximab were confirmed by intact and reduced mass analysis (LC-MS). Results 
from the intact mass analyses demonstrated a high level of conformance among the active substance 
samples.  For  all  analysis,  the  experimental  molecular  weight  matches  the  theoretical  masses.  The 
analysis  verifies  the  consistency  of  the  primary  protein  sequence  with  cDNA.  The  agalactosylated  N-
glycan  forms  are  the  predominant  glycan  species.  Minor  levels  of  other  N-glycans  such  as  the 
galactosylated glycans are also observed.  
The extinction coefficient was established experimentally and the results and conclusions are included. 
To  verify  the  amino  acid  sequence  of  ublituximab  deduced  from  the  DNA  sequence,  liquid 
chromatography  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS)  peptide  mapping  analysis  on  reduced  and  alkylated 
samples was performed. 100% sequence coverage was accomplished for ublituximab combining the two 
digestions. For all peptides identified, the mass accuracy was within 5 ppm from the theoretical values. 
In addition to verifying the amino acid sequence of ublituximab, the peptide mapping analysis enabled 
the  detection  and  relative  quantitation  of  post-translational  modifications.  Oxidation  was  identified  on 
several  sites.  This  level  of  oxidation  is  similar  among  the  three  process  batches.  Deamidation  was 
observed at multiple asparagine sites The level of deamidation is comparable among the three process 
batches. Glycosylation was identified on the peptide containing the conserved N-glycosylation site Asn-
298 of the heavy chain. The peptide that did not contain a glycosylation modification was also measured. 
This non-glycosylated peptide was identified at levels around 10% for the three process batches. Primary 
sequence and post translational modifications data obtained by -MS peptide mapping is found acceptable. 
Edman sequencing was used to confirm the N-terminus identity of the earlier reference material and the 
primary reference standard. The data are sufficient. 
The  molecular  size  distribution  of  reduced  and  non-reduced  ublituximab  was  investigated  by 
electromobility rate using capillary gel electrophoresis. 
A  set  of  characterisation  methods  was  applied  to  evaluate  the  higher  order  structure  of  ublituximab: 
circular  dichroism,  disulfide  bond  pairing  analysis  by  LC-MS,  free  sulfhydryl  analysis,  dynamic  light 
scattering  (DSC),  size-exclusion  chromatography  with  multi-angle  light  scattering  (SEC-MALS)  and 
analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). 
Characterisation by SEC-MALS and AUC indicate that ublituximab consists of predominantly monomer, 
along with a small amount of dimer. Low levels of higher order aggregate and fragment were 
measured.

The  unpaired  cysteines  are  quantitated  by  a  colorimetric  Ellman’s  assay.  Free  thiols  are  measured  at 
0.68 mole free thiol/mole ublituximab for the primary reference standard. 
Primary and higher order structure have been investigated in sufficient detail. 
The charge heterogeneity was quantitatively assessed. icIEF technique were used to show the level and 
the distribution of the major charge variants. Batch analysis with icIEF demonstrated consistency of this 
quality  attribute.  The  charge  isoforms  observed  include  the  main  peak,  dispersed  peaks  in  the  acidic 
area, and two distinct peaks in the basic area. Ublituximab contains five charge variants: two individual 
acidic  peaks,  a  main  peak,  and  levels  of  basic  variants.  The  icIEF  method  is  stability  indicating.  The 
increase in the percent acidic species for the degraded samples correlates with decreases in functional 
binding and potency for all measures. 
Analysis of the acidic and basic fractions showed that the enriched acidic and basic species pools all have 
similar  binding  and  biological  activities  although  the  acidic  species  enriched  fraction  trends  lower  for 
CD20, CDC and ADCC due to both the expected increase in deamidation abundance as well as increased 
distribution of fucosylated glycoforms during cation exchange chromatography fractionation.  
N-linked  glycans  are  enzymatically  released  from  the  protein  by  PNGase  F  and  derivatised  by  2-AB, 
followed by NP chromatography coupled to fluorescence detection. Peak identifications are made based 
on  retention  time  referencing  to  glycan  standards  and  has  also  been  confirmed  by  LC-MS  analysis. 
Batches  manufactured  by  Process  B,  C.1,  and  C.2  have  comparable  levels  of  galactosylated  glycan 
species. The applicant states that the difference in fucosylated glycan levels has a small impact on the 
FcγRIIIa  binding  activity  and  ADCC  activity.  Man5  is  the  only  high  mannose  species  observed  for  all 
batches and the relative abundance is consistently low. 
Ublituximab  is  an  anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibody  with  a  wild  type  human  IgG1  Fc  domain.  Key 
mechanisms of action of ublituximab include ADCC and CDC, which are facilitated by binding to FcγRIIIa 
and C1q, in addition to binding to the ligand CD20. The active substance also binds to other Fcγ receptors 
and FcRN. The binding of Ublituximab to CD20, Fc receptors, and C1q have been characterised through 
the  product  development.  CD20  binding  was  also characterised  using  both FACS  assays  and  an  Meso 
Scale Discovery (MSD) assay. Binding affinities of ublituximab to the entire panel of Fc receptors were 
characterised  using  an  Octet  assay.  Binding  of  ublituximab  to  FcγRIII  158V  and  FcγRIII  158F  were 
characterised  by  surface  plasmon  resonance.  Binding  of  ublituximab  to  C1q  was  characterised  by  an 
ELISA  assay.  More  recently,  a  cell  based  CD20  binding  assay,  a  surface  plasmon  resonance  based 
FcγRIIIa binding assay, and an ELISA based C1q binding assay have been optimised and validated. These 
binding assays use the commercial reference standard RS-117808 as the reference standard and report 
relative  binding  potencies.  These  assays  are  also  in  active  substance  release  tests  panel.  Batch  data 
together with dose dependent response curves are provided in the dossier.  
The applicant provided information about the epitope / region recognised by ublituximab on CD20 target, 
in compliance with relevant guideline (ICH Q6B). 
CD20  binding  of  all  batches  representing  range  of  clinical  experience  are  comparable  whether 
manufactured by Process B or by Process C1 or by Process C2. The data shows that Process C1 and C2 
batches have comparable FcγRIIIa binding activities, and process C batches appear to have consistently 
higher FcγRIIIa binding activates than the process B batches. This range of FcRIIIa binding activities is 
representative of clinical experience. Process B and Process C1 batches and Process C2  batches have 
comparable C1q binding activities. Ublituximab is active in vitro in all assay formats and exhibits ADCC, 
CDC,  and  ADCP  (antibody-dependent  cellular  phagocytosis)  activities.  The  data  shows  that  Process  C 
batches have higher ADCC activity than the Process B batches, even though the ranges overlap. Process 
C1 batches and Process C2 batches have comparable ADCC activities. There is an inverse relationship 
between  the  ADCC  activity  and  the  level  of  total  fucosylated  glycans  in  the  range  of  40%-60%

fucosylation levels using data generated from the validated KILR ADCC assay. In the range of 20%-40% 
fucosylation levels, however, ADCC activity seems not to be affected by fucosylation levels. Process B 
and Process C1 and Process C2 batches have comparable ADCP and B cell depletion activities. 
The average of CDC activity seems to shift towards slightly lower levels during the development of the 
process  up  to  the  commercial  Process  C2,  with  a  trend  that  appears  diametrically  opposite  to  that 
observed  with  ADCC.  To  this  regard,  the  applicant  has  discussed  the  correlation  between  CDC  and 
galactosylation (total and / or sub-species) providing supportive data showing that there is no noticeable 
correlation  between  the  galactosylation  level  and  the  CDC  activity  for  ublituximab.  In  addition,  it  is 
clarified that the galactosylation level is inversely related to G0 and therefore is indirectly controlled by 
the specification limits of G0. 
For release and stability testing, an ADCC KILR assay that uses CD20 expressing Raji cells as target cells 
(CytoTox Glo is used to quantify cell lysis) has been optimised and validated. As a potency assay, the 
relative  potency  is  reported  using  RS-117808  as  the  primary  reference  standard.  Also  other  potency 
assays are included in the active substance specification: CDC activity, CD20 binding activity, FcγIIIRa 
binding by SPR, C1q binding by ELISA assays. Ublituximab samples were exposed to stress conditions 
(UV light treatment, high temperatures, low pH, high pH, freeze/ thaw cycling, oxidation, and agitation, 
using  GMP3b  (Process  B)  to  evaluate  the  potential  degradation  pathways  and  stability-indicating 
properties  of  analytical  methods.  Dimerisation,  backbone  cleavage,  hinge  region  disulfide  exchange, 
deamidation and oxidation were identified from these studies as the primary degradation pathways. The 
glycans remain unaffected by the stress conditions. Forced degraded samples have been characterised 
for their biological activity by multiple assays. The stressed stability potency testing results also indicate 
that  the  degradation  process  leads  to  concomitant  reduction  in  activities,  including  ADCC  and  CDC 
activities, as well as binding to CD20, FcγRIII and C1q. 
Impurities 
Process-related  impurities  and  product-related  impurities  have  been  adequately  characterised.  The 
information provided in the dossier is acceptable. Overall, the level of characterisation of ublituximab is 
adequate. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
Specifications 
The  active  substance  specification  include  control  of  identity,  purity  and  impurities  and  other  general 
tests. Overall the list of tests is in line with ICH Q6B, EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008 and Ph. Eur. Unique 
method identification numbers are included in specifications. 
The overall approach to establish and justify the commercial specifications for ublituximab were based 
on  reference  and  compendial  requirements,  the  knowledge  gained  from  process  development  and 
product  characterisation  studies  which  have  defined  CQAs,  an  understanding  of  the  manufacturing 
process  capabilities  and  processing  limits,  the  analytical  procedures  limitations  as  confirmed  through 
method validation, and the product stability profile. Statistical analysis was also performed.  
The  overall  approach  in  the  justification  of  specification  is  considered  acceptable.  The  specifications 
reflect approximately 2.5 to 3 standard deviations (SD) of the clinical experience and commercial batch 
dataset, resulting overall more adequate also in consideration of the consistency of the process. 
Module 3.2.S.4 appropriately points the active substance specification for release and shelf-life. However, 
it is noted that not all the tests proposed in the active substance release specifications are included in 
Assessment report  
EMA/173313/2023

stability studies, where 3 of the 5 potency assays are missing, including CD20 binding. This is generally 
justified. Reference is made to the finished product stability section. 
With  regard  to  the  size  exclusion  high  performance  liquid  chromatography  (SEC-HPLC)  method,  the 
applicant stated that the acceptable ranges reflect approximately 2.5-3 SD of the commercial datasets 
and  are  supported  by  the  clinical  experience.  The  applicant  revised  attributes  grouping  in  the  active 
substance release and specification.  
Regarding the absence of total galactosylated species in the specification, the applicant pointed out that 
the total galactosylation level is indirectly controlled by the specification limits of G0. The specification 
range  for  G0  provides  for  a  narrow  range  for  the  control  of  the  total  galactosylated  species.  This  is 
considered acceptable. 
Analytical procedures  
The  applicant  describes  all  analytical  procedures  used  for  active  substances  release  and  shelf-life 
analysis.  Compendial  methods  are  for  appearance,  osmolality,  pH,  bioburden,  endotoxin;  in-house 
methods are for: identity by peptide mapping, UV for protein concentration, for purity icIEF, SEC-HPLC, 
CGE  (reduced  and  non-reduced),  hydrophilic  interaction  ultra-performance  liquid  chromatography 
(HILIC-UPLC), two ELISA methods for HCP and Protein A, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) 
for DNA, for potency in-house ADCC, CDC, CD20 Binding Activity, FcγIIIRa binding by SPR, C1q binding 
by ELISA assays.  
The choice of procedures to measure respective attributes is appropriate. In-house methods descriptions 
are sufficient (with chromatograms, standard curves, dose response curves and system suitability test 
(SST) criteria).  
In-house methods (release and in-process) have been validated and compendial methods were qualified. 
The  applicant  provided  sufficient  method  transfers  data.  The  applicant  provided,  in  addition  to  the 
summary of validation criteria and results, the validation reports of experimental methods.  
To  support  the  selection  of  the  potency  assays  and  consistent  potency  control  throughout  product 
lifetime, the validation exercise demonstrated that the chosen cell-based potency assays for release and 
stability testing and relevant acceptance criteria are capable to detect subpotent batches.  
Several  methods  adaptations  were  introduced  during  development.  However,  the  data  used  for  the 
comparability exercise and for setting the specifications were either generated with the same assay or, 
when the versions of the assays were different, they were appropriately corrected before inclusion. To 
this regard, the applicant provided adequate information concerning the relevant conversion factors (for 
cIEF and SEC) derived from the evaluation of multiple active substance lots by means of previous and 
updated methods in order to ensure both data sets can be evaluated on a consistent basis. 
The rationale for the selection of stability-indicating methods, to be included in the stability specification 
panel, has been provided. 
Batch analysis  
Batch analysis data has been provided for all batches described in the dossier: from processes A, B1, 
B2/B3, C1, PPQ and C2 (in summary 66 batches). All batches were within specification and the data is 
corroborative and consistent across manufacturing runs. A summary of additional methods incorporated 
to batch assessment as well as changes associated with the historical development and release of the 
product are provided too.

Reference standard 
A  two-tiered  reference  standard  programme  is  proposed  from  lots  representative  of  production  and 
clinical materials to ensure consistency and continuity of the ublituximab quality.  
Preparation, characterisation and qualification of the current PRS is adequately described. The PRS will 
be used to qualify new working reference standards (WRS).  
Primary  reference  standard  is  well-characterised  and  qualified  by  testing  according  to  the  release 
specification  and  extensive  structural  characterisation  tests.  Results  are  provided.  .  The  certified 
standards are monitored via formal stability studies. Sufficient information of the container for reference 
standards  is  included.    The  primary  Reference  Standard  n  RS-117808-80  is  derived  from  batch  RS-
117808 (GMP16) manufactured with process C1. Tests results have been provided with respect to the 5 
potency assays to determine potency at active substance release.  
The applicant, as requested, tightened the PRS and WRS qualification acceptance criteria for icIEF, N-
glycan profile, ADCC, CDC, C1q binding by ELISA and CD20 binding activity.  
The  applicant  also  provided  the  lists  extended  characterisation  tests  (and  corresponding  acceptance 
criteria) for the qualification of future PRS and WRS. 
Container closure 
The  container  closure  system  (CCS)  for  ublituximab  is  Celsius  Flexible  Freeze  Thaw  (FFT)  bags  or 
equivalent.  They  are  single-use  multilayer  bags  with  a  product  contact  layer  of  EVA  (ethylene  vinyl 
acetate)  copolymer  and  an  outer  layer  of  EVOH  (ethylene  vinyl  alcohol).  Container  specification  is 
registered in 3.2.S.6 section.  
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
A preliminary shelf life of 36 months is proposed. Stability programme is in accordance with ICH Q5C. 
The stability data for ublituximab include 36-month data for three registration stability studies for the 
active substance batches manufactured with Process C2. In addition, up to 60 months of stability data 
for  five  active  substance  batches  from  process  C1,  B3  and  B2, as  well  as  one  active  substance  batch 
from Process B1 are also presented as supportive studies. All stability results met the acceptance criteria 
at the intended storage condition. The applicant concluded that  overall data  support the  proposed 36 
months of shelf life for commercial ublituximab active substance at the intended storage condition.  
No  statistical  analysis  of  stability  data  has  been  provided,  since  the  proposed  commercial  active 
substance shelf life of 36 months is based on actual 36-month long-term intended storage condition data 
of the three registration batches and no trend was observed on any attribute.  
Bioburden and endotoxins are added in future time points in the three registration stability studies (48 
and 60 months). 
The stability specifications do not include CD20 (see above). Conversely, forced degradation study results 
experimentally supported that N-glycan method is not stability-indicating.  
The supportive stability studies used different container closure system (30mL Nalgene polycarbonate 
bottles with 25 mL fill) from the registration stability studies (30mL Celsius bags). 
Overall, the proposed shelf life of 36 months is agreed.

2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Description of the product 
Briumvi is presented as a concentrate for solution for infusion for IV administration. It is a sterile solution 
containing  150  mg  of  ublituximab  in  6  mL  (concentration  25  mg/mL).  The  final  concentration  after 
dilution is approximately 0.6 mg/mL for the first infusion and 1.8 mg/mL for the second infusion and all 
subsequent infusions. 
The  CCS  is  a  single-use  Type  I,  colourless  glass  vial  with  siliconised  chlorobutyl  rubber  stoppers  that 
contain a barrier film and sealed with aluminum caps with a plastic button.  
The finished product excipients are sodium chloride, sodium citrate, polysorbate 80, hydrochloric acid, 
water for injections. 
Ublituximab  is  a  colourless  to  slightly  yellow,  clear  to  opalescent,  essentially  particle  free  liquid. 
Ublituximab active substance is manufactured to include the final formulation excipients and is ready-
to-fill during finished product manufacture. The osmolality and pH of the product are compatible with an 
intravenous route of administration. PS80 is included in the active substance formulation as a stabiliser 
to  prevent  IgG  aggregation  during  freezing,  storage  and  thawing  of  the  active  substance  and 
manufacturing, storage, and shipping of the finished product.  
All excipients comply with USP and Ph. Eur. requirements. No excipient of animal or human origin is used 
in the formulation of ublituximab. 
Pharmaceutical development 
Formulation  development  has  been  clearly  described.  Initial  formulation  development  was  performed 
targeting the 10 mg/mL ublituximab concentration (the product concentration chosen for initial clinical 
trials) with a long-term storage at 5°C for both active substance and finished product. Excipients were 
chosen  based  on  previous  experience  with  development  of  IgG1  antibodies.  Antibody  product  quality 
was  evaluated  during  these  initial  studies  using  a  variety  of  physiochemical  methods  to  select  the 
formulation that provided the best product stability under stress conditions such as high temperature, 
agitation, and oxidation. The development results confirmed the suitability of buffer and excipient. The 
objective of the 25 mg/mL formulation was to provide a higher product concentration more suitable for 
frozen storage of active substance and smaller finished product vials. Results from the freeze/thaw and 
thermal stability studies provide confirmation that the 25 mg/mL formulation is suitable for use at the 
active substance and finished product intended storage conditions.  
Following  a  major  objection  during  the  procedure,  the  applicant  provided  a  detailed  description  of 
manufacturing  process  development.  Obtained  results  have  been  summarised  in  tabular  form. 
Manufacturing process development data is in line with ICH Q8. The applicant amended manufacturing 
development section with information on the choice of critical parameters impacting product performance 
and on control of these parameters.  
The ublituximab container closure system consists of a Type I borosilicate vial closed with a siliconised 
rubber stopper. The stopper contains a FluroTec coating on the product contact surface. The flip-off seal 
consists  of  aluminium  and  polypropylene.  The  container  closure  system  has  been  discussed  and 
extractable and leachable studies have been performed and the adopted methodology and the selection 
of used solvents adequately justified. No overfill has been defined. According to the specification each 
vial should contain ≥6.0 mL of solution.

Ublituximab injection for IV administration is manufactured as sterile single use vials. Vials are washed 
and depyrogenated prior to use. Stoppers are received ready to use from the supplier. Details on the 
stopper sterilisation method and cycle have been included in relevant CTD sections. Seals are received 
ready to sterilise from the supplier and they are steam sterilised at the finished product manufacturer 
prior to use. Prior to filling in sterile, depyrogenated vials, ublituximab is sterilised by filtration.  
Compatibility studies for ublituximab administration have been performed. Ublituximab injection for IV 
administration was prepared by dilution into different sterile diluents, including normal saline and 5% 
dextrose.  Polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC)  and  polyolefin  (PO)  infusion  bags  and  intravenous  lines  have  been 
studied. Administration with or without an in-line 0.2 μm filter was tested. Ublituximab is stable up to 
flow rates of 500 mL/hour.  
The applicant has presented data to justify the use of in-line filters. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturing process and process controls 
SBL is responsible for finished product manufacture. Millmount Healthcare, Block 7, City North Business 
Campus, Stamullen, Co. Meath, Ireland K32 YD60 is responsible for final EU release. It was confirmed 
that all sites involved in manufacture and quality control of the finished product operate in accordance 
with EU GMP. 
The  manufacturing  process  of 
the 
finished  product  consists  of 
the 
following  steps: 
Sterilisation/Depyrogenation  of  Primary  Container  Closure  and  Processing  Components,  Thawing  of 
Active substance, Filtration, Pooling, and Mixing of Active substance, Sterile Filtration, Filling, Stoppering 
and Capping, Visual Inspection and Bulk Packaging, Labelling and Secondary Packaging. 
Manufacturing process as well as its control has been described in sufficient details. Major equipment 
has been specified. 
Process validation 
Process validation data have been presented.  
It  has  been  stated  that  holding  time  studies  has  been  performed  on  one  batch.  Other  two  validation 
batches  were  manufactured  using  parameters  within  acceptable  ranges.  Batches  used  in  hold  time 
studies have been clearly characterised. 
The manufacturing process and the cleanliness level adopted during filtration, pooling and mixing of the 
Active  substance  (Grade  C)  and  during  the  final  sterile  filtration  and  filling  operation  of  the  Finished 
product (Grade A with Grade B background) is found adequate. In fact, active substance Bag Pooling 
and Sampling as well as active substance Bag Mixing take place in Grade C environment. Once in the 
mixing bag, the system remains closed with sterile-to-sterile closed-system connectors up to the filling 
needles in the Grade A RABS. A pre-sterilised disposable transfer line is passed from the Grade B vial 
filling room to the pooling bag located in Grade D, found acceptable as at this stage the system is closed 
and aseptic connectors are used. 
The process validation on the 4 PPQ lots cover the range for active substance thawing time. The active 
substance thawing is limited to the thawing time challenged.  
The  impact  of  transport  on  product  quality  and  integrity  was  assessed  through  real  time  shipping 
validation studies performed at a minimum and maximum shipment load (and storage conditions).   
Assessment report  
EMA/173313/2023  
Page 25/129 
 
 
 
 
Module  3.2.P.3.5  includes  data  and  summaries  of  the  shipping  validation  studies  performed  on  the 
finished  product.  These  studies  included  shipping  of  the  finished  product  from  the  manufacturer, 
Samsung Biologics in South Korea, to a secondary packaging facility in the United States (US), then on 
to a storage/distribution depot also in the US. Over the course of shipping, the product was exposed to 
the challenges associated with both air and ground transportation. The studies involved both minimum 
and  maximum  loading  conditions  and  were  executed  during  both  summer  and  winter  to  challenge 
environmental temperature extremes. The studies evaluated chemical and biological activity stability of 
the product through analytical testing following shipping execution. In addition, physical attributes were 
evaluated  which  included  thermal  monitoring,  primary  container/closure  integrity  testing,  and 
secondary/tertiary packaging conditions. Data from the studies indicate that the supply chain controls 
for the shipping of ublituximab were sufficient to protect the product chemical and physical attributes. 
The risk of product shipping routes to Europe were evaluated. 
Overall, finished product process validation is considered satisfactory. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
Specifications  
Specifications for the finished product include control of identity, purity and impurity, potency and other 
general tests. In general, the panel of tests are in line with ICH Q6B. 
Detailed justification of the proposed specification has been presented.  
The exclusion of CD20 binding from the finished product release specifications was not endorsed, since 
essential  to  monitor  the  'selectivity  of  action'  of  ublituximab  (which  is  key  in  the  mode  of  action  and 
underlies the cell lysis measured in the ADCC and CDC assays). The applicant revised the specification 
to include CD20 binding at release. This may be reconsidered once an appropriate amount of data will 
be  collected  post-approval  by  the  applicant.  Any  revision  of  the  specification  would  require  the 
submission of an appropriate variation application.  
No shelf life specification for CD20 binding is included, which is acceptable for the marketing authorisation 
application and reference is made to the finished product stability section. 
The acceptance criteria for appearance in Module 3.2.P.5.1 has been aligned with the Ph. Eur. Monograph 
as  well  as  the  acceptance  criteria  on  colour  and  opalescence.  In  addition,  the  acceptance  criteria  for 
extractable Volume have been updated in Module 3.2.P.5.1 to 6.0-6.5 mL. 
The  applicant  provided  the  description  of  the  characterisation  method  used  to  assess  the  variation  of 
PS80 composition from lot to lot, due to a possible degradation. It was agreed not to include PS80 in the 
release testing panel for active substance and finished product. However, the applicant will implement 
and validate an HPLC analytical method to measure PS80 concentration for ublituximab finished product 
at release and stability (see CHMP Recommendations). 
Analytical procedures 
Compendial analytical procedures follow the current edition of the referenced pharmacopeia. For non-
compendial  analytical  methods  already  presented  in  the  active  substance  section,  corresponding 
reference has been provided, what is acceptable. The container closure integrity test (CCIT), performed 
by Dye Penetration as IPC for finished product samples, has been described. 
Non-compendial methods used for release and stability testing of ublituximab are the same as the non-
compendial methods used for release testing of ublituximab. The analytical qualification results provided 
Assessment report  
EMA/173313/2023  
Page 26/129 
 
 
 
in Module 3.2.S.4.3 for ublituximab active substance are also applicable for the finished product. Method 
validation report for CCIT has been provided.  
Characterisation of impurities 
Adequate information on potential impurities has been presented. A summary of the outcome of the Risk 
Analysis  on  elemental  impurities  performed  in  line  with  ICH  Q3D  guideline  (currently  Ph.  Eur. 
requirement) has been provided. A risk assessment concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities 
in  the  product  has  been  submitted  by  the  applicant  in  Module  1  and  the  outcome  of  nitrosamine  risk 
assessment has been also presented in sections 3.2.P.5.5 and 3.2.P.5.6. No issue has been identified 
and no specific controls are deemed necessary. 
Batch analysis 
Batch  analysis  data  for  over  50  finished  product  batches  have  been  presented,  corresponding  to  all 
ublituximab completed GMP and development batches made to date including active substance batches 
and their corresponding finished product lots. 
Reference standard 
The reference standards for finished product are the same as used for active substance testing. 
Container closure system 
The primary packaging consists of a Type I borosilicate vial closed with a siliconised rubber stopper. The 
outer  packaging  is  cardboard  box.  Specifications  and  representative  certificates  of  analyses  for  each 
element  of  primary  packaging  has  been  presented.  Manufacturers  of  each  component  of  primary 
packaging have been defined. The stoppers are steam sterilised and are received only ready to use from 
the  supplier.  Details  on  the  stopper  sterilisation  method  and  cycle  have  been  provided.  Stoppers  are 
steam sterilised by the supplier in an autoclave with a minimum temperature of 121°C for a minimum 
of 15 minutes (in accordance with Ph. Eur. 5.1.1). The name and address of the site of sterilisation is 
available. 
Analytical procedures used during control of primary packaging have been described.  
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 3 years when stored at 2-8°C protected from light is claimed. 
36 month stability data at 5°C (2-8°C) for three registration stability studies for the 150 mg finished 
product  batches  manufactured  at  SBL  from  the  commercial  process,  accompanied  with  6-month 
accelerated  and  stressed  stability  data  (25°C/60%  RH  and  40°C/75%  RH)  have  been  provided.  In 
addition,  36  months  of  data  for  ten  batches  at  5°C  (2-8°C),  supported  by  6-month  accelerated  and 
stressed  stability  data  (25°C/60%  RH  and  40°C/75%  RH)  have  been  also  presented  as  supportive 
studies. The data are trended and compared. Also photostability data have been presented. Photostability 
data show that the finished product is sensitive to high level of visible light and UV exposure.  
Binding  assays,  particularly  towards  CD20,  are  essential  to  monitor  the  'selectivity  of  action'  of 
ublituximab (which is key in the mode of action and underlies the cell lysis measured in the ADCC and 
CDC assays). The applicant provided as requested a full panel of data including 5 lots of finished product 
stored at 5°C for up to 36 months to show that there is no direct indication of CD20 instability at any 
condition of normal storage or use of the finished product. The data provided do not call for comment 
and in the context of this MAA it is agreed not to include CD20 binding in the shelf-life specification. 
Assessment report  
EMA/173313/2023  
Page 27/129 
 
 
 
The applicant committed to enlarge the CD20-binding database for finished product release and stability 
data for the 3 ongoing finished product stability batches, in order to evaluate any change on this attribute 
and the eventual lack of correlation with ADCC and CDC (see CHMP Recommendations). 
Overall,  thirty-six  months  shelf  life  for  ublituximab  finished  product  at  the  storage  condition  of  2-8ºC 
protected from light is considered acceptable. 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2-8°C and subsequently 
for 8 hours at room temperature.  
From  a  microbiological  point  of  view,  the  prepared  infusion  should  be  used  immediately.  If  not  used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would 
normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2-8°C and subsequently for 8 hours at room temperature, unless 
dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
2.4.3.5.  Post approval change management protocol(s) 
Not applicable.  
2.4.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
Controlled sourcing of raw materials is the primary defence against introducing causative agents of TSE 
and BSE in the manufacturing process. The use of animal materials (no animal derived materials except 
cell line) is compliant with the effective version of EMA/410/01. Active substance and finished product 
therefore pose minimal/negligible risk for transmission of TSE and BSE. 
Extensive testing for endogenous and adventitious viral agents has been conducted for the expression 
cell lines, MCBs and WCBs and EPCB to ensure that the cell banks are free from detectable adventitious 
viral contamination. 
Bulk harvest is tested for the absence of mycoplasma, adventitious viruses (using several in vitro virus 
assay indicator cell clines). This is in line with ICH Q5A. 
Bulk  testing  is  performed  on  the  production  bioreactor  as  an  IPC  during  production  of  each  lot 
confirmation of the presence of infectious adventitious agent will lead to lot rejection.  
The  ublituximab  purification  process  includes  several  steps  for  virus  reduction.  Two  viral  validation 
studies reports have been provided, both covering the entire manufacturing process. The studies used 
four model viruses: Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus (XMuLV), Minute Virus of Mice (MVM), Reovirus 
(REO-3),  and  Pseudorabies  Virus  (PRV).  They  cover  a  range  of  virus  characteristics  on  scaled-down 
models  including  Protein  A  chromatography,  solvent  detergent  viral  inactivation,  anion  exchange 
membrane  chromatography,  and  viral  filtration.  Inhibition,  toxicity  and  interference  testing  were 
performed before the study. Scale-down models were also assessed for their representativeness. Virus 
reduction  factors  for  the  four  model  viruses  demonstrate  a  robust  viral  clearance  capability  for  the 
manufacturing  process.  According  to  the  ICH  Q5A  guideline,  the  applicant  provided  a  calculation  of 
estimated  particles  per  dose,  considering  the  limit  of  detection  (LOD)  of  the  transmission  electronic 
microscopy (TEM) method used to reveal any presence of retrovirus-like particles (RVLP). The average 
endogenous virus-like particles found in the unprocessed bulk samples from three representative runs is 
reduced to significantly less than 2 particles in a million doses (TEM results).  
Overall, these data support that the viral safety of ublituximab finished product for commercial use is 
according to ICH Q5A. 
Assessment report

The  applicant  provided  demonstration  of  the  robustness  of  viral  clearance  of  reused  columns  where 
applicable. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The provided Module 3 dossier is well-structured and divided into active substance and finished product 
parts, followed by Appendices and Regional Information. The dossier was updated satisfactorily following 
questions asked during the procedure.  
No additional issues that would trigger a GMP inspection have been identified during the assessment of 
the information in the Module 3, all GMP issues were properly addressed. 
In response to a major objection raised during the procedure on the active substance process control 
strategy, the applicant provided a justification about the selected CQAs and CPPs. Risk assessments were 
provided. The rationale provided along with the support of scale-down studies (SDM) studies and process 
characterisation reports presented, is considered adequate to justify the choice of CQAs and CPPs. 
The applicant adequately addressed comparability issues (Major Objection) raised during the procedure. 
Following a major objection raised during the procedure, the applicant provided a detailed description of 
finished product manufacturing process development. Obtained results have been summarised in tabular 
format.  Manufacturing  process  development  data  is  in  line  with  ICH  Q8.  The  applicant  amended 
manufacturing  development  section  with  information  on  the  choice  of  critical  parameters  impacting 
product performance and on control of these parameters.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Ublituximab is a recombinant IgG1 chimeric monoclonal antibody which binds to CD20. Ublituximab is 
produced  in  the  rat  cell  line  YB2/0.  This  cell  line  has  reduced  levels  of  fucosyl-transferase  activity 
resulting in antibody glycoforms incorporating less fucose content. 
This submission document deals with the properties of ublituximab that support its use in the treatment 
of  RMS  through  IV  administration.  Moreover,  other  anti-CD20  mAbs  (rituximab,  obinutuzumab, 
ofatumumab and ocrelizumab), some of those (ofatumumab and ocrelizumab) already approved for the 
treatment of MS, are used as comparators. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Ublituximab  was  evaluated  in  a  series  of  in  vitro  studies  that  determined  the  binding  and  activity  of 
ublituximab  primarily  using  cancer  derived  cell  lines  (Table  1).  In  the  majority  of  these  studies,  the 
activity of ublituximab was compared to that of rituximab, the first-in-class anti-CD20 therapeutic mAb, 
and  other  anti-CD20  mAbs  such  as  ofatumumab  and  obinutuzumab.  In  vitro  pharmacology  studies 
evaluated  target-binding  properties,  functional  activity  (i.e.,  ADCC,  antibody-dependent  cellular 
phagocytosis [ADCP], and CDC) in cell-based assays, as well as B-cell depletion in whole blood samples. 
Ublituximab recognises and binds to a novel human epitope on the CD20 antigen that is apparently not 
targeted  by  other  anti-CD20  mAbs  on  the  market,  including  ocrelizumab  and  ofatumumab  which  are 
approved for the treatment of RMS. Ublituximab binds to its CD20 target antigen with a low nanomolar 
affinity  that  is  similar  to  that  of  rituximab.  The  Fc  region  of  ublituximab  binds  to  Fc  receptors  with  a 
higher affinity than rituximab, conferring a more robust effector cell response than rituximab in measures 
of ADCC, ADCP, and B-cell depletion. The difference in Fc receptor affinity is especially evident at low 
antibody concentrations where effector functions triggered by Fc binding demonstrate that ublituximab 
is more effective than rituximab in promoting target cell lysis. 
In measures of ADCC, ublituximab induced higher cytotoxicity when compared to rituximab, ocrelizumab, 
and ofatumumab. In functional CDC assays, ublituximab results were comparable to those of rituximab 
at high antibody concentrations but were slightly weaker when submaximal concentrations of antibodies 
were  added.  Ublituximab  and  rituximab  mediated  ADCP  similarly.  The  reduced  levels  of  fucose  in 
ublituximab glycosylation of the human IgG1-Fc-portion is claimed to be associated to the higher ADCC 
vs ocrelizumab> ofatumumab> rituximab observed on lymphoblast-like Raji cells and on NK cells.   
Both ADCC and CDC contributed to B-cell depletion in whole blood. In whole blood from healthy human 
donors,  ublituximab  was  more  effective  in  depleting  B  cells  than  rituximab  and  ofatumumab  at  low 
concentrations.  When  high  concentrations  of  the  antibodies  were  tested,  ublituximab,  rituximab,  and 
ofatumumab generally resulted in similar levels of B-cell depletion.

the  activity  of  ublituximab  was  comparable  with  that  of  rituximab  (10  mg/kg).  This  efficacy  could  be 
mediated by several mechanisms: ADCC mediated by NK cells and/or macrophages, CDC or apoptosis.  
Ublituximab administered at lower doses of 1 and 0.1 mg/kg probably does not involve the complement 
pathway as the clearance profile observed in the SCID-NOD mice was comparable to that observed in 
the SCID mice. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The  cross-reactivity  of  ublituximab  across  a  wide  range  of  normal  human  and  cynomolgus  monkey 
tissues was assessed. Monkeys share 97% CD20 protein sequence homology compared with the naturally 
occurring human sequence. 
Ublituximab tissue cross-reactivity was evaluated using validated immunohistochemical staining method. 
A direct staining method was implemented using an avidin-biotin peroxidase complex to detect bound 
ublituximab that is complexed with the secondary antibody (goat antihuman IgG biotin). Staining was 
evaluated using human tissue from tonsil, heart, lymph node, and spleen. Human tonsil was selected as 
the CD20 positive control tissue, and human heart was selected as the CD20 negative control tissue to 
be used in the tissue cross-reactivity studies.  
Normal human tissues: immunostaining was minimal to moderate in the thymus, tonsil, lymph nodes 
and  spleen,  minimal  to  mild  in  the  small  and  large  intestines  and  minimal  in  the  prostate,  uterus 
(endometrium)  and  parotid  salivary  gland.  Ublituximab  showed  binding  to  tissues  known  to  express 
CD20. The distribution of the staining demonstrated that the test item is binding specifically to its target 
and no other tissues. 
Normal cynomolgus monkey tissues: positive staining to ublituximab was observed in lymphoid follicles 
in the lymph node, lung and spleen. The intensity was graded from mild to moderate and the distribution 
was considered diffuse in all cases. No specific staining was observed in the rest of the tissues evaluated. 
Lymphoid follicles are present in the outer cortex of lymph nodes, the splenic white pulp and lymphoid 
associate tissue. Lymphoid follicles are the site of B cell proliferation. CD20 is a B cell integral protein 
expressed  specifically  on  B  cells.  The  lack  of  staining  outside  the  lymphoid  follicles  indicates  the 
ublituximab is not cross reacting with other tissues evaluated in this study. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No  stand-alone  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted.  As  ublituximab  demonstrates  high 
specificity for its target, safety pharmacology endpoints, including cardiovascular, CNS and respiratory, 
were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys as part of the pivotal 4-week, 13-week and 26-week repeat-
dose toxicity studies. Throughout the non-clinical dossier, the applicant refers to ICH S9 guideline. This 
could be valid for the initial sought indication of ublituximab non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Since the current 
application is for ublituximab in the treatment of MS, the ICH S6 guideline should be the reference. 
There were no observed clinical findings concerning cardiac, respiratory, or CNS safety pharmacology in 
the general toxicology studies. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Due to the high binding specificity of ublituximab to human CD20, a transmembrane protein expressed 
on  the  surface  of  cells  of  B  lineage  origin,  it  is  stated  to  be  unlikely  that  ublituximab  is  having 
pharmacodynamic  (PD)  interactions  with  co-administered  drugs.  Ublituximab  is  recommended  as  a 
single-agent treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/173313/2023  
Page 33/129 
 
 
 
No non-clinical PD drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies were performed.  
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  toxicokinetics  (TK)  of  ublituximab  were  assessed  in  rabbits  and  in 
cynomolgus monkeys, respectively. Rabbits and monkeys share a high CD20 protein sequence homology 
compared with the naturally occurring human CD20 sequence (80% and 97%, respectively). The studies 
were  performed  by  the  intravenous  (IV)  route  which  is  intended  clinical  route  of  ublituximab’  s 
administration.   
All bioanalytical methods for the detection of ublituximab and antidrug antibodies were based on ligand-
binding assays. The bioanalytical methods were developed and adequately validated. Incurred sample 
reanalyses  (ISR)  performed  in  support  of  the  GLP-compliant  toxicology  studies  No.  20264749, 
20083321, 20083322 met predefined reproducibility criteria for all assays in all studies. GLP toxicology

prior 
to 
the 
adoption 
of 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009  Rev.  1  Corr.  2**  Guideline  on  Bioanalytical  Method  Validation  and 
therefore ISR was not conducted. 
Absorption and Distribution 
Single-dose and repeated toxicity studies 
In  rabbit  and  monkey  single-dose  studies,  ublituximab  demonstrated  a  bi-compartmental  elimination 
profile. After a single IV administration to male New Zealand rabbits, ublituximab concentrations declined 
in a bi-exponential fashion. The mean maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-
time  curve  (AUC)  from  time  0  to  648  hours  after  dosing  (AUC0-648hr)  were  261  ug/mL  and  14700 
ug•hr/mL, respectively. The mean systemic clearance (CL)was 0.8 mL/hr/kg, with an apparent terminal 
elimination  (t½)  of  96.5  hours.  The  mean  volume  of  distribution  (Vd)  was  100  mL/kg  which  is 
approximately 2× the plasma volume.  
After a single IV administration to monkeys, the exposure increased in a greater than dose-proportional 
manner between doses of 0.3 and 10 mg/kg, and in an approximately dose proportional manner between 
doses of 10 and 100 mg/kg, suggesting target-Mediated Drug Disposition. The male and female average 
n AUC from time 0 to last time point (AUC0-t) was 80.2, 15000, and 162000 ug•hr/mL, respectively, for 
0.3,  10,  and  100  mg/kg,  while  the  Cmax  was  6.5,  239,  and  2200  ug/mL,  respectively.  The  male  and 
female average CL at 10 mg/kg was 0.660 mL/hr/kg with an t½ of 58.2 hours. The male and female 
average Vd at 10 mg/kg was 55.1 mL/kg. No evidence of sex effect was observed. 
In  a  4-week  repeat-dose  toxicity  study,  following  the  weekly  IV  administration  of  10  or  50  mg/kg  of 
ublituximab for 4 weeks, the Cmax and AUC increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner. On 
Day  22,  the  AUC0-t  and  Cmax  were  increased  in  a  greater  than  dose-proportional  manner.  In  general, 
neither drug accumulation nor sex effect was apparent.  
In the 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study, following IV administration of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg ublituximab 
in 6 doses of 13 weeks, the Cmax and AUC from time 0 to 144 hours after dosing (AUC0-144h) increased in 
an approximately dose-proportional manner across the doses. Dose proportionality on Day 78 could not 
be  accurately  assessed  due  to  immunogenicity-mediated  accelerated  clearance.  Neither  drug 
accumulation nor sex differences in exposure were apparent.  
In the 26-week repeat-dose toxicity study, following weekly IV administration of 30 mg/kg ublituximab 
for 26 weeks, slight drug accumulation was noted. No sex differences in exposure were apparent.

TK parameters for anti-drug antibody (ADA) positive and ADA negative animals were reported separately 
to assess the impact of immunogenicity.  
ADA positive and ADA negative monkeys had comparable Cmax values (ranged from 913 to 1203 μg/mL) 
after the first and seventh doses. The AUC0-t values (ranged from 47100 to 58200 μg•hr/mL) for the ADA 
positive and ADA negative monkeys were also comparable after the first dose. After the seventh repeat 
dose, however, the AUC0-t values were decreased in the ADA positive animals compared to those in the 
ADA  negative  animals,  suggesting  accelerated  clearance  due  to  the  immune  response.  The  drug 
accumulation ratio ranged from 1.25 to 1.60 in ADA negative animals and from 0.296 to 0.985 in ADA 
positive animals.  
Comparing the exposures to non-pregnant monkeys in the 13-week and 26-week studies, the AUC0-t in 
the pregnant monkeys after the first dose were approximately 30%higher (55900±8790 in Set A and 
52600±6550 in Set B vs. 42900±4420 ug•hr/mL in 13-week study), which may be associated with study 
variability.  
Infant  monkeys  appeared  to  have  30%  higher  ublituximab  levels  than  those  of  the  corresponding 
mothers, with infant-to-maternal concentration ratios of ublituximab ranging from 3.53 to 10.4 on post-
partum day 14.  
Distribution 
IV administered ublituximab is expected to selectively bind to the CD20 antigen expressed on B cells. 
The Vd of ublituximab in monkeys varied from dose to dose, ranging from 46.2 to 105 mL/kg, which is 
approximately 2 times the plasma volume in monkeys. 
No  conventional  distribution  studies  using  radiolabelled  ublituximab  were  conducted  in  pregnant 
monkeys (e.g. protein binding or whole-body autoradiography). This is considered acceptable according 
to ICHS6(R1).  
Metabolism 
No  metabolism  studies  were  performed  on  ublituximab.  Monoclonal  antibodies  are  expected  to  be 
metabolised in the same manner as endogenous antibodies. This is acceptable according to ICHS6(R1). 
Excretion 
Similar  to  metabolism,  modes  of  excretion  are  anticipated  to  be  similar  to  endogenous  antibodies 
(proteolysis protected by Fc-Rn receptor). Studies of excretion is therefore not necessary. 
No  level  of  ublituximab  was  measured  in  the  milk  of  monkey  after  parturition  in  the  ePPND  study  in 
monkeys. 
Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction 
PK DDI studies with ublituximab were not conducted. Ublituximab does not undergo classical metabolic 
reactions involving the superfamily of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes. Hence, co-medication with 
CYP  isoenzyme  substrates,  inducers  or  inhibitors  is  not  expected  to  result  in  clinically  relevant 
pharmacokinetics drug interactions. No information currently exists to suggest that CD20 can modulate 
expression  of  CYP  enzymes  or  transporter  proteins.  Since  ublituximab  is  highly  specific  for  CD20  and 
does  not  bind  to  any  other  proteins/macromolecules,  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  it  will  either  directly  or 
indirectly (by affecting CD20 function) modulate CYP or transporter expression. 
Immunogenicity in monkeys 
Ublituximab was immunogenic to monkeys. This is expected, since it is a human chimeric monoclonal -
antibody homolog and is directed at cell surface marker which undergo internalisation.

After a single administration, the incidence of ADA positive was 100% at 0.3 mg/kg, while there was no 
ADA positive signal observed at 10 and 100 mg/kg.  
In the 4-week study, the incidence of monkeys with ADA positive was 100% at 10 mg/kg and 17% at 
50 mg/kg.  
In the 13-week study, the incidence of ADA positive was 100%, 80%, and 70%, respectively, at 3, 10, 
and 30 mg/kg/dose.  
In the 26-week repeat-dose toxicity study the incidence of ADA positive was 90% (9 out of 10) at 30 
mg/kg.  The  incidence  of  ADA  at  specific  timepoints  was  9  out  of  10  animals  at  Week  4,  6  out  of  10 
animals at Week 8, and 2 out of 9 animals at Weeks 12, 18 and 26. At Weeks 12, 18, and 26, ADA was 
seen  in  the  same  2  animals  at  each  timepoint  indicating  a  sustained  response  that  correlated  with 
reduced exposure. All other animals experienced a transient ADA response which did not impact exposure 
to ublituximab and clearance. 
In ePPND study, the incidence of ADA positive in pregnant monkeys ranged from 44% to 100% across 
treatment Sets A, B and C. In the infant monkeys, the incidence of ADA+ was 25% (2 of 8). 
Overall, the finding of ADA positive animals correlated closely with the decreased exposure observed in 
TK parameters and with the re-emergence of peripheral B cells. 
Immunogenicity-mediated  accelerated  clearance  at  low  doses  was  observed,  which  led  to  exposure 
reduction. The phenomenon was more profound at the low dose groups (e.g., ≤10 mg/kg) relative to the 
high  dose  groups  (e.g.,  ≥30  mg/kg).  However,  an  immune  response  cannot  be  ruled  out  for  the  high 
dose groups because high ublituximab concentrations in circulation interfere with the ability of the assay 
to detect ADA. The immunogenicity observed in non-human primates, however, provides limited value 
in predicting an immune response against a therapeutic protein in humans. 
In toxicity studies, immunogenicity-mediated accelerated clearance at low doses was observed, which 
led to exposure reduction However, at high dose groups (30 and 50 mg/kg) ublituximab exposure was 
maintained, allowing for adequate evaluation of ublituximab treatment-related toxicities. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
Monkey toxicity studies were all performed according to GLP in France or in USA. Local tolerance study 
in rabbit and the bacterial reverse mutation assay, were not (entirely) performed under GLP as stated 
by  the  applicant;  however,  since  they  are  not  considered  pivotal  for  the  marketing  authorisation 
application, this is considerable acceptable. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
After a single dose of ublituximab administered IV to cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 0.3, 10, or 100 
mg/kg, ublituximab was generally well tolerated at all dose levels evaluated. Ublituximab was considered 
to be well tolerated at the injection sites at all dose-levels tested. No mortality and no relevant clinical 
signs were observed at any dose-level tested. No effects on body weight or food consumption were noted 
at any dose-level tested. A dose-related lower white blood cell count mainly due to a dose-related lower 
lymphocyte count were recorded on day 15 in control and treated animals (pharmacological effect of the 
test item). A moderate increase of the fibrinogen concentration was observed at the high dose-level in 
both sexes, but was considered not related to the test item. No blood biochemistry findings were noted 
on day 15 in any treated group. At necropsy on day 15, lower absolute and relative thymus weights were 
recorded  in  males  at  all  dose-levels  and  in  females  at  10  or  100  mg/kg,  effects  consistent  with  the 
expected pharmacological effects of the test item.

In animals treated with ublituximab at 0.3 mg/kg, ADA were detected in all of the animals on Day 14. 
In general, ADA were not detected at doses of 10 or 100 mg/kg on Day 14; however, these results are 
not reliable due to possible ublituximab interference in the assay. 
Immunophenotyping demonstrated significant B-lymphocyte depletion in the peripheral blood, starting 
at 24 hours after treatment in all 3 ublituximab dose levels. Evaluation of the lymph nodes, spleen, and 
bone marrow on Day 15 showed a decrease in the proportion of B lymphocytes among the nucleated 
cells (CD45+) in these tissues in all 3 ublituximab dose levels. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Ublituximab-related findings in repeat-dose toxicity studies included expected decreases in lymphocyte 
count and corresponding changes in lymphoid tissue, thymus, spleen, and bone marrow. In the 4-week 
GLP toxicity study treatment-related mortality was observed in 1 female monkey administered with 50 
mg/kg. No recovery period was included. This female was euthanised on Day 20 after showing* clinical 
signs of marked dehydration, pallor of the lip mucosa, hypothermia (body temperature less than 34°C), 
hypoactivity, prostration, body weight loss starting on Day 15, and markedly reduced food consumption. 
The  clinical  deterioration  observed  in  this  immuno-depressed  animal  in  the  presence  of  moderate 
modifications of the hepatic parenchyma led to the premature sacrifice of this animal. Similarly, body 
weight  loss  secondary  to  decreased  food  consumption  with  correlative  changes  in  haematology  and 
clinical chemistry parameters was observed at 50 mg/kg.  
The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in the 4-week repeat-dose study was 10 mg/kg, with a 
male and female average AUC0-168hr of 318 μg•hr/mL and Cmax of 129 μg/mL on Day 22.  
In the 13-week repeat-dose study, ublituximab was tolerated up to 30 mg/kg, which was the highest 
dose  evaluated.  Six-month  recovery  period  was  included.  One  female  monkey  dosed  with  10  mg/kg 
ublituximab  was  prematurely  sacrificed  due  to  suspected  spontaneous  cardiomyopathy,  which  was 
considered unrelated to ublituximab treatment. Histopathological findings in this female were consistent 
with spontaneous cardiomyopathy. Clinical signs associated with ublituximab administration in the 13-
week repeat-dose study included liquid feces in females dosed with 30 mg/kg ublituximab and occasional 
vomitus  following  dosing  at  3  and  10  mg/kg.  The  microscopic  findings  at  terminal  euthanasia  were 
observed  in  the  mandibular  and  mesenteric  lymph  nodes  and  spleen,  which  were  consistent  with  the 
pharmacological activity of ublituximab. The microscopic findings consisted of decreased germinal centre 
development and decreased size and number of the follicles. The lymphoid follicles located in the cortex 
of the mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes and the spleen of affected animals were reduced in size 
primarily due to a decrease in germinal centre development. The NOAEL was 30 mg/kg, with a male and 
female combined average AUC of 23400 μg•hr/mL and Cmax of 556 μg/mL on Day 78. 
In  the  26-week  repeat-dose  study,  ublituximab  was  tolerated  at  30  mg/kg,  which  was  the  only  dose 
evaluated. No recovery period was included. A female monkey dosed with 30 mg/kg was found dead on 
Day  50  due  to  pulmonary  haemorrhage  secondary  to  ADA  related  immune-mediated  hypersensitivity 
reaction. Clinical signs associated with ublituximab administration included liquid faeces and 2 instances 
of infusion related reactions. Microscopic findings consisted of changes in lymphoid tissue consistent with 
the  pharmacologic  activity  of  ublituximab.  Additionally,  several  animals  exhibited  mononuclear  cell 
infiltration in the CNS and eye as well as vascular/perivascular inflammation in various tissues that were 
attributed by the study director to an immune-mediated toxicity secondary to ADA formation rather than 
being  indicative  of  distribution  of  ublituximab  into  the  CNS.  Ublituximab  distribution  across  the  blood 
brain barrier was not assessed in toxicology studies. At 30 mg/kg the male and female average AUC0-
144hr  of  74000  μg•hr/mL  and  Cmax  of  1060  μg/mL  on  Day  176  (ADA  negative  animals  only),  were 
registered.

2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Ublituximab was tested in a GLP bacterial reverse mutation assay to evaluate its mutagenic potential. 
The ability of ublituximab to induce reverse mutation at selected loci of several strains of S. typhimurium 
(TA1535, TA1537, TA98, TA100, and TA102) was measured at doses of 0, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 μL/plate. 
Testing was conducted in the presence and absence of an exogenous metabolic activation system using 
hepatic  microsomes  from  rat  livers  induced  by  Aroclor  1254  with  a  48-hour  incubation  period. 
Ublituximab induced neither toxicity nor precipitation in any strain tested at any dose. The maximum 
dose  retained  for  the  first  mutagenicity  assay  was  100  μL/plate  in  all  strains,  either  with  or  without 
metabolic  activation.  Ublituximab  induced  no  mutagenic  activity  in  any  of  the  S.  typhimurium  strains 
(TA1535,  TA1537,  TA98,  TA100,  and  TA102)  tested,  either  in  the  absence  or  presence  of  metabolic 
activation. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
According  to  ICH  S6(R1)  guideline,  standard  carcinogenicity  bioassays  are  generally  inappropriate  for 
biotechnology-derived  pharmaceuticals.  For  ublituximab,  conventional  carcinogenicity  studies  are  not 
appropriate because carcinogenicity studies are not feasible in cynomolgus monkey, ublituximab is not 
pharmacologically  active  in  rodents,  and  2-year  bioassay  is  a  poor  predictor  of  carcinogenicity  risk 
associated with immunosuppression. Due to the mechanism of action, i.e. immunosuppression, tumour 
promoting effects of ublituximab cannot be ruled out. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No  dedicated  fertility  studies  were  performed.  Based  on  studies  of  general  toxicity  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys no concerns on reproductive organotoxicity are expected. 
In  a  ePPND  study,  IV  dosing  of  30  mg/kg/week  ublituximab  in  pregnant  female  monkeys  was  poorly 
tolerated. 10 adult females were euthanised early due to deteriorating clinical condition or were found 
dead after administration of 3 to 6 doses of ublituximab at 30 mg/kg/week (3 animals from Set 2A and 
7 animals from Set 2B). Clinical signs observed in multiple animals included bleeding from gums, oral 
cavity, and/or nasal cavity; ataxia; loss of consciousness/moribundity; and hunched posture. All 10 adult 
females  had  systemic  changes  consistent  with  an  ADA  formation,  and  9  of  the  10  had  placental 
abnormalities  that  included  infarction,  perivillous  fibrin,  and/or  retroplacental  haematoma  that  were 
likely immune mediated and involved in fetal loss. 
In first trimester dosing, there were 9 fetal losses and no infant losses. Ublituximab-related placental 
changes occurred in 3 out of 10 placentas and included diffuse friable texture and dark red gelatinous 
material accumulation with microscopic correlates of moderate to marked infarcts. These placentas were 
from females that were euthanised early and were considered a component of the ublituximab-related 
systemic changes. Fetal loss was directly attributed to the placental changes in 2 animals and secondary 
to  euthanasia  of  the  female  for  1  animal.  There  were  no  other  ublituximab-related  effects  on  fetal 
macroscopic or microscopic pathology, morphometric measurements, or teratogenic external, visceral, 
or heart evaluations as applicable. 
In  second  trimester  dosing,  there  were  12  fetal  losses  and  3  infant  losses.  Of  these  losses,  7  were 
associated with adult females that were euthanised early/found dead, and ublituximab-related placental 
findings  were  noted  in  6  of  the  7  adult  females.  These  findings  included  gelatinous  fetal  surface, 
generalised  pallor  of  the  disc,  and  material  accumulation  on  the  maternal  surface  with  histologic 
correlates of retroplacental haematoma, disc infarct, and perivillous fibrin accumulation. Fetal loss was 
directly attributed to the placental changes in 4 animals and secondary to euthanasia of the female for

3  animals.  There  were  no  other  ublituximab-related  effects  on  fetal  macroscopic  or  microscopic 
pathology,  morphometric  measurements,  or  teratogenic  external,  visceral,  or  heart  evaluations  as 
applicable. 
A NOAEL could not be determined due to only one dose level evaluated in this reproductive toxicity on 
cynomolgus monkeys.

In toxicity studies, immunogenicity-mediated accelerated clearance at low doses was observed. However 
in  high  dose  groups  (30  and  50  mg/kg)  ublituximab  exposure  was  maintained,  allowing  for  adequate 
evaluation of ublituximab treatment-related toxicities.  
Lactation was not an endpoint in ePPND and no ublituximab in mother’s milk was measured.

2.5.4.7.  Local tolerance  
The  objective  of  Study  20070605TL  was  to  assess  the  local  tolerance  of  ublituximab  in  New  Zealand 
albino  rabbits  using  the  perivenous  and  intra-arterial  routes.  Three  groups  of  5  female  rabbits  were 
administered  either  sodium  chloride,  formulation  buffer  (sodium  citrate  [7.35  g/L],  NaCl  [9  g/L],  and 
polysorbate 80 [700 mg/L]), or ublituximab once by the pv route and once by the ia route on the same 
day. Sodium chloride, formulation buffer, and ublituximab were administered as a single pv injection at 
a volume of 0.5mL and a single ia injection at a volume of 1.042 mL/kg, which corresponded to the 10 
mg/kg dose of ublituximab. The ia injections were performed by infusion at a rate of 1 mL/minute. 
No  mortality  or  clinical  signs  were  observed  in  any  of  the  animals.  Local  signs  observed  were  mainly 
haematoma upstream from the ia site. Local signs observed with the pv route in animals treated with 
0.9%  NaCl  were  mainly  erythema,  and  animals  treated  with  the  formulation  buffer  and  ublituximab 
presented mainly with haematoma. No lesions were seen at the necropsy examination, except erythema 
and  haematoma  seen  at  the  injection  sites  on  ears  (by  ia  and  pv  routes)  in  all  the  groups  with  the 
comparable occurrence. Histopathology results showed that in the 10 mg/kg-treated group, the ia and 
pv injections did not cause treatment-related responses.

2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Ublituximab  is  comprised  of  naturally  occurring  amino  acids  and  is  not  expected  to  have  any 
environmental impact. The persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity are considered unlikely and present 
a very low risk. 
The Predicted Environmental Concentration in the surface water is 0.00225, which is below 0.01 μg/L, 
and no other environmental concerns are apparent. Therefore, it is assumed that the medicinal product 
is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients. A Phase II 
environmental fate/risk assessment is not considered necessary. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Ublituximab is a recombinant IgG1 chimeric monoclonal antibody which binds to the pre-B cells, mature 
and memory B cells surface CD20. It is proposed to be used in the treatment of RMS trough the IV route 
of  administration.  Other  anti-CD20  mAbs  (rituximab,  obinutuzumab,  ofatumumab  and  ocrelizumab) 
some of those (ofatumumab SC and ocrelizumab IV) already approved for the treatment of MS, were 
used as comparators in the non-clinical evaluation.  
Ublituximab is produced in the rat cell line YB2/0 which has reduced levels of fucosyl-transferase activity 
resulting  in  antibody  glycoforms  incorporating  less  fucose  content.  The  low  content  of  fucose  in 
ublituximab glycosylation of the human IgG1-Fc-portion is claimed to be associated to the higher ADCC 
vs ocrelizumab> ofatumumab> rituximab observed on lymphoblast-like Raji cells and on NK cells. As 
regards the potential clinical advantage, it is noted that in clinical trials ublituximab at a lower dose (450 
mg) than ocrelizumab (600 mg) demonstrated a lower annualised relapse rate (ARR) and lower rate of 
participants  experiencing  confirmed  disability  progression  (CDP).  With  respect  to  safety,  ublituximab 
displayed a similar adverse event (AE) profile compared to ocrelizumab. 
The  applicant  has  shown  that  ublituximab  binds  FcγRIIIa  158V  with  a  dissociation  constant  value 
approximately 10-fold lower than FcγRIIIa 158F (64 versus 680 nM), however ublituximab binding to 
both variants was stronger compared to other anti-CD20 antibodies, and ublituximab is less sensitive to 
FcγRIIIa polymorphisms clinically than other anti-CD20 antibodies, a trend which has been observed in 
the  clinic.  The  clinical  data  from  the  Phase  III  Studies  of  ublituximab  (TG1101-RMS301  and  TG1101-
RMS302)  demonstrate  the  uniform  PD  effect  of  CD19+  B-cell  depletion  in  nearly  all  patients,  with 
absolute counts of CD19+ B cells remaining lower than the limit of normal (<100 cells/μL) for 97.9% to 
100% of patients through Week 96. These results demonstrated that FcγRIIIa 158 polymorphisms did 
not have an impact on the clinical activity of ublituximab. 
As regards the lower CDC vs. ADCC contribution in ublituximab pharmacological activity as shown by in 
vitro and in vivo studies, the applicant assumes that it is not thought to translate to decreased efficacy 
and that it may lead overall to a better clinical outcome with improved tolerability, potentially contributing 
to the ability to infuse ublituximab in 1 hour for the second and subsequent infusion compared to longer 
infusion times for other anti-CD20. 
No in vivo MS model was carried out. Although, one model recapitulating all MS pathogenesis features 
currently does not exist, the experimental autoimmune/allergic encephalomyelitis is recognised as the 
model which better reflects the autoimmune pathogenesis of MS. However, the feasibility of such a model 
due to ublituximab cross-reaction with rodent CD20 and its the strong immunogenicity observed in non-
human  primate  studies,  is  questioned.  The  performed  studies  in  immunocompromised  mice  models 
(SCID and SCID NOD) of the clearance of human B-CLL provide evidence that ublituximab can deplete 
tumoral B cell. This can be considered a proof of concept, also confirmed in clinical setting.

Monkeys  share  97%  CD20  protein  sequence  homology  compared  with  the  naturally  occurring  human 
sequence. In both normal human and cynomolgus monkey tissues ublituximab showed binding to tissues 
known to express CD20. The lack of staining outside the lymphoid follicles indicates the ublituximab has 
low off-target potential. 
PK and TK of ublituximab  were assessed in non-clinical studies in rabbits (sharing 80% CD20 protein 
sequence homology) and cynomolgus monkeys. However, the results from the IV administration to male 
New Zealand rabbits are affected by the non-GLP status and the use of only male rabbit. The rationale 
for carrying out this study is not completely understood also considering the in the GLP local tolerance 
study  by  perivenous  and  intra-arterial  administration  in  rabbit,  only  female  rabbits  were  used.  All 
bioanalytical methods of ublituximab and ADA were based on ligand-binding assays. The bioanalytical 
methods were adequately validated.  
The  toxicological  profile  of  ublituximab  was  assessed  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  in  4-week  single  dose 
study and repeated dose  toxicity studies of 4-weeks, 13-week  with 6-month recovery period and 26-
weeks  duration,  which  also  included  endpoints  of  safety  pharmacology.  The  key  ublituximab-related 
findings included expected decreases in lymphocyte count and corresponding changes in lymphoid tissue, 
thymus, spleen, and bone marrow. Immunosuppression (B cell depletion) is the pharmacological effect 
of ublituximab. Overall, 30 mg/kg ublituximab was well tolerated in monkeys after multiple doses over 
a 13-week and a 26-week periods with changes primarily noted in lymphoid tissue. In 26-week repeat-
dose toxicity study at the only dose tested was 30 mg/kg, several animals exhibited mononuclear cell 
infiltration in the CNS and eye as well as vascular/perivascular inflammation in various tissues that were 
likely related to immune-mediated effects secondary to ADA rather than being indicative of distribution 
of ublituximab into the CNS. Although distribution across the blood brain barrier was not assessed, the 
possibility that ublituximab passes the disrupted blood brain barrier, cannot be completely ruled out and 
accumulation  of  peripheral  immune  cells  at  CNS  levels  in  patients  suffering  from  MS,  could  occur 
independently. The postulated peripherally action of ublituximab causing B-cell depletion, is expected to 
ameliorate the CNS inflammatory status. Moreover, it remains unclear how the peripheral ADA formation 
could alter the healthy monkey BBB integrity. Moreover, the study does not allow to know the persistence 
of the observed findings, since no recovery period was added in the study, or the dose-effect relationship, 
since  only  one  dose  was  used.  Of  note,  also  in  dose-repeated  toxicity  studies  with  other  anti-CD20 
monoclonal  antibodies,  ofatumumab  recombinant  fully  human  and  ocrelizumab  humanised,  both 
approved  for  the  treatment  of  MS,  perivascular  inflammatory  cell  infiltration  in  the  brain  and  diffuse 
lymphocytic and plasmacytic cell infiltrates in the choroid and ciliary body of the eyes, were observed. 
Clinical relevance of mononuclear cell infiltration in monkey brain parenchyma remains uncertain. The 
issue  was  not  further  pursued  in  the  absence  of  any  clinical  observations  of  autoimmune  or 
hypersensitivity reactions in patients with ADA. 
The adverse maternal and fetal effects observed in the ePPND study in monkeys treated with only 30 
mg/kg ublituximab, were not attributed to a direct effect of ublituximab, but instead were considered 
secondary to immunogenicity of the test article, resulting in a hypersensitivity response, formation of 
ADA, and downstream immune-mediated adverse effects on multiple organ systems including placenta. 
No information on ublituximab excretion in milk is presented in non-clinical documentation.  
However, human IgGs are known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which 
decreases to low concentrations soon afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot 
be excluded during this short period. Adequate wording in section 4.6 is added consistently with other 
approved anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. “Safety in pregnancy and lactation, including foetal risk” are 
listed as missing information in the RMP. 
Ublituximab was immunogenic in monkeys. This is expected, since it is a human chimeric monoclonal 
antibody  and  is  directed  at  cell  surface  marker  which  undergo  internalisation.  In  toxicity  studies, 
Assessment report

immunogenicity-mediated  accelerated  clearance  at  low  doses  was  observed,  which  led  to  exposure 
reduction.  However,  at  high  dose  groups  (30  and  50  mg/kg)  ublituximab  exposure  was  maintained, 
allowing for adequate evaluation of ublituximab treatment-related toxicities. 
Ublituximab  is  intended  for  chronic  use.  The  sustained  depletion  of  B-cells  might  affect  the  immune 
system ability to detect and eliminate cancer cells thus leading to an increased risk of developing solid 
tumours. Although it is agreed that the weight of evidence in the literature does not suggest that B cell 
depletion  plays  a  driving  force  in  tumour  formation  and  promotion,  “malignancies”  is  reported  as 
important potential risk in other anti-CD20 authorised for the treatment of MS Risk management plan 
(RMP)s  and  “Known  active  malignancy”  is  included  as  a  contraindication  (section  4.3)  in  the 
corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPCs). Also considering the clinical assessment, 
the same approach is followed for Briumvi.   
The CHMP agrees that Ublituximab is comprised of naturally occurring amino acids and is not expected 
to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the available non-clinical data regarding pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetic and toxicology 
of ublituximab, the application is considered approvable from a non-clinical perspective.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
Ublituximab (also referred to as TG-1101) is a recombinant immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 chimeric mAb that 
targets the CD20 antigen expressed on the surface of pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
Bioanalytical methods were developed, validated and performed to support the clinical development of 
the ublituximab. Following techniques were developed: Electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) 
for  ublituximab  detection  in  human  serum  (01128004),  ECLIA  for  ADA  detection  in  human  serum 
(01128007),  and  cell-based  assay  for  the  detection  of  neutralising  anti-TG-1101  antibodies  in  human 
serum 
(01128016). 
All  methods  were 
validated 
according 
to 
the 
guidelines:

EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006  and  EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009.  Moreover,  the  applicant  also 
provided  the  validation  report  for  teriflunomide  (15503ANIA)  determination  in  samples  from  RMS301 
and RMS302 studies.  
Validation 01128004 (ublituximab determination) 
Validation  procedure  for  the  quantification  of  TG-1101  in  human  serum  using  ECLIA  was  performed. 
Calibration  curve  concentrations  ranged  from  15.63  to  2000  ng/mL.  During  procedure  following 
parameters were addressed and met the acceptance criteria: selectivity (normal and MS patients sera), 
sensitivity, intra- and inter-assay accuracy and precision and ruggedness and robustness.  
As per storage stability, results for only 686 days were found in the dossier. Upon request, the applicant 
provided stability at 1044 day (about 34 months), however the LTS period do not cover the period of 
storage  of  samples.  Following  the  CHMP  request  to  submit  the  LTS  data  covering  45  months  i.e.  the 
maximum  storage  period  for  samples  from  studies  RMS201,  RMS301  and  RMS302,  the  applicant 
proposed  to  provide  these  data  post  approval  by  Q3  of  2023  and  to  formalise  this  commitment  via a 
Letter of Recommendations as a post-approval measure (REC). The proposal is acceptable. 
Validation 01128007 (ADA determination) 
In the validation report it is reported that the stability of ADA will be set for the following conditions: 
short-term stability at room temperature for 19 hours and 40 minutes, 6 freeze-thaw stability in human 
serum, long-term stability in human serum (at -60°C to -80°C for at least 12 months). The applicant 
proposed to submit the results of the full long stability data (that cover samples in RMS201, RMS301 
and  RMS302)  post  approval  by  Q2  2024  and  to  formalise  this  commitment  via  a  letter  of 
recommendations as a post-approval measure (REC).  
For Study RMS201, post-baseline PK  and ADA sample were both available at time  points Day 15 and 
Week24, for study RMS301 and RMS302 on Day15, Weeks 24, 48, 72, 96 and at end of study.  
The  bioequivalence  reports  for  ADA  determination  were  provided  for  RMS201  (01128010),  RMS301 
(01128017)  and  RMS302  (01128018).  The  applicant  did  not  initially  provide  the  corresponding 
ublituximab concentrations for ADA samples. 
Nab assay validation (01128016) 
The NAb assay was based on a cell-based ADCC assay.  
Drug tolerance was determined during validation to be 0.1 μg/mL of TG-1101 at the low positive control 
(LPC1  0.95  μg/mL  and  LPC2  1.50  μg/mL)  and  1  μg/mL  at  high  positive  control  (HPC)  (50  μg/mL). 
Haemolysis was not found to interfere with the assay. Lipemia was found to potentially interfere with the 
assay and cause a false negative result.  
The  NAb  status  for  each  subject  in  the  treatment-emergent  ADA  (TE-ADA)  positive  population  was 
considered positive if the subject had at least one post-baseline positive NAb sample. For all other TE-
ADA positive subjects, the NAb status was negative. Subjects who were TE-ADA negative were assigned 
a NAb negative status. 
Based on data reported in the BA reports of Nab determinations in the RMS201 (BA report 01128019), 
RMS301 (BA report 01128020) and RMS302 (BA report 01128021) it is noted that several Nab negative 
samples  had  ublituximab  concentration  above  the  drug  tolerance  level  (DTL)  (0.1  μg/mL)  at  LPC 
therefore impacting the reliability of negative results.   
• 
For Study RMS201, 22 samples from 17 of the 34 subjects (50.0% of the ADA positive subjects) 
had at least 1 sample with TG-1101 concentrations > 0.1 μg/mL (DTL) and were negative for 
Nab.

• 
In  Study  RMS301,  380  samples  from  214  of  the  237  subjects  (90.3%  of  the  ADA  positive 
subjects) had at least 1 sample with TG-1101 concentrations > 0.1 μg/mL (DTL). 2 samples from 
1 subject were Nab positive, the remaining samples (378) were considered Nab negative. 
In  Study  RMS302,  449  samples  from  224  of  the  242  subjects  (92.6%  of  the  ADA  positive 
subjects)  had  at  least  1  sample  with  TG-1101  concentrations  >  0.1  μg/mL  (DTL).  4  samples 
were positive for anti-TG-1101 neutralizing antibodies, the remaining 445 samples were negative 
for neutralizing antibodies. 
As per validation report, lipemia can interfere with Nab determination. In Study RMS301 and RMS302 
17 and 10 samples, respectively, showed lipemia potentially impacting the Nab determination.   
Teriflunomide determination in plasma (validation number 155037ANIA) 
A  high-performance  liquid  chromatographic  method  for  the  determination  of  teriflunomide  in  human 
EDTA K2 plasma was validated over an analytical range of 10 to 5000 ng/mL.  
The  method  was  validated  in  accordance  to  the  relevant  Guidelines.  The  BA  reports  for  teriflunomide 
determination in RMS301 and RMS302 were provided. Samples were stored within the validated stability 
period; the incurred samples reanalysis was performed according to relevant GL and met the criteria of 
assay reproducibility. Some samples exceed the Upper Limit of Quantification and were reanalysed using 
the appropriate dilution scheme.

Population pharmacokinetic (popPK) and exposure-response analysis of efficacy and safety 
of Ublituximab in Multiple Sclerosis. TGTX-PMX-TGl 101-2920.  
Objectives 
• Update a previously developed PopPK model for ublituximab using data from subjects with RMS enrolled 
in  Studies  TG1101-RMS201,  TG1101-RMS301,  and  TG1101-  RMS302  and  to  assess  the  impact  of 
potential covariates, including disease, on ublituximab PK 
• Characterise E-R safety relationships for ublituximab in subjects with RMS enrolled in Studies TG1101-
RMS201,  TG1101-RMS301,  and  TG1101-RMS302  for  selected  safety  endpoints,  including  infusion-
related reaction 
• Characterise exposure response (E-R) efficacy relationships for ublituximab in subjects with RMS from 
Studies  TG  l  101-RMS301  and  TG  l  101-RMS302  for  the  following  efficacy  endpoints:  ARR  and  total 
number of gadolinium-enhancing Gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing Tl-lesions by MRI scan at Week 96, 
• Evaluate the influence of covariates on significant E-R efficacy and safety relationships for ublituximab,  
• Evaluate PopPK and E-R relationships to support a recommended therapeutic dose for subjects with 
RMS. 
Population PK Analysis 
The PopPK dataset included 5624 quantifiable ublituximab serum concentrations from 591 subjects with 
RMS including 47 subjects in Study TG 1101-RMS201, 272 subjects in Study TG 1101-RMS301 and 272 
subjects in Study TG 110 l-RMS302. This data was combined with a previous dataset of ublituximab in 
subjects with haematologic malignancies enrolled in two Phase 1 studies (CD20-0703 and TGTX-1101-
101) and one Phase 3 study (UTX-TGR-304). The combined dataset included a total of 7485 quantifiable 
ublituximab  serum  concentrations  from  895  subjects.  During  base  PopPK  model  development,  an 
additional 15 outlying concentrations were excluded. The final PopPK model development was based on 
a dataset including 7470 quantifiable ublituximab serum concentrations from 894 subjects. 
PK parameter estimates for a typical subject (defined as a male subject that is ADA negative with a body 
weight of 73 kg from North America or Western Europe) were as follows: CL was estimated to be 11.6 
mL/h,  with  inter-individual  variability  (IIV)  of  38.1%;  Ve  was  estimated  to  be  3.18  L(IIV=15.0%); 
peripheral volume of distribution (Vp) was estimated to be 3.60 L (IIV=21.3%); and inter-compartmental 
clearance (Q) was estimated to be 11.6 mL/h. 
Body weight and ADA were found to be statistically significant predictors of ublituximab CL. Ublituximab 
CL  was  modestly  increased  by  14%  in  subjects  that  were  ADA  positive  compared  to  those  had  no 
quantifiable  ADA.  For  the  wide  range  of  body  weight  in  the  RMS  subpopulation  (45.1  to  154  kg),  CL 
ranged from 22% lower to 48% higher compared to that for a typical subject with a body weight of 73 
kg. In addition at late times (417 d after the start of treatment), CL was reduced by a median of 12.5%. 
Body weight, sex and region were found to be a statistically significant predictor of Ve. Subjects from 
Eastern  Europe  were  found  to  have  slightly  higher  (10%)  Ve  than  Western  Europeans  and  North 
Americans and females had slightly lower (7%) Ve than males. For the wide range of body weight in the 
RMS subpopulation (45.1 to 154 kg), central volume of distribution (Vc) ranged from 19% lower to 38% 
higher than that for a typical subject with a body weight of 73 kg. 
After  inclusion  of  body  weight  in  the  model,  there  was  no  effect  of  age,  haemoglobin  concentration, 
platelet count, white blood cell count, renal impairment or hepatic impairment on ublituximab PK.

Final Model Evaluation 
Model parameters were estimated with relative standard error (RSE) <20% for structural and covariate 
model parameters and RSE <30% for random effects estimates. Shrinkage was acceptable for CL and 
Ve (5.32% and 32.6%, respectively) with large shrinkage on Vp (40%). 
Key goodness of fit (GOF) diagnostics for the ublituximab final PopPK model suggest satisfactory fit with 
minimal bias in residuals over time and across predicted concentration values and show good agreement 
between predicted and observed concentrations.  
Relative to the base model, ETA - covariate relationships were resolved and no further trends between 
ETAs (on CL and Ve) and covariates were evident in the RMS subpopulation, suggesting that the model 
adequately captured significant covariate relationships. 
The prediction-corrected visual predictive checks (pcVPCs) stratified by study and overall by time and 
time after last dose evaluated the ability of the model to reproduce the distribution of the data (Figure 
3). 
Overall,  the  pcVPC  plots  suggest  that  the  model  well  predicts  the  central  tendency  of  the  observed 
ublituximab concentrations and adequately captures the range of the data. The relative importance of 
covariate effects included in the final PopPK model was evaluated with a forest plot of relative changes 
in  exposure  (Cmax-ss,  Cmin-ss,  and  AUCss)  when  covariates  were  varied  one  at  a  time  (i.e.,  univariate 
analysis).  The  effects  of  these  covariates,  including  body  weight,  sex,  region  ADA  and  the  fractional 
change in CL at late times, on ublituximab exposures fell within the range of 0.8 to 1.25 compared to 
the reference exposure (defined as the exposure for a male subject from North America/Western Europe 
with  a  body  weight  of  73  kg,  who  is  ADA  negative  and  has  been  on  treatment  for  <416  days. 
Consequently, none of the covariates were deemed clinically relevant. Furthermore, the covariates did 
not have a significant impact on the magnitude of IIV on CL or Ve. The combined effects of body weight 
and ADA reduced IIV by only 2.8%, from 39.2% in the base model to 38.1 % in the final model. Similarly, 
body weight, sex and region reduced IIV by 18.5% in Ve from 18.4% in the base model to 15.0% in the 
final model.  
The  applicant  submitted  the  GOF  plots  separately  for  the  RMS  population  and  for  participants  with 
haematologic malignancies (CLL/NHL) (Figure 2). The GOF lines for RMS and CLL/NHL overlap, further 
supporting the inclusion of all data in the population PK model.

Cmin-ss  was  more  variable,  varying  up  to  65%  between  covariate  categories.  Although  baseline  body 
weight was a statistically significant covariate influencing ublituximab PK, subjects with a body weight 
of  ≥80  kg  had  slightly  decreased  Cmax-ss  and  average  concentration  (Cavg)  at  steady  state  (Cavg-ss) 
compared with subjects with a body weight of <80 kg (geometric mean ratios of Cavg,ss = 0.799, Cmax-
ss =0. 823) while Cmin-ss was decreased by 44%. As renal impairment was correlated with body weight 
(R=-0.43), differences in exposures between subjects with normal and mild renal impairment reflected 
variations in body weight. Similarly, differences in exposures by sex reflected variations in body weight 
(R=-0.40). ADA demonstrated a modest effect on  exposures (geometric mean ratio for  Cmax-ss, Cavg-ss 
and Cmin-ss = 0.972, 0.859 and 0.621, respectively. These findings suggest that none of the evaluated 
covariates had a clinically relevant impact on ublituximab exposure.  
Predicted Exposure Metrics Based on the Final PopPK Model 
The  final  model  of  ublituximab  was  utilised  to  obtain  individual  post  hoc  estimates  of  PK  parameters 
(AUCss, Cavg-ss, Cmax-ss, and Cmin-ss) at Week 48 (Table 3).   
The geometric mean t½ (90% confidence interval [CI]) was calculated to be 21.8 days (21.4, 22.1 days). 
Median  time  to  reach  steady  state  was  determined  to  be  15.5  weeks.  Accordingly,  there  was  no 
accumulation  for  subjects  that  received  the  per-protocol  regimen  of  150  mg  ublituximab  on  Day  1 
followed by 450 mg on Day 15, Week 24 and Week 48. The median Cmax ratio at Week 24 to Cmax on 
Day 1 was 3.04 (range 3.00 to 3.42) consistent with the 3-fold increase in the amount of the dose and 
indicative of no accumulation. Similarly, the Cmax ratio at Week 48 to Week 24 was 1, indicative of no 
accumulation. 
Table 3: Model-Predicted Ublituximab Exposure Metrics Following the Week 48 Dose Stratified by Dose 
Based on the final PopPK model, Cmax-ss and Cavg-ss varied by 20% between covariate categories for all 
covariates  of  interest.  Cmin-ss  was  more  variable,  varying  up  to  65%  between  covariate  categories. 
Although  baseline  body  weight  was  a  statistically  significant  covariate  influencing  ublituximab  PK, 
subjects with a body weight of 2:80 kg had slightly decreased Cmax-ss and Cavg-ss compared with subjects 
with a body weight of <80 kg (geometric mean ratios of Cavg-ss = 0.799, Cmax-ss = 0. 823) while Cmin-ss 
was decreased by 44%. As renal impairment was correlated with body weight (R=-0.43), differences in 
exposures between subjects with normal and mild renal impairment reflected variations in body weight. 
Similarly,  differences  in  exposures  by  sex  reflected  variations  in  body  weight  (R=-0.40).  ADA 
demonstrated a modest effect on exposures (geometric mean ratio for Cmax-ss, Cavg-ss and Cmin-ss = 0.972, 
0.859  and  0.621,  respectively.  These  findings  suggest  that  none  of  the  evaluated  covariates  had  a 
clinically relevant impact on ublituximab exposure. 
Exposure-Response Efficacy Analysis 
A total of 543 subjects with RMS were included in the ublituximab efficacy E-R analyses of ARR (ARR 
dataset), and total number of Gd-enhancing Tl-lesions per MRI scan at Week 96 (MRI dataset).

The  relationship  between  ARR  and  ublituximab  was  explored  using  negative  binominal  regression.  No 
statistically significant exposure-efficacy relationship (p=0.111) was observed. 
Although not statistically significant, exploratory evaluations are shown for Cmax-ss following the Week 48 
dose, as it has the lowest p-value. The model was then used to predict ARR for subjects who received 
450 mg every 24 weeks. The 95% CI of the model-predictions across percentiles overlap, suggesting 
similar treatment benefit across ublituximab exposure groups. 
The  relationship  between  the  total  number  of  Gd  enhancing  Tl-lesions  per  MRI  scan  at  week  96  and 
ublituximab  was  explored  using  negative  binominal  regression.  No  statistically  significant  exposure-
efficacy  relationship  (p=0.273)  was  observed.  Although  not  statistically  significant,  exploratory 
evaluations are shown for Cavg-ss as it was the exposure with the lowest p-value.  
Absorption  
Ublituximab  is  administered  as  an  IV  infusion.  No  studies  with  other  routes  of  administration  were 
performed.  No  food  interaction  studies  were  conducted,  which  is  acceptable  given  the  route  of 
administration. 
Distribution 
The PopPK model-estimated Ve was estimated to be 3.18 L (IIV 16%) and Vp was estimated to be 3.60 
L (IIV=21.3%). 
Elimination 
The  PopPK  model-estimated  systemic  clearance  was  11.6  mL/h  with  IIV  of  38.1%.  The  inter 
compartmental clearance was 11.6 mL/h. The geometric t1/2 (90% CI) was calculated to be 21.8 days 
(21.4, 22.1 days). Time to reach steady state was 15.6 weeks. Ublituximab is expected to be degraded

to small peptides and amino acids by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes. Thus, classic hepatic metabolism 
pathways are not involved in the clearance of Ublituximab. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Study  TGTX1101-101  was  a  Phase  1  first-in-human  dose-escalation  study  in  participants  with 
haematologic malignancies that enrolled 3 to 6 participants at each dose level of 450 mg, 600 mg, 900 
mg, and 1200 mg study. Data from this study seems to not support the dose proportionality between 
450 mg and 1200 mg.  
Upon  request,  the  applicant  submitted  figures  of  observed  ublituximab  plasma  concentrations  versus 
time after dose for all studies.  
The model-predicted ublituximab concentrations were provided in Table 9. 
Table 9:  Model-Predicted Ublituximab Exposure Metrics Following the Week 48 Dose Stratified by Dose 
No  accumulation  of  ublituximab  was  observed  for  subjects  receiving  150  mg  ublituximab  on  Day  1 
followed by 450 mg on Day 15, Week 24 and Week 48 (Cmax ratio at week 24 to Day 1 was 3.04; Cmax 
ratio at week 48 to week 24 was 1).  
Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal and hepatic function 
No studies with renal or hepatic impaired patients were conducted. The exposures of ublituximab were 
comparable  among  subjects  with  mild  (n=101)  renal  impairment  compared  to  subjects  with  normal 
(n=454) renal function. The exposures of ublituximab were comparable among subjects with mild (n=19) 
or moderate (n=3) hepatic impairment relative to those with normal (n=494) hepatic function, although 
the number of subjects with hepatic impairment is limited. 
•  Gender 
Sex was found to be a statistically significant predictor of Vc. Females had a slightly lower (7%) Vc than 
males. Cmax values were not differentiated according to the sex - for males mean Cmax was 125 ug/ml 
(90%CI -123, 128) and for females mean Cmax was 148 ug/mL (90%CI -146, 150). A ratio between male 
and female Cmax was 1.18. Sex differences for Vc values seem to be out of clinical significance.  
•  Race 
Region  was  found  to  be  a  statistically  significant  predictor  of  Ve.  Subjects  from  Eastern  Europe  were 
found to have slightly higher (10%) Ve than Western Europeans and North Americans. White/all other 
participants  have  mean  Cmax  ratio  1.04.  Race  differences  in  PK  parameters  values  seem  to  be  out  of 
clinical significance. 
•  Weight 
Body weight was found to be statistically significant predictors of ublituximab CL. According to popPK, 
for the wide range of body weight in the RMS subpopulation (45.1 to 154 kg), CL ranged from 22% lower 
to 48% higher compared to that for a typical subject with a body weight of 73 kg. In addition at late 
Assessment report

times (417 d after the start of treatment), CL was reduced by a median of 12.5%. Mean values for Cmax 
for  participants  weighting  above  80  kg  was  121  ug/mL  (118,  123)  and  mean  values  for  Cmax  for 
participants weighting under 80 kg was 147 ug/mL (145, 149). Cmax ratio between groups of patients 
weighting above and under 80 kg was 0.823. 
Ublituximab CL in the popPK model ranged from 22% lower to 48% higher compared to that for a typical 
subject with a body weight of 73 kg across the ranges of body weights (median weight  69 kg, range 
45.1  to  154.0  kg),  however,  as  observed  in  the  exposure-safety  and  exposure-efficacy  analyses, 
ublituximab exposure had no impact on safety or efficacy observations in the RMS population.  
Endpoints for efficacy (ARR and total number of Gd-enhancing T1-lesions per MRI scan at Week 96) and 
safety [AEs of special interests (AESI)] were plotted by exposure quartiles and no positive trends were 
observed in the RMS population Therefore, differences in body weight resulting in slight differences in 
exposure are not correlated with efficacy or safety responses with ublituximab treatment. 
•  Elderly 
Age was not significant predictors of ublituximab popPK and was not deemed clinically relevant. A Cmax 
ratio for patients under 35 and above 35 was 0.979. According to the popPK, age was not deemed to be 
clinically relevant for ublituximab PK.  
The  oldest  enrolled  patients  in  the  Phase  III  programme  were  55  years  of  age  but  the  population 
database  for  the  ublituximab  popPK  includes  participants  with  MS  (n=593)  and  with  haematologic 
malignancies (n=338) up to 88 years of age, with 171 participants (18%) ≥65 years of age including 65 
patients enrolled in study TG1101-RMS303 as per the cut off of 01 March 2022.   
•  Children 
No dedicated PK studies in paediatric population were performed. A PIP has been adopted. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal DDI studies have been performed with ublituximab as no drug interactions are expected via 
cytochrome P450 enzymes, other metabolising enzymes, or transporters. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
No PK studies with human biomaterial was performed.  
Bioequivalence studies 
The applicant presented two bioequivalence studies for the bioequivalent teriflunomide product used as 
active  comparator  in  the  pivotal  trials  TG1101-RMS301  and  TG  1101-RMS302,  namely  Study  150123 
and  Study  150124.  Moreover,  the  validation  report  155037  ANIA  dated  29.09.2015  (used  for  studies 
150123 and 150124) has been also submitted. 
The  two  bioequivalent  studies  150123  and  150124  were  correctly  performed  in  terms  of  enrolled 
subjects,  wash-out  period,  sampling.  It  was  declared  that  were  conducted  in  GCP  compliance.  The 
bioanalytical method used to determine teriflunomide concentrations was validated and the validation 
report as well as the bioanalytical reports were attached in the dossier. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ublituximab is a recombinant chimeric mAb that is specific for the CD20 antigen expressed on the surface 
of B cells. It is composed of a murine variable region fused onto a human constant region and displays

the typical structure of immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 consisting of 2 gamma heavy chains and 2 kappa light 
chains linked with 16 intra- and inter-chain disulfide bridges. It is composed of a total of 1322 amino 
acids (144 kDa). 
With regard to disease pathogenesis, the role of B-cells in autoimmune diseases has been of great priority 
in  both  pre-clinical  and  clinical  research  in  autoimmune  diseases,  especially  in  MS.  B-cells  can  form 
autoantibodies,  which  can  result  in  pathological  immune  complex  deposition  that  can  activate  the 
complement  system  as  well  as  initiate  acute  inflammatory  cascade  by  producing  pro-inflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines. Further, B cells have been shown to regulate the formation and function of T 
cells, which can aid in the demyelinating events seen with MS. 
Primary pharmacology 
A Placebo-Controlled Multi-Center Phase IIa Dose Finding Study of Ublituximab, a Third-Generation Anti-
CD20 Monoclonal Antibody, in Patients with Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis (TG1101-RMS201). 
This was a 52-week, placebo-controlled phase 2, dose-finding study of ublituximab in patients with RMS. 
Primary objectives were to determine the B-cell depletion after ublituximab infusion in RMS patients and 
determine  optimal  dose  and  infusion  time  for  ublituximab  in  subjects  with  RMS.  The  primary  efficacy 
variable was the responder rate of B-cell depletion at Week 4, which was defined as the proportion of 
subjects  who  had  reduced  B-cell  depletion  by  ≥95%  at  Week  4  (2  weeks  after  Week  3  Day  15,  the 
second scheduled infusion of ublituximab). Subjects within each cohort received ublituximab on Day 1, 
Day  15,  and  Week  24  or  placebo  on  Days  1  and  15.  Placebo  Patients  received  ublituximab  after 
completion of week 4. Overall, six cohorts with different dose regimens and infusion times were tested. 
Total 45 subjects completed the 48-week treatment periods. Mean age across cohorts ranged from 34.3 
to 44.9. Most patients enrolled were females 66.7%, and most were White – 81.3%. 
The responder rate (95% CI) of B-cell depletion 2 weeks after Week 3 Day 15, the second scheduled 
infusion of ublituximab, was 95.8% (85.75%, 99.49%) (2.2.3.2.). The responder rate (95% CI) of B-
cell depletion was 100% (63.06%, 100%) for Cohorts 2, 4, 5, and 6 and 87.5% (47.35%, 99.68%) for 
Cohorts 1 and 3 (Table 10). 
Table 10: CD19+ B-cell Depletion Responder Rate (ITT Population) 
CD, cluster of differentiation; CI, confidence interval; ITT, intent-to-treat. a Responder was defined as subjects with ≥95% peripheral 
CD19+  B-cell  depletion  from  baseline  within  2  weeks  after  the  second  ublituximab  infusion  (Week  3  Day  15).  b  The  95%  CI  was 
estimated using the Clopper-Pearson (exact) method. 
The  median  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  CD19+  B  cell  count  was  -98.6%  within  24  hours 
following the first infusion of ublituximab (Week 1 Day 2); B-cell reduction was sustained 2 weeks later 
at  Week  3  Day  15  (immediately  prior  to  the  second  infusion  of  ublituximab:  -99.1%),  at  Week  4  (-
99.2%), at Week 24 (immediately prior to the third infusion of ublituximab: -98.6%), and also at Week 
48/end of study (-98.9%). 
The  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  CD19+  B  cell  count  was  generally  similar  across  cohorts. 
Reductions in memory (CD19+CD27+) and naïve (CD19+CD27-) B cells were also observed across all 
cohorts from Week 1 Day 2 through Week 48/end of study (Figure 4).

B  lymphocyte  cell  counts  (%  CD19+  B  cells)  were  tabulated  per  scheduled  time  point  together  with 
absolute  and  percentage  changes  from  baseline.    Blood  collection  for  CD19+  B-Cell  Counts  was 
performed at screening, Days 1, 2, 8, and 15; Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84; and 
end of study. 
Overall, participants in the ublituximab group had a greater decrease in the mean number of CD19+ B 
cells over the 116-week study period than participants in the teriflunomide group. 
The mean number of CD19+ B cells at baseline was similar in both treatment groups (224.9 cells/μL in 
the  ublituximab  group  and  223.9  cells/μL  in  the  teriflunomide  group).  Starting  at  Week  1  Day  2, 
participants  in  the  ublituximab  group  had  a  notable  decrease  from  baseline  in  the  mean  number  of 
CD19+ B cells (-216.5 cells/μL [95.46% reduction]), which remained generally consistent through Week 
116 (-156.7 cells/μL [78.63% reduction]). 
Participants in the teriflunomide group had a slight increase from baseline in the mean number of CD19+ 
B cells at Week 1 Day 2 (92.6 cells/μL [56.11% increase]) and Week 2 (20.6 cells/μL [15.28% increase]) 
and fluctuated within <2% through Week 116.

Secondary pharmacology 
QT 
An electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment was conducted as part of the 4-week, repeat-dose, GLP monkey 
toxicology study. Ublituximab was administered IV to monkeys (3 per sex per group) at dose levels of 0 
(vehicle control), 10, or 50 mg/kg once weekly for 4 weeks. ECG examinations were performed on all 
animals  before  the  beginning  of  the  treatment  period,  60  minutes  and  6  hours  after  the  first 
administration (Day 1), and 6 hours after treatment on Days 8, 15, and 22. These examinations were 
performed  using  a  Cardiovit  AT-6  Schiller  instrument  and  standard  leads  I,  II,  and  III.  In  the  first 
instance, the heart rate, PQ and QT intervals, and the QRS-complex duration were determined on lead 
II. Animals were lightly anesthetised with ketamine hydrochloride. 
No ublituximab-related abnormalities in rhythm or waveform morphology were found at any dose level 
based  on  comparison  of  pre-dose  and  post-dose  ECG  recordings.  There  were  no  ublituximab-related 
changes in ECG parameters. A few observed qualitative ECG abnormalities were considered incidental 
findings unrelated to ublituximab treatment. The highest dose evaluated (50 mg/kg) resulted in a mean 
Cmax  and  mean  AUC  of  1480  μg/mL  and  7270  μg*hr/mL,  respectively,  on  Day  22  of  the  study.  ECG 
assessments  were  also  included  in  the  13-week  and  26-week  repeat-dose,  GLP  monkey  toxicology 
studies  with  no  ublituximab-related  changes  in  ECG  parameters  in  both  studies.  The  highest  dose 
evaluated (30 mg/kg) resulted in a Cmax and AUC of 1060 μg/mL and 74000 μg*hr/mL, respectively, on 
Day 176 of the 26-week study. 
No  dedicated  QTc  clinical  studies  were  performed.  During  monkey  toxicology  study  no  ublituximab 
related  abnormalities  in  rhythm  or  waveform  morphology  were  found  at  any  dose  regimen  tested, 
compared to the baseline pre-dose ECG recordings. 
Immunogenicity 
In Study TG1101-RMS201, TE-ADA was detected in 21 (52.5%) of 40 evaluable subjects at 1 or more 
timepoints. Among the subjects with a positive TE-ADA response, NAb were only detected in 1 out of 40 
subjects  (2.5%).  While  a  decrease  in  B-cell  depletion  was  noted  at  Week  24  for  this  subject,  B-cell

depletion was similar to the NAb negative population by Week 48. Additionally, there was no impact on 
ARR or safety for this subject. 
In  a  pooled  analysis  of  Studies  TG1101-RMS301  and  TG1101-RMS302,  TE-ADA  was  detected  in  434 
(81.3%) of 534 evaluable subjects at 1 or more timepoints in either study.  
No meaningful effect of ADA presence on PK, PD (mean % change in B-lymphocytes), efficacy (ARR) and 
safety (any TEAE all grades and grade ≥3, AESI all grades, grade ≥3 and infusion related reactions all 
grades) endpoint was observed. 
The  applicant  analysed  the  impact  of  Nab  status  on  secondary  efficacy  endpoints.  No  significant 
differences were observed for Nab-positive and Nab-negative participants. Secondary efficacy outcomes 
of patients with neutralizing antibody positive (n=34) and neutralizing antibody negative (n=500) status 
were  compared.  There  was  no  meaningful  impact  of  neutralizing  antibody  on  secondary  efficacy 
endpoints of ublituximab in Studies TG1101-RMS301 and TG1101-RMS302. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
No PD interaction studies were performed. Ublituximab is not considered to enhance or reduce the effect 
of other substances.  
Genetic differences in PD response 
Genetic profile is not expected to affect PD of ublituximab. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
According  to  the  dose  finding  study  (TG1101-RMS201),  similar  reduction  in  CD19+  B-cell  counts  was 
seen across dose cohorts 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK profile of ublituximab in RMS patients was characterised during clinical studies TG1101-RMS201, 
TG1101-RMS301,  and  TG1101-RMS302.  Further,  a  PopPK  model  was  also  developed  using  data  from 
clinical studies TG1101-RMS201, TG1101-RMS301, and TG1101-RMS302 (TGTX-PMX-TGl 101-2920). A 
covariate impact on PK of ublituximab PK was also assessed.  
Bioanalytical methods were developed, validated and performed to support the clinical development of 
the ublituximab. Following techniques were developed: ECLIA for ublituximab detection in human serum 
(validation 01128004), ECLIA for ADA detection in human serum (validation 01128007), and cell-based 
assay for the detection of neutralising anti-TG-1101 antibodies in human serum (validation 01128016). 
All  methods  were  validated  according  to  the  guidelines:  EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006  and 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009. There were several concerns pertaining these bioanalytical studies. 
As per study No. 01128004, the applicant was asked to justify the reliability between validated and long-
term storage conditions for pivotal studies bioanalyses (No. 01128018, No. 01128012, No. 01128013), 
as only results for 686 days of storage stability were initially provided (Study No. 01128004) and study 
samples  were  stored  significantly  longer.  The  applicant  provided  stability  at  1044  days  (about  34 
months), however the LTS period do not cover the period of storage of samples. The applicant committed 
to provide by Q3 of 2023 long term storage data covering 45 months i.e. the maximum storage period 
for  samples  from  clinical  studies  RMS201,  RMS301  and  RMS302  (REC).  Further,  the  applicant  was 
requested to clarify the findings from two cross-site validations presented in this report however it was 
determined the popPK model for the RMS programme is comprised mostly of data from the validated 
ELISA method. 
Assessment report

As per study No. 01128007, the applicant was requested to provide the long-term stability data. The 
applicant declared that the assessment is ongoing to cover the entire period of storage for study samples. 
During the procedure, the applicant submitted an amendment 2 of the validation report including long-
term stability at 923 days (~30 months). The data was considered acceptable but to cover the maximum 
storage period (56 months), data for other 32 months is neededThe applicant committed to provide by 
Q2 of 2024 the full Long Term Storage data of ADA to cover samples in clinical trials RMS201, RMS301 
and  RMS302  and  to  formalise  this  commitment  via  the  letter  of  recommendation  as  a  post  approval 
measure (REC). This proposal was considered acceptable. 
The BA reports for ADA determination were provided for RMS201 (01128010), RMS301 (01128017) and 
RMS302  (01128018).  The  applicant  did  not  provide  the  corresponding  ublituximab  concentrations  for 
ADA  samples,  however,  for  RMS301  and  RMS302  it  is  reported  that  2.2%  (6  subjects)  and  2.9%  (8 
subjects), respectively, of subjects showed ublituximab concentrations above the PC (100 ng/ml) drug 
tolerance of 25 µg/ml. Of them, 3 for RMS301 and 6 for RMS302 were ADA negative, but these results 
are unreliable.  Ublituximab concentrations were not available for RMS201 in which 52.2% of subjects 
were ADA positive, precluding the identification of samples above the drug tolerance level. Upon request, 
the applicant provided the addendum of ISI report in which for study RMS201, RMS301 and RMS302 all 
ublituximab  and  ADA  determinations  at  each  timepoint  are  reported.  Only  18  subjects  showed 
ublituximab concentration above the DTL at one (or two) timepoint. However, all these subjects have an 
alternate ADA-evaluable sample in which the ublituximab concentrations are below the DTL, therefore 
the conclusions on their ADA status can be considered reliable. Seven subjects were ADA negative at the 
timepoint in which ublituximab concentrations were above the DTL, however they were classified as TE-
ADA since the presence of other available and reliable determinations. Five subjects were ADA negative 
at the timepoint in which ublituximab concentrations were above the DTL and were not TE-ADA since 
they were negative at all other reliable timepoints or the subject is ADA positive at baseline. The applicant 
response was considered acceptable.  
As per Nab assay validation (01128016), it was noted that several Nab negative samples had ublituximab 
concentration above the drug tolerance (0.1 μg/mL) at LPC and lipemia interference therefore impacting 
the reliability of negative results, however upon further clarification   
the impact of these unreliable Nab determinations is considered limited.  
The applicant was requested to clarify how many TE-ADA positive participants have been tested for Nab 
determination and how many Nab negative participants had ublituximab concentrations exceeding the 
DTL.  The  majority  of  samples  had  ublituximab  concentrations  above  1000  ng/ml  and  considering  the 
drug tolerance at HPC (1000 ng/ml), out of a total of 420 Nab negative patients, 35 had ublituximab 
concentration above DTL at more than 1 trough timepoints and 8 at all timepoints, therefore the last 8 
patients  are  considered  not  reliable  for  Nab  determination.  The  impact  of  these  unreliable  Nab 
determinations  is  considered  limited.  Overall,  in  study  RMS201,  TE-ADA  were  21/40  and  1  is  Nab 
positive;  in  RMS301  and  RMS302  TE-ADA  were  434/534  of  which  34  were  Nab  positive.  The  active 
comparator  used  in  the  pivotal  trials  TG1101-RMS301  and  TG  1101-RMS302  was  an  unlicensed 
teriflunomide  product  bioequivalent  to  Aubagio  which,  after  the  conduct  of  the  pivotal  trials,  received 
FDA  approval  through  an  abbreviated  new  drug  application  (ANDA)  supported  by  two  bioequivalence 
studies. The applicant informed that the product received FDA approval (ANDA 209583) on 24 September 
2021 and the status remains unchanged. The  applicant also clarified that only one active comparator 
was used throughout both pivotal trials for all sites, countries and subjects. The applicant provided the 
case study reports of two bioequivalence studies comparing teriflunomide medicinal product provided by 
TG  therapeutics  with  Aubagio.  Giving  the  lack  of  several  information,  the  applicant  was  requested  to 
submit  all  documentation  for  the  two  bioequivalent  studies,  namely  150123  and  150124.  The  two 
bioequivalent studies 150123 and 150124 were correctly performed in terms of enrolled subjects, wash-
out  period,  sampling.  It  was  declared  that  they  were  conducted  in  GCP  compliance.  The  bioanalytical

method used to determine teriflunomide concentrations was validated and the validation report as well 
as  the  bioanalytical  reports  were  attached  in  the  dossier.  A  PopPK  model  was  developed  to  predict 
ublituximab PK parameters; estimated Ve and Vp were 3.18 L (IIV=15.0%) and 3.60 L (IIV=21.3%), 
respectively. The model estimated CL was 11.3 mL/h (IIV of 38.1%). Mean t1/2 was calculated to be 
21.8  days.  Bodyweight,  sex  region,  and  ADA  presence  were  found  to  be  significant  covariates  of 
ublituximab PK. These covariates had a modest effect on exposures (all results contained within the 0.8 
to 1.25 exposure ratio), and they are not supposed to be clinically relevant. Age, baseline haemoglobin, 
platelet count and white blood cell count, renal impairment and hepatic impairment were not found to 
be significant predictors of ublituximab PK. It was noted that Cmin-ss varies up to 65% between covariate 
categories  in  the  popPK  and  the  applicant  was  requested  to  clarify  justify  that  predicted  values  are 
considerate reliable. The applicant clarified that Cmin was determined 24 weeks after dose administration 
(>7 half-lives) and at these concentrations a 65% relative difference in covariate categories represents 
an  absolute  difference  of  only  0.082  μg/mL,  which  is  more  than  100-fold  lower  than  the  Cavg.  It  was 
agreed that the impact of 65% variability is not clinically relevant. Ublituximab CL in the popPK model 
ranged from 22% lower to 48% higher compared to that for a typical subject with a body weight of 73 
kg  across  the  ranges  of  body  weights  (median  weight  69  kg,  range  45.1  to  154.0  kg),  however,  as 
observed in the exposure-safety and exposure-efficacy analyses, ublituximab exposure had no impact 
on safety or efficacy observations in the RMS population. A overprediction has been observed, possible 
reason  could  be  the  high  data  variability,  also  in  the  observed  data,  considering  the  very  broad 
concentration range of predicted data. This makes difficult the prediction of plasma concentrations and 
its use as base for further analysis, e.g. E-R and product information. In addition, the exposure-response 
relationship between Ublituximab Cmax-ss and ARR showed partial overlap making this analysis not useful 
to individuate the concentration, thus the corresponding dose, responsible for the target ARR. The same 
is also true for total number of Gd enhancing T1-lesions per MRI scan at week 96. 
As per dose proportionality and time dependency, data from study TGTX1101-101 seems to not support 
the dose proportionality between 450 mg and 1200 mg. In the submitted figures of observed ublituximab 
plasma concentrations versus time after dose for all studies, doses below 300 mg were almost absent, 
thus  no  support  for  dose  ~300  mg  As  per  the  model-predicted  ublituximab  concentrations,  exposure 
data between 450 mg and 600 mg did not show a clear dose-proportionality also considering the high 
variability.  Therefore,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  narrow  the  range  for  the  dose  proportionality 
between 150 mg and 450 mg in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
No special population studies were performed to characterise PK parameters of ublituximab. According 
to the popPK, body weight, sex, region, and ADA were significant covariates of ublituximab PK. None of 
them seems clinically relevant, and no dose adjustment needs to be implemented. No studies with renal 
and hepatic impaired patients were conducted. According to the pop PK data, the PK of ublituximab were 
not  differentiated  between  the  subjects  with  mild  renal  impairment  and  normal  renal  function  and 
between  patients  with  mild  or  moderate  hepatic  impairment  and  normal  hepatic  function.  The  last  is 
additionally supported as ublituximab is expected to be degraded to small peptides and amino acids by 
ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes that are not restricted to the hepatic tissue.  The population database 
for the ublituximab popPK includes participants with MS and with haematologic malignancies up to 88 
years of age, with 171 participants (65 in TG1101-RMS303 as per 01 March 2022 safety update cut-off) 
≥65  years  of  age.  The  popPK  did  not  show  a  significant  relationship  between  age  and  ublituximab 
exposure.  It  also  did  not  show  a  relationship  between  disease  (MS,  haematologic  malignancies)  and 
ublituximab  clearance.  Based  on  the  totality  of  data,  it  can  be  agreed  that  the  PK  of  ublituximab  is 
expected to be the same in older patients with MS. Therefore, no posology adjustment is recommended 
in patients with MS over 55 years of age. The applicant's argumentation is acceptable.  
PD characteristic of ublituximab was developed in clinical studies: TG1101-RMS201, TG1101-RMS301, 
and  TG1101-RMS302.  In  dose  response  study  TG1101-RMS201,  B-cell  depletion  within  target  range

(95%)  was  maintained  before  ublituximab  dosing  at  Week  24  and  was  sustained  at  Week  48  with  a 
similar reduction in CD19+ B-cell counts across dose cohorts (150 mg, 450 mg and 600 mg). Further, a 
reduction in CD4+ and increased T reg expression was seen. In studies, TG1101-RMS301, and TG1101-
RMS302, at week 1 day 2, patients administrated with ublituximab had a significant decrease of CD19 
B-cells from baseline (above 95% reduction) and was maintained through week 116.  
No  meaningful  effect  of  ADA  presence  on  PK,  PD  efficacy  and  safety  endpoints  was  observed.  No 
significant differences were observed for Nab-positive and Nab-negative participants. Secondary efficacy 
outcomes  of  patients  with  neutralizing  antibody  positive  (n=34)  and  neutralizing  antibody  negative 
(n=500) status were compared. There was no meaningful impact of neutralizing antibody on secondary 
efficacy endpoints of ublituximab in Studies TG1101-RMS301 and TG1101-RMS302. 
No  dedicated  QTc  clinical  studies  were  performed.  During  monkey  toxicology  study  no  ublituximab 
related  abnormalities  in  rhythm  or  waveform  morphology  were  found  at  any  dose  regimen  tested, 
compared to the baseline pre-dose ECG recordings.  
No PD interaction studies were performed. Ublituximab is not considered to enhance or reduce the effect 
of other substances. Upon request, the applicant address the potential of PD interaction ins section 4.5 
of the SmPC.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology programme is acceptable.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
• 
• 
The applicant should provide by Q3 of 2023 the Long Term Storage data covering 45 months i.e. 
the maximum storage period for samples from clinical studies RMS201, RMS301 and RMS302. 
The applicant should provide by Q2 of 2024 full Long Term Storage data of ADA to cover samples 
in clinical trials RMS201, RMS301 and RMS302. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study TG1101-RMS201 
Methods 
Study TG1101-RMS201 was a 52-week, Phase IIa, placebo-controlled, multicentre, dose-finding, cohort-
sequential study. The study included 6 treatment cohorts, each with 8 subjects: 6 subjects randomised 
to receive ublituximab and 2 subjects randomised receive to placebo. 
Eligible  subjects  were  18  to  55  years  of  age,  with  a  diagnosis  of  RMS  by  McDonald  criteria  2010,  ≥2 
relapses  in  prior  2  years  or  1  relapse  in  the  year  prior  to  Screening  and/or  ≥1  Gd-enhancing  lesion, 
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0 to 5.5 (inclusive), B cell counts ≥5% of total lymphocytes, 
and neurologic stability ≥30 days prior to Screening and baseline. 
Subjects within each treatment cohort received either ublituximab on Days 1, 15, and Week 24 or placebo 
on Days 1 and 15. Following completion of Day 28 (Week 4), all subjects randomised to receive placebo 
entered their respective “a” cohort and received active treatment with ublituximab (Table 11). For all 6 
cohorts, the first infusion was a single dose of 150 mg of ublituximab ranging from 1 to 4 hours. The 
second infusion was on Day 15, ublituximab 450 mg ranging from 1 to 3 hours or 600 mg for 1 hour. 
Assessment report

The third infusion was on Week 24, ublituximab 450 mg ranging from 1 to 1.5 hours or 600 mg for 1 
hour. 
Table 11: Dosing Schema for Ublituximab and Placebo in Study TG1101-RMS201 (Dose Range) 
Following completion of Day 28 (Week 4), all subjects randomised to receive placebo entered their respective "a" cohort and received 
active treatment with ublituximab 
Baseline assessments were done within 28 days prior to Day 1. MRI scans were performed at Screening 
and repeated every 24 weeks thereafter (Weeks 24 and 48). In the event that the subject’s condition 
was deteriorating, laboratory evaluations were repeated within 48 hours prior to initiation of the next 
infusion. 
Participants who were in good health with stable disease were allowed to enter the extended open-label 
phase of the study (Study TG1101-RMS201E) at the end of the study. Almost all participants (45/48) 
were enrolled in the extended phase of the trial.  
Diagnosis of RMS was based on the 2010 McDonald’s criteria. Stable disease  was measured from the 
start of the study treatment until the criteria for relapse or progression of disease were met or there was 
evidence of new radiological activity as assessed by MRI, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements. 
All  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  using  the  ITT,  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  and  modified  ITT  (mITT) 
populations. All hypothesis tests were descriptive and conducted at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05; 
no multiplicity adjustment was done. 
The primary efficacy variable was responder rate of B-cell depletion at Week 4, which was the proportion 
of subjects who had reduced B-cell depletion by ≥95% at Week 4 (2 weeks after Week 3 Day 15, the 
second scheduled infusion of ublituximab) in the ITT population.  
The following secondary efficacy variables were summarised using descriptive statistics: B-cell reduction 
(CD19+,  memory  [CD19+CD27+],  and  naïve  [CD19+CD27-]),  number  of  new  Gd-enhancing  lesions, 
Assessment report

number of new or enlarging T2 lesions,  ARR at Week 48, relapse rate reduction [RRR],  percentage of 
relapse-free  subjects,  and  additional  immune  profiling  (CD4+,  CD8+,  interleukin  [IL]10,  and  Natural 
Killer cells). 
Results 
A total of 49 subjects were randomised; of these, 48 subjects received at least 1 dose of ublituximab 
and were included in the ITT population. One subject in Cohort 4 was discontinued due to an AE and 
received  placebo  only.  This  subject  did  not  receive  ublituximab  and  was  not  included  in  the  ITT 
population. 
As  per  the  primary  efficacy  variable,  the  responder  rate  (95%  CI)  of  B-cell  depletion  at  Week  4  was 
95.8%  (85.75%,  99.49%).  Table  10  presented  the  CD19+  B-cell  Depletion  Responder  Rate  (ITT 
Population).  
The  median  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  CD19+  B-cell  count  was  -98.6%  within  24  hours 
following the first infusion of ublituximab (Week 1 Day 2). The reduction was sustained 2 weeks later at 
Week 3 Day 15 (immediately prior to the second infusion of ublituximab: -99.1%), and continued with 
a  reduction  of  -98.9%  at  Week  48/end  of  study.  Reductions  in  memory  (CD19+CD27+)  and  naïve 
(CD19+CD27-)  B  cells  were  also  observed  from  Week  1  Day  2  through  Week  48/end  of  study.  The 
applicant did not evaluate B-cell repletion after ublituximab withdrawal.  
Within 1 year prior to Screening, the cumulative number of relapses was 71, with an ARR at baseline of 
1.48 (Table 12). At the end of study, following cumulative treatment time of 43.33 subject years, the 
cumulative number of confirmed relapses was 4, and 91.7% of subjects were relapse free. The ARR at 
the end of study was 0.09, a reduction of 93.76% from baseline.

The median percentage change from baseline at Week 48/end of study was 1.3% for CD4+, -15.9% for 
CD8+, 183.7% for IL10, and 3.6% for Natural Killer cells. 
The majority of subjects did not have either CDP or confirmed disability impairment (CDI) for at least 24 
weeks (77.1%); 3 subjects (6.3%) had CDP for at least 24 weeks, and 8 subjects (16.7%) had CDI for 
at least 24 weeks. 
Thirty-three subjects (68.8%) had no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) from baseline to Week 48; 41 
subjects (85.4%) had no evidence of clinical disease activity, and 40 subjects (83.3%) had no evidence 
of MRI disease activity. 
There were several protocol violations and nearly half of them were attributed to a single investigator 
site (Site CUA with 10 subjects were significant GCP violations and other non-compliance issues occurred. 
A sensitivity analysis excluding data for 10 subjects from Site CUA showed that there was no meaningful 
difference in the study population, outcome, or conclusion with or without the 10 subjects from that site. 
(Table 13). Other major deviations were missed laboratory assessments, inclusion/exclusion criteria not 
met and protocol violations related with informed consent.

Subjects  were  screened  up  to  4  weeks  (28  days)  before  the  first  dosing  date  of  study  medication 
(ublituximab/oral placebo or teriflunomide/IV placebo). Qualified subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive either ublituximab/oral placebo on Week 1 Day 1, Week 3 Day 15, and Weeks 24, 48, and 72 
or teriflunomide/IV placebo (14 mg, daily starting on Week 1 Day 1 until the last day of Week 95). Upon 
cessation of study treatment, the subjects were followed for another 20 weeks to enable teriflunomide 
elimination monitoring.

•  Objectives 
Primary objective: to determine the ARR in participants with RMS after 96 weeks (approximately 2 years 
with a year equal to 365.25 days) treatment with IV infusion of ublituximab/oral placebo compared to 
14 mg oral teriflunomide/IV placebo. 
Secondary objectives:  
• 
• 
To examine the effects of ublituximab/oral placebo as compared to teriflunomide/IV placebo on 
MRI parameters, CDP, NEDA, symbol digit modalities test (SDMT). 
To evaluate the safety of ublituximab/oral placebo, as determined by AEs and SAEs, including 
MS worsening 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: the primary efficacy variable (per patient) is the number of IRAP-confirmed relapses 
which started on or after the day of randomisation and up to the day of last study treatment. Then, ARR 
was defined as the number of Independent Relapse Adjudication Panel (IRAP)-confirmed relapses per 
participant  year.  The  estimate  of  ARR  for  a  treatment  group  was  the  total  number  of  relapses  for 
participants in the respective treatment group divided by the sum of treatment duration (in years) in 
that specific treatment group. Participants were treated up to 96 weeks. 
Secondary Endpoints (as per order in hierarchical testing): 
1. Total number of Gd-enhancing T1-lesions per MRI scan by Week 96 
2. Total number of new and enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions (NEL) per MRI scan by Week 96 
3. Time to CDP for at least 12 weeks (12-week CDP) occurring during the 96-week double-blind treatment 
period*. The time to onset of 12-week CDP was the time to progression defined as an increase in EDSS 
of at least 1 point higher than the baseline EDSS if the baseline EDSS was ≤5.5 or at least 0.5 higher 
than the baseline EDSS if the baseline EDSS was >5.5. Disability progression was considered confirmed 
when the increase in the EDSS score was confirmed at regularly scheduled visits at least 12 or 24 weeks 
after the initial documentation of neurological worsening (unscheduled visits not included). The “time-
to-event” was the time from randomisation to the date of the first measurement of the increased EDSS 
as required above with confirmed progression. If no event occurred, the time to CDP was regarded as 
censored at the last scheduled EDSS assessment.

EMA/173313/2023  
Page 69/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. Proportion of participants with NEDA from Week 24 to Week 96. A subject with NEDA was defined as 
a  subject  without  relapses  confirmed  by  the  IRAP,  without  MRI  activities  (no  T1  Gd+  lesions  and  no 
new/enlarging T2 lesions), and no 12-week CDP. Any evidence of disease activity from Week 24 to Week 
96 was counted as not reaching NEDA (e.g., a Week 24 MRI lesion would count as not reaching NEDA). 
Any evidence of disease activity before Week 24 was not counted. In case of early termination at any 
timepoint (including before Week 24), even if an event was not reported before early discontinuation, 
the subject was considered as not reaching NEDA. 
5.  Proportion  of  participants  reaching  impaired  SDMT  from  baseline  to  Week  96.  Impaired  SDMT  was 
defined as a decrease from baseline of at least 4 points at any post-baseline SDMT assessment up to the 
Week 96 visit. 
6. Percentage change in brain volume from baseline to Week 96 
* It was analysed using pooled data from the 2 identical studies (TG110--RMS301 and TG1101-RMS302). 
Tertiary Endpoints 
1. Change in multiple sclerosis functional composite (MSFC) score from baseline to Week 96 
2. Time to CDP for at least 24 weeks 
3. Time to CDI for at least 12 weeks 
4. Time to CDI for at least 24 weeks 
5. Health outcomes (MSQoL-54 [inclusive of SF-36]; Fatigue Impact Scale, hospitalisation, steroid use, 
time out of work). The MSQoL-54 is a multidimensional health-related quality of life measurement that 
combines generic and MS-specific items into a single assessment. 
6. Total volume of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions per MRI scan over the Treatment Period 
7. Volume of T2 lesions 
8. Volume of hypointense T1 lesions (black holes) 
9. Proportion of participants free of disability progression at 24 weeks, 48 weeks, and 96 weeks 
10. Proportion of participants with a relapse 
11. Time to first confirmed relapse 
•  Sample size 
Assessment report  
EMA/173313/2023  
Page 70/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The sample size for each trial is based on achieving a 40% reduction in ARR with ocrelizumab (another 
anti-CD20 mAb) based on the results of the OPERA I and II studies. The ARR for teriflunomide was based 
on the results from the TENERE and TEMSO, which reported an ARR of approximately 29%. Thus, the 
hypothesised difference for each trial is expected to be a reduction in ARR of approximate of 40% in the 
ublituximab/ oral placebo group as compared to teriflunomide/IV placebo. 
In the TEMSO study, the ARR was 0.319 and to allow for some drift to lower rates and some level of 
conservative  estimates,  the  applicant  hypothesised  the  teriflunomide/oral  placebo  ARR  would  be 
approximately 0.29 yielding an ARR for ublituximab/placebo of 0.174 requiring 200 subjects per group. 
Thus, using a two-sided test of the null hypothesis H0: RR=1.00 vs. the alternative Ha: RR≠1.00 using 
the m likelihood estimate test statistic in a negative binomial regression model, samples of 220 subjects 
in the Teriflunomide/oral placebo Group with an average exposure time of 1.75 years and 220 subjects 
in  Ublituximab/placebo  Group  with  an  average  exposure  time  of  1.75  years  achieves  80%  power  to 
detect an event rate ratio of 0.60 when the event rate in the teriflunomide/oral placebo Group (λ1) is 
0.29  and  the  overall  Type  I  error  level  (alpha)  is  0.05  assuming  a  negative  binomial  regression 
distribution  for  the  number  of  relapses  in  participants  over  the  100  weeks  of  follow-up.  To  allow  for 
potential  losses  of  up  to  10%,  this  required  sample  size  is  increased  to  220  per  group  or  a  total 
randomised of 440 per trial. 
An  independent  committee,  blinded  assessment  relapse  team  (BART)  and  the  DSMB  reassessed  the 
sample size for the studies and recommended adding 30 patients per group. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Eligible participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the following treatment arms: ublituximab/oral 
placebo or teriflunomide/IV placebo. The Investigator accessed an Interactive Web Response System to 
enroll  participants,  obtain  unique  identification  numbers,  and  obtain  study  drug  kit  numbers.  No 
stratification factors were utilised in the randomisation process.  
These were double-blind, double-dummy studies. All oral study drugs were prepared in identical tablets 
and containers and all IV study drugs were prepared in identical vials to ensure adequate blinding. All 
personnel involved with the conduct and interpretation of the study, including the Investigators, study 
site personnel, and Sponsor were blinded to treatment until after the database was locked and the study 
was  officially  unblinded.  The  unblinding  of  a  participant’s  treatment  was  allowed  if  it  was  deemed 
necessary by the Investigator and Medical Monitor to provide immediate medical management. 
Relapse determinations by the IRAP were communicated to the treating neurologist, who then notified 
the  participant  and  updated  the  eCRF  accordingly.  The  IRAP  had  no  involvement  in  subsequent 
participant  management  decisions.  In  order  to  maintain  independence  and  blinding,  the  examining 
neurologist did not receive the report. Furthermore, neither the treating neurologist nor the participant 
could disclose the IRAP decision to the examining neurologist. The treating neurologist, upon receiving 
the IRAP decision, counseled the participant as described in the protocol. The participant needed to give 
her/his consent to continue study participation in the event of a confirmed relapse.

Primary efficacy endpoint 
The  primary  analysis  was  performed  using  the  mITT  with  a  negative  binomial  regression  model  to 
accommodate the potential over-dispersed data appropriately. The model included the total number of 
confirmed relapses with onset between randomisation date and the day of last treatment as response 
variable,  treatment  group,  EDSS  strata  (baseline  EDSS  score  ≤3.5  versus  >3.5)  and  region  as 
covariates. In order to account for different treatment durations among subjects, the log transformed 
standardised  treatment  duration  was  included  in  the  model  as  an  “offset”  variable  for  appropriate 
computation of the ARR. SAS PROC GENMOD was used to assess the overall model with subjects in a 
repeated statement using a generalised estimating equation (GEE) approach. 
For the primary endpoint, different sensitivity analyses were included: 
1. All relapses regardless of confirmation: the primary analysis was repeated based on all reported MS 
relapses (rather than just confirmed ones). 
2.  IRAP-confirmed  relapses  including  follow-up:  to  assess  the  effects  of  treatment  withdrawals,  the 
primary analysis was repeated using the information on relapses which occur during the period following 
drug withdrawal to the end of the study period regardless of whether additional treatment were utilised. 
Relapses which occurred after permanent discontinuation of study medication was included and natural 
log (time on study in years) rather than the natural log (time on study drug in years) was used as the 
offset variable in the negative binomial model, which is the primary analysis. 
3. Multiple imputation of withdrawn participants: the dropouts from the trial using all participants who 
provided withdrawal of consent excluding deaths were examined. Multiple imputation was used to impute 
the expected number of relapses a participant would have had if they had continued to participate in the 
trial. To perform the imputation, 10 replicates were used since a relapse on treatment is relatively low 
frequency event. The covariates used to model and predict the imputations included: treatment, region, 
number of relapses in previous year, baseline EDSS score strata (<3.5, ≥3.5), baseline number of T1 
Gd-enhancing lesions, sex and the subject’s age at baseline as covariates. 
4. A time to relapse analysis using Cox proportional hazards model with first IRAP-confirmed relapse as 
the primary event was conducted to compare with the primary analysis in a negative binomial model. 
The Cox proportional hazards model was specified with treatment, region, number of relapses in previous 
year, baseline EDSS score strata (<3.5, ≥3.5), baseline number of T1 Gd enhancing lesions, sex, and 
the subject’s age at baseline as covariates. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints 
Type I error was controlled by using a hierarchical gate-keeping procedure. Once primary endpoint was 
statistically significant at alpha=0.05, the secondary endpoints were tested in the pre-specified order as 
indicated  in  the  endpoint  section  and  Figure  8.  The  CDP  key  secondary  endpoint  was  considered 
confirmatory only if all tests for the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints (#1 and #2) before this 
test were statistically significant (α=0.05) in both studies.

The  treatment  group  difference  for  the  MRI  count  variables  was  assessed  using  negative  binomial 
regression with an offset based on log-transformed number of post-baseline MRI scans and covariates 
region, baseline EDSS strata, and corresponding baseline lesion count. 
The proportion of subjects who suffered CDP during the study at 2 years and associated 95% CIs for 
each treatment group were provided.  The median time-to-event with 2-sided 95% CIs as well as the 
proportion  of  subjects  remaining  event-free  at  times  of  interest  was  estimated  using  Kaplan-Meier 
method. 
NEDA rates were compared using logistic regression with the same baseline adjustments as used in the 
primary endpoint analysis, without treatment duration offset, but including log-transformed baseline MRI 
counts (T1, unenhancing; T2, Gd-enhancing). 
SDMT rates were compared using logistic regression with the same baseline adjustments as used in the 
primary endpoint analysis, without treatment duration offset, but including log-transformed baseline MRI 
counts (T1, unenhancing; T2, Gd-enhancing). 
The percentage change in brain volume was analysed using a Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) 
analysis by fitting percent change from baseline values on the cube root transformed volume from all 
visits after baseline in the treatment period with scheduled assessments of brain volume. 
For secondary outcomes T1 Gd enhancing, T2 NELs, and 12 week CDP, the effects of dropouts and study 
discontinuations were similarly evaluated as number 3 above. 
Further, there were two additional sensitivity analyses performed for the secondary endpoint 12-week 
CDP: Time to CDP for at least 12 weeks including unconfirmed progression at Week 96 and Time to CDP 
for at least 12 weeks including all unconfirmed progression

The ITT population consisted of all randomised subjects  
•  Recruitment 
Study Initiation Date (First Participant First Visit): 19 Sep 2017 (date of informed consent). 
Study Completion Date (Last Participant Last Visit): 06 Nov 2020 
A database lock date - 23 Nov 2020. 
The study TG1101-RMS301 was conducted at 60 study centres in 9 countries in Europe and North 
America. 
•  Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended seven times. All amendments applied to both studies RMS301 and RMS 
302. Protocol versions 1.0 and 2.0 were not implemented and participants were enrolled in the study 
beginning  with  protocol  version  2.1.  Only  3  protocol  versions  (3.0,  3.1,  and  3.2)  were  implemented 
during active enrolment, and the amendments for these protocol versions did not change any inclusion

or exclusion criteria and did not impact the study population. Protocol version 4.0 (17 Jan 2020) primarily 
implemented  important  safety  guidance  on  management  of  infection  and  introduced  the  open-label 
extension  Study  TG1101-RMS303.  Protocol  version  5.0  (04  Sep  2020)  refined  the  statistical  analysis 
language to align with the Statistical Analysis Plan (04 Sep 2020) and made minor study procedural and 
administrative updates. Most of the changes were done to clarify procedural issues. The amendments 
for these protocol versions did not impact the study population, change the primary or key secondary 
endpoints, or change the analysis methods. There were no changes after database lock. 
With protocol amendment 3.2 (dated 09 February 2018), that specifically applied to Ukraine recruitment 
sites (10 sites), a change in both studies was introduced as regards the comparator to specify that an 
unlicensed  bioequivalent  teriflunomide  product  was  used  in  place  of  the  marketed  reference  medical 
product. The applicant confirmed that there was only one form of the active comparator used throughout 
both pivotal studies for all sites and participants. The active comparator was an unlicensed teriflunomide 
product bioequivalent to Aubagio that was under an active IMPD during the conduct of the studies and 
which, after the conduct of the pivotal trials,  received FDA approval through an ANDA. 
•  Baseline data 
The  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  were  similar  for  subjects  in  the  ublituximab  and 
teriflunomide  groups.  For the  ublituximab  group,  the  median  (range)  age  was  36.0  (18  to  55)  years, 
61.3% of subjects were female, 97.4% of subjects were White, 95.9% of subjects were not Hispanic or 
Latino,  and  90.4%  of  subjects  were  from  Eastern  Europe.  For  the  teriflunomide  group,  the  median 
(range) age was 36.5 (18 to 55) years, 65.3% of subjects were female, 97.1% of subjects were White, 
97.1% of subjects were not Hispanic or Latino, and 88.7% of subjects were from Eastern Europe. 
The  MS  disease  history  was  generally  similar  in  the  2  treatment  groups:  mean  time  since  first  MS 
symptoms (ublituximab: 7.5 years, teriflunomide: 6.8 years), mean time since diagnosis (ublituximab: 
4.9 years; teriflunomide: 4.5 years), mean time since most recent relapse (ublituximab: 6.4 months; 
teriflunomide: 5.8 months), and 1 to 2 relapses in the 1 year prior to Screening (ublituximab: 90.8%, 
teriflunomide:  91.9%).  The  majority  of  subjects  had  a  baseline  EDSS  of  ≤3.5  (ublituximab:  73.8%, 
teriflunomide: 75.9%). More than half of subjects had no Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline (ublituximab: 
56.5%, teriflunomide: 56.9%). In the study, almost exclusively took part the participants with RRMS. 
There were only 7 (2.6%) and 4 (1.5%) SPMS in the ublituximab and teriflunomide arm respectively. 
The percentage of subjects with prior MS treatment was similar in the two treatment groups: MS therapy 
for at least 1 month (ublituximab: 39.5%, teriflunomide: 39.8%) and MS therapy in the past 5 years 
(ublituximab:  40.2%,  teriflunomide:  40.9%).  The  most  common  types  of  MS  therapy  (≥10%  in  any 
treatment group) were glatiramer acetate (ublituximab: 16.6%, teriflunomide: 13.1%) and interferon 
beta-1a (ublituximab: 12.2%, teriflunomide: 9.1%). Similar proportions of subjects previously received 
corticosteroid treatment for relapses in the ublituximab and teriflunomide groups (94.8% and 92.7%, 
respectively), with a mean time since  last dose of  corticosteroid treatment for relapse of 8.6 and  7.9 
months in the ublituximab and teriflunomide groups, respectively. 
Most subjects received 5 infusions that were >50% complete. See

•  Numbers analysed 
The ITT Population consisted of 549 participants overall, with 274 participants in the ublituximab group 
and 275 participants in the teriflunomide group. One randomised participant did not receive study drug 
and was excluded from the Safety Population. Four participants were excluded from the mITT Population, 
which consisted of 545 (99.3%) participants. Ten participants did not have baseline or post-baseline MRI 
efficacy assessments and were thus excluded from the mITT-MRI Population (N=535). 
The PP Population included 467 (85.1%) participants, with 83.2% of subjects in the ublituximab group 
and 86.9% of participants in the teriflunomide group. Two participants did not have baseline and post-
baseline  MRI  efficacy  assessments  and  were  thus  excluded  from  the  PP-MRI  Population.  The  PK 
Population included 531 (96.7%) participants. 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The  treatment  effect  of  ublituximab  versus  teriflunomide  was  statistically  significant  in  favour  of 
ublituximab (Table 16). Similar findings were reported for the ITT population and the PP population.

Relapse recovery categorisation (Kantarci et al 2019) – Full recovery: EDSS returns to pre-relapse levels at any timepoint within 24 
weeks (+1-week window) of symptom onset, Partial recovery: EDSS remains elevated vs. pre-relapse levels at all timepoints within 
24 weeks (+1-week window) of symptom onset 
Upon request, the applicant presented the analysis of the partial recovery in relation to EDSS change 
during  treatment.  The  percentages  of  partial  recovery  from  relapse  with  EDSS  score  increase  ≤0.5 
(ublituximab  14.7%  and  teriflunomide  13.0%)  and  with  1.0  (ublituximab  32.6%  and  teriflunomide 
31.3%)  were  similar  in  both  treated  groups.    For  relapses  with  an  EDSS  increase  of  1.5-2.0,  the 
proportion  of  relapses  with  partial  recovery  is  more  significant  for  ublituximab  (71.4%)  versus 
teriflunomide (36.0%). In contrast, for relapses with EDSS increase ≥2.5, the percent partial recovery 
is greater for teriflunomide (71.4%) versus ublituximab (50.0%). 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints 
1. Total Number of Gadolinium-enhancing T1 Lesions per MRI Scan by Week 96 
The  treatment  effect  of  ublituximab  versus  teriflunomide  was  statistically  significant  in  favor  of 
ublituximab  (Table  20).  Similar  findings  were  reported  for  the  ITT  population  and  for  the  PP-MRI 
population.

Sensitivity  analysis  of  the  total  number  of  Gd-enhancing  T1  lesions  per  MRI  scan  at  Week  96  using 
multiple imputation showed similar results. The LS mean for the number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions per 
MRI scan was 0.018 (95% CI: 0.009, 0.034) in the ublituximab group and 0.551 (95% CI: 0.391, 0.777) 
in the teriflunomide group. The treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of ublituximab at a 
ratio of 0.032 (95% CI: 0.018, 0.056; p<0.0001), corresponding to a reduction of 96.8%. 
2. Total Number of New and Enlarging T2 Hyperintense Lesions per MRI Scan by Week 96 
The  treatment  effect  of  ublituximab  versus  teriflunomide  was  statistically  significant  in  favor  of 
ublituximab  (Table  21).  Similar  findings  were  reported  for  the  ITT  population  and  for  the  PP-MRI 
population.

Tertiary efficacy endpoints 
1. Change in MSFC Score From Baseline to Week 96 
At  baseline,  the  mean  MSFC  score  was  -0.034  for  subjects  in  the  ublituximab  group  and  0.046  for 
subjects in the teriflunomide group. Subjects in the ublituximab group consistently had a greater mean 
increase from baseline of the MSFC score than subjects in the teriflunomide group from Week 12 through 
Week 96. The LS mean for the change from baseline in MSFC score at Week 96 was 0.469 (95% CI: 
0.301, 0.638) in the ublituximab group and 0.266 (95% CI: 0.100, 0.432) in the teriflunomide group, 
with a numerical difference in favour of ublituximab of 0.203 (95% CI: 0.001, 0.405). 
2-4. Time to 24-weeks CDP, time to 12-weeks CDI and time to 24-weeks CDI 
For the 24-week CDP and 12- and 24-week CDI endpoints, the pooled analyses using data from studies 
TG1101-RMS301 and TG1101-RMS302 are done. 
5. Health outcomes 
At baseline, the mean values were similar between the ublituximab and teriflunomide groups for all 12 
subscales, the 2 summary physical health subscale, the health distress subscale, and the SF-36 physical 
functioning, the LS mean differences were in favour of ublituximab at 3.749 (95% CI: 0.651, 6.847), 
3.567  (95%  CI:  0.122,  7.012),  and  1.573  (95%  CI:  0.273,  2.872),  respectively.  For  the  MSQoL-54 
physical health and mental health composite scores, the LS mean differences were numerically in favour 
of ublituximab at 2.246 (95% CI: -0.162, 4.654) and 2.306 (95% CI: -0.395, 5.007), respectively. 
The LS mean differences for the total FIS score and the cognitive dimension, physical dimension, and 
social  dimension  subscale  scores  were  -3.788  (95%  CI:  -8.138,  0.562),  -0.520  (95%  CI:  -1.672, 
0.631;), -1.495 (95% CI: -2.763, -0.227), and -1.514 (95% CI: -3.782, 0.754), respectively. 
The mean number of days in the hospital due to a suspected MS relapse during the study for all subjects 
was notably lower in the ublituximab group (0.3 days) than in the teriflunomide group (1.4 days). The 
LS mean for the number of days in the hospital was 0.125 in the ublituximab group and 0.469 in the 
teriflunomide group. The ratio of ublituximab versus teriflunomide was statistically significant in favour 
of ublituximab at 0.266 (95% CI: 0.124, 0.572). 
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  any  hospitalisation  due  to  a  suspected  MS  relapse  in  the  ublituximab 
group (4.8%) was less than half that of subjects in the teriflunomide group (10.6%), corresponding to 
an odds ratio of 0.386 (95% CI: 0.191, 0.783) in favour of ublituximab, a reduction of 61.4% in the 
odds of hospital stay. 
Considering only IRAP-confirmed relapses treated with steroids, the LS mean for the related ARR was 
0.070 in the ublituximab group and 0.170 in the teriflunomide group, with a rate ratio of 0.408 (95% 
CI: 0.267, 0.623) in favour of ublituximab. About half as many subjects in the ublituximab group (12.9%) 
received steroids as treatment for IRAP-confirmed relapses compared with subjects in the teriflunomide 
group (24.1%), corresponding to a difference of -11.2% (95% CI: -17.6%, -4.7%). The odds ratio was 
in favour of ublituximab at 0.437 (95% CI: 0.275, 0.695) 
Over the entire study period for subjects with time-out-of-work diary data (n=162 in the ublituximab 
group  and  n=144  in  the  teriflunomide  group),  on  average,  subjects  in  the  ublituximab  group  missed 
fewer hours of work (77.48 hours) and smaller percentage of working hours (3.271%) than subjects in 
the teriflunomide group (104.94 hours and 4.403%, respectively). 
6. Total volume of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions per MRI scan over the Treatment Period 
The mean total volume of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions per MRI scan at baseline was higher in the ublituximab 
group (0.213 mL) compared to the teriflunomide group (0.162 mL). The LS mean for the change from

baseline in the cubic root transformed total volume of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions per MRI scan across all 
post-baseline  timepoints  was  -0.273  (95%  CI:  -0.298,  -0.248)  in  the  ublituximab  group  and  -0.131 
(95% CI: -0.155, -0.106) in the teriflunomide group, with a numerical difference in favour of ublituximab 
of -0.142 (95% CI: -0.166, -0.119). 
7. Volume of T2 lesions 
The mean total volume of T2 lesions at baseline was slightly higher in the ublituximab group (15.909 
mL)  than  in  the  teriflunomide  group  (14.868  mL).  Subjects  in  the  ublituximab  group  had  a  greater 
reduction from baseline in the mean total volume of T2 lesions at Weeks 24, 48, and 96 compared with 
subjects in the teriflunomide group, who had an increase from baseline in the mean total volume of T2 
lesions at Weeks 24, 48, and 96. The LS mean for the change from baseline in the cubic root transformed 
total volume of T2 lesions across all post-baseline timepoints was -0.020 (95% CI: -0.036, -0.003) in 
the ublituximab group and 0.038 (95% CI: 0.022, 0.054) in the teriflunomide group, corresponding to 
a numerical difference of -0.058 (95% CI: -0.074, -0.041;) in favour of ublituximab. 
8. Volume of hypointense T1 lesions (black holes) 
The mean total volume of hypointense T1 lesions at baseline was slightly higher in the ublituximab group 
(3.326 mL) than in the teriflunomide group (3.112 mL) Subjects in the ublituximab group had a slight 
increase from baseline in the mean total volume of hypointense T1 lesions at Weeks 24 and 48, and a 
slight  reduction  at  Week  96,  compared  with  subjects  in  the  teriflunomide  group,  who  had  a  slight 
reduction from baseline in the mean total volume of hypointense T1 lesions at Weeks 24 and 48, and an 
increase  at  Week  96.  The  LS  mean  for  the  change  from  baseline  in  the  cubic  root  transformed  total 
volume of hypointense T1 lesions across all post-baseline timepoints was 0.010 (95% CI: -0.008, 0.027) 
in the ublituximab group and 0.023 (95% CI: 0.006, 0.040) in the teriflunomide group, corresponding 
to a difference of -0.013 (95% CI: -0.031, 0.005). 
9. Proportion of participants free of disability progression at 24 weeks, 48 weeks, and 96 weeks 
The  result  of  this  tertiary  analysis  using  data  from  Studies  TG1101-RMS301  and  TG1101-RMS302  is 
presented in the section “Analysis performed across trials”. 
10. Proportion of participants with a relapse 
A greater proportion of subjects in the ublituximab group were free of IRAP-confirmed relapse compared 
to the teriflunomide group: 96.2% versus 90.8% at 24 weeks, 92.4% versus 83.6% at 48 weeks, and 
86.0% versus 74.4% at 96 weeks, respectively. 
11. Time to first confirmed relapse 
The  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  ublituximab  group  with  at  least  1  IRAP-confirmed  relapse  during 
treatment was approximately half of that in the teriflunomide group (13.3% versus 24.8%). The time to 
first IRAP-confirmed relapse for ublituximab and teriflunomide (log-rank test) was numerically in favour 
of ublituximab with a hazard ratio of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.75).

Study Initiation Date (First Participant First Visit): 25 Aug 2017 (date of informed consent). 
Study Completion Date (Last Participant Last Visit): 12 Nov 2020 
A database lock date - 23 Nov 2020. 
The  study  TG1101-RMS302  was  conducted  at  50  study  centres  in  8  countries  in  Europe  and  North 
America. 
•  Conduct of the study 
All amendments applied to both studies RMS301 and RMS 302. See study conduction of RMS301 above.  
•  Baseline data 
The  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  were  similar  for  subjects  in  the  ublituximab  and 
teriflunomide  groups.  For the  ublituximab  group,  the  median  (range)  age  was  33.0  (18  to  55)  years, 
65.4% of subjects were female, 98.9% of subjects were White, 96.3% of subjects were not Hispanic or 
Latino,  and  90.1%  of  subjects  were  from  Eastern  Europe.  For  the  teriflunomide  group,  the  median 
(range) age was 36.0 (18 to 55) years, 64.7% of subjects were female, 98.5% of subjects were White, 
96.3% of subjects were not Hispanic or Latino, and 91.9% of subjects were from Eastern Europe. 
The  MS  disease  history  was  generally  similar  in  the  2  treatment  groups:  mean  time  since  first  MS 
symptoms (ublituximab: 7.3 years, teriflunomide: 7.4 years), mean time since diagnosis (ublituximab: 
Assessment report  
EMA/173313/2023

5.0 years, teriflunomide:  5.0 years),  mean time since most recent relapse (ublituximab:  7.8 months, 
teriflunomide: 6.7 months), and 1 to 2 relapses in the 1 year prior to Screening (ublituximab: 91.2%, 
teriflunomide:  89.4%).  The  majority  of  subjects  had  a  baseline  EDSS  of  ≤3.5  (ublituximab:  80.1%, 
teriflunomide:  75.7%).  About  half  of  subjects  had  no  Gd-enhancing  lesions  at  baseline  (ublituximab: 
48.2%, teriflunomide: 49.6%). In the study, almost exclusively took part the participants with RRMS. 
There were only 4 (1.5%) and 5 (1.8%) SPMS in the ublituximab and teriflunomide arm respectively. 
The percentage of subjects with prior MS treatment was similar in the 2 treatment groups: MS therapy 
for at least 1 month (ublituximab: 48.2%, teriflunomide: 42.3%) and MS therapy in the past 5 years 
(ublituximab:  49.3%,  teriflunomide:  43.0%).  The  most  common  types  of  MS  therapy  (≥10%  in  any 
treatment  group)  were  interferon  beta-1a  (ublituximab:  17.6%,  teriflunomide:  15.8%),  glatiramer 
acetate  (ublituximab:  14.7%,  teriflunomide:  12.5%),  and 
laquinimod  (ublituximab:  10.7%, 
teriflunomide: 11.0%). Similar proportions of subjects previously received corticosteroid treatment for 
relapses  in  the  ublituximab  and  teriflunomide  groups  (93.0%  and  89.3%,  respectively),  with  a  mean 
time since last dose of corticosteroid treatment for relapse of 10.3 and 7.3 months in the ublituximab 
and teriflunomide groups, respectively. 
Most subjects received 5 infusions that were >50% complete. See Table 26 for further details.

Numbers analysed 
The ITT Population consisted of 545 participants overall, with 272 participants in the ublituximab group 
and  273  participants  in  the  teriflunomide  group.  No  participants  were  excluded  from  the  Safety 
Population.  One  participant  was  excluded  from  the  mITT  Population,  which  consisted  of  544  (99.8%) 
participants. Six participants did not have baseline or post-baseline MRI efficacy assessments and were 
thus excluded from the mITT-MRI Population. 
The PP Population included 460 (84.4%) participants with 86.8% of subjects in the ublituximab group 
and 82.1% of participants in the teriflunomide group. One participant did not have baseline and post-

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The  treatment  effect  of  ublituximab  versus  teriflunomide  was  statistically  significant  in  favour  of 
ublituximab (Table 27). Similar findings were reported for the ITT population and the PP population.

Key secondary efficacy endpoints 
1. Total Number of Gadolinium-enhancing T1 Lesions per MRI Scan by Week 96 
The  treatment  effect  of  ublituximab  versus  teriflunomide  was  statistically  significant  in  favour  of 
ublituximab  (Table  29).  Similar  findings  were  reported  for  the  ITT  population  and  for  the  PP-MRI 
population.

Sensitivity  analysis  of  the  total  number  of  Gd-enhancing  T1  lesions  per  MRI  scan  at  Week  96  using 
multiple imputation showed similar results. The LS mean for the number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions per 
MRI scan was 0.009 (95% CI: 0.005, 0.018) in the ublituximab group and 0.276 (95% CI: 0.180, 0.424) 
in the teriflunomide group. The treatment effect was statistically significant in favour of ublituximab at 
a ratio of 0.033 (95% CI: 0.018, 0.060; p<0.0001), corresponding to a reduction of 96.7%. 
2. Total Number of New and Enlarging T2 Hyperintense Lesions per MRI Scan by Week 96 
The  treatment  effect  of  ublituximab  versus  teriflunomide  was  statistically  significant  in  favour  of 
ublituximab  (Table  30).  Similar  findings  were  reported  for  the  ITT  population  and  for  the  PP-MRI 
population.

A sensitivity analysis of the total number of new and enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions per MRI scan at 
Week  96  using  multiple  imputation  showed  similar  results.  The  LS  mean  for  the  number  of  new  and 
enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions per MRI scan was 0.292 (95% CI: 0.208, 0.412) in the ublituximab 
group  and  3.041  (95%  CI:  2.256,  4.098)  in  the  teriflunomide  group.  The  treatment  effect  was 
statistically significant in favour of ublituximab at a ratio of 0.096 (95% CI: 0.070, 0.131; p<0.0001), 
corresponding to a reduction of 90.4%. 
3. The 12-week CDP endpoint 
For  the  12-week  CDP  endpoint,  the  pooled  analyses  using  data  from  Studies  TG1101-RMS301  and 
TG1101-RMS302 are presented together is a section “Analysis performed across trials”. 
4. Proportion of Subjects With NEDA From Week 24 to Week 96 
The treatment effect was numerically in favour of ublituximab (Table 31). Similar findings were reported 
for the ITT population and for the PP population.

6. Percentage Change in Brain Volume From Baseline to Week 96 
In  the  ublituximab  group,  the  mean  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  brain  volume  demonstrated 
increased  brain  atrophy  at  Weeks  24,  48,  and  96.  In  the  teriflunomide  group,  the  mean  percentage 
change from baseline in brain volume increased slightly at Week 24 and then demonstrated increased 
brain atrophy at Weeks 48 and 96. The LS mean for percentage change of the cube root transformed 
volume from baseline at Week 96 for ublituximab versus teriflunomide are shown in  
Table 33. Similar findings were reported for the ITT population and for the PP-MRI population.

Tertiary efficacy endpoints 
1. Change in MSFC Score From Baseline to Week 96 
At  baseline,  the  mean  MSFC  score  was  -0.026  for  subjects  in  the  ublituximab  group  and  0.026  for 
subjects in the teriflunomide group. Subjects in the ublituximab group consistently had a greater mean 
increase from baseline of the MSFC score than subjects in the teriflunomide group from Week 12 through 
Week 96. The LS mean for the change from baseline in MSFC score at Week 96 was 0.521 (95% CI: 
0.342, 0.701) in the ublituximab group and 0.275 (95% CI: 0.093, 0.456) in the teriflunomide group, 
with a numerical difference in favour of ublituximab of 0.246 (95% CI: 0.044, 0.448). 
2-4. Time to 24-weeks CDP, time to 12-weeks CDI and time to 24-weeks CDI 
For the 24-week CDP and 12- and 24-week CDI endpoints, the pooled analyses using data from Studies 
TG1101-RMS301 and TG1101-RMS302 are done. 
5. Health outcomes 
Mean baseline values were similar between the ublituximab and teriflunomide groups for all 12 subscales, 
the  2  summary  scores,  and  the  single-item  measures.  For  the  MSQoL-54  physical  health  composite 
score, the LS mean difference was numerically in favour of ublituximab at 2.891 (95% CI: 0.551, 5.232). 
For the physical health, role limitations due to physical problems, and energy subscales, the LS mean 
differences were numerically in favour of ublituximab at 3.238 (95% CI: 0.289, 6.187), 7.170 (95% CI: 
1.065, 13.276), and 3.455 (95% CI: 0.699, 6.211), respectively. For the change in health single-item 
measure, the LS mean difference was numerically in favour of ublituximab at 6.052 (95% CI: 1.994, 
10.110).  For  the  SF-36  physical  functioning,  SF-36  role  physical,  and  SF-36  vitality,  the  LS  mean 
differences were numerically in favour of ublituximab at 1.357 (95% CI: 0.120, 2.594), 2.028 (95% CI: 
0.301, 3.756), and 1.590 (95% CI: 0.263, 2.917), respectively.

The LS mean differences for the total FIS score and the cognitive dimension, physical dimension, and 
social  dimension  subscale  scores  were  -2.423  (95%  CI:  -6.733,  1.887),  -0.203  (95%  CI:  -1.344, 
0.939;), -1.131 (95% CI: -2.387, 0.126), and -1.144 (95% CI: -3.364, 1.077), respectively. 
The mean number of days in the hospital due to a suspected MS relapse during the study for all subjects 
was lower in the ublituximab group (0.9 days) than in the teriflunomide group (1.7 days). The LS mean 
for the number of days in the hospital was 0.663 in the ublituximab group and 1.417 in the teriflunomide 
group. The ratio of ublituximab versus teriflunomide was numerically in favour of ublituximab at 0.468 
(95%  CI:  0.233,  0.938).  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  any  hospitalisation  due  to  a  suspected  MS 
relapse  was  lower  in  the  ublituximab  group  (7.7%)  than  in  the  teriflunomide  group  (12.5%), 
corresponding to an odds ratio of 0.582 (95% CI: 0.327, 1.035) in favour of ublituximab. 
Considering  only  IRAP-confirmed  relapses  treated  with  steroid,  the  LS  mean  for  the  related  ARR  was 
0.059 in the ublituximab group and 0.122 in the teriflunomide group, with a rate ratio of 0.480 (95% 
CI: 0.303, 0.759) in favour of ublituximab. 
Less than half as many subjects in the ublituximab group (11.0%) received steroids as treatment for 
IRAP-confirmed relapses compared with subjects in the teriflunomide group (25.4%), corresponding to 
a  difference  of  -14.3%  (95%  CI:  -20.7%,  -8.0%).  The  odds  ratio  was  numerically  in  favour  of 
ublituximab at 0.360 (95% CI: 0.222, 0.585), 
Over the entire study period for subjects with time-out-of-work diary data (n=167 in the ublituximab 
group  and  n=151  in  the  teriflunomide  group),  on  average,  subjects  in  the  ublituximab  group  missed 
slightly  more  hours  of  work  (128.38  hours)  but  smaller  percentage  of  working  hours  (4.092%)  than 
subjects in the teriflunomide group (95.23 hours and 4.688%, respectively). 
6. Total Volume of Gadolinium-enhancing T1 Lesions per MRI Scan Over the Treatment Period 
The mean total volume of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions per MRI scan at baseline was slightly lower in the 
ublituximab  group  (0.234  mL)  and  the  teriflunomide  group  (0.257  mL).  The  LS  mean  for  the  change 
from baseline in the cubic root transformed total volume of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions per MRI scan across 
all post-baseline timepoints was -0.332 (95% CI: -0.357, -0.307) in the ublituximab group and -0.181 
(95% CI: -0.207, -0.156) in the teriflunomide group, with a numerical difference in favour of ublituximab 
of -0.151 (95% CI: -0.174, -0.128). 
7. Volume of T2 Lesions 
The mean total volume of T2 lesions at baseline was slightly lower in the ublituximab group (14.701 mL) 
than in the teriflunomide group (15.341 mL). Subjects in the ublituximab group had a reduction from 
baseline in the mean total volume of T2 lesions at Weeks 24, 48, and 96 compared with subjects in the 
teriflunomide group, who had an increase from baseline in the mean total volume of T2 lesions at Weeks 
24, 48, and 96. The LS mean for the change from baseline in the cubic root transformed total volume of 
T2 lesions across all post-baseline timepoints was -0.026 (95% CI: -0.041, -0.012) in the ublituximab 
group  and  0.037  (95%  CI:  0.022,  0.052)  in  the  teriflunomide  group,  corresponding  to  a  numerical 
difference of -0.063 (95% CI: -0.078, -0.048) in favour of ublituximab. 
8. Volume of Hypointense T1 Lesions 
The mean total volume of hypointense T1 lesions at baseline was slightly lower in the ublituximab group 
(3.235 mL) than in the teriflunomide group (3.578 mL). Subjects in the ublituximab group had a greater 
reduction from baseline in the mean total volume of hypointense T1 lesions at Weeks 24, 48, and 96, 
compared with subjects in the teriflunomide group, who had a slight decrease from baseline in the mean 
total volume of hypointense T1 lesions at Weeks 24 and 48 and a slight increase at Week 96. The LS 
mean for the change from baseline in the cubic root transformed total volume of hypointense T1 lesions 
across  all  post-baseline  timepoints  was  0.003  (95%  CI:  -0.014,  0.020)  in  the  ublituximab  group  and 
Assessment report

0.018 (95% CI: 0.000, 0.036) in the teriflunomide group, corresponding to a difference of -0.015 (95% 
CI: -0.033, 0.003). 
9. Proportion of participants free of disability progression at 24 weeks, 48 weeks, and 96 weeks 
The  result  of  this  tertiary  analysis  using  data  from  Studies  TG1101-RMS301  and  TG1101-RMS302  is 
presented in the section “Analysis performed across trials”. 
10. Proportion of Subjects With a Relapse 
A greater proportion of subjects in the ublituximab group were free of IRAP-confirmed relapse compared 
with subjects in the teriflunomide group: 92.6% versus 90.7% at 24 weeks, 90.0% versus 82.2% at 48 
weeks, and 87.4% versus 72.1% at 96 weeks, respectively. 
11. Time to First Confirmed Relapse 
The  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  ublituximab  group  with  at  least  1  IRAP-confirmed  relapse  during 
treatment was approximately half of that in the teriflunomide group (12.5% versus 26.5%). The time to 
first IRAP-confirmed relapse for ublituximab and teriflunomide (log-rank test) was numerically in favour 
of ublituximab with a hazard ratio 0.43 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.65).

1. Time to Confirmed Disability Progression for at Least 12 Weeks (secondary endpoint) 
The analyses of 12-week CDP were based on pooled data from Studies TG1101-RMS301 (ULTIMATE I) 
and TG1101-RMS302 (ULTIMATE II). The proportion of subjects free of CDP for at least 12 weeks at 24, 
48, and 96 weeks was low in the ublituximab group and similar to the teriflunomide group ( 
Table 35). The time to CDP for at least 12 weeks was not statistically significant using a stratified log-
rank test (

2. Time to Confirmed Disability Progression for at Least 24 Weeks (tertiary endpoint) 
The proportion of subjects with CDP for at least 24 weeks using the pooled data was 18 subjects (3.3%) 
in  the  ublituximab  group  and  26  subjects  (4.8%)  in  the  teriflunomide  group,  with  similar  numbers  of 
subjects free of CDP for at least 24 weeks (525 subjects [96.7%] and 520 subjects [95.2%], respectively, 
in the ublituximab and teriflunomide groups). The hazard ration for the CDP confirmed at 24 weeks using 
a stratified log-rank test was 0.657 [95% CI: 0.358, 1.205].  
3. Time to Confirmed Disability Improvement for at Least 12 Weeks and 24 Weeks (tertiary endpoints) 
The proportion of subjects who achieved CDI for at least 12 weeks using the pooled data was higher in 
the ublituximab group compared with the teriflunomide group. The difference between treatment groups 
for time to CDI for at least 12 weeks was in favour of ublituximab using a stratified log-rank test (hazard 
ratio:  2.158  [95%  CI:  1.406,  3.313]).  Similar  results  were  seen  for  the  proportion  of  subjects  who 
achieved CDI for at least 24 weeks ( 
Table 37).

a Estimated by Kaplan-Meier method.  
b Hazard ratio is estimated using Cox regression model with treatment group as covariate.  
C The stratification factors include region, baseline EDSS, and study 
A  sensitivity  analysis  of  CDI  for  at  least  12  weeks  was  performed  using  pooled  data  from  subjects  in 
Studies  TG1101-RMS301  and  TG1101-RMS302,  stratified  by  baseline  EDSS  strata  ( ≤3.5,  >3.5).  A 
durable improvement of CDI was defined as when the EDSS score at the end of study was not higher 
than the baseline EDSS score. 
Of the subjects who achieved CDI for at least 12 weeks, more subjects in the ublituximab group than in 
the teriflunomide group had durable improvement (11.4% versus 5.7%), with a difference in favour of 
ublituximab. The observation was also true in each of the baseline EDSS stratum. 
4. Subgroup analyses. 
Subgroup analyses by gender (male, female), race (White, other race), age category (<38 years, ≥38 
years), region (USA and Western Europe, Eastern Europe), baseline EDSS strata (≤3.5, >3.5), number 
of relapses experienced in the 2 years prior to study start (≤1, 2, and ≥3), received approved disease-
modifying MS drug prior to enrollment (Yes, No), and number of baseline Gd-enhancing lesions (0, ≥1) 
were performed for the primary efficacy variable (ARR [IRAP confirmed]) using the pooled data in Studies 
TG1101-RMS301 and TG1101-RMS302.  
Similar results were reported in most of the subgroup analyses of ARR, the primary efficacy endpoint 
The LS mean for the ARR was similar for subjects aged ≥38 years (0.12 versus 0.14) and higher in the 
ublituximab  group  than  in  the  teriflunomide  group  for  subjects  of  other  races  (0.22  versus  0.09); 
however, the number of subjects of other races was small (n=22) (Figure 11).

Notes: Rate ratios were based on a GEE model with logarithmic link function, treatment, region, and baseline EDSS strata as covariate 
and log (years of treatment) as offset for overall. Subgroups used the same model but excluded region and baseline EDSS strata as 
covariates. 
For subjects in the USA and Western Europe region, the number of subjects was small (n=106) for ARR 
analysis, and the LS mean for ARR was higher in the ublituximab group than in the teriflunomide group 
(0.127 versus 0.035). Of note, for the ublituximab group, the ARR of 0.127 was similar to the ARR of 
0.102  in  the  Eastern  Europe  region  and  the  ARR  of  0.084  in  the  overall  mITT  population.  For  the 
teriflunomide group, the ARR of 0.035 in USA and Western Europe was considerably lower than the ARR 
of 0.250 in Eastern Europe, the ARR of 0.20 observed in previous studies with teriflunomide (

Further,  consistent  results  were  seen  for  key  secondary  endpoints  in  both  regions.  Compared  with 
teriflunomide,  ublituximab  reduced  Gd-enhancing  T1  lesions  by  90%  in  the  USA  and  Western  Europe 
Region and 96% in the Eastern Europe Region (Table 39) and reduced new and enlarging T2 lesions by 
78% in the USA and Western Europe Region and 91% in the Eastern Europe Region (Table 40).

The applicant position is that the results for the ublituximab treatment group, including ARR, are highly 
consistent  between  the  two  regions.  The  perceived  diminished  trend  in  performance  of  ublituximab 
relative to teriflunomide therefore is a result of the over-performance of teriflunomide in the USA and 
Western Europe region likely due to large variability of small number of subjects in the region, potentially 
with rather favourable baseline characteristics. According to the applicant, the prognosis observed across 
the  important  baseline  characteristics  was  noticeably  better  for  teriflunomide-treated  subjects  in  USA 
and Western Europe than in Eastern Europe. Thus, the applicant concluded the low ARR of 0.035 in the 
teriflunomide group in USA and Western Europe is unlikely to be representative of ARR in patients treated 
with teriflunomide. 
Upon  request,  the  applicant  provided  efficacy  analysis  for  the  primary  endpoint  and  the  two  first 
secondary endpoints by disease activity in line with EMA guidelines (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev. 2). 
The analysis of baseline values for baseline disease activity indicates that the proportion of patients with 
highly active disease (having ≥2 relapses in the prior year and ≥1 Gd-enhancing lesion) is slightly lower 
in the US and Western Europe than in Eastern Europe for teriflunomide (Table 41). In the analysis of 
efficacy  by  disease  activity,  better  results  were  found  for  those  with  non-highly  active  MS  but  the 
difference is particularly prominent for participants in the teriflunomide arm (Table 42).

2.6.5.5.  Supportive studies 
Long-term  efficacy  is  being  evaluated  in  two  currently  ongoing  extension  studies,  Studies  TG1101-
RMS201E and TG1101-RMS303. No efficacy data is available at the time of the MAA.  
Study TG1101-RMS201E is an open-label, extension study for subjects who have completed the 48-
week  treatment  period  in  Study  TG1101-RMS201  and  were  in  good  health  with  stable  disease.  The 
primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and long-term efficacy outcomes of 
ublituximab treatment in subjects continuing treatment after completion of Study TG1101-RMS201. All 
subjects  receive  ublituximab  450  mg  infusion  over 1  hour  administered  every  24  weeks. The  efficacy 
endpoints are ARR and CDP. As of the cutoff date of 23 Nov 2020, 43 subjects have been enrolled and 
received at least 1 dose of ublituximab. Forty-three out of 48 (90%) subjects enrolled in Study TG1101-
RMS201 continued ublituximab treatment in the extension Study TG1101-RMS201E.  
Study TG1101-RMS303 is a 172-week, open-label, extension study for subjects who have completed 
the  96-week  double  blind  treatment  period  of  Studies  TG1101-RMS301  or  TG1101-RMS302.  The 
objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of ublituximab therapy in subjects 
with RMS. All subjects receive 150 mg of ublituximab infusion over 4 hours on Day 1 of Week 1, 450 mg 
of ublituximab infusion over 1 hour on Day 15 of Week 3, and on Weeks 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 
168 or until physician or subject decision to withdraw prior to this time. The efficacy endpoints are as 
follows: ARR, MRI parameters (T1 Gd-enhancing, T1 hypointense lesions, T2 lesions, and brain atrophy), 
CDP and CDI, NEDA, cognition (evaluated by SDMT), and function (evaluated by MSFC). As of the cutoff 
date of 23 Nov 2020, 642 subjects have been enrolled and received at least 1 dose of ublituximab, and 
39 of the 642 subjects have received >3 infusions (Week 24). As of 23 Jun 2021, 850 out of 985 (86%) 
subjects  enrolled  in  Studies  TG1101-RMS301  or  TG1101-RMS302  continued  ublituximab  treatment  or 
rolled over from the teriflunomide arm to receive ublituximab treatment in the extension Study TG1101-
RMS303. 
Ukraine  represents  a  main  Country  for  number  of  recruitment  centres  involved  in  the  ongoing  study 
RMS303.  The  applicant  has  commented  on  the  integrity  of  this  study  considering  the  unfortunate 
historical events currently affecting that area, and provided reassurance that the ongoing war in Ukraine 
has not impacted data collection for the pivotal trials while only minimally impacting on patient retention 
for long-term data collection. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Demonstration of the clinical efficacy of ublituximab was based on three studies: one phase IIa (dose 
finding) and two pivotal phase III studies.  
Study TG1101-RMS201 was a 52-week, Phase IIa, placebo-controlled, multicentre, dose-finding, cohort-
sequential study in subjects with RMS.  
The  study  included  6  treatment  cohorts,  each  with  8  subjects:  6  subjects  randomised  to  receive 
ublituximab and 2 subjects randomised receive to placebo. The primary efficacy variable was responder 
rate of B-cell depletion at Week 4, which was the proportion of subjects who had reduced B-cell depletion 
by  ≥95%  at  Week  4  in  the  ITT  population.  There  were  48  patients  overall  in  the  study,  which,  when 
subdivided into individual study subgroups, resulted in very small populations in each subgroup. There 
were several protocol violations and nearly half of them were attributed to a single investigator site (Site 
CUA)  with  10  subjects  (20%  of  all  study  participants)  were  significant  GCP  violations  and  other  non-
compliance issues occurred. No differences were shown concerning the observed results in a sensitivity 
analysis  without  the  subgroup  mentioned  above.  Other  major  deviations  were  missed  laboratory

assessments  but  they  were  not  directly  related  to  ublituximab  measures.  The  major  deviations  with 
informed consent were associated with re-consent timing after protocol amendments. 
According to the applicant, the optimal dose and infusion time of ublituximab were determined as follows: 
Day  1  (first  infusion):  150mg  infused  over  4  hours,  Day  15  (second  infusion):  450mg  infused  over  1 
hour,  Week  24  (third  infusion)  and  subsequent  infusions:  450  mg  infused  over  1  hour.  During  the 
procedure,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  further  justify  it  because  the  proposed  dose  regimen 
(4h/1h/1h)  was  not  tested  as  such  in  the  phase  II  study.  The  applicant  explained  that  the  proposed 
posology  is  based  on  the  drug  regimen  used  in  the  Phase  III  Studies  TG1101-RMS301  and  TG1101-
RMS302. This regimen most closely aligns to Cohort 2 in the Phase II Study RMS201 with the exception 
of the infusion time for the second ublituximab dose (Day 15). The infusion time of 1 hour was evaluated 
in subsequent cohorts and ultimately selected as the Phase III  dose. The explanation was considered 
sufficient. 
During the procedure, the applicant was requested to provide a rationale for the use of B-lymphocyte 
reduction criteria of more than 95% as a PD therapeutic target for optimal clinical effect. In most cases, 
the administration of ublituximab successfully achieved an almost complete reduction in B-lymphocyte 
levels.  However,  using  only  a  relative  parameter  is  not  fully  justified,  as  an  absolute  reduction  in  B-
lymphocyte levels appears to be more important for suppression. Pooled data from RMS301 & RMS302 
show participants enrolled across all arms (N = 1089) had a median (IQR) B-cell count of 195 (147 – 
269) at baseline. Therefore, 95% depletion from these baseline values corresponds to a median (IQR) 
of  10  (7  –  13)  cells/µL  in  terms  of  absolute  B-cell  count.  The  applicant  claimed  that  this  reduction  is 
within the range of B-cell depletion of other anti-CD20. However, while the lower threshold is within this 
range, the median reduction is slightly higher. However, given the efficacy of ublituximab confirmed in 
pivotal studies, the magnitude of B-lymphocyte reduction is sufficient. 
Participants who were in good health with stable disease were allowed to enter the extended open-label 
phase of the study (Study TG1101-RMS201E) at the end of the study. The 'stability' criteria themselves 
were subjectively assessed by the investigators, which is questionable. However, there were no cases of 
unstable disease in patients participating in the RMS201 trial, and almost all participants (45/48) took 
part in the extended phase of the trial.  
Studies  TG1101-RMS301  and  TG1101-RMS302  were  120-week,  Phase  III,  randomised,  multicentre, 
double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled studies with identical study designs.  
Subjects enrolled in each pivotal study were 18 to 55 years of age (inclusive) and with at least 1 relapse 
in the previous year, at least 2 relapses in the previous 2 years, or had the presence of a T1 Gad-lesion 
in the previous year. Subjects were also required to have an EDSS score from 0 to 5.5 at baseline. Both 
studies were conducted in the USA and Europe. The vast majority of patients (RMS301 - 89.5%, RMS302 
– 91.0%) were recruited in study centres located in Eastern Europe (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia).  
Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the following treatment arms: ublituximab/oral placebo 
or  teriflunomide/IV  placebo.  The  choice  of  teriflunomide  as  active  comparator  is  appropriate.  The 
randomisation  processes  in  both  studies  were  not  stratified.    While  it  can  be  agreed  that  for  studies 
involving a large group of patients, performing stratification is not absolutely necessary, stratification in 
pivotal studies of DMT for MS is often used in particular with regard to the region or baseline disability 
in order to avoid imbalance in factors that may be important determinants of treatment effectiveness. 
In fact, lack of stratification, resulted in a certain degree of imbalance in baseline characteristics between 
the  two  treatment  groups,  especially  in  USA  and  Western  Europe  with  a  small  subset  of  population 
(around 10%). Given that results for different regions may differ significantly from each other due to 
many factors, this may have been justified. However, relevant variables indicating disease characteristics 
at baseline, such as EDSS score and T1/T2 lesions count, were included as covariates in the statistical 
analysis models.

The centralised assignment of clinical endpoints, together with a separate role for the local treating and 
examining neurologists implemented early in both studies (version 2.0 and 2.1 both dated before first 
study  recruitment),  constitute  appropriate  strategy  for  mitigation  of  accidental  treatment  unblinding 
associated to the different mechanism of action of ublituximab and teriflunomide and consequent distinct 
effect on clinical and laboratory parameters. Further, a central MRI reading has been performed in both 
trials,  reassuring  not  only  the  consistent  imaging  analysis  across  centres  but  also  the  unblinded 
estimation of the MRI-based endpoints. 
The  sample  size  assumptions  based  on  clinical  trial  results  for  ocrelizumab  and  teriflunomide  were 
considered reasonable. The studies allowed for interim sample size reassessment when 210 of the 220 
participants  have  been  randomised.  The  BART  estimated  the  ARR  in  each  group  based  on  the  pooled 
population ARR and recommended adding 30 participants per group. As the reassessment of the sample 
size seems to be based on the pooled population ARR, done by an independent committee, and almost 
at the end of the studies, the integrity of the studies is not considered questioned. 
These studies were primarily designed to assess the efficacy and safety/tolerability of ublituximab/oral 
placebo compared to teriflunomide/IV placebo in subjects with RMS. The primary endpoint (ARR) and 
secondary  endpoints  including  measurements  of  MRI  inflammatory  activity  and  disability  progression 
were acceptable.  
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint was performed using a negative binomial model instead of 
the standard poisson model to avoid overdispersion (i.e. when variance is higher than mean value).This 
is acceptable. The applicant included sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint to explore efficacy for 
all relapses regardless of confirmation, IRAP-confirmed relapses during follow-up and multiple imputation 
of  withdrawn  participants.  This  is  acceptable.  Type  I  error  was  controlled  in  this  study  by  using  a 
hierarchical gate-keeping procedure. Once primary endpoint was statistically significant at alpha=0.05, 
the secondary endpoints were tested in a pre-specified order. This is acceptable.  
While  there  were  7  protocol  amendments,  only  three  protocol  versions  (3.0,  3.1,  and  3.2)  were 
implemented during active enrolment and the applicant position that the amendments for these protocol 
versions did not change any inclusion or exclusion criteria and did not impact the study population can 
be agreed. 
With protocol amendment 3.2 (dated 09 February 2018), that specifically applied to Ukraine recruitment 
sites (10 sites), a change in both studies was introduced as regards the comparator to specify that an 
unlicensed  bioequivalent  teriflunomide  product  was  used  in  place  of  the  marketed  reference  medical 
product. The applicant confirmed that there was only one form of the active comparator used throughout 
both studies for all sites and participants. The active comparator was an unlicensed teriflunomide product 
bioequivalent to Aubagio that was under an active IMPD during the conduct of the studies and which, 
after the conduct of the pivotal trials,  received FDA approval through an ANDA. 
A significant number of major protocol deviations was observed in the studies. The most frequent major 
deviation  was  “study  procedure  or  assessment”.  The  applicant  clarified  that  protocol  deviations  were 
anticipated in trials of this size, complexity, and duration, and there is no single root cause driving the 
major protocol deviations recorded in TG1101-RMS301 and TG1101-RMS302. Common causes of study 
procedure  and  assessment  deviations  were  due  to  scheduling  conflicts,  staff  availability  or  turnover, 
changes  in  protocol  procedures,  and  subject  compliance  with  protocol  requirements.  A  significant 
proportion of study procedure and assessment deviations were related to compliance with the pregnancy 
test  procedure  requirement.  Further,  the  TG1101-RMS301  and  TG1101-RMS302  studies  recorded  a 
significant  number  of  deviations  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  These  deviations  primarily  reflect  a 
site’s inability to complete study visits within the protocol-defined window or complete individual study 
assessments  as  required,  generally  due  to  local  travel  restrictions  or  quarantine  periods  for  staff,

participants, or even participant family members. The explanations of the reasons for the major protocol 
deviations in the pivotal studies seem sufficient. 
Upon request, the applicant provided a breakdown of the reasons for discontinued participation in Study 
TG1101-RMS301 [ublituximab (6.2%) in comparison to teriflunomide group (0.4%)], with a distinction 
made regarding the causes. Of note was the higher rate of discontinuation of study participation in the 
arm taking ublituximab, but both frequency and reasons varied. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study TG1101-RMS201 was a 52-week, Phase IIa, placebo-controlled, multicentre, dose-finding, cohort-
sequential study in subjects with RMS.  
In  the  RMS201  study,  ublituximab  (irrespective  on  the  dose)  led  to  rapid  peripheral  CD19+  B-cell 
depletion.  The  primary  endpoint  was  met  with  an overall  95.8%  responder  rate  of  B-cell  depletion  at 
Week 4. There was >95% median depletion in all treated subjects within 24 hours of receiving the initial 
dose of 150 mg ublituximab and ≥98% median depletion in all treated subjects by Week 4. Moreover, 
B-cell depletion within the 95% target range was largely maintained before ublituximab dosing at Week 
24 and was sustained at Week 48. In most cases, the administration of ublituximab successfully achieved 
an almost complete reduction in B-lymphocyte levels. On brain imaging parameters, most ublituximab-
treated subjects showed no evidence of clinical or MRI disease activity during the 48-week treatment 
period (85.4% and 83.3%, respectively). The ARR was reduced by 93.76% from baseline, and 91.7% of 
subjects remained relapse-free on-study. Moreover, 93.8% of subjects had no 24-week CDP, including 
16.7% of subjects who showed CDI for at least 24 weeks.  
In the study, all schemes tested led to profound B-lymph depletion, and no significant differences were 
shown between them. All tested clinical efficacy parameters were not analysed in separate subgroups 
but in the whole population. 
Studies  TG1101-RMS301  and  TG1101-RMS302  were  120-week,  Phase  III,  randomised,  multicentre, 
double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled studies with identical study designs.  
The  primary  endpoint  was  met  in  both  pivotal  studies.  A  statistically  significant  reduction  in  ARR  for 
ublituximab  compared  to  teriflunomide  was  demonstrated.  Ublituximab,  compared  to  teriflunomide, 
significantly  reduced  ARR  by  59.4%  (rate  ratio:  0.406  [95%  CI:  0.268,  0.615];  p<0.0001)  in  Study 
TG1101-RMS301 and by 49.1% (rate ratio: 0.509 [95% CI: 0.330, 0.784]; p=0.0022) in Study TG1101-
RMS302. The primary efficacy results of ARR in the two studies were consistent. Pre-sensitivity analyses 
provided consistent results. The applicant analysed the Independent Relapse Adjudication Panel (IRAP)-
confirmed  relapses  in  studies  RMS301  and  RMS302  for  severity  and  recovery.  The  majority  of  the 
relapses  were  mild  or  moderate  and  results  appear  to  be  comparable  from  the  point  of  view  of  the 
severity of relapses. Among subjects who had a relapse, the partial recovery was to some extant higher 
in the ublituximab group (33% vs. 26%). According to the definition, the partial recovery EDSS remains 
elevated vs. pre-relapse levels at all time-points within 24 weeks (+1-week window) of symptom onset. 
The applicant presented the results of the partial recovery in relation to the EDSS change and it can be 
concluded that the risk of partial recovery is similar in both treatment arms. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were tested in a hierarchical manner. A statistically significant difference 
between ublituximab and teriflunomide was reported for the secondary efficacy endpoint of total number 
of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions per MRI scan at Week 96 and the secondary efficacy endpoint of total number 
of new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions per MRI scan at Week 96. The proportion of subjects with 
CDP for at least 12 weeks was slightly lower for ublituximab compared to teriflunomide but did not reach 
the level of statistical significance. The effect on the disability progression (CDP) was not demonstrated, 
probably due to the low incidence of the CDP (about 5%) in both study arms. Therefore, results from 
subsequent secondary outcomes (proportion of subjects with NEDA from Week 24 to Week 96, proportion 
Assessment report  
EMA/173313/2023  
Page 109/129 
 
 
 
of subjects reaching impaired SDMT from baseline to Week 96 and percentage change in brain volume 
from baseline to Week 96) should be treated as an exploratory only. Overall, the secondary and tertiary 
endpoints generally supported the results of the analysis performed for primary endpoint. 
In  the  clinical  studies  with  ublituximab  there  was  very  limited  number  of  patients  with  SPMS  with 
superimposed relapses. In line with EMA guideline (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev. 2), it is reasonable 
to  assume  that  relapses  in  RRMS  and SPMS  have  the  same  underlying  inflammatory  pathophysiology 
and therefore efficacy on relapses in RRMS patients may be extrapolated to efficacy on relapses in SPMS. 
Therefore, it is considered acceptable to extrapolate the study results on disease activity to the whole 
RMS population.  
Upon, the applicant clarified how many patients were DMT treatment naïve in both studies. While the 
proportion  of  treatment-naive  patients  was  very  well  balanced  in  Study  TG1101-RMS301  (59.1  vs 
59.8%), the proportion of patients who received DMT was higher in the teriflunomide group (57.0% vs 
50.7%) in Study TG1101-RMS302. However, the primary endpoint analysis (ARR) shows that the effect 
of ublituximab was similar in both studies (0.076 - TG1101-RMS301 and 0.091 - TG1101-RMS302), and 
therefore it can be agreed the applicant position that differences in the proportion of treatment-naive 
patients did not translate into differences in effect size. 
Subgroup analysis of ARR yielded similar results for most of the subgroups, however, the limited number 
of relapses observed across both studies precluded interpretability, particularly for smaller subgroups.  
The concern on study result generalizability due to the poor representativeness of the Western Countries 
(9.7% of the total population), is further reinforced by results by region, showing the opposite behaviour 
of the ARR in response to treatment relative to the comparator between USA/Western Europe and East 
Europe. In the analysis of ARR performed for the pooled data from both pivotal studies, the number of 
relapses in the ublituximab group was similar in both regions. It may be agreed that the results for the 
ublituximab treatment group, including ARR, are highly consistent between the two regions. Conversely, 
the  ARR  result  for  the  teriflunomide  treatment  group  in  the  USA  and  Western  Europe  Region 
(ARR=0.035) is low and an outlier based on previous teriflunomide studies [(ASCLEPIOS studies the ARR 
for teriflunomide was 0.22 and 0.25 respectively] as well as the ARR that was observed in the larger 
Eastern  Europe  subgroup  of  studies  TG1101-RMS301  and  TG1101-RMS302.    Although  acknowledging 
the limited numerosity of the Western patients, the trend is clearly differentiated from their counterpart 
in  Eastern  Europe.  The  applicant’s  justification  relies  on  the  different  performance  of  the  control  arm 
observed in the two geographical areas, with a higher efficacy of teriflunomide in USA/Western Europe 
than in Eastern Europe. The claimed more favourable conditions, within Western countries, of patients 
assigned  to  teriflunomide  in  comparison  to  the  ublituximab  group,  is  regarded  as  the  underlying 
explanation.  Contrarily  to  the  applicant’s  position,  it  should  be  noted  that  more  favourable  baseline 
disease characteristics in USA/Western Europe compared to their co-respective in Eastern Europe were 
observable in both treatment arms, not just the teriflunomide group. Part of the problem with the results 
obtained was that the applicant did not apply stratification by region This limitation was acknoledged by 
the applicant who stated that the chance of baseline imbalances is higher between each region subgroup 
since the study randomisation was not stratified by region, which could be more impactful on smaller 
subgroup such as the USA and Western Europe subgroup. In this regard, the applicant recognised that 
the  sample  size  and  number  of  relapses  in  the  USA  and  Western  Europe  Region  were  rather  small, 
accounting for less than 10% of the overall population, and only 3.5% of the study relapses across the 
two  studies.  Small  sample  sizes  are  subject  to  greater  chance  of  random  findings  and  more  prone  to 
cofounding by baseline imbalances with known or unknown factors.  
However, analysis of baseline values for baseline disease activity indicates that the proportion of patients 
with  highly  active  disease  is  slightly  lower  in  the  US  and  Western  Europe  than  in  Eastern  Europe  for 
teriflunomide (9.4% vs 15.2%). This was further confirmed in the analysis of differences in the efficacy 
Assessment report

Page 110/129 
 
 
 
of teriflunomide in participants with active vs highly active disease (better results for patients who are 
not highly active disease). 
In the analysis of the number of enhancing Gd+ foci, it is worth noting that a higher number of lesions 
per scan was observed in patients treated with teriflunomide. This effect remains in discordance with the 
frequency of relapses. The analysis indicates that for patients in the US and Western European region 
using ublituximab, a higher incidence of relapses (ARR) is simultaneously associated with a lower number 
of enhancing foci compared to teriflunomide. Even considering the low number of patients, this lack of 
correlation of ARR with the number of foci is puzzling. The applicant informed that such an observation 
had  been  documented  in  the  literature  as  the  clinicoradiological  paradox  (Chard  &  Trip  2017).  The 
phenomenon  probably  arises  due  to  the  high  sensitivity  of  MRI  assessments  in  capturing  changes  in 
lesions, which contrasts with the less sensitive and more subjective EDSS scoring system. It should be 
noted, however, that the clinicoradiological paradox mainly refers to the discrepancy between MRI and 
disability  score,  this  latter  mainly  related  to  phenomena  of  biological  redundancy  and  neuroplasticity 
rather than either Gd-enhancing T1 or new Enlarging T2 Hyperintense lesions. It remains unclear the 
herein  reported  observation  of  dissociation  between  relapses  and  MRI  foci,  given  their  underlying 
common pathological features. In any case, the issue specifically concerns the control arm, and therefore 
it can be considered a marginal aspect of concern. 
In addition to the already mentioned inconsistency in results by region, lack of superiority of ublituximab 
over  teriflunomide  was  detected  also  for  race  and  age.  For  the  primary  endpoint  (ARR),  the  limited 
sample  size  in  the  “Other  Race”  subgroup  does  not  allow  for  definitive  conclusions  to  be  drawn.  The 
benefit on ARR appeared stronger in younger age  (-69%)  group than older age group (-16%), which 
was mainly driven by different ARR estimates in the teriflunomide arm (higher in younger age). Similar 
trends for both age groups were observed for T1/T2-lesions. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the product can be considered approvable for a clinical efficacy perspective. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The primary safety evaluation for ublituximab compared to teriflunomide is based on pooled safety data 
from the 2 pivotal studies. A supplementary safety evaluation for ublituximab in RMS is based on pooled 
analyses  of  the  2 pivotal  studies  concatenated  with  data  from  Study TG1101-RMS303  for  the  same 
subjects.  An  additional  supplementary  safety  evaluation  is  based  on  safety  data  from  Study TG1101-
RMS201 concatenated with data from Study TG1101 RMS201E for the same subjects.  
Ublituximab is being studied in a variety of patient populations, both as a single agent and in combination 
with other agents. To date, over 2,500 subjects have been exposed to ublituximab across all indications, 
including approximately 600 subjects with RMS. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
In total 545 patients with RMS have been exposed to ublituximab in two completed pivotal studies for 
72 weeks. As per cutoff date of 01 March 2022, the total number of participants exposed to ublituximab 
in phase III trials was 974 participants reflecting the newly rolled over participants from the teriflunomide 
arm  of  the  parent  studies  now  being  treated  with  ublituximab.    In  addition,  48  subjects  have  been 
exposed in a completed Phase 2 study for 24 weeks

In  the  pooled  analysis  of  the  pivotal  Phase  3  studies,  the  median  number  of  infusions  was  5.  In 
ublituximab  group  92,7%  of  subjects  (505  patients)  received  5  infusions.  Out  of  545  participants  in 
TG1101-RMS301 and TG1101-RMS302, 494 completed the 96-week treatment period. The main reasons 
for discontinuation in these patients were withdrawal of consent and AE. Of these 494 participants, 481 
(97%) completed the 20-week follow-up period or enrolled in the RMS301 extension study. Only 13 of 
494  (2.6%)  participants  discontinued  from  the  study  following  completion  of  the  96-week  treatment 
period.  Reasons  for  discontinuation  included  9  participants  declining  participation  in  RMS303  and  4 
participants with COVID-19 logistical restrictions or other reasons. As per 01 Mar 2022, 422 participants 
out  of  the  545  (77.4%  %)  included  in  the  pivotal  trials  had  enrolled  in  RMS303  Following  rollover  to 
Study TG1101-RMS303, 52 subject (9.5%) discontinued mainly due to AEs or withdrawal of consent. 
In  concatenated  Phase  2  Studies,  a  total  of  45  subjects  (93.8%)  completed  the  48-week  treatment 
period in Study TG1101 RMS201 and enrolled in the extension study, Study TG1101 RMS201E. As of the 
data cutoff date of 01 March 2022, 28 subjects (58.3%) were still on treatment and 20 subjects (41.7%) 
prematurely  discontinued  study  treatment.  The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  of  study 
treatment was withdrawal by subject together with death and switched to a different disease-modifying 
therapy. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
As per 20 November 2020, in the pooled analysis of the pivotal Phase III studies, the incidence of at 
least 1 TEAE was similar in subjects in the ublituximab and teriflunomide groups (89.2% and 91.4%, 
respectively). More subjects in the ublituximab group than subjects in the teriflunomide group reported 
TEAEs of Grade ≥3 (21.3% versus 14.1%), TEAEs of Grade 4 (2.2% versus 0.7%) , serious TEAEs were 
reported in 10.8% of subjects in the ublituximab group and 7.3% of subjects in the teriflunomide group, 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were reported in 4.2% of subjects in the ublituximab 
group  and  0.7%  of  subjects  in  the  teriflunomide  group  and  TEAEs  leading  to  death  were  reported  in 
0.6% of subjects in the ublituximab group and none of the subjects in the teriflunomide group.  
As per 20 November 2020, in the concatenated Phase III studies, these percentages were similar to the 
percentages reported in the parent studies: any TEAE: 89.7% versus 89.2%, TEAEs of Grade ≥3: 23.5% 
[12  additional  subjects  reporting  TEAEs  of  Grade  ≥3  in  the  extension  study]  versus  21.3%,  serious 
TEAEs: 11.9% versus 10.8%, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment: 4.8% versus 4.2%, 
and treatment-emergent AESIs: 65.0% versus 63.9%.  
As  per  20  November  2020,  in  the  pooled  analysis  of  the  pivotal  Phase  III  studies,  the  most  common 
TEAEs  (≥10%  of  subjects  in  any  group)  were  headache  (ublituximab:  34.3%;  teriflunomide:  26.6%), 
nasopharyngitis  (ublituximab:  18.3%; 
teriflunomide:  17.9%),  pyrexia  (ublituximab:  13.9%; 
teriflunomide:  4.9%),  nausea  (ublituximab:  10.6%;  teriflunomide:  7.8%),  diarrhoea  (ublituximab: 
8.1%; teriflunomide: 10.6%), and alopecia (ublituximab: 3.5%; teriflunomide: 15.3%). The percentage 
of subjects with TEAEs related to study treatment was higher in the ublituximab group compared to the 
teriflunomide group (66.4% versus 50.0%). The most common TEAEs related to study treatment (≥10% 
of  subjects  in  any  group)  were  headache  (ublituximab:  11.2%;  teriflunomide:  5.5%),  pyrexia 
(ublituximab: 10.5%; teriflunomide: 1.8%), and alopecia (ublituximab: 2.9%; teriflunomide: 14.8%). 
The  most  common  TEAEs  of  Grade  ≥3  were  lymphocyte  count  decreased  (ublituximab:  5.5%; 
teriflunomide: 0) and lymphopenia (ublituximab: 4.0%; teriflunomide: 0.5%), which was attributable to 
the intended mechanism of action of ublituximab. All other TEAEs of Grade ≥3 were reported in ≤2% of 
subjects in either treatment group. Two TEAEs of Grade 4 (anaphylactic reaction and CNS enteroviral 
infection) were considered serious and led to discontinuation of ublituximab treatment.

As per 20 November 2020, in the concatenated Phase III studies, treatment-related TEAEs were reported 
in  4  additional  subjects  (67.2%  of  subjects  versus  66.4%  of  subjects  in  the  parent  studies).  No  new 
TEAEs  related  to  study  treatment  were  reported  in  ≥10%  of  subjects.  An  additional  Grade  4  TEAE  of 
neutropenia was reported in 1 subject. 
At 01 March 2022, out of the 974 participants included in the Ublituximab Update Safety set of phase III 
trials, 809 (83.1%) had at least 1 TEAE, 272 had at least 1 TEAEs of Grade ≥3, 167 (17.1%) had at least 
1 serious TEAEs, 55 (5.6%) had at least 1 TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation and 22 had any 
TEAE  with  an  outcome  of  death.  The  risk  of  infusion-related  reactions  is  considered  an  important 
identified risk and the risk of serious infections remains an important potential risk for ublituximab in 
RMS. No new safety concerns or risks were identified from this safety update.  
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
As per 20 November 2020, in the pooled analysis of the pivotal Phase III studies, serious TEAEs were 
reported in 59 subjects (10.8%) in the ublituximab group and 40 subjects (7.3%) in the teriflunomide 
group. No serious TEAEs (by PT) were reported in ≥1% of subjects in either treatment group. Serious 
TEAEs  reported  in  3  or  more  subjects  included  events  of  coronavirus  infection  2019  (COVID-19) 
pneumonia,  pneumonia,  and  acute  sinusitis  in  the  ublituximab  group  and  neurological  symptom  and 
pyelonephritis acute in the teriflunomide group. 
As  per  20  November  2020,  in  the  concatenated  Phase  III  studies,  serious  TEAEs  were  reported  in  6 
additional subjects (11.9% versus 10.8% in the parent studies). These included COVID-19 pneumonia 
in  4  subjects;  tibia  fracture  and  fibula  fracture  in  1  subject;  and  uterine  leiomyoma  and  vaginal 
haemorrhage in 1 subject. In addition, 2 subjects with serious TEAEs (complicated appendicitis and deep 
vein thrombosis) in the parent study had new serious TEAEs (salpingitis/peritonitis/salpingo oophoritis 
and COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively) in the extension study, Study TG1101-RMS303. 
At 01 March 2022, out of the 974 participants included in the Ublituximab Update Safety set of phase III 
trials, 167 (17.1%) had at least 1 serious TEAEs. The increased incidence of serious TEAEs was driven 
by COVID-19 pneumonia (80 participants). The applicant provided detailed analysis of COVID-19 impact 
on  patients  safety.  Overall,  no  definitive  trend  in  baseline  characteristics  or  disease  history  for 
participants  who  had  any  COVID-19-related  adverse  events  was  observed.  However,  age  and  obesity 
were confirmed as a risk factors for fatal COVID-19-related adverse events.  
As  per  20  November  2020,  in  the  concatenated  Phase  II  studies,  serious  TEAEs  were  reported  in  11 
subjects  (22.9%).  For  2  subjects,  the  serious  TEAE  was  considered  possibly  related  to  ublituximab 
(cellulitis and colitis). One pregnancy case led to permanent discontinuation of ublituximab. At 01 March 
2022, out of the 48 participants included in the Ublituximab Update Safety set of phase III trials, serious 
TEAEs were reported in 17 subjects with six additional participants who had new serious case of COVID-
19 or COVID-19 pneumonia 
Infusion-related reaction (IRR) 
Investigator-reported IRRs 
As  per  20  November  2020,  in  the  pooled  analysis  of  the  pivotal  Phase  III  studies,  the  percentage  of 
subjects  with  Investigator-reported  IRRs  was  higher  in  the  ublituximab  group  as  expected  with  the 
infusion  of  an  anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibody  compared  to  the  teriflunomide  group  (47.7%  versus 
12.2%).  The  most  common  Investigator-reported  IRRs  by  PT  (≥5%  of  subjects  in  any  group)  were 
pyrexia  (ublituximab:  9.5%;  teriflunomide:  0.7%),  chills  (ublituximab:  7.9%;  teriflunomide:  0.5%), 
headache  (ublituximab:  7.5%;  teriflunomide:  2.2%),  influenza-like  illness  (ublituximab:  5.9%; 
teriflunomide: 0.9%), and IRR (ublituximab: 5.0%; teriflunomide: 0.5%). Investigator-reported IRRs of 
Assessment report  
EMA/173313/2023

Grade  ≥3  occurred  in  15  subjects  (2.8%)  in  the  ublituximab  group  and  1  subject  (0.2%)  in  the 
teriflunomide group. Lymphocyte count decreased (1.7%) was the most common Investigator-reported 
IRR of Grade ≥3 in the ublituximab group. The majority of the Investigator-reported IRRs started within 
24 hours of infusion.  
As per 20 November 2020, in the concatenated Phase III studies, 5 additional subjects had Investigator-
reported IRRs (48.6% versus 47.7% in the parent studies). Investigator-reported IRRs started within 24 
hours of infusion in 264 of 265 subjects (99.6%). 
IRR based on the AESI category 
As  per  20  November  2020,  for  ublituximab-treated  subjects,  the  incidence  of  IRR  based  on  the  AESI 
category  was  48.3%  and  did  not  differ  meaningfully  from  the  incidence  of  Investigator  reported  IRR 
(47.7%). The most commonly reported TEAE signs and symptoms associated with IRR AESI category 
(≥5%  of  ublituximab-treated  subjects)  were  headache  (10.3%),  pyrexia  (9.7%),  chills  (8.1%),  and 
influenza-like illness (6.2%). The corresponding Investigator-reported rates were pyrexia (9.5%), chills 
(7.9%), headache (7.5%), and influenza-like illness (5.9%). 
As per 20 November 2020, in the concatenated Phase III studies, the percentage of subjects with IRRs 
as AESIs was similar to the parent studies (49.2% versus 48.3%). 
At 01 March 2022, out of the 974 participants included in the Ublituximab Update Safety set of phase III 
trials, 389 (39.9%) had at least one IRR with 12 IRR of Grade ≥3. The most commonly reported TEAE 
signs and symptoms were similar to the ones already reported as of cut-off of 20 November 2020.  
Cytopenias / Lymphopenia 
As per 20 November 2020, in the pooled analysis of the pivotal Phase III studies, cytopenias as AESIs 
were reported in 25.7% of subjects in the ublituximab group and were of Grade ≥3 in 12.1% of subjects. 
In the concatenated Phase III studies, the percentage of subjects with cytopenias as AESIs was similar 
to the parent studies (any grade: 26.8% versus 25.7%; Grade ≥3: 12.7% versus 12.1%). 
As  per  20  November  2020,  in  the  pooled  analysis  of  the  pivotal  Phase  III  studies,  Grade  ≥3  TEAEs 
associated  with  lymphocyte  count  included  lymphocyte  count  decreased  (ublituximab:  5.5%; 
teriflunomide: 0) and lymphopenia (ublituximab: 4.0%; teriflunomide: 0.5%). In the ublituximab group, 
1  subject  had  a  serious  TEAE  of  lymphocyte  count  decreased,  and  1  subject  had  a  Grade  3  TEAE  of 
lymphopenia that led to discontinuation of study treatment. No new Grade ≥3 TEAEs of lymphopenia or 
lymphocyte count decreased were reported in the concatenated Phase III studies. 
At 01 March 2022, out of the 974 participants included in the Ublituximab Update Safety set of phase III 
trials,  222  (22.8%)  had  at  least  one  episode  of  cytopenia  with  102  of  Grade  ≥3.    Lymphopenia  and 
Lymphocyte count decreased were reported in 70 (24 of Grade ≥3) and 56 (30 of Grade ≥3) participants, 
respectively.  
Malignancies 
As per 20 November 2020, in the pooled analysis of the pivotal Phase III studies, malignancies as AESIs 
were reported in 2 subjects (0.4%) in the ublituximab group and 1 subject (0.2%) in the teriflunomide 
group.  The  TEAEs  of  endometrial  stromal  sarcoma  and  uterine  cancer  in  the  ublituximab  group  were 
considered SAEs. Neither of the events led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment. 
As per 20 November 2020, in the concatenated Phase III studies, an additional TEAE of oophorectomy 
(Grade 2 and not serious) in the malignancies AESI category was reported in the extension study in the 
same subject who had a TEAE of endometrial stromal sarcoma in the parent study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/173313/2023  
Page 114/129 
 
 
 
As per 20 November 2020, the overall incidence (95% CI) of malignancies in the ublituximab group was 
0.4 (0.04, 1.32) with an incidence rate of 0.24 per subject-year. 
At 01 March 2022, out of the 974 participants included in the Ublituximab Update Safety set of phase III 
trials, malignancies as AESIs were reported in 5 subjects (0.5%) including the three mentioned cases 
and two additional cases of pseudomyxoma peritonei and splenectomy.  
Serious infections 
As per 20 November 2020, in the pooled analysis of the pivotal Phase III studies, serious infections as 
AESIs  were  reported  in  5.0%  of  subjects  in  the  ublituximab  group  and  2.9%  of  subjects  in  the 
teriflunomide group. The most common TEAEs (≥0.5% of subjects in any group) in the serious infections 
AESI  category  were  pneumonia  (ublituximab:  0.9%;  teriflunomide:  0.4%),  COVID-19  pneumonia 
(ublituximab: 0.7%; teriflunomide: 0.4%), and acute sinusitis (ublituximab: 0.6%; teriflunomide: 0). 
At 01 March 2022, out of the 974 participants included in the Ublituximab Update Safety set of phase III 
trials,  serious  infections  were  reported  in  130  of  which  117  were  of  Grade  ≥3.  The  most  commonly 
reported infection was COVID-19 pneumonia. 
Treatment-emergent Opportunistic Infections 
As  per  20  November  2020,  in  the  pooled  analysis  of  the  pivotal  Phase  III  studies,  the  incidence  of 
potential  treatment  emergent  opportunistic  infections  was  similar  in  subjects  in  the  ublituximab  and 
teriflunomide groups (11.9% and 10.4%, respectively). The most common TEAEs (≥2% of subjects in 
any  group)  were  oral  herpes  (ublituximab:  3.1%;  teriflunomide:  3.3%)  and  influenza  (ublituximab: 
2.6%;  teriflunomide:  2.7%).  The  treatment-emergent  opportunistic  infections  of  Grade  ≥3  were 
reported in 2 subjects in the ublituximab group (chronic hepatitis B and meningoencephalitis viral) and 
1 subject in the teriflunomide group (septic shock). 
As  per  20  November  2020,  in  the  concatenated  Phase  III  studies,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with 
treatment-emergent opportunistic infections (any grade) was similar to the parent studies (12.8% versus 
11.9% in the parent studies). 
At 01 March 2022, out of the 974 participants included in the Ublituximab Update Safety set of phase III 
trials, treatment emergent opportunistic infections were reported in 8.9% of participants.  
Deaths 
As per 20 November 2020, in the pooled analysis of the pivotal Phase III studies, TEAEs with an outcome 
of  death  were  reported  in  3  subjects  (0.6%)  in  the  ublituximab  group  (encephalitis,  pneumonia,  and 
salpingitis).  There were no TEAEs with an outcome of death in the teriflunomide group. The event of 
pneumonia was considered possibly related to ublituximab. The other two events were considered not 
related to ublituximab. 
At 01 March 2022, out of the 974 participants included in the Ublituximab Safety Update set of phase III 
trials, 22 TEAE with an outcome of death were reported. The additional 19 cases of death were due to 
COVID-19 related events. 
As per 20 November 2020, no deaths were reported in Studies TG1101-RMS201 or TG1101-RMS201E. 
At 01 March 2022, out of the 48 participants included in the Ublituximab Update Safety set of phase II 
trials, three deaths were reported due to COVID-19-related events.

2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
As per 20 November 2020, the most notable laboratory abnormalities were low lymphocyte count (91% 
of  patients  treated  with  ublituximab  at  Week  1),  which  is  expected  given  the  intended  mechanism  of 
action  of  ublituximab.  Of  note,  at  Week  2  only  7.8%  of  ublituximab  treated  patients  reported  low 
lymphocyte  count.  In  the  pivotal  studies,  the  overall  incidence  of  the  liver  function  abnormalities  in 
patients treated with ublituximab was low (0.6% experienced ALT ≥10xULN and 0.4% experienced AST 
≥10xULN). In only one subject from ublituximab group ALT value did not normalise before or after the 
end of the study. 
Other laboratory parameters did not show any consistent abnormalities or clinically relevant differences 
compared to active control group. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Patients aged 18-55 years were included in the pivotal studies, hence, the safety profile is not known for 
other age groups. The safety profile was comparable between patients ≥38 years of age and < 38 years 
of age with a higher incidence of any TEAEs in younger subjects (93.9% vs 83.6%). Moreover, higher 
incidence of any TEAEs and serious TEAEs was reported in female subjects compared to male subjects. 
However, the observed differences by gender and age are not considered clinically meaningful.  
No  conclusions  regarding  differences  by  race  can  be  made  due  to  very  limited  number  of  patients  of 
other than White race included in the pivotal studies.  
No differences in safety profile with respect to hepatic impairment at baseline was reported. However, it 
is noted that a very limited number of patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no patients with 
severe hepatic impairment at baseline were included.  
Out of the total 545 participants who received ublituximab in the Phase III studies, 220 had mild renal 
impairment (GFR ≥60 mL/min and <90 mL/min), 4 had moderate renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min) 
at baseline and no patients had severe renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min). There were no clinically 
meaningful  differences  observed  TEAEs,  SAEs,  drug  discontinuations,  AESI  and  deaths  in  participants 
receiving  ublituximab  with  mild  renal  impairment  compared  to  normal  renal  function.  No  analysis  of 
safety  profile  in  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment  was  feasible  due  to  the  fact  that  only  4 
ublituximab-treated participants had moderate renal impairment. 
Use of ublituximab during pregnancy may cause fetal harm and may cause infant B-cell depletion. There 
were 14 cases of pregnancy reported (including 3 cases of pregnancy of the subject’s partner) in the 
ublituximab  clinical  development  program.  One  case  of  spontaneous  abortion  and  3  cases  with  an 
unknown  outcome  were  reported.  The  outcome  of  5  pregnancies  were  full-time  delivery  of  a  healthy 
newborn. 
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
The immunogenicity of ublituximab in subjects with RMS was evaluated in clinical studies through the 
assessment  of  ADA  and  characterisation  of  ADA  positive  clinical  samples  for  potential  neutralizing 
activity.  The  immunogenicity  of  ublituximab  and  the  potential  impact  on  the  clinical  profile  was 
characterised in the three RMS clinical studies TG1101-RMS201, TG1101-RMS301, and TG1101-RMS302. 
The incidence of TE-ADA in Study TG1101-RMS201 was 52.5% (21/40) but only 1 was Nab positive. The 
incidence of TE-ADA in Studies TG1101-RMS301 and TG1101-RMS302 was 78.0% and 84.4% in each

study, respectively, and was 81.3% (434/534) with only 34 subjects being NAb positive. in the pooled 
data from both studies. 
The applicant presented analysis indicating that the presence of TE-ADA or NAb did not impact efficacy 
and safety of ublituximab as indicated in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal DDI studies have been performed, as no drug interactions are expected via cytochrome P450 
enzymes, other metabolising enzymes or transporters.  
The safety of immunisation with live or live-attenuated vaccines, following ublituximab therapy has not 
been studied. 
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
As per 20 November 2020, in the pooled analysis of the pivotal Phase III studies, the incidence of TEAEs 
leading  to  study  treatment  discontinuation  was  higher  in  the  ublituximab  group  compared  to  the 
teriflunomide group (4.2% versus 0.7%). The ADRs leading to discontinuation in the ublituximab group 
were  anaphylactic  reaction,  hypersensitivity,  IRR,  myalgia  and  tracheobronchitis  (1  subject  each). 
Anaphylactic reaction was the only Grade ≥3 ADR that led to discontinuation of study treatment.  In the 
concatenated Phase III studies, TEAEs led to discontinuation of study treatment in 3 additional subjects 
(COVID-19  pneumonia)  and  all  TEAEs  were  serious.  At  01  March  2022,  out  of  the  974  participants 
included in the Ublituximab Update Safety set of phase III trials, 55 (5.6%) had at least 1 TEAE leading 
to  treatment  discontinuation.  The  most  common  TEAE  leading  to  discontinuation  of  ublituximab 
treatment was COVID-19 pneumonia. 
As per 20 November 2020, one subject discontinued ublituximab treatment in Study TG1101-RMS201 
due  to  pregnancy.  At  01  March  2022,  out  of  the  48  participants  included  in  the  Ublituximab  Update 
Safety set of phase II trials, one additional participant discontinued treatment due to a TEAE of COVID-
19.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  primary  source  of  safety  data  in  the  RMS  target  population  consists  of  the  two  identical  pivotal 
randomised,  double  blind,  2-arm,  active  controlled  Phase  3  studies  TG1101-RMS302  and  TG1101-
RMS302. In total 545 subjects with RMS treated with ublituximab were included in the primary safety 
evaluation.  In  two  pivotal  studies,  90.6%  of  patients  from  ublituximab  group  completed  the  96-week 
treatment period. The main reasons for discontinuation in these patients were withdrawal of consent and 
AE. Supplementary safety data were obtained from a single arm, dose finding Phase 2 study and two 
ongoing extension studies. In total 1022 patients were exposed to ublituximab in Phase 3 and Phase 2 
studies. 974 patients are exposed to ublituximab in the extension Study TG1101-RMS303 as per cut-off 
of 01 March 2022.  
Patients up to 55 years of age were included in the pivotal III studies. 63% of subjects were female, 
98% were White. Both groups were well balanced with respect to age, sex and race. In concatenated 
Phase 2 studies patients between 20 and 56 years of age were included (the media age was 42.5 years).

The majority of participants were female (66.7%). Overview of AEs in main safety data did not indicate 
an imbalance between ublituximab and teriflunomide in incidence of at least 1 TEAEs. However, a higher 
number of patients from ublituximab group experienced TEAE of Grade ≥3 compared to teriflunomide 
treated patients. Nevertheless, the disproportion was mainly related to the higher incidence of TEAEs of 
lymphocyte  decrease  and  lymphopenia,  which  could  be  expected,  given  the  mechanism  of  action  of 
ublituximab.  
The analysis of the relationship between the duration of exposure and incidence of any TEAEs showed 
that the highest incidence of TEAEs was reported during the exposure period of 0 to <6 months.  The 
analysis  performed  did  not  show  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  serious  TEAEs  reported  during  ≥18 
months. 
The most common TEAEs reported during the pivotal Phase 3 studies were headache, nasopharyngitis, 
pyrexia, nausea, diarrhoea and alopecia. The incidence of pyrexia was substantially higher in subjects 
treated  with  ublituximab  compared  to  teriflunomide  (13.9%  vs  4.9%)  but  the  applicant  clarified  that 
75% of events resolved within 3.5 days  
The  overall  incidence  of  serious  TEAEs  in  the  pooled  pivotal  studies  was  comparable  between  both 
ublituximab and teriflunomide groups. As per 20 November 2020 cut-off, serious TEAEs reported in 3 or 
more  subjects  in  the  ublituximab  group  included  events  of  COVID-19  pneumonia,  acute  sinusitis, 
pneumonia. 7 additional serious TEAEs were reported in the concatenated Phase 3 studies (4 cases of 
COVID-19  pneumonia,  tibia  and  fibula  fracture  in  1  subject  and  uterine  leiomyoma  and  vaginal 
haemorrhage  in  1  subject).  One  additional  case  of  COVID-19  pneumonia  and  one  case  of 
salpingitis/peritonitis/salpingo-oophoritis) were reported in the extension study TG1101-RMS303.  
In  line  with  the  safety  profile  described  for  other  anti-CD20  mAbs,  the  main  safety  issues  with  of 
ublituximab are the risk of IRR and infections.  
Serious infections were reported in 5% of subjects from ublituximab group compared to 2.9% of patients 
from teriflunomide group in the pooled analysis of the pivotal studies as per 20 November 2020 cut-off 
date. The incidence of potential treatment-emergent opportunistic infections was comparable between 
both groups (11.9% in ublituximab group and 10.4% in teriflunomide group) as per 20 November 2020 
cut-off date.  
A  risk  of  cytopenia  is  a  known  TEAEs  associated  with  the  use  of  any  anti-CD20  biological  product 
depleting B-cells. As per 20 November 2020 cut-off in the pooled analysis of the pivotal Phase 3 studies, 
cytopenias  were  reported  in  25.7%  of  subjects  in  the  ublituximab  group  compared  to  9.3%  in 
teriflunomide  group.  In  12.1%  of  subjects  treated  with  ublituximab,  cytopenias  of  Grade  ≥3  were 
reported (lymphocyte count decreased – 5.5%; lymphopenia – 4%). Neutropenia was observed in 2% of 
patients treated with ublituximab in the pivotal Phase 3 studies. The applicant has provided data about 
the  timing  of  infections  and  the  timing  of  the  events  of  cytopenia  or  hypogammaglobulinaemia. 
Apparently,  it  emerges  that  most  infection  events  did  not  happen  in  proximity  of  reduced  values  of 
neutrophils, lymphocytes or immunoglobulins.  
The applicant provided detailed analysis of cases of serous and fatal infections, CNS infections, COVID-
19 infections and malignancies. Generally, patients reporting had more comorbidities and a history of 
prior  infections.  No  correlation  between  infections  and  cytopenia/hypogammaglobulinemia  was 
identified. The applicant clarified that two subjects who experienced serious CNS enteroviral infections 
had  normal  immunoglobulins,  neutrophils  and  lymphocyte  counts.  The  incidence  of  COVID-19  was 
comparable between the two arms with serious cases in 0.7% ublituximab-treated patients and 0.4% 
teriflunomide-treated patients as per 20 November 2020 cut-off date. 
The applicant has presented updated safety data based on a data cut-off date of 01 March 2022. Overall 
the incidence and the pattern of TEAEs, serious TEAEs, AESIs was consistent with that observed in data 
Assessment report  
EMA/173313/2023

provided  in  the  initial  submission  as  per  20  November  cut-off  date.  The  risk  of  IRR  remained  as  an 
important identified risk and the risk of serious infections as an important potential risk for ublituximab 
in RMS. No new safety concerns or risks were identified from this safety update. The applicant provided 
detailed  analysis  of  COVID-19  impact  on  patients  safety.  Overall,  no  definitive  trend  in  baseline 
characteristics  or  disease  history  for  participants  who  had  any  COVID-19-related  adverse  events  was 
observed. However, age and obesity were confirmed as a risk factors for fatal COVID-19-related adverse 
events.  
As  per  20  November  2020  cut-off  date,  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  were  reported  in  4.2%  of  patients 
treated  with  ublituximab  in  the  pivotal  studies.  The  AEs  were  anaphylactic  reaction,  hypersensitivity, 
IRR,  myalgia  and  tracheobronchitis.  At  01  March  2022,  out  of  the  974  participants  included  in  the 
Ublituximab  Update  Safety  set  of  phase  III  trials,  55  had  at  least  1  TEAE  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation. The most common TEAE leading to discontinuation of ublituximab treatment was COVID-
19 pneumonia. 
As  per  20  November  2020  cut-off  date,  three  deaths  were  reported  in  the  pivotal  studies  in  the 
ublituximab  group (encephalitis, pneumonia and salpingitis). The event of  pneumonia  was considered 
possibly  related  to  ublituximab.  In  the  other  two  fatal  events  it  is  not  possible  to  exclude  a 
causative/permissive role of ublituximab-induced immunosuppression; for the information provided, the 
encephalitis  case  was  due  to  measles  infection  in  an  apparently  unvaccinated  patient,  and  in  the 
salpingitis case the fatal outcome could have been linked to a delay in seeking medical assistance. At 01 
March  2022,  out  of  the  974  participants  included  in  the  Ublituximab  Safety  Update  phase  III  set,  22 
cases of TEAE with an outcome of death were reported. The additional 19 cases of death were due to 
COVID-19 related events. 
No differences in safety profile with respect to hepatic impairment at baseline was reported. However, it 
is noted that a very limited number of patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no patients with 
severe hepatic impairment at baseline were included.  
There were no clinically meaningful differences observed in TEAE, SAE, drug discontinuations, AESI and 
deaths  in  participants  receiving  ublituximab  with  mild  renal  impairment  compared  to  normal  renal 
function. Since only 4 subjects with moderate renal impairment were included in the studies, no analysis 
of ublituximab safety profile was possible.  
Use of ublituximab during pregnancy may cause foetal harm and may cause infant B-cell depletion. There 
were 14 cases of pregnancy reported (including 3 cases of pregnancy of the subject’s partner) in the 
ublituximab  clinical  development  program.  One  case  of  spontaneous  abortion  and  3  cases  with  an 
unknown outcome were reported. The outcome of 5 pregnancies were full-time delivery of a healthy new 
born.  
It is noted that a substantial number of subjects exposed to ublituximab developed TE-ADA (81.3% in 
the pooled analysis of the pivotal studies and 52.5% in Study TG1101-RMS201). 34 subjects included in 
Studies TG1101-RMS301 and one TG1101-RMS302 were NAb positive. However, there is no impact on 
efficacy and safety as indicated in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary  of  Product  Characteristics.  Section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  include  dedicated  subsections  for  IRR, 
infection  and  laboratory  abnormalities  including  immunoglobulins  decreased,  lymphocytes  and 
neutrophils.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
MS is a chronic disease of the CNS characterised by inflammation, demyelination, and axonal/neuronal 
destruction, ultimately leading to severe disability. In a majority of patients (up to 85%), the disease 
starts  with  a  relapsing  and  remitting  form  of  MS,  and  recovery  from  each  relapse  may  often  be 
incomplete and lead to the accumulation of disability.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
An increasing number of DMTs approved in RMS are available, with different efficacy and safety profile, 
different modes of action, and different routes of administration. Ublituximab will join the DMD targeting 
B-cells to prevent acute inflammatory activity in MS.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal studies that characterise the efficacy and safety of ublituximab in RMS are Study TG1101-
RMS301  and  Study  TG1101-RMS302  (two  identical  Phase  III,  120-week,  randomised,  multicentre, 
global, double-blinded, double-dummy, active-controlled studies). These studies were primarily designed 
to assess the ARR and safety and tolerability of ublituximab/oral placebo compared to teriflunomide/IV 
placebo in subjects with RMS. 
Efficacy  data  from  Study  TG1101-RMS201,  a  Phase  IIa,  52-week,  dose-ranging,  placebo-controlled, 
multicentre study, are used as supportive information for the efficacy of ublituximab in RMS. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Ublituximab,  compared  to  teriflunomide,  significantly  reduced  ARR  by  59.4%  (rate  ratio:  0.406  [95% 
CI:  0.268,  0.615];  p<0.0001)  in  Study  TG1101-RMS301  and  by  49.1%  (rate  ratio:  0.509  [95%  CI: 
0.330,  0.784];  p=0.0022)  in  Study  TG1101-RMS302.  In  addition,  ublituximab  in  comparison  to 
Assessment report  
EMA/173313/2023  
Page 124/129 
 
 
 
teriflunomide caused the significant reduction of the mean number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions by 96.7% 
(ratio: 0.033 [95% CI: 0.019, 0.058]; p<0.0001) by Week 96 in Study TG1101-RMS301 and reduction 
by  96.5%  (ratio:  0.035  [95%  CI:  0.019,  0.064];  p<0.0001)  by  Week  96  in  Study  TG1101-RMS302. 
Similarly,  the  ublituximab  administration  reduced  the  mean  number  of  new  and  enlarging  T2 
hyperintense lesions. It caused reduction by 92.4% (ratio: 0.076 [95% CI: 0.056, 0.104]; p<0.0001) 
by Week 96 in Study TG1101-RMS301 and reduction by 90.0% (ratio: 0.100 [95% CI: 0.073, 0.136]; 
p<0.0001) by Week 96 in Study TG1101-RMS302. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In  the  clinical  studies  with  ublituximab  there  was  a  very  limited  number  of  patients  with  SPMS  with 
superimposed relapses. In line with EMA guideline (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev. 2), it is reasonable 
to  assume  that  relapses  in  RRMS  and SPMS  have  the  same  underlying  inflammatory  pathophysiology 
and therefore efficacy on relapses in RRMS patients may be extrapolated to efficacy on relapses in SPMS.  
The proportion of subjects with 12-week CDP was low and similar in both treatment groups (28 subjects 
[5.2%] in the ublituximab group and 32 subjects [5.9%] in the teriflunomide group). The time to CDP 
for at least 12 weeks was not statistically significant using a stratified log-rank test (hazard ratio: 0.843 
[95% CI: 0.504, 1.407; p=0.5099]). The proportion of subjects with 24-week CDP for at least 24 weeks 
using the pooled data was 18 subjects (3.3%) in the ublituximab group and 26 subjects (4.8%) in the 
teriflunomide group. Similarly 24-week CDP was not nominally significant using a stratified log-rank test 
(hazard  ratio:  0.657  [95%  CI:  0.358,  1.205];  p=0.1716).  The  limited  number  of  CDP  events  in  both 
studies precluded the ability to detect a statistically significant difference.  As the 12-week CDP was the 
third  endpoint  in  the  hierarchy  for  controlling  for  multiplicity,  results  from  other  secondary  endpoints 
could  only  be  considered  as  exploratory.  Nevertheless,  only  NEDA  was  nominally  significant  in  both 
pivotal trials and it is already a composite or clinical and imaging markers of inflammatory activity.  
With 9.6% of patients recruited in USA/Western Europe between the two pivotal trials and a subgroup 
analysis  by  region  showing  inconsistency  in  results  between  areas,  with  a  more  favourable  profile  of 
teriflunomide  in  Western  Countries,  generalisability  of  the  results  towards  the  EU  was  extensively 
discussed  during  the  procedure.  Nevertheless,  relevant  variables  indicating  disease  characteristics  at 
baseline,  such  as  EDSS  score  and  T1/T2  lesions  count,  were  included  as  covariates  in  the  statistical 
analysis models. Further, in the analysis of ARR performed for the pooled data from both pivotal studies, 
the number of relapses in the ublituximab group was similar in both regions. Then, it may be agreed 
that the results for the ublituximab treatment group, including ARR, are highly consistent between the 
two regions. Conversely, the ARR result for the teriflunomide treatment group in the USA and Western 
Europe Region (ARR=0.035) is low and an outlier based on previous teriflunomide studies as well as the 
ARR that was observed in the larger Eastern Europe subgroup of studies TG1101-RMS301 and TG1101-
RMS302. Finally, it was concluded that results could be extrapolated to EU population.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In  line  with  the  safety  profile  described  for  other  anti-CD20  mAbs,  the  main  safety  issues  with  of 
ublituximab are the risk of IRR, cytopenias and infections.  
As per 20 November 2020, in the pooled analysis of the pivotal Phase III studies, cytopenias as AESIs 
were reported in 25.7% of subjects in the ublituximab group compared to 9.3% in teriflunomide group. 
In 12.1% of subjects treated with ublituximab, cytopenias of Grade ≥3 were reported (lymphocyte count 
decreased  –  5.5%;  lymphopenia  –  4%).  Neutropenia  was  observed  in  2%  of  patients  treated  with 
ublituximab in the pivotal Phase 3 studies. At 01 March 2022, out of the 974 participants included in the 
Ublituximab Update Safety set of phase III  trials, 222 (22.8%) had at least one IRR. had at least one

episode  of  cytopenia  with  102  of  Grade  ≥3.    Lymphopenia  and  Lymphocyte  count  decreased  were 
reported in 70 (24 of Grade ≥3) and 56  (30 of Grade ≥3) participants, respectively.  
IRR (e.g. pyrexia, chills, headache, influenza-like illness myalgia) were  quite common with ublituximab 
(5% of patients in the pivotal studies). As per 20 November 2020, in the pooled analysis of the pivotal 
Phase III studies,  for ublituximab-treated subjects, the incidence of IRR based on the AESI category 
was 47.7% in. At 01 March 2022, out of the 974 participants included in the Ublituximab Update Safety 
set of phase III  trials, 389 (39.9%) had at least one IRR. 
Overall, there seems to be a higher risk of fatal and serious infection AEs with ublituximab compared to 
the active comparator. As per 20 November 2020, in the pooled analysis of the pivotal Phase III studies, 
serious  infections  as  AESIs  were  reported  in  5.0%  of  subjects  in  the  ublituximab  group  and  2.9%  of 
subjects  in  the  teriflunomide  group.  At  01  March  2022,  out  of  the  974  participants  included  in  the 
Ublituximab Update Safety set of phase III  trials, serious infections were reported in 130 of which 117 
were of Grade ≥3. The most common TEAEs were pneumonia in particular in the context of COVID-19 
disease.  
As per 20 November 2020, in the pooled analysis of the pivotal Phase III studies, three patients died in 
the ublituximab arm (vs none in the comparator).Of these events, only one case (the pneumonia) was 
considered  related  to  ublituximab  by  the  applicant  or  Investigator.  However,  the  other  two  cases 
recognised an infective component as important step in their pathogenesis. Therefore, considering the 
possibility  of  ublituximab-induced  immunosuppression,  the  hypothesis  that  the  two  other  cases  of 
infections are both not related to the treatment cannot be easily dismissed.  At 01 March 2022, out of 
the 974 participants included in the Ublituximab Safety Update set of phase III  trials, 22 TEAE with an 
outcome of death were reported. The additional 19 cases of death were due to COVID-19 related events. 
A  substantial  number  of  subjects  exposed  to  ublituximab  developed  TE-ADA  (81.3%  in  the  pooled 
analysis  of  the  pivotal  studies  and  52.5%  in  Study  TG1101-RMS201).  From  these,  only  34  subjects 
included  in  Studies  TG1101-RMS301  and  one  TG1101-RMS302  were  NAb  positive.  The  applicant 
presented analysis indicating that the presence of TE-ADA or NAb did not impact, efficacy and safety of 
ublituximab.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Patients  >55  years  old  were  not  enrolled  in  the  study:  thus  safety  data  are  missing  in  this  relevant 
subgroup. Moreover, this subpopulation has an intrinsically higher cancer risk of malignancy: considering 
that ublituximab is a substance, in principle, able to impair the physiologic cancer immunosurveillance, 
there are, thus, uncertainties about the risk of malignancy (particularly in the older population). Hence, 
malignancy has been included as important potential risk.  
Although from the presented analysis, the presence of TE-ADA or NAb does not appear to impact PD, 
efficacy  and  safety  of  ublituximab,  potential  influence  on  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  ublituximab 
administered  in  the  subsequent  relapses  in  patients  previously  treated  with  ublituximab  remains 
unknown.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Ublituximab, in comparison to teriflunomide, significantly decreased the risk of relapses in RMS patients, 
as demonstrated in both pivotal trials. The risk reduction was high and the relative risk reduction was 
about 50%. The impact of the treatment on the MRI variables was also significant. The reduction of the 
mean number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions or the mean number of new and enlarging T2 hyperintense 
lesions was high, exceeding 90%. On the other hand, the proportion of subjects with 12- or 24-week 
CDP was low and similar in both treatment groups.  
From the safety perspective, in line with the safety profile described for other anti-CD20 mAbs, the main 
safety issues of ublituximab are known and includes the risk of IRR, cytopenias and infections. There 
seems  to  be  a  higher  risk  of  fatal  and  serious  infection  AEs  with  ublituximab  compared  to  the  active 
comparator. At the present time, possible correlations between infections (including CNS and Covid-19 
infections) and cytopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia cannot be excluded.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Although  ublituximab  demonstrated  a  significant  impact  on  the  ARR  and  MRI  markers  of  acute 
inflammatory activity, the analysis did not show a significant impact on the CDP. The applicant claims 
that  the  lack  of  the  effect  may  be  a  result  of  the  limited  number  of  CDP  events  in  both  studies  that 
preclude the ability to detect a statistically significant difference. This explanation can be followed.  
On top of underrepresentation of USA / Western Europe populations in both pivotal trials, results from 
subgroup analysis casted doubts about the generalisability of the results towards an EU population. In 
the analysis of ARR performed for the pooled data from both pivotal studies, the number of relapses in 
the  ublituximab  group  was  similar  in  both  regions.  Hence  it  may  be  agreed  that  the  results  for  the 
ublituximab treatment group, including ARR, are highly consistent between the two regions. Conversely, 
the  ARR  result  for  the  teriflunomide  treatment  group  in  the  USA  and  Western  Europe  Region 
(ARR=0.035) is low and an outlier based on previous teriflunomide studies as well as the ARR that was 
observed  in  the  larger  Eastern  Europe  subgroup  of  studies  TG1101-RMS301  and  TG1101-RMS302.  In 
fact, analysis of baseline values for baseline disease activity indicates that the proportion of patients with 
highly  active  disease  was  slightly  lower  in  the  US  and  Western  Europe  than  in  Eastern  Europe  for 
teriflunomide (9.4% vs 15.2%). This was further confirmed in the analysis of differences in the efficacy 
of teriflunomide in participants with active vs highly active disease (better results for patients who are 
not highly active disease). Consequently, it was agreed that the ARR observed in the Western European 
and US populations is lower than usual and finally it was agreed that efficacy results could be reasonably 
extrapolable to EU populations.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The  overall  benefit/risk  balance  of  Briumvi  is  positive,  subject  to  the  conditions  stated  in  section 
‘Recommendations’.

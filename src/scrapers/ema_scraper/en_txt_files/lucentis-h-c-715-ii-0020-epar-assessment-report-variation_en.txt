1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
(EMEA/516566/2009) for the following condition:  
 
treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema 
on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver in 
 
all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic 
macular oedema.  
Scientific Advice: 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on April 2007 (with a follow up advice on 
January 2008). The Scientific Advice pertained to clinical aspects of the dossier. A pre-submission 
meeting was also held with the two Rapporteurs and the European Medicines Agency in June 2009.  
The following main comments were provided: 
 
Central advice 
The exploratory phase II programme is insufficient with respect to i) demonstration of efficacy 
in target population including the various patient subgroups, ii) recommendations of dose and 
treatment regimen, iii) study endpoints and duration of treatment and iv) safety assessment in 
diabetic population. A confirmatory phase III clinical programme is thus requested. In case of a 
single  pivotal  confirmatory  study,  the  trial  should  be 
line  with  the  Guideline 
CPMP/EWP/2330/99.  However,  in  case  of  very  compelling  results  on  visual  acuity  (not  only 
statistically compelling, but clinically convincing as well), the study RESOLVE might however be 
considered as the basis for the approvability of the indication.

 
Pre-submission meeting 
The Rapporteurs acknowledged that the results of the Phase II trial RESOLVE appeared highly 
interesting and may be considered compelling. 
1.2.  Scope of the variation and changes to the dossier

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
DME  is  characterised  by  swelling  of  the  central  part  of  the  retina,  the  macula,  which  mediates  high-
resolution  visual  acuity  (VA).  DME  is  one  of  the  most  sight-threatening  complications  in  diabetes 
mellitus. DME has been estimated to occur in around 10% of the diabetic population, with a prevalence 
as high as 30% in patients with more than a 25-year history of diabetes. 
The  natural  progression  of  DME  leads  to  vision  loss  of  two  or  more  lines  (≥  10  letters)  of  VA  within 
2 years  in  approximately  50%  of  patients  (Ferris,  et  al  1984).  The  current  standard  of  care  in  the 
treatment  of  DME  is  laser  photocoagulation  that  has  been  demonstrated  to  slow  the  progression  of 
vision loss. In the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), a key study within the field 
of diabetic eye disease, patients with mild to moderate DR (diabetic retinopathy) and DME assigned to 
early  focal  laser  photocoagulation  were  half  as  likely  to  lose  15  or  more  letters  on  the  ETDRS  visual 
chart  compared  to  non-treated  subjects.  In  the  non-treated  population,  8,  16  and  24  %  lost    15 
letters  after  12,  24  and  36  months,  respectively  (ETDRS  Report  No  1,  1985).  On  average,  laser 
photocoagulation  stabilised  VA  over  3  years,  however  visual  improvement  was  uncommon  (<3%) 
which leaves 13% or more patients losing 15 or more letters after three years. (ETDRS Reports No 1, 
1985; No 2, 1987 and No 9, 1991). 
DME arises from breakdown of the blood retinal barrier (BRB), leading to leakage of fluid and plasma 
constituents in the surrounding retina, resulting in retinal oedema. It is well established through non-
clinical  as  well  as  clinical  data  that  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  has  a  major  role  in  the 
disruption of the BRB. For example, in the study by Vinores et al (1997), a dramatic increase in VEGF 
staining  of  the  retina  from  diabetic  patients  compared  to  that  observed  in  the  normal  human  retina 
that contained little or no VEGF, was demonstrated. Elevated VEGF concentrations were also present in 
the vitreous humour of patients with diabetic retinopathy (Aiello et al., 1994).  
Since  VEGF  appears  to  be  a  major  endogenous  mediator  of  macular  oedema  in  diabetic  retinopathy 
(DR), pharmacological therapy with ranibizumab to inhibit VEGF aims to address this underlying cause 
of  the  pathology.  As  a  consequence,  this  effect  is  intended  to  translate  into  a  reduction  in  vascular 
permeability and thus reducing macular oedema and subsequent loss of vision. 
About the product  
Ranibizumab  (Lucentis)  is  a  recombinant  humanised  IgG1  κ  isotype  monoclonal  antibody  fragment 
(Fab) that selectively binds and neutralises vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A). 
Lucentis was approved for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 
in  January  2007.  The  approval  was  based  on  demonstrated  efficacy  in  three  pivotal  clinical  studies 
(MARINA-FVF2598g  –  2  year  data,  ANCHOR-FVF2587g  –  1  year  data  and  PIER-  FVF  3192g  –  1  year 
data). Post approval, two year data from all pivotal studies confirmed the efficacy of the drug.  
In  wet  AMD,  Lucentis,  0.5  mg,  is  to  be  administered  by  intravitreal  (IVT)  injections  with  a  loading 
phase  of  one  injection  per  month  for  three  consecutive  months,  followed  by  a  maintenance  phase 
where a new injection should be given if the patient experiences a loss of > 5 letters in visual acuity 
(VA). Two doses, 0.3 and 0.5 mg, of ranibizumab were tested in the pivotal trials, the higher dose was 
found slightly more effective than the 0.3 mg dose.  
In  AMD,  there  was  a  significant  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  important  adverse  events  (AE), 
including  intraocular  inflammation,  increased  intraocular  pressure  (IOP)  >  30  mmHg  and  occasional 
cases of endophthalmitis. However, these problems were considered to be outweighed by the efficacy 
of the study drug.  
Development program 
For the proposed additional indication, there are no changes related to quality. Since the new targeted 
population  is  considerably  younger  than  the  AMD-population,  one  reprotoxicity  study  in  monkeys  has 
been conducted.

To support safety and efficacy of Lucentis in the treatment of DME, the MAH have submitted 12-month 
data from one pivotal phase II  clinical study, Study D2201 (RESOLVE). In addition, supportive safety 
data from diabetic patients from the AMD development programme (Table 1) and information from the 
published  READ-2  study  (Nguyen  et  al,  2009)  was  included  in  the  dossier.  Safety  signals  from  a 
number of currently ongoing phase III studies are also evaluated, see Table 1.  
As a response to the CHMP request for supplementary information, results of the pivotal study D2301 
(RESTORE),  a  12-months  study  exploring  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  ranibizumab  0.5  mg,  laser 
photocoagulation  or  the  combination  of  both  in  345  patients  with  visual  impairment  due  to  DME  was 
submitted.  
Also in this submission, the selected dose is 0.5 mg ranibizumab in 50 l, and as in AMD, treatment is 
to  be  initiated  with  monthly  injections  until  VA  and  the  macular  oedema  (e.g.  optical  coherence 
tomography  (OCT)  measurement)  are  stabilised  for  at  least  three  consecutive  months.  Treatment 
should be resumed when clinically relevant changes, as measured  by VA and/or macular oedema are 
attributable to activity of DME.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
IVT administration of 0, 0.125 and 1.0mg/eye of ranibizumab to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys 
The Cynomolgus monkeys were each given bilateral IVT of 0 (vehicle control), 0.125 and 1.0 mg/eye, 
every  14  days  from  Day  20  until  Day  62  of  gestation  neither  affected  prenatal  loss,  or  placental 
appearance,  nor  caused  embryotoxicity  or  teratogenicity.  This  could  be  expected  due  to  the 
pharmacological  mechanism  of  action  of  antibodies  directed  against  VEGF  and  the  importance  of 
angiogenesis  in  follicle,  corpora  luteal  and  embryo-foetal  development.  The  absence  of  ranibizumab-
mediated  effects  on  reproductive  parameters  might  be  due  the  low  levels  of  ranibizumab  in  the 
systemic circulation reaching placenta and foetus following administration via the IVT route and/or to a 
limited transfer of a Fab-fragment across the placenta.  
In the 1.0 mg/eye dose group, a more than dose dependent increase in serum Cmax values was shown. 
The  mean  maternal  Cmax  values  ranged  between  131-420  ng/ml  (range  51-1,990  ng/ml  in  individual 
animals).  The  more  than  dose-dependent  increase  correlated  with  an  increased  immunoreactivity  to 
ranibizumab which may have been mediated by a placental transport of ranibizumab to the foetus with 
anti-ranibizumab  antibodies  as  carriers,  however,  the  results  of  EFD  study  suggest  that  the  antibody 
mediated transport of ranibizumab across the placenta is limited. Only one foetus, from a mother with 
unusually  high  maternal  ranibizumab  concentrations,  showed  measurable  (230  pg/ml)  levels  of 
ranibizumab  in  the  cord  blood.  The  minor  developmental  findings  in  this  male  foetus  were  however 
within the same range as the controls and raise no concern. 
As  opposed  to  the  observation in  cynomolgus  monkeys,  anti-ranibizumab  antibodies  rarely  developed 
in  the  clinical  phase  II  and  III  studies  performed  for  the  patients  with  wet AMD  and  in  the  few  cases 
where  these  antibodies  were  found,  they  did  not  seem  to  cause  an  increase  in  (total)  serum 
ranibizumab  levels  and  did  not  affect  the  systemic  PK  profile  of  ranibizumab.  Hence,  monkeys  seem 
not to be predictive for humans in this respect.  
The CHMP concluded that the information derived from this study is indeed instructive and gives some 
reassurance. However, the limited pharmacokinetic data from patients with DME indicated that in case 
of a worst case clinical exposure (mean Cmax 8.5 ng/ml while a single subject had a Cmax of 58 ng/ml), 
the exposure margin to the mean C max values obtained in the monkey study ranged from 0.9 – 7-fold. 
Thus, there is no safety margin. Since VEGF inhibition has a potential to adversely affect the embryo-
foetal  development,  the  lack  of  a  safety  margin  in  case  of  a  worst  case  clinical  exposure  warranted 
further changes to section 4.6 and 5.3 of the SPC. The MAH accepted the CHMP request and updated 
section 4.6 and 5.3 accordingly (see section 3.7 of this report).  
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  MAH  had  appropriately  justified  the  lack  of  an  Environmental  Risk 
Assessment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamics  
No specific pharmacodynamic studies have been performed. The mechanism of action of ranibizumab is 
to decrease permeability of leaking blood vessels. This basic mechanism of action is valid independent 
on whether targeting retinal vessels in DME or choroidal vessels in AMD.  
Pharmacokinetics  
No data evaluating the systemic exposure in DME patients was initially submitted. The MAH stated that 
pharmacokinetics  studies  in  these  patients  were  at  the  time  of  submission  ongoing  and  data  became 
available in the first half of 2010. Given the IVT route of administration, a limited absorption into the 
systemic  circulation  is  expected.  However,  subjects  with  DME  have  highly  permeable  retinal  vessels 
and  likely  a  more  viscous  vitreous  since  they  are  younger  and  the  release  from  the  vitreous  may 
necessarily not be the same in DME patients as in the previously studied AMD-population. In patients 
with AMD, the predicted C max was 2.4 ng/ml while single C max levels were higher (up to 38 ng/ml) and 
there  were  no  indications  that  ranibizumab  accumulated  in  serum  over  time  after  monthly  IVT 
treatment  of  0.5  mg.  In  subjects  with  RVO,  the  majority  of  serum  concentrations  ranged  between 
0.075 and 2 ng/ml, while some subjects had plasma levels between 4 to 6 ng/ml at 2 months. In view 
of  the  fairly  low  margin  to  where  a  systemic  pharmacological  action  cannot  be  excluded,  the  CHMP 
concluded that data  evaluating the systemic exposure of ranibizumab in patients with DME had to be 
submitted. 
In the response the MAH stated that the PK evaluation as a part of the extension of the RESOLVE study 
(D2301E1)  was  still  ongoing  since  all  patients  that  had  consented  to  participate  in  the  study  had  not 
yet  needed  the  next  ranibizumab  dose.  Consequently,  the  MAH  was  not in  position  to provide  the  PK 
evaluation in DME patients as part of the response to the first request for supplementary information.   
Together  with  the  response  to  the  list  of  outstanding  issues,  the  MAH  submitted  the  data  from  study 
RFB002D2301E, i.e. Pharmacokinetics of ranibizumab in patients with diabetic macular edema.  
  DME population 
As  described,  data  evaluating  the  systemic  exposure  in  17  DME-patients  from  11  centres  was 
submitted as a sub-study of Study D2301 (Study RFB002D2301E1). Blood samples were obtained over 
one monthly dose interval before injection (not necessarily the first); 2, 4, and 24 hours post-injection; 
and once on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 post-injection (136 samples in total). Analyses were made with a 
validated  ELISA  with  a  lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLoQ)  of  0.075  ng/ml.  Non-compartmental  PK 
parameters  were  derived  with  WinNonlin  (Pharsight  Corporation,  Mountain  View,  CA,  USA)  and 
included Cmax, Tmax and AUC over a dose interval (AUCtau). Plots of the concentration-time data in 
DME patients were generated and compared to data from patients with AMD. 
Of the 136 samples, 44 (32%) were below LLoQ, generally predose, day 21, and day 28 samples. The 
remaining  92  concentrations  were  quantifiable.  Cmax  in  most  of  these  (78  concentrations)  were  <5 
ng/ml  and  14  concentrations  were  higher  (7.0  –  51.8  ng/ml).  The  highest  concentrations  were 
observed  at  2  to  4  hours  after  intravitreal  injection  and  were  generally  <  5  ng/ml  by  24  hours  post-
injection  for  the  remainder  of  the  dose  interval  (days  2  to  28).  A  single  subject  with  a  Cmax  of  58.1 
ng/ml (15th dose) had pre-dose concentration of 33 ng/ml and an end-of-dose-interval concentration of 
7.8  ng/ml  on  day  28.  Two  additional subjects  had  a  Cmax    10  ng/ml  (11.6  and  21.0  ng/ml). AEs  for 
the  three  subjects  with  the  highest  plasma  levels gave  no  concern,  see  section  3.6  on  clinical  safety. 
For concentration-time profiles and PK parameters, see below.

Figure 1. Concentration-time profiles in DME patients 
  Comparison between DME- and AMD-patients 
In AMD-patients, blood samples were taken at 1 hour post-injection (DME 2 and 4 hours). The highest 
concentrations  in  both  populations  are  on  day  1  shortly  after  the  IVT  injection  while  serum 
concentrations  were  generally <  5  ng/ml  24  hours  after  the  injection  (Figure  2).  There  is  a  trend  in 
the DME concentration data for a faster decline over the dose interval then in AMD patients (Figure 2,

  CHMP conclusion on pharmacokinetics 
Ranibizumab  inhibited  VEGF-induced  human  umbilical  vascular  endothelial  cell  proliferation  with  IC 50 
levels for  the  VEGF165,  VEGF121,  and  VEGF 110  isoforms  in  the  range  of  21  -  57  ng/ml  (the  highest  for 
the major isoform, VEGF 165). In view of the few DME-patients characterised (n=17, AMD: 228 subjects 
with measurable samples), the three subjects with plasma levels in this range represents a significant 
proportion  of  the  analysed  subset  of  patients.  Although  the  elevations  in  plasma  ranibizumab  were 
transient and seemed to decline faster than in subjects with AMD, the highest plasma level so far has 
been  reported  from  a  DME-patient.  In  view  of  the  few  patients  analysed,  the  analysis  is  highly 
uncertain,  but  may  nevertheless  indicate  that  a  slightly  higher  systemic  exposure  in  these  patients 
cannot  be  excluded.  This  may  represent  an  increased  risk  in  subjects  with  DME,  especially  in 
cardiovascular high risk patients and in case of pregnancy. However, to best appreciate the risks in the 
cardiovascular  high  risk  patients,  the  ongoing  studies  as  well  as  the  post-marketing  safety  study  is 
considered by the CHMP as the most valuable and no additional PK-data were requested.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Main studies 
Study D2201- RESOLVE  
Methods 
A single, double-masked 12-months study, Study D2201, evaluating 151 patients (ranibizumab 6 or 10 
mg/ml or sham; 1:1:1) was submitted by the MAH.  
The  study  was  originally  designed  as  an  exploratory  study  with  a  flexible  design  containing  interim 
analyses to increase the  probability to provide information for the future development, or to stop the 
trial early due to futility. Based on the results of the interim analysis, it was decided to have two parts 
for  the  analysis  of  efficacy,  a  pilot  part  (Group  A  –  unmasked  and  evaluated  in  the  interim  analysis) 
and a confirmatory part introducing the new primary efficacy endpoint ‘mean average change in visual 
acuity  from  baseline  from  Month  1  to  Month  12’  (Group  B,  remained  masked).  That  endpoint  was 
recommended  in  the  CHMP  scientific  advice.  The  CHMP  identified  a  few  questions  regarding 
methodological issues of the study, but no major issues. On the other hand, considering that a single, 
pivotal study was submitted, it must be confirmed without doubt that the study is flawless. Therefore, 
from an efficacy point of view, Group B was regarded as the single pivotal study (n=109), while Group 
A (n=42) will be regarded as an independent exploratory (and supportive) study. For analysis of safety, 
the  results  of  the  two  groups  are  pooled.  The  CHMP  considered  that  even  though  all  data  remained 
blinded  during  the  preliminary  review  before  proposing  the  amendments,  a  full  description  of  the 
methodology used for changing the endpoint was to be provided. The MAH therefore provided further 
justification  on  why  they  integrity  of  the  trial  was  maintained.  The  CHMP  considered  the  MAH’s 
explanation acceptable.  
The study included patients with type I or II diabetes mellitus, with stable HbA1c ( 12.0%), focal or 
diffuse DME with centre involvement (central retinal thickness, CRT  300 m) and a BCVA score in the 
study  eye  between  73  and  39  letters  (~  Snellen  equivalent  of  20/40  to  20/160).  As  patients  with  a 
significant  retinal  ischaemia  were  excluded  from  the  study  the  CHMP  questioned  whether  the  limited 
study  population  can  be  extrapolated  to  the  overall  target  population.  The  MAH  responded  by 
reiterating that 23 subjects with less central retinal ischaemia were included (in RESOLVE), of these 11 
ranibizumab-treated subjects with ischaemia involving an enlarged foveal zone. The mean VA in these 
11 subjects increased with 9.7 letters. In the 68 ranibizumab-treated patients with retinal ischaemia at 
baseline (moderate capillary loss to completely destroyed capillaries in the centre subfield) in RESTORE, 
there were no indications of an inferior treatment effect in these subjects (mean average change from 
baseline 6.3 letters, p<0.0005) compared to subjects with no retinal ischaemia (mean average change 
from  baseline  5.9-7.2  letters).  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  data  from  79  subjects  with  retinal 
ischaemia  are  reassuring  and  the  treatment  effect  observed  in  the  general  population  appears  to  be 
possible to extrapolate also to this subgroup of patients.  
The study also included subjects that were to have a best corrected visual acuity between 73 and 39 
letters  and  if  both  eyes  were  affected,  the  eye  with  the  worse  best  corrected  visual  acuity  was  to  be 
selected.  It  was  not  clear  to  the  CHMP  why  in  the  inclusion  criteria,  the  lower  best  corrected  visual 
acuity  limit  in  the  untreated,  fellow  eye  was  allowed  to  be  even  lower  (24  letters).  The  MAH  was 
therefore asked to explain this. The MAH responded by explaining that if both eyes were affected and 
eligible for enrolment into the study (i.e. each having BCVA between 73 and 39 letters), the worse eye 
was  to  be  chosen  for  randomization  into  the  study,  unless  appropriate  justification  based  on  medical 
reason  could  be  provided  by  the  investigators.  However,  if  the  fellow  eye  was  not  concomitantly 
affected  by  the  disease  under  study,  and  thus  not  eligible  for  study  entry,  another  inclusion  criterion 
was to be fulfilled. Under this inclusion criterion it was ensured that a patient with only one seeing eye 
is  not  enrolled  in  the  study,  thus  the  fellow  eye  BCVA  needed  to  be  a  minimum  24  letters,  in 
compliance with clinical research ethical requirements. This inclusion criterion explains why BCVA levels 
in the fellow eye could be lower than 39 letters. The CHMP accepted the MAH’s explanation. 
The  first  dose  was  0.3  or  0.5  mg  ranibizumab.  Based  on  specified  Optical  coherence  tomography 
criteria (OCT-criteria), the dose could be doubled to 0.6 or 1.0 mg at any time point after the first dose 
by doubling the injection volume. Dosing was initiated with 3 monthly injections, thereafter a flexible, 
VA  and/or  OCT-driven  re-treatment  approach  was  taken.  In  this  study,  a  comparison  vs.  sham,  and 
not  laser  treatment  was  performed.  Since  the  disease  course  in  DME  –  with  and  without  laser 
EMA/13901/2011

treatment - is well characterised through the ETDRS, the choice of sham as comparator in a 12 months 
study is accepted. Rescue laser photocoagulation was permitted. 
The primary outcome measure was “the difference between the average level of BCVA (letters) over all 
monthly post-baseline assessments from Month 1 to Month 12 and the baseline level of BCVA”. It was 
not clear to the CHMP how this had been calculated and the MAH was therefore asked to clarify. The 
MAH  subsequently  presented  the  algorithm  for  calculation  of  the  primary  endpoint.  The  endpoint  as 
such  is  not  questioned  by  the  CHMP,  although,  in  retrospect,  considered  conservative  due  to  the 
continuous increase in VA over time. 
Key  secondary  endpoints  were  “the  change  from  baseline  in  BCVA  at  all  post-baseline  visits”,  the 
responder analysis categorising the “change from baseline in terms of gain or loss of 10 and 15 letters” 
and  “the  proportion  of  subjects  with  a  VA  of  >73  or  less  than  39  letters”.  Additional  secondary  and 
exploratory endpoints assessed the central retinal thickness (CRT), severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
and retinal perfusion. 
Results 
In this section, focus is on the confirmatory Group B and comparisons between the pooled ranibizumab 
groups  and  sham  are  made  since  several  subjects  have  received  the  doubled  dose  at  different  time 
points. Thereafter, the effect/dose-relationship is assessed.  
Demographics  in  the  included  patient  population  were  essentially  comparable  across  treatment  arms. 
Very few subjects with type I diabetes were included in the study. Considering that vision loss in type I 
diabetes is predominantly due to proliferative complications of retinopathy, whereas vision loss in type 
II diabetes is mainly due to DME, it may not be possible to extrapolate the results from type II to type 
I diabetes. The range of the HbA1c was between 5 and 11, which is rather representative, albeit on the 
more controlled side, of the overall diabetes population. Importantly, only subjects without significant 
retinal  ischaemia  were  included  in  study  D2201.  Published  data  indicate  that  treatment  with  VEGF-
inhibitors  may  not  be  of  benefit  in  this  population  and  this  needed  to  be  further  addressed.  Finally, 
although  no  differences  in  outcome  were  observed  between  subjects  that  were  naïve  to  laser 
photocoagulation  vs.  those  who  had  previous  laser  treatment,  it  is  important  to  further  address  this 
issue  as  patients  with  DME  without  visual  impairment  will  be  treated  with  laser  and  it  should  be 
confirmed  that  this  does  not  affect  the  outcome  of  ranibizumab  treatment.  Bearing  in  mind  the  few 
included  subjects,  especially  those  with  type  I  diabetes,  the  included  population  appears  rather 
representative  of  a  reasonably  controlled  diabetic  target  population  without  significant  retinal 
ischaemia.  With  these  limitations,  it  was  not  clear  to  the  CHMP  how  the  included  population  can  be 
extrapolated to the overall target population. 
In  the  response  the  MAH  acknowledged  that  vision  loss  in  type  I  diabetes  is  predominantly  due  to 
proliferative  complications  while  in  type  II,  mainly  due  to  DME.  However,  in  the  RESOLVE  study  no 
subjects with Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) were included and the MAH argued that DME as 
such should not differ between the subgroups. This was acknowledged by the CHMP despite the limited 
number of subjects with type I diabetes. There was also evidence of a treatment effect in subjects with 
Type I diabetes. The CHMP did however request that information on the lack of experience in subjects 
with proliferative diabetic retinopathy should be added to the SPC, section 4.4 (see section 3.7 of this 
report).  
As a response to the CHMP request for supplementary information, results of study D2301 (RESTORE), 
a 12-months study exploring the efficacy and safety of ranibizumab 0.5 mg, laser photocoagulation or 
the combination of both in 345 patients with visual impairment due to DME was submitted.  
As  for  the  previously  discussed  subgroups,  with  regards  to  metabolic  control  of  the  included  patient 
population,  there  appears  to  be  no  important  differences  between  subgroups.  However,  RESTORE 
included subjects with a stricter metabolic control (HbA1c≤ 10%) compared to RESOLVE (HbA1c≤ 12%) 
and there were no subjects with an HbA1c above 11 % in any of the studies. Consequently, The CHMP 
requested  the  MAH  to  include  information  on  the  lack  of  experience  with  in  uncontrolled  disease  in 
section 4.4 of the SPC. 
The  primary  and  key  secondary  endpoints  for  the  confirmatory  part  (Group  B)  are  shown  in  Table 3

In the confirmatory Group B (FAS with LOCF), there was a mean average improvement from baseline 
in the two ranibizumab-treated dose groups of 7.6 letters while the difference vs. sham was 6.7 letters, 
since  a  slight  improvement  was  observed  also  in  the  sham  arm.  It  is  not  unexpected  that  subjects 
being part of a study improve their metabolic control, thus stabilising their VA. The outcome based on 
the mean average change from baseline is clinically interesting, however not conclusive.  
The effect on improvement of VA was rapid and there appears to be a continuous mean improvement 
in  VA  over  time  in  the  ranibizumab-treated  groups.  During  the  12  months,  it  is  not  evident  that  a 
plateau has been reached. Therefore, the analysis of VA as an average mean between months 1-12 is 
highly  conservative  and  the  secondary  endpoint  analysing  the  “mean  change  from  baseline”  at  12 
months  is  considered  of  equal  importance.  There  was  also  a  meaningful  proportion  of  subjects  that 
reached a good VA (>73 letters), 49 % in the pooled ranibizumab groups vs. 12 % in the sham-treated 
group (p=0.0002). 
Sensitivity  analyses  of  these  endpoints  supported  the  outcome  of  the  primary  analyses  (FAS/LOCF). 
The outcome in the exploratory Group A was consistent with that of Group B. There appeared to be no 
major  differences  in  VA  outcome  between  the  different  subgroups,  e.g.  type  of  DME,  baseline  VA, 
retinal  thickness,  HbA1c  and  duration  of  DME.  However,  there  were  few  subjects  in  many  of  the 
subgroups. 
In  the  supportive  Group  A,  20%  vs.  11%  gained    15  letters  (P=0.2191),  71  vs.  18  %  gained    10 
letters  (p=  0.0061)  and  0  vs.  18  %  lost    10  and  15  letters  in  VA  in  the  pooled  ranibizumab  groups 
and the sham group, respectively. Although the proportion of patients who gained >10 letters at Month 
12 was threefold higher in the pooled ranibizumab group compared to sham, the CHMP requested the 
MAH to provide an analysis of the 10 letter increase in VA according to baseline VA levels (if the limited 
sample  size  allowed  this)  and  a  discussion  on  the  clinical  relevance  of  this  increase  depending  on 
baseline VA. 
Based  on  the  MAH’s  response  to  this  request,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  results  in  the  RESTORE 
study  support  those  from  the  RESOLVE  study.  Nevertheless  the  clinical  relevance  of  10  letters  gains 
was only discussed by the MAH in the context of the proportion of subjects that achieve this outcome. 
The  clinical  impact  on  other  relevant  clinical  parameters,  such  as  quality  of  life  remains  only  partly 
supported since NEI-VFQ-25 gives some support, while other quality of life questionnaires do not.  
Approximately  70%  and  40%  of  ranibizumab  treated  subjects  gained    10  and    15  letters, 
respectively in VA compared to 20 and 10 % in the sham group (Group B, pooled ranibizumab doses 
p=0.0002).  Few  patients  treated  with  ranibizumab  lost  VA.  After  12  months,  50%  of  ranibizumab-
treated  patients  had  a  VA  over  79  letters  (>20/25)  vs.  12%  in  the  sham  group.  These  effects  are

considered to be of major importance for the patient and must be regarded as compelling according to 
the CHMP. 
Treatment  with  ranibizumab  also  had  a  rapid  and  substantial  effect  on  reducing  the  thickness  of  the 
oedema (Group B, p<0.0001 vs. sham). Overall, the exploratory parameters evaluated tended to show 
a  benefit  of  ranibizumab  over  sham  (numerically  or  statistically  significant).  Among  the  exploratory 
parameters, besides being an efficacy measure, the evaluation of loss of retinal capillaries (total areas 
of  non-perfusion)  is  of  importance  also  for  the  evaluation  of  safety  since  VEGF-inhibition  has  been 
hypothesised  to  negatively  affect  retinal  perfusion.  No  increase  in  the  areas  of  non-perfusion  was 
evident  during  the  12  months  treatment  period.  There  appears  to  be  no  major  differences  in  VA 
outcome between the different subgroups, e.g. type of DME, baseline VA, retinal thickness, HbA1c and 
duration  of  DME.  However,  few  subjects  have  been  part  of  the  study  and  it  is  difficult  to  draw  any 
definite conclusions. The observation indicated that the duration of DME did not appear to influence the 
effect of ranibizumab-treatment.  
Selection of dose 
The  mean  dose  administered  was  stated  by  the  MAH  to  be  0.61  mg  (Groups  A  and  B  combined)  and 
the  MAH  consequently  applied  for  the  0.5  mg  dose  with  a  flexible  dosing  frequency  in  line  with  that 
recommended for wet AMD. Although it is recognised that all doses appear to have an effect on VA, an 
optimal (and the most clinically convincing) effect should be aimed for. Further evaluation of the choice 
of dose was therefore considered as needed by the CHMP.  
The MAH therefore presented how the mean 0.6 mg dose was calculated and it was acknowledged that 
selection  bias  (different  for  mainly  0.5  mg  –  immediate  responders  and  mainly  0.6  mg  –  non-
immediate responders) could be introduced by addressing the two groups separately, and possibly also 
together. Only the 0.5 mg dose has been studied in RESTORE and the overall magnitude of effect was 
smaller  than  in  RESOLVE  (somewhat  worse  population  and  potentially  also  due  to  the  more  frequent 
dosing in RESOLVE). The comparison of the effect in the subgroup in RESTORE with inclusion/exclusion 
criteria matching those in RESOLVE (VA up to 73 letters, 78 in RESTORE; CRT > 300 m – no limit in 
RESTORE) essentially reproduced the outcome of RESOLVE, although data is limited to the first months 
of the study due to the later differences in re-treatment criteria.  
However,  analysing  the  very  few  subjects  in  the  RESTORE  subgroup  with  a  good  baseline  VA  (>73 
letters)  with  a  concomitant  limited  oedema  (<  300  m),  there  was  no  benefit  over  ranibizumab  vs. 
laser  treatment.  Until  information  on  whether  these  subjects  will  have  a  potential  future  benefit  of 
early  ranibizumab  treatment  is  available,  these  subjects  should  not  be  treated  with  IVT  ranibizumab. 
The  MAH  was  therefore  requested  by  the  CHMP  to  include  a  clear  statement  on  this  in  the  SPC.  The 
MAH agreed and updted the product information accordingly. 
Re-treatment criteria are based on either a decrease in VA or an increase in central retinal thickness. 
However,  in  the  sought  indication,  an  oedema  alone  is  not  an  indication  for  treatment.  This  is  an 
important  distinction,  since  subjects  with  DME  do  not  necessarily  have  a  visual  impairment.  An 
evaluation on the outcome (primary and key secondary endpoints) of subjects that were re-treated due 
to an increased retinal thickness only vs. those who were re-treated due to visual impairment (with or 
without  oedema)  was  considered  to  be  needed  by  the  CHMP  together  with  a  justification  of  the 
proposed  re-treatment  criteria  in  relation  to  the  proposed  indication  “treatment  of  visual  impairment 
due to DME”.  
The  MAH  therefore  provided  further  analysis  (although  on  limited  data)  which  concluded  that  re-
treatment  based  on  an  increase  in  CRT  only  while  VA  is  stable  does  not  give  a  significant  benefit  in 
terms of increased VA and that re-treatment should be based on decrease in VA and not on a decrease 
in  VA  or  an  increase  in  the  oedema.  Further,  if  an  acutely  increased  CRT  is  not  treated,  it  does  not 
seem to lead to any short term (4 months perspective) negative effects on VA, however, subjects with 
a fairly good VA (>73 letters) and a CRT of > 300 m, may lose VA if untreated. On the other hand, 
the  few  subjects  with  a  VA    73  letters  and  a  limited  oedema  (<300  m)  did  not  appear  to  have  a 
benefit of treatment. The change to re-treat patient only based on loss of VA has been implemented in 
the SPC, section 4.2 as proposed by the MAH (see section 3.7). Until it has been shown that there is a 
long-term  benefit  on  a  future  impairment  of  VA  if  treatment  is  based  on  an  increase  in  CRT,  this 
change is endorsed by the CHMP.

Study D2301- RESTORE 
As a response to the CHMP request for supplementary information, results of the pivotal study D2301 
(RESTORE),  a  12-months  study  exploring  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  ranibizumab  0.5  mg,  laser 
photocoagulation  or  the  combination  of  both  in  345  patients  with  visual  impairment  due  to  DME  was 
submitted.  
Methods 
A  randomised,  double-masked,  12-months  multicenter,  laser-controlled  Phase  III  study  assessing  the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  IVT  ranibizumab  (0.5  mg)  as  adjunctive  to  laser  photocoagulation or  as  mono-
therapy (+ sham laser) vs. laser (+sham IVT injection) in patients with visual impairment due to DME 
(n=345, 1:1:1).  
Treatment  with  IVT  ranibizumab  or  sham  was  initiated  with  one  injection  per  month  for  three 
consecutive months (Day 1, Month 1 and Month 2) where after monthly administration was continued 
until vision was stabilised for 2 visits or reached > 84 letters (~20/20 Snellen equivalent). Treatment 
was re-initiated with monthly injections if there was a decrease in BCVA due to DME progression until 
the  criteria  above  were  fulfilled.  These  are  criteria  applicable  to  clinical  practice  and  differ  somewhat 
from  RESOLVE  where  re-treatment  was  based  on  a  decrease  in  VA  and/or  an  increase  in  CRT.  Laser 
treatment (active or sham) was administered at Day 1, 30 minutes prior to ranibizumab (or sham) and 
thereafter when needed according to the ETDRS protocol. 
The  study  included  a  somewhat  different  patient  population  compared  to  RESOLVE,  see  main 
differences in inclusion/exclusion criteria in the table below.

The  outcome  measures  were  similar  to  those  in  RESOLVE  with  “the  difference  between  the  average 
level of BCVA (letters) over all monthly post-baseline assessments from Month 1 to Month 12 and the 
baseline  level  of  BCVA”  as  the  primary  endpoint.  Key  secondary  endpoints  were  “the  change  from 
baseline  in  BCVA  at  all  post-baseline  visits”,  the  responder  analysis  categorising  the  “change  from 
baseline in terms of gain or loss of 10 and 15 letters (or had a BCVA of 84 letters)”, “the proportion of 
subjects  with  a  VA  of  >73  or  less  than  39  letters”  and  change  in  CRT.  Exploratory  analyses  included 
severity of DR, retinal perfusion and quality of life questionnaires (e.g. NEI-VFQ-25). 
Results 
The  conduct  of  the  study  was  acceptable  to  the  CHMP  with  relatively  few  discontinuations  (12-13%) 
that  were  comparable  between  groups.  The  majority  of  these  subjects  withdrew  consent  or 
discontinued due to AEs. 
Baseline characteristics were reasonably similar between treatment arms, but compared to RESOLVE, 
subjects  had  an  average  better  baseline  VA  (+3  letters)  and  thinner  macula  (-40m)  and  the  study 
included  also  68  ranibizumab-treated  subjects  with  central  retinal  ischaemia.  In  addition,  besides 
having  an  active  PDR,  there  were  no  restrictions  on  the  type  or  duration  of  DR  which  indicate  a 
potential to include a population representative for the target population. Also in this study, there were 
few ranibizumab-treated subjects with type I diabetes (n=28). Although vision loss in type I diabetes is 
predominantly due to proliferative complications while in type II, mainly due to DME, no subjects with 
PDR (proliferative retinopathy) were included and therefore, the DME as such should not differ between 
the  subgroups.  There  were  also  no  subjects  with  uncontrolled  diabetes,  proliferative  changes,  prior 
history of TIA and very few ranibizumab-treated subjects with a previous stroke (only in RESOLVE, n= 
5). The CHMP requested that this should be reflected in the SPC. The MAH accepted this and updated 
the product information accordingly (see section 3.7).

Extent  of  exposure:  Subjects  received  in  average  7  injections  (ranibizumab  or  sham).  The  majority 
(>95%) received the three initial monthly injections with the remaining 4 during months 3-11. In the 
subgroups  with  a  CRT  <  300  m  fewer  injections  were  given  (5.4,  4.7  and  5.9  in  the  ranibizumab, 
ranibizumab + laser and laser arms, respectively) compared to those with a CRT of > 400 m (7.5, 7.9 
and  8.0  injections).  Compared  to  RESOLVE,  subjects  received  on  average  3  fewer  injections  in 
RESTORE. 
The  mean  number  of  active/sham  laser  administrations  was  similar  for  the  groups.  After  patients 
received their fist active or sham laser at baseline, during months 3-11, patients received on average 
~  1  active/sham  laser  administration.  Only  two  subjects  appeared  to  receive  additional  rescue  laser 
treatment, which is consequently not likely to have affected the overall outcome of the study.

Similar outcomes were observed independent on LOCF-imputation method or population (observed, PP) 
with  p-values  consistently  below  0.0001.  The  outcome  of  the  primary  endpoint  is  statistically 
convincing  and  clinically  interesting,  however  not  compelling.  Compared  to  study  D2201  where  the 
mean average change was 7.6 letters, this is somewhat lower. 
The treatment effect in ranibizumab-treated groups was rapid and the increase in VA was statistically 
significant vs. laser from month 1 (see Figure  3 below). VA appears to stabilise after 6-8 months. As 
in RESOLVE, the analysis of VA as an average mean between months 1-12 is considered conservative 
and the secondary endpoint analysing the “mean change from baseline” at 12 months is considered of 
equal importance.

As  for  the  primary  endpoint,  the  outcomes  were  consistent  for  the  secondary  endpoints  in  various 
sensitivity  analyses.  Overall,  there  was  no  difference  between  ranibizumab  as  monotherapy  and 
ranibizumab in combination with laser treatment. Consequently, the data do not give any guidance on 
when a combination treatment would be needed.  
Treatment  with  ranibizumab  also  had  a  rapid  and  substantial  effect  in  reducing  the  thickness  of  the 
oedema. 
In the VFQ-25 questionnaire, the mean change from baseline for the composite score and for subscales 
related  to  vision  were  in  favour  of  ranibizumab  and  statistically  different  vs.  laser  (p  varied  between 
0.0446 – 0.0005). Some improvement was also observed with regards to social functioning (4-5 units), 
but  there  was  no  effect  on  dependency  or  driving  (p>0.05).  The  magnitudes  of  changes  in  vision 
related effects were numerically similar to the observed in the AMD-population. 
With  regards  to  mean  change  in  VA  from  baseline,  the  absolute  figures  are  lower  than  reported  in 
study  D2201  where  the  mean  change  from  baseline  was  10.7  letters.  However,  subjects  in  RESTORE 
had  a  somewhat  better  baseline  VA  (~3  letters)  and  a  less  affected  retinal  thickness  compared  to 
RESOLVE. Therefore, the subgroup analyses below are of particular interest. Further, subjects received, 
on average, 3 fewer injections of ranibizumab in this study compared to RESOLVE which may also have 
impacted  the  magnitude  of  the  outcome  but  has  to  be  weighed  against  a  decreased  risk  with  fewer 
injections. 
There  was  a  clinically  significant  proportion  of  subjects  that  gained  10  (~25%  more  than  laser)  and 
15 (~15% more than laser) letters, but as for the mean change in VA, the size of the effect is smaller 
than in study D2201 (~44 and 27% more than laser). The proportion of subjects that had a VA of >73 
letters (mean in ranibizumab groups  49%) is considered to  be  of clinical significance and comparable 
to the outcome in RESOLVE (49%). As in RESOLVE, very few subjects had a VA below < 39 letters at 
month 12.

The  MAH  also  presented  an  additional  analysis  on  RESTORE-subjects  with  RESOLVE-like 
inclusion/exclusion  criteria  which  indicates,  although  data  are  limited,  that  the  lower  magnitude  of 
effect  in  the  RESOLVE  study  may  have  been  affected  by  the  better  baseline  VA/reduced  retinal 
thickness. 
Several  subgroup  analyses  on  for  example,  age,  DME  type,  diabetes  type,  prior  laser,  presence  of 
central  retinal  ischaemia,  baseline  BCVA,  baseline  CRT,  blood  pressure,  HbA1c,  duration  of  DME  and 
combinations  of  more  than  one  of  these  parameters  were  performed.  Although  few  subjects  were 
included  in  many  of  the  subgroups  and  the  data  should  be  interpreted  with  caution,  in  none  of  the 
groups, laser treatment was superior to ranibizumab or the combination of ranibizumab and laser and 
in most subgroups, the treatment effect of ranibizumab  laser in terms of mean average change in VA 
was statistically significant vs. laser.  
Subjects with a lower baseline VA (60 letters) had a larger benefit than subjects with a better initial 
VA, while subjects with a baseline VA of >73 letters or those with a thin central retina (<300 m) had 
a smaller and non-statistically significant (p>0.05) benefit of ranibizumab. However, no firm conclusion 
can  be  made,  since  there  was  a  “ceiling  effect”,  i.e.  a  number  of  subjects  with  a  relatively  good 
baseline VA reached a VA of  84 letters. Importantly, subjects with retinal ischaemia at baseline had a 
benefit of ranibizumab (laser) compared to laser (p<0.0006). Subjects with a VA of > 73 letters and 
diffuse  DME  responded  poorly  in  terms  of  number  of  letters  improvement  and  the  combination  with 
ranibizumab  and  laser  resulted  in  a  deterioration  of  VA  (-1.9  letters).  However,  few  subjects  were 
evaluated and in this subgroup, the loss of VA was even more pronounced in the laser treatment group 
(-4.7  letters).  On  the  other  hand,  subjects  with  a CRT  <  300m  together  with  a  baseline  VA  of  >  73 
letters  did  equally  well  as  those  treated  with  laser.  Although  a  very  limited  number  of  subjects  were 
included  in  this  subgroup,  considering  the  risks  with  the  IVT  injection,  the  benefit/risk  may  not  be 
positive  for  this  subset  of  patients.  Until  information  on  whether  these  subjects  will  have  a  potential 
future benefit of early ranibizumab treatment is available, information on the lack of benefit for these 
subjects has been included in the SPC (see section 3.7). 
Factors  like  baseline  blood  pressure,  cholesterol,  triglycerides  and  HbA1c  did  not  reveal  any  relevant 
differences in outcome. Improvement in VA was observed independent on the type of diabetes (Type I 
or II), however, borderline significant (p=0.0532 for ranibizumab as monotherapy, p= 0.0352 for the 
combination), but few subjects were analysed. 
Choice of dose, dosing frequency and criteria for re-treatment 
The choice of the 0.5 mg dose has been substantiated in the RESOLVE study and is further supported 
by the study from DRCRnet (see supportive studies below).  
Data  support  the  treatment  and  re-treatment  criteria,  i.e.  treatment  is  to  be  initiated  with  monthly 
dosing  and  continued  until  VA  is  stable  (on  treatment)  for  three  months,  where  after  monthly 
monitoring  of  VA  should  determine  whether  re-treatment  (based  on  a  decrease  in  VA)  should  be 
resumed.  Data  does  however  not  give  support  to  a  re-treatment  based  on  an  increase  in  CRT  only 
while VA is stable, since such patients do not experience a significant benefit in terms of increased VA. 
Further,  if  an  acutely  increased  CRT  was  not  treated,  it  did  not  seem  to  lead  to  any  short  term  (4 
months  perspective)  negative  effects  on  VA.  Since  additional  analyses  suggest  that  if  assessing  the 
response over 2 months, there is a risk of missing a relevant number of patients that gain an increase 
in VA between month 2 and 3. However, very few subjects with a stable VA seem to have a potential 
for  an  even  later  gain  (after  3  months)  in  VA.  Thus,  the  treatment  criteria  are  in  the  opinion  of  the 
CHMP  reasonably  described  in  the  SPC,  section  4.2.  Further,  subjects  that  experience  an  initial 
decrease  in  VA  are  not  necessarily  non-responders  (as  observed  in  AMD-patients)  since  those  on 
ranibizumab-treatment experienced a gain in VA with continued treatment, while laser-treated subjects 
did not. However, since DME is a chronic problem, and anti-VEGF therapy is likely to be required in an 
ongoing  fashion,  the  MAH  will  evaluate  a  more  practical  regimen  when  additional  information  on  the 
persistence of the effect and treatment-free intervals is available from planned and ongoing studies.  
It  is  not  known  whether  there  are  patients  with  specific  characteristics  that  may  not  respond  to 
treatment  and  it  is  not  fully  clear  when  treatment  should  be  discontinued.  The  MAH  was  therefore 
requested  to  commit  to  collect  and  analyse  data  related  to  specific  initial  treatment  responses  (both 
stability and decline) to identify possible non-responders from all ongoing studies including previously 
finished studies.

Supportive studies 
The  published  study  by  Nguyen  et  al.,  compared  ranibizumab  (0.5  mg)  with  focal/grid  laser  or  the 
combination of ranibizumab and laser treatment (n=126, 1:1:1). At month 6, the mean gain in BCVA 
was  significantly  greater  in  the  ranibizumab  group  (+7.2  letters,  P  =  0.01)  compared  with  the  laser 
group  (+0.4  letters),  and  the  group  combining  ranibizumab  and  laser  (+3.8  letters),  the  latter  not 
statistically different from the other groups. Improvement of 15 letter occurred in 8/37 (22%) in the 
ranibizumab  group  compared  with  0/38  (0%)  in  the  laser  group  (P  =  0.002)  and  37/40  (8%)  in  the 
combination group. Excess foveal thickness was reduced by 50%, 33%, and 45% in the three groups. 
The  study  supports  the  use  of  ranibizumab  to  improve  VA  in  DME,  also  when  comparing  to  best 
standard of care, i.e. laser treatment. However, the combination of ranibizumab and laser appeared to 
reduce the effect of ranibizumab as monotherapy. 
A  recently  published  supportive  study  from  DRCRnet  (Diabetic  Retinopathy  Clinical  Research  Network 
(2010), Randomized Trial Evaluating Ranibizumab Plus Prompt or Deferred Laser or Triamcinolone Plus 
Prompt  Laser  for  Diabetic  Macular  Edema.  Ophthalmology.  2010  Apr  22.  [Epub  ahead  of  print]) 
included a patient population very similar to that included in the submitted studies. After 1 year, there 
was  a  9  letter  increase  vs.  baseline  for  both  groups  that  received  ranibizumab  (0.5  mg,  n=187  and 
188/group)  after  8-9  injections  and  2-3  laser  treatments,  while  laser  (n=293)  and  triamcinolone 
(TA)+laser-treated  subjects  (n=186)  had  a  3-4  letters  increase.  Responder  data  in  ranibizumab-
treated  groups  were  similar  to  those  obtained  in  RESOLVE  (~30%    15  letter  increase,  ~50%    10 
letter  increase  vs.  baseline).  The  study  is  of  particular  interest,  since  there  is  a  significant  proportion 
(57%) of patients that have been followed for 2-years so far. During the 2nd year, subjects received 2-
3 ranibizumab-injections, and ranibizumab + prompt laser had a mean increase in VA of 7 letters while 
the  increase  in  the  ranibizumab  +  deferred  laser  arm  had  a  10  letter  increase  from  baseline 
(sham+laser +2 letters, TA+laser +1 letter) with maintained responder data, see Figure 4 below.  
Figure 4 Visual acuity, mean change from baseline 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety  assessments  included  monitoring  and  recording  all  adverse  events  (AEs),  serious  adverse 
events  (SAEs),  VA,  concomitant  medications,  ophthalmic  examinations  (slit  lamp  biomicroscope  and 
indirect  ophthalmoscope),  IOP,  vital  signs  and  laboratory  parameters.  Risks  (potential  safety  issues) 
that have been previously identified in the treatment of AMD were also analysed in the RESOLVE and 
RESTORE data set. 
Patient exposure 
In  RESOLVE  and  RESTORE  (primary  safety  data  set),  335  subjects  have  been  administered 
ranibizumab  (0.3  –  1  mg),  whereof  the  majority  on  0.5  mg  and  120  subjects  have  been  given  the 
combination with laser  photocoagulation.  Subjects  have  been  given  in  average  7-10  injections  during 
12 months.  
EMA/13901/2011

Additional supportive safety data: 
  AMD subjects with diabetes: 523 ranibizumab-treated diabetic (and 3213 ranibizumab-treated non-
diabetic)  subjects  from  controlled  and  non-controlled  AMD  trials.  The  523  diabetic  patients  had 
received, in average 5 injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab for up to two years. 
  SAEs from 4 ongoing, still masked trials in DME (see Table 1). 
  6-month  safety  data  in  84  DME  patients  treated  with  ranibizumab  and  ranibizumab  +  laser  are 
 
provided from the published READ-2 study (Nguyen et al.).  
In  total,  799  DME  patients  from  the  DRCRnet  study  whereof  ~  200  have  been  treated  with 
ranibizumab (+ laser) for 2 years has been provided. 
The  primary  safety  data  set  is  still  rather  limited,  especially  with  regards  to  treatment  with  the 
combination of ranibizumab and laser. In this data set demographics and disease characteristics were 
fairly  well  balanced  at  baseline.  Including  the  elderly  subjects  with  AMD  and  diabetes  adds  to  the 
information on age-related risk factors in this group. On the other hand, considering that the general 
DME patient is younger, additional number of years with IVT treatment may be expected. Although of 
support,  in  the  AMD  studies,  the  mean  duration  of  diabetes  was  shorter  than  in  the  RESOLVE  and 
RESTORE  studies  and  these  patients  have  not  been  diagnosed  with  DME  and  due  to  their  shorter 
duration of diabetes, the AMD subjects likely have a less advanced disease. The 2-year data from the 
published  study  from  DRCRnet  is  of  high  interest  as  the  reporting  of  AEs  from  this  study  is  very 
detailed. 
Adverse events  
Ocular Adverse Events 
No increased frequency or any new ocular AEs compared to those already listed in the SPC, section 4.8 
were  identified.  AEs  were  predominantly  of  mild  or  moderate  severity.  The  frequency  of  AEs  in 
RESTORE was markedly lower than in RESOLVE and there were no indications that the combination of 
ranibizumab and laser resulted in an increased frequency or more serious AEs.

The  majority  of  the  events  were  regarded  as  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  and  related  to  the  ocular 
injection.  There  were  no  major  differences  in  AEs  when  doubling  the  dose  by  doubling  the  injection 
volume.

In RESOLVE, the increase in Intraocular pressure (IOP) was more frequent in subjects administered 1 
mg  of  ranibizumab.  This  appeared  not  to  be  due to  the  doubled  injection  volume  and  may  be  due  to 
the  higher  amount  of  drug.  However,  none  of  the  cases  were  regarded  as  severe  as  they  consisted 
mainly of transient increases in conjunction with the IVT injection that can be managed. Nevertheless, 
the  0.5  mg  dose  is  applied  for,  and  in  RESTORE  there  were  very  few  cases  of  increased  IOP  and  no 
such serious event. 
In RESOLVE, there was also a higher frequency of corneal disorders or cataracts/ lenticular opacities. 
They  were  all  non-serious,  therefore,  only  the  investigator  (judged  as  not  related),  not  the  MAH, 
assessed  the  causality.  Further,  in  RESOLVE,  only  single  cases  of  corneal  erosions  were  reported. 
Taken the studies together, this is considered by the CHMP to be adequately reflected in the SPC. To 
note is that the frequency of intraocular inflammation is substantially lower than in the AMD trials.  
There  appeared  to  be  no  new  risks  in  subjects  with  significant  central  retinal  ischaemia  (68  subjects 
included in RESTORE, 15 with less significant and less central ischaemia in RESOLVE). Ocular AEs from 
the 6-months READ-2 study revealed no additional risks (no SAEs were reported). 
In the study from DRCRnet major AEs (available data up to 2 years, n=484 in total) included 2 cases 
of  endophthalmitis  (ranibizumab-treated),  retinal  vein  occlusion  (1  each  in  laser  and  the  two 
ranibizumab arms, 3 in the triamcinolone arm) and increased IOP (similar in ranibizumab and laser 6-
9%, 42% in triamcinolone (TA) arm). Additional AEs reported were similar as previously identified for 
ranibizumab.

Non-Ocular Adverse Events 
In  both  studies,  the  most  frequently  reported  non-ocular  events  were  nasopharyngitis  and 
hypertension.  The  majority  of  non-ocular  AEs  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  and  few  were 
suspected to be related study drug and/or ocular injection. Besides an increased frequency of urinary 
tract infection in ranibizumab (monotherapy)-treated subjects in RESTORE (3.5%), there were no new 
AEs.  The  SPC  has  been  updated  accordingly.  There  were  no  major  changes  in  HbA1c  and  blood 
pressure during the course of the study. However, the CHMP considered that there is potential signal of 
AEs  related  to  systemic VEGF-inhibition,  also in  this  population,  as  shown in  Table  9  and  10.  This  is 
considered  by  the  CHMP  to  be  adequately  reflected  in  the  updated  SPC  provided  by  the  MAH  (see 
section 3.7).

In  the  limited  PK  sub-study,  3  subjects  had  plasma  levels  over  10  ng/ml,  i.e.  a  level  where  systemic 
VEGF-inhibition  may  be  relevant.  The  subject  with  the  highest  VEGF-levels  (52  ng/ml)  experienced  a 
mild hypertension 28 days after the last (15th) dose of ranibizumab and 56 days after plasma sampling. 
The event was regarded as non-related to treatment. No AEs possibly related to VEGF-inhibition were 
observed in the two remaining subjects. 
In the study from DRCRnet (484 subjects, 2-years treatment), the frequency of CV events during the 2 
years  (defined  according  to  the  Antiplatelet  Trialists'  Collaboration)  was  lowest  in  the  ranibizumab-
treatment arms (5%) vs. 12 and 6 % in the laser and TA arms, respectively.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Ocular Serious Adverse Events 
Three  cases  of  endophthalmitis  were  identified  in  RESOLVE.  Although  no  events  of  endophthalmitis 
were observed in RESTORE, considering the still relatively limited safety database in subjects with DME, 
there  is  a  need  for  the  continued  monitoring,  since  the  diabetic  population  is  known  to  be  more 
susceptible to infections. None of the SAEs in RESTORE were considered related to treatment. 
Non-Ocular Serious Adverse Events 
In RESOLVE; there were, in total 8 (7.8%) and 5 (10.2%) SAEs in the pooled ranibizumab dose groups 
and  in  the  sham  group,  respectively.  Events  of  particular  interest  included  a  case  of  MI  (10 mg/ml 
ranibizumab)  and  an  allergic  reaction.  In  RESTORE,  SAEs  occurred  in  13.9%  of  the  patients  in  the 
ranibizumab arm, 8.3% of the patients in the ranibizumab + laser arm, and in 11.8% of the patients in 
the laser arm and were mainly related to the following System organ classes: cardiac disorders (3.5% 
of  the  patients  in  the  ranibizumab  arm,  1.7%  ranibizumab  +  laser,  4.5%  laser)  and  infections  and 
infestations (3.5%, 0.8%, and 4.5%, respectively). It is somewhat surprisingly that  the frequencies of 
AEs and SAEs were higher in the ranibizumab treatment arm compared to the combination arm. This 
may  be  by  chance;  however,  only  4  subjects  experienced  SAEs  suspected  as  treatment-related  (3  in 
ranibizumab  monotherapy  arm,  1  in  the  combination  arm).  Events  of  interest  were  coronary  artery 
occlusion  (n=1),  pulmonary  embolism  (n=2)  and  arterial  thrombosis  limb  (n=1),  but  the  frequencies 
are not considered as alarming by the CHMP. 
One  death  (urinary  bladder  cancer)  was  reported  in  RESOLVE  study  and  in  RESTORE,  seven  patients 
died during the study, two in each ranibizumab treatment arm and three in the laser treatment arm. 
None  of  the  deaths  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study  treatment,  however,  in 
the  ranibizumab  treatment  arms  they  were  due  to  cardiopulmonary  failure,  cerebrovascular  accident, 
MI and renal failure and in the laser arm due to cardiac disorder/failure and diabetic foot. For some of 
the events, a relation with VEGF-inhibition cannot be excluded. On the other hand, this is a population 
with  major  cardiovascular  co-morbidities  for  which  the  issue  will  be  monitored  through  the  RMP  and 
further  addressed  in  the  post-marketing  study  where  subjects  at  risk  (including  previous 
cardio/cerebrovascular events, hypertension etc) will be included. 
In the ongoing DME studies, so far, the total number of fatal events is similar as in the AMD-studies. In 
the READ-2 study, there was one death due to cerebral vascular accident. The patient had a history of 
cardiovascular disease and death occurred six weeks after first injection of ranibizumab. The event was 
not considered suspected related to study drug. In the DRCRnet study, the frequency of the vascular 
deaths  after  2  years  was  highest  in  the  laser  treatment  group  (5%)  vs.  2  %  in  the  ranibizumab 
treatment groups. 
Adverse event profile compared to the AMD-population with and without 
diabetes 
In  the  primary  data  set,  an  increased  frequency  of  urinary  tract  infection  (RESTORE  –  ranibizumab 
monotherapy)  and  the  higher  frequency  of  increased  IOP  (RESOLVE,  1  mg  ranibizumab)  and 
endophthalmitis  (RESOLVE  only)  were  observed.  The  signal  regarding 
increased  IOP  and 
endophthalmitis  in  diabetes  patients  from  RESOLVE  was  not  supported  from  data  in  diabetic  subjects 
with AMD, nor is the high frequency of endophthalmitis supported from the ongoing studies (3 events 
in  1104  patients).  Compared  to  subjects  with  AMD,  in  the  DME-studies  subjects  appears  to  have  a 
lower frequency of intraocular inflammation.  
Importantly,  ranibizumab-treatment  did  not  appear  to  increase  the  incidence  of  retinal  blood  flow 
deterioration  in  the  diabetic  AMD  subjects  or  in  the  subjects  with  retinal  ischaemia  included  in 
RESTORE. However, there are still few subjects with significant retinal ischaemia that has been treated. 
This is further addressed in this report as part of the assessment of the RMP (see section 3.8).  
Although there was no difference in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects with regards to non-ocular SAEs 
the  signal  with  regards  to  AEs  potentially  related  to  VEGF-inhibition  is  relevant  also  for  subjects  with 
DME. 
EMA/13901/2011  
Page 22/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety in special populations 
No influence of intrinsic factors (age, gender, blood pressure, HbA1c, duration of diabetes, time since 
diagnosis of diabetes, time since diagnosis of DME and concomitant insulin medication) was observed. 
There  were  no  pregnancies  during  the  study  and  there  is  no  previous  experience.  The  potential  of 
ranibizumab to affect embryo-foetal and/or placental development pregnant cynomolgus monkeys did 
not  reveal  any  adverse  effects.  However,  the  limited  pharmacokinetic  data  from  patients  with  DME 
indicated that in case of a worst case clinical exposure (mean Cmax 8.5 ng/ml while a single subject had 
a  C max  of  58  ng/ml),  the  exposure  margin  to  the  mean  Cmax  values  obtained  in  the  monkey  study 
ranged from 0.9 – 7-fold. Thus, there is no safety margin.  
There  is  also  no,  or  very  limited,  experience  of  ranibizumab-treatment  of  diabetic  subjects  with 
uncontrolled  disease,  proliferative  DR,  history  of  stroke  or  TIA.  The  MAH  was  therefore  requested  by 
the CHMP to address this in the SPC. The MAH subsequently updated section 4.4 of the SPC, which was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP (see section 3.7). 
Immunological events 
In  RESOLVE,  three  subjects  had  positive  post  baseline  immunoreactivity  results  to  ranibizumab.  No 
additional  evaluation  has  been  performed  in  RESTORE.  The  CHMP  considered  that  there  are  no 
important differences between AMD and DME-subjects with regards to immunoreactivity. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific drug interaction studies were performed. As systemic exposure of ranibizumab is expected 
to be very low, the potential for drug interactions is considered low. There is no information available 
on concomitant intraocular medication in the dossier provided by the MAH. The efficacy and safety of 
subjects  with  previous  laser  treatment  as  well  as  concomitant  treatment  with  laser  photocoagulation 
and ranibizumab was similar as in subjects without prior laser treatment and those on ranibizumab as 
monotherapy  although  the  experience  is  limited.  This  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  to  be  adequately 
reflected in the updated SPC submitted by the MAH (see section 3.7). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  the  RESOLVE  and  RESTORE  studies,  there  were  relatively  few  discontinuations  (from  the  study  or 
from treatment) due to AEs.  
Post marketing experience 
The  post-marketing  data  is  analysed  in  the  most  recent  Lucentis  PSUR  (No.6),  submitted  on  23 
September 2009, covering the time period from 1-Jan-2009 to 30-Jun-2009. Based on the assessment 
of  post  marketing  safety  information  received  during  the  PSUR  6  period,  as  well  as  cumulative  data, 
the positive benefit-risk profile of Lucentis in treating patients with neovascular AMD remains. 
2.7.  Product Information  
Only changes to the SPC of particular importance are discussed in this section of the report. A detailed 
description  of  all  changes  is  included  as  attachment  1  to  this  report.  The  included  changes  are 
underlined and deletions are shown as strikethrough.

Summary of Product Characteristics 
Section 4.1 
Lucentis is indicated in adults for: 
  the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (see section 5.1). 
  the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) (see section 5.1). 
Section 4.2 
Based on the discussion of the submitted data as described in detail previously in this report the CHMP 
finally agreed on the following text to be included in section 4.2 of the SPC: 
Treatment of visual impairment due to DME 
In visual impairment due to DME, the recommended dose for Lucentis is 0.5 mg given as a single 
intravitreal injection. This corresponds to an injection volume of 0.05 ml. 
Treatment is given monthly and continued until maximum visual acuity is achieved i.e the patient’s 
visual acuity is stable for three consecutive monthly assessments performed while on ranibizumab 
treatment.  Consequently,  if  there  is  no  improvement  in  visual  acuity  over  the  course  of    three 
injections, continued treatment is not recommended. 
Thereafter patients should be monitored monthly for visual acuity. 
Treatment  is  resumed  when  monitoring  indicates  loss  of  visual  acuity  due  to  DME.  Monthly 
injections  should  then  be  administered  until  stable  visual  acuity  is  reached  again  for  three 
consecutive  monthly  assessments  (implying  a  minimum  of  two  injections).  The  interval  between 
two doses should not be shorter than 1 month. 
Lucentis and laser photocoagulation in DME 
There is some experience of Lucentis administered concomitantly with laser photocoagulation (see 
section  5.1).  When  given  on  the  same  day,  Lucentis  should  be  administered  at  least  30 minutes 
after laser photocoagulation. Lucentis can be administered in patients who have received previous 
laser photocoagulation. 
Pending  the  outcome  of  the  planned  and  ongoing  studies,  the  MAH  should,  if  warranted,  suggest 
further  updates  to  this  section  of  the  SPC.    There  are  no  relevant  data  to  specify  when  treatment 
should  be  discontinued  in  case  of  an  ongoing  loss  during  the  “resumed”  treatment  phase.  The  CHMP 
therefore suggested that this is left for the treating physician to decide upon. 
Section 4.4 
More detailed information on the risk for developing hypersensitivity has been included as follows: 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Lucentis. Since there is 
a  potential  for  an  increased  systemic  exposure  in  subjects  with  DME,  an  increased  risk  for 
developing  hypersensitivity  in  this  patient  population  cannot  be  excluded.  Patients  should  also  be 
instructed to report if an intraocular inflammation increases in severity, which may be a clinical sign 
attributable to intraocular antibody formation. 
In  addition,  two  paragraphs  on  the  limitations  on  the  data  for  the  treatment  on  populations  that  has 
not been sufficiently studied (included patients with type I diabetes) have been included as follows: 
There  is  only  limited  experience  in  the  treatment  of  subjects  with  DME  due  to  type  I  diabetes. 
Lucentis  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  who  have  previously  received  intravitreal  injections,  in 
patients  with  active  systemic  infections,  proliferative  diabetic  retinopathy,  or  in  patients  with 
concurrent eye conditions such as retinal detachment or macular hole. There is also no experience 
of  treatment  with  Lucentis  in  diabetic  patients  with  an  HbA1c  over  12%  and  uncontrolled 
hypertension. 
There  are  no  data  on  safety  in  the  treatment  of  DME  patients  with  prior  history  of  stroke  or 
transient  ischaemic  attacks.  Since  there  is  a  potential  risk  of  arterial  thromboembolic  events 
following intravitreal use of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibitors caution should be 
exercised when treating such patients (see section 4.8).

Section 4.6 
This section has been updated to reflect the data in cynomolgus monkeys. Recommendations have also 
been included on the time recommended for waiting after the last treatment before conceiving a child 
(i.e. to wait at least 3 months). In case of a worst case exposure, DME-subject may have a systemic 
exposure close to the exposure margins in the reprotoxicity study. The CHMP therefore considered that 
this justifies a more stringent recommendation. The amended wording would be as follows:   
Women of childbearing potential/contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment. 
Pregnancy 
For  ranibizumab  no  clinical  data  on  exposed  pregnancies  are  available.  Studies  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys  do  not  indicate  direct  or  indirect  harmful  effects  with  respect  to  pregnancy  or 
embryonal/foetal development (see section 5.3). The systemic exposure to ranibizumab is low after 
ocular  administration,  but  due  to  its  mechanism  of  action,  ranibizumab  must  be  regarded  as 
potentially  teratogenic  and  embryo-/foetotoxic.  Therefore,  ranibizumab  should  not  be  used  during 
pregnancy unless the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. For women who 
wish  to  become  pregnant  and  have  been  treated  with  ranibizumab,  it  is  recommended  to  wait  at 
least 3 months after the last dose of ranibizumab before conceiving a child. 
Breast-feeding Lactation 
It is not unknown whether Lucentis is excreted in human milk. Breast-feeding is not recommended 
during the use of Lucentis. 
Section 4.8 
This  section  has  been  updated  to  reflect  the  safety  data  accumulated  for  the  DME  population  (see 
attachment 1).  
Section 5.1 
Several paragraphs have been added to this section. The information included is mainly in relation to 
results from studies in DME with a focus on the confirmatory phase III study (see attachment 1).

Ongoing safety concerns 
Initial  analysis  by  the  MAH  of  safety  data  did  not  reveal  any  new  important  identified  and  important 
potential risks apart from the previously identified risks in the AMD-population. However, during CHMP 
assessment, vitreous haemorrhage was noted as an imported identified risk. Additionally, several areas 
of missing information concerning treatment with ranibizumab in DME-patients were identified. The list 
of ongoing safety concerns has been amended. The resulting list is shown below (Table 11).

Pharmacovigilance Plan 
The  long-term  extension  of  the  RESTORE  study  (visual  impairment  in  DME)  has  been  included  in  the 
list  of  planned  pharmacovigilance  actions  concerning  all  important  identified  and  potential  risks  and 
important  missing  information  regarding  long-term  safety  beyond  2  years  and  intraocular  antibody 
formation. The aim of the study is to evaluate ocular and non-ocular adverse events over an additional 
two  years  of  ranibizumab  treatment  following  one  year  of  treatment  in  the  core  study.    In  addition, 
data from the extension study will be combined with the core study data to evaluate ocular and non-
ocular adverse events over a cumulative three-year period. 
Evaluation of the need for a Risk minimisation plan 
The  MAH  proposed  that  the  risk  minimisation  measures  already  in  place  for  the  AMD-indication  are 
adequate and no additional measures are planned in relation to the DME-indication.  
The  MAH  considered  that  the  established  routine  risk  minimisation  activities  for  hypersensitivity 
reactions, retinal pigment epithelial tear, retinal detachment, retinal tear, intraocular inflammation, IOP 
increase, vitreous haemorrhage, hypertension, non-ocular haemorrhage, proteinuria, MI, non MI-ATEs, 
VTEs,  deterioration  of  retinal  blood  flow  including  CRAO,  systemic  AEs  related  to  bilateral  treatment 
and  overdose,  AEs  related  to  off-label  use,  long-term  safety  beyond  2  years,  intraocular  antibody 
formation, long term effects on the progression of diabetic retinopathy including the potential effect on 
diabetic  retinopathy  of  stopping  periodic  anti-  VEGF  injections  (DME  only),  effects  of  Lucentis  on  the 
deterioration  of  retinal  blood  flow  including  macular  ischemia  (DME  only),  systemically  unstable 
patients (DME only) and  age greater than 75 (DME only) are sufficient.  
For  endophthalmitis  and  traumatic  cataract  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  comprise  an 
educational plan for healthcare professionals and patients. 
CHMP discussion and conclusion on the RMP 
The CHMP considered the RMP to be in accordance with the Vol. 9A guideline. 
The  safety  population  for  the  sought  extension  of  the  indication  to  include  treatment  of  visual 
impairment due to DME initially consisted of patients enrolled in the RESOLVE study (CRFB002D2201). 
In  addition,  patients  with  diabetes  enrolled  in  the  randomised  clinical  trials  for  AMD  have  been 
identified  and  safety  data  analysed.  The  diabetic  patients  in  the  AMD-trials  were  older  and  had  a 
shorter duration of diabetes compared to the patients enrolled in the RESOLVE study. Patients with DR 
were  excluded  from  the  AMD  clinical  trials.  Although  the  safety  populations  have  different 
characteristics,  important  information  can  be  collected  from  the  diabetic-AMD-group.  The  supportive 
data  from  this  patient  population  has  been  included  in  an  updated  RMP  (annex  7).  Additionally,  the 
RMP  has  been  amended  with  data  from  the  recently-completed  visual  impairment  due  to  DME  in  the 
RESTORE  study.  However,  there  is  limited  information  with  regards  to  treatment  of  elderly  subjects 
EMA/13901/2011  
Page 26/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with  DME  and  subjects  that  have  an  unstable  disease.  In  addition,  there  is  a  lack  of  information 
regarding treatment of other ethnicities than Caucasians. This is now reflected in the RMP and partly in 
the SPC, except for the limited experience in treatment in subjects >75 years with DME.  
Overall,  the  ocular  and  non-ocular  AE  pattern  was  similar  between  the  DME  patients  and  the  AMD 
population.  The  CHMP  endorsed  that  ongoing  routine  and  additional  risk  minimisation  measures  are 
extended to include the DME-indication. 
The  risk  of  endophthalmitis  in  the  DME  patients  in  the  RESOLVE  study  was  10  times  higher  than 
expected from the AMD-studies. Safety data from the pooled diabetic population in the AMD-studies do 
not indicate an increased risk of endophthalmitis in diabetes patients. In the now available data from 
the RESTORE study there were no reports of endophthalmitis. The pooled incidence of endophthalmitis 
for patients with DME in controlled trials after one year is 3/217 (1.4%) on ranibizumab monotherapy, 
which is comparable to the incidence in AMD (1.6%).  
Patients  with  a  history  of  chronic  renal  failure  or  kidney  transplant  were  excluded  from  the  RESOLVE 
study.  Advanced  DR  often  occurs  simultaneously  with  renal  microangiopathy  and  proteinuria.  In  the 
study by Hirai 2008 (Am J Ophthalmol 145;700) in patients with clinically significant macular oedema, 
nephropathy  was  present  in  49%  of  patients  with  type  1  diabetes,  21%  in  type  2  diabetes  patients 
without  insulin  and  30%  in  type  2  patients  with  insulin  treatment.  There  is  a  potential  class-effect  of 
anti-VEGF-drugs inducing proteinuria due to an effect on the renal glomerular capillaries. Results from 
the RESOLVE and RESTORE studies concerning protein levels in urine have been presented. There is no 
immediate  indication  of  increased  risk  of  proteinuria  in  diabetic  patients  treated  with  ranibizumab. 
Proteinuria is included in the RMP as an area of missing information and will be closely monitored and 
reported in future PSURs. 
In contrast to the high levels of VEGF found in the eyes of diabetic patients with retinopathy, low levels 
of  VEGF  and  its  receptors  are  found  in  the  myocardium,  resulting  in  inadequate  collateral  formation. 
These  findings  suggest  that  diabetic  patients  might  be  more  prone  to  the  development  of  myocardial 
ischemia if circulating VEGF is blocked. The CHMP considered that this issue is adequately discussed in 
the updated RMP.  
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterised by vascular changes  giving rise to progressive reduction of 
retinal blood flow. Eventually, new blood vessels might be formed within the eye (Proliferative Diabetic 
Retinopathy - PDR). Vascular changes in peripheral retina can occur simultaneously with DME. Patients 
with PDR were not enrolled in the RESOLVE study. Results from the RESTORE study indicate that the 
treatment with ranibizumab does not have a negative impact on the progression of the overall DR over 
the first treatment year. However, the long-term effect on progression of DR is not known. This was an 
area of missing information which has now been included in the RMP. 
There  is  the  potential  of  off-label  use  in  patients  with  DME  without  visual  impairment.  The  proposed 
indication  and  subsequent  labelling  and  summary  of  educational  materials  support  the  use  of 
ranibizumab “in visual impairment due to DME” only. The proposed update of the educational material 
was endorsed by the CHMP. The MAH has committed to submit this material for review.  
From  available  data,  it  seems  that  there  are  no  identified  safety  concerns  if  ranibizumab  is 
administered concomitantly with laser or in patients who previously have received laser. However, data 
are limited and the relation of IVT ranibizumab treatment to conventional focal/grid laser treatment in 
the long-term remains an area of missing information.  
The  effect  of  ranibizumab  treatment  on  the  progression  of  overall  diabetic  retinopathy  and  on  the 
development  of  macular  ischemia  should  be  addressed  in  the  ongoing  long-term  studies  (36-month 
studies RIDE and RISE and the RESTORE 24-month extension study).  
User consultation 
No  full  user  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the  package  leaflet  has  been  performed.  The 
MAH did however submit a bridging report making reference to the user test results of the Lucentis wet 
AMD  Package  Leaflet  carried  out  in  April  2006.  The  bridging  report  submitted  by  the  MAH  was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP.

2.9.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  ranibizumab  is  to  decrease  permeability  of  leaking  blood  vessels.  This 
mechanism  of  action  is  valid  independent  on  whether  targeting  retinal  vessels  in  DME  or  choroidal 
vessels in AMD. Therefore, available data from the AMD-population adds to the basic understanding of 
the drug. This is of relevance also for understanding the treatment of DME.  
A  statistically  convincing  effect  of  ranibizumab in  the  treatment  of  visual impairment  due to  DME  has 
been  demonstrated  in  one  phase  II  (RESOLVE)  and  one  phase  III  study  (RESTORE).  Sufficient  data 
support  the  choice  of  dose,  0.5  mg,  the  flexible  dosing  frequency,  the  re-treatment  and  stopping 
criteria  that  are  based  on  assessment  of  VA.  The  effect  of  ranibizumab  was  consistently  superior  to 
that  of  sham  treatment  or  laser  photocoagulation.  The  effect  of  ranibizumab  as  monotherapy  or  if 
combined  with  laser  treatment  was  similar  and  consistent  across  analysis  of  primary  and  secondary 
analyses independent on analysis population.  
In  the  pivotal,  RESTORE  study,  the  mean  average  improvement  in  VA  (+6  letters-  similar  in  both 
ranibizumab  treatment  arm,  vs.  +1  letter  in  the  laser  therapy  group)  as  well  as  the  proportion  of 
subjects  that  gained    10  (~40%)  or  15  (23%)  letters  (16  and  8  %  in  the  laser  group)  in  VA  was 
lower than in RESOLVE (8 letter mean average improvement, vs. no change in the sham group, 62 and 
36 % gained  10 and 15 letters vs. 19 and 9% in the sham group).  
In ranibizumab-treated eyes, the increase in VA was rapid and continued over 6-12 months, thus the 
analysis  of  VA  as  an  average  mean  over  time  is  highly  conservative.  Therefore,  the  key  secondary 
endpoint analysing the “mean change from baseline at 12 months”, is considered of equal importance. 
After  12  months  treatment,  the  mean  improvement  in  VA  was  11  letters  vs.  no  change  in  the  sham 
group (-0.4 letters) in RESOLVE and 7 (similar in both ranibizumab treatment arm) vs. 1 letter in the 
laser treatment arm in RESTORE.  
Subjects with a lower baseline VA had the most benefit from treatment, but due to a potential ceiling 
effect  for  subjects  with  a  better  baseline  VA  (some  subjects  reached  84  letters,  ~20/20  Snellen 
equivalents  in  VA),  no  overall  conclusion  can  be  drawn.  Therefore,  the  lower  overall  gain  in  VA  in 
RESTORE may not be surprising since the population in this study had a better baseline VA (+3 letters) 
and  less  CRT  (-40m)  compared  to  subjects  in  RESOLVE.  This  is  supported  by  additional  analysis, 
although limited, on RESTORE-subjects with RESOLVE-like inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Even  though  the  improvement  in  VA alone  is  not significant,  the  proportion  of  subjects  that  gain  10 
and 15 letters/reach the ‘ceiling’ of 84 letters is considered to be of clinical relevance. The proportion 
of subjects that had a VA of >73 letters (~50%) or < 39 letters (1-3%) was also clinically significant 
and  comparable  to  the  outcome  in  RESOLVE.  Overall,  it  is  considered  that  the  meaningful  benefit  of 
ranibizumab indicated from RESOLVE has been confirmed in the RESTORE study and that this effect is 
relevant for the majority of patients in the target population.  
Many  subgroups  were  of  limited  size.  However,  with  one  exception,  subgroup  analyses  indicate  a 
benefit  of  ranibizumab  (laser)  over  laser.  The  very  limited  subgroup  of  subjects  with  a  rather  good 
baseline  VA  (>73  letters,  20/40  Snellen  equivalent)  together  with  a  limited  DME  (<300  m)  had  no 
additional benefit of ranibizumab-treatment. The observations that the duration of DME, previous laser 
photocoagulation or the presence of significant retinal ischaemia did not appear to influence the effect 
of  ranibizumab-treatment  is  important,  both  from  the  patient’s  view  and  from  the  perspective  of 
clinical practice. Few subjects with type I diabetes were included in the two studies. In type I diabetes, 
vision  loss  is  predominantly  due  to  proliferative  complications  while  in  type  II,  mainly  due  to  DME. 
However, in this study no subjects with proliferative retinopathy were included, only subjects with DME 
and  DME  as  such  should  not  differ  between  the  subgroups.  Furthermore,  there  was  evidence  of  a 
treatment effect of ranibizumab also in subjects with Type I diabetes. 
The  presented  studies  are  limited  to  12  months  and  the  long-term  effects  on  VA  are  not  known. 
However, the recently published study from DRCRnet (similar population as in the submitted studies) 
has  2-year  data  available  from  ~200  subjects  treated  with  Lucentis  and  laser  photocoagulation  (377 
such  patients  treated  for  1  year).  During  the  2nd  year,  subjects  received  2-3  additional  ranibizumab-
injections while essentially maintaining the 12-month gain in VA (9 letters).  
EMA/13901/2011  
Page 28/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, from a clinical perspective, the demonstrated effect appears convincing since, even with laser 
treatment (the only currently available treatment) no significant improvement of VA is to be expected 
in this population.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The persistence of the effect of ranibizumab, i.e. treatment-free intervals, of ranibizumab needs to be 
further  explored  to  evaluate  a  more  practical  dosing  regimen.  Although  treatment  with  ranibizumab 
has  been  the  first  treatment  that  significantly  improves  VA  over  12  months  in  subjects  with  visual 
impairment  due  to  DME,  the  long  term  effects  of  treatment  is  not  known.  A  long  treatment  may  be 
expected since the current target population is 10-15 years younger than the previously studied AMD-
population. Although some support is given by the recently published DRCRnet study, additional long-
term data is needed. Such data are to be generated in planned and ongoing studies.  
Ranibizumab may be used as monotherapy or in combination with laser photocoagulation. However, it 
is not known if an early, and maybe not lasting, gain in VA due to ranibizumab-treatment will result in 
a loss of the well characterised long-term preservation of vision due to laser treatment if laser is halted 
or deferred. On the other hand, since there were no additional treatment benefits with the combination, 
taking the (long term) destructive effects as well as benefits of laser into account, it remains unknown 
which  population  that  may  have  a  benefit  of  the  combination  treatment  and  how  the  combination  is 
best used.  
Risks 
Demonstrated risks 
Ranibizumab is given by IVT injections. The risks with such injections are characterised in the previous 
development  programme  including  patients  with  AMD  also  apply  to  DME.  The  risks  consist  mainly  of 
increased IOP that is, in most cases, non-serious, transient and can be managed. In addition, there are 
risks  for  intraocular  inflammation,  damage  to  intraocular  tissues  including  increased  risks  for  retinal 
tears and detachment as well as potentially sight-threatening endophthalmitis. Overall, the submitted 
studies indicate that the risks are fairly similar for patients with DME and no new adverse events were 
reported.  
With  regards  to  non-ocular  AEs,  as  in  the  AMD-population,  the  majority  were  mild  to  moderate  in 
severity  and  few  were  suspected  to  study  drug  and/or  ocular  injection.  The  most  important  adverse 
events  in  DME  patients  were  the  previously  identified  AEs  potentially  related  to  systemic  VEGF-
inhibition. Despite a significant co-morbidity associated with diabetes, the incidence of these AEs was 
low  and  not  higher  than  reported  for  AMD-patients,  nor  were  there  any  new  non-ocular  AEs  besides 
urinary  tract  infection.  Supportive  data  from  four  ongoing  studies  in  DME  have,  so  far,  also  not 
indicated any notable differences with regards to severe AEs compared to what is already known. 
One death was reported in RESOLVE and 7 in RESTORE. None were considered by the investigator to 
be  related  to  study  treatment.  However,  for  some  of  the  events,  a  relation  to  a  systemic  VEGF-
inhibition  cannot  be  excluded.  On  the  other  hand,  this  is  a  population  with  major  cardiovascular  co-
morbidities and, in the ongoing DME studies, the frequency of fatal events reported so far is similar to 
the one in the AMD-studies.  
Potential risks 
Overall,  ranibizumab  has  been  administered  to  312  patients  with  DME  (77  subjects  in  RESOLVE  and 
235  subjects  in  RESTORE)  which  is  limited.  Of  these,  120  have  received  the  combination  with  laser. 
Importantly,  there  appeared  to  be  no  additional  risks  in  subjects  with  significant  retinal  ischaemia. 
However, few subjects have been evaluated. There is also no, or limited, information on any potential 
risks for, amongst others, ATEs if treating subjects with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, uncontrolled 
disease, previous stroke or TIA. The experience in other ethnicities than Caucasians is also limited.  
On the other hand, there is additional support from the ongoing studies, from published studies as well 
as from patients with AMD and diabetes, although the latter population is likely to have a less severe 
disease. Even though the high incidence of elevated IOP and endophthalmitis observed in DME patients 
in  RESOLVE  was  not  supported  by  data  from  RESTORE  or  from  diabetic  patients  with  AMD,  available 
data  cannot  conclude  on  the  magnitude  of  these  ocular  risks,  bearing  in  mind  the  possibility  of  an 
increased  susceptibility  towards  infections  in  subjects  with  advanced  disease.  A  continued  monitoring 
of  these  risks  in  the  target  population  is  needed. In  addition,  potential  risks  regarding  progression  of 
EMA/13901/2011  
Page 29/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diabetic  retinopathy  and  macular  ischaemia  are  expected  to  be  further  addressed  in  the  ongoing  as 
well as planned studies. 
Another  uncertainty  is  the  long-term  risks  in  the  targeted  DME  population.  Including  the  elderly 
subjects  with  AMD  and  diabetes  adds  to  the  information  on  age-related  risk  factors  in  the  target 
population.  On  the  other  hand,  considering  that  the  general  DME  patient  with  the  diabetes  co-
morbidities is younger, additional number of years with IVT treatment may be expected. Further, very 
few elderly subjects with DME (and potentially more severe vascular disease) have been treated. The 
potential  long-term  risks  for  impairment  of  VA  due  to  halting  or  deferring  laser  photocoagulation  are 
also  not  known.  Although  the  longer-term  data  from  the  study  from  DRCRnet  (2-year  data  from  484 
patients  whereof  ~200  subjects  treated  with  Lucentis  laser  photocoagulation)  support  the  current 
safety  profile  of  ranibizumab  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  DME,  additional  long-term  safety  data 
are needed. Such data are to be generated in planned and ongoing studies. 
Given  the  IVT  route  of  administration,  a  limited  absorption  into  the  systemic  circulation  is  expected. 
Since subjects with DME have more permeable eyes compared to subjects with AMD, there may be an 
increased  systemic  exposure.  The  submitted  pharmacokinetic  data  in  this  population  is  limited,  but 
indicate that some subjects may have a slightly higher maximal plasma exposure level than previously 
reported in AMD-patients. Moreover, a slightly higher systemic exposure in subjects with DME cannot 
be  excluded.  Consequently,  there  may  be  an  increased  risk  in  subjects  with  DME,  especially  in 
cardiovascular  high  risk  patients.  The  risk  in  these  patients  will  be  further  addressed  in  the  post-
marketing study where subjects at risk (including previous cardio/cerebrovascular events, hypertension 
etc) will be enrolled. 
In  case of pregnancy during treatment with Lucentis, the information derived from the embryo-foetal 
study  in  monkeys  gives  assurance  since  no  foetal  adverse  effects  were  observed.  However,  the 
exposure margin in this study compared to a worst case clinical exposure is limited (0.9-7-fold). Since 
VEGF inhibition has a potential to adversely affect the embryo-foetal development, there is a potential 
risk for adverse effects during pregnancy.  
Benefit/Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treatment  with  ranibizumab  resulted  in  a  clinically  convincing  and  a  statistically  significant  mean 
improvement  of  VA  in  subjects  with  DME.  After  12  months  treatment,  the  difference  vs.  sham 
treatment was 11 letters vs. sham injection and 6 letters vs. laser photocoagulation, in the RESOLVE 
and  RESTORE  studies,  respectively.  An  important  proportion,  40-62%  and  23-36  %  gained    10  and 
15  letters  in  VA  in  the  two  studies.  An  increase  of  15  letters  may  translate  into  benefits  such  as 
driving and reading. 
Treatment is not without risks; however the risks, based on the submitted data, appear comparable to 
that previously identified in the AMD-population. Besides risks for the manageable increase in IOP and 
injection-related  damage  to  intraocular  tissues,  rare,  but  important  and  potentially  sight  threatening 
risks are those associated with retinal detachment and endophthalmitis. The most important potential, 
although not frequent, non-ocular risks in DME patients seem to be those that are previously identified 
in patients with AMD, i.e. risks that may be related to systemic VEGF-inhibition.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The natural progression of DME leads to vision loss of more than ≥ 10 letters of VA within 2 years in 
approximately  50%  of  patients.  The  only  treatment  and  current  standard  of  care  is  laser 
photocoagulation as it has been demonstrated to reduce the risk for severe decrease of VA (≥15 letters) 
with 50 % over 2-3 years. However, there is a substantial group of patients who are unresponsive to 
laser treatment and for whom no significant improvement in VA is to be expected. In comparison with 
laser  photocoagulation,  the  risk  profile  in  ranibizumab-treated  patients  is  very  different,  and  the 
immediate risk is estimated to be higher due to the IVT injection. However, laser photocoagulation is a 
destructive  treatment  and  there  is  an  important  risk  of  damaging  the  centre  of  the  macula,  creating 
scotomas, when the leaks to be treated are close to the macula. Moreover, in the long term, repeated 
photocoagulation  may  impair  peripheral  vision  since  large  parts  of  the  retina  will  eventually  be 
destroyed. 
Despite  the  safety  database  being  limited,  Ranibizumab-treatment  is  the  first  treatment  that  has 
shown  to  increase  VA  in  subjects  with  DME.  From  the  submitted  data,  the  magnitude  of  effect  is

considered to outweigh the risks, at least in the majority of subsets of the target population, since the 
strength of the efficacy data is convincing.  
2.9.1.  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  current  data  show  a  benefit  of  ranibizumab  as  monotherapy  that  is  considered  to  outweigh  the 
identified as well as the potential risks. 
The  subjects  in  the  safety  database  are  sufficient  to  ensure  that  there  is  a  95%  probability  that  a 
common  AE  in  this  population  has  been  detected  which  is  not  the  case  for  subjects  that  are  also 
treated with laser. Thus, the safety database is still rather limited and less than common AEs are not 
characterised  in  this  population.  Although  the  non-ocular  risk  profile  in  diabetic  subjects  treated  with 
ranibizumab appears reassuring, it cannot be excluded that the diabetes co-morbidity profile may put 
the  target  population  at  a  higher  risk.  In  addition,  compared  to  the  elderly  AMD-population,  diabetic 
patients are considerably younger and may be treated for several years. Even though long-term laser 
photocoagulations  results  in  retinal  scars  that  may  impair  vision,  the  potential  complications  after 
repeated long-term intravitreal injections are still not known. 
The current standard of care in DME is treatment with laser photocoagulation to reduce the risk for a 
future, severe loss of vision. In clinical practice, subjects with DME may not have a visual impairment, 
but  are  nevertheless  treated  with  laser  photocoagulation.  Treatment  with  ranibizumab  will  therefore 
introduce a new treatment paradigm, since only subjects with an impaired vision due to DME should be 
treated.  Consequently,  the  treatment  approach  would  be  to  treat  the  oedemas  with  laser 
photocoagulation and, when vision becomes impaired, start ranibizumab-treatment. This approach is in 
agreement  with  the  new  DME  indication,  the  proposed  re-treatment  criteria  and  supported  by  the 
submitted data.  
With  only  limited  support  for  efficacy  beyond  12  months,  (in  the  form  of  2-year  data  from  a 
publication),  it  is  not  known  whether  there  is  a  long-term  benefit  of  ranibizumab-treatment  (as 
established with laser) in subjects with oedema only. Therefore, the information to treat only the visual 
impairment  has  to  reach  the  physicians.  This  will  be  done  through  using  the  educational  material  as 
specified  in  section  2.3.  Although  a  large  proportion  of  the  retinal  specialists  are  familiar  with 
ranibizumab  treatment  in  AMD,  it  is  possible  that  a  new  subset  of  specialist  will  be  introduced  to 
treatment.  As  there  are  major  risks  if  the  injection  procedure  is  handled  incorrectly,  there  will  be  a 
need for a continuous education of physicians in this field and the educational programme for the AMD-
population has been further adapted. 
There is also only limited support for the safety of Lucentis beyond 12 months (again in the form of 2-
year data from a publication). Although reassuring, the long-term data in this condition is too limited. 
Together  with  this  arises  the  concern  related  to  uncertainty  if  the  12-months  gain  in  VA  due  to 
ranibizumab-treatment  will  result  in  a  loss  of  the  well  characterised  long-term  preservation  of  vision 
due to laser treatment if laser is halted or deferred. Consequently, there is a need for long-term data. 
Such  data  will  be  available  in  2012.  On  the  other  hand,  since  there  were  no  additional  treatment 
benefits  with  the  combination  of  ranibizumab  and  laser,  taking  the  destructive  effects  as  well  as  the 
previously characterised benefits of laser into account, it remains unknown whether there is population 
that  may  have  a  benefit  of  the  combination  treatment.  However,  this  will  be  further  explored  in  a 
planned additional study. 
Despite  some  limitations  of  the  safety  database,  in  view  of  the  supportive  data  from  ongoing  and 
published studies together with the experience from the AMD-population as well as the planned 5-year 
post  marketing  observational  efficacy  and  safety  study,  the  above-mentioned  uncertainties,  including 
those  related  to  the  lack  of  safety  data  after  long-term  treatment,  are  considered  possible  to  handle 
with post-authorisation commitments, additional updates of the SPC and the RMP.

2.9.2.  Risk management plan 
An  update  to  the  risk  management  plan  was  submitted.  The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data 
submitted,  was  of  the  opinion  that  Pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine 
pharmacovigilance  were  needed  to  investigate  further  some  of  the  safety  concerns.  The  CHMP 
endorsed  that  ongoing  routine  and  additional  risk  minimisation  measures  in  place  for  the  AMD 
indication are extended to include the DME-indication.  
2.10.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Lucentis in the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema 
(DME)  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  a  positive  opinion  to  the  type  II 
application to extend the indication for DME.

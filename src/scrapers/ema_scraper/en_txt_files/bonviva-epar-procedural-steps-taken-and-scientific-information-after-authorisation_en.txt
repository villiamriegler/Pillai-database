1 Notifications are issued for type I  variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II  va riation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristi cs, annex II,  labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope  of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC,  Annex 
The efficacy and safety profile of oral and IV 
II  and PL 
Bonviva for the Post Menopausal 
Osteoporosis indication is well established. It 
is supported by clinical development program 
trials and has been confirmed by subsequent 
studies (including retrospective analyses), 
literature reviews, and post-marketing 
surveillance data. Its adverse event profile is 
as expected for the bisphosphonate (BP) 
class. 
The safety profile of IV Bonviva administered 
every 3 months and of the 150-mg oral 
tablet administered monthly for PMO has 
been shown to be consistent with that of the 
2.5-mg oral formulation administered daily in 
the clinical development program with 
respect to potential risks. 
The safety of long-term BP therapy for the 
prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is 
less clear, owing to conflicting study results 
regarding its possible association with ONJ 
(osteonecrosis of the jaw),  atypical femoral 
Bonviva

fractures, or esophageal cancer. No cases of 
ONJ or atypical fracture were reported in the 
Bonviva trial program over 5 years of 
treatment. 
From review of the data on the use of 
Bonviva in the indication PMO the benefit risk 
balance remains positive for the use of 
Bonviva in the treatment of osteoporosis in 
postmenopausal women at increased risk of 
fracture. A reduction in the risk of vertebral 
fractures has been demonstrated, efficacy on 
femoral neck fractures has not been 
established. 
The CHMP recommends that the renewal be 
granted with unlimited validity.

reaction/shock as follows: 
- Bonviva 3 mg solution for injection (only):  Update of SmPC 
section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use ” of the 
SmPC  and of Package Leaflet section 2 to add a warning and 
precautions statement regarding anaphylactic reaction/shock. 
- Bonviva 150 mg film-coated tablets and 3 mg solution for 
injection:  Update of SmPC  section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” and 
of Package Leaflet section 4 to include safety informati on on 
anaphylactic reaction/shock. 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the following obligation has been 
fulfilled, and therefore recommends its deletion from the Annex 
II:  “The MAH should submit an updated Risk Management Plan 
reflecting “atypical femoral fractures” as potential risk. The Risk 
Management plan should be submitted by 6 October 2011.”  
In addition, the product information annexes were aligned with 
the latest version of the new QRD template (version 8.1) and the 
SmPC  guideline, and editorial corre ctions as well as  linguistic 
corrections (DK,EL,ES,LV,MT,NL,PL,PT,RO,SK,SL)  were 
implemented.  The MAH also took the opportunity to update the 
list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, 
Annex II,  Labelling and Package Leaflet.

(irrespective of reporter causality 
assessment) and all spontaneous reports of 
adverse events from countries where these 
drugs are marketed.  A literature search and 
search of the UK General Practice Research 
Database (GPRD)  was also performed. Based 
on analysis of all safety data generated, the 
MAH proposed to update sections 4.4 
“Special warnings and precautions for 
use”and 4.8 of  the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) with information on 
anaphylactic reaction/shock. In SmPC  section 
4.4 of the SmPC  of the presentations for 
intravenus administration a warning and 
precautions statement was added: Cases of 
anaphylactic reaction/shock, including fatal 
events, have been reported in patients 
treated with intravenous ibandronic acid. 
Appropriate medical support and monitoring 
measures should be readily available when 
intravenous injection is administered. If 
anaphylactic or other severe 
hypersensitivity/allergic reactions occur, 
immediately discontinue the injection and 
initiate appropriate treatment. In SmPC 
section 4.8 safety information was added to 
inform that cases of anaphylactic

reaction/shock, including fatal events, have 
been reported in patients treated with 
intravenous ibandronic acid. The Package 
leaflet was amended accordingly. 
The CHMP also accepted the proposed 
changes to annex II  of the product 
information, the changes to  align with the 
latest version of the new QRD  template 
(version 8.1) and the SmPC  guideline,  and 
editorial and  linguistic corre ctions.

In reproductive studies in rats by the oral 
route, ibandronic acid decreased fertility at 
high daily doses: increased preimplantation 
losses at dose levels ? 1mg/kg/day.  In 
reproductive studies in rats by the 
intravenous route, ibandronic acid decreased 
sperm counts at doses of 0.3 and 
1mg/kg/day and decreased fertility in males 
at 1mg/kg/day and in females at 1.2 
mg/kg/day. 
In addition, minor editorial changes in SPC,

The objective of this Type II  variation was to 
Leaflet 
update section 4.8 of the SPC  in order to 
bring it in line with the SPC  guideline, to 
simplify the text as per QRD comments and 
to change the MedDRA frequency categories 
for two adverse events. This was done i n 
response to a commitment given as a part of 
the renewal adopted in December 2008. 
In study BM16549, from year one to year 
two, the relationship of flatulence to the 
study medication has changed from possibly 
related to unrelated for one patient. The 
relationship of fatigue has also changed from 
possibly related to unrelated for one patient 
Both adverse events did not reach the 1% 
level at year 2 and have therefore been listed 
as uncommon. The Product information was 
revised to reflect this information.

SmPC,  Annex 
Based upon the data that have become 
II,  Labelling 
available since the granting of the initial 
and PL 
marketing authorisation, the benefit risk 
balance of Bonviva remains positive. 
However the safety profile of Bonviva is to be 
closely monitored due to the effects of 
Bisphosphonates as a class, which are 
currently being assessed by the CHMP. 
Considering the safety profile of Bonviva and 
the large number of patients currently 
enrolled in clinical and post marketing 
studies for the product as well as the ongoing 
post-marketing obligations and the continued 
reports of adverse events received by the 
MAH, the safety profile will continue to be 
monitored closely and updates will be 
provided regularly to the CHMP  through 1-
yearly PSURs. 
Based on the safety profile of Bonviva in the 
treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal 
women at increased risk of fracture and 
considering the requirement of one -yearly 
PSUR  submission, the CHMP  recommended 
one additional renewal for Bonviva.

Treatment of osteoporosis in post 
menopausal women at increased risk of 
fracture. (see section 5.1) 
A reduction in the risk of vertebra l fractures 
has been demonstrated, efficacy on femoral 
neck fractures has not been established.

below:

Independent risk factors, for example, low 
BMD, age, the existence of previous 
fractures, a family history of fractures, high 
bone turnover and low body mass index 
should be considered in order to identify 
women at increased risk of osteoporotic 
fractures.  
In the overall patient population of the study 
MF4411, no reduction was observed for non-
vertebral fractures, however daily 
ibandronate appeared to be effective in a 
high-risk subpopulation (femoral neck BMD 
T-score < -3.0),  where a non-vertebral 
fracture risk reduction of 69% was observed.

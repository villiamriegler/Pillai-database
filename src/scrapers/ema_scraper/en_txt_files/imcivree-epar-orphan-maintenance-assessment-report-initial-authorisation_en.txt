COMP opinion (adoption via written 
21 May 2021 
procedure) 
2.2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2018 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
The grounds for the COMP Opinion at the designation stage were as follows: 
“Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the 
following: 
• 
• 
• 
The intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing setmelanotide was 
considered justified based on early clinical data showing significant reductions in hunger score and 
body weight in patients. 
The condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to unrelenting hunger leading to 
morbid obesity and related comorbidities such as cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory and 
orthopaedic impairments. 
The condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 0.1 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
The sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment in the European 
Union for patients affected by the condition. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing setmelanotide as an orphan medicinal product for the 
orphan indication: treatment of leptin receptor deficiency.”

2.3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of marketing 
authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Congenital leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency is caused by bi-allelic mutations (either homozygous or 
compound heterozygous) in the LEPR gene that result in loss of function in the leptin receptor. The 
LEPR gene is located on chromosome 1p31.1 and encodes the leptin receptor, which is expressed on 
hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons responsible for producing mature melanocyte-
stimulating hormone (MSH) peptides from the POMC precursor peptide in the MC4 pathway (Lee 2009, 
Balthasar 2004). The LEPR is also expressed on other tissues and responds to leptin in reproductive 
and immune function regulation in addition to its central role in body weight regulation (Dalamaga 
2013, Myers 2009). 
The LEPR deficiency phenotype develops because POMC neurons are not activated based on the 
missing leptin signal mediated by the LEPR. The disease manifests itself by extreme early onset obesity 
and hyperphagia. 
The approved therapeutic indication “IMCIVREE is indicated in the treatment of obesity and the control 
of hunger associated with biallelic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), including PCSK1, deficiency obesity or 
leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency obesity in adults and children 6 years of age and above” falls within 
the scope of the two designated orphan conditions “Treatment of leptin receptor deficiency” in this 
designation and EU/3/16/1703 covering setmelanotide in the ‘treatment of pro-opiomelanocortin 
deficiency’. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP (see 
EPAR). 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Monogenic obesity disorders are characterised by onset in infancy and early childhood, marked 
hyperphagia apparent to parents and caregivers early in childhood development, and with continued 
excess hunger coupled with progressive and unrelenting body weight gain thereafter.  Given the strong 
genetic underpinnings in these forms of extreme obesity, it is not surprising that refractoriness to diet, 
exercise and existing medical / surgical therapeutic interventions is the norm. 
Beyond the hyperphagia, somatic conditions frequently associated with severe obesity include 
premature death, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and type 2 
diabetes mellitus, which have significant and well-documented cardiac, renal, and ophthalmic 
complications for children and young adults. 
Children and especially adolescents with extreme obesity experience increased mortality and 
morbidity, including cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory and orthopaedic complications (Norris 2011, 
Schwimmer 2003, Amin 2002, Karlson 2003) and global impairments in daily functioning (Zeller 2006). 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000040440 
Page 5/11 
 
 
 
 
 
In fact, several cases (at least 5 among the reported cases) of early mortality – most often as a 
consequence of respiratory and cardiovascular complications – have been reported among congenital 
LEPR-deficient patients. 
The condition remains chronically debilitating and life threatening. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of designation, the sponsor’s formal estimate of the prevalence of LEPR deficiency was 
approximately 0.1 per 10,000. This was based on two separate approaches to prevalence estimation: 
• 
Literature searching which revealed that fewer than 50 biallelic LEPR deficiency patients had been 
identified worldwide and estimated that there were 3,540 to 4,130 patients with some form of 
LEPR deficiency in the EU, equivalent to an overall prevalence of 0.07 to 0.08 per 10,000 people 
(Andiran 2011, Clement 1998, Chung 1997, Farooqi 2007, Gill 2014, Hannema 2016, Heo 2001, 
Huvenne 2015, Kimber 2008, LeBeyec 2013, Mammès 2001, Matsuoka 1997, Mazen 2011, 
Montague 1997, Saeed 2014, Saeed, 2015, Thompson 1997; Nordang, 2017; NCD Risk Factor 
Collaboration 2016; Ogden, 2016).  
• 
The prevalence of LEPR gene LOF alleles (Ayers, 2018), which led to an estimate of 0.12 per 
10,000.  
In addition to the literature and reports presented at the time of initial designation, the sponsor 
presented also a systematic review of LEPR deficiency including a prevalence estimate that has very 
recently been published (Kleinendorst et al, 2020). The authors noted that 88 patients with LEPR 
deficiency are reported in the worldwide literature (including 2 reported for the first time in this 
publication), of which 21 are European. Based on assumptions in conjunction with these data, a 
predicted European prevalence of 998 cases is derived. This corresponds to a prevalence of 1.34 per 
million (95% CI=0.95, 1.72) which can be expressed as 0.0134 per 10,000 (95% CI=0.0095, 0.0172). 
This prevalence estimate is somewhat lower than that presented at the time of designation and due to 
uncertainties around the point prevalence of LEPR deficiency, the value of 0.1 in 10,000 was adopted. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
At the time of designation, no drugs were approved in the EU for the treatment of obesity due to LEPR 
deficiency and no medicines have been authorised since then. 
Potential surgical approaches, such as gastric or intestinal bypass operations, were considered 
contraindicated because LEPR deficiency patients continue to experience extreme appetite and 
therefore overeat, even after surgery, often leading to anatomical complications. Medicines used in 
treatment of obesity do not address the issue of hyperphagia in these patients.   
There has been no change regarding the available therapeutic options since the designation date. The 
situation described above therefore remains current.

2.4.  COMP position adopted on 21 May 2021 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication includes the orphan condition of the designated Orphan 
Medicinal Product. The therapeutic indication is covered entirely by this and an additional orphan 
designation (EU/3/16/1703), which is covered by a separate opinion document.  
the prevalence of leptin receptor deficiency (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.1 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
The condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to unrelenting hunger leading to 
morbid obesity and related comorbidities such as cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory and 
orthopaedic impairments; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory method for the treatment of the condition that has been 
authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Imcivree, setmelanotide for 
treatment of leptin receptor deficiency (EU/3/18/2101) is not removed from the Community Register of 
Orphan Medicinal Products.

3.2.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2020 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
The grounds for the COMP Opinion at the designation stage were as follows: 
“Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the 
following:  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000040440 
Page 8/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  The intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing setmelanotide was 
considered justified based on clinical data demonstrating reduction of hunger score and 
significant weight loss in patients.  
•  The condition is life-threatening due to failure to thrive in infancy and secondary adrenal 
insufficiency and chronically debilitating due to morbid obesity and endocrinopathies.  
•  The condition was estimated to be affecting less than 0.1 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made.  
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled.  
The sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment that has 
been authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition.  
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled.  
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation 
(EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing setmelanotide as an orphan medicinal product for 
the orphan indication: treatment of pro-opiomelanocortin deficiency.”  
3.3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of marketing 
authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency is a rare genetic disorder in which neuropeptides synthesised 
and processed from the POMC gene are absent or deficient. The lack of POMC and/or its conversion to 
melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) abolishes signals these satiety and results in an unchecked 
stimulus to appetite which in turn leads to uncontrolled food intake and obesity. In patients with POMC 
deficiency neuropeptides synthesised and processed from the POMC gene can be absent or deficient 
due to defects in two genes: POMC gene itself or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) 
gene, which encodes the enzyme processing POMC into derivative MSH neuropeptides. 
In patients with PD the lack of POMC and/or its conversion to MSH abolishes these satiety signals and 
results in an unchecked stimulus to appetite which in turn leads to uncontrolled food intake and 
subsequent obesity. 
The approved therapeutic indication “IMCIVREE is indicated in the treatment of obesity and the control 
of hunger associated with biallelic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), including PCSK1, deficiency obesity or 
leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency obesity in adults and children 6 years of age and above” falls within 
the scope of the two designated orphan conditions “Treatment of pro-opiomelanocortin deficiency” in 
this designation and EU/3/18/2101 covering setmelanotide in ‘treatment of leptin receptor deficiency’. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000040440 
Page 9/11 
 
 
 
 
 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP (see 
EPAR). 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
POMC gene defect patients exhibit severe early-onset hyperphagia, obesity, cholestasis and congenital 
secondary adrenal insufficiency. They also typically have very fair skin in ethnic backgrounds that do 
not otherwise lead to darker skin pigmentation (Challis & Millington, 2015). If not treated with 
glucocorticoid therapy soon after birth, children can die due to adrenal insufficiency. Despite 
glucocorticoid replacement therapy, deficiencies in POMC-derived neuropeptides such as α/β-MSH are 
not easily remedied, and infants experience exponential feeding and weight gain. If light skinned, they 
must also remain protected from excessive sun exposure. Additionally, patients may exhibit other 
endocrine abnormalities, such as central hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, and 
hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism requiring appropriate hormone supplementation treatment (Challis 
& Millington, 2015). 
No medicines were authorised for the condition since the initial designation. The condition remains life 
threatening and chronically debilitating. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of designation, the sponsor’s formal estimate of the prevalence of POMC / PCSK1 deficiency 
was <0.1 per 10,000. This was based on literature searching which revealed that fewer than 50 POMC 
gene defect patients and ~25 PCSK1 gene defect patients had been identified worldwide (O’Rahilly et 
al, 1995; Jackson et al, 1997; Jackson et al, 2003; Farooqui et al, 2007; Martin et al, 2013; 
Wilschansnski et al, 2014; Challis & Millington, 2015).  
The sponsor performed an updated search and added 5 new case reports of POMC deficiency 
(Anisimova et al, 2017; Ozsu & Bahm, 2017 (2 cases); Cetinkaya et al, 2018; Hilado & Randhawa, 
2018) and 2 new case reports of PCSK1 deficiency (Härter et al, 2016; Pépin et al, 2019).  
Accordingly, the prevalence description can be updated to say that fewer than 60 POMC gene defect 
patients and fewer than 30 PCSK1 gene defect patients had been identified worldwide. In line with this, 
the formal estimate of the prevalence of POMC / PCSK1 deficiency remains at <0.1 per 10,000.  
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
At the time of designation, no drugs were approved in the EU for the treatment of obesity due to POMC 
and/or PCSK1 deficiency. 
Two products discussed in the original designation application had approved indications which included 
the term “obesity”. These products are not known to manage the excessive appetite in POMC and/or 
PCSK1 deficiency. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000040440 
Page 10/11 
 
 
 
 
 
Potential surgical approaches, such as gastric or intestinal bypass operations, were considered 
contraindicated because POMC / PCSK1 deficiency patients continue to experience extreme appetite 
and therefore overeat, even after surgery, often leading to anatomical complications.

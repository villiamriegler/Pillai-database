CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 50 mg of opicapone.  
Ontilyv should be taken once-daily at bedtime at least one hour before or after levodopa combinations. 
Dose adjustments of antiparkinsonian therapy 
Ontilyv is to be administered as an adjunct to levodopa treatment and enhances the effects of 
levodopa. Hence, it is often necessary to adjust levodopa dose by extending the dosing intervals and/or 
reducing the amount of levodopa per dose within the first days to first weeks after initiating the 
treatment with opicapone according to the clinical condition of the patient (see section 4.4).  
Missed dose 
If one dose is missed, the next dose should be taken as scheduled. The patient should not take an extra 
dose to make up for the missed dose.  
Special populations 
Elderly  
No dose adjustment is needed for elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Caution must be exercised in patients ≥ 85 years of age as there is limited experience in this age group. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment, as opicapone is not excreted by the 
kidney (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A).  
There is limited clinical experience in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class 
B). Caution must be exercised in these patients and dose adjustment may be necessary (see section 
5.2). 
There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), 
therefore, opicapone is not recommended in these patients (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Ontilyv in the paediatric population with Parkinson’s disease and motor 
fluctuations. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
The capsules should be swallowed whole with water. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Phaeochromocytoma, paraganglioma, or other catecholamine secreting neoplasms. 
History of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and/or non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis. 
Concomitant use with monoamine oxidase (MAO-A and MAO-B) inhibitors (e.g. phenelzine, 
tranylcypromine and moclobemide) other than those for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (see 
section 4.5).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Dose adjustments of antiparkinsonian therapy 
Ontilyv is to be administered as an adjunct to levodopa treatment. Hence, the precautions valid for 
levodopa treatment should also be taken into account for Ontilyv. Opicapone enhances the effects of 
levodopa. To reduce levodopa-related dopaminergic adverse reactions (e.g. dyskinesia, hallucinations, 
nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension), it is often necessary to adjust the daily dose of 
levodopa by extending the dosing intervals and/or reducing the amount of levodopa per dose within 
the first days to first weeks after initiating treatment with Ontilyv, according to the clinical condition 
of the patient (see section 4.2).  
If Ontilyv is discontinued it is necessary to adjust the dosing of the other antiparkinsonian treatments, 
especially levodopa, to achieve a sufficient level of control of the symptoms. 
Psychiatric disorders 
Patients and care-givers should be made aware that impulse control disorders including pathological 
gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating and 
compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other dopaminergic 
treatments. Patients should be monitored regularly for the development of impulse control disorders 
and review of treatment is recommended if such symptoms develop. 
Others 
Increases in liver enzymes were reported in studies with nitrocatechol inhibitors of catechol-O-
methyltransferase (COMT). For patients who experience progressive anorexia, asthenia and weight 
decrease within a relatively short period of time, a general medical evaluation including liver function 
should be considered. 
Excipients 
Ontilyv contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Ontilyv contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Monoamino oxidase (MAO) inhibitors 
Combination of opicapone and MAO inhibitors could result in inhibition of the majority of the 
pathways responsible for the metabolism of catecholamines. Because of this, concomitant use of 
opicapone with MAO inhibitors (e.g. phenelzine, tranylcypromine and moclobemide) other than those 
for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  
Concomitant use of opicapone and MAO inhibitors for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, e.g. 
rasagiline (up to 1 mg/day) and selegiline (up to 10 mg/day in oral formulation or 1.25 mg/day in 
buccal absorption formulation), is permissible.  
There is no experience with opicapone when used concomitantly with the MAO-B inhibitor 
safinamide. Therefore, their concomitant use should be considered with appropriate caution. 
Medicinal products metabolised by COMT 
Opicapone may interfere with the metabolism of medicinal products containing a catechol group that 
are metabolised by COMT, e.g. rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dopexamine or dobutamine, leading to potentiated effects of these medicinal products. Careful 
monitoring of patients being treated with these medicinal products is advised when opicapone is used.  
Tricyclic antidepressants and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors 
There is limited experience with opicapone when used concomitantly with tricyclic antidepressants 
and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors (e.g. venlafaxine, maprotiline and desipramine). Thus, their 
concomitant use should be considered with appropriate caution. 
Quinidine 
A study conducted in healthy volunteers showed that when a single dose of 50 mg opicapone was co-
administered (within 1 hour) with a single dose of quinidine (600 mg), systemic exposure of 
opicapone decreased by 37% (AUC0-tlast). Thus, particular consideration should be given to cases 
where quinidine needs to be administered together with opicapone as their co-administration should be 
avoided.  
CYP2C8 and OATP1B1 substrates 
Opicapone is a weak in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C8 and OATP1B1, whereas repaglinide is a sensitive 
CYP2C8 and OATP1B1 substrate. A study conducted in healthy subjects showed that there were no 
changes in repaglinide’s exposure when repaglinide was administered following multiple once-daily 
administration of opicapone 50 mg. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of opicapone in pregnant women. Opicapone 
crossed the placenta in rats. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see 
section 5.3). Ontilyv is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential 
not using contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
Opicapone levels in the milk of lactating rats were equivalent to those in plasma. It is unknown 
whether opicapone or its metabolites are excreted into human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants 
cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Ontilyv.  
Fertility 
The effects of opicapone on fertility in humans have not been studied. Animal studies with opicapone 
do not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Opicapone in association with levodopa may have major influence on the ability to drive and use 
machines. Opicapone may, together with levodopa, cause dizziness, symptomatic orthostatism and 
somnolence. Therefore, caution should be exercised when driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions reported were nervous system disorders. Dyskinesia was the most 
frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reaction (17.7%).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-parkinson drugs, other dopaminergic agents, ATC code: N04BX04 
Mechanism of action 
Opicapone is a peripheral, selective and reversible catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor 
endowed with a high binding affinity (sub-picomolar) that translates into a slow complex dissociation 
rate constant and a long duration of action (>24 hours) in vivo.  
In the presence of a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI), COMT becomes the major metabolising 
enzyme for levodopa, catalysing its conversion to 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) in the brain and 
periphery. In patients taking levodopa and a peripheral DDCI, such as carbidopa or benserazide, 
opicapone increases levodopa plasma levels thereby improving the clinical response to levodopa. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Opicapone showed a marked (>90%) and long-lasting (>24 hours) COMT inhibition in healthy 
subjects after administration of 50 mg opicapone.  
At steady state, 50 mg opicapone significantly increased the extent of levodopa systemic exposure 
approximately 2 fold compared to placebo following a single oral administration of either 100/25 mg 
levodopa/carbidopa or 100/25 mg levodopa/benserazide administered 12 h after the opicapone dose.  
Clinical efficacy and safety  
The efficacy and safety of opicapone has been demonstrated in two Phase 3 double-blind, placebo and 
active (Study 1 only) controlled studies in 1,027 randomized adult patients with Parkinson’s disease 
treated with levodopa/DDCI (alone or in combination with other antiparkinsonian medicinal products) 
and end-of-dose motor fluctuations for up to 15 weeks. At screening, the mean age was similar in all 
treatment groups in both studies, ranging between 61.5 and 65.3 years. Patients had disease severity 
stages 1 to 3 (modified Hoehn and Yahr) at ON, were treated with 3 to 8 daily doses of 
levodopa/DDCI and had a daily average OFF-time of at least 1.5 hours. In both studies, 783 patients 
were treated with 25 mg or 50 mg of opicapone or placebo. In Study 1, 122 patients were treated with 
5 mg of opicapone and 122 patients were treated with 200 mg of entacapone (active comparator). The 
majority of patients treated in both pivotal studies were treated with immediate-release 
levodopa/DDCI. There were 60 patients in the combined Phase 3 studies who were predominantly 
using controlled-release levodopa (i.e. >50% of their levodopa/DDCI formulations), 48 of whom were 
treated solely with controlled-release formulations of levodopa. Although there is no evidence that 
either the efficacy or safety of opicapone would be affected by use of controlled-release levodopa 
preparations, the experience with such preparations is limited. 
Opicapone demonstrated clinical efficacy superior to placebo during the double-blind treatment, both 
for the primary efficacy variable used in both pivotal studies, i.e. reduction in OFF-time (Table 2), the 
proportion of OFF-time responders (i.e. a subject who had a reduction in OFF-time of at least 1 hour 
from baseline to endpoint) (Table 3) and for most diary-derived secondary endpoints.  
The LS mean reduction in absolute OFF-time from baseline to endpoint in the entacapone group 
was -78.7 minutes. The difference in LS mean change in OFF-time of entacapone to placebo in 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study 1 was -30.5 minutes. The difference in LS mean change in OFF-time of opicapone 50 mg to 
entacapone was -24.8 minutes and non-inferiority of opicapone 50 mg to entacapone was 
demonstrated (95% confidence interval: -61.4, 11.8).

Note: A responder was a patient who had a reduction of at least 1 hour in absolute OFF-time (OFF-time 
responder) 
The results of the open-label (OL) extension studies of 1 year duration in 862 patients who continued 
treatment from the double-blind studies (Study 1-OL and Study 2-OL) indicated maintenance of the 
effect achieved during DB study periods. In the OL studies, all patients began at a dose of 25 mg 
opicapone for the first week (7 days), regardless of their prior treatment in the double-blind period. If 
end-of-dose motor fluctuations were not sufficiently controlled and tolerability allowed, the opicapone 
dose could be increased to 50 mg. If unacceptable dopaminergic adverse events were seen, the 
levodopa dose was to be adjusted. If not sufficient to manage the adverse events, the opicapone dose 
could then be down titrated. For other adverse events, the levodopa and/or opicapone dose could be 
adjusted. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
opicapone in all subsets of the paediatric population with Parkinson’s disease and motor fluctuations 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption  
Opicapone presents a low absorption (~20%). Pharmacokinetic results showed that opicapone is 
rapidly absorbed, with a tmax of 1.0 h to 2.5 h following once-daily multiple-dose administration up to 
50 mg opicapone.  
Distribution 
In vitro studies over the opicapone concentration range 0.3 to 30 mcg/mL showed that binding of 
14C-opicapone to human plasma proteins is high (99.9%) and concentration-independent. The binding 
of 14C-opicapone to plasma proteins was unaffected by the presence of warfarin, diazepam, digoxin 
and tolbutamide, and the binding of 14C-warfarin, 2-14C-diazepam, 3H-digoxin and 14C-tolbutamide 
was unaffected by the presence of opicapone and opicapone sulphate, the major human metabolite. 
After oral administration, the apparent volume of distribution of opicapone at a dose of 50 mg was 
29 L with an inter-subject variability of 36%. 
Biotransformation 
Sulphation of opicapone appears to be the major metabolic pathway in humans, yielding the inactive 
opicapone sulphate metabolite. Other metabolic pathways include glucuronidation, methylation and 
reduction.  
The most abundant peaks in plasma after a single-dose of 100 mg 14C-opicapone are metabolites BIA 
9-1103 (sulphate) and BIA 9-1104 (methylated), 67.1 and 20.5% of radioactive AUC respectively. 
Other metabolites were not found in quantifiable concentrations in the majority of plasma samples 
collected during a clinical mass balance study.  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The reduced metabolite of opicapone (found to be active in non-clinical studies) is a minor metabolite 
in human plasma and represented less than 10% of total systemic exposure to opicapone. 
In in vitro studies in human hepatic microsomes, minor inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 was 
observed. All reductions in activity essentially occurred at the highest concentration of opicapone 
(10 mcg/mL).  
An in vitro study showed opicapone inhibited CYP2C8 activity. A single dose study with opicapone 
25 mg showed an average increase of 30 % in the rate, but not the extent, of exposure to repaglinide (a 
CYP2C8 substrate), when the two drugs were co-administered. A second study conducted showed 
that, at steady state, opicapone 50 mg had no effect on repaglinide systemic exposure.  
Opicapone reduced CYP2C9 activity through competitive / mixed type mode of inhibition. However, 
clinical interaction studies conducted with warfarin showed no effect of opicapone on the 
pharmacodynamics of warfarin, a substrate of CYP2C9. 
Elimination 
In healthy subjects, the opicapone elimination half-life (t1/2) was 0.7 h to 3.2 h following once-daily 
multiple-dose administration up to 50 mg opicapone. 
Following once-daily multiple oral doses of opicapone in the dose range of 5 to 50 mg, opicapone 
sulphate presented a long terminal phase with elimination half-life values ranging from 94 h to 122 h 
and, as a consequence of this long terminal elimination half-life, opicapone sulphate presented a high 
accumulation ratio in plasma, with values close of up to 6.6. 
After oral administration, the apparent total body clearance of opicapone at a dose of 50 mg was 
22 L/h, with an inter-subject variability of 45%. 
Following administration of a single oral dose of 14C-opicapone, the main excretion route of opicapone 
and its metabolites was faeces, accounting for 58.5% to 76.8% of the administered radioactivity (mean 
67.2%). The remainder of the radioactivity was excreted in urine (mean 12.8%) and via expired air 
(mean 15.9%). In urine, the primary metabolite was the glucuronide metabolite of opicapone, while 
parent drug and other metabolites were generally below the limit of quantification. Overall, it can be 
concluded that the kidney is not the primary route of excretion. Therefore, it can be presumed that 
opicapone and its metabolites are mainly excreted in the faeces. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Opicapone exposure increased in a dose proportional manner following once-daily multiple dose 
administration up to 50 mg opicapone. 
Transporters 
Effect of transporters on opicapone 
In vitro studies have shown that opicapone is not transported by OATP1B1, but is transported by 
OATP1B3, and efflux transported by P-gp and BCRP. BIA 9-1103, its major metabolite, was 
transported by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and efflux transported by BCRP, but is not a substrate for 
the P-gp/MDR1 efflux transporter. 
Effect of opicapone on transporters 
At clinically relevant concentrations, opicapone is not expected to inhibit OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, BCRP, P-gp/MDR1, BSEP, MATE1 and MATE2-K transporters as 
suggested by in vitro and in vivo studies. 
Elderly (≥ 65 years old) 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pharmacokinetics of opicapone was evaluated in elderly subjects (aged 65-78 years old) after 7-
day multiple-dose administration of 30 mg. An increase in both the rate and extent of systemic 
exposure was observed for the elderly population when compared to the young population. The S-
COMT activity inhibition was significantly increased in elderly subjects. The magnitude of this effect 
is not considered to be of clinical relevance.  
Weight 
There is no relationship between exposure of opicapone and body weight over the range of 40-100 kg. 
Hepatic impairment 
There is limited clinical experience in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class 
B). The pharmacokinetics of opicapone was evaluated in healthy subjects and moderate chronic 
hepatic impaired patients after administration of a single-dose of 50 mg. The bioavailability of 
opicapone was significantly higher in patients with moderate chronic hepatic impairment and no safety 
concerns were observed. However, as opicapone is to be used as adjunctive levodopa-therapy, dose 
adjustments may be considered based on a potentially enhanced levodopa dopaminergic response and 
associated tolerability. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh Class C) (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of opicapone was not directly evaluated in subjects with chronic renal 
impairment. However, an evaluation with 50 mg opicapone was performed in subjects included in 
both phase 3 studies with GFR/1.73 m2 <60 mL/min (i.e. moderately decreased renal elimination 
capacity), and using pooled BIA 9-1103 data (major metabolite of opicapone). BIA 9-1103 plasma 
levels were not affected in patients with chronic renal impairment, and as such, no dose adjustment 
needs to be considered. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential.  
In rats, opicapone did not affect male and female fertility or prenatal development at exposure levels 
22 times the therapeutic exposure in humans. In pregnant rabbits, opicapone was less well tolerated 
resulting in maximum systemic exposure levels around or below the therapeutic range. Although 
embryo-foetal development was not negatively influenced in rabbits, the study is not considered 
predictive for human risk assessment.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Ontilyv is and what it is used for 
Ontilyv contains the active substance opicapone. It is used to treat Parkinson’s disease and associated 
movement problems. Parkinson's disease is a progressive disease of the nervous system that causes 
shaking and affects your movement. 
Ontilyv is for use in adults who are already taking medicines containing levodopa and DOPA 
decarboxylase inhibitors. It increases the effects of levodopa and helps to relieve the symptoms of 
Parkinson’s disease and movement problems.  
2.  What you need to know before you take Ontilyv 
Do not take Ontilyv: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to opicapone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6); 
if you have a tumour of the adrenal gland (known as phaeochromocytoma), or of the nervous 
system (known as paraganglioma), or any other tumour which increase the risk of severe high 
blood pressure; 
if you have ever suffered from neuroleptic malignant syndrome which is a rare reaction to 
antipsychotic medicines; 
if you have ever suffered from a rare muscle disorder called rhabdomyolysis which was not 
caused by injury; 
if you are taking certain antidepressants called monoamine-oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (e.g. 
phenelzine, tranylcypromine or moclobemide). Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you can take 
your antidepressant together with Ontilyv. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ontilyv: 
- 
if you have severe liver problems and suffered from loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, or 
exhaustion within a short period of time. Your doctor may need to reconsider your treatment. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you or your family/carer notices you are developing urges or 
cravings to behave in ways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or 
temptation to carry out certain activities that could harm you or others. These behaviours are called 
‘impulse control disorders’ and can include: addictive gambling, an abnormally high sex drive or an 
increased preoccupation with sexual thoughts or feelings. Behaviours such as these have been reported 
in patients using other medicines for Parkinsons´s disease.  
Your doctor may need to review your treatments. 
Children and adolescents 
Children and adolescents under the age of 18 years must not take this medicine. It has not been studied 
in these age groups since treatment of Parkinson’s disease is not relevant in children and adolescents.   
Other medicines and Ontilyv 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  
Tell your doctor if you are taking:  
- 
medicines for depression or anxiety such as venlafaxine, maprotiline and desipramine. Taking 
Ontilyv with these medicines may increase the risk of side effects. Your doctor may need to 
adjust your treatment; 
safinamide used for Parkinson’s disease. There is no experience taking Ontilyv and safinamide 
together. Your doctor may need to adjust your treatment; 
medicines to treat asthma such as rimiterole or isoprenaline. Ontilyv may increase their effect; 
medicines used to treat allergic reactions such as adrenaline. Ontilyv may increase their effect; 
medicines used to treat heart failure such as dobutamine, dopamine or dopexamine. Ontilyv may 
increase their effects; 
medicines for high cholesterol such as rosuvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin or pravastatin 
Ontilyv may increase their effects;  
medicines that affect the immune system such as methotrexate. Ontilyv may increase its effect; 
medicines containing quinidine, a medicine used to treat abnormal heart rhythms or malaria. 
Taking Ontilyv and quinidine together, i.e. at the same time, may decrease the effect of Ontilyv.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Ontilyv is not recommended if you are pregnant. You should use effective contraception if you might 
become pregnant. 
It is not known if Ontilyv passes into breast milk in humans. Since the risk to the baby/infant cannot 
be excluded, you should stop breast-feeding during treatment with Ontilyv.  
Driving and using machines 
Ontilyv taken with levodopa may make you feel light-headed, dizzy, or sleepy. 
Do not drive or operate machinery if you experience any of these side effects. 
Ontilyv contains lactose and sodium 
- Lactose: If you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to some sugars, contact your 
doctor before taking this medicine. 
- Sodium: This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take Ontilyv 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure.  
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended dose is 50 mg once daily. 
Ontilyv should be taken preferably at bedtime. 
Take Ontilyv at least one hour before or after taking your levodopa medicine. 
Doses of other medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease 
The dose of other medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease may need to be adjusted when you start 
taking Ontilyv. Follow the instructions that your doctor has given you. 
Method of administration 
Ontilyv is for oral use. 
Swallow the capsule whole with a glass of water.  
If you take more Ontilyv than you should 
If you take more Ontilyv than you should, tell your doctor or pharmacist, or go to a hospital 
immediately. Take the medicine package and this leaflet with you. This will help the doctor identify 
what you have taken. 
If you forget to take Ontilyv 
If you forget to take one dose, you should continue the treatment and take the next dose as scheduled.  
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop taking Ontilyv 
Do not stop taking Ontilyv unless your doctor tells you to as your symptoms may get worse. 
If you stop taking Ontilyv your doctor may need to adjust the dose of other medicines that you are 
taking to treat Parkinson’s disease. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Side effects caused by Ontilyv are usually mild to moderate and occur mostly within the first weeks of 
treatment. Some side effects may be caused by the increased effects of using Ontilyv together with 
levodopa. 
Contact your doctor straight away if you experience any side effects at the start of treatment. Many of 
the side effects can be managed by your doctor adjusting your levodopa medicine. 
Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any of the following side effects:

1.  What Ontilyv is and what it is used for 
Ontilyv contains the active substance opicapone. It is used to treat Parkinson’s disease and associated 
movement problems. Parkinson's disease is a progressive disease of the nervous system that causes 
shaking and affects your movement. 
Ontilyv is for use in adults who are already taking medicines containing levodopa and DOPA 
decarboxylase inhibitors. It increases the effects of levodopa and helps to relieve the symptoms of 
Parkinson’s disease and movement problems.  
2.  What you need to know before you take Ontilyv 
Do not take Ontilyv: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to opicapone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6); 
if you have a tumour of the adrenal gland (known as phaeochromocytoma), or of the nervous 
system (known as paraganglioma), or any other tumour which increase the risk of severe high 
blood pressure; 
if you have ever suffered from neuroleptic malignant syndrome which is a rare reaction to 
antipsychotic medicines; 
if you have ever suffered from a rare muscle disorder called rhabdomyolysis which was not 
caused by injury; 
if you are taking certain antidepressants called monoamine-oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (e.g. 
phenelzine, tranylcypromine or moclobemide). Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you can take 
your antidepressant together with Ontilyv. 
Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you or your family/carer notices you are developing urges or 
cravings to behave in ways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or 
temptation to carry out certain activities that could harm you or others. These behaviours are called 
‘impulse control disorders’ and can include: addictive gambling, an abnormally high sex drive or an 
increased preoccupation with sexual thoughts or feelings. Behaviours such as these have been reported 
in patients using other medicines for Parkinsons´s disease.  
Your doctor may need to review your treatments. 
Children and adolescents 
Children and adolescents under the age of 18 years must not take this medicine. It has not been studied 
in these age groups since treatment of Parkinson’s disease is not relevant in children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Ontilyv

medicines.  
Tell your doctor if you are taking:

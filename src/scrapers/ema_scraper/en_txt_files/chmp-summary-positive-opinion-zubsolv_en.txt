Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Zubsolv 
buprenorphine / naloxone 
On 14 September 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Zubsolv, 
intended for the treatment of opioid dependence. The applicant for this medicinal product is Mundipharma 
Corporation Limited. 
Zubsolv contains the active substances buprenorphine and naloxone and will be available as tablets for 
sublingual use (0.7 mg / 0.18 mg, 1.4 mg / 0.36 mg, 2.9 mg / 0.71 mg, 5.7 mg / 1.4 mg, 8.6 mg / 2.1 
mg and 11.4 mg / 2.9 mg). Buprenorphine and naloxone are used in addictive disorders (ATC code: 
N07BC51) and act as opioid agonist and opioid receptor antagonist, respectively.   
The benefit of Zubsolv is substitution of opioids during addiction treatment.   The most common side 
effects are constipation, nausea, insomnia and headache.  
The full indication is: "Substitution treatment for opioid drug dependence, within a framework of medical, 
social and psychological treatment. The intention of the naloxone component is to deter intravenous 
misuse. Treatment is intended for use in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age who have agreed to 
be treated for addiction." 
It is proposed that Zubsolv be prescribed by physicians experienced in the treatment of opioid 
dependence.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

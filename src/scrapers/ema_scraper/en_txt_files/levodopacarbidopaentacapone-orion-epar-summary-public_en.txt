EPAR summary for the public 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion 
levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone 
This is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR) for 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion. It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (CHMP) assessed the medicine to reach its opinion in favour of granting a marketing 
authorisation and its recommendations on the conditions of use for Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone 
Orion. 
What is Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion? 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is a medicine that contains three active substances: levodopa, 
carbidopa and entacapone. It is available as a range of tablets in seven strengths, containing 50 to 
200 mg levodopa and 12.5 to 50 mg carbidopa. All of the tablets contain 200 mg entacapone. 
What is Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion used for? 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is used to treat adults with Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s 
disease is a progressive brain disorder that causes shaking, slow movement and muscle stiffness. 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is used in patients who are being treated with a combination of 
levodopa and an inhibitor of dopa decarboxylase (two standard treatments for Parkinson’s disease) but 
are having ‘fluctuations’ towards the end of the period between two doses of their medication. 
Fluctuations happen when the effects of the medication wear off and symptoms re-emerge. They are 
linked with a reduction in the effect of levodopa, when the patient experiences sudden switches 
between being ‘on’ and able to move, and being ‘off’ and having difficulty moving about. 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is used when these fluctuations cannot be treated with the 
standard combination alone.

The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.  
How is Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion used? 
Each Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion tablet contains one complete dose of levodopa, in seven 
strengths, with corresponding amounts of carbidopa and entacapone to improve its effectiveness. The 
strength of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion that the patient should use is based on the amount 
of levodopa they need to control their symptoms. See the summary of product characteristics (also 
part of the EPAR) for full instructions on how patients should be switched to 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion, and on how the dose is adjusted during treatment. 
The maximum daily dose of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is 10 tablets, except for the tablets 
containing 175 mg levodopa and 43.75 mg carbidopa, for which the maximum daily dose is eight 
tablets, and those containing 200 mg levodopa and 50 mg carbidopa, for which it is seven tablets. 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion tablets should be taken whole, with or without food. They 
should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderately reduced liver function or severely 
reduced kidney function. They should not be used in patients with severe liver problems. 
How does Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion work? 
In patients with Parkinson’s disease, the cells in the brain that produce dopamine (a substance used to 
transmit signals between nerve cells that help to control muscle movement) begin to die and the 
amount of dopamine in the brain decreases. The patients then lose their ability to control their 
movements reliably. All of the active substances in Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion work to 
restore the levels of dopamine in the parts of the brain that control movement and co-ordination. 
Levodopa is converted into dopamine in the brain. Both carbidopa and entacapone block some of the 
enzymes that are involved in the breakdown of levodopa in the body: carbidopa blocks the enzyme 
dopa decarboxylase, and entacapone blocks the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT). As a 
result, levodopa remains active for longer. This helps to improve the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, 
such as stiffness and slowness of movement. Entacapone has been authorised in the European Union 
(EU) as Comtess/Comtan since 1998. The use of combinations of levodopa and carbidopa is well 
established, having been in use since the mid-1970s. Having all three substances in the same tablet 
can lower the number of tablets the patients have to take and help them stick to treatment. 
How has Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion been studied? 
The company used some of the data from Comtess/Comtan to support the use of 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion and presented data from the published literature for levodopa 
and carbidopa. 
The company carried out ‘bioequivalence’ studies to show that taking Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone 
Orion produces the same levels of levodopa, carbidopa and entecapone in the blood as taking separate 
tablets containing entacapone and the combination of levodopa and carbidopa.  
What benefit has Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion shown during the 
studies? 
The studies showed that Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is bioequivalent to the separate 
tablets.

What is the risk associated with Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion? 
The most common side effects with Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion (seen in more than 1 
patient in 10) are dyskinesia (uncontrollable movements), muscle pain, diarrhoea and nausea (feeling 
sick) and harmless urine discoloration. Serious side effects which have been reported much less often 
include gastrointestinal haemorrhage (bleeding in the gut) and angioedema (swelling under the skin of 
face or limbs). For the full list of all side effects reported with Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion, 
see the package leaflet. 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion must not be used in people who are hypersensitive (allergic) to 
levodopa, carbidopa, entacapone or any of the other ingredients. Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone 
Orion must not be used in patients with: 
• 
severely reduced liver function; 
•  narrow-angle glaucoma (increased pressure within the eye); 
• 
• 
phaeochromocytoma (a tumour of the adrenal gland); 
a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a dangerous nervous system disorder usually caused 
by antipsychotic medicines) or rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle fibres). 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion must not be used together with other medicines that belong to 
the group ‘monoamine oxidase inhibitors’ (a type of antidepressant). See the summary of product 
characteristics (also part of the EPAR) for full details.  
Why has Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion been approved? 
The CHMP decided that Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion’s benefits are greater than its risks and 
recommended that it be given marketing authorisation. 
Other information about Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for omalizumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
Cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in relation to Xolair treatment, including two cases with 
positive dechallenge and one case with positive dechallenge /rechallenged, were reported. Although in the 
majority of cases the information was too limited to allow a causality assessment, confounding factors 
such as pre-existing lupus, including potential incipient SLE, were present in many of the remaining cases 
and the pathogenesis of SLE/drug-induced lupus is still poorly understood and probably multifactorial, it 
does not appear unreasonable that Xolair, a drug that forms immune complexes with IgE with the 
potential to induce immune complex injury and for which events such as serum sickness have been rarely 
reported, could play a role in the pathogenesis of SLE/drug-induced lupus. After a thorough assessment 
of the available data, there appears to be reasonable support for the possibility of a causal relationship 
between Xolair and systemic lupus erythematosus. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information of medicinal products containing omalizumab were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for omalizumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing omalizumab is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

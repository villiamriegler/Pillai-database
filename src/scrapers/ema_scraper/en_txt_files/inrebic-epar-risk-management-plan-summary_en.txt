PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR INREBIC 
(FEDRATINIB) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for INREBIC. The RMP details 
important risks of INREBIC, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about INREBIC’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
INREBIC’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how INREBIC should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for INREBIC should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of INREBIC’s 
RMP. 
I. The Medicine and what it is Used for 
INREBIC is authorised for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult 
patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis (post-PV 
MF) or post essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis who are Janus Associated Kinase (JAK) 
inhibitor naïve, or have been treated with ruxolitinib. 
See SmPC for the full indication. It contains fedratinib as the active substance and it is given by 
the oral route.  
Further information about the evaluation of INREBIC’s benefits can be found in INREBIC’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/inrebic. 
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of INREBIC, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about INREBIC’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions and advice on correct use, in the 
PL and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including periodic safety update report assessment, so that immediate action 
can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of INREBIC is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of INREBIC are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of INREBIC. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine); 
Important identified and potential risks, together with missing information, are summarised in 
Table 1. 
Table 1: 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important Identified Risks: 
  Anaemia 
  Thrombocytopenia/bleeding 
  Encephalopathy, including Wernicke’s  
  Gastrointestinal toxicities (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting) 
Important Potential Risks: 
  Pancreatitis 
  Severe hepatotoxicity 
  Severe infections including viral reactivation 
Missing Information: 
  Use in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
  Long-term safety, including secondary malignancies 
II.B. Summary of Important Risks 
Table 2: 
Anaemia 
Important Identified Risk: Anaemia 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Grade 3 or 4 anaemia frequently leads to the need for red blood cell (RBC) 
transfusions including RBC transfusion dependence. In PMF, anaemia and the need 
for RBC transfusions is associated with a shorter overall survival and shorter 
leukaemia-free survival (Pardanani and Tefferi, 2011). Given the prognostic 
implications and the observation of Grade 3 anaemia as a very common adverse 
reaction in patients treated with fedratinib, this risk is considered an important 
identified risk.

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Patients with baseline haemoglobin < 10 g/dL are more likely to develop severe 
anaemia. The median time to first onset of Grade 3 anaemia event was approximately 
45 days with 75% of cases occurring within 3 months of starting treatment. Patients 
with underlying renal disease may be at an increased risk of anaemia. In patients with 
myelofibrosis (MF), anaemia may occur as part of the primary disease and patients 
may be transfusion dependent at the start of the study. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Sections 4.2 and 4.4 and PL Section 2 – warnings, advice and management of 
anaemia discussed. 
SmPC Section 4.8 and PL Section 4 – details of events and anaemia listed as a very

Risk minimisation 
measures 
While Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was similar in fedratinib-treated patients and 
patients receiving placebo in the randomised controlled Phase 3 study in the JAK 
inhibitor naïve setting, the rate of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was higher in MF 
patients previously treated with ruxolitinib. These previously exposed patients fulfil an 
area of high unmet medical need and it is expected that fedratinib will be primarily 
utilised in this setting. As thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding events, 
thrombocytopenia is considered an important identified risk of fedratinib. 
Patients with baseline platelets < 100 × 109/L are more likely to develop severe 
thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia generally occurs within the first 3 months of 
treatment, then stabilises. Previous chemotherapies including ruxolitinib and severity 
of the underlying disease are also an important contributor to thrombocytopenia and 
subsequent bleeding risks. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Sections 4.2 and 4.4 and PL Section 2 – warnings, advice and management of 
thrombocytopenia discussed. 
SmPC Section 4.8 and PL Section 4 – details of events and thrombocytopenia listed as 
a very common ADR.

Encephalopathy, Including Wernicke’s 
Important Identified Risk: Encephalopathy, Including Wernicke’s  
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Due to the limited understanding of the causal association of fedratinib with this risk 
based on the fact that fedratinib does not interfere with thiamine receptors and that 
Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE) can be fatal if not recognised and treated properly, 
the risk of encephalopathy, including Wernicke’s is considered an important identified 
risk. 
To evaluate any possible association between concerns of encephalopathy, including 
Wernicke’s in fedratinib-treated patients, the fedratinib clinical database of 
608 patients receiving continuous daily doses of fedratinib for MPNs or solid tumours 
was searched for reports of encephalopathy of any type, including Wernicke’s, and 
any signs or symptoms (eg, mental status changes, ophthalmoplegia (eg, nystagmus, 
diplopia) and cerebellar findings) that could be suggestive of thiamine deficiency or 
encephalopathy, including Wernicke’s. 
Eight fedratinib-treated patients with neurological signs or symptoms suggesting the 
potential diagnosis of encephalopathy, including Wernicke’s, were identified. Only 
one patient had thiamine levels evaluated at the time of symptoms and it was normal. 
These patients’ case histories and neuro-imaging data were reviewed by five 
independent experts. Based on the experts’ reviews, all agreed that one patient was 
identified as having WE. One patient was identified as not having WE, but rather 
hepatic encephalopathy. For the remaining six patients, there was no consensus among 
the experts. Therefore, taken conservatively, at most seven cases of WE occurred in 
over 600 fedratinib-treated patients.  
Four common and distinct (but overlapping) presentations of encephalopathies the 
physician is likely to encounter in clinical practice are: encephalopathy from 
metabolic disorder or deficiency, encephalopathy due to a severe systemic illness or 
organ failure, encephalopathy due to medication-related toxicity, and 
encephalopathies diagnosed primarily by findings on brain imaging. 
For WE, specifically, conditions associated with thiamine deficiency and subsequent 
development of WE include chronic alcoholism, hyperemesis, malabsorption, poor 
dietary intake, increased loss of thiamine by the kidneys (eg, in diabetes or renal 
disease), or an increased metabolic requirement of thiamine (Isenberg-Grzeda, 2016). 
Myelofibrosis patients may be malnourished due to splenomegaly causing a feeling of 
fullness or loss of appetite. In addition, fedratinib is very commonly associated with 
gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. 
Inadequate treatment of these GI AEs, especially in the thiamine setting of underlying 
malnutrition, may predispose to thiamine deficiency and thus WE.

Gastrointestinal Toxicities (Diarrhoea, Nausea, Vomiting) 
Important Identified Risk: Gastrointestinal Toxicities (Diarrhoea, Nausea, Vomiting) 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Diarrhoea (62.6%), nausea (58.6%) and vomiting (39.4%) were the most common 
nonhaematologic TEAEs (all grades) in MF patients who received 400 mg fedratinib. 
Most of the GI events were Grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 and 4 AEs of diarrhoea, nausea and 
vomiting were reported for 5.4%, 0.5% and 2.0% patients with MF who received 
400 mg fedratinib, respectively. Despite the high rate of GI TEAEs, these events were 
not a common reason for permanent treatment discontinuation. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
In the clinical development program, GI toxicities were observed across all indications 
including patients with MF, with solid tumours and in heathy volunteers. 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Section 4.2 –recommendations regarding prophylactic anti-emetics and 
administration with a high fat meal. 
SmPC Section 4.4 –advice regarding prophylactic treatment, treatment that should be 
given on the onset of symptoms, and monitoring and replenishment of thiamine levels. 
SmPC Section 4.8 – diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea listed as very common ADRs. 
PL Sections 2 and 4 – warning to talk to a doctor or pharmacist if symptoms including 
nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea, are present before and during fedratinib treatment. 
Diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea listed as very common side effects.

Grade 3 and 4 elevations of lipase were a dose-limiting toxicity in the Phase 1 dose 
finding study at high dose (up to 800 mg). Elevations of amylase (20%) and lipase 
(32%), all grades, were reported with fedratinib in patients with MF. Most of these 
events were Grade 1 or 2 and the more severe elevations responded to dose 
modification.  
During the clinical development programme, only one case of pancreatitis was 
observed in a patient in the Phase 3 study who presented with acute onset of 
abdominal pain and Grade 4 lipase increased by laboratory evaluation. The event 
occurred at the beginning of Cycle 7, and no elevations of lipase or amylase were 
detected by laboratory assessment before this event, including at the End-of-Cycle 6 
visit. The event resolved with treatment discontinuation. Given the above, the risk of 
pancreatitis is considered an important potential risk. 
Higher doses of fedratinib were associated with more severe elevations of amylase 
and lipase. Risk factors for pancreatitis include gallstones, prolonged alcohol use, high 
triglycerides and pancreatitis is commonly associated with diabetes, obesity and 
smoking (Forsmark, 2016). 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Section 4.2 – includes dose recommendations for other ≥ Grade 3 
non-haematologic toxicities. 
SmPC Section 4.4 – advice on monitoring of amylase and lipase. 
SmPC Section 4.8 – details of events of pancreatitis and elevated amylase/lipase. 
Amylase increased and lipase increased listed as very common ADRs.

Risk minimisation 
measures 
Elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (43%) and aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) (52%), all grades, were reported with 400 mg fedratinib in MF patients. Most 
of these elevations were Grade 1 or 2; however, Grade 3 and 4 ALT, AST and total 
bilirubin (TBL) elevations in the Phase 1 study (TED12037/TED12015) at higher 
fedratinib doses (patients received up to 800 mg) were observed and in a Phase 2 
dose-range finding study, one patient at 300 mg developed hepatic failure with 
Grade 4 elevations of ALT, AST and bilirubin. Fedratinib was withdrawn, and the 
patient recovered. 
Grade 3 or 4 elevations of ALT and AST were generally reversible with dose 
modification and permanent treatment discontinuation. Recommendations for dose 
modifications (including dose reductions) for severe hepatic enzyme elevations in 
order to prevent the potential risk of severe hepatotoxicity are included in Section 4.2 
of the SmPC. 
Risk factors may include higher doses of fedratinib. In the Phase 1 study 
(TED12037/TED12015), Grade 3 and 4 ALT, AST and TBL elevations were observed 
at higher fedratinib doses (patients received up to 800 mg). Risk factors for severe 
hepatotoxicity from drugs include medication dose, drug lipophilicity and extent of 
hepatic metabolism (Leise, 2014). Pre-existing liver disease/extramedullary 
haematopoiesis is also commonly observed in the liver in MF patients, and may 
increase the risk of severe hepatotoxicity. 
Host-related risk factors include the patient’s age, sex, genetics, previous episodes of 
drug-induced liver injury, and underlying chronic liver disease. Environmental risk 
factors include the patient’s metabolic features (eg, obesity), diet type, alcohol, coffee 
and tobacco consumption, multidrug therapy, immune state (eg, 
immunocompromised), and nutritional status (Licata, 2016). 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Section 4.2 – dose recommendations are provided.

Severe Infections Including Viral Reactivation 
Important Potential Risk: Severe Infections Including Viral Reactivation 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Infections including tuberculosis, urinary tract infections (UTI) and herpes zoster are 
an important identified risk of treatment with ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor. In 
Study EFC12153, the frequencies of patients with infection treatment-emergent 
adverse events was similar between placebo and treatment arms (clinical study report 
EFC12153, Section 12.3.1.3.4.2) however there was an increased frequency of UTI in 
fedratinib-treated patients compared to placebo but these were Grade 1 or 2 events. 
Therefore, the risk of severe infections including viral reactivation is considered an 
important potential risk for fedratinib. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk factors include underlying neutropenia, immunosuppressive disease or taking 
immunosuppressive agents. Prolonged hospitalisation may also increase the risk of 
serious infections.

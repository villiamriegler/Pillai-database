are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC, Annex 
The CHMP requested the MAH in December 2013 to update 
Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation 
II, Labelling 
the SmPC with a harmonised wording for rotavirus vaccines 
and PL 
based on new epidemiological data that became available 
on intussusception. These data strengthen the existing 
evidence base that suggests a small increased risk of 
intussusception shortly after vaccination with Rotarix and 
Rotateq. A statement regarding any difference in risk 
between the two vaccines cannot, however, be made. 
Given that the vaccine attributable risk of intussusception 
remains small, the CHMP recommended that the balance of 
Page 9/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
benefits and risks rotavirus vaccines remains favourable 
and requested the MAH that the SmPC should be updated 
to reflect that  
• 
Rotavirus vaccines carry an increased risk of 
intussusception, mostly within 7 days of vaccination. Up to 
6 additional cases per 100,000 infants have been observed 
in the US and Australia against a background incidence of 
33 to 101 per 100,000 infants (less than one year of age) 
per year, respectively. There is limited evidence of a 
smaller increased risk following the second dose. It remains 
unclear whether rotavirus vaccines affect the overall 
incidence of intussusception based on longer periods of 
follow up. 
• 
As a precaution, healthcare professionals should 
follow-up on any symptoms indicative of intussusception 
(severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bloody stools, 
abdominal bloating and/or high fever) since data from 
observational safety studies indicate an increased risk of 
intussusception, mostly within 7 days after rotavirus 
vaccination. Parents/guardians should be advised to 
promptly report such symptoms to their healthcare 
provider. 
The CHMP agreed that the wording proposed by the MAH 
submitted for this variation was in line with the CHMP 
request.

carried out using the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink data

7 days of vaccination cannot be excluded. The Product 
information was therefore updated to include 
intussusception as an adverse event identified through 
post-marketing surveillance in section 4.8 of the SmPC and 
section 4.4 was updated to state the following: 
No increased risk of intussusception was observed in 
clinical trials following administration of RotaTeq when 
compared with placebo. However, a small increased risk of 
intussusception in the 31-day period, mostly within 7 days 
following the administration of the first dose of RotaTeq, 
cannot be excluded. Therefore, as a precaution, healthcare 
professionals should follow-up on any symptoms indicative

significant elevated risk of either intussusception or 
Kawasaki disease associated with vaccination with RotaTeq.  
The Safety Monitoring Committee set up for this study 
noted that the evidence reviewed with respect to 
intussusception, Kawasaki Disease, and general safety 
continued to support the safety of RotaTeq.  Therefore, the 
results of this study do not change the conclusion that the 
risk-benefit relationship for approved use of RotaTeq 
remains favourable. The study findings were generally 
considered reassuring with respect to the overall safety of 
RotaTeq and any risk of IS or KD. Nevertheless, the Produc 
Information was updated as a precautionary measure to 
inform about the current status of the scientific knowledge 
on KD and IS in view of rotavirus vaccination.

Concomitant administration of RotaTeq and MenCC at about 
3 and 5 months did not affect the immunogenicity of either 
vaccine. Concomitant administration resulted in a higher 
rate of local and systemic Adverse Events compared to 
separate administration, but this difference was not enough 
to preclude co-administration. The Product Information was 
therefore updated to reflect these findings.

admissions and emergency department visits 
associated with confirmed episodes of rotavirus

years following vaccination with RotaTeq.  
The PL is updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to reflect 
clinical sites in Finland (i.e. the Finnish Extension Study 
[FES]). FES was not performed under an amendment to the 
protocol for REST but as an add-on, although using the 
same approach to case identification. The analyses covered 
the efficacy of RotaTeq with regard to health care 
encounters for hospitalisation and emergency department 
visits for a period of up to 3 years after completion of the

Further to the SPC update regarding the potential risk of

preclude the administration of RotaTeq to infants born at a

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
(REST) assessed for the initial Marketing Authorisation of 
RotaTeq, 3 cases of Kawasaki Disease (KD) were reported 
after the use of RotaTeq, which was not considered a safety 
signal at that time. After the unblinding of two further 
cases, there were in total 5 cases of KD that developed in 
children receiving RotaTeq. This compares with one case in 
a child receiving placebo, a risk difference that was not 
significant. 
However, as the study was not sufficiently powered to 
investigate KD, an increase the risk of KD in association 
with RotaTeq could not be excluded with any degree of

terms of immunogenicity and safety. The co-administration

of RotaTeq and OPV did not interfere with the 
immunogenicity of each of the poliovirus types 1, 2, or 3. 
Concomitant administration of OPV may reduce some 
immune responses to rotavirus vaccine but there is 
evidence that the immune response generated still results 
in a high level of efficacy against severe rotavirus gastro-

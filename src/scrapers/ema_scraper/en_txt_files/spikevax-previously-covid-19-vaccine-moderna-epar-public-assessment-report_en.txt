1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Moderna Biotech Spain, S. L. submitted on 30  November 2020 an application for 
marketing authorisation  to the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  for COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna, 
through the  centralised procedure falling within  the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004.  The eligibility  to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP  on 
12 October 2020. 
The applicant applied for the following indication:  ‘active immunisation  to prevent COVID-19 caused by 
SARS-CoV-2 virus in individuals 18 years of age and older’. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC  - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting  certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006,  the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0481/2020  on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0481/2020  was not  yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000  and Article 3  of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000,  the applicant  did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s requests for consideration 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
The applicant requested consideration of its  application for a Conditional marketing authorisation  in 
accordance with Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance CX-024414  (single-stranded, 5’-capped messenger RNA 
(mRNA) produced using a cell-free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, 
encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2) contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that  it is not a constituent  of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within  the  European Union.

Scientific advice 
The applicant received the following  Scientific advice on the  development relevant for the indication 
subject to the present application: 
Date 
Reference 
SAWP  co-ordinators 
15 October 2020 
EMEA/H/SA/4687/1/2020/III 
Dr Anders Lignell, Dr Hans  Ovelgönne 
The Scientific Advice pertained to the  following quality/non-clinical and clinical aspects: 
• 
Label for the  preservative-free multi-dose vial 
•  Manufacturing  control and absence of clinical lot consistency study 
•  Definition of the NTPs, enzymes and linearised plasmid DNA as raw materials 
•  Proposal to submit  batch release data only to an Official medicines control laboratory (OMCL) 
for fulfilment of Official control authority batch  release (OCABR) requirements 
•  Approach to validation of process versions / scales and validation of different sites 
•  Potency testing  of mRNA-1273 
•  Battery of preclinical studies conducted with mRNA-1273,  supported by platform data on mRNA 
vaccines formulated in  the same LNP formulation 
•  Strategy to  address the theoretical concern of vaccine induced enhanced respiratory disease 
•  Data package to support  MAA, including  requirements for vaccine efficacy, and safety database 
•  Submission at the time of first or second interim analysis of the phase 3  study, and criteria for 
success 
•  Regulatory pathways to accelerate the availability of mRNA-1273  vaccine 
Compliance with  Scientific Advice 
The applicant sought advice regarding the  label for the preservative-free multi-dose vial, 
manufacturing control and absence of a clinical lot consistency study, definition of the NTPs, enzymes 
and linearised plasmid DNA as raw materials, the approach to validation of process versions / scales 
and validation of different sites, and potency testing  of mRNA-1273. In the main, the  advice was 
adopted by the  applicant. Concerning the label, a statement on microbial contamination  must be added 
in line with  Guideline CPMP/QWP/159/96 corr for unpreserved sterile products. The extractable volume 
is tested at release; the procedures ensures that 10  doses can be withdrawn.  Inclusion of additional 
release attributes has been recommended. Except for numerical acceptance ranges for product related 
impurities, this  has been further discussed during the procedure and adequately addressed by the 
applicant. The definitions of raw /starting materials were implemented as requested. Concerning 
process validation and comparability the applicant followed the advice (several aspects were no longer 
relevant as the applicant changed the strategy). Concerning potency the applicant sufficiently justified 
the chosen approach for potency testing.  Based on the  provided data the applicant’s approach was 
considered acceptable. 
As regards the theoretical concern of COVID-19 vaccines to induce enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) 
the CHMP  concluded that  there are currently no animal models to  predict the risk of ERD. The strategy 
proposed by the applicant to evaluate ERD in the ongoing phase 3 study by monitoring  for early 
evidence of a potential  elevated rate of COVID-19 or severe COVID-19 in the mRNA-1273 group 
compared to the placebo group was considered reasonable.  
In addition, advice was given on the  data package needed to support MAA, including requirements for 
vaccine efficacy, and safety database, the  submission at the  time of first or second interim analysis of

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
End of December 2019, WHO was informed about  a cluster of cases of viral pneumonia of unknown 
cause in Wuhan,  China. In mid-January 2020 the  pathogen causing this  atypical pneumonia was 
identified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and genome 
sequence data were published. Since then the virus has spread globally and on 30 January 2020  the 
World Health Organization (WHO)  declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International 
Concern and on 11 March 2020  a pandemic. The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to 
control the outbreak.  
According to ECDC, histologic findings from the lungs include diffuse alveolar damage similar to lung 
injury caused by other respiratory viruses, such as MERS-CoV and influenza virus. A distinctive 
characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vascular damage, with  severe endothelial injury, widespread 
thrombosis, microangiopathy and angiogenesis. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
As of 27  December 2020, there have been over 80 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
globally with  approximately 1.8 million  deaths resulting  from infection and subsequent coronavirus 
disease (COVID-19). The majority of infections result in asymptomatic or mild  disease with full 
recovery.  
Underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic 
respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, immune compromised status,  cancer and obesity are 
considered risk factors for developing severe COVID-19. Other risk factors include organ 
transplantation  and chromosomal abnormalities.  
Increasing age is another risk factor for severe disease and death due to  COVID-19. European 
countries that have established surveillance systems in long-term care facilities (LTCF)  have reported 
that  5-6% of all current LTCF residents died of COVID-19, and that  LTCF residents accounted for up to 
72% of all COVID-19 related deaths. 
Individuals with  high  risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to occupation include healthcare and 
frontline workers. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with  a single linear RNA 
segment. It is enveloped and the  virions are 50–200  nanometres in  diameter. Like other 
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural  proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M 
(membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins.  
The spike protein contains a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to  increase pathogenicity 
and transmissibility in other viruses. The Spike is responsible for allowing  the virus to attach  to and 
fuse with the  membrane of a host cell. The S1 subunit  catalyses attachment  to the angiotensin 
converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor present on cells of the respiratory tract, while the S2 subunit 
facilitates fusion with  the cell membrane. The spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine 
development because it  was shown that  antibodies directed against it neutralise the virus and it  elicits 
an immune response that prevents infection  in animals. 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 13/169 
 
 
 
 
It is believed that  SARS-CoV-2 has zoonotic origins and it  has close genetic similarity to  bat 
coronaviruses. Its gene sequence was published mid-January 2020  and the  virus belongs to the beta-
coronaviruses.  
Human-to-human  transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in January 2020.  Transmission occurs 
primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes and through aerosols. After infection 
individuals remain infectious for up to two weeks and can spread the virus even if they do not show 
symptoms.  
The median incubation  period after infection to the development of symptoms is four to five days. Most 
symptomatic individuals experience symptoms within two  to seven days after exposure, and almost all 
symptomatic individuals will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve. Common symptoms 
include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste and symptoms may 
change over time.  
The major complication of severe COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presenting 
with  dyspnoea and acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. In addition to 
respiratory sequelae, severe COVID-19 has been linked to cardiovascular sequelae, such as myocardial 
injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, acute kidney injury often requiring renal 
replacement therapy, neurological complications such as encephalopathy, and acute ischemic stroke. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
The severity of COVID-19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with  few or no symptoms, 
resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases typically 
recover within two  weeks, while those with  severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to 
recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to  death has ranged from two to 
eight weeks. Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the 
hospital are associated with  severe course of COVID-19 and with a transfer to  ICU.  
The gold standard method of testing  for presence of SARS-CoV-2 is the reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which  detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As this test 
detects RNA but not  infectious virus, its  ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. 
The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab, a nasal swab or 
sputum sample. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The management of COVID-19 cases has developed during 2020, and includes supportive care, which 
may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.  
Treatment of hospitalised patients  encompass anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone and 
statins,  targeted immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants as well as antiviral therapy, (e.g. 
remdesivir), antibodies administered from convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulins. 
These therapies have shown variable and limited impact on the severity and duration of illness, with 
different efficacies depending on the stage of illness and manifestations of disease.  
While care for individuals with COVID-19 has improved with  clinical experience, there remains an 
urgent and unmet medical need for a vaccine able to prevent or mitigate COVID-19 infections during 
the ongoing pandemic. Especially protection of vulnerable groups and mitigating  the effects of the 
pandemic on a population level are desired. Although a first vaccine for prevention of COVID-19 was 
approved recently there is still an important need for additional  vaccines to meet global demands.

About the product 
COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna (also referred to in this  report as mRNA-1273) is a vaccine developed for 
prevention of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is based on nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding for 
the full-length  SARS-CoV-2 spike protein modified with  2 proline substitutions  within  the heptad repeat 
1 domain (S-2P) to stabilise the spike protein into  a prefusion conformation. The mRNA is encapsulated 
in lipid nanoparticles (LNP). 
The  spike  protein  mediates  attachment  and  entry  of  the  virus  into  host  cells  (by  binding  to  the 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor followed by membrane fusion), making it a primary target for 
neutralizing antibodies that  prevent infection. 
Upon delivery and uptake by body cells the mRNA is translated in the cytosol and SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein is generated by the host cell machinery. The spike protein is presented and elicits an adaptive 
humoral and cellular immune response. Neutralising antibodies are directed against it and hence it is 
considered a relevant target antigen for vaccine development.  
COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is administered intramuscularly in two 100  µg doses given 28 days apart. 
The intended indication is for ‘active immunisation to  prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus 
in individuals 18 years of age and older’.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested consideration of its  application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004,  based on the  following criteria: 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
According to the  applicant, there is a positive benefit-risk balance for in the active immunisation to 
prevent COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 18 years of age and older. This 
is based on evidence from the  pivotal study P301,  a Phase 3, randomised, stratified, observer-blind, 
placebo-controlled study to evaluate the  efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of COVID-19 Vaccine 
Moderna in individuals 18 years of age and older. The applicant stated that  the available data to date 
from the  first interim analysis indicate that  its vaccine was 94.5 percent effective in preventing COVID-
19, 100  percent effective in  preventing severe COVID-19 and had no serious side effects, showing that 
the vaccine prevented mild and severe forms of COVID-19. 
• 
It is likely that  the applicant will  be able to provide comprehensive data.  
The applicant intends to continue  the ongoing pivotal phase 3 study P301 with  all participants to be 
followed until 24  months after the second dose to  obtain long-term data and to ensure sufficient 
follow-up to support a standard marketing authorisation.  Following the Emergency Use Authorisation 
granted by the  FDA on 18  December 2020, the sponsor will offer to all participants in the placebo arm 
to receive the COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. In all cases, it is intended to follow participants up  to the 
original planned 24  months post-vaccination, regardless of any participants opting to crossover from 
placebo to active vaccination. The safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna in patients 
<18 years of age have not been established for this  application. 3 studies in paediatric subjects are 
planned as laid down in  the paediatric investigation plan. An observational pregnancy outcome study is 
also planned in the  EU. A Post-Approval Active Surveillance Safety Study to  Monitor Real-World Safety 
of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna will be conducted in the EU to provide additional evaluation of AESI and 
emerging validated safety signals in European populations.  The applicant will  also conduct an 
interventional study to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in  immunocompromised subjects, and 
conduct non-interventional studies to provide additional evaluation of AESI and emerging validated 
Assessment report

safety signals, and to evaluate the  real-world effectiveness and long-term effectiveness of mRNA-1273 
in preventing COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 disease.  
• 
Unmet medical needs will  be addressed. 
According to the  applicant, as there is no approved other vaccine in  the EU or successful COVID-19 
therapy available in the  EU, an unmet medical need is existing and is likely to be addressed by this 
vaccine in view of the high level of protection observed in the pivotal clinical trial. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the  risks inherent in the fact 
that  additional data are still required.  
According to the  applicant, the efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna to  prevent COVID-19 was 
demonstrated in the first interim analysis. The observed vaccine efficacy in each subgroup as defined 
by age, baseline characteristics, risk for severe COVID-19 was overall consistent with  the effectiveness 
of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna to protect vaccinees against the  disease. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product (also referred to in this report as mRNA-1273) is presented as a dispersion for 
injection containing 100  µg/0.5  mL dose of single-stranded, 5’ capped mRNA encoding full  length 
SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein as the active substance (referred to by the applicant as CX-024414), 
which is embedded in lipid  nanoparticles (LNPs).   
Other ingredients are: Heptadecan-9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl) (6-oxo-6-(undecyloxy) hexyl) amino) 
octanoate (SM-102),  cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), 1,2-dimyristoyl-
rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (PEG2000 DMG), tromethamol hydrochloride, acetic 
acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, sucrose and water for injections. The product is available in a glass 
vial (type I or equivalent) sealed with  a chlorobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium  seal (each vial 
contains sufficient volume to  extract 10  doses of 0.5  mL each). Vials are packaged in a carton 
containing a total  of ten  multi-dose vials per carton. 
The dossier is based on data from US manufacturing sites (mainly ModernaTX, Inc. Norwood and Lonza 
Biologics, Portsmouth)  with appropriate comparability, transfer and validation data for EU 
manufacturing operations.  
The CTD Module 3 dossier structure is not fully in line with  EU requirements as the information on the 
lipid excipients and manufacture of the LNP is being placed in 3.2.S rather than  3.2.P. During the 
procedure, the BWP/CHMP confirmed that the  mRNA (referred to by the applicant as CX-024414) 
should be considered as the active substance, which was accepted by the applicant. The company 
should undertake suitable amendment of the Module 3 CTD in line with the  definition of the active 
substance and finished product agreed and to support filings  of lifecycle activities in line with  EU 
requirements. A corresponding recommendation has been included to this  effect (REC 1.1.) 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
The active substance (referred to by the applicant as CX-024414)  is the mRNA encoding the  pre-fusion 
stabilizedstabilised Spike (S) protein of 2019-novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The S protein is 
composed of two subunits  (S1 and S2) and is stabilised in the so-called pre-fusion conformation by two

amino acid mutations,  K986P and V987P. The mRNA sequence includes a 5’ cap, the 5’ untranslated 
region (UTR), the Open Reading Frame (ORF), the 3’ UTR, and the  3’ polyA tail. The applicant provided 
sufficient information concerning the mRNA elements (including  regulatory elements within  the UTRs) 
and the proposed mechanism of action. The RNA contains modified N1-methylpseudouridine instead of 
uridine to minimise the indiscriminate recognition of the mRNA by pathogen-associated molecular 
pattern receptors (e.g. TLRs). Figure 1 illustrates  the general structure of the antigen-encoding RNA.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Manufacturers 
The active substance is manufactured and controlled by Lonza, Visp, Switzerland, with  appropriate 
GMP certification. 
Moderna, Norwood, USA is listed with  appropriate GMP certification for QC testing  until  method transfer 
is completed to  Lonza, Visp. 
At the time of authorisation, the  transfer of 3 methods for the active substance from Moderna, 
Norwood to Lonza Visp are ongoing to conclude by end of January 2021.  The Supervisory Authority, 
AEMPS confirmed that  the GMP certificate issued to Moderna, Norwood, USA for QC testing of the 
finished product can cover also testing of the active substance for the interim period. A satisfactory 
protocol for transfer of analytical methods for the active substance has been provided. 
Associates of Cape Cod, East Falmouth,  MA USA, will  be providing endotoxin testing until  transfer is 
complete to Lonza, Visp by end of January 2021. 
A major objection was raised regarding US sites proposed for manufacturing of the active substance, 
these manufacturing sites were subsequently withdrawn from the dossier. 
Description of manufacturing process, characterisation and process controls 
A description of the manufacturing process and process controls for the Lonza, Visp manufacturing site 
is provided. 
The manufacturing process for CX-024414  mRNA involves several major steps. The uncapped mRNA is 
transcribed from linear DNA utilising  an in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction followed by purification and 
filtration  steps. Next,  mRNA is enzymatically capped followed by additional purification and filtration 
steps. Finally, CX-214414  mRNA is filtered, dispensed and stored. 
The manufacturing process of CX-024414  mRNA is described in sufficient detail. The individual process 
steps are appropriately controlled with appropriate process parameters; however, the information 
should be completed with  submission of the  acceptance limits for all process parameters and evidence 
to support the proposed hold times (REC). Furthermore, a clarification is requested regarding the 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021

process control strategy (specified manufacturing process development information), including 
information on failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)  analysis, process characterisation studies and 
criticality assignment. 
Control of materials 
The applicant comprehensively describes the manufacture of the master cell bank (MCB) and working 
cell bank (WCB) of the plasmid as well as the release testing and the qualification protocol of new 
MCB/WCB. An adequate cell bank stability  program has been outlined.  
The linearised plasmid DNA is considered as the starting material. The manufacture is described in 
sufficient detail, covering: Origin of the DNA sequence, plasmid map, generation of the host cell line, 
transformation and purification of the  host cell line, plasmid cell banking system and stability testing 
and the linearised plasmid DNA is in principle thoroughly tested.  Specifications are in general 
appropriate for authorizationauthorisation, however, will  be reviewed after a sufficient number of 
batches has been produced (REC). The omission of an in-process control test for plasmid retention and 
plasmid copy number is sufficiently justified.  Percent covalently closed circular DNA (%cccDNA) is 
routinely monitored post-polishing  chromatography. However, evidence regarding 
qualification/validation of methods used for release testing should be provided (REC). Furthermore, 
sources for all appropriate reference materials/assay controls for plasmid and linearised DNA plasmid 
manufacturing are requested (REC). The formal shelf life for the  linearised plasmid DNA and stability 
testing  is appropriate. So far, no trending or degradation has been observed. There are no materials of 
animal origin used in the  manufacture of CX-024414 mRNA. 
The nucleotide starting material specifications will be finalised with  suitably tight  limits for purity (and 
impurities and other parameters if relevant) that ensure consistent active substance quality (REC). 
The applicant provided a conclusive description of all raw materials used. Certificates of Analysis 
(CoAs) were provided within  the submission package and comply with pharmacopoeial requirements 
where appropriate. All enzymes utilised are produced in E.  coli. Further  information on the medium 
used for MCB and WCB manufacture is requested (REC). There is also a reasonable risk mitigation 
strategy for extractables and leachables applied to for all materials with liquid  product contact used in 
CX-024414  process. 
All materials conform with  Certificates of Analysis (CoAs) or Certificates of Compliance, which includes 
verification of bovine spongiform encephalopathy/transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (BSE/TSE) 
certificates, as required. 
The control of the  critical steps of the CX-024414  manufacturing process is generally acceptable. 
Additional details are requested regarding the method used for quantification  of residual protein 
(critical in-process control; REC). 
In order to complete the characterisation of the active substance and finished product manufacturing 
process, the MAH  should provide additional data. Further information is required as regards the overall 
control strategy. Hence, tabulated  summaries of FMEA performed including the  conclusions drawn and 
appropriate justifications for criticality assignment and priority assigned to characterisation studies are 
requested (Specific obligation 1). In addition, tabulated summaries of the actual settings  of the 
investigated parameters, analytical results and the prediction profiles should be provided for all process 
characterisation studies (Specific Obligation 1). 
Validation data of the  process A at ModernaTX, Inc. in  Norwood and the  process B initial  at Lonza 
Biologics are provided and considered acceptable. However, the validation data from the  initial process 
B scale at Lonza Visp needs to be provided as soon as available in  order to confirm the  consistency of 
the manufacturing process (Specific obligation 2). The applicant has provided in the initial  dossier 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021

plans for an upscaled process, which has not been supported by validation data. If the applicant wishes 
to include this  upscaled process (Final scale B) to  the marketing authorisation  a variation application 
should be submitted. This should include appropriate validation data for the new scale (Final  scale B). 
The proposed lifetimes for the chromatography resins and the  TFF membranes are properly justified 
with  data from small-scale models. 
The manufacturing process of CX-024414  mRNA started with a small-scale process. The process was 
then up-scaled to Scale A, to Initial Scale B and then to Final  Scale B (to be added via variation 
application). Scale A batches were used in the Phase III clinical trial. The major change was from the 
small-scale process to the Scale A process, including the  addition of two process steps for the  Scale A 
process. No changes were made to  the unit operations or sequence of unit  operations from Scale A to 
initial  Scale B processes. Initial comparability of the mRNA produced with  the different process scales is 
considered established based on release as well as additional  characterisation data. However, the 
applicant is asked to provide the full  comparability data for the  initial scale B at Lonza Visp as soon as 
data is available. 
In order to confirm the consistency of the active substance process (Initial  scale), the applicant should 
provide additional comparability and validation data post-marketing in the context of a specific 
obligation (Specific Obligation 2). 
Characterisation 
The applicant provided a detailed characterisation of the mRNA active substance including  detailed 
information on the structural properties of the mRNA CX-024414.  Additionally, data on the 
chromatographic profile, the thermal denaturation as well as freeze thaw degradation and their 
influence on protein expression have been provided.  
Concerning product and process related impurities a thorough  characterisation of the mRNA CX-
024414  is provided.  
Regarding product-related impurities, the applicant described short mRNA species that  can occur 
because of abortive transcription or premature termination of transcription. As the majority of these 
short mRNAs do not  contain a PolyA tail, the manufacturing process includes chromatography steps, 
which aim at removing these impurities to a large extent.  Other short fragments are controlled by in 
process testing of mRNA purity. No induction  of immune stimulation by uncapped mRNA can be seen 
and potentially stimulatory dsRNA is consistently low throughout the  process scale-ups.  
Additional bands are observed by an in-vitro translation assay. To further elucidate the nature of these 
additional bands, data should be provided. Furthermore, additional  details should be provided for the in 
vitro translation method and the negative and positive controls used, since the number and intensity of 
unspecific bands observed still leaves some uncertainty regarding the possible translation  of additional 
proteins/peptides. In this context additional characterisation data or a scientific justification are 
requested (REC). 
Specification 
The active substance specifications contain tests  for: Appearance (visual), Identity RT- Sanger 
Sequencing), Total RNA content  (UV), Purity (RP-HPLC), Product-related impurities (RP-HPLC), % 5’ 
Capped (RP-UPLC), % PolyA tailed  RNA (RP-HPLC),  Residual DNA template (qPCR), pH 
(pharmacopoeial), Bacterial endotoxin (pharmacopoeial), Bioburden (pharmacopoeial). 
The specifications provided by the applicant are considered acceptable. The lack of a specification for 
polyA tail  length and dsRNA is in  principle supported by the characterisation and the process 
Assessment report

development data provided. However, it is emphasised that  the control strategy should ensure that 
dsRNA levels will always be at a sufficiently low level when the manufacturing  process is run within  the 
registered process parameter ranges, considering its potentially immune-stimulatory properties. 
Alternatively, an appropriate release specification for dsRNA should be registered (REC). However, it is 
emphasised that  these quality  attributes will  be tested in  case of process changes or in process 
validation/ process performance qualification (PPQ) analysis as additional characterisation assays to 
support process consistency. 
Analytical methods 
All analytical methods used for testing  of the active substance are described in the  dossier. The 
analytical methods are described in sufficient detail and SOP numbers are provided for US and EU 
testing  sites. However, the applicant states “Equivalent instruments  and reagents may be substituted 
where indicated”  in most method descriptions. The applicant will  however follow the EU variation 
guideline that  indicates which  critical reagents can only be changed via a variation procedure. 
Additionally, the applicant committed to  reference Ph. Eur. instead of USP whenever possible. 
The methods are properly validated for the US testing sites with  the exception of the  robustness of the 
methods. The applicant is asked to commit to submit robustness validation data of all the  methods 
concerned (REC). The transfer, verification and validation of analytical methods to perform testing  for 
CX-024414  at Lonza AG are currently on-going. An analytical Transfer Master Protocol, which  describes 
the transfer of test  methods to Lonza AG, has been provided in the  dossier. These method validation 
data from the  EU testing  site should be provided as soon as possible (Specific obligation 2).  
The analytical transfer master protocol is provided and considered acceptable. Furthermore, 
information as regards the  planned implementation  of the Sanger Sequencing performed at Microsynth 
and GROUP-109205 solo VPE for in-process monitoring of mRNA concentration is requested (REC). 
The provided batch data are acceptable. The data from the  one batch provided from the EU 
manufacturing site meets all specifications. Additional data supporting the  Lonza Visp manufacturing 
process should be provided as soon as available. The specifications are considered acceptable for 
authorisation but  need to be revised when more manufacturing experience has been gained. 
In order to ensure consistent  product quality, the MAH  should review the active substance 
specifications following  further manufacturing experience. (Specific obligation 3). 
The data provided relate to lots used for clinical development and manufactured at ModernaTX, Inc. 
Norwood and Lonza Biologics, Portsmouth. Scales A and initial scale B were used for clinical studies 
and the data showed good consistency and comparability of scales.  
The description of the reference standard is considered acceptable and also details how future 
reference material will be qualified are included. The reference standard for the commercial production 
is derived from a PPQ lot  from the Scale A process. It was thoroughly tested and characterised and will 
be followed up by a stability monitoring protocol. However, the  respective qualification report is 
requested (REC). Implementation of a secondary reference standard (and two-tiered system) is 
planned as detailed in the dossier. 
For the EU  manufacturing site, the active substance will be stored in 20 l Mobius  bags. In line with 
CPMP/QWP/4359/03,  Mobius storage bags should be tested for extractables/leachables, a respective 
commitment has been provided (REC). Furthermore, suitability  of the  Mobius bags should be justified 
as to date no stability data with  samples stored in  representative storage container are available 
(please refer to section on stability).  (Specific Obligation 3) 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 20/169 
 
 
 
 
Stability 
A shelf life of the active substance when stored at the intended storage condition of -20°C ± 5°C in 
Mobius bags was proposed by the  applicant.  
In relation to mRNA purity and stability, data on the degradation rate was provided and shown to 
demonstrate Arrhenius behaviour, with  first order kinetics. The stability  profiles were demonstrated to 
be predictable and amenable to modelling, enabling a good understanding of the chemical degradation 
process. 
For the active substance, the  stability data presented consist of data for 2  clinical lots,  3 GMP lots and 
one development batch. The data for GMP lots at Moderna were manufactured at the Process A scale 
and used appropriately validated, stability indicating  assays. 
The initial shelf life claim at  -20°C ± 5°C is not considered acceptable based on the provided data. 
Furthermore, the representativeness of the container closure system used is not yet sufficiently 
justified, since the storage container for stability samples differs from the commercial container closure 
system. Hence, stability  data from batches produced at Lonza Visp should be provided as soon as 
available (Specific Obligation 3).  
In conclusion, based on the limited stability  data presented, a reduced shelf-life at  -20°C ± 5°C 
compared to the shelf life initially proposed can be approved for the active substance, when stored in 
Mobius bags.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product is presented as a white  to off-white, multi-dose ready-to-use dispersion for 
intramuscular injection. It contains an mRNA active substance (referred to by the applicant as CX-
024414)  that  encodes for the pre-fusion stabilised spike glycoprotein of 2019-novel Coronavirus 
(SARS-CoV-2) encapsulated into  lipid nanoparticles (LNP)  dispersed in a diluent buffer at pH 7.5.  The 
LNP are composed of four lipids which act as protectants and carriers of the  mRNA. These are: 
heptadecan-9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl)(6-oxo-6-(undecyloxy)hexyl)amino)octanoate (SM-102, a custom-
manufactured, ionisable lipid),  1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 
(PEG2000-DMG), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) and cholesterol.  
The finished product is supplied in  a multi-dose 10R clear Type 1 borosilicate glass vial or Type 1-
equivalent alkali aluminosilicate glass with  a chlorobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium seal. The 
vial, stopper and seal components comply with  the appropriate Ph. Eur. monographs for primary 
containers and closures. 
There is no manufacturing overage. Each vial contains 6.3 mL fill  volume, which corresponds to 10 
doses of 0.5 mL (containing  100 micrograms mRNA). There is a 1.3 mL  vial overfill. During the 
evaluation the applicant has been requested to justify this  and confirm whether it  would be feasible to 
retrieve 11 doses. The applicant responded that  the fill volume was defined using components 
commonly used in preparation / administration  of intramuscular injections (allowing for the dead 
volume from BD disposable syringes 1-mL  with  luer lock, 20G 1.5” needles), consideration of hold-up 
Assessment report

volume in 10R  vials, the fill tolerance observed at fill finish  sites and the  validated extraction of 10 
doses from each vial. 
The composition of the finished product, including  amounts per vial, function  and quality standard 
applicable to  each component, was presented.  
SM-102,  a novel, ionisable lipid  excipient, is positively charged to drive lipid  to electrostatically interact 
with  the mRNA, when combined. Cholesterol is incorporated to provide structure and physicochemical 
stability to  the particles. The zwitterionic  “helper” lipid,  DSPC, is incorporated to increase the fusogenic 
properties of the particles. The polyethylene glycol-lipid conjugate novel excipient, PEG2000-DMG, 
confers steric stabilisation to the  nanoparticles.  
Sucrose is added to promote product stability through  freeze/thaw and long-term storage. 
All excipients except the lipid excipients SM-102, DSPC and PEG2000-DMG, tromethamol hydrochloride 
and sodium acetate trihydrate comply to Ph. Eur. grade. Concerning the  use of non-Ph. Eur. grade 
cholesterol also cited by the  company applicant a request to only used Ph. Eur. cholesterol has been 
requested (REC)). 
Three specifications for tromethamol hydrochloride used for the neutralising buffer are included. The 
applicant committed to provide a single consensus specification (REC). 
Two different specifications have been included for the novel excipient SM-102  depending on the 
manufacturing site, e.g. different tests on appearance and different acceptance criteria for the test on 
related substances of SM-102.  The applicant committed to  present one aligned specification including  a 
test on related substances with  numerical limits (REC).  
For the non-compendial excipient 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) reference is 
made to  a United  States CDER Master File. However, master files for excipients are not  acceptable in 
the EU.  The applicant committed  to provide further data sufficiently describing the quality of DSPC 
(REC).  
For the compendial excipient cholesterol the  acceptance criterion for bacterial endotoxins included in 
the specification is 10 times higher (1 EU/mg) than  in the Ph. Eur. monograph Cholesterol for 
parenteral use. The specification will  be corrected to 0.1  EU/mg. 
Novel excipients 
As indicated above, the finished product contains two novel excipients, namely SM-102  and PEG2000-
DMG. 
SM-102 
General Information 
The chemical name of SM-102  is Heptadecan-9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl) (6-oxo-6-(undecyloxy) hexyl) 
amino)octanoate.

Molecular Formula: C44H87NO5, Molecular Mass: 709.7  g/mol, Molecular Weight:  710.2  g/mol. 
SM-102  is very soluble in several organic solvents and practically insoluble in water. 
Manufacture 
The GMP manufacturing process of the  novel excipient SM-102  covers synthesis and workup of Crude 
SM-102,  reduction of Crude SM-102,  and the purification. For the manufacturing process flow charts 
and narrative descriptions were provided including in-process controls.  
The in-process control targets refer to “Report results”. The applicant committed  to include numerical 
values (REC). 
Information on the  manufacturers, synthesis and specifications for both  starting materials of SM-102  is 
presented in the  dossier. The specifications for partly contain “Report results” as acceptance criteria. 
The applicant committed to include numerical values (REC). 
Manufacturing  process development of the  novel excipient SM-102 contains the development history 
including process optimisations.  Differences between SM-102  manufacturers are also discussed. It can 
be concluded that  all sites produce comparable quality of SM-102. Nevertheless, CQAs, CPPs and 
critical attributes  of the materials used for the manufacture of SM-102 are missing. The applicant will 
provide those post-marketing (REC). 
Characterisation 
The structure of the novel excipient SM-102 has been adequately characterised by means of IR-, 1H-
NMR  and 13C-NMR and mass spectrometry as well  as elemental analysis.  
The information provided on potential impurities in SM-102  comprise product related substances and 
process related impurities (elemental impurities, residuals solvents, peroxides, water content and 
inorganic impurities). The applicant will provide an evaluation of mutagenic impurities based on ICH M7 
(REC). 
Control of SM-102 
The specification for the excipient SM-102 comprises in principle all necessary tests to control its 
quality.  
However, the  specification for the test on related substances should be revised to include specified 
identified impurities with  suitable limits.  The applicant will  revise the specification accordingly (REC). 
The assay limits in the specification of SM-102 are rather wide. A commitment has been provided to 
tighten  the limits  as more experience is gained (REC).  
A test on benzene, which  might be present in  e.g. toluene or acetone should be performed on the final 
excipient or on a suitable intermediate if not otherwise justified. The applicant  committed to present a 
risk assessment for the presence of benzene in SM-102  (REC). 
The in-house test procedures for SM-102  and the respective validations are not sufficiently described. 
The applicant will provide detailed procedure descriptions and validation reports (REC). 
Batch analysis data have been provided for 18 batches. The results are consistent across batches. The 
applicant will clarify which batches were included in toxicological and clinical studies (REC).  
Reference Standards or Materials 
The SM-102 reference standard is used for identification  and assay. Information on the primary 
standard is provided.

Container Closure System 
The applicant committed to revise this section to only include one container closure system instead of 
the currently used two  depending on the  manufacturing site. The SM-102 primary packaging 
information will be amended. All components are fully compliant with  current international food contact 
regulations such as (EU)  No 10/2011.  The applicant will provide specifications for the  foil pouches in 
which the  glass containers are packaged and sealed (functional  secondary packaging for SM-102) 
(REC). 
Stability

Appropriate CPPs have been defined. 
In-process testing has been described, however, information on analytical methods used for in-process 
testing  is missing and will  be provided post-approval (REC). 
Information provided on manufacturing development history, CQA risk assessment and control 
strategy has been provided needs however to be adapted (REC). 
Characterisation 
The spectroscopic studies performed to investigate the  molecular structure DMG-PEG2000 are: 
Infrared Absorption Spectroscopy, 1H-NMR  Spectroscopy, 13C-NMR Spectroscopy and Mass 
Spectroscopy. Exemplary spectra including an interpretation of the results have been provided. 
The polydispersity was analysed by GPC Information on the impurity profile has been provided. That 
information is not sufficient since reporting of impurities in  the batch analysis data is not consistent 
with  the current characterisation data (see below). Potential presence of mutagenic impurities in 
PEG2000-DMG should be evaluated and the results will be provided post-approval (REC). 
Control of PEG2000-DMG 
The following attributes have been included in the specification of the novel excipient PEG2000-DMG: 
appearance, identification by NMR, average molecular weight by TOF-MS,  purity by RP-HPLC, moisture 
by Karl Fischer, residual solvents by GC, bacterial endotoxins, bioburden, residual heavy metals. The 
specification is currently not acceptable. Polydispersity should be included in the specification for 
PEG2000-DMG post-approval. Numerical limits  for specified and unspecified impurities will be included 
in the PEG2000-DMG  specification post-approval. The current reporting of impurities is not  acceptable. 
Characterisation data for impurities which are reported under ‘content  of unknown’  should be provided 
post-approval (REC). 
Analytical methods have been adequately described. However, in the description of the HPLC purity 
method information on the reporting threshold is missing and should be provided post-approval. 
Validation data for the analytical methods to control DMG-PEG2000 are missing and should be provided 
post-approval (REC). 
Batch analysis data for five batches have been provided. All results comply with  the specifications. 
More detailed information on these batches will be provided post-approval (REC). 
Reference Standards or Materials 
Sufficient information has been provided for reference standards or materials. 
Container Closure System 
The container closure system has been described. Information and specifications on the material used 
for the storage of PEG2000-DMG is missing and will be provided post-approval (REC). 
Stability 
Stability data for three batches stored at long-term and accelerated conditions have been provided. No 
negative trends but  a certain variability in the results for purity have been observed in the stability 
studies. From the information provided with  the specification it is concluded that  the shelf-life (re-test 
period) is acceptable. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The applicant has sufficiently described the  formulation development, mainly referring to similar 
platforms and scientific publications.  This includes the choice of the four lipids, the molar ratio of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 25/169 
 
 
 
 
single lipids and the manner in  which the mRNA is encapsulated leading to a mRNA-loaded LNP 
intermediate which is further processed to produce the finished product.  
As indicated above, the finished product comprises four lipids: SM-102,  DSPC, cholesterol, and PEG-
lipid. SM-102  is a proprietary ionisable lipid that  was selected by the applicant out of a panel of lipids 
because of its vaccine potency and tolerability and biodegradability. The applicant has optimised lipid 
ratios for his purpose.  
There are only minor differences between the  early clinical formulations used in phase I and II studies 
and the formulation of the phase III finished product batches. In Phase I and II studies, a target 
concentration of 0.5 mg/mL mRNA was prepared and a range of doses tested.  After selection of the 
final dose, a target concentration of 0.20 mg/mL  mRNA was developed for Phase III and commercial 
batches as a ready-to-use solution. Slight  variations in the  sodium acetate content and the distribution 
of tromethamol in the Dilution Buffer (tromethamol base and tromethamol HCl)  were caused by the 
dilution  step of the  Phase I and II batches. In addition,  the lipid concentrations were slightly  modified 
during manufacture for Phase III. 
The suitability of the formulation composition has been studied in a number of developmental stability 
studies at the intended  long-term storage conditions as well as shorter term accelerated studies to 
enable manufacturing of the finished product. The data available to date demonstrate that  there is no 
change in mRNA purity and LNP  biophysical qualities when stored at -70°C. In contrast, mRNA 
chemical degradation is observed at -20°C,  5°C, and 25°C in a temperature-dependent manner. The 
proposed storage of finished product at -20°C is nevertheless acceptable, since only slight degradation 
is observed at -20°C as shown  by preliminary stability  data.  
Since the  finished product is presented in multi-dose vials, the applicant has analysed the  effect of 
several preservatives on the biophysical parameters RNA encapsulation, polydispersity and particle 
size. Results showed an increase of particle size and polydispersity index and a decrease in % RNA 
encapsulation in the presence of these preservatives. The effects were enhanced after freezing. These 
results justify the development of the vaccine without  preservatives, since a microbiological challenge 
hold time study demonstrated no microbial growth for at least 12 hours at room temperature after 
inoculation of low levels of selected microorganisms. 
Physicochemical properties (density, viscosity, surface tension, osmolality, glass transition 
temperature) of mRNA-loaded LNP intermediate and the finished product solutions have been shown  at 
different temperatures.  
Manufacturing  process development 
The manufacturing process development includes processes of different scales at different 
manufacturing sites, which have been sufficiently described.  
As indicated above, the manufacturing process for the finished product comprises several stages. 
The manufacturing process development of each of these has been provided. Changes to the 
specification and of the analytical procedures between the  different processes have been presented.  
The LNP are comprised of four lipid components (cholesterol, SM-102,  DSPC and PEG2000-DMG). 
mRNA-loaded LNP  intermediate  
The product consists of an mRNA-lipid complex dispersion that contains the  mRNA (CX-024414)  that 
encodes for the pre-fusion stabilised Spike protein of 2019-novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).  
Comprehensive development data have been provided. Changes made during development have been 
described. They included scale-up, addition of a bulk freezing step, change of some equipment and 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 26/169 
 
 
 
 
revision of the lipid molar ratios to  allow for harmonisation with  the platform process. The overall lipid 
content remained unchanged.  
The Initial Scale B process has been transferred to the site registered for EU manufacture Lonza, Visp. 
Changes were made to materials for regional availability, operations and equipment to  maintain 
aseptic processing aligned with  facility fit,  and equipment availability. 
In accordance with ICH Q9, a FMEA  was performed with  respect to the  manufacturing process. A 
science-based approach was used to identify Critical Quality Attributes  (CQAs), CPPs and CIPCs to 
inform process design studies, and to establish the  manufacturing control strategy. Characterisation 
data supporting the PARs for the CPPs and non-critical process parameters are included. The small-
scale model used for the characterisation studies is described and evaluated demonstrating that  the 
small-scale model is representative for the scaled process. 
The PARs defined in  the development section are in general appropriately transferred to the 
commercial manufacturing process description. Some clarifications and amendments are needed for 
the manufacturing process description (REC). Some clarifications and amendments were needed for 
the manufacturing process description. Respective information and/or commitments have been 
provided. 
The proposed CQAs of the LNP are appearance, mRNA identity, total  RNA content, purity and product-
related impurities, % RNA encapsulation, particle size, lipids identification, lipids content,  lipids purity, 
pH,  osmolality, bacterial endotoxins and bioburden. The CPPs for the mRNA-1273  LNP manufacturing 
process have been described. No CIPCs were identified for the mRNA-1273  LNP manufacturing process. 
A risk assessment concerning potential extractables and leachables from manufacturing components 
and container closure systems has been performed according to the  applicant. However, no details are 
available on possible extractables. The applicant will provide respective data (REC). 
Comparability 
Analytical comparability data were generated with  one Phase 3 clinical lot and three PPQ lots 
manufactured by the development site, ModernaTX in Norwood, US (not being registered for 
manufacture of product for the European market) at development scale. Additional data have been 
generated with  commercial scale batches. Samples were analysed in a side-by-side format whenever 
possible.  
The following attributes have been investigated in the analytical comparability studies: LNP  size 
distribution,  LNP size distribution,  sub-visible particles (SVP) counts and morphology, LNP  surface 
characterisation, LNP  charge, LNP charge distribution,  LNP structure, LNP  density, LNP  surface 
characterisation and protein expression by in vitro protein expression. 
Extended characterisation data have also been provided for the first GMP batch manufactured at Lonza 
AG, CH.  With  results to  date it  is demonstrated that  the pre-change and post-change manufacturing 
processes and quality attributes  were comparable. 
Differences to batches manufactured by Moderna, TX observed in the  extended characterisation 
exercise and release testing of the first GMP batch manufactured at Lonza AG, CH for several attributes 
related to  particle size and particle size distribution  will be further be evaluated (REC). 
The applicant committed to provide comparability results including  extended characterisation data 
using the full  panel of characterisation methods from all PPQ batches manufactured by Lonza AG, CH 
demonstrating that  the commercial product manufactured at the  Lonza, Visp site is representative of 
the material used in  the clinical trials. (Specific Obligation 2).  
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021

Forced degradation will  be evaluated in  the next comparability phase. Results from forced degradation 
studies should be submitted when available (REC). 
Finished product 
Comprehensive development data on the  finished product have been provided. Changes made during 
development have been described. Changes were related to scale up required for commercial supply.  
The proposed CQAs for the  finished product are: appearance, mRNA identity,  total RNA content,  purity 
and product-related impurities, % RNA encapsulation, in  vitro translation,  lipid identity, lipid  content, 
lipid impurities, mean particle size and polydispersity, pH,  osmolality, particulate matter, container 
content,  bacterial endotoxin, and sterility. 
CQAs, CPPs, and CIPCs have been defined based on risk assessments, process characterisation 
studies, and knowledge gained from manufacturing experience and an appropriate control strategy has 
been established, in accordance with  ICH Q9. The applicant committed  to provide the underlying 
process risk assessment (Specific obligation 1).  The approach to  define a cumulative time out of 
refrigeration (room temperature) and at 2°C - 8°C is acceptable; however, it  should be noted  that 
increasing process time negatively impacts RNA purity. 
Characterisation studies have been performed in order to demonstrate that the  quality attributes of the 
final product are highly similar across processes. 
Comparability 
Analytical comparability data were generated with  four Phase 1/Phase 2 and six Phase III pilot  scale A 
batches from Moderna, TX; three pilot  scale A PPQ batches from Catalent intended for 
clinical/emergency use authorisation/commercial use outside EU, and one scale B batch from Rovi, 
Spain (EU finished product manufacturer intended for commercial use). A similar approach to 
comparability was used across manufacturing processes. Comparability between the processes has 
been shown  by a) comparison of the processes and description of the changes, b)  extended 
characterisation (physico-chemical properties, particle size, and impurities) of Phase 1/2 and Phase 3 
clinical lots and PPQ lots up  to Scale A and c) batch release results. Further Scale A to Scale B 
comparability will  be based on description and justification  of process changes including sites, scales, 
raw materials, process equipment and evaluation of process performance with respect to CPPs and 
IPCs as well as statistical  evaluation of comparability of release testing results. Extended analytical 
characterisation testing  is not performed at the level of the finished product as part of comparability 
studies as finished product  characteristics are the same as for mRNA-loaded LNP intermediate. 
Nonetheless, results are available for one commercial scale B lot manufactured at  the finished product 
manufacturing site for the EU market (Rovi, Spain) therefore, although there is sufficient comparability 
information to justify approval in this  pandemic, no final conclusion can be drawn with  regard to Scale 
A to Scale B comparability. The final validation report including an assessment of comparability is 
requested (Specific obligation 2). 
Container closure system 
A standard container closure system has been chosen that  is suitable for the  intended purpose. It is 
composed of glass vials and rubber stoppers. Both  components are compliant with  Ph. Eur. 
requirements. The sterilisation cycles used for sterilisation of vials and stoppers are not described and 
has been requested (REC). For the  container closure components, vendor-generated extractables data 
were used for an initial  quantitative  toxicological assessment. The assigned safety concern threshold 
for some stopper oligomers is exceeded in the estimated amount per dose. However, a product-specific 
leachable study indicated no reportable organic compounds over the analytical evaluation threshold.

Compatibility 
Compatibility testing  that  establishes the clinical in-use period for the finished product under 
refrigerated and ambient conditions was performed (see stability section). Materials of contact planned 
for clinical dosing (e.g., needles, syringes, vials) were used to determine material compatibility  and 
clinical in-use stability. Hold  times in the syringe of 0 and 8 hours were assessed under ambient 
conditions (room temperature) and 5°C with  clinical material from early phase trials containing 0.1 
mg/mL or 0.5 mg/mL mRNA concentration. Results showed no notable change to attributes  of the 
finished product. Stability was demonstrated for clinical in-use for up  to 8 hours at either ambient 
temperature or at 5°C. 
Additional in-use studies were performed for the commercial dosage strength of 0.20 mg/mL.  The 
product solution was held in the vial at room temperature for either 1 hour or 7 hours after thaw. 
Dosing syringes were prepared from the vial after 1 hour and then  again after 7 hours upon completion 
of a 1-hour  thaw at room temperature. The syringes were then held for 0, 4, 8, and 12  hours at room 
temperature and refrigerated conditions. Clinical in-use stability was demonstrated for dosage 
strengths of 0.20  mg/mL for 6 hours after first puncture in the vial followed by 8 hours in the syringe 
at either ambient temperature or at storage between 2°C to 8°C  (see stability section). 
Microbiological attributes 
The finished product is manufactured by a conventional aseptic process using sterilising filtration. 
Prefiltration bioburden is monitored as part of the  manufacturing process. The microbiological quality 
attributes  are monitored by testing  for sterility and endotoxins at release. Sterility is also monitored 
annually as part of the stability testing  program. The microbiological suitability  of the  selected primary 
container closure system has been demonstrated through container closure integrity  (CCI) testing 
studies. Results from container closure integrity  testing demonstrate that the  chosen container is 
suitable for storage and provides adequate protection. 
The finished product does not include a preservative. As discussed above the lipid nanoparticle-based 
product is not compatible with  common preservatives. 
A microbial challenge hold time  study, also known as growth promotion study was performed with a 
range of different microorganisms to assess the impact of low levels of microbial contamination from 
initial  needle puncture/vial entry for the finished product. The level inoculum levels were 
representative of contamination  that may occur in an in-use situation  when multiple doses are 
withdrawn  from the same vial. The results showed that  growth of the inoculated microorganisms is 
hindered for up to 24  hours at 20°C  – 25°C. Hence, the proposed 6 hours in-use period from initial 
needle puncture described in  the product information is supported. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
mRNA-loaded LNP  intermediate  
Valid GMP certificates for the registered manufacturing sites have been provided. 
The LNP manufacturing process comprises lipid stock solution (LSS) preparation, nanoprecipitation 
mixing, tangential flow filtration  (TFF),  dilution  and cryoprotectant addition,  clarification, fill,  and 
freezing and storage.  
The manufacturing process will be validated using a concurrent validation approach. This is acceptable 
in view of the pandemic and the data provided. Process validation and comparability data will have to 
be provided (Specific obligation 2). Upscaling of the manufacturing process should be included by 
variation post-authorisation.

market at the  proposed commercial batch size is available. The pre-PPQ batch is executed in order to 
verify and evaluate the transferred process and check the readiness of the process at manufacturing 
scale prior to validation. Acceptable test results have been provided for that  batch. This will  be followed 
by three PPQ batches at  the commercial production scale. Validation results in accordance with the PPQ 
protocols for the EU  site Lonza, Visp, Switzerland are expected. This results in a specific obligation 
(Specific obligation 2). 
For the manufacturing process of mRNA-1273 LNP  at Moderna, TX (not  being registered for 
manufacture of product for the European market) protocols for process performance qualification have 
been provided Reports are available. Altogether, the manufacturing process for the scales presented 
met acceptance criteria and expected outcomes. 
A comprehensive PPQ protocol for the proposed EU manufacturing site Lonza, Visp, Switzerland for the 
registered commercial batch size of mRNA-1273  LNP is available. However, some clarification was 
needed, which  has been provided.  
The pre-PPQ batch has been executed at Lonza, Visp in order to verify and evaluate the transferred 
process and check the readiness of the process at manufacturing scale prior to validation. The test 
results for that  batch have provided. This will  be followed by three PPQ batches at the commercial 
production scale. 
Validation results in accordance with the PPQ protocols for Lonza, Visp, Switzerland are required 
(Specific obligation 2). A brief description of the shipping process of mRNA-1273  LNP to the finished 
product manufacturer should be included in the dossier (REC).

are ongoing to conclude by end of January 2021.  The development site was inspected by AEMPS and it 
was found to be GMP compliant. A time-limited  exemption allowing  reliance on batch control testing 
conducted in the registered site that  is located in a third country for these two QC tests is being 
applied. (see Annex II of the  opinion). 
The nominal manufacturing batch size for the finished product has been defined. 
Manufacturing  process:

The manufacturing of the  finished product (from mRNA-loaded LNP intermediate) consists of dilution  of 
the mRNA-loaded LNP intermediate with a formulation buffer followed by 0.2 µm sterile filtration, 
filling, stoppering, capping inspection, labelling and packaging.  
The total process duration is defined. 
Reprocessing is not performed during the production of the finished product.

described in sufficient detail. All single-use material used in the finished product manufacturing process 
has been indicated. The control of critical steps and intermediates has been sufficiently described. CQA 
and CPP and IPCs have been defined.  
The microbial control strategy is in principle acceptable; however, the full data set supporting the hold 
times is pending (Specific obligation 2). 
Process performance qualification has been performed for three Scale A batches manufactured at the 
Catalent, US site (not  being registered for manufacture of product for the European market). For the 
relevant process steps, IPCs and process parameters have been monitored with  consistent results. 
Process qualification also includes aseptic manufacturing steps in the filling line which  is adequately 
controlled by regular media fills. 
For the Rovi site, which is the finished product manufacturing site (from bulk mRNA-loaded LNP 
intermediate to finished product) for the EU CMA, the PPQ is ongoing; only one batch has been 
manufactured to date. An adequate PPQ protocol has been submitted.  The available data indicate that 
the manufacturing process performs reliably and delivers product of adequate quality; however, the 
full data set including  at least 3  representative lots and including  a justification  of the hold times,

studies (i.e. Container Closure Integrity Testing (CCIT) qualification, filter validation, etc.). Results for 
CCI qualification  studies, acceptable data for the first  process validation batch and the Bacterial 
Challenge Filter  Validation Study have been provided. 
A concurrent validation approach will  be used due to the urgent need for this  product in the pandemic 
situation  and in light of the validation data already submitted this  is accepted.  
Control of excipients 
Lipid SM-102  is a novel excipient, not previously used in an approved finished product within  EU. 1,2-
distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) is a non-compendial excipient sufficiently controlled by 
an in-house specification. 
Cholesterol is controlled according to the  Ph. Eur. monograph 0993  with additional tests  for residual 
solvents and microbial contamination. However, the applicant is also referring to a non-compendial 
cholesterol. This should be clarified post-approval (REC). 
1,2-Dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (PEG2000 DMG),,)  is a novel 
excipient, not previously used in  an approved finished product within  EU. The other excipients 
(tromethamol, acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, sucrose and water for injections) are controlled 
according to  respective Ph. Eur. monograph or by in-house specifications (tromethamine 
hydrochloride).

Product specification 
mRNA-loaded LNP  intermediate   
The following attributes have been included in the specification for mRNA-1273 LNP:  appearance, 
mRNA identity by reverse transcription/Sanger sequencing, total  RNA content  by anion exchange 
chromatography, purity and product-related impurities  by RP-HPLC, % RNA encapsulation by 
absorbance assay, mean particle size and polydispersity by DLS, lipid  identity by UPLC-CAD (SM-102, 
cholesterol, DSPC, PEG2000-DMG),  lipid content by UPLC-CAD (SM-102,  cholesterol, DSPC, PEG2000-
DMG), lipid impurities by UPLC-CAD (%  individual impurities and sum of impurities), pH,  osmolality, 
bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur. 2.6.14,  kinetic chromogenic method) and bioburden (Ph. Eur. 2.6.12). 
A justification for each specification attribute has been provided. batches from Moderna, TX have been 
used to justify the acceptance criteria.  
As indicated above, the applicant has committed to providing an updated LNP  and finished product 
appearance testing description including the characterisation test of potentially occurring visible 
particles (Specific Obligation 1) 
Following  the request from the CHMP,  the applicant added numerical specification limits for product-
related impurities  in the specification for mRNA-loaded LNP  intermediate. 
As mentioned earlier, a commitment to  tighten the  specifications when more batch  analysis data from 
routine manufacturing are available has been provided. The applicant should establish final 
specifications for LNP and the finished product no later than 30-06-2021  (Specific Obligation 3).  
The mRNA-loaded LNP intermediate has been characterised with  the following techniques: mRNA 
encapsulation (absorbance assay) sub-micron LNP  size distributions,  size distributions),  sub-visible 
particles size distribution,  sub-visible particle concentration, surface characterisation, surface charge, 
and in vitro protein expression. The employed techniques are state-of-the-art  methods to  characterise 
lipid nanoparticles and it  can be concluded that  the lipid nanoparticles have been comprehensively 
characterised.  
Lipid impurities and degradants are monitored and quantified to ensure impurity levels are well-
controlled.  
Characterisation of mRNA-loaded LNP  intermediate identified  the presence of product variants and 
degradants derived from CX-024414 mRNA covalently linking to  LNP lipid impurities and degradants. 
These lipid-RNA  species render mRNA inactive and thus affect the potency of the product. 
The lipid-RNA species have been isolated for characterisation. By multiple orthogonal analyses the 
lipid-RNA species are analytically indistinguishable from unmodified mRNA and are not RNA 
aggregates. Stability studies under frozen liquid  and accelerated conditions have monitored these 
impurities. The characterisation of these impurities is well described. 
It was confirmed that  lipid modification is significant enough prevent protein expression from the 
particular mRNA molecule on which it  resides. 
Several actions have been undertaken to  optimise the  manufacturing processes of the lipid component 
SM-102  and mRNA-1273 LNP leading to a significant reduction in  potential lipid-RNA species. The 
applicant should provide a comprehensive summary of the investigations and process changes related 
to lipid-RNA species. The control strategy for lipid-RNA  species its implementation and plans for further 
improvement should be justified in more detail. Furthermore, the applicant should commit to  update 
the relevant Module  3 manufacturing development sections with this  information (REC).

endotoxin (Ph. Eur. 2.6.14,  kinetic chromogenic method) and sterility (Ph. Eur. 2.6.1).  Reference is 
made to  the FP stability section - mRNA-1273  LNP, for end of shelf-life specifications.  
For the appearance test, the presence of product-related particles is covered by the specification, 
although there have never been observed visible particles in the  finished product to date. As indicated 
above, the applicant committed to  provide an updated LNP and finished product appearance testing 
description including the characterisation test of potentially occurring visible particles as described 
earlier in the report (Specific Obligation 1). 
The presence of the 5´Cap structure and the polyA tail is controlled at release of CX-024414  mRNA; 
omission of these tests at finished product release has been sufficiently justified. 
Specifications are set relatively wide for a variety of release tests, although  batch release data 
demonstrate very consistent results which  would allow for tighter  limits. Following  a request from the 
CHMP,  the applicant tightened the  specification limit  for %RNA encapsulation addressing the CHMP 
concern since the included non-clinical data demonstrates strongly reduced protein expression for lots 
with  only that  value of RNA encapsulation. For the in-vitro translation test  the proposed specification 
for a MW  was also deemed too wide and was tightened.

The applicant was also requested to  add numerical specification limits  for the  product-related 
impurities and not only report them  as proposed. This was satisfactorily addressed by the applicant. 
These limits  may be further revised when batch  analysis data become available (Specific Obligation 
3). 
The originally proposed specification limit for RNA purity was deemed not acceptable. The first finished 
product batches (which include the clinical batches) had a purity higher than  the originally proposed 
limit.  The one finished product lot manufactured at Rovi also had higher purity.  This was raised as a 
MO together with  the shelf life claim and total  process duration. The applicant has analysed the 
influence of the  process duration on RNA purity.  The influence of the process duration on finished 
product CQA has been analysed. During the  procedure, the applicant provided phase III clinical data to 
support the end-of-shelf life limit of RNA purity. This data included efficacy data from a limited number 
of subjects receiving vaccine with  lower purity (at least one of the two  doses). The presented data did 
not show an association between breakthrough cases of COVID-19 from clinical trials and RNA purity 
level (within  the  ranges under discussion). In the Phase II study, comparable neutralising antibody 
responses were observed for subjects receiving effective doses of 40 and 79 µg. In addition,  in the 
non-clinical setting,  lots with  low purity were shown to  be as effective as lot  with higher purity. 
Considering the  totality of data, the proposed lower purity limit is considered to  be scientifically 
justified. Under consideration of the well-defined degradation kinetics, the  applicant proposes now 
higher release specification of purity that would  ensure acceptable RNA purity throughout  the shelf life. 
As indicated above, a commitment to  tighten  the specifications when more batch analysis data from 
routine manufacturing are available has been provided. The applicant should review the  specifications 
for CX-024414, LNP,  and the finished product no later than  30-06-2021  (Specific Obligation 3).  
The applicant has committed  to perform a risk assessment with  respect to the  potential presence of 
elemental impurities  in the finished product in line with  ICH Q3D (REC). 
The applicant provided a preliminary risk evaluation regarding potential nitrosamine contaminations in 
the finished product, which  is considered acceptable, but should be complemented with  a quantitative 
risk assessment, especially focusing on nanoparticle constituents.  (REC). 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used for control of the final product have been described and most validation 
reports for the Rovi site  are part of the  CMA dossier. Several requests related to the method 
descriptions and validations have been adequately addressed. The applicant is performing a dye 
ingress test  for CCI verification during the stability,  in lieu of sterility testing. The applicant has 
committed to provide a description of this CCI test and its validation by 31-03-2021  (Specific 
Obligation 2). For the in-vitro  translation assay and the  identity test,  validation reports are missing 
for Rovi and should be provided (respective reports are available for the  testing site ModernaTX used 
during the temporary exemption-ref. to  Annex II.A). The applicant has will provide them no later than 
31-01-2021  (REC). Non-compendial methods have been validated using appropriate validation 
parameters.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis results have been presented for Scale A batches from the Moderna, TX site used for 
phase III clinical trials,  for Scale A batches PPQ batches manufactured at the Catalent,  US site and for 
5 Scale B batch from Catalent  US site and for 1 Scale B batch from Rovi. All batches meet the pre-
defined specifications and the respective CoAs are included in the  dossier. Release data for the 
remaining PPQ lots from Rovi should be provided (Specific Obligation 2).

The CX-024414 reference material is described in the active substance (CX-024414)  section and will 
serve as the reference material for mRNA-1273 finished product testing  for the  total RNA content 
method by AEX-HPLC, the % purity method by RP-HPLC (system suitability)  and the in vitro translation 
assay/methionine labelling assay (positive control).  
For the Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with  Charged Aerosol Detection (UPLC-CAD) 
method for lipid identification, lipid  content and lipid impurity a lipid reference standard is used. 
Stability of the product 
mRNA-loaded LNP  intermediate   
The mRNA-loaded LNP intermediate stability  program was executed according to ICH Q1A (R2) and 
ICH Q5C.  
Stability samples manufactured per the  commercial process were stored in containers made of the 
same materials as the commercial closure system. Samples were stored at -60°C to  -90°C (long term 
conditions) for up to 4 months  and 5°C ±  3°C (accelerated conditions) for 1 month.  
Samples were tested using  suitable stability-indicating  assays for appearance, total RNA content, 
purity, product-related impurities, % RNA encapsulation, lipid identity, lipid  content, lipid  impurities, 
mean particle size, polydispersity, pH, osmolality, bacterial endotoxin and residual solvent (ethanol). 
Up to now,  all results are within  specifications.  
Data have been generated from one development lot, one clinical lot and three PPQ lots All lots were 
manufactured at ModernaTX, Inc. Additional stability data will  be provided post-approval.  
The applicant will include all PPQ batches manufactured by Lonza AG, CH into the stability  programme. 
Section 3.2.S.7.2 ‘Post-approval stability  protocol and stability commitments’  will be updated post-
approval (REC). 
Stability studies in support of mRNA-loaded LNP  intermediate freeze-thaw cycling were performed 
using the development lot. The results show that  the mRNA-1273  LNP biophysical attributes (particle 
size, polydispersity, encapsulation) are not impacted by the  different freeze-thaw processes (room 
temperature or 2°C to 8°C) or 5 cycles of freeze-thaw. 
The proposed shelf-life is considered acceptable. 
 Finished product  
A finished product shelf-life of 7 months at -20°C  including a period of 30 days at 2°C - 8°C (protected 
from light)  plus 12  hours at 8°C to  25°C (see product information for specific details) is proposed.  
The finished product stability program was executed according to  ICH Q1A (R2) and ICH Q5C.  
Data from mRNA-1273  Phase 1, Phase 2, engineering and Phase 3 and commercial supplies were 
provided. The mRNA-1273 development studies include lots representative of the GMP scales 
manufactured at ModernaTX, Inc. (Norwood, MA). Samples were stored in a container made of the 
same materials as the commercial closure system. 
Samples were stored at -60°C to  -90°C for up 6 months, -20°C ±  5°C (intended long-term condition) 
for up to 6 months, 2°C - 8°C (intended  short-term condition) for up to 5 months, 25°C  ± 2°C 
(accelerated condition) for up to 72h.  
Samples were tested using  suitable stability-indicating  assays for appearance, RNA identification,  total 
RNA content, purity,  product-related impurities, % RNA encapsulation, lipid identity,  lipid content,  lipid

impurities, mean particle size, polydispersity, pH,  in vitro translation, osmolality, particulate matter, 
bacterial endotoxin and bioburden. However, not all tests  are performed at every time point. 
Stability data up to 6  months for two  developmental lots and up to 4 months for clinical/PPQ lots  at 
different temperatures is available to date. These batches represent Scale A lots manufactured at 
Moderna and Catalent  in the US. No stability data from Rovi, EU  batches are available so far. As stated 
by the applicant, RNA purity in the finished product is clearly temperature sensitive and represents the 
most important stability-indicating  parameter. In addition,  the parameters product-related impurities 
and particle size are also impacted. For all stability lots, results showed no change of these parameters 
when stored at -70°C for up to 6 months. For  lots stored at -20°C,  a slight decrease in RNA purity  and 
an increase in process-derived impurities and an increase in particle size can be observed over time; 
all results were within  the specification. At higher storage temperatures, RNA degradation is 
accelerated, as expected. At 2°C  - 8°C after 4 weeks a clear reduction of purity (together with  increase 
of product-related impurities and increase of particle size) is measured, A statistical model aligned with 
the WHO  2006 guidance document, Guidelines on Stability Evaluation of Vaccines, is being applied for 
the finished product The degradation rates and associated variance estimates were used to calculate 
an internal Minimum  Release Limit (MRL)  for purity. This limit  supports up to 7 months of storage at -
15°C to -25°C  that can include up to 1 month  of storage of the unopened vial at 2°C to 8°C (protected 
from light),  plus 12  hours at 8°C  to 25°C. Reference is made to the approved product information for 
precise details of the respective storage periods and permitted in-use storage. 
The applicant first proposed a staggered shelf life approach, which  defined the  shelf-life dependent on 
the RNA purity at release and whether lots were being tested before or after packaging. This approach 
was not considered practical nor in  line with  EU  expectations and was withdrawn by the applicant in 
response to a major objection. A preliminary shelf life of 7 months at -20°C including  a period of 30 
days at 2°C -  8°C plus in-use time of up to  12 hours at RT was subsequently proposed and justified by 
the available stability data. A post-approval stability  protocol and stability commitment  has been 
provided. This should also include final photostability  results. Nevertheless, the applicant should 
provide periodic updates on the stability  data and completion of the study should be provided for the 
PPQ lots  from Rovi stored at -20°C followed by a period at 2°C - 8°C. (Specific Obligation 3). 
Stability studies in support of finished product freeze-thaw cycling were also performed. The freeze-
thaw cycling was repeated up to five times. All results were within  the specification and indicate that 
the final product is relatively stable with  regard to repeated freeze-thaw steps support five freeze/thaw 
cycles. Repeated freeze-thaw of vials upon marketing is however, not permitted  in the approved 
product information. 
Upon request from CHMP,  preliminary results from a photostability study performed in accordance with 
ICH Q1B were presented. Final  results will be submitted to  the Agency. The presented data show that 
the mRNA is sensitive to  excessive light exposure but  can be handled under normal room lighting 
conditions without  affecting product quality for at least 2 days of normal light  exposure at 25°C. A 
precautionary statement regarding light  exposure has been included in the SmPC. 
In-use stability studies were also performed. The finished product (vial) was held at room temperature 
for either 1 hour or 7 hours after thaw.  Dosing syringes were prepared from the vial after 1 hour and 
then again after 7 hours upon completion of a 1-hour thaw at room temperature. The syringes were 
then held for 0, 4, 8, and 12 hours at room temperature and refrigerated conditions. All attributes 
remained within  the acceptance criteria when held in a vial for up to 7 hours at room temperature after 
first puncture, followed by storage in a syringe for up to 12 hours supporting the approved in-use 
stability instructions  of up to for 6 hours at 2  to 25ºC, in the product information. 
Clinical in-use stability was also demonstrated for 6 hours after first puncture of the vial followed by 8 
hours in the syringe at either ambient temperature or at storage between 2°C  to 8°C. The data 
Assessment report

support the chemical and physical in-use stability for 6 hours at  2 to 25ºC after first puncture claimed 
in the product information. 
A finished product shelf-life of 7 months at -20°C  including a period of 30 days at 2°C - 8°C (protected 
from light),  plus 12  hours at 8°C  to 25°C (see product information for specific details) is accepted. 
Adventitious agents 
Section 3.2.A.2 should be updated to include information as regards control of sterility and a statement 
as regards compliance with EMEA/410/01  Rev.3 requirements. The applicant has committed to do so 
no later than 31-03-2021  (REC). 
There are no materials of animal or human origin used in the  manufacture of the active substance or 
finished product. 
The manufacturing process description for active substance and finished product also documents the 
microbial control strategy- see Microbiological attributes  section under Description of the product and 
Pharmaceutical Development - Manufacturing process development- (mRNA-1273 LNP).

Not  applicable.  
Regional information 
Process validation schemes for LNP (Lonza, Visp) and the finished product (Rovi, Spain) have been 
provided the dossier. A concurrent validation approach will be used for initial Scale B process and Scale 
B due to  the urgent need for this product.  The rationale for this  approach is documented. This 
concurrent approach requires interim reports to be documented for each individual validation run.  An 
overall report per site will be compiled that  summarizessummarises all evaluations and contains a 
comparability assessment of the data of all batches manufactured. Finally, a concluding report linked 
to this  plan will be written that  summarises all findings from the different validation reports. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical aspects and biological 
aspects 
During the  procedure, a number of  issues were highlighted  relating  to:  GMP status  of the  manufacture 
of the active substance and of the testing  sites of the finished product for the purpose of batch  release, 
the comparability between clinical and commercial material, and the absence of data on finished product 
manufactured at the commercial site.  
These issues were classified as Major Objections (MOs)  in order to ensure completion of the data set 
by the applicant at appropriate time points.  Further MOs were raised regarding the potential  presence 
of visible particles in the mRNA-loaded LNP  intermediate and final product and regarding the  proposed 
RNA purity at release and at  the end of shelf life. EU GMP certificates for the manufacturing and testing 
sites were subsequently obtained. This MO was therefore resolved.  
Data have been submitted  by the  applicant during the procedure in relation to the Major Objections, 
while a number of specific obligations (SOs) are identified  as necessary in order to complete the  quality 
documentation. Further  information is provided below on the resolution of the major objections and the 
rational for accepting a number of open issues to  be addressed as specific obligations post-marketing. 
Several other issues are further highlighted as Recommendations to be addressed by the applicant 
post-approval.

The CTD Module 3 dossier structure currently describes the mRNA, the lipid  excipients and the lipid 
nanoparticles in  3.2.S. During the procedure, the BWP confirmed that the  mRNA (referred to by the 
applicant as CX-024414) should be considered as the  active substance as per Directive 2001/83/EC 
and this was accepted by the applicant. Although  the current dossier structure would require 
adjustment to meet EU CTD requirements, there are no associated risks for GMP or product quality  at 
the time of authorisation. In order to bring the  current dossier structure in line with  EU CTD 
requirements the company should update the Module 3 CTD structure  in line with the  agreed active 
substance and finished product definitions  (REC 1.1).  
In addition, it  should be ensured that, in  accordance with Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC  and Article 
16 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004,  the  active substance and finished product are manufactured and 
controlled by means of processes and methods in compliance with  the latest state of scientific and 
technical progress. As a consequence, the manufacturing processes and controls (including  the 
specifications) shall be designed to ensure product consistency and a product quality of at least shown 
to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials and shall introduce any subsequent changes to  their 
manufacturing process and controls as needed. 
Active substance 
The major part of the dossier is of acceptable quality. However, certain information and data 
requirements remain to be provided, due to  the very short time frame of product development. These 
data will be submitted  in the closing sequence or further addressed in specific obligations and other 
post-approval measures (recommendations). Information on the manufacturing process and process 
controls for the  manufacturing sites Lonza, Visp, and Rovi is provided. 
Biological characterisation of the active substance was provided and certain points need to be 
addressed post-approval. Since these outstanding  data form the basis of the determination of 
comparability for scale-up and transfer of manufacturing processes for the active substance, additional 
data are requested as Specific Obligation 1. 
Several active substance processes have been used during the  development; from personalised 
vaccine unit  to Process Scale A (clinical trial material) and initial Scale B. The major change was from 
PVU process to the Scale A process, including the addition  of two  tangential flow filtration  unit 
operations for the Scale A process. No changes were made to the  unit operations or sequence of unit 
operations from Scale A to initial Scale B processes. Major Objections in relation to insufficient 
validation data for the active substance manufacturing process (initial scale B) resulted in Specific 
Obligation 2. 
In the initial  Rolling Review submission, PPQ data from the  Scale A and initial  Scale B from the US 
manufacturing sites was provided. In a second submission data from one batch  manufactured at 
Lonza, Visp included. The data from the EU manufacturing batch showed a good comparability to the 
PPQ lots  from the US sites. The complete PPQ/validation of Lonza, Visp will be provided post-approval 
via a Specific Obligation 2. 
The proposed specification for active substance is acceptable with  respect to the  attributes chosen for 
routine release testing in the  context of the  pandemic situation.  However, the active substance 
specifications acceptance limits  should be re-assessed, and revised as appropriate, as further data 
becomes available from ongoing clinical trials and in line with  manufacturing process capability. 
Although the  stability data were limited,  the applicant has demonstrated a good understanding  of the 
mode and rate of degradation. and the data available justify the current shelf life. To supplement the 
knowledge on stability,  further data are requested as Specific Obligation 3. 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 38/169 
 
 
 
 
The proposed initial shelf life for the  active substance is 6 months at the recommended storage 
temperature of -20°C.   
Finished product 
The finished product is a multi-dose (10-dose) ready-to-use dispersion for intramuscular injection of 
mRNA embedded in lipid nanoparticles (LNP). 
The formulation development studies of the mRNA containing lipid nanoparticles have been sufficiently 
described. 
The development of the manufacturing process is sufficiently described, and critical process 
parameters are defined. 
The manufacturing process includes lipid  nanoparticle fabrication followed by fill and finish (at  Rovi). 
The processes have been acceptably described. 
Comparability between the commercial finished product and the clinical finished product has been 
sufficiently demonstrated for a CMA for the attributes  tested. Limited  data on the  intermediate and 
finished product batches manufactured at the commercial facility Lonza, Visp and Rovi (EU market) 
were presented, since so far only one PPQ batch of the intermediates and the final product has been 
produced. 
Although initial  information has been provided to support comparability of LNP  intermediate, the 
applicant should provide comparability results including  extended characterisation data using the full 
panel of characterisation methods from all PPQ batches manufactured by Lonza AG, CH  demonstrating 
that  the commercial product manufactured at the  Lonza, Visp site is representative of the material 
used in the clinical trials. (Specific Obligation2). 
For the finished product, results are available for one scale B lot manufactured at the finished product 
manufacturing site for the EU market (Rovi, Spain) therefore, although there is sufficient comparability 
information to justify approval in this  pandemic, no final conclusion can be drawn with  regard to Scale 
A to Scale B comparability. The final validation report including an assessment of comparability is 
therefore requested in a specific obligation (Specific Obligation 2). 
Process validation (PPQ) for commercial scale batches were initiated, and a summary report from one 
PPQ validation batch was provided. The reported results were comparable to the PPQ batches from the 
US sites. Further data was requested in order to conclude on the consistency of finished product 
manufacturing, to assure comparability between the  commercial product with the  product produced at 
the US sites that  was also used in clinical trials, and to support the claimed finished product shelf-life 
and storage conditions. A process validation plan for PPQ lots has been provided. A concurrent 
validation approach will be used due to  the urgent need for this product and the  pandemic situation. 
The rationale for this approach has been documented.  
An overall PPQ report, which also includes comparability data, will be submitted when data from three 
consecutive batches manufactured at  Lonza, Visp and Rovi will  be available. In summary, an 
acceptable validation program has been established and an interim  report from one PPQ validation 
batch was provided, therefore the information on process validation is considered acceptable subject to 
a specific obligation for submission of the  remaining data (Specific Obligation 2). 
The specification document for finished product includes a comprehensive panel of relevant tests along 
with  corresponding acceptance criteria. Several issues in relation to the  acceptance criteria in the 
finished product specifications were raised in the 1st Quality data submission, i.e. the LNP size, 
polydispersity, RNA encapsulation, in-vitro expression. In addition,  open questions regarding the 
regarding the clinical justification  of the proposed minimum acceptable RNA purity were discussed in 
Assessment report

an oral explanation. during the evaluation. Whilst finished product specifications were subsequently 
amended and overall found to be acceptable, the acceptance limits  should be re-assessed, and revised 
as appropriate, as further data becomes available (Specific Obligation 3). In addition, the applicant 
should provide an updated appearance testing description for LNP  and finished product including  the 
characterisation test  of potentially occurring visible particles since these have not  been clinically 
qualified (Specific Obligation 2).  
The proposed initial shelf life for the  finished product of shelf life of 7 months  at -20°C including  a 
period of 30 days at 2°C - 8°C is found acceptable, but  should be confirmed by further stability data 
from lots  manufactured at the  Rovi site (Specific Obligation 3). 
The applicant is performing a dye ingress test  for cCCI verification during the stability,  in lieu of 
sterility testing.  The applicant has committed to  provide a description of this CCI test and its validation 
(Specific Obligation 2).  
Two novel excipients are included in the LNP.  Limited information is provided for both the lipid SM-102 
and the PEGylated lipid  PEG200-DMG. Although this is sufficiently supportive for conditional marketing 
authorisation, in order to assure comprehensive control throughout  the lifecycle of the finished product 
and to ensure batch-to-batch  consistency, further information needs to be submitted regarding the 
synthetic process and control strategy in  line with raised recommendations (Specific Obligation 1). 
2.2.5.  Impact on the benefit-risk assessment: 
Efficacy, safety and  immunogenicity  was demonstrated using  clinical  batches of  vaccine manufactured 
at Scale A. The commercial batches are produced using an up-scale process (initial Scale B for the active 
substance,  Scale  B  for  the  finished  product),  and  the  comparability  of  these  processes  rely  on 
demonstration  of  comparable biological,  chemical and  physical  characteristics  of  the  active  substance 
and finished product. 
The characterisation and  control  of active substance  and finished  product  are acceptable in  relation to 
critical quality attributes  and impurities.   
The control strategy for active substance and finished product is essential to guarantee acceptable quality 
and ensure batch-to-batch  consistency of the finished product. Regarding the proposed control strategy, 
questions were raised with regards to the acceptance criteria for some tests. However, the data provided 
so far, including  specifications and in-process controls, assure an overall consistent good quality  of the 
product  and  the  potential  risks  founded  on  data  not  yet  available  are  considered  to  be  very  low. 
Therefore, control of the active substance and finished product is considered acceptable. 
While some of the characterisation data still  need to  be completed, the characterisation of the active 
substance and finished product are considered acceptable subject to specific obligation, and the 
proposed specifications for RNA purity and is considered scientifically justified and acceptable subject 
to specific obligation.  
2.2.6.  Conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this medicinal product, submitted in the  emergency context of the current (COVID-19) 
pandemic, is considered to  be sufficiently consistent and acceptable subject to specific obligations.  
In general, physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the clinical performance of the  product 
have been investigated and are controlled in an acceptable way. While some of the characterisation 
data still need to be completed, the  results of tests carried out  indicate consistency of product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn  lead to the conclusion that  from a quality perspective the product is 
expected to have a satisfactory clinical performance. 
Assessment report

The submitted information indicate that  currently manufactured product batches are of a quality that  is 
appropriate and sufficiently comparable to that of clinical development batches. However, to  ensure 
that  the quality of future batches will also remain appropriate and comparable to that of clinical 
development batches over the life cycle of the medicinal product a number of issues are expected to 
be addressed though fulfilment of specific obligations,  within  defined time frames.  
The CHMP has identified the following specific obligations to address the identified quality 
developments issues that  may have a potential  impact on the safe and effective use of the  medicinal 
product, and which therefore are needed to achieve comprehensive pharmaceutical (quality) data and 
controls for the  product. The specific points that  need to be addressed in order to fulfil the  imposed 
specific obligations are detailed below. 
In accordance with Article 16 of regulation (EC) No 726/2004,  the MAH  shall inform the Agency of any 
information which might  influence the quality of the medicinal product concerned, such as any 
necessary tightening of the finished product specifications earlier than July 2021.  This is also related to 
the general obligation  to vary the terms of the marketing authorisation to take into account the 
technical and scientific progress and enable the medicinal product to be manufactured and checked by 
means of generally accepted scientific methods. 
To complete the quality documentation in the framework of the conditional marketing authorisation, the 
applicant should fulfil the  following specific obligations (SOs) post-approval. 
•  SO1:  In  order  to  complete  the  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product 
manufacturing  processes, the  applicant  should  provide  additional  data.  no  later  than  01-02-
2021. 
•  SO2:  In  order  to  confirm  the  consistency  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product 
manufacturing  process  (Initial  and  final  scales),  the  applicant  should  provide  additional 
comparability  and  validation  data. no  later  than  30-04-2021.  Interim  reports will  be  provided 
monthly prior to this date. 
•  SO3:  In  order  to  ensure  consistent  product  quality,  the  applicant  should  provide  additional

2.2.7.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs  to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP  recommends additional points for investigation,  as listed in  Annex I of this  document. 
Note:  The active substance is the mRNA CX-024414.  However, in the submitted  dossier, the 
information on the LNP have not been provided in the correct section of the dossier. An update of the 
current dossier structure should be provided (see REC1.1). The references in the list  of 
recommendations relate to  the current structure of the  dossier. It is recommended (REC1.1), that  all 
information pertaining to the LNP  should be moved in adequate sections of 3.2.P. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Non-clinical immunogenicity and protective activity of mRNA-1273  have been evaluated in young mice 
(Balb/c, Balb/cJ, C57BL/6,  and B6C3F1/J),  aged mice (Balb/c), Syrian golden hamsters, and rhesus 
macaques. The potential of mRNA-1273-associated enhancement of the respiratory disease was also 
addressed in these animal models. The animal models that were used are considered suitable for the 
assessment of the immunogenicity, efficacy and safety of mRNA-1273. 
No studies on the secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology, and pharmacodynamics drug 
interactions have been performed, which is in accordance with applicable guidelines. 
Regarding the test  item, mRNA-1273  is a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based 
vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. mRNA-1273 encodes for the full-length  S protein of SARS-CoV-2, 
modified to introduce 2 proline residues in  order to stabilise the S protein in a prefusion conformation 
(S-2P). The mRNA is encapsulated in LNPs through  a modified ethanol-drop nanoprecipitation process.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Immunogenicity studies 
In rodents (mice, hamsters) and nonhuman primates (NHPs),  mRNA-1273  elicited robust humoral 
immune responses in a dose-dependent manner, following intramuscular administrations. This is 
evidenced for the  S-2P-binding IgG responses measured in Enzyme-Linked-Immunosorbent Assays 
(ELISAs), and equally also for the neutralising antibodies when assayed using either homotypic SARS-
CoV-2 pseudovirus or live virus plaque reduction neutralisation test. The induced antibodies were 
shown to be specific for the Receptor-Binding-Domain and S1_N Terminal Domain of the Spike protein 
in mRNA-1273-vaccinated mice and NHPs.  The post-boost binding and neutralising antibody titres 
induced by the  mRNA-1273 prime-boost schedule were generally higher than  the post-prime titres 
induced on the prime-only schedule across the tested species (rodents, NHPs) and regardless of strains 
and age of mice tested.  
In two studies in young Balb/c mice, a strong positive correlation between S-2P-binding IgG titres  and 
neutralising antibody titres induced by mRNA-1273 was observed. In general, a higher dose of mRNA-
1273  was required for induction  of detectable neutralising titres in  mice and NHPs  than for induction  of 
detectable binding IgG response. 
To assess the potential risk for Vaccine-induced Enhancement of Disease (VAED) for mRNA-1273,  the 
type of T helper responses (Th1 vs Th2) was evaluated in  mRNA-1273 immunised mice and NHPs, 
based on IgG subclasses measured by ELISA (IgG2a, IgG1, IgG2a/IgG1, young and aged Balb/c mice), 
and/or T-cell cytokines (e.g. IFN-g,  IL-2,  TNF-a; IL-4,  IL-5, IL-10, IL-13,  etc) measured by intracellular 
cytokine straining  (ICS) and FACS (in  young Balb/c mice, in NHPs). In mice, high IgG1 subclass with 
low or no IgG2a (Balb/c) is associated with a Th2 response, whereas a balanced IgG2a/IgG1 ratio is 
indicative of a Th1-directed response. The vaccine was shown  to elicit a balanced IgG2a/IgG1 ratio in 
the immunised young and aged Balb/c mice, which is indicative of a Th1-skewed response. Consistent 
with  this, vaccination of young mice with  mRNA-1273 drove a Th1-directed CD4+ T cell response to 
both S1 and S2 overlapping peptide pools that  encompass the entire S protein of the SARS-CoV-2, 
characterised by IFN-g/IL-2/TNF-a-producing  T cells. Robust Th1-directed CD8+ T cell response to S1 
peptide pool (but not  S2 peptide pool) was also evident in vaccinated young mice. Overall, the 
frequency of S-derived peptides-specific CD4+ and CD8+ Th2 cytokine secreting cells (e.g. IL-4, IL-5, 
IL-13) were lower than  Th1-directed T cells in mRNA-1273-vaccinated mice.  
In NHPs, mRNA-1273  was shown to induce substantial Th1-directed CD4+ T cells as well as IL-21-
producing follicular helper (Tfh) cell response to the SARS-CoV-2 S1 peptide pool, in a dose-dependent

manner. There was no evidence of a Th2-directed CD4+ T cell response induced in the vaccinated 
NHPs.  No analysis on S1-specific CD8+ T cells was performed in these NHP studies. 
Challenge studies 
The protective activity of mRNA-1273 was evaluated in  challenge-protection studies in young and aged 
Balb/c mice, hamsters and NHPs.  Three weeks post-boost,  hamsters were challenged i.n. with  105 PFU 
of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus. Four weeks post-boost  (5 weeks for young mice), aged and young 
mice were challenged with  mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus (i.n.  103 PFU in aged mice; i.n.  105 PFU 
in young mice), and NHPs  with  wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (i.t. and i.n.,  7.6x105 PFU).  
A clear dose-dependent protection was demonstrated in  all animal challenge studies.  
In aged mice, 1 µg dose of mRNA-1273  on prime-boost schedule completely protected mice from virus 
replication in the lungs at Days 2 and 4 post-challenge and prevented body weight  loss at  Day 4 post-
challenge. Full  protection against lung  inflammation and lung  haemorrhage was also evident. The 0.1 
µg dose conferred partial protection, consistent  with a lower immune response compared to the  1 µg 
dose group.  
In young mice, 1 or 10 µg dose of mRNA-1273  conferred complete protection from virus replication in 
the lungs at  Day 2 post-challenge, with  0.1  µg dose conferring partial protection. In this  model, a clear 
effect on lung  histopathology was evident even for the 0.1 µg  and 0.01  µg doses.  
In hamsters, mRNA-1273  was shown to protect animals from body weight  loss and viral infection, 
respectively, by Day 6 and Day 4 post-challenge. The protected animals, receiving 1, 5,  and 25  µg of 
mRNA-1273  on a prime/boost schedule, displayed mean viral titres below the limit  of detection in the 
lungs and nasal turbinate at Day 4 post-challenge, and all but one in the 1 µg prime-boost group had 
no detectable viral replication (sgRNA) in the lungs by Day 4 post-challenge. Consistent with  these 
findings, the  lung pathological changes were generally milder in the vaccinated hamsters compared to 
the control animals.  
In nonhuman primates, IM administration of mRNA-1273 at 30  µg dose on a prime-boost schedule or 
100 µg  dose on a prime-only schedule conferred complete protection from virus replication in the  lungs 
at Day 2 post-challenge. The 2.5 µg prime-boost dose provided partial protection, consistent  with 
suboptimal immune responses. Although breakthrough virus replication in the lungs was detected in 
this low  dose group of animals, the lung  histopathological analyses did not  reveal enhanced lung 
inflammation compared to control animals. In another study, 100  µg of mRNA-1273 on a prime-boost 
schedule completely protected animals from virus replication in the lungs at Day 4 post-challenge. This 
protective effect was further substantiated by post-challenge assessments of the bronchoalveolar 
lavage (BAL) IgG and cytokines/chemokines, post-challenge neutralising titres, or lung histopathology 
data. Breakthrough virus replication in the  lungs was detected at Day 2 post-challenge in both  10 µg 
and 100 µg dose groups in  this study, however, lung histopathology analyses in these breakthrough 
animals did not reveal enhanced lung inflammation compared to control animals. 
The aggregate data of challenge-protection studies do not indicate a sign of disease enhancement risk 
for mRNA-1273, when compared to controls including  PBS group. Specifically, all challenge-protection 
studies conducted in mice, hamsters and NHPs did  not show increased infiltrate of the eosinophils in 
the lung of the vaccinated animals. 
Efforts have been made to explore a surrogate of protection in challenge protection studies using 2-3 
dose levels of mRNA-1273,  in order to achieve full and partial protection. However, no clear conclusion 
could be made at this moment.

Safety pharmacology programme 
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies with mRNA-1273  were conducted. This is considered 
acceptable in light  of the lack of signals on vital organ functions from the completed GLP repeat-dose 
toxicity studies and clinical studies submitted with  mRNA-1273,  as recommended by applicable 
vaccines guidelines (e.g. WHO Guidelines on Nonclinical  Evaluation of Vaccines).  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No dedicated ADME studies with mRNA-1273  were conducted, which  is acceptable as generally 
nonclinical PK studies are not relevant to  support the development and licensure of vaccine for 
infectious diseases. However, distribution  studies should be conducted in the case of new formulations 
or novel excipients used. 
Accordingly, the biodistribution  of the vaccine platform was evaluated with mRNA-1647  in a non-GLP, 
single-dose, intramuscular injection study in Sprague Dawley rats. The objectives of this study were to 
determine the  tissue distribution  and pharmacokinetic characteristics of mRNA-1647  constructs 
following IM administration. 
mRNA-1647  contains 6 mRNAs, which  encode the full length  CMV glycoprotein B (gB), and the 
pentameric glycoprotein H (gH)/glycoprotein L  (gL)/UL128/UL130/UL131A  glycoprotein complex 
(Pentamer). The 6 mRNA are formulated at a target mass ratio of 1:1:1:1:1:1  in the  Sponsor’s 
standard proprietary SM-102–containing  LNPs. It is biologically plausible that  the distribution  of the 
mRNA vaccine is determined by the lipid nanoparticle content, whereas the  influence of the mRNA itself 
is considered very limited. Therefore, it is acceptable that  the biodistribution  study was performed with 
the same lipid  nanoparticles containing another mRNA (i.e. mRNA-1647). 
The amount of the LNPs in the test  material differed slightly in particle size from the final vaccine 
formulation of mRNA-1273. Even though it  is not straightforward to understand the impact that  the 
different particle size might have on mRNA tissue distribution,  if any, nevertheless the liver distribution 
is not affected because the average diameter of endothelial fenestrae in the liver sinusoids in the test 
system (Sprague–Dawley rats) is 161 nm. The observed biodistribution with  smaller LNP  particle size 
should thus represent a worst-case scenario. 
A qualified multiplex branched DNA (bDNA) assay was used for determination of mRNA in various 
tissues in the biodistribution  study conducted with  mRNA-1647. The LLOQ of the method were set at 
0.05  ng/mL for the  gB mRNA and UL130  mRNA, and 0.01 ng/mL  for the gH,  gL, UL128  and UL131A 
mRNAs. Following single IM injection  at 100 µg mRNA-1647,  subgroups of 5 rats were sequentially 
sacrificed pre-dose and 2, 8, 24,  48, 72, and 120 hours after dosing, for quantitation  of 6 mRNA 
constructs in blood and a pre-specified set of organs/tissues. 
Concentrations of mRNA-1647  were quantifiable in  the majority of tissues examined at the first time 
point collected (2 hours post-dose) and peak concentrations were reached between 2-  and 24-hours 
post-dose in tissues with exposures above that  of plasma. Besides injection site [muscle] and lymph 
nodes [proximal and distal], increased mRNA concentrations (compared to  plasma levels) were found 
in the spleen and eye. Both tissues were examined in the frame of the toxicological studies conducted 
with  mRNA-1273 final vaccine formulation. Low  levels of mRNA could be detected in all examined 
tissues except the kidney. This included heart, lung,  testis and also brain tissues, indicating  that the 
mRNA/LNP platform crossed the blood/brain barrier, although to very low levels (2-4%  of the plasma 
level). Liver distribution  of mRNA-1647  is also evident in this  study, consistent with  the literature 
reports that  liver is a common target  organ of LNPs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021

The T1/2 of mRNA-1647  was reliably estimated in muscle (site of injection), proximal popliteal and 
axillary distal lymph nodes and spleen with average T1/2 values for all vaccine components of 14.9, 
34.8,  31.1 and 63.0 hours, respectively. mRNA-1647 was rapidly cleared from plasma during the  first 
24 hours with  the T1/2 estimated in  a range of 2.7  - 3.8 hours. The mean concentrations of all vaccine 
components became undetectable after 24 hours, except for gH, which  was detectable up to  the last 
time point  of 120  hours but  which was also detectable in 2 pre-dose plasma samples. The mRNA 
constructs were not  measurable after maximum 3 days in tissues other than the muscle, lymph nodes, 
and spleen (~25  hours in brain). 
Reference with regards to the mRNA biodistribution  is made to  the respective adverse findings 
observed in rat spleens in toxicological studies.  No adverse findings were detected in the 
ophthalmological examinations or the brain/CNS. 
No dedicated studies on absorption, metabolism, and excretion for mRNA-1273 have been submitted. 
This is generally acceptable with  regards to the nature of the vaccine product. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The applicant submitted product specific and non-product specific studies; the latter  studies were 
conducted with  mRNA vaccine candidates that  are based on the same LNP-technology as applied in 
mRNA-1273.   
Repeat dose toxicity 
The following seven repeated dose toxicity studies were submitted: 
- Study 2308-123:  Non-GLP compliant study examining the repeated dose toxicology of mRNA-1273; 
- Study 5002045:  GLP-compliant study examining the  repeated dose toxicology of mRNA-1706,  a LNP 
product containing mRNA that  encodes the pre-membrane and envelope structural proteins of Zika 
virus; 
- Study 5002231:  GLP-compliant study examining the  repeated dose toxicology of mRNA-1706,  an LNP 
product containing mRNA that  encodes encoding the prME structural proteins of Zika virus; 
- Study 5002033:  GLP-compliant study examining the  repeated dose toxicology of mRNA-1653,  a 
mRNA vaccine product containing 2 distinct  mRNA sequences that  encode the full-length  membrane-
bound fusion proteins of human  metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus type 3; 
- Study 5002400:  GLP-compliant study examining the  repeated dose toxicology of mRNA-1893,  a LNP-
mRNA vaccine candidate that encodes the prME  structural proteins of Zika virus; 
- Study 5002034:  GLP-compliant study examining the  repeated dose toxicology of mRNA-1647,  a LNP 
product containing an equal fraction of 6 mRNAs which  encode the full-length  cytomegalovirus 
glycoprotein B (gB) and the pentameric gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131A  glycoprotein complex; 
- Study 5002158:  GLP-compliant study examining the  repeated dose toxicology of mRNA-1443,  a LNP 
product containing a single mRNA sequence that encodes for a phosphorylation mutant  of the CMV 
phosphoprotein 65 protein. 
In all studies the control group was treated with  Phosphate-buffered Saline (PBS). 
The product-specific Study 2308-123  was not conducted in GLP-compliance, and exhibits major 
procedural/methodological limitations. In principle these aspects would render this  study inadequate 
for evaluating the repeated dose toxicity of mRNA-1273 to the  extent recommended in relevant 
guidance on non-clinical development of vaccine products. However, as no clear differences in toxicity

are observed between study 2308-123  and the repeated dose toxicity studies conducted with  other 
LNP-mRNA products, the  latter studies are considered sufficient to support clinical development and 
MAA.  
The six submitted  non-product-specific (but LNP-specific) repeated dose toxicity studies were 
conducted in GLP-compliance and meet the recommended criteria set out by relevant guidelines. 
Considering that  the translated antigens of the evaluated mRNA-products are expected to elicit similar 
immunologic reactions, and considering that all these products are based on the same LNP technology, 
the extent of the submitted  repeated dose toxicity programme is deemed acceptable. In the light  of 
this statement,  the GLP and procedural/methodological limitations of study 2308-123  are accepted. 
In all studies, at least 2 - 4 doses of the product were applied to male and female Sprague Dawely rats 
(n = 5 per group and sex in Study 2308-123,  n = 10 per group and sex in the other studies) by 
intramuscular administration, dosing ranged from 9 to 150  μg mRNA/dose. Apart from study 2308-123 
in which  only in-life endpoints, haematology and binding  antibodies were analysed, clinical endpoints, 
ophthalmology examinations, clinical pathology parameters (haematology, coagulation, and clinical 
chemistry), post-mortem examinations (necropsy, histo(path)ology), neutralising antibodies and 
cytokine analysis (usually different interleukins, interferon gamma, acute-phase proteins) were 
generally assessed in the remaining studies.  Reversibility of effects was generally studied after a two 
weeks recovery period. 
In general, the repeated dose toxicology of the tested products proved to be quite similar among the 
studies, supporting that  observed toxicities were not product specific, but rather caused by the 
immunologic responses towards the  translated antigens, and potentially by a contribution  of the  novel 
LNP formulation. Test article-related adverse effects were observed at all tested concentrations, dose-
dependency was frequently observed.  
The following test-article related observations were generally noted in the submitted  rat toxicity: 
Test article-related in-life observations observed at ≥9 µg/dose included reversible or reversing 
erythema and oedema at the injection site and transient increase in body temperature at 6 hours post-
dose returning  to baseline 24 hours post-dose. 
Haematology changes included increase in white blood cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils and 
decreased lymphocytes; coagulation changes included increase in fibrinogen and activated partial 
thromboplastin time; and clinical chemistry changes included decrease in albumin, increase in globulin, 
and a corresponding decrease in albumin/globulin  ratio. Clinical pathology changes generally reversed 
or were reversing by the end of the 2-week recovery period. 
Test article-related transient cytokine increases were observed at ≥9µg/dose  at 6 hours post-dose 
including IFN-γ-induced  protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein, and macrophage inflammatory 
protein 1 α. Cytokine changes were generally reversing by the  end of the 2-week recovery period. 
Post-mortem test article-related and generally dose-dependent changes in organ weights  and 
macroscopic and microscopic findings  were observed at ≥9 µg/dose. Organ weight  increases were 
observed in the spleen, liver, and adrenal gland. Organ weight  changes were generally reversing by 
the end of the 2-week recovery period. Macroscopic changes included skin thickening at the  injection 
site and enlarged lymph nodes. Injection site changes completely recovered, and lymph node changes 
were recovering by the end of the 2-week recovery period. Microscopic changes included mixed cell 
inflammation at the injection site;  increased cellularity and mixed cell inflammation in the inguinal, 
iliac, and popliteal lymph nodes; decreased cellularity in the splenic periartiolar lymphoid sheath; 
increased myeloid cellularity in the bone marrow; and hepatocyte vacuolation and Kupffer cell 
hypertrophy in the liver. Microscopic changes were generally reversing by the  end of the 2-week 
recovery period.

Genotoxicity 
mRNA-1273  contains natural nucleosides and lipid nanoparticles. The applicant submitted  genotoxicity 
data to evaluate the  genotoxic potential of the novel excipient SM-102  as well as the final vaccine 
formulation. The other lipid components contained in the  final formulation, i.e. PEG2000-DMG, DSPC 
and cholesterol, were not separately tested but are contained in the  formulation tested in the in vivo 
genotoxicity studies, which is acceptable. DSPC and cholesterol do not raise any concern in terms of 
genotoxic potential.   
SM-102  was tested  for its genotoxic potential in study  9601567  in a bacterial reverse mutation test in 
Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Results did not  indicate any evidence of genotoxic 
activity in this  in vitro mutagenicity  assay. SM-102 did not  show any evidence of genotoxic activity in 
the conducted in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus test  in human peripheral blood lymphocytes 
(Study 9601567).  No cytotoxicity was observed in this assay. Both assays were performed in 
compliance with  GLP. 
In in vivo genotoxicity testing, NPI luciferase mRNA in SM-102-containing  LNPs  was determined to be 
negative (non-clastogenic) after a single dose of 0.32/6.0,  1.07/20,  or 3.21/60  mg/kg NPI luciferase 
mRNA/SM-102  in Sprague Dawley rats. A statistically  significant decrease in PCEs (polychromatic 
erythrocyte) was observed in the low dose 0.32/6.0  mg/kg NPI luciferase mRNA/SM-102 in the  male 
group only (male and female were tested in separate groups) at the  48-hour time point. This effect did 
not show dose dependency and after 24 hours was no longer evident.  
Increases in cytokines IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1α,  and IP-10 were observed in this study 6 hours after IV 
administration of 1.07/20  mg/kg and 3.21/60  mg/kg NPI luciferase mRNA/SM-102,  respectively. 
Reference in this  regard is made to the  nonclinical pharmacology section, dealing with  cytokine release 
after the intramuscular administration of clinically relevant doses of mRNA-1273  to NHP.   
Another GLP-compliant in vivo micronucleus study in rat was performed with  mRNA-1706 in SM-102-
containing lipid  nanoparticles using IV administration. In this study statistically  significant increases in 
micronucleated erythrocytes were reported in both sexes. A strong increase in Molecular initiating 
event (MIE) was observed 48 hours after the final administration in  the highest dose group in male 
rats (mRNA-1706:  4.0/5.2 mg/kg; SM-102:  54.1  mg/kg). No  clear dose-response relationship was 
reported. 
With  regards to the positive findings observed in in vivo micronucleus assays, ICH S2(R1) states that 
in this  case ‘all the toxicological data should be evaluated to determine whether a non-genotoxic effect 
could be the cause or a contributing  factor’. In the toxicological studies conducted in rat, various non-
genotoxic effects that  could impact  on the increase of micronucleated erythrocytes in this  species were 
observed: hyperthermia, disturbance of erythropoiesis (lower reticulocyte count,  higher red blood cell 
distribution  width)  and increase and inflammation of the spleen, which could affect clearance of 
micronucleated cells from the  blood. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were submitted. This is scientifically acceptable and in line with  relevant 
guidelines on non-clinical development of vaccine candidates. The components of the  vaccine 
formulation are lipids and natural nucleosides that  are not  expected to have carcinogenic potential. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
A GLP-compliant reproductive and developmental toxicology (DART) study with  mRNA-1273 has been 
conducted in female Sprague Dawley CD rats.  
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 50/169 
 
 
 
 
IM administrations of mRNA-1273  to female SD 1 rats at the human clinical dose, twice before mating 
and twice during gestation, was associated with  non-adverse effects including  thin fur cover, swollen 
hindlimbs and limited usage of the hindlimb. However, there were no mRNA-1273-related effects on 
female fertility, embryo-foetal or post-natal survival, growth  or development in the  F1 offspring. The 
mRNA-1273-related non-adverse effects were limited to an increase in the number of foetuses with 
common skeletal variations of 1 or more rib nodules and 1 or more wavy ribs, with  no effect on the 
viability and growth on the F1  generation pups.  
In this study, no vaccine dose was administered during the early organogenesis, to address the direct 
embryotoxic effect of the components of the vaccine formulation. However, such a risk is considered 
low in humans, given the non-live organism nature of mRNA-1273 and the low risk of genotoxic effect 
of SM-102-containing  LNP in  humans. The overall pregnancy index was numerically lower in mRNA-
1273  vaccinated female rats (84.1%),  compared to control animals (93.2%),  but  remains within  the 
Test Facility’s historical control range (low range being 75%). 
Apart from that,  no consistent adversities were observed in the male and female reproductive tracts of 
Sprague Dawley rats during macroscopic and microscopic investigation  in the frame of the submitted 
repeated dose toxicity studies. 
Local Tolerance  
No stand-alone local tolerance studies were submitted.  This is acceptable and in line with  relevant 
guidance on non-clinical vaccine development since local tolerance was evaluated in repeated dose 
toxicity studies.  
In these studies, administration of LNP-mRNA products proved to induce local irritancy and 
inflammation. These effects can be related to an immunologic response towards the administered 
mRNA-1273  at and in the vicinity of the injection site, the former being the desired pharmacological 
mode of action of mRNA-1273.  However, the observed local inflammatory response towards LNP-
mRNA injection in rats was not only noted in the direct vicinity of the injection site, but also in adjacent 
tissues and/or organs. For example, subcutaneous tissue, the dermis, epidermis, skeletal muscle (with 
myofiber degradation), perineurial tissue surrounding the sciatic nerve, and draining lymph nodes in 
proximity to  the injection site were commonly affected by inflammation after LNP-mRNA 
administration. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the CHMP  Guideline on the  Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal  Products 
for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447100),  due to their nature vaccines and lipids are unlikely to 
result in a significant risk to the environment. Therefore, environmental risk assessment studies are 
not provided in  this Application for Marketing Authorisation,  which is considered acceptable. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The nonclinical proof-of-concept studies included evaluation of immunogenicity and protective activity 
of mRNA-1273 in young and aged mice, Syrian golden hamsters and nonhuman primate (rhesus 
macaques). The potential risk for VAED in these animal models was also assessed. 
In each animal model, IM administration of mRNA-1273 at clinically relevant dose(s) elicited robust 
SARS-CoV-2 S-2P-binding and neutralising antibody titres. Concurrent measurement of the  cellular 
response in the immunised mice and nonhuman primates showed induction of a Th1-directed T-cell 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 51/169 
 
 
 
 
response characterised by IFN-g,  IL-2 and TNF-a,  and additionally IL-21-producing  follicular helper T 
(Tfh) cells in nonhuman primates. Dose-response relationship was established both for the binding and 
neutralising titres in  both species, and for the  CD4+ Th1-directed T cells and IL-21-producing Tfh cells 
in nonhuman primates. 
In challenge protection studies, the  immunised animals were challenged with  mouse adapted SARS-
CoV-2 virus (IN, 103 PFU  for aged mice, 105 PFU  for young mice) or wild-type  SARS-CoV-2 virus (IT 
and IN, 7.6x105 PFU  for nonhuman primates; IN, 105 PFU for hamsters). In aged mice, 1 µg dose of 
mRNA-1273  on prime-boost schedule completely protected mice from virus replication in the lungs, at 
Days 2 and 4 post-challenge, as well as preventing body weight loss at Day 4 post-challenge. Full 
protection against lung inflammation was also evidenced. The 0.1  µg dose conferred partial protection, 
consistent with  a lower immune response compared to the 1 µg  dose group. In young mice, 1 or 10 µg 
dose of mRNA-1273  conferred complete protection from virus replication in the lungs at Day 2 post-
challenge, with  0.1  µg dose conferring partial protection. In this  model, a clear effect on lung 
histopathology was evidenced even for the 0.1  µg and 0.01 µg  doses. In hamsters, mRNA-1273 
administration at 1,  5, or 25μg  on a prime-boost schedule conferred clear protection from body weight 
loss and viral infection in the lungs and nasal turbinate, generally consistent with  the lung  pathological 
changes. 
Regarding challenge-protection studies in nonhuman primates, IM administration of mRNA-1273  at 30 
µg dose on a prime-boost schedule or 100 µg dose on a prime-only schedule, in one study, conferred 
complete protection from virus replication in the  lungs, at Day 2 post-challenge. The 2.5 µg prime-
boost dose provided partial protection, consistent  with suboptimal  immune responses. In another 
study, 100  µg of mRNA-1273  on a prime-boost schedule completely protected animals from virus 
replication in the lungs at Day 4  post-challenge. Breakthrough virus replication in  the lungs was 
detected in some mRNA-1273  vaccinated animals, however, lung histopathology analyses of these 
animals did not reveal a sign of enhanced lung  inflammation or of disease enhancement risk of mRNA-
1273. 
In conclusion, robust proof-of concept data have been submitted  and the potential risk of mRNA-1273-
associated disease enhancement has been appropriately addressed and no risk identified. 
Biodistribution 
The evaluation of mRNA-1273 tissue  distribution was based on a rat biodistribution  study using a 
similar mRNA-based vaccine encoding CMV antigens (mRNA-1647). The non-GLP status and no 
inclusion of female rats do not qualify this study as pivotal, which  is not considered critical, given the 
general acceptance of platform approach for evaluating the toxicology profile of mRNA-1273. 
Following  single IM  injection at 100 µg mRNA-1647,  the plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics and tissue 
distribution  were assessed in blood and a pre-specified set of organs/tissues for a period of 120  hours. 
A qualified branched DNA (bDNA) multiplex  method was used. 
As expected, mRNA-1647 were distributed throughout  the body (including  brain, heart, lung, eye, 
testis),  and were rapidly cleared from plasma during the first 24 hours, with  the T1/2  estimated in  a 
range from 2.7 to 3.8  hours. The highest  mRNA-1647 concentrations were at the  injection site. 
Following  plasma clearance, proximal and distal lymph nodes and spleen are the major distant  organs 
to which  mRNA-1647 distributes.  For these highly exposed tissues, Cmax was between 2 and 24 hours 
post-dose, and T1/2 was 14.9 hours for muscle of site of injection,  34.8 hours for proximal lymph 
nodes, 31.1 hours for distal lymph nodes, and 63.0 hours for spleen. Liver distribution  of mRNA-1647 
was also evident, consistent with  the recognised LNP  distribution pattern. 
In summary, the data are useful for understanding the tissue distribution  pattern of mRNA-1273. Only 
a relatively small fraction of the administered mRNA-1647 dose distributed  to distant  tissues, and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 52/169 
 
 
 
 
mRNA constructs did not persist past 1 to 3  days in tissues other than the injection site, lymph nodes, 
and spleen. 
Distribution,  metabolism, and PK of the  novel lipid component SM-102  have not been extensively 
studied in dedicated studies. However, data with  SM-86,  a close structural analogue, have been 
generated. These data show consistent  biodistribution compared to  the mRNA administered with  the 
LNP.  Furthermore, efficient metabolisation via ester hydrolysis and rapid elimination  of the remaining 
aliphatic acid head group via biliary and renal clearance were reported. Quantitative Whole-Body 
Autoradiography (QWBA) confirmed the biodistribution  of SM-86  and revealed no persistence of the 
lipid component in any tissue beyond 168 hours. Because of the reported structural similarity between 
SM-86  and SM-102,  it  is assumed that SM-102  will  distribute similarly and will  be efficiently and rapidly 
metabolised and eliminated via biliary and renal routes. 
SM-102  pharmacokinetics after IV administration of similar PEG2000-DMG containing  LNPs were 
determined to  be very similar to those parameters observed for SM-86. Altogether, these data do not 
suggest accumulation of SM-102 upon repeated dosing. 
Toxicology  
During the assessment of the submitted  toxicology studies of mRNA-1273, the following  observations 
were made from the repeated dose toxicity: 
Alterations in erythropoiesis such as a decrease in mean reticulocyte count  and increase in red cell 
distribution  width  were observed in most of the  submitted rat repeated dose toxicity studies. 
Furthermore, in the mRNA-1273-specific study 2308-123,  a decrease of RBC mass (erythrocytes, 
haemoglobin, and/or haematocrit) were noted. Such alterations can – in principle – be correlated to 
infections and associated inflammations, and therefore can presumable be related to inflammatory 
responses after LNP-mRNA  product administrations in rats. The potential clinical relevance is not 
known however these findings were reversible.  
Among the submitted rat toxicity studies, hepatic alterations (increased liver weights,  hepatocytic 
vacuolation, hypertrophy of Kupffer-cells, centrilobular degeneration characterised by presence of 
mixed inflammatory cell in  sinusoids with  single cell necrosis or degeneration of hepatocytes) and 
corresponding changes in  clinical chemistry (statistically significant  increases in AST, ALP, triglyceride, 
cholesterol, bilirubin,  urea nitrogen) were frequently -but  not consistently- observed. It is possible that 
the inconsistent  changes observed in the liver of rats are not a direct result of LNP-mRNA 
administration, but  rather secondary to the systemic inflammation observed following LNP-mRNA 
administration. 
Throughout the repeated dose toxicity studies, increases in eosinophil counts (up to 6.5-fold compared 
to the control groups) were consistently observed in the haematology samples taken after the last 
booster administrations.  The absolute eosinophil counts observed in LNP-mRNA studies reached values 
that  would be classified as eosinophilia in patients:  in humans, eosinophilia starts when absolute EOS 
counts exceed 450-500  cells µL-1  (Ramirez et al. 2018).  In study 5002034,  the mean female EOS 
count of the highest  dose group (100 µg mRNA/dose) was 451 cells µL-1, with  the highest  individual 
EOS count being 1020 cells µL-1  in animal No.  4507. Increased eosinophil counts can be correlated 
with  diseases such as IgE-mediated type-1 allergy, in which peripheral eosinophils are increased as a 
consequence of the late-phase allergic reaction, and asthma. The observed eosinophil increase in rat 
LNP-mRNA studies could therefore be potentially clinically relevant. Considering these aspects, this 
finding is included in the  SmPC under 5.3,  however, it is noted that  its toxicological potential to 
humans is low.  
Decreasing lymphocyte counts (up to more than a factor of 4 relative to  control groups) were 
consistently observed after LNP-mRNA  vaccine administration throughout  the submitted rat toxicity 
Assessment report

studies. Furthermore, histological investigations demonstrated test-article  related minimal to mild 
decreased lymphoid cellularity and/or single cell necrosis of lymphocytes in the spleen (periarteriolar 
sheath), mesenteric lymph nodes (paracortex) and in the  thymus (cortexin) in some of the  submitted 
studies. Based on available literature, these findings are presumably caused by test-article related 
severe stress, originating from the intense inflammatory response after mRNA-1273 administration to 
rats.  
Throughout the rat repeated dose toxicity studies, increases in activated partial thromboplastin  time 
(APTT, up  to ~30%) and fibrinogen (up to ~2.5-fold)  were consistently observed. These haemostatic 
alterations could potentially be clinically relevant and were therefore mentioned in  section 5.3  of the 
SmPC. However, the toxicological potential  of these rat findings is low for humans.  
A significant increase of plasma potassium (up to 20%)  was observed in most of the submitted 
repeated dose toxicity rat studies. However, the observed increases in plasma potassium levels in the 
submitted  rat GLP repeated dose toxicity studies are consistent with  biologic variability in rats, and 
were reversed or were reversing after recovery, and were not considered test-item  related by the 
study director and/or clinical pathologist. Furthermore, the magnitude  of the  observed alterations is 
not of relevance in susceptible patients  suffering from hyperkalaemia and/or cardiac morbidities. 
In different rat toxicity studies,  splenic alterations and/or splenic toxicity were consistently observed. 
These alterations ranged from splenomegaly (significant weight  increases were frequently observed 
throughout  all test-article groups), decreased cellularity of the  periarteriolar lymphoid sheath, 
increased cellularity of macrophages (e.g. in red pulp),  neutrophilic infiltration  in the red pulp, single 
cell necrosis of lymphocytes in the spleen (periarteriolar sheath), and increased extramedullary 
haematopoiesis. Furthermore, LNP-mRNA accumulation in the spleen was observed in the  submitted 
PK rat study  5002121.  The observed spleen changes were minimal and caused by a transient  systemic 
inflammatory response to LNP  administration and/or to the expected compensatory response. 
Furthermore all the splenic changes fully resolved or were resolving following  a 2-week recovery 
period. Because of these aspects, it  is considered that the observed spleen findings  could only bear 
limited relevance for humans.  
In different rat repeated dose toxicity studies, statistically significant  adrenal gland alterations were 
observed, which ranged from increased organ weights to  dose-dependent minimal cortical 
hypertrophy. As these findings  generally resolved after recovery and were only inconsistently observed 
among the submitted rat toxicity studies, no concern arises from this  finding.  
Generally, local inflammatory response towards LNP-mRNA  injection in rat repeated dose toxicity 
studies was not only observed in the  direct vicinity of the injection site,  but also in adjacent tissues 
and/or organs. For example, subcutaneous tissue, the dermis, epidermis, skeletal muscle (with 
myofiber degradation), perineurial tissue surrounding the sciatic nerve, and draining lymph nodes in 
proximity to  the injection site were commonly affected by inflammation after LNP-mRNA 
administration. The observed spread of inflammation  into adjacent tissues of the injection site was in 
part due to the large difference in body surface area between rats and humans, and that  the dose 
volume administered resulted in  higher concentration of drug product at the site of injection in rats 
compared to humans. Considering this  aspect, the applicant calculated a safety margin of ~ 375. 
Therefore, it is considered that  these severe local inflammations bear no clinical relevance.  
With  regards to the submitted  genotoxicity studies, the  administered mRNA/SM-102  concentrations in 
the positive genotoxicity study  were much higher than the actual concentrations in the clinical setting 
(>27mg/kg SM-102).  The vaccine will be administered two  times only, and a low dose containing 
around 1 mg SM-102 per dose will  be administered at the proposed posology. Moreover, a different 
route of administration was used in the  micronucleus study compared to the intended clinical route (IV 
vs. IM), and thus significantly lower systemic exposure to the individual excipients can be expected in 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 54/169 
 
 
 
 
the clinical setting.  The SM-102 specific in vitro bacterial reverse mutation test and in vitro mammalian 
cell micronucleus test in  human peripheral blood lymphocytes did  not indicate any genotoxic potential 
for this novel excipient. Taking all these data together, a relevant genotoxic risk is thus not  expected 
for mRNA-1273. 
A GLP-compliant reproductive and developmental toxicology (DART) study with  mRNA-1273 has been 
conducted in female Sprague Dawley CD rats. 
There were no mRNA-1273-related  effects on female fertility, embryo-foetal or post-natal survival, 
growth or development in the F1  offspring. The mRNA-1273-related  non-adverse effects vs control 
group treated with Tris/Sucrose were limited  to an increase in the number of foetuses with common 
skeletal variations of 1 or more rib nodules and 1 or more wavy ribs, with no effect on the viability and 
growth on the F1  generation pups. 
In this study, no vaccine dose was administered during early organogenesis, to address the direct 
embryotoxic effect of the components of the vaccine formulation. However, such a risk is considered 
low in humans, given the non-live organism nature of mRNA-1273 and the low risk of genotoxic effect 
of SM-102-containing  LNP in  humans. A significantly lower pregnancy index (68.2%)  was observed in 
the natural delivery group only and was ascribed to random distribution of pregnant and non-pregnant 
animals between the  c-section and natural delivery cohorts. The overall pregnancy index was 
numerically lower in mRNA-1273 vaccinated female rats (84.1%), compared to  control animals 
(93.2%),  but remained within  the Test Facility’s historical control range (low range being 75%).  In 
summary, no mRNA-1273  related effect on pregnancy is expected from these data.  
Although maternal-to-foetal and maternal-to pup transfer of antibodies was observed, no data are 
available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No major non-clinical issues are identified in this  application. A range of other concerns identified have 
been properly addressed by the applicant.  
The CHMP is of the view that non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on 
conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity.

2.4.2.  Clinical Pharmacology 
For vaccines, pharmacokinetics is not applicable, and pharmacodynamics relates to investigation of 
immunogenicity. Immunogenicity was evaluated by assessing changes from baseline in  SARS-CoV-2-
specific binding  antibodies (bAb) levels and neutralising  antibody (nAb) titres. 
Mechanism of action 
COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna contains mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles. The mRNA encodes for 
the full-length  SARS-CoV-2 spike protein modified with  2 proline substitutions  within  the heptad repeat 
1 domain (S-2P) to stabilise the spike protein into  a prefusion conformation. After intramuscular 
injection, cells at the injection site and the draining lymph nodes take up the lipid nanoparticle, 
effectively delivering the mRNA sequence into cells for translation into viral protein. The mRNA delivery 
system is based on the principle and observation that  cells in vivo can take up mRNA, translate it,  and 
express viral protein antigen(s) in the desired conformation. The delivered mRNA does not enter the 
cellular nucleus or interact with  the genome, is non-replicating, and is expressed transiently mainly by 
dendritic cells and subcapsular sinus macrophages. The protein undergoes post-translational 
modification and trafficking resulting  in properly folded, fully functional Spike protein that is inserted 
into the  cellular membrane of the expressing cell(s). The expressed, membrane-bound spike protein of 
SARS-CoV-2 is then  recognised by immune cells as a foreign antigen. This elicits both T-cell and B-cell 
responses to generate functional neutralising  antibodies, which  may contribute to  protection against 
COVID-19. 
Immunogenicity studies 
The immunogenicity data available so far were generated from one phase 1 and one 2a study 
conducted in the USA. No immunogenicity data from Phase 3 are available for assessment at  the time 
this report was written.  No study reports are yet available for this application. Immunogenicity data 
were mainly presented in listings,  tables and figures. 
Assays 
Across the Phase 1, 2,  and 3  studies, ELISA is being used to measure vaccine-induced binding IgG 
antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and, in some cases, to specific domains of the  protein, 
(i.e., the RBD of the spike protein). Multiple  assays are being used to measure the  titres of nAbs. In 
Study 20-0003,  vaccine-induced neutralising activity was assessed by PsVNA (performed at the  NIAID 
Vaccine Research Center, USA) and by live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus PRNT assay (performed at the 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center, USA). These experimental assays were developed using a fit-for-
purpose approach.  
Assays used in later phases followed more typical qualification and validation paths. A qualified MN 
assay (performed by Battelle) and qualified ELISAs (performed by PPD) were used to test  samples 
from Study mRNA-1273-P201.  A panel of validated assays will be used to assess immunogenicity in 
Study mRNA-1273-P301.   
In addition, in Study 20-0003,  convalescent sera obtained from 41 patients who recovered from SARS-
CoV-2 infection were used during assay development to generate a relative benchmark (based on 
levels elicited by natural infection).

To address concerns about the theoretical risk of enhanced disease after injection with  mRNA-1273, an 
additional series of in vitro studies were performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated 
from participants  in Study 20-0003.  The induction  of a Th2-directed response has been linked to ERD, 
as seen in vaccines for other respiratory virus infections,  in particular, formalin-inactivated respiratory 
syncytial virus vaccine (Kim et al 1969; Haynes et al 2020).  In animal models of vaccine-induced 
immunity against other coronaviruses, specifically MERS and SARS-CoV-1, a Th1-directed immune 
response has been correlated with  a lack of ERD immunopathology (Grifoni et  al 2020;  Peng et al 
2020;  Sekine et al 2020;  Weiskopf et al 2020).  Activated CD4+ T cells can be segregated into  Th1- 
and Th2-directed responses based on the production of specific cytokines; therefore, ICS assays were 
used to evaluate CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses elicited by the mRNA-1273 vaccine in clinical 
samples. 
An assessment of the assay qualification parameters and assay conduct led to the  conclusion that  the 
main assays used in the  phase 2 study are acceptable (ELISA for determination of binding  antibodies, 
the pseudovirus neutralisation assay and the cytokine stimulation assay). Formal qualification reports 
are requested to be submitted  as part of the final clinical study report, which is the subject of a specific 
obligation.

In summary, the results of Phase 1 Study 20-0003  showed a consistent dose response across age 
groups by several measures of humoral immunogenicity for both  binding and neutralising antibodies. 
Taking forward the 100 µg  dose (administered as 2 injections, 28  days apart) to Phase 2a and 3 
studies was based on several observations: (i) 2 injections of 100 µg stimulated  serum bAb 
concentrations and titres greater than 2  injections of 25 μg  in the 18 to 55  years of age stratum; (ii) 2 
injections of 100µg induced nAb responses (measured by PsVNA) similar to  those measured in 
recipients of the  250µg dose in the 18 to 55  years or age subjects evaluated; and (iii)  2 injections of 
100µg  led to  a lower incidence of reactogenicity than  2 injections of 250µg (Jackson et  al N  Engl J Med. 
2020;  Anderson et al N Engl J Med.  2020). The 50µg  dose induced comparable humoral immune 
responses to the 100ug  dose (data for the 50µg dose available until day 57).

In summary, participants in Phase 2a who received 2 doses of either 50 or 100μg of mRNA-1273 
separated by 28 days developed both binding  and neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with 
GMFRs > 20-fold  (bAb) and >  50-fold (MN  assay), regardless of dose level. These data support dose 
selection in principle because of the magnitude  of the  antibody response to 2  doses of mRNA-1273 
even if the differentiation between 50μg  and 100μg is close to  negligible. Responses and dynamics 
observed across age cohorts was comparable. 
Cell mediated immunity 
Not  investigated in  Phase 2a. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The proposed mechanism of action of mRNA-1273 is 1) uptake of the lipid nanoparticles by antigen 
presenting cells through  endocytic pathways both at the  site of injection  and in  the draining lymph 
nodes, 2) release of mRNA (encoding modified SARS-CoV-2 S protein) into the cell, 3) S protein 
expression (mainly by dendritic cells and subcapsular sinus macrophages) and 4) stimulation  of 
immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 S-2P protein to provide protection against COVID-19.

The clinical development includes immunogenicity assessments across the entire clinical study program 
i.e., Phase 1, 2a and 3 studies.  
Phase 1 Study 20-003  is an open-label, dose-ranging study of the  safety and immunogenicity of 
mRNA-1273  in healthy adults (3 age cohorts: 18-54  yrs, 55-70  yrs, ≥71  yrs). Phase 2a Study mRNA-
1272-P201  is a randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-confirmation study to evaluate 
the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273  in adults aged 18 years and older (2 age 
cohorts: 18-54 yrs, ≥55 yrs). Phase 3 study mRNA- 1273-P301  is a, randomised, stratified, observer-
blind, placebo-controlled study to  evaluate the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 in 
adults aged 18 years and older.  
The designs of all three clinical studies are adequate for characterising humoral immune response after 
mRNA-1273  vaccination across relevant age strata. Characterisation of cellular immune responses is 
only foreseen in the  phase 1 study, which  is considered a shortcoming particularly for the limited study 
size. The phase 2a study design includes two  age strata, 18-54  yrs and ≥55 yrs, which might  not allow 
an adequate characterisation of the humoral immune response in the older age groups (e.g. 65-74 
year olds, ≥75 year olds), most vulnerable to COVID-19 and known to produce a reduced immune 
response upon vaccination.  
Results for several pre-specified immunogenicity endpoints in both Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies  have 
not been provided (such as immunoglobulin  subclass analyses, binding to  neutralising antibody ratios, 
or B cell epitope characterisation). No immunogenicity data from the phase 3 study were available for 
assessment at the time  this report was written.  The data cut-off was day 119  post-vaccination for 
Phase 1, and day 57 for post-vaccination for Phase 2. This means that  immunokinetics over time and 
correlate of protection/ risk could not be characterised. This is acceptable for the  time being, but these 
data should be provided with final CSRs. 
Study endpoints (across studies) relevant to  induction of humoral immunity induced by mRNA-1273 
are mainly based on S protein binding and neutralising antibodies, measured by ELISA or (pseudo) 
virus neutralisation  assays, respectively. All applied immunogenicity assays are adequate for 
determination of immunological endpoints  relating to  humoral immune response, albeit final validation 
reports have not been provided for all assays and are expected to be submitted once available. The 
use of different assays in Phase 1 and 2 limits  comparability between studies, but the  approach used is 
acceptable. Sampling schedules are appropriate to determine humoral kinetics (including peak 
responses as well as decay) and for investigating  short-, mid- and long-term outcomes. 
Immunogenicity assessments are based on a total of 116 subjects in Phase 1 (across 25-250  µg doses) 
and 587 subjects in Phase 2a (198,  195 and 194 subjects received 100μg, 50μg  or placebo, 
respectively), who received both the first and second dose of mRNA-1273.   
Evaluation of humoral immune response to mRNA-1273  in Phase 1 and 2a studies was based on a very 
limited number of SARS-CoV-2 strains and/ or pseudoviruses (mainly based on the initial  Wuhan 
isolate), which is understood in the context of the pandemic with rapidly emerging strains. 
Importantly, neutralising activity induced by mRNA-1273  vaccination against the  currently dominant 
D614G variant strain was confirmed. Plans for further evaluation of new strain variants were outlined 
during evaluation and are supported. The applicant confirmed that immune responses against strains 
such as A222V-D614G (EU1),  a S447N-D614G (EU2)  variant, a N439K-D614G  variant, the  mink 
adapted strain recently identified in Denmark as well as relevant new and emerging S protein variants 
(library of pseudoviruses) will be closely monitored in vaccinees sera (derived from both humans and 
animals). Deep sequencing of virus breakthrough cases is planned in the vaccine and placebo groups 
of the ongoing phase 3 trial  to identify any potential  gap in  protection against mutant strains. New  viral 
variant challenge stocks are being prepared, and once available will be used to challenge animals

vaccinated with  mRNA-1273  to directly assess the ability of mRNA-1273  to protect animals from these 
variant strains. 
The initial dose-ranging and clinical proof-of-concept in phase 1 study showed dose-dependent 
increases in binding and neutralising antibodies when comparing the lowest dose 25 µg  to the 50µg 
dose. When comparing the 50 µg to  the 100µg  dose, differences were less pronounced. The 250µg 
dose was only tested in the 18-55  yrs. age group and not  further pursued due to reactogenicity. The 
50 µg and 100  µg dose were further evaluated in the phase 2a study, where comparable results were 
obtained, indicating  a rather flat dose-response. Even though  the 50µg compared to the  100µg dose 
does not  show pronounced differences, 100 µg has been chosen because of comparable and acceptable 
reactogenicity and slightly higher immunogenicity. In addition, 100  µg may exert more sustainable 
kinetics of immune responses in the long term (putative  at present). Overall, the  selection of the 
100µg  dose for the phase 3 trial is reasonable and supported. 
In both Phase 1 and 2a studies the humoral immune response in terms of induction  of antibodies 
binding the  S protein (full protein and RBD) and virus neutralising antibodies showed that two  mRNA-
1273  doses given 4 weeks apart resulted in substantially increased geometric mean titres (GMTs) if 
compared to responses after only the first dose across all age strata tested. While binding  antibody 
levels generally started to rise after the first vaccination (day 15),  this was not seen for neutralising 
responses which were only induced after the second vaccination. These results support the need of a 
second dose.  
Human convalescent sera from up to 41 individuals recovered from mostly mild COVID-19 were 
routinely used as comparators in the Phase 1 study.  mRNA-1273-induced humoral immune responses 
were generally within  the upper range or above those measured in the convalescent comparator sera. 
It is noted, however, that  mild disease has been associated with  lower antibody levels. Moreover, 
convalescent sera were collected between 23-54 (median 34) days post-diagnosis which likely does not 
reflect peak antibody responses. While humoral response is generally reassuring as regards proof of 
concept, its magnitude and kinetics need to  be interpreted with  caution in the context of a currently 
unknown immune correlate of protection. Peak GMTs (binding and neutralising) across age groups and 
clinical trials were generally seen 7-14  days after the second vaccination (day 36-43).  Decreases in 
GMTs became apparent soon thereafter and were reported until  day 57 in the  phase 2 and day 119  in 
the phase 1 study. Of note, despite decreases in GMTs over time, levels in the majority of participants 
were generally sustained within  the upper range or above GMTs of human convalescent comparator 
sera. This is preliminarily reassuring as regards antibody persistence over time. 
GMTs of S protein binding  antibodies in the elderly (≥71 years of age) vaccinated in the phase 1  study 
with  the 100µg  mRNA-1273 dose were higher compared to the younger participants, while  neutralising 
responses were generally comparable between age cohorts or superior in the  younger participants. 
However, this  finding on binding antibodies was not replicated in the larger phase 2a study. Upon 
request, the applicant provided more granular data by age for the Phase 2a study,  even though the 
study was not powered for age subgroup. Peak median/mean binding  antibody titres  (day 43)  induced 
by the 100 µg mRNA-1273  dose in the  18-54 YOA stratum were approximately 1.2-fold,  1.5-fold and 
1.9-fold higher compared to the 55-64-year olds, 65-74-year olds and ≥75-year olds, respectively. 
Therefore, binding antibody levels declined in  an age-dependent manner as expected, with  more 
comparable neutralising activity across strata. 
Cellular immune responses (T cell cytokine response) were only investigated in phase 1 until  day 43 
after the first vaccination (i.e. 14  days after the second vaccination). Analysis plans for phase 2a and 
phase 3  do not  outline any further investigations on this  important aspect likely contributing  to 
protection against SARS-CoV-2. Data from phase 1 point  towards a general Th1  over Th2 dominant

response indicative of a favourable cytokine profile as regards the theoretical risk of vaccine dependent 
enhancement of disease (VAED). However, it  is noted that  shortcomings in assay conduct, lack of 
reporting of Th2  controls and overall heterogeneous results do not permit to finally conclude on this. 
Likewise, it was not convincingly demonstrated whether CD8 T cell responses were induced by 
vaccination with mRNA-1273  in humans. Therefore, cellular immune response to mRNA-1273 
vaccination is not  considered comprehensively characterised. This limitation however does not prevent 
to conclude on a positive benefit/risk assessment as it  is not  expected to substantially change the 
outcome, considering that  no VAED signals were observed in pre-clinical studies and in phase 3 study 
efficacy and safety data so far. 
Immunogenicity data from Phase 3, once available, are expected to fill the  current knowledge gaps on 
humoral immunity in subgroups with various comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, overweight, 
immunocompromised individuals etc.) and provide further information as to the  impact of 
immunosenescence.  
Immune responses in mRNA-1273  vaccinated patients who  develop COVID-19 will be of relevance to 
furthering the understanding of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 as well as investigations towards an 
immune correlate of protection. Plans for establishing an immune correlate of protection seem to  be 
based solely on humoral and not cellular responses, which is considered a shortcoming, but  will likely 
expand the knowledge on antibody-mediated immunity  against SARS-CoV-2. Of note, the Analysis Plan 
for immunogenicity data, including  the sampling for the immunogenicity subset, is currently missing 
and will need to account for the  study design changes in P301 introduced with  Protocol Amendment 6. 
Focus should be on data analysis plans for the exploration of correlate of protection.  
Longer-term data on humoral immunity are expected to emerge from all three clinical trials, which will 
inform on antibody kinetics beyond 3  months post-vaccination. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
While the overall dose-response towards mRNA-1273  in phase 1  and phase 2a clinical studies was 
rather flat, both the choice of the 100µg mRNA-1273  dose and the 2-dose schedule is deemed 
reasonable and acceptable by the CHMP.  Proof-of-concept has been established. 
Interpretation of immunogenicity results in  terms of vaccine efficacy is limited as currently no immune 
correlate of protection against COVID-19 exists. In addition,  no immunogenicity data from phase 3 are 
currently available. Notwithstanding,  based on prior experience with vaccines, the data received so far 
from Phase 1 and 2a are considered reassuring.  
The current gaps in understanding of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 induced by mRNA-
1273  vaccination mainly relate to the  following aspects: 
•  No plans for establishing an immune correlate of protection/risk have been provided. 
•  No data on immunogenicity in certain subgroups (e.g. at-risk groups, immunocompromised, 
mRNA-1273-vaccinated individuals who develop COVID-19, etc.) have been generated. 
•  No data for several pre-specified immunogenicity objectives from Phase 1 and 2a have been 
provided (such as immunoglobulin subclass analyses, binding  to neutralising antibody ratios, or 
B cell epitope characterisation). 
• 
The data on immune responses in the elderly is currently based on observations from the 
Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies and thus  derived from a limited number of subjects. Therefore, 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 79/169 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
final conclusions on immunogenicity for this most vulnerable populations  cannot be drawn at 
this time. 
The current understanding  of humoral immune response towards mRNA-1273 vaccination is 
based on a limited dataset of up to 3 months  after the second vaccination. Mid-and  long-term 
data are important to  inform on the  need for and timing  of further boosters to achieve long-
lasting protection. 
The level of protection conferred by mRNA-1273  against different SARS-CoV-2 variants is 
currently limited to a small number of strains. The applicant’s proposal to monitor clinically 
relevant and emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains by testing  both sera from vaccinated animals and 
human trial participants in functional  in vitro assays as well as conducting challenge/protection 
studies in animals is endorsed and data should be submitted  as soon as available. 
Final clinical study reports are expected to generate the  data needed to address the remaining points 
mentioned above. The final clinical study  report of the pivotal phase 3 study should be submitted  as a 
specific obligation  in the context of the conditional marketing authorisation by December 2022.  
The final clinical study reports for the phase 1 and phase 2  studies are required to be submitted as 
reflected in the  RMP (respectively by November 2021 and November 2022).   
Some of the above-mentioned data are however required as soon as available (see list  of 
recommendations in Annex I).

Treatments 
The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) dispersion of 100  µg mRNA encoding the  pre-
fusion stabilised S protein of SARS-CoV-2 formulated in LNPs  composed of 4  lipids: lipid SM-102, 
cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), and 1-
monomethoxypolyethyleneglycol-2,3-dimyristylglycerol with polyethylene glycol of average molecular 
weight  2000 (PEG2000-DMG).  mRNA-1273 Injection is provided as a sterile liquid for injection, white 
to off white dispersion in appearance, at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL in  Tris buffer containing sucrose 
and sodium acetate at pH  7.5. 
The placebo is 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) injection, United  States Pharmacopeia (USP). 
Study participants received two doses of either the vaccine mRNA-1273 or placebo intramuscularly 28 
days apart. The window for receiving the second dose was defined between 24-35 days following the 
first dose. At the time of definition of major protocol deviations, which  was to  happen before 
unblinding,  the acceptable visit window  was widened to 21  – 42 days (-7/+14  days around day 28).

study will be summarised. Unsolicited  AE will  be presented by MedDRA preferred term and system 
organ class.  
For all other safety parameters, descriptive summary statistics  will be provided. 
Methods used for efficacy evaluations 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Assessment: 
To be considered as a case of COVID-19  for the evaluation of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint,  the 
following criteria must be met: 
The participant must have experienced at least two of the following systemic symptoms:  
Fever (≥38ºC),  chills, myalgia, headache, sore throat, new olfactory and taste disorder(s),  
OR 
The participant must have experienced at least one of the following respiratory signs/symptoms: 
cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, OR clinical or radiographical evidence of 
pneumonia;  
AND 
The participant must have at least one NP swab, nasal swab, or saliva sample (or respiratory 
sample, if hospitalised) positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Assessments: 
To be considered a severe  COVID-19  case, the following  criteria must be met: a confirmed COVID-
19 as per the  Primary Efficacy Endpoint case definition,  plus any of the following: 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 84/169 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Clinical signs indicative of severe systemic illness, Respiratory Rate ≥30  per minute,  Heart Rate 
≥125  beats per minute, SpO2 ≤93% on room air at sea level or PaO2/FIO2 <300  mm Hg, OR 
•  Respiratory failure or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), (defined as needing high-flow 
oxygen, non-invasive or mechanical ventilation, or ECMO), evidence of shock (systolic blood 
pressure < 90 mmHg,  diastolic BP < 60 mmHg  or requiring vasopressors), OR 
•  Significant acute renal, hepatic or neurologic dysfunction,  OR 
•  Admission to  an intensive care unit  or death. 
An alternative less stringent case definition  of COVID-19 was used for secondary analyses requiring 
any of the systemic symptoms: fever (temperature ≥38ºC) or chills, cough, shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle aches or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore 
throat, nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea, nausea or vomiting or diarrhoea, 
AND  
a positive NP swab, nasal swab, or saliva sample (or respiratory sample, if hospitalised) for SARS-CoV-
2 by RT-PCR. 
Death  attributed  to COVID-19  is defined as any participant who dies during the study with  a cause 
directly attributed to  a complication of COVID-19. 
Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2  infection is determined by seroconversion due to infection assessed by 
bAb levels against SARS-CoV-2 as measured by a ligand-binding  assay specific to the SARS-CoV-2 
nucleocapsid protein and a negative NP swab sample for SARS-CoV-2 at Day 1. 
SARS-CoV-2 Infection is defined as: 
SARS-CoV-2 infection by seroconversion due to infection  measured by bAb against SARS-CoV-2 
nucleocapsid. Seroconversion is defined differently for participants seronegative at Baseline and 
seropositive at Baseline: 
• 
• 
Participants seronegative at Baseline: bAb levels against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid either from 
below the limit  of detection (LOD) or lower limit of quantification  (LLOQ) at Study Day 1 that 
increase to above or equal to LOD or LLOQ starting at  Study Day 57  or later. 
Participants seropositive at Baseline: bAb levels against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid above the 
LOD or LLOQ  at study Day 1 that  increase by 4-fold or more in participants starting  at Study 
Day 57 or later. 
Surveillance for COVID-19  Symptoms 
Surveillance for COVID-19 symptoms was conducted via weekly telephone calls or eDiary starting after 
enrolment and throughout the  study. If there is no response to an eDiary prompt for 2 days, the site 
staff should contact the study participant  by phone. 
To screen for COVID-19 occurring, pre-specified symptoms were elicited weekly from the participant 
and the presence of any one of these symptoms lasting at least 48 hours (except for fever and/or 
respiratory symptoms) shall result in the site  arranging an Illness Visit to  collect an NP swab within  72 
hours. All study participants who experience COVID-19 symptoms and subsequently present for an 
Illness Visit  (in-clinic or at home) will  be given instructions  and material to record disease course 
during the convalescent period, i.e. severity grading system, thermometer, oxygen saturation monitor, 
and saliva collection tubes. 
Case  adjudication 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 85/169 
 
 
 
 
Ambiguous in terms of study protocol/SAP specifications, efficacy results based on adjudicated cases 
have been presented as primary in this submission. Whereas including a blinded adjudication 
committee (AC) for COVID-19 cases was devised in the protocol, this  was not  reflected in the analysis 
plan. Adjudication criteria and re-adjudications performed have only been roughly described upon 
request. This can be accepted but  some residual uncertainty  remains as regards involvement and 
procedures of AC and case-related information flow involving study site personnel, sponsor, CRO and 
AC up to a final decision. Adjudicated and unadjudicated analyses have therefore been considered 
during assessment of main efficacy endpoints for robustness. 
Assays used for efficacy assessment 
•  RT- PCR  
The RT-PCR assay used is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to 
confirm SARS-CoV-2 in probable COVID-19 individuals and is performed by the Viracor Eurofins Clinical 
Diagnostics, which is a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), a certified high-
complexity laboratory.  
The RT-PCR is intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swab, 
nasal swab, nasopharyngeal wash, nasal wash, oropharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage from 
individuals suspected of COVID-19. It is approved for use under the Food and Drug Administration's 
Emergency Use Authorisation for in vitro diagnostics. Detailed information on the  conduct of the  RT 
PCR assay and the interpretation  of results was provided. The SARS-CoV-2 primer and probe sets are 
designed to  detect RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens from patients  as recommended for 
testing  by public health  authority guidelines. The chosen primer design is acceptable. 
Validation data include various protocols and validation results for extraction PCR performance and 
stability of test samples using different matrices (swabs and saliva). Overall, the results indicate that 
the test  method is acceptably validated.  
•  SARS-CoV-2  nucleocapsid protein specific IgG ELISA– PPD  Laboratories  
Serum will  be tested using  the ligand-binding assay specific to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid to 
determine the  immunologic status of study participants at baseline and assess for seroconversion due 
to infection during the  course of the study.  
The ELISA for the Detection of IgG Specific to SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein in Human  Serum was 
developed, qualified and validated by PPD Laboratories, in Richmond, Virginia, USA. This assay is 
employed to confirm asymptomatic infections of SARS-CoV-2 in study participants during the course of 
the study in participants  RT-PCR negative at baseline. 
Assay validation covered the quantifiable range (LLOQ to ULOQ),  the limit of detection (LOD), precision 
and ruggedness, dilutional  linearity, selectivity, specificity, and relative accuracy of the SARS CoV-2 N 
proteins. Validity of an assay run and individual test samples within  an assay run were determined.  
Selectivity was tested by spiking experiments employing reference material. During assay validation 
LOD of 4.8  AU/ml was confirmed, and the LLOQ was 9 AU/ml and all pre-defined acceptance criteria 
were met. Due to the expected depletion of the coating antigen used in the  ELISA a new lot (Lot 
#053020)  was qualified. 
Of note, the assay was not tested for selectivity as regards the capability to differentiate between 
SARS-CoV-2 and other circulating human coronaviruses. 
•  Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2  (N) immunoassay, Roche  
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 86/169 
 
 
 
 
Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 (N)  immunoassay is an automated commercially available antibody-based 
electrochemiluminescence assay employing recombinant derived nucleocapsid-(N-)-protein to measure 
antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2. The assay is intended to confirm asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 
infections in study participants as it is capable to  determine whether a vaccinated subject was exposed 
to natural infection. 
According to the  applicant the Roche Elecsys anti-N  assay will be used in study P301 for the detection 
of seroconversion. For those that are seropositive at baseline, the Anti-N  ELISA is used for generating 
the data to calculate the fold-rise. The serological (Dx) data will be available for all participants, and 
the anti-N  fold rise data will  be available for those seropositives at baseline. Baseline SARS-CoV-2 
negative status  requires both a negative RT-PCR test at baseline (pre-dose 1) and a negative bAb 
levels against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid as measured by Roche Elecsys assay.  
In addition, seroconversion due to infection assessed by bAb against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein 
will be taken into considerations for two secondary efficacy endpoints: 
•  COVID-19 or SARS CoV-2 infection. This endpoint  is a combination of COVID-19 (symptomatic, 
defined as for the primary endpoint), and SARS-CoV-2 infection, determined by seroconversion 
due to infection assessed by bAb levels against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in those who 
were baseline SARS-CoV-2 negative participants. In participants who were baseline SARS-CoV-
2 negative, seroconversion will be measured by Roche Elecsys assay. 
•  Asymptomatic infection,  defined as in the absence of symptoms, with  SARS-CoV-2 infection 
determined by seroconversion due to infection assessed by bAb levels against SARS-CoV-2 
nucleocapsid protein in those who were baseline SARS-CoV-2 negative participants. 
Validation reports were made available and confirmed high specificity without  cross reactivity to other 
human and endemically circulating coronaviruses (OC43, HKU1,  NL63  or 229E). In addition,  samples 
from symptomatic patients  with a RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested after various 
time intervals during the convalescent phase. Antibodies against nucleocapsid could be detected up to 
40 days after RT-PCR test  negative results.  
Of note, data of the above mentioned two secondary efficacy endpoints are not available yet. 
Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments will include monitoring  and recording of the  following for each participant: 
•  Solicited local and systemic ARs that  occur during the 7 days following each injection (i.e., the 
day of dosing and 6 subsequent days). Solicited ARs will  be recorded daily using eDiaries. 
•  Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the  28 days following each dose of IP (i.e., the 
day of dosing and 27 subsequent days). Unsolicited  AEs are AEs that  are not included in the 
protocol defined solicited ARs. 
•  AEs leading to  discontinuation from dosing and/or study participation from Day 1 through Day 
759 or withdrawal from the study. 
•  MAAEs from Day 1 through  Day 759 or withdrawal from the study. 
•  SAEs from Day 1 through Day 759  or withdrawal  from the study. 
•  Abnormal vital sign measurements.

Sample size 
The sample size was driven by the total  number of cases required to demonstrate VE (mRNA-1273  vs. 
placebo) to  prevent COVID-19. Under the assumption of proportional hazards over time and with 1:1 
randomisation of mRNA-1273  and placebo, a total of 151 COVID-19 cases were to provide 90%  power 
to detect a 60% reduction in hazard rate (60%  VE), rejecting the  null hypothesis H0: VE ≤30%,  with  2 
interim analyses at 35% and 70%  of the  target total number of cases using a 1-sided O’Brien-Fleming 
boundary for efficacy and a log-rank test  statistic  with a 1-sided false positive error rate of 0.025. 
Approximately 30,000 participants  were to be randomised. It was assumed that  approximately 15% of 
participants were to be excluded from the PP population, and that  participants were considered to be at 
risk for COVID-19 starting  14 days after the second dose. 
Randomisation 
Participants were planned to be randomly assigned in  1:1 ratio to receive either mRNA-1273  or 
placebo in a blinded manner using  a centralised Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Randomisation 
was stratified based on age and, if participants  were < 65 years of age, based on the presence or 
absence of risk factors for severe illness from COVID-19 based on CDC recommendation as of March 
2020.  Consequently, there were three strata for randomisation. With  protocol amendment 5, at  least 
25% and up to  50% of enrolled participants were planned to be either ≥65 years of age or < 65 years 
of age and at risk at screening. 
Blinding (masking) 
Up to Protocol Amendment 5,  the study was an observer-blind study. The investigator, study staff, 
study participants, site monitors, and Sponsor personnel (or its designees) were to be blinded to the IP 
administered until  study end with  protocol-specified exceptions such as site personnel for vaccine 
administration, site monitors, specific unblinded statisticians  and programmers, and the independent 
DSMB. Further personnel were to be unblinded  in case criteria for efficacy were met at any of the pre-
specified analyses. 
An opaque sleeve over the syringe used for injection was to maintain  the blind at the time  of injection, 
as the doses containing mRNA-1273  look different than placebo. The vaccine was administered by 
unblinded site staff while all further assessments and interactions were performed by blinded staff. 
COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 cases were adjudicated by a blinded Adjudication Committee (AC). 
Correctly assuming treatment allocation seems likely for those patients  with  pronounced and typical 
reactogenicity pattern.  The same concern applies for blinded study personnel accessing eCRFs. The 
impact this  may have had on study results, if any, cannot be estimated.  
Per study protocol (up to Amendment 5) participants were to remain blinded until  the end of study 
visits after 25 months of enrolment. This plan was later revised to allow individual participants to be 
unblinded upon request in December 2020 when all participants have reached the day 57 visit. As per 
protocol amendment 6 (dated 23  Dec 2020),  the applicant plans to offer unblinding  to all participants 
at once under the  EUA authorisation. No suitable analysis plan for the unblinded study part is currently 
in place (see efficacy discussion, section 2.5.3).   
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis set was defined as the  Per Protocol set (PPS) consisting of all 
randomised participants without  major protocol deviations or virologic/immunologic evidence of prior 
COVID-19 who received all planned doses of study medication. Supportive efficacy analyses were 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 88/169 
 
 
 
 
defined in the Full Analysis Set  (FAS; all randomised participants with  at least one study dose 
regardless of previous COVID-19 infection)  and the modified ITT (mITT) set (all participants in FAS 
without  virologic/immunologic evidence of prior COVID-19).  
The primary endpoint was defined as the vaccine efficacy (VE) to prevent COVID-19 starting from 14 
days after second dose. In the  statistical analysis plan (SAP) it was further defined that  adjudicated 
cases were to  be preferably used for the primary endpoint when available. In the presented primary 
analysis adjudicated cases only were used. The primary endpoint was to be evaluated using Cox 
proportional hazards regression with Efron's method of tie handling, stratification  factors as used for 
randomisation and treatment  group as covariate. VE was calculated as 1 – HR (hazard rate), with  a 2-
sided score-based 95% CI and 2-sided p-value for testing H0:  VE≤30%. Adjusted 95% confidence 
intervals taking interim  analyses into account were to be provided. In the study protocol, the applicant 
defined a primary estimand, which  was not  fully comprehensible, not well defined, and not  aligned with 
the primary estimate. The primary estimate was acceptable however. In the primary analysis, 
participants were censored for COVID-19 cases prior to day 14 after the second dose and deaths 
unrelated to COVID-19 at any time. Censoring patients  from the risk set before the first countable 
event apparently corresponds to an analysis excluding those participants. Furthermore, participants 
who missed a dose of study treatment  or who were SARS-CoV-2 positive at baseline were excluded 
from the  PP analysis.  
To account for two  interim and one final analysis after 53, 106,  and 151 COVID-19 events in the 
primary endpoint, a Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming approximation spending function  was foreseen. The 
actual timing  of analyses markedly deviated from the  original plan. The first interim analysis was 
conducted after 95  adjudicated cases, the  second interim analysis was seemingly dropped, and the 
final analysis was conducted after 196  adjudicated cases. Regarding the operational system in place to 
monitor case-accrual during trial conduct, with  focus on safeguarding trial  integrity and keeping the 
blind, all personnel involved in decision making regarding the trigger for the first IA were kept fully 
blinded to treatment assignment. Furthermore, the severe overrunning occurred due to the speed up 
of the pandemic and due to safety data requirements as set out  by the FDA. While these arguments 
are in principle understood, they do not explain why the interim analyses were not conducted as 
scheduled. Decisions based on accruing information cannot be fully excluded. However, also given the 
compelling efficacy results, the  impact of the  deviation from pre-planned primary efficacy evaluation 
on the assessment of vaccination benefit is considered low. 
In the SAP three key secondary endpoints were defined, which  were to be tested at the  full 2.5% 
significance level if the primary endpoint was met in any of the  interim or final analyses. These 
endpoints were to  be tested in  a hierarchical pre-defined order: 
1.  COVID-19 regardless of evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (same follow-up period) 
2. 
infection regardless of symptomatology or severity (same follow-up  period) 
3.  severe COVID-19 (with ≥20  cases, otherwise to test at the  end of the study) 
As discussed in Hung  et al. (J. Biopharm. Stat.  2007; 17:1201–1210)  and Glimm et al. (Statist. Med. 
2010;  29: 219-228)  this  procedure does not control the type 1 error in the strong sense and 
substantial error inflation  is possible. While formally the  type 1 error of the overall study was not 
controlled, no relevant impact on the primary endpoint analysis is seen. 
Subgroup analyses were predefined for a range of important subgroups based on risk factors, age, sex 
and race.

Results 
The first participant-first visit/dose in the study occurred on 27 July 2020,  and the last participant-first 
visit/dose on 23  October 2020  (enrolment completed on 23 October 2020).  
There were 30,420 participants  randomised, of which  30,351  (99.8%) received at least one injection. 
Of the 30,351  participants who received a first injection, 29,328  (96.6%)  received a second injection 
by 25 November 2020.  Median study duration was 92 days (range: 1-122 days) from randomisation; 
median follow-up after the  second dose was 63 days, i.e. 9 weeks (range: 0-97  days). 
Participant flow 
Recruitment 
Enrolment of P301 was completed in  less than 3 months  on 23 October 2020  with  a total  of 30,420 
randomised participants. The study is since ongoing. Follow-up milestones and corresponding subject

Conduct of the study 
The study has gone through extensive changes. The currently available study protocol version is 
Version 6, dated 23 December 2020, which  details the modification of the unblinding process after EUA 
authorisation in the  USA. The study now consists of two parts, the blinded Part A and the  unblinded 
follow-up in Part B. Protocol version 4 and 5 were provided and the main amendments in the  study 
protocol include clarifications for safety surveillance and the aim to increase to 50% the upper limit  for 
stratification of enrolled participants  considered “at risk” at  screening. No other versions of the study 
protocol were provided. Important amendments with  potential implications for case 
detection/adjudication were made at a time point where no biased impact on the primary efficacy 
readout is assumed. 
Baseline  data 
Study mRNA-1273-P301  was designed to evaluate the  safety and efficacy of the IP in adults 18  years 
of age and older who have no known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection but whose locations or 
circumstances put  them at appreciable risk of acquiring COVID-19 and/or SARS-CoV-2 infection.  
The study planned to enrol at least 25%  and up to  50% of participants most at risk for severe 
complications of COVID-19, including those ≥ 65 years of age or < 65 years of age with  co-morbid 
Assessment report

medical conditions  such as diabetes mellitus (Type 1, Type 2, or gestational),  significant cardiac 
disease, chronic pulmonary disease, severe obesity, liver disease, and human immunodeficiency virus 
infection (actual enrolment in these 2 strata was 25.3% and 16.7%,  respectively). Overall, the study 
included 42% of participants at high  risk for severe COVID-19 (i.e., the sum of participants < 65  and 
at risk and ≥65  years). 
Overall, the demographic characteristics were well balanced between the study populations. Individuals 
at risk of severe COVID-19, i.e. 18 to 64  years with identified risk factors such as underlying chronic 
diseases, and elderly ≥65 years of age, are adequately represented and are equally distributed 
between the two treatment  groups according to their risk factors. 
In addition, a high proportion of individuals with  high  risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to their 
occupation such as health  care and frontline  workers were enrolled. The majority (25.1%)  of 
participants with  a specified occupational risk for acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 were health  care workers.  
Distribution of elderly subjects over 65 years of age was well balanced between the two  treatment 
groups. A substantial  proportion (n=  7520;  ~25%) of the population in  the pivotal trial P301 was aged 
65 or older. Approximately 12% (n=  3722) of the total  population was 65-69,  about 8% (n=2398)  was 
aged 70-74,  about 3%  (n=975) was in the  age range between 75 and 79,  and 1.4% or 425 subjects 
were 80  or older. 
The percentage of participants  enrolled who self-reported as Black or African American (10.2%)  or 
Hispanic or Latino (20.5%)  approached that  of the US population  (US Census Bureau 2019:  Black 
[13.4%],  Hispanic or Latino [18.5%]).  Communities of colour represented 37.2%  of the  study 
population.

Overall, 2.2% of participants (~700)  had detectable viral RNA or antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at 
baseline across both  arms. 
High  level data on co-medication were presented upon request (not  displayed here), showing largely 
balanced co-medication use for the first two  months of study with  paracetamol and ibuprofen being the 
main exceptions with  a large overuse observed in the mRNA-1273  vaccine arm (i.e. double the patient 
level incidence or more compared to placebo). This is likely explained by the acute AE profile of 
vaccination and not  related to baseline imbalances. 
Numbers analysed 
As of 21  November 2020, a total of 30,420  individuals were randomly assigned with 15,210  subjects 
each enrolled either in  the mRNA-1273 group or the placebo group. In the randomised set 15,181 
(99.8%)  and 15,170 (99.8%)  received their first dose of either mRNA-1273 or placebo, respectively, 
and 14,711  (96.7%) and 14,617  (96.1%)  received their second dose of mRNA-1273 and placebo, 
respectively. As the study is currently ongoing, the number of patients  who received the second dose is 
still  expected to rise.

death (10).  Out of 29,148 subjects randomised, 680  subjects were excluded due to laboratory 
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to  dose 1, i.e. the mITT set represents 95.8% of the randomised 
population. In FAS, baseline RT-PCR test results were missing in 1.2%  of participant;  baseline serology 
as measured by SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid binding antibody test  results were missing in 1.1% of 
participants. Approximately 2.2% of participants were baseline SARS-CoV-2 positive.

Outcomes and estimation 
Two analyses of efficacy were performed: an interim analysis based on data snapshot 1 (11 November 
2020;  cut-off date for efficacy 7 November 2020)  and the final analysis based on data snapshot 2 (25 
November 2020;  cut-off date for efficacy 21 November 2020).  There were 95 and 196 adjudicated 
cases of COVID-19 14 days or more after the second dose included in each analysis, respectively. 
Primary efficacy endpoint as determined in the interim analysis (data cut-off 7 November 2020) 
The inferential statistical analysis of vaccine efficacy based on the interim analysis was performed on 
95 adjudicated cases of COVID-19 accrued in the Per-Protocol set, with  5 cases occurring in  the mRNA-
1273  group and 90 cases occurring in the placebo group. 
The analysis indicates a vaccine efficacy (VE) point  estimate of 94.5%  (unadjusted 95% CI: 86.5, 
97.8;  p <0.0001)  for prevention of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in subjects without  evidence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection prior dose 1. The adjusted 95%  CI, reflecting the additional uncertainty due to 
interim analyses, was reported as (81.8%, 98.3%).  The primary objective was met.  
Primary efficacy endpoint as determined in the final analysis (data cut-off  21 November 2020) 
The final efficacy analysis was conducted on the efficacy data set as of 21  November 2020, which 
included 28,207  participants in the PP set with  a median follow-up time of 9 weeks after the second 
dose. A total  of 196  adjudicated COVID-19 cases were accrued and the estimated VE was 94.1%  (95% 
CI 89.3%, 96.8%).  These results support the conclusion on vaccine efficacy based on the first interim 
analysis.

Cases starting 14 days after the second dose. All potential COVID-19 cases starting 14 days after the second dose in the clinical

the data cut-off date for efficacy). 
* Incidence rate is defined as the number of subjects with an event divided by the number of subjects at risk and adjusted by 
person-years (total time at risk) in each treatment group. The 95% CI is calculated using the exact method (Poisson distribution)

Supplementary analyses of the  primary endpoint (based on data cut-off 21  November 2020) 
Based on the mITT set, which includes all participants in the FAS who had no immunologic or virologic 
evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 at Day 1 before the first dose, the  VE 14  days 
after dose 2 was estimated to be 93.6% (95%  CI 88.5;  96.4).  This suggests that  the reasons 
rendering subjects ineligible for PPS had no major impact on VE, thus  refuting potential selection bias.

The cumulative incidence rates of COVID-19 starting  after randomisation, which corresponds to day 1, 
start to continuously  increase in the placebo group thereafter while they remain low in  the vaccine 
group. However, it  is noted that a high percentage of individuals in the mITT set has received a second 
dose (i.e. mRNA-1273:  97.7%  and placebo: 97.0%).  This analysis, closer to the ITT principle than the 
primary analysis, by accounting for all cases accruing after IP administration and less stringent in set 
eligibility, further serves to support VE. This also applies for a similar analysis done in  the full analysis 
set (FAS).

Vaccine efficacy to prevent severe COVID-19 
The vaccine efficacy analysis presented for prevention of severe cases of COVID-19 shows that no 
cases occurred in the mRNA-1273  group but 30 severe COVID-19 cases were reported in  the placebo 
group indicating protection from development of severe COVID-19 starting 14 days after dose 2 up to 
the data cut-off.

Based on a less stringent  definition of a case of COVID-19 with  only one symptom present at time of 
reporting (as defined by CDC) and a confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR in subjects 
without  evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to dose 1, the VE at 14 days after dose 2 was 
estimated to be 95.1% (95%  CI 91.1;  97.3).

Vaccine efficacy to prevent death caused by COVID-19  
In the PP set, one participant died due to COVID-19 in  the placebo group and none in the  vaccine 
group during the course of the study. 
VE to prevent COVID-19 starting  14 days after dose 2 regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection 
Vaccine efficacy regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is consistent with  VE in subjects without  prior 
evidence of SARS-CoV-2. Based on the FAS population VE at 14  days after dose 2 was estimated to  be 
93.6%  (95% CI 88.6; 98.6)  in subjects with or without  evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to dose 
1. Evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, however, was reported only in  approx. 2.2% of study 
participants suggesting a low infection rate in the general population  at time of enrolment.

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses of vaccine efficacy confirmed that  efficacy was consistent  across major 
demographic and baseline characteristics. Although the clinical development was solely performed in 
the USA, the demographic characteristics are relevant for the  European population too in general.  
Based on the primary efficacy endpoint to prevent COVID-19 starting 14  days after the  2nd dose in 
subjects without  prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, results of subgroup analysis of VE according 
to specific age subgroups are presented below. The vaccine efficacy of mRNA-1273  indicates good 
protection from COVID-19 although with  lower efficacy estimates in the ≥65  to <75  years old (82.4%; 
95% CI: 46.9;  93.9) and an estimated VE of 100%  in subjects aged 75 years and older.  
As regards subjects 75 years of age and older, the number included in  the study and the number of 
cases observed are limited as few participants  were enrolled in this  age group and the median follow-
up was of approx. 9 weeks post-dose 2.  Long-term protection from disease remains unknown for the 
time being including for subjects of high-risk groups.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal phase 3 clinical trial mRNA-1273-P301  is a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
observer blind, efficacy and safety study. Since the study is case-driven, high number of centres and 
rate of enrolment together with  planned interim analyses for early evaluation of vaccine efficacy 
resulted in a short time to last patient enrolled/vaccinated and primary efficacy readouts. This resulted 
in short follow-up duration and, related to that,  the inability to  inform long-term efficacy and safety 
objectives at present. Two data snapshots with  data cut-off date 7 November 2020  and 21 November 
2020  were provided for assessment. Of note,  these snapshots are not  fully cleaned, monitored and 
validated as opposed to usual data base locks. The dose for phase 3 was selected based on emergent 
safety and immunogenicity data from the phase 1 study 20-0003  and supported by the  reactogenicity 
data after dose 2 from the  phase 2a P201 study. Immunogenicity results from the phase 2a study were 
not available at the  time of the  dose selection.  
All studies are ongoing. The study duration of the pivotal study is 24 months after the second dose to 
collect long-term efficacy, immunogenicity and safety data. Currently, efficacy data are available from 
a median duration of 9 weeks after the second dose. 
The study population comprises subjects 18 years of age and older including individuals with 
underlying but stable chronic disease (e.g. diabetes, chronic lung disease, obesity) and elderly subjects 
over 65 years of age with  a substantial proportion over 75 years known to have an increased risk of 
development of severe disease, hospitalisation and death following  SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Randomisation was stratified based on age and, if participants were < 65 years of age, based on the 
presence or absence of risk factors for severe illness from COVID-19 according to  CDC 
recommendation as of March 2020.  With  protocol amendment 4 the applicant aimed to increase the 
enrolment of these two  high-risk groups to achieve higher inclusion rates: at least 25% and up to 50% 
of enrolled participants, were planned to  be either ≥ 65  years of age, or < 65  years of age but  at risk 
for severe COVID-19 at screening. A high proportion of the finally randomised study population 
represents these two high-risk groups (25.3% and 16.7%,  respectively). In addition,  individuals with a 
high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to their occupation such as health care and frontline workers 
were included (82%,  of which 25% heath care workers).  
Recruitment was limited to the US (99  study sites overall). There are no major intrinsic/extrinsic 
differences seen between regions to question  applicability of main efficacy results to the EU given 
study objectives and main endpoints. It is also considered that  the time of study conduct had no 
negative impact on generalisability of results to the  present situation  due to relative stability of 
dominant US/EU  clades during phase 3 and since then.  
Pregnant and breastfeeding women were excluded from the  studies as this  vaccine class is new and no 
vaccine was yet approved based on Moderna’s mRNA technology platform at the  time the trials were 
initiated.  Based on lack of experience in humans and the fact that  animal data from the DART study 
was only available very recently after study start, this  approach is supported. In addition,  no immune 
suppressed subjects or subjects with  immunodeficiencies were enrolled except for a limited number of 
HIV infected individuals. This approach is considered acceptable for a pivotal study, moreover 
conducted during an emergency situation, to avoid exposing vulnerable population before having a 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 105/169 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clear understanding of the benefits of the vaccine. Further data on immunocompromised individuals 
are needed (see requirements for post-authorisation in Section 2.7 on RMP). 
The primary efficacy endpoint specified in the study is prevention of COVID-19 starting 14 days post-
dose 2 in  individuals with  no prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections before receiving any study 
treatment. Secondary efficacy endpoints include prevention of severe COVID-19 in baseline 
seronegative subjects, prevention of COVID-19 regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 
prevention of asymptomatic infection.  
The primary analysis population was the per protocol (PP) set defined as all subjects without  major 
protocol deviations who received all planned doses of the  study treatment and who had not developed 
COVID-19 prior to the second dose. In the protocol the acceptable window for receiving the second 
dose was defined as -3/+7  days around day 28. At  the time of definition of major protocol deviations, 
which was to happen before unblinding,  the acceptable visit window  was widened to days 21 – 42 (-
7/+14  days around the interval of 28 days). The impact of this  change cannot be fully assessed at this 
point in  time. Only around 600 study  participants in the PP set were outside the initially defined 
window but  fell in the widened window. Consequently it is considered that  the widening will  not 
negatively impact the study outcome but  does not add relevant information. Additional analyses were 
to be conducted in the modified intent-to-treat  (mITT) set including all baseline SARS-CoV-2 negative 
participants who received at least one dose of the  study treatment and the full analysis set (FAS) 
including all randomised patients  (i.e. regardless of serostatus) who received at least one dose of study 
treatment. 
Conducting the  primary analysis in subjects who receive the two  doses as scheduled without  (other) 
major protocol deviation (i.e. PPS) only, and furthermore counting cases for the primary analysis only 
14 days after the second dose onwards is acceptable (and was pre-specified as such), but this  has 
evident implications for the  target of estimation.  Aligned with  the ITT principle and the  subjects being 
exposed to potential IP-related risks already after the first dose, analyses investigating vaccine efficacy 
in preventing cases occurring already after the first dose and in a broader analysis set thus have been 
considered in addition. 
Assessment of probable COVID-19 cases was carried out following reporting by study participants of at 
least two systemic or one respiratory clinical sign/symptom recognised to be predictive of COVID-19 
(predefined) and subsequent laboratory confirmation of infection  of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs or 
saliva samples by RT-PCR.  
Nasal swabs and saliva samples were either collected at the  study site or through  self-collection by 
individuals. The RT-PCR assay is acceptably validated and additional validation studies to evaluate 
stability of clinical samples at various temperatures and freeze/thawing cycles to cover shipping and 
storage conditions  were provided. Data are available to assure that  reliable results are obtained by 
self-collection and shipping  of samples. 
Besides RT-PCR testing  at time of randomisation, evaluation of seropositivity by employing a SARS-
CoV-2 specific nucleocapsid IgG ELISA was performed to confirm any asymptomatic infection  prior to 
vaccination. The assay was validated and all specified acceptance criteria are met. This assay is used 
also to  assess two secondary efficacy endpoints (combined evaluation of prevention of COVID-19 as 
determined by RT-PCR and of asymptomatic infection  as determined by seroconversion in those who 
were seronegative at baseline; prevention of asymptomatic infection).  Data on these secondary 
efficacy endpoints are not available for the time being and should be submitted as soon as they 
become available (see list  of recommendations in Annex I).

During rolling review assessment, it was found difficult  (also due to the  operational and time 
constraints) to completely comprehend the process from incident  COVID-19 symptom occurrence in a 
study participant to  final decision as to whether or not  a ‘case’ was declared (and considered for 
primary efficacy analyses). This relates to roles of site investigators, sponsor, CRO and Adjudication 
Committee, DSMB all involved in  this process, procedural rules and pre-specification, and 
documentation/comprehensibility of decisions made at different steps throughout.  In principle, all 
suspected COVID-19 cases were to be adjudicated by a central, blinded Adjudication Committee (AC). 
This is endorsed. At the time of the provided data snapshots none of the cases that occurred prior to 
dose 2 and not  all suspected cases 14 days after the second dose were adjudicated. This leads to  some 
uncertainties for the primary analysis regarding the exclusion/censoring or early COVID-19 cases, and 
for sensitivity and (key) secondary analyses. The lack of full adjudication of suspect cases after 14 
days of the second dose mainly reduces the  number of observed cases. As it  was stated  that both  the 
Sponsor and the AC were to be blinded in the adjudication process, it  is assumed that adjudicated 
cases are a random subset of all suspect cases. Hence, no substantial bias is to be expected for the 
primary analysis based on adjudicated cases. Analyses based on all adjudicated cases are said to be 
provided with  the final CSR. Overall, no major uncertainties  remain that  would alter benefit/risk 
conclusions. However, it  cannot be entirely ruled out that  some source of bias occurred during case 
monitoring/processing and that  the efficacy estimation may be optimistic  to a certain degree. 
Immunogenicity endpoints were defined in the study protocol to evaluate binding and neutralising 
antibody responses following vaccination in a subset of study participants. These endpoints are 
appropriately chosen and relevant to  assess any decline of antibody responses over time and to 
eventually bridge to other populations not included in the  current clinical development. Any attempts 
to define a correlate of protection or surrogate marker for protection are supported. Assay validation is 
pending and no immunogenicity results from study P301 are yet available. These data should be 
provided with  the final study report. 
The study was planned to be observer blind and all relevant sponsor personnel and participants were 
to remain blinded until the  end of study visit after 25 months of enrolment. With  protocol amendment 
6 the applicant planned to offer unblinding to all participants  at once at the  time of the  US Emergency 
Use Authorisation. This is not endorsed from a scientific point  of view. As outlined in EMA’s 
considerations on COVID-19 vaccine approval (EMA/592928/2020)  it  is “recommended that clinical 
trial participants should be followed for safety and efficacy within  their randomised groups for at  least 
one year after completing vaccination” whenever feasible. More mature study data with  a longer 
follow-up are required despite positive early (interim) analyses. Hence, the applicant should thoroughly 
consider pre-planning analyses in a dedicated supplementary SAP (sSAP; to be submitted to EMA  as 
soon as available), which  allows to  extract the best available information from the ongoing Phase 3 
study with  respect to duration of protection, correlate of protection, vaccine-enhanced disease, and 
other long-term safety data. This sSAP should be further discussed and agreed with  the EMA. The 
applicant is recommended to seek EMA scientific advice (see list  of recommendations, Annex I). 
Two interim and one final analyses were planned after 53, 106  and 151 accrued cases. In the conduct 
of the study, the timing  and number of analyses was changed. The first interim analysis was conducted 
after 95 adjudicated cases. The second interim analysis was dropped. The final analysis was conducted 
after 196 adjudicated cases for the primary endpoint  instead of 151  cases. At both analyses severe 
overrunning was obvious. The applicant explained that  the modified timing  of analyses was mainly 
based on safety data requirements as set out  by FDA and that overrunning occurred due to  the speed 
up of the pandemic. While these arguments are in principle understood, these reasons are not 
sufficient to well justify the  observed changes. Potential opportunistic choices based on accruing 
Assessment report

Page 107/169 
 
 
 
 
information cannot be fully excluded. The impact of the deviation from pre-planned primary efficacy 
evaluation on the  assessment of vaccination benefit is considered low. 
The primary endpoint was analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model accounting for 
stratification factors. Vaccine efficacy was estimated as 1 – HR  (hazard ratio). The same methods were 
to be used for comparable secondary endpoints. A sensitivity analysis using a Fine and Gray model 
accounting for competing risks due to early COVID-19 cases before the second dose or deaths 
unrelated to COVID-19 was provided. 
Multiplicity  control for primary and key secondary endpoints was defined in the SAP. The proposed 
procedure does not control the  type 1 error for secondary endpoints in the strong sense and 
substantial error inflation  is possible. The conclusion on the primary endpoint is not considered to be 
impacted. 
In conclusion, the design and conduct  of the  study were appropriate overall and were in line with  the 
requirements as laid down in the Guideline on clinical evaluation of new Vaccines 
(EMA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005)  and as recommended via Scientific Advice. The primary and 
secondary efficacy objectives as defined in  the phase 3 study are of clinical relevance and follow ICMRA 
recommendations for the  evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines (ICMRA SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines Workshop; 
July 2020).  The pivotal study is still  ongoing. Participant retention is very high based on information up 
to the latest  reported cut-off point.  Close to 90%  of participants had at least 4 weeks of follow-up after 
the second dose and around 55%  had been followed for at least 2 months.  Follow-up is short, but  this 
is acceptable given the circumstances of the ongoing SARS-COV-2 pandemic. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Vaccine efficacy according to the  primary efficacy endpoint was demonstrated on an interim analysis 
with  data cut-off date of 7 November 2020 including  27,817 individuals in the  PP set, when 95  cases 
were accrued. The inferential analysis at this  first interim analysis indicated a VE point estimate of 
94.5%  with an adjusted 95% CI of 81.8%, 98.3%  (unadjusted 95% CI: 86.5%,  97.8%; p <0.0001). 
VE was confirmed in the final efficacy analyses with data cut-off  date 21  November 2020 after accrual 
of 196 adjudicated COVID-19 cases based on the efficacy population of 28,207  subjects (overall 
efficacy 94.1% CI not adjusted for multiplicity 89.3,  96.8).  The final efficacy evaluation is based on a 
median follow-up of 9  weeks. The study  is ongoing and further data on long-term protection are 
expected with  the final study report. 
The disposition of study participants in the various analyses sets were well balanced across treatment 
groups. Few individuals withdrew from the study and only a very small number due to occurrence of an 
AE. Based on the provided data in the PP set, the three risk strata were well balanced between placebo 
and mRNA-1273 with  n = 16,631  (59.8%)  participants <65  years of age and not  at risk, n =  4,159 
(15.0%)  participants < 65 years of age and at risk, and n = 7,026 (25.3%)  participants ≥  65 years of 
age. 
VE to prevent COVID-19 of any severity was high  in the per protocol population starting  14 days post-
dose 2,  which included subjects without  prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before dose 1.  
Regarding severe COVID-19, 30 cases were reported for placebo and no cases for the vaccine arm. 
Vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 was thus  estimated to be 100%  (95% CI 87.0%,  NE). One 
severe COVID-19 case in the vaccine group was reported as SAE but was not adjudicated at the time 
of the data snapshot. Given the low numbers of severe cases, further follow up data are needed to 
consolidate the observed protective effect against severe COVID-19. Based on limited case narratives 
there were 9 hospitalisations among those cases (of which 2 ICU admitted of which one fatal). The 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 108/169 
 
 
 
 
majority of the severe cases were adjudicated as such based on SpO2 below the defining threshold of 
93% for varying duration. Whereas reassuring for efficacy across varying disease severity, the cases 
overall seem mostly mild, which is a limitation  of the  dataset. Reflecting these findings in  SmPC 5.1 
should account for the  available information about  severity of cases observed thus far. 
At the second data snapshot (final  analysis), VE was 94.1%  (95%  CI 89.3%,  96.8%).  Of note, one 
subject in the placebo group died of COVID-19 while none died in  the vaccine group. The Fine  and 
Gray model based on the mITT set accounting for competing events confirmed the primary analysis 
with  a VE of 94.2%  (95% CI: 89.6%, 96,7%). 
These results are confirmed when a less stringent definition  of COVID-19 based on only one clinical 
symptom according to CDC was employed. 
For sensitivity analysis in mITT population and counting cases from dose 1 onwards, which include all 
individuals without  prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before the first dose was given, but 
regardless whether they received a full 2-dose regimen or not,  again high  vaccine efficacy was 
estimated. Cumulative incidence rates were increasing constantly  after randomisation in the placebo 
group but remained low in  the vaccine group. Although these analyses suggest that  one dose might 
provide some protection, a very high percentage of individuals in the mITT set received the second 
dose and the vast majority of subjects received their second dose within  the specified window of 23-36 
days after the first dose. No definitive conclusion on clinical efficacy after one dose can be drawn based 
on the very short time window between the two  doses and consequently very few cases.  
Based on the FAS population, which  included individuals with  and without  prior evidence of SARS-CoV-
2 infection at randomisation, no difference in vaccine efficacy was reported compared to vaccine 
efficacy estimated in subjects without  prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 prior to dose 1.   
In addition, subgroup analyses showed that  vaccine efficacy is consistent across different risk groups, 
subjects with various underlying diseases and different demographic characteristics. VE decreases with 
the number of risk factors for severe COVID-19 from 95.1%  (95% CI: 89.6, 97.7;  no risk factors), 
91.7%  (95% CI: 73.0, 97.4;  one risk factor) to 87.2% (95%  CI: -2.7, 98.4;  2 or more risk factors). 
Given the very low number of participants with  more than one risk factor, this trend cannot be 
confirmed. Since the risk of severe disease with hospitalisation and death is specifically high with 
increasing age further analyses of VE following stratification  in finer age categories was presented. 
Given the few participants (n  = 1318) above 75  and only 7 accrued cases in the  placebo arm (none in 
the active arm) no reliable estimates in this  group can be derived. VE is consistent  in the over 65-year 
olds, although a slightly lower VE was estimated (86.4%,  95% CI: 61.4,  95.2). 
No information is currently available on prevention from asymptomatic infection and these data should 
be provided with  the clinical study report for part A of the study as soon as these data become 
available (see list  of recommendations in Annex I).  
Only a small number of HIV positive subjects were enrolled. Individuals under immunosuppressive or 
immune-modifying therapy or immunodeficient patients were excluded from the pivotal study. As some 
of these individuals depending on the level of immunosuppression might  not develop an appropriate 
immune response following a two-dose regimen, further doses might  be needed to  achieve appropriate 
protection. This is reflected in the  SmPC section 4.4 and the RMP (see section 2.7)  includes studies to 
be conducted post-authorisation in these populations. 
Co-administration with  other vaccines was not  investigated, hence this should be followed up post-
authorisation (see section 2.7  on RMP).

No data on pregnant women and breastfeeding women is available as these were excluded from the 
study. Dedicated studies are planned in the  post-authorisation phase as indicated in the RMP  (see 
section 2.7).  
As already mentioned in section 2.4.2,  no information is available on cross-neutralisation to evaluate 
whether the vaccine protects against all circulating strains. No gene sequence data on SARS-CoV-2 
strains detected by RT-PCR in the mRNA-1273 vaccine or the placebo group are available. These data 
are important  to assess the capability of the  vaccine to protect against currently circulating rare or 
non-dominant strains and newly emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 (see list  of recommendations in 
Annex I). 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The final clinical study report for study mRNA-1273-P301  will be submitted no later than December 
2022  and is subject to a specific obligation  laid down in the MA, to provide long term follow up data, 
including data to  confirm efficacy in subgroups or data on specific endpoints  that were not yet available 
at the time this  assessment was carried out. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the data available for the  COVID-19 vaccine developed by Moderna, a robust and high 
protective vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 (94.1%  CI 89.3, 96.8)  was shown in individuals aged 18 
years and older without  evidence of prior SARS-Cov2 infection. Vaccine efficacy was consistent  across 
relevant subgroups including elderly subjects and subjects considered at  increased risk of severe 
disease due to underlying chronic disease. 
It is likely that  the vaccine also protects against severe COVID-19, though these events were limited  in 
the study and the definition  of severe COVID-19 could have been more stringent from a clinical 
perspective. It is presently not  known if the  vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its 
impact on viral transmission. The duration of protection is not known.  
As regards a robust estimation of lower bound of the  CI for VE, there remain open questions, partly 
due to lack of documentation/nature of RR, partly due to some residual doubts as to case 
ascertainment in the pivotal study. None of these issues are however expected to have impacted either 
the reported efficacy estimates or the overall benefit profile to a degree that  would raise important 
concerns. 
The CHMP considers the  following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional  MA: 
• 
The final clinical study report will  be submitted  no later than  December 2022 and is subject to 
a specific obligation laid down in the  MA. This will provide long-term data.  
Regarding missing data to confirm efficacy in subpopulations that  were not studied or whose data are 
limited please refer to  sections 2.7  and 3.3. 
In addition, certain data should be provided as soon as they become available and are defined in 
several recommendations to the applicant (see Annex I).

2.6.  Clinical safety 
2.6.1.  Patient exposure 
The safety of mRNA-1273 has been examined in  a clinical development program comprising 15,420 
subjects exposed to a dose of 100  µg. 35 subjects were enrolled in the phase 1  study P101, 200 were 
enrolled in the  phase 2 study P201 and 15,185  (Safety Dataset, cut-off 25 November 2020)  were 
enrolled in the  pivotal phase 3 trial P301. 
In the phase 3  trial, slightly more male (52.7%)  than female (47.3%)  subjects were recruited, of 
whom the majority was White  (79.2%),  followed by Black or African American (10.2%)  and Asian 
(4.6%).  24.8% of the recruited subjects were ≥ 65 years of age. Among subjects <65  years of age, 
16.7%  of the  total population had risk factors for severe COVID-19. In the total  study population, 
subjects had the following risk factors: diabetes (9.5%),  severe obesity (6.7%),  significant cardiac 
disease (4.9%),  chronic lung  disease (4.8%), liver disease (0.6%), and HIV infection (0.6%).  The 
majority of subjects were seronegative at baseline for SARS-CoV-19, except for 680  subjects (2.2%) 
with  a positive baseline serostatus (FAS). The mean BMI was 29.32  in both arms. 
Among the 30,351  subjects in the  safety set, 82.2%  had an occupational risk for infection with  SARS-
CoV-19 (e.g. health care workers [25.1%],  educators or students [10.2%],  retail or restaurant 
operations [6.4%]).   
Overall, there were no clinically meaningful differences in the  treatment groups of the safety set 
regarding demographics, risk factors, or SARS-CoV-2 status at baseline. 
At the latest  data cut-off  (25 November 2020),  of the 30,351  enrolled subjects (vaccine n=15,185, 
placebo n=15,166),  14,715 vaccine recipients and 14,613  placebo recipients have received the second 
vaccination. The median study follow-up after the second injection was 63.0  days.

2.6.2.  Adverse events 
Adverse events are reported up to  the data cut-off of 25 November 2020. 
Solicited Adverse Reactions 
Solicited local and systemic ARs with  an onset within  7 days after each injection (i.e., the day of dosing 
and 6 subsequent days) were assessed. Solicited ARs were recorded daily by the  study participants 
using eDiaries. The local solicited ARs included pain, erythema, swelling, and lymphadenopathy and 
the general solicited ARs included fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, and 
nausea/vomiting. Of note,  lymphadenopathy was defined as localised axillary swelling or tenderness 
ipsilateral to the vaccination arm. The eDiary solicited daily participant to report ARs using a structured 
checklist. If an AR persisted beyond Day 7,  the participant was prompted to continue to record until 
resolution.  
Solicited Local reactions 
Solicited local ARs were reported by a majority of participants in the mRNA-1273  group and were 
reported at a higher incidence in  the mRNA-1273 group (92.4%)  than in the  placebo group (29.3%) 
after any injection. The most common solicited local AR was pain, and the incidence was similar after 
the first and second injection  (vaccine: 83.7% post-dose 1, 88.2%  post-dose 2;  placebo: 17.5%  post-
dose 1,  17.0% post-dose 2). The other solicited local ARs were reported at a higher incidence after the 
second injection:  erythema (vaccine: 2.8% post-dose 1, 8.6%  post-dose 2; placebo: 0.4% after each 
dose), swelling (vaccine: 6.1% post-dose 1, 12.2%  post-dose 2;  placebo: 0.3% after each dose), and 
lymphadenopathy (vaccine: 10.2%  post-dose 1, 14.2% post-dose 2; placebo: 4.8% post-dose 1, 3.9% 
post-dose 2).  
The majority of solicited local ARs were grade 1 to  grade 2 in severity. In the mRNA-1273  group, grade 
3 solicited local ARs were more common after the second injection than  after the first injection  (7.0% 
versus 3.5%;  placebo: 0.5% after each injection);  the most common grade 3 solicited local AR after 
the second injection was pain (604  [4.1%]  participants). No grade 4 solicited local ARs were reported, 
and only grade 3 pain was reported at a frequency > 2% after either injection.  
The majority of the solicited local ARs in participants who received mRNA-1273 occurred within  the 
first 1 to 2  days after injection and generally persisted for a median of 1 to 3  days. There was a higher 
incidence of participants who  reported solicited local ARs that persisted beyond 7 days in the  mRNA-
1273  group than  in the placebo group after the first injection (2.2%  versus 0.7%, respectively) and 
after the second injection (2.1%  versus 0.7%). 
Solicited systemic reactions 
Solicited systemic ARs were reported by the majority of participants in the mRNA-1273  group and were 
more prevalent in  the mRNA-1273 group (84.1%)  than in the  placebo group (53.5%) after any IP 
injection. In the mRNA-1273  group, the incidence and severity of solicited systemic ARs appeared to 
increase after the  second injection. The solicited systemic ARs were reported with  the following 
incidences (PD  = post-dose):  
Fever (vaccine: 0.8%  PD1, 15.5% PD2; placebo: 0.3%  after each dose),  
Headache (vaccine: 32.7% PD1, 58.6% PD2; placebo: 26.6%  PD1, 23.4% PD2),  
Fatigue  (vaccine: 37.2% PD1, 65.3%  PD2; placebo: 27.3% PD1, 23.4% PD2),  
Myalgia (vaccine: 22.7%  PD1, 58.0%  PD2; placebo: 13.7% PD1, 12.4%  PD2),  
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 112/169 
 
 
 
 
Arthralgia (vaccine: 16.6% PD1, 42.8%  PD2, placebo: 11.8% PD1, 10.8% PD2),  
Nausea/vomiting (vaccine: 8.3%  PD1, 19%  PD2; placebo: 7.1% PD1, 6.4% PD2), and 
Chills (vaccine: 8.3%  PD1, 44.2%  PD2; placebo: 5.8% PD1, 5.6%  PD2).  
The majority of solicited systemic ARs were grade 1 to grade 2 in severity. In the mRNA-1273 group, 
grade 3 solicited systemic ARs were more common after the second injection than  after the first 
injection (15.8%  versus 2.9%%; placebo: ~2% after each injection). In the mRNA-1273  group, grade 
3 solicited systemic ARs after the  second injection occurred at the following incidences: fever 1.4%, 
headache 4.5%,  fatigue 9.7%, myalgia 9%,  arthralgia 5.2%,  nausea/vomiting 0.1%,  and chills 1.3%. 
After the first injection, grade 4 solicited systemic ARs were reported by 5 participants in  the vaccine 
group vs. 6 participants  in the placebo group. After the  second injection, grade 4  events occurred in 14 
vs. 3 subjects. Nearly all grade 4 events were fever >40°C, except for single reports of fatigue, 
arthralgia and nausea/vomiting in the mRNA-1273  group. 
The majority of the solicited systemic ARs in participants who received mRNA-1273 occurred within  the 
first 1 to 2  days after IP injection and generally persisted for a median of 1 to 2 days. The incidence of 
participants who reported solicited systemic ARs that  persisted beyond 7 days after the  first injection 
(vaccine: 5.8%,  placebo: 5.7%)  and second injection (vaccine: 5.7%,  placebo: 4.9%)  was comparable 
between the groups. 
Unsolicited AEs 
Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the  28 days after each IP injection (i.e., the day of dosing 
and 27 subsequent days) were collected. Adverse events leading to discontinuation  from dosing and/or 
study participation, SAEs, and MAAEs (=  medically attended AEs, events leading to an unscheduled 
visit to a health care practitioner) are being collected through completion of the study or until 
withdrawal from the study.  
The incidences of unsolicited TEAEs (vaccine: 23.9%;  placebo: 21.6%),  severe TEAEs (1.5%; 1.3%), 
and MAAEs (9.0%; 9.7%)  during the 28 days after any injection were generally similar in participants 
who received mRNA-1273 and those who received placebo. The most commonly reported unsolicited 
AEs up to 28 Days After Any Injection (reported by at least 1% of participants in any group) were 
headache (vaccine: 3.1%  vs. placebo: 3.0%), cough (1.1%  vs. 1.0%),  oropharyngeal pain (1.0%  vs. 
1.3%),  diarrhoea (1.2% vs. 1.1%), arthralgia (1.4% vs. 1.1%),  myalgia (1.3% vs 1.2%),  fatigue 
(2.4%  vs. 2.2%),  and injection site pain (1.0% vs 0.4%). 
The majority of unsolicited TEAEs were considered not related to the IP; treatment-related TEAEs were 
reported in 8.2%  and 4.5% of participants in the mRNA-1273  and placebo groups, respectively. Until 
28 days after any vaccination, 0.5%  of subjects in the mRNA-1273  group reported severe TEAEs that 
were considered as treatment related (vs. 0.2%  in placebo). Treatment-related MAAEs were reported 
in 0.9%  and 0.5%  of participants in the mRNA-1273  and placebo groups, respectively. 
The incidence of SAEs during the  28 days after injection was low (0.6% overall), with  no notable 
differences between treatment groups (0.6%  for mRNA-1273 and 0.6% for placebo). Few  participants 
(< 0.1%  for mRNA-1273  and placebo groups) reported treatment-related SAEs (Table 21). 
The incidence of participants who discontinued IP due to TEAEs during the 28 days after injection was 
low (0.4%  overall), and discontinuations of IP due to TEAEs were less frequent in the mRNA-1273 
group than in the placebo group (0.3%  for mRNA-1273 and 0.5% for placebo).

Overall, also including  AEs that were reported after the  28 days after any injection (until  25 November 
2020),  the incidences of unsolicited AEs (vaccine: 26.7%;  placebo: 25.6%),  severe AEs (2.0%;  1.8%), 
and MAAEs (11.5%; 12.9%)  increased, but  the relative incidence between vaccine and placebo 
remained similar to the previously described incidences. Treatment-related unsolicited AEs were 
experienced by 8.3% in  the mRNA-1273 group, and by 4.6 % in the placebo group overall. 
In summary, the incidences of unsolicited AEs, severe AEs, serious AEs and medically-attended AEs 
(regardless of severity) were comparable between vaccine and placebo.  
However, there were some imbalances for certain preferred terms (PT) or system organ classes (SOC): 
Until  the data cut-off of 25 November 2020,  3 events of acute peripheral facial paralysis (Bell’s palsy) 
were reported in the mRNA-group, compared to 1 event in the placebo group.  
There were more reports of muscle spasms in the vaccine group (33 events, 0.2%) than  in the control 
group (19 events, 0.1%). The number of medically attended events (vaccine: 13  events, placebo: 9 
events) and events considered as treatment-related by the Investigator (vaccine: 5 events, placebo: 4 
events) were comparable. 
There were also more events of paraesthesia (29  vaccine, 26 placebo, treatment-related: 11  vs. 7), 
hypoaesthesia (12 vaccine, 8 placebo, treatment-related: 4 vs. 0)  and hyperaesthesia (6 vaccine, 0 
placebo, treatment-related: 5 vs. 0) in the  mRNA-1273 group. However, fewer events were reported 
for the PTs of pharyngeal paraesthesia (0 vaccine, 1 placebo), paraesthesia oral (2 vaccine, 4 placebo, 
treatment-related: 0 vs 4) and injection site paraesthesia (2 vaccine, 3 placebo, treatment-related: 1 
vs. 3). The number of medically attended events was in  total smaller in the  vaccine group 
(paraesthesia 6 vs. 9, hypoaesthesia 2 vs. 3,  hyperaesthesia 1 vs. 0) and only one subject in the 
placebo group reported serious paraesthesia.

The PT of gastroesophageal reflux disease was reported by 41  subjects (medically attended: 21 
events, treatment-related: 2 events) in the  vaccine group, compared to 18  subjects in  the placebo 
group (medically attended: 9 events, treatment-related: 0 events). Overall, the incidences of events in 
the SOC of gastrointestinal  disorders were similar (478  vs. 440 events). 
There was an imbalance for the events of insomnia (vaccine: 17 events vs. placebo: 14 events), 
abnormal dreams (5 vs. 0 events), sleep disorder (5 vs. 0 events), and nightmare (3  vs. 1 event). 
However, most of the reported events had an onset on day 1 or 2 and resolved within a few days. 
As described in a later section (2.6.6  Immunological events), a SMQ of hypersensitivity events 
revealed a slightly higher incidence of hypersensitivity events in the vaccine group versus the placebo 
group (1.5% vs. 1.1%, respectively), which was mainly driven by injection site rash (n=37  (0.2%)  vs. 
n=1 (<0.1%)),  injection site urticaria (n=15  (<0.1%)  vs. n=0)  and rash (n=45  (0.3%)  vs. n=  34 
(0.2%)).   
Based on the latest listing  of autoimmune events, there is an imbalance regarding the SOC Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (12 events in  the vaccine group vs. 4 events in placebo, PT psoriasis 4 
vs. 1). This imbalance was mainly caused by the  events of alopecia (7 vs. 3) and psoriasis (4 vs. 1). 
See the section “autoimmune diseases” below. 
Another imbalance was noted for the SOC of hepatobiliary disorders, with  15 events in  the vaccine 
group, compared to 3 events in  the placebo group. The disparity was mainly caused by the  events of 
cholelithiasis (vaccine: 6 events, placebo 1 event) and cholecystitis (vaccine: 4 events, placebo: none). 
At the present time it appears likely that this  imbalance is caused by chance. 
An imbalance was also observed for anaemia regardless of relationship to vaccine (1 case in the 
placebo group versus 10 cases in the  vaccine group). This imbalance was not  observed for cases of 
anaemia considered vaccine related (no case in the placebo and 1 case in the  vaccine group). It should 
be noted that the  listings of safety laboratory results submitted for the phase 1 and phase 2 trial did 
not reveal cases of anaemia. Haemoglobin levels were within  the normal range during all visits.  
2.6.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Among the 30,351  subjects with  a median follow-up  of 63  days, the incidence of SAEs was similar in 
the mRNA-1273  (1.0%, 147  events) and placebo (1.0%,  153 events) groups during the overall study 
period until  25 November 2020. 
However, there were some imbalances between the groups, with noticeably more subjects reporting 
SAEs in the  vaccine arm for the following SOCs, as described hereafter. 
More serious AEs were reported in the  vaccine group for the SOC of nervous system disorders (16 
subjects), compared to placebo (10  subjects). In study participants who  received the vaccine, 3 SAEs 
of cerebrovascular accident (1 placebo), 2 SAEs of embolic stroke (none in  placebo), and 1 SAE of 
transient ischaemic attack (none in placebo) were reported. However, none of these events were 
considered as related to vaccination by the  Investigator as all subjects had a significant medical history 
or increased risk for these events.  
In the SOC of vascular disorders there were 2 SAEs of deep vein thrombosis in the mRNA-1273  group 
(none in the placebo group). The Investigator did not  consider these events as treatment related.  
SOC Gastrointestinal disorders: vaccine 23  subjects vs. placebo 10 subjects; (e.g., abdominal pain 
upper [3 vs. 0],  nausea [3 vs. 1], colitis [2 vs. 1], diarrhoea [2 vs. 1], hiatus  hernia [2 vs. 1] and 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021

pancreatitis [1 vs. 0]). One subject experienced serious (Grade 4) events of nausea and intractable 
vomiting following the second dose of the vaccine that  required hospitalisation Day 3 following  dose 2. 
The event resolved after 7  days. The study participant had a medical history of headaches with  nausea 
that  led to  hospitalisation in the past.  
The PT of facial swelling was reported in 2 subjects in the mRNA-1273  group, compared to 1  event in 
the placebo group. Of note, both subjects in the  vaccine group received dermal filler injection prior to 
vaccination (one subject received a Botox/modified hyaluronic acid filler combination 11 days prior 
dose 2,  the other subject bilateral cheek injections of hyaluronic acid 5 months prior to enrolment). 
Both events resolved within  a week.  
The event of rheumatoid arthritis was reported once during the clinical trials. The event occurred in a 
subject with  a medical history of joint  pain. The participant  reported muscle and joint aches/pain in the 
e-diary on the same day as dose 1. Approximately 10 days post-Dose 1, the  participant experienced 
recurrent muscle joint aches/pain. The quality of the pain was different than the joint  aches/pain 
previously reported, with  the left knee and right  shoulder bothering him the most.  Approximately 29 
days post-Dose 1,  the participant saw a rheumatologist who noted a high level of CCP antibody and 
rheumatoid factor and diagnoses included rheumatoid arthritis and lateral epicondylitis. An SMQ for 
autoimmune related adverse events revealed 32 events in  the vaccine group vs. 28 events in the 
placebo group. At the time being, the  single event of RA does not raise a concern. Autoimmune 
disorders are listed as AESI in the RMP. 
Treatment-related SAE 
Until  the data cut-off, there were 7  subjects with  treatment-related SAEs in the  vaccine group, 
compared to 5 subjects in the placebo group. The treatment-related SAEs in the  mRNA group were B-
cell small lymphocytic lymphoma, autonomic system imbalance, dyspnoea, nausea and vomiting, 
rheumatoid arthritis, oedema peripheral, and two events of facial swelling. In the placebo group, the 
treatment related SAEs were polymyalgia rheumatica, hypomagnesaemia, paraesthesia, acute 
myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, organising pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, respiratory 
failure, acute kidney injury, feeling hot, immunisation  anxiety related reaction, procedural 
haemorrhage and facial swelling. The events considered being treatment related are individual cases in 
the placebo and the vaccine group. The clinical information does not allow for a robust conclusion on 
relatedness or possible causality. 
Deaths 
Based on the pharmacovigilance database which includes data from study start  through 3 December 
2020,  there have been 13 deaths during the study.  Six participants who died received mRNA 1273  and 
7 received placebo. The most common preferred term was myocardial infarction, reported by 3 
participants, 2 who received placebo and 1 who received mRNA-1273. The participant who received 
mRNA-1273  had a history of hypercholesterolemia and died 45 days from administration of the study 
product. Another death, due to cardiopulmonary arrest, occurred 21 days after mRNA-1273 dose 1 in a 
patient with  a history of cerebrovascular accident. The other deaths which  were reported in 
participants who received mRNA-1273 included suicide, head trauma due to fall, multisystem organ 
failure, and death due to unknown causes. None of the  deaths were assessed by Investigator or 
Sponsor as related to study product. According to the provided narratives, all subjects of the  mRNA-
1273  group who died during the trial  had a relevant medical history to  explain the event.

2.6.4.  Laboratory findings 
In the non-clinical repeat-dose toxicity studies, haematology changes included increases in white 
blood cells, neutrophils,  and eosinophils and decreased lymphocytes; coagulation changes included 
increases in fibrinogen and activated partial thromboplastin time; and clinical chemistry changes 
included decreases in albumin, increases in globulin,  and a corresponding decrease in albumin/globulin 
ratio. Clinical pathology changes generally reversed or were reversing by the end of the 2-week 
recovery period. 
Clinical safety laboratory evaluations (WBCs, Hgb,  PLTs, ALT, AST, ALP, T. Bili, Cr, and Lipase) 
collected immediately prior to  the first vaccination served as the baseline (Day 1),  and were repeated 
on Days 8, 29 and 36 in  the phase 1 clinical trial. Total blood volume drawn for laboratory and 
immunogenicity assessments until  D29 was 300mL  and until  D57 was a cumulative 476mL. It  should 
be noted that haemoglobin values in the listings  of safety laboratory results in the phase 1  and the 
phase 2  trial were within  the normal range through all study visits and no significant decrease was 
observed.  
With  regard to clinical chemistry, in  people 18-55  YOA (n=4)  and 56-70  YOA (n=1) an increase in liver 
enzymes was observed in a few subjects, while in the latter (n=1)  and >71 YOA group (n=3)  few 
increase of lipase were recorded.  
No specific pattern emerges with regards to the  clinical haematology and chemistry evaluation. 
In the phase 2  clinical trial,  blood draws were scheduled for D0, D29 and D57. Repeat draws were 
done 4 weeks post-dose for each vaccination in Cohort 2 (≥ 55 years of age) only, at which  point in 
time potentially test-related changes were most likely already resolved. 
No safety laboratory tests are foreseen for the pivotal phase 3  study as no specific concerns arose from 
earlier clinical trials, which can be considered acceptable. 
2.6.5.  Safety in special populations 
Pregnant  and lactating women 
In all three clinical studies, pregnant or breastfeeding women were excluded from participation and 
consequently no data are available with  regards to the safety profile in this  subpopulation. Six 
pregnancies were reported in subjects who  received the study vaccine, and all six pregnancies are 
progressing without  complications (Data cut-off: 3 December 2020). 
Elderly subjects (≥65) 
A substantial proportion (n= 7520;  ~25%)  of the  population in pivotal trial P301 was aged 65  or older. 
Approximately 12% (n= 3722)  of the total population  was 65-69  YOA, about 8% (n=2398)  was aged 
70-74,  about 3% (n=975)  was in the age range between 75 and 79 years, and 1.4% or 425 subjects 
was 80 YOA or older. 
Local solicited ARs were more commonly reported by younger adults (≥ 18  to < 65 years; 87.4%  and 
90.5%  after the first  and second injection of mRNA-1273,  respectively) than older adults (≥ 65 years; 
74.6%  and 83.9%  after the first and second injection of mRNA-1273,  respectively). Local solicited AES 
were reported at grade 3 or 4 after the  first injection by 452  (4.0%) younger vs. 77 (2.0%)  older 
subjects, and by 802  (7.3) younger vs. 218 (5.9)  older subjects after the second injection. The median 
duration of local adverse events was 2 days after the first injection and 3 days after the second 
injection in both  age groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 117/169 
 
 
 
 
Systemic solicited ARs were also more commonly reported by younger adults (≥ 18  to < 65 years; 
57.0%  and 81.9%  after the first and second injection of mRNA-1273,  respectively) than older adults 
(≥ 65  years; 48.3% and 71.9% after first and second injection of mRNA-1273,  respectively). Systemic 
solicited AEs were reported at grade 3 or 4 after the first injection by 368 (3.2%)  younger subjects vs. 
84 (2.2%)  older subjects after the first vaccination, and by 1940  (17.7%) younger vs. 399  (10.8%) 
older subjects. For systemic adverse events, the median duration after both the  first and second 
injection was 2 days in both  age cohorts.  
With  regards to unsolicited AES, the rates for all TEAE are comparable for older and younger adults, 
and between placebo and vaccine subjects. For  treatment related TEAE, in both  older and younger 
adults an incidence of ~4%  was observed in placebo recipients vs. an incidence of ~8% in vaccine 
recipients. 
In both younger and older adults, the incidence of hypersensitivity events is driven by injection site 
rash, injection site urticaria and rash. 
In conclusion, the observed safety profile in older adults shows fewer instances of solicited AEs and a 
comparable incidence of unsolicited AEs and does not give rise to concerns. 
Baseline  SARS-CoV-2  Status 
342 baseline seropositive subjects received the first and 230 of these subjects received the second 
vaccination with mRNA-1273  in the solicited safety set.  The incidence and severity of local and 
systemic reactions were comparable to those observed in the baseline negative subjects and no 
concerns arise with  regards to reactogenicity in  baseline seropositive subjects. 
The incidence of unsolicited TEAE is similar for seropositive subjects in  the vaccine and placebo arm 
and comparable to that of seronegative subjects. No specific concerns arise in  the observed safety 
profile so far. 
Immunocompromised Subjects 
179 or 0.6% of the total  population in trial P301  had a stable infection with  HIV at baseline and were 
randomised into the  two arms of the pivotal trial P301. 
The incidence of local and systemic solicited adverse reactions is comparable to that  of the complete 
dataset. 
The incidence of unsolicited TEAE is similar for HIV+ subjects in the vaccine and placebo arm and 
comparable to that  in the total safety population.  
No specific concerns arise in the observed safety profile so far. However, the number of such subjects 
is very small, therefore no definitive conclusions can be drawn. 
Subjects suffering from an Autoimmune Disease  at Baseline 
2455  subjects or 8% of the total population  in trial P301 suffered from an autoimmune disease at 
baseline and were randomised into the two  arms of the pivotal trial P301. 
The incidence of local and systemic solicited adverse reactions is comparable to that  of the complete 
dataset. 
The incidence of unsolicited TEAE is similar for subjects in the vaccine and placebo arm and 
comparable to that  in the total safety population.  
No specific concerns arise in the observed safety profile so far.

2.6.6.  Immunological events 
The formation of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is one of the objectives of vaccination 
with  mRNA-1273, and available data on immunogenicity are discussed in  section 2.4.2  of this report. 
Hypersensitivity  Events 
An SMQ of hypersensitivity revealed a slightly higher incidence of all hypersensitivity events in the 
vaccine group versus the placebo group (1.5% vs. 1.1%,  respectively), which was driven mainly by 
injection site rash (n=37 (0.2%)  vs. n=1 (<0.1%)),  injection site urticaria (n=15  (<0.1%) vs. n=0) 
and rash (n=45  (0.3%)  vs. n=  34 (0.2%)).   
An SMQ of angioedema revealed a balanced incidence of 0.3% in  each study arm. 
Autoimmune diseases 
The frequency of autoimmune related adverse events is comparable, for both arms of trial P301,  with 
28 (0.2%)  of subjects in  the placebo arm and 32 (0.2%)  of subjects in the vaccine arm reporting such 
events. 
A further numerical imbalance is observed for the SOC skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, which 
is mainly driven by hair loss. Based on current knowledge, this is most likely due to  chance. 
2.6.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Study P301 was not intended to  measure drug interactions or the impact of other vaccines being 
administered in  a close temporal relationship to mRNA-1273,  based on exclusion criterion ‘Has 
received or plans to receive a non-study vaccine within  28  days prior to  or after any dose of IP (except 
for seasonal influenza vaccine which  is not permitted within  14 days before or after any dose of IP)’. 
2.6.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the P101 and P201 studies, no subjects terminated study participation due to an AE, while 3 subject 
in phase 2 as well as 3 subjects in phase 1 did not  receive the second vaccination due to an AE.  
Study discontinuation  due to  an AE or SAE were rare in both arms in  the pivotal trial P301, with  rates 
below 0.1% and comparable for both  arms. Numerically, slightly more subjects (n=7)  discontinued due 
to an AE or SAE in the vaccine arm compared to the placebo arm (n=3).  
With  regards to AEs leading to discontinuation  of the vaccine, similar small proportions of subjects in 
the vaccine and placebo arms experienced such an adverse event (0.2% in both  arm). With  regards to 
SAEs leading to discontinuation  of the vaccine, again similar proportions of subjects in the  vaccine and 
placebo arms (<0.1%) were reported, with  a numerically more subjects in the placebo arm (n=15) 
compared to the vaccine arm (n=9). 
Overall, no signals or specific concerns emerge from either study or IP discontinuation  rates. 
2.6.9.  Post-marketing experience 
COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is not yet authorised in any country. An Emergency Use Authorisation  was 
granted in the US by the FDA on 18 December 2020.

2.6.10.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Size of the Safety Database 
The safety of mRNA-1273 has been examined in  a clinical development program comprising 15,420 
subjects exposed to a dose of 100  µg. 35 subjects were enrolled in the phase 1  study P101, 200 were 
enrolled in the  phase 2 study P201 and 15,179  (Safety Dataset, Cut-off 25 November 2020)  were 
enrolled in the  pivotal phase 3 trial P301. 
In the phase 3  trial, slightly more male (52.7%)  than female (47.3%)  subjects were recruited, of 
whom the majority was White  (79.2%),  followed by Black or African American (10.2%)  and Asian 
(4.6%).  24.8% of the recruited subjects were ≥ 65 years of age. Among subjects <65  years of age, 
16.7%  of the  total population had risk factors for severe COVID-19. In the total  study population, 
subjects had the following risk factors: diabetes (9.5%),  severe obesity (6.7%),  significant cardiac 
disease (4.9%),  chronic lung  disease (4.8%), liver disease (0.6%), and HIV infection (0.6%).  The 
majority of subjects were seronegative at baseline for SARS-CoV-19, except for 680  subjects (2.2%) 
with  a positive baseline serostatus (FAS). 
Duration of follow-up 
At the 25 November 2020 data cut, 9406  (61.9%)  subjects in the mRNA-1273 group of the pivotal trial 
were followed for ≥56 days since the second injection.  The median study duration from the  second 
injection was 63.0 days. 
Participants in the clinical trials will  be followed until  24 months after the second dose (P301) or 12 
months after the second dose (P201, P101).  Long-term safety is considered as missing information in 
the RMP so the final clinical study reports are required, and a PASS will  be conducted post-
authorisation.  
Solicited Adverse Events 
Solicited Local Adverse Reactions 
The adverse reactions of injection site pain, erythema, injection site swelling (hardness) and 
lymphadenopathy are typical local reactions that  may occur after vaccinations. These adverse reactions 
were more often reported in the mRNA-1273  group (92.4%)  compared to injection of a saline solution 
(29.3%).   
The reactogenicity in the vaccine group was generally higher after the second injection for all reported 
local reactions. The most common solicited local AR was pain (vaccine: 83.7%  post-dose 1,  88.2% 
post-dose 2; placebo: 17.5%  post-dose 1,  17.0% post-dose 2). The other solicited local ARs were: 
erythema (vaccine: 2.8%  post-dose 1,  8.6% post-dose 2; placebo: 0.4%  after each dose), swelling 
(vaccine: 6.1%  post-dose 1, 12.2%  post-dose 2; placebo: 0.3%  after each dose), and 
lymphadenopathy (vaccine: 10.2%  post-dose 1, 14.2% post-dose 2; placebo: 4.8% post-dose 1, 3.9% 
post-dose 2). 
The majority of solicited local ARs were grade 1 to  grade 2 in severity. Grade 3 events were reported in 
3.5% of the subjects after the first injection, and 7.0% after the second injection. The mean duration 
of solicited local adverse reactions after any injection was 3.4 days (SD 3.08)  in the mRNA-1273  group 
compared to 2.1 days (SD 3.67)  in the placebo group. After any injection, the number of subjects 
reporting solicited local adverse events that  persisted beyond 7 days was 579 (3.8%)  in the mRNA-
1273  group vs. 204 events (1.3%) in  the placebo group. These numbers were mainly driven by 
subjects reporting Lymphadenopathy (301 subjects (2.0%)  in the mRNA-1273  group, 95  subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 120/169 
 
 
 
 
(0.6%)  in the Placebo group) and pain (227 subjects (1.5%) mRNA-1273  group, 103 subjects (0.7%) 
in the placebo group). 
Of note, the event of Lymphadenopathy was defined as local axillary swelling or tenderness ipsilateral 
to the vaccination arm. The mean duration of these axillary swellings after any injection was similar 
between the mRNA-1273  (mean 2.4  (SD 3.21),  median 1.0)  and the placebo group (mean 2.3  days 
(SD 4.23),  median 1.0). The incidence of Grade 3 Lymphadenopathy after the second injection was 
0.5% (67  subjects) in the vaccine group compared to 0.1% (19  subjects) in  the control group. The 
median duration of severe (grade 3) axillary swelling after the second dose was 1.0 days (range 1, 15) 
and 1.0 days (range 1, 6), as reported by participants who received mRNA-1273 or placebo, 
respectively. 
Solicited Systemic Adverse Reactions 
The incidence of solicited systemic adverse reactions was generally higher in the mRNA-1273 group 
and the difference between vaccine and control group was especially increased after the second 
injection (incidence mRNA-1273: 79.4%  vs. Placebo: 36.5%). 
While fever was reported in only 115 (0.8%)  subjects after receiving the first dose of mRNA-1273 
(Placebo: 44 subjects, 0.3%),  this number increased to 2278  (15.5%) subjects (Placebo: 43  subjects, 
0.3%)  after the second dose. The incidence of grade 3 (39°C  – 40°C) or grade 4 (> 40°C)  events 
combined after dose 2  of the  vaccine was 1.4%  (215 subjects), compared to <0.1%  (5 subjects) in the 
placebo group.  
The incidence of nausea/vomiting after dose 1  was relatively similar between mRNA-1273 (8.3%)  and 
placebo (7.1%).  However, after dose 2 the  incidence was nearly 3-fold higher in the vaccine group 
(19.0%)  vs. the  placebo group (6.4%).  
After the first injection, 8.3% of the subjects in the mRNA-1273  group reported chills, compared to 
5.8% in  the placebo group. The prevalence of chills after the  second injection did strongly increase in 
the mRNA-1273  group (44.2%),  while  less events were reported in the placebo group (5.6%).   
The incidence of the other solicited systemic adverse reactions after the second mRNA-1273  injection 
was also high,  with arthralgia reported in 42.8%,  myalgia in  58.0%, headache in 58.6%,  and fatigue in 
65.3%  of the  subjects.  
Severe solicited systemic events (Grade 3) occurred in 2325  subjects (15.8%) after the second 
vaccination with mRNA-1273.  This number was mainly driven by the events of fatigue, myalgia, 
arthralgia and headache.  
The majority of solicited systemic events after the second dose occurred within  the first two  days. The 
mean duration  of solicited systemic events after any injection was 3.5 days (SD 4.98)  in the mRNA-
group, compared to 3.6 days (SD 5.55)  in the placebo group. The median duration was either 1.0 or 
2.0 days for all events, regardless of treatment group. The incidence of solicited systemic events 
persisting beyond 7 days was 9.9%  (1498 subjects) for mRNA-1273 vs. 8.9% (1348  subjects) for 
placebo. 
In summary, there was a pronounced reactogenicity for both  local and systemic adverse reactions, 
particularly after the second vaccination with  mRNA-1273.  However, most of the events were grade 1 
or 2 in severity and resolved within a few days. 
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
The prevalence of all unsolicited AEs up  to 28 Days after any vaccination was comparable between the 
treatment groups (mRNA-1273:  3632 events = 23.9%; Placebo: 3277 events = 21.6%).  Regarding 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 121/169 
 
 
 
 
treatment-related unsolicited AEs, there is a difference between the groups (mRNA-1273: 1242  events 
= 8.2%;  Placebo: 686 events = 4.5%). The applicant states that  the difference appears to result from 
solicited ARs that  were assessed as severe or required medical attention.  However, these events can 
only explain part of the relative and absolute difference between unsolicited  treatment-related events. 
The incidences of severe, serious and medically-attended unsolicited AEs up to 28 days after any 
vaccination (regardless of severity) were similar between vaccine and placebo.  
However, there were some imbalances for certain preferred terms (PT) or system organ classes (SOC): 
Three events of acute peripheral facial paralysis (Bell’s palsy) were reported in the mRNA-group, 
compared to 1 event in the placebo group. While the incidence is relatively low (0.02%),  a possible 
causal relationship to vaccination cannot be excluded, due to a close temporal connection of two 
events after dose 2 and the  fact that this  event was reported at a similar rate during the  clinical trials 
of another mRNA vaccine against COVID-19. Therefore, the event of acute peripheral facial 
paralysis/Bell’s palsy is included in section 4.8 of the SmPC with  a frequency of “rare” and will  be 
followed up as an AESI in the  ongoing phase 3 trial.  
There were more reports of muscle spasms in the vaccine group (33 events, 0.2%) than  in the control 
group (19 events, 0.1%). The number of medically-attended events (vaccine: 13  events, placebo: 9 
events) and events considered as treatment-related by the Investigator (vaccine: 5 events, placebo: 4 
events) were comparable. Therefore, no concern is raised.  
There were also more events of paraesthesia (29  vaccine, 26 placebo, treatment-related: 11  vs. 7), 
hypoaesthesia (12 vaccine, 8 placebo, treatment-related: 4 vs. 0)  and hyperaesthesia (6 vaccine, 0 
placebo, treatment-related: 5 vs. 0) in the  mRNA-1273 group. However, fewer events were reported 
for the PTs of pharyngeal paraesthesia (0 vaccine, 1 placebo), paraesthesia oral (2 vaccine, 4 placebo, 
treatment-related: 0 vs 4) and injection site paraesthesia (2 vaccine, 3 placebo, treatment-related: 1 
vs. 3). The number of medically attended events was in  total smaller in the  vaccine group 
(paraesthesia 6 vs 9,  hypoaesthesia 2 vs. 3, hyperaesthesia 1 vs. 0) and only one subject in the 
placebo group reported serious paraesthesia. While the  overall imbalance for these adverse events is 
noted, the totality  of data does not suggest a safety signal. 
The PT of gastroesophageal reflux disease was reported by 41  subjects (medically attended: 21 
events, treatment-related: 2 events) in the  vaccine group, compared to 18  subjects in  the placebo 
group (medically attended: 9 events, treatment-related: 0 events). Overall, the incidences of events in 
the SOC of gastrointestinal  disorders were similar (478  vs. 440 events) and currently it seems 
biologically not  plausible that  the vaccine would cause reflux. Routine post-marketing 
pharmacovigilance surveillance is considered sufficient. 
There was an imbalance for the events of insomnia (vaccine: 17 events vs placebo: 14  events), 
abnormal dreams (5 vs. 0 events), sleep disorder (5 vs. 0 events), and nightmare (3  vs. 1 event). 
However, most of the reported events had an onset on day 1 or 2 and resolved within a few days. It is 
considered likely that  these events are secondary effects of solicited reactions like fever, myalgia or 
chills. 
There was an imbalance for some events of the SOC of Nervous system disorders: cerebrovascular 
accident (4x vaccine vs. 1x placebo), embolic stroke (2x vaccine, 0x placebo) and transient ischaemic 
attack (2x vaccine vs. 1x placebo). Several of these events were considered as serious (3x 
cerebrovascular accident, 1x transient ischaemic attack, and 2x embolic stroke). For further details 
please see the  paragraph on SAEs below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 122/169 
 
 
 
 
Another imbalance was noted for the SOC of hepatobiliary disorders, with  15 events in  the vaccine 
group, compared to 3 events in  the placebo group. The disparity was mainly caused by the  events of 
cholelithiasis (vaccine: 6 events, placebo 1 event) and cholecystitis (vaccine: 4 events, placebo: none). 
At the present time it appears likely that this  imbalance is caused by chance. 
Serious Adverse Events and Deaths 
Serious Adverse Events 
The incidence as well as the  number of reported serious TEAE were low and similar between both 
groups. However, there were some imbalances for certain preferred terms (PT) or system organ 
classes (SOC) among the number of subjects reporting serious unsolicited  adverse events. 
More serious AEs were reported in the  vaccine group for the SOC of nervous system disorders (16 
events), compared to placebo (10 events). Of the study participants that  received the vaccine, there 
were 3 SAEs of cerebrovascular accident (1x placebo), 2 SAEs of embolic stroke (none in placebo), and 
1 SAE of transient  ischaemic attack (none in  placebo). Of note, there were 2 reports of deep vein 
thrombosis in the mRNA-1273  group (none in the  placebo group). However, none of these events were 
considered as related by the Investigator. The applicant provided detailed background information for 
the events of stroke and transient  ischaemic attack from which  is evident that  all subjects had a 
significant medical history or increased risk for these events. Though no concerns were raised from the 
submitted  clinical information, the  current list  of adverse events of special interest (AESI) in the RMP 
includes the events of stroke and coagulation disorders (including  deep vein thrombosis and 
cerebrovascular accident) because of the numerical imbalance, and will provide post-marketing 
surveillance of these diseases. This approach is endorsed by the CHMP.   
The PT of facial swelling was reported in 2 subjects in the mRNA-1273  group, compared to 1  event in 
the placebo group. Of note, both events in the vaccine group were considered as serious and both 
subjects received dermal filler injection prior to vaccination. Both  events resolved within  a week. These 
events are reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC due a reasonable possibility of causal relationship. 
At the time of the latest  data cut-off  (25 November 2020),  there were single events of anaphylaxis in 
each treatment  group, but  without  a temporal connection to  injection. There have been no other cases 
of severe hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions reported immediately after vaccination in the trial 
to date. However, there was one post-marketing report of anaphylaxis during vaccination campaigns in 
an individual with  a severe shellfish allergy. The applicant provided information about  two further cases 
of possible hypersensitivity. These cases, based on rather limited clinical information, currently do not 
appear to meet Brighton Collaboration Anaphylaxis Case Definition criteria. The two cases have 
entered case processing and efforts will be made to  contact the reporter to obtain  additional 
information. Anaphylaxis must be included as important  identified risk in the  RMP, because of the 
confirmed case mentioned above. The event was included in sections 4.4  and 4.8  of the  SmPC 
(frequency not known). 
Treatment-related SAE 
Until  the data cut-off, there were 7  subjects with  treatment-related SAEs in the  vaccine group, 
compared to 5 subjects in the placebo group. The treatment-related SAEs in the  mRNA group were B-
cell small lymphocytic lymphoma, autonomic system imbalance, dyspnoea, nausea, vomiting, 
rheumatoid arthritis, oedema peripheral, and two events of facial swelling. In the placebo group, the 
treatment related SAEs were polymyalgia rheumatica, hypomagnesaemia, paraesthesia, acute 
myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, organising pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, respiratory 
failure, acute kidney injury, feeling hot, immunisation  anxiety related reaction, procedural 
haemorrhage and facial swelling. It should be noted that  the events considered as being treatment 
Assessment report

related are individual cases in the placebo and the vaccine group. The clinical information does not 
allow for a conclusion on relatedness or possible causality. 
Deaths 
There were 13 patients who died during the Phase 3 trial, with  6 fatalities in the mRNA-1273  group, 
compared to 7 in the  placebo group. None of the  above reported deaths were considered related to 
vaccination. According to the provided narratives, all subjects of the mRNA-1273 group who died 
during the trial had a relevant medical history to  explain the event. 
Safety in special populations 
Pregnant and lactating women 
No conclusive data are available for use of the mRNA-1273  vaccine during pregnancy. This is a missing 
information in the RMP and was reflected in the  SmPC section 4.6. Twelve pregnancies have been 
reported in study P301,  of which  6 in subjects who received the study vaccine and 6  in the placebo. As 
of 11 November 2020,  all 6 pregnancies in the vaccine group were ongoing with  no reported 
complications. In the placebo group, one participant  was lost to follow up and the pregnancy outcome 
is not known. For the 2  pregnancies with known outcome in the placebo group, the  following was 
reported: 
•  One participant experienced a spontaneous abortion at  approximately 7 gestation weeks; 
•  One participant had an elective abortion at approximately 6 gestation weeks. 
Elderly subjects (≥65) 
A substantial proportion (n= 7520;  ~25%)  of the  population in pivotal trial P301 was aged 65  or older: 
Approximately 12% (n= 3722)  of the total population  were 65-69  years old, about  8% (n=2398)  were 
aged 70-74,  about 3%  (n=975) were in the age range between 75 and 79 and 1.4% or 425 subjects 
were 80  or older. 
Trial participants aged 65 or older experienced local and systemic solicited adverse events at a lower 
frequency than their younger counterparts. Similarly, a lower proportion of older subjects experienced 
solicited AEs of grade 3 or 4 than  the adults below 65. The median duration of local adverse events 
was 2 days after the first injection and 3 days after the second injection in  both age groups. For 
systemic adverse events, the  median duration after both the first and second injection was 2  days in 
both age cohorts.  
With  regards to unsolicited AES, the rates for all TEAE are comparable for older and younger adults, 
and between placebo and vaccine subjects. For  treatment related TEAE, in both  older and younger 
adults an incidence of ~4%  was observed in placebo recipients vs. an incidence of ~8% in vaccine 
recipients. 
In both younger and older adults, the incidence of hypersensitivity events is driven by injection site 
rash, injection site urticaria and rash. 
In conclusion, the observed safety profile in older adults shows fewer instances of solicited AEs and a 
comparable incidence of unsolicited AEs and does not give rise to concerns. 
Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Status 
680 participants  were seropositive at baseline and were randomised into  the two  trial arms. 342 
baseline seropositive subjects received the first  and 230  of these subjects received the second 
vaccination in the solicited safety set. The incidence and severity of local and systemic reactions were 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 124/169 
 
 
 
 
comparable to those observed in the baseline negative subjects and no concerns arise with  regards to 
reactogenicity in baseline seropositive subjects. 
The incidence of unsolicited TEAE is similar for seropositive subjects in  the vaccine and placebo arm 
and comparable to that of seronegative subjects. No specific concerns arise in  the observed safety 
profile so far. 
Immunocompromised Subjects 
179 or 0.6% of the total  population in trial P301  had a stable infection with  HIV at baseline and were 
randomised into the  two arms of the pivotal trial P301.  The incidence of local and systemic solicited 
adverse reactions is comparable to the total safety population, and the frequency of unsolicited TEAE is 
similar for HIV+ subjects in the vaccine and placebo arm and comparable to that  in the  total safety 
population. No  specific concerns arise in the  observed safety profile so far. However, the  number of 
such subjects is very small, therefore no definitive conclusions can be drawn. 
Subjects Suffering from an Autoimmune Disease at Baseline 
2455  subjects or 8% of the total population  in trial P301 suffered from an autoimmune disease at 
baseline and were randomised into the two  arms of the pivotal trial P301. The incidence of local and 
systemic solicited adverse reactions in these subjects is comparable to that of the total  safety 
population. The incidence of unsolicited TEAE is similar for subjects in the vaccine and placebo arm and 
comparable to that  in the total safety population. No specific concerns arise in the observed safety 
profile at  this point in  time. 
Immunological Events 
Subjects with a known or suspected allergy or history of anaphylaxis, urticaria, or other significant 
adverse reaction to the vaccine or its excipients were excluded from the pivotal trial, while subjects 
with  a history of allergy or anaphylaxis against other substances were not  excluded from participation.  
A slightly higher incidence of all hypersensitivity events was reported in the vaccine group versus the 
placebo group (1.5% vs. 1.1%,  respectively), which was driven mainly by injection site rash (n=37 
(0.2%)  vs. n=1  (<0.1%)),  injection site urticaria (n=15 (<0.1%)  vs. n=0) and rash (n=45 (0.3%)  vs. 
n= 34  (0.2%)). These events were added to section 4.8 of the SmPC, because a causal relationship 
with  vaccination can be considered as very likely.  
The frequency of autoimmune related adverse events is comparable, for both arms of trial P301,  with 
28 (0.2%)  of subjects in  the placebo arm and 32 (0.2%)  of subjects in the vaccine arm reporting such 
events. 
A further numerical imbalance is observed for the SOC skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, which 
is mainly driven by hair loss. It is concluded that,  at the  present level of information, this  is most likely 
due to chance. 
Concomitant Administration of Other Vaccines 
No specific interaction studies with  other vaccines have been performed and due to  the exclusion 
criteria in  the mRNA-1273 clinical program no experience exists with  vaccines within  28 days prior to 
the first dose or any dose of mRNA-1273 except for seasonal influenza vaccine <14 days. A non-
interventional study is planned in the RMP which will  inform on the  concomitant administration with 
non COVID vaccines e.g. seasonal flu. 
Vaccine-Enhanced Disease (VAED) 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 125/169 
 
 
 
 
The potential risk of VAED was assessed in non-clinical animal models in mice and non-human 
primates and raised no concerns based on a Th1  skewed type of immune response (see section 2.3). 
In the pivotal trial, up to the  data cut-off,  30 cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the placebo 
group, while 0 case was reported in the  vaccine group, providing no signal for a possible disease 
enhancement after vaccination with mRNA-1273.   
Generally, it cannot be foreseen whether potential future mutations  of the  SARS-CoV-2 virus may lead 
to a reduced susceptibility to  the neutralising antibodies induced by vaccination with  mRNA-1273. 
Therefore, even though the  currently available data (non-clinical, clinical, neutralising capacity of 
antibodies) do not raise a concern at the  time being, the possibility of enhanced disease cannot be 
excluded with  certainty. The current version of the RMP lists  vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory 
disease as a safety concern and an important  potential risk. The applicant will  report any COVID 19 
cases requiring hospitalisation and provide monthly safety updates including  numbers of and 
information about relevant cases. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The final clinical study report for study mRNA-1273-P301  will be submitted no later than December 
2022  and is subject to a specific obligation  laid down in the MA, in order to  allow a comprehensive 
safety assessment on long-term data and more data in specific subpopulations, e.g. elderly.  
2.6.11.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety evaluation of mRNA-1273  is based mainly on the ongoing Phase 3 study P301. At the  latest 
data cut-off (25 November 2020), 30,351  subjects were enrolled (vaccine = 15,185,  placebo 
=15,166),  of whom 14,715  subjects in  the vaccine arm and 14,613  subjects in the placebo arm have 
received the second dose of the respective treatment. The median study follow-up after the second 
injection was 63.0 days. 
There was pronounced reactogenicity observed for both local and systemic adverse reactions, 
particularly after the second vaccination with  mRNA-1273.  However, most of the events were grade 1 
or 2 in severity and resolved within a few days (median 1-3 days).  
The incidences of severe, serious and medically-attended unsolicited AEs were similar between vaccine 
and placebo recipients. However, there were some imbalances for events such as facial swelling, acute 
peripheral facial paralysis, or certain hypersensitivity events (injection  site urticaria, rash).  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics appropriately. 
In conclusion, the observed safety profile is considered favourable. Longer term safety data is awaited 
from the  ongoing clinical trials. 
There are very limited  data on the  use of the vaccine in immunocompromised individuals and on use in 
pregnancy and breastfeeding. No data was generated with  mRNA-1273 when  administered 
concomitantly with  other vaccines. 
The CHMP considers the  following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional  MA: 
• 
The final clinical study report will  be submitted  no later than  December 2022 and is subject to 
a specific obligation laid down in the  MA. This will provide long-term data.

limited please refer to  section 2.7.   
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
Safety specification 
Summary  of safety  concerns 
The applicant has submitted  an RMP including the  following summary of safety concerns: 
Important identified risks 
Anaphylaxis  
Important potential risks 
Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) including vaccine-
associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) 
Missing information 
Use in pregnancy and while breast-feeding  
Long-term safety 
Use in immunocompromised subjects 
Interaction with  other vaccines 
Use in frail subjects with  unstable health conditions and co-
morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) 
Use in subjects with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders 
Risks considered important for inclusion of the summary of safety concerns 
The review of available safety data, including post-marketing data emerging from use in the  US, the 
experience with biological products and other vaccines leads to  the conclusion that anaphylaxis is an 
important identified  risk for COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. This safety concern will be followed up via 
routine pharmacovigilance activities and in the  planned and ongoing safety studies and reported in the 
monthly summary safety reports and PSURs.  
Any important  potential risks that  may be specific to  vaccination for COVID-19 (e.g. vaccine-associated 
enhanced disease including  vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease) should be taken into 
account. The applicant has included VAED/VAERD as an important potential  risk and will further 
investigate it in the  ongoing pivotal study and post-authorisation  safety studies. 
Missing information  
Since pregnant and breast-feeding women were excluded from the study, no information is available 
for those populations.  It is agreed to include use in  pregnancy and while  breast-feeding as missing 
information in the RMP and collect information via the  EU safety study and the Pregnancy Outcome 
Study. 
At the data cut-off of 21 December 2020, 9  weeks safety data are available (median study follow-up 
after the second injection). Thus, long-term safety is included as missing information and will be 
characterised as part of the continuation  of the pivotal clinical trial and the phase 1 trial and the PASS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 127/169 
 
 
 
 
 
Interaction with  other vaccines has not been evaluated in clinical trials and may be of interest to 
prescribers. As elderly individuals will be one target group for vaccination, and they often may need 
vaccination with other vaccines such as influenza vaccines, further data is requested. The applicant 
commits to study concomitant use with  other vaccines as part of the EU PASS study and the 
effectiveness study. 
in frail subjects with  unstable health conditions  and co-morbidities is limited, and it  is desirable to 
gather further data in these groups. Therefore, use in  frail subjects with  unstable health conditions and 
co-morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological 
disease, cardiovascular disorders) has been included as missing information in the RMP. Furthermore, 
information is limited on the use in subjects with  autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, as well as in 
immunocompromised subjects. Therefore, these groups are also included as missing information. Such 
missing information will be collected in  the post-authorisation safety and effectiveness studies included 
in the pharmacovigilance plan. 
Risks not  considered important for inclusion in  the summary of safety concerns  
The reactogenicity is in line with  what can be expected from a vaccine. Additionally, no adverse 
reactions were reported in clinical trials due to aspects related to the pharmaceutical formulation. The 
mRNA degradation products are not  expected to represent functionally active mRNA molecules and 
they are naturally metabolised and are considered pharmacologically inactive. It  is therefore 
considered acceptable to not  include those events in the list  of safety specifications. 
Pharmacovigilance plan 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities  
Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond the receipt and review and submission of ADRs include: 
•  Signal detection activities for the lifecycle of vaccines consist of individual AE assessment at 
case receipt, regular aggregate review of cases for trends and statistically  disproportionately 
reported product-adverse event pairs. The MAH will  perform ongoing monitoring of individual 
cases of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction, safety concerns, and Adverse Events 
of Special Interest and weekly aggregated review of AE cases for trend analyses. This will be 
complemented by review of disproportionate reporting of preferred terms during a time 
interval as compared to all data prior to the period. The MAH  will perform biweekly review of 
reports in  the EudraVigilance data analysis system using  available reports and review of data 
from US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System together with  the generation of 
disproportionality scores using Empirical Bayesian Geometrical Mean and its 90% confidence 
intervals. 
•  Routine signal detection activities for COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna will  include routine and 
specific review of AEs consistent with the AESI list provided in the RMP. 
• 
• 
In addition, observed versus expected  analyses  will be conducted as appropriate as part of 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
In addition, published literature  will be reviewed weekly for individual case reports and 
broader signal detection purposes. 
•  Ongoing review of data  for the product and similar products published on the  Safety 
Web  Portals of selected major regulatory agencies  to detect and further investigate 
potential signals being raised in other areas outside the EU. 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 128/169 
 
 
 
 
•  Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires intended to capture clinical details about 
the nature and severity of COVID-19 illness or in relation to potential  cases of vaccine lack of 
effect or VAED and/or AESI associated with  COVID-19 disease, and to gather detailed 
information on cases of anaphylaxis. 
• 
In addition to routine 6-monthly  PSUR submission, monthly summary safety reports will  be 
compiled and submitted  to EMA, to  support timely and continuous  benefit risk evaluations 
during the pandemic. Minimum  data to  be submitted  include:  
o 
o 
Interval and cumulative number of reports, stratified by report type (medically 
confirmed/not) and by seriousness (including  fatal separately) 
Interval and cumulative number of reports, overall and by age groups and in special 
populations (e.g., pregnant women) 
Interval and cumulative number of reports per HLT  and SOC 
o 
o  Summary of the designated medical events 
o  Reports per EU country 
o  Exposure data (lot distribution  data total  and per country) 
o  Changes to  reference safety information in the interval, and current CCDS 
o  Ongoing and closed signals in the interval 
o  AESI and RMP safety concerns: reports - numbers and relevant cases, including O/E 
analyses 
o  Fatal reports -numbers and relevant cases, including O/E analyses 
o  Risk/benefit considerations 
The need and frequency of submission of the summary safety reports will  be re-evaluated 
based on the available evidence from post-marketing after 6 months (6 submissions).  
The proposed routine pharmacovigilance activities are considered appropriate for the safety 
profile of the product and the pandemic circumstances. 
• 
• 
Traceability  
Full  traceability is crucial for pharmacovigilance purposes should assessment of a safety signal need to 
be performed by batch/lot.   
The applicant’s proposal to ensure traceability include: 
•  SmPC instructions  for healthcare professionals to record the name and batch number of the 
administered vaccine to  improve traceability 
• 
• 
• 
vaccine carton labelling containing a scannable 2D barcode that provides the batch/lot 
number and expiry date 
additional tools for vaccinators to record manufacturer and lot/batch  information at  the time of 
vaccination including a Traceability and Vaccination Reminder Card provided printed to 
vaccinators (as well as available electronically), and peel-off labels (stickers with  brand name 
and lot/batch numbers as well as a scannable 2D code with  this information),  acknowledging 
that  each Member State will decided if and how the  tools will be used, in  accordance with the 
national provisions for pharmacovigilance. 
Each shipment to a vaccination site  should be accompanied with  a sufficient number of corresponding 
vaccinee traceability and vaccination reminder cards; the lot/batch  numbers will  be for the first batches 
distributed  copied manually by the vaccinators, with  the applicant’s commitment  that by 28 February 
2021  all batches shipped will be accompanied at the receipt point in the  Member States by sufficient 
peel-off labels to facilitate the recording of brand name and lot/batch  number both  in the vaccinators’ 
records and the vaccinee traceability and vaccination reminder cards, where the  Member States will 
require it. 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 129/169 
 
 
 
 
The Traceability and Vaccination Reminder will  include: 
• 
Placeholder space for name of vaccinee; 
•  Vaccine brand name and MAH  name; 
• 
Placeholder space for due date and actual date of first  and second doses, and associated 
batch/lot  number; 
•  Reminder to retain the card and bring to the appointment for the second dose of the vaccine; 
•  QR code that  links to  a website with  additional information on product use; and 
•  Adverse event reporting information. 
Additional pharmacovigilance activities 
The applicant proposed eight studies to identify and characterise the risks of the product – six in the 
US, one in the EU and one in the EU, US and Canada. Four  studies are interventional, including the 
three ongoing clinical trials and a study in immunocompromised subjects and four studies are non-
interventional by design, including  3 for safety and 1 on effectiveness.

US non-interventional active safety surveillance study for individuals who receive the Moderna 
mRNA-1273  SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine. The study will use secondary medical and pharmacy claims 
data from individuals insured under providers participating in several large US medical and 
pharmacy insurance claims submission systems. The three core objectives are: estimation of 
background rates for AESI prior to and during the pandemic, assessment of observed versus 
expected rates, and estimation  of the  relative risk for specific AESIs continuing  to meet pre-
specified evaluation threshold. The proposed milestones include interim reporting every three 
months. The final evaluation of the proposed studies will  take place in a separate procedure 
once study  protocols are submitted  for review. 
•  Post-Authorization Active Surveillance Safety  Study  Using Secondary Data  to Monitor 
Real-World  Safety  of the mRNA-1273  Vaccine in the EU 
A Post-Authorisation Active Surveillance Safety Study Using Secondary Data to Monitor  Real- 
World Safety of the COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna in the EU.  Secondary database analysis of 
observational data to estimate incidence rates of safety events of interest and other clinically 
significant events in cohorts of COVID-19 vaccine recipients in the  EU. 
•  Moderna  mRNA-1273 Observational  pregnancy outcome study 
The use of mRNA vaccine in pregnant women is considered Missing Information in the RMP. 
The study will evaluate pregnancy outcomes among women exposed to mRNA-1273  vaccine 
during pregnancy. This is a prospective observational study and will  evaluate pregnancy and 
birth outcomes among women exposed to mRNA-1273  vaccine during pregnancy based on 
data from US, Canada and EU.  Pregnant women will  be recruited from the general population 
and followed from enrolment until the  end of pregnancy (live birth, stillbirth,  termination  of 
pregnancy, or spontaneous abortion); live-born infants will be followed from birth  until 1 year 
of age. Data from EU  countries will  be included in  the study.  
•  Real-world study to evaluate  mRNA-1273 effectiveness and  long-term effectiveness 
in the U.S. will  evaluate mRNA-1273 effectiveness and long- term effectiveness. Primary 
objectives of the study are to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 doses of COVID-19 Vaccine 
Moderna in preventing COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 disease. Secondary objectives include 
effectiveness estimates stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbid conditions, and 
concomitant receipt of another adult  vaccine. Durability of one or two  doses of Moderna’s 
COVID-19 vaccine against COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 disease will also be assessed.

The primary objectives of study P301  are to demonstrate the efficacy of mRNA-1273  to 
prevent COVID-19 and to  evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of 2 injections of mRNA-1273 
given 28 days apart. The study has secondary and exploratory objectives. 
•  A planned interventional study ‘Safety  and  Immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 SARSCoV-2 
Vaccine  in Immunocompromised Adults Aged 18 Years and Older’ in  order to study the 
safety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine in immunocompromised 
adults. 
Overall conclusions on the Pharmacovigilance Plan  
The proposed post-authorisation pharmacovigilance development plan is sufficient to identify and 
characterise the risks of the product.  
Routine pharmacovigilance remains sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation 
measures.  
Plans for post-authorisation efficacy studies  
None proposed. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine Risk Minimisation Measures  
Potential  Medication Errors 
The applicant included a discussion on potential medication errors which is endorsed: 
Large scale mass vaccination may potentially introduce the risk of medication errors related to storage, 
handling, dosing, and administration errors associated with  a multi-dose vial, and confusion with  other 
COVID-19 vaccines. These potential  medication errors are mitigated through the  information in  the 
SmPC, including  instructions in  SmPC (section 6.6) contains instructions  for preparation and 
administration, vaccination scheme, and storage conditions of the vaccine. Additionally, a Traceability 
and Vaccination Reminder card will be provided with  the pre-printed MAH name and fields for entry of 
dates of vaccination, batch/lot  as a mitigation  effort for potential confusion between vaccines, as well 
as peel-off labels with  lot/batch  number to  document the doses administered.  
These available resources will inform healthcare providers on the proper preparation and 
administration of the vaccine and reduce the potential  for medication errors in the context of a mass 
vaccination campaign. Additionally, the patient  information leaflet and, in those member states where 
applicable, a Traceability and Vaccination Reminder card informs patients of the vaccine received so 
that  a series is completed with  the same product.

Summary of additional risk minimisation measures  
None proposed.  
The applicant stated that  Routine risk minimisation activities are sufficient  to manage the safety 
concerns of the medicinal product. This is acceptable. 
Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures  
The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to  minimise the  risks of the product in the 
proposed indication. 
Summary of the risk management plan  
The public summary of the RMP is acceptable.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that  the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the  Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. Furthermore, during the  duration of the  COVID-19 
pandemic situation,  the MAH  shall submit summary safety reports submitted  to EMA, including 
spontaneously reported data and data from compassionate use and expanded access programs. The 
applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with  the international  birth date (IBD). The IBD is 
18.12.2020.  The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to  determine the forthcoming Data 
Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that CX-024414  (Single-stranded, 5’-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced 
using a cell-free in vitro transcription from the  corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike 
(S) protein of SARS-CoV-2) has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the European 
Union. 
CX-024414  is the  mRNA that  encodes for the pre-fusion stabilised Spike protein of 2019-novel 
Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The full-length  SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is modified with  2 proline 
substitutions  (K986P and V987P) within  the heptad repeat 1 domain (S 2P) to stabilise the  S protein 
into the  pre-fusion conformation. All uridines in  the mRNA are replaced by 1-methylpseudouridine. A 
highly similar chemical active substance encoding for the  same vaccination antigen was previously 
authorised in a medicinal product for human use in the European Union.  Although, CX-024414  as 
active substance exposes patients to the same vaccination antigen as the already authorised active 
substance in the European Union,  the respective mRNAs of both  vaccines are not identical. Structural 
elements of the mRNA, including  the sequence control elements and codon usage of the open reading 
frame of the vaccination antigen are different. This can lead to an increased mRNA stability and to an 
improved translation efficacy.  
In conclusion, the active substance CX-024414  provides a unique sequence in the  UTRs that  can 
influence the stability and translational behaviour of the active substance. These sequences are not 
present in any authorised medicinal product in the EU. Therefore, the new active substance claim is 
supported. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers CX-024414 (Single-stranded, 5’-capped messenger 
RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell-free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, 
encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2) to be a new active substance as it  is not  a 
constituent  of a medicinal product previously authorised within  the  Union.

2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with  target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable, given the current urgent 
public health need for rapid development and approval of vaccines to prevent the global burden of 
disease associated with  SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease, and because the  product will 
always be administered by a healthcare professional. 
The applicant is expected to thoroughly review and update the package leaflet in  the light of the 
results from the  user testing,  especially as regards the section ‘Information about storage and 
handling’.  
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions 
The following exemptions from labelling and serialisation requirements have been granted on the  basis 
of article 63.3  of Directive 2001/83/EC.  In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the 
context of the flexibilities described in the Questions and Answers on labelling flexibilities for COVID-19 
vaccines (EMA/689080/2020  rev.1, from 16 December 2020) 3 document which aims at facilitating the 
preparedness work of COVID-19 vaccine developers and the associated logistics of early printing 
packaging activities. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the large scale and rapid deployment of COVID-
19 vaccines for EU citizens within  the existing legal framework. 
EU packaging specific derogations 
a. From start of supply to  beginning of February ’21 the following  exemptions are agreed for the outer 
and immediate labelling: 
Outer carton 
(Invented) name: ‘Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine’ 
o 
o  Pharmaceutical form: ‘suspension for injection’ instead of ‘dispersion for injection’; 
o 
o 
o 
common name: covid-19 mRNA vaccine 
Inclusion of non-standard pictograms. 
Inclusion of a strength  (0.20 mg/ml); 
Immediate label (vial) 
(Invented) name: ‘Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine’; 
o 
o  Pharmaceutical form: ‘suspension for injection’ instead of ‘dispersion for injection’ 
o 
common name: covid-19 mRNA vaccine 
b. From beginning of February ’21  until end of March ’21 the following  has been agreed with respect to 
the (invented) name: 
It has been allowed to deviate from the (invented) name containing the BWP approved common name 
(for the Product Information (PI) Annexes/Opinion documents) by omitting  the  ‘mRNA’ and 
‘(nucleoside modified)’ parts, i.e. COVID-19  mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) Moderna.  This 
derogation is valid until  a proper invented name is granted or until  a WHO INN  is approved and used

for an INN+MAH  name. This will  result in the following text for the PI annexes/Opinion documentation: 
 (Invented) name: COVID-19  Vaccine Moderna 
Common name: COVID-19  mRNA Vaccine  (nucleoside modified) 
The above decision is justified on the grounds of clarity and consistency between the  printed materials 
produced for the batches released from February to March ‘21  and PI annexes/Opinion documents plus 
company website (QR code content).  It will also minimise confusion amongst vaccine users and reduce 
the number of changes needed post-marketing. Moderna shall continue  working closely with  EMA to 
define an appropriate strategy to switch  to a proper invented name or INN + MAH  name within  the 
above-mentioned period and possibly even from the beginning  of February ’21. 
c. Outer and immediate labelling will  be provided in English  only for all EU Member States, as well as 
Norway and Iceland. Country/language specific outer/immediate labelling will  be developed late 2021 
with  implementation starting Q2 2022. 
Production of different vaccine packs in  different languages will significantly reduce the supply chain 
efficiency. The multiple changes on packaging lines will  result in significant time and capacity losses 
and would slow down the rapid deployment of COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, English only labelling will 
better help to manage a shortage situation in one country by using  immediately the supply from 
another country.  
d. From the beginning of supply and until  March 2021 no printed package leaflet (PL)  in the national 
language(s) will be supplied to EU MSs, including  Norway and Iceland. During this  time access to the 
national version of the PL will  be ensured via a QR code printed on the outer and immediate labels. 
MAH  shall supply as of March 2021  printed PLs in the national language(s) of all MSs, including Norway 
and Iceland. Moreover, a reduced number of 5 printed PLs per 1,200 doses will be provided. A QR code 
will be printed on the PL and on the Patient  Reminder Card to ensure in parallel access to the national 
versions of the PL. 
e. The Blue Box will  be omitted  for the initial  batches. The MAH shall provide the Blue Box via a QR 
code at a later stage following agreement on exact timing  of implementation with  the National 
Competent Authorities in each MS. 
f. The inclusion of the EU Marketing Authorisation number in the labelling will  be implemented with  the 
switch  to EU compliant packs in Q2 2022,  as the labels used until  the end of 2021  are covering regions 
other than EU. 
Exemption from the obligation of serialisation 
- All EU Member States have accepted a temporary derogation from serialisation for the EU pack from 
beginning of supply until the  end of March 2021. 
- The MAH shall provide two  progress reports on the serialisation: a first by 1st of February ‘21 and a 
second by 1st of March ‘21 referring to  details on the  progress achieved in terms of ensuring 
compliance, e.g. the proof of contract  to connect to the European Medicines Verification Organisation. 
- The MAH shall provide additional mitigating  measures, e.g. immediate reporting of any stolen product 
during the period of exemption, reporting of any counterfeit or falsified vaccine in the EU  or third 
countries in the legal supply or internet, reconciliation of product distributed and used in the respective 
territory.

2.10.3.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling and the package leaflet for the  purpose of providing 
information to Healthcare Professionals and vaccine recipients has been submitted by the applicant and 
has been found acceptable. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code: 
• 
• 
The Summary of Product Characteristics 
The Package Leaflet 
•  Storage & Handling  guide 
•  Reminder card 
•

2.10.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004,  COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna (COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside-modified), CX-024414  (Single-stranded, 5’-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) 
produced using a cell-free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the 
viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2)) is included in the additional monitoring  list as it contains a new 
active substance which,  on 1  January 2011,  was not  contained in any medicinal product authorised in 
the EU  and it  is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that  this will  allow quick identification  of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is the prevention of COVID-19 in  adults. COVID-
19 is the disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
COVID-19 is primarily recognised as febrile respiratory illness. While the majority of cases subsides 
without  specific treatment in a subgroup of patients  the disease progresses to severe disease 
characterised by oxygen requirement. Still fewer patients  progress to critical disease with respiratory 
failure, ARDS, multiorgan failure and/or thromboembolic complications. Age is the major risk factor for 
severe COVID-19 and death; other described risk factors are adiposity, pre-existent diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, lung disease, immuno-deficiency and pregnancy. COVID-19 can be considered 
confirmed by the existence of the above clinical signs and proof of the presence of the  virus by RT-
PCR. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Only a couple of medicinal products have received marketing authorisation for the treatment  of COVID-
19. These encompass antiviral therapy (remdesivir) and anti-inflammatory therapy (dexamethasone). 
A number of products are in clinical development, either antivirals such as monoclonal antibodies 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 144/169 
 
 
 
 
directed to spike protein, convalescent plasma/hyperimmune immunoglobulins or anti-inflammatory 
medicinal products. Other widely used treatments of hospitalised patients  include anticoagulants. 
These therapies have shown variable efficacy depending on the severity and duration of illness. 
While care for individuals with COVID-19 has improved with  clinical experience gained over time, there 
remains an urgent and unmet need for vaccines able to prevent or mitigate COVID-19 during  the 
ongoing pandemic. Especially protection of vulnerable groups and mitigating  the effects of the 
pandemic on a population level are desired. Although a first vaccine for prevention of COVID-19 was 
approved recently (Comirnaty), there is still  an important need for additional vaccines to meet global 
demand or specific subpopulations.   
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Three studies were conducted with mRNA-1273,  of which two dose finding immunogenicity and safety 
phase 1  and phase 2a studies and one large phase 3 efficacy and safety trial, which is the  pivotal study 
for this application.  
Phase 3 Study mRNA-1273-P301  is a pivotal randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified, 
efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety study in adults  ≥ 18 years of age, being conducted in 99 sites 
across the United  States. The overall study duration will  be approximately 26 months  for each 
participant. The participant's final scheduled visit will be on Day 759.  
In this trial, 30,420  subjects were randomised 1:1  to receive either 100μg  of mRNA-1273 vaccine 
(n=15,210)  or placebo (n=15,210)  on Day 1  and on Day 29  (cut-off date for this  application was 25 
November 2020).  Randomisation was stratified by age and health risk into one of three strata, i.e. ≥65 
years of age or 18  to <65 years of age with  or without  the presence of risk factors for severe COVID-
19 based on CDC recommendation as of March 2020.  The trial design has been revised recently after 
EUA in the US, unblinding  participants to offer vaccination with  mRNA-1273  within  the trial (for 
participants who had received placebo). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The main favourable effect is the ability to prevent COVID-19. The primary endpoint in the pivotal trial 
is vaccine efficacy (VE) defined as 1- HR (vaccine vs. placebo) with  cases counted 14 days after the 
second dose of the  vaccine. A dosing window  of –7  to +14 days was allowed for inclusion in the PPS, 
therefore subjects included in the primary efficacy analysis had an interval between doses ranging 
from 3  to 6 weeks. COVID-19 cases were confirmed by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain 
Reaction (RT PCR) and by a Clinical Adjudication Committee. Vaccine efficacy (final analysis, 196 cases 
overall, per protocol set) to prevent COVID-19 in subjects aged 18 years and older, with  or without 
underlying chronic disease and without  prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, was 94.1% (95%  CI 
89.3%,  96.8%).   
From the experience with other vaccines it is expected that  prevention of severe COVID-19 will be 
achieved by preventing COVID-19 overall. Currently no adjudicated severe COVID-19 cases were found 
in the vaccine group while 30  cases were found in the placebo group resulting in a VE of 100% (95%CI 
87.0%,  NE). Of the 30  participants with  severe disease, 9 were hospitalised, of which 2  were admitted 
to an intensive care unit,  one of which died. The majority of the remaining severe cases fulfilled only 
the SpO2 criterion for severe disease.  
Vaccine efficacy was very similar irrespective of whether individuals with  prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection were included in  analysis or not.  Efficacy regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 145/169 
 
 
 
 
(determined by baseline serology and NP swab sample testing)  from 14  days after Dose 2 was 93.6% 
(95% CI 88.5%,  96.4%.  
In addition, all subgroup analyses based on age, ethnicity,  race and comorbidities gave consistent 
estimates for vaccine efficacy. Specifically, efficacy against confirmed COVID-19 regardless of severity 
starting 14  days after the 2nd dose in the Per-Protocol Set was 95.6%  (95% CI 90.6%,  97.9%) in 
individuals aged 18  to <65 YOA and 86.4%  (95%  CI 61.4%,  95.2%)  in individuals aged 65 years and 
older. Individuals having a higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease due to  comorbidities were allowed 
to participate. Overall, 2775  (18.3%)  subjects in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group had a higher risk for 
severe COVID-19, of them  624 subjects (4.1%) had 2 or more risk factors. This included: chronic lung 
disease, significant cardiac disease, severe obesity (body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m2), diabetes (Type 1, 
Type 2 or gestational), and liver disease. It should be noted, that  the individuals must have been in a 
stable health condition. In subjects with  comorbidities, efficacy against COVID-19 14 days after dose 2 
(primary efficacy analysis in the PPS) was: 
−  90.9%  (95% CI 74.7%, 96.7%;  4 cases vs. 43 cases in vaccine vs. placebo group) in 
individuals at high risk (N=~3200  each arm), defined as subjects at increased risk of severe 
COVID-19 due to at least one pre-existing medical condition (chronic lung disease, significant 
cardiac disease, severe obesity, diabetes, liver disease or HIV infection),  regardless of age;  
−  94.4%  (95% CI 76.9%, 98.7%;  2 cases vs. 35 cases in vaccine vs. placebo group) in 
individuals at high risk aged 18 to  <65 years (N=~2100  each arm, same definition  as above). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Data on vaccine efficacy is available for approximately 9 weeks starting  14 days after dose 2.  Data on 
long-term protection are expected, however the  extent and quality  of data that  can be anticipated from 
the ongoing phase 3 study is uncertain because participants in the placebo arm will be offered 
vaccination under the FDA EUA hence the study will be unblinded. Alternative plans to determine 
duration of protection should be discussed post-authorisation. 
The efficacy was demonstrated in a general population aged 18  years and older. Case numbers in  the 
very old patient population (i.e. 75  and older) at highest risk of severe COVID-19 are limited. Only 
~1300  subjects across study arms were aged 75 years and older.  
No data are available on certain populations such as patients  under immune suppressive therapy and 
immune deficient patients. Data are also lacking from pregnant and breast-feeding women.  
The definition of severe COVID-19 (as per protocol) follows a list of clinical categories (e.g. low oxygen 
saturation, transfer to ICU) with  pronounced difference in severity, and of which  at least one category 
needs to  be fulfilled. This complicates interpretation of efficacy estimates for severe disease prevention 
and the most frequent component driving severe case counts appears to be SPO2 below 93%. One 
currently unadjudicated severe case was reported as SAE in vaccine group.  
The case-driven readout and high VE translates into limited case numbers at present and resulting 
limited precision for estimating  VE in several substrata including elderly, people with  comorbidities and 
efficacy against severe COVID-19. 
Protection against asymptomatic infection is currently unknown, however data will be generated during 
the ongoing phase 3 trial on antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein. In addition, the pivotal study 
was not designed to assess the effect of the vaccine against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from 
individuals experiencing asymptomatic infections after vaccination. The efficacy of the vaccine in 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 146/169 
 
 
 
 
preventing SARS-CoV-2 shedding and transmission, in particular from individuals with  asymptomatic 
infection, can only be evaluated post-authorisation  in epidemiological or specific clinical studies  
The extent of cross-neutralisation of circulating and newly emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 is not 
known, however more data will  be generated post-authorisation  with  sera from the ongoing trials. 
There seems to be at least a partial onset of protection after the first dose, but this  remains 
unconfirmed at  this stage.  
Available data do not  suffice to  establish efficacy in subjects seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, 
and subjects with a known history of COVID-19. However, efficacy is anticipated in this  group, to  the 
extent that  they are not naturally protected against re-infection, which  is presently incompletely 
characterised. 
The process from incident COVID-19 symptom occurrence during study to final decision as to whether 
or not a ‘case’ was declared (and considered for primary efficacy analyses) leaves some uncertainty for 
the final VE estimate.  
The data from the phase 3 study currently presented as basis of the conditional MA are based on data 
snapshots from an ongoing study rather than on database locks with  fully monitored, cleaned and 
adjudicated data. Due to the speed of events not all COVID-19 cases reported could be adjudicated so 
far. While adjudication of events starting 14 days after the second dose were prioritised even for the 
primary endpoint not  all potential  events could be adjudicated at  the time of the data cut-off leading to 
potentially lower numbers of cases in this  endpoint.  
Concomitant administration with  other vaccines was not studied and will  be investigated post-
authorisation by means of a PASS and an effectiveness study.  
The timing and number of interim analyses was modified very late in the study and strong overrunning 
was observed. While it  seems very unlikely, potentially data driven choices cannot be excluded. Given 
the large treatment effect a potential impact  was considered negligible. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the phase 3  trial, the analysis of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions was performed within 
the Solicited Safety Set that  consisted of randomised participants who received at least one injection of 
the vaccine and contributed to  any solicited adverse reaction data. The solicited safety set overall 
included 15,179  subjects in  the mRNA-1273 vaccine group and 15,163  subjects in  the saline placebo 
group. Of the 15,179  subjects in the  solicited safety set of the vaccine group, 15,168 subjects received 
1 dose and 14,677  received 2 doses. In the placebo group, the numbers were 15,155  and 14,566  (as 
of 25 November 2020).  At the 25 November 2020  data cut, 9,406  (61.9%)  subjects in  the mRNA-1273 
group of the  pivotal trial  were followed for ≥56  days since the  second injection. The median study 
duration from the second injection was 63.0 days. 
Solicited local and systemic reactions were reported at a higher incidence in the mRNA-1273  group 
than in  the placebo group after each injection. Any solicited local injection site reaction of any grade 
after any dose was reported by 29.3%  of subjects in the placebo group and by 92.4% of subjects in 
the vaccine group. Any solicited systemic AR after any dose was reported by 53.5%  of subjects in the 
placebo group and by 84.1%  in the vaccine group. Pain at the injection site was the most common 
solicited local AR in the mRNA-1273  group (92%), followed by lymphadenopathy (axillary 
swelling/tenderness; 19.8%), injection  site swelling (14.7%),  and injection site  erythema (10%). The 
most frequent reported solicited systemic ARs in the m-RNA-1273  vaccine group after each dose were 
fatigue (70%),  and headache (64.7%). This was followed by myalgia (61.5%),  arthralgia (46.4%),  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 147/169 
 
 
 
 
chills (45.4%).  Local and systemic reactogenicity increased from dose 1 to dose 2. The increase was 
more evident for systemic solicited ARs compared with  local solicited ARs. The majority of solicited 
systemic and local ARs was mild to moderate.  
Any grade 3 or 4 solicited systemic AR was reported from 3.0% of subjects in the vaccine group after 
dose 1 and by 15.9%  after dose 2.  No local AE grade 4  were reported and the majority of grade 3 local 
AEs was pain at the  injection site. After the  first injection, grade 4 solicited systemic ARs were reported 
by 5 participants in the vaccine group vs. 6 participants in the placebo group. After the second 
injection, grade 4 events occurred in 14 vs. 3 subjects. Nearly all grade 4 events were fever >40°C, 
except for single reports of fatigue, arthralgia and nausea/vomiting in the mRNA-1273  group.  
Solicited local ARs persisted longer after dose 2 (median 3 days) than after dose 1 (median 2 days). 
Solicited systemic ARs generally persisted for a median of 2 days after each dose. 
Unsolicited adverse events occurred in a similar rate in both  placebo and vaccine group. Related were 
8.2% in  the vaccine and 4.5% in the placebo group of which  severe were 0.5% (vaccine) and 0.2% 
(placebo). The most common events are similar to events seen with  any vaccine, e.g. fatigue, 
headache, myalgia and arthralgia. Urticaria and rash were the  most commonly seen skin and tissue 
events, most of them a continuation  of solicited events reported but  some also starting  a week after 
vaccination.  
The incidences of severe, serious and medically-attended unsolicited AEs were similar between vaccine 
and placebo recipients. However, there were some imbalances for events such as facial swelling, acute 
peripheral facial paralysis, or certain hypersensitivity events (injection  site urticaria, rash).  
Of the SAEs seen in the vaccine group some are also attributable to  the activation of the  inflammatory 
system (e.g. colitis,  cholecystitis, arthritis). Until  the data cut-off, there were 7 subjects with 
treatment-related SAEs in the  vaccine group, compared to 5  subjects in the  placebo group as judged 
by the Investigator, however based on the  information available to date no conclusion on relatedness 
could be drawn. The event of facial swelling in the vaccine group occurred in subjects that  received 
dermal filler injections (hyaluronic acid, hyaluronic acid / Botox combination) prior to vaccination and 
was included in section 4.8 of the SmPC due a reasonable possibility of causal relationship.  
A numerical imbalance is observed for acute peripheral facial paralysis with three cases in the vaccine 
vs. one case in the  placebo arm. All cases in the  vaccine arm showed an onset in  close temporal 
relationship to second injection.  A reasonable possibility of a causal relationship to  the vaccine cannot 
be excluded with  certainty and this  AE should therefore be reflected in the  SmPC section 4.8. 
At the time of the latest  data cut-off  (25 November 2020),  there were single events of anaphylaxis in 
each treatment  group, but  without  a temporal connection to  the injection. Additionally, there was one 
report of anaphylaxis in an individual with  a severe shellfish allergy occurring after vaccination in  the 
context of the emergency use authorisation. This is reflected in  the SmPC (sections 4.4, 4.8).   
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long-term safety data are not yet available. Participants in the clinical trials will be followed until 24 
months after the second dose (study P301) or 12 months after the second dose (studies P201, P101). 
Long-term safety is considered as missing information in the RMP and will be characterised as part of 
the continuation  of the pivotal clinical trial, other trials and a PASS. 
No difference was observed with regards to incidence and severity of reactogenicity in  subjects who 
were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline compared with subjects who were seronegative for 
SARs-CoV-2 at baseline. The proportion of seropositive subjects was small with  343  subjects SARS-
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 148/169 
 
 
 
 
CoV2 positive at baseline who received mRNA-1273 vaccine (2.3%) and 337  seropositive placebo 
subjects (2.2%), however no specific concerns arise in the observed safety profile so far. 
The safety and reactogenicity data in a limited number of HIV infected individuals with  stable antiviral 
therapy did not  reveal any concern. Limited  safety data are available in individuals with  autoimmune 
disorders and individual under immune-suppressive treatment. An immunogenicity and safety trial in 
immunosuppressed/immunodeficient people will  be conducted post-authorisation  as reflected in the 
RMP. 
Very limited clinical safety data are available for use of the vaccine during  pregnancy and lactation  that 
do not allow any conclusions. A PASS and a pregnancy exposure registry are planned in the RMP  to 
generate data post-authorisation. 
Whereas individuals having a higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease due to comorbidities were 
included in the study, these were required to be stable at  baseline. No safety data are available for frail 
individuals with  unstable comorbidities. Plans to gather data post-authorisation are laid down in  the 
RMP.  
Reactogenicity was lower in individuals of 65  years of age and older compared with the  younger 
population 18 to  65 years of age. Approximately 24.8% (3763)  of subjects older than 65 years of age 
were included in the  vaccine group of the phase 3 trial. However, there were limited participants for 
the age group ≥85  years and above. It  is however not  anticipated, that  reactogenicity will increase by 
age.  
The available data (non-clinical,  clinical, neutralising capacity of antibodies) do not raise a concern 
regarding vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease at the time being. However, the possibility of 
enhanced disease cannot be excluded with  certainty. The current version of the RMP lists  vaccine-
associated enhanced respiratory disease as a safety concern and an important potential risk and plans 
for monitoring are included. 
COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna contains lipid nanoparticles that  include two  novel lipid components (SM-
102,  PEG2000-DMG). The distribution,  metabolism and PK of SM-102  has not been extensively studied 
but  submitted data on a close structural analogue show efficient hydrolysis and clearance. Currently 
the involvement of PEG as an antigen triggering allergic reactions is increasingly being recognised. 
Anaphylaxis has been recognised as an established risk, but  the responsible antigen is currently 
unknown and non-IgE mediated allergic reactions remain a possibility. The low molecular weight  of the 
PEG, the small amount contained in the vaccine and the administration of only few doses do not  raise 
concerns regarding possible accumulation.  
Interaction with  other vaccines has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Safety of concomitant use with 
other vaccines will be investigated post-authorisation as part of a PASS study included in the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In a large pivotal phase 3 trial, overall excellent efficacy in preventing COVID-19 of any severity has 
been demonstrated in individuals aged 18  years and older. The results are considered robust based on 
the study design and are further supported by the different secondary endpoints and analyses. 
Subgroup analyses indicate similar vaccine efficacy in those individuals that are considered to  be at a 
higher risk of severe COVID-19 including elderly subjects and those with  underlying health conditions 
known to increase the risk of severe disease and death following  SARS-CoV-2 infection, which  is 
considered as the population at highest need for preventative strategies.  
In addition, preliminary and encouraging VE has also been estimated for the prevention of severe 
COVID-19. 
Despite the  limitations in the  characterisation and control of the  active substance and finished product, 
the available data and the proposed specifications for product related impurities  are considered 
scientifically justified and acceptable in the context of a CMA in  an emergency situation. 
The main shortcoming of the current efficacy dataset is the unusually short follow up of approx. 9 
weeks, but  data will be submitted post-authorisation  as detailed in the specific obligations, RMP, and 
recommendations. More data will be generated post-authorisation to  further characterise longer term 
protection. In the current situation  this gap in knowledge is outweighed by urgent need, high COVID-
19 disease burden, and lack of or limited  availability of preventative and therapeutic remedies. 
It would be desirable to understand if this  vaccine also has an effect on asymptomatic infection and 
viral transmission. Based on the current data this aspect is not answered yet, therefore the possibility 
for achieving herd immunity  has not been demonstrated at the present time. 
The observed safety profile is considered well characterised and acceptable based on short term data. 
ADRs are generally mild to moderate and are self-limited, although local tolerability and systemic ADRs 
overall indicate that  this vaccine appears more reactogenic than  many of the standard vaccines in use. 
Long term safety has to be characterised further and it  is important to analyse the full  2-year safety 
follow-up of the pivotal trial, which  is ongoing. The current dataset gives no indication of vaccine-
enhanced disease, a potential concern that is addressed in the RMP. 
There are very limited  data on use in pregnant women, but a protective effect is anticipated. In the 
light  of the  reassuring data from the DART study,  noting that  pregnancy as such is a risk factor for 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 151/169 
 
 
 
 
 
severe COVID19, and that  pregnant women may additionally belong to other risk groups, vaccination 
may be considered on a case by case basis.  
There are no data for breast-feeding women. Based on biological plausibility  no risk for the  breastfed 
infant is anticipated.   
There are no efficacy data in immunocompromised individuals. Such patients may not  be protected as 
well as immunocompetent individuals by vaccination. While there are limited safety data too in the 
immunocompromised subjects (a broad and disparate category), no particular safety issues are 
anticipated, and the benefit/risk balance of vaccination of such subjects is deemed positive, also in 
light  of the  underlying excess risk of COVID-19. Nevertheless studies are planned in the  post-
authorisation phase as detailed in the RMP. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Given the clearly demonstrated favourable effect and considering the  overall characteristics of the 
unfavourable effects, a favourable B/R balance in the proposed indication is concluded. This conclusion 
is particularly relevant for individuals at elevated risk of severe COVID-19 disease, like the elderly 
(especially those older than  75 years of age) and those with comorbid conditions that  have been 
described to increase the risk of severe disease. 
Although only limited data are available on HIV infected individuals, immunosuppressed /immuno-
deficient individuals in general have a high risk of developing severe COVID-19. No specific safety 
issues are expected in this group, hence the benefit/risk balance for vaccination is also regarded as 
favourable. 
Pregnant women are likely to be at an increased risk of severe COVID-19. The overall data in this 
population are not  sufficient to make a general recommendation for use of the vaccine but  an 
individual benefit-risk appraisal appears appropriate given the reassuring data from the DART study. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Given the current emergency situation, it  is considered that the  identified uncertainties can be 
addressed post-authorisation through specific obligations, including the  continuation of the pivotal 
clinical study as long as possible, and post-approval effectiveness studies and routine disease 
surveillance. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
Efficacy, safety and  immunogenicity  was demonstrated using  clinical  batches of  vaccine manufactured 
at Scale A. The commercial batches are produced using an up-scale process (initial Scale B for the active 
substance,  Scale  B  for  the  finished  product),  and  the  comparability  of  these  processes  rely  on 
demonstration  of  comparable biological,  chemical and  physical  characteristics  of  the  active  substance 
and finished product. 
Although the  data provided so far are not considered to be complete with respect to the requested 
characterisation of the product, comparability, process validation and stability,  the quality of the 
product is deemed sufficiently assured. Nevertheless, the applicant is requested to review the 
specification of the  active substance and finished product and provide additional stability  data when 
further manufacturing experience is gained.  
Assessment report

Based on  the above, the following  uncertainties are considered to  be of importance for the  benefit-risk 
assessment: 
•  Comparability between the product used in the clinical trials and the commercial product 
•  Validation  of  the  commercial  scale  manufacturing  process  at  the  sites  registered  for  EU 
production 
•  Quality control of the product at release and during storage 
The agreed specifications in relation to the control of the active substance and finished product are 
subject to review once more batch analysis data from routine manufacturing at the sites registered for 
EU manufacture are available. While some of the characterisation data still  need to  be completed and 
taking into account the  emergency situation, the characterisation of the active substance and finished 
product are considered acceptable, and the proposed specifications for RNA purity are considered 
scientifically justified and acceptable subject to  specific obligations.  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product  fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed in section 3.7.2. 
It is likely that  the applicant will  be able to provide comprehensive data. 
Studies are underway to  complete the characterisation of the  active substance and finished product, 
and additional clinical data from batches currently in  use in ongoing clinical studies, will  complete the 
clinical qualification of these specifications. Based upon the applicant’s justification  and commitment, 
detailed plans have been agreed with  the applicant and reflected in the  quality part of this  assessment 
regarding data to be generated and submitted  with interim  milestones for assessment by the  CHMP in 
order to complete all proposed specific obligations. Based on the applicant’s plans and documentation, 
it is expected that  data to fulfil all quality SOs will be submitted gradually between January and June 
2021. 
Furthermore, the applicant will continue  the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 randomised, placebo-controlled, 
observer-blind study P301 to obtain 2-year long-term data and to ensure sufficient follow-up in order 
to confirm the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. The completion of the Phase 3 study 
P301 will  lead to comprehensive date on the  efficacy and safety of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will  be addressed. 
There is an urgent public health need for rapid development of vaccines to prevent the  global burden 
of disease associated with  SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. Comirnaty (COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine (nucleoside-modified)) was approved in the EU  on 21/12/2020,  being the first approved 
vaccine against COVID-19. Despite the recent granting  of a conditional marketing authorisation for 
Comirnaty, there is still  an unmet  medical need for further vaccines to be authorised in  order to 
increase the supply and availability across the EU.   
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the  risks inherent in the fact 
that  additional data are still required.  
Convincing efficacy evidence, including in the elderly and those with  comorbid conditions has been 
provided and long-term effectiveness and safety data will be provided post-authorisation. Taking all 
this into  account, it would  not be considered appropriate to withhold  a highly beneficial vaccine 
considering the  severity of COVID-19 disease and the current global pandemic situation,  since the 
Assessment report  
EMA/15689/2021  
Page 153/169 
 
 
 
 
demonstrated benefits in  the current emergency setting clearly outweigh the uncertainties of the 
available data as outlined  above. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is positive. 
Eligibility  to a conditional marketing authorisation as well as requirements have been demonstrated in 
line with  provisions of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP  review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that  the benefit-risk balance of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is favourable in the following indication: 
‘COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by 
SARS-CoV-2 virus in individuals 18 years of age and older’. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional  marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions and specific obligations: 
In view of the declared Public Health  Emergency of International Concern and in order to ensure early 
supply this medicinal product is subject to  a time-limited  exemption allowing  reliance on batch control 
testing  conducted in  the registered site(s) that  are located in a third  country. This exemption ceases to 
be valid on 31 January 2021. Implementation of EU based batch control arrangements, including the 
necessary variations to the terms of the  marketing authorisation, has to be completed by 31 January 
2021  at the latest, in line with  the agreed plan for this transfer of testing. 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Official batch release 
In accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC,  the official batch release will be undertaken by a 
state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that  purpose. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety  Update  Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the  list of Union reference dates (EURD list)  provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC  and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this  product 
within  6 months following  authorisation.

to EMA as soon as available), which  allow to extract the  best available information from the ongoing Phase 3 
study with  respect to duration of protection, correlate of protection, vaccine-enhanced disease, prevention of 
asymptomatic infection and other long-term safety data. This sSAP should be further discussed and agreed 
on with  the EMA preferably in a scientific advice procedure. 
Aside of the SOB above to  provide the final CSR by end of 2022,  it is recommended to prepare a separate 
CSR for part A of this  study to be submitted as soon as available in 2021 (including  outstanding  results for 
prevention of asymptomatic infection).

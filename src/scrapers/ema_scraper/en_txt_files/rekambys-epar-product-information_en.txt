CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
REKAMBYS is indicated, in combination with cabotegravir injection, for the treatment of human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 
RNA < 50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen without present or past evidence of viral 
resistance to, and no prior virological failure with, agents of the NNRTI and INI class (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Therapy should be prescribed by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. Each 
injection should be administered by a healthcare professional.
Prior to starting REKAMBYS, the healthcare professional should carefully select patients who 
agree to the required injection schedule and counsel patients about the importance of adherence 
to scheduled dosing visits to help maintain viral suppression and reduce the risk of viral 
rebound and potential development of resistance associated with missed doses.
Following discontinuation of REKAMBYS in combination with cabotegravir injection, it is 
essential to adopt an alternative, fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than one 
month after the last every 1 month injection of REKAMBYS or two months after the last every 
2 months injection of REKAMBYS (see section 4.4).
The prescribing information for cabotegravir injection should be consulted for recommended dosing.
2
Posology
REKAMBYS may be initiated with oral lead-in or without (direct to injection).
The healthcare professional and patient may decide to use rilpivirine tablets as an oral lead-in prior to 
the initiation of REKAMBYS injections to assess tolerability (see Table 1), or proceed directly to 
REKAMBYS therapy (see Tables 2 and 3, for monthly and every 2 months dosing recommendations, 
respectively).
Oral lead-in
When used for oral lead-in prior to the initiation of REKAMBYS, rilpivirine oral tablets, together with 
cabotegravir oral tablets, should be taken for approximately 1 month (at least 28 days) to assess 
tolerability to rilpivirine and cabotegravir. One rilpivirine 25-mg tablet should be taken with a meal 
with one cabotegravir 30-mg tablet once daily (see Table 1).

Dosing Recommendations When Switching From Monthly to Every 2 Months Injections
Patients switching from a monthly continuation injection schedule to an every 2 months continuation 
injection schedule should receive a single 900 mg intramuscular injection of REKAMBYS one month 
after the last 600 mg REKAMBYS continuation injection dose and then 900 mg every 2 months 
thereafter.
Dosing Recommendations When Switching From Every 2 Months to Monthly Injections
Patients switching from an every 2 months continuation injection schedule to a monthly continuation 
injection schedule should receive a single 600 mg intramuscular injection of REKAMBYS 
two months after the last 900 mg REKAMBYS continuation injection dose and then 600 mg monthly 
thereafter.
Missed doses
Patients who miss an injection visit should be clinically reassessed to ensure resumption of therapy is 
appropriate. See Table 4 and 5 for dosing recommendations after a missed injection.
Missed every 1 month injection (Oral Dosing to Replace Up to 2 Consecutive Monthly Injections)
If a patient plans to miss a scheduled injection by more than 7 days, daily oral therapy (one rilpivirine 
tablet [25 mg] and one cabotegravir tablet [30 mg]) may be used to replace up to 2 consecutive 
monthly injection visits. Limited data is available on oral bridging with other fully suppressive 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) (mainly INI-based), see section 5.1.
The first dose of oral therapy should be taken 1 month (± 7 days) after the last injection doses of 
REKAMBYS and cabotegravir. Injection dosing should be resumed on the day oral dosing completes, 
as recommended in Table 4.
In case more than two months need to be covered for, ie, missing more than two monthly injections, an 
alternative oral regimen should be initiated one month (± 7 days) after the final injection of 
REKAMBYS.

possible.
Re-initiate the patient on the 900 mg dose, and then continue to follow 
the monthly 600 mg injection schedule. 
Missed every 2 months injection (Oral Dosing to Replace 1 Every 2 Months Injection)
If a patient plans to miss a scheduled injection visit by more than 7 days, daily oral therapy (one 
rilpivirine tablet [25 mg] and one cabotegravir tablet [30 mg]) may be used to replace one ‘every 
2 months’ injection visit. Limited data is available on oral bridging with other fully suppressive ART 
(mainly INI-based), see section 5.1.

The first dose of oral therapy should be taken approximately two months (±7 days) after the last 
injection doses of REKAMBYS and cabotegravir. Injection dosing should be resumed on the day oral 
dosing completes, as recommended in Table 5.
In case more than two months need to be covered for, ie, missing more than one ‘every 2 months’
injection, an alternative oral regimen should be initiated two months (± 7 days) after the final injection 
of REKAMBYS.

Elderly
There is limited information regarding the use of REKAMBYS in patients > 65 years of age. No dose 
adjustment of REKAMBYS is required in older patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. In patients with 
severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease, the combination of REKAMBYS with a strong 
CYP3A inhibitor should only be used if the benefit outweighs the risk. Subjects with estimated 
creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 were not included in the Phase 3 studies. No data are 
available in subjects receiving dialysis although differences in pharmacokinetics are not expected in 
this population (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
score A or B), but caution is advised in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No data are 
available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score C); therefore REKAMBYS is 
not recommended in these patients (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of REKAMBYS in children and adolescents aged < 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available.
Method of administration
For intramuscular use.
Care should be taken to avoid inadvertent injection of REKAMBYS into a blood vessel. The 
suspension should be injected slowly (see section 4.4).
Prior to administration, the REKAMBYS vial should be brought to room temperature.
REKAMBYS should be administered by a healthcare professional. For instructions on administration, 
see “Instructions for Use” in the package leaflet.
5
REKAMBYS should always be co-administered with a cabotegravir injection. REKAMBYS and 
cabotegravir injections should be administered at separate gluteal injection sites during the same visit. 
The order of injections is not important.
When administering REKAMBYS, the healthcare professional should take into consideration the body 
mass index (BMI) of the patient to ensure that the needle length is sufficient to reach the gluteus 
muscle. The pack contains 1 injection needle (see section 6.5).
The vial should be held firmly and shaken vigorously for a full 10 seconds. The vial should be inverted 
and the resuspension should be checked. It should look uniform. If the suspension is not uniform, the 
vial should be shaken again. It is normal to see small air bubbles.
Injections must be administered to the ventrogluteal (recommended) or the dorsogluteal sites.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
REKAMBYS must not be co-administered with the following medicinal products, as significant 
decreases in rilpivirine plasma concentrations may occur (due to CYP3A enzyme induction), which 
may result in loss of therapeutic effect of REKAMBYS (see section 4.5):
-
-
-
-
the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin
the antimycobacterials rifabutin, rifampicin, rifapentine
the systemic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, except as a single dose treatment
St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Risk of resistance following treatment discontinuation
To minimise the risk of developing viral resistance it is essential to adopt an alternative, fully 
suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than one month after the last every 1 month 
injection of REKAMBYS or two months after the last every 2 months injection of REKAMBYS.
If virologic failure is suspected, an alternative regimen should be adopted as soon as possible.
Long-acting properties of rilpivirine injection
Residual concentrations of rilpivirine may remain in the systemic circulation of patients for prolonged 
periods (up to 4 years in some patients) and should be considered upon discontinuation of 
REKAMBYS (see sections 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.9).
Baseline factors associated with virological failure
Before starting the regimen, it should be taken into account that multivariable analyses indicate that a 
combination of at least 2 of the following baseline factors may be associated with an increased risk of 
virological failure: archived rilpivirine resistance mutations, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, or BMI 
≥ 30 kg/m2. Available data suggest that virologic failure occurs more often when these patients are 
treated according to the every 2 month dosing schedule as compared to the monthly dosing regimen. In 
patients with an incomplete or uncertain treatment history without pre-treatment resistance analyses,
caution is warranted in the presence of either BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 or HIV-1 subtype A6/A1 (see 
section 5.1).
6
Post-injection reactions
Accidental intravenous administration may result in AEs due to temporarily high plasma 
concentrations. In clinical studies, serious post-injection reactions were reported within minutes after 
the injection of rilpivirine. These events included symptoms such as dyspnoea, bronchospasm,
agitation, abdominal cramping, rash/urticaria, dizziness, flushing, sweating, oral numbness, changes in 
blood pressure, and pain (e.g., back and chest). These events were very rare and began to resolve 
within minutes after the injection. Some of the patients received symptomatic treatment, at the 
discretion of the treating physician.
Carefully follow the Instructions for Use when preparing and administering REKAMBYS (see 
section 4.2). Observe patients briefly (approximately 10 minutes) after the injection. If a patient 
experiences a post-injection reaction, monitor and treat as clinically indicated.
Cardiovascular
REKAMBYS should be used with caution when co-administered with a medicinal product with a 
known risk of Torsade de Pointes. At supra-therapeutic doses (75 and 300 mg once daily), oral 
rilpivirine has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) 
(see sections 4.5, 4.8 and 5.2). Oral rilpivirine at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily is not 
associated with a clinically relevant effect on QTc. Plasma rilpivirine concentrations after 
REKAMBYS injections are comparable to those during such oral rilpivirine therapy.
HBV/HCV co-infection
Patients with hepatitis B co-infection were excluded from studies with REKAMBYS. It is not 
recommended to initiate REKAMBYS in patients with hepatitis B co-infection. In patients co-infected 
with hepatitis B receiving oral rilpivirine, the incidence of hepatic enzyme elevation was higher than 
in patients receiving oral rilpivirine who were not hepatitis B co-infected. Physicians should refer to 
current treatment guidelines for the management of HIV infection in patients co-infected with hepatitis 
B virus.
Limited data is available in patients with hepatitis C co-infection. In patients co-infected with hepatitis 
C receiving oral rilpivirine, the incidence of hepatic enzyme elevation was higher than in patients 
receiving oral rilpivirine who were not hepatitis C co-infected. The pharmacokinetic exposure of oral 
and injectable rilpivirine in co-infected patients was comparable to that in patients without hepatitis C 
co-infection. Monitoring of liver function is recommended in patients with hepatitis C co-infection.
Interactions with other medicinal products
REKAMBYS should not be administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products, except for
cabotegravir injection for the treatment of HIV-1 infection (see section 4.5).
Pregnancy
There are limited data of REKAMBYS in pregnant women. REKAMBYS is not recommended during 
pregnancy unless the expected benefit justifies the potential risk. Lower exposures of oral rilpivirine 
were observed when rilpivirine 25 mg once daily was taken during pregnancy. In the Phase 3 studies 
with oral rilpivirine, lower rilpivirine exposure, similar to that seen during pregnancy, has been 
associated with an increased risk of virological failure, therefore viral load should be monitored 
closely. Alternatively, switching to another ART regimen could be considered (see sections 4.6, 5.1 
and 5.2).
Immune reactivation syndrome
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic 
7
pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, 
such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. 
Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, 
and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and 
treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune 
hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the 
reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of 
treatment.
Opportunistic infections
Patients should be advised that REKAMBYS or any other antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV 
infection and that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV 
infection. Therefore, patients should remain under close clinical observation by physicians 
experienced in the treatment of these associated HIV diseases.
Excipients
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
REKAMBYS, in combination with cabotegravir injection, is intended for use as a complete regimen 
for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and should not be administered with other antiretroviral medicinal 
products for the treatment of HIV-1. Therefore, information regarding drug-drug interactions with 
other antiretroviral medicinal products is not provided. From a drug interaction perspective, there are 
no limitations on the use of other antiretroviral medicinal products after discontinuing REKAMBYS.
For the oral lead-in rilpivirine treatment and in case missed doses are replaced by oral rilpivirine 
treatment, refer to the oral rilpivirine tablet SmPC for information about drug interactions.
Medicinal products that affect rilpivirine exposure
Rilpivirine is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A. Medicinal products that induce or 
inhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine (see section 5.2). Co-administration of 
rilpivirine and medicinal products that induce CYP3A has been observed to decrease the plasma 
concentrations of rilpivirine, which could reduce the therapeutic effect of rilpivirine.
Co-administration of rilpivirine and medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A has been observed to
increase the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine.
When using oral rilpivirine, proton pump inhibitors are contraindicated (see rilpivirine tablet SmPC, 
section 4.3).
Medicinal products that are affected by the use of rilpivirine
Rilpivirine is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of medicinal products 
metabolised by CYP enzymes.
Rilpivirine inhibits P-glycoprotein in vitro (IC50 is 9.2 μM). In a clinical study, oral rilpivirine (25 mg
once daily) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.
Rilpivirine is an in vitro inhibitor of the transporter MATE-2K with an IC50 of < 2.7 nM. The clinical 
implications of this finding are currently unknown.

Ω % increase/decrease based on Drug-Drug Interaction studies with oral rilpivirine
* The interaction between rilpivirine and the medicinal product was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug-drug 
interactions shown are predicted.
# This interaction study has been performed with a dose higher than the recommended dose for rilpivirine assessing the 
maximal effect on the co-administered medicinal product. The dosing recommendation is applicable to the 
recommended dose of rilpivirine of 25 mg once daily.
QT prolonging medicinal products
Oral rilpivirine at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily is not associated with a clinically 
relevant effect on QTc. Rilpivirine plasma concentrations after REKAMBYS injections at the 
recommended dose of 600 mg monthly or 900 mg every 2 months, are comparable to those achieved 
with oral rilpivirine at a dose of 25 mg qd. In a study of healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of 
oral rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc 
interval of the ECG (see section 5.1). REKAMBYS should be used with caution when co-administered 
with a medicinal product with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes (see section 4.4).
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
The effect of REKAMBYS on human pregnancy is unknown.
A moderate amount of data with oral rilpivirine in pregnant women (between 300-1000 pregnancy 
outcomes) indicate no malformative or foetal/neonatal toxicity of rilpivirine.
A study of 19 pregnant women treated with oral rilpivirine in combination with a background regimen 
during the second and third trimesters, and postpartum, showed lower exposures of oral rilpivirine 
11
during pregnancy, therefore viral load should be monitored closely if REKAMBYS is used during 
pregnancy.
Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
REKAMBYS is not recommended during pregnancy unless the expected benefit justifies the potential 
risk.
An alternative oral regimen should be considered in line with current treatment guidelines. After 
discontinuation of REKAMBYS, rilpivirine may remain in systemic circulation for up to 4 years in 
some patients (see section 4.4).
Breast-feeding
It is expected that rilpivirine will be secreted into human milk based on animal data, although this has 
not been confirmed in humans. Rilpivirine may be present in human milk for up to 4 years in some 
patients after discontinuation of REKAMBYS.
In order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that women living with HIV do 
not breast-feed.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of rilpivirine on fertility are available. No clinically relevant effects on 
fertility were seen in animal studies (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Patients should be informed that fatigue, dizziness and somnolence could occur when treated with 
REKAMBYS (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequently reported ARs from every 1 month dosing studies were injection site reactions (up 
to 84%), headache (up to 12%) and pyrexia (10%).
The most frequently reported ARs from every 2 months dosing were injection site reactions (76%), 
headache (7%) and pyrexia (7%).

The overall safety profile at Week 96 and Week 124 in the FLAIR study was consistent with that 
observed at Week 48, with no new safety findings identified. In the extension phase of the FLAIR 
study, initiating the rilpivirine plus cabotegravir injection regimen without oral lead-in (direct to 
injection) was not associated with any new safety concerns related to omitting the oral lead-in phase.
Description of selected adverse reactions
Local Injection Site Reactions (ISRs)
Up to 1% of subjects discontinued treatment with rilpivirine and cabotegravir injections because of 
ISRs.
Injection site reactions were generally mild (Grade 1, 70%-75% of subjects) or moderate (Grade 2, 
27%-36% of subjects). 3-4% of subjects experienced severe (Grade 3) ISRs. The median duration of 
ISR events was 3 days. The percentage of subjects reporting ISRs decreased over time.
Weight increased
At the Week 48 time point, subjects in Phase 3 Studies FLAIR and ATLAS, who received rilpivirine
plus cabotegravir gained a median of 1.5 kg in weight; subjects continuing on their current 
antiretroviral regimen (CAR) group gained a median of 1.0 kg (pooled analysis).
In the individual studies FLAIR and ATLAS, the median weight gains in the rilpivirine plus 
cabotegravir arms were 1.3 kg and 1.8 kg, respectively, compared to 1.5 kg and 0.3 kg in the CAR 
arms.
At the 48 week timepoint, in ATLAS-2M the median weight gain in both the monthly and every 
2 months rilpivirine+cabotegravir dosing arms was 1.0 kg.
13
Changes in laboratory chemistry
Elevated transaminases (ALT/AST) were observed in subjects receiving rilpivirine plus cabotegravir 
during the clinical studies. These elevations were primarily attributed to acute viral hepatitis. A few 
subjects on oral rilpivirine plus oral cabotegravir treatment had transaminase elevations attributed to 
suspected drug-related hepatotoxicity; these changes were reversible upon discontinuation of 
treatment.
Small, non-progressive increases in total bilirubin (without clinical jaundice) were observed with 
treatment with rilpivirine plus cabotegravir. These changes are not considered clinically relevant as 
they likely reflect competition between cabotegravir and unconjugated bilirubin for a common 
clearance pathway (UGT1A1).
Elevated lipases were observed during clinical trials with rilpivirine plus cabotegravir. Grade 3 and 4 
lipase increases occurred at a higher incidence with rilpivirine plus cabotegravir compared with CAR. 
These elevations were generally asymptomatic and did not lead to rilpivirine plus cabotegravir 
discontinuation. One case of fatal pancreatitis with Grade 4 lipase and confounding factors (including 
history of pancreatitis) has been reported in study ATLAS-2M for which the causality to the injection 
regimen could not be ruled out.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is currently limited experience with REKAMBYS overdose. If overdose occurs, the patient 
should be treated supportively and as clinically indicated, with monitoring of vital signs and ECG (QT 
interval), as necessary. Since rilpivirine is highly bound to plasma protein, dialysis is unlikely to result 
in significant removal of the active substance.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors, ATC code: J05AG05
Mechanism of action
Rilpivirine is a diarylpyrimidine non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of HIV-1. 
Rilpivirine activity is mediated by non-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). 
Rilpivirine does not inhibit the human cellular DNA polymerases α, β and γ.
Antiviral activity in vitro
Rilpivirine exhibited activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 in an acutely infected 
T-cell line with a median EC50 value for HIV-1/IIIB of 0.73 nM (0.27 ng/mL). Although rilpivirine
demonstrated limited in vitro activity against HIV-2 with EC50 values ranging from 2,510 to 
10,830 nM (920 to 3,970 ng/mL), treatment of HIV-2 infection with rilpivirine is not recommended in 
the absence of clinical data.
14
Rilpivirine also demonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M (subtype A, B, 
C, D, F, G, H) primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from 0.07 to 1.01 nM (0.03 to 0.37 ng/mL) 
and group O primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from 2.88 to 8.45 nM (1.06 to 3.10 ng/mL).
Resistance
Considering all of the available in vitro data and in vivo data generated with oral rilpivirine in 
previously untreated patients, the following resistance-associated mutations, when present at baseline, 
may affect the activity of rilpivirine: K101E, K101P, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138R, E138Q, V179L, 
Y181C, Y181I, Y181V, Y188L, H221Y, F227C, M230I, M230L, and the combination of L100I and 
K103N.
In cell culture
Rilpivirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild-type HIV-1 of different 
origins and subtypes as well as NNRTI resistant HIV-1. The most commonly observed 
resistance-associated mutations that emerged included L100I, K101E, V108I, E138K, V179F, Y181C, 
H221Y, F227C and M230I.
Virologically suppressed patients
The number of subjects who met confirmed virologic failure (CVF) criteria was low across the pooled 
Phase 3 studies ATLAS and FLAIR. There were 7 CVFs on rilpivirine plus cabotegravir (7/591, 1.2%) 
and 7 CVFs on current antiretroviral regimen (7/591, 1.2%) through week 48. In the rilpivirine plus 
cabotegravir group in the pooled analysis, 5/591 (0.8%) subjects had resistance development: 5/591 
(0.8%) and 4/591 (0.7%) with resistance-associated mutations to rilpivirine (K101E [n=1], 
E138A/E/K/T [n=1], E138A [n=1], or E138K [n=2]) and/or cabotegravir (G140R [n=1], Q148R 
[n=2], or N155H [n=1]), respectively. The 4 CVFs on cabotegravir plus rilpivirine in FLAIR had 
HIV-1 subtype A1 (n=3) or AG (n=1). One CVF in FLAIR never received an injection. The 3 CVFs 
on cabotegravir plus rilpivirine in ATLAS had HIV-1 subtype A, A1, or AG. In 2 of these 3 CVFs the 
rilpivirine resistance-associated mutations observed at failure were also observed at baseline in PBMC 
HIV-1 DNA.
In the ATLAS-2M study 10 subjects met CVF criteria through week 48: 8/522 (1.5%) in the Q8W arm 
and 2/523 (0.4%) in the Q4W arm. In the Q8W group 5/522 (1.0%) had resistance development: 4/522 
(0.8%) and 5/522 (1.0%) with resistance-associated mutations to rilpivirine (E138A [n=1], E138K 
[n=1], K101E [n=2], or Y188L [n=1]) and/or cabotegravir (Q148R [n=3] or N155H [n=4]), 
respectively. In the Q4W group 2/523 (0.4%) had resistance development: 1/523 (0.2%) and 2/523 
(0.4%) had rilpivirine (K101E [n=1], M230L [n=1]) and/or cabotegravir (E138K [n=1], Q148R [n=1], 
or N155H [n=1]) resistance-associated mutations, respectively. At baseline in the Q8W arm, 5 subjects 
had rilpivirine resistance-associated mutations and 1 of those subjects carried a cabotegravir 
resistance-associated mutation. Neither subject in the Q4W arm had any rilpivirine or cabotegravir 
resistance-assocaiated mutation at baseline. The 10 CVFs on cabotegravir plus rilpivirine in ATLAS-
2M had HIV-1 subtype A (n=1), A1 (n=2), B (n=4), C (n=2), or Complex (n=1).
Cross-resistance
Site-directed NNRTI mutant virus
In a panel of 67 HIV-1 recombinant laboratory strains with one mutation at RT positions associated 
with NNRTI resistance, including the most commonly found K103N and Y181C, rilpivirine showed 
antiviral activity against 64 (96%) of these strains. The single resistance-associated mutations
associated with a loss of susceptibility to rilpivirine were: K101P, Y181I and Y181V. The K103N 
mutation did not result in reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine by itself, but the combination of K103N 
and L100I resulted in a 7-fold reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine.
Recombinant clinical isolates
Rilpivirine retained sensitivity (fold change ≤ biological cut-off) against 62% of 4,786 HIV-1 
recombinant clinical isolates resistant to efavirenz and/or nevirapine.
15
Virologically suppressed patients
In the week 48 analysis of the Phase 3 studies ATLAS and FLAIR, 5/7 CVFs had phenotypic 
resistance against rilpivirine at failure. Among these 5 patients, phenotypic cross-resistance was 
observed against efavirenz (n=4), etravirine (n=3), and nevirapine (n=4).
Effects on electrocardiogram
No effect on QTcF interval was shown for oral rilpivirine at the recommended dose of 25 mg once 
daily in a randomised, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) controlled crossover 
study in 60 healthy adults, with 13 measurements over 24 hours at steady-state. Plasma rilpivirine 
concentrations after REKAMBYS injections are comparable to those achieved with oral rilpivirine at 
dose of 25 mg qd. REKAMBYS at the recommended dose of 600 mg monthly or 900 mg every 
2 months is not associated with a clinically relevant effect on QTc.
When supratherapeutic doses of 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily of oral rilpivirine were 
studied in healthy adults, the maximum mean time-matched (95% upper confidence bound) 
differences in QTcF interval from placebo after baseline correction were 10.7 (15.3) and 23.3 (28.4) 
ms, respectively. Steady-state administration of oral rilpivirine 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once 
daily resulted in a mean Cmax approximately 4.4-fold and 11.6-fold, respectively, higher than the mean 
steady-state Cmax observed with the recommended 600 mg once monthly dose of REKAMBYS. Steady 
state administration of oral rilpivirine 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily resulted in a mean Cmax
approximately 4.1-fold and 10.7-fold, respectively, higher than the mean steady state Cmax observed 
with the recommended 900 mg every 2 months dose of REKAMBYS.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Every 1 month dosing
The efficacy of REKAMBYS plus cabotegravir injection has been evaluated in two Phase 3
randomised, multicentre, active-controlled, parallel-arm, open-label, non-inferiority studies, FLAIR 
(201584) and ATLAS (201585). The primary analysis was conducted after all subjects completed their 
week 48 visit or discontinued the study prematurely.
Patients virologically suppressed (on prior dolutegravir-based regimen for 20 weeks)
In FLAIR, 629 HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive subjects received a dolutegravir 
integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INI) containing regimen for 20 weeks (either 
dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine or dolutegravir + 2 other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
if subjects were HLA-B*5701 positive). Subjects who were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA 
< 50 copies per mL, n=566) were then randomised (1:1) to receive either a rilpivirine plus 
cabotegravir regimen or remain on the CAR. Subjects randomised to receive the rilpivirine plus 
cabotegravir regimen, initiated treatment with oral lead-in dosing with a cabotegravir (30 mg) tablet 
plus a rilpivirine (25 mg) tablet once daily for at least 4 weeks, followed by treatment with 
cabotegravir injection (month 1: 600 mg, month 2 onwards: 400 mg injection) plus rilpivirine injection 
(month 1: 900 mg injection, month 2 onwards: 600 mg injection), monthly, for up to 96 weeks.
Patients virologically suppressed (stable on prior ART for at least 6 months)
In ATLAS, 616 HIV-1-infected, ART-experienced, virologically-suppressed (for at least 6 months) 
subjects (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies per mL) were randomised (1:1) and received either a rilpivirine plus 
cabotegravir regimen or remained on the CAR. Subjects randomised to receive the rilpivirine plus 
cabotegravir regimen initiated treatment with oral lead-in dosing with a cabotegravir (30 mg) tablet 
plus a rilpivirine (25 mg) tablet once daily for at least 4 weeks, followed by treatment with 
cabotegravir injection (month 1: 600 mg, month 2 onwards: 400 mg injection) plus rilpivirine injection 
(month 1: 900 mg injection, month 2 onwards: 600 mg injection), monthly, for an additional 44 weeks. 
In ATLAS, 50%, 17%, and 33% of subjects received an NNRTI, PI, or INI (respectively) as their 
baseline third treatment agent class prior to randomisation and this was similar between treatment 
arms.
16
Pooled Phase 3 studies
At baseline, in the pooled analysis, in the rilpivirine plus cabotegravir arm the median age of subjects 
was 38 years, 27% were female, 27% were non-white, 1% were ≥ 65 years and 7% had CD4+ cell 
count less than 350 cells per mm3; these characteristics were similar between treatment arms.
The primary endpoint of both studies was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA 
≥ 50 copies/mL at week 48 (snapshot algorithm for the ITT-E population).
In a pooled analysis of the two Phase 3 studies, rilpivirine plus cabotegravir was non-inferior to CAR 
on the proportion of subjects having plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 c/mL (1.9% and 1.7%, respectively) at 
week 48. The adjusted treatment difference between rilpivirine plus cabotegravir and CAR (0.2; 95% 
CI: -1.4, 1.7) met the non-inferiority criterion (upper bound of the 95% CI below 4%) [See Table 8].
The primary endpoint and other week 48 outcomes, including outcomes by key baseline factors, for 
FLAIR, ATLAS, and pooled data are shown in Table 8 and Table 9.

Week 96 FLAIR
In the FLAIR study at 96 Weeks, the results remained consistent with the results at 48 Weeks. The 
proportion of subjects having plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 c/mL in rilpivirine plus cabotegravir (n=283) 
and CAR (n=283) was 3.2% and 3.2%, respectively (adjusted treatment difference between 
REKAMBYS plus cabotegravir and CAR [0.0; 95% CI: -2.9, 2.9]). The proportion of subjects having 
plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 c/mL in REKAMBYS plus cabotegravir and CAR was 87% and 89%, 
respectively (adjusted treatment difference between REKAMBYS plus cabotegravir and CAR [-2.8; 
95% CI: -8.2, 2.5]).
Week 124 FLAIR Direct to Injection versus Oral Lead-In
In the FLAIR study, an evaluation of safety and efficacy was performed at Week 124 for patients 
electing to switch at Week 100 from abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine to rilpivirine plus cabotegravir 
in the Extension Phase. Subjects were given the option to switch with or without an oral lead-in phase, 
creating an oral lead-in group and a direct to injection group.
At Week 124, the proportion of subjects having plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 c/mL was 1/121 (0.8%) and 
1/111 (0.9%) for the oral lead-in and direct to injection groups, respectively. The rates of virologic 
suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 c/mL) were similar in both the oral lead-in group (113/121 [93.4%])
and direct to injection group (110/111 [99.1%]).
Every 2 months dosing
Patients virologically suppressed (stable on prior ART for at least 6 months)
The efficacy and safety of rilpivirine injection given every 2 months, has been evaluated in one 
Phase 3b randomised, multicentre, parallel-arm, open-label, non-inferiority study, ATLAS-2M 
(207966). The primary analysis was conducted after all subjects completed their week 48 visit or 
discontinued the study prematurely.
In ATLAS-2M, 1045 HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced, virologically suppressed subjects were 
randomised (1:1) and received a rilpivirine plus cabotegravir injection regimen administered either 
every 2 months or monthly. Subjects initially on non-cabotegravir/rilpivirine treatment received oral 
lead-in treatment comprising one rilpivirine tablet (25 mg) plus one cabotegravir tablet (30 mg), daily, 
for at least 4 weeks. Subjects randomised to monthly rilpivirine injections (month 1: 900 mg injection, 
month 2 onwards: 600 mg injection) and cabotegravir injections (month 1: 600 mg injection, month 2
onwards: 400 mg injection administered) received treatment for an additional 44 weeks. Subjects 
randomised to every 2 months rilpivirine injections (900 mg injection at months 1, 2, 4 and every 
2 months thereafter) and cabotegravir injections (600 mg injection at months 1, 2, 4 and every 
2 months thereafter) received treatment for an additional 44 weeks. Prior to randomisation, 63%, 13% 
and 24% of subjects received rilpivirine plus cabotegravir for 0 weeks, 1 to 24 weeks and > 24 weeks, 
respectively.
18
At baseline, the median age of subjects was 42 years, 27% were female, 27% were non-white, 4% 
were ≥65 years, and 6% had a CD4+ cell count less than 350 cells per mm3; these characteristics were 
similar between the treatment arms.
The primary endpoint in ATLAS-2M was the proportion of subjects with a plasma HIV-1 RNA 
≥50 c/mL at week 48 (snapshot algorithm for the ITT-E population).
In ATLAS-2M, rilpivirine plus cabotegravir administered every 2 months was non-inferior to 
cabotegravir and rilpivirine administered every month on the proportion of subjects having plasma 
HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 c/mL (1.7% and 1.0%, respectively) at week 48. The adjusted treatment difference 
between cabotegravir plus rilpivirine administered every 2 months and every month (0.8; 95% CI: 
-0.6, 2.2) met the non-inferiority criterion (upper bound of the 95% CI below 4%).

In the ATLAS-2M study, treatment differences on the primary endpoint across baseline characteristics 
(CD4+ lymphocyte count, gender, race, BMI, age and prior exposure to cabotegravir/rilpivirine) were 
not clinically meaningful.
The efficacy results at Week 96 are consistent with the results of the primary endpoint at Week 48. 
Rilpivirine plus cabotegravir injections administered every 2 months is non-inferior to rilpivirine and 
cabotegravir administered every month. The proportion of subjects having plasma HIV-1 RNA 
≥50 c/mL at Week 96 in rilpivirine plus cabotegravir every 2 months dosing (n=522) and rilpivirine 
plus cabotegravir monthly dosing (n=523) was 2.1% and 1.1% respectively (adjusted treatment 
difference between rilpivirine plus cabotegravir every 2 months dosing and monthly dosing [1.0; 95% 
CI: -0.6, 2.5]). The proportion of subjects having plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 96 in 
rilpivirine plus cabotegravir every 2 months dosing and rilpivirine plus cabotegravir monthly dosing 
was 91% and 90.2% respectively (adjusted treatment difference between rilpivirine plus cabotegravir 
every 2 months dosing and monthly dosing [0.8; 95% CI: -2.8, 4.3]).
The efficacy results at Week 152 are consistent with the results of the primary endpoint at Week 48 
and at Week 96. Rilpivirine plus cabotegravir injections administered every 2 months is non-inferior to 
rilpivirine and cabotegravir administered every month. In an ITT analysis, the proportion of subjects 
having plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL at Week 152 in rilpivirine plus cabotegravir every 2 months 
dosing (n=522) and rilpivirine plus cabotegravir monthly dosing (n=523) was 2.7% and 1.0% 
respectively (adjusted treatment difference between rilpivirine plus cabotegravir every 2 months 
dosing and monthly dosing [1.7; 95% CI: 0.1, 3.3]). In an ITT analysis, the proportion of subjects 
having plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 152 in rilpivirine plus cabotegravir every 2 months 
dosing and rilpivirine plus cabotegravir monthly dosing was 87% and 86% respectively (adjusted 
treatment difference between rilpivirine plus cabotegravir every 2 months dosing and monthly dosing 
[1.5; 95% CI: -2.6, 5.6]).
Post-hoc analyses
Multivariable analyses of pooled Phase 3 studies (ATLAS through 96 weeks, FLAIR through 
124 weeks, ATLAS-2M through 152 weeks) examined the influence of various factors on the risk of 
CVF. The baseline factors analysis (BFA) examined baseline viral and participants characteristics and
dosing regimen; and the multivariable analysis (MVA) included the baseline factors and incorporated 
post-baseline predicted plasma drug concentrations on CVF using regression modelling with a variable 
selection procedure. Following a total of 4291 person-years, the unadjusted CVF incidence rate was 
0.54 per 100 person-years; 23 CVFs were reported (1.4% of 1651 individuals in these studies).
The BFA demonstrated rilpivirine resistance mutations (incidence rate ratio IRR=21.65, p<0.0001), 
HIV-1 subtype A6/A1 (IRR=12.87, p<0.0001), and body mass index IRR=1.09 per 1 unit increase, 
p=0.04; IRR=3.97 of ≥30 kg/m2, p=0.01) were associated with CVF. Other variables including Q4W 
or Q8W dosing, female gender, or CAB/INSTI resistance mutations had no significant association
with CVF. A combination of at least 2 of the following key baseline factors was associated with an
increased risk of CVF: rilpivirine resistance associated mutations, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, or BMI
≥ 30 kg/m2 (Table 12).

Oral bridging with other ART
In a retrospective analysis of pooled data from 3 clinical studies (FLAIR, ATLAS-2M, and LATTE-
2/study 200056), 29 subjects were included who received oral bridging for a median duration of 59 
days (25th and 75th percentile 53-135) with ART other than rilpivirine plus cabotegravir (alternative 
oral bridging) during treatment with REKAMBYS plus cabotegravir long-acting (LA) intramuscular 
(IM) injections. The median age of subjects was 32 years, 14% were female, 31% were non-white,
97% received an integrase inhibitor (INI)-based regimen for alternative oral bridging, 41% received an 
NNRTI as part of their alternative oral bridging regimen (including rilpivirine in 11/12 cases) and 62% 
received an NRTI. Three subjects withdrew during oral bridging or shortly following oral bridging for 
non-safety reasons. The majority (≥96%) of subjects maintained virologic suppression (plasma HIV-1 
RNA <50 c/mL). During bridging with alternative oral bridging and during the period following 
alternative oral bridging (up to 2 REKAMBYS plus cabotegravir injections following oral bridging), 
no cases of CVF (confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥200 c/mL) were observed.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
REKAMBYS injection in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of HIV-1 
infection.

Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetic properties of REKAMBYS have been evaluated in healthy and HIV-1 infected 
adults.

For oral rilpivirine, Ctau represents observed pooled data FLAIR, ATLAS and ATLAS-2M, AUC(0-tau) and Cmax
represent pharmacokinetic data from oral rilpivirine Phase 3 studies
d When administered with oral lead-in, initial injection Cmax primarily reflects oral dosing because the initial injection 
was administered on the same day as the last oral dose. When administered without oral lead-in (direct to injection, 
n=110), the rilpivirine observed geometric mean (5th, 95th percentile) Cmax (1 week post initial injection) was 
68.0 ng/mL (27.5, 220) and the Ctau was 48.9 ng/mL (17.7, 138).
e Week 48 data.
Absorption
Rilpivirine prolonged-release injection exhibits absorption rate-limited kinetics (i.e., flip-flop
pharmacokinetics) resulting from slow absorption from the gluteal muscle into the systemic circulation 
resulting in sustained rilpivirine plasma concentrations.
Following a single intramuscular dose, rilpivirine plasma concentrations are detectable the first day 
and gradually rise to reach maximum plasma concentrations after a median of 3-4 days. Rilpivirine has 
been detected in plasma up to 52 weeks or longer after administration of a single dose of 
REKAMBYS. After 1 year of monthly or every 2 months injections, approximately 80% of the 
rilpivirine pharmacokinetic steady-state exposure is reached.
Plasma rilpivirine exposure increases in proportion or slightly less than in proportion to dose following 
single and repeat IM injections of doses ranging from 300 to 1200 mg.
Distribution
Rilpivirine is approximately 99.7% bound to plasma proteins in vitro, primarily to albumin. Based on 
population pharmacokinetics analysis, the typical apparent volume of the central compartment (Vc/F) 
for rilpivirine after IM administration was estimated to be 132 L, reflecting a moderate distribution to 
peripheral tissues.
Rilpivirine is present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In HIV-1-infected subjects receiving a regimen of 
rilpivirine injection plus cabotegravir injection, the median rilpivirine CSF to plasma concentration 
ratio (n=16) was 1.07 to 1.32% (range: not quantifiable to 1.69%). Consistent with therapeutic 
rilpivirine concentrations in the CSF, CSF HIV-1 RNA (n=16) was < 50 c/mL in 100% and < 2 c/mL 
in 15/16 (94%) of subjects. At the same time point, plasma HIV-1 RNA (n=18) was < 50 c/mL in 
100% and < 2 c/mL in 12/18 (66.7%) of subjects.
Biotransformation
In vitro experiments indicate that rilpivirine primarily undergoes oxidative metabolism mediated by 
the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A system.
Elimination
The mean apparent half-life of rilpivirine following REKAMBYS administration is absorption
rate-limited and was estimated to be 13-28 weeks.
The apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) of rilpivirine was estimated to be 5.08 L/h.
22
After single dose administration of oral 14C-rilpivirine, on average 85% and 6.1% of the radioactivity 
could be retrieved in faeces and urine, respectively. In faeces, unchanged rilpivirine accounted for on 
average 25% of the administered dose. Only trace amounts of unchanged rilpivirine (< 1% of dose) 
were detected in urine.
Special patient populations
Gender
No clinically relevant differences in the rilpivirine exposure after intramuscular (IM) administration 
have been observed between men and women.
Race
No clinically relevant effect of race on the rilpivirine exposure after intramuscular administration has 
been observed.
BMI
No clinically relevant effect of BMI on the rilpivirine exposure after intramuscular administration has 
been observed.
Elderly
No clinically relevant effect of age on the rilpivirine exposure after intramuscular administration has 
been observed. Pharmacokinetic data for rilpivirine in subjects of > 65 years old are limited.
Renal impairment
The pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency. Renal 
elimination of rilpivirine is negligible. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease,
REKAMBYS should be used with caution, as plasma concentrations may be increased due to 
alteration of drug absorption, distribution and/or metabolism secondary to renal dysfunction. In 
patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease, the combination of REKAMBYS 
with a strong CYP3A inhibitor should only be used if the benefit outweighs the risk. As rilpivirine is 
highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis 
or peritoneal dialysis (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment
Rilpivirine is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. In a study comparing 8 patients with 
mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score A) to 8 matched controls, and 8 patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score B) to 8 matched controls, the multiple dose exposure of oral 
rilpivirine was 47% higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 5% higher in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment. However, it may not be excluded that the pharmacologically active, 
unbound, rilpivirine exposure is significantly increased in moderate hepatic impairment. No dose 
adjustment is suggested but caution is advised in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
REKAMBYS has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score C). 
Therefore, REKAMBYS is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see 
section 4.2).
HBV/HCV Co-infected Patients
Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection had no 
clinically relevant effect on the rilpivirine exposure after oral rilpivirine intake.
Paediatric Patients
The phamacokinetics of rilpivirine in children and adolescents aged < 18 years have not been 
established with REKAMBYS.
23
5.3
Preclinical safety data
All studies were performed with rilpivirine for oral use except for the studies on local tolerance with 
REKAMBYS injections.
Repeated dose toxicity
Liver toxicity associated with liver enzyme induction was observed in rodents. In dogs, 
cholestasis-like effects were noted.
Reproductive toxicology studies
Studies in animals have shown no evidence of relevant embryonic or foetal toxicity or an effect on 
reproductive function. There was no teratogenicity with oral rilpivirine in rats and rabbits. The 
exposures at the embryo-foetal No Observed Adverse Effects Levels (NOAELs) in rats and rabbits 
were respectively ≥ 12 times and ≥ 57 times the exposure in humans at the maximum recommended 
human daily dose of 25 mg once daily in HIV-1 infected patients or 600 mg or 900 mg intramuscular 
injection dose of rilpivirine long-acting injectable suspension.
Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis
Oral rilpivirine was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by oral gavage administration to mice and rats 
up to 104 weeks. At the lowest tested doses in the carcinogenicity studies, the systemic exposures 
(based on AUC) to rilpivirine were ≥ 17 times (mice) and ≥ 2 times (rats) the exposure in humans at 
the maximum recommended human daily dose of 25 mg once daily in HIV-1 infected patients or 
600 mg or 900 mg intramuscular injection dose of rilpivirine long-acting injectable suspension. In rats, 
there were no drug-related neoplasms. In mice, rilpivirine was positive for hepatocellular neoplasms in 
both males and females. The observed hepatocellular findings in mice may be rodent-specific.
Rilpivirine has tested negative in the absence and presence of a metabolic activation system in the 
in vitro Ames reverse mutation assay and the in vitro clastogenicity mouse lymphoma assay. 
Rilpivirine did not induce chromosomal damage in the in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Local tolerance for REKAMBYS
After long-term repeated IM administration of REKAMBYS in dogs and minipigs, slight, short-lasting 
(i.e., 1-4 days in minipigs) erythema was observed, and white deposits were noted at the injection sites 
at necropsy, accompanied by swelling and discolouration of draining lymph nodes. Microscopic 
examination showed macrophage infiltration and eosinophilic deposits at the injection sites. A 
macrophage infiltration response was also noted in the draining/regional lymph nodes. These findings 
were considered to be a reaction to the deposited material rather than a manifestation of local irritation.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What REKAMBYS is and what it is used for
REKAMBYS contains the active ingredient rilpivirine. It is one of a group of medicines called 
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) that are used for the treatment of human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.
REKAMBYS works together with other HIV medicines to block the ability of the virus to make more 
copies of itself. REKAMBYS injections do not cure HIV infection but help reduce the amount of HIV 
in your body and keeps it at a low level. This holds off damage to the immune system and the 
development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.
REKAMBYS is always given with another HIV medicine called cabotegravir injection. They are used
together in adults aged 18 years and older whose HIV-1 infection is already under control.
2. What you need to know before you use REKAMBYS
Do not use REKAMBYS if you are allergic to rilpivirine or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6).
Do not use REKAMBYS if you are taking any of the following medicines as they may affect the 
way REKAMBYS or the other medicine works:
-
carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines to treat epilepsy and 
prevent seizures)
rifabutin, rifampicin, rifapentine (medicines to treat some bacterial infections such as 
tuberculosis)
dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used in a variety of conditions such as inflammation and 
allergic reactions) as a course of treatment by mouth or injection
products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal remedy used for 
depression).
-
-
-
43
If you are taking any of the above, ask your doctor about alternatives.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using REKAMBYS.
REKAMBYS is not a cure for HIV infection. It is part of a treatment to reduce the amount of virus in 
the blood.
Tell your doctor about your situation
Check the following points and tell your doctor if any of them apply to you.
-
You must attend all the planned visits for injections, do not miss any visits, it is very important 
for the success of your treatment. If you cannot attend a planned visit, inform your doctor as 
soon as possible.
Tell your doctor if you have ever had problems with your liver, including hepatitis B or
hepatitis C, or problems with your kidneys. Your doctor may check how well your liver or 
kidneys work to decide if you can use REKAMBYS. See ‘Uncommon side effects’ in section 4 
of this leaflet for signs of liver damage.
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infections (for example, fever, 
chills, sweats). In some patients with HIV, inflammation from previous infections may occur 
soon after starting HIV treatment. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement 
in the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that were present 
previously but caused no obvious symptoms.
Also tell your doctor straight away if you notice any symptoms such as muscle weakness, 
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, 
palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity. This is because autoimmune disorders (conditions in 
which the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start
taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur 
many months after the start of treatment.
Tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines that you have been told may cause a 
life-threatening irregular heartbeat (torsade de pointes).
-

Reactions to Injections
Post-injection reaction symptoms have happened within minutes in some people after receiving their 
rilpivirine injection. Most symptoms resolved within a few minutes after the injection. Symptoms of 
post-injection reactions may include: difficulty breathing, stomach cramps, rash, sweating, numbness 
of your mouth, feeling anxious, feeling warm, feeling lightheaded or feeling like you are going to pass 
out (faint), blood pressure changes, and pain (e.g., back and chest). Tell your healthcare professional if 
you experience these symptoms after you receive your injections.
Regular appointments are important
It is important that you attend your planned appointments to receive REKAMBYS, to control your 
HIV infection and to stop your illness from getting worse. Do not miss any visits, it is very important 
for the success of your treatment. If you cannot attend a planned visit, inform your doctor as soon as 
possible. Talk to your doctor if you are thinking about stopping treatment. If you are late receiving 
your REKAMBYS injection, or if you stop receiving REKAMBYS, you will need to take other 
medicines to treat HIV infection and to reduce the risk of the virus becoming resistant as the drug 
levels in your body will be too low to treat the HIV infection.
Children
REKAMBYS is not for use in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age, because it has not 
been studied in these patients.
Other medicines and REKAMBYS
Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Some medicines may affect the levels of REKAMBYS in the blood if you are taking them while being 
treated with REKAMBYS, or REKAMBYS may affect how well the other medicine works.
44
REKAMBYS must not be given with some other medicines (see ‘Do not use REKAMBYS’ in 
section 2).
The effects of REKAMBYS or other medicines might change if you use REKAMBYS together 
with any of the following medicines:
-
-
clarithromycin, erythromycin (antibiotics)
methadone (used to treat narcotic withdrawal and dependence)
If you are taking any of the above, ask your doctor about alternatives.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant. Your doctor will 
consider the benefit and the risk to you and your baby of using REKAMBYS while you are pregnant. 
If you are planning to have a baby, talk to your doctor in advance, as rilpivirine can remain in your 
body for up to 4 years after the last injection of REKAMBYS.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Some patients may feel tired, dizzy or drowsy during treatment with REKAMBYS. Do not drive or 
operate machinery if you have any of these side effects.
Important information about some of the ingredients of REKAMBYS
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 2 mL injection, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
3.
How REKAMBYS is given
A nurse or doctor will give you REKAMBYS as an injection in the muscle of your buttock 
(intramuscular, or IM injection).
You will be given your injection either once every month or once every 2 months, together with 
another injectable medicine called cabotegravir. Your doctor will explain how often the medicine will 
be given.
When you start treatment with REKAMBYS, you and your doctor may decide to start with daily 
treatment of one 25 mg rilpivirine tablet with a meal and one 30 mg cabotegravir tablet for one month
before your first REKAMBYS injection. This is called the lead-in period - taking the tablets before 
you receive REKAMBYS and cabotegravir injections will allow your doctor to test how well these 
medicines suit you.
The other option is that you and your doctor may decide to start directly with REKAMBYS injections.
If you are going to be given REKAMBYS every month, your treatment will be as follows:
Medicine
Rilpivirine
Cabotegravir
First injection
single injection of 900 mg 
single injection of 600 mg
Second injection onwards, every month
600 mg by injection every month 
400 mg by injection every month
When
45
If you are going to be given REKAMBYS every 2 months, your treatment will be as follows:
Medicine
Rilpivirine
Cabotegravir
First and second injections, one 
month apart
single injection of 900 mg 
single injection of 600 mg 
Third injection onwards, every two 
months
900 mg by injection, every 2 months
600 mg by injection, every 2 months
When
If you miss a REKAMBYS injection
It is important that you keep your regular planned appointments to receive your injection. If you miss 
an appointment, contact your doctor immediately to make a new appointment.
Talk to your doctor if you think you will not be able to receive your REKAMBYS injection at the 
usual time. Your doctor may recommend you take tablets instead, until you are able to have a 
REKAMBYS injection again.
If you are given too much REKAMBYS
A doctor or nurse will give this medicine to you, so it is unlikely that you will be given too much. If 
you are worried, tell the doctor or nurse.
Don’t stop using REKAMBYS without advice from your doctor.
Use REKAMBYS for as long as your doctor recommends. Don’t stop unless your doctor advises you 
to.
Low levels of rilpivirine (the active ingredient of REKAMBYS) can remain in your body for up to 
4 years after stopping treatment. However, once you received your last REKAMBYS injection, the 
low levels of rilpivirine that remain will not work well enough against the virus which then can 
become resistant. To keep your HIV-1 infection under control and to stop the virus becoming resistant, 
you must start a different HIV treatment by the time your next REKAMBYS injection was planned.

How long can the medicine be left out of the refrigerator?
Questions and Answers
1.
It is best to inject the medicine as soon as it reaches room temperature. However, the vial may sit in the 
carton at room temperature (maximum temperature of 25°C) for up to 6 hours; do not put back into the 
refrigerator. If not used within 6 hours, the vial must be discarded.
How long can the medicine be left in the syringe?
2.
It is best to inject the (room temperature) medicine as soon as possible after drawing it up. However, the 
medicine can remain in the syringe for up to 2 hours before injecting.
If 2 hours are exceeded, the medicine, syringe and needle must be discarded.
3. Why do I need to inject air into the vial?
Injecting 1 mL of air into the vial makes it easier to draw up the dose into the syringe. Without the air, 
some liquid may flow back into the vial unintentionally, leaving less than intended in the syringe.
Does the order in which I give the medicines matter?
4.
No, the order is unimportant.
Is it safe to warm the vial up to room temperature more quickly?
5.
It is best to let the vial come to room temperature naturally. However, you can use the warmth of your 
hands to speed up the warm up time, but make sure the vial does not get above 25°C.
Do not use any other heating methods.
6. Why is the ventrogluteal administration approach recommended?
The ventrogluteal approach, into the gluteus medius muscle, is recommended because it is located away 
from major nerves and blood vessels. A dorso-gluteal approach, into the gluteus maximus muscle, is 
acceptable, if preferred by the healthcare professional. The injection should not be administered in any 
other site.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What REKAMBYS is and what it is used for
REKAMBYS contains the active ingredient rilpivirine. It is one of a group of medicines called 
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) that are used for the treatment of human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.
REKAMBYS works together with other HIV medicines to block the ability of the virus to make more 
copies of itself. REKAMBYS injections do not cure HIV infection but help reduce the amount of HIV 
in your body and keeps it at a low level. This holds off damage to the immune system and the 
development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.
REKAMBYS is always given with another HIV medicine called cabotegravir injection. They are used 
together in adults aged 18 years and older whose HIV-1 infection is already under control.
2. What you need to know before you use REKAMBYS
Do not use REKAMBYS if you are allergic to rilpivirine or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6).
Do not use REKAMBYS if you are taking any of the following medicines as they may affect the 
way REKAMBYS or the other medicine works:
-
carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines to treat epilepsy and 
prevent seizures)
rifabutin, rifampicin, rifapentine (medicines to treat some bacterial infections such as 
tuberculosis)
dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used in a variety of conditions such as inflammation and 
allergic reactions) as a course of treatment by mouth or injection
products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal remedy used for 
depression).
-
-
-
60
If you are taking any of the above, ask your doctor about alternatives.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using REKAMBYS.
REKAMBYS is not a cure for HIV infection. It is part of a treatment to reduce the amount of virus in 
the blood.
Tell your doctor about your situation
Check the following points and tell your doctor if any of them apply to you.
-
You must attend all the planned visits for injections, do not miss any visits, it is very important 
for the success of your treatment. If you cannot attend a planned visit, inform your doctor as 
soon as possible.
Tell your doctor if you have ever had problems with your liver, including hepatitis B or
hepatitis C, or problems with your kidneys. Your doctor may check how well your liver or 
kidneys work to decide if you can use REKAMBYS. See ‘Uncommon side effects’ in section 4 
of this leaflet for signs of liver damage.
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infections (for example, fever, 
chills, sweats). In some patients with HIV, inflammation from previous infections may occur 
soon after starting HIV treatment. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement 
in the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that were present 
previously but caused no obvious symptoms.
Also tell your doctor straight away if you notice any symptoms such as muscle weakness, 
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, 
palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity. This is because autoimmune disorders (conditions in 
which the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start 
taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur 
many months after the start of treatment.
Tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines that you have been told may cause a 
life-threatening irregular heartbeat (torsade de pointes).

Reactions to Injections
Post-injection reaction symptoms have happened within minutes in some people after receiving their 
rilpivirine injection. Most symptoms resolved within a few minutes after the injection. Symptoms of 
post-injection reactions may include: difficulty breathing, stomach cramps, rash, sweating, numbness 
of your mouth, feeling anxious, feeling warm, feeling lightheaded or feeling like you are going to pass 
out (faint), blood pressure changes, and pain (e.g., back and chest). Tell your healthcare professional if 
you experience these symptoms after you receive your injections.
Regular appointments are important
It is important that you attend your planned appointments to receive REKAMBYS, to control your 
HIV infection and to stop your illness from getting worse. Do not miss any visits, it is very important 
for the success of your treatment. If you cannot attend a planned visit, inform your doctor as soon as 
possible. Talk to your doctor if you are thinking about stopping treatment. If you are late receiving 
your REKAMBYS injection, or if you stop receiving REKAMBYS, you will need to take other 
medicines to treat HIV infection and to reduce the risk of the virus becoming resistant as the drug 
levels in your body will be too low to treat the HIV infection.
Children
REKAMBYS is not for use in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age, because it has not 
been studied in these patients.
Other medicines and REKAMBYS
Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Some medicines may affect the levels of REKAMBYS in the blood if you are taking them while being 
treated with REKAMBYS, or REKAMBYS may affect how well the other medicine works.
61
REKAMBYS must not be given with some other medicines (see ‘Do not use REKAMBYS’ in 
section 2).
The effects of REKAMBYS or other medicines might change if you use REKAMBYS together 
with any of the following medicines:
-
-
clarithromycin, erythromycin (antibiotics)
methadone (used to treat narcotic withdrawal and dependence)
If you are taking any of the above, ask your doctor about alternatives.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant. Your doctor will 
consider the benefit and the risk to you and your baby of using REKAMBYS while you are pregnant. 
If you are planning to have a baby, talk to your doctor in advance, as rilpivirine can remain in your 
body for up to 4 years after the last injection of REKAMBYS.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Some patients may feel tired, dizzy or drowsy during treatment with REKAMBYS. Do not drive or 
operate machinery if you have any of these side effects.
Important information about some of the ingredients of REKAMBYS
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 3 mL injection, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
3.
How REKAMBYS is given
A nurse or doctor will give you REKAMBYS as an injection in the muscle of your buttock 
(intramuscular, or IM injection).
You will be given your injection either once every month or once every 2 months, together with 
another injectable medicine called cabotegravir. Your doctor will explain how often the medicine will 
be given.
When you start treatment with REKAMBYS, you and your doctor may decide to start with daily 
treatment of one 25 mg rilpivirine tablet with a meal and one 30 mg cabotegravir tablet for one month
before your first REKAMBYS injection. This is called the lead-in period - taking the tablets before 
you receive REKAMBYS and cabotegravir injections will allow your doctor to test how well these 
medicines suit you.
The other option is that you and your doctor may decide to start directly with REKAMBYS injections.
If you are going to be given REKAMBYS every month, your treatment will be as follows:
Medicine
Rilpivirine
Cabotegravir
First injection
single injection of 900 mg 
single injection of 600 mg
Second injection onwards, every month
600 mg by injection every month 
400 mg by injection every month
When
62
If you are going to be given REKAMBYS every 2 months, your treatment will be as follows:
Medicine
Rilpivirine
Cabotegravir
First and second injections, one 
month apart
single injection of 900 mg 
single injection of 600 mg 
Third injection onwards, every two 
months
900 mg by injection, every 2 months
600 mg by injection, every 2 months
When
If you miss a REKAMBYS injection
It is important that you keep your regular planned appointments to receive your injection. If you miss 
an appointment, contact your doctor immediately to make a new appointment.
Talk to your doctor if you think you will not be able to receive your REKAMBYS injection at the 
usual time. Your doctor may recommend you take tablets instead, until you are able to have a 
REKAMBYS injection again.
If you are given too much REKAMBYS
A doctor or nurse will give this medicine to you, so it is unlikely that you will be given too much. If 
you are worried, tell the doctor or nurse.
Don’t stop using REKAMBYS without advice from your doctor.
Use REKAMBYS for as long as your doctor recommends. Don’t stop unless your doctor advises you 
to.
Low levels of rilpivirine (the active ingredient of REKAMBYS) can remain in your body for up to 
4 years after stopping treatment. However, once you received your last REKAMBYS injection, the 
low levels of rilpivirine that remain will not work well enough against the virus which then can 
become resistant. To keep your HIV-1 infection under control and to stop the virus becoming resistant, 
you must start a different HIV treatment by the time your next REKAMBYS injection was planned.

How long can the medicine be left out of the refrigerator?
Questions and Answers
1.
It is best to inject the medicine as soon as it reaches room temperature. However, the vial may sit in the 
carton at room temperature (maximum temperature of 25°C) for up to 6 hours; do not put back into the 
refrigerator. If not used within 6 hours, the vial must be discarded.
How long can the medicine be left in the syringe?
2.
It is best to inject the (room temperature) medicine as soon as possible after drawing it up. However, the 
medicine can remain in the syringe for up to 2 hours before injecting.
If 2 hours are exceeded, the medicine, syringe and needle must be discarded.
3. Why do I need to inject air into the vial?
Injecting 1 mL of air into the vial makes it easier to draw up the dose into the syringe. Without the air, 
some liquid may flow back into the vial unintentionally, leaving less than intended in the syringe.
Does the order in which I give the medicines matter?
4.
No, the order is unimportant.
Is it safe to warm the vial up to room temperature more quickly?
5.
It is best to let the vial come to room temperature naturally. However, you can use the warmth of your 
hands to speed up the warm up time, but make sure the vial does not get above 25°C.
Do not use any other heating methods.
6. Why is the ventrogluteal administration approach recommended?
75
The ventrogluteal approach, into the gluteus medius muscle, is recommended because it is located away 
from major nerves and blood vessels. A dorso-gluteal approach, into the gluteus maximus muscle, is 
acceptable, if preferred by the healthcare professional. The injection should not be administered in any 
other site.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) which represents 
approximately 6% of all new NHL cases per year. The estimated incidence of MCL is below 1 case per 
100,000 persons throughout the world and was 0.45 cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42, 0.48) per 
100,000 persons in an assessment of 44 cancer registries in Europe during the period from 2000 to 2002. 
The incidence of MCL increases with age, with the highest incidence observed in the 70 to 79 years age 
group (Morton 2006). 
There is no curative therapy for MCL with the rare exception of patients who achieve long-term, 
disease-free survival after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Among patients who relapse, 
median life expectancy is only 1 to 2 years following salvage therapies, which are often associated with 
significant toxicities. In the EU, temsirolimus is the only approved treatment for relapsed or refractory 
MCL. Lenalidomide was recently approved in the US for relapsed and refractory MCL.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a progressive hematologic disease characterized by an 
accumulation of monoclonal mature B cells in the blood, bone marrow, and secondary lymph organs, and 
diagnosis requires the presence of ≥5000 B-lymphocytes/µL in the peripheral blood for the duration of at 
least 3 months. It is the most common form of adult leukemia in the Western world, with an incidence of 
4 per 100,000 persons per year. The median age of diagnosis in the EU is 72 years and only 10% of 
patients are less than 55 years old. The current WHO classification system recognizes and groups CLL and 
small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) as the same biological entity, with CLL clinically manifesting primarily 
in bone marrow and peripheral blood, and SLL primarily manifesting in the lymph nodes.  
Current treatments for CLL are not curative. Fewer patients obtain responses with each subsequent 
regimen, and subjects become increasingly resistant to available therapy. Patients who relapse after a 
disease-free period of over 1 year (2-3 years for chemoimmunotherapy) are considered treatment 
sensitive and may be candidates for treatment reinitiation. Patients who relapse after a shorter interval, 
or are refractory to first-line treatment, or who harbour CLL cells with del17p present a more challenging 
group, particularly those who are older, have comorbid conditions, and/or harbor high-risk cytogenic 
abnormalities. A retrospective analysis of patients in the German CLL8 trial found that overall survival 
after the start of salvage treatment among patients whose disease had progressed within 2 years after 
the end of chemoimmunotherapy was about 2 years, comparable to that of truly refractory patients. 
Patients with the del(17p) chromosomal abnormality represent a high risk group of CLL. According to the 
ESMO guidelines, there is no standard treatment for these patients, who have a median life expectancy of 
2–3 years from front-line treatment. While only a small minority of CLL patients will have detectable 
del(17p) at the time of diagnosis, the proportion increases with successive chemotherapy treatments, so 
that in the relapsed setting up to 30% to 50% of patients have del(17p). 
The monoclonal antibody ofatumumab, is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of CLL in the 
refractory setting as a single agent. The combination of the monoclonal antibody rituximab with 
chemotherapy (eg, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) (FCR regimen) is approved in the EU for use in 
this setting. Marketing authorization for alemtuzumab, which had been indicated for the treatment of CLL 
in patients for whom fludarabine combination chemotherapy is not appropriate, was withdrawn in the EU 
in August 2012. 
About the product 
Ibrutinib is a potent, small molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). Ibrutinib forms a covalent 
bond with a cysteine residue (Cys 481) in the BTK active site, leading to sustained inhibition of BTK 
enzymatic activity. BTK, a member of the Tec kinase family, is an important signalling molecule of the B 
cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. The BCR pathway is implicated in the 
pathogenesis of several B cell malignancies, including MCL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 
follicular lymphoma, and CLL. BTK’s pivotal role in signalling through the B cell surface receptors results 
in activation of pathways necessary for B cell trafficking, chemotaxis and adhesion (see SmPC section 
5.1). Ibrutinib is being developed for the treatment of various hematological malignancies. This 
application was seeking approval for ibrutinib in MCL and CLL/SLL. 
The sponsor applied for the following indication: 
- 
- 
for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 
for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) or for patients with CLL/SLL

The final indication following CHMP review of this application is (see SmPC, section 4.1):  
- 
- 
IMBRUVICA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell 
lymphoma (MCL). 
IMBRUVICA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line in the presence of 17p deletion 
or TP53 mutation in patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy.  
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
medicinal products. 
Imbruvica is presented as a hard capsule containing 140 mg of ibrutinib. The recommended dose for the 
treatment of MCL is 560 mg (four capsules) once daily. 
The recommended dose for the treatment of CLL is 420 mg (three capsules) once daily.

Page 11/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as hard capsule containing 140 mg of ibrutinib as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium 
laurilsulfate, gelatin and titanium dioxide (E171) for the capsule shell, shellac, iron oxide black (E172) and 
propylene glycol for the printing ink. 
The product is available in HDPE bottles with a child resistant polypropylene closure. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of ibrutinib is 
1-{(3R)-3-[4-amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-1-yl]piperidin-1-yl}prop-2-en-
1-one and its molecular formula is C25H24N6O2. It has the following structure: 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white to off-white solid which is practically insoluble in aqueous 
solutions of pH 4.5-8 and slightly soluble in HCl at pH 1.2. Ibrutinib is practically insoluble in non-polar 
solvents such as hexane and heptanes, sparingly soluble in ethyl acetate, ethanol and acetonitrile, soluble 
in acetone and methanol and freely soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran and 
dichloromethane.  
Based on the solubility characteristics and in vitro permeability experiments, the applicant designated 
ibrutinib as a BCS Class 2 compound (low solubility and high permeability). 
Ibrutinib has one chiral centre and the absolute stereochemistry of the drug substance was determined by 
single crystal X-ray crystallography as R. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC. 
Polymorphism was observed, three polymorphic forms of ibrutinib were identified and one of them which 
is the most thermodynamically stable is consistently formed during the active substance manufacturing 
process and used in the manufacturing of the finished product.  
Chemical structure of ibrutinib was elucidated using the following techniques: elemental analysis, 
ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy (UV), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), proton and 
carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR and 13C NMR), and mass spectrometry (MS).

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Ibrutinib is manufactured in 6 main steps using commercially available well defined starting materials  
with acceptable specifications. The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of 
conventional univariate studies and elements of QbD such as risk assessment. A criticality analysis was 
conducted to determine the critical quality attributes (CQA) of the active substance. The active substance 
synthesis process was evaluated, step by step, for its impact on the CQAs of ibrutinib. An overview of the 
control strategy for the drug substance has been provided in which critical control points (CCPs) are 
identified for each active substance CQA. A CCP can be a process parameter (PP), an in-process control 
(IPC) or a critical material attribute (CMA) of a process material. Adequate in-process controls are applied 
during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials 
and reagents have been presented. Proven acceptable ranges have been defined for several steps. The 
available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale 
batches fully support the proposed PARs. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), heavy metals (ICP-MS), and residue on 
ignition/sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), particle size (laser diffraction analysis), crystal form (DSC). 
Impurities present at higher level than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data are provided from about 30 batches of active substance used for non-clinical, clinical, 
stability, pre-process validation and process validation studies. Five batches are production scale batches. 
Twenty-two of the batches were manufactured according to the proposed process. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturing sites 
stored in the intended commercial package for 12 months under long term conditions at 2-8 ºC, 25 ºC / 
60% RH, 30 ºC / 75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
In addition, stability data on three supportive registration stability batches were provided. These pilot 
batches were mainly produced by the proposed commercial manufacturing sites according to the 
proposed manufacturing process. The batches were stored in the intended commercial package for 12-24  
months under long term conditions at 2-8 ºC, 25 ºC / 60% RH, for 12 months at 30 ºC / 65% RH and for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. 
The parameters tested are the same as for release. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating.

A forced degradation study has been conducted on one batch of the drug substance. Ibrutinib was 
subjected to the following conditions: acid (0.1 N HCl / 1 week 60 ˚C) , alkaline (0.1 N NaOH / 1 week 60 
˚C), oxidative (30% H2O2  / 5 hours 60˚C) and thermal stress (in suspension 1 week  at 60 ˚C; in solid 
state 2 week at 60 ˚C). 
A photolysis study on the solid substance was also performed with harsher conditions than ICH 
conditions. Stressed and non-stressed samples were analysed for degradation products with the related 
substances method and also by LC/Q-TOF mass spectrometry to determine the mass or m/z for the 
degradation products found.  
The forced degradation studies revealed that ibrutinib is sensitive to acid, alkaline and oxidative stress 
conditions. The drug substance was stable with respect to heat and light. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier(s) is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
A capsule formulation was selected as the oral solid dosage form due to ease of administration and high 
patient compliance. The limited solubility of ibrutinib in aqueous media has been one challenge in the 
efforts to obtain an orally bioavailable formulation and the formulation optimization approach has mainly 
focussed on enhancement of dissolution rate and solubility.  The effect of different surfactants and 
micronization of the active substance on rate of absorption were evaluated in a pilot pharmaco-kinetic dog 
study comprising different formulations. Based on the results from this study the particle size of the active 
substance and the type and amount of surfactant to be used for further development were selected. 
Excipient compatibility was evaluated on selected mixtures of standard pharmaceutical excipients used in 
immediate-release solid oral dosage forms combined with ibrutinib. The pharmaceutical grade excipients 
were combined in a 1:1 ratio and held at 40 °C or 60 °C for 4 weeks. Based upon the findings from this 
study, excipients were selected. Different formulations have been used during clinical development. The 
modifications allowed for scale up and automation of the capsule filling process. In addition a change in 
the capsule colour has been introduced after completion of clinical studies  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The commercial process was developed through design of experiments and characterization of the 
process during clinical, registration and process scale-up manufacturing. 
The manufacturing development was evaluated through the use of risk assessment and design of 
experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical process parameters. The risk 
identification was based on the prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing 
processes as well as on the experience from formulation development, process design and scale-up 
studies. The critical process parameters were adequately identified. 
The bioequivalence of the clinical formulation and the proposed commercial formulation is claimed based 
on an overall evaluation of the PK, efficacy/ safety, difference in formulations, dissolution profiles, all 
quality attributes and manufacturing process. A bioequivalence study was not performed. Results for 
Cmax and AUC obtained for the different formulations during individual clinical studies were evaluated,

dissolution profiles compared and overall conclusion is presented claiming that the modification of 
formulations did not have an impact on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy data.      
The proposed QC dissolution method is considered suitable for quality control of the finished product.   
The primary packaging is HDPE bottles with a child resistant polypropylene closure. The material complies 
with EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and 
is adequate for the intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps including different blending steps, dry granulation, 
milling, encapsulation and packaging. In process controls are described and are considered adequate for 
this type of manufacturing process.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process were validated based on manufacture of three consecutive 
full-scale batches. The validation report was not enclosed. The process validation scheme is presented. 
The absence of validation report was considered satisfactory taking into account manufacturing process 
development data provided and the fact that the process is considered to be a standard manufacturing 
process. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form visual 
appearance, identification by LC retention time and UV/VIS spectrometry, assay (HPLC or UPLC), 
degradation products (HPLC), content uniformity (Ph Eur), water content (Karl Fischer), dissolution and 
microbiological quality (Ph Eur). The same specifications apply at release and during shelf-life although 
identity of ibrutinib and content uniformity are tested only at release. The analytical methods used in the 
control of the drug product have been well described and satisfactorily validated according to ICH 
guidance.   
Batch analysis results are provided for three production scale batches as well as for primary and 
supportive registration batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three pilot batches of finished product  stored under long term conditions for 12 months 
at 25 ºC / 60% RH and 30 ºC / 75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 
75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Imbruvica are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Stability data from long term (25˚C/60% RH) and accelerated (40˚C/75% RH) conditions are also 
provided for three supportive pilot scale product batches representative of the commercial formulation. 
Six months accelerated data are reported for the supportive batches together with up to 24 months of 
long term results. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, water content, dissolution, microbial 
limits, chiral impurity, crystal form. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. 
For the primary registration stability batches, the data are all within proposed specifications and no large 
trends are seen. A small increase in degradation products is noted at the accelerated condition.  
All results from the supportive batches are within acceptance criteria and no significant changes are 
observed although some increase in degradation products is seen.

The product has been shown stable against light exposure. Also, it has been shown that no change in 
polymorph of the drug substance occurs upon storage. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture is provided. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The ibrutinib drug substance has low solubility in aqueous media in the physiological pH range. The 
particle size of the substance has impact on the bioavailability and a micronized quality of ibrutinib is used 
in the drug product. For several of the specified drug related impurities of both the drug substance and 
drug product the specifications are above the ICH qualification limits. The proposed limits have been 
toxicologically qualified. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active 
substance and finished product and their manufacturing process, however no design spaces were claimed 
for the manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished product. Information on 
development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented 
in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.4.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.5.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical testing strategy was designed to demonstrate and characterize the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics/toxicokinetics, and toxicology of ibrutinib. All pivotal toxicology / toxicokinetics studies 
were conducted according to the GLP principles. 
CHMP advice was sought by the Applicant on the overall non-clinical program for ibrutinib mainly with 
regard to the extent of the non-clinical program in order to support MAA and the use of the ICH S9 and 
ICH S8 Immunotoxicity for ibrutinib non-clinical development.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Ibrutinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) that targets the ATP binding 
domain of BTK and forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue (Cys-481) in the binding pocket that 
leads to sustained inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity.  
BTK, is a critical component of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signalling pathway, and has a 
well-established role in B lymphocytes (B cell) development. The generation and maintenance of (B-cells), 
both normally and in many B-cell malignancies, is controlled by biochemical signals transmitted by the 
BCR. Upon antigen engagement of the BCR, Btk is activated by the upstream Src-family kinases such as 
Lyn and Fyn (Afar 1996; Cheng 1994) and Btk in turn phosphorylates and activates Phospholipase-Cγ 
(PLCγ) (Humphries 2004), leading to Ca++ mobilization and activation of the oncogenic pathways MAPK, 
AKT, and NF-kB (Figure 1).  
Figure 1.  Activation of Btk Upon Antigen Engagement of the BCR 
BCR = B cell antigen receptor; Btk = Bruton’s kinase. 
BTK’s pivotal role in signalling through BCR results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell 
activation/proliferation and development. In addition,. Activation of the BCR and chemokine-receptor 
signalling pathways is important for B-cell trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. Ibrutinib binds 
covalently to a cysteine residue (Cys-481) near the Btk active site and inhibits Btk activity with a half 
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.5 nM (Honigberg 2010; Pan 2007). Covalent binding of 
ibrutinib to Cys-481 results in irreversible inhibition of Btk.  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies  
In order to characterize the selectivity and sensitivity of ibrutinib and its metabolite PCI -45227, an 
active-site dependent competition-binding assay as an initial screen was performed with a broad array of 
human kinases. Ibrutinib was most potent against Btk (IC50 = 0.39 nM). Inhibition of Btk was irreversible 
due to the formation of a stable covalent bond between ibrutinib with a specific cysteine residue 
(Cys-481) in the  ATP binding pocket of Btk. Ibrutinib inhibited 9 other kinases with a similarly positioned 
cysteine in the active site: ErbB4/HER 4, Blk, Bmx/Etk, Txk), Tec, EGFR, ErbB2/HER2, JAK3 and Itk. 
Ibrutinib also reversibly inhibited Src-family kinases Fgr, Lck, and Yes/YES1. The PCI-45227 metabolite 
was determined to also inhibit Btk approximately 15 times less than the parent compound and is more 
selective for Btk inhibition relative to other kinases.

In the MCL cell line Mino, ibrutinib inhibited both auto-phosphorylation (pY223) and 
trans-phosphorylation (pY551) of Btk and the phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins PLCγ2, 
Akt, Erk, and Jnk following stimulation with anti-IgM or with the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13. In 
normal human CD19+ B cells and in human primary MCL cells, 100 nM ibrutinib completely inhibited auto- 
and transphosphorylation of Btk and significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of PLCγ2.  
Inhibition of B-Cell Activation was studied in human CD20+ B cells stimulated by BCR engagement with 
an anti-IgM antibody, continuous exposure to ibrutinib for 18 h at 10 nM completely prevented 
up-regulation of the early lymphocyte activation marker CD69. The effect of ibrutinib was studied in 
Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). Growth inhibition was evaluated in MCL cell lines Mino, JVM-2, 
Rec-1, Jeko-1, Granta-519, and Maver-1 exposed in culture to ibrutinib for 3 days at various 
concentrations. It was found that ibrutinib inhibits the proliferation of cell lines derived from DLBCL 
patients and MCL cell lines. The effect of ibrutinib on the proliferation of CLL cells was examined by 
measuring DNA incorporation of 3H-thymidine in isolated human CLL cells co-cultured with nurse-like 
stromal cells (NLCs). 
Cellular assays were used to evaluate the effects of ibrutinib on proliferation, adhesion, and migration in 
B cell tumour cell lines. Btk has been shown to be expressed and constitutively active in primary MCL cells 
and in MCL cell lines (Ponader et al., 2011).  
In follicular lymphoma cells (DOHH2), ibrutinib inhibited phosphorylation of PLCγ with an IC50 of 20 nM 
and  the  phosphorylation  of  Erk  with  an  IC50  of  15  nM.  100  nM  ibrutinib  completely  inhibited 
phosphorylation of Btk and PLCγ2 in normal human B-cells and human primary MCL cells (Mino cells).  
Binding and inhibition of B-cell activation by ibrutinib (10 nM for 18h) resulted in complete prevention of 
up-regulation of the early lymphocyte activation marker CD69. A 1-hour washout of ibrutinib under these 
conditions  did  not  change  the  activity  of  ibrutinib  or  affect  the  cell  viability,  suggesting  irreversible 
mechanism of action by ibrutinib.  
Relative levels of ibrutinib binding to Btk were measured using a specific active site-directed fluorescent 
probe linked to ibrutinib. Pre-incubation with ibrutinib effectively blocked probe binding to Btk and was 
used to determine ibrutinib concentration versus Btk occupancy profiles in mononuclear cells in human 
whole blood, and this was compared to the profile of ibrutinib-mediated inhibition of anti-IgM induced 
B-cell activation, as measured by CD69 up-regulation. 200 nM ibrutinib resulted in nearly complete (90%) 
occupancy of Btk in mononuclear blood cells, and this concentration led to approximately a 50% inhibition 
of CD69 expression in B cells. 
Ibrutinib  (10  nM  for  18  h)  completely  and  irreversibly  prevented  up-regulation  of  CD69  in  B-cells.  A 
site-directed  fluorescent  probe  linked  to  ibrutinib  demonstrated  near  complete  occupancy  of  Btk  by 
ibrutinib (200 nM) in mononuclear cells from human blood, a concentration which led to ~ 50% inhibition 
of  CD69  expression  in  B-cells.  Ibrutinib  inhibited  the  growth  of  ABC-subtype  of  diffuse  large  B  cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10)), in which “chronic active” BCR signalling is believed to be 
of important to the survival of ABC-DLBCL cells. Ibrutinib inhibited cell proliferations of ABC-DLBCL cell 
lines TMD8 and Ly10 with an EC50 of  1-10nM.  
Ibrutinib reduced proliferation of CLL cells in a concentration-dependent manner tested by measuring 
DNA incorporation of 3H-thymidine in isolated human CLL cells co-cultured with nurse-like stromal cells.  
Cell growth inhibition by ibrutinib (3 days incubation) was evaluated in various MCL cell lines. Mino cells 
were found to be the most sensitive cell type, in which Ibrutinib at concentrations of ≥ 100 nM inhibited 
cell growth by 50% or more.  
CHMP assessment report

In  continuously  cultured  Mino  Cells  (MCL),  resistance  towards  ibrutinib  at  low,  but  increasing  drug 
concentrations was demonstrated. The resistance is stably maintained in Mino cells for up to 16 days after 
drug withdrawal.  
The interaction of neoplastic B cells with stromal cells in the microenvironment plays a critical role in the 
progression  of  various  B-cell  malignancies  including  mantle  cell  lymphoma  (MCL).  The  homing  and 
trafficking of B cells is tightly controlled and regulated by the interaction of chemokine receptors (e.g. 
CXCR4)  and  adhesion  molecules  (integrins).  In  addition,  BCR  signaling  within  lymphoid  tissues 
contributes to the control of homing and adhesion. 
100 nM ibrutinib significantly inhibited (20-70%) adhesion of lymphoma (Jeko1, HBL2 and Mino) cells 
onto fibronectin or VCAM-1. In addition, ibrutinib inhibited the movement of MCL cell lines in a chemotaxis 
migration assay, the Mino and Jeko1 cells being most sensitive at ibrutinib concentrations of ≥ 0.1 nM. 
Ibrutinib concentration-dependently inhibits BCR- and chemokine-mediated adhesion and migration in 
MCL cell lines.  
In vivo studies 
Splenocytes harvested from BALB/c mice were found to exhibit complete Btk occupancy after dosing of 5 
mg/kg ibrutinib via IV or IP routes and nearly complete occupancy after PO dosing and at 50 mg/kg for all 
three dosing routes, complete Btk occupancy by ibrutinib was found, which was also noted at 3 hours 
after dosing of ≥ 1 mg/kg and ≥ 10 mg/kg ibrutinib (SC and PO, respectively). In tumour-bearing mice, 
oral delivery of ibrutinib resulted in reduced proliferation of Mino cells, TCL1-192 cells, OCI-Ly10 cells, or 
TMD8 cells. Maximal suppression of cell proliferation occurred at doses of 12 to 25 mg/kg/day.  
In the TCL1 adoptive transfer model, when treatment with ibrutinib started 2 weeks after CLL cell 
transfer, lymphocytosis was observed followed by a reduction of circulating lymphocyte counts. In this 
model, mice treated with ibrutinib had significantly smaller livers and spleens with reduced leukemic 
infiltration.  
Oral administration of ibrutinib to 8 companion dogs with spontaneous B-cell lymphoma resulted in a 
partial tumour response in 3 dogs and stable disease in another 3 dogs. Full Btk active-site occupancy was 
achieved in the PBMCs of dogs at dose levels ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day. 
Mino (mantle cell lymphoma) cell-bearing and naïve CB17 SCID mice received medicated feed containing 
ibrutinib or vehicle ad libitum at an estimated dose level of 0 (vehicle) or 12 mg/kg/day for 70 consecutive 
days. FACS analysis of bone marrow, PBMC and lymph node preparations showed substantively lower 
numbers of hCD19+ Mino cells in tissues/preparations from ibrutinib-treated mice in comparison to 
tissues/preparations from vehicle-control mice. The differences were statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05) for 
collective lymph nodes but not for bone marrow or PBMCs.  
TCL1-192 cells were intravenously injected into the CLL Model CB17 SCID mice which were subsequently 
given drinking water containing ibrutinib at a concentration of either 0.016 or 0.16 mg/mL or drinking 
water containing vehicle alone. After 1 week of treatment, lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood of 
mice in the 2.5 or 25 mg/kg/day groups were lower than those of the vehicle controls. After 2 weeks of 
treatment, lymphocyte counts in the high-dose group animals remained lower than in the controls.  
Ibrutinib or vehicle only was administered to OCI-Ly10 (DLBCL) and to TMD8 (DLBCL) tumour 
cell-bearing female CB17 SCID mice once daily by oral gavage at a dose level of 0 (vehicle), 3 or 12 
mg/kg/day. Mice were treated in cycles consisting of 5 consecutive days of dosing followed by 2 days 
without dosing for a total of 39 days. Tumour volumes in the 3 and 12 mg/kg/day dose groups were 
significantly smaller than in the vehicle controls on treatment days 10 through 39.

Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Studies on the inhibition of release of mediators from human basophils activated in vitro, efficacy 
response in a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model, blockade of anaphylaxis response in a murine 
model of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and inhibition of auto-antibody production and the development 
of kidney disease in the MRL/lpr murine lupus model, have been submitted.   
In a report by MacGlaschan et al, ibrutinib inhibited the release of mediators from human basophils 
activated in vitro. After stimulation with anti- IgE, ibrutinib inhibited CD63 antigen expression, histamine, 
leukotriene C4, and interleukin 4 secretion/release with an IC50 of 3 to 6 nM(data not shown). 
The ability of orally administered ibrutinib to inhibit progression of type II collagen-induced arthritis was 
shown in male DBA/1OlaHsd mice (data not shown). 
Oral administration of ibrutinib at 12.5 or 50 mg/kg resulted in a significant inhibition of anaphylaxis 
response in dermal tissues of sensitized mice. These results were confirmed in a subsequent passive 
cutaneous anaphylaxis study at ibrutinib dose levels of 6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg (data not shown). 
In a murine model of lupus nephritis, eight-week-old female mice (MRL/MpJ-Tnfrsf6lpr/J) were dosed 
with ibrutinib at dose levels of 0 (vehicle), 3.13, 12.5, and 50 mg/kg/day. Significant inhibition of urine 
protein levels, as compared to vehicle controls, was seen in mice at each dose level of ibrutinib. Reduction 
of summed histopathology scores was nearly significant for mice dosed at 50 mg/kg/day (P = 0.06). 
Serum double stranded DNA antibody levels were significantly reduced for animals dosed at 12.5 mg/kg 
(45% decrease; data not shown). 
Safety pharmacology  
Ibrutinib was evaluated in vitro for its ability to bind to 67 different targets. The target most inhibited by 
ibrutinib in these tests was the dopamine transporter (IC50 = 484 nM or 213 ng/mL). The IC50 for 
inhibition of dopamine transporter is 48 times the estimated mean steady state Cmax of unbound 
ibrutinib in patients (560 mg/day).  
Ibrutinib did not have effects on the respiratory and central nervous systems of rats. 
Ibrutinib inhibited hERG channel at a concentration 96 times the average maximum steady-state plasma 
concentration of unbound ibrutinib in patients. PCI-45227 inhibited hERG channel at a concentration 415 
times the average maximum steady-state plasma concentration in patients. Based on these exposure 
margins, neither ibrutinib nor PCI-45227 is expected to adversely affect ventricular repolarization in 
humans.  
Beagle dogs administered single oral doses were evaluated for potential cardiovascular effects of 
ibrutinib. Prolongation of RR interval, lowered heart rate, and increased blood pressure were noted at 
dose levels of 24 and 150 mg/kg. In addition, prolonged PR intervals and shortened QTCV intervals were 
noted at the 150 mg/kg dose level. The NOEL for oral administration of ibrutinib to dogs was set at 1.5 
mg/kg (HED = 0.81 mg/kg). The changes in blood pressure, heart rate and RR interval noted at 24 mg/kg 
were not considered to be adverse.

In the 4- and 13-week dog studies increased RR interval was significantly increased in females (30 
mg/kg/day, 1 hour after treatment in the first week) and heart rate was decreased (though 
non-significantly). The cardiovascular findings in the dog studies are considered clinically relevant, as 
similar changes are found in the clinical studies. The applicant has added relevant information in the 
SmPC regarding cardiovascular safety. The applicant is not able to establish etiology for the occurrence of 
the observed cardiovascular changes in both dog and humans the proposal to include additional 
information regarding cardiovascular safety in the SmPC is accepted. 
Safety pharmacology studies have been conducted in receptor-ligand binding assays, in patch clamped 
HEK293 cells transfected with hERG, in female rats for CNS and respiratory evaluations and in dog for 
analysis of cardiovascular effects (Table 1).

2.3.2.1.  Potential Anti-proliferative Drug Interactions in Lymphoma Cell Lines 
Ibrutinib as a single agent or in combination with fludarabine, doxorubicin, vincristine or dexamethasone 
was added to 96 well plates containing one of eight lymphoma cell lines (DB, Granta-519, DHL-4, DLCL2, 
Ly19, DOHH2, RAMOS and Jurkat) and incubated for 72 h. Cell viability was determined by AlamarBlue 
assay. In DLCL2 and DHL-4 cells, co-incubation with dexamethasone enhanced the inhibitory effect of 
ibrutinib on cell proliferation. In Ramos and DOHH2 cells, dexamethasone appeared to exhibit an additive 
effect when co-incubated with ibrutinib. In Ly19 cells, the combination of ibrutinib with any of the 4 
chemotherapeutic agents exhibited a mild antagonistic effect. Dexamethasone did not enhance or inhibit 
the effect of ibrutinib in the Jurkat, Granta-519, or DB cell lines. Doxorubicin, fludarabine, and vincristine 
did not exhibit synergistic or antagonistic effects when studied in combination with ibrutinib in the DLCL2, 
DHL4, RAMOS, Jurkat, Granta-519, DB or DoHH2 cell lines. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Studies have been performed to characterise the absorption, pharmacokinetics, distribution, metabolism 
and excretion of ibrutinib in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and in vitro. Studies related to the pivotal toxicity 
testing were conducted under GLP, whereas all other pharmacokinetic studies are non-GLP studies.  
During the development program, analysis of ibrutinib and its metabolite PCI-45227 in plasma samples 
from nonclinical PK and TK studies was performed at various laboratories using liquid chromatography 
coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). 
Carbon radiolabeled ibrutinib was synthesized as [14C]-ibrutinib (R-enantiomer), , or as a racemic 
mixture containing [14C]-ibrutinib (R-enantiomer) and [14C]-PCI-32769 (S-enantiomer) for drug 
metabolism and PK studies. 
2.4.  Absorption  
Preclinical investigations to define the PK of ibrutinib were conducted in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs 
administered test compound by the oral or intravenous route and in mice and rats administered ibrutinib 
by the intraperitoneal or subcutaneous route.  
After oral administration, ibrutinib exhibited rapid absorption in preclinical species. The mean Tmax of 
ibrutinib generally occurred within 2 h post-dose regardless of the formulation or feeding status.  Ibrutinib 
is a high clearance compound in mice, rats and dogs with a moderate volume of distribution at 
steady-state. The mean terminal half-life of ibrutinib following oral administration ranged from 0.98 h in 
rats to 6.4 h in dogs. After oral dosing with ibrutinib, relevant levels of the PCI-45227 metabolite can be 
measured in the plasma of rats and dogs.

Findings 
Ibrutinib in the presence of NADPH was highly cleared in 
microsomes from all species. The rate of intrinsic clearance ± 
SE measured as μL/min/mg protein was: cynomolgus monkey 
= 629 ± 80.2; rat = 596 ± 60.9; human = 549 ± 68.8; dog 107 
± 5.47. The half-lives in minutes were: monkey = 2.20; rat = 
2.33; human = 2.52; dog = 13.0. 
Microsomes: In rat, dog and human, approximately 
90%, 51% and 66% was metabolized after a 10 
min incubation. In rabbit microsomes, 21% of was metabolised 
after 10 min. 
Hepatocytes: In rat and rabbit, approximately 87% and 98%, 
respectively, was metabolized after 60 min incubation. In dog 
and human hepatocytes, metabolism was somewhat slower, 
72% and 70%, respectively. Data over metabolites is found in 
table 17B.  
Metabolite M19 was a major source of circulating radioactivity 
in the plasma and accounted for 23.69% of the sample 
radioactivity at 1 hour postdose. In urine, 
dihydrodiol-PCI-31532 represented 12.75% of the sample 
radioactivity for the 0- to 8-hour collection interval. M20 was 
the major metabolite in feces and accounted for 8.71% of the 
radioactive dose. M21 was the major metabolite in urine with 
22.53% of the radioactivity in the sample collected from 0 to 8 
hours postdose and 0.97% of the total radioactive dose 
through 24 hours. 
Two main metabolites were identified in faeces: M35 and M17. 
The hydroxylation on the phenyl (M35) give rise to M11, M16, 
M17, M18, M19, M21, M22, M28, M35 and M36, which 
represent just under half of the administered radioactive dose 
for male and female rats. Metabolites that can be linked to the 
piperidine ring opening pathway are: M11, M17, M18, M24, 
M25, and M29, and M34, which represent just under 20% of the 
administered radioactive dose for male and female rats. M37, 
M19 and M24 adding up to just under 10% of the administered 
radioactive dose for male and female rats. Metabolites 
identified in rat plasma (male and female) using the standard 
approach were M15, M34, M35, M37, M39, M40 and unchanged 
drug.  
Bile; No parent compound, < 5% dose was M21 representing 
7.85% of the dose, 2-5% were M6+M7, M9, M12+M13.  
Faeces; 1.1% parent compound, ≥5% were M17, M34, M35, 
2-5% were M19, M28, M36.  
Urine; In the first 24h of urine collection, 1.15% of the 
administered radioactive dose was recovered. No unchanged 
drug was observed in urine. All detected metabolites less than 
1% of the administered dose.   
In faeces, ibrutinib represented approximately 1.43 to 3.49 % 
of the administered dose. In urine, all peaks represented less 
than 1% of the administered dose.  
Feaces metabolites; >5%; M35, M17, M21 
Main plasma metabolites; M37, M34, M35, M31, M21 
Faeces; The unchanged drug represented on average 0.77 % 
of the administered dose.  
Urine; M37, M34, M33 and M32, M29, M25, M24, M21, M20, 
M17, M10 and M7 were identified (5% of the administered dose 
total). 
Plasma and blood; M21, M25 (10% at 2h), M34 (14% at 2h), 
M37 (10% at 2h) (low amounts of M39 and M40).  
In plasma M23, M30, M1 and M4 were observed. In blood, M1 
was not observed.    
Feces; unchanged ibrutinib (<1% of the administered dose), 
M11, M17, M20, M24, M25, M29, M34, M36 and M37 (2-9% of

Ibrutinib was extensively metabolized when administered orally to rats and dog. In total 41 metabolites 
were identified. The main circulating entities in humans were M21, M25, M34, PCI-45227 (dihydrodiol), 
and unchanged drug. Systemic exposure to the active metabolite PCI-45227 (based on AUC) in patients 
and healthy volunteers was comparable to that of ibrutinib.  
the administered dose)  
2.6.  Excretion 
In rats, dogs and humans, excretion of ibrutinib-related radioactivity occurred principally via feces. In 
rats, dogs and humans, low amounts of unchanged ibrutinib are excreted in the feces after oral 
administration. Biliary excretion was found as the route of elimination of [14C]-ibrutinib-derived 
radioactivity.

In addition, a dose escalating study  was performed in dogs, with SC and  PO  (gavage) administration 
(Study 06-015-SC-PO-TXE). In this non-GLP study, 10, 100 and 200 mg/kg were administered orally by 
gavage,  and  10,  20  and  40  mg/kg  was  administered  by  SC  injection.  Both  solution  and  suspension 
formulations were administered orally by gavage. Body weights, clinical signs were recorded, and blood 
samples for clinical pathology and toxicokinetics were collected. Following SC administration, ibrutinib 
appeared to be a local irritant which manifested as clinical reactions (e.g., scratching of the injection site, 
squirming  during  SC  administration).  In  this  study  it  was  concluded  that  the  solution  formulation  of 
ibrutinib was better absorbed than the suspension formulation. The maximum tolerated dose of ibrutinib 
following  single  oral  administration  was  200  mg/kg,  whereas  following  repeated  oral  dosing  for  6 
consecutive days, 60 mg/kg/day was tolerated.

Carcinogenicity studies have not been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development studies with ibrutinib have not been submitted (see Discussion 
on non-clinical aspects). However, an assessment of potential effects on female and male fertility based 
on the histopathology findings in repeat dose  toxicity studies has been performed (see repeat-dose 
toxicity section above). In rat and dog toxicity studies up to 92 days in duration, there were no treatment 
effects observed on reproductive tissues. 
The following studies were performed on embryo/fetal development: 
-  An Oral (Gavage) Dose Range-Finding Study of PCI-32765 on Embryo/Fetal Development in Rats 
(10-063-R-PO-TTE, non-GLP) 
-  An Oral (Gavage) Embryo/Foetal Development Study of PCI-32765 in Rats (11-132-R-PO-TT, 
GLP) 
-  An Oral (Gavage) Dose Range-Finding Study of the Effects of PCI-32765 on Embryo/Fetal 
Development in Rabbits (10-064-B-PO-TTE, non-GLP)

Maternal and foetal toxicity was observed in the rat studies, including decreased maternal and foetal 
weight and early resorbtions.  In the 80 mg/kg/day group, a higher overall incidence of visceral 
malformations were observed that consisted of dextrocardia, retroesophageal aortic arch, persistent 
truncus arteriosus, and a right-sided aortic arch. In addition, skeletal developmental variations were 
noted in the 80 mg/kg/day group. The treatment-related visceral malformations were considered to be of 
similar developmental origin (all involved the heart and major blood vessels).  Body weight losses and 
reductions in food consumption were noted in the dams in the non-GLP rabbit study; A high litter 
proportion of post-implantation loss and lower fetal weights were noted in the high dose group, however, 
no external foetal malformations or developmental variations were noted.

Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity  
As part of the 13-week toxicology study in rat immunephenotyping was analysed in blood samples 
collected. The data show a treatment-related shift in the percentage of T cells and B cells with a lower 
percentage of B cells and a resultant higher percentage of total T cells and natural killer cells in the 
peripheral blood. No dedicated studies on metabolites are presented.  
The applicant has additionally performed a functional immunotoxicity study in rat. The immune function 
data show that ibrutinib in a dose-dependent manner can inhibit TDAR responses and reversibly decrease 
total IgG concentrations following KLH injection. Such immune function toxicities are consistent with the 
pharmacologic mode of action, the data indicate recovery after cessation and the findings were not raising 
any concern.  
Phototoxicity 
Based on an evaluation of UV spectrum, photostability, and whole animal distribution data, the risk for 
phototoxic reactions in humans exposed orally to ibrutinib is considered minimal. While the UV absorption 
spectrum extends at a low level to 330 nm, the absorption maxima are seen at 259 and 287 nm, which are 
outside the 290-700 nm range of the electromagnetic spectrum that is associated with possible 
phototoxicity. Absorption above 290 nm is minimal, representing only 9% of the total absorption at 
wavelengths between 200 and 800 nm. Further, a photo stress study of ibrutinib using xenon lamp 
exposure for 4 days at rigorous conditions (27 times ICH guideline Q1B specified exposure of 1.2 million 
lux per hour) showed that ibrutinib was generally stable under this exposure condition, with 
approximately 2% degradation.  
An in vitro phototoxicity assay in Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts by determining the relative reduction in 
viability (reduction in Neutral Red uptake) of cells exposed to the test article in the presence or absence 
of UV irradiation was completed which showed no phototoxic potential for ibrutinib.

Whole-body autoradiography data from pigmented rats dosed orally with radiolabeled 14C-Ibrutinib 
indicate small amount of test article or metabolites distributes into the pigmented and non-pigmented 
skin and the eye structures;  14C-ibrutinib distributes to the skin and eye of rats and the signal is above 
detection level in the skin also after 336 h. No accumulation in skin has been detected. See discussion on 
Clinical Safety      
Impurities 
Structures of actual impurities found at or above the ICH reporting threshold of 0.05% in at least 1 
manufactured batch of ibrutinib at release or during stability testing were established based on mass 
spectrometry and/or NMR analyses. Structures of potential impurities reasonably expected to reside in 
ibrutinib based on theoretical considerations were also established. A total of 22 actual or potential 
impurities were identified. The potential of impurities to have mutagenic activity was assessed. All 
impurities were classified as non-mutagenic.

2.6.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
CHMP advice was sought by the Applicant on non-clinical program for ibrutinib mainly with regard to the 
extent of the non-clinical program, on immunotoxicity for ibrutinib non-clinical development. Further 
points raised by the CHMP concerned the characterization of the metabolite PCI-45227, the evaluation of 
the chiral conversion PCI-32765 - PCI-32769; potential concern with corneal dystrophy observed in dogs; 
risk of phototoxicity; The CHMP Scientific Advice has been followed by the Applicant.

Ibrutinib binds covalently to a cysteine residue (Cys-481) in the active site of Btk and inhibits the 
enzymatic activity of purified Btk with a median IC50 of 0.39 nM. Among the potential irreversibly 
inhibited non-Btk protein kinases, ErbB4/HER4, Blk, Bmx/Etk, Txk, and Tec are the most likely to be 
affected based on sensitivity to ibrutinib in biochemical assays. In vitro studies have shown that Btk 
inhibition effectively suppresses activity in BCR and chemokine-receptor signaling pathways. Ibrutinib, 
via Btk inhibition, impairs integrin-dependent, BCR-mediated adhesion and chemokine mediated 
adhesion and migration in both MCL and CLL cells (See section 5.1 of the SmPC). Inhibition of B-Cell 
Activation was studied in human CD20+ B cells stimulated by BCR engagement with an anti-IgM 
antibody, continuous exposure to ibrutinib for 18 h at 10 nM completely prevented up-regulation of the 
early lymphocyte activation marker CD69. A 1-hour (pulse) exposure did not change the activity of 
ibrutinib in the CD69 assay at 18 h post-treatment, a result consistent with an irreversible mechanism of 
action. 
In murine non-clinical models of B-cell malignancies (MCL, CLL and DLBCL), ibrutinib has demonstrated 
maximal efficacy at doses consistent with ≥90% Btk active site occupancy in spleen and tumour cells. 
Orally administered ibrutinib resulted in objective clinical responses in dogs that spontaneously developed 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Btk occupancy has been determined in mouse, rat and dog. Sequence homology 
data which show that Btk is very conserved in all species as compared to human (98-99%), and although 
homology in the binding residues has not been confirmed, given the compiled data on pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics, toxicity and the sequence homology the actual binding data against the Btk target and 
potential off-target kinases are considered relevant.  
In the TCL1 adoptive transfer model, when treatment with ibrutinib started 2 weeks after CLL cell 
transfer, lymphocytosis was observed followed by a reduction of circulating lymphocyte counts. In this 
model, mice treated with ibrutinib had significantly smaller livers and spleens with reduced leukemic 
infiltration. These in vivo data, supported by anti-proliferative effects shown in co-cultured primary CLL 
cells, suggests that ibrutinib has a dual effect of 1) inhibiting leukemia cell migration and tissue 
retention/homing and 2) decreasing CLL cell survival and proliferation. 
The IC50 values for inhibitory effect of ibrutinib and the dihydrodiol metabolite PCI-45227 on hERG 
channel current (427 and 4555 ng/mL, respectively) are 96 and 415 times the respective average 
maximum unbound plasma concentrations at steady-state in human subjects receiving a dose of 560 
mg/day, indicating a low risk for effects on ventricular repolarization in humans.  
In dog studies RR interval was significantly increased. The aetiology of these cardiovascular findings is not 
established. The ibrutinib exposure in the dog studies are similar or below the clinical exposure. Off-target 
kinase-effect of ibrutinib is deemed unlikely, but there are no other likely explanations for the observed 
changes. The cardiovascular findings in the dog studies are considered clinically relevant, as similar 
changes are found in the clinical studies. Additional information has been included in the SmPC regarding 
cardiovascular safety (see SmPC section 4.4 and discussion on clinical safety).   
Ibrutinib was rapidly absorbed following oral administration in laboratory animal species, a finding 
consistent with the pharmacokinetic profile in humans. 41 metabolites were identified. After oral dosing 
with ibrutinib, substantial levels of the dihydrodiol metabolite PCI-45227 can be measured in the plasma 
of rats, dogs, and humans. Covalent binding was observed in plasma obtained from rats, dogs and 
humans after oral dosing with [14C]-ibrutinib as a single enantiomer. In rats, dogs and humans, 
excretion of ibrutinib-related radioactivity occurred principally via faeces. It is not known whether 
ibrutinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast feeding infants cannot be 
excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment (See SmPC section 4.6).

Pivotal 13-week nonclinical toxicology studies were performed in rats and dogs administered ibrutinib 
once daily. In rats the following histopathologic changes were identified in target organs/tissues: 
lymphoid depletion in the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus; edema and squamous epithelial atrophy in 
the non-glandular stomach; inflammation in the intestines, acinar atrophy in the pancreas; and thinning 
of cortical bone with fewer primary trabeculae. The primary toxicologic target in dogs dosed for 4 or 13 
weeks was the intestinal tract (inflammation). Additional histopathologic changes noted in dogs dosed for 
13 weeks included lymphoid depletion of Peyer’s patches and smooth muscle degeneration of the 
stomach. In both rats and dogs, treatment-related soft feces and/or diarrhoea were a consistent clinical 
finding. In rats, red material around the nose was often observed and considered possibly related to 
epistaxis.  
Most signals were completely or partly resolved after recovery indicating no permanently induced injury. 
Partial or incomplete recovery in the pancreas acinar atrophy found in rat was associated with fibrosis, 
deposition of brown pigment consistent with hemosiderin, and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate and 
pre-disposition of this species, consequently the risk for pancreas related toxicity in humans is considered 
low. Corneal dystrophy found in the 4 week dog study at exposure margin greater than 2.3-fold based on 
NOAEL; no corneal findings were detected in rat; it can be concluded that there is a low risk to patients 
developing corneal dystrophy. Ocular safety was given special attention on the clinical trials (See also 
Discussion on Clinical Safety. 
Ibrutinib exposure levels not eliciting target organ toxicity in laboratory animals were generally higher 
than or comparable to exposure levels in human subjects.  
While several target organs were identified, the specific mechanisms of toxicity are not known. However, 
considering the pharmacodynamic reversible and irreversible binding to off-target kinases ErbB4/HER4, 
ErbB2/HER2, JAK3, Blk, Bmx/Etk, Tkx, Tec, EGFR, Itk, Fgr, Lck, and Yes/YES1 expanded toxicity at high 
doses could be expected. For instance it is not unlikely that the GI effects are due to ErbB4/HER4 binding 
and the liver signals could potentially be attributed to Tec binding.  
In the submitted studies, it can be concluded that ibrutinb has no genotoxic properties.  
Studies on the carcinogenic potential of ibrutinib have not been submitted. Carcinogenicity studies are in 
general not required to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced 
cancer. However, considering that life expectancy may be relatively long in some of these patients, in this 
particular case, there is a further need for carcinogenicty studies for Ibrutinib (see RMP). The applicant 
will conduct a transgenic mouse carcinogenicity study to address this concern (See also Discussion on 
Clinical safety, RMP). 
In rat and dog toxicity studies up to 92 days in duration, there were no treatment effects observed on 
reproductive tissues. No male or female fertility studies have been conducted (see SmPC section 5.3). 
The lack of dedicated fertility and early embryonic development studies is acceptable in accordance with 
the ICH S9 guide line as generally, no fertility study is warranted to support the treatment in patients with 
late-stage disease, also confirmed by the CHMP within the Scientific Advice procedure.

Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see SmPC section 4.6, 5.3) Ibrutinib caused 
malformations of the heart and major vessels in rat foetuses, and is therefore considered to be 
teratogenic. Based on findings in animals, IMBRUVICA may cause foetal harm when administered to 
pregnant women. Women should avoid becoming pregnant while taking IMBRUVICA and for up to 
3 months after ending treatment. Therefore, women of child-bearing potential must use highly effective 
contraceptive measures while taking IMBRUVICA and for three months after stopping treatment. This 
information is reflected in the SPC section (see SmPC section 4.6, 5.3) It is currently unknown whether 
ibrutinib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using hormonal 
contraceptives should add a barrier method. (See also discussion on Clinical Pharmacokinetics). 
Regarding male patients, restriction to father a child was not required since ibrutinib is neither genotoxic 
nor induces testis toxicity.  
Based on exposure at the 420 mg/day and 520 mg/kg/day clinical dose, animal-to-human Cmax ratios 
were 4.7/3.8 and 10.7/8.6 at the NOAEL in male and female rats, and 1.1/0.9 and 3.4/2.8 at the NOAEL 
in male and female dogs, respectively. The AUC ratios for exposure at the 420 mg/day and 520 
mg/kg/day clinical dose were 3.6/2.6 and 29/21 at the NOAEL in male and female rats, and were 0.6/0.4 
and 2.5/1.8 at the NOAEL in male and female dogs, respectively. Considering the indication and the 
pharmacological effect of ibrutinib the animal-human exposure is acceptable.  
Local tolerance studies have not been submitted. As the intended clinical route of administration is oral, 
and this route of administration has been employed in the toxicity studies, dedicated stand-alone local 
tolerance studies are not necessary. The local tolerance of ibrutinib has been assessed in the general 
toxicity studies. 
In rat a general treatment-related shift in the percentage of T cells and B cells with a lower percentage of 
B cells and a resultant higher percentage of total T cells and natural killer cells in the peripheral blood was 
recorded.  These findings are generally consistent with lymphoid atrophy noted microscopically in the 
lymph nodes and spleen of rats administered doses of 100 to 300 mg/kg/day. No functional 
immunotoxicity study has been performed. The effects on B-cell population are expected as the Bruton’s 
tyrosine kinase (Btk), the pharmacologic target of ibrutinib, is a critical component of the B cell antigen 
receptor-signalling pathway in B lymphocytes. 
Absorption above 290 nm was minimal, representing only 9% of the total absorption at wavelengths 
between 200 and 800 nm. Ibrutinib was also distributed to the skin of pigmented rats. (See also clinical 
safety discussion).  As in a 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake 186 Phototoxicity Test ibrutinib does not appear to 
have phototoxic properties, the skin toxicity signal is not considered to be related to light exposure.   
Six impurities are above the qualification thresholds, all of which have been qualified with fortified 
ibrutinib batches. The data show no additional toxicity in these studies. 
Ibrutinib and/or its metabolites are unlikely to represent a risk to the aquatic environment, sediment- or 
terrestrial compartment following prescribed usage in patients.     
2.6.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical documentation submitted was considered adequate. The relevant information 
has been included in the SmPC (sections 4.4, 4.6, 5.1, 5.3).   
The carcinogenicity of ibrutinib will be tested in a Transgenic (Tg) mouse range-finder study (to be 
submitted by 3Q 2015) followed by a Tg ras H2 6 month mouse carcinogenicity study (study report 1Q 
2018) as a non-clinical post authorisation measure. (See RMP).

2.7.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ibrutinib has been assessed in subjects with B-cell malignancies as well as 
in healthy subjects in 6 Phase I and 2 Phase II studies (Table 12). In addition, preliminary data from a 
study in non-cancer patients with hepatic impairment have been submitted. Also, the disposition of 
ibrutinib has been evaluated in a number of in vitro studies, including metabolism studies, CYP inhibition 
and induction studies and studies to evaluate permeability, P-gp transport, transporter inhibition, protein 
binding, blood-plasma ratio and covalent binding to off-target proteins.

The metabolite PCI-45227, binds to BTK in a reversible fashion with 1/15th of the affinity of ibrutinib. It 
has been quantified in laboratory animals and humans and its PK was investigated in most of the 
submitted in vivo and in vitro studies.  
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Standard statistical methods and non-compartmental methods were used to characterize the PK of 
ibrutinib. The population PK of ibrutinib was characterised by non-linear mixed effects modelling including 
data from the clinical studies in patients (study 04753, 1102-CA and 1104-CA). A physiologically based 
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was built and verified based on available clinical PK and DDI data for 
prediction of drug-drug interactions between ibrutinib and CYP3A inhibitors and inducers. 
In all the completed clinical pharmacology studies included in the submission, plasma concentrations of 
ibrutinib and the active metabolite (PCI-45227) were quantified using validated LC-MS/MS bioanalytical 
methods.  
Absorption  
Ibrutinib is slightly soluble in HCI at pH 1.2 and practically insoluble in the pH range 3-8 in aqueous media. 
High in vitro permeability for ibrutinib has been demonstrated in Caco-2 cells.  
Data on absolute bioavailability of ibrutinib initially indicated a bioavailability of approximately 4%, in line 
with preclinical, ketoconazole DDI study and human mass balance data that indicates that ibrutinib is 
completely absorbed and that absolute bioavailability, in fasted conditions, is less than 5% suggesting 
that the low bioavailability is mainly caused by extensive intestinal and hepatic first-pass. The clinical 
study report, PCI-32765CLL1011 was submitted at the request of the CHMP to further clarify the absolute 
bioavailability. 
Study 1011 was an open-label, single-center, sequential and 2-way crossover-designed fasted PK study 
to investigate the bioavailability of oral ibrutinib and the effect of grapefruit juice on the bioavailability of 
ibrutinib in eight healthy subjects. All subjects were orally administered 560 mg ibrutinib itself in fasted 
state, 560 mg ibrutinib 30 minutes after drinking orange juice/sugary drink in fed state and 140 mg 
ibrutinib 30 minutes after grapefruit juice in fed state. In addition, the subjects received a single IV dose 
of 100 µg 13C-ibrutinib 2 hours after each oral dose. 
Results: The mean oral and IV PK profiles without coadministration of juices or sugary drinks are 
presented in the figure below. After dose adjusting the IV tracer dose to the oral dose (560 mg) the 
bioavailability was 2.9 and 3.9% for AUClast and AUC∞ respectively.

Figure 2.   
Administration of the ibrutinib capsule as a single dose with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in 
exposure by approximately two fold compared to administration in the fasted state. Further evaluation of 
the effect of timing of food intake in relation to drug administration showed that ibrutinib AUCs were 
comparable regardless if drug administration took place 30 minutes before, 30 minutes after (fed), or 2 
hours after a high-fat breakfast. Food timing did however influence t max and Cmax, with the highest Cmax 
observed when subjects were dosed 2 hours after the meal. 
Administration of ibrutinib under fed conditions resulted in an increase in Cmax and AUClast with a 
geometric mean ratio of 3.15 and 1.86 compared to intake in fasted condition. When ibrutinib was 
administered either 30 minutes before or 2 hours after completing a high fat breakfast, the corresponding 
AUClast were within 2-fold (ratio 1.62 and 1.78 for 30 minutes before and 2 hours after, respectively) 
compared to intake in fasted condition. For Cmax, however, a significant difference was observed between 
30 minutes before and 2 hours after compared to intake in the fasted condition (table 13).  
Compared with fasted condition, PCI-45227 Cmax was 1.7-, 2.3-, and 2.9-fold higher when dosed 30 
minutes before, 30 minutes after, or 2 hours after a high-fat breakfast, respectively. AUClast was 1.5-, 
1.9, or 2.1-fold higher. Half-life was unchanged. No trend in metabolite-to-parent ratios was observed. 
When administering twice the dose in fed condition (E), Cmax and AUC were higher than those observed 
for the 420 mg dose (Treatment A), but the increase was less than 2-fold. The metabolite PCI-45227, 
however, did show dose-proportionality.

Distribution 
Based on the results from the population PK analysis, ibrutinib has an estimated apparent volume of 
distribution (Vd/F) of approximately 10 000 L which indicates extensive distribution to tissue. 
Ibrutinib exhibited high plasma protein binding in vitro (97.3%) without any concentration dependency in 
the studied range of concentrations (100-1000 ng/mL). The in vitro protein binding of the metabolite 
PCI-45227 was 91%.  
The blood-plasma ratio for ibrutinib was approximately 0.8 indicating that ibrutinib is not widely 
distributed to blood cells.  No determination of the blood/plasma concentration ratio for the metabolite 
was performed.  
Ibrutinib has been designed to bind covalently to the cysteine residue in the active site of the target 
kinase (BTK). Evaluation of the binding to off-target proteins showed greater affinity for liver S9 
compared to human plasma proteins or purified human albumin. The binding appears to be appreciably 
lower compared to target effects.  
In the human mass balance study, elimination of covalently bound radioactivity was slower than total 
radioactivity. Approximately 10% of Cmax and 27 % of AUC0-72 of total radioactivity in human plasma was 
accounted for by covalent binding following a single dose.

Elimination 
Mean recovery of total radioactivity in urine and faeces accounted for 7.8% and 80.6% of the dose, 
respectively. Negligible amounts of parent ibrutinib and a small amount of the active metabolite 
PCI-45227 were detected in urine and faeces. The remaining identified radioactivity in excreta was made 
up by a large number of metabolites. The sum of identified drug related material in excreta, corrected for 
recovery and column recovery, was 64.1% of the dose. Since almost no ibrutinib was detected in urine 
and faeces it can be concluded that ibrutinib is almost completely absorbed and that metabolism is the 
major elimination pathway. The totality of the submitted data indicates that ibrutinib has a low 
bioavailability mainly caused by extensive intestinal and hepatic first-pass metabolism. 
Ibrutinib is suggested to undergo a variety of biotransformations in vivo with three main primary 
metabolic clearance pathways. The drug interaction studies with ketoconazole and rifampin in 
combination with the in vitro metabolism data clearly indicate that CYP3A4 is responsible for the vast 
majority of ibrutinib elimination. 
The elimnation half-life of ibrutininb is 4-13 hours. 
Mean ibrutinib and PCI-45227 exposures together makes up less than 5% of the total radioactivity in 
blood and plasma. In addition, other identified metabolites also have a small individual contribution to the 
total radioactivity exposure and consequently the majority of blood and plasma radioactivity has not been 
identified. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
No indication for non-linearity in single and multiple dose data were observed under clinically relevant 
conditions. 
Ibrutinib and PCI-45227 accumulate to a small degree, approximately 1.5-times after repeated dosing as 
compared to single dose. This is in line with the observed half-life of ibrutinib in the range of 4-14 hours. 
No signs of time-dependent PK of ibrutinib are present. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The PK of Ibrutinib and PCI-45227 displays high inter-individual variability. For ibrutinib, CV% ranged 
from 58.5% to 136% for Cmax and 60.1% to 107% for AUC0-24h and for PCI-45227, CV% ranged from 48% 
to 64.9% for Cmax and from 40.6% to 61.8% for AUC0-24h. 
The main reason for the high inter-subject variability is believed to be caused by the biological variation 
in CYP3A expression, leading to pronounced CYP3A-mediated intestinal and hepatic first-pass extraction. 
Intra-subject mean variability for ibrutinib as measured in the food effect study (study 1002) in both fed 
and fasted subjects, ranged from 27% to 43% for AUC and Cmax, respectively.  
Population PK analysis 
An adequate predictive performance of the proposed model was demonstrated by prediction corrected 
visual predictive checks.The population PK of Imbruvica was described by a 2-compartment model with 
sequential zero-first order absorption, with an effect of food on absorption time and relative bioavailability 
and an allometric relationship for bodyweight implemented on the volume terms. The analysis suggested 
no significant effects of other covariates. Exceptions were the co-administration of ibrutinib with antacid 
drugs, which increased duration of the zero order absorption process by 61%. The analysis included PK 
information on ibrutinib obtained in subjects with different B-cell malignancies the phase I study 04753 
and the phase II studies 1102-CA and 1104-CA.

Special populations 
No formal study of the PK of ibrutinib in renal impairment has been conducted. The effect of creatinine 
clearance (Cockroft-Gault) in the range of mild (40.8 % of the patients CRCL ≥60 and <90 mL/min) and 
moderate renal impairment (21.2%, CRCL ≥60 and <90 mL/min) was evaluated in the population PK 
analysis. No influence of estimated creatinine clearance on the PK of ibrutinib was apparent. No data is 
available in severe renal impairment or in patients on dialysis. Since severe renal impairment might affect 
metabolism and hepatic transporters a clinical relevant effect of severe renal impairment on ibrutinib PK 
cannot be excluded. Treatment in severe renal impairment (less than 30 mL/min creatinine clearance) is 
thereby only recommended if the benefit outweighs the risk (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC).  
Subjects with hepatic impairment have been excluded from participation in clinical trials.  A study in 
non-cancer subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment has been conducted. Preliminary data has 
been submitted and a final report will be submitted as a post marketing commitment later in 2014. The 
preliminary data show a significant increase in ibrutinib exposure with increasing impairment, 4-, 8.2-, and 
9.1-fold higher AUClast in the mild, moderate, and severe cohort respectively. Terminal half-life trended 
slightly higher in moderately and severely impaired subjects. Fold increases taking into account the AUC 
of unbound drug were 4.0, 9.5, and 13 for the mild, moderate and severe impairment group, respectively. 
Based on the results, an initial reduced dose for patients with mild (280 mg) and moderate (140 mg) 
hepatic impairment is suggested. Treatment in severe hepatic impairment is not recommended (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC).

No subjects aged 65 or older participated in PK studies in healthy volunteers. The effect of weight, gender, 
race and age on the PK of ibrutinib was evaluated in the population PK analysis. Body weight (mean 82.7, 
SD 19.1 kg) was identified as a significant covariate on peripheral volumes (V2/F and V3/F). The effect of 
on body weight on apparent clearance was negligible. No a priori dose adjustment based on weight 
appears necessary.  
No statistically significant effects of gender (72.2 % male) or age (mean 53.3, SD 10.1 years) on the PK 
parameters were found. Limited data was available regarding the effect of race/ethnicity on ibrutinib PK 
and no conclusion on the effect of race on the PK can be drawn.  
No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib in paediatric patients. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The drug-drug interaction potential of ibrutinib was investigated in a number of in vitro and in vivo 
studies.

In vitro: Neither ibrutinib nor PCI-45227 are considered clinically relevant systemic inhibitors or inducers 
of CYP-enzymes. Ibrutinib is not a substrate of P-gp and OATPs in vitro. In contrast, ibrutinib is an in vitro 
P-gp inhibitor (see Discussion on clinical pharmacology below). 
In vivo: The CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole increased ibrutinib Cmax and AUC 29- and 24-fold, 
respectively, with no apparent effect on the ibrutinib half-life. The CYP inducer rifampin resulted in a 13- 
and 9- to 10-fold decrease in ibrutinib Cmax and AUC respectively with nearly unaffected half-life. These 
studies indicate that the interaction potential at CYP3A4 is mainly at the presystemic level. The results of 
the active metabolite PCI-45227 in the ketoconazole and rifampin study indicate that the further 
metabolism of PCI-45227 may also be governed by CYP3A4.  
A PBPK model was built based on the available preclinical and clinical information and the aim of the 
model was to investigate the drug-drug interaction potential of CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers on ibrutinib 
PK. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials. 
The applicant submitted a protein binding study of ibrutinib in human pre-dose plasma of subjects of the 
open-label pharmacokinetic study (PCI-32765CLL1002) in healthy male subjects. At a spiked total 
plasma concentration of 100 ng/mL, the unbound fraction of ibrutinib in plasma averaged 0.020 (2.0 % 
unbound), SD 0.002, range 0.017-0.025 (n=18; data not shown). 
Protein binding of Ibrutinib was also assessed in pre-dosed plasma from subjects of an open-label Phase 
1 Study to Determine the Absorption, Metabolism, and Routes of Excretion of ibrutinib in healthy male 
subjects. At a spiked total plasma concentration of 100 ng/mL, the unbound fraction of ibrutinib in plasma 
averaged 0.023 (2.3 % unbound), SD 0.003, range 0.020-0.026 (n=6; data not shown). 
2.7.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
See non-clinical aspects. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Study PCYC-04753 (See also Dose – Response section) 
Primary Pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib in study 04753 was determined by monitoring the BTK occupancy 
of the subjects’ PBMCs before and after treatment. The cohort in which >4 treated subjects demonstrated 
full occupancy of BTK (<5% remaining unoccupied BTK or below the lower limit of detection in the 
gel-based probe assay at 4 hours postdose) was defined as the “minimal occupying dose”. In the absence 
of DLT (≤1 DLT in a cohort), dose escalation proceeded through 3 dose levels beyond the “minimal 
occupying dose.” In the absence of DLT (≤1 DLT in a cohort), a “preferred occupying dose” was to be 
selected at the “minimal occupying dose” or one of subsequent higher dose levels based on assessment 
of other pharmacodynamic assays. Dose escalation was completed at that point.  
In an analysis of BTK occupancy for subjects in this study, full occupancy was observed beginning with the 
2.5 mg/kg/day cohort (“minimum occupying dose”). Therefore, the 12.5 mg/kg/day cohort (3 dose levels 
above 2.5 mg/kg/day) was the highest dose tested for dose escalation in this study. No subjects were 
enrolled into the 17.5 mg/kg/day cohort. Since no DLT was observed in the 12.5 mg/kg/day cohort and 
the MTD was not identified at this dose level on the intermittent schedule, 8.3 mg/kg/day (1 dose 
level below the 12.5 mg/kg/day dose level) was chosen as the “preferred occupying dose level”.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645137/2014  
Page 45/140 
 
 
 
 
 
After the “preferred occupying dose” was identified, 2 cohorts were added: Cohort C, which received 8.3 
mg/kg/day using a 35-day cycle with no rest period; and Cohort F, which received a fixed dose (560 
mg/dose) given once daily continuously. A final cohort (Cohort D) was then added for subjects with 
activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype DLBCL, which received 560 mg/day continuously. 
Figure 3.  BTK Occupancy of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (Percent) at 4 Hours and 
24 Hours After Ibrutinib Administration, by Dose Cohort 
In summary, the BTK occupancies for the 2.5 mg/kg/day to 12.5 mg/kg/day cohorts were all above 90% 
at either 4 or 24 hours after drug administration. The mean BTK occupancies of continued dosing cohorts 
CD-1 (8.3 mg/kg/day), CD-2 (560 mg/day), and CD-3 (560 mg/day DLBCL) at 4 hours were 92.39%, 
95.82%, and 97.79%, respectively; whereas the 24-hour occupancies were 93.36%, 94.18%, and 
97.32%, respectively. In all cohorts above 2.5 mg/kg/day (or 200 mg), for both weight-based (ie, mg/kg) 
dosing and fixed dosing (ie, continuous dosing of 560 mg/day), the mean BTK occupancies were above 
90% at 4 hours and 24 hours after drug administration. 
Effects on electrocardiogram (ECG) 
Results from formal ECG monitoring in 2 uncontrolled studies, study 04753 (n=45) and study 1102 
(n=124), are presented.  
In study 04753, a trend toward QTcB shortening was noted, especially in subjects receiving 12.5 
mg/kg/day and in those on continuous dosing schedule. There was no significant QTc prolongation (>500 
ms absolute value or >60 ms shift from baseline) was observed, and no evidence of QTcB prolongation 
with increasing plasma concentrations of ibrutinib ranging from 3.22 to 701 ng/mL in individual subjects 
was noted (non-significant negative slope of -0.0056 ms/ng/mL, p=0.5714). 
In uncontrolled Study 1102 in 124 patients  (described in Clinical Efficacy section) standard 12-lead ECGs 
were collected at several specified occasions during cycle 1 and at single specified occasions during 
further therapy and transmitted electronically to a central core lab. All ECGs were evaluated blindly by 
cardiologists for the presence of any clinically significant abnormalities. The study was not placebo 
controlled. 
QTcF intervals were shorter by 8.9 ms on average relative to baseline in Treatment Group 1 
(relapsed/refractory 420 mg, analysis set n=24), Treatment Group 2 (treatment-naïve 420 mg (elderly), 
n=23), and Treatment Group 3 (relapsed refractory 840 mg, n=34), and 7.5 ms on average for all groups 
combined,without evidence of dose-dependency. No such change was observed in Treatment Group 4 
(high risk relapsed/refractory 420 mg, n=22) and in Treatment Group 6 (relapsed refractory food effect 
cohort 420 mg, n=16). Mean QTcF interval shortening was 7.5ms, no value <340ms. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645137/2014  
Page 46/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Heart rate decreased by 6.8 beats per minute on average relative to baseline (screening) in both the 420 
mg and 840 mg dose groups. There was no evidence of clinically meaningful bradycardia (i.e., <50 beats 
per minute).  
PR interval duration was increased by 9.7 ms on average relative to baseline in both dose groups. There 
was no evidence of PR interval prolongation above 240 ms; a maximal value of PR interval of 242 ms was 
observed in one patient at one time-point only. 
There were no treatment related effects on QRS duration in any of the treatment groups.  
The exposure-response relationship between the plasma concentration of ibrutinib or PCI-45227 and 
change in QTcF and PR interval from baseline was conducted using a linear mixed effects modeling 
approach. The estimated slope of the linear mixed effect model was -0.0122 ms/ng/mL, which was 
statistically significant (p-value = 0.0002) indicating a decrease in QTcF by 1.2 ms with a 100 ng/mL 
increase in ibrutinib concentrations. Analysis of data for the metabolite PCI-45227 showed no evidence of 
QTcF prolongation with increasing PCI-45227 concentrations. The estimated population slope was 
-0.0197 ms/ng/ml with p < 0.0001 indicating a 2 ms decrease in QTcF per 100 ng/ml increase in 
PCI-45227 concentration. Similarly for PR, prolongation of 1.05 ms for each 100 ng/mL ibrutinib 
concentration increase was observed. The observed plasma concentrations of ibrutinib in CLL/SLL 
subjects dosed with 420 mg/day or 840 mg/day were in the range of 0 to 1170 ng/mL.  
2.7.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Ibrutinib has high permeability and low pH-dependent solubility. As such, the absorption of and 
subsequently the exposure of ibrutinib may be lowered by concomitant administrations of medicines that 
increase gastric pH (e.g. proton pump inhibitors), however population pharmacokinetic data and a 
subgroup efficacy analysis from the pivotal study 1112 (described in Clinical efficacy section) on patients 
with and without concomitant administration of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) indicate that a potential 
effect of increased gastric pH on ibrutinib PK is not clinically relevant. However, given that 
co-administration with PPIs is very common in the intended population and as a potential interaction 
could decrease efficacy this circumstantial evidence of a no-effect needs to be confirmed in a clinical study 
to evaluate the effect of a PPI on ibrutinib pharmacokinetics, which is requested post-approval (See RMP). 
Meanwhile, the information is included in the SmPC (under 4.5) until the study results are available. 
Ibrutinib is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a median T max of 1 to 2 hours. Absolute 
bioavailability in fasted condition (n = 8) was 2.9% (90% CI = 2.1 – 3.9) and doubled when combined 
with a meal. Pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib does not significantly differ in patients with different B-cell 
malignancies. Ibrutinib exposure increases with doses up to 840 mg. The steady state AUC observed in 
patients at 560 mg is (mean ± standard deviation) 953 ± 705 ng h/mL. Administration of ibrutinib in 
fasted condition resulted in approximately 60% of exposure (AUClast) as compared to either 30 minutes 
before, 30 minutes after (fed condition) or 2 hours after a high fat breakfast. The information is included 
in the SmPC and it is recommended that Imbruvica is taken at the same time every day without regard to 
meals.  
Reversible binding of ibrutinib to human plasma protein in vitro was 97.3% with no concentration 
dependence in the range of 50 to 1,000 ng/mL. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state 
(Vd, ss/F) was approximately 10,000 L. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645137/2014  
Page 47/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ibrutinib is metabolised primarily by, CYP3A4 to produce a dihydrodiol metabolite with an inhibitory 
activity towards BTK approximately 15 times lower than that of ibrutinib. Involvement of CYP2D6 in the 
metabolism of ibrutinib appears to be minimal. Therefore, no precautions are necessary in patients with 
different CYP2D6 genotypes.  
Apparent clearance (CL/F) is approximately 1,000 L/h. The half-life of ibrutinib is 4 to 13 hours. 
After a single oral administration of radiolabeled [14C]-ibrutinib in healthy subjects, approximately 90% of 
radioactivity was excreted within 168 hours, with the majority (80%) excreted in the faeces and less than 
10% accounted for in urine. Unchanged ibrutinib accounted for approximately 1% of the radiolabeled 
excretion product in faeces and none in urine. 
Ibrutinib has minimal renal clearance; urinary excretion of metabolites is < 10% of the dose. No specific 
studies have been conducted to date in subjects with impaired renal function. There are no data in 
patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis (see section 4.2). 
Ibrutinib is metabolised in the liver. In a dedicated hepatic impairment trial in non-cancer patients 
administered a single dose of 140 mg of medicinal product, preliminary data showed an approximate 4-, 
8-, and 9-fold increase in ibrutinib exposure in subjects with mild (n = 6), moderate (n = 10) and severe 
(n = 8) hepatic impairment, respectively. The free fraction of ibrutinib also increased with degree of 
impairment, with 3.0, 3.8 and 4.8% in subjects with mild, moderate and severe liver impairment, 
respectively, compared to 3.3% in plasma from matched healthy controls within this study. An increase 
in unbound ibrutinib exposure is estimated to be 4-, 9-, and 13-fold in subjects with mild, moderate, and 
severe hepatic impairment, respectively (see section 4.2). As the hepatic impairment study report is not 
yet available, the final study report on the hepatic impairment study PCI-32765CLL1006 should be 
submitted post-approval (See RMP). 
Co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, in 18 fasted healthy subjects, increased 
exposure (Cmax and AUC) of ibrutinib by 29- and 24-fold, respectively. Simulations using fasted conditions 
suggested that the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin may increase the AUC of ibrutinib by a factor 
of 14. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, nefazadone and cobicistat) should therefore be avoided. If 
the benefit outweighs the risk and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor must be used, reduce the IMBRUVICA dose 
to 140 mg (one capsule) or withhold treatment temporarily (for 7 days or less). Monitor patient closely for 
toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Simulations using fasted conditions suggested that moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, diltiazem, erythromycin 
and voriconazole, may increase the AUC of ibrutinib 5-9 fold. Moderate inhibitors (e.g., voriconazole, 
erythromycin, amprenavir, aprepitant, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, crizotinib, darunavir/ritonavir, diltiazem, 
fluconazole, fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil, amiodarone, dronedarone) should be avoided. Mild 
CYP3A4 inhibitors azithromycin and fluvoxamine may increase the AUC of ibrutinib by a factor of < 2-fold. 
In the SmPC clinicians are instructed to reduce IMBRUVICA treatment to 140 mg in case a a moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitor must be used but no dose adjustment is required in combination with mild inhibitors in 
both cases doctors are advised to monitor patient closely for toxicity and follow dose modification 
guidance as needed. 
Co-administration of grapefruit juice, containing CYP3A4 inhibitors, in eight healthy subjects, increased 
exposure (Cmax and AUC) of ibrutinib by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively. Grapefruit and Seville 
oranges should be avoided during IMBRUVICA treatment, as these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 
(see section 4.2). 
Administration of Imbruvica with inducers of CYP3A4 can decrease ibrutinib plasma concentrations. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645137/2014  
Page 48/140 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-administration of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, in 18 fasted healthy subjects, decreased 
exposure (Cmax and AUC) of ibrutinib by 92 and 90%, respectively. Avoid concomitant use of strong or 
moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, phenytoin). Preparations containing 
St. John's Wort are contraindicated during treatment with IMBRUVICA, as efficacy may be reduced.  
Doctors are advised to consider alternative agents with less CYP3A4 induction. If the benefit outweighs 
the risk and a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer must be used, monitor patient closely for lack of 
efficacy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Mild inducers may be used concomitantly with IMBRUVICA, however, 
patients should be monitored for potential lack of efficacy. 
In vitro studies indicated that ibrutinib is a weak inhibitor toward CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. The dihydrodiol metabolite of ibrutinib is a weak inhibitor toward CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. Both ibrutinib and the dihydrodiol metabolite are at most weak inducers of CYP450 
isoenzymes in vitro. Therefore, it is unlikely that the medicinal product has any clinically relevant 
drug-drug interactions with medicinal products that may be metabolised by the CYP450 enzymes. 
In vitro studies indicated that ibrutinib is not a substrate of P-gp, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Ibrutinib is an 
in vitro inhibitor of P-gp (see section 4.5). 
Time-dependent inhibition (TDI) data has not been submitted for a number of CYP enzymes. Thus, in vitro 
TDI data will be presented for CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 post-approval (See RMP). In 
addition, due to the poor stability of ibrutinib in hepatocytes the in vitro induction study is considered 
inconclusive. As ibrutinib was shown not to be a CYP3A4 inducer in vivo the applicant will submit new data 
on ibrutinib as an inducer of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 (See RMP). Further, no data on the inhibitory potential 
of ibrutinib on drug transporters, except for P-gp, has been submitted. These studies are planned or 
ongoing and will be submitted post-approval (See RMP). 
There is a risk that ibrutinib may inhibit intestinal CYP3A4 and thereby increasing the exposure of CYP3A4 
substrates with a large contribution of intestinal CYP3A4 metabolism to its first pass extraction. This 
interaction has not been studied in vivo and its clinical relevance is currently unknown. (See SmPC section 
5.2). Due to degradation of ibrutinib in vitro, the submitted in vitro and PBPK model data cannot be 
considered sufficient to exclude a risk for clinically relevant CYP3A4 intestinal inhibition by ibrutinib. 
Reversible CYP3A inhibition by ibrutinib will be studied in vitro by minimising the decline in ibrutinib 
concentration during incubations. If a risk for clinically relevant inhibition cannot be excluded an in vivo 
study will be considered (see RMP).  Therefore, an in vivo interaction study between ibrutinib and a model 
CYP3A4 substrate, with a large contribution of intestinal CYP3A4 metabolism to its first pass extraction, 
will be performed and submitted post-approval (See RMP). 
Concomitant use of Imbruvica and medicinal products that strongly or moderately inhibit CYP3A4 can 
increase ibrutinib exposure and should be avoided. 
Ibrutinib is a P-gp inhibitor in vitro. As no clinical data are available on this interaction, it cannot be 
excluded that ibrutinib could inhibit intestinal P-gp after a therapeutic dose. To avoid a potential 
interaction in the GI tract, narrow therapeutic range P-gp substrates such as digoxin should be taken at 
least 6 hours before or after Imbruvica. 
Ibrutinib is considered teratogenic (See Discussion on non-clinical aspects). The applicant will investigate 
the feasibility to conduct a drug interaction study between ibrutinib and oral contraceptives 
post-approval.  
Population pharmacokinetics indicated that age and gender does not significantly influence ibrutinib 
clearance from the circulation. There are insufficient data to evaluate the potential effect of race on 
ibrutinib pharmacokinetics. Body weight (range: 41-146 kg; mean [SD]: 83 (19) kg) had a negligible 
effect on ibrutinib clearance.

No specific dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 years) 
No pharmacokinetic studies were performed with Imbruvica in patients under 18 years of age. 
Ibrutinib therapy is associated with a mild decrease in the QTcF interval duration (mean 7.5 ms in study 
1102). The clinical consequences of a shortened QTc duration are still largely unknown but may include an 
increased risk for arrhythmias (See discussion on Clinical safety and SmPC section 4.4), allowing the 
clinicians to use clinical judgment when assessing whether to prescribe ibrutinib to patients at risk from 
further shortening their QTc duration (e.g. Congenital Short QT Syndrome or patients with a family 
history of such a syndrome). Further information on this interaction will be provided from planned QTc 
study (PCI-32765CLL1007) (see RMP). 
2.7.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ibrutinib and its active metabolite have been sufficiently 
characterized.   
Awaiting data from the planned studies, the lack of information is addressed by appropriate warnings in 
the SmPC section 4.4 and 4.2. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary –as part of the RMP- to address the issues related 
to pharmacology:  
- 
- 
Investigate the feasibility to conduct a drug interaction study between ibrutinib and oral 
contraceptives. If feasible, such a study will be conducted. 
Further evaluation of drug interactions, especially the potential interaction with PPI, the validity of 
the submitted in vitro studies and the potential intestinal interactions of ibrutinib will be 
performed  
-  An in vitro inhibition experiment for reversible CYP3A inhibition by ibrutinib, minimizing the 
decline in ibrutinib concentration during incubations.  
-  Submission of the final study report on the hepatic impairment study PCI-32765CLL1006 
-  An in vitro study to investigate the time dependent inhibition by ibrutinib on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 should be submitted.  
- 
In vitro studies investigating the inhibitory potential of ibrutinib towards BCRP, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1 and OAT3 should be submitted.  
-  An in vivo interaction study between ibrutinib and a model CYP3A4 substrate, with a large 
contribution of intestinal CYP3A4 metabolism to its first pass extraction, should be performed and 
submitted.   
-  Submission of an in vitro study to investigate the induction by ibrutinib on CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 
should be submitted.  
-  Submission of the study report from the planned QTc study (PCI-32765CLL1007).

2.8.  Clinical efficacy 
Overview of studies 
For an overview of clinical efficacy studies, see Table 10-11. 
The MAA for Imbruvica is based on a pivotal phase II study  PCYC-1104-CA in relapsed or refractory MCL 
(n=111) and a phase Ib/II study, PCYC-1102-CA in relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL (n=132 whereof 101 
with relapsed or refractory disease including 51 with the proposed 420 mg daily dose), with supportive 
evidence derived from the 04753 phase I study (MCL n=9; CLL/SLL n=16). Results from the interim 
analysis of a randomized, Phase 3 Study of ibrutinib versus ofatumumab in relapsed or refractory Chronic 
Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (study PCYC 1112) was submitted within the 
Applicant’s responses to CHMP List of questions. 
2.8.1.  Dose response study 
Study PCYC-04753 
Title: Phase I Dose-Escalation Study of Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitor PCI-32765 in Recurrent 
B-Cell Lymphoma 
Objectives: The primary objectives of this study were to establish the safety and the MTD of orally 
administered ibrutinib in patients with recurrent B-cell lymphoma, to determine the PK of orally 
administered ibrutinib, and to measure pharmacodynamic parameters that include drug occupancy of 
BTK and the effect on biological markers of B-cell function. The secondary objective of this study was to 
evaluate tumor responses. 
Methodology: This was a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of ibrutinib in patients 
with recurrent surface immunoglobulin positive B-cell NHL according to WHO. Cohorts of 6 to 10 subjects 
each were to receive ibrutinib at 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 8.3, 12.5, and 17.5 mg/kg/day until the MTD was 
established. A minimum of 4 evaluable subjects per cohort were included in the DLT and safety 
evaluations before a decision was made to dose escalate or initiate the next dosing cohort. Subjects were 
to receive daily treatment for 28 days followed by a 7-day rest period (1 cycle). Upon determination of 
the MTD, a cohort of 6 to 10 subjects was to be enrolled to receive ibrutinib at the MTD or“preferred 
occupying dose”continuously for 35 days with no rest period (1 cycle).   
Key inclusion criteria included: measurable disease; failed ≥1 previous treatment for lymphoma and no 
standard therapy was available; ECOG performance status of ≤1.  
Key exclusion criteria included: more than 4 prior systemic therapies (not counting maintenance 
rituximab), except for CLL patients; prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant. The use of medications 
known to prolong corrected QT interval (QTc) interval or that may be associated with Torsades de Pointes 
were prohibited within 7 days of treatment start and during Cycle 1. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, 
rituximab, prednisone (>20 mg/day), and radiotherapy were prohibited.

In summary, the BTK occupancies for the 2.5 mg/kg/day to 12.5 mg/kg/day cohorts were all above 90% 
at either 4 or 24 hours after drug administration. The mean BTK occupancies of continued dosing cohorts 
CD-1 (8.3 mg/kg/day), CD-2 (560 mg/day), and CD-3 (560 mg/day DLBCL) at 4 hours were 92.39%, 
95.82%, and 97.79%, respectively; whereas the 24-hour occupancies were 93.36%, 94.18%, and 
97.32%, respectively. In all cohorts above 2.5 mg/kg/day (or 200 mg), for both weight-based (ie, mg/kg) 
dosing and fixed dosing (ie, continuous dosing of 560 mg/day), the mean BTK occupancies were above 
90% at 4 hours and 24 hours after drug administration. 
The MTD of ibrutinib was not reached using intermittent dosing cohorts up to 12.5 mg/kg/day and 
continuous dosing cohorts at 560 mg/day. Two DLTs occurred during the study conduct: 1 Grade 3 
allergic hypersensitivity (8.3 mg/kg/day dosing cohort) and 1 dose interruption for more than 7 days 
secondary to Grade 2 neutropenia (2.5 mg/kg/day dosing cohort) (See also Supportive studies for 
description of efficacy in MCL, CLL).

Ibrutinib 560 mg (4 x 140-mg capsules) was to be administered orally once daily until unacceptable 
toxicity. Each dose of ibrutinib was to be taken at least 30 minutes before eating or at least 2 hours after 
a meal, at approximately the same time each day. 
Dosing was to be held for any of the following conditions: Grade ≥3 neutropenia with fever; Grade 4 
neutropenia lasting >7 days (unless there was documented bone marrow involvement in which case 
study drug was to be held if there was >50% reduction in neutrophil count); Platelet counts <20 x 109/L 
(unless there was documented bone marrow involvement in which case dose was to be held if there 
was >50% reduction in platelet count); Any Grade ≥3 nonhematologic toxicity. 
Use of hematopoietic growth factors was permitted after Cycle 1 according to the ASCO guidelines. 
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4/5 or CYP2D6 inhibitors, or strong CYP3A4/5 inducers, were to be 
avoided, if possible. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib in subjects with relapsed 
/refractory MCL. 
The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety of a fixed daily dosing regimen of ibrutinib in this 
population. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Overall response rate (ORR), defined as the percent of subjects who achieved 
either a PR or CR, according to the revised IWG criteria for NHL (Cheson 2007), as assessed by 
investigators. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: Assessed by the investigator 
-  Duration of response (DOR)

The effect of the 2 manufacturing sites on efficacy, safety,and pharmacokinetics 
Other analyses: Patient reported outcomes – EORTC QLQ-30 
CT scans (with contrast unless contraindicated) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and any other disease 
sites were to be performed for tumour assessments within 7 days of Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7 and then 
every 3 cycles until progressive disease. PET was mandatory to confirm any complete remission. Likewise, 
endoscopy was mandatory to confirm complete remission for any subjects with a documented history of 
gastrointestinal involvement at the time of screening and bone marrow biopsies were required to confirm 
complete response if bone marrow was involved at time of screening.  
Sample size 
Approximately 115 subjects were to be enrolled and grouped into 2 cohorts based upon prior exposure to 
bortezomib.  
For the bortezomib-naïve cohort, a 2-stage design was used to test the null hypothesis that ORR would be 
≤20% (not considered clinically compelling). Twenty-five subjects were to be included in the first stage, 
and, if there were at least 6 objective responses, a total of 65 subjects were to be enrolled in this cohort. 
A sample size of 65 subjects at final analysis would provide 91% power to test a difference of 20% versus 
40% using a one-sided 0.01 significance level.  
For the bortezomib-exposed cohort, a 2-stage design was used to test the null hypothesis that ORR would 
be ≤15% (not considered clinically compelling). Twenty-five subjects were to be included in the first 
stage, and, if there were at least 5 objective responses, a total of 50 subjects were to be enrolled in this 
cohort. A sample size of 50 subjects at final analysis would provide at least 80% power to test a difference 
of 15% versus 35% using a one-sided 0.01 significance level.  
In both cohorts, the interim stopping rules were based on the stopping rules for Simon’s 2-stage optimal 
Phase 2 design.

One interim analysis for futility based on response rate was planned for each cohort. The IA was 
performed in December 2011 when approximately 31 subjects were enrolled in the bortezomib-naive and 
20 subjects were enrolled in the bortezomib-exposed cohorts and available for initial response evaluation.

Subject Disposition and Treatment Withdrawal Information; All Treated Population 
Out of the 115 patients enrolled 2 in each cohort were not treated at physician’s decision. Reasons for 
Discontinuation in the All treated population (n=111) were death (36.9%) lost to follow up (1.8%) 
withdrawal of consent (7.2%) in the All Treated Population. 
Recruitment 
The study was initiated on 8 February 2011 and date of the clinical cut-off for primary analysis was 26 
December 2012. Number of patients enrolled was 115 at 9 sites in US, 2 sites in Germany, 3 sites in 
Poland, and 4 sites in UK.

Protocol amendments were:  
Amendment 1.0 (20 December 2010): Modification of inclusion criteria to include subjects who had either 
prior exposure to bortezomib therapy (n=50) or who were naïve to bortezomib therapy (n=50) (the 
original protocol excluded subjects with prior bortezomib exposure) and to allow up to 5 prior therapies 
(previously up to 3). Amendment 2.0 (3 October 2011): - to allow enrollment of 25 additional 
bortezomib- naïve subjects in the study. Amendment 3.0 (30 August 2012): Patients who did not 
progress and were on study treatment were required to continue treatment in a long-term extension 
study.  In amendment 4, de-identified copies of all scans and radiology reports were to be provided for an 
independent response evaluation of the radiographic scans. 
Protocol deviations 
Protocol deviations were reported in 12 patients: 9 violations of eligibility criteria, 1 concomitant

Treatments 
Ofatumumab i.v. treatment for 12 i.v. doses over 24 weeks or until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity  
ibrutinib p.o. treatment of 420 mg administered orally daily to continue until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity 
Duration of Treatment: Subjects randomized to ibrutinib were to receive study drug daily until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity. Subjects randomized to ofatumumab were to receive treatment for 
up to 12 doses (approximately 6 months), until disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity as detailed 
in the package insert. Subjects were planned to be followed for 3 years (until June 2015) after the first 
subject was enrolled. 
Objectives:  
Primary Objective: 
To evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib compared to ofatumumab in terms of progression-free 
survival (PFS) (IRC) per International Workshop on CLL Criteria (IWCLL, Hallek 2008) with incorporation 
of the clarification for treatment related lymphocytosis (Hallek 2012) (hereafter referred to as IWCLL 
2008 criteria) in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. 
Secondary Objectives: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
To compare efficacy between the two treatment groups in terms of: overall survival (OS) 
To evaluate IRC-assessed overall response rate (ORR) per IWCLL 2008 criteria 
To evaluate patient-reported outcome (PRO) by FACiT-Fatigue 
To evaluate haematological improvement 
To evaluate event-free survival (EFS) 
-  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib compared to ofatumumab

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS, which is defined as the time from the date of randomization until 
disease progression (assessed by the IRC per IWCLL 2008 criteria) or death from any cause, whichever 
occurs first. Patients who withdraw from the study or are considered lost to follow-up without prior 
documentation of disease progression will be censored on the date of the last adequate disease 
assessment. For patients without an adequate post-baseline disease assessment, PFS will be censored on 
the date of randomization. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints:  
Investigator-assessed PFS is defined as time from randomization until disease progression (assessed by 
the Investigator per IWCLL 2008 criteria) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Analysis 
methods for Investigator-assessed PFS will be similar to those described for PFS as assessed by the IRC 
per IWCLL 2008 criteria. 
Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a CR, CRi, nPR, or PR 
over the course of the study as evaluated by the IRC and the investigator. Patients who do not have any 
post-baseline response assessment will be considered as non-responders.  
Overall survival, overall response rate per IWCLL 2008 criteria by the IRC, FACIT-Fatigue, and  
Time to improvement and percentage of patients with sustained haematological improvement  measured 
in the subset of patients with cytopenia(s) at baseline (Hgb < 11 g/dL, platelets < 100,000, or ANC < 
1500 cells/μL). Sustained haematological improvement is defined as improvement in cytopenia by ≥
50%, or Hgb ≥ 11 g/dL, ANC ≥  1500 cells/μL, platelets ≥ 100,000 with the duration of improvement 
lasting for ≥  60 days without blood transfusion or growth factors.   
Sample size 
The study was expected to enrol a minimum of 350 patients with study duration of 23 months including 
an accrual period of 13 months. A minimum of 175 patients were to be centrally randomized at 1:1 ratio 
to each of the 2 arms of this study. A minimum of 176 PFS events provides 90% power to detect the target 
hazard ratio of 0.6 based on a log-rank test and a two-sided overall significance level of 0.05 adjusting for 
one interim analysis. This hazard ratio corresponds to an increase in median PFS from 8 months 
(ofatumumab arm) to 13.31 months (ibrutinib arm). 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised to ibrutinib versus ofatumumab.  
The randomization was stratified by important prognostic factors in CLL/SLL: whether the subject was 
positive for del17p and whether the subject was refractory to purine analogues administered in 
combination with an anti CD20 monoclonal antibody.  
Two randomization schemes were generated: one for each geographic region (US versus non-US). Under 
each scheme, randomization was stratified using the following factors: 1) presence versus absence of 
refractory disease to purine analogue and anti-CD20 containing CIT regimen, and 2) presence versus 
absence of del17p. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645137/2014  
Page 70/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blinding / Masking  
The study was open- label. 
Statistical methods 
All efficacy analyses will be performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. All the stratified 
analyses will be based on the two randomization stratification factors: 1) refractory disease (presence 
versus absence) to purine analogue and anti-CD20 containing chemoimmunotherapy regimen, and 2) 
status of 17p del (presence versus absence). 
PFS as determined by the IRC will be summarized for each treatment arm using Kaplan-Meier estimates 
and compared using stratified log rank test. 
Overall response rate (ORR) as determined by the IRC will be compared using the Cochran –Mantel 
-Haenzel chi-square test, stratified by the two stratification factors (refractory disease and 17p del). 
Overall survival will be compared using stratified log rank test. Survival rate at landmark points will be 
summarized based on Kaplan-Meier point estimates and compared using the standard normal Z test. 
Descriptive statistics for change in scores from baseline to each assessment will be summarized for the 
PROs assessed by the FACiTFatigue. 
Time to hematological improvement will be compared using unstratified log rank test.  
A planned interim analysis for both superiority and futility (non-binding) at approximately 117 
IRC-assessed PFS events, which is 66.5% of information fraction, based on a group sequential design 
with Lan-DeMets spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundary was to be used.

With the data cut-off of 06 November 2013 and database extract completed on 18 December 2013, the 
interim analysis was actually conducted with 146 PFS events representing 83% of the planned total PFS 
events. This interim analysis crossed the superiority boundary and therefore is considered as the final 
analysis for the study (see discussion on clinical efficacy), as triggered by DMC recommendation after the 
review of interim efficacy analysis results. Any future analyses will be considered supplemental. 
Baseline data 
A total of 391 subjects were enrolled in the study from sites located in the US (49.1%), Europe (43.5%), 
and Australia (7.4%) Total enrollment was higher than planned enrollment (N=350) in the ibrutinib arm, 
all 195 subjects received at least one dose of study drug. As of the data cutoff date, 27 subjects (13.8%) 
in  the  ibrutinib  arm  had  completed/discontinued  treatment;  progressive  disease  was  reported  as  the 
reason for discontinuation of treatment in 4.6% of subjects, AE in 4.1% of subjects, and death in 4.1% of 
subjects.

For those who discontinued due to AE, 2 (1.0%) were due to infection (Pneumocystis jirovecii infection 
and pneumonia); the remaining were single occurrences. In the ofatumumab arm, 191 subjects (97.4%) 
received at least one dose of study drug . Five subjects (2.6%) in the ofatumumab arm did not receive 
study  drug:  4  withdrew  consent  and  one  died.  As  of  the  data  cutoff  date,  190 subjects  (96.9%)  had 
completed/discontinued  treatment.  Most  subjects  completed  their  planned  treatment  regimen. 
Progressive disease was reported as the reason for discontinuation of treatment in 19.4% of subjects, AE 
in 3.6% of subjects, and death in 4.6% of subjects.

A  total  of  18  subjects  (9.2%)  in  the  ibrutinib  arm  and  46  subjects  (23.5%)  in  the  ofatumumab  arm 
discontinued  the  study.  Death  was  the  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  of  study  in  both 
treatment groups (ibrutinib: 8.2%, ofatumumab: 19.4%). At the data cutoff date, 168 subjects (86.2%) 
in the ibrutinib arm and 1 subject (0.5%) in the ofatumumab arm were still undergoing treatment. The 
remaining 9 subjects (4.6%) in the ibrutinib arm and 149 subjects (76.0%) in the ofatumumab arm were 
in long-term follow-up. As of the data cutoff, 57 subjects (29.1%) originally randomized to ofatumumab 
subsequently received ibrutinib therapy. 
The median (maximum) time on study was 9.6 (16.6) months for subjects in the ibrutinib arm and 9.2 
(16.5) months for subjects in the ofatumumab arm.

The presence or absence of del17p was locally evaluated in all enrolled subjects prior to randomization as 
one of the randomization stratification factors. Del17p was positive based on local lab/IWRS data for 
32.5% of subjects. The Sponsor is also conducting central analysis (ie, Abbott CLL FISH Probe Kit) for 
del17p status at 3 central labs (US, EU, Australia). As of this CSR analysis, central FISH analysis results 
for 274 of the 391 randomized subjects were completed based on sample and processing availability. Out 
of 274 patient samples, 90 (32.9%) were positive for del17p.  
Median time from initial diagnosis was approximately 7.5 years. Only 18 (5%) had SLL. Del 17p by local 
evaluation was detected in roughly a third of patients. The majority of patients had, expectedly, advanced 
disease with Rai stage III-IV and bulky disease. Baseline disease characteristics were generally well 
balanced between study arms. Comparison of the local FISH/IWRS captured results with central FISH 
results is ongoing, but so far indicates a good (concordance of 86%). Median number of prior therapies 
was 3 in the ibrutinib arm and 2 in the ofatumumab arm. The vast majority of patients had received CIT 
with anti-CD20. In terms of prior therapy, the ibrutinib population was slightly more exposed.

Figure 10. 
Forest Plot of Hazard Ratios for Progression-Free Survival (ITT Population) 
The primary PFS analysis, based on IRC assessment and with no censoring for initiation of subsequent 
therapy, shows a large and statistically highly significant superiority for the ibrutinib arm, p <0.0001, HR 
= 0.215, 95% CI: 0.146, 0.317, with K-M curves separating over time. Median PFS was 8.1 months in the 
ofatumumab arm while not reached in the ibrutinib arm. Landmark K-M estimates at 6 month  showed a 
PFS rate of 88%  in the ibrutinib arm vs 65% in the ofatumumab arm. The robustness of the primary 
analysis is supported by performed sensitivity analyses and the general consistency in the subgroup 
analyses. The only aberrant signal noted in the subgroup analyses concerns the numerically higher HR 
noted in Europe/Other vs US (0.341 vs 0.123). To address this issue raised by the rapporteurs, a 
multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis was employed, using a comprehensive list of baseline 
prognostic variables as covariates. After adjustment for the baseline covariates the HR is 0.22 (0.085, 
0.564) for US and 0.20 (0.092, 0.451) for Europe/other. The selected covariates are considered clinically 
appropriate and while acknowledging the caveats of the presented post-hoc analysis there is no reason to 
anticipate major differences between the regions.

The results are based on very low event numbers, 26 disease progressions and 9 deaths in the ibrutinib 
arm. 
PFS2 
The applicant was asked by the CHMP to present data on PFS2 (defined as the time interval between 
randomization and progressive disease by investigator after the first subsequent therapy, death, or the 
start of the next subsequent therapy if no progressive disease is recorded in the ITT population), for the 
approximately 4% of subjects in the ibrutinib arm and 20% of subjects in the ofatumumab arm that 
received subsequent anti-neoplastic treatments. Analyses of PFS2 were performed in similar fashion as 
for the primary endpoint of PFS.  
Generally, data for ibrutinib are too immature (8 patients receiving subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy, 
16 events in the PFS2 analysis, and 2 events in the time on next anti-cancer therapy analysis) for a solid 
assessment per se. However, when comparing the 2 treatment arms, a statistically significant reduction 
in the risk of disease progression after 2 lines of therapy or death was noted in the ibrutinib arm (HR = 
0.245, 95% CI: 0.140, 0.430), and while median PFS2 was 11.3 months for the ofatumumab arm it was 
not reached in the ibrutinib arm, due to a low event rate. Regarding time on next anti-cancer therapy, the 
median time on next therapy was 3.5 months for the 39 subjects in the ofatumumab arm but not reached 
in the ibrutinib patients (n=8), based on 32 and 2 events, respectively. 
Collectively, available data does not indicate an adverse effect on PFS2 by ibrutinib. Updates should 
constitute part of the post-approval commitments.

Table 35.  Overall Response Rate by IRC Assessment (ITT population) 
Confirmed ORR per IRC was remarkably and statistically significantly higher in the ibrutinib arm, (43%), 
vs the ofatumumab arm (4%), p<0.0001, supported by the results of the investigator assessment. When 
including also PRL the results were even more pronounced, 63% vs 4%. Notably, no CR was reached in 
either arm.  
FACIT-Fatigue 
No significant difference was observed between the 2 treatment arms (p=0.8435). With this statistically 
non-significant result, the hierarchal testing stopped here. 
Ancillary analyses 
Hematologic improvement 
In subjects with cytopenia at baseline, a markedly larger fraction achieved sustained haematological 
improvement of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the ibrutinib arm, 63% vs 32% and 72% vs 22%, 
respectively.

Treatments 
Ibrutinib 420 mg (3 x 140 mg capsules) or 840 mg (6 x 140 mg capsules) was self-administered orally 
once daily, at least 2 hours after the previous meal and 30 minutes before the next meal at the same time 
each day. 
Treatment with ibrutinib was held for any unmanageable toxicity that was either potentially study 
drug-related or Grade 3 or higher in severity. Study drug was held for a maximum of 28 consecutive days 
for toxicity; subjects were discontinued from treatment for required delays longer than 28 days.  
Dose modifications were to be instituted in the following circumstances: treatment-emergent Grade 4 
neutropenia for more than 7 days; Grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia depending upon presence of 
bleeding; persistent Grade 3 or higher nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea despite treatment; or any other 
Grade 4 or unmanageable Grade 3 toxicity. Separate instructions were provided for QTc prolongation. In 
subjects with baseline thrombocytopenia, dose modifications were based on percent decrease in platelets 
from baseline.  
Subjects who required full-dose anticoagulant treatment (such as heparin or warfarin) were to have study 
drug temporarily suspended until on a stable anticoagulant dose. Dose reductions were to be permanent. 
No intrasubject dose escalation was allowed on this study. 
Neutrophil growth factors were allowed. Corticosteroids (at dosages equivalent to prednisone > 20 
mg/day), red blood cell growth factors, platelet growth factors, or sargramostim were prohibited. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to determine the safety of 2 fixed-dose daily regimens of ibrutinib 
in subjects with CLL/SLL.  
The secondary objectives were to assess the preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics (including the effects 
of the fed-versus-fasted state), pharmacodynamics, and long-term safety of ibrutinib. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: Safety, as measured by the incidence, severity, and drug-relatedness of clinical AEs. 
Secondary endpoints: 
-  Overall response rate: Response assessment was performed by the investigator and followed the 
IWCLL 2008 guidelines (Hallek 2008). For CLL subjects, treatment-related lymphocytosis was not 
considered progression and partial response with lymphocytosis was assessed according to 
clarification of the IWCLL criteria (Hallek 2012). For SLL subjects, the IWG for non-Hodgkin’s 
Lymphoma 2007 criteria were used (Cheson 2007).

Exploratory endpoints were: Identification of putative biomarkers of response, including but not limited to 
stimulated cytogenetics, interphase cytogenetics, IgVH mutational status, ZAP-70 methylation, CD38 
expression, and serum β-2 microglobulin levels; Effects of fasted versus fed state on the 
pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib ; Time to response; Duration of response; Overall survival  
A CT scan (with contrast unless contraindicated) was required of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis for 
pre-treatment tumour assessment of subjects with CLL. In addition, PET/CT was required for subjects 
with SLL. During treatment, the same scans were required at the end of Cycles 2, 5, 8, 12, 15, 18, 24, 
within 3 months prior to enrolling into the long-term extension study, or at any time to confirm 
progression. 
Overall response assessments included investigator evaluation of radiological examination, physical 
examination, haematology, and, when appropriate, bone marrow results. Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy 
was collected pretreatment and to confirm a complete response, after which further on-treatment scans 
were only required to confirm disease progression. Peripheral blood and/or bone marrow aspirate/biopsy 
with flow cytometry assessments for minimal residual disease were also to be done in the event of a 
complete response. 
Sample size 
The sample size of 12 to 24 subjects per treatment cohort was considered sufficient to define the safety 
profile and pharmacokinetic characteristics of the 2 fixed-dose regimens of ibrutinib. No inferential 
statistical analyses were planned for this study.

One hundred sixteen subjects were treated in 5 cohorts evaluable for primary efficacy, with primarily 
cohorts 1 and 4 (total n=51) supporting the application. In addition, cohort 6 recruited 16 patients for a 
randomized crossover substudy to assess the effects of the fed-versus-fasted state on the 
pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib, but due to a required shorter treatment period (6 cycles vs 12 or 24 cycles 
for cohort 1-5) this cohort was not used for efficacy analyses other than in patients with 17p deletion.

2.8.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
MCL 
The efficacy evaluation is based on uncontrolled phase II data. The database is adequate in the context of 
the disease. Subject enrollment was non-randomized and based on prior bortezomib exposure. Efficacy 
was to be evaluated by the ORR based on investigator assessments, which was defined as the proportion 
of subjects achieving either a CR or a PR according to the revised IWG criteria for NHL. Duration of 
response for subjects achieving a response, PFS, and overall survival were to be assessed as 
secondary endpoints. In addition, response was to be confirmed by independent response assessment, 
as part of an exploratory analysis. There are no concerns regarding the design of the study, the patient 
population included or the presentation and interpretation of the efficacy data. The primary endpoint of 
ORR is considered clinically relevant and the response appears to be independent of relevant clinical 
characteristics such as age, sex, geographic region, number of prior treatments, prior bortezomib 
exposure, prior lenalidomide therapy, baseline ECOG score, and high-risk features including simplified 
high MIPI score, baseline refractory disease, or blastoid histology.  
CLL 
In the initially presented dossier, study 1102 was presented as the main study; the results of the interim 
analysis of 1112 were available during the procedure as part of the responses to the CHMP List of 
Questions.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645137/2014  
Page 96/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHMP advice was sought on the design and methodology of study PCYC-1112. The Advice received was 
followed by the applicant. With regard to defining the population, and according to the ESMO Clinical 
Practice Guideline (Eichhorst 2011), the decision on re-treatment is influenced by the fact of prior 
monotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy. It is accepted that patients with del17p do respond poorly to 
fludarabine-based therapy and that this cytogenetic abnormality is an important prognostic factor, and 
hence the proposed stratification on deletion status of 17p as a major prognostic factor is agreed upon. 
Patients who were negative in historical samples would have del17p FISH test repeated prior to 
randomisation. Prior treatment lines were recorded to enable evaluation of subgroups based on prior 
therapies, e.g. rituximab, bendamustine. Considering that the inclusion criteria define a population unfit 
for fludarabine as well as patients with prior fludarabine exposure and poor or short response, 
acknowledging that alemtuzumab has currently a limited use in CLL and is probably too toxic for elderly 
patients and that bendamustine is also quite toxic and not approved for second-line therapy, ofatumumab 
was considered an acceptable comparator. 
The choice of progression-free survival (PFS) as primary endpoint is considered acceptable for the 
demonstration of clinical benefit in the proposed population, in accordance with existing guidelines, 
provided mature data are available at the time of analysis. Use of the IWCLL 2008 criteria for response 
was supported, as well as the schedule of response assessments.  
In addition to the sensitivity analysis that addresses the influence of start of subsequent anti-leukaemia, 
sensitivity analyses addressing the influence of sources of missing data such as withdrawal of consent, 
loss of follow-up or missed scheduled visits, and analyses addressing detection of progression in 
unscheduled visits were pre-specified. The OS analysis was anticipated to be likely immature at the time 
of the planned interim analysis.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
MCL 
The efficacy evaluation is based on data from the pivotal phase II study 1104 (n=111) and the supportive 
study 04753 (n=5 with the 520 mg daily dose), both single arm trials. With the limitations of uncontrolled 
data acknowledged, the robustness of the 1104 study is not challenged and, looking at the population 
under study, data should be roughly representative for the general population with r/r MCL. 
ORR by investigator assessment, the primary endpoint in study 1104, was 67.6% with CR in 20.7%. This 
result was highly concordant with that obtained by the ICR. In addition, stable disease was noted in16 
patients (14.4%), ending up to a disease control rate of 82% (91/111) at the study cut-off. With caution 
for some groups with small subject numbers, the treatment effect seemed fairly consistent throughout 
the analysed subgroups, including region, relapsed or refractory disease, bulky disease, number of prior 
regimens, simplified MIPI score, and prior therapy with bortezomib or lenalidomide. The median times to 
initial and complete responses were 1.9 and 5.5 months, respectively. 
In an update on time-dependent outcomes provided during the procedure, based on final database lock 
of 14 March 2014, more mature data on duration of response, PFS, and OS was received. As of the data 
update, the median time on study for the 111 treated subjects was 26.7 months (range, 1.9, 32.5) 
compared with 15.3 months (range, 1.9 to 22.3 months) at the CSR cut-off. With the new cut-off, the 
median duration of response was unchanged, 17.5 months, median PFS 13.0 months (95% CI: 7.0, 
28.7+) with 34% of subjects censored as compared to 13.9 months (95% CI: 7.0, not estimable) with 
49% of subjects censored at the CSR cut-off, and median OS 22.5 months (95% CI: 13.73, not estimable) 
with 49% deaths as compared to not reached with 37% deaths at the CSR cut-off. For OS, approximately 
50% of the survivors were censored due to treatment in the extension study. In summary, with more 
mature data, enough reassurance is provided on the sustained activity of ibrutinib in this indication.   
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645137/2014

From  a  historical  perspective  these  results  must  be  considered  outstanding  as  responses  of  this 
magnitude have not been reported with other available monotherapies for R/R MCL.  
A randomised trial in r/r MCL is currently ongoing, evaluating ibrutinib vs temsirolimus, and results will be 
provided post-approval as agreed.  This is a Phase 3; Randomised, controlled, open-label, multicentre; in 
patients with relapsed/ refractory MCL who have received at least 1 prior rituximab-containing 
chemotherapy regimen (including analysis of treatment –related lymphocytosis). Time-dependent 
outcome measures for groups with and without treatment-related lymphocytosis will be presented.  
CLL 
In the data initially submitted, the efficacy evaluation in r/r CLL/SLL was primarily based on uncontrolled 
data in 51 subjects with the intended 420 mg daily dose in the pivotal phase Ib/II study 1102, (where 
efficacy was secondary endpoint) with support from data in 34 patients treated with 840 mg daily, and 16 
subjects with various doses of study drug in study 04753. Additional analyses were presented for a 
population with del17p and are based on a heterogeneous population within the 1102 study: 36 subjects 
from Cohorts 1 through 6, whereof 2 were treatment-naïve (Cohort 2), and 5 subjects were from the 
food-effect cohort, Cohort 6; 25 subjects received 420 mg ibrutinib daily. All del17p patients had CLL. The 
median time since diagnosis was 78.4 months. Rai classification was high-risk for 61.1% of subjects. The 
median number of prior therapies was 4.0 in the subset of patients with r/r disease.  
ORR by investigator assessment in the 420 mg daily dose group of study 1102 was 78.4% (including CR 
3.9%). In addition, best response of PR with lymphocytosis was reported in 7 subjects;. Median time to 
first documented PR with lymphocytosis or better for subjects who achieved PR or better in the 420 mg 
group was 1.8 months (range: 1.4 to 12.2 months). An IRC review of responses was conducted, at FDA 
request, which was presented in the day 120 response. In this analysis, ORR was lower, 65%, and no 
patient had CR confirmed by IRC. The median PFS is not reached with median follow-up time of 16.4 
months. The 24 month PFS rate is 82%. For the 36 del17p patients, ORR by investigator assessment is 
61%. The median PFS is not reached with median follow-up time of 22.1 months. The 24 months PFS rate 
is 55%. 
As part of the day 120 response the interim analysis report for the randomised study 1112, comparing 
ibrutinib (n=195) vs ofatumumab (n=196) in patients with r/r not appropriate for purine analogue based 
therapy, was provided. The study is considered well-conducted but was terminated early, at 146 PFS 
events, due to a positive interim analysis, with a median time on study at 9.6 and 9.2 months for the 
ibrutinib and ofatumumab arms, respectively. The primary PFS analysis, based on IRC assessment, 
shows a large and statistically highly significant superiority for the ibrutinib arm, p <0.0001, HR = 0.215, 
95% CI: 0.146, 0.317. Median PFS was 8.1 months in the ofatumumab arm while not reached in the 
ibrutinib arm. Kaplan - Meier estimates at  6 months showed a PFS rate of 88% in the ibrutinib arm vs 
65% in the ofatumumab arm.  
The robustness of the primary analysis is supported by performed sensitivity analyses and the general 
consistency in the subgroup analyses. Importantly, outcome in patients with and without del 17p in the 
ibrutinib arm was similar, seen also for refractoriness to purine analogue . These results are, however, 
based on only 26 disease progressions and 9 deaths in the ibrutinib arm, and further follow-up is needed. 
Data on OS were still immature, HR of 0.434 (95% CI: 0.238, 0.789), p=0.0049. Confirmed ORR per IRC 
was remarkably and statistically significantly higher in the ibrutinib arm, (43%), vs the ofatumumab arm 
(4%), p<0.0001, supported by the results of the investigator assessment. In addition a further 30% of 
subjects achived PRL on the ibrutinib arm. In subjects with cytopenia at baseline, a markedly larger 
fraction achieved sustained haematological improvement of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the 
ibrutinib arm, 63% vs 32% and 72% vs 22%, respectively; a clinically relevant finding. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645137/2014  
Page 98/140 
 
 
 
 
 
These results are robust and convincing, with a p-value of 0.0049 and a HR of 0.434 (95% CI: 0.238, 
0.789) in the primary analysis, and supportive sensitivity analyses and a relatively consistent result 
across subgroups. Future study updates will be impacted by the effect of cross-over. 
2.8.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Initially the MAH requested a conditional MA as on the basis on the available data at the time of the 
submission. However with the availability of the updates of trial 1104 where a consistent effect in terms 
of responses and duration of response is noted in MCL and the data made available during the procedure 
from the interim analysis of study 1112 in CLL, the CHMP agreed that enough reassurance was provided 
to support the clinical efficacy of ibrutinib in the CLL and MCL indications as described in the SmPC. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:  
•  Submission of the MCL3001 study report 
• 
Yearly updates of study 1112 results for progression and death should be provided until maturity 
in the ibrutinib arm, e.g. 70%, and preferably also include PFS2, or, at least, time on next 
therapy. 
The CHMP also recommended that reports from studies on potential predictive biomarkers and 
mechanisms of resistance should be submitted when completed. 
2.9.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
MCL 
In MCL the cumulative data from study 1104 as of 15 May 2013 were integrated with data from 9 subjects 
treated in study 04753, comprising a safety population of 120 subjects with r/r MCL. The median duration 
on treatment for the integrated population was 8.3 months (range 0.7, 24.8). A total of 53 (44%) 
subjects received more than 12 months of treatment. Median cumulative dose was 125.2 g (range, 11.8, 
411.6); median dose intensity was 98.2% (factoring in dose reductions and missed doses).

The most commonly reported SOCs were gastrointestinal disorders (83.3%), infections and infestations 
(75.8%), and general disorders and administrative site conditions (73.3%). The most commonly reported 
grade 3-4 SOCs were blood and lymphatic system disorders (30.8%), infections and infestations (21.7%), 
metabolism and nutrition disorders (13.3%), and gastrointestinal disorders (11.7%). 
The most commonly reported events were diarrhoea (52.5%), fatigue (43.3%), nausea (31.7%), 
peripheral oedema (28.3%), constipation (26.7%), and dyspnoea (25.8%). The most commonly reported 
grade 3-4 events were neutropenia (16.7%), thrombocytopenia (11.7%), anaemia (9.2%), diarrhoea 
(5.0%), abdominal pain (5.0%), and pneumonia (5.0%).  
Adverse Events leading to treatment discontinuation:  
Fourteen of the 15 patients (12.5%) that discontinued treatment due to AE did so within 30 days of last 
dose of study drug; out of these, 9 (7.5%) were not related to disease progression. The only event not 
related to MCL/progression occurring twice was subdural hematoma (1.7%). Two patients discontinued 
treatment due to infection-related events. No clear pattern in terms of time on treatment before 
discontinuation is noted. Ten of the 15 patients discontinuing treatment had achieved PR. Overall, 12.5% 
discontinuations due to AE, 7.5% not related to disease progression, is considered a relatively low rate, 
indicating that side effects generally were clinically manageable. 
Adverse Events leading to dose reduction:  
Fourteen percent of patients in study 1104 had the dose reduced due to AE. The only events >2% leading 
to dose reduction were:  neutropenia (grade 3-4, 4.5%) and diarrhoea (grade 3-4, 2.7%). 
Adverse Events over time:  
Importantly, the incidence of new-onset AEs all grade and grade ≥3 was highest during the first cycle and 
generally decreased over time through cycle 1 to 16. This trend was clear for diarrhoea and also infections 
showed a globally slightly decreasing incidence over time

Table 57.  Adverse Events with Subject Incidence ≥ 10% in Either Arm by System Organ 
Class, Preferred Term, and Maximum Severity Grade (Safety Population) 
Grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported for 50.8% of subjects in the ibrutinib arm and 38.7% of subjects in the 
ofatumumab arm. The most common Grade 3 or 4 AE (≥5% of subjects in either treatment arm) was 
neutropenia (ibrutinib: 16.4%, ofatumumab: 13.6%) pneumonia (6.7%, 4.7%), thrombocytopenia 
(5.6%, 4.2%), and anaemia (4.6%, 7.9%).

Grade 3 or 4 AEs reported that occurred at higher incidence (≥2% difference) in the ibrutinib arm than in 
the ofatumumab arm included neutropenia (ibrutinib: 16.4%, ofatumumab: 13.6%), pneumonia (6.7%, 
4.7%), diarrhea (4.1%, 1.6%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0.5%), leukocytosis (3.1%, 0%), atrial 
fibrillation (3.1%, 0%), and lung infection (2.6%, 0%). 
AE leading to treatment discontinuation: Sixteen patients in each treatment arm discontinued due to 
AEs. In the ibrutinib arm, infection was the leading cause. The only events occurring in more than 1 
patient in the ibrutinib arm were pneumonia (n=4) and atrial fibrillation (n=2).  
AE leading to dose reduction: Due to the study design dose reduction was not applicable for the 
ofatumumab arm. In the ibrutinib arm, 4% of patients discontinued treatment due to AEs, with the most 
common AE being diarrhoea (n=3). 
Adverse drug reactions 
MCL 
Overall, 108 (90%) of the 120 treated subjects in the MCL population experienced an AE that was 
considered related to ibrutinib by the investigator. The most common related events were diarrhoea 
(38.3%), fatigue (26.7%), nausea (18.3%), and neutropenia and upper respiratory tract infection 
(14.2% each). Few of these events were Grade 3 or 4 in severity, with the exception of neutropenia; 16 
(13.3%) of the 17 subjects with neutropenia had a Grade 3 or 4 event (Table 57).

CLL 
Overall (studies 1102, 04753), 89.7% of subjects in the CLL/SLL population experienced an AE that was 
considered related to ibrutinib by the investigator. Four events occurred at an incidence greater than 
10%: diarrhoea (39.3%), fatigue (13.7%), arthralgia (12.8%), and contusion (10.3%) (Table 58).

PCYC-1112-CA: Adverse events considered by the investigator to be related to treatment were reported 
for 84.1% of subjects in the ibrutinib arm and 78.5% of subjects in the ofatumumab arm (Table 59). The 
most common treatment-related AE in the ibrutinib arm (≥ 20% of subjects) was diarrhoea (32.8%). The 
most common treatment-related AE in the ofatumumab arm (≥ 20% of subjects) was infusion-related 
reaction (27.7%). The only treatment-related AE that occurred at a higher incidence (≥ 10% difference) 
in the ibrutinib arm than in the ofatumumab arm was diarrhoea (ibrutinib: 32.8%, ofatumumab: 8.4%) 
(Table 59). The only treatment-related AE that occurred at a higher incidence (≥ 10% difference) in the 
ofatumumab arm than in the ibrutinib arm was infusion-related reaction (ibrutinib: 0%, ofatumumab: 
27.7%).

by Preferred Term and Maximum Severity Grade (Safety Population) 
One single list of ADRs has been generated by pooling safety data from 357 patients across studies 1104, 
1102 and 1112, and the use of the following criteria: 
•  Any AE for which the incidence is 5% greater in the ibrutinib arm when compared with the 
ofatumumab arm in the randomized, controlled Phase 3 Study 1112, or 
•  Any AE of any incidence, (including those whose incidence is ≤5% in the ibrutinib arm when 
compared with the ofatumumab arm in Study 1112), which based on biological plausibility, could 
be related to ibrutinib.

The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were diarrhoea, musculoskeletal pain, upper 
respiratory tract infection, bruising, rash, nausea, pyrexia, neutropenia and constipation. The most 
common grade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥ 5%) were anaemia, neutropenia, pneumonia and 
thrombocytopenia. (table … below by system organ class and frequency defined as: very common 
(≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100). Within each frequency

Fifty-seven (47.5%) of 120 subjects in the integrated MCL population experienced a treatment-emergent 
haemorrhage event of any severity; the most common were contusion (17.5%) and epistaxis (10.0%). 
Major haemorrhage was reported in 8 (6.7%) patients, whereof 3 led to discontinuation of study drug. 
Platelet counts were below 50 in 1 or 2 of these patients. Confounders for bleeding were present in all 
cases. 
In study 1102, haemorrhagic events were reported in 65 (56%) of subjects, with major events in 5 (4%), 
including 2 patients with subdural hematoma. Upon inspection of tabulated data on the major events, 
strong confounders were present for all events except for 1 of the subdural hematoma events.  
In study 1112, haemorrhagic events were reported for 43.6% of subjects in the ibrutinib arm and 11.5% 
of subjects in the ofatumumab arm. Major haemorrhagic events were reported for 1% of subjects (n=2; 
subdural hematoma at platelets 64, and postoperative haemorrhage at platelets 105) in the ibrutinib arm 
and 1.6% of subjects (n=3) in the ofatumumab arm. 
Haemorrhage, also in the absence of thrombocytopenia, is considered an ADR related to ibrutinib. The 
proposed wording in SmPC 4.4 is considered appropriate. The contributing mechanism is not clear. 
•  Other malignancies 
In studies 04753, 1104 and 1102 (n=309), additional malignancies were reported in 27 (8.7%) subjects. 
An imbalance between indications is noted with 19 (16.2%) and 5 (4.2%) patients reported with 
additional malignancy in CLL/SLL and MCL, respectively, mainly due to a higher incidence of skin 
carcinoma in the CLL/SLL group. In the 1104 study in MCL, the incidence of additional malignancies was 
4% whereas 16% noted in the 1102 CLL/SLL study.  
Reporting of other malignancies was initially required only during the treatment emergent period in study 
1112; an amendment requiring the reporting of other malignancies during the entire study period was 
implemented as late as 3 months prior to data cut-off. In the 1112 study “other malignancy” in terms of 
skin cancer was noted in 5% in the ibrutinib arm vs 2% in the ofatumumab arm, and non-skin cancers in 
2.6% vs 1%, respectively during a median duration of treatment of 8.6 months for the ibrutinib arm vs 
5.3 months for the ofatumumab arm.  An overestimation of the difference in the incidence of other 
malignancies between the two study arms cannot be excluded (The risk is included in the RMP). 
•  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
One single case of PML, in a 57-year-old woman with heavily pretreated r/r del 17p CLL on day 323, in the 
total experience of 1800 patients has been observed, however prior rituximab and the disease itself are 
considered strong confounders. 
•  Diarrhoea 
In MCL, gastrointestinal side effects were the most common seen during ibrutinib therapy, with diarrhoea 
being the prominent event, although most patients, absolutely and relatively, experienced the event 
during the first 3 months of treatment. However, only 6 events being grade 3 (no grade 4) and only 3 dose 
reductions and no discontinuations due to the event are considered reassuring. 
Also in CLL/SLL diarrhoea was the most frequently reported AE (55% in 1102, 48% in 1112). However, in 
1102 only 4 patients had grade 3 events, dose reduction was rare (2) and no patient discontinued 
treatment due to the event. The incidence rate declined markedly after 3 months of treatment. In study 
1112, 4% of patients were reported with grade 3+4 events, 1 patient discontinued treatment due to 
diarrhoea and 3 had the dosed reduced. The AE of diarrhoea is deemed clinically manageable.

• 
Infections 
Infections occurred in 76% of MCL patients with grade 3-4 in 22%, with a relatively constant incidence 
rate during 1-24 months. Pneumonia was the most prevalent event with 17 (14%) cases overall with 2 
leading to death. Overall 3 patients died from infectious events. 
In study 1102, infections occurred in 76% of patients with grade ≥3 in 38%. The incidence rate of 
new-onset grouped infectious AEs remained relatively stable over time. Fatal outcome was reported for 3 
cases, all related to pneumonia. Pooling of pneumonia-related events showed an overall incidence rate of 
21% with grade ≥3 pneumonia in 17% of subjects. 
In study 1112, AEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC were reported for 70.3% of subjects in the 
ibrutinib arm and 54.5% of subjects in the ofatumumab arm, but no large difference in terms of grade ≥3 
or fatal events were noted between study arms. 
Considering ibrutinib’s MoA, an increased susceptibility to infections might be expected. Considering 
infection as an ADR for ibrutinib is reasonable. 
Lymphocytosis and leukostasis 
Lymphocytosis (transient) is part of ibrutinib’s MoA and was in MCL reported in 41 patients (34.5%); in 13 
(32%) of these lymphocytosis was ongoing at the cut-off (censored). Median time to treatment-emergent 
lymphocytosis was 1.1 weeks but it is noted that lymphocytosis occurred as late as after 64.3 weeks. 
Median duration was 8 weeks with a maximum duration of 35 weeks. 
In study 1102, a reversible increase in lymphocyte counts (≥50% increase from baseline and above 
absolute count 5,000/mcL) was reported in 88 (75%) patients. Median time to the phenomenon was 1.1 
weeks but occurred as late as after 16 weeks; median duration was 18.7 weeks with an upper range of 
104 weeks. 
At the time of the MAA submission, 4 events of leukostasis had been reported in clinical studies of ibrutinib 
to that date: 2 patients with MCL and 2 with CLL. Three of the 4 events were possibly confounded by 
transformation/progressive disease. In study 1112, no event of leukostasis was reported in the ibrutinib 
arm. In the updated results, the Applicant informs that to date a total of 5 isolated cases of leukostasis in 
subjects treated with ibrutinib have been reported. Three subjects experienced concurrent intracranial 
haemorrhage.  
Cardiac AEs 
In MCL, cardiac AEs were reported in 21% of patients with grade 3-4 in 9%. The only “cardiac-related” 
death was due to pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and hypertensive heart disease. Atrial 
fibrillation was the most commonly reported event (n=11; 9%); myocardial infarction, Torsade de 
pointes and ventricular tachycardia were reported in 1 patient each. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645137/2014  
Page 111/140 
 
 
 
 
 
In study 1102, cardiac AEs were reported in 19.7% of subjects with atrial fibrillation (5.1%) being the 
most common. In study 1112, AEs events in the SOC of Cardiac Disorders were reported for 11.8% of 
subjects in the ibrutinib arm and 7.9% of subjects in the ofatumumab arm. A higher subject incidence of 
atrial fibrillation was observed in the ibrutinib arm (10 subjects [5.1%]) compared with the ofatumumab 
arm (1 subject [0.5%]). These events were assessed with maximum severity as grade 3 or 4 for 3.1% 
(n=6) and 0% (n=0) of subjects, respectively. Six of the 10 subjects in the ibrutinib arm experienced 
SAEs of atrial fibrillation. One event resulted in study drug discontinuation for a subject in the ibrutinib 
arm. 
Ibrutinib is associated with exposure-dependent QTc shortening, prolonged PR interval and reduction in 
heart rate. Although all these effects are of limited magnitude, and no obvious and suspicious AE pattern 
is identified, especially the clinical consequences of QTc shortening generally remain obscure.  
In the setting of a randomised trial with similar baseline characteristics, supported by phase Ib/II data, it 
must be assumed that the clearly higher incidence of atrial fibrillation/flutter in the ibrutinib arm is 
associated with therapy. This is correctly included in the SmPC 4.8. However, whether this is related to 
the QT-shortening property of the drug remains to be elucidated. Considering the obscure clinical 
significance of the QT shortening associated with ibrutinib, cardiac safety should be part of the RMP. A 
thorough QT-study (PCI-32765CLL1007) will be conducted as a post-approval commitment. 
Hypersensitivity 
Due to the low frequency of individual events suggestive of hypersensitivity in combination with the lack 
of a placebo control, and uncertainties regarding possible co-medication/exposure to environmental 
factors etc, a definitive causal relationship with ibrutinib cannot be concluded. Comparison with data 
obtained with ofatumumab is of little value. 
Inclusion of hypersensitivity as an important potential risk in the RMP seems reasonable. 
Eye disorders 
The incidence of AEs in the SOC of eye disorders was double as high in the ibrutinib arm (36% vs 19%); 
none was grade ≥3. Further, ocular toxicity was noted in animal studies. Therefore, inclusion of “vision 
blurred” in the SmPC 4.8 is endorsed, but the SOC of eye disorders should also be part of the RMP for 
further vigilance. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
MCL 
Of the 17 (14%) patients that died during treatment or within 30 days of treatment discontinuation, all in 
study 1104, 12 died from MCL or events associated with disease progression. The remaining causes of 
death were cardiac arrest (1; pulmonary embolism identified at autopsy), hypovolemic shock (1), 
infection (3; pneumonia 2, sepsis 1). No obvious pattern in terms of time on treatment is noted. Therefore, 
5 (4.3%) patients in the integrated population of 116 patients with r/r MCL and treated with the 520 mg 
daily dose died for reasons not related to PD during treatment or within 30 days of treatment 
discontinuation. Out of these 5 deaths, 3 were due to infection. 
CLL 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645137/2014  
Page 112/140 
 
 
 
 
 
In total in study 1102, 9 patients died during or within 30 days of treatment, whereof 3 in the setting of 
progressive disease. The cause of death in the remaining 6 (5% of the study population) was related to 
infection in 4 (pneumonia 3, sepsis 1) and to secondary malignancy in 2 (malignant histiocytosis, PTCL). 
None of the subjects with MCL in Study 04753 died. 
In study 1112, the fraction of patients with fatal SAEs was numerically slightly more common in the 
ofatumumab arm; 8.4% vs 6.2% in the ibrutinib arm. The most common AEs leading to death in either 
treatment arm were pneumonia (ibrutinib: 1.5%, ofatumumab: 1.0%), CLL (disease progression) (1.0%, 
1.0%), and sepsis (1.0%, 0%). No event was reported at a frequency ≥2%. This result is considered 
reassuring. 
Other Serious Adverse Events:  
MCL 
SAEs were reported in 59% of patients; grade 3-4 in 38%. The most commonly reported SAEs (Preferred 
Terms) (excluding disease progression) were atrial fibrillation (5.8%), pneumonia (5.0%), febrile 
neutropenia (3.3%), and urinary tract infection (3.3%). The highest frequencies of grade 3-4 events were 
reported for atrial fibrillation (5%) and pneumonia (4.2%). Generally, the SOC with most all grade as well 
as grade 3-4 SAEs was infections and infestations.

One or more SAEs were reported in 67 of the 117 subjects (57.3%) in the CLL/SLL population. The 
majority of individual events occurred at an incidence of 2% or less; those more prevalent are shown in 
Table 62. The most common serious events were pneumonia (12.8%), febrile neutropenia (4.3%), 
bacteraemia, cellulitis, and sinusitis (all 3.4%), and sepsis (2.6%). Overall, the most common events 
were infectious. The SAE most frequently considered related to ibrutinib was pneumonia (2.6%).

Study 1112: Serious AEs were reported for 41.5% in the ibrutinib arm and 30.4% of subjects in the 
ofatumumab arm. The most common SAE in both treatment arms was pneumonia (ibrutinib: 8.7%, 
ofatumumab: 6.3%). SAEs for atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, lung infection and urinary tract infection 
were reported with ≥2% higher frequency in the ibrutinib arm.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
MCL 
A review of haematological parameters during treatment with ibrutinib was conducted on the 120 
subjects in the integrated MCL population. Laboratory hematologic toxicities were not uncommon in the 
integrated MCL population, although most were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Thrombocytopenia of any grade 
was observed in 55.8% of treated subjects, followed by neutropenia (43.7%) and anaemia (38.3%) 
(Table 64). Neutropenia was the most common Grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity (23.5%). 
Thrombocytopenia grade ≥3 was reported in 13% of patients. Twelve (10.1%) subjects experienced 
treatment-emergent Grade 4 neutropenia. Six (5.0%) subjects experienced treatment-emergent Grade 4 
thrombocytopenia. Four (3.3%) subjects had treatment-emergent Grade 3 anaemia and there was no 
reports of Grade 4 anaemia. 
Table 65.  Subject Incidence of Treatment-emergent Hematological Laboratory Low 
Abnormalities (Studies 1104 and 04753) 
CLL 
A review of haematological parameters and shift analysis during treatment with ibrutinib was conducted 
on the 116 subjects in the integrated CLL/SLL population. Thrombocytopenia was the most common 
hematologic toxicity (all grades) observed in the CLL/SLL population (59.5%), followed by neutropenia 
(56.0%) and anaemia (48.3%). Neutropenia had the highest incidence of severity Grade 3 and higher 
(31.9%). There was no Grade 3 and higher anaemia (Table 65).

(Studies 1102 and 04753). 
During treatment median haemoglobin, and to certain extent also median platelet levels, increased while 
median ANC remained within normal range.

Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 decreases in platelet counts were reported for 5.1% of subjects in the 
ibrutinib arm and 9.9% of subjects in the ofatumumab arm. Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 decreases 
in ANCs were observed for 23.1% of subjects in the ibrutinib arm and 26.2% of subjects in the 
ofatumumab arm. No subject in either treatment arm had treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 decreases in 
haemoglobin (Table 66). Grade 3 and 4 haemoglobin and platelet decreases were defined as reduction 
from baseline of ≥ 50% and ≥ 75%, respectively (IWCLL 2008 criteria).

Clinical chemistry

Concerning serum chemistries, the most common abnormalities of any grade were creatinine elevation 
(74.2%), hypocalcaemia (56.7%), hyperglycaemia (41.7%), hypomagnesaemia (39.0%), low creatinine 
clearance (33.3%), and hypernatraemia (30.8%). Most of these abnormalities were Grade 1 or 2. The 
only notable Grade 3 or higher laboratory abnormality was hyponatremia (5.8%). Other Grade 3 or 4 
abnormalities occurred in 4 subjects or less. 
Table 68.  Treatment-emergent Blood Chemistry Abnormalities in Subjects with MCL (Studies 
1104 and 04753) 
A shift analysis of creatinine clearance showed that 77.5% of subjects maintained their baseline grade, 
18.3% shifted from ≥ 60 mL/min to between 60 and 30 mL/min, and 1.7% shifted to <30 mL/min at 
some time during treatment. This analysis presents only worst value and does not portray reversibility or 
irreversibility.Deterioration of kidney function did not seem to be a major side effect of ibrutinib in this 
patient population. 
No patient fulfilled Hy’s law. Although median serum bilirubin and AST remained relatively constant over 
time, acknowledging the decreasing number of patients at risk, median ALT increased beyond cycle 17 
(data not shown).

The most common treatment-emergent serum chemistry abnormalities for the CLL/SLL population were 
hypocalcaemia (69.8%), hyperglycaemia (54.3%), hypomagnesaemia (39.5%), and AST elevation 
(31.9%). Most of these abnormalities were Grade 1 or 2. The most common Grade 3 or higher 
abnormalities were hyperglycaemia (6.9%), hypophosphataemia (6.1%), hyponatraemia (6.0%) and 
hypocalcaemia (4.3%). All other Grade 3/4 abnormalities occurred in 1 or 2 subjects each. No concerns 
for renal or hepatic toxicity were noted. Median serum creatinine levels were roughly stable over time, 
also in patients with baseline creatinine clearance value <60 mL/min. Median ALT, AST and bilirubin 
levels were also roughly stable over time. One subject transiently met the criteria for drug-induced liver 
injury (ALT/AST criteria and total bilirubin criteria both met and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2 times upper 
limit of normal on any day) but the event was attributed to sepsis.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There were no dedicated PD interaction studies; with respect to PK interactions, see section 2.4.2. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
MCL: Fifteen (12.5%) of the 120 subjects in the integrated MCL population discontinued treatment due to 
AEs; all were in Study 1104. Fourteen of these subjects had AEs that occurred within 30 days of last dose 
of ibrutinib. One subject had a discontinuation due to cardiac failure congestive more than 30 days after 
last study drug dose. The most frequent AE leading to treatment discontinuation was subdural hematoma 
(1.7%). Four of the AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were considered possibly related to 
ibrutinib: pneumonia, sepsis, subdural hematoma, and metastatic neoplasm (associated with liver 
adenocarcinoma, an additional primary malignancy). See also section on adverse events. 
CLL: Thirteen (11.1%) of the 117 subjects in the CLL/SLL population experienced an AE that led to 
discontinuation of study treatment. The study day of the precipitating event ranged from Day 9 to Day 
589. Seven of the 13 events were infectious in nature and 2 events were related to disease progression. 
Five of the 13 subjects recovered from the event, 5 subjects died, and the event was ongoing at last 
contact in 3 subjects. Only 1 of the events leading to treatment discontinuation (influenza) was 
considered possibly related to ibrutinib. 
PCYC-1112: Adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation, including AEs with fatal outcomes, 
were reported for 8.2% of subjects in the ibrutinib arm and 8.4% of subjects in the ofatumumab arm . The 
most common AEs leading to treatment discontinuation in either treatment armwere pneumonia 
(ibrutinib: 2.1%, ofatumumab: 2.1%) and sepsis (1%, 0%). All other AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation occurred in only 1 subject each in a given treatment arm. See also section on adverse 
events.

2.9.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In CLL/SLL, the initially (at MAA) submitted safety database for ibrutinib monotherapy consisted of 117 
patients, including 51 patients at the intended 420 mg daily dose (primary safety population) and 34 
patients at a higher daily dose of 840 mg. The median duration on treatment for the integrated population 
was 14.7 months and ranged up to 29 months. During the procedure, the study 1112 CSR was provided, 
adding randomised data from 195 patients to the total safety database. At study cut-off, the median 
duration of ibrutinib exposure was 8.6 months while 5.3 months for ofatumumab. 
There are limited data on the effects of IMBRUVICA overdose. No maximum tolerated dose was reached 
in the phase 1 study in which patients received up to 12.5 mg/kg/day (1,400 mg). There is no specific 
antidote for IMBRUVICA. Patients who ingested more than the recommended dose should be closely 
monitored and given appropriate supportive treatment. 
Patients with severe cardiovascular disease were excluded from IMBRUVICA clinical studies. 
In summary the safety profile is based on pooled data from 357 patients treated with IMBRUVICA in two 
phase 2 clinical studies and one randomised phase 3 study. Patients treated for MCL received IMBRUVICA 
at 560 mg once daily and patients treated for CLL/SLL received IMBRUVICA at 420 mg once daily. All 
patients received IMBRUVICA until disease progression or no longer tolerated. 
The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (≥ 20%,) were diarrhoea, musculoskeletal pain, upper 
respiratory tract infection, bruising, rash, nausea, pyrexia, neutropenia and constipation. The most 
common grade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥ 5%) were anaemia, neutropenia, pneumonia and 
thrombocytopenia. 
Overall grade ≥3 events, AEs leading to dose reduction, and SAEs including grade ≥3 were all numerically 
more common in the ibrutinib arm. Incidence of discontinuation of study drug due to AE was similar 
between study arms (8%) while fatal AEs were slightly more common in the ofatumumab arm (8% vs 
6%). Thus, while frequency as well as severity of side effects was more pronounced in the ibrutinib arm, 
discontinuation rate due to AE was not worryingly high and similar between study arms, indicating that 
the toxicity of ibrutinib is reasonably clinically manageable.   
AE patterns were generally relatively similar in the two indications, dominated by GI symptoms, mainly 
diarrhoea, and in a conservative interpretation, associated with infections. Infections, cardiac AEs, 
haemorrhage, ocular events, and new primary malignancies (especially for the CLL/SLL indication) 
deserve further attention. (see RMP)  Importantly, AE incidence generally decreased over time, and with 
relatively low discontinuation rates and dose reductions due to AEs, side effects overall seem clinically 
manageable by dose modifications as described in the SmPC section 4.2. 
With a cut-off at 65 years, grade ≥3 events, SAEs and death within 30 days of last dose were all more 
common in the elderly group; notably, SAEs grade ≥3 were more than twice as common. A higher 
frequency of AEs with increasing age is generally an expected finding. 
Only 22% (n=27) of the subjects in the integrated population were female, making an evaluation of AEs 
by sex difficult. It is noted that  grade ≥3 AEs, any SAE and grade ≥3 AEs were slightly more common 
among females; 82% vs 75%, 63% vs 58%, and 56% vs 50%, respectively.

Creatinine >2.0 x ULN was an exclusion criterion in study 1104. It is noted that overall AEs grade ≥3 and 
death within 30 days of last dose were more common in patients with creatinine clearance below 30 
mL/min. In a comparison of events, the following notable differences in the incidence of grade 3 and 4 AEs 
between subjects with lower versus higher creatinine clearance were identified: dyspnoea (12.5% versus 
1.0%), diarrhoea (12.5% versus 3.1%), and anaemia (16.7% versus 7.3%), respectively. These findings 
might be confounded by age-related factors. 
The AE profile in the randomised study 1112, overall and grade ≥3, was qualitatively consistent with was 
seen in the phase Ib/II study 1102 but generally less prominent. However, the 2 studies are not fully 
comparable due to various dosages in the 1102 study. 
IMBRUVICA therapy should be withheld for any new onset or worsening grade ≥ 3 non-haematological 
toxicity, grade 3 or greater neutropenia with infection or fever, or grade 4 haematological toxicities. Once 
the symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to grade 1 or baseline (recovery), IMBRUVICA therapy may be 
reinitiated at the starting dose. If the toxicity reoccurs, the once daily dose should be reduced by one 
capsule (140 mg). A second reduction of dose by 140 mg may be considered as needed. If these toxicities 
persist or recur following two dose reductions, discontinue the medicinal product. 
Recommended dose modifications are described below:

Further follow-up to establish long-term safety will be provided within 1112 study update and in the 
upcoming MCL3001. 
There have been reports of haemorrhagic events in patients treated with IMBRUVICA, both with and 
without thrombocytopenia. These include minor haemorrhagic events such as contusion, epistaxis, and 
petechiae; and major haemorrhagic events including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage, 
and haematuria. 
Patients were excluded from participation in IMBRUVICA phase 2 and 3 studies if they required warfarin 
or other vitamin K antagonists. Warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be administered 
concomitantly with IMBRUVICA. Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be 
avoided. Use of IMBRUVICA in patients requiring other anticoagulants or medicinal products that inhibit 
platelet function may increase the risk of bleeding, and particular care should be taken if anticoagulant 
therapy is used. Patients with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied. 
IMBRUVICA should be held at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery 
and the risk of bleeding. 
Cases of leukostasis have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. (see also 
Pharmacodynamics discussion) A high number of circulating lymphocytes (> 400,000/mcL) may confer 
increased risk. Consider temporarily holding IMBRUVICA. Patients should be closely monitored. 
Administer supportive care including hydration and/or cytoreduction as indicated. 
Infections (including sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, bacterial, viral, or fungal infections) were observed in 
patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Some of these infections have been associated with hospitalisation and 
death. Most patients with fatal infections also had neutropenia. Patients should be monitored for fever, 
neutropenia and infections and appropriate anti-infective therapy should be instituted as indicated.

Treatment-emergent grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia) were 
reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Monitor complete blood counts monthly. 
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA, particularly in 
patients with cardiac risk factors, acute infections, and a previous history of atrial fibrillation. Periodically 
monitor all patients clinically for atrial fibrillation. Patients who develop arrhythmic symptoms or new 
onset of dyspnoea should be evaluated clinically and if indicated have an electrocardiogram (ECG) 
performed. 
In patients with pre-existing atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulant therapy, alternative treatment 
options to IMBRUVICA should be considered. In patients who develop atrial fibrillation on therapy with 
IMBRUVICA a thorough assessment of the risk for thromboembolic disease should be undertaken. In 
patients at high risk and where alternatives to IMBRUVICA are non-suitable, tightly controlled treatment 
with anticoagulants should be considered. 
In a phase 2 study, ECG evaluations showed IMBRUVICA produced a mild decrease in QTcF interval 
(mean 7.5 ms). Although the underlying mechanism and safety relevance of this finding is not known, 
clinicians should use clinical judgment when assessing whether to prescribe ibrutinib to patients at risk 
from further shortening their QTc duration (e.g., Congenital Short QT Syndrome or patients with a family 
history of such a syndrome). 
In studies 04753, 1104 and 1102 (n=309), additional malignancies were reported in 27 (8.7%) subjects. 
An imbalance between indications is noted with 19 (16.2%) and 5 (4.2%) patients reported with 
additional malignancy in CLL/SLL and MCL, respectively, mainly due to a higher incidence of skin 
carcinoma in the CLL/SLL group. Increased incidences of other malignant neoplasms have been 
frequently reported in patients with CLL/SLL and non-Hodgkin’s Lymphomas; in particular for CLL/SLL, 
retrospective analysis indicated an approximate 8-fold increase of skin carcinomas and 2-fold higher 
frequency for all cancers excluding skin carcinomas compared to an age- and sex-matched control 
population. 
In the 1112 study other malignancy in terms of skin cancer was noted in 5% in the ibrutinib arm vs 2% 
in the ofatumumab arm, and non-skin cancers in 2.6% vs 1%, respectively. Current data therefore 
indicate that treatment with ibrutinib may be associated with an increased risk for development of 
secondary malignancies, especially skin cancers. However, and importantly, in the 1112 study, the longer 
median duration of treatment for the ibrutinib arm vs the ofatumumab arm (8.6 and 5.3 months, 
respectively) and circumstances related to the reporting procedure for “other malignancies” confound the 
interpretation of the results, and an overestimation of the difference in the incidence of “other 
malignancies” between the two study arms is possible. Therefore, and as further controlled data is 
expected, it is considered reasonable to keep “Other malignancies” as an important potential risk in the 
RMP not to include this term in the SmPC at present. 
Special attention was paid to ocular events as of the suspected non-clinical signal. Due to the age of the 
patient group and the disease population AEs in the eye is not unexpected and ocular AEs were reported 
for 31 (27.9%) subjects in Study 1104. None of the reported events were, according to the applicant, 
considered related to the treatment with ibrutinib. Concerning both the pancreas and corneal signal the 
risk to patients is regarded as low due to species pre-disposition, exposure margins and clinical safety 
data.  
In the clinic 68.3% of patients experience skin and subcutaneous tissue SAEs, which was in line with 
non-clinical signals for skin SAEs/toxicity.

Ibrutinib is clinically associated with exposure-dependent QTc shortening, prolonged PR interval and 
reduction in heart rate. Cardiac AEs were reported in approximately 20% of patients with atrial fibrillation 
in 5-9%; Torsade de pointes and ventricular tachycardia were reported in 1 patient each in the MCL 
population. Considering the obscure clinical significance of the QT shortening associated with ibrutinib, 
cardiac safety should be part of the RMP. In contrast, the preclinical data package shows hERG inhibition 
at concentrations above clinical exposure and in vivo safety pharmacology generated in dog also show 
cardiac effects.   
With a cut-off at 65 years, only grade ≥3 events were slightly more common in the elderly group. A higher 
incidence of grade ≥3 dehydration and atrial fibrillation among the elderly is not surprising. 
By preferred term, the only notable differences in the incidence of grade 3 and 4 AEs between subjects 
with lower versus higher creatinine clearance were, respectively, sinusitis (13.0% vs 2.1%) and 
hypertension (13.0% vs 6.4%). These findings might be confounded by age-related factors. 
No specific clinical studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. Patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment were treated in IMBRUVICA clinical studies. No dose adjustment is needed for 
patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (greater than 30 mL/min creatinine clearance). 
Hydration should be maintained and serum creatinine levels monitored periodically. Administer 
IMBRUVICA to patients with severe renal impairment (less than 30 mL/min creatinine clearance) only if 
the benefit outweighs the risk and monitor patients closely for signs of toxicity. There are no data in 
patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis (see section 5.2).  
Ibrutinib is metabolised in the liver. Patients with serum aspartate transaminase (AST/SGOT) or alanine 
transaminase (ALT/SGPT) ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) were excluded from IMBRUVICA clinical 
studies. In a dedicated hepatic impairment trial in non-cancer patients, preliminary data showed an 
increase in ibrutinib exposure (see section 5.2). For patients with mild liver impairment (Child-Pugh 
class A), the recommended dose is 280 mg daily (two capsules). For patients with moderate liver 
impairment (Child-Pugh class B), the recommended dose is 140 mg daily (one capsule). Monitor patients 
for signs of IMBRUVICA toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed. It is not recommended 
to administer IMBRUVICA to patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). 
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data 
are available. 
The safety data bases for both indications derive from a relatively short follow-up; long term safety is to 
be addressed in future study updates (see RMP) and within the PSURs. 
Submission of the study report from the planned thorough QTc study (PCI-32765CLL1007) when 
completed is awaited in order to clarify concerns discussed in connection to the Pharmacology section. 
A specific safety issue relates to the concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers as discussed in the 
Pharmacology section is appropriately addressed in the SmPC with dose modifications and warnings.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics section 4.8.

2.9.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile is based on pooled data from 357 patients treated with IMBRUVICA in two phase 2 
clinical studies and one randomised phase 3 study. Patients treated for MCL received IMBRUVICA at 560 
mg once daily and patients treated for CLL received IMBRUVICA at 420 mg once daily. All patients 
received IMBRUVICA until disease progression or no longer tolerated. The most commonly occurring 
adverse reactions (≥ 20%,) were diarrhoea, musculoskeletal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, 
bruising, rash, nausea, pyrexia, neutropenia and constipation. The most common grade 3/4 adverse 
reactions (≥ 5%) were anaemia, neutropenia, pneumonia and thrombocytopenia. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
-  Submission of the study report from the planned thorough QTc study (PCI-32765CLL1007) when 
completed. 
2.10.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
2.11.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 3.1, the PRAC considers by consensus 
that the risk management system for ibrutinib (Imbruvica) in: 
• 
the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MCL  
and the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have received 
at least one prior therapy, or in first line in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in 
patients unsuitable for chemo immunotherapy could be acceptable with some minor amendments 
as detailed in the attached PRAC Rapporteur’s RMP AR.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice, but considered that it would not be necessary to include the studies on 
potential predictive biomarkers for responders and/or drug/disease resistance in the Pharmacovigilance 
Plan as a required additional pharmacovigilance activity.  
Following the CHMP meeting the applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by the PRAC 
and the CHMP in RMP version 3.2 with the following content:

The SmPC (Sections 4.4 and 4.8) states that 
patients should be closely monitored. Supportive 
care should be administer including hydration and/or 
cytoreduction as indicated, and/or consider 
temporarily holding ibrutinib. 
The SmPC (Section 4.4) states that warfarin or other 
vitamin K antagonists should not be administered 
concomitantly with ibrutinib. Supplements such as 
fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be 
avoided. Use ibrutinib with caution in patients 
requiring anticoagulants or medications that inhibit 
platelet function. Patients with congenital bleeding 
diathesis have not been studied. Ibrutinib should be 
withheld for at least 3 to 7 days pre and 
post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery 
and the risk of bleeding. 
The SmPC (Section 4.4 and 4.5) states that the 
concomitant use of ibrutinib with strong or moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors and moderate and strong and 
moderate inducers should be avoided when possible.

The SmPC (Sections 4.4 and 4.8) states that 
treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias 
(neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia) were 
reported in patients treated with ibrutinib. Complete 
blood counts should be monitored monthly. 
The SmPC (Section 4.4) states that infections 
(including sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, bacterial, 
viral, or fungal infections) have been observed in 
patients treated with ibrutinib. Some of these 
infections have been associated with hospitalisation 
and death. Most patients with fatal infections also 
had neutropenia. Patients should be monitored for 
fever and infections and appropriate anti-infective 
therapy should be instituted as indicated.  
The SmPC (Section 4.4) states that atrial fibrillation 
and atrial flutter have been reported in patients 
treated with ibrutinib, particularly in patients with 
cardiac risk factors, acute infections, and a previous 
history of atrial fibrillation. Periodically monitor 
patients clinically for atrial fibrillation. If clinically 
indicated, the use of anti coagulants or anti platelet 
agents may be considered for the 
thromboprophylaxis of atrial fibrillation. In a Phase 2 
study, ECG evaluation showed, ibrutinib produced a 
decrease in QTc interval.

Missing Information: 
Use in paediatric patients 
Use during breastfeeding 
The safety and efficacy of ibrutinib in children aged < 
18 years have not yet been established. (SmPC Section 
4.2). 
The SmPC (Section 4.6) states that it is not known 
whether ibrutinib or its metabolites are excreted in 
human milk. A risk to breastfeeding 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breastfeeding 
should be discontinued during treatment with 
ibrutinib.  
Use in patients with severe 
cardiac disease 
The SmPC (Section 4.2) states that patients with 
severe cardiovascular disease were excluded from 
ibrutinib clinical trials. 
Use in patients with severe 
renal impairment 
Use in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment 
The SmPC (Section 4.2) states that no specific 
clinical studies have been conducted in patients with 
renal impairment, but patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment were treated in ibrutinib 
clinical trials. No dose adjustment is needed for 
patients with mild or moderate renal impairment 
(>30 mL/min creatinine clearance), but ibrutinib 
should be administered to patients with severe renal 
impairment (<30 mL/min creatinine clearance) only 
if the benefit outweighs the risk and patients should 
be monitored closely. Hydration should be 
maintained and serum creatinine levels monitored 
periodically. There are no data in patients with 
severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis.  
The SmPC (Section 4.2) state that ibrutinib is 
metabolised in the liver. Hepatic impairment has 
been associated with substantial increase in ibrutinib 
exposure. For patients with mild liver impairment 
(Child Pugh class A), the recommended dose is 280 
mg daily (2 capsules). For patients with moderate 
liver impairment (Child Pugh class B), the 
recommended dose is 140 mg daily (1 capsule). 
Patients should be monitored and dose modification 
guidance followed as needed. Ibrutinib should not be 
administered to patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class C).

Page 135/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MCL: In a single arm ibrutinib monotherapy study conducted in patients with relapsed / refractory MCL an  
ORR of 67.6% a PFS rate of 63% (95% CI 53, 71%) at 6 months and a duration of response of 17.5 
months were observed. In an update on time-dependent outcomes as of 14 March 2014, the beneficial 
effects were sustained. 
The treatment effect seemed fairly consistent throughout the analysed subgroups, including region, 
relapsed or refractory disease, bulky disease, number of prior regimens, simplified MIPI score, and prior 
therapy with bortezomib or lenalidomide. 
CLL/SLL:  Ibrutinib in a randomised study in CLL patients showed a statistically highly significant 
superiority, with a PFS HR = 0.215, compared to ofatumumab. Median PFS was 8.1 months in the 
ofatumumab arm while not reached in the ibrutinib arm. Kaplan- Meier estimates at 1 year showed a PFS 
rate of 66% in the ibrutinib arm vs 6% in the ofatumumab arm. In secondary analyses OS data also 
showed a favourable effect for the ibrutinib arm with a HR of 0.434. Confirmed ORR was remarkably and 
statistically significantly higher in the ibrutinib arm, (43%), vs the ofatumumab arm (4%). 
The robustness of the primary analysis is supported by performed sensitivity analyses and the general 
consistency in the subgroup analyses. Importantly, outcome in patients with and without del 17p in the 
ibrutinib arm was similar, independently of resistance to purine analogue. In subjects with cytopenia at 
baseline, a markedly larger fraction achieved sustained haematological improvement of neutropenia or 
thrombocytopenia in the ibrutinib arm, 63% vs 32% and 72% vs 22%, respectively; a clinically relevant 
finding.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The evaluation of the efficacy of ibrutinib in r/r MCL is based on non-randomised data. A randomized trial 
is currently ongoing, evaluating ibrutinib vs temsirolimus, and results should be provided, as a 
post-approval measure by 1Q 2016.  
The important results in the CLL population are from an interim analysis and are based on only 26 disease 
progressions and 9 deaths in the ibrutinib arm, and further follow-up will be provided. The early 
availability of the positive interim analysis, imposes uncertainties on the final analysis as future study 
updates will be impacted by the effect of cross-over, however the outstanding results seen are already 
sufficiently robust. (see Annex II of the opinion) 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The reported AE pattern is roughly similar across clinical trials and indications. The most commonly 
occurring adverse reactions are: pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, anaemia, dizziness, headache, haemorrhage, bruising, petechiae, diarrhoea, 
vomiting, stomatitis, nausea, constipation, rash, arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia and peripheral 
oedema. 
Discontinuation rate due to AE was at acceptable levels and similar across indications (4% of MCL patients 
discontinued treatment due to AEs, and 8% in both treatment groups in study 1112 in CLL/SLL, indicating 
that the toxicity of ibrutinib is reasonably clinically manageable with dose modifications. 
As ibrutinib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4, there are a significant changes in ibrutinib exposure seen 
for CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645137/2014  
Page 136/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In the clinical studies additional malignancies were reported. In the 1104 study in MCL, the incidence of 
additional malignancies was 4%; In the 1112 study other malignancy in terms of skin cancer was noted 
in 5% in the ibrutinib arm vs 2% in the ofatumumab arm, and non-skin cancers in 2.6% vs 1%, 
respectively. However, in the 1112 study, the longer median duration of treatment for the ibrutinib arm 
vs the ofatumumab arm (8.6 and 5.3 months, respectively) and circumstances related to the reporting 
procedure for “other malignancies” confound the interpretation of the results, and an overestimation of 
the difference in the incidence of “other malignancies” between the two study arms is possible. CLL is 
associated with an increased incidence of skin cancer assumed to be related to immune suppressive 
effects of the disease and treatment, e.g. with alkylating agents. Therefore, and as further controlled data 
are expected, the risk of “Other malignancies” is added in the RMP and events will be addressed as events 
of special interest in ongoing and future clinical trials (see RMP). 
Ibrutinib is clinically associated with exposure-dependent QTc shortening, prolonged PR interval and 
reduction in heart rate. Cardiac AEs were reported in approximately 20% of patients with atrial fibrillation 
in 5-9%; Torsade de pointes and ventricular tachycardia were reported in 1 patient each in the MCL 
population. Cardiac safety is part of the RMP.  
A weakness of the safety data bases for both indications is the relatively short follow-up; long term safety 
is to be addressed in future study updates and within the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The results from studies conducted in the CLL indication are of high clinical relevance. The activity of 
ibrutinib was demonstrated across trials. The positive results in the high risk patients with del17p / TP53 
mutations are of particular importance and support an indication in first line for those patients who are 
unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy. 
Clinically relevant results were observed in patients with MCL treated with ibrutinib monotherapy. 
Although the pivotal study is a single arm study, the dramatic activity seen in terms of ORR, and DOR is 
unprecedented historically and considered sufficiently important in this heavily pre-treated patient 
population to support approval. 
The most frequent adverse reactions related to the use of the ibrutinib are infections, neutropenia, and 
diarrhoea. However, discontinuation due to toxicity was infrequent and overall the toxicity was considered 
manageable. 
The safety profile was similar across clinical trials and indications with diarrhoea and infections as 
predominant events and most common grade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥ 5%) were anaemia, neutropenia, 
pneumonia and thrombocytopenia. Discontinuation due to toxicity was infrequent and overall the toxicity 
was considered manageable with dose modifications. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The important benefits observed in the two indications outweigh the risks related to the use of ibrutinib. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645137/2014  
Page 137/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of major importance in the assessment of benefit is the consistently shown dramatic activity of ibrutinib 
irrespective of refractoriness to prior therapy or unfavourable prognostic factors in patients with MCL and 
CLL.  
The high response rates and long durations of response at acceptable toxicity are acknowledged, 
although the long-term data are not yet available. As a consequence, efficacy and safety data from 
ongoing studies will be regularly updated to provide additional information about long-term benefits and 
risks. 
The benefit- risk balance in the indication: 
- 
treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). 
Is positive, as outstanding activity is shown in terms of high response rate in this patient population of an 
unmet clinical need 
The benefit- risk balance in the indication: 
- 
treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least 
one prior therapy, or in first line in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in patients 
unlikely to benefit from chemo-immunotherapy. 
is positive considering that patients who had received prior therapies included in the pivotal study  had a 
statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or progression. The efficacy was similar across all of 
the subgroups examined, including in patients with and without deletion 17p, a pre-specified stratification 
factor, patients who are unlikely to benefit from chemo – immunotherapy. 
In patients with del17p/TP53 mutations limited options such as fludarabine or alemtuzumab combination 
regimens may be available; however these regimens are too toxic for large proportions of patients, 
therefore benefit-risk is considered clearly favourable for patients non-suitable for 
immuno-chemotherapy in case of mutations del17p/TP53, regardless of prior treatment experience.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Imbruvica is not similar to Arzerra, Gazyvaro and Torisel 
and within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Imbruvica in the treatment of  
-  adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). 
-  adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior 
therapy, or in first line in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in patients unlikely to 
benefit from chemo-immunotherapy 
is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:

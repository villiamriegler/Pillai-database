COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE  
POST-AUTHORISTAION SUMMARY OF POSITIVE OPINION* 
for  
PREZISTA 
International Nonproprietary Name (INN): darunavir 
On 23 April 2009 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion,** recommending an extension to the terms  of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product  Prezista.  The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  for  this  medicinal  product  is  Janssen-Cilag 
International NV. 
The extension adopted by the CHMP is to add two new strengths (75 and 150 mg film-coated tablets) 
to the existing product range. 
The CHMP also adopted a change to an indication, as follows***:  
Prezista, co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV-1)  infection  in 
antiretroviral  treatment  (ART)  experienced  adult  patients,  including  those  that  have  been  highly 
pre-treated, and for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in ART-experienced children and adolescents 
from the age of 6 years and at least 20 kg body weight. 
In  deciding  to  initiate  treatment  with  Prezista  co-administered  with  low  dose  ritonavir  careful 
consideration  should  be  given  to  the  treatment  history  of  the  individual  patient  and  the  patterns  of 
mutations  associated  with  different  agents.  Genotypic  or  phenotypic  testing  (when  available)  and 
treatment history should guide the use of Prezista.

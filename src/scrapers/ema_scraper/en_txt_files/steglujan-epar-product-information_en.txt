CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
Steglujan is indicated in adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to
diet and exercise:
• 
to improve glycaemic control when metformin and/or a sulphonylurea (SU) and one of the
monocomponents of Steglujan do not provide adequate glycaemic control.
• 
in patients already being treated with the combination of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin as separate
tablets.
(For study results with respect to combinations and effects on glycaemic control, see sections 4.4, 4.5,
and 5.1)

4.2  Posology and method of administration
Posology
The recommended starting dose is 5 mg ertugliflozin/100 mg sitagliptin once daily. In patients
tolerating the starting dose, the dose may be increased to 15 mg ertugliflozin/100 mg sitagliptin, once
daily, if additional glycaemic control is needed.
For patients treated with ertugliflozin who are being switched to Steglujan, the dose of ertugliflozin
can be maintained.
When Steglujan is used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, a lower dose of insulin
or the insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see sections 4.4, 4.5,
and 4.8).
In patients with volume depletion, correcting this condition prior to initiation of Steglujan is
recommended (see section 4.4).
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. Patients should not take two
doses of Steglujan on the same day. 
Special populations
Renal impairment
Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of Steglujan and periodically
thereafter (see section 4.4).
Initiation of this medicinal product is not recommended in patients with an estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 45 mL/min
(see section 4.4). 
In patients with an eGFR ≥ 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, Steglujan should be initiated at 5 mg/100 mg
and up-titrated to 15 mg/100 mg as needed for glycaemic control. 
Because the glycaemic lowering efficacy of ertugliflozin is reduced in patients with moderate renal
impairment and likely absent in patients with severe renal impairment, if further glycaemic control is
needed, the addition of other anti-hyperglycaemic agents should be considered (see section 4.4).
Steglujan should be discontinued when eGFR is persistently less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl is
persistently less than 45 mL/min.
The fixed-dose combination of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin should not be used in patients with severe
renal impairment, with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or receiving dialysis, as there is no clinical
data to support effectiveness in these patients.
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment of Steglujan is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.
Steglujan has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is not recommended for
use in these patients (see section 5.2).
Elderly 
No dose adjustment of Steglujan is recommended based on age. Elderly patients are more likely to
have decreased renal function. Because renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating
ertugliflozin, and sitagliptin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, renal function
3
should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients. Renal function and risk of volume depletion
should be taken into account (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Steglujan in children under 18 years of age have not been established. No
data are available.
Method of administration 
Steglujan should be taken orally once daily in the morning, with or without food. In case of
swallowing difficulties, the tablet could be broken or crushed as it is an immediate-release dosage
form. 
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
General
Steglujan should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. It may increase the risk of
diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in these patients.
Acute pancreatitis
Use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors has been associated with a risk of developing acute
pancreatitis. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis:
persistent, severe abdominal pain. Resolution of pancreatitis has been observed after discontinuation
of sitagliptin (with or without supportive treatment), but very rare cases of necrotising or
haemorrhagic pancreatitis and/or death have been reported. If pancreatitis is suspected, Steglujan and
other potentially suspect medicinal products should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed,
Steglujan should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of
pancreatitis.
Hypotension/Volume depletion
Ertugliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction.
Therefore, symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating Steglujan (see section 4.8), particularly
in patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl less than
60 mL/min), elderly patients (≥ 65 years), patients on diuretics, or patients on anti-hypertensive
therapy with a history of hypotension. Before initiating Steglujan, volume status should be assessed
and corrected if indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms after initiating therapy.
Due to its mechanism of action, ertugliflozin induces an osmotic diuresis and increases serum
creatinine and decreases eGFR. Increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR were greater in
patients with moderate renal impairment (see section 4.8).
In case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g., gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of
volume status (e.g., physical examination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory tests including
haematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving Steglujan. Temporary interruption
of treatment with Steglujan should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected.
Diabetic ketoacidosis
Rare cases of DKA, including life-threatening and fatal cases, have been reported in clinical trials and
post-marketing in patients treated with sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including
4
ertugliflozin. In a number of cases, the presentation of the condition was atypical with only moderately
increased blood glucose values, below 14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL). It is not known if DKA is more likely
to occur with higher doses of ertugliflozin.
The risk of DKA must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting,
anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual fatigue or
sleepiness. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these symptoms occur,
regardless of blood glucose level.
In patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, treatment with Steglujan should be discontinued
immediately.
Treatment should be interrupted in patients who are hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute
serious medical illnesses. Monitoring of ketones is recommended in these patients. Measurement of
blood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Treatment with Steglujan may be restarted when the ketone
values are normal and the patient’s condition has stabilised.
Before initiating Steglujan, factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis should be
considered.
Patients who may be at higher risk of DKA include patients with a low beta-cell function reserve (e.g.,
type 2 diabetes patients with low C-peptide or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or
patients with a history of pancreatitis), patients with conditions that lead to restricted food intake or
severe dehydration, patients for whom insulin doses are reduced and patients with increased insulin
requirements due to acute medical illness, surgery, or alcohol abuse. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used
with caution in these patients.
Restarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor
treatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved.
The safety and efficacy of Steglujan in patients with type 1 diabetes have not been established and
Steglujan should not be used for treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes. Limited data from clinical
trials suggest that DKA occurs with common frequency when patients with type 1 diabetes are treated
with SGLT2 inhibitors.
Lower limb amputations 
In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study VERTIS CV (eValuation of ERTugliflozin effIcacy and
Safety, CardioVascular), a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, non-traumatic lower limb amputations (primarily of the toe)
were reported with an incidence of 2% (0.57 subjects with event per 100 patient-years), 2.1% (0.60
subjects with event per 100 patient-years) and 1.6% (0.47 subjects with event per 100 patient-years)
for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo groups. The event rates of lower limb
amputations were 0.75 and 0.96 versus 0.74 events per 100 patient-years for ertugliflozin 5 mg and
ertugliflozin 15 mg versus placebo, respectively. An increase in cases of lower limb amputation
(primarily of the toe) has been observed in long-term clinical studies in type 2 diabetes mellitus with
SGLT2 inhibitors. It is not known whether this constitutes a class effect. It is important to counsel
patients with diabetes on routine preventative foot care.
Renal impairment
The efficacy of ertugliflozin for glycaemic control is dependent on renal function, and glycaemic
efficacy is reduced in patients who have moderate renal impairment and likely absent in patients with
severe renal impairment (see section 4.2).
5
Steglujan should not be initiated in patients with an eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl below
45 mL/min. Steglujan should be discontinued when eGFR is persistently below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or
CrCl is persistently below 45 mL/min due to a reduction of efficacy.
Monitoring of renal function is recommended as follows:
- 
- 
Prior to Steglujan initiation and periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).
More frequently in patients with an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or a CrCl below
60 mL/min.
Hypoglycaemia with concomitant use with insulin and insulin secretagogues
Ertugliflozin may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an
insulin secretagogue, which are known to cause hypoglycaemia (see section 4.8). Hypoglycaemia has
been observed when sitagliptin was used in combination with insulin or a sulphonylurea. Therefore, a
lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia
when used in combination with Steglujan (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).
Genital mycotic infections
Ertugliflozin increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. In trials with SGLT2 inhibitors, patients
with a history of genital mycotic infections and uncircumcised males were more likely to develop
genital mycotic infections (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored and treated appropriately.
Urinary tract infections
Urinary glucose excretion may be associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections (see
section 4.8). Temporary interruption of ertugliflozin should be considered when treating
pyelonephritis or urosepsis.
Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene) 
Post-marketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum, (also known as Fournier’s gangrene),
have been reported in female and male patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. This is a rare but serious and
potentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and antibiotic treatment. 
Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of
pain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware
that either urogenital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis. If Fournier’s
gangrene is suspected, Steglujan should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including antibiotics
and surgical debridement) should be instituted. 
Hypersensitivity reactions
Post-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin have
been reported (see section 4.8). These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin
conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first
3 months after initiation of treatment, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a
hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, Steglujan should be discontinued. Other potential causes for the
event should be assessed, and alternative treatment for diabetes initiated.
Bullous pemphigoid
There have been post-marketing reports of bullous pemphigoid in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors
including sitagliptin. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, Steglujan should be discontinued.
6
Elderly patients
Elderly patients may be at an increased risk of volume depletion and renal impairment. Patients
65 years and older treated with ertugliflozin, had a higher incidence of adverse reactions related to
volume depletion compared to younger patients. In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study
VERTIS CV, safety and efficacy were similar for patients age 65 years and older compared to patients
younger than 65 (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Cardiac failure 
There is no experience in clinical studies with Steglujan in New York Heart Association (NYHA)
class IV.
Urine laboratory assessments
Due to the mechanism of action of ertugliflozin, patients taking Steglujan will test positive for glucose
in their urine. Alternative methods should be used to monitor glycaemic control.
Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay
Monitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are
unreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Alternative methods
should be used to monitor glycaemic control.
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with Steglujan have not been performed; however, such
studies have been conducted with ertugliflozin and sitagliptin, the individual active substances of
Steglujan.
Ertugliflozin
Pharmacodynamic interactions
Diuretics
Ertugliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of diuretics and may increase the risk of dehydration and
hypotension (see section 4.4).
Insulin and insulin secretagogues
Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, cause hypoglycaemia. Ertugliflozin may
increase the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin
secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce
the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with Steglujan (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8). 
Pharmacokinetic interactions
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin
Metabolism by UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 is the primary clearance mechanism for ertugliflozin. 
Interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using a single dose design, suggest that the
pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin are not altered by sitagliptin, metformin, glimepiride, or simvastatin.
7
Multiple-dose administration of rifampicin (a uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase [UGT]
and cytochrome P450 [CYP] inducer) decreases ertugliflozin area under the concentration-time curve
(AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) by 39% and 15%, respectively. This decrease in
exposure is not considered clinically relevant and therefore, no dose adjustment is recommended. A
clinically relevant effect with other inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) is not
expected. 
The impact of UGT inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin has not been studied clinically,
but potential increase in ertugliflozin exposure due to UGT inhibition is not considered to be clinically
relevant.
Effects of ertugliflozin on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products
Interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers suggest that ertugliflozin had no clinically relevant
effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin, metformin, and glimepiride. 
Coadministration of simvastatin with ertugliflozin resulted in a 24% and 19% increase in AUC and
Cmax of simvastatin, respectively, and 30% and 16% increase in AUC and Cmax of simvastatin acid,
respectively. The mechanism for the small increases in simvastatin and simvastatin acid is unknown
and is not perpetrated through organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibition by
ertugliflozin. These increases are not considered to be clinically meaningful.  
Sitagliptin
Pharmacokinetic interactions
Effects of other medicinal products on sitagliptin
Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine, and metabolism is a minor pathway. In vitro
studies indicate that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin is
CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8.
Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe
renal impairment or ESRD. For this reason, it is possible that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e.,
ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) could alter the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in
patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD.
Interaction studies conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes or healthy volunteers suggest that
metformin and ciclosporin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.
Effects of sitagliptin on other medicinal products
In drug interaction studies, sitagliptin did not have clinically meaningful effects on the
pharmacokinetics of the following: metformin, rosiglitazone, glyburide, simvastatin, warfarin, and oral
contraceptives.
Digoxin:
Sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations. Following administration of 0.25 mg
digoxin concomitantly with 100 mg of sitagliptin daily for 10 days, the plasma AUC of digoxin was
increased on average by 11% and the plasma Cmax on average by 18%. No dose adjustment of digoxin
is recommended. However, patients at risk of digoxin toxicity should be monitored for this when
sitagliptin and digoxin are administered concomitantly.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no data from the use of Steglujan in pregnant women. There are limited data from the use of
ertugliflozin in pregnant women. Based on results from animal studies, ertugliflozin may affect renal
development and maturation (see section 5.3). Therefore, Steglujan should not be used during
pregnancy. 
8
Breast-feeding
There is no information regarding the presence of Steglujan or its individual components in human
milk, the effects on the breast-fed infant, or the effects on milk production. No studies in lactating
animals have been conducted with the combined components of Steglujan. Ertugliflozin and sitagliptin
are present in the milk of lactating rats. Ertugliflozin caused effects in the offspring of lactating rats.
Pharmacologically mediated effects were observed in juvenile rats treated with ertugliflozin (see
section 5.3). Since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of life when
exposure from breast-feeding may occur, a risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Steglujan
should not be used during breast-feeding.
Fertility
The effect of Steglujan on fertility in humans has not been studied. No effects of ertugliflozin or
sitagliptin on fertility were observed in animal studies (see section 5.3).
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Steglujan has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, when
driving or using machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness and somnolence have been
reported with sitagliptin. In addition, patients should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when
Steglujan is used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue and to the elevated risk of
adverse reactions related to volume depletion, such as postural dizziness (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and
4.8).
4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Ertugliflozin and sitagliptin
The safety of concomitantly administered ertugliflozin and sitagliptin has been evaluated in
990 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated for 26 weeks in three studies; a factorial study of
ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg in combination with sitagliptin 100 mg once daily compared to the
individual components, a placebo-controlled study of ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg as add-on therapy to
sitagliptin 100 mg and metformin once daily, and a placebo-controlled study of initial therapy with
ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg once daily in combination with sitagliptin 100 mg once daily (see
section 5.1). The incidence and type of adverse reactions in these three studies were similar to the
adverse reactions seen with the individual monotherapies ertugliflozin and sitagliptin as described
below in Table 1.
Ertugliflozin
The safety and tolerability of ertugliflozin were assessed in 7 placebo- or active comparator-controlled
studies with a total of 3 409 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with ertugliflozin 5 mg or
15 mg. In addition, the safety and tolerability of ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and
established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were assessed in VERTIS CV (see section 5.1) with
a total of 5 493 patients treated with ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg and a mean duration of exposure of
2.9 years. 
Pool of placebo-controlled trials
The primary assessment of safety was conducted in a pool of three 26-week, placebo-controlled trials.
Ertugliflozin was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in two trials (see
section 5.1). These data reflect exposure of 1 029 patients to ertugliflozin with a mean exposure
9
duration of approximately 25 weeks. Patients received ertugliflozin 5 mg (N=519), ertugliflozin 15 mg
(N=510), or placebo (N=515) once daily.
The most commonly reported adverse reactions across the clinical program were urinary tract
infections, vulvovaginal mycotic infection and other female genital mycotic infections. Serious DKA
occurred rarely (see section 4.4).
Sitagliptin
Serious adverse reactions including pancreatitis and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.
Hypoglycaemia has been reported in combination with sulphonylurea (4.7%-13.8%) and insulin
(9.6%) (see section 4.4).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Adverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and system organ class (SOC),
within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing
seriousness. Frequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common
(≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to
< 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Ertugliflozin
Volume depletion 
Ertugliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and
adverse reactions related to volume depletion. In the pool of placebo-controlled studies, the incidence
of adverse events related to volume depletion (dehydration, dizziness postural, presyncope, syncope,
hypotension and orthostatic hypotension) was low (< 2%) and not notably different across the
ertugliflozin and placebo groups. In the subgroup analyses in the broader pool of phase 3 studies,
subjects with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, subjects ≥ 65 years of age and subjects on diuretics had a
higher incidence of volume depletion in the ertugliflozin groups relative to the comparator group (see
sections 4.2 and 4.4). In subjects with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence was 5.1%, 2.6% and
0.5% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and the comparator group and for subjects with eGFR
45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence was 6.4%, 3.7% and 0% respectively. 
Hypoglycaemia 
In the pool of placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of documented hypoglycaemia was increased
for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (5% and 4.5%) compared to placebo (2.9%). In this population, the
incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 0.4% in each group. When ertugliflozin was used as
monotherapy, the incidence of hypoglycaemic events in the ertugliflozin groups was 2.6% in both
groups and 0.7% in the placebo group. When used as add-on to metformin, the incidence of
hypoglycaemic events was 7.2% in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 7.8% in the ertugliflozin 15 mg
group and 4.3% in the placebo group.
When ertugliflozin was added to metformin and compared to sulphonylurea, the incidence of
hypoglycaemia was higher for the sulphonylurea (27%) compared to ertugliflozin (5.6% and 8.2% for
ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg, respectively).
In the VERTIS CV sub-studies, when ertugliflozin was added to insulin with or without metformin,
the incidences of documented hypoglycaemia were 39.4%, 38.9% and 37.5% for ertugliflozin 5 mg,
ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo, respectively. When ertugliflozin was added to a sulphonylurea, the
incidences of hypoglycaemia were 7.3%, 9.3% and 4.2% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg
and placebo, respectively. When ertugliflozin was added to metformin and a sulphonylurea, the
incidences of hypoglycaemia were 20%, 26.5% and 14.5% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg
and placebo, respectively. 
In patients with moderate renal impairment taking insulins, sulphonylurea, or meglitinides as
background medicinal products, documented hypoglycaemia was 36%, 27% and 36% for ertugliflozin
5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and placebo, respectively (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.5).
Diabetic ketoacidosis 
In VERTIS CV, ketoacidosis was identified in 19 (0.3%) ertugliflozin-treated patients and in 2 (0.1%)
placebo-treated patients. Across 7 other phase 3 clinical trials in the ertugliflozin development
program, ketoacidosis was identified in 3 (0.1%) ertugliflozin-treated patients and 0 (0%) of
comparator-treated patients (see section 4.4).
Blood creatinine increased/Glomerular filtration rate decreased and renal-related events 
Initial increases in mean creatinine and decreases in mean eGFR in patients treated with ertugliflozin
were generally transient during continuous treatment. Patients with moderate renal impairment at
12
baseline had larger mean changes that did not return to baseline at Week 26; these changes reversed
after treatment discontinuation. 
In VERTIS CV, treatment with ertugliflozin was associated with an initial decrease in mean eGFR (at
Week 6, -2.7, -3.8 and -0.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo
groups, respectively) followed by a return toward baseline. Long-term, continued treatment with
ertugliflozin was associated with a slower decline in eGFR compared to placebo (up to week 260).
In VERTIS CV, the incidences of renal-related adverse reactions (e.g., acute kidney injury, renal
impairment, acute prerenal failure) were 4.2%, 4.3% and 4.7% in patients treated with ertugliflozin
5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo respectively in the overall population and were 9.7%, 10% and
10.2% in patients treated with ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo respectively in
patients with an eGFR from 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Genital mycotic infections 
In the pool of three placebo-controlled clinical trials, female genital mycotic infections (e.g., genital
candidiasis, genital infection fungal, vaginal infection, vulvitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, vulvovaginal
mycotic infection, vulvovaginitis) occurred in 9.1%, 12%, and 3% of females treated with ertugliflozin
5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and placebo, respectively. In females, discontinuation due to genital
mycotic infections occurred in 0.6% and 0% of patients treated with ertugliflozin and placebo,
respectively (see section 4.4).
In the same pool, male genital mycotic infections (e.g., balanitis candida, balanoposthitis, genital
infection, genital infection fungal) occurred in 3.7%, 4.2%, and 0.4% of males treated with
ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and placebo, respectively. Male genital mycotic infections
occurred more commonly in uncircumcised males. In males, discontinuations due to genital mycotic
infections occurred in 0.2% and 0% of patients treated with ertugliflozin and placebo, respectively. In
rare instances, phimosis was reported and sometimes circumcision was performed (see section 4.4).
Urinary tract infections
In VERTIS CV, urinary tract infections occurred in 12.2%, 12% and 10.2% of patients treated with
ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo, respectively. The incidences of serious urinary
tract infections were 0.9%, 0.4%, and 0.8% with ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo,
respectively.
Across 7 other phase 3 clinical trials in the ertugliflozin development program, the incidences of
urinary tract infections were 4% and 4.1% for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups and 3.9% for
placebo. Most of the events were mild or moderate, and no serious cases were reported. 
Sitagliptin
In addition to the adverse reactions described in the table above, adverse experiences reported
regardless of causal relationship to medication and occurring in at least 5% and more commonly in
patients treated with sitagliptin included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis.
Additional adverse experiences reported regardless of causal relationship to medication that occurred
more frequently in patients treated with sitagliptin (not reaching the 5% level, but occurring with an
incidence of > 0.5% higher with sitagliptin than that in the control group) included osteoarthritis and
pain in extremity.
Some adverse reactions were observed more frequently in studies of combination use of sitagliptin
with other anti-diabetic medicinal products than in studies of sitagliptin monotherapy. These included
hypoglycaemia (frequency very common with the combination of sulphonylurea and metformin),
influenza (common with insulin (with or without metformin)), nausea and vomiting (common with
metformin), flatulence (common with metformin or pioglitazone), constipation (common with the
combination of sulphonylurea and metformin), peripheral oedema (common with pioglitazone or the
combination of pioglitazone and metformin), somnolence and diarrhoea (uncommon with metformin),
and dry mouth (uncommon with insulin (with or without metformin)).
13
TECOS (trial evaluating cardiovascular outcomes with sitagliptin)
The cardiovascular safety study with sitagliptin (TECOS) included 7 332 patients treated with
sitagliptin, 100 mg daily (or 50 mg daily if the baseline eGFR was ≥ 30 and < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2),
and 7 339 patients treated with placebo in the intention-to-treat population. Both treatments were
added to usual care targeting regional standards for haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and cardiovascular
(CV) risk factors. The overall incidence of serious adverse events in patients receiving sitagliptin was
similar to that in patients receiving placebo. 
In the intention-to-treat population, among patients who were using insulin and/or a sulphonylurea at
baseline, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 2.7% in sitagliptin-treated patients and 2.5% in
placebo-treated patients; among patients who were not using insulin and/or a sulphonylurea at
baseline, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 1% in sitagliptin-treated patients and 0.7% in
placebo-treated patients. The incidence of adjudication-confirmed pancreatitis events was 0.3% in
sitagliptin-treated patients and 0.2% in placebo-treated patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
In the event of an overdose with Steglujan, employ the usual supportive measures (e.g., remove
unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring including obtaining an
electrocardiogram, and institute supportive treatment) as dictated by the patient’s clinical status.
Ertugliflozin
Ertugliflozin did not show any toxicity in healthy subjects at single oral doses up to 300 mg and
multiple doses up to 100 mg daily for 2 weeks. No potential acute symptoms and signs of overdose
were identified. Removal of ertugliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied.
Sitagliptin
During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg sitagliptin were
administered. Minimal increases in QTc, not considered to be clinically relevant, were observed in one
study at a dose of 800 mg sitagliptin. There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in clinical
studies. In phase 1 multiple-dose studies, there were no dose-related clinical adverse reactions
observed with sitagliptin with doses of up to 600 mg per day for periods of up to 10 days and 400 mg
per day for periods of up to 28 days.
Sitagliptin is modestly dialysable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed
over a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session. Prolonged haemodialysis may be considered if clinically
appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialysable by peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, combinations of oral blood glucose lowering
drugs, ATC code: A10BD24.
14
Mechanism of action
Steglujan combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to
improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: ertugliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, and
sitagliptin phosphate, a DPP-4 inhibitor.
Ertugliflozin
SGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular
filtrate back into the circulation. Ertugliflozin is a potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of SGLT2.
By inhibiting SGLT2, ertugliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal
threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.
Sitagliptin
Sitagliptin is a member of a class of oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents called DPP-4 inhibitors. The
improvement in glycaemic control observed with this medicinal product may be mediated by
enhancing the levels of active incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the
intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. The incretins are part of an
endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood
glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release
from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signalling pathways involving cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (AMP). Treatment with GLP-1 or with DPP-4 inhibitors in animal models of type 2
diabetes has been demonstrated to improve beta cell responsiveness to glucose and stimulate insulin
biosynthesis and release. With higher insulin levels, tissue glucose uptake is enhanced. In addition,
GLP-1 lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells. Decreased glucagon concentrations,
along with higher insulin levels, lead to reduced hepatic glucose production, resulting in a decrease in
blood glucose levels. The effects of GLP-1 and GIP are glucose-dependent such that when blood
glucose concentrations are low, stimulation of insulin release and suppression of glucagon secretion by
GLP-1 are not observed. For both GLP-1 and GIP, stimulation of insulin release is enhanced as
glucose rises above normal concentrations. Further, GLP-1 does not impair the normal glucagon
response to hypoglycaemia. The activity of GLP-1 and GIP is limited by the DPP-4 enzyme, which
rapidly hydrolyses the incretin hormones to produce inactive products. Sitagliptin prevents the
hydrolysis of incretin hormones by DPP-4, thereby increasing plasma concentrations of the active
forms of GLP-1 and GIP. By enhancing active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and
decreases glucagon levels in a glucose-dependent manner. In patients with type 2 diabetes with
hyperglycaemia, these changes in insulin and glucagon levels lead to lower HbA1c and lower fasting
and post-prandial glucose concentrations. The glucose-dependent mechanism of sitagliptin is distinct
from the mechanism of sulphonylureas, which increase insulin secretion even when glucose levels are
low and can lead to hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes and in normal subjects. Sitagliptin
is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4 and does not inhibit the closely-related
enzymes DPP-8 or DPP-9 at therapeutic concentrations.
In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations,
whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents.
Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations.
Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Ertugliflozin
Urinary glucose excretion and urinary volume
Dose-dependent increases in the amount of glucose excreted in urine were observed in healthy
subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following single- and multiple-dose
administration of ertugliflozin. Dose-response modelling indicates that ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg
15
result in near maximal urinary glucose excretion (UGE) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,
providing 87% and 96% of maximal inhibition, respectively.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Glycaemic control
The glycaemic efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in combination with sitagliptin have been studied in
3 multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled, phase 3 clinical
studies involving 1 985 patients with type 2 diabetes. Across the 3 studies, the racial distribution
ranged from 72.9% to 90.4% White, 0% to 20.3% Asian, 1.9% to 4.5% Black and 4.8% to 5.4%
Other. Hispanic or Latino patients comprised 15.6% to 36.1% of the population. The mean age of the
patients across these 3 studies ranged from 55.1 to 59.1 years (range 21 years to 85 years). Across the
3 studies, 16.2% to 29.9% of patients were ≥ 65 years of age and 2.3% to 2.8% were ≥ 75 years of age.
Factorial study with ertugliflozin and sitagliptin as add-on combination therapy with metformin
A total of 1 233 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre,
26-week, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg in
combination with sitagliptin 100 mg compared to the individual components. Patients with type 2
diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy (≥ 1 500 mg/day) were randomised to one
of five active-treatment arms: ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg, or sitagliptin 100 mg in
combination with 5 mg or 15 mg ertugliflozin administered once daily in addition to continuation of
background metformin therapy (see Table 2).

Combination therapy of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin
A total of 291 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise participated in
a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled 26-week study to evaluate the efficacy
and safety of ertugliflozin in combination with sitagliptin. These patients, who were not receiving any
background antihyperglycaemic treatment, were randomised to ertugliflozin 5 mg or ertugliflozin
15 mg in combination with sitagliptin (100 mg) or to placebo, once daily (see Table 4).

Fasting plasma glucose
In three placebo-controlled studies, ertugliflozin resulted in statistically significant reductions in
fasting plasma glucose (FPG). For ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg, respectively, the placebo-corrected
reductions in FPG were 1.92 and 2.44 mmol/L as monotherapy, 1.48 and 2.12 mmol/L as add-on to
metformin, and 1.40 and 1.74 mmol/L as add-on to metformin and sitagliptin.
The combination of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin resulted in significantly greater reductions in FPG
compared to sitagliptin or ertugliflozin alone or placebo. The combination of ertugliflozin 5 or 15 mg
and sitagliptin resulted in incremental FPG reductions of 0.46 to 0.65 mmol/L compared to the
ertugliflozin alone or 1.02 to 1.28 mmol/L compared to sitagliptin alone. The placebo-corrected
reductions of ertugliflozin 5 or 15 mg in combination with sitagliptin were 2.16 and 2.56 mmol/L.
Efficacy in patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 10%
In the study of patients inadequately controlled on metformin with baseline HbA1c from 7.5-11%,
among the subgroup of patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥ 10%, the combination of ertugliflozin 5 mg
or 15 mg with sitagliptin resulted in reductions of HbA1c of 2.35% and 2.66%, respectively, compared
to 2.10%, 1.30%, and 1.82% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and sitagliptin alone,
respectively.
Post-prandial glucose
When used in monotherapy, ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg resulted in statistically significant placebo-
corrected reductions in 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) of 3.83 and 3.74 mmol/L.
The combination of ertugliflozin 5 or 15 mg with sitagliptin resulted in statistically significant
placebo-corrected reductions in 2-hour PPG of 3.46 and 3.87 mmol/L.
Blood pressure
After 26-weeks of treatment, the combination of ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg
resulted in statistically significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared to sitagliptin
alone (-2.8 and -3.0 mmHg for E5/S100 and E15/S100 respectively) or placebo (-4.4 and -6.4 mmHg
for E5/S100 and E15/S100, respectively). Additionally, when added on to background metformin and
18
 
sitagliptin therapy, ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg resulted in statistically significant placebo subtracted
reductions in SBP of 2.9 and 3.9 mmHg, respectively.
Subgroup analysis
In patients with type 2 diabetes treated with ertugliflozin in combination with sitagliptin, the
improvement in HbA1c was similar across subgroups defined by age, sex, and race, and duration of
type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Cardiovascular outcomes
Ertugliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study (VERTIS CV)
The effect of ertugliflozin on cardiovascular risk in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and
established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was evaluated in the VERTIS CV study, a
multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial. The
study compared the risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) between
ertugliflozin and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care
treatments for diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
A total of 8 246 patients were randomised (placebo N=2 747, ertugliflozin 5 mg N=2 752, ertugliflozin
15 mg N=2 747) and followed for a median of 3 years. The mean age was 64 years and approximately
70% were male.
All patients in the study had inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline (HbA1c
greater than or equal to 7%). The mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 13 years, the mean
HbA1c at baseline was 8.2% and the mean eGFR was 76 mL/min/1.73 m2. At baseline, patients were
treated with one (32%) or more (67%) antidiabetic medicinal products including metformin (76%),
insulin (47%), sulphonylureas (41%), DPP-4 inhibitors (11%) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (3%).
Almost all patients (99%) had established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at baseline.
Approximately 24% patients had a history of heart failure. The primary endpoint in VERTIS CV was
the time to first occurrence of MACE (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or
non-fatal stroke).
Ertugliflozin demonstrated non-inferiority versus placebo for MACE (see Table 5). Results for the
individual 5 mg and 15 mg doses were consistent with results for the combined dose groups. 
In patients treated with ertugliflozin, the rate of hospitalisation for heart failure was lower than in
patients treated with placebo (see Table 5 and Figure 1).

Sitagliptin cardiovascular outcomes study (TECOS)
The TECOS was a randomised study in 14 671 patients in the intention-to-treat population with an
HbA1c of ≥ 6.5 to 8.0% with established CV disease who received sitagliptin (7 332) 100 mg daily (or
50 mg daily if the baseline eGFR was ≥ 30 and < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2) or placebo (7 339) added to
usual care targeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. Patients with an eGFR
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were not to be enrolled in the study. The study population included
2 004 patients ≥ 75 years of age and 3 324 patients with renal impairment
(eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2).
Over the course of the study, the overall estimated mean (SD) difference in HbA1c between the
sitagliptin and placebo groups was 0.29% (0.01), 95% CI (-0.32, -0.27); p< 0.001. The primary
cardiovascular endpoint was a composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal
myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina. Secondary
cardiovascular endpoints included the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial
infarction, or non-fatal stroke; first occurrence of the individual components of the primary composite;
all-cause mortality; and hospital admissions for congestive heart failure.
After a median follow up of 3 years, sitagliptin, when added to usual care, did not increase the risk of
major adverse cardiovascular events or the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure compared to usual
care without sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes (see Table 6).

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with
Steglujan in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (see section 4.2
for information on paediatric use).
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
Steglujan
Steglujan has been shown to be bioequivalent to coadministration of corresponding doses of
ertugliflozin and sitagliptin tablets.
The effects of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin when
administered as Steglujan tablets are comparable to those reported for the individual tablets.
22
Administration of Steglujan with food decreased ertugliflozin Cmax by 29% and had no meaningful
effect on ertugliflozin AUCinf, or on sitagliptin AUCinf and Cmax.
Ertugliflozin
General introduction
The pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin are similar in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes.
The steady state mean plasma AUC and Cmax were 398 ng∙hr/mL and 81 ng/mL, respectively, with
5 mg ertugliflozin once daily treatment, and 1 193 ng∙hr/mL and 268 ng/mL, respectively, with 15 mg
ertugliflozin once daily treatment. Steady-state is reached after 4 to 6 days of once-daily dosing with
ertugliflozin. Ertugliflozin does not exhibit time-dependent pharmacokinetics and accumulates in
plasma up to 10-40% following multiple dosing.
Absorption
Following single-dose oral administration of 5 mg and 15 mg of ertugliflozin, peak plasma
concentrations (median time to maximum plasma concentration [Tmax]) of ertugliflozin occur at 1 hour
post-dose under fasted conditions. Plasma Cmax and AUC of ertugliflozin increase in a dose-
proportional manner following single doses from 0.5 mg to 300 mg and following multiple doses from
1 mg to 100 mg. The absolute oral bioavailability of ertugliflozin following administration of a 15-mg
dose is approximately 100%.
Administration of ertugliflozin with a high-fat and high-calorie meal decreases ertugliflozin Cmax by
29% and prolongs Tmax by 1 hour but does not alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. The
observed effect of food on ertugliflozin pharmacokinetics is not considered clinically relevant, and
ertugliflozin may be administered with or without food. In phase 3 clinical trials, ertugliflozin was
administered without regard to meals. 
Ertugliflozin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)
transporters.
Distribution
The mean steady-state volume of distribution of ertugliflozin following an intravenous dose is 86 L.
Plasma protein binding of ertugliflozin is 93.6% and is independent of ertugliflozin plasma
concentrations. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic
impairment. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of ertugliflozin is 0.66. 
Ertugliflozin is not a substrate of organic anion transporters (OAT1, OAT3), organic cation
transporters (OCT1, OCT2), or organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3) in
vitro.
Biotransformation
Metabolism is the primary clearance mechanism for ertugliflozin. The major metabolic pathway for
ertugliflozin is UGT1A9 and UGT2B7-mediated O-glucuronidation to two glucuronides that are
pharmacologically inactive at clinically relevant concentrations. CYP-mediated (oxidative)
metabolism of ertugliflozin is minimal (12%).
Elimination
The mean systemic plasma clearance following an intravenous 100 µg dose was 11 L/hr. The mean
elimination half-life in type 2 diabetic patients with normal renal function was estimated to be
17 hours based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral
[14C]-ertugliflozin solution to healthy subjects, approximately 41% and 50% of the drug-related
radioactivity was eliminated in faeces and urine, respectively. Only 1.5% of the administered dose was
23
excreted as unchanged ertugliflozin in urine and 34% as unchanged ertugliflozin in faeces, which is
likely due to biliary excretion of glucuronide metabolites and subsequent hydrolysis to parent.
Special populations
Renal impairment
In a phase 1 clinical pharmacology study in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild, moderate, or severe
renal impairment (as determined by eGFR), following a single-dose administration of 15 mg
ertugliflozin, the mean increases in AUC of ertugliflozin were ≤ 1.7-fold, compared to subjects with
normal renal function. These increases in ertugliflozin AUC are not considered clinically relevant.
There were no clinically meaningful differences in the ertugliflozin Cmax values among the different
renal function groups. The 24-hour urinary glucose excretion declined with increasing severity of renal
impairment (see section 4.4). The plasma protein binding of ertugliflozin was unaffected in patients
with renal impairment.
Hepatic impairment
Moderate hepatic impairment (based on the Child-Pugh classification) did not result in an increase in
exposure of ertugliflozin. The AUC of ertugliflozin decreased by approximately 13%, and Cmax
decreased by approximately 21% compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. This decrease in
ertugliflozin exposure is not considered clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in
patients with Child-Pugh class C (severe) hepatic impairment. The plasma protein binding of
ertugliflozin was unaffected in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
Paediatric population
No studies with ertugliflozin have been performed in paediatric patients.
Effects of age, body weight, gender and race
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, body weight, gender, and race do not have a
clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin.
Sitagliptin
Absorption
Following oral administration of a 100-mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed,
with median Tmax occurring 1 to 4 hours post-dose. Mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 M•hr
and Cmax was 950 nM. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Since
coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics, Steglujan
may be administered with or without food.
Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner. Dose-proportionality was not
established for Cmax and C24hr (Cmax increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner and C24hr
increased in a less than dose-proportional manner).
Distribution
The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of
sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 L. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to
plasma proteins is low (38%).
Biotransformation
Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine, and metabolism is a minor pathway.
Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine.
Following a [14C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as
metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to
24
contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the
primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution
from CYP2C8.
In vitro data showed that sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6,
1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2.
Elimination
Following administration of an oral [14C]-sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of
the administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of
dosing. The apparent terminal t1/2 following a 100-mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately
12.4 hours. Sitagliptin accumulates only minimally with multiple doses. The renal clearance was
approximately 350 mL/min.
Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion.
Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in
the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not
been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-gp, which may also be involved in mediating the
renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, ciclosporin, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal
clearance of sitagliptin. Sitagliptin is not a substrate for OCT2 or OAT1 or peptide transporter 1/2
(PEPT1/2) transporters. In vitro, sitagliptin did not inhibit OAT3 (IC50=160 M) or p-glycoprotein (up
to 250 M) mediated transport at therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations. In a clinical study
sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations indicating that sitagliptin may be a
mild inhibitor of P-gp.
Drug interactions
No drug interactions studies have been performed with Steglujan and other medicinal products;
however, such studies have been conducted with the individual active substances.
In vitro assessment of ertugliflozin
In in vitro studies, ertugliflozin and ertugliflozin glucuronides did not inhibit or inactivate CYPs 1A2,
2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2B6, 2D6, or 3A4, and did not induce CYPs 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. Ertugliflozin and
ertugliflozin glucuronides did not inhibit the activity of UGTs 1A6, 1A9 or 2B7 in vitro. Ertugliflozin
was a weak inhibitor of UGTs 1A1 and 1A4 in vitro at higher concentrations that are not clinically
relevant. Ertugliflozin glucuronides had no effect on these isoforms. Overall, ertugliflozin is unlikely
to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered medicinal products eliminated by these
enzymes.
Ertugliflozin or ertugliflozin glucuronides do not meaningfully inhibit P-gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3
transporters or transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant
concentrations in vitro. Overall, ertugliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently
administered medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters.
In vitro assessment of sitagliptin
In vitro data suggest that sitagliptin does not inhibit or induce CYP450 isoenzymes. In clinical studies,
sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin,
rosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptives, providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for
causing interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and OCT. Sitagliptin may be a
mild inhibitor of P-gp in vivo.
In vitro transport studies showed that sitagliptin is a substrate for P-gp and OAT3. OAT3 mediated
transport of sitagliptin was inhibited in vitro by probenecid, although the risk of clinically meaningful
25
interactions is considered to be low. Concomitant administration of OAT3 inhibitors has not been
evaluated in vivo.
Characteristics in patients
The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin were generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with
type 2 diabetes.
Renal impairment
In patients with normal renal function, metabolism, including via CYP3A4, plays only a small role in
the clearance of sitagliptin. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of
sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or ESRD.
Compared to normal healthy control subjects, plasma AUC of sitagliptin was increased modestly in
patients with GFR ≥ 45 to < 90 mL/min. Because increases of this magnitude are not clinically
relevant, dose adjustment in these patients is not necessary.
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment for sitagliptin is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment
(Child-Pugh score  9). There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment
(Child-Pugh score > 9). However, because sitagliptin is primarily renally eliminated, severe hepatic
impairment is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.
Elderly
No dose adjustment is required based on age. Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the
pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of phase 1 and phase 2
data. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of
sitagliptin compared to younger subjects.
Paediatric
No studies with sitagliptin have been performed in paediatric patients.
Other patient characteristics
No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender, race, or body mass index (BMI). These
characteristics had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a
composite analysis of phase 1 pharmacokinetic data and on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of
phase 1 and phase 2 data.
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety
pharmacology, acute toxicity, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential.
Ertugliflozin
General toxicity
Repeat-dose oral toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats, and dogs for up to 13, 26, and
39 weeks, respectively. Signs of toxicity that were considered adverse were generally observed at
exposures greater than or equal to 77 times the human unbound exposure (AUC) at the maximum
recommended human dose (MRHD) of 15 mg/day. Most toxicity was consistent with pharmacology
related to urinary glucose loss and included decreased body weight and body fat, increased food
26
consumption, diarrhoea, dehydration, decreased serum glucose and increases in other serum
parameters reflective of increased protein metabolism, gluconeogenesis and electrolyte imbalances,
and urinary changes such as polyuria, glucosuria, and calciuria. Microscopic changes related to
glucosuria and/or calciuria observed only in rodents included dilatation of renal tubules, hypertrophy
of zona glomerulosa in adrenal glands (rats), and increased trabecular bone (rats). Except for emesis,
there were no adverse toxicity findings in dogs at 379 times the human unbound exposure (AUC) at
the MRHD of 15 mg/day.
Carcinogenesis
In the 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study, ertugliflozin was administered by oral gavage at doses of 5,
15, and 40 mg/kg/day. There were no ertugliflozin-related neoplastic findings at doses up to
40 mg/kg/day (approximately 41 times human unbound exposure at the MRHD of 15 mg/day based on
AUC). In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, ertugliflozin was administered by oral gavage at doses
of 1.5, 5, and 15 mg/kg/day. Ertugliflozin-related neoplastic findings included an increased incidence
of benign adrenal medullary pheochromocytoma in male rats at 15 mg/kg/day. This finding was
attributed to carbohydrate malabsorption leading to altered calcium homeostasis and was not
considered relevant to human risk. The no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for neoplasia was
5 mg/kg/day (approximately 16 times human unbound exposure at the MRHD of 15 mg/day).
Mutagenesis
Ertugliflozin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the microbial
reverse mutation, in vitro cytogenetic (human lymphocytes), and in vivo rat micronucleus assays.
Reproductive toxicology
In the rat fertility and embryonic development study, male and female rats were administered
ertugliflozin at 5, 25, and 250 mg/kg/day. No effects on fertility were observed at 250 mg/kg/day
(approximately 386 times human unbound exposure at the MRHD of 15 mg/day based on AUC
comparisons). Ertugliflozin did not adversely affect developmental outcomes in rats and rabbits at
maternal exposures that were 239 and 1 069 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum
clinical dose of 15 mg/day, based on AUC. At a maternally toxic dose in rats (250 mg/kg/day), lower
fetal viability and a higher incidence of a visceral malformation were observed at maternal exposure
that was 510 times the maximum clinical dose of 15 mg/day.
In the pre- and post-natal development study, decreased post-natal growth and development were
observed in rats administered ertugliflozin gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 at
≥ 100 mg/kg/day (estimated 239 times the human exposure at the maximum clinical dose of
15 mg/day, based on AUC). Sexual maturation was delayed in both sexes at 250 mg/kg/day (estimated
620 times the MRHD at 15 mg/day, based on AUC).
When ertugliflozin was administered to juvenile rats from post-natal day (PND) 21 to PND 90, a
period of renal development corresponding to the late second and third trimesters of human
pregnancy, increased kidney weights, dilatation of the renal pelvis and tubules, and renal tubular
mineralization were seen at an exposure 13 times the maximum clinical dose of 15 mg/day, based on
AUC. Effects on bone (shorter femur length, increased trabecular bone in the femur) as well as effects
of delayed puberty were observed at an exposure 817 times the MRHD of 15 mg/day based on AUC.
The effects on kidney and bone did not fully reverse after the 1 month recovery period.
Sitagliptin
Renal and liver toxicity were observed in rodents at systemic exposure values 58 times the human
exposure level, while the no-effect level was found at 19 times the human exposure level. Incisor teeth
abnormalities were observed in rats at exposure levels 67 times the clinical exposure level; the
no-effect level for this finding was 58-fold based on the 14-week rat study. The relevance of these
findings for humans is unknown. Transient treatment-related physical signs, some of which suggest
27
neural toxicity, such as open-mouth breathing, salivation, white foamy emesis, ataxia, trembling,
decreased activity, and/or hunched posture were observed in dogs at exposure levels approximately
23 times the clinical exposure level. In addition, very slight to slight skeletal muscle degeneration was
also observed histologically at doses resulting in systemic exposure levels of approximately 23 times
the human exposure level. A no-effect level for these findings was found at an exposure 6-fold the
clinical exposure level.
Sitagliptin has not been demonstrated to be genotoxic in preclinical studies. Sitagliptin was not
carcinogenic in mice. In rats, there was an increased incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas at
systemic exposure levels 58 times the human exposure level. Since hepatotoxicity has been shown to
correlate with induction of hepatic neoplasia in rats, this increased incidence of hepatic tumours in rats
was likely secondary to chronic hepatic toxicity at this high dose. Because of the high safety margin
(19-fold at this no-effect level), these neoplastic changes are not considered relevant for the situation
in humans.
No adverse effects upon fertility were observed in male and female rats given sitagliptin prior to and
throughout mating.
In a pre-/post-natal development study performed in rats sitagliptin showed no adverse effects.
Reproductive toxicity studies showed a slight treatment-related increased incidence of foetal rib
malformations (absent, hypoplastic and wavy ribs) in the offspring of rats at systemic exposure levels
more than 29 times the human exposure levels. Maternal toxicity was seen in rabbits at more than
29 times the human exposure levels. Because of the high safety margins, these findings do not suggest
a relevant risk for human reproduction. Sitagliptin is secreted in considerable amounts into the milk of
lactating rats (milk/plasma ratio: 4:1).

6.  Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What Steglujan is and what it is used for
What Steglujan is
Steglujan contains two active substances, ertugliflozin and sitagliptin. Each belongs to a group of
medicines called “oral anti-diabetics”. These are medicines taken by mouth to treat diabetes.
• 
• 
Ertugliflozin belongs to a group of medicines called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors.
Sitagliptin belongs to a group of medicines called DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) inhibitors.
What Steglujan is used for
• 
Steglujan lowers blood sugar levels in adult patients (aged 18 years and older) with type 2
diabetes. 
• 
• 
• 
Steglujan can be used instead of taking both ertugliflozin and sitagliptin as separate tablets. 
Steglujan can be used alone or with some other medicines that lower blood sugar. 
You need to keep following your food and exercise plan while taking Steglujan.
How Steglujan works
• 
Ertugliflozin works by blocking the SGLT2 protein in your kidneys. This causes blood sugar to
be removed in your urine.
• 
Sitagliptin helps to increase the levels of insulin produced after a meal. It also lowers the
amount of sugar made by your body.
What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or the insulin that
your body produces does not work as well as it should. This leads to a high level of sugar in your
blood. When this happens, this can lead to serious medical problems like heart disease, kidney disease,
blindness and poor circulation.
42
2.  What you need to know before you take Steglujan 
Do not take Steglujan
• 
if you are allergic to ertugliflozin or sitagliptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine
(listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before and while taking Steglujan if you:
• 
have kidney problems. Your doctor may do blood tests to check how well your kidneys are
working.
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
have or have had urinary tract infections
have or have had yeast infections of the vagina or penis.
have or have had a disease of the pancreas (such as pancreatitis).
have or have had gallstones, alcohol dependence or very high levels of triglycerides (a form of
fat) in your blood. These medical conditions can increase your chance of getting pancreatitis
(see section 4).
have type 1 diabetes. Steglujan should not be used to treat this condition as it may increase the
risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in these patients.
take other diabetes medicines: you are more likely to get low blood sugar with certain
medicines.
might be at risk of dehydration (for example, if you are taking medicines that increase urine
production [diuretics] or lower blood pressure or if you are over 65 years old). Ask about ways
to prevent dehydration.
experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, fast and
deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet
or metallic taste in your mouth or a different odour to your urine or sweat contact a doctor or the
nearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of “diabetic ketoacidosis” – a
problem you can get with diabetes because of increased levels of “ketone bodies” in your urine
or blood, seen in tests. The risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with
prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin
dose, or a higher need of insulin due to major surgery or serious illness.
If you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid.
Your doctor may ask you to stop Steglujan.
It is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice regarding foot care given by
your healthcare professional. 
Cases of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) have been reported in patients receiving
sitagliptin (see section 4).
Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness,
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling
generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening
infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier’s gangrene which destroys the tissue
under the skin. Fournier’s gangrene has to be treated immediately.
When this medicine is used in combination with insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from
the pancreas, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may reduce the dose of your
insulin or other medicine.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Urine glucose
Because of how Steglujan works, your urine will test positive for sugar (glucose) while you are on this
medicine.
43
Children and adolescents
Children and adolescents below 18 years should not take this medicine. It is not known if this
medicine is safe and effective when used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Other medicines and Steglujan
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor:
• 
• 
if you are taking medicines which increase urine production (diuretics). 
if you are taking other medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood, such as insulin
or medicines that increase insulin release from the pancreas.
• 
if you are taking digoxin (a medicine used to treat irregular heartbeat and other heart problems).
The level of digoxin in your blood may need to be checked if you are taking it with Steglujan.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), tell your doctor.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
It is not known if Steglujan can harm your unborn baby. You should not take this medicine during
pregnancy.
It is not known if this medicine passes into breast milk. Talk with your doctor about the best way to
feed your baby if you take Steglujan. You should not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding or
plan to breast-feed.
Driving and using machines
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However,
dizziness and drowsiness have been reported with sitagliptin, which may affect your ability to drive or
use machines. Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy while taking Steglujan.
Taking this medicine in combination with insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from the
pancreas can cause blood sugar levels to drop too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms
such as shaking, sweating or changes in vision and may affect your ability to drive and use machines.
Steglujan contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
3.  How to take Steglujan
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
How much to take
• 
• 
The recommended dose of Steglujan is one tablet once a day.
The dose of Steglujan that you take will depend on your condition and the amount of
ertugliflozin and sitagliptin needed to control your blood sugar.
• 
Your doctor will prescribe the right dose for you. Do not change your dose unless your doctor
has told you to.
Taking this medicine
• 
Swallow the tablet; if you have difficulties with swallowing the tablet can be broken or crushed.
44

• 
•

You need to keep following your food and exercise plan while taking Steglujan.
If you take more Steglujan than you should
If you take too much Steglujan, talk to a doctor or pharmacist straight away.
If you forget to take Steglujan
What to do if you forget to take a tablet depends on how long it is until your next dose.
• 
If it is 12 hours or more until your next dose, take a dose of Steglujan as soon as you remember.
Then take your next dose at the usual time.
• 
If it is less than 12 hours until your next dose, skip the missed dose. Then take your next dose at
the usual time.

If you stop taking Steglujan
Do not stop taking this medicine without talking to your doctor. Your blood sugar levels may increase
if you stop the medicine.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.

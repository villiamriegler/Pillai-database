Following a high-fat meal in patients with solid tumours,

and 28%, respectively, as compared with fasting 
conditions. It is advised to take Zejula tablets without food 
(at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) or with a 
light meal.

minor corrections have been made to the product 
information to reflect that film-coated tablets are 
provided in blisters. Annex A has been revised

In Study NOVA, secondary efficacy endpoints included 
to amend an existing warning and add MDS/AML to 
the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with 
frequency common, and update of section 5.1 based 
on final results from NOVA study (213356); this is a 
Phase 3 Randomized double-blind trial of 
chemotherapy free interval (CFI), time to first subsequent 
therapy (TFST), PFS after the first subsequent therapy 
(PFS2), and OS. 
At the final analysis, the median PFS2 in the gBRCAmut 
cohort was 29.9 months for patients treated with niraparib

maintenance with niraparib versus placebo in 
patients with platinum sensitive relapsed ovarian 
cancer. In addition, the MAH took this opportunity to 
update sections 4.4 and 4.6 to update information on 
contraception based on EMA and CTFG 
recommendations and to make minor editorial 
changes in the SmPC. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. The RMP version 6.0 is approved. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
compared to 22.7 months for patients on placebo (HR = 
0.70; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.97). The median PFS2 in the non-
gBRCAmut cohort was 19.5 months for patients treated 
with niraparib compared to 16.1 months for patients on 
placebo (HR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.02). 
At the final analysis of overall survival, the median OS in 
the gBRCAmut cohort (n = 203) was 40.9 months for 
patients treated with niraparib compared with 38.1 months 
for patients on placebo (HR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.61, 1.20). 
The cohort maturity for the gBRCAmut cohort was 76%. 
The median OS in the non-gBRCAmut cohort (n = 350) was 
31.0 months for patients treated with niraparib compared 
with 34.8 months for patients on placebo (HR = 1.06; 95% 
CI: 0.81, 1.37). The cohort maturity for the non-gBRCAmut 
cohort was 79%. 
Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia 
(MDS/AML), including cases with fatal outcome, have been 
observed in patients treated with Zejula monotherapy or 
combination therapy in clinical trials and post-marketing. In 
the NOVA trial, the incidence of MDS/AML was higher in the 
gBRCAmut cohort (7.4%) than in the non-gBRCAmut 
cohort (1.7%). For suspected MDS/AML or prolonged 
haematological toxicities, the patient should be referred to 
a haematologist for further evaluation. If MDS/AML is 
confirmed Zejula treatment should be discontinued and the 
patient treated appropriately.

once daily. There are no data in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (any AST and TB > 3 x ULN). Patients 
with severe hepatic impairment could have increased 
exposure of niraparib based on data from patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment and should be carefully 
monitored.

(MRP2) has been included in the SmPC based on in vitro 
results. Niraparib and the major primary metabolite M1 are 
not substrate of MRP2. Niraparib is not an inhibitor of 
MRP2. Also, M1 does not appear to be an inhibitor of MRP2. 
Furthermore, the SmPC is updated to reflect the results 
from an UGT inhibition study in which niraparib did not 
exhibit inhibitory effect against the UGT isoforms (UGT1A1, 
UGT1A4, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7) up to 200  M in vitro.
